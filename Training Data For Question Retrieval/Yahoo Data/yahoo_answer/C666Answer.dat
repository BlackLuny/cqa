MdmkM1KQaa	Even if you are exaggerating, it is clear that he is putting a lot of effort into communicating with you. Guys don't put effort into things for nothing. Without a doubt I think he definitely likes you by the amount of attention he is giving to you, and the way that he cares about your opinion and how you feel about him. He messaged you and apologized for the phone incident, which shows that he does care what you think and feel. If he just wanted to be friends then he might just tell you the next time he talked to you, and he wouldn't have taken the extra time to contact you as he was heading out of town. That just shows that you are on his mind. Hope this helps.|`|XEJD4mLWaa	Well it sounds like he really likes you and wants to get your attention. That is why he keeps wanting to talk to you and texts you a lot. If you like him tell him, it would make life easier for him because right now he is probably thinking about you a lot and just wants to talk to you.|`|sEryEzoyaa	i think he likes u and he is flirting with u!!! tlk to him girl! lol go out of ur way to text him and that will mean a lot to him cause he knows u don't like texting :)|`|z1UXptEmaa	no guy in the hostory of the world wants to be friends with a girl... if he is nice to you that means he wants to do you... plain and simple... and its b/s if ppl say oh he is just being nice cause he wants to be friends.... girls have absolutely nothing to offer as far as friendship.... look at the the things guys do around just other guys...they burp, fart, pick their nose, dig they ***, dick around and talk about women, when there are girls around they usually have to act different, the only time in the hisotry of the world when a guy is friends with a girl is because she is unattractive to him and he knows ti will never ever go anywhere|`|FBSOBz0zaa	Awwwwwww, that's so cute! <3<br>  He likes you, go for it :)|`|owQXd4tIaa	he like you they exppress it weird|`|IE3i4dhNaa	he definately likes you...you should give it a go|`|AA10353801	It seems pretty clear to me that he's into you. I've never met a guy before who wanted to "just be friends" with a girl (unless he was dumping her of course).|`|ABbDYK8zaa	That's really tough. I would wait a while and see what happens. Maybe he does like you, it kinda seems that way. However, he could just be a very friendly person. Does he act that way around other girls? I have a close friend and he is very affectionate. A lot of people think we're dating but I know it's just his loving personality. If you really want to know what he's thinking, it'd be better to ask him up front. He'll appreciate your honesty and maybe then he'll admit to liking you. Boys can be tricky, I'm sorry. Good luck and he's right- no matter what, keep a smile.|`|oJV3rvsRaa	he likes you. you have a lot in common. id fu** him<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Au8imTlibuLZ7Mp5kxwD12Xsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304122310AAGvcdD">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|tITTUPVtaa	yes i do think he likes you.Now on how much im not very sure.I know how you feel though.Im having the same problem with this one guy.he sends all these signals,but at the same time,idk if he is meaning too,if i'm just thinking he is,im not sure in so many ways.And it likes eats away at me.Very frusterating i can tell.But if he likes talking to you that much,and also makes so many adorable and nice comments,then im positive he is attracted to you.maybe you should start with the next move,so you can make it move forward.Who knows,could be great(:<br>  <br>  goood luck|`|vBcqzMz4aa	rofl wow, meta are you a guy or just an extremely smart girl?

A lot of times your voice sounds really different than you think it does from the other end.  To him the text is probably just playful banter and he thinks nothing else of it.  The best way to clear things up is to talk to him in person and ask him for your self how he feels about you.
P96KyO77aa	Once you join your life is no longer yours. it belongs to the military. you will go where they send you and be there for as long as they send you.

While we all appreciate those who have served, the military are not the only ones who make this country great.|`|ru5Ydn42aa	Well for training you will have to ship to another state.

AA11879371	It was a dream.  It simply means he is thinking about you in a sexual way.  Yes, those are the hot spots.   If you have had a bad experience, take it slow.  This is a natural response when some one in your age bracket becomes serious about a relationship.   Take it really slow.  Have you thought about talking to a counselor?  This is serious stuff when your past experiences are taken into account.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun.|`|RgAVm7zCaa	You shouldn't be worried, people can't control their dreams. I'm guessing by "hotspots" he means like your private parts. Ha, I sound like I'm 7 when I say private parts. But yeah, hopefully you know what I mean by that. But back to the first part, no you shouldn't be worried.<br>  <br>  xx-Shelby|`|QHKTDw4iaa	Hey, you're sixteen... I mean, the dream was probably due to raging hormones. I wouldn't be too worried unless he tries to force sexual acts on you without your consent. Eh, a hot-spot is just your "private" area.

We've been married for 7 years and have a son. It's no more dangerous than meeting someone in a bar or club. They're total strangers, too, when you meet them. If you meet in a public place and don't give out a phone number and never your street address, you should have a lot of fun.|`|OD3hxWxvaa	Personally i think it is <br>  <br>  A. A waste of time.<br>  B. Dangerous ( you don't know who is really on the other end.)<br>  C. A waste of money.<br>  D. Just goes to show that the people you ALREADY know don't like you too much.... (not to be offensive, but that's what it comes off as)<br>  E. Just kind of useless.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	She's right--everyone starts as a stranger!<br>  <br>  I know of 3 couples who met and married that way. I met my hubby online, too, but in a chat room. As long as you find the ones who are honest, you'll be fine.|`|Dhsyroekaa	dumb unsafe|`|YWQdsoOMaa	I thought that a date was when you meet face to face at a particular location, where you could get to really get a feel for someone.  I don't think there is such thing as online dating.  Meeting online to get to know each other better is a possibility but you can't really date online.  The world is so big and so interconnected, that I feel it is just another resource to find someone you might be compatible with.  I also feel that you can be a little more secure and confident on the internet but be cautious when giving out information.  It is best to meet in a public area first with loads of people.  You can never be too careful but you can always be too careless.|`|RgAVm7zCaa	Dumb. Such a waste of time, why would you want to date someone you have never met. You don't go on dates, you don't see each other, seriously, what a waste. Meeting guys on the streets, yeah they are a stranger at first but you get to know them, you know for the most part they are who they say they are. On the internet it could be like some 60 year old pedophile. <br>  <br>  xx-Shelby|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	It`s ok if they know what they are doing.  It`s no different than meeting someone any other way. I mean any `first date` can go wrong.<br>  <br>  As long as they get to know them as much as they can online and try to check them out , and have their first date in a crowded public place.<br>  <br>  It they can never meet because they are too far away, then it IS a waste of time.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Works great - I met my wife online.<br>  <br>  Generally, everybody you meet for the first time is a total stranger.<br>  <br>  If you meet a guy in the bar - he's a total stranger.<br>  <br>  Even people at work - you might know their names - but what do you really know about them outside of work?|`|0AXgXFpraa	i think its a total watse of time and the guy WILL not be the way u expected him to be|`|AA12239113	Waste of time & money.|`|v0596BTeaa	It is how I met my partner and we are still happily together after 7 years.|`|5QRIWopSaa	If you're shy then I guess it's easier to talk to a stranger online, but when you meet them in person, that'd be pretty nerve-wracking. <br>  <br>     I don't like the deceit that comes with all the people who use fake photos. I mean, the first thing I learn about you is a lie? That's kinda sleazy. <br>  <br>  She is right that every guy you meet on the street is a stranger too, but it's also true that the people online are strangers, and could be lying about everything they say. Just like the people in real life.<br>  <br>  I think most of the pros, and cons of both dating in person, and online, are pretty similar. If something makes someone feel more open, and safe, then they should do it. Cautiously.<br>  <br>  I'm not into dating online or in person, but I can see how if I was, I would probably try online since I get SO nervous in person. Even with people I know, and like. <br>  But you can't really get married and just talk on the PC so ... XD<br>  I'd have to get over that if someone was really awesome.|`|5e8eded290e38b80329a8ef88d005cbbaa	The reason I dont like dating online is because of the amount of sex predators there are out there. Anyone can lie about who they really on the Internet. I believe dating online is a waste because it makes it seems as though you are desperate and that you are trying to do anything just to get a date. Your friend is not a very smart person if she is dating someone who os a total stranger to her. Does she not know people personally who she could talk to or go out on dates with?|`|AA11083274	It's funny that most of the people that wrote it's lame are kids.  Yes, if you're like under 20, you're a kid to most of the world.<br>  <br>  It is what it is.  Most of the adult world doesn't have cute little clubs and friend clicks to meet people through, so it's a lot of chance anyway.  Why not open another path to meet people through.<br>  <br>  On the other hand a lot of them are filled with fakes and people looking for green cards, but how many people that you talk to in person are fake too?  As far as safety, be careful.  I'm a fairly big guy, so I'm not very worried about it.  But, I still insist on meeting in a public place first to help put her mind at ease.<br>  <br>  Like most things in life, it works for some, not for everyone.<br>  <br>  It seems that people have 2 opinions of "online dating".  The first that you only "date" online.  You're all right, that sounds lame.  Why just sit at a computer and IM or something.  But using online dating to find someone and going out to date is a different thing altogether.|`|QUJ4F5Boaa	I used to think it was desperate and pathetic and reserved for ugly people but dating is hard. We can all use a bit of help.I tried it once with great success. It forced me to get to know someone without focusing on their looks (that sounds vapid, I know, but you have to like the looks of someone).|`|Di6FAQxRaa	It is the same as meeting a guy online except the guy in person doesnt have as many other women texting or im'ming him and leaving him comments. The guy online may be talking to many other girls opposed to the guy in person.|`|RElSzZtyaa	i think if you have trouble meeting people, then go for it. it only matters what you think of it... just give it a shot|`|yaSETiDLaa	Lameeeeee. :)|`|LvWgMLEGaa	Stupid.|`|KqypHx4Eaa	Not good.<br>  Never know what a girl you're looking for looks like.|`|jtEycSCpaa	It's dumb.|`|WnCTxGQNaa	there's nothing wrong with it as long as your careful. there some crazy people in this world|`|tFbdkxyIaa	i dislike it, but i know some people who met their real partners like that.|`|8JtGkqDGaa	I don't like it.|`|P3OWfxi5aa	its stupid and dangerous...|`|bQ0PpuSyaa	online dating is for uglies and losers|`|X2FrjG8Laa	i think thats so stupid|`|mpwH3dSiaa	I think it's okay to meet someone online... but dating them online is pretty weird because the fun part of being in a relationship is lost completely... it's pointless and also embarrassing<br>  If they're around your area and you know people who know them then I think it's okay to think about dating them on the internet to begin with because meeting up will be inevitable.<br>  <br>  I guess if you friend really fell in love with someones personality and she found that person easy to talk to and she felt loved by him/her. I'm sure it's okay. Even though I personally wouldn't do it... it can be okay in certain circumstances.|`|9qmWUg6xaa	It's annoying, but as long as you keep your expectations realistic, you'll be fine.  There are many fakes and flakes, just as in real life.  In some ways, it's better, as you can meet someone more on your own schedule, and don't have to deal with bars and such.  Plus, until you meet in real life, if you keep your online contacts controlled, then you can easily cut them off if needed.|`|DBc6Gep1aa	Well it can be a good and bad thing<br>  <br>  however my friend is obsessed! she has met this guy on the internet (she is 15) and she has never spoken to him on the phone or even saw him on webcam, she says she is madly in love.. so then he told me he didnt love her and she even made a fake account and told her he has a gf, when she told him she knew he sayed iloveyou and i didnt tell you because i didnt want to hurt you .. i told her and she believed him a guy she has never met over her best friend of 4 years.. <br>  it can mess people up <br>  <br>  <br>  on the other hand i no people who have got married from it [= <br>  <br>  x<br>  its just when you lose touch of reality and focus on fantasy and what you want to think is true|`|hUt8Vt7oaa	Doing it the way she's doing it is dangerous and foolish, just like meeting a stranger on the street and taking him home is dangerous and foolish.<br>  <br>  Going through an online dating service that screens people might be safer, but it still lacks the connection you make with a person face-to-face.|`|Oh9wfPFeaa	you just have to b really careful about wwho you meet beacuse even if you go on facebook or myspace....guys could put their friends pics up their kids pics or nething people are crazy these days and even if you o eventually meet this person somewhere dont go to the movies it dark and anything could happen go to a public place not too public where theres hundreds of people but you know be safe...ive met guys online before and nothing has happened|`|RibCqVSqaa	that guy who put **** you.. lol<br>  <br>  anyway.. i think its a good opportunity.. im actually think of doing the same.. <br>  try it.. and see how it turns out to be first.. make sure you start of as friends.. of course.. and go on..|`|MocCfpILaa	i think dating online is a bit risky...but in a way i guess it could work out. it guves u a chance to get to kno someone without having to actualy meet.

She's not ready for a new relationship, but as soon as you said that you didnt want to know her, she got scared of losing you, then later kissed you.

So trust your self if you know he loves and you feel it and realise it's real then theres no need to get mad be glad!<br>  <br>  Gail Friend.|`|AA12117694	because love is a strong word...simple as that, you start using it too much and it gets more common..I dont know how to explain it, if your guy said I love you everyday you would start to espect it from him and therefore the word would be common, when he says it rarely it actually puts more meaning behind it.|`|oHN6jwjoaa	well maybe he isn't sure if he loves you as<br>  fully as he can.<br>  guys take a little more time at saying it<br>  then girls do.|`|X2FrjG8Laa	probably he is not ready to say he loves you or he dont feel the same way for you|`|ua5jN1V0aa	soem people do that on purpose becuase they are either:<br>  <br>  -scared<br>  -dont want to hurt you<br>  - dont wanna get hurt<br>  -or dont feel the same way<br>  <br>  some ppl will ay "i love you" "love you" "luv u" just to go around the fact that its not true, kinda like a white lie. <br>  <br>  <br>  "im in love with you" is what ppl should say and everyone knows that.<br>  they just go around it bcus it makes them feel better about not hurting you.|`|r7iTzPdtaa	He's either really misguided and insecure in his idea of masculinity, or he just doesn't really love you.<br>  <br>  Either way, it's not your fault.|`|6oSm5Qxzaa	definitely sounds like he isn't actually in love with you, no offense. Basically if you never said it then you guys wouldn't be saying it at all. If he was really feeling it then he would want to tell you. You can't really abuse it so that is just a cop out.|`|997xzJuraa	Because he doesn't love you. In all probability, he hates you. Stop being an unlovable sap and get off of the dating scene, human waste.|`|ayM5TlcXaa	hes probably just saying it because really there is nothing else to say wen that cums up. but there is the possibility that he really isnt sure about how he feels. or he could just be really shy|`|NyCJu4zpaa	Because he dosen't. Hes just keeping up with the fact that you keep saying you love him.|`|5nAnWp3daa	guys arent as lovy dovy as girls|`|xAKf7cEZaa	he probably doesn't love you and just feels pressure to say it to you if i were you i wouldn't say it anymore

I can't make it to the ceremonies but give me a yell at your divorce party. 50% of all marriages fail. You have better odds of getting hit by a bus and it would most likely be more exciting"<br>  Love the one and only Nolte.|`|G2tnn5yjaa	Drop it in the mail.

Just tell her how you feel.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	either way depends on how personal you want it to be..and how close you are to them...we have my FMIL mail a contgratulations card..so odd..we live 8 blocks away from each other...|`|wmSSCZ5paa	Better enclose a voucher for a free weekend at the Heart Break Hotel if it doesn't work out .....|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	HAHAHAHA!  you're hilarious!

But if you mean that you are trying to tell her that you are unable to come to the wedding, just sending the RSVP back with a "unfortunately I am unable to attend" is all you need to do. If the condolences are for something else, such as a death in the family, either mailing or hand delivering are both fine.|`|sGP6s7uraa	I think you should hand write it AND hand deliver it.  That way, you've spent all that time and effort on it just so she can slap you once she receives it.  Best of luck!|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Maybe she is happy and not sad. Even though you disapprove why don't' you wish her well.|`|b32501726d33018adfee15dc84a32f79aa	It should definitely be done by Strip-O-Gram.<br>  <br>  Edit: oops...that answer was taken.  Well, it's a good one.
88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	Your level of insecurity is not healthy.  If your boyfriend has given you no reason to think he's interested in this girl, or that he would cheat, let it go.  Jealousy is an ugly thing that tears relationships apart.  You can't do anything about how she feels.  You know he loves you, and have no reason to think he has any feelings for her.  That's all you can do.  Stop obsessing before you create a problem that isn't there.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	if he really loves you then why are you worried? if he really loves you and she tries to do anything, he will be like "*****, back off!" (maybe not in those words, but you know what i mean)<br>  <br>   try to not let it get to you. it sounds like you and this guy have a really good thing going, and if you do it wont matter what this woman throws at him, he wont do anything<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  wait a minute. are you that girl who keeps asking the same question in differant words? either that or theres a LOOOT of hairstylists dating tattoo artists on this forum.  perhaps if you ARE the one asking all these questions you should go sort out your problems outside of yahoo answers.  becuase as long as you keep asking the same question, your going to keep getting the same answer.|`|KNYF1hnhaa	Its not uncommon for people to have crushes on others that are taken.  Unless she tries to act on her crush, you have nothing to worry about and I wouldnt stress on it.<br>  <br>  If she does start making moves, I would talk to your boyfriend about it.|`|29I8PWrxaa	Well you can't do anything if she hasn't done anything yet.  Let her be envious.  Who cares?  To be honest though it sounds like you are jealous of her or why would you be so annoyed every time she laughs at his jokes or is around him.  And please stop posting the same thing just to talk about yourself.|`|AA10975867	You keep posting the same question, just rewording it. Your guy is a tatto  artist, he has wild and crazy friends, etc.,etc. But in every question you have either jealousy problems or are questioning your own suitability. You also keep telling people how wonderful you are and how ugly one woman is, or how fat a woman is, or some horrible criticism of other women compared to you. Sorry but you sound extremely immature for a 26 year old!! Either get some actual confidence and accept your relationship or break up and take a few years to get some maturity.|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	tell him what you heard her say. he might act more rude or act further away from her if you tell him. If they start to get closer then that is just a bad sign for your relationship. If he loves you there would be nothing wrong with telling him, and you have nothing to worry about. You should just let her envy you. That is her problem she likes him. Just act extra close around her and maybe she'll get the picture.|`|o1VteNdGaa	if i was in your shoes i would just Straight up tell my boyfriend how she feels and then tell him that i don't want him hanging around her ever|`|63ff74d8b74029f44c5d4403dc78e14aaa	Is beating here with a Louisville Slugger out of the question?|`|nAe0sYrsaa	would talk to my boyfriend about it first thing...and go from there|`|7a0LdEt8aa	The only way you'll feel better is to talk to one or both of them about it. You should tell him that you overheard her and now she makes you uncomfortable-at least that way he'll know to be aware of it when she's around. And I would say something to her too, tell her you know how she feels, but it's just too bad, he's taken. Also tell her that you told him, if she's shy, that will probably make her embarrassed enough that she'll back off.|`|sLLgERQWaa	Are you that insecure in  his feelings for you that you believe another has a chance with him? The problem is within you, dear and unless you start to trust him not to cheat or leave you for any one your jealousy will not be corrected...and if he gets fed up with it he will leave......<br>  ...if his love is trustworthy and true NO ONE can take him away from you any any way shape or form.....feel sorry for her that she has to focus her attention on someone she can't have instead of letting the little green monster appear in you. Good luck.
NQcHRUbfaa	It is your business if they are asking you to give them money and your baby items. It would be worth the drive all that stuff for 40 dollars! Do it! Then you are still helping and no you won't be the bad guy.Plus maybe you could give her some subtleinstructions on how to keep it clean etc. I would definetly do it!|`|nCWjdyddaa	I find it interesting that they feel that they can ask you to give them such expensive items. Even if you were done with them, they should wait until it's offered. I don't think you're being "cold-hearted" at all. Some of that stuff won't make it through more than two babies, and you'll end up buying new for your next one.<br>  <br>  I agree with you. Make the trip and get the stuff.|`|X2FrjG8Laa	dont worry about i think you shouldn go just let her buuy the things alone whenever you really see they need hepl then do it but its not your abligation to do it|`|CZg79Qy9aa	You sound very jealous and even a little cold hearted.  Why can't she use your stuff?  She is already pregnant.  You could tell her it is all a loan and you want it back when/if you have another baby.  <br>    Sorry to say, but its none of your business how much they bring home and not your business if you think they have enough money for another baby.<br>    YOu need to get off your judgemental high horse and be happy for your brother and sister in law.<br>    Come on lady....get a grip|`|EjyD1sXeaa	your husband is right.<br>  you are an enabler, you have already lent them 2000 and your SIL gets her NAILS done. come on, that's why she's dirty, cos she can't clean properly with those nice nails.<br>  they need to get their priorities right, save NAIL money and stand on their own two feet.<br>  <br>  why are they going to bring another human into their poverty?<br>  what will they want from you next?<br>  <br>  stop right now|`|gC8xO53Oaa	That is so worth it! If they or your husband doesn't want to drive 1.5 hrs, is there a thrift store or something similar close by? I've seen some nice items there or maybe a used furniture store or one that has things on consignment. Check around locally and see what you can find. I understand not wanting to loan something if you know they won't take care of it. That was what I was going to mention before I finished your question.
eO4y3m1maa	Some people are just weird like that, I get like that...but Im not a lesbian.|`|AA10277662	ummm i think she likes you...i had the same thing happen to me but i just had to tell her i didn't feel the same way...so try doin the same let her know how you feel about liking her tell her that you still wanna be her friend if you do n that she should really let her boyfriend know before it get out of control|`|yQCg9Kemaa	Prolly its u who's thinking wrong about her!!  may be she likes u as a friend and normally happy to see u.  If u think tht her reaction is strange then u might as well talk to her rather than cooking up stories in ur heart.  Be clear and let her know that all u need is her friendship.|`|njz5XFG2aa	Ask her if she is gay to be sure,some people are just...strange like that.|`|J9jb56L2aa	she wants to get in your pants i sugjest eating her dog|`|oIFMohfUaa	Yes, it's fine.  She's not molesting you, just hugging you.  Maybe you make her happy!  Doesn't mean it's sexual.  <br>  <br>  If you are uncomfortable at any time, maybe then you need to tell her that.  <br>  <br>  Just because she's a lesbian, does not mean she likes you that way!  <br>  <br>  I've attracted lesbians my whole life...but they are only friends!  They are comfortable around me because I am not a judgemental person.  <br>  <br>  Live and let live.

iPNOVR6Gaa	I think your mistake was telling your boyfriend that you intend to tell your mother how you feel.  I think that doing so invited him into a family dynamic in which he has no place whatsoever.  You need to tell him that, from now on, if he has any opinions about your relationship with your mother, he needs to keep them to himself.<br>  <br>  Edit: Please, please ignore the people telling you that you need to tell your mother how you feel so that she'll get better help, or to get her help.  As much as you may like to believe that some magical words from you are going to cause a change in your mother, the odds are strongly against that.  She's been this way for years, and it is unlikely that anything you or anyone else says to her is likely to change her.  My advice would actually be the opposite: be a college student, and stay away from your mother's drama.  Now is the time for you to live your own life.  I hope you're getting counseling for the inevitable emotional scars your mother has inflicted on you growing up.|`|TGFc2Z6Caa	Your boyfriend sounds like a domineering unsympathetic jerk. If he just makes your bad situation worse, you don't need him.<br>  Your mother's problems ,however, are not your responsibility to fix.<br>  Your father is a professional who can .deal with her suicide attempts  and your parents' relationship is not  your business.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	He's just a boyfriend, she's your mom. Plus their is no promise that you and him will be together forever, but she will always be your mom. If he can't help support you through a time like this, then he's really not worth having in your life at all.|`|WdW1ga14aa	maybe you could talk with your mom and ask her to go to Counseling or something.  And as far as your bf, I would talk with him and tell him that you need him there to support you, not to tell you to get a "BACK BONE" .  It is hard for some people to understand things when it is not them who is involved in it.<br>  <br>  I hope that your mom gets the help that she needs and good luck to you all.|`|WvOvoxLxaa	I would be talking to your father and find out just what is going on with your mother. I would find out why this continues to happen and she isn't getting the help she needs.  You also need to go to your mom and tell her that she needs help and that you don't know what is going on between your father and her, but they need to be accountable for what is going on.  Tell them that you can not take the problems they have on and do a good job at school. Maybe they don't understand how much this effects you.   As far as your boyfriend goes, tell him that if it was the other way around that you would be there for him to help him through the problems instead of heaping more on your head.  He doesn't sound like the best person for you, if he can't be supportive to you.  Tell him to figure out what he would do if he got a call about one of his family. If he can't support you, tell him to hit the road, that you have enough problems without an insensitive boyfriend making you feel worse.  Demand respect, not only from him, but your parents should also show you respect.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Your bf's role in this family situation is to listen to what you need to say and lovingly support you. It's not his business, it's not his problem to solve, and he's way over the line to criticize how you're dealing with it.<br>  <br>  Think about your previous relationship with him. Does he accept you and support you , or is he controlling and unpleasant. I suspect it's the latter. If I'm correct, I would strongly advise that you break up with him. He' supposed to add something to your life. If he isn't, he's replaceable.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to hear about what you're going through with your mom.|`|AA11513689	this is YOUR MOTHER, and you know what? Your bf is controlling, and evil to tell you anything other than 'yes, talk to you mom, help her, she NEEDS YOU'.<br>  If he gets mad, tell him that this is still YOUR LIFE, NOT HIS.<br>  No bf has a right to act like he is.|`|j8aCEtg8aa	If your mom wanted to kill herself, she'd be dead already. Stop letting her suck you into her drama and bullsh!t and live your life. If that means cutting her off until she grows up, then tell her so and be done with it.|`|ZzjUHawhaa	drop his ***. take care of your mom but dont let her control ur life becuz of her issues. get another man boo becuz honestly a real man wouldn't act the way he does when something like this happens. u deserve better in your time of need. DROP HIS SORRY ***!!!!|`|JzY8x9Umaa	Dang! A freshman in college and you dont know that your mother should be more important to you than a inconsiderate boyfriend? <br>  UNREAL!|`|MBGAocDNaa	ur boyfriend is an A**hole! he's not sensitive at all, u need to dump him ASAP|`|PILm2U4Taa	Your boyfriend should be helpful and supportive to YOU as you deal with your mother's issues. There's no reason he should be adding to your stress...<br>  <br>  At 18, our certainly not a child anymore, but dealing with your mother's issues is the type of thing that would be difficult for anyone at ANY age. If you need to show a backbone, tell the BF to back the hell off and either help you, or get out of the damn way...<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|TpBHi8S2aa	I hate to tell you this but your b/f is right... I mean if you really care about your mother which I'm sure you do... you will make her get help!!  You won't accept no for an answer from her.  Take charge of the situation since no one else will.  Its dumb for you to say "well I'm not going to make my mom get help because I care about her"  If you don't SHE WILL DIE!!!! how is that?  GET HER HELP!!  Good luck!!|`|uHwIz8U3aa	I've been there. Same with my mother. My sisters and brother and I have gone through this sense I was about 12 years old and being the oldest of them all I've had to be the grown up and deal with it. The first time, my mother set us down to eat diner and locked herself in her room with a gun. My little brother and I had to break the door down and then wrestle the gun away that is just one incident. It really screws a kid up you know. If your parents cant be strong and lead by example little kids tend to grow up weak too. It has really done a number on my family even though we are all adults now some of my family has not come back from it till this day. My brother is very suicidal and has almost succeeded twice. He is now getting help with his anger and depression but I really think she is the biggest reason for him not being able to cope. Its kinda of hard to stay positive and be happy during times like these. I think you really need to tell her how you feel, but only when you are ready. This does not make you a coward. You have to be in the situation to understand. So if your bf cant just be there and support you then you may have to blow him off. Tell him to back off and let you deal with it on your own terms. Be strong you will pull through this. Dont take to much time in sorting out your thoughts on what to say to her. I can tell you from experiance that though you plan on saying it one way it comes out different anyways so dont waste to much time on practicing how to say it.|`|e3b8b825895e40fb941cd8e7d2ea18a0aa	First your boyfriend should be supportive of you and your decisions and not be so judgmental.  Second you should talk to a counselor yourself that can help you with all of your feelings and help you make the decisions that you need to make.|`|rJLdYKXYaa	although your boyfriend is getting a little harsh with his words, you need to listen to him. if you tell your mom how she feels, maybe she will seek better help and not resort to attempting suicide. tell her this before it's too late.|`|5nAnWp3daa	your bf a jerk be there for your moms|`|1Y0yPiSvaa	Your boyfriend should not be sticking himself in the middle of your relationship with your mom. Honestly, this is more of a problem between your mom and your dad. I would talk to your dad and arrange a sit down where both you and your dad could speak to your mom about her issues. This way if the both of you speak to your mom together all of you could give each other support. Do not attack your mother with how it is making you feel but appeal to her by trying to understand why she does it. It really does seem like your mother needs a psychiatrist. If you don't like how your boyfriend responds to things like this then do not share it with him. If you need someone to confide in then try family or friends.|`|GU4S78ejaa	You're boyfriend has a right to his opinion but he doesn't understand where you're coming from & you don't understand where he's coming from... obviously that's why you argue. I think you should really talk to your mom though. What if 1 of these days she really does succeed at it. She won't ever know how you feel! Tell her to quit being selfish & to think of you & her family! You don't have to be mean but just have a heart to heart. It will be good for the both of you. Good luck!|`|aWgdX0pZaa	A women asked the same question the other day but she was married though, IDK you might be the same person. But anyway, seems like your mom is trying to get attention and your b/f got tired of it already b/c maybe he's realized that your mom is just blaffing all the time. Try to focus in your studies which are really important. I'm not saying you shouldn't worry about your mom but she needs help and she needs to take it b/c is affecting you and your studies which is not good. She's being selfish with that.|`|b24df69d84b8825cbad6921ea5cc6874aa	For starters your parents have no right putting you in the middle of their problems.<br>  Your BF is upset because he sees what it is doing to you & he don't know what to do to help you.<br>  It has nothing to do with having a back bone you just don't know how to be honest with your mom & your afraid if you say the wrong thing it might just take her over the edge.<br>  Some one needs to tell your mom the truth it is either going to be you or maybe your dad, don't really matter it has to be done or else you will be putting her 6' deep <br>  So you need to decide be honest with her or bury her!!!!!!!!!!! <br>  What is it going to be?????<br>  If my husband didn't have enough courage to get me the help I need I would hope like he!! that one of my kids would.<br>  I would so hate to be in your shoes right now, you must be going through so much.<br>  Don't be angry with the BF maybe he can help you find a way to tell her what she needs to hear to stop this self destruction.
AA11663530	The main reason why my current boyfriend is no longer with his ex-girlfriend because nothing was working out between the both of them and they're never on the same page. Although his ex-girlfriend is curious about the current relationship that he's sharing with me, he's very vague about it with her. Besides, our relationship is none of her business and she needs to accept that. I don't mean to sound rude, but again, it's none of her business.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	I know why my husband left all three ex wives and he knows why I left all three of my ex husbands.  The last one I had no choice because he made death threats to anyone I would be with.  From the first contact we agreed on complete total honesty, to this day we are faithful to this.|`|7LOpJW3zaa	Yeah not that I believe him :/<br>  But he knows why me and my ex broke up, we're pretty open about it. However with my last ex I never really felt comfortable talking about previous ex's and stuff like that.|`|OxDz2Ympaa	because she is "a phyco 8itch"<br>  his words not mine.|`|0NqEMPfiaa	because she was a slut.
BCNsuqgRaa	Its all the signs that he likes you. There is a lot of pressures when you get up into those years. Pressure to get girlfriends and boyfriends. And in the pressure he may have discovered that the friendship, wasn't all he wanted. Try talking to him more about things he knows so that he doesn't have to feel stupid around you.|`|XiW31W6Caa	he does like you but in front of his friends he acts like that because that his friends may talk about you and so he wont get teased he jus tries to fit in with his crew. so don't worry.  ask him how *** he is changing now.|`|J9jb56L2aa	eat their cat|`|DsFFjBtOaa	he likes you, and his friends know so when they see him around you they are going to tease him.|`|BjyXKFpRaa	he must like you or some body has said something about you then boys just stupid

It's not all about how you do it either, it's about changing it up and keeping it fun. <br>  Sex is an important part of a relationship, but it isn't what it's ALL about.|`|uFJdh913aa	Not everyone believes sex is important in a relationship, most do.

So I guess it depends on if she has been around the block or not!!!!!|`|0Hd3uzEFaa	Heterosexual intercourse is for homos|`|SRZza0cWaa	No not really..  have actually found out that sex ruins a relationship.. 1st everything is Great and as soon as you hit the sack together bamm.. he gets all distant &irritated with you.. no more phone calls & that's when you know is over...x & it hurts like hell.x cos that's when you the girl starts to fall for him & he starts to pull away from you..:'(|`|82A8E4yzaa	I don't think it really matters to be honest...i think there is other things....small things he does..which are far more important.|`|WMR8hVlfaa	Being "good" in bed is largely a subjective thing. If the couple has sexual chemistry and really connect with each other, then the sex will be good even if one or both partners are inexperienced. My boyfriend and I were virgins when we met each other, but every sexual encounter has been amazing because I love him and we have crazy chemistry. Would others consider him "good" in bed? Who knows -- or cares?|`|aiRn2lQGaa	well having sex is a way to get intimate and convey your feelings in an intimate way and if every timeyou have sex you it ends awkward it may effect your relationship. as long as you communicate openly with your partner on things you both liek and dislike and are willing to work on it, i don't think you'll have a problem|`|ew7hjcLpaa	Yes it is important, if you wish the relationship to survive.

JhvqUvlsaa	Approach Kevin or call him and ask to talk to him. If he doesn't want to, say "OK I'm here if you want to talk." Then leave it at that. Then tell Paige to go to Kevin and tell him that she was only joking around. See if that softens him up a little. Then give him a chance to cool off. Then approach him again and say that Paige was just horsing around and she didn't mean to hurt him. Then ask him if he likes you as more than a friend. If he does, tell him that's really really sweet but you have always liked him as just a friend and you hope you can remain friends. It's very sweet and considerate of him and lets him know you're not leaving him high and dry if you do go out with Eric. =)

(They might lie and disagree, but trust me act like a mommy and they'll be hooked for good.) You can also try touching his arm, that's a common body language sign that you are interested.

hWvvrEphaa	I'm not telling you this so you can go out and pick up a girl and sleep with her like a lot of Pick Up Artists do but you should research PUA (pick up artists). PUA study the art of getting comfortable enough with woman to be attracted you based on your confidence. I know this works because I have friends who joined the website and became masters at getting very pretty girls to like them.<br>  <br>  I hate the idea that a lot of guys use this as a means to get pretty girls to sleep with them so please, don't do that. However, all the information they will give you will help you in your quest to get a girl.<br>  <br>  Sadly, I know all the tricks of the trade so it hasn't and won't work on me. Plus I have a boyfriend who would break the hands of anyone who tried to pick me up.<br>  <br>  5 months from now, you'll be thanking me, despite any thumbs down I may get. Trust me.|`|nS83ag9raa	if you would have put "i" instead of "he" you could have saved time and finger energy

HE will in HIS time, I promise you that.

Good luck to you.|`|RIjjibnwaa	not sure & dont make it so long i cba to read it :(<br>  omg a purity ring? wf! those things are so stupid, sex is no big deal, you wont get married till like 30-40 & you'll still be a virgin by then? wtf i could never do that! HAVE SEX !!! lmao (:|`|X2FrjG8Laa	dam to long to read|`|AA11492911	Good for you hun! Here you go I am a woman not a man and I am different from you in almost every way but I Really respect you and your question. You just wait for the guy who will respect you and what you fell. Make sure he will wait and not pressure you and that he respects your interests and it would be great if he liked s few of the same things. I am glad you asked but Honey if he doesn't show up don't despair. Just wait until you are 18 and then go out and find a man who will treat you the way you deserve  and who is what you are looking for. Keep in mind it's a long hard road and most people don't meet their soul mate until around  28-32 yrs old. If your lucky it could happen now. But no matter when it does you will know and its worth the wait no matter what.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	1st off, there's a reason children shouldn't date. Don't take offense, you sound pretty squared away but there's really no need to rush. At most you should just be getting onto the edges of dating - like mixed-gender group events - to develop the social acumen you'll need later<br>  <br>  O.K., next: Would guys be interested in you? Oh, hell yes! Look back over your "profile;" one of us who shares your morals will dig you very much. For a guy who wants a real friend, partner, wife etc - you sound just about perfect.<br>  So there's no misunderstanding my "angle," it's just that I remember being your age and I'm approaching the question from there, dig? High-School me was always on the lookout for someone like what you describe.<br>  Maybe you'll find him in church. No, I'm not saying life's all about that, but if you get to know a guy who goes because he's into it, not just because "it's just what we do on Sunday," he's going to be more likely to appreciate your view on sex and relationships.<br>  <br>  Stand your ground on the makeup thing. We don't dig it. If you're hot, we put-up with it. That isn't the same thing as liking it. A few guys are into it, of course. You see them hanging around the circus. (or at least their girlfriends look like they belong in one)<br>  <br>  Now - I digress for an important disclaimer - Even us "good guys" have almost no real control of ourselves around a girl we like, especially under intimate conditions. Always imagine we're on a drive together. YOU are the only one with a brake-pedal. Once you start down any sort of physically intimate hill, ours won't work anymore and unless YOU put-on the brakes we will plummet with you all the way to the bottom.  It's not an evil plot, it's just how we're wired. "Just one more step," we keep telling ourselves, then it's "just one more" past that . . etc.<br>  I promise that no matter how much we respect you and love you we WILL try to get into your pants. The difference is that "regular guys" will ALWAYS be trying to lead you there but we just lose to temptation under "high hormone" conditions. Be careful.|`|r7iTzPdtaa	haha sorry people don't know how to read.  <br>  <br>  I skimmed your question, because I got the idea in the first few lines.  <br>  You're a basic catch.  Cute, nice, pretty, a good girl who respects her body and has morals.  Those are great traits that attract most guys.<br>  <br>  However, you don't want most guys, you want one with the same values, and those are tough to find.  Especially at your age.  Be mature and realistic; you're not going to find a 16-18 year old guy who is ready for "the real deal".  They're still developing their character.  <br>  <br>  Try reading this great christian book called <br>  "dateable: are you, are they?"<br>  <br>  It tells you how to date and keep your morals, and keep the guys really interested.  Try to focus on the rest of your life, and keep becoming the best person you can be when God does bring the right man into your life later on.|`|ki42DNTpaa	ok im not sure what kind of guy would be interested but i just wanted to tell you that everything you wrote about yourself is true about me to, pretty strange first person i meet thats like me except im 14.|`|997xzJuraa	Your type would be some Bible thumping Puritan who thinks masturbation is the Devil and hates having any sort of fun.

Um. just some stuff about me..<br>  i am a christian as well, i do try to make it to every service, i, just as you do believe in sex AFTER marriage, and i love girls who are not conceited all the time, who think that makeup and stuff like that is all there is to live for. i like to keep in touch with my girl (when i have one. lol) but i do not neccesarily have to keep in touch with her 24/7. some girls are all about holding hands, that kind of stuff all the time but however i believe that it is more important to spend time and get to know someone than to just look like the "cutest couple" lol. i am also 16 years old, i will turn 17 in july. i am not petite but i am not JUMBO! lol i am about 168 pounds but i just look a little chubbier because of my height. (only 5'4) but i am about to hit a growth spirt in which i hope to be as tall as my dad (5'11) well that is all about me um. i would like to get to know you if you would like you could email me at mr_boy92@yahoo.com if u want|`|ECfpe1MOaa	Nice one, I always wanted to learn the piano.

RoFfCYGxaa	Maybe he isn't interested in having a relationship with you, but that doesn't mean he doesn't find you attractive.  Maybe he thinks you are hot but doesn't want to act on it because you guys are friends.  Either way, he really is sending you some mixed signals.|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	Well either<br>  1 : he realized he's into you and is hoping you'll get the hints and give him another chance. DON'T ask him though, let him come to you this time<br>  <br>  2: you all drank lots at your friend house and he was tipsy and horny|`|U3tZzGlgaa	I can understand why he said that.  Remember that he is a guy and will have the urge to have sex with you, despite how he feels for you.  Since he likes you (as a friend), he's naturally attracted to you, but apparently not enough to start a relationship.  It's hard to stay focused on how you truly feel about someone when you're in bed with them.  He seems like a good guy who doesn't want to hurt your friendship by using you for sex, but he can only resist temptation just so far.  I'd probably say the same thing to my closest gal friend if we were in bed together.  But I'm actually smart enough to stay out of those situations.  Even the best of friends will have a hard time not having sex with one another if they allow them to get into situations like yours too often.  My advice to you is to stay out of bed with him if you want to keep him your friend.  Unless, he really does want a relationship.  But even then, I'd stay out of bed with him since he doesn't seem to be sure he wants you like that.  There's a reason why people wait for marriage.  It's the only way you can be sure that he doesn't want you just physically.  A guy who truly loves you can and would wait for you until you're married.  Remember that.|`|AA10470911	I am going to have to agree with Gayle.<br>  <br>  Men can sleep with anyone and have sex, feelings or not. I believe it's a BOOTY CALL situation.<br>  <br>  Kick him to the curb. If a woman breathes on a man they think of sex. Don't sleep with him again or have sex with him unless you just want a one night stand.|`|S4eb7QiJaa	Guys will have sex with anyone.  They don't need to have feelings for you.|`|3Fu1DkvZaa	Some guys feel that they need to "put a notch under their belt" before they get married. Why, I have no idea...Men are pigs. The ones that say they are not in it for sex still have sex in the back of their minds.. or they're gay and could care less (You said you wanted the truth right).<br>  because men like it...men want it...<br>  <br>  they like us wearing heels even if they ruin our feet and posture...they want our boobs to be big and pop out at them...they want us wrinkle free, fat free, and grey free...so what do women do...they give the men what they want...the pressure is on, everyone is getting plastic surgery or Botox these days (even men) to try to please others and be the ideal person that will attract the opposite sex.....why? because no matter how intelligent we are, how honest and caring, loving and kind...most men will pass us up for a hotter chick who is thinner, and with bigger boobs, any chance they get...<br>  <br>  so you tell me who is in control??? <br>  <br>  yes, women can pretty much get sex any time they want...men can do, if they honestly wanted to...they can go on adult sites where women are on looking for hook ups, just like the men...its really not that difficult these days for either gender to find sex, and for the record, I've never cheated and would not tolerate cheating...and I've never colored my hair to cover my grey!!|`|6oSm5Qxzaa	I would say that he is interested in having sex with you. I would be careful though because you already told him how you felt and that you were actually interested in him and he said he didn't feel the same way. Sounds like he wants to be friends with benefits and if you aren't into that then just be up front and straight with him. Tell him that he making comments like that is confusing and it either needs to be strictly friends or more, not in the middle. He could just want you to hang along and not get over him without him having to make the commitment, so be careful.|`|oJV3rvsRaa	Well the guy knows your interested, and thinks he can hook up with you. IF hes not interested, he doesnt want a relationship.

It took me ages to be able to even look at him with out wanting to shout at the top of my voice, but in the end I did get over it, and before he left the company, I was even able to speak to him in a friendlyish way.  It really did just take time to get over it, the same as would any other breakup.<br>  <br>  I hope it works out ok for you.

FPITkq7yaa	This is a horrible, toxic relationship, but unfortunately unless your mother sees this for herself, you are unlikely to make her break it off. She obviously has confidence issues. Try talking to her about how she felt before this man. Was she more confident, happier etc..,Ask her how she feels now, without talking about him directly. By saying anything about him, you may make her feel like she has to defend him. If you are able, a good counsellor may help your mother enormously. Best of luck x|`|f5FmJRfIaa	Yes.

Take the time you have together to let her know how you feel and how much she means to you. Get also your siblings to do the same.

I wouldnt even be having sex with him in the first place if I didnt trust him completely and vice versa. Otherwise it just sounds like a friends with benefits relationship.<br>  As far as the thing with the ex's.. its very fishy. If the relationship was terrible why the need for contact? And your guy is initiating this?!?...I wouldnt tolerate it for much longer. Either you talk to him and get him to see eye to eye with you or else you find someone who places trust on the same pedestal as you! This isnt going to work if things continue and its not very fair to you on his behalf. No one respects a doormat!|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	Trust is more important.

If you can't trust him how can you expect to continue the relationship. And if he thinks that sex is the most important thing then he's not into you emotionally only physically.

Cause & Effect ... nothing complicated about it.<br>  <br>  let him know what the deal really is.  if he can't stop the dumbshit he's been doing, & start acting right, then he doesn't deserve you (personally, I believe you can do much better then him).|`|yb7DffnJaa	"He believes sex is more important" You've got to be kidding me! What a  convenient belief system he has....<br>  <br>  How do you know he hasn't cheated? He looks to me like he is trying to keep all avenues wide open (keeping one's options open isn't a good sign)<br>  <br>  You are the one who is allowing him to get away with this. Nobody will do more than necessary to acquire something. Example : if you walk into Macy's and you see a really beautiful sweater for $29.00, are you going to scream when you get to the register that it is under priced and you want to pay $99.00 ??  No, I don't think so. You will get the sweater as cheaply as possible, right. You would not ever, and I mean NEVER offer more than necessary would you?<br>  Neither will he. I'd let him know that I didn't like what he was doing and if he didn't stop in a nano second, I'd be gone before he could blink. Oh, and I would not be wasting my time texting him as he sat there cluelessly with his next gf.|`|I7OZ4glFaa	sex is not everything thats why its bad to have sex in a relationship instead of being married because having sex non married and he got ex girlfriends not thinking about you he gonna fall out of love with you...soon just act crazy and ask you all for sex and the ex's is bad i dont think he cheating but he working up to it cause he might not like what he get|`|AA12117694	trust is key...I would break up with the guy, although it does depend too...some guys just like to keep their ex's as friends because they dont want no hard feelings.

(:|`|0FIrxSCdaa	If he thinks that sex is more important then you pretty much should have an idea of what kind of guy he is and you should ask yourself where this relationship is gonna end up down the line.  If he believes sex is more important then you know what he is using you for.  Sex isn't love and it sounds like he puts a front to you one way but then does something completely different. There is a reason why you aren't trusting him, use your intuition and it should lead you to the right answer though. He doesn't sound right for you, you should move on and find a guy that loves you for who you are and not what you can do to him.|`|6oSm5Qxzaa	trust is definitely the most important thing in a relationship. If you can't trust him then you will go crazy. It seems weird that he is keeping in that much contact with his ex's, unless they are just friends. If he is telling you about all of his contact then I wouldn't worry about it too much but if he is hiding it from you or meeting her behind your back then you probably have something to worry about. You definitely need to figure out if you can trust him or not. If you don't trust him then you should get out of the relationship and if you do then you should stop worrying about everything and just have a good time in the relationship. Don't have sex with him just because he wants it, you should want to do it also. It's not anything that you ever owe him, it should be a mutual enjoyment.|`|AA11513781	First of all you need to stop him from talking to his ex. I made my boyfriend stop talking to his ex's. I don't care how much you wanna check up on them, they are the past. Now that he is with you he needs to change his number. Stop making phone calls at night, stop texting ex's and show you some respect. Because if it was vice versa he would not want you even speaking to a male co-workers. one thing i know about guys is that once they have a female they think they can do anything they want. No! it don't work that way. To answer your question: Trust is the most important issue in a relationship because if you don't have trust then you don't have anything. How can you wanna have sex with someone you don't trust. Girl, let me tell you from experience, stop all those things he is doing if not its gonna get worst.|`|hizUz9rDaa	well ive been in this situation. i didnt give him the attention he wanted so he cheated on me. it was horrible i got back with him. then i was the most unhappy person in the world during that time. so i ended it completely. he came back crying to me and everything. since you already tried talking to him and it didnt work then... make yourself happy. possibly threaten to end it with him and that will make him realize that he could lose you. to me... it seems like these days if your not having sex it wont work out. but know that isnt true.|`|sXkTRcx8aa	Of course trust is the most important. You dont like him to still contact to his ex, right. And everything can happen become worse when it's started from the small thing / small action, such as: send/receive text, call once in a while etc...  if it's done routinely.. nobody can guarantee the next action they are going to do. So discuss with him what you don't like and hmmm sex before marriage will bear consuquances.... Dont worry about him to leave you because of you discuss the matter, if he does, so it means that he is not the right man for you. God bless you.|`|tmIEl0upaa	I truly believe a woman cannot even hav great sex unless she totally trusts the man shes w/. pls move on before he gets u pregnant or sumthn!|`|xVMPH7Bbaa	Sounds like we have a real pickle here. Tell me, dearie, how old are you two? <br>  <br>  To answer your question, Trust is key. That is true. Sex is a big part of a relationship, but not in that of a need, but a want. Sex is a holder, which can make or break any relationship. <br>  <br>  A true man would not contact any of his ex's, but focus on you and your needs. <br>  <br>  If sex is a big deal for him, he is not looking for a woman to spend his life with, he looking for a girl who is willing to spread her legs and drop to her knees and stick a rubber up her ***. Don't give in to his demands. If he wants sex, tell him no. If he persist, close your legs. If he still tries, buy a chastity belt. you could also go to the measure of castrating him, but that seems a bit on the cruel side. <br>  <br>  There's a smile. Doesn't it feel good to smile every once in a while?<br>  <br>  Find you a man who doesn't want sex, but wants to make you smile, and who wants to be with you and focuses his entire attention on you and only you.|`|kQgSi1MEaa	Um, wake up and smell the coffee.

GrTU1Vqmaa	Take her for a walk and just talk. Listen and hold her hand. Girls like simple stuff. It's cute. And, since it's winter, if you live someplace cold, walking by a frozen late can still be sweet. Tell her you'll catch her if she slips and talk about whatever she wants to. Listen too! If you end up getting intimate kiss her neck and whisper to her. Just show your sensitive time. If you're not a walk-loving person have a movie night at your house and cook her favorite things. Eat popcorn and watch whatever she wants, no matter how dorky or girly. Either that or take her out to her favorite restaurant or for a picnic with her favorite foods. Chocolate and candles are always good. <br>  <br>  The best way to be romantic is show her your there for her and you can protect her, without being macho. Be sensitive and let her know you've been listening to what she says. Let you know you're having a great time being with her and you appreciate her.

Whilst offering him shelter you are seeing to it that this erstwhile useless drain upon society is learning the honest trade of the Professional Circus Fool.

Otherwise, why aren't they busy in the factories, manufacturing things for me to drink, smoke, or shoot at.  What could be morally wrong with giving the idle something to keep their feeble minds occupied, such as a round or three of Piggyback Jousting?<br>  No, by Jasper, I won't hear of it!

This is not only more humane, it'll make him sweat bullets if it does not come out.  That, in itself, is 10 times more entertaining.<br>  <br>  Stilts, up the stairs?  Com'on, now, you know the money is at down the stairs!  Make sure you pour out a pile of broken glass at the bottom of the stairs.  This way, you will keep him focused.|`|grTFRJVjaa	um well gee thanks for calling me common<br>  but yes i do think it was a bit harsh but he could have left at anytime. i think that the reason that he went through with it was because he had a place he could call home, and was fighting to stay there. with that said i dont think that your actions were wrong because you did not physically make him do it, you had the idea and he went through with it.|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	Well my good man, I would certainly compare the harshness of the outside world with that in which you've given him.

A-huh a-huh a-huh.<br>  <br>  You might do well to put this tramp to work. Allow him to do chores for you, if you think he might be worthy of such. It couldn't hurt to have another servant in the house, though I'm sure you could figure something out. Ahuh... ahuh.|`|kzE5eMYcaa	I would say yes.

2YX18RE2aa	Funny, I'd wager that it would be the exact same people who do not think withholding is a reason for divorce who also think that withholding is okay to get your own agenda going.<br>  <br>  In marriage, <br>  sexuality = intimacy<br>  Relationships require intimacy<br>  Therefore, no sexuality, no relationship<br>  no relationship = no marriage.<br>  <br>  Simple logic.|`|FeEU1IDOaa	Withholding sex with the intention of hurting someone's feelings or making them feel bad (like saying "I won't have sex with you until you lose some weight or get a boob job") could be considered emotional abuse, I suppose. <br>  <br>  If someone is withholding sex from you to get their way about something, then it's just immature. <br>  <br>  If someone has a problem becoming aroused or an erectile dysfunction, then that person should see a doctor to get the problem straightened out, and the partner should be patient, supportive and loving through it.|`|15e58edf21f33dd475298413b3cd6d8caa	don't argue then expect sex, there must be peace & love  & satisfying each others needs whatever these r.|`|39e9235b89c9b80c32eb4b4082db80ccaa	not directly.  however, it might lead to self-abuse, if you know what i'm talking about.|`|S4eb7QiJaa	It's more complicated than that.  Guys see sex as a necessity, like breathing.  If there's a problem, if you had a fight, they see sex as the way to fix it.  Women see sex as a reward.  It comes when everything is just right, when the house is clean, the chores are done, they feel nice and attractive and appreciated, and want to be closer.  If you want more sex, show more appreciation for your wife's needs.  Demanding sex without meeting her needs is abuse.|`|58gmJ58vaa	I think it is just rude and inconsiderate. Why would you want to punish yourself as well. WE need human touch it is healing. Don't ruin your relationship. People who say it won't are just in a fantasy world. The reality of it is if he or she isn't being fulfilled by you someone else will fill your place.|`|jRZmU5JUaa	I don't think that's Abuse its not causing anyone harm. Girls have fingers and Guys have hands. Put them to work or go buy a toy.  Plus Sex isn't everything. Usually if there are other issues that cause a crappy sex life.|`|VT2vPEsraa	sex is not d only reason 4 divorce <br>  sometimes 1 is involved in lot of physical activities <br>  or sometimes not at all due 2 shyness|`|Wj212FWXaa	no. its called strategy.|`|UdU7E5MIaa	I think it's a form of emotional abuse.|`|bO2rzfISaa	I don't think it's abuse. Really it's just short-sighted and stupid. <br>  <br>  Some women love sex, too, it's not just men. My husband knows that if he were ever short-sighted and stupid, our marriage wouldn't last long. I won't live without sex. <br>  <br>  It's ridiculous to say that divorce should only be in cases of abuse. In the case of no-fault divorce, you can leave for your own reasons. If you want to stay for anything but abuse, that's your prerogative. Don't expect others, who actually have an expectation of marital happiness, to accept that standard.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	No.  The words "abuse" and "neglect" are not synonyms, even though they do share certain characteristics in common.  Withholding sex is neglect, not abuse.
T20lVPDkaa	I've been in this situation and trust me.<br>  as long as you keep putting on that show and really letting her know she hurt you, she'll come running back. Show no affection.|`|RikCftYKaa	well... experienced, as this has happened to me, i say that you should just confront her about it. and TELL her what is wrong and that you really didn't like what she did (whatever it was). stop beating around the bush about it. trust me it is always better to confront the problem instead of either ignoring it or in this case (what i think is worse) is that you are punishing her for something that she might not understand what she is getting the cold shoulder for.<br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|5rp819JVaa	I think you got the message through to her i suggest you call her and talk to her about whatever she did and tell her that whatever she did wasn't nice and also say to her you can't treat people how you feel she will understand|`|qkyzbkHdaa	Ever heard of just telling her what's wrong? Keyword is COMMUNICATION buddy. If you keep this up she's going to get tired of the way you are treating her and just leave you...I wouldn't blame her either.

If you continue to ignore her then she will just get frustrated and then you guys will have more problems than before. You need to just talk to her about the incident and why it made you mad and that she shouldn't do it again and then move on. She isn't three years old and deserves punishment, she is your partner and you should be mature and just talk to her about it.|`|96Frq9uUaa	i wouldn't hold out any longer. if you just avoid her, and never express what she did that upset you, then you wont be able to work it out. next time, instead of punishing her, tell her right away so you can resolve the issue and then move on.|`|uFJdh913aa	Depends on what she did first of all.

But you should just grow up and call her, tell her how you feel, and if you guys cant work it out then maybe you two just aren't that right for each other anymore..<br>  And no its all not on you... she shouldn't be treating you so poorly.. but its way easier to just be the bigger person and confront her about the way shes acting other then just waiting around for something to happen..<br>  She may not even know that whatever she did hurt you..

Not to be rude, but if my boyfriend did that to me I would be gone.<br>  <br>  If you can't accept an apology (assuming she tried) then you are being stubborn.

oR40n3kPaa	Ask you mom to at least take you to her grave after the burial or for the burial.  At that time you can take the time to have your time with her.

It happens all the time; The abusing husband beats the hellll out of his wife then cuddles with her and makes it seem like SHE could have done things differently so that he would not have had to hit her.  The classic abuse scenario.  Tell your parents to talk to this woman and see if they can make a difference.  The victim must have low self esteem and feels that she can't get anyone that will treat her better.  But, someone needs to try to convince her that her husband needs psychological help.  He probably was abused as a child and is now PASSING IT ON like all abused people do whether they are conscious of it or not.  If no one interferes or if everyone looks the other way, he might accidently kill this woman when someone could have helped stop the procession of it from happening.  You follow me?|`|WvOvoxLxaa	The next time she comes to your house, you call the police and tell them what is going on. They will take care of him.  If she wants to stay with him she needs to stop involving your family in her problems.  She should have him kicked out of the house and get a restraining order so he can't come around her.  If the cops come and find her with marks on her they will put him in jail.  Maybe you need to be her backbone for the first time.|`|uNJirnYoaa	its not your problem, its hers.  if she doesn't want to stand up for herself or take the necessary steps forward to put him behind bars then she has to accept that she is going to get beaten.  <br>  <br>  One thing i cannot stand is when people are in bad situations and say they want out yet they never do what is necessary to free themselves and start anew.  If your friends mom wants a better life, she needs to pick up the phone, call the police, and go stay at a hotel until he is behind bars and file a restraining order against him.|`|ZzjUHawhaa	becuz he is a coward and he won't hit a real man. the wife should call the police and or get someone to kick his ***. Not to mention the wife needs to get out of that marriage before she gets killed. no real man hits a woman.<br>  <br>  there is nothing you can do. she will run away when she gets tired of him hitting her. she's not tired yet. she has to figure that out on her own.<br>  <br>  she can always pour some hot grits or boiling water or boiling cooking grease on his sorry ***. <br>  <br>  i would!!!!|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Phone the police, don't listen to anyone who says its not your problem. It may not be but its your responsibility as a moral human being to call someone to protect her if she can't do it for herself, if that was your mother in her shoes I'm sure that's what you'd like someone else to do.|`|ZPTmbQW4aa	After being beat like a dog by MY husband for 8 years I finally had the guts to leave the jerk after he put a loaded gun to my head.... I called the police and had him locked up.....<br>  <br>  My point here is UNTIL I got tired of his bs there was nothing ANYONE could say or do to stop me from being with him or from me going BACK to him AFTER he had beat me.... It wasnt UNTIL I almost DIED that I realized he was NOT worth dying over and I left...<br>  <br>  What you CAN do though since she DOES come running to your house for help... YOU CAN call the police and when the dad comes to look for her he can be arrested.... This is madness... But I promise you one thing UNTIL she gets tired of getting her azz beat she will KEEP running back to him NO matter HOW many times you call the police or he goes to jail... SHE has to get tired and say enough is enough,,,,<br>  All you can do is be there for her like you have been and if she WONT leave then you need to set some rules and let her know as long as she is going to STAY with him then she is NOT allowed to come running to your house for protection.... when he starts beating her... YOU are enableing her to stay as long as you give her that safety net.. So you have to stop her from running to your house everytime he wants to act a fool and beat on her.... Maybe then she will see that what he is doing is NOT ok and she WILL leave....<br>  <br>  But all you can do for a woman like that is PRAY for her.. Pray that she comes to her senses and leave the coward before he KILLS her and that is the GODS honest truth... Because NOTHING pisses the abuser off more than calling the police or running away and he have to come looking for you so GOD forbid that one day she run down to your house and your family is there at home when he comes looking for HER and your family becomes a VICTIM of his abuse and it could very well HAPPEN you know so think about that too.. Is YOUR life worth Her STUPIDITY  or HIS cowardness.... If the answer is NO then you need to put your foot down and let her know that she is NOT allowed to bring her DRAMA and STRESS to your house anymore and she is NOT allowed to run to down to your house when he attacks her.....<br>  <br>  You can NOT help anyone who DOES NOT WANT to help THEMSELVES.....<br>  Stay strong and God Bless you|`|MYU46ap5aa	To be honest there's not much you can do if the mother doesn't want to get help.  <br>  <br>  If he ever abuses your friend call child services.|`|eeCoeMZsaa	mind your business<br>  you can cause that lady even more drama<br>  she will get the strength on her on or with adult intervention to do the right thing sooner or later hopefully sooner

Even though you said you can't see breaking up with your girlfriend it's not fair to either one of you if you feel the need to see other people. You need to talk to your girlfriend and tell her how you feel. And if you all can't work it out then your probably going to have to find another roommate. You need to get this out of your system, seeing other people while your still in a relationship is a disaster waiting to happen unless you both what an open relationship. Or maybe you and your girlfriend need to have more variety in your relationship and spice it up abit. My ex husband wanted to be with me yet date other people, didn't work at least for me. Even though you need to enjoy life while your still young and without to much responsibility. Sometime even though we want certain things they just weren't meant to be. Good luck.|`|bNuuxJv1aa	Well it is ok for you to see other girls as long as you are not flirting or anything else with them but you can be friends with them.

Tell him how much you love candles and flowers or whatever you find romantic.  You will need to basically tell him bluntly for him to get it.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	You can't change a man and make him romantic or spontaneous.  He tells you he loves you every day--why isn't that enough??  <br>  <br>  You can be the one to be romantic and spontaneous.  My husband and I know we love each other by the way we treat each other every single day.  Honestly, the fact that he makes me dinner when he has a day off and I work and he cleans when I'm too busy to do it makes me feel so loved and amazing!  I don't need flowers and candy and silly things like that for me to feel good about myself and our marriage.  The fact that he's an amazing husband and treats me with respect and love EVERY DAY is enough for me.<br>  <br>  If you think you need the romance and surprises and gifts and spontaneity that you see in the movies in order to be happy, I'd suggest you stop renting romantic comedies and realize that the little things he does for you every day that you don't notice speak far louder than roses and candles ever could.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	was he ever romantic?  probably not.  then, you'll have to initiate much of the 'romance'.  take pride and fun in the things that you come up with...eventually, he'll catch on and learn from you.  peace|`|GTeGDGzKaa	Good luck... men need direction.. that is why they get married<br>  <br>  SteveC|`|uXdx9vuBaa	sorry to say that if he isnt a true romantic at heart, he will never change. Just accept the way he is b/c he wont have a clue what bieng romantic is. Just keep telling him what you like or you can make him a list of things that are romantic and tell him to keep it and look at it every week or month.  eventually, he may learn to do it all on his own.  My man isnt romatic at all.  But i love him to death b/c he is loyal and caring and kind.  I used to have boyfriends in the past that were very romantic and awesome in bed but they turned out to be jerks.  I'd rather have a simple old fashioned guy with good morals anyday. Trust me on this one. Boring is good!|`|naequcqlaa	You play the game of "show & tell"..!!  If you let him know what pleases you, then he'll get the message loud & clear.  If you keep it to yourself, he'll never know because just maybe his crystal ball is broken & then he'd have NO way of knowing.  Hands on is the very best way I've found to work...Good luck...:)|`|6GHtXQzTaa	You need to take the lead and set the stage for romance. But don't get your hopes up, things don't tend to go the way you have them in your head.<br>  <br>  Try sending him flower's to work.|`|mxNdwKlBaa	you can leave small note around the house with sensual ideas on them or just tell him if he really loves you then he'll want to please you and he'll be happy to do anything and everything|`|cGGvZqJNaa	Your problem is very common among married men. My wife tells me the same thing...It is hard to be romantic the longer you are married. At least I try.|`|1Y0yPiSvaa	When you figure this out please let me know because I have been trying for almost 13 years. Believe me when I say I have tried everything!
qT9PULiKaa	You're fine, you know your friend is wrong...your friend is welcome to his/her own opion, you know you dont have to share it.  And your friend should know that too.|`|d503428496b7275f70c66859957bdd07aa	I think your friend lives in Lala land and really is the dysfunctional one. Not all of us have a great family live. I admire you for the decisions you and your parents made. I know it was not easy for your parents to cut themselves off from their parents and siblings but they realized that this is what they had to do to break the cycle. They really must have loved their children to make such a decision. <br>  Don't listen to your friend. She does not know any better since she obviously led a very sheltered life. These people have no idea what it is like. Suggest to her to volunteer for child abuse agencies, shelters, drug rehab etc in your area. It will be quite a learning experience and she just might realize how lucky she is to have a family rather than take it for granted.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Nothing at all.<br>  <br>  You could suggest your friend read up on the word 'dysfunctional'- at the very least, if they're going to use it, they should know that it applies to families and relationships, not individuals.<br>  <br>  In short, a gentle way of telling them they don't know what they're talking about.  That's the best I can come up with, sorry.|`|3Les3n24aa	tl;dr.|`|eTBfsjCUaa	Nothing is wrong with that.<br>  I myself don't talk to certain members of my family.<br>  Just hold your tongue about issues relatiing to your family around this friend. <br>  But remember honey, your Mom and Dad aren't always going to be here and you said they worked hard to give you a good home growing up, so maybe you should stop being so stubborn and spend some time with them before it is too late.
3gljWitCaa	oh heavens no!!<br>  didnt you hear??<br>  you're eyes will fall out!<br>  <br>  true story, it happened to a friend of a friend of a friend of my sisters friend!<br>  <br>  bewareeee!<br>  :)|`|kUE3Ddktaa	I would guess that most brides see their grooms in their suits before the wedding - because they help pick it out or because all suits basically look alike.<br>  <br>  It's all just superstition anyway, so who really cares?|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	Yes, she usually picks it out to be honest. That is just dumb about the dress too. My fiance helped me pick out my dress. He is the only one i care about if he likes it, everyone else can complain to themselves if they dont. The divorce rates are so high it is probably not letting him see the dress that is bad luck haha.|`|4ec7418aca20a0d4c9b979bf6a9d4d4eaa	I'm a bridal consultant, and usually the bride is the one picking out his suit...LOL  Guys just want to know the following about their wedding:<br>  1.  Where is it?<br>  2.  What date and time do I have to be there?<br>  3.  What do I have to wear?<br>  4.  What are we going to eat?<br>  5.  How much does it cost?<br>  <br>  Those details aren't necessarily in the order of the guys importance either...LOL|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	LOL, are you kidding?  Most of the time, the bride is the one who picks out the groom's tux in the first place!|`|P1bO87l1aa	My wife help me pick out my suit and I helped her pick her wedding gown.  I know superstition says that bad luck but we have been happily married for over 33 years.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Yes. Yes. Yes. She often helps pick it out.|`|sLLgERQWaa	yes, often the groom's suit or tux is co-ordinated to match or compliment the groom's men's & the bride's maids outfits and the bride can't do this blind, lol....and there is no such tradition re: bad luck with the bride seeing what the groom wears....good luck.|`|9XlQdh2Aaa	Yes of course!! The bride should always pick out the tux... who knows what a guy would pick for himself. It could be horrific!|`|AkUhaMm9aa	oh yea thats is not a big deal..most brides want to see it just to make sure its fits.|`|YWpmZ7Opaa	Its fine for the sirl to see the guy, she usually helps pick it|`|2ignHUkxaa	you can def see guys suits. im getting married and i picked out my mans suit and the grooms. i wouldnt trust him to pick his own. hope it helps|`|PqdYPmzwaa	only if its a gay wedding|`|jBjc1UACaa	i saw my husbands suit before the wedding....but then again he saw me also....we had to take pics =)
oRPvkExwaa	First off, forget about the guy. It sounds as if he has plenty of opportunities to talk to you, and isn't taking the initiative, even after your night at the club, where it sounds as if you made it clear how you feel. Maybe in the future, you should slow things down a little and make sure you're comfortable speaking to them. <br>  <br>  As far as body language, just be open, don't fold your arms across your front, look people in the eyes, smile. If you aren't comfortable striking up a conversation, join in one that's already going. I've found the best way to get people talking is to compliment them, but genuine ones. It warms people to you, and gets the ball rolling, because for all you know, they're afraid to talk to you too.
m2PywmHBaa	just tlk to him and then tell him that you lyk him and you wanna be more then friends and then if sumthing would happen and u break up or he says no u guys should still be good friends bcuz u already are. =)|`|kG9oI68eaa	When you fall in love with them|`|dksB1B0Laa	Like after a month into the relationship|`|oR40n3kPaa	There will never be the 'right' time.  YOu just have to do it.  If you are true friends and the other person doesn't feel the same way, then you will be able to work through the ackwardness.  If he/she feels the same way then you can begin to work on a relationship.  Remember the sooner you do it the better.|`|8S1vEESYaa	You should tell them when you are sure that you love them...if you are confused then you probably don't really love them.|`|1aa144095adebf42cce12852a93fd34caa	When you love them.|`|XTLN8D2Qaa	when you stop hating them
eO4y3m1maa	As much as she doesnt want to tell her mom she REALLY REALLY needs to or tell someone at school before something bad happens,<br>  <br>  My friend had a guy at her work start to like her, she gave him her number to use him for a ride to work (he was twice he age!) and he started showing up at her house late at night ...one night he tried to sneak into her room while she was sleeping.<br>  <br>  Her Dad heard it thank god and called the cops..<br>  <br>  <br>  but imagine what could have happened?<br>  <br>  SO pleeeease do something before it gets worse!|`|oIFMohfUaa	YOU need to be a friend and tell her parents!  YOU could save her life!  She is afraid to tell, so you have to be a bigger person!<br>  <br>  If you can't tell hers, tell your own parents!  Let them help your friend...with you!!!!  YOU MUST TELL!<br>  <br>  How will you feel if you don't and something horrible happens???  Then you'll have to tell her parents that you knew!  Then you will have to live with yourself, even if you didn't tell you knew, and living with guilt is terrible!  It will destroy you!  <br>  <br>  Your friend might be mad...at first...but she will get over it!   <br>  <br>  Can YOU look at yourself in the mirror and feel good if something happens to your friend?  If he's already been to the house, he's too close and too real!  Use your gut instinct...it's there for a reason!!!!!!|`|CqoTqEu6aa	You need to tell her parents AND the police! A it is something her parents need to be aware of she should not be left alone, someone needs to escort her to school and home from school and stay with her while she is at home. One of my friends was stalked in high school and one day the man followed her home in his car! he got really close to her and opened the door of his car, she ran before he could grab her but he was trying to pull her in. She was lucky she knocked on a door to a house in the street and a nice woman was at home who let her in and they called the police. The thing was this man had followed my friend home from school more then ten times before - she had noticed but not done anything about it- he was just waiting for a chance to kidnap her! <br>  <br>  this is really serious if your friend wont tell her parents you must and advise them to call the police stalking is illegal and they will help protect your friend.|`|VAwYqgEQaa	How does he really talk to her?  Like a creepy, scary movie way? <br>  You have to tell the police.,<br>  Better yet, tell ur mom. She being your mom should have a better idea.|`|dXRrxxrFaa	Tell your parents or hers.<br>  My friend got stocked too, once we told her parents everything got dealt with.<br>  Hope I can help.|`|yQCg9Kemaa	Call the cops.. they will track him down !!|`|pgUfi7XMaa	OK, you definitely have to tell someone. If you think you both can solve this without doing something, then that is a completely "misunderstanding". Maybe ask help from  YOUR parents, or some teacher or principal -- someone whom you trust.... because that is VERY creepy and you need "older" advice|`|kvN1w0j3aa	While you might not think this will turn into anything horrible, you have to treat the situation as if something can happen...because it can. Talk to your mom so she can maybe call your friends mom...This way you aren't going directly to her mother yourself.|`|BCNsuqgRaa	First tell her mom, that is a good idea. If she is ever alone at home, call and check up on her, but more importantly have her mom tell the cops.|`|hKAcqNvNaa	you have to tell this chicks mom she needs to know what if something happen and her mom has no idea who to look for and she needs to get in contact with it police and get a restraining order agent him|`|6V7HjW3Baa	Either you or your friend should tell someone.  One good idea would be the police liaison of your high school.|`|J9jb56L2aa	Hire a hitman and hide the friend in your celler and dont let him out feed him dry chereos
0PdYYeBFaa	Just lay in a nice tub of warm to hot water so that your bits cool off... Sorry to hear your in pain. I think that your sex game came as a shock to your bits so yes irritation is possible. But just sit in your tub until you feel like it is taking healing to it. <br>  <br>  REMEMBER THAT IN ORDER TO HEAL YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH PAIN. so take it easy...there may be some slight pain (be strong)...after a few more minutes of sitting in warm water you should be fine.|`|39e9235b89c9b80c32eb4b4082db80ccaa	you could have, but you didn't.  that skin simply is not used to being that cold, so naturally, there will be some irritation.  i promise you, though, you didn't get frostbite.  the ice would have melted too quickly for that to happen.<br>  <br>  take it easy on the bits for a few days, and if you still are having trouble, consult a doctor.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	OMG ROFLMAO ok i got it out of my system. I am sure people ask themselves this all the time but to see it in writing is funny. i dont think you can get frostbite down there, try taking a nice bath tonight to warm her back up. Props to you for spicing up your marriage!|`|nXSpS3Axaa	What kind of pleasure would you recieve by sticking ice cubes up your va J-J?<br>  <br>  Than again i'm not a woman, so I wouldn't know myself! lol|`|88bDvyiwaa	next time try an alka-seltzer.|`|eeCoeMZsaa	he didn't do it right|`|hgG9AaN2aa	I don't think so, my wife's has been like that for years!|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	I think it could be irritation due to the cold and then the intercourse that followed. Have to remmeber that it's super sensitive down there! Give it a day or two and you'll be fine. Don't wash yourself with hot wate rin the meantime but a low warm water|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Anything is possible. Put a heating pad on your tidbits and relax!
AA10690306	No, not until it is signed by the Clergy(Preacher, Priest, Pastor, Cleric) or official(Judge, Justice of the Peace) and two witnesses.  At least in the US.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	No, having a marriage license means you can now have a marriage ceremony performed, by a judge, pastor, or whomever in your state is permitted to do it.  Once the ceremony is compelte, then the officiant will submit it to the county and they will send you a marriage certificate, that shows your name and spouses name, the date of the marriage, and the officiants name and what city/state the marriage took place in.|`|kbz5S3waaa	no, that means you have been approved for marriage...|`|kKSpHtDWaa	When you have the license signed it's official.  The ceremony is just to have some fun and invite people because who wants to watch you sign a certificate.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	No.  That means you have the right to be married.  You need to have it with  you when you DO get married and the officiant and 2 witnesses sign it.|`|pFs71HsHaa	It is not legal until after a ceremony when the judge or pastor and you and your spouse sign it. It is then registered with the court.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	no, it means you can do a test drive though ;-)|`|mJFgCvYlaa	Yes, a marriage license is like a binding contract to the government that you two are legally married, but only after an official signs it. The ceremony itself doesn't really bind you by any means, until you have someone officially who can perform the paperwork to declare you two are married. All you have to do, is go to the tax office or Dep. of revenue, fill out a form and fee, scheduled for a court marriage and then show up to be declared married by a judge.<br>  <br>  You can also be declared as married by living together for a period of time (depends on which State you're in).|`|krQiDGCHaa	No, it means that you are now able to become legally married to this person.<br>  <br>  In most states, your marriage license expires in 30-90 days, so you will need to use your marriage license fairly quickly once you get it.  Then, you need the person who married you (Priest, Justice of the Peace, etc) to sign it, plus a witness.  Then, you send it back to the city hall and you will be able to pick up a copy of your marriage CERTIFCATE (which proves you ARE marred) within a couple of weeks.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	A marriage license only means that you will be legally married by someone who is licensed to perform the marriage ceremony.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	No, now you have to go and get married. A marriage license is required to get married.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	No, it's just a license to get married. It's like the government saying, okay now you are allowed to get married.|`|ooT1Gj2Xaa	No, it allows you the ability to get legally married.|`|b36106fca96cf87563f99284c771ece2aa	Repent, and ye shall be saved.....|`|UTb5chyJaa	yes, technically even if theres no ceremony or white dress and cake, if you have a marriage license, you are legally married. me and my husband had a courthouse wedding, no dress or nothing, just a license, but we are legally married, maybe to some people were not in the eyes of GOD, but legally and to us we are.|`|VLRZT9Foaa	No, it means that you are eligable to become married within 30 days of the time the license was issued.<br>  <br>  If a ceremony hasn't been performed, and the license hasn't been signed by the minister, bride, and groom, then you aren't legally married.|`|5hYIwDGvaa	No, that just means you are legally able to be married. Besides the marriage certificate, there are certain words that need to be said by an officiant and in front of the witnesses and bride/groom in order for it to be legal.|`|72MtoWxRaa	No. It means that now you are licensed and able to get married. It is only good for 60 days, then it expires and you have to get another one. You are married once yu both say I DO and sign the marriage certificate...|`|1fjhg6j4aa	No, the marriage certificate signed by the person who officiated, two witnesses, and the bride and groom is what means you're married.  The license means you have permission to get married.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Nope not at all. Its only a license that allows you to get legally married wherever you want within that state, in a ceremony of your choosing.|`|agLImxKTaa	No.  A marriage license is saying you intend to get married.  You have to take vows and have it signed.  Then it becomes a Marriage Certificate.  This means you're married.|`|LhJl2KcRaa	No, it is just a pre requisite for marriage. when you have the certificate you ahve the right to be married and make your vows legal and binding.|`|975415025988bc1fb1841f77aa985c36aa	No, you aren't married just because you got a license. It needs to be signed and recorded by the appropriate authority after the vows have been made.|`|aNIBxQ82aa	NO|`|1x6fJmoaaa	no
2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	Since you and your fiance already have a date in mind, go ahead and announce it.  It sounds like your sis and her fiance have done a lot less thinking and pre-planning than you and your fiance have.  Go ahead and set your date for Oct. 2010, and then she'll just have to work around it.  Also, please don't think that just because she's younger than you, has a fiance your parents like less, and is 7 months pregnant, that means you're the more important bride-to-be by default.  You both have the right to have your day in the spotlight, regardless of how your family may feel about each of your fiances.  I hope you don't take that superior attitude into your planning process with you, or you will really end up hurting your sis's feelings.  She has the right to live her life as she sees fit, and even though you and your family may not feel like her fiance and her situation is ideal, to her it is still the real deal and she is excited.  <br>  <br>  As for worrying about your family having to pay for 2 weddings in one year, here's a novel idea- why don't you and your sister and your respective fiances plan weddings you can afford comfortably by yourselves rather than rely on your parents to pay for them?  Anyone who is enough of an adult to get married presumably has a reasonable-paying job and is capable of opening a savings account.  If you start now and save maybe $200 a month for the wedding, by October 2010, you will have approximately $3800 to put towards your wedding, and then your parents will be happy to contribute as much as they can toward the rest.  If your sister and her fiance do the same, your parents will be able to afford to give them some money toward their wedding as well, and you can both get married in the same year without any drama.  Talk it over with your fiance and see if that maybe sounds like a good plan.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	just do your own thing and assume you have to pay for the whole thing.  maybe your parents will surprise you and give you a big check to help you out but don't get your hopes up.  the only way for you to stay positive about this is to plan your own wedding with no regard to anyone else's.  and pay for it on your own, that way you're not in competition with your sister for who is getting the most money from your parents.  just think of all the thousands of people all over the world who are getting married on the same date as you and your sister too.  no one has a monopoly on one day to get married.  it's a shame your sister has picked a month and year so close to 10/10 but like you said, it may not last that long.  it doesn't sound like she'll end up married IMHO.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Traditionally, when two sisters get engaged about the same time, the older one is the first one to be married.<br>  <br>  Your sister sounds like an immature, competitive twit.  I agree with whomever said they probably won't last that long.<br>  <br>  Go on with your wedding plans.  Your parents are happy and excited about it.  <Warning:  Don't share any of your ideas with her, because she will copy you.  When she asks, just tell her "we haven't decided anything for sure yet."><br>  <br>  Happy Engagement!|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	you set your date, and appear to have the much stronger relationship.  so stand your ground honey, that is YOUR date.  if she keeps mucking about and not setting a date, thats her problem.  <br>  <br>  ps, god, what is with the buying her own ring thing? can you say "doomed relationship"? that poor child that isnt even born yet|`|29I8PWrxaa	I know plenty of sisters or brothers who have had weddings in the same year.  Just be happy for each other that you are both getting married ... whether you like your sister's fiance or not.  It doesn't matter who gets married first.  If you want your wedding before hers, then set a different date.  But it really shouldn't matter.  Two of my good friends are identical twin sisters whose fiances both proposed to them within a couple months of each other.  One of the couples got married within six months and the other took a little over a year to plan their wedding, so their weddings were the same year but different months.  To make matters even more complicated, both sisters had the same bridesmaids since they were all friends, so the bridesmaids were kept very busy too planning two weddings.  And on top of that, two of the brothers of my friends also had weddings within a year of them!  So believe me, that family was very busy for a couple years.  But every wedding got the attention it deserved, and everyone was happy for everyone else.  <br>  <br>  Just be happy for each other and plan your weddings for whatever date is best for you.  It's not a race!  And it doesn't matter who gets married first.  I'm sure your guests will come to both weddings rather than pick between them.  And it's possible that your sister's engagement won't make it to the wedding ... but is that what you want for your sister?<br>  <br>  I can't believe everyone is saying she is trying to "steal your thunder".  No one should get engaged because they want attention, and she probably didn't.  Plus, she got engaged first!  And even though she is younger, she is pregnant and probably wants to get married as soon as possible.  It doesn't matter if she bought her own ring and wasn't surprised.  The fact of the matter is, you are both getting married.  It's not a new concept.  No one is copying anyone.  And if your parents can't contribute a lot financially to the weddings, then pay for it yourselves.  That's what my fiance and I are doing.  My parents have their own bills to pay.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	your sister is a flakey twit. (your family is probably right, they won't make it to 2010 and if they do, then they may not last to the end of that year)<br>  <br>  just ignore her and plan your day.  <br>  <br>  There are more people in your family and your family's extended family than you and your sister.  there are only 365 days in a year and at any given time anyone in your family may have to make a choice between going to one wedding over another.  One year, between family and friends I had 17 weddings to which I was invited.<br>  <br>  Plan your day, don't worry about who can and can't make it. <br>  <br>  and if your sense of sibling rivalry just won't let you stand the idea of her getting married before you, then plan your wedding for late this year or before May 2010.  (I think it would be a waste, just keep planning for Oct 2010)|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Don't even deal with your sister.  She is hormonal and jealous of you naturally.  Go to your parents and let them know that you don't care if she marries first but would be really hurt if she plans her wedding right before yours.  Ask them to help give at least 6 months space.  Keep planning.  That is tacky that your sister who hasn't picked a date would consider it so close to yours.  Since your parents would be paying for it, they can sabatoge her for being so tacky by refusing to pay if she sets up the reception (which you need a downpayment) weeks before your wedding.<br>  <br>  Your sister being pregnant and wanting to marry after the baby should be focusing on the baby, not the wedding.|`|39e9235b89c9b80c32eb4b4082db80ccaa	stand your ground.  you're older, you've been together longer, and you've got a specific time picked out.<br>  <br>  your sister is trying to steal your thunder.  as the younger, she probably feels that you've gotten more attention over the years, and this is her opportunity to be in the spotlight.  <br>  <br>  she'll have her chance.  don't let her steal yours.|`|gKW1ufGbaa	Who cares what she is doing? Not to mention it's a shotgun wedding and will probably not be nearly as nice. They may not even stay together until then. Do what you want.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	why dont you start saving and pay for you own wedding instead of expecting your family to pay for it...you sound like a spoiled and jealous person to me...and seems like you resent your sister and hate her almost..Sorry but read your question and you will see it too..<br>  <br>  you should be understanding of her situation..and if shes pregnant and her bf just got a job..a big wedding shouldn't be a priority for them anyway..the baby and house should be N1. and should be a little supportive..dont make your wedding a competition event..|`|ELIKp5tDaa	eurgh, sounds like your sister is trying to 'steal your thunder'<br>  she might just be jealous that you have been in a stable and lasting relationship for three years..apparently sibling rivalry doesnt stop after highschool eh?<br>  maybe talk to your sister about it and ask why shes being a stinker?<br>  i say just keep planning and if your sister becomes bridezilla or bridesmaidzilla just, remarry in a nice private ceremony thats you, the hubby whoever is marrying you and a witness...<br>  im a little rotter and have a bit of a vengeful streak so if i had a sister doing that to me id probably bungle her plans as bad as she did mine LOL<br>  i got lucky though, my sister is 17 years younger|`|FtyBLEC7aa	Do not go to your parents complaining about her that is very immature. Its 2009 you should be paying for your own wedding if you've had 3 years to discuss what you want you've had three years too save for what you want. Don't dismiss your sisters engagement just because she hasn't had the textbook romance you have had. I sure her mind is more preoccupied with making plans for the birth of her baby at the moment.|`|sLLgERQWaa	Sweetie,<br>  Listen to your family &  continue with your plans AS IS.....never mind what Sis says, I guarantee no one is paying any attention to her nonsense anyway. Very immature IMO.<br>  <br>  It matters not when Sis plans on getting married, she doesn't have a date yet and her plans are too vague....get yours set as soon as possible and send out ' Save the Date' cards to solidify the day with your guests.<br>  <br>  So what if she marries the same year you do.....no bride owns the year they marry in, even within a family,just the day. So what if it's before yours....the last wedding is always the one folks talk about because it's freshest in their minds besides.......you can't force her to marry when it's 'convenient' for you anyway and vise-versa ( You're not the boss of me & my wedding applies here for BOTH of you) so go about your original business otherwise you will drive yourself into unnecessary stress. Good luck.|`|wVZuBL0Zaa	First have you talked to your parents about this? Find our what they think. If your sister has no clue when she is getting married then let her know the date you are getting married on, and go ahead and plan your wedding. Sounds like you are in a stable relationship and your sister is not so I would say go ahead and plan your wedding. As for your sisters nasty comment about your bf only asking you because she was proposed to is stupid. You know that isn't true and she is saying that because she wants all the attention focused on her and may be jealous of what you and your Fiance have. So I would say go along with your wedding!|`|2ignHUkxaa	if you picked your date first then your sister should wait. it seems like she wants to steal the lime light
JzTV8nS0aa	lol touchy subject....this guy sounds like a bigtime mooch, but shes right. you need to be direct. theres a child you're thinking of here.|`|eO4y3m1maa	You both should sit down and talk to him, ask him what his plan is ...set a deadline so he speeds up on his goals.|`|yQCg9Kemaa	talk to him directly.  Be brave and dont bother what he or ur husband will think if u r rude to him.  Let him know that he is a bad influence to ur child and ask him directly to move out.  Be bold !!
ohSqBO4Taa	You have every right to be angry.  He hurt your mom, thereby hurting the entire family.  Your dad is human tho' and make mistakes.  Have you tried talking to him about this?  Let him know how you feel.  Is the affair still going on?  Gaining someones trust takes a long time after something like this.  If you are having problems dealing with it and don't feel like talking to your mom and dad about it, then maybe talk to a counselor at school.  You shouldn't have to deal with this by yourself.  Good luck and I hope everything works out for you.|`|QvF7ZJibaa	hey... sorry to hear about that, but couples do fight, everybody argues and it has nothing to do with the children, sure you can be upset with him for hurting your mom like he did, but you cant hate him, hes your dad and he loves you and your sisters, no matter what him or your mom is going through<br>  hope this helps|`|61eLCih3aa	YES>  If anyone says NO then they are F***ed up.  He should be thinking about his entire faimly, including you, and think about what his actions can potentially cause|`|yuwjQjKqaa	No|`|R8bXuLbTaa	Yes, that is very hurtful. Its normal to feel this way but your sisters will be fine. <br>  <br>  My mom and dad divorced when I was 10 for similar reasons and I was actually happy with it because my home life was so much less stressful.<br>  <br>  After my mom and dad divorced they were actually able to become friends and it was the best thing for everyone involved.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should remind your mom that you are really only prepared to get a divorce if 1) you feel unsafe or 2) you can make the decision without being overly emotional because this means you are still in love and there is a chance of makin it work. <br>  <br>  You also have to remember, as hard as it may be, to respect and love your father anyway. Everyone makes mistakes and parents are not exempt. They can work on this and fix the problem. It will be hard though|`|X4JnjNQ2aa	It'll be hard for you, but i'm sure it's hard for them too.<br>  Just be there for both of them, and don't take sides, as you might not speak to your dad again. Be there for you mum and sisters, and ask your dad to sit you all down and explain what he and your mum are going to do.|`|BImAj5WIaa	Totally <br>  <br>  i know exactly how you feel my mum and dad split up but this happened when i was 3 but my mum and my step-dad split about a year ago and i thought that he was my real dad so yeah i kno how you feel|`|gfe5o4IZaa	Yes you should be..<br>  <br>  Your dad is having an affair and hes arguing back to your mom...<br>  <br>  If your dad was truly sorry then you shouldnt be mad because might of been a huge mistake..  But if hes not sorry then you have all the right to be mad at him..|`|g2ulTHNGaa	Sweetheart, he cheated on your whole family. Did the other woman know he was married?

FeEU1IDOaa	It sounds like she's more hurt that you don't want to spend time with HER than anything else, and is using the kids...well, I guess you've figured that part out! Maybe you should call her out on it. Tell her not to be accusing you of not loving the kids when she's the one using them to make you feel bad, breaking promises to them, and build them up about going somewhere only to let them down later, JUST because she can't let go of YOU. Tell her that if she still has feelings for you then she's only hurting the kids by using them as her pawns. That might embarrass her into stopping, because she obviously doesn't think you're on to her..<br>  <br>  Also, point out that it wouldn't kill her to check with you BEFORE she schedules these little outings, that way no one is disappointed. Remind her that you are getting divorced, and that your responsibility is to the KIDS, not in any way to her, and that you would be glad to spend time with THEM, but she can't expect you to drop everything just to spend time with HER.|`|j8aCEtg8aa	Get your b@lls out of her purse and stop letting her control you. Spend no time with her, and do fun things with your kids when it's your turn. And get yourself a girlfriend.|`|TTjDATeOaa	When you get a girlfriend, it will not look great to her that you are spending time with your ex wife. Spending time with your kids is good and appropriate, but there is a reason why you're divorcing her. Let her talk all the **** about you that she wants, your kids will see the truth, they aren't dumb.|`|aWgdX0pZaa	Man up and stand up to her. You are not 8 years old and she's not your MOMMY. You don't have to feel bad about anything, you are a grown man and you know what you are doing don't let her manipulate you.|`|AA10759085	She feels that if she can get you to go and do all these thing that you might decide to get back together with her. She seems to be dependent on you as a child herself in a way. She probably thinks she can not get into a real relationship because what man want a ready made family, she seems to have a low self esteem and until she can feel better about herself she will probably continue to act this way. It is ot very good for the children to be in this situation because they learn from what they see you and mom doing. <br>  You love your kids and continue to show them an do things with them and when she starts don't fight with her walk away tell your children I love you but Daddy cant go with you and if you need to tell them why. Then walk away from the situation before she can start the fight. If she says then we cant go because dad wont go tell your kids no it is ot because dad cant go it is because mommy just don't want to take you alone.|`|bsqYJ0suaa	First off, is this the reason your divorcing your wife? <br>  <br>  If this is the reason your divorcing your wife then its not a good reason.<br>  <br>  Second, do you still have love for your wife?<br>  <br>  If you still have love for your wife, you need to work it out not just leave when things are tough. When you got married, you made vows to her. Marriage nowadays is taken so lightly and when things get tough its always easier to just get up and go.<br>  <br>  This is not the way. <br>  <br>  She can do things on her own with the kids but she prefers to spend time as a family. What is wrong with that scenario. Picture this: You at the swimming pool with your wife and kids. Your not at work or at your other "commitments." Your there as a father and as a husband spending time, having fun with your family. Is this unheard of? Is this hounding you? I don't think so.<br>   <br>  In a relationship, there must be compromise. She must compromise with you and you must compromise with her. If you don't want to go all the time, pick days that you can go and work it out with her. You must express to her, calmly, that you cant go to every event but you will make an effort to go to some.<br>  <br>  Sir, don't take the easy way out. Be tough and try to make it work with your wife.
AA10835302	Its not your fault.  Arguments happen.  You can't control the fact that your boyfriend left in an angry tirade and didn't pay attention to what he was doing when he attempted to cross the street.  DON'T LAY THAT GUILT ON YOURSELF.  Instead, be there for him.  Forgive him for allowing that skank to kiss him and be angry with the right person which would be the skank.  Go to him, tell him you are sorry for the argument, and wait until he's all healed up before you let him know how seeing that girl kiss him hurt you.  Besides, if he's your guy, he shouldn't be allowing other girls to kiss him no matter how forceful they are.  He's a man, he's stronger, he can defend himself.|`|Akdsu4nFaa	O MY GOD  i feel like really bad for you! It is not your fault never think that|`|nCtJisCvaa	aww im so sorry 4 u but its not your fault !|`|Hk6wIgiOaa	Not ur fault on how people react, what if you did the same thing after seeing him kiss the girl.

You see one thing and you automatically react like a normal human being. You were upset and he tried to explain. I think you should go to the hospital and apologize and talk it out with him. If you can't get over this you won't be able to get over something that could be worse! If he loves you and you love him like you say ya'll do than it will work hon. Just talk it out and ask for his forgiveness!|`|oJV3rvsRaa	ITs not your fault!<br>  <br>  However, did he push the girl away?

Go visit him in the hospital. Don't blame yourself for this it isn't in anyway your fault. He was kissing on some other girl so it is his fault.

jd4MzIYtaa	i think it was over the first time you two split up. I dont know how long you were together before getting married but it seems things happened very quickly and you got comfortable with oneanother and settled. You may just be two different people and you are still trying to make it work because it is convienent. I dont know if you have kids together but if you dont, it makes it a little easier. I think you need to repeat what you wrote about being jealous and wanting her back. That proves you only want her because she wants someone else. I know you still love her, but sometimes that isnt enough,Two people who go back and forth in relationships more than a couple times mean that most likely it just wont work out. it is time to move on and star the healing process!|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	Well, I can tell you how you know it's NOT meant to last.<br>  <br>  you can't stay together longer than 7 months at a stretch and she's been dating someone else the entire time you've been married.<br>  <br>  Sweetie, there is nothing to fix here except the mistake you made in marrying this twit.

If she's that prone to get up and walk out over what could possibly be something small and insignificant, perhaps you are too immature to be married right now (you didn't mention ages... I'm assuming).  Marriage is a serious thing and it doesn't sound like either of you are taking it seriously.<br>  <br>  Contact a counselor, pastor, rabbi, or an uninterested 3rd party that can be very honest with both of you.  First - you have to start being honest with yourselves.
6oSm5Qxzaa	it completely depends. If it is your first date then I think he should pay, unless you asked him out then you should pay.

tCiVuFK9aa	Unfortunately the rebound person really does not end up being the one usually.  All the qualities you mentioned about yourself are great but obviously not necessarily what he was looking for.  For one thing you sounded a little submissive.  You worried more about his needs than you did your own.  Don't you think that was a little one sided? Maybe he found it exhausting.  <br>  <br>  Now for some advice.  Let him go.  Don't contact him everytime you are tempted, DON'T.  Give him some time alone and let him really miss you.  If he loves you he will come back and if not then you don't want him back.  Keep yourself so busy that you don't have time to think.  Lean on friends and family when you feel blue. Everytime you start to think of him, force yourself to think of something else.  In time you will start to feel better.  Just remember you can't love someone so much that they will love you back.  I know was with my ex 27 years and I survived the hurt. <br>  Red|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Its NEVER a good idea to be someone's "rebound".....|`|WvOvoxLxaa	Some times you have to go about your business and let them figure out that you where the best thing to happen to him.

You might realize that he really wasn't the man you thought he was.

The thing is that some people do not see things such way! Love is either there or isn't at all. Just because you're so good and everything doesn't mean someone can fall in love with you for that. Some people are attracted to other things...I know you're hurt because it's unfair, you do so much for this person and at the end it's like he's backstabbing you....All i can say is, please never give yourself so much for somebody, some way or the other, they always end up taking advantage of it....
cGbTJobeaa	I am from Chicago and my husband is from Wisconsin and we're always teasing each other about the football rivalry between our home teams.  The tables on my side of the room were all named after Chicago Bears. The tables on my husband's side of the room were all named after Green Bay Packers.  It wound up being a conversation starter between the guests.<br>  <br>  We also had a subtle Cinderella theme.  So I bought those tiny castle escort card holders.  The table name cards were placed in the little castles.|`|XVljoYZ5aa	There are so many fun, creative, personalized ideas to just have numbers! For example, say your honeymooning in Europe. All the table "numbers" can be countries you plan to visit. Ha ha that would be great, huh? You can also do things that are special to you and your FH. A "Buffalo" table with a note about how you met in New York, "Chez Pierre" table with some cute moments about your first date, plus your engagement location, where you each grew up, a table named after the person who introduced you, the list goes on! If you have a theme, you can always tie that in as well. A beach wedding can have different islands, a garden wedding might have flower names, etc. Do organize alphabetically though so as not to confuse guests, which is the only appeal of having numbers to me. Congrats!|`|29I8PWrxaa	We are having a Spring Garden themed wedding.  The ceremony will be outdoors and the reception is in a hotel ballroom.  We are decorating according to the theme, and are using Spring flowers, wheat grass, and moss.  For favors we are giving out Spring bulbs in little boxes with some sort of a saying on the tag like "Our love grows stronger" or something about love blooming or growing (not sure exactly yet).  For table numbers we are instead using names of Spring flowers like tulips and peonies, etc.  We are putting the signs on a stick in a small bed of wheat grass or moss.|`|F3i6UUKYaa	We're not doing formal seating, but I love that idea! <br>  <br>  What is your wedding setting? If it's urban or historic, street names would be great. If it's garden or beach themed, birds or flowers would be great. <br>  <br>  I worked at a winery last summer, and sometimes the weddings would name each table after a different wine.|`|z9st8cLvaa	We're having an Irish wedding, so our tables will be named after the counties in Ireland.  I'm sure we'll end up using printed cards on a stick, but I'm going to try to do something fun with the font, paper, etc.  Happy planning!|`|m3ztkSr4aa	My fiance and I are going to take pictures of ourselves holding the table number. Different poses for each, some smiley, some goofy, etc. I'm still toying with placement options, whether I want to get photo holders and have them be part of the centerpieces. If you are serving wine with dinner, label the bottles with the table numbers. Or don’t use numbers at all. You can use locations that you have traveled to together, local restaurants and hang-outs that you frequent, hobbies that you enjoy, or anything else that will give your guests a taste of who are as a couple.|`|AA11380378	We used places that we loved and we have been together. We are from New England, so we used a name from our favorite beach, our favorite place in North Conway, Fenway Park and others. We had the names placed on a picture of the place in question. It turned out nice.<br>  <br>  Good luck
iPNOVR6Gaa	I don't understand why you believe an ex husband could have any authority whatsoever over you.|`|jdRKZe18aa	He moved?  Well he has absolutely NO say in who you see and who you determine is perfectly responsible to be around the children. Unless he has some legitimate evidence that this guy is evil, bad, criminally minded or worse - then he is just being overly protective and silly.   <br>  <br>  He clearly isn't so worried about his children that he didn't MOVE AWAY, and he must trust them with YOU - so he should trust your judgment or tell him he can take it to a judge to decide differently.   He CAN NOT control your life any longer.... If you are using wisdom and prudence with regard to who you leave your children with then that's ALL he should be concerned about.  I don' t know if the laws are different in the UK or where-ever you live - but in the U.S.A. I think he has NO grounds to say anything!|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	Unless your bf is proven unfit or a threat to your kids, there isn't anything your ex can do about it.  He's jealous that you have met someone, that's all.  If he tries to drag you to court to prevent the bf from looking after the kids, he will be laughed at.  Don't worry about it.|`|WvOvoxLxaa	Will answer this again. Your ex is still the father of these children and has the right to worry about who is with them. Your new one might be better than the father, but since we don't know them we can't judge if the aren't both scum.|`|krQiDGCHaa	How could you be dating this man for 8 months if your husband just moved out 6 months ago?|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	just tell him to leave you two alone as he left you .. so its up to you how you bring up the kids .. good luck to the both of you ...  but your x needs help .. big time ...|`|1Y0yPiSvaa	8 months is not a long time to be able to evaluate what type of person someone is. I am not saying he is not a good guy but if I were your ex I would also be concerned. Is there a reason that you have to leave your children with this new guy? You have to give this time. It is understandable that you want to move on with your life but it sounds like you did that before your hubby even left. Give yourself and children time to adjust to what is happening.|`|WmwEYzYkaa	you were dating for 8mo and your husband moved out 6mo ago? and you have to ask what is wrong with him? your a cheater and cheaters don't deserve any trust! your best bet is give the poor guy what he wants and leave him alone.by the way, tell your bf congratulations because all he's got is a cheater.|`|jBigEy0Caa	Your time table is a little off, but anywho?

End of.|`|3iljgiZRaa	As long as you are not married to this new guy - then you should respect your ex husband's wishes when it comes to random people looking after his and your children. Eight months is not that long - especially considering how casual the relationship must have been for the first two months (since your husband had not even moved out until the first two months had passed). I think that you owe it to your ex, yourself and your children to continue to raise them as a "single" parent regardless of the fact that you have a boyfriend. Until this guys really does "take on" you and your children as his own family then he is nothing more than a boyfriend.... and kids should not be expected to adjust to all of the boyfriends and girlfriends their parents go through.<br>  <br>  You are in a hard situation - but keep in mind that your ex IS their father, whether he is a good role model or not... he must have been okay at some point - you DID have THREE kids with him.|`|MYU46ap5aa	I am a single mother of 3 and I don't let every man I date meet or babysit my children unless I know they are going to be a permanent fixture in our lives.  Children are very impressionable and they don't need to see you dating like this.  It's been too soon and you still have a lot to learn about this man.<br>  <br>  Most men try to get to a woman through her children but I don't go for that at all.  I don't even have men pick me up at my front door.  And I dated a cop for many months.<br>  <br>  Your children are all you have and you need to be careful about who's around them.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Well, if you have been seeing this man for 8 months and your husband moved out 6 months ago....obviously someone cheated.  Your husband is showing his anger by trying to control your life from afar.  He is going overboard, though.  Another thing is, your husband is afraid that your new man is going to replace him as a father figure in your children's lives.  After all, your husband doesn't live with your children anymore and that hurts your husband.<br>  Try talking with your ex or better yet, write him a letter explaining that this new man will not ever replace him as your children's father.  Try to empathize with your ex's feelings.  Honestly, there is nothing he can do to prevent you from seeing someone else or having someone else in your life.  Just be careful that he doesn't set you up.  Is your ex the type of man to make erroneous charges of molestation or abuse against you or this new man?  And what do your children tell your ex when they are with him?  Children will try to be loyal and say things to please their parent, even if it is a lie.  Do your children like your new man?  Do they truly get along?  You need to sit down with your children and reassure them that they are loved no matte what and what has happened between you and their father is not their fault.  You also need to teach them that what goes on in your house...stays in your house and that they are to respect your privacy.  Good luck|`|1VFxZvlwaa	Well you know him better than your ex and if you think you can leave him alone with your children then you should give it a try.

Good luck with that.|`|6hgiRL7Vaa	I think you are being used and he is afraid of loosing a convenient item.<br>  <br>  Get a head on you, girl.

If he is cheating on her with you he will do the same thing to you ! He has most likely found yet another booty call as you refer to it . She probably has caught onto him and hung him out to dry . You should do the same , there is no future with a man like this. don't kid yourself into thinking your the one and he will stop.<br>  The tables are turning because he needs a place to stay ,but at least you know his patterns and will know if you are the only one he is with.|`|djUMvICoaa	If that's the table you want to eat off of, I don't think you're really going to like what is served.  Lets see, he's a cheat, not good.  He accuses you of cheating, a normal trait for a cheater, not good.  He says he's leaving but goes back anyway, not good.  She doesn't want him anymore, not good, for now he is going to need a place to stay, not a relationship and you already offered, not good.  If you think you're getting the good end of the table I think you're getting the short end of  the stick.  I see you as nothing more than that place HE NEEDS right now.  As long as a roof is over his head he is going to be happy, I hope you can be too.
SnQvsOPwaa	Hes only looking for a place to crash and booty calls. Why are you setting your self up to get hurt. That's the only way it's going to end.|`|AA12041870	Because his girlfriend doesn't appreciate you taking her man.  If I were this other girl, your front door would be busted down and you would be in for some serious trouble.  Don't you know it is just WRONG to mess with another woman's man?  You are in the wrong totally here.|`|6dhEB2nBaa	Sounds like they are done and when he moves out he dosent want ot be alone. If he cheated on his current g/f that he lives with do you not think he will do the same thing to you? How would you ever trust him if he went somewhere without you? Is it really worth it? Sounds like a perfect time to get out!|`|7zIAKszxaa	maybe he realy does like you ask him and maybe they are growing apart love fades sometimes|`|96ZfDF6Aaa	You're in the middle of a mess.  The real question is are you actually interested in this person and it seems you're not.  Being a booty call is not exactly a romantic beginning to a relationship.<br>  <br>  He's probably leaving her and using you as his "in-between girl" until he figures out what he really wants to do with himself.  This shouldn't be a problem for you as it seems you aren't all that into him either.  He defintely wants more control of you which is why he got upset that you didn't answer his call.  Its not a sign of affection from someone who is using you for sex.<br>  <br>  Rest assured, if he meets someone he seriously likes, you're history.  <br>  <br>  In some rare circumstances casual sex turns into something real but it doesn't seem like either of you respect the other.  He certainly isn't in love with you.<br>  <br>  Be warned as well; cheaters cheat.  So even if he did develop a relationship with you he has a high potential of cheating on you.<br>  <br>  Self-respecting folks who are able to be alone for a little while leave their relationship before having sex with other people.  Some people feel the need to always be seeing someone so now he wants you to fill the gap before he moves onto someone more serious.|`|tpfxZZADaa	What the hell are you doing?<br>  Are you a whore? Do you have no self respect? Or are you just so greedy you will take sex how ever it is served?<br>  <br>  This man doesn't love you, otherwise you wouldn't be in a "booty call" relationship while he has a steady girl friend he lives with.<br>  Were you having sex with him, just in the hope you were better in bed than her, in the hope that oneday he would come and live with you? Is that why you asked him to move in when he motioned he was sick of his missus?<br>  <br>  The tables haven't turned here, you are still a desperate young selfish woman. It sounds like he may no longer be with his girlfriend, but I think you are in no way interested in anything other than his penis, and maybe his fingers or lips. It is clear you were only on "booty call" so you got some **** and cold hard meaningless sex.<br>  <br>  So I say you need to grow up and turn your own depraved life upside down, grow some morals and live by them rather than sleeping around.|`|r3O9XCSBaa	You are your own person, when he says "answer the phone when I call" that to me is getting possessive. You should not have to answer to him. It is a free country and you are able to do what you want to do.|`|VPFXlKWraa	First off this guy sounds like a pig if he cheats on her more then likely he will do the same to you i can bet my life on it.He wants to have his cake and eat it to.He may express interest in who your seeing and what your doing now ..that may be just because he doesn't like to share he will stay with her and if he commits to you he will be using her for a booty call or who ever else he meets out.Run and don't look back he may just be doing that now because she is wising up to the situation and isn't talking to him because she is mad and catching on to his antics.And any guy that's worth anything wouldn't treat his girl friend in that way .He could just dump her.(Do you want that to be you some day put yourself in her shoes)If they have been together awhile he probably wont leave her completely unless she dumps him and doesn't look back.Find somebody who likes you and only you that's my advice you could be with so much better .....

Qv51RS7Naa	We females say things all the time that we don't mean. Especially in a fight. However, she's probably just angry at herself and taking it out on you. Explain to her that just as she got caught up in the fight and threw the ring, you were just as angry and tossed it out the window. You did the right thing buying a new one, and after she gets over this she will laugh and wear the new ring. If not, then it's her fault to begin with.Don't feel bad.|`|eWMn7dhKaa	Ok, in order to help you with this relationship problem we must know which highway you were on and around where you think you tossed the ring out the window?<br>  <br>  And which direction were you going?|`|88bDvyiwaa	You are seriously screwed man. Expect months of cold war and no sex.|`|fGLHYL0yaa	I AGREE WITH LESLIE W|`|jBigEy0Caa	So this is how you get an upgrade on that old wedding ring.

First, you have to admit that. She was wrong for throwing the ring at you but she didn't throw it out the window. You shouldn't have done that. Second, you have to realize that it wasn't about the ring it was the meaning behind it. She probably looked at that ring and thought of how she got it (you proposing). When she looked at the second ring she probably thought of how she got that one (your fight). Not so romantic. You need to realize that she knows she did wrong even if she doesn't say it. You have to apologize and tell her you'll do anything you can to make it up to her. Don't be surprised at a negative response ie "there's nothing you can do". Just give her a little time to realize that you are trying. Then when she calms down and accepts that she can't have that first ring back you need to replace it. Take the 2nd one back and get a totally different looking one. Re-propose to her on your knee with her hand in your hand. Look her in the eyes and tell her, " Baby, I love you. Will you take my hand in re-marriage and accept this token of my everlasting love for you" Something like that. You can work out the details and make it your own words but you have to be humble about it. You have to fix this if you want it to work out. Otherwise she'll always have that fight to throw in your face and the two of you may not make it. Good luck, God Bless|`|Wj212FWXaa	i just gasped out loud reading this.... well you have a looooootttttt of ***-kissing to do here buddy. okay, that was sweet...-ish to buy her a bigger ring.  but you did do a lot of damage... put an ad out with a reward for the ring.  if you do get it back, return the other one but STILL get her something like a diamond band... cant have too many of those.  obviously she was just being a drama queen when she through the ring at you, but she obviously didnt not want the ring. suggest that you guys do a few sessions of marriage counselling to avoid over-escalation of arguments in the future; it couldnt hurt you either to learn to control yourself and not throw a priceless posession out the window.  but flowers, chocolates, ANYTHING to put a smile on her face is in order right now, including lots and lots of grovelling.  in the mean time ask her if, worst case scenario, she doesnt get the ring back, does she want the 3 carat or one exactly like the old one?  in which case she is absolutely entitled to another diamond band or some earrings or something.<br>  <br>  good luck.  you are going to need it.|`|tXanRtpNaa	i know i am one, but woman are really stupid sometimes! they stuff they don't mean just for attention. <br>  example: a woman says she's "so fat!" but she's not, (and she knows it) but all theywant to hear is "oh no your not" from other people, it boosts their own esteem. it's really dumb! ur wife said that so u would say something like "no no please i love you keep it" blah blah something like that, but since u threw it out the window it was like a total shock to her. she was expecting the answer she wanted to hear, not for u to take it seriously. i know i know, woman are weird, but that is why.|`|uVTosLc9aa	I have not worn my wedding ring in 3 years. My husband and I had a huge blowout 3 years ago. We made up, for a while I was too hurt to wear the ring. Then, our 5 year anniversay was this valentines day, and he bought me a new ring to "start" over. The day before our anniversary we had a stupid fight and he said he wasnt going to give it to me. So, I said I didnt want it because why would I want something he is giving to me just to use as a tool against me to get what he wants. To me, the ring is not something you give, and take away, or give back unless its divorce time. The ring has been sitting in the window sill since. Childish? Maybe, but I am not going to wear something that he isnt going to give to me for an honest, true reason. <br>  So, if you cant find the old one...you need to make the giving of the new one something extra special, and meaningful, with alot of thought. I believe that starting over is possible.|`|kbz5S3waaa	go get a metal detector? she's upset b/c that was a symbol of your marriage, but maybe you should take her out, have a nice dinner, and give it to her as a term of 'starting over' mark that day as your 'reanniversary' and really try to work on it. We have a 'reanniversary' and ever since we made the attempt to start over, and made it official, we've been better (that was 3 years ago...)|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	Where did you throw it out at?

vHP1VH2Qaa	You, my lady, have yourself in a tricky spot, dont you? <br>  <br>  First off, ask yourself what you want from him. Do you want to build a relationship? Do you want somebody to rebound off of? Do you want to just have a release and be intimate with him? All of these are very logical and reasonable responses. But you have to be 100% honest with yourself.<br>  <br>  If you want to build a relationship you have to worry about a few things. First off is the distance. Do you really want to build a relationship in your fragile state with that obstacle in your way. In my opinion your just setting yourself up for more pain. I would highly recommend not doing that. You have already seen how much of a pain it can be, and you haven't even gotten started! But if you still want to go for that, then there are some things you need to look for in him.<br>  <br>  If he is out for a booty call he will stoop to saying anything to get what he wants. So be prepared to be sweet talked. Trust me, I know. I am a master sweet talker, im just glad I have never used it to get into a girls pants. So beware of that. To test him. Try hanging out and telling him how you feel and that you want to take sex out of the picture. And when I say take sex out of the picture, stop at first base. If he wants to make a relationship out of it he will be happy with that. If he only wants more you will see him keep trying to pass the boundaries and stop texting or trying to meet up as much. Don't do this for forever. Do it one meeting and all of a second meeting and if he is passing with flying colors, reward him at the end of the second date! But it is a great test to see where his priorities are.<br>  <br>  If you just want a rebound, emotionally and sexually, that is fine too. Just be sure to let him know. If he stands where I am guessing he stands he will be just fine with that. Just tell him you dont want anything too serious, but you dont want to just be a booty call and exactly how you want the relationship to play out in the short term. Chances are he will go for it and you will both be happy. Then let things lead where they lead. If they form into more, awesome. If not, then they dont, you both made each other happy for a short time and that is what matters.<br>  <br>  If you just want a booty call of your own. Let him know that one too. Not many guys would turn down that opportunity. It can be a great situation for both parties involved. But only if both parties know. If one party thinks that things are any more than they are then bad things happen. Really bad things. <br>  <br>  In all three situations, open communication and honesty to yourself and each other is key! Never let the communication break down and never be at all dishonest with yourself or him.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Explain that to him. Otherwise he's going to think if you two are together and alone you don't have sex you have changed your mind about liking him.|`|PhKzejntaa	PLAYER!!!! Don't even look his way.|`|04Te5gzzaa	You guys definitely got off on the wrong foot if you want to start a meaningful relationship.  You might want to talk to him and say that to him and that you want to start all over from the beginning...like you never had sex.  <br>  <br>  You said he felt the same way as you did...just wanted to get to know each other better but the second time you guys met up, he already wanted to get into your pants again.  I don't think he wants to get to know you more than sex.  If you are serious about a relationship, then control yourself when you're together...just talk and spend time together without getting drunk and physical.  You may not be able to control his behavior so if it's not what you expect from a boyfriend, then it's time to forget this guy.|`|z1UXptEmaa	this is what you do...just suck the johnson. and go *** to mouth and you got him. even if you are a booty call. if that fails let me know and we'll hang out. but first i need to know if you got a landing strip or if u done scorched the earth|`|ab56af4e329bedd35b68ba9892425376aa	You should give it up.  If your into him, let him get into you!|`|X2FrjG8Laa	what ever hapen alraedy hapen|`|bIhasPyHaa	did you moan?|`|0k8H91Dpaa	Dude how old are you ?<br>  Well what's done is done isn't it ?|`|6oSm5Qxzaa	Just tell him how you feel and let him know that this isn't just sex for you. It sounds like he isn't viewing you as easy and he actually has feelings for you so you might not really have anything to worry about. But just let him know that you don't want this to be just sex, but of course you enjoy having sex with him. If he says that he just wants sex then you know that he isn't the right guy for you, but I don't think you will have to worry about that.|`|BHyIl8pJaa	First, having sex with someone is Not the way to get them to notice you, it is a way for them to think that they can get what they want from you.  Since you have already slept with him it will be hard to "redeem" yourself with him.  Try to explain to him that you would like to get to know hime better before you go that far again and see how he takes it.  If he is ok with that you can tell he may have respect for you, but if he quits contacting you, then he was only interested in getting what he wanted.  Be carful of who you give yourself to because that is one thing you can never take back.  Try to enjoy some time with him on a nonsexual level and see how that goes and go from there.  My best advice...communication, communication, communication.|`|cn49BbRiaa	You both seem to be interested in each other so why not stop the sex for awhile until you guys get to know each other more. Sex isnt everything and some couples relationships is only based on sex. Keep to your morals girl not all women have only slept with 2 men in there life. If he really care for you he will wait.|`|D3qIOX0baa	Don't give it to him every time you guys are alone because then he will start to think your just a booty call. Maybe give it to him every other time and if he stops calling because you don't give it to him every time then your better off without him.|`|anibDCRXaa	nah just know your relationship wit this guy is just a booty call andifyou want him to see you as a whore well keep banging him.|`|SLzSg0P9aa	***** if you **** to early the ***** be getting old and rached and aint no ***** want that old nasty *** ***** ok pluz why he wants yours hes been cheating on you with me for the last month CLICK CLICK|`|6jgjZEB2aa	Just tell him the truth; no worries if he is really interested in you as well and its just not the sex thing.|`|W4xRqgbsaa	It sounds like he still respects you, but guys get confused about how to deal with sex just like girls do. When you first start having sex, it can take a while to figure out what's right for you. That is absolutely normal! It's also normal to feel all sorts of feelings about having sex.<br>  <br>  You haven't said whether you really like this guy. Do you? Or was the sex just something that "just happened" between you that you now feel a little guilty about?<br>  <br>  If you feel chemistry with this new guy and really want to get to know him, then you are perfectly within your rights to tell him that you want to take things slowly. If that's the case, you could tell him that he was only your second time, that you don't sleep around, and that you'd like to take some time to get to know before you explore the physical part of your relationship any further.<br>  <br>  If you feel chemistry with him and the sex was really good, though, it might be hard for you to see him without wanting to take things all the way.<br>  <br>  Of course, maybe you know somewhere deep down inside that you don't *really* like him. If that's the case, then forgive yourself for sleeping with him. Like I said, it takes a while to figure your sexuality out.<br>  <br>  If that's the case, you have two choices. Either tell him that you aren't over your ex and aren't ready for someone new (let him down easy) or just see him casually.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend *not* seeing him casually. It sounds like you might not be ready for a strictly sexual relationship.<br>  <br>  One last word of advice -- as long as you respect yourself, that is the MOST important thing. Be safe, take care of yourself, be honest about what you want, and then make yourself happy.<br>  <br>  Some men are really screwed up about women and sex. You can "do everything right" whatever that means and still there will be some guys who might not respect you when you have sex with them. Fortunately, those guys are few and far between. Whether a guy respects you or not shouldn't be what you're mainly worried about. You should be mainly worried about whether you respect yourself.<br>  <br>  I'm 36, after years of men and sex, I can tell you this -- the only time I feel guilty about sex is when I do it with someone I'm not really attracted to. So, I don't do one night stands. This decision you are making, about when and with whom to have sex, well it's only natural that you might make some mistakes along the way. That's ok. It's how you learn!|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	well, its kind of too late for you to 'redeem' yourself no matter what you did or didnt do before him.  you can let it eat you up inside your regrets or you can move forward.  if he doesnt want to take the relationship slower and forgive the impulsiveness on both your parts, then, well it's not worth it to pursue.  get over it and set some rules and boundaries.|`|YZ1PvyQFaa	How old are you
sLLgERQWaa	Unless you are prepared to have one do all the best man duties and the other be a best man in name only, it's fine.<br>  <br>  Or divide the best man duties between them-for example one holds the bride's ring until it's asked for by the officiate, and the other signs as a witness.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ugWaptu2aa	It is not traditional, but since it you and your fiance's wedding I think that both of you should be able to plan it how you wish. You don't have to ask your half sister since the bridesmaids are chosen by the bride based on how they affected the bride in her life. <br>  <br>  It is perfectly ok to have two best men, but that rarely happens. I have been to a wedding where two dads (birth father and step-father) walked the bride down the aisle.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	You can do anything you two want...it's your wedding...|`|DchAJvVqaa	yes, it's perfectly fine... i'm having 2 maids of honor and no brides maids...|`|dq7nvrfhaa	Yes two best men are acceptable..<br>  Enjoy you wedding!|`|e06b9510d36d6807614f5b27b3db416faa	Never heard of it myself, but why not.<br>   your not going all traditional or by the book, so it wont matter.<br>  Have a lovely day.|`|q3ulEHYAaa	you sure can..I'm having a matron and maid of honor in my wedding|`|y7D34AXIaa	ya i think soooo<br>  its your dayyyy|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Yes, having two best mans is more than acceptable.<br>  <br>  It's so hard to pick and choose who should hold that title.

Y9djVW1Naa	If you mean everything matches, like the colour, brand, style, everything, then I don;t think it matters, as long as they are all white as you said.<br>  I would be a little worried if you said just get whatever they can find and they showed up in pink, green and red shoes or something.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	They can just find their own.

It isn't like your guests are going to be looking at their feet so closely.<br>  <br>  If your bridesmaids are wearing long dresses, their shoes don't have to have to match perfectly either.  With my bridesmaids, I had 2 who had serious back/foot issues.  Their dresses were periwinkle and tan.  There was an inset of tan.  I told them to wear whatever taupe dress shoes that they wanted.  They were grateful because they could wear shoes that they already had and they were comfortable.  And not once did I ever notice their feet. And I never heard any of our guests commenting that the bridesmaids shoes didn't match.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	It's completely up to you.<br>  <br>  For me, the fact that they will all be wearing the same "type" of shoe (ballet) would be fine with me.  I would actually prefer them to have different ones that matched their own unique style.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	They can match or they can be different. I say let the moms pick out the shoes so that they can pick a color the little girls can wear again with other clothes.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	No one will be paying any attention to their feet so you can go either way.|`|T28K68Hoaa	Keep in mind these are children, let them wear shoes that will be comfortable for them. The last thing u want to hear at ur wedding is "my feet hurt" from a child.As for style or it really does not matter if they all perfectly match. It may hard for them to find shoes that match all three of them by size, color, etc,|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	It really doesn't matter if they all match perfectly, as I'm certain nobody would really notice what's on the flower girls' feet.  Besides, if you're putting three small children in white ballet slippers, my guess is that they'll all be the same color- mud brown!- by the end of the day anyway!|`|d5781f30069ecf14d7c481d2dc40aec7aa	They can be whatever you are happy/comfortable with. It is YOUR wedding. There is no right, no wrong, only what you like.|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	I would say they should all match as your bridesmaids shoes should match.  And for the record, I bought my flower girls their shoes along with my junior bridesmaid; part of my gift to them.|`|hizRPh9raa	Whatever they find will work. The girls are going to be so cute on their own, no one is going to focus in on their shoes.|`|ge3meKYEaa	I have a keen eye as an artist and I would never notice kids shoes not matching- I don't think it matters, kids are cute on their own!|`|AA11509996	you should trust your  own judgment because you are right. it doesn't matter if they don't match perfectly!  your little flower girls will be cute regardless.|`|e06b9510d36d6807614f5b27b3db416faa	It depends on how old they are, what look is the dress and, how come the mums are buying them?<br>   Personally I think that ballet pumps only look ok on small children, if any of the flower girls are say six or over, then something more grown up for them.<br>  <br>  But go with whatever you think looks best really.<br>  <br>  *OH, I live in England, I've not heard of it here.

9QyrW2iCaa	You and your husband will never be treated equally -- you are two different people and this is merely a fact of life.  The sooner you come to accepting this, and am no way am I implying that you accept bad behavior, the sooner you will feel mental peace and clarity.<br>  <br>  Your mother-in-law (MIL) seems to have some character defects.  Being hyperfocused on looks and encouraging one's own children to work in strip joints can cause some problems with self-esteem.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like you and your husband are the MATURE duo--the ones that MIL comes to with responsibility type requests.  This in itself can seem flattering.  I understand you want to be part of the fun quotient too.  Why don't either you or your husband (or both of you) ask your MIL & FIL to do a fun activity together?  Instead of waiting for her to do the asking and planning, you come up with it first or PLAN it with her.  She may say no the first few times you ask, and be prepared for that, but keep asking.  If she never comes around it's not any fault on your part because you have made plans and reached out.<br>  <br>  I'm going to recommend an excellent book to you.  You can buy it online very cheaply used.  Please don't be bothered by the Christian overtones of the book because it has a lot of valuable info in here, even if you are not Christian.  The book is "Boundaries" by Cloud and Townsend.  Once you read this book you will be amazed by how you're seeing things and how you can actively change your behavior to set appropriate boundaries with MIL.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about not being the prettiest one or having children.  Make the most of your HEALTH with diet, exercise and good material for your brain--like reading and such.  Make the most of your marriage as a DINK (dual income no kids).  I'm childless and dote my energy on and time to my husband, friends, work, interests and cat.  <br>  <br>  Take care of yourself.   Huge hugs to you and all the best your way now and in the future!  = )|`|yCBpl2Jgaa	For her birthday let her know it Lol. Buy her a "mother-in-laws cusion" its a type of cactus Lol. Research it ! xx :P|`|9pGeqpXyaa	Have you talked to your husband at all about how all this is feeling to you?  If you have, what are his thoughts?  And if you haven't, why do you think you haven't?<br>  <br>  Aside from that though, the problem you have here is that you've got a controlling mother-in-law.  You're going to torture yourself if you hope someday she will treat everyone equal.  She won't.  Its as simple as that.  She's got a different (albeit quizzical) set of values.  So how much she values you or your husband can't matter to you guys.  Be each other's source of strength and validation rather than hoping to receive it from your MIL.  If you can do that, she won't have any control over you anymore.  And all these antics she does are just for that.  It's for control.  Even if she herself doesn't realize it.<br>  <br>  So try your best to not over-analyze every little thing.  Get secure in yourself and she won't be able to exploit you.  And also in that, be the bigger person and go ahead and do favors for her sometimes.  If she doesn't really ever perform any favors back, it doesn't matter.  That's what being the bigger person is all about.  Just don't let her pressure you into things and times that don't work for you.  Be a  good person and help when asked.  But make it work around what your life has going on.  Don't let yourself be pressured into feeling like you always have to change your schedule all around to fly over and accommodate her.  You and your husband are your first priority.  Get your self and your priorities and values established, and she can fit in around there where it works.|`|DgFhlJvYaa	You should talk to your husband. Tell him how you feel about being treated different. You married him & your family & you shouldn't be treated any different from the rest. Just because you waited longer to get married & cant have kid's doesn't mean you cant have a normal marrige to the man you love. Talk about it with your husband & if he feel's the same then the both of you sit down with him mother & talk it out like adult's.|`|07A0bFi6aa	I really don't think people like that ever change so don't expect them to. <br>  Having said that...You made me laugh with the computer problems as my MIL does the same to me! I got fed up with it, just like you... so my response has been to withdraw my services slowly and gradually. Every time she asked I pretended not to know the answer or said I would do it and never got round to it. She is so impatient that she would pay the call centre and get it done that way. Anyway she no longer bothers me with questions so I got the result I wanted. <br>  She did similar things about family gatherings at Christmas etc and would arrange everything with the SIL and then just tell us afterwards as though we had no input or preferences. Well at that point I did say they were welcome to do that but in future my husband and I would do our own thing unless we were included in the decision making as it was our day too. She walks on eggshells now. She knew my husband was behind me all the way.<br>  It's upsetting you so you should do something but how you go about it depends on how you think they will respond. Will they take what you say on board or will they snub you even more? Will it get resolved or will it turn into an even bigger problem? Is the little sister a problem too or would it be helpful to ask her directly to include you on the funstuff?<br>  .|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	Sounds like a double standard to me.<br>  I'd object to that weight obsession that creates eating disorders.|`|X3K25srLaa	this was looooooooong.. I think I got it .. your sister in law is marrid to the little brother right. well, its sad to think like this.. but, don't expect anything from them.. i mean think about it do you really need ther comfort to feel good.. I am treated the same way and i got to a conclusion.. no matter how much or what i do they are not happy w/ me.. and i wasnt either.. so, i decided to ignore ignore and love me for what i am .... and what i do.. i still treat them cool.. but, i ignore everything they do for my sister in law..  be happy for them .. u be happy.. i know that it is hard bcus you don't have kids yet.. but, a tip to that.. go to a massager and tell him/her to massage your uterus.. ofcourse it is topical.. your uterus might be cold maybe thats why you havent had kids.. that happend to my SIL.. so good luck and w/ your IL oh well when they are ready to treat you good is when you are ready.. so good luck.. ps i live much more happer now that i ignore.. they'll notice it pretty soon.. o and by the way being pretty or not so pretty has nothing to do w/ that.. imagin that your sister IL face woud get burned.. she would still be the same person,... awlggggggggggggggg.. cant type.. sorry got my nails done.. and hard to dam type... so, anywho...just be who u r .. quit trying to please them all the time.. whenever she wants something say you are busy. treat her exactly how she treats u and don't dwell o it.. move on.. treat her nice.. remember she is yoiur hubbys mom... so, ........... well. hopefully that helps.. good luck
nLlVduOuaa	i've gone through the same thing as u.  my " friends" did things like that all the time.  my advice is be who you are and find friends that love you for you and don't gossip about u.  they are out there, trust me.  and as far as your current friends,  confront them nicely and ask them what the problem is.  it might be something you did, or it might just be them and they are too insecure w/ themselves that they  feel they have to treat u like that.  anyways, find good and sweet friends, and i'm sure they will love you for who you are.|`|Gfwt9XPJaa	i used to have so called friends like that. they are nothing but trouble, ditch them and make new friends, ones that you can rely on not ones that will turn their backs on u. you will relise this when u get older and leave school, i did x|`|pcCfHYeSaa	they aren't true friends.

I had a suppose to be a best friend and one day she didn't talk to me. I asked what her problem was and she told me she moved on and I said well real friends don't move on because best friends are forever friends. That night she cussed my out and talked trash about me on AIM so I just made new friends and that fight actually got me closer to my other friends. I think she used me because when she didn't have any friends she was friends with me but when she found popular friends she leaves me standing in the dust.|`|ugmtF6Bsaa	No kick them to the curb but then again it just might of been a joke?..... talk to them about it|`|OUVUU5xRaa	Not really, true friends don't do things like that.|`|19ff4a5476c7928c424d222a79658debaa	They don't sound like good friends.<br>  Seriously the running away and laughing in your face thing should be a were not good friends alert.lol.|`|CULqCWvXaa	they deffanatly do not saound like good friends. start hanging out with someone else and there going to feel stupid for losing you.|`|E4W6KxCMaa	Sounds like elementary or middle school kids to me...There's alot of growing up to be done.<br>  <br>  Find new friends.<br>  Good luck & God Bless.|`|PhKzejntaa	True friends don't run away and laugh at you.

It's not that our thought patterns are identical - they are not - but it seems we have enough confidence in one another to trust each other to take the lead in making certain decisions. We never argue about money, for example; not because we want to spend money on exactly the same things (we don't), but because I trust that when he makes a purchase he considers necessary or important, he is being responsible, and wouldn't have made this purchase if it was unwise to do so. Iit works the other way around, too: he doesn't question my judgment, as he knows that my judgment is good.<br>  <br>  This is not to say we don't have differences in the way we see the world - we do; some aspects of our personalities are different (he is a little less social than me, I'm a little less flexible than him, etc.) But somehow we're always able to come up with a solution that suits both of us. We have very few disagreements.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Brunette wifes husband who the hell are you lol.<br>  <br>  And who said we have never had 1 cross word with each other?<br>  <br>  I never did thats for sure.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Now?

I am very aware of the excesses of government and how it effects our budget, she continues to think government is the only way to "help poor people.." <br>  <br>  During election years things can get pretty tense. Frankly my concerns about current direction of our country is something I will not discuss with her other then in passing about the debt it is creating for our kids.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Yeah most the time but when we are we find a way to talk it out and get though it. We are on the same page at least 98% of the time. Its very rare to not be.|`|PhKzejntaa	When we are happily married, most of the time, we are on the same page.

Maybe she is comparing and deciding; be fast in your actions.|`|5nAnWp3daa	yes it will|`|qu7Ia50yaa	i say that holding off talking to her as much might work. jus don't like talk and flirt with other girls around her..she'll think you don't like her that way anymore. but if you hold off on talking to her...if she likes you, she'll realize she misses talking to you so much, and start texting you more.<br>  trying to get more time with you. <br>  kind of like the "you don't know what you got til it's gone" type of deal.

You need to have a keen awareness of certain rules of development to make an accurate assessment, and one of those rules is called the identification process. Why do certain people 'identify' with certain other people for example.|`|ZPTmbQW4aa	Thats NOT how the saying ACTUALLY GOES...<br>  <br>  From what I have always UNDERSTOOD the saying goes<br>  " Tell me WHO your FRIENDS are and I will tell you WHO YOU ARE"<br>  <br>  Meaning..... You show me the group of friends you run with and I will tell you exactly the TYPE of person YOU are simply because....<br>   A BIRD of a feather FLOCK TOGETHER....<br>  And YES the saying makes ALOT of sense and it also has ALOT of truth to it...|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	No, it doesn't work that way. You maybe can tell a lot about a person by 'why' they love someone but not whom.|`|WvOvoxLxaa	Yes it makes sense to me. It would say if you have self respect, what you value.|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	Sorry NO, because a person is not who they are because of the person they love.  They are made up of their likes and dislikes, their morals and ethics.  With that in mind, a person could love someone that is completely opposite of them and visa versa.|`|eeCoeMZsaa	maybe<br>  the quote that opposites attract is true <br>  so who knows|`|88bDvyiwaa	No. Otherwise people would mistake me for a pedophile.<br>  <br>  I am not.

I think that it means that the kind of person you fall in love with defines you, your needs and your personality.

Is it you or would she be like this with any girl that seems to have his love? Sometimes mothers have a hard time of letting go of their sons. Your bf needs to stand up for you and tell her he'd appreciate it if she would keep her opinions to herself, that he loves you and her downing you all the time isn't going to cause problems between you and him, but between her and him. If he loves you, it's up to him to make this better. If nothing else, she would have to get along with you for their relationship. Maybe if he'd do that, she'd see nothing she says is going to break you all apart and in doing this , she may give you a chance. Good luck!|`|rSXZOU5zaa	I have the same problem with my boyfriends mom. I've decided that its just because he is her little boy and doesnt want to see him get hurt.

(no matter what the argument is over, she will not see your side) also, try to get to know her. When you are visiting his mom, ask if she needs any help with anything (around the house ect.) and talk to her about a piece of furniture you really like or something. Bring up the news and how terrible the world has gotten. (moms eat that up) And dress modest around her. <br>  I hope that helps.|`|sHzP9u5Taa	my boyfriends mum HATED me when we first met, she wouldn't even look at me let alone talk to me because she loved my boyfriends ex so much!! she never got my name right either!!<br>  <br>  it was months before she even started to get to know me, but i was polite about it because thats all i could be and now we get along great<br>  <br>  i would suggest just to be polite and not to bother otherwise, you cant make someone like you and if she never will and you and your boyfriend stay together, you'll just have to deal with it<br>  <br>  as long as you and your boyfriend love each other, why should anyone else matter??<br>  <br>  xxx|`|KkTJf8kWaa	Your bf needs to make a choice.

This has been the hardest thing in my marriage...no one compares to Mommy! Well, in her mind! LOL I talked very openly about it with my husband so that he understood where i was coming from and he didn't get angry when i vented about it. <br>  The best thing to do is ignore it and go on, just remember the relationship is about you and him...not her! But why is your bf telling you all the negative things she says? He needs to stand up for you to her if he hasn't already!|`|I12nj0M7aa	I know it's scary, but you really need to talk to her, or else this issue won't go away. Tell her how you feel about the way she talks about you, and that you care for her son a lot. Tell her that she is negatively effecting your great relationship with him. Don't be passive, be assertive... because she probably feels like she has the power to talk down to you. Show her that you have balls, and that you don't appreciate what she says and does. She might actually gain respect for you if you do that.|`|V5CRGK86aa	I have been in your situation before...TWICE. Believe me honey, if your boyfriend's Mother doesn't like you, then it won't work out between the two of you. If your boyfriend and his Mother are close, he is going to take her advice over yours, it's just natural. Nobody can influence a man more than his Mother. There has to be some kind of reason she doesn't like you. And if your boyfriend won't come to your defense to her, or tell her how he feels about you, he will NEVER man up. I would honestly think about leaving him, because if he can't man up to his own Mother regarding his feelings for you now, he never will.|`|YT9vgUNbaa	Does she have some sort of apparent mental disorder? If so, it would be best to continue to ignore it.<br>  However, if she's just being a jerkface, I would politely bring it to her attention, and let her know that it REALLY bothers you. Instead of pretending like she's not talking crap about you, she may have more respect for you if you (again, NICELY - but firmly) communicate to her that it is not appreciated.<br>  It is not always the case, but often times when someone is behaving as a bully, they respect the victim more after being confronted.|`|SUIF1DQ2aa	Usually mothers find it hard to let go of their Baby Boy. She just wants what's best for her son and I'm sure you are the best thing for him. What you should do is have a discussion with everyone involved and say exactly how you feel about her being so upset with you. Over  time it may cease once she realizes what a great girl you are for him.|`|fuII7ucxaa	Depends on your age.  Let's deal with that issue first!|`|iOSUL4ddaa	I know it's a difficult situation, since he can't choose between his girlfriend and his mother, even though she seems to be trying to force him to. Continue to be supportive, even while she's putting you down. This will take some stress off your boyfriend and show that you are the mature one. Instead of lashing out at her, next time she says something negative, say back, "I appreciate your opinion, but I don't agree with you." and leave it at that. If it's about something you're doing, then say, "Is there anything I can do better?" If she does not give a viable response (such as, I'd prefer that you put mustard on this instead of mayonnaise) then if she bitches again, remind her that you already asked how to improve.<br>  <br>  If this is really causing problems in your relationship, talk to your boyfriend. Make sure he understands that you love him, and don't want to come in between him and his mother, but that he needs to stand up for you if he wants your relationship to progress. If he is unable to do so, and it seems as if your relationship is not going anywhere, it might be better to just remain friends.
Z6mKM1DOaa	You have it absolutely right.  He's stringing you along as second fiddle or reserves if it doesn't work out with the other girl.  Meanwhile, he treats you like crap be being rude, inconsiderate and inconsistent.  The whole "hey sexy" remark was meant to string you along more...just flattery.<br>  <br>  Frankly, you deserve better and I think you know that.  I would show this guy tail lights.|`|Lk7TpfMKaa	He sounds like a perverted dick. Do not waste any time associating with him. Delete him as a contact on everything.|`|D2cCZVQXaa	You did the right thing all the way. In fact keep doing it. You don't need someone like that in your life. If he is acting like he wants something with when he's with another girl, then he's not worth it. It means he would do the same to you. Sounds like a scumbag. <br>  If he happens to try to get in contact with you ignore him. If he didn't mean it he would apologize. But if he did... good riddance!|`|T6iciES8aa	No 1) Maybe he didn,t get invited to this BBQ and was just trying to make you jealous<br>  No 2) If he told you to meet you at a certain place he should of met you he,s trying to use you for his guy friends.<br>  No 3) You did do the right thing defenetley he should not of called you that if you are just friends.<br>  No 4) His true intentions sound pretty much like he,s using you <br>  <br>  I Really think you should have a talk with him and ask him Why he,s treating you the way he is and if he keeps on treating you this way my suggestion would be keep to your good friends who treat you well.|`|kzjasYqaaa	that's really mest up and by the way sorry. but i think he wants to go to the next step. he seems like he wants you with him just not going out with him. and he wants you to have pretty friends that way all of you can hang out.|`|Od8OJatyaa	ok.... well no duh u did the right thing <br>  guys like him are a bunch of little assholes|`|nVuOYHC7aa	He's Ignorant. No woman deserves to be treated like that.<br>  Yes, you did do the right thing. I can assure you his girl wouldn't like the fact of him calling you sexy. He wants his cake and to eat it too. He's the one that made his bed the way he did. So Let him Lay there. If He decides to come around and actually treat you like a "Bud" then you can talk.|`|OUVUU5xRaa	Yeah, he sounds like a jerk.  I wouldn't bother with him anymore.
a7VkyZLfaa	The personality is the key , show high self confidence like dont show the girl that you know that you are average , speak that you see your self handsome and ccomplished , ambtious ,look into eyes when you speak , your head and shoulder up , show generousity , impress with dinner , drinks , show that you spend money , of course your look I mean the way you dress is very importan , wear something dark like black shirt and pant ,many women get their attention the dark colors on guys, if you have a wide shoulders and nice chest , show some , wear something that shows you beautiful parts in your body. I am sure you have something in your body that you are proud of ,your arms , butt , shoulders ,chest or even thick neck . If you want to flirt with a woman dont say you have beautiful hair while her hair is messed up , look for something really beautiful on her , lips , eyes . Dont look at her sexually , talk with her like a gentle man , many women love guys because they didnt show any sexual sign from the first time.Dont complain about anything infront of any girl , dont show that you are sad depressed or having problems , or talk about your ex or anything , talk about the brilliant side ,like what do you dream in life , what is your ambitiob , talk about travelling , where do you want to visit , I am speaking about first impression here, then when you know the girl very well you can say what you want. Trust me many women dont look at the whole face or body ,some of them they look only at lips ,or at eyes or at your beard of just your shoulders or chest . My boy friend is less than avarage and I love him  first time I saw him he was wearing black shirts  I looked at his wide shoulders and the way he talked with confidence and didnt complain and he was so generous at restaurant and he was pointing at the most expensive food and wine in the menu , it is not about money it is about him being classy .|`|X3kz6fG8aa	i'd say since first impressions are irreversible, your appearance is important, and make sure you smell good, women love that. Let her know you have a job in so many words for instance " I get off of work at 5 if your not busy can I take you out for a bit to eat afterwards".. <br>  <br>  Something to that nature, and what ever you do, look her dead in the eye's and compliment her on something, anything we will appreciate...|`|g5VtWdtIaa	confidence.<br>  And not to hassle them ie,<br>  if you like a girl, the minute they come on msn, DONT immediately talk to them it gets reaallllyyy annoying and they will resent you for it.<br>  Also don't try to rush things.. ie don't start calling them 'babe' or 'sweety' etc..<br>  umm also.. flatter them, leave a comment on myspace on their pic saying 'you look nice' (or something more deep lol) nothing OTT tho!<br>  <br>  goood luck|`|mCWqdbfYaa	looks arent what matter to everyone(yes there are girls with hearts out there lol) but a nice smile is a huge turn on hopefully you would smell nice otherwise they might tell you to take a shower lol  jk seriously im joking but hygiene is good just be yourself and no body else and you will be fine|`|sIwtp0bGaa	He will probably hang around a lot and catch your eye. Ohh and SMILE LOL :)|`|mThBQYGuaa	confidence is key.<br>  thats the hottest thing on this earth<br>  lol|`|JbrJgJGjaa	Usually they smile and take my hand or just hang around a lot:)|`|PhKzejntaa	I prefer a man that doesn't talk about himself, cars, and other girls all the time.<br>  I like a man that is clean and nest but not obsessive with himself, like kissing his own arms. Don't talk about penis size, how big or small it is.There was a research done on smell. Women chose men that smelled similar to their dads.<br>  If a woman cares about you, she has a file cabinet of every thing you said or did to her in her brain. So avoid any negative comments like I wish you could be that way or your butt's big.<br>  Don't tell a woman to suck your thing. Get her in the mood first for crying out loud!|`|kC6iAMDJaa	When I first saw him he came off as a too good a$$hole. He just stared me down, never smiling just a hard stare.<br>  my bf is not easy on the eyes and co workers ask him how did he get me. He took control. He had tons of friends but he was always alone. If he went to a club I would see him standing in the back by himself but everyone was paying for his drinks. They liked him but feared him at the same time. Never fighting he just had that ora. Whatever he said they did. I feel head over heels for him and three yrs later we still are in love like the first day I say him.|`|1xr6T6h0aa	Height is of utmost importance for me upon first impressions.  I like em tall (Over 5'11).  <br>  <br>  Then he has to smell nice, not like cologne.. just nice.  <br>  <br>  He needs to have nice teeth.<br>  <br>  He needs to be moderately attractive, not super hot, just presentable.<br>  <br>  Things like hair, shoes and clothes can always be changed or updated later if we choose to date him... <br>  <br>  Also, CONFIDENCE!  But not cocky!|`|Ds2evQ3maa	a great smile and thats not just having to be attractive but i meaningful feeling smile and smelling good is also a plus|`|yRdmzCPYaa	same as wat YING YANG said|`|65ojSBXgaa	Some of the things I will notice in a guy would be his smile the clothes he wears and if he smells good. I like guys with hair on their head if they are smart, funny. I really enjoy cracking up so a guy that has a fun personality is an A+ to me. I really dont have a type I really search for honesty and personality and funnyness. But as we all know every one is different so I'm telling you my two cents. One thing I can tell you is that think about what you are looking for in a girl there's a lot of types and you need to find the one that will best suit you. One thing that guys dont know but think they do is that girls love romance!!! Good Luck on your search,<br>  <br>  Gail Friend
MHg9JhEKaa	Whilst I utterly disaprove of his hot-cold treatment towards you, I think whilst that is still happening, perhaps it could be good to wait. If, like you and others suggest, he has depression, then it would be terrible if you got divorced and it turned out to be down to him being unwell.<br>  <br>  I think if he is so adamant that he doesn't love you, and that you must move on, then he should be willing to be seen by a doctor to prove this isn't depression talking.  Does he think that you his wife, and his family, would suggest he had depression if you didn't honestly suspect?  If he is of healthy mind, then he's got nothing to worry about and nothing to hide has he? He'll take out a loan and buy you a car, but won't have a few minutes chat with a doc?  <br>  <br>  I think filing for divorce could be a wrong move at this time. However, I also think you need to tell him to BACK OFF from you. By all means see the kids, but he is not to play the doting husband as and when it pleases him!  And the car? I think that sounds like an 'I feel guilty about messing you around' present. Which shows he does care... otherwise he wouldn't feel guilt.  <br>  <br>  Overall, I'd put the ultimatum to him about seeing a doc, as you have to try and rule out depression before you can go any further. <br>  <br>  I wish you all the best x|`|kNAcutL0aa	maybe he is gay...and do not want to disclosed it|`|TPN1yIj7aa	tell this spoilt little boy to shape up or ship out. this isnt fair on you or your kids. he is effectively keeping you dangling on a string. How long does he see you 'hanging ' around for him ?<br>  <br>   you need to start living for yourself so start making moves, get your own bank account, go out and meet someone else. <br>  <br>  you are offering him no real incentive to change his ways,why should he ? he has the best of both worlds. you need to make him see that he cant be a family man with the benefits of a wife and a single man living with his brother at the same time.<br>  <br>  get him told and dont take any excuses about depression, not knowing what he wants etc etc, you have your own life to lead.|`|nBQeSu2faa	It's possible he is suffering from depression, it's possible he is having an affair, it's possible he like the single life ...there are many possibilities but you need to ask him what it is he wants from you . If you allow this to continue nothing will change until he decides it is to change. It's now time you took control of this situation...if talking to him does not make any difference then you need to stop playing this game with him .   What he is doing to you is very unfair...you now need to change the rules of the game...don't have joint bank accounts, tell him he can't call any time he likes, tell him you need to make a life for yourself.     You are making it to easy for him to be the way he is...everything seems to be what he wants but you are having no say in the matter at all...don't be  there at his beck and call.|`|B1jZars7aa	Dont forget, actions speak louder then words. <br>  He probably does still love you, but he seems afraid of commitment, a little bit of a mummies boy, I would think, he just does not know what he wants out of life.In the end, do you really love him, if not, then move on. good luck to your future.|`|claUGpVRaa	Tell him to stop playing games with your emotions in order to keep his own options open. Tell him it's cruel or him to mess with your emotions like that. He needs to accept that and make a decision he can stick to.<br>  Good luck|`|4wnn2GbYaa	he is either with u or not, he just wants u for intercourse..file a divorce...make ur own bank account..tell him 2 stop bein nice...stop spending his money... live ur LIFE find a man who appraites u and loves u very much and is kind...|`|XlhBBZPxaa	looks to me as though he is playing wtih you and are you sure he doesn't have someone else on the side???? check and make sure sounds like he is having an affair or mid life crisis|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	He may have someone else on the side|`|494686d7f957aafee66b8f4b81212affaa	Hello Wake up!!<br>  Why would you Settle for this kind of Life? You deserve better and so do your children. <br>  You can not help someone who does not want help, You can only help yourself.<br>  You make it too easy for him by waiting around waiting for him to decide how YOUR life should be.<br>  Life is for Living and you are not living.|`|4JrDGW7Taa	You need to talk. I know you are going to tell me that you have talked. But may I suggest that you invite him to go with you to a restaurant - a place where you can talk quietly - and ask him the obvious questions. Like "what is it that bothers you that makes you move away from me?" <br>  <br>  If he feels free enough to voice his complaint - 'I don't love you is not acceptable' - then tell him what you do not like about his behavior. Yes, this seems like an idiotic way to build a relationship but if it's idiotic it is also the only way. You gotto start talking.<br>  <br>  Check out my source for more info on how to build relationships.|`|BO28Mn8haa	he is fearing commitment. which is very late now. i don't think you should let him do what he wants with you. stop sleeping with him and seeing him as often as you do. if he wants to be out of your life and act like he doesn't love you, then let him do it! don't go along with him. give him the cold shoulder and let him figure his stuff out. when you are tending to his every desire you are allowing him to have the best of both worlds. its one or the other. i say, cold shoulder until he figures it out so you don't get taken along for a ride. good luck|`|PWN5rqgxaa	i think he wants the freedom of being able to do his own thing, including getting a piece from you when he wants it<br>  <br>  at least he is man enough to support you and the kids with his time and money<br>  <br>  you need to decide if this is ok with you and how you want the next few years to be, or if you want him to commit one way or the other to being in your house and in your life, or moving out of it so you can move on as well|`|TWNh6Dooaa	Very similar happened to me about 9 years ago, the guy did this to me, on/off, on/off, I was so confused.<br>  <br>  He wanted me one day, loved me, slept with me, then the next told me to move on - just like you.<br>  <br>  In the end he DID NOT come back to me, and had been seeing someone else all along, he married her pretty soon after he led me up the garden path.|`|mj52nmKtaa	In my opinion, it seems like he still loves you, but he's in denial or something. You should have a serious talk with him, and after that, make up your mind. I know it's hard, but you can't let him do that to you, tell that he loves you one day and the next he doesn't. Ask him to make up his mind... that muhurtfulurtful for you.|`|BA0wMRuGaa	He does sound very confused. Maybe he thinks he is doing something wrong by you and therefore thinks you shouldn't be togetehr but he still wants to support you and your children in every way possible. Sit him down and talk about divorce and ask him if it's what he really wants. There is no other step that can determine the truth quicker.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|D33VRTz8aa	At the point of time when he told you that he does not love you, maybe that's how he felt then. But after being apart from you he may have realised that he does. Or It could be that he loves you but he does not realise it. <br>  <br>  Try talking to him see what he has to say about this.|`|6hgiRL7Vaa	Sounds like depression to me. He probably is in denial, and thinks depression is a stigma. (To many people it is a stigma).<br>  <br>  Have your family doctor do an evaluation and reccommend he be tested for depression. He should agree to a test to prove everyone wrong.|`|lPXscuKSaa	I think that he is fighting his sexuality.|`|QwYxjjeraa	If your from ireland seek help from AWARE it a deperssion group or maybe seek marraige councelling|`|3lxagSP7aa	I think you need to be the strong one here. he is not treating you right, He probably realises the relationships over but has trouble letting go, its all too familiar for him and hes comfortable, I would distance yourself and see what happend, I think he is very confused about what he wants. Maybe now that your not together he is seeing you the way he saw you at the beginning because the fighting etc doesnt exist, maybe its because your having a lovely time. But I really do think you need to say enough is enough, he has made his decision and thats it. If you cant just be friends u may need to see less of him.|`|X55EHXeVaa	i do sympathise i have a similar situation, i would say he is afraid of the commitment and is enjoying the single life also. He wants to see kids and is getting easy no strings sex from soemone he once loved, maybe he does want to get back with you but is too proud to say, why not ask him?<br>  <br>  my husband left me and is now living with his brother, he works there in the week but he waltzs off whenever he feels like it, he likes his freedom but gets acces to the kids at the wkd, he won't let me relocate and won't move back home, the ball is now in mine (and your )court to kick them in the balls and tell them its not good enough. Take care of yourself.|`|e3442b42bd59f05b36773c8ef3077c53aa	hi, i had to double take your post, I could have written it!! my husband left me and our kids in august last year, he too went to live with his brother, he comes round and chats to me, helps out, acts like he cares...but tells me to move on because he doesn't love me, at new year he told me he missed me , had made a terrible mistake and wanted to come back, the day after he changed his mind.

I am blessed with a husband, who perhaps because he is older, is more patient and understanding. I got married at 20, had 3 sons and has stayed married for 34 years. Quite a long time if you think of it. We've had our ups and downs as every other couple would go through. <br>  <br>  The age difference between spouses does not really carry much weight if you ask me. What's important is that you have a mature, sensible and responsible outlook and strive to always make the relationship work. You just never stop making the effort to do so and must remain committed to one another. <br>  <br>  It is always a good thing to have someone you love share the many varied experiences that one goes through in life.

If your worried about age difference between you and your spouse, maybe your worried about other aspects of your marriage as well.  Dont' worry about what other people think of the age difference.

There is no such law for divorce. <br>  Even if you've lived separate the entire time, you are still legally married until you file for divorce. <br>  NC does not require a waiting period, so as soon as you receive the final divorce decree, you can remarry.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	You can probably do this so cheaply and easily, but I'd call a lawyer.

Posted 10 days ago. Flag this as objectionable <br>  In the US, the ways for a marriage to be terminated is by death or by a decree of a competent court. <br>  <br>  So, if your husband is still living and neither of you have obtained a divorce decree from a court, you two are still legally married with each other. <br>  <br>  Are you still in contact with the husband? Perhaps he has obtained a divorce decree. <br>  <br>  If you cannot find your husband and cannot confirm the status of your marriage, you can check with an attorney in the state where you are living to find out its procedures on divorce. In many states, such as WA, the status of the marriage can be terminated by a court even if the other spouse cannot be found.

Spring break would be an excellent time to maybe go away for the week or weekend to a romantic bed and breakfast or resort hotel. Somewhere where you can find find activities during the day as well as night. Surprise her with a romantic candle lit dinner. Always a plus in romancing a loved one. And maybe buy her a trinket as a reminder of your romantic getaway.|`|3MZfBLmcaa	If it's for her spring break, plan a day together. Keep her interests in mind. Go to a museum, go shopping, have a picnic, see a sports game, take a walk through the city or country (where ever you don't live), go to a special dinner. something like that. Flowers are always a plus. Instead of typical roses try something pretty and bright and colorful for spring time to make her smile. Just let it be all about her. If the day is dedicated to her, and you give her lots of affection and attention, it won't matter how much you spend, it will still be the best day for her!|`|o4y9d5Npaa	Aww thats so sweet, why not plan a few nice days out? Take her to her favourite resturant or something. Buy her a nice necklace, either a colour she likes/horoscope or something?<br>  <br>  <br>  Orrr take her to a concert, like one of her fav artists....that would be best :) :)|`|lStzkFTbaa	jewelry, engraved or something. it doesn't have to be really expensive, just make sure it's pretty.|`|1ABjalzzaa	WELL U HAVE A BIT WITH HER WHY DONT U JUST WAIT AND THEN U HAVE GIVE HER SOMETIHING SPECIAL JUST WAIT|`|6jgjZEB2aa	Provide her with what she is fond of.|`|z1UXptEmaa	dude its 4 months. she dont like you she done ****** your friend. get checked|`|w6DJj1a8aa	do something that you would never have thought of doing for somebody you dated and do it for her if she really means that much to you!!!!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I think you could surprise her by learning how to spell properly.<br>  <br>  It's Dating. NOT dateing...|`|tFbdkxyIaa	find out what she likes and ask her to reserve such and such a date for her, but try to make it sound nonchalant. and then surprize her with something (concert, lovely restaurant, picnic, flowers, little gift). it's best if it's something that is really personal to do with her own passions.<br>  <br>  i like the suggestion that you cook for her. i love it when i guy makes me a really nice dinner. one guy did that for me, i came over and he had prepared a lovely candlelight dinner with soft music. i was so moved!|`|5GPDrBPLaa	Not sure what gift to recommend...maybe a subscription to her favorite magazine??<br>  <br>  As for something special to do, you could cook for her.  There are so many things you can make, very easy, that seem hard.  You guys could also go out somewhere like a comedy club.  Good luck Romeo!|`|0k8H91Dpaa	Take her out to eat .<br>  A nice rose would be nice .|`|UwnXYMI4aa	i don't get a spring break because of exams.
tFbdkxyIaa	keep expressing your appreciation for gifts and you can tell him that it's really important for you to get a gift on your birthday if it is. some guys just don't care about that sort of stuff. i know a guy crazy about his girlfriend, but he just is not into gift giving for special occasions. i actually know more than one like that.  <br>  <br>  if you've told him several times you need a break and are arguing, he must be used to it and less panicked and less afraid of you leaving him and might also thing your saying you need a break could be a gameplaying of yours and maybe he dislikes this sort of manipulation.  <br>  <br>  i don't know about the friend out of jail. that seems more worrisome to me.  hanging out with friends is not so strange. can be a good balance even.|`|Tp8o9gP3aa	I think he loves you, its just that he is not romantic.<br>  And I think he wants to go out with his friend because he is trying to make him feel better.|`|Xf93fRTTaa	Guys, when they are not freshly plucked from a romance novel, do not typically do all of those romantic things on a daily or even weekly basis. Sometimes not even monthly. <br>  <br>  You just have to decide whether or not you're happy enough with him to accept that. Especially if he doesn't have all that much money.<br>  <br>  Also, if he's hanging out with someone who just got out of jail, that's bad news.<br>  <br>  Maybe a break up would be a good idea.|`|mCQx7Co5aa	he is a man!<br>  <br>  youy dont expect them all to be romantic. him not buying you roses isnt because he loves you less now, it's just that he cant be bothered or forgets<br>  <br>  i dont think you should make this a big problem|`|yyIVrngcaa	your asking for too much, and one also needs their friends every once in a while or else boredom and tension kicks in..|`|ASXeYOjAaa	This is why children shouldn't date.|`|S0APZr5Aaa	Maybe hes just loosing intrest or maybe hes just not a romantic kind of guy not all guys are romantic. I think because his jail friend came out hes been wanting to spend time with him rather than you which is why he cares less about issues regarding your relationship.

9tdaV0uBaa	well you can meet new people have tons of topics in your head from like the news don't start any conversations about religion or race don't even ask what they like of something at first because chances are you guys probably have different ideas of something. Also be nice and only have good humor. One more thing don't act like someone else at first because that can hurt you later on.

8XKmMBU7aa	Why don’t you want to watch TV<br>  Please Start watching TV, movies, You Tube etc.<br>  Ideas will automatically come in your mind.<br>  <br>  Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|OUVUU5xRaa	Hang in there, it's hard to fit in a new school.  It sounds like maybe you're choosing the wrong group to fit in with.  Can you try to make friends with other kids besides this group?  If they're going to judge you by the size of your house and what you have/don't have, you don't need them anyways!|`|1I6xFREWaa	I completely agree. These girls don't sound very nice to me, and I'd maybe try a different group (or even one girl) and see how you get on. Is there a teacher you have bonded with at all that you feel you can trust? If so, you could perhaps speak to him/her and tell them that you are finding it difficult to mix with your classmates, and ask if they could perhaps place you on a table during group work with somebody they think you might get along with. Teachers are there to help.<br>  <br>  Perhaps there's a hobby you could get involved in after school, too.<br>  <br>  I don't know where you are based, but there is bound to be a local youth centre, too. Youth workers are trained to help young people with all different sorts of problems and they might also be able to help. It might be worth popping in and they might be able to give you advice, or better yet, introduce you to people at the centre! They would also be able to listen to anything else you would like to get off your chest, such as issues at home, if you would find that helpful.<br>  <br>  I'm really sorry this is going on at the moment. I went through it too and know how it feels. To be honest, senior school can be really bitchy, and even the most popular girls feel like they are lonely, talked about and not included at times. I promise it will get easier as you get older. You sound like a lovely person, and it's really this group's loss, not yours.

2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	Just don't tell her where you got the dress.  As long as it's the same color and style as the one she picked, why should she care?  After all, it's presumably only been worn once before, so it will look brand new.  In this economy, she should be glad that her friend was able to think outside the box and come up with an acceptable, affordable way to still be in her wedding.  And may I say how lucky you are for being able to find the dress you needed, in exactly the right size, color and style???  I am amazed!!!<br>  <br>  Oh, by the way, I noticed that a few other people on here mentioned that the dresses may not match because they were dyed at different times.  While that's true, the difference in color will be so imperceptibly small that nobody, not even the bride, will notice unless she's some kind of psycho holding a swatch up to every bridesmaid to get an EXACT match!|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	The bride may want you to order as a group from David's so your dresses are from the same dye lot.<br>  <br>  Why not tell the bride you found the dress elsewhere at a discount and would she mind if you bought it or would she prefer that you order with the rest of the bridesmaids.<br>  <br>  IF she is having you all wear the exact same dress, dye lot might be an issue.<br>  IF she is not having you all wear the same dress then it won't matter as much and I say buy it on eBay.<br>  <br>  My fiance and I bought the bridesmaids dresses for our girls (alterations are on them) - - I managed to find two of the girls dresses, new & never worn, on eBay for waaaay less than retail : )|`|HJ0YTWjVaa	I have been in many weddings and I sell the dresses on ebay after wards to new bridesmaids. I only wear the dress once and someone else can safe big and I get some cash. The last one I sold for $30 and then gave the girl the other bridesmaids email addresses so she could see about getting all the dresses. I would do it! Ask your friend, but really why would she care? If she cares that much then she should pay for it!|`|w1necKzYaa	well there could be variations on color but I don't see any problem with it!|`|XVljoYZ5aa	I say order the dress. Check it with another bridesmaids to make sure it does match (sometimes dying dresses is not as consistent as it should be). Then let the bride know if it works, if not, shell out the cash for the dress at Davids. Its only $20 on ebay, so your not really losing much, but you may save a lot if its correct.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	Sure go for it but make sure you tell her first...and explain your situation...|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	thing is, all the bridesmaids dresses have to be ordered at once or they may not be dyed the same exact color.  will it show up in her wedding pics?  probably not.  if you're the only other bridesmaid then go ahead and get teh $20 dress.  but I would clear it with the bride first.  she'll be pissed you didn't let her know you were ordering your dress on your own.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Depends.<br>  <br>  Usually the whole bridal party will get together and get measured and order their dresses at the same time.<br>  <br>  But, if she told you the dress and told you to buy it when you can, I wouldn't see the issue.<br>  <br>  My only concern is, be very cautious.. $20 seems really cheap from the $200 asking price...  Is it used?  If so, be careful that there are no stains, or rips, etc.  And that it is the same color.<br>  <br>  Reason why most bridesmaids should order at the same time, so that the dresses are using the same color dye.<br>  <br>  I might ask the Bride just to be on the safe side....  <br>  <br>  If it was me, I'd be happy my bridesmaid found a deal!!  But, I would want to look it over and double check that everything seems to be true.  And then, if it turns out to be a disaster, still have her buy the real one at David's Bridal.
AA11085356	Just go with the flow...  There isn't a list of 'things to do after I get a boyfriend' or something. Just have fun with him.|`|AA11185479	There isn't anything you're supposed to "do next."  Just enjoy it.  Go out on dates, hang out with him, treat him as a special friend.  Be nice to him, give him sincere compliments.<br>  Don't do anything you aren't comfortable with, and don't do it just because he asks.  You don't have to do anything physical, and you sound too young to be doing anything physical anyway.  <br>  Be honest with your family about your relationship - there is nothing wrong with having a boyfriend, and you don't need to hide anything.|`|yFSv9sfgaa	You sound young. Don't let him force you to do anything. And don't feel like you have to makeout with him or whatever to make him stay. This is a learning experience. It's always nice to know that someone finds you attractive and wants to be around you but to be honest? The more emotion and yourself you put into a relationship that 95% likely won't last, the more it will hurt in the end. Enjoy his friendship and company.|`|s0DQahvgaa	try talking with him on how to work on your relationship it might help to feel better if you both sorted out your differences. Since your family already knows you  guyz are going out and stuff why dont you  invite him over for dinner or something try doing things together regularly!

You could write "Give me a call!" then your number and name.  <br>  <br>  He comes in, you say "Hi!" and "here, this is for you" and hand it over.  Smile at him then go about your business.  I think he'd call at least once, just because of your boldness!  Unless he's committed.  <br>  <br>  If he doesn't call, then you may feel a little embarrassed, but you don't have to say anything, just keep crushing.  <br>  <br>  Remember, if you DON'T give him your number, he definitely won't call.|`|WTWSyqXgaa	Write it on a package you send to yourself.

Follow your heart, thats all I can say.|`|DBrNaYNyaa	make a list, pros and cons.<br>  Whoever makes you the most happiest and makes you smile and laugh everyday. <br>  Hes the one.<br>  <br>  <br>  (be careful your ex isnt just saying that now because he is lonely and just wants you back 'for now'..make sure he wants the real deal!)|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	dump him<br>  he has psychological problems<br>  and dump the ex too<br>  he is an ex for a good reason|`|oche3k5taa	Thats a hard choice.<br>  I think you definetely need to have a little while to sit in silence and think about your curtrent relationship, and ask yourself do you really love him? 10 years is a really long time, so if your still questioning, you may not. You may just be so used to him being around that you just feel right.<br>  But if your feelings are coming back for your ex, you probably still have love for him.<br>  its a hard choice, but its upto you and your heart. <br>  if you want to be with your ex, your going to have to break the news to your significant other.  it may hurt, but you cant remain in a relationship that you arent completely happy in.|`|LLSSv2Oyaa	Go for the ex.

FJyLVazVaa	I think you need to let your husband in on whats going on. Then take a break from the friend.  You, your hubby, and new baby come first.  The friend needs to realize that. Plus...sometimes, some people just can't change.|`|uJ6lHPjlaa	The husband should not decide at your place about what you need and what not. do your break. your husband should have confidence on you. knowing that you are not a bad hearted woman. if he has a problem with it so it is suppect.( if she like the women over your wellbeing so maybe he loves her).<br>  Moreover, your friend should see a psychiatrist, and learn to grow up and struggle for her problems alone without stressing anybody.|`|D33VRTz8aa	Congrats!!<br>  <br>  I think You should speak to your husband and say I only wish to take it easy until the end of the pregnancy. As I am sure your husband wants healthy and lively baby too. so it is very important for you to be happy and not take any stress. <br>  <br>  I also suggest you speak to your friend. Tell her to help you through your pregnancy this way your friend and your husband will understand. By your friend helping you through you pregnancy this may also help her. You never know!!
Z9oDWMP3aa	Speaking from experience, moving to a new town is horrible at first.  It took me a solid year before I started feeling more comfortable and like I belonged.  The best I can say is don't give up and keep yourself out there trying to meet new people and eventually you'll find some good friends.  And I hope you can still talk to your best friend so she can give you some support.|`|gU8pP7d5aa	You are going to have to make you some new friends i know you don't like it there but holding herself hostage in your room is not going to help.or ask your mom to take you to the movies maybe you will get to find you some new friends to talk too|`|X6C6kZKKaa	just keep looking for that job. friends will pop up soon.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	I'll be your online friend if U like|`|B6cOlFU9aa	I know how you feel, I cooped myself up in my room when I went states away to college, and I really regret it.

Good luck, stop calling and having contact with her, she will get the hint.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	don't worry, in your long ahead future life, you'll make tons of different friends, and break up with them later, and reunion, and all that. <br>  <br>  right now, just enjoy your childhood or teenage time and stuff. life's short, have fun now.<br>  <br>  make new friends if she doesn't wanna be ur friend.|`|j3DqJ2BBaa	calm down <br>  <br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aksg_y4FNIyphwTy4NEmO5cgBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090304111208AA5qfAr">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|Lk7TpfMKaa	Usually people are like this if they're insecure with themselves. Has she had any problems recently? If so, try talking about it and even if not, tell her how you feel and that she is hurting everyone's feelings. If she doesn't see past that, people will eventually see her for what she is and she will be friendless. However, if you spread rumours about her then that is no better than what she's been doing.<br>  Good luck!|`|u7LSohRyaa	Something's wrong with her. Maybe you want to find out what. Otherwise, tell her how you expect her to act and leave it at that.|`|PhKzejntaa	I wouldn't even go near her and wouldn't talk to her, even on the phone.|`|dd6rgtL7aa	So, whats your question?|`|xJPPZh7Saa	being friends with someone for that long isn't common because people change<br>  i've had a friend for 11 years now who changed completely about a year ago - she  doesnt seem to care about anyone but herself anymore so i've distanced myself from her<br>  if you and your other friend stick together and just stop involving her in things then she'll soon move away from you. (and she doesn't really have an argument for you not involving her, just say that you wanted to spend some time with your other friend)<br>  if you don't spend so much time around her she'll be more bearable.<br>  I know it sounds harsh to just stop being friends but when people change like that for so long then its usually just the way they'll be for the rest of their life - best to put some distance between teh two of you than stop talking altogether ovet an argument (which will definitely happen if you bottle up your thoughts and try to put up with her)|`|ODZbUn3yaa	This girl is bad news, i was friends with a girl like this for many years. I felt i had to stay mates with her as she was generous with money but behind my back she only put me down. And when i met a decent guy she set out to split us up even trying it on my wedding day.<br>  <br>  You need to ditch this so called friend, let her deal with her issues its not your problem.|`|eYzuxqQaaa	i think that shes jealous of you and your friends friendship. either that or shes just a *****|`|K9hVqE7Haa	Just don't be ignore her...|`|XNEh9GVlaa	i dont know what the question is;but i wouldnt call that a real friend at all;!!|`|Di6FAQxRaa	WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION? DUMDUM.|`|S1CLLs4Laa	what is ur question or r u just letting it out?|`|AKeoxOXiaa	A friendship like that isn't worth having if she is being really mean but if you want to be friends with her then talk and say how you feel and then if she doesn't you could just leave her to it. It isn't fair that shes being horrible when you've done nothing wrong. As long as you have other friends you'll be fine otherwise why stay friends with someone you can't stand ?!?<br>  Hope that helps<br>  Good luck :)|`|wApfe0hoaa	talk to her about it.<br>  invite everyone over and sit and just talk about everything that's on your mind.<br>  she might be having problems of her own that yall don't know of.<br>  talk it through, and see what she has to say about things.<br>  <br>  it should work out fine.<br>  i had the same problem and all my friends sat down and basically told each other how we feel about everything, we're closer than ever now.|`|YT9vgUNbaa	Talk to her about how you feel... nicely, but firmly. <br>  If she realizes she's being a jerk, she may try to change, and your friendship may be preserved.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you'll lose a friend. But it sounds like you already have.|`|zog4pnOuaa	if u dnt wanna be a total ***** to her just sit her down and talk to her about wat she is doing if that doesnt work than you gotta be str8 up wit her and say wats really on ur mind<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|Od8OJatyaa	shes probably just insecure about herself<br>  talk to her|`|VISJdrMraa	dude just cut the girl loose. its clear that she has some issues with you so why be friends with someone who gonna talk **** about you.|`|mSa6695Maa	i think that if she tak about you, tell her to change and if she dont that you cant be friends.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK! :D|`|NV6q8hQpaa	are you sure she is still your friend or is she just messing with you|`|bnGYp0gPaa	this is a statement.
96ZfDF6Aaa	The question is, do you like him and from what you've said I'd have to say the answer is no.  He's confused and playing games.  He needs a lot of maintenance that no grown man should need.  He pulls you close then pushes you away.<br>  <br>  There's no consistency so you can't trust what he feels from one day to the next.  This guy isn't the guy for anyone.<br>  <br>  Being burned repeatedly in relationships is different from having a relationship not work out.  It means he repeatedly chooses women who hurt him which means he has issues that aren't listed here.<br>  <br>  He makes you doubt yourself and that's reason enough to move on.  <br>  <br>  A relationship should be consistent, loving, mutual in maturity and it should spur your growth.  He can't be any of this for you.  He's too needy and dysfunctional.  You're doing all the care-giving.  Unequal equals unhealthy.<br>  <br>  Nice guys don't always make good partners, so while he may have a good heart, the rest of him is messed up.  You can't save him or change him.  If you keep seeing him he will only get worse and you won't be able to give yourself what you need because you'll be too busy always taking care of him.|`|Tuv79aXWaa	He sounds like to much to handle. His drinking could majorly get in the way also. <br>  I would just let go, trust your heart... because it shoulds like it's telling you that you need to just let go and find somebody that won't do that to you, because thats what you deserve!|`|03NGPPeTaa	He does not want ur ugly azz ***** and all he wants u for is to have *** but i guess that not going to happen so keep on stepping forward *****!!!!!|`|83dordyOaa	I'm in a similar situation and I feel your pain.  The truth is...and I'm finding it hard to live with my own advice but I know it's the truth...you can't make him change his mind.  Only he can do this.  If it's making you miserable and stressing you out, it isn't good for you.  You can love who you want but you always have to love yourself more and do what's right for you first.  He'll either come around or he won't.  One thing to consider is that sometimes it's a blessing that we don't get everything we think we want...|`|xcJwxyRRaa	sorry, sweetie, you've found an emotional wussbag, aka, a wussy ..an insecure emotional drunken wreck!...<br>  and should be running from him in the other direction as soon as as fast as you can..do not stop until you run into the next guy you're attracted to and clicking real good with...and you prob know where he is rt now, huh?!   <br>  there's your answer plain and simple and in a nutshell...<br>  now ...GO!. do not look back..<br>  you simply say to him..."I'm sorry, I'm not feelin" it.. .maybe we'd be better as friends"<br>  He'll get it..if he doesn't he will when he doesn't see you much anymore and don't answer his call/texts/ IM's..|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	This guy sounds like he's going to be emotionally exhausting.  I'd say if he doesn't get his act together, go find someone else to date.  You shouldn't have to work so hard at it.
acj9mB9Paa	It shouldn't matter a bit if you were rich, poor or middle class.  My husband and I don't have a lot, but he treats me like a princess and I love him for that!  If there was another guy out there that would treat me just as well and was rich I would stay with my husband 100%, simply because I love him!  THAT is the type of girl YOU need! <br>   <br>  If she chose to stay with that guy then she has some serious emotional issues that you just can't fix.  SHE has to want to fix them!  <br>  <br>  Go by, say hi, and see if there is anything you can do to help her in her life as a friend.  If it turns into something else great, if not, at least you got your friend back!|`|lj3e3rE4aa	If I were the broad in the lambo, I'd fly right past your crybaby self and make sure to hit a puddle so it splashes you.  You are a joke.|`|50dfad07d8ee2b10b7bb6c48c0f62037aa	I know your feeling man. I had my heart broken many times before too.<br>  <br>  However, I came to notice something. Something I wasn't aware of back then. Have you ever noticed that she might have not left because she was afraid her boyfriend would seriously try to hurt her if she ever left him? <br>  <br>  This came to light when I took an anthrology class in college. Men beat women to keep them under control but more importantly it is to keep them from running off.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  What would she think of you if you were rich? Not much apparently. If she was materialistic, she would have left the abusive guy ages ago before he had a chance to control her.|`|FhrCLLzFaa	Shes an idiot.<br>  Money doesn't even have to do with anything.<br>  It is all who treats you better, and you sound like that guy.<br>  Give up on her man she obv isn't worth it.<br>  Go find someone who is going to love you for you and not be with someone who doesn't treat her right|`|X3K25srLaa	if i truly loved u i would have already looked for you... i noticed that you mentioned material things.. love doesn't come for what you have it comes from who u r... so there u go.. gl|`|RLXP4kwnaa	i'd be afraid that the b/f would kill me if I left him.|`|oche3k5taa	If she was smart, she would have realized that you were the good guy.<br>  ans and she would have went and done whatever she could do to find you.<br>  your lambourghini wouldnt mean much to a sweet girl who really loved you.<br>  but it would probably make her mad, sence she didnt have much of a heart to begin with.|`|7zIAKszxaa	first of all my deepest simpathies ?<br>  i hope everything goes ok for you but i would say tell her how you feel<br>  about you guys never talking now ok good luck
dqZrq7Zeaa	I'd do nothing. <br>  Is money everything? You sell yourself short.... it seems that her affections should be for sale? It should be about you.. not what you own.|`|DgFhlJvYaa	You need to talk to her about it. If you love her then try to make the best of thing's. You sound like a great guy & you should show her that your alway's gonna be there for her. & who know's maybe then she'll relize your the one she want's.|`|57Wnlfv7aa	I would come to you and tell u that I love and that i can't stand anymore with the other guy and apologize to you :))  ?|`|9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	My opinion if you were really a good friend you would hope she got away from that bad guy and is living a good life now.  You would hope she would feel proud of you and that's it.
qDl5Gegbaa	Ask her a question you may need help solving...it will make her feel good to know you value her advise, answer or opinion<br>  how was your day/work/school<br>  What did she do today<br>  What are you doin up so late<br>  Ask her about any activities she's in <br>  Ask her how busy her day was and why<br>  Ask her if she'd like to get together on a weekend or get her number<br>  <br>  Try and ask open ended questions<br>  <br>  1 - Mention the new release movies at the theatre, or ask if he/she has seen a particular movie lately. This area can lead to a whole range of other subjects that you will both enjoy. <br>  2 -Talk about politics. It is a hairy topic, but if you keep in mind that everyone is entitled to his/her opinions, then the subject can be an exciting way to have a conversation. <br>  3 - Open the conversation with: "Have you seen the news last night?" It is one of the best way to break the awkward silent. <br>  4 -  Talk about sport. Express your like or dislike about a certain game, not the player. Sometimes, you may not like Tiger Woods, but he could be your acquaintance's idol. <br>  5 -  Ask about television shows. There are many different shows to talk about. You will find out what your friend likes, and she/he will find out about your dislikes. <br>  6 -  Talk about automotive. Most people like to voice their opinions about car manufacturers, and how good or bad they have experienced as consumers (ehow.com)|`|gAC9Ish8aa	ASK HER MORE QUESTIONS. <br>  <br>  LIKE: How are you?, How you been?, Whats new in your life? Do you have any brothers and sisters? Do you have pets? Whats your fav color? Fav music? Fav movie? etc...<br>  <br>  Ask her those questions. And there is plenty of questions that you still can ask her.  Or just come front her. Tell her that you like her and that you want to get to know her more.|`|CugCzH9iaa	Do you have her email or my space/ facebook address?  On there you can send her questionares and find out lots more about her.  Do you know some of the same people as her?  Talk about them to get her talking.  All you need is one or two things you know she likes to get her talking about herself.|`|FhrCLLzFaa	Ask her about her hobbies.<br>  Girls love it when you let them talk about themselves.<br>  But make sure you talk back a lot so she knows you're paying attention.|`|U3gebnDLaa	íf you have classes in common, ask her about them, ask for homework help, talk about random things, funny things, just make her smile|`|JlDcVTVsaa	you can ask her some questions about her self or the things you know she does.<br>  <br>  like ask how was school today?<br>  or how was your exam? <br>  <br>  and when she asks whats up with you dont say nothing, say some thing like i saw this movie yesterday....<br>  or some thing funny happened in school today...<br>  <br>  and if she is interested, she will continue talking to you.
pP9vkokgaa	the main thing which matters is the right understanding ,,, if a person can understand your feelings and can take care of you ,,the matter of shy and quiet guy  will not seem that much important to you !!|`|ea599a3bab257d34bbe640e49222c626aa	go for the shy one.....|`|PccHbsKbaa	go for an outgoing guy|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	Don't stereotype the guy before you meet them. Think of it this way; you say you have two sides to yourself. You wouldn't want a guy to meet you and say... oh this girl is shy, I want someone who's more outgoing. Be willing to go with either type and get to know them. There's far more important things than personality type as well, like whether they're good people you can trust and enjoy sharing in common interests.|`|DBrNaYNyaa	if you go for a outgoing guy, woudl you be comfortable always doing stuff together and with others?<br>  Or if you went for the shy guy would you enjoy it more just the 2 of you, more quality time?!|`|nmiXLhwCaa	Whichever one you are more compatible with, one you are the most attracted to.|`|7BoXLwIkaa	try out going opposites attract and you never know what may happen :)
585b7dfd77e867b2877fe507e55eb149aa	If I were your mom, you would be my favorite. Why? Because you cleaned the house even though you had to put up with your bratty sisters to do it. I'll bet your mom depends on you a lot more than you know. And she is proud of you for being the way you are. Food can be replaced. Ignore your bratty sisters. And know that YOU are the one mom needs the most. Sometimes us moms are so busy to remember to thank the ones that help us. But it doesn't mean we don't appreciate you. Good luck honey.|`|m4YoXNEMaa	that sounds bad.  Maybe try family counseling.|`|AA11328507	Talk to your mother and let her know that your sisters are being mean and how it makes you feel.
AA11185479	NO, this is not normal or appropriate.  Even a teacher you are friends with should NEVER touch you or call you sexy.  <br>  Tell the teacher that his behavior is inappropriate and unwelcome.  Go directly to the head of his department, and tell him everything about the incident.  Request that you be moved to a different class, if possible; if not, request that your tests and work be reviewed by someone else to ensure that you are not penalized for reporting this sexual harassment.<br>  <br>  Don't just let this slide - the teacher will continue to harass other students until he faces consequence for doing so.  Your courage now protects not only yourself, but other young women.|`|39e9235b89c9b80c32eb4b4082db80ccaa	i think it's pretty apparent this is not normal.  report him to the dean of the college, his tenure will be revoked, and he will be fired.<br>  <br>  speak up when someone makes you uncomfortable.  don't let yourself be a victim.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	No, it is absolutely not normal, if you don't want this sort of attention from him, if you have told him you don't want that sort of attention from him and he persists, then it is sexual harrassment.  Best to quit the study sessions and find some other way.  Also better to see if you can complete this course in a different class.  If not, if he tries it again, inform him you're not interested in this sort of attention, and if he won't back down, then you need to advise the dean's office and go from there.|`|yFSv9sfgaa	That is not normal. Don't have study sessions with him in his office anymore. And if he continues, don't confront him about it because he could try and blackmail you, talk to a higher authority. Don't take it.|`|NCNPlKxLaa	report him, the better you do it now; you wont regreat it. If you go further then you would be blamed for not reporting.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	report it to the school right away by doing this you are helping a lot in avoid what he could of done to other students now and future.

I know lots of girls who always do that for no reason at all and are just plain rude. Why would she "worry" and tell you he's cheating when she doesn't even know you that well.. unless she's like a really nice, caring person.(I'm guessing you're not friends?) Just ignore what she said. And trust whoever you trust more.|`|6jgjZEB2aa	Just give him some time to think over things and decide.<br>  <br>  Hope for the best.|`|igrdohopaa	Don't chase him.

TpxtE1v0aa	How old are you first of all.  You must realize that parents have rules for their children and they might not be able to express themselves correctly to explain to their children their motives.   It is hard for a frustrated parent to calmly sit down and discuss thigs with their children.  I know personally.  What you can do is maybe wait until he is in  calm mood and say is it okay if we have a conversation one on one without any lecturing and yelling?  Maybe he will be more willing to listen to your reasons instead of jumping to his own conclusions and getting upset.  But at the same time you need to be listening to everything that your father is trying to tell you too.  Good luck.|`|Mf2YLNyEaa	sell it if you want to. it is yours|`|PyRxe9B2aa	If you want your Dad to realize that you have a mind of your own.  STOP asking him for permission to do what you want to.(You said I told him I want to sell my....    why did you tell him? You know that's when he starts telling you what to do. Next time DO what you want to then say I sold my OR even wait until he asks you where is your--- And say I sold it.)  Treat yourself  to making up your mind and doing what has to be done without talking to him about it before HE WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO GROW UP UNTIL YOU DO IT WITHOUT HIS HELP OR PERMISSION.|`|856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	Honey, you may have your own mind, but right now it's his way or the highway!  You are a child.  He is your father.  When you grow up, you will realize  how silly you were to question his authority, especially when you have children of your own.  You don't make your own decisions when you live at home with your parents, and are a child.  That's life.  So accept his decision and enjoy being a child while you can.  Some day life will be complicated and you will wish he were there for you making your decisions.  Don't be a brat.  Don't try to pit your parents against each other,  and don't pout and whine about their decisions.  One day they will be gone.  Just get over it....and be a kid.|`|njz5XFG2aa	My dad is just like that,Maybe if you tell him a reason you want to save the money such as college,car,ect.<br>  <br>  It works with my dad hope it helps.|`|1jQ0EiFYaa	just say"dad look I never use the ps2 so whats the point in having it if im not using it eny way i want to save the money because i need it
cdcd103254b1bd3e7cf99abfef032235aa	You talk about people you don;t like to make yourself feel better. When you don't feel good about yourself it can make you feel better to say that someone is worse than you. Work on your self confidence and you'll feel no need to talk about anyone.|`|uBssj3Znaa	If you don't like someone, don't waste your time on them. Worry about your own life.|`|D2cCZVQXaa	Sometimes it's just best to write things down instead of saying them. But if you were to say something about someone, say it to them, not other people. If you weren't ready for confrontation you probably shouldn't have said anything at all. <br>  And as for the person who spread the word, avoid talking to them about those kind of things. Obviously they aren't your "best friend".<br>  And since you don't like the person you were talking about anyway, there's no need to worry about anything unless she tries to retaliate. If she does, either ignore her, or simply talk to her. If that doesn't work than you proved a point about them. :D
PyRxe9B2aa	Calm down. Your mother loves both you and your sister and like any good mom she will  "seem" to care more for the one who needs it the most at any given time. Who do you love more your mon or your dad? Well if one gets sick or has a problem that the one you love more on that day but basically you love them both the same. Do not feel slighted your sister has more problems than you do and she is getting the most attention now.  When you are most needy you will be the one getting all the attention. Just be glad to have a loving mom. Best of everything is my wish for you. Good luck too.|`|TpxtE1v0aa	I apologize that you have to even go through somethin like that.  If your mother truley was concerned about both of you then she would be able to understand your mental state of mind and should know that it is not your fault, but it seems like everyone is holding it against you anyway.  Your sister being an alcoholic, drug and sex addict, obviously has some mental issues herself and maybe your mother is just trying to get her on the streight and arrow because she knows that there is nothing that they can do for you except but to understand and work with you.  I am a mother of three and I dont like to treat any of my children different from the ohter.  Im sure your mother cares for you both but probably doesnt know how to deal with two children who both have mental issues.  I know how mental issues can be hard to deal with, I grew up with an older brother with genetic schitzophrenia and he had a severe case.  He used to beat me up all the time and he is 11 years older than me!  it was my other brother that saved me all of the time not my mom.  She treated me like an outcast because I had ADHD supposadly and all she wanted to do was medicate everyone.  Some people just dont know how to deal with these types of issues.  Good luck

Intentionally messing up your own house is petty and immature.|`|851c6ba054fa621b9fc32855c092c444aa	Move out to somewhere for a while. If he ask you to come back, ask him if the house is tidy yet, cos you're not coming home til it's clean.|`|w8Fdk02maa	Doing things out of spite just to get back at someone you are fighting with is a childish thing to do.<br>  <br>  Even when I am fighting with my wife and i'm angry with her and still show her love even when its hard because not only is it the quickest way to resolve our issues but it lets her know that i'll always love her no matter what. When my wife is angry at me I do the best I can to make her happy and keep that going.<br>  <br>  Your husband seems to be very childish in THIS aspect and you need to let him know this but in the nicest way possible lol.<br>  <br>  IDEA 1:<br>  <br>  Hun, I wanted to tell you how I feel about something. You know when we fight?? I feel like you are extra messy on purpose and I just wanted to know if my feelings are true? Is it that you want to get back at me or is it that you are just worried about other things to realize that you are being more messy?<br>  <br>  IDEA 2:<br>  <br>  Hun, Can you tell me why you are extra messy when we are fighting? It is something that I struggle with.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	You should try harder to walk away from the fight and return once the heat is off.  Your sanity will remain in check and he won't be so inclined to immaturely make a mess of things.  The best disagreement is one that's thought over while cooling off since most are over relatively minor things.|`|FzFSzilmaa	he just wants to mess with your head.. :D mess up something he likes... ;)|`|ea599a3bab257d34bbe640e49222c626aa	ignore his tis attitude for sumtime.....aftr sumtime to attract ur attention he will try to keep house clean...

I suppose whenever you get that "feeling" you should call your man and only him lol|`|NvnddPONaa	I feel really bad for your future husband. How do you think having sex with a billion guys is going affect him. He wanted to be the first, and you can't give it. Clean up now and stop having sex. The bible says not to have sex before marriage. I find God is a big support. <br>  And after you've had sex, you can never be a virgin again. You can just stop having sex. Ask your friends to help you. Break up with your boyfriend. He isn't worth it if he doesn't love you enough to wait for marriage.|`|Q6nOeK6Caa	well i can't blame him for breaking up with yu,yu slept with every guy yu met? Yeaah girl,ur ADDICTED ,ur gonna catch a disease if yu keep going at this rate.

b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	You weren't the only one to see her My Space status. The other idiot she meant it for also answered her and she changed it for that girl.|`|707gOCvbaa	Call and ask her? Her behavior was weird but something teed her off and best to find out now. If she refuses your call then leave her be to sort out her own mess.|`|B7kPUmUWaa	Ask her. That would be the easiest way to find out. Try calling or texting her. It would be easier just to ask straight up instead of trying to figure it out.|`|rv5vSzXuaa	ask her. just go up to her and remind her that time about the myspace thing and ask "were you mad at me?" and work it out from there.|`|S8Qpiabdaa	u probley said something about her to someone and she found out|`|19JRf8Cxaa	I know you are going to get a lot of this, but you really have to talk to her about this. The only way to fix a problem is to confront it.<br>  <br>  Tell her that you saw her status message on myspace, and would like to know what it is about. If she doesn't want to tell you, respect that. It is okay to ask her if the message was about you, you have a right to know. If she says it wasn't about you, respect that. I'm sure she wouldn't lie to you if you wanted to fix whatever the problem was.|`|Tuv79aXWaa	well, personally when I dont' reply it's because I have my mind set on somebody else (like she did with mac) to talk to. Sometimes I feel as if people are being nosey and I dont' want to reply to them because they wouldn't understand as much and i'm already upset to begin with, I dont' want to spill my business to some people.<br>  <br>  that's probably all it is. <br>  more people then you probably asked her if she was okay.|`|w5F1hCdiaa	Talk to her. And if she ignores you, ignore her until she decided to talk to you. It's not that hard. If she is you true friend, she would've told you by now IF it was you.<br>  <br>  Take a deep breath, and breathe. You can figure it out!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|B6cOlFU9aa	If you can't think of anything that you did and she was normal to you at school, I don't think she is mad at you. She was probably so busy being dramatic last night that she ignored your comment and only talked to the people that she wanted to (ex: mac). She sounds like a really overdramatic friend, especially if she would rant about how mad she is at someone for everyone to see and give updates. I wouldn't want to be friends with someone like this, because its only a matter of time before she gets mad at you and posts your fight all over myspace
FXCoGD44aa	Oh my gosh, I feel EXACTLY the same way. I didn't watch the interview, but I read it online.<br>  <br>  I personally think it's child abuse. More than half of these kids have disabilities - all because she made the irresponsible and selfish decision because she "wanted" more kids cuz she "loved" them so much. Let alone how she is going to support these kids or pay all the medical bills she has racked up so far... how on earth is she going to divide her attention and cater to all of the other needs of these kids - ALL 14 of them? She can't. It truly would be within the best interests of these kids to let parents who unfortunately can't have kids adopt... but she of course won't do that... she "loves" them too much.<br>  <br>  I don't think this situation is really a reality for her yet. She lives with her mom who helps her take care of her 6 previous kids. The new 8 are still in pre-mature care in the hospital being taken care of by a full nursing staff 24/7. All she has had to do with them so far is just go there and hold them for a little while.<br>  <br>  I get wanting to have kids. My husband and I can't wait to have kids... but like you said, we are holding off because we know that we can't afford to give little him/her the BEST life we can give right now - even though we both have full time jobs. The economy is too unpredictable.<br>  <br>  Also, there are SO many single moms out there who have kids of there own... you don't see them out looking for charity. Charity isn't going to be able to support this woman and these kids for the next 18 years. What American can afford to GIVE money right now? - Not many. And no way would I invest a dime into this woman... she made her own mistakes, whether she acknowledges it or not. Cancer victims and neglected pets, I feel bad for. Someone who knowingly and willfully gives herself a LITTER of children that she can't handle, I don't.|`|503bfb516d2e66c3e0dc091e7f30ec63aa	i think the woman is nuts, but its not the kids fault so they should nt be punished, she is a self centered psycho, i try not to judge her, but jeez its so hard when she is out there all the time...i don't know whats going to happen, but someone that is in charge needs to step in, and take those kids from her...they will end up in the system anyway..sooner or later, alls i can do is pray for those kids....and i can pray for my self not to judge her so harshly...but thats my first opinion..|`|AA11938016	I do think she has some issues, and I didnt care for her much before I watched the dr. phill show with her and I now feel a little sorry for her I think she is just looking for love and attention and having kids gives her that I really dont think she thought she'd have 8 more kids and now I think she is worried about what she is going to do now, I think she shouldn't have had any more kids after having 6 already she cant care for but you know we all make mistakes maybe not as big as this one that will affect her childreen but all of us at some time do stupid things and then wish we could change it and I think she now knows what she did was probably stupid but it's done and now there are 14 kids who need help I do feel sorry for her mistake she made and hope things work out for
ze4Gt1araa	How cool I am about to be 17 lol.<br>  <br>  Well reguarding to your question I think he does like you just flirt with him a lot, smile a lot, and wink at him very often. And tell him the way you feel he shouldn't have a reason to reject you if he flirts with you and call you beautiful. Fight for what you want!<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|bTBIBTE1aa	It all depends on how cool your mom is. If she is a so called mellow mom then ask him out. If she is a I will pick on you for wanting to date him then you might want to think it over. You need to talk to him about it. It might be a hard task but if you really want this dude make it work. I like my mom and if I dating someone that she works with I would find it cool. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|c325AREXaa	if you like him,just try to talk to him,guys whi like to flirt,i don;t have much faith in them,just keep as friends.if you think he's really good to you,then maybe  you can give some signals to him that you want to be with him.|`|yCBpl2Jgaa	Flirst back or just ask him if he is free sometime to go out. IF YOU DONT ASK YOU DONT GET!!! Simple!! xx|`|MejdEPF9aa	Just try being yourself around him and smile lots (but not too much so he thinks you have something wrong with you LOL!) Flirt a bit, but not too much, then if it goes wrong you dont't lok like a twit. It sounds like he fancies you though. If he hasn't already got a girlfriend I don't see any harm in inviting him along with some of your other mates on a trip to the bowling alley or something? Never mind about him telling your Mum, you are 17 after all, and she was your age once!|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I don't think that there is a problem with him working with your mom at all. You are only a year younger then him and that's not bad at all. Just tell him how you feel either inperson or write him a letter explaining how you feel. Go for it!|`|AA10959572	If you act like the way you write, AND have to ask such questions on a public forum, then I'd say that you are childish.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but seriously, think about it for a moment.|`|MmSGeD2Eaa	JUST KEEP DOING YOUR THING BABE.....LOOK PRETTY KEEP LOOKIN AT HIM..TRY TO TALK A LIL CONVO HERE AND THERE NEVR MAKE IT BAIT THAT YOU LIKE HIM THOUGH...ITS THE MANS JOBS TO ASK YOU OUT...AND BELIEVE ME IF YOU PLAY HARD TO GET HE'LL FOLLOW!|`|eOWZdu6Waa	I think you are attrect with him<br>  you are just 17 so stop think about him if He loves you he will say you.<br>  atleast you are a girl, let him start to say anything. always|`|4W3v2fO5aa	hes flirting with you..giving you eye contact...telling your mum he likes you...

If you already have his number, try to see if you guys can go to lunch or grab a cup of coffee or something like that? If he says no and rejects you, it could be the fact that he works with your mom, or the fact that he's really just not feeling that way towards you. If he's not, then you'll know its not meant to be. Hope that helps!|`|5k62aEGUaa	Ask your mom for his #..<br>  Approach him in a nicest calmest way saying i heard so & so that you like me!|`|N1jVFCuSaa	take ur relationship up a notch and give him what he wants...fu%k him|`|4wnn2GbYaa	just tell him straightforward don't hide ur feelings guy like fiesty girls go for it u only live once...don't get put off that he works with ur mum..life ur life to the fullest he could be the ONE!!!|`|TJezsCkHaa	wait until he starts first.maybe you are just imagining this and you don't want to look bad.

HHyny0JSaa	Trsut me... looks are important. How can you be with anyone that you can't stand to look at. They are not the most important thing, but they are up there. No one wants to sound shallow by saying it. <br>  <br>  As you get older though, it's less about what other people think and more about what you think. Your friends may think a guy is the ugliest thing to walk the earth but you find him super hot. Looks are in the eye of the beholder.<br>  <br>  But you are not superficial, just honest.|`|GTeGDGzKaa	Looks get me interested but personality keeps me around<br>  <br>  SteveC|`|m3ThrbDMaa	(Suddenly a rap/rock fusion mix of sounds starts, and I answer your question in rappin' style with legitimate streetwise swagger...)<br>  <br>  Wade down deep, cliff dive the shallows,<br>  Melt away your plastic halo,<br>  What's inside is NOT what counts,<br>  Your soul's a check that's gonna bounce<br>  <br>  When you save yourself, you save the world,<br>  And you know you can do THAT, girl...<br>  Everything ends in the mirror,<br>  But window minds see much clearer<br>  <br>  But in the end, it's all the same,<br>  Climb a spiral staircase, with a broken rail<br>  "Heaven" is a brand new car,<br>  And only THAT will take you far, so<br>  <br>  Fill it up with "Supah!" Baby!...(pause)<br>  <br>  "Then burn it up again, Let's Fly!"<br>  <br>  Word...|`|G6Uy43coaa	The looks are important to the person who is interested in pursuing a relationship.  I could care less how my friends, co workers or family feel about how the man I love looks.  Some people are not that strong and have to have input and arrive at a consensus from everyone...that's just not me.  And I don't want a man like that either.  He will have failed in the personality department......|`|fF1WbPltaa	Initially all attraction is by looks. What else have you to go on? Later, as you get to know a person and form an opinion of their character, looks become less important.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	Sometimes you get all you want in one package like I did with Joejorob. Sometimes you have to compromise and just go with someone who will love you and treat you right whatever wrapping that person comes in. :)|`|UwQPH7eHaa	Everyone is attracted to people with good looks. It's our way of surviving because the children we have will look like our mates and no one wants to have children who are fat, ugly, or otherwise appear like they might not live a long and healthy life.|`|hVrGyD60aa	Well everyone goes after someone that they personally think is cute... but personality most definitely matters in the long run. It matters the mst. But go for someone you think is cute & if they have a great personality, then it's perfect! :)|`|wI3AAkIoaa	You can be attracted to someone all others think is not so attractive.  It is what is in the heart that matters... it may just be he was someone who you only felt a friendship with which is why you had not desires to kiss him.|`|mCQx7Co5aa	everyone says that until it happens to them, it's not true!<br>  <br>  i will not go out with someone too bad looking just because of his personality, my boyfriend is nice inside and out!<br>  so im one of the lucky ones<br>  lol<br>  <br>  goodluck!|`|T1ZxG3rcaa	If you cant even kiss him then dont pursue him.  Thats unfair to both of you.  It appears you should just be friends with him instead of going out with him.|`|54048f431e23af198481432570ea86bcaa	Wrong...everyone wants someone that they find attractive. Looks matter more to some than to others.|`|74gPuaXMaa	You have to find some sort of attraction or it will never work.|`|W6wamWLLaa	yeah girls are attracted to guys wth looks and money <br>  <br>  i am anyway|`|AA12197220	Initially looks matter. We all have different tastes and desires of what we want our mates to look like. A lot of women prefer men who are taller than they are. I myself prefer a broader shaped guy. Looks are what gets us first interested in someone. If you could not bring yourself to kiss him, maybe he isn't what your physically attracted to. <br>  <br>  However, with that being said, the more you know someone the more personality matters. Get to know him a little bit more. You might be surprised at how much you desire this guy in the end.|`|IBWKkgCfaa	I think its a mixture of the two...it'll never work if your not attracted to him in a physical way aswell as him having a great personality. <br>  Personally Im not completly attracted to looks but normally there has to be something thats phsically attractive in him.<br>  <br>  But then again all girls are different|`|ANEdyayCaa	I now exactly what you mean. I am in the same position. If we like them but don't want to kiss them, what's the point? I guess we should look for good guys with good looks. Too bad that kind of guys are rare! :) Good luck!|`|6jgjZEB2aa	Everyone is an individual some go for looks, some for behaviour, it depends which class you fall for.
Lk7TpfMKaa	Make him a collage of photos of you and him, or instead just 'interesting' pictures of you. Men like that kind of thing. Don't get aftershave or jewellery or restaurant reservations - he will find that boring, plus it's better to get your own aftershave, jewellery etc. A box set of his favourite film/soap/comedy series?|`|3OeE8kMQaa	A big bottle of booze and a dinner to give him a decent base.|`|d0526f2bf35299e2ac74512f8dff025faa	You must know him better than any stranger on YA<br>  Ask his Mum for advice.|`|8t7E9S1taa	give him what he probaly exspect  what guys exspect of v-day ( sex) put on some nice lingerie|`|u1qgyGFNaa	xbox360?|`|izbAdDUraa	cheap stripper from craigslist?<br>  :]<br>  but seriously. you are his girlfriend, you should know what he wants....<br>  <br>  i don't understand these questions. like we are supposed to know what to buy YOUR boyfriend?<br>  we don't know the dude.<br>  yeesh.
ze4Gt1araa	She should tell him she's sorry for making him feel bad and just tell him the way she feels for him and that if they get back together she doesn't want it to be a game she wants it seriously and that she'll try not hurting him anymore.|`|nKKOnEZPaa	ask her to talk it out clearly that what does he actually have in mind.if the guy talks hesitantly then tell her to withdraw from the relation since it would be of no use and would give her nothing but sorrow throughout her lifetime, which i think you would not want. am i clear enough?|`|eOWZdu6Waa	tell her to make clear all mistakes tonight|`|Sfr8R4OSaa	she just needs to be straight up and let him know how she feels|`|4wnn2GbYaa	don't let her GO that will be a HUGE mistake...he either is her boyfriend or NOTHING, there shouldn't be anyfink in between... please tell her this...he is gonna break her heart again...!!!!|`|XlhBBZPxaa	tough spot ummm sometimes love conqueres all <br>  my advice be there for her she might really need you one day but make sure she knows that you won't be there forever
OUVUU5xRaa	I know someone like this.  I usually try to counter anything negative with something positive.  Turn things around on her.  It can get exhausting though, if she doesn't catch on.  Your only other option is to tell her exactly how you're feeling.  There's not much else you can do.|`|MVVXvnq0aa	Get her talking to a psychologist..maybe have her go to a party or somewhere where she would be hitted on a lot so it can prove to her how attractive and appealing she really is..and tell her that you are there for her and that you don't appreciate how she doesn't appreciate you and that maybe she takes advantage of your friends sometimes.|`|D2cCZVQXaa	If she expects you to "listen" to her and be there for her, shouldn't she do the same for you? Confront her. It's never easy to deal with other peoples problems. It isn't even your responsibility. And it is likely that shes doing it for attention. Call her out on it.  Otherwise, there is no need for a relationship when someone can't be real with one another.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	I htink you should have a talk with her alone. Tell her " hey we've been good friends for a while but your constant negativity is bringing me down, i want to continue our friendship but i want you to stop being so negative all the time, it affecting me and my spirit", if you understand me like i do you then can you try to stop". you should approach her in a nice manner with no one around. hope i helped   ;)
zgQZJUHwaa	I completely disagree.. withholding sex is almost exclusively a female thing<br>  <br>  SteveC|`|krDklNF9aa	They can. Maybe it is fear. Maybe it is a step that they are not ready for. Maybe it is a religious thing. I personally am somewhat taken back by sexually "agressive" women. I am old fashioned that way. To me, sex is a form of commitment in the relationship. It isn't just an activity like brushing my teeth, or folding laundry. Cheap easy sex, that was the 70's, pre HIV/AIDS. A trip to the clinic if you got "the drip" and you were good to go. Now a days, I will just say it is different.|`|lj8PbJugaa	Honestly, I've never met one of those before.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Most men I know want to have sex asap... There may be one or two guys who want to take things slow. But, I actually really like guys who don't just think about sex and actually want to get to know me better before having sex with me. If you're looking for a relationship, taking things slow and not having sex straight away is the way to go.|`|2AAhiwgnaa	Not all guys love throwing their shlongs into any woman's heha! Some guys have deeper morals and like to wait for marriage or just want to know that the girl they are with is not using them or something. People are different. Guys are different. You are just going to have to work with it. Be patient|`|T3crw25kaa	Ahh, the old role-reversal question.  I'll just sit back and watch.<br>  <br>  <br>  Answered with doggy-style|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	why would a guy play that game!!!!!!!!!!!???????????????<br>  there is something else wrong that you are unaware of<br>  something desperately wrong|`|09Y8F6hQaa	Are you sure he isn't cheating?  When game playing comes into play, I wouldn't rule it out.
Y9djVW1Naa	I think sometime more private. If they are the last ones there at the end of the shower then I say do it then, but not if there are still heaps of people around.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	your idea is great i would do it that way. Have fun and enjoy.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	I totally agree with the other poster, that you could just do it in private. I think it would mean a lot if you went to their house quickly and told them in person you really appreciated all their support, and You love them , and you got them a little something to tell them how much this all means to you, remember that at your bridal shower, you will be announcing to everyone thanks for them coming and special thanks to your hosts, I suppose it might be nice to do it then, some people are more private tho, for myself, I think I would feel more comfortable sharing a special moment with my wedding party in private for this|`|ge3meKYEaa	Your idea is nice and your a wonderful person for wanting to share your day with the people whom matter to you.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	I think you should invite your bridesmaids out to a little lunch about a week before the wedding, and give them their gifts then.  It's not really proper to give them gifts at the rehearsal dinner in front of everybody anyway, since anyone who wasn't asked to be a bridesmaid might feel left out when they see what the maids got as a gift  Besides, a little all-girls luncheon right the week before would be such a great opportunity to really thank them and tell them all how much they mean to you, as well as to clear up any last-minute details you might wish to mention.|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	I am taking my attendants to a brunch to give them their presents and to thank them for their hard work and efforts.  If you don't think pizza night will do it, take them out to dinner or whatever.  You should not do it at the shower, that is the day they chose for you.  Do something extra special for them.  I know money is tight, on this end too but you know what, we live in PA and are getting married in Vegas; they bought dresses, shoes and are flying out to be in my wedding so I can spring for a brunch!|`|JizwgEiYaa	shower
jUfkkr7Aaa	he likes you.<br>  he will most probably ask you to the prom.|`|Dwhyo9yPaa	sounds like a stand-up guy... then again he might just wanna get in bed with you... nobody can tell how genuine or how evil one can be... until he shows true colours... be patient... spend more time with him... <br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|a1XEf8lKaa	Ask him, what do you have to lose?  If he say's no then so be it!  But I am sure that he will say yes so just grow some and ask him already|`|Q5hVEyfoaa	I know you want him to ask you,but if U really see the signs Ask Him he may be shy.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	Why dont you ask him to the prom instead of waiting to see if hell ask, dont lose him to another hoe. Its obvious he likes u.|`|UxU7qZGTaa	let him get to second base and find out....|`|dvevk1qbaa	no|`|xRyGMuXeaa	i think he does like u...its obvious.<br>  As far as him asking u, just have hope that he will :)|`|YT9vgUNbaa	And HOW is he giving you mixed signals?<br>  <br>  Seriously, this isn't a question.<br>  He likes you.<br>  It's horrifically obvious.<br>  <br>  About him asking you to the prom... why don't you just ask him yourself?|`|9isF0Nugaa	i think that its SO obvious he likes u<br>  u should just ask him already <br>  and if he likes you, go for it<br>  the worst he can say is no<br>  its better than wondering wat if...<br>  i did it and its worked out for years now|`|fpSGkfvEaa	He sounds like he maybe afraid ir too shy to ask. Maybe you shoukd ask him.|`|lCeboITcaa	Wait for him to ask, if he is feeling you that much then he will ask you ASAP|`|365d70b021fb625020b0fa8e63533e37aa	of course he likes you|`|mUhZxm8Jaa	Ask him yourself! he kinda looks like he is into you, try|`|tDDkQU3Faa	no you dumb ***** he just wants in ur pants-|`|uYJU9hwUaa	i think he's totally in to you<br>  and will probably ask you
t0rOQ5FWaa	No he's not cheating <br>  If i were your dad i would spank you|`|eWMn7dhKaa	Personally, I feel that business such as this belongs to the one that has initiated it and myself.  The mom does not need to find this out from ME (you) but from the husband (dad).<br>  <br>  What I would do is just generally say something to the effect of, "It would be, I think, a very bad thing to have to go through a divorce because of someone cheating in the marriage.  I (saw this show on tv/internet/heard from my friend) that it's not a good situation to live through."  Something like that would just randomly be blurted out when they were both around, you know what I mean?  So that there's no accusations going around, but you drop the hint that your dad should be able to pick up on that you know what's going on.|`|y4w6ybr3aa	He may have never even met this woman before, this could all be through the phone and internet.<br>  I wouldn't tell your Mom, but I would confront your Dad about it.<br>  Also, don't let him turn it around on you by getting mad at the fact that you snooped.<br>  Somebody tells you not to look at something, I think it just makes you want to see why even more|`|8GyivEanaa	Say hello to your new step mom Michelle|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well i realy dont know but i dont think so|`|AA12160073	M.Y.O.B.  That means "mind your own business".  Your a kid and you don't belong in your father/mother's relationship.  It's probably something simply innocent that you wouldn't understand.  If you do say anything, say it to your dad in private.  Like..."...hey Dad..I ran across some strange stuff on your computer/phone...you should be more careful with your files and passwords."  You have no idea what goes on between your father and mother.  And why would you want to stir up a bunch of juvinele sh*T anyway and make your homelife miserable?  You're way too nosey for your own good.  M.Y.O.B.  Your parents are not TEENAGERS!  Godloveya.
f8ON3dRfaa	Seems like this girl is playing the sympathy card, making you feel that you're not letting her off the hook!<br>  <br>  Well, you did your part in letting her know, in a nice manner and if she turns the table around, just tell her that sorry, you're not one who will fall for her antics.<br>  <br>  Yes you're happy and you've the right to be happy. Hope she will understand and move on.|`|RCfc9hMKaa	Uh oh... Don't communicate with her at all. No apologies, nothing, zip, zilch. She's trying to start drama and waiting for you to argue with her. If you can, block her from sending you messages and if need be, report her to facebook for harassing you. I would warn your boyfriend too that she's trying to pull that game so he can watch out for her if she starts trying to talk to him again.|`|T6HTHXbcaa	tell your boyfriend to stop text her at all<br>  <br>  and things is to tell her that you have a boyfriend<br>  <br>  and also check his cell phone between him and her text in outbox or sent <br>  <br>  so you will see what they doing in text|`|KtdlJbrOaa	It seriously was not your place to do that.  She's probably hurt & is lashing out at you.  She may feel like you are rubbing her face in it - whether you intended to or not.  Your boyfriend should have manned up & told her himself.|`|lSl2Arlpaa	just ignore her and dont reply and turn it into an argument and shes obviously hurt and jelous and to be honest it really wasnt your place to tell her to back off it was your boyfriends|`|X6C6kZKKaa	just go with what ever works for you. forget what others think.|`|GpWM0xmCaa	well your boyfriend should really explain it to her not you|`|rUsFKFQ8aa	Why exactly did you contact her in the first place??<br>  That is the job of your boyfriend.<br>  Put yourself in her shoes... what you think is a nice friendly message is actually a sarcastic hes mine type email. Imagine if you got the email you sent her from her in the months you broke up? how would you feel? pretty angry and upset i would imagine no matter how nice the message was. <br>  You have put the situation in a mess she is just giving as good as she gets. Remember this girl hasnt done anything wrong. She will get over you 2 being back together, just give the poor girl time to get her head round it and give her a break!|`|zu1DQNxZaa	You kind of have two choices really, just leave it, leave her to think what she wants of you, does it matter anyway, he's with you?! or i guess you could just message her again, maybe you got crossed wires and she misunderstood, you could explain you weren't trying to be rude, but just wanted to make the situation clear to her cos its unfair if she doesn't know hes taken now.|`|clsTSNkEaa	To be honest is your boyfriend still in touch with this girl if he isn't you really shouldn't see her as a threat, also isn't it enough that your boyfriend chose you over her you never know it might of hurt her quite bad. I'm not saying your a bad person for telling her to back off i mean you obviously really care for this guy and i'm sure you have nothing to worry about ;D|`|T28K68Hoaa	Block her number on ur phone and his and block her on facebook. Move on and do not bother answering her. She is not worth the stress or the Energy. That energy needs to go into ur relationship.|`|Tuv79aXWaa	She must really like your boyfriend, and must be hurt. <br>  Just ignore it, it will go away. <br>  Don't worry about her, worry only about yourself and the relationship that you want to make work.|`|oche3k5taa	just leave it alone,<br>  like you said, you have what you want. and you guys arent friends so she doesnt matter.<br>  ignore the messages hunny. shes just hating on you.|`|yZ24Z7zQaa	Don't reply, she's probably jealous as afterall you are her competition, and she is most likely dying for an argument with you!|`|kv3FrdS8aa	first i think u've done lets say hmm maybe good job<br>  u've could ask ur bf about her and he could tell her 2 back off himself and in that way it'll feel and look better 4 u and 4 her 2 understand that ur the gurl 4 him|`|Sfr8R4OSaa	she just mad cuz yall are back together ive went through the same thing..dont worry about it she is just being childish|`|kfM7ppWpaa	Say this....."HUSH HO!"|`|6txsgLVuaa	wow i went through the same thing! i was with him 2 1/2 years and we had a lil break and he started to see this other girl, but chances are he did exactly what my ex did and just used her to get over you but clearly it didnt work if he chose you over her. so be proud and dont pay any mind to her shes just jealous otherwise she wouldnt  bother! you did the right thing, you approached her in a mature manner as i did  the same with my boyfriends ex, but of course she wanted to handle it like a little girl and started talking sh*t to me but eventually realized how dumb she was being & she apologized and backed off for good lol. good luck hun! you shouldnt do a damn thing you did ur part now just worry about ur boyfriend and focus on the future not the past.|`|S8Qpiabdaa	yall should change both of yalls numbers if he loves u he will if he doesnt then he really wants her to still stay in touch ! and if yall do change yalls numbers and she finds em out then he probley still is talking to her|`|LWvh2g2maa	I believe you can block her profile so she can't send you anymore messages.|`|AA10266072	Just ignore her.  You shouldn't of had to tell her to back off.  He should of told her to back off.  If he wasn't willing to do that then maybe you should hold off on getting back together.  He might not be ready.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	IGNORE HER|`|4wnn2GbYaa	don't think about she ain't worth ur time..ur better than lettin this "girl" cumin between u n ur boyfriend...hoped that helped a bit!!!|`|xNMPvgFhaa	You really shouldn't contact her at all. <br>  why don't you just let your bf do it? <br>  no wonder she's hurt.
rvSrjNeQaa	If he's pressurising you to have sex - he is not the kind of respectful guy you should be with. Tell him no, that you are not ready yet. If he wants to move on - let him. If he truly cares about you, he will respect your wishes and you also have the right to choose really loving guy who really will love to you not to your body !!|`|KtdlJbrOaa	If he's pushing you to have sex - he is not the kind of respectful guy you should be with.  Tell him no, that you are not ready yet.  If he wants to move on - let him.  If he truly cares about you, he will respect your wishes.|`|xijwHZrWaa	Uh, don't do it? <br>  You shouldn't have to lose your virginity for him.<br>  IT's YOUR choice. Once you lose it you'll never get it back ever again.<br>  And if you're first time don't be on top, he's dumb for even mentioning that to you.|`|Sfr8R4OSaa	If a guy is pushing you, he isnt worth it..if he was worth it he would tell you that he wouldnt make you do anything til you are ready...dont do it hun...
kugPl4oiaa	Honestly, isn't much talking him into it. Unless you can find some mentor he can look up to and relate to.<br>  <br>  Pretty much tell the kid its illegal for him not to go to school, work out a deal with him that if he finishes high school until hes 18 he can do whatever he wants. Eventually he will realise the 18 year old is a loser.<br>  <br>  OR Have him get his GED instead, then get him enrolled to community college studying music or something.<br>  <br>  <br>  Or worse case scenario get the school involved. They will get serious, cops will monitor him....have him on a list so if they see him he is sent right back to school.<br>  <br>  If you aren't okay with the Pot Smoking, make him go to NA meetings see all the losers who regret not going to high school etc etc|`|VMY7No0eaa	get someone to dump a ton of rock in the front yard... make him move it to the back yard... then make him move it to the front yard again.<br>  <br>  tell him... THIS IS WHAT MANUAL LABOR IS... and this is what you will be doing if you don't get an education.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately my son who didn't finish school makes around 80k a year!  So who knows.<br>  <br>  I would call the cops on the pot smoker though.. because he most likely is supplying to your son.  And like the other ones said call the truency officer and tell him your problem. <br>  <br>  threaten to take him to school and walk to all his classes with him might scare him to do it. <br>  <br>  I WOULD try to find somehting that he LIKES to do and then enroll him in a class for that. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK horrible years your dealing with.<br>  <br>  I WOULD TELL HIM... if he doesn't go to school though that when he turns 18 he is out of the door... THEN DO IT!|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	i know this might be hard for a parent to do, but my friends parents did this and i think he benefitted from it. they called the cops and he was sent to military school on countless charges of truancy. but he completely turned around and got his education which is whats important|`|WMR8hVlfaa	He "won't" go?<br>  <br>  I mean, you're the parent. And I know in some states like Ohio the parent is at fault if their child misses too many days. A friend of mine landed her mother in court twice because of her truancy issues.<br>  <br>  I suggest if nothing is working that the parent calls the school to discuss it. The juvenile corrective services in your area will probably also be willing to help. I believe they're the ones who get called/involved if a child is missing too much school.<br>  <br>  It may be that the kid needs some tough love in order to straighten up. But he sounds like he needs a parent above all, and that's not what he's getting. If my child were ever doing even half those things, he'd have his *** grounded for the next six years.|`|xwsS0ITJaa	Get rid of the friend first of all. Bad influence on your boy. He is going to be a street kid if he go on the way he is now. In the old day's it was easy when parents were parents. In to days life we have obedient parents and kids do just what they want with all this ,,,,,Don't hit them ****. There simply is no way to discipline them.|`|39e9235b89c9b80c32eb4b4082db80ccaa	if you're at your wits' end, call the police.  i'm totally serious.  they will enforce the truancy laws and force your child to go to school.  The law states that he must go to school, and you need to stand up before your son is completely out of control.|`|AA11328507	Call the truancy office and tell them you can't get your kid to go to school.  You should also call the cops and tell them that the kid is on pot and the parent has CLEARLY lost control of him.|`|md5DmmQraa	Well i don't have any experience because i am a teenager myself... but still one thing that i can tell you is that forcing your son is not going to help you at all, as i guess you must have already experienced .... <br>  <br>  Adolesence is just a period of time when a child thinks that whatever he does is right and everybody else is a fool.... So the best thing for you to do is give your son some time... Treat him as your friend rather than a kid... Tell him you support all his descions... Try finding out what his plans are for his future and then act accordingly.... <br>  <br>  Infact there must be some person who he listens to, ask them to talk to him as a friend, as an adult.... Most probably he will come around to his senses in a few days time.... Till then don't nag him..... most importantly you stay calm and don't hit the panic button... remember when you were a kid... We all go through this phase.... so best of luck!|`|9isF0Nugaa	wont go to school?<br>  uhm no, thats not how it works<br>  THEY dont get to decide<br>  hes 15<br>  i say unless the 18 yr old needs serious help and ur willing to take him in, you threaten to call the police and tell him to stay away<br>  hes way to old to b talkin to your son.And im sure thats not helping ur son out at all.<br>  You wake him up in the morning, tell him he either gtes reayd or he can go how he is, make him get in the car and take him to school<br>  if skipping is the probhave school security escort him to and from class, the pot thing<br>  no ones ever died from pot.it cant kill you, none the less, its illegal, you tell him he has to quite or think of a punishment, get him drug tested. theres SO many serious and delicate steps yuo have to take for this<br>  im not saying be a mean parent and make him hate you<br>  but his life is going down the tubes and youve gotta try and do sumthing|`|V9qmbFQOaa	He obviously lacks motivation and goals. What has happened in his life to cause this? <br>  <br>  Get him to sit and write down where he hopes to be in 20 years time - eg job, lifestyle, vacations, family etc<br>  Then get him to write down the same thing for 10 years time?<br>  Then get him to write down what he needs to do to achieve those long term goals. How can he achieve this? <br>  Then ask him what he needs to do now to begin achieving those goals.<br>  Then get him to write down where he might end up in ten years time if he doesn't begin positive action.<br>  If this doesn't motivate him, get an organisation which deals with addicts, street kids, homeless men's shelter etc to take round and show him what life is really like where he could end up!<br>  A good fright with a dose of reality might do the trick.<br>  Sometimes just a change of school can work|`|PJWYvF4xaa	Im his age.

Tell him you enjoy hanging out with him and still want to be friends and have a good time but you are interested in anything more than that. Then he can make the decision of whether he can still be friends with you but you have told him you aren't interested so he should at least stop asking you out.|`|6YrRxeVkaa	You better learn NOW how to break hearts, because you will be doing it forever!<br>  <br>  Tell him straight up, nobody likes it when someone beats around the bush.  Say, "Listen, I think you got the wrong idea.  I like you... but only as a friend.  We can't kiss, we can't go out, because that will ruin our friendship.  I hope you understand."  <br>  <br>  if he STILL doesn't get it, there's no use in even trying to be his friend, because how can you be friends with someone who wants more than that?  You can't.  Simple as that.|`|MkZ3hzTEaa	Be careful, most guys are thinking of one thing only, that (kiss).

You have so much going for you right now and have plently of time to figure out what you want. But if this is something you want then go for it. Talking to your parents may be the biggest bump to get over but they're your parents. They're always going to love you. If this is who you want to be then do it. No one can stop you from being yourself.|`|yFSv9sfgaa	I don't know how loving your parents are but you should TRY and talk to them. Of course it isn't going to be easy but you can't try and figure this out on your own. Is this normal? No. But when things are happening that you don't understand and you are confused, you should talk to someone you trust. I can't say I know what it's like to be in your situation but I can imagine its very painful feeling like you are in the wrong body.

Have you done the best you can? Are you understanding and try sympathetic? Do you find your wife attractive?|`|y4SUDnpaaa	I was really ambivalent about how to answer your question. You shouldn't have to go with out sex for the rest of your wife and if your wife is not interested there really is no  moral choice for you  except divorce..and you have kids so that's another can of worms. I had a change of heart when you said in another posting that you were in love with another woman you work with. I assume you have or will have sex with her so you're not doing without. My opinion is that your feeling is lust and not love and for and for once I think the wife really is the problem.I'm sure you you should both go to counseling and talk about this with an objective person who will have no preconceived judgment on either of you. I feel sure you,ve talked about this with your wife several times already and gotten nowhere. If  this problem cannot be resolved in counseling seems you only have two choices, live with it or get a divorce and then you can have sex with anyone you want. Do not focus all your hopes on the other woman. Leaving your marriage for another woman is definitely wrong and so is cheating. I wish you the best of luck, you have a hard decision to make. One more thing ask your wife to please go to her OB/GYN and make sure it isn't a physical problem...........like hormonal.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	No - its cheating and you know its cheating.

I think that it's an issue you need to work out between you and your wife.  How will this make your wife feel, is there anything she can do to satisfy you better, is there a sex therapist you can spend your money on instead of an escort?  Questions that will affect your family.  Are you willing to jeopardize your relationship with your wife and children for a sexual experience.  Self control and commitment seem to be an issue here.|`|MI8WTnL4aa	No. This is horrible. how would you feel if your wife hired a male escourt to have sex with behind your back?  Why not suggest trying new things in the bedroom. Getting a bit kinky? watching some dirty videos together to help you get in the mood etc? Buy her a kinky outfit to wear or something? Tell her that you feel the sexual part of the relationship is lacking compared to how it used to be. Reassure her you still love her and want to try and put some spice back into it?<br>  <br>  If you still love her then there's hope for the marriage. If you don't feel your still inlove with her then maybe you need to think about breaking up. It's better than cheating on her and degrading yourself to pay for it.|`|07d585c24d7b2660f973da61404455ceaa	I think you should talk to your wife.After 15 years of marriage of course it's like everything is a drag/chore/always the same.I know I've been married 8 yrs.There are topics online about how to spice up your sex life/marriage.Or buy one of those Kama Sutra books.I agree with the other posters.Meeting an escort is considered cheating and you are breaking your vows.Think of the pain this will cause your wife if she finds out and what about your kids.What will they think of their father?<br>  Communication is the key to a good marriage.|`|TWCQCSfRaa	The right action would be not to do it!  Think of the life those 3 kids might have if you got caught by your wife.  Imagine how your wife would feel knowing you did this.  I would think really hard if this is your only option.

5f37c1ca843baed941347175d05ad20eaa	I'm in Galveston, so I know what you're talking about.  I'd be much more worried about hurricanes than heat in October though.  And the funny thing about October in Houston is that the beginning of the month can be really really hot, but by the end of the month, it's quite pleasant outside.  So, I'd shoot for late October if you can.  Fewer hurricanes by then too.|`|ld14iRCeaa	I am from Michigan and our weather is never predictable.lol I have been to quite a few outdoor weddings. I find there is always a back up. you plan the wedding of your dreams, but have a back up, like a tent,  or if its in a park a gazebo,or if you have a reception hall, see if they can they quickly accommodate you if the weather turns. If its hot, shorten the ceremony as best you can, pass out fans and people will deal. the best part about weddings is that when its yours, the people who matter the most to you will be there, whether the weather sucks or not, loved ones will come:) good luck!!|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	I'm not from Houston, but my fiance is from Waco, and all I can say is, I hope your hair doesn't frizz in humidity like mine does!!  It seems to me that Texas stays a good 20+ degrees hotter than my home here in Denver all the way into December.  Coupled with the intense humidity, you might be looking at one sweaty wedding.  But you shouldn't let that get in the way if you really want to be married outdoors.  Plan a short but sweet ceremony, so that the guests will have to swelter and fan themselves for 20 minutes tops before heading to the air-conditioned reception.  Also, it's always nice to provide bottled water so nobody passes out from heat stroke.  You can even get the labels printed with your initials or something so it doubles as a cute favor!|`|c62dd304bac916a0f0b3ead296d41785aa	I think it's a good idea... Maybe just have it in early october. If something was to happen with the weather have a back up plan. Just keep an eye on the weather. We all know that during hurricane season things are not cut and dry. Good luck!|`|wMWfCjBpaa	I live in Houston. Like you said, it's unpredictable. I would go with a tent and have either heaters or fans. October is a wonderful month and I think it'll be beautiful regardless. Or you can ask your venue if they have alteratives for you depending on the day. If you decide to just do it outside and it starts to rain, will they let you relocate it indoors at their location.|`|woOeYFrEaa	I live in Dallas.  I think you'd be safe to plan an outdoor wedding in October.  Its true Texas weather is really unpredictable but if your heart is set on getting married outside I think you can probably plan on the temperature being cool enough to not sweat to death in your gown. ;)<br>  <br>  Good luck!
gR2XHU1Faa	Just because you don't have sex doesn't mean that he's not in love with you!! Maybe he was getting insecure and thinking that to you it was all about sex?|`|ErmcT4uUaa	Maybe he needs you to get him a new chick or something|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	I don't think your relationship is doomed. Guys have odd ways of dealing with stress sometimes. <br>  I have had a close guy friend, a "friend with benefits" i guess for a year or so... Recently a bunch of stuff happened and he's basically in massive debt, trying to keep his family off the street, fighting with him family, etc. He went from being a massive horn-dog (haha) to basically not even wanting sex if he has the chance. He just doesn't have time to date, see anyone, or even answer his phone. I know he's still there for me, but he literally can't put the time in. But when I need him he's there. And I've faced similar experiences around exam time at school with stress, though they've only been for a few weeks at a time each semester. <br>  Give him some time. I know that I always think, "man, if I was stressed out, I would just think I'd want some sex to get my mind off it", but thats not the case. They can't enjoy themselves when they're thinking of whatever they're stressed out about. it's like they have to finish their manly duties and get everything sorted out first. <br>  <br>  Just try and give him time. Tell him you're there for him but don't pressure him. I know it's hard but the semester will be over before you know it. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|UwnXYMI4aa	he's a homo|`|pNrfE7fHaa	I'm going through the same thing.  We also are in our early 20's and honeslty, sex is a rarity.  Probably about once or twice a month.  It made me really worried about our relationship for a long time, but I just decided to move on.  I stopped caring.  You can't carry on the sexual part of the relationship alone.  But sadly, I have gotten to the point where I don't want to have sex at all.  But, I have faith that our relationship with prevail.  We will be getting married in October so hopefully it will get better!  My fiance says it is just stress too.  <br>  Just know that you aren't alone!  Have faith in your relationship!  It will get better!  Good luck!  Just, try not to think about it.  :)|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Life is never perfect, so don't expect that your relationship will be perfect all of the time.  You say everything is okay -- he's affectionate, cuddles, and all that.  But you're placing way too much emphasis on sex if you think your relationship is doomed without it.<br>  <br>  Sex is a bonus (there are couples who don't have sex, remember that).  And sometimes life gets in the way.  We get busy with life, we have a lot on our minds, we don't feel well, etc.  If you find stress killing a sex drive hard to believe, try losing your job and having to rely on friends and family to bail you out of a financial crisis.<br>  <br>  You want everything to be perfect, but it's not.  Every -- EVERY -- relationship goes through this shortage in the sex department.  It will bounce back.  Sex and love are not the same thing, so not having sex with you doesn't mean he doesn't love you, and his actions prove otherwise.  Don't turn this into something that it isn't.|`|xGI9z01Maa	I am nine years into my relationship and I just don't have the need at the moment.  I have a lot of stuff that is coming up: a move, a new job, etc.  The stress is killing any thoughts of sex.  It is not that I don't love him but I am just not in the mood.  Being held or the like is fine but the extra is just not happening at the moment.  <br>  <br>  The relationship may or may not be doomed.  It depends on if it is just stress or something else.  You have to talk to him about it.  If it is just stress then it will come back but make sure that their is not something else going on with someone else.  But stress will make you not interested in thing like sex.|`|rvLzngQ6aa	He probably got an STD either from you, or another chick.  If he's not trying to whip it out no more, you best abide.<br>  <br>  Or, maybe you don't look as good as you use to.  Are you FAT?  Is anything starting to sag?  Maybe you need to fix your ugly self up.  Take a look in the mirror.  If your own reflection makes you frown, then you need a makeover.|`|Q6nOeK6Caa	he's jst stressed with school,if he's stilll lovie dovie with yu then yu have nothing to worry about!<br>  <br>  tell him how yu feel,im sure if he loves yu he'll understand!<br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|ta1d1wjEaa	yur twat is whack get it together and step yur game up|`|h2ZDRpmDaa	I wondered the same thing about m husband RIGHT after we got married. He's 21 and I'm 18 so I was worried that there was something wrong since he didn't want it all the time like he did before. But I soon learned that guys change like the weather.lol He goes thru phases of not wanting alot of sex and then wanting it all the time sometimes twice a day. Try tp spice it up a little too I've found that helps get him back in the mood. Show him how bad you want him. Do something out of your "comfort zone" that will surprise him and turn him on. :)|`|mH6CyTGYaa	My friend and her boyfriend recently went through something like this. She had been telling me that he had recently stopped..they hardly did it and they use to do it all the time in the beginning. He said he always used excuses like "You got off birth control and I'm afraid you'll get preg" or "I hate wearing condoms". They recently talked and he said that he didn't love her the way he use to, only to later say he kinda liked someone else also. But they worked it out and talked it thoroughly and are still together and happy. He also said that she had gained a considerable amount of weight and suggested they both start working out again. So get to the core of it. Remember, SEX is a stress reliever. So stress isn't a good excuse.

Put yourself out there. yea... there is a chance you could get hurt but would you like to live with the "WHAT IF...?"s. All I know is that I would be with my boyfriend of almost 5 years if I hadn't thrown a piece of paper at him during my freshman year. =)|`|z1UXptEmaa	wear really short gym shorts and no underware and happen to do some hurdel stretches and butterfly's infront of him and when he looks at ur snatch just look back at him like you wont give him the time of day... you'll have him... hands down... just make sure you're shaved... landing strips usually do the trick
PKs0I8f7aa	For me, it's flattering if we are the only two people who can see it.|`|PKs0I8f7aa	For me, it's flattering if we are the only two people who can see it.|`|izbAdDUraa	Flattering and sometimes a turn on depending on the situation/person of course. But knowing I am capable of doing THAT to a man is nice. Especially if I haven't even touched him yet! lol.<br>  like some voodoo power or something.. :]|`|ybt605Qfaa	I am usually very flattered and impressed when I give myself an erection. Sometimes I give my family erections for christmas.|`|SRZza0cWaa	It depends  if you like the guy or not.|`|GzBkproMaa	Well in a way it can be flattering, but depends on who it is. If it's a hottie, then obviously, you'll find it flattering. But it's also kind of creepy, because it makes you wonder how they were look at you, but it's normal.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	normally, a girl probably wouldnt be aware that a guy had gotten an erection unless she's actually been fooling around with him.<br>  <br>  and so how else would she know?  just because you know you have an erection doesnt make it plain to see for a girl.|`|UnlaK5WOaa	I really couldn't give a damn.|`|tFbdkxyIaa	i actually don't look at guys crotches all that much, but sometimes if we're hugging or dancing i can feel it, or if it's really obvious.<br>  <br>  once with very past ex boyfriend who i still was moved by he got an erection when i went to talk to him and i saw it and he saw i saw it and neither of us said or did anything, but i was glad to have that effect on him still. <br>  <br>  another time a neighbor's boyfriend was out in his white sweatpants and we were all talking and joking and he got an erection and it was obvious. he's really in love with his girlfriend, but joking around with another woman seemed to provoke a bit more sparkle. it's just human. <br>  and we all saw it and kind of tried to act as we hadn't and i quickly went in so as not to prolong their embarassment. i felt a bit flattered and a bit embarassed for us all. situation to avoid if we want a comfortable friendship. we're all pretty easygoing, so it's no biggie.|`|29c7bd56002439be15aee17ffbf4c521aa	ha ha. neither. almost anything can give a guy an erection, for me it isn't something to feel proud of accomplishing, because it is that easy to do.<br>  <br>  not meaning to sound conceited, i just mean it is not a major accomplishment.|`|u5nYlVMxaa	hehe usually it's more funny than anything.<br>  <br>  And also quite embarassing, even for the girl!<br>  <br>  Depending on what the guy is like I will react differently.<br>  <br>  A nice guy and I'm flattered.<br>  <br>  A bit of a creep and I'm grossed out.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  :)|`|gKKD8Aayaa	i find it a very good thing|`|7KOqTYYLaa	Depends who it is .. the office hunk then flattering .. the office lurch then gross!|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	Flattering and hilarious!|`|1fcb7562596b52ad171b00f259e7e947aa	Hahaha|`|Tp8o9gP3aa	I dont think its gross, but I do think it would be really funny.|`|2bkV73gpaa	If you like the guy, it's usually flattering. My girlfriend's younger brother is always popping one when he sees me in a bikini or towel.<br>  <br>  If it's just some random stranger on the street or in the store who's checking you out, it's usually gross (especially if he's playing with himself).|`|QYahxUEWaa	Flattering and funny.<br>  <br>  The best part is that it makes me feel proud that I can do that>:D|`|9CMGO5fhaa	Depends on if I was trying to or not! If I was the guy will find out cause why let a good one go to waste? If I didn't want that to happen but it did I'll usually try to send the guy on his way so things don't go the wrong way....... And yes I know when a guy has one well if its big enough to see through his pants that is!|`|PS83gPGoaa	lol depends who you are sounds as if your v. young so thats slightly wierd tbf|`|1xr6T6h0aa	You must be very young.|`|MhR5TE79aa	its like wahey lol! nah its soo funny|`|0k8H91Dpaa	Ahh . <br>  If you like him then i guess it is kind of flattering .<br>  <br>  If you don't its pretty sick....<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean you need to be like <br>  "Omg your so hot i just got happy "<br>  <br>  Thats pretty immature .|`|Q6nOeK6Caa	when i give my boyfriend onee,its funny. but if some creepy perve stares @ me and gets one then that's jst beyondd nasty and insulting.|`|htsyR5qraa	depends who it is<br>  normally find it absolutely hilarious :P|`|QOWPdl2qaa	I think its a little flattering, but kinda gross. A little of both I guess.|`|pBVjKCJ1aa	Flattering.<br>  That's the problem, it can be a turn-on that's difficult to turn off!|`|7QDYWAkfaa	Well the scenarios you described are pretty funny hehe but when he tells you about it through texts.. thats just ew.|`|Xka2R4EJaa	flattering lol unless it's some gross dude that looks at you way nasty!

I am not one bit comfortable about that at all, Need to put your mind on other things|`|W4xRqgbsaa	Most girls your age would probably be as embarrassed as you are when that happens. Trust me, girls have their own embarrassing body things to deal with (like starting her period when she's not expecting it and having bloody clothes).<br>  <br>  Here's some good advice, though:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-hide-an-unwanted-erection" rel="nofollow">http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-hide...</a>|`|hiWzFb87aa	Yes, I find it flattering to know I got him hot.|`|3bpwLPxjaa	wow.  I understand your curiosity.  I personally can say, I only want to know if there is an erection, if I am turned on as well.<br>  The situation should tell you if it is okay to reveal that or not.  If you feel as if you shouldnt let her see it, then you are probrably right.|`|mCWqdbfYaa	well it really depends on where you are and what your doing look for signs on whether she is flirting or just talking and if she is flirting and its and appropiate place and time then go for it, it might really turn her on you never no but its usually a turn on|`|kugPl4oiaa	Awww are you scared about having your first *****?<br>  <br>  You shouldn't show it off, girls will find it gross. Unless you make a joke about it...but they will still stay away from you. So hide it unless they ask to see it.|`|7thPagYNaa	when its just too of you..its brilliant....in public...oh dear!|`|6oSm5Qxzaa	I think it depends on the situation. It can be flattering if that was the goal, but it if it just out of nowhere in some weird place then it can be gross.|`|h2ZDRpmDaa	Nah leave it be i wanna see it. Makes me feel good knowin I still got the power and sex appeal to make a man hard like that. It's a huge turn on for me. ;)|`|aIFfOrFSaa	well ... it's not flattering or gross.<br>  it doesn't really affect you, a guy telling you he gave you an erection would either make you laugh or have no affect on you what so ever!|`|SrlOGxZYaa	It depends lol. If I gave a cute guy an erection then yes I'd be flattered. But it was a guy I didn't particularly like or like my male best friend  then no, I'd be grossed out.|`|a0f8bff85a3d2bad97d479c10439d6b0aa	If its a guy that I'm dating, its flattering...if its a strange guy in a bar or coffee shop..its totally gross!
8RQCa3SXaa	TATUM O' SULLIVAN!<br>  <br>  your not thinking of having sex, are you?<br>  <br>  please do not.<br>  <br>  talk to me first. auntie daniella|`|D6FBLQfwaa	It is wrong if you feel pressured into it. It is wrong if your partner is an adult. It is wrong if you dont use a contraceptive. Other than that, humans are animals, they have specific drives, and one of those drives is sex. I think it's foolish and nearly impossible to mix natural human drives with morality. By not masturabating or not having sex, all that energy is built up inside, and it will most certainly explode. I hope I have suitably answered your question.|`|39e9235b89c9b80c32eb4b4082db80ccaa	yes.  while many will say that it doesn't really matter, i think it does.  and i'm not a bible-thumping, "no sex before marriage" christian, but i do believe in morals and values.<br>  <br>  sex is something that is meant to be shared between two people in a loving, committed relationship.  and by committed, i mean longer than six or seven months.<br>  <br>  also, 16 year olds have no idea of the emotional involvement that comes with sex.  the bond goes far beyond the physical, and we need to respect it as such.  only mature adults can truly understand the deepest meaning of sex.|`|keTNfOOhaa	you guys SUCK why the f*** not and danni havnt you already done it?|`|yFSv9sfgaa	Yes. And here is why. Having sex isn't just something you do physically. The first person you have sex with you will NEVER forget. Because there is an emotional and spiritual tie there also. If someone loves you, then you can wait for that part. And unfortunately, as I have experienced, a majority of guys (I'm a girl) just want to do it because it feels good. And for girls, it makes them feel like the guy loves them when in reality they don't care.|`|V9qmbFQOaa	Absolutely!<br>  You're still a child and shouldn't be playing dangerous games which might affect the rest of your lives. Bodies, emotions, maturity etc are all still developing.The damage which could be done could be irreparable. Even 16 year olds do not know enough about real life to be sexually active. Also reputations are at risk. No one wants a relationship with a slag<br>  Enjoy being a child. Having sexual intercourse brings responsibilities with which even some adults can't cope.|`|YsiMq8Zuaa	Personally, I believe it's trashy.|`|0EUBc2hRaa	I think it's not good for you to have sex under the age of 18. it's not just something you do....|`|SuOfRTXzaa	Definitely wrong - that's why there are so many kids having kids|`|VMY7No0eaa	Yes... not mature enough.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	It's sad and unhealthy.
G6Uy43coaa	Think for yourself...you have to live with her.  Not them.<br>  <br>  You say you do not love the woman with the high class job and PHd...so there must be someone you are interested in without those qualities....the one you love.  <br>  <br>  A few years ago, I used to like this guy.  He owned a business and I worked for him part time.  I remember one conversation...a phone conversation where he said something about his family not understanding his choices in women.  It told me right there that his family and probably friends had more influence than his heart.<br>  <br>  If you can''t decide for yourself that the woman you say you love is good enough for YOU...and you want approval from your family and friends...then let her go.  She does not deserve to be put on display for approval for you to move forward in your relationship with her from your family and friends.<br>  <br>  I encounter many people every day.  I have grown tired of feeling the need to constantly explain and prove myself to those who don't even know me and would prefer not to because if they did, they would be proven wrong about who I am.   I need a man  who will accept me, love me and trust me. I don't know who he is, but he is in for a treat ! <br>  <br>  if you don't love her...or if you can't stand up to your family and friends on her behalf, let her go and find someone who will.  But know you will probably always regret letting her go.  In the end, it is you who will lose.  On the other hand, someone will gain a gem !<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you...|`|JV0i77uiaa	For me love is more important as long as is mutual, love move everything.  I have seen people with money, Phd, high class job and they are very miserable.  I'm sorry I learned that lesson too late.  Because I always thought that money was the most important things.|`|x3EPqezJaa	They're both important. But regardless of which is important or not, if you don't have a good feeling, then don't marry her. Even if you don't marry for love, you still have to like the person a lot and care about them a lot.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	Love is important and you need to decide as it is you who will live with the decisioon.|`|xGshAiXOaa	The two are not mutually exclusive.  Strive to have both, never settle for less than what you deserve.|`|cFhgBmTuaa	its all about the love. if you dont feel it, its not going to work anyway..|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Money can't buy happiness...|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	TWO THINGS MONEY CANT BUY...<br>  <br>  LOVE<br>  &<br>  POVERTY|`|CeXKPtCRaa	It depends on the person!  Importance is all subjective.  What's more important, having a child or having a job?  Some people don't want kids, and some people don't want jobs.  Some would say love, but some couldn't care less about it.  People find happiness in difference places, and only ignorance allows someone to decide for someone else.<br>  <br>  Should you live your life for god or someone else?  What if you aren't religious?  I would pick someone else, but I know a lot of people that would pick god.<br>  <br>  Should you work somewhere you are happy or should you do what you have extreme talent in?  If you want to be a garbageman but you are a mathematical genius, which do you pick?<br>  <br>  Do you work where you will be happy or the most successful?  What do you consider success to be?<br>  <br>  If I enjoy being on a beach more than anything, and think I'd rather stay to myself then interact with people, how can love be more important to me?  And am I wrong if I would rather make money to go to a beach for the rest of my life then be with people?  <br>  <br>  It's not black and white, it's personal!|`|aErUKUvVaa	your friends and relatives are good sources of feedback and can tell a lot about a person that u cannot see if u are blindly in love.  ur not tho, so move on.  altho love and happiness are most important, u are not in love so pursue other things until u meet ur #1.  as far as the phd and "high class job" go - if it makes u happy, go for it.  otherwise its simply materialistic and trying to keep up with the joneses.....|`|pVBH6iCYaa	did you know that it's actually possible to have a nice 'high class' job and love?|`|AWd8a1PTaa	Jousting is the meaning of life.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Family is most important.<br>  <br>  And service to others as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  Its not going to matter one damn bit how many degrees I have when I am lying on my deathbed.<br>  <br>  The lessons I have taught my children, THAT will live on.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your children are your only true legacy, unless you are Ghandi or someone like that.....which of course, MOST people aren't.|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	My husband and I own an extremely successful business, and we also have an extremely successful loving relationship.<br>  <br>  If I didn't have my business, I think I would be okay.

bc4a087960c91a42e0bbb5ed98d2eed0aa	I would let it go for now. And see if she writes back. You didn't say, did you state anything like: Meet your grandson? Or are you just hoping she will see that your son resembles her son? Sometimes people only see what they want to see. <br>  If you don't get a response back, you should probably let it go. <br>  However....personally, I wouldn't be able to. I can give advice, but I don't always follow it. I would be inclined to email her and say something about wanting her to see her grandson's picture, and I would have to go on a rant of bragging about how great he is, to let her & her son know what they have missed out on. <br>  That being said, I wish you luck. I just could never have made it 13 yrs without a confrontation of some sort, so I give you a gold star! :)|`|gC8xO53Oaa	Wow! I understand why you did it. I'd just wait and see if she responds.

NQI9JD5Gaa	Monday Night i lost a friend to over dose. it was accidental thing so far as we know so far, but the autopsy will not be finished until later this week. He made a ton of poor decisions, but he had a heart of gold if you really got to know him. he had been clean for four years... and doing well until the night it happened. he had a lot of problems that no one else knew about, a few that he shared with me... those are the things that drove him crazy and pushed him to do the things that he did. now he is dead. now there are no more chances to talk to him about what hurt... mental pain is a million times more difficult to fix than physical pain, physical pain just reminds you your still alive.<br>  <br>  what hurts the most about his loss is knowing that those things that he told me cannot be shared no matter how badly i want to. that i alone will spend the rest of my life knowing what really killed my friend.<br>  <br>  nothing can be said or done to help. you can be a friend tho, that is one of the things that they need. thats just about the only thing they need. let them cry, let them feel, and let them share what hurts the most with you... but be prepared, them talking about it will make you feel it too, and it may help a little but it is alot of trust they are putting in you, and it could do alot of damage if you share that information with others.|`|b7xt2eZPaa	Well from what I have learned is that some people have heard it all from everyone else the reasons to live why life is so great..blah blah and blah. But what I have come to realize is that sometimes they just need someone to talk to, to release all the emotions that they express out in bad ways(through overdose and cutting) but from personal experience theres not much you can say that someone else hasnt said but others may not take the time to listen or sit or just be that shoulder.|`|2YHkUILUaa	I had someone that I love take thier own life, so I know how confused you are right now. Never in a million years did I think that my relative would do that, but it happened..The blessing is that your friend is still alive. Yes, professional help will work, but in my case what I think would have helped my relative was if everyone extended a helping hand and was always showing that they were there for her. No matter what thought, suicide is a puzzling thing. You have to know that it is something that you could not control (this is something that was hard for me to accept because I felt like I could have stopped it.) Usually I think it stems from depression, and a lot of times depression is hard to pick up in people..especially loved ones. They do thier best to hide it from you because they don't like to have people worry about them.<br>  Instead of just saying that "I'm always here for you" or "if you need to talk come over" which is what I did, schedule times with your friend on when you hang out. For example, make Wedneseday "Hump Day Hamburger Day" or something like that and another day something else. Make a certain day in the week, month, etc. a planned evening that your friend will look forward to. You need to take the intitative and plan these things because someone who is suicidal will usually not reach out. If they miss a date then call then go over or call them immediately to say that "you missed them" and reschedule. These are things that I wish I would have done, and I'm glad that I can pass my regrets on to you so that maybe you can help your friend.
1cef0b31719e047b8c16caf5d29cfedbaa	People stay together for a myriad of reasons and it's not always love. He just may be comfortable with you or he may really in fact love you. The time you have spent together is kinda irrelevant. After a year you would hope that he's with you because he really loves you, but the only way you will truly know is in how he acts and how he treats you.|`|5d6392a517918c69f898af7a86fa7bfaaa	It can be either thing. There is a very thin and blurry line between love and infatuation, you see. It is even harder to tell this when its not you, yourself, that you're psychoanalyzing. It may be love, but then again it may just be pent up frustration after losing you, separation anxiety, over-infatuation, the fear of being alone or a unique combo of all of these. Play it cool for awhile and don't pay into wishful thinking. Treat it like a brand new relationship where trust and true love has to be built from the ground up. Only time will tell. <br>  <br>  If you are fighting this much already and haven't even dealt with any intense or real hardship, that is definitely a bad sign. Think of a relationship as a large ship that you both build from the ground up. Once its established, it sets sail and each of you is forever responsible to maintain it, so that your ship will hold together throughout anything. The longer you are together for this "boat-ride", the harsher the water (life) gets and the more icebergs (obstacles) you will hit. Why  would anyone want to take their ship out into "stormy waters" when you see that it is already starting to sink?|`|yFSv9sfgaa	This guy is crazy. Don't waste your time. When guys go through a lot of crappy/crazy girls and find one that is decently sane, they usually don't know how to deal with it at first. You break up, he sees all the worse girls and wants you back for that reason. He doesn't love you for you. You're just better then the others. He doesn't know what he wants.

Still prefers to watch it by himself....all i can say is that he has an addiction, and people who are addicted to porn is kind of hard to get rifd of it. That's the reason why he doesn't make love with you because he's being pleased on the other side by watching porn. Usually those who are addicted like your husband is, even when they make love with you, in their head they have all those image in their head....it's very frustrating i understand your point of view...I wouldn't know what to suggest really, it's a very stramge situation...All i can say is all the best to you!

All you want to do about it is hide remote controls? You need to sit down and have a serious conversation and demand answers from him, don't let him treat you like that!|`|Nrk9fT8waa	Ideas? Keep it simple and be a wife. Talk to him, communicate and let him know what's on your mind. Actions speaker louder than words, but in your case, your actions may pull off a bit too much. There's no reason to assume things and act out of anger; it's just not worth it!|`|ZzjUHawhaa	TALK TO HIM!!!! Tell him ur not down for any BS and mean it. don't do anything childish like what u mentioned. and if he doesn't straighten up his actions that's when u start pulling back on the sex or not cooking dinner or washing his clothes.<br>  most of all u got to talk to him first.|`|AA11220327	heres an idea, grow up, be the bigger person, and actually communicate with your husband if something is bothering you|`|OF7ZHq19aa	Are you seriouse? Smack the b|t(h and make him tell you wher he went. He is cheating tell him not to fU(" with you|`|xQJjTuEWaa	Be the bigger person and talk to him instead.  Two wrongs don't make anything right.|`|1Y0yPiSvaa	No sex.|`|qufUi5mmaa	If you want to make things better, tell him what is going on in your mind so you guys can get to the bottom of the problem.  I dont understand why people want to hurt each other.  Life is hard enough on your own.  Why make things worst.  Take a deep breath, and do the right thing.|`|qJZRKR16aa	Don't worry yourself about his doings,  because what he does in the dark will come to the light..OK? So sit back and let it come to you whatever it is.....You'll find out in its own time...|`|S7uGTirdaa	take his car and put it somewhere he cant find it.|`|Wj212FWXaa	tell him youre not an idiot and you know his behavior is weird, so he better knock it off. or if you are that convinced that hes cheating than dont say anything and hire a private investigator. i dont think hiding his stuff is really going to do anything but annoy him and make him glad he is cheating, if that is what he is doing, because its kind of an immature move on your part.  he's just going to talk about you with his mistress and she's going to be all "oh, she's so dumb, i would NEVER do that to you!!"  be sneaky and dont let on until you have proof, or tell him straight up to cut it out bc you WILL catch him.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Or you could act like an adult and talk with him about it. Just an idea.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	Are you an adult or a child?  "Get back" at your husband?  Boy, you sure have a marriage that is destined to last.  Have you ever heard of COMMUNICATION?  Try TALKING to him instead of acting like a brat and trying to be mean.|`|u7LSohRyaa	I would get a detective to track his movements. If he's cheating on you, then it's over. Catching him in the act would probably be the most embarrasing uncomfortable thing you could do for him especially if you've got the pictures to prove it. He sounds really immature and controlling. You can do better then that. Do you want all that drama in your life?|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	easy .. take his wallet and hide it .. then he will be upset i bet then put it .. were you can only find it .. like in the fridge ..... and his underwere .. put it in the .. wash room.. but make it so thats its not clean so he cant were it ok ...|`|RKhSRMlZaa	Give him a divorce so he doesn't have to deal with your petty, juvenile, immature a s s.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	I agree with Diamond. You need to communicate with your husband in order for it to last a life time.
9gmGhJ5Aaa	Since this is her last birthday, try to get the whole family to show up. Surely everyone can get along for your mom. or try to plan 2 parties, one for the aunt, and one for the sister.|`|VTAHyz3Qaa	Thats tough!! Well. If I was on my death bed and it was my last birthday ever I would want the hole family to be their, so I would gather everyone to the party bc its her last one, have pictures of her everywhere, do everything that reminds her of her. Favortie color, flowers.. etc.|`|lCeboITcaa	I would give her some time to herself. She might not want to be around family, family always tends to bring back good or bad memories|`|HFUtDzqHaa	Im srry about ur mom :( :( :(   I think you should just do something special like hang a bunch of pictures around the room that will bring bac memories and have a small party. (ill keep ur mom in my prayers)|`|Xb67x5lwaa	I am so so so so so so so sorry about your mom. I don't know what I would do without her. Get her something she has been really really wanted fir awhile. Get her something from the heart even if you made it. Also if I were your mom I would want them to get me something normal just like any other year because I wouldn't want them to worry about me. <br>  <br>  I can't say how sorry I am for you. God Bless =]
zzaScg0haa	Expect the unexpected
tFbdkxyIaa	many people respond intensely when you ignore them. it may well be a sort of psychological reaction. i've been with guys like that. if i ignored them, they started chasing me again until i stopped ignoring them. why have you only been seeing one and other on and off if you really like him. it sounds like he's not committed enough, but wants to keep you as an option for when he's in need.|`|0k8H91Dpaa	He wanted you to text him first...<br>  But you didn't so he caved in ... last night .<br>  <br>  Talk to him .<br>  Ask him how he feels about you .|`|3bpwLPxjaa	My initial thought is that He is immature.  You playing those texting games is bad too.  I hate texting.  That two hours texting could have been a 20 min phonecall.  <br>  <br>  I can see you already don't trust him.  Being 1 1/2 hrs away is only going to feed into your insecurities.   I strongly suggest NOT sleeping with him.|`|X3kz6fG8aa	Guys are just like that, I've experienced the same thing.. They don't like to feel bottled up into anything.. just give him his breathing room..do be so readily available and when he text's you, whatever you do...don't text him right back..wait a little bit...show him that your not hanging onto his every word.  That will keep his attention...if your too easy of a catch, then that's how they will treat u.|`|onrcmQf8aa	He only texts you when he feels like he has time to text you.  It only takes 2 seconds to send a text.  I can't think of any reason why he couldn't have text to just say hello at some point.<br>  <br>  Do you want to be bothered with a guy that doesn't manage his time wel?|`|z1UXptEmaa	you's a booty call... he just wanted you for the sex and last night he just got lonely and horny|`|ta1d1wjEaa	sometimes when we sleep with a girl we subconsciously think that she knows us in a way, like certain things you won't trip on, like getting some " me " time for a couple of days it's all about space and communication... ya dig|`|mCWqdbfYaa	maybe there is other things preoccupying him you wont no unless you ask or find out by one of his friends
KtdlJbrOaa	Maybe, maybe not.  You don't know him well enough yet to judge the situation.  If you hear from him again, you know he was telling the truth.  If not - then it's not a huge deal cause you are not all emotionally invested in him yet.|`|rvA9BXehaa	Babe, you're hot for this hunk, and need a little something-something. That's cool. He's a lucky dude.<br>  <br>  Try to look at the big picture. Here's a guy that likes you and he is a responsible student. I'm betting this fellow is going places.<br>  <br>  I suggest you hitch your wagon and see how far this thing goes...|`|AA11699687	He's in college and they have finals and midterms and lots of projects. If you hooked up with him after running into him twice and then expect him to be committed 24/7 to you, you are moving too fast. He has other things to do. he didn't say-I'm dating 15 other people, he said he has work. Don't get your panties in a bunch, and maybe when he's caught up you guys can work what you have into a relationship. If you push for a commitment and all his time now, you may as well tell yourself that its over, because it will be.
NqWl2qlPaa	We have a ten year old daughter, so listen up, you are not dating that young.  Dating consists of adults doing adult things at night.  If you are interested in a certain person, set up something at the skating rink or some other public brightly lit daytime outing, and tell your parents they are welcome to be there and mean it.  The more you show affection for someone the more your parents will not like that person.  But the more you show your parents you are being responsible and not acting like a flaky teenager, then they will trust you more and extend your boundaries a little bit at a time.  you are only fourteen and you'd be extremely lucky if they agreed to to what I said, because our daughter would not be encouraged to hang out with the opposite sex at all|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Honestly, I don't think that you can. And believe it or not...it's not a bad idea to just wait a little longer to date. Guys aren't going anywhere ;)|`|4kcXEwtTaa	ASk if you can have a talk and set rules to date like having a curfew and stuff it will showw them your mature :)))|`|XlhBBZPxaa	well being a parent my self just explain that you want to be able to go out on dates in High school and that you are responsible and mature enough to go out you make all A's and you really haven't given them anything to make them not trust you in any way but as a parent would think .... my son isn't allowed to date until he is 25  LOL|`|X6C6kZKKaa	just get them together and talk to them. if they don't agree. then you don't have much choice but to do it behind their backs.|`|807fcae559f0d52cb9c4a617e1ab098aaa	IVE NEVER MET A 12 TO 17 YEAR OLD WHO DIDNT THINK THAT SHE WASNT MATURE FOR HER AGE. TRY GROUP OUTINGS.|`|rvSrjNeQaa	No..No ..you are still not a mature girl or lady !! You should keep the way your parents showing to you for your better future !! OK !!|`|hXz9jZnCaa	the only way would be to have experience in it... i can't argue if you say you're mature for your age... alot of ppol are... but the question is can you stay mature?? i had a friend who's 14 now and she lost her virginity because boys have a way of making you give them what you want... i can understand why your parents are worried... just think about all of this and make sure you don't make the wrong choices if you're ready then date someone and show your parents that you wont be easily fooled|`|Sfr8R4OSaa	well my friend couldnt date until now well she is 15 now, but she told her mom that whenever she goes on a date with him, there will always be friends with them...but idk just sit them down and talk tell them that you want to have fun.|`|JrhNwtP0aa	According to present enviornmet u rnt mature  enough to understand the world becoz today boys want is just physical realtion nd not true love,,so be careful befor dating any one nd ur parents r correct according to me but its upon u...|`|yCBpl2Jgaa	Your 14!

And also bring a boy home for them to meet to prove that nothing will go wrong.|`|L37rMgnmaa	well show that yuh can handdle it..that ur pretty meature..that they should give yuh a chanse...<br>  let them kno wut chu think n how yuh feel...in that way the can still trust yuh...|`|4DDSD9Syaa	It doesn't matter that you are going to start high school. You are too young to even think about dates, you have your whole life ahead of you. You just need to concentrate on continuing to keep your grades all straight A's. And continue to be a good girl and not do anything behind your parents back. I have 3 dtrs, 2 in high school, and one is a senior and one is freshman I don't let them date. They need to concentrate on school. I want them to build their education foundation first and make that strong and then build from their. I want to the learn to be independent women, never to count on a man or anyone to help you out. I do allow them to hang out with friends ( a group of them boys and girls) never on a single date with a guy. So they do have some independence on going out with their friends but they know their priority is school.|`|JgTQh90kaa	dont worry, im 14 too and im like going through the SAME thing.<br>  <br>  see if your parents would let the boy who you wanna date come over to your house first, a couple of times, so they get to know him, and know hes not up to anything.<br>  <br>  (ive dont this before and it actually does work)<br>  haha<br>  if you talk to your parents about it first,<br>  and they say no,<br>  tell them that youre getting older, and youre mature,<br>  also that they need to trust you on this,<br>  if things dont work out, the blames on you<br>  (as in YOU not your parents)<br>  <br>  so good luck!(:|`|MmSGeD2Eaa	dont say your going out on a "date" say your going out with friends....at your age i would always go out with groups first anyways..thats how highschool is..and then when he chooses to take you one on one....then you just say the same thing to your parents..i know its bad to lie,...but your a teenager come on now!!! rebel a lil bit! :D|`|5k62aEGUaa	Talk to him..& say do you expect me to be gay!
AA11881188	No. He's an immature idiot. Find someone who knows you love him whether you buy him **** or not.|`|TJezsCkHaa	he just wants your money.forget about him,he is using you|`|ze4Gt1araa	No that's not called love that's called interest.<br>  <br>  If that guy will really like you he wouldn't even ask you to buy him something nor get mad if you couldn't get it.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	It sounds to me like your boyfriend is just using you and that's not right at all. When you tell him you are not buying him something he is trying to make you feel guilty by saying you don't love him. Don't fall for this or he will keep using you.|`|Sfr8R4OSaa	he is just using you for your money but i buy my bf stuff all the time and he not ask for it..but hun if he is gonna do that ask him what he is gonna get you...|`|yCBpl2Jgaa	No, is it buggery! he wants some attention and wants to see you care! thats all!

He just wants you to get him somethin he can't afford, or just doesn't wanna use his own money for.|`|W9z9Al4Oaa	no thats wrong he's just trying to make you feel guilty ,but he shouldn't do that b/c thats not right .....i don't know if he loves you or not but what he's doing isn't very loving.
6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	He will think about it. Guys don't play games.  If that's what he said - that's what he'll do.|`|bTBIBTE1aa	Don't let him trash you. You need to do what you feel is right Don't do something that in the end you will look back and want to hurt yourself. Just flow with it.|`|nmiXLhwCaa	Wait it out and see what he says.  There isn't anything else you can do, tell your best friend about it I guess.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	First rule of being a good girlfriend (to your female friends) - DO NOT DATE YOUR FRIENDS EX'S.

He had already moved on from her.....|`|jRuOphojaa	i'd wait it out... I don't think you should date your best friends ex though. Even if you really like him, he should be off limits. Guys are NOT worth loosing your best friend over.|`|Sfr8R4OSaa	well if you like him alot just wait to see what he says|`|AA11699687	what is the question?|`|mDq4Mf9zaa	best friends exs r just off limits<br>  ive gone through the situation it makes the ex (me i was the ex) feel all weird and what if your bestfriend still has feelings for him?
PWN5rqgxaa	i left my wife because i felt ignored by her because of her schedule, priorities, social life etc...   so i thought id go find someone to pay more attention to me<br>  <br>  moved out... filed for divorce...  found a new girlfriend... moved in with her... turned out she was a psychotic b*tch... and i realized what a good thing i had before with my wife...<br>  <br>  lucky for me, my wife had never given up on me, took me back knowing where id  been and who id been with, and our marriage is stronger today than ever before because we both realize what went wrong before and how close we came to losing each other forever<br>  <br>  weve been back together since may last year, and expecting a baby in june|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	He left for a month and when he came back he made it clear to me that he was only back because of our child.  He moved into the guest bedroom and started going out every night.  This lasted a very short time until I made him leave again, this time with a U-Haul.|`|S8Qpiabdaa	me and my hubby did (he got caught cheating) it was for exactly one month the first week we were hardly talking and when we would it wasent nice but after that the next 3 weeks we were having sex pretty much every day so i guess he realized that he was a dumb *** and im sure hed never do it again|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	I did but I knew walking out the door that I'd be back.  We had some problems we needed to work out and just needed some time apart.  I moved for about a year.  We talked just about every night and were there for each other and were friendly and still loved each other the whole time I was gone... that never went away.  We only separated because we needed to to work on problems and it worked out for us.  I've been back for about a year and our relationship is stronger than it ever was.|`|wIKvnsb0aa	My sister and her husband had been together, dated, for a long time. About a year after they married they decided to get a divorce. Not even a 3 months after their divorce, they were seeing each other again. They got remarried in the same year they got divorced and have a baby now.|`|LWvh2g2maa	Well I got divorced and I hope to get back together with my ex.  It's a loooong story.  The bottom line is that we still love eachother.|`|AA10911598	Rarely does it work out but it is possible.  I tried, but that marriage ended up in divorce and we both moved on to better partners.|`|6hgiRL7Vaa	Statistically, separation precedes divorce.  Very few people get back together and if they do, it is for a short duration. <br>  <br>  The spouse who wanted the separation gets tired of hearing the other spouse complain about the hurt and resentment they have from being rejected. The spouse who wanted the separation then files for divorce.|`|WmwEYzYkaa	we probably separated 10 times during the course of our marriage, finally ended in divorce.
qJaurSycaa	pierce each other|`|kQStNgzUaa	Go to the library and browse. Or, if you are both athletic, go for a run together, or some other sports activity, like skating. Have fun!|`|Z2YgGifCaa	I don't know where you are located to know if you can get outdoors, but something I love to do is Geocaching. You can find more information on that at www.geocaching.com<br>  <br>  It's more or less like a scavenger hunt, so its fun, but it will allow the two of you to talk, as well as discover new areas which you otherwise wouldn't know about.<br>  <br>  If you can't get outdoors, chatting over coffee is always a good way to go and is very cheap.<br>  <br>  You can also look into community events. I know the town where I live there are often times movie nights, live music, etc. which cost very little and sometimes nothing at all. You should be able to check with your local community center or Parks and Rec to find out about those things.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and GOOD LUCK!|`|tpfxZZADaa	One of my favourite things I liked to do with my girlfriend was just go on walks to the shops with her.<br>  <br>  If it is a date, maybe you can walk down to the park find a seat and make up stories about everybody you see and try and make up the most outrageous story you can. If need be, just tell him you learned about this game of watching people going about their day and commentating on it trying to make the other person laugh the most. We did that a lot before we both started working so hard.<br>  <br>  But just being around someone and doing every day things, like shopping can be relaxing and fun. Maybe your the sort of woman who always meets someone you know when out and about, what can give you a chance to introduce a friend to a guy you like in a not to serious or heavy way?|`|8AqePkCqaa	Take a walk around a mall, go to a park have a picnic or just walk around it. play board games or cards or walk around in an arcade|`|oche3k5taa	go to a park, or hang out at the mall...or even just hangout at the house with video games...|`|uRPokfbcaa	Inexpensive: its on the mind of everyone these days. Check out your towns website. Most towns have a list of free activities going on. Or check out a museum. My boyfriend and i go to them all the time. Its about 10 for both of us. You could also pick up some stuff at the grocery store and cook up a pizza for the two of you to share. On my boyfriends and mine first date, all we did was walk around. We went to a park and we just talked. It lets you really get to know someone. Good luck and remember it doesn't matter what you did as long as you had fun.
Sfr8R4OSaa	just go for what makes you happy. you dont need to be shy sweetie...be outgoing and let her know you like her, but if the other girl says no go for the other one but dont ask her right off especially after you just asked one. just wait for the answer from this other girl...and if she says no wait about a week and try for the other girl give her time to know you like her|`|WxqqpPWHaa	If you can feel comfortable around her and be yourself you did the right thing. Also think about her past relationships with other guys if she had any. Look at the difference between your relationship with her and her other relationships. If it is exactly the same as her other relationships, she isn't the one for you.|`|4W3v2fO5aa	hmmm....now that a tough one!! personally i think you should have just spoken to the girl your shy around...and became friends with her first and then maybe you might have found out that she likes you too... but if youve already asked out the other girl then forget about the other one lol and you might find that you end up liking her even more tha the other one... =) a bit confusin but hope i helped|`|PK498w0Saa	Only you can know that. Just think about which one you'd rather be with. Although this sounds mean but it's the way life goes: if it doesn't work out with one try it with the other. Obviously don't cheat on anyone though. Make sure you are sensitive and kind. Good luck.|`|PlDiJFi0aa	Having two girlfriends at same time.You can get into a big trouble.How can you keep up with two girls at the same time.|`|AYXFrNfFaa	yes so long as you dont mess her around and then go looking to start seeing / spending time with the other.|`|9sIcZwWMaa	yes, but you have to be sure to forget about the other girl...<br>  you will get more interested about this girl by time.....|`|5k62aEGUaa	Yes.

6a56c836d361c3eb479fddc9e9cb02e1aa	That is totally typical.  I taught preschool for years and I guarantee that one minute after you leave, they are fine.  It is the reaction of the parent that is key.  Simply kiss them goodbye and be confident.  Walk away.   Do not break down or stay longer than needed.  You kid will have a harder time detaching from you if you linger.  Kids are creatures of habit, and within a few days they will say goodbye to you and have no emotional reaction to you leaving at all.|`|zL1sggpCaa	My children were in daycare since they were about 6 weeks old... I had to return back to work.<br>  <br>  I have seen other children that one parent stayed home until they were any where from 2-4 and they had separation problems, because they went from spending all day with their parent, to being at a daycare center (or home). It can work, and it doesn't take long, but it does happen. Be prepared for tears and fits for the first few days to weeks.<br>  <br>  Also, I do notice that my children share better than those that are home all day with their parent. Just an observation from them playing with some of the neighborhood kids.|`|6hgiRL7Vaa	Read some books on the research of B.F. Skinner. The foremost researcher on human and child behavior.  From the time the child becomes cognizant to about 4 years is when a child learns how to interact socially as an adult. It is taught by imprinting from seeing how people around them interact. <br>  <br>  That is why teachers say that by the time a child gets to them, it is already too late for them to have an affect on the childs socialization.|`|PWN5rqgxaa	you have to just leave them at the nursery and move on... after a few days they understand its part of the routine... the problem is parents, grandparents, etc who make it a bigger deal than it needs to be and thats what gets the kids more upset

He's probably just afraid of messing up.|`|jJZz2U8Gaa	I think a lot of times, girls don't realize how much they make guys nervous, jumpy, etc. especially when the guy likes the girl a lot. Sometimes guys don't know how to act or what to talk about with a girl. They worry if they are talking about the right things or making the right impression. He is shy. Try and be the confident one and make it comfortable for him. Make him laugh, etc. Give him some time to get comfortable. This is normal!|`|f8ON3dRfaa	He's unsure on how to move on from here. If you're waiting for him to make the first move, just be patient, encourage him subtly like asking him to do small tasks for you.<br>  <br>  Either that, or you make the first move.<br>  <br>  If the situation gets awkward, start off as good friends first (just friends mentality).|`|oche3k5taa	Hes probably never had a girlfriend before?

Your signs are often drawn to each other physically, and things can work on that level for a short while. You’ll feel bad, though, when he abandons you for the spotlight that he craves. If it’s a choice between being with you and being at the center of the excitement, he’ll choose the excitement. Leo boys also need a lot of attention and compliments, and you’ll get tired of stroking his ego when you’re not getting the same from him in return. This match is not likely to last. ( Source: Jellybean's Astro-Soulmate Guide ) <br>  <br>  You're two very different beasts…and in order to make this relationship work, you've both gotta be flexible. Taurus is straightforward and to the point, and Mr. Leo is pretty used to getting his way.  If you can agree to disagree, this can be a satisfying—and enlightening—love match.

If you break up with your current one now and go off with the 25 year old, you might have thrown away something great. If you weren't meant to be then you will inevitably break up and then you can try it with the 25 year old. You wouldn't have thought about this had she not come to your office.

The fact is, you are still being led by your ****. What you have with your gf is very new, you can't be "in love" yet. Already you are feeling that you are "mothering" her...a sweet feeling at first, but it can get annoying after a while. Maybe this new girl is sex, maybe more?|`|yFSv9sfgaa	Yeah, when someone is so much younger then you, it doesn't mean you won't get along but the maturity level and life experience level will be much different. So this other girl who is near your age, who seemingly has nothing wrong and works with you, will have a bell ringing. You have to make the right decision for you in the long run. If you are content with your girlfriend then you will have to suffer seeing this other girl at the office and if you and this other girl hit it off and you truly think it's the right thing for the end, then that's for your best.
AA10065812	├┬┤═┬┬<br>  Texas Fathers for Equal Rights<br>  <a href="http://www.tferfw.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tferfw.org/</a><br>  <br>  For 20 years I've worked with divorced and single fathers<br>  <br>  Part of the problem with getting visitation enforced is knowing what to do to prove your case, and how to remind the judge of their responsibilities.  Let me start with the judge.<br>  <br>  Always take people with you to court who are not there to testify.  Make sure they are sitting where the judge can see the, with each equipped with a tablet and pen to take notes.  Better yet, use a Court Watch Form designed for this purpose.  I have one in the manual at Dads House.<br>  <br>  If the judge is not doing his job, using the info from this form can be used to get him/her removed or sanctioned.<br>  <br>  There are things you can be doing. Most important you need to keep a daily journal on all your activities. There does not need to be any violence for a claim of violence to be filed. She gets a restraining order because she fears him because she has been preventing him from seeing her child. <br>  <br>  Many think that all courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lack the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights. This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney. It is also important to do as much as possible on his own and not pay the attorney to do it.<br>  <br>  You need to write her a letter notifying her of intent to exercise visitation rights. Make two copies, and sign all three. Mail two of them, one certified and one with Delivery Confirmation (75￠ + postage).  If she rejects the one, she still receives the other. If the certified letter come back, file it unopened. By use of an internet connection, you can print out the Confirmation of Delivery of the other letter.<br>  <a href="http://www.usps.com/send/waystosendmail/extraservices/deliveryconfirmationservice.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usps.com/send/waystosendmail/...</a> <br>  <br>  Show up with witnesses in tow. Do not enter her place alone. If you can record, have someone video record from the car. Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record audio and/or video without the woman knowing. If her state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling, which says one person in a conversation, must know they are being recorded. In Missouri, it is specifically legal, while in Kansas there is no mention either way. With two different states, if one has a law against it, than it applies only when the call originates from that state.<br>  <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/taping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/taping/</a><br>  <br>  Now, you can’t just record, you also have to transcribe the conversations your daily journal.<br>  <br>  One complaint is that the kids won’t come, but that is like to be a symptom of Parental Alienation Syndrome.<br>  <a href="http://www.parentalalienation.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentalalienation.org/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this, go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.

AA11312653	IMO it is long overdue that we recognize best friends come in all genders and ages. If this lady is indeed your husband's best friend (excepting yourself, of course) then you should be knocking yourself out to make a good impression on her. Interfering in your FH's wish to honor her in this way is not the way to do this. <br>  <br>  Of course she shouldn't wear a tuxedo and try to "be a guy" for the occasion unless her usual habit is to wear men's clothing. She should wear a dress which harmonizes with the bridesmaids' attire, but not the same dress. <br>  <br>  For the recessional, it is not necessary for the bride's and groom's attendants to form matched boy-girl pairs like so many salt & pepper sets. Attendants can walk up the aisle singly, in same-sex or mixed-sex pairs, and if the aisle is wide enough, may walk 3 or more abreast.<br>  <br>  In closing, I urge you again to cultivate this lady and welcome her into your life. Congrats and best wishes.|`|IUgkylWqaa	If she means THAT much, could he be marrying the wrong gal?<br>  Tell him it makes you uncomfortable. He should respect your wishes and just have her a a guest, or give her another job for the wedding such as guest book/greeter or candle lighter.<br>  <br>  Edit: I can see why there is tension. You said it yourself. You are jealous of her and insecure with yourself. And you said you don't get along with her. He picked you, didn't he?? You need to realize that. <br>  But still, if he knows you are uncomfortable with having her stand up on his side, maybe you two can come to a compromise- have her as bridesmaid, greeter, or something else. If this cannot be done, maybe you should rethink this marriage.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	it doesn't make your wedding weird, it makes it unique.  why do you want a trite conventional cookie cutter wedding like everyone else on earth?  do some things different.  I went to a wedding 4 days ago where the mother of the bride gave her away, not her father.  I thought it was wonderful.  of course your fiance can have a woman stand up for him instead of a guy, it's his wedding too!|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I think you're making too big of a deal out of it.  The last wedding I was at had a guy as the maid of honor.  It's becoming much more popular to have a 'man of honor', bridesman, 'best woman', and groomsman at weddings.  The point of the wedding party is to have your closest friends standing beside you and supporting you on your wedding day.  In the old days, guys only had male friends, and women had only female friends so these attendants were of the same gender.  Nowadays, cross-gender friendships are more common so the old rule of needing only female attendants for the bride's side and only male ones for the groom's side no longer applies.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	your making a big deal out of nothing.  my brother's wife had a guy as her Man of Honor, and i know loads of other couples who have had members of the oppisite sex as part of their side of the bridal party.<br>  <br>  situations like this are becoming more and more normal every day.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I think your Groom should be able to pick who he wants to have stand for his Best (wo)Man.....<br>  <br>  And, what might be cute is, have her buy the same color dress as the vests the other groomsmen are wearing, or what your bridesmaids are wearing, and put a blazer on top/tuxedo jacket.  It's really cute!!<br>  <br>  Or, have her in a simply black gown.. To match the tuxedos.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y279/NrllAless/blog/trendspotting/ashley-vanessa-trl.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y279/Nr...</a>|`|AA11220327	last year a good friend of mine had a "best woman" instead of a best man. It was fine. there were a few traditionalists that thought it was a little strange, but for the most part everyone thought that it was great. She didnt have to wear a suit or anything lol, she wore a dress that was the colour of their wedding, but a different style from the BMs|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	Yes that happens sometimes. You can have her dress be black to match their suits with the accent color as her shoes or something, and have your bridesmaids in colored dresses. Nobody is going to say anything bad, i bet you will have more compliments on it. If she means so much to him, i think you would be a bad person to tell him 'no.'|`|44Sj3bsZaa	If thats who he wants in the wedding then let him. I actually know someone that did that. Men can stand on the brides side and woman on the grooms... this is 2009 and anything goes. Show this man why he made the choice to marry YOU and give him what he wants.... cause acting like a bridezilla may push him away. You have to accept that this woman his a big part of his life and you either accept it or not be with him but obviously she isnt going anywhere. I do think you should make certain that his feelings for her are only friendship and nothing more though.|`|GpdYgi4Zaa	go with it. make her wear a tux lol. hey it is your wedding! usually the bride decides what she wants in her wedding! if he wants to have her in it than fine. you would want your fiance to be happy. <br>  <br>  I would be weirded out too if my husband wanted a girl to be his best man. I mean it is called best "man" for a reason! Isnt it good enough that she will be in the audience?! I mean..doesnt he have a best guy friend?? and if he does I wonder how hurt he must feel about your fiance picking a girl over him to be a best man. <br>  <br>  best wishes!|`|sLLgERQWaa	His choice & you ARE making a big deal out of it...<br>  My eldest aunt was 'best man' for a cousin of mine at his wedding because she was so close to him & his siblings....so what?<br>  Besides, only what the bride wants counts and the groom can go suck eggs?....his wedding too, Toots-remember that. Good luck.|`|6UmRmaeWaa	Yep. My best Friend had her brother as the "man of honor" and me the "maid of honor". Let her wear the color your girls are wearing or black to match the tuxes.<br>  <br>  It is his BFF. She deserves to stand behind him!|`|lYZ71zYAaa	If it means that much to him, go with it. Just have an extra groomsmen for her to stand up with.|`|WMR8hVlfaa	Why is it such a big deal? This is 2009. All of those wedding "traditions" are only that -- tradition. You don't have to follow them. Weddings are about two people coming together and sharing their love and joy with those they love. It's as much his special day as it is yours. If this woman means so much to him, why would you want to deny his wish to have her as part of the ceremony? Are you really THAT concerned with how other people view your wedding (re: "our wedding will seem weird")? <br>  <br>  If looks matter more to you than his feelings, go ahead and refuse. But I suggest you think about what you're doing before you pitch a fit about something that means a lot to him.|`|AleWgjvPaa	My husband's best friend is a woman and she was his Best (wo)man at our wedding and it didn't make the wedding weird and nobody actually said much about it. <br>  <br>  I can understand why you're jealous or nervous about her, I felt the same about my husband's BF since she'd been there for him when his first fiance had died and had helped him when his dad had heart surgery and all of that. But I realised that if something was going to happen between them it would have happened already. And also, he had chosen me, not her. <br>  <br>  At first I was a bit intimidated by her but after a while we both relaxed and while she'll never be my best friend or even a close friend to me, we're still ok with each other and don't expect to be anything more to each other than we are. And considering how long they'd been friends I didn't want to force him to choose. <br>  <br>  I would say let her be best man and don't try to force him into choosing someone else, after all it is his day as well and he isn't trying to dictate your Maid of Honour, is he?<br>  <br>  Let me know if you want more details about what we did with her at the ceremony and reception :)
xGshAiXOaa	Escort can mean many different things.  Since it says Hilton I would think a hotel, and escort could be a more professional name for a bell boy, or possibly a driver to/from an airport, etc.  Don't automatically assume the worst.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	I guess he is still looking then. might want to follow him sometime and see what he is up to.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	if a man looking for work .. how can u be upset with him as theres more money in that hotel .. i would say ..|`|ByUS0k8waa	Ok when you go looking for things you may just find what your looking for. Maybe he was just looking around online. It could be a number of things but your going to have to face up to being a snoop and talk to him about it to find out what he was looking for or why he was on that site. Talk to him is the key here.|`|IvMPh09baa	ok... so... what are you looking for?  you really think anyone here will know what the heck escort hilton northhampton means???<br>  <br>  I don't think that the word "escort" means the same here in the US as it does in Europe.  Try to figure out what escort means in europe.  it could mean a concierge or something at the hilton hotel?|`|gfHutvEFaa	boy, you got some great answers didn't you? <br>  <br>  I would just flat out ask him. Watch his reaction. that should tell you alot.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wY3fMViqaa	That's pretty invasive of his privacy. Would you want him looking at this question?|`|aErUKUvVaa	agree with JustMyLuck - I worked in the hotel biz for a long time.  Altho it may seem possible that a job may be called and Escort, it is highly unlikely.  Hoteliers know what that term means and stay away from it.... there are long ties between hotel guests and their "unrelated guests"...... Did the posting say Job No Longer Available?  Then call thehotel and see if there is such a job and what it entails!|`|ndQkhqZeaa	Escort<br>  Northampton   <br>  <br>  Company: Eagle Imports <br>  Salary: Not Specified<br>  <br>  Exciting Opportunity for vacancies with Hilton Escorts.

gC8xO53Oaa	No, it's not right for parents to force a child in to sports. It's a shame that they can't or won't see how it makes you feel.  I assume you have told them? As long as you get out for some type of exercise, they should let you be on this matter. I wish you luck on this.|`|AA11328507	No, they should not make you play sports, its just going to make you resent it even more and your not doing your team any justice.  Jogging is a great stress reliever and perhaps if you like it you can take up distance running.|`|pHUsumU7aa	Well i would like to agree and disagree. When i was your age, actually about 14 i had the exact same problem. I hated playing sports, and everything involved. My parents made me play all the time, when i did finally quit sports altogether ( i was 15 about to be 16) i got into alot of things i shouldn't have been doing. Now i am 23, looking back i see why they pushed to play sports, to keep me off the streets and crap like that. You won't understand until your older. Alot of kids deal with this problem, just understand if you quit you still NEED occupy your time with something good. play paintball or something else, and still occupy the time as "sports" time. If you quitting goes bad so can the relationship between you and your parents. They just want to be proud of you at the end of the day.|`|md5DmmQraa	hey i can relate to your problem... i suck in sports too... and no ofcourse your parents cannot force you into it... i am sure they must be doing it for your benifit but you must try talking to them and make them realise that its just not happening for you and you are not happy doing it... make them see that you just don't have any interest in it.... take a firm stand... i am sure they will understand sweetheart... so don't worry and just relax... nobody can force you into doing anything you don't want to.....|`|VJCyQWRzaa	how can you hate sports ?<br>  <br>  anyway just tell them how about you started up wth music, art or drama give them something dfferent or play sport but bee soo bad at it and dont get on teams and then just be ike whats the point or i was asked to leave ?|`|FsEK3Ueeaa	I think they have got the wrong idea of exicise. you dont need to do sport in order to do it. so it is not ok to force
d0526f2bf35299e2ac74512f8dff025faa	Sounds fine!  She will love it....but way want another fairly soon!!|`|Lk7TpfMKaa	Don't get a ring, get a necklace or some earrings. A ring is a symbol of engagement, so don't give her one unless you're ready to marry her. It won't mean as much and may even lower her spirits. You'll have to say, 'Here is a ring I got for you, however, I don't want to marry you yet.' Not really a romantic moment, eh?|`|ne2UQc8vaa	yes it matters..depending on the kind of girl she is. if she is the typical girl she would like it if you made her dinner, and got her flowers, and the ring, and made her favorite desert.and if there is something that shes never done/never seen or something like that that you remebered that you can do that would be really good!|`|5Lw7feUkaa	No that sounds really lovely... my bf gave me a promise ring for my bday its so special to me and I'll never take it off... also just you being with her on her special birthday I'm sure will make her really happy! Good luck!|`|z1UXptEmaa	eat her out.....that include the butt hole|`|5TNDDsFzaa	you know her right go with your Instinct if you like you'r girl will like it|`|Tp795k5taa	If I were getting a ring from my b/f it wouldn't matter to me if it were real or not. All that matters is that you thought enough of her special day to get her something that will last and mean something to her. BUT make sure the band isn't cheap so it doesn't turn her finger green!!! Make sure its at least silver or gold plated!|`|yFSv9sfgaa	As long as you tell her that it is JUST a birthday present it should be ok. But then again, girls are known for jumping to conclusions and thinking "Oh, maybe this is a promise ring and he's just nervous". Depending on your girlfriend.

AA10408380	I understand ur feelings and his. But karma's getting him back. His teen girl is probably into older guys, and they're definately into her. And he looks at those guys like the dogs they are. He knows what they want. But even if daddy dearest tells his girl this, she's in denial, and in love. she won't get it until either it's too late, or the buzzard makes a move, n she thinks, gosh, dad was right. Of course ur upset, because ur a lady, so we think back when we were kids. Our men, are wonderful, so we would never think that they were dogs once. That they preyed on innocent girls n commited crimes of passion. I know, it's sick when u think of ur kid with an adult, even if it's a year. <br>  <br>  I mean, have u dated an older guy when u were a teen? But I bet it's grossing u out now that ur daughter might. Parents dont relize the error in their ways until their kids do it. Our kids are supposed to be better than we were. They're supposed to know better, have better impulse control, etc. But that's all in our heads, the truth is, it's harder for kids these days, because there are more oppurtunities now than there were when u guys were kids. Plus, ur looking at it through different eyes.<br>  <br>  To ur hubby, his then gf wasn't someone's daughter, or sister, or mother, or friend. She was just a hot young girl he wanted to get frisky with. But now hes' seeing what he should've seen, he's knowing what her dad wanted to do to him if he found out. But alas, ur baby girl is gonna go through the same tests that u guys did when u dated...here's hoping she'll make some wise choices.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	My how things really change when a man becomes a faher especially of daughters. Its a whole new perspective on things. But being in the s me boat now with 2 adult daughters, I cant imagine why some Father never shot me. I have a hard enough time watching my girls when they dated someone their own age lone less someone older especially when that boy reminded me of me. Time changes all of us eventually and we start to see what as.holes we really were growing up and dating. What were we thinking then and how could we ever possibly hold it against our daughters and the boys they date when we once did the same thing. I guess we forget alot or want to getting older and being a father. really good quetion to put things into perspective, thank you for the trip down memeory lane too|`|lJhl3wLAaa	The past is the past. When I was a sophomore aged 15 I dated and had sex with a senior. He was 17 and then turned 18. At the time I didn't see anything wrong with it. I wouldn't care about it. Now if he was 35 and still interested in 15 year olds then I would care.|`|XfSvwiVDaa	Get over it!  When you were 15 you probably would have slept with an 18 year old too.  I was 17 and my husband was 26 when we first did it.<br>  We have been married now for 14 years.  It is not a big deal if the girl wanted it like he did.|`|AA11124885	Tough call. Were there any resulting consequences, like pregnancy, at the time?  Was he forthcoming with it or did he try to lie?  Was anyone hurt?  It really just depends how You feel about it, why ask everyone else?  Your opinion is the only one that matters here.  Seriously.|`|kyqhMuSiaa	That was your husbands business in the past leave it in the past. Of course he is going to be upset about his daughter he is older and wiser now. I don't think it's a cause for being upset. Use it to inform daughter.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	age differencewasnt that bad,its not like he's a pedophile or anything...and it was a long time ago, i think,and i hope he's over that...|`|5hxWSezPaa	Why is what happened in his heterosexual sex life 17 years ago relevant unless he forcibly raped her.|`|j6MvCr6Naa	First of all, I don't think the age difference matters as long as they knew what they were getting into. I think that as long as they took it slow, the girls wanted what he had to offer and he didn't force them into anything they didn't want to do it really doesn't matter. Everybody grows up at some point be it 15 or 18 right? I know from personnel experience that it's not the age that matters, but the maturity of the person.<br>  <br>  Personnaly I woudn't mind if my daughter would be going out with a guy that was a few years older than her, even if she was only 16 for example. But only if I knew that guy well enough to trust him with my daughter, if I knew that he wouldn't hurt her ot preassure her to do anything against her will.<br>  <br>  To be honest, I think your husband feels guilty about his past, what he did is not exactly an acceptable thing to do in today's society. However, the past is that past and there's nothing anybody can do to change it now.|`|Rsi785nsaa	That is only a 3 year difference. i might be disgusted if my husband was 25 with and slept with a 15 year old girl. But the fact is that there isn't a huge difference in two teenagers lifestyles. The past is the past and just raise your daughter the best you can and she will be able to handle what comes her way as a teenager.|`|eawDlYHnaa	well i wouldn't be upset with him because thats been so long ago and hes just trying to be a good parent because looking back at his experiences, it probably wasn't worth it. however, it all just depends on how big the age gap is and how much he/you trusts his daughters b/f. if their is a substantial age gap then i'd  for sure be worried and be more worried that he's using this girl for sex only. if this is a big problem, he should talk to the daughter and her boyfriend about the issue.|`|eWMn7dhKaa	The past is in the past, however those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.  You may want to forgive your thoughts of your husband and how you may feel about him with this new-found knowledge of yours.<br>  <br>  Also, just to let you know, Karma has a way of catching up to people.  I think she found your husband.|`|ZEitfScGaa	Its fine, I know its "illegal" but it happens all the time with high school kids. If he was doing it now, then thats a problem.|`|CKnHMYHnaa	Oh Get over it!  I think the pregnancy hormones are getting to you.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	My husband is 34. I wouldn't be upset about anything that happened when he was 18 or 19 unless he caught herpes or something like that that would affect me now. <br>  <br>  All of the women in my family have been with older men while being really young. My mother married my father who was 14yrs her senior when she was 20. My older sister dated a man who was 8yrs her senior when she 18. My son's father was 9yrs my senior and I was underage- only 15, when I met him. So, I can really relate to a young girl who wants to be in a relationship with an older guy. I know that not all older guys who's in a relationship with a young girl, is out to harm her in any way. My son's father was a great man and an excellent father. He was a great deal older than me but he never took advantage of that. He didn't try and persuade me to do things or manipulate me in any way and I'm glad to have ever met him.<br>  <br>  None of that would change me getting upset about my underage teenage daughter dating an older man. Living it, doesn't change your knowledge of the reality of it. I know that normally, when a young girl gets involved with an older guy, it doesn't turn out good- even though that wasn't my experience. So, it is very much so possible for your hubby to not want something for his kids that he was involved in himself. I wouldn't want my daughter or son to date someone older if they were underage, nor would I want them to date someone underage if they were older. I'd try to give them the benefit of my experiences.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	When you are 15, 18 is HARDLY an "older man".......|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Excuse me, but exactly what does this have to do with you?<br>  <br>  You dig back almost 15 years, find some fault of your husband's, bring it forward to present day, and presume to be angry about it?!<br>  <br>  If you want to be upset about something....at least pick something that happened recently and happened to you.<br>  <br>  Good Lord!|`|t81MEJ82aa	Lovely, another question asking "Should I retroactively be upset with my husband?"<br>  <br>  I couldn't imagine myself being more upset that my 15 year old daughter is having sex with an 18 year old vs. a 14,15,16, or 17 year old.|`|vFCva8R5aa	I wouldn't mind because i AM (or was actually) That underage girl that my husband slept with. <br>  <br>  I was 16...he was 20. <br>  <br>  It is not that big of an age difference, at 16 i was living on my own with a full time job and an apartment.<br>  <br>  I am now 26 and he is 30|`|m81dfyOYaa	Why are you dragging this up now, this was 18 years ago?
q7NrlanJaa	Ha yeah I know what you mean.

There's only so many things you can change to a wedding dress that is still sell-able!!  Designers can make a really funky change to the white gown, but who would buy it?  So, most of them have the same silhouettes, matrial, styles, etc.<br>  <br>  I love mine too, but I have seen others similiar to mine... But, I know mine isn't as common as most :)  <br>  <br>  Besides, it's how you feel in it, right?  :)|`|nqINitkmaa	I totally know what you mean! Meeting with photographers and looking at wedding after wedding and bride after bride all the dresses and brides start to look the same. All that matters is that you feel beautiful and that you are getting married to the man you love.|`|Qgg6i6K7aa	I always wanted my wedding dress with long sheer sleeves. <br>  When I was looking for my dress, it was so difficult to find any dress with sleeves at all. <br>  At David's Bridal there was a dress that I loved, it was long sheer lace jacket that went over the dress.<br>  The dress itself was strapless and even though I vowed not to wear a strapless dress because they all do tend to look alike. <br>  I bought my strapless wedding dress with long sheer lace jacket and I wore the jacket for the ceremony and most of my pictures. <br>  Then for reception I took off the jacket and just wore my strapless dress. <br>  I loved it, the strapless was perfect for the July wedding. <br>  But, my dress does look very similar to other wedding dresses.|`|HJ0YTWjVaa	I agree! I absolutely refused to buy a strapless gown! They do look different up close, but what do you remember most about the brides dress at weddings you have attended? Most are strapless! I have been in 3 weddings in the past year and I couldn't tell you anything about the dresses except they were all three strapless!<br>  <br>  I found my dress at Davids bridal and it was an OMG this is my dress moment. It is a halter, mermaid dress. The dress was a "preview" dress and only 10 were made for all of the Davids Bridals. Its not on the website. It is a little different, but I am sure no one will remember it but me and my mom!|`|AkUhaMm9aa	for me it wasn't like they all looked the same...i think most wedding dresses are beautiful in their own way...but when you try on THE dress..somehow you know..even after you look at other stores you keep going back to that one..and keep comparing other with the special dress..until someone tells you...stop looking! you already know which one is your dress....at least that's what happened to me.<br>  <br>  you just want to make sure you dont miss on another dress...|`|RuKK1LYiaa	i fell in love with my dress the moment i put it on and it looks so different than the rest, after they put it on me at the store i didnt want to take it off and i refused to try on anymore dresses cause i found the one i want. heres a link to my dress if you click alternate view you can view it better even though its the backside<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplayView?storeId=10052&catalogId=10051&catentryId=1000438" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/s...</a><br>  <br>  i dont have broad shoulders either and i looked at halters first but none of them looked right on me cause im so tiny.|`|2MrzC7T8aa	I tried on real wedding dresses for the first time today and what a disappointment. There was about 100 dresses and 99% were strapless. For the last few years every wedding photo I've seen in the newspapers has looked identical and no wonder when shops only have one design. I bought one of those make-to-order dresses from ebay coz when I saw the picture, it was like the dress I've wanted since I was little. When it arrived and I put it on, sadly my heart didn't skip a beat and I've never felt happy with it. So I'm back to the drawing board and now I want a non-wedding wedding dress if you understand. Honestly, what a pickle I've got myself into!!!|`|pfjxEZBmaa	My dress looks nothing like any other dress I looked at. So no, but the other ones look all the same.
5IkZ64aFaa	Dealing with siblings, making friends and just coping with school culture is difficult at times.  Did you ever think that your sister may be feeling the same way about some of what you describe?  <br>  Some questions to ask yourself:  What makes you unique?  What do you have control over?  Who do you look up to as a role model or a mentor?   Make a list of all the positives.  Sometimes its easy for us to be hard on ourselves and think about the negatives.  If you have the capability to change something, then really make that your goal.  So for example, we all make choices.  Try out for a sports team or a club.  You may surprise yourself by making the team, and if you join a club or sport, you will meet others that share that interest.  Should you not make the team, try and focus on the fact that you gave it your all and that is the best you can do.  Become a volunteer in your community.  You can be mentor, help animals or help an elderly person.  (The possibilites of volunteering are endless!)  And should you decide to do this, you have helped someone and this in turn makes you feel better about yourself and your world.  Another idea is helping out more at home.  You will be teaching yourself independent living skills which you will always need and fall back on in the future.  Some ideas would be: helping with the grocery shopping list, cooking, cleaning, laundry, washing the car, yard work, etc.  <br>  Try to do your best on staying positive.  This will help you in the process of working on your self esteem.  The fact that you are reaching out for help is a big positive choice.  <br>  If you feel you need to talk to someone, please consider calling the Boys Town National Hotline at 1-800-448-3000.  Our focus is helping kids and families deal with various issues, and we have counselors available 24/7 .  Take care, Counselor KJ

Or maybe, since he won't have you over later, he only really wants you for the sex and doesn't really care to see you at other times.|`|defzWOvMaa	thats messed up he does that. but why dont u stay when his mom doesnt have to come? its not fair that he wants to sleep with you and then he puts u out. are you guys under age? why is he scared of his mom knowing u sleep over? idk, but if you guys are olde enough he shouldnt be doing that, its not cool at all......you should have a talk with him. i know if my bf was doing that id be pissed. good luck|`|oJV3rvsRaa	well you are obviously a booty call my dear... sorry to tell you but thats what it sounds like.. id get out of this fast, because you are only going to hurt yourself in the end <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Au8imTlibuLZ7Mp5kxwD12Xsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304122310AAGvcdD">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|3bpwLPxjaa	I think you know something is wrong with it. Why else would be bothered by it so much to post it?<br>  you are right girl. Its wrong.  I dont care if he is protecting you from his momma or not.  You are demeaning your self respect!|`|MkZ3hzTEaa	Yeah sweetie, talk to him. He could be a little bit more tactful here. Talk to your bf and tell him how he feels. His reaction is the key to your question.|`|KNqFM5rEaa	I think you guys should be able to work something out a little better than that. you guys should talk about it. if he doesn't try to work something out then yes, he's a jerk.|`|58517095dceeda56c9aff2f3286f96f3aa	he is a jerk!<br>  your first thought is always right...<br>  he doesnt want to be in a relationship with you...<br>  he wants you to be his fu@! buddy...<br>  id dumb him quick...<br>  im a guy and i know this kinds of things...|`|8rfEU7Rlaa	you need to find someone who doesnt care about wat his mom says|`|yFSv9sfgaa	tell him how you feels and if he doesn't change. jerk.|`|9hoz5Xn8aa	He doesn't want to get caught. You are overreacting!|`|8t7E9S1taa	he might be a jerk how old is he anyways|`|vmLdgBfraa	i personally wouldnt do that to a girl... if he really cared then he would stay with you...|`|Ob6m9z4oaa	Talk 2 him bout it. If u dont ask him then u wont no.|`|BXgqdaMVaa	lol..WOW!!..he ain't a jerk lol..people hatin on em because he a Pimp lol|`|MdmkM1KQaa	Okay, It's fine that he lives with his parents, anyone could be in that situation for a variety of reasons. So you live quite a distance from him? I would say that you need to kick back for a bit and let him put in a little bit of the effort. If he doesn't put in any effort, then you know that he isn't worth your time. If he does, then open up to him more and tell him how it makes you feel when you have to leave in the morning. Trust me, for a relationship to work, the effort levels need to be right around equal. You shouldn't always be the one going to his house. Why doesn't he come to your town for the day, or splurge for a hotel room one weekend?? Also, I strongly recommend the book "Why men Love Bitches." It will teach you what to put up with when it comes to your man, and when you just need to walk away and tell yourself that you deserve something better.|`|Q13UIQGyaa	that is not at all a good way to treat your gf. if you don't spend time together part from the occasional sex at his house then that is not a good relationship to be in my dear. if he loves you then he should make an effort to see you mid day too, to talk. cos relationships should not be about sex only!<br>  <br>  who knows what he does all the time you not together. i  agree with someone who says you got to look for someone who doesn't stay with his mom, you deserve better. or else he look for his own place where you guys can be free to be with each other any time you wish.<br>  <br>  you are not overreacting gal. you deserve much MUCH better.
9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Just ignore them, and don't bring the subject up. Don't talk about movies with them, talk about other things. I love horror movies, I'm in my 30's and I'm no serial killer, nor do I think about killing people, and I'm not a freak. Millions of people watch those types of movies and are just fine. Your family don't like them and that's fine, they don't have too. There for they don't have to watch them. Best thing to do is just not talk to them about it, they have there opinion, you have yours, and neither will change their minds. Just agree to disagree.|`|EJAvOHxGaa	Hey, you watch what you like to watch and if they have a problem with it, tell them you don't make a fuss over what they watch.  If you are concerned that they will burn your collection, lock your DVDs in a safe box.  <br>  <br>  Personally, a good old horror film is better any day than some run of the mill snogging and kissing and &*&** all the time.|`|KweMUxUdaa	All you can say is something like "that is your personal opinion, however, I like them for the creativity that is shown in them" If it persists, than maybe you should talk to your parents and let them know that it is making you feel uncomfortable saying this kind of stuff. It is just a movie, make believe with awesome graphics that is all, and I highly doubt that you take them seriously.|`|lapMAm0Aaa	hip...LOL<br>  <br>  but anyways you should buy an iPod(classic preferably) and just doownload your horror movies there. That should keep your parents or relatives from worrying about anything you watch.|`|e27fe1a9205b53137b4cbd03b8a47947aa	I hate the bloody/gory films, too. When I watch a movie I want to be entertained not grossed out. A suspenseful movie is always better than a gory movie.|`|lc9nus8taa	rent afew barbie movies and hide the horror ones|`|vEv2YwWdaa	Tell them it is your choice.  If they do not like it that is fine, but it is not their place to comment.|`|0erdxZeHaa	Just ignore them, it will drive them crazy if you don't talk about it.|`|bGyVJ6meaa	replace your dvds with ones for 4 yr old girl like "my little pony"<br>  <br>  see what they think then|`|QdkJYcpFaa	Its called freedom of choice. Tell them to look that up|`|I0O385V7aa	This is gonna sound kinda nasty, but it's meant to be motivating rather than insulting:<br>  <br>  Get a backbone!!! Confidence is such a powerful tool!<br>  <br>  And here's some confidence for you! Your aunt and uncle are just being close minded and irrational. They are wrong! You are right! Therefore, it is perfectly acceptable for you to stand up to them and let them know that is the case. Horror films are perfectly acceptable among teenagers! Most of my friends LOVE horror films! (I personally don't like them, but I scare REALLY easily. Like I'm a proper wimp. Surely being able to enjoy horror films suggests something brave about your personality?)<br>  <br>  Just stand up to them. If they make a comment like that again, don't let it go! Bite their head off!|`|YrrtMS5Taa	They're leaving soon right? You have two options.<br>  <br>  1: Ignore them. You and I and sane, logical, people know those are lies (well the first three, the fourth is a question and the last two aren't questions). It's hard, sure, but like I said... we know it's not true... so why let it get to you?<br>  <br>  2: Calmly (DO NOT raise your voice or show anger or frustration) tell them "Actually that's not true. You don't have to like Horror films but I do, and I don't go around trashing your favorite movies so don't do it to me." and walk away. For the last one I would add "Well if you do you'll have to pay for the "normal" teen films AND pay to replace all my Horror films." Because yeah if they really did destroy your collection you could take action against them if you have proof.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fc4NOCp3aa	Geez - give me a break!  Your aunt & uncle might have a reason to worry IF you ONLY ever watched horror movies AND you happened to also have miscellanous weapons hanging on your walls and you talked about death all the time!  There's nothing wrong with liking horror movies!  It gets the heart pumping and the special effects are amazing most of the time.  There are also some really funny horror movies like Shaun of the Dead!  Most horror films are downright cheesy and most how watch them don't take them seriously as some high art form but rather as silly entertainment.  Tell your aunt & uncle to calm down.  There's nothing wrong with you pscyhologically.  And since it's a sore subject, don't talk about stuff like that in front of them!  If you know it bothers them, why would you even bring up the topic?
52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	I have no doubt that my Mother would. The only time I ever heard of her threatening anyone was over me. She told our principal that she was on the way to the school to whip a teacher in front of every kid in the school. The principal backed down and she did not do it. She was the most Christian person that I have ever known but, don't mess with her boys. She loved us like a rock as the song says.<br>  I can imagine Belle unloading on the idiot. She was just teaching the guy some good Southern manors..<br>  And I'm doing fine and will be off the smokes by March 13th. That was Mother's B-day. My motivation is to give her all I can and she would really have liked that idea. More about it later. It's kinda creepy.|`|eoQoCcz5aa	Myself one thinks that is lovely . Fair play to your Mum  , that she is 98 years old and she is still strong in Mind Body and Soul to still  be active . Please remember you only get 1 Mum make sure you treasure her .<br>             Kindest regards , cheerio .|`|ZqHqKDqEaa	For starters, god bless that your mom is still alive at 98. <br>  <br>  Yes, my mom is quite protective, but I think it's cute. She doesn't do it in a way that is harmful. That's the role of a mother.|`|htWw0OlCaa	Wow!! 98... God has been good to her. Mothers don't care how old their children are, they will always be protective of their baby. Best wishes to you and your mom.|`|fBso80Ubaa	I think what your mom is doing is wrong.  Make it very clear that when she does that being protective thing, it's hurtful to you emotionally.  If logic and persuasion won't work, going the "it's hurting me" route might.  But at the same time, give her a break; she's 98.  You don't know how much more time she'll be around.  So at the minimum, treat her with respect, and give her the benefit of doubt when she deserves it.  You don't want her last memory of you to be something unpleasant.|`|sNjxUpj0aa	Just tell her your not a little child and can take care of yourself, but thank her for caring so much. Yes my mother is protective, and always wants to deal with my problems for me. Its how ALL mothers are|`|hCcNwUTVaa	I think moms will always try and protect the ones they love...more specifically their children.  That's a great story though.  I'm glad he got a talkin' to! lol Good job mom! =)  <br>  <br>  PS:  98..thats amazing!|`|yLRY1c7iaa	Go Mom !!!!!<br>  <br>  Be thankful you have a mom who still cares. You will always be her child. Think about the people who's mom do not even care.|`|AA11573840	Once a mom, always a mom.|`|NdhFM3l0aa	no matter how old your mom is 98 28 or even 108 there always going to be protective over you.. its there jobs|`|vEv2YwWdaa	That's what moms are supposed to do.|`|Vzzc6mATaa	Well that's mums for you|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	I don't call that protective.

If he has any respect for you then he wouldn't do that. <br>  I say you just be up front and tell him how you feel and see how he responds. If he doesn't agree then at least you will know and you guys can move on and just be friends, it might be awkward in the beginning but it doesn't sound like you guys run into each other all that much. So just be up front and be honest and come out and tell him how you feel.|`|BfQd59g9aa	alright first of all if you rlly love this person what others think bout you too shouldnt matter they wont be with u when u guys r at dinners or the movies or ne oof that so dont worry bout what others think second... if ur afraid to tell him then keep hanging out with him and see what kinda signs or moves he gives you if u feel positive that he likes you then try to get it out of him usually guys r the ones that come forth with how they feel third listen ive dated a girl on and off for almost 5 years and im 19 i would find a way to see her even if she lives in florida or california and i live in new york... love has no boundaries love can take people no other emoition or feeling can so if you have to play it safe do it or if u want to go for the gold do it.... stop using ur head and follow your heart!!!!!!|`|CFPyF2eoaa	hmm..well its all in how you handle it.if i was you..id make it seem like no big deal as far as a date goes..ya know? dont make it seem like youve ALWAYS wanted him and blah blah.youll come off as desperate.if you handle it casually, he'll probably be alot less likely to turn it down.and even if he does, you can play it off like you dont care or something.or that it was a joke..i mean youd REALLY have to know what you were doing to do that though.and the worst that happens if you handle it casually is its kinda awkward between you guys for a little while.but then if you get it time a give him his space, you can come back around after a little while and be friends again.in the scheme of things, if the worst thing that happens is its awkward then its not that big of a deal.go for it girl ;)|`|hUt8Vt7oaa	You need to figure out if he likes you back. <br>  <br>  When you talk to him, keep the conversation light and don't get too heavy on your strong feelings for him. However, make it clear that you are interested in him as more than "just friends". Feel him out, and then casually ask him out. Make it clear that you're asking him out on a date and not just to "hang out as friends". <br>  <br>  Most likely he'll go for it-- Guys are easier than girls.
Z6CJApzJaa	Honestly as long as your not getting married right away then I don't see the problem. My husband and I went through the same thing except 5 years ago and I was 19 when he left for boot camp. Now we are still married. I will warn you that the military lifestyle is very hard and will make you think twice about your decisions. The one thing I would suggest is to go to school (college) As soon as you finish school. Get something behind you so when yall do get married you have a career to. I wish you the best.|`|AAbP4H9Kaa	Honestly, I'm 16 turning 17, and I feel like I'm still in a period where I get indecisive, my mother always tells me that with boys I'll find a guy boring/uninteresting/etc. after 2-6 months. Honestly, if you really think you're in love, and that you'll make it, then why not wait. If it works and it's meant to be then you can get married later. And have you talked to your parents about it? I think if i were you I would because parents have gone through so much more that us. ;) hope you stay ... non married :D|`|8t7E9S1taa	i got married at 16 nd im 23 now nd im still married to him .. if u to r really inlove no matter what the relationship will be the same either if u to r dating just on first level ,having sex, or married|`|uIZDd3y5aa	If you really love one another why does it matter how old you are. It also sounds like you guys have known each other for a while, I think it's fine. Good luck!|`|JT92LbRdaa	First off I am a  Marine and dealt with with the same situation. I got engaged to my WIFE when I was 18, she was 17. We had been together for 3 years before I left for boot camp, I left 3 months after my 18th birthday. We have now been together for 5 years. Him becoming a Marine WILL change him permanently. You may not like what he becomes, my wife and myself still fight about how I have Changed. Also the divorce rate in the Marine Corps is around 96%. The Marines have the highest divorce rate among Americans. He will leave often for war, this will be hard on you. He will leave for 6-9 months at a time, then come back for 6 months and leave again. Each time he returns he will become less emotional and become harder on you. You two really need to evaluate your relationship before moving on, odds are I'm sorry to say, you probably wont be married more than 3 years if he joins the Marines. My wife and myself have brought up divorce several times and we have been married for 2 years, our relationship was perfect before I joined, now it is terrible.|`|h6eFkvL8aa	In the circumstances you are in, I would tell you that getting engaged is alright. I would recommend that you don't get married until your fiance finishes his first enlistment. This will give you about 3-4 years to really think about your life together. It will also give him a reason to come back to you, and not get injured or killed. You two have been together a while, and young love can last a long time. I wish both of you happiness and a long time together|`|QQd1C9HGaa	this may sound corny but listen to your heart and then youll know|`|BeKhcWSTaa	I think it largely depends on the couple and their maturity level. I know 16 year olds who could probably be happily married, and also 30 year olds who would never last in a marriage.I just think it's important that you're doing it for the right reasons, not just because he is going to bootcamp and you think it needs to be rushed. Also, it's important to live together before getting married. I have been in perfectly fuctioning relationships that went down the drain once we moved in together. But after it all, if you love each other and think you can make it work financially (sucks that has to be mentioned but it of course does) then **** what everyone else thinks! My grandparents got married at 18 and were together for 60 years!--Who says it has to be any different now-a-days because of social expectations.|`|u7LSohRyaa	I don't have a problem with it in the right situation. In this case, I can see how you'd be in a hurry to tie the knot but you might regret it. Maybe you would do better off seeing how it turns out, wait until you're 18 and then go for it, if you still feel the same. If he joins the marines, you could end up moving all over the country. You might be really sick of the military life and hate being separated from him so long that it's just not worth it to you anymore. On top of that, you'll have to live with the question of what you'll do if he doesn't come back. I don't envy the military wife myself. I don't like my husband being gone overnight forget him being gone for months! At least you have lots of free time? What happens if you get pregnant and your kids don't get to see their father for months? Some guys have come home several months after the baby was born for the first time. I'd be miserable if that happened to me. Your choice.|`|QbJ04Zqiaa	I think it is a stupid idea. You guys are way too young.

Second, take a deep breath and jump in.  A counselor or attorney should be able to help you take the necessary steps of separation or divorce.

The only thing you may have to work at is forging new interests and social activities, if you want to.<br>  As for the work place, well, you do have what they call 'transferable skills'. You managed a household, so what about budgetary skills, organisational skills, planning skills? Any woman who has 'stayed at home' and managed  family life has transferable skills it is just about recognising what  you did to keep the family functioning that can be translated into a work based scenario.<br>  As for finding someone to love you before it is too late, well, I believe it is never too late even as a 54 year od singleton .

Make a list of what it is you want to do, where you would live and how you will support yourself.  Do not be afraid, if you don't have money, after you start legal proceedings he may even have to pay your legal fees, not to mention alimony. Be strong, it is not easy to make this type of choice.

After the small party, I rented a Limo and me and my closest girlfriends went out to hits the bars, etc. <br>  <br>  I would tell your future sister-in-laws that before you and your girlfriends go out, you are having a small party at your house (or dinner beforehand, etc.) and invite them.|`|No3wL14Yaa	I say talk to them and let them know that you would love for them to be at the bachelorette party but ask if they would be offended or embarassed by these events(like the ones you listed) and see if they would be okay with all the games and the gifts. They may be a lot more fun then you know.|`|tqFdbFPNaa	I say talk to them and let them know that you would love for them to be at the bachelorette party but ask if they would be offended or embarassed by these events(like the ones you listed) and see if they would be okay with all the games and the gifts. best of luck[:|`|AA11184374	i would invite them they r family.talk to them it might bring yall closer together.let them know thet r loved .then they will return the favor. they might think they r not welcome.family is family.good luck.|`|CkN4pgpCaa	I understand your dilemma!  My fiance's sister will be one of my bridesmaids, but she's much younger than us.  She is planning on coming to my bachelorette party, but I thought it might be kind of weird.  She won't know anyone and I don't know if I'll be entirely comfortable with her there. She has a habit of telling her mom and brother (my fiance) absolutely every mundane detail of her life, so I'm sure she will blab about everything.  I decided to have a more 'tame' bachelorette party that she will be invited to, but have a fun night out with just a couple of my closest friends another night.  My fiance will be taking a whole weekend for his party, so why can't I?  <br>  <br>  Anyway, enough about me... If you don't think that you can relax and enjoy yourself with the sisters there, then I suggest you invite them to a 'tamer' party and go out with your friends another night.  Good luck!
Yi9iTmWNaa	No, violence is not the answer. =D|`|XfSvwiVDaa	What if she beats the s.h.i.t. out of you and lola?|`|bqPr6kc6aa	noo that sounds stupid. just ignore the clown she's got her own issues that you shouldnt waste your time with, let her be the mess and hold your held up high, forget about people like her and move on! there are better things in life to do that worry about than drama. if shes really a big problem, let people realize you dont understand the stupid games theyre playing and youre just trying to live your life without this nonsense|`|WnCTxGQNaa	If it were me I would want to beat her *** but you should be careful to not get arrested.|`|9OHeder5aa	Beat the s.h.i.t. out of her... but videotape it and put it on youtube.|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	no best thing to do is walk a away|`|xWtW2kHraa	Very simple: say good bye to the ***** and don't get involved with drama.<br>  Never get involved with violence. Wanna go to jail over this?|`|UbnKabQOaa	u kinda got 2 look at the outcome like wat if she tells the police?? and ur the 1 who gets into **** and then it mightt be trial and court|`|H5Spvghcaa	Violence is never a good answer. If you result in beating this girl, you could suffer jail time. Since you are not her parent/guardian, if you harm her in any way, you will be sentenced to jail, or have to do community service because of intentionally harming this person. There are a few alternatives that you can go about. All of them are legal, but they can also help put her in her place. <br>  1. Go to her parents and tell her about all of the terrible things she has caused you and your friend. If her parents are responsible, or understand and want to help, she will most likely get into trouble and will stop her behavior. <br>  2. Tell the principle, or female therapist. If you do this, they will talk to the girl, and will give her consequences for her actions. <br>  3. Go onto an speaker at school. If you mortify the girl in front of the whole school, she will be mistreated by others, and stop her behavior. <br>  4. Confronter her, while you have someone else video tape it. When she is being confronted in a private setting she might tell the truth, and then if you are secretly recording it, you can then post it on youtube or some other popular website, and put flyers up about the video. If you forward the video to multiple people, put flyers up, and tell others about the video on youtube, she will be mortified and the girl will stop her behavior, because people will shun her at school, after she confesses the truth. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Violence can lead to a life in prison, not a good idea.
zxQT3Uo5aa	It seems as though she does.|`|a1c47082c5350245c9dbdf316c0424c1aa	Yes, she definitely likes you...why haven't you asked her out yet? all you guys are doing is torturing yourselves lol..get together already :)|`|8JtGkqDGaa	I think so but give some time to rebuild the relationship since you haven't really talked in a few months.|`|451ded38071eb1d1c5ce11c28a9e627daa	Yes.|`|wF4wiNCraa	ask her out!!!!|`|8871u9gMaa	I truly think this girl loves you.<br>  But she wants you to make the first move.<br>  Just go for it, or else you'll regret it later!<br>  xx|`|Ob6m9z4oaa	By da sounds of it she likes u. If ur gud mate then there will b no harm in asking her out. Just say fancy going out sum time if nt no, worries! Gud luck!!|`|rFESfymOaa	yesser|`|F4eVMDqHaa	yes|`|FsEK3Ueeaa	yes|`|hUt8Vt7oaa	Sounds like it.<br>  <br>  Also sounds like you're in a precarious position-- Somewhere between potential boyfriend and the Friend Zone.<br>  <br>  Avoid the Friend Zone at all costs. If you ask her out and she says "I don't want to ruin our friendship," Back away slowly and distance yourself from her over the next few weeks. Rarely talk to her and play hard to get. Talk about other women to her. Make her jealous. Make her come to you and want to take it beyond "just friends".

We're using a mix of orange, yellow, and either pink or red. :) I'm going for springy colors that will be fun and playful.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	peachy colors or , yellow|`|AA10447677	My sister used aqua & chocolate for a May wedding. It was stunning.|`|VS62RJQSaa	purple pink blue|`|tqFdbFPNaa	Okay, since your wedding falls in the middle of summer, i would highly suggest to go with light colors, because it you wear dark colors you will be sweating like crazy and you dont want that. Try pinks,light oranges, yellow,aqua,tan,light purple. dont go with the darks like violet or red. well best of luck at your wedding and planning the colors for your wedding. Congrats too. xD|`|cPjEXQ3uaa	I'm going to use yellow and grass green with a little bit of navy, my favorite color is red, but I like those color combos better :)  <br>  <br>  Consider your bridesmaid's complexions and coloring and what color of tuxes you want the men to wear. Also, you might take a look at the venue and see what colors would go well or totally clash.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|cOySMgihaa	Pastel colors. Pale pink, baby blue, sea green, LIGHT yellow. Colors that wont make your bridesmaids sweat to death and smell bad <br>  <br>  (I had that issue before)<br>  <br>  Oh, and if it's a summer wedding dont out huge ball gowns on your bridesmaids. It sucks|`|9545873f9308ee4850c589409030bda6aa	Well, i guess that this choice is very personal, but i like yellow, light orange or lilac, and i think they are beautiful colors to a wedding in the summer.|`|oAsAOkgQaa	i am gettin married in the summer time to...i want to use like a light orange or sky blue...Something light and simple...But its really all up to you and the groom|`|eK97o0wVaa	YELLOW|`|ce7e13614e2872704d8c14a8461e69a3aa	Yellow and blue are always a good call.|`|YM3jlriXaa	hiya x<br>  <br>  go for a red or white boob tube dress x<br>  <br>  ohh and neva go for creamy x<br>  <br>  <br>  xxxx<br>  xxxx<br>  xxxx<br>  xxxx
fpHblEtAaa	I had the same experience 2 years ago with a girl who everyone thought was plain weird and wander around the place looking for friends I was one of those who was caught as her friend.. <br>  Well I think you should either ignore her if she bothers you, avoid her if she comes to you, or  wait until she finds a new group to be in. Or say it in her face "were not friends so leave me alone." But for me it's to mean to say that, but these are ONLY used if you have the heart to! I would just ignore or help out and thats it. Hope this helps! ;)|`|6NPv1TKQaa	Step 1<br>  shut the he** up. <br>  You "popular" girls are all the same...full of crap.<br>  Step 2<br>  Give the annoying girl a chance, she doesnt fit in, hmm? Well did you even consider seeing how nice a person she is besides how pretty she is? Because I suppose thats what you mean by "fit in"<br>  Step 3<br>  If shes that bad, ignore her. Don't talk to her don't reply to her texts, and if she stil doesnt give up explain to her how you feel.<br>  TaDa|`|bw9b8bzPaa	Right now i'm having the same problem. Just ignore her. She'll eventually hang out with another group. The grl that hangs out with me is welllll a NERD. I'm part of the popular/skater group like you. She just came over one day and started talking one day. So annoying.|`|P26ekyGWaa	i know what you mean i don't wanna sound stengy and cocky by saying i am "popular" but there is a chick at school who EVERYONE finds annoying even the nerds haha<br>  <br>  i told her the STFU and she left me alone|`|HaRVuFCOaa	Well...<br>  Try to be friends with her and she how she is.<br>  If not try not to talk to her as much, but this can hurt her feelings. Unless you are the type of person that isn't bothered about other people's feelings.But try thinking like her, treat people the way you want to be treated.See if this can help.|`|A6XCcKIuaa	Haha I'm in the exact same situation lol.. I just became really distant to her and try to avoid her as much as possible.. <br>  =] x
krQiDGCHaa	Hmm honestly?  I haven't had a fantasy that I have been unable to share with my husband, likewise for him I think.<br>  <br>  We tell one another some pretty far out things, but we are pretty much up for trying almost anything together.  We are both fairly sexually adventerous.<br>  <br>  Neither of us are interested in 3-somes.  I once asked him if it was a fantasy of his, and he said even though it would be fun and such, he would have no desire to do one with me, because he doesn't want to be intimate with anyone else, and doesn't want *me* intimate with anyone else.  I feel the same, and wouldn't want a threesome, even though sometimes it's fun to fantasize about.<br>  <br>  As far as things we would actually TRY together, we're very open about that!  It's all in fun!  Try anything once. ;)<br>  <br>  ADD:  A big and commen fantasy of his is the schoolgirl (not that it's that ranuchy, out there, or even one of our more "exciting" ones, LOL) but it's something he 'gets off' to so much that I actually do own my own entire "schoolgirl" get up. ;)  Plaid skirt, tight button down, stockings, pigtails, and all. ;)  It's fun!|`|Bc4udMhUaa	I'm not sure why you would tell your spouse if you know in no way it would come true nor would you really want it to. I would only relay fantasies that I was hoping and expecting we could act on.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	if you dont ask then how you going to get it ..... mate just tell her your sex life sucks .. and you want to play .it up a bit .. talk to her ..|`|AA11138696	Some things are best left unsaid.  If you have fantasies that you even think might be a hint threatening to your partner you are way better off not ever bringing those things to light.  Go ahead, don't listen and ask her about a threesome.  Then try to convince her that you don't really want to have one you just fantaize about it.  She will not believe you and she will ask questions about what sort of woman you would want to join them.  She won't ask but will wonder why she is not enough for you.  She will forever after take any passing glance at any other woman as you scouting for that third.  Do what you want but you have been warned|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	well my hubby and i are apart right now due to his work, so the other day on teh phone we had phone sex. I told him i wanted him to sit in the corner and watch me play wit ha friend! LOl i even described her and gave her name and everything he really enjoyed it. at the end of the conversation he asked where i came up with the idea and i told him it was my fantasy to be wit ha woman why he watch in the corner.He had no complaints !|`|e1oky4jSaa	I have told my husband some of my fantasy's which revolved around him being with another man * ok so I guess I am weird; but he isn't bothered by it. If I told him I thought his friend was hot I think he would have a bigger issue and would feel threatened though.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I did share, it was openly received but then my husband somehow thought he should seek out making a way for it to become reality...I did not like that so I don't talk about my fantasies anymore.|`|jBigEy0Caa	Nothing wrong with sharing, but some things are better kept to yourself.|`|4eLLjTzzaa	I think this is a pretty sticky wicket.  We can't make our partners be comfortable with this subject but we want to talk to them--to share that part of our psyche with them.  My suggestion would be to ask her:<br>  <br>  1.  Would she feel threatened or pressured (or is that your assumption)?<br>  2.  Can she overcome those feelings? What might make her feel more secure about knowing these things about you?<br>  3.  Would she feel threatened knowing you have fantasies you can't share with her?<br>  <br>  Maybe she could "ease" into it by hearing something very non-threatening (i.e. something that doesn't include anyone outside yourselves).  By beginning with something very "small" you have a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate you have no expectations about her fulfilling the fantasy, you just want to talk about it.<br>  <br>  My husband and I sometimes talk about this stuff in the "after-glow".  I'm much more advertsome than he is, but he knows I would never ask him to do something he's not comfortable with, though he sometimes shakes his head at some of the stuff I think up, lol.<br>  <br>  Having said that, there are some things I mentioned once, got a very uncomfortable response to, and have never brought up again.  I'd like to talk about them--fantasize with him about them--but they're just too far out there for him so I let them go.  I make the most of what I can have and write the rest off.<br>  <br>  I've told my hubby ALL my fantasies; but if I felt I couldn't tell him something, I have a very close female friend I can talk to about this stuff and I'd bring it to her.  A friendly 6-pack and some raunchy gossip make a great girls' night out.  I don't know if guys do this, but I don't know why they couldn't.|`|H7hHCHRkaa	I thought I might make you chuckle with a fantasy story me and hubby discussed. One day quite innocently I asked him how often he has fantasised about a threesome and not whether or not he has.....see being the clever wife hehe, he said well it has popped up once or twice, I very sweetly told him I would never have an objection to this. He looked at me quite suprised as he thought I am sure that I would of had a problem with another women in the bedroom, but my reply to him was honey if you can find the other man I will make the time. hehehe hope you liked it. He has never spoken about a threesome since then, (I wonder why) LOL|`|OTkmi06Faa	Well I don't have any fantasies that I wouldn't want to see come true.  I was uncomfortable talking about them with my husband for a long time.  One day I just told him what I wanted and we are working out how to accomplish our mutual fantasy's.  It is a two way street I want to fulfill his as well as my own.  Anyone who has a fantasy(about everybody) should tell there partner how else do you expect to get what you want if you never ask for it. lol|`|xGshAiXOaa	I think that fantasies along the lines of dress up and/or role play can be nice ways to spice up a special evening or keep a little variety in the mix.  However, I have never considered and would be very hurt if my husband voiced an interest in sharing our intimacy.  I know that there are plenty of people that live that lifestyle and I don't judge based on that.  I guess I am just selfish in the fact that I don't want to share my husband with anyone, ever.  And the fact that he could be wanting to share me would be unsettling.|`|vfQDSrAMaa	I think it depends on what kind of person youre wife is. I think it also depends on how strong your relationship is too. If my husband was to tell me something like that 3 years ago (at our strong point) I would have perhaps shared a fantasy too, and it would be a great conversation, and who knows! But now, (not so strong) I would assume he was bored with our relationship and is hinting that he wants more, and could perhaps persue it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|AA12347224	Don't forget that this could blow up in your face too. A fantasy to you could be interpreted by her as shes not doing a good enough job to satisfy you. Or, depending on the fantasy, you could scare her or make her uncomfortable. Go gently into the conversation. That way, if shes not receptive to simple stuff, then you know your saran wrap and peanut butter idea won't fly. Hahaha|`|pxygDg7Aaa	The first thing I did was I took the dress off and sent the dog out of the room.  I didin't wanrt to freak her out of course.  I told her brother to wait in the hallway and when the time was right; he should jump out in a clown suit.  Wow. . . . . .I am getting turned on just thinking about it.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	my husband and I always talk it out.  you just never know, maybe your spouse feel the same way too but just to hard to tell you.  It is easier for the man to say it and let their spouse knows.  The least you could do is that you're honest and that your spouse will not think you're cheating.|`|AA12160073	Every one has fantasies; even YOUR SPOUSE!  Keep it to yourself or start a little playful conversation about fantasies.  The thing about those fairy tales is that when and if they do happen, they are not nearly as exciting as you think they might be.  Godloveya.|`|t0rOQ5FWaa	I can't discuss sexual fantasies with my wonderful loving wife she is kind of prudish but i still love her just as much anyway.|`|pGjD5TTxaa	well this is your spouse so they are suppose to be able to satisfy u in all ways possible with a few exceptions of course..so you need to tell her...if your too shy to say it theres nothing wrong with a romantic letter or email|`|eWMn7dhKaa	Are you allowed to have Ovaltine on your carb diet?!?|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	That's really funny, because my husband and I were just discussing this topic. We email each other are thoughts and feelings as we are both on the shy side with saying things like that out loud.<br>  He told me he had always wanted to try a threesome, and we talked about it. We both agree that it's much better to think about, than actually do it.<br>  We recently have become more open with what we want. And either of us expect anything other than how we feel about it. And once in awhile we stumble on something we both really want to do, and we do it.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	i can barely handle my wife, let alone another woman joining in. <br>  <br>  i fantasize things about.. getting old together,  how i can be a better husband tomorrow, than i was today.. how i can love my precious and beautiful wife in ways that she feels fulfilled..  and yes, i read up on Men's health magazine to keep myself fit, eat right, and learn to make my wife scream harder in bed... and becoming better father to our kids.. <br>  <br>  and if i have time left over for 3 some fantasies,  i'll make sure i'll tell her.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	In a form of a conversation. It's never out of the blue - there's always a train of conversation leading up to revelations like these. I guess we feel safe talking to one another, and it doesn't get threatening if we discuss such subjects when the time seems right.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	I love the rich, chocolatey taste of Ovaltine in the morning.<br>  <br>  Don't tell my husband.<br>  <br>  Who is the loser here who thinks I am on a carb diet????   LMFAO!!!
968KfJjqaa	I think you should just be yourself, you don't need to be flirting with him if  you don't like it. <br>  <br>  Be yourself, act normal, then I'm sure he will like you :)|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Seriously?

Okay, just walk next to him or (Ii wouldn't say stalk) anything like that, but just always be with him. Not too much, just be there if anything goes. Don't stand there too long if a teacher or one of his friends are there or walking up to him. Most probably, they want to talk alone, as in boy bonding and stuff, unless he wants you there. Keep your head cleared and open. Never show any weaknesses. Try to be yourself, but, bend a little of your personality to his likings, just a little. Never show any weaknesses or uncomfortableness. Just keep it cool. Don't start a conversation that's like 3 seconds long or it'll make you seem wierd or a stalker. Make it a 1 min. to 5 minutes talk, unless he wants it to be more. Listen to his speech and body movements. If his body and speech seems to be more of a drag and only say stuff like, "Yeah," or, "haha... that's  funny..." or "uh-ha" or something, try to end the conversation or try to better the atmosphere. Make jokes and stuff and act the way he likes girls: Tomboyish, smart, quiet, loud, sarcastic, girly, etc. When you two are finally starting to get a "natural" atmosphere around eachother, you've reached the yellow zone. When he starts calling you to eat at his table, or invite you to parties, or be his partner in science, math, or those other subjects, and he starts to walk/run up to you or WANT to walk next to you, you've reached a very high yellow level. Try to dig up some information. WIthout acting suspicious, see if he has a girlfriend or not. If he does, then I can't help you on that. If he doesn't try to joke around while giving out hints like, "What? You're so hot and yet you still don't have a girlfriend!" or "Well, if we weren't friends, I would ask you to be my boyfriend," or "Oh really, I doubt that Mr. Hotshot!" Or something like that. If he seems disapointed if you were joking in becoming his girlfriend, that means that... DING! You've won his heart!! After class or something or at lunch, or after school (I would recommend someplace afterschool at a place you guys both like, like a pizzashop or a movie, or something to make it seem like a frienddate) DO NOT START SAYING "How do you feel about me?" OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT! IT'LL MESS UP THE FRIENDSHIP!! Just say it without any regrets, "I like you. Would you go out me sometime?" And smile.
1isDbRZFaa	Umm yeah...What kind of monster would leave there child in a burning building.|`|HtyaefiXaa	Yes....of course.....|`|YjVGo3jeaa	yes.
aDhZIhQcaa	Love her unconditionally, accept her the way she is, talk with her not at her, LISTEN to her even when she is just venting, make her feel sexy even when she doesn't feel sexy, do things with her and go places with her, continually court her no matter how long you are together,  validate her, hold her when she cries, reassure her when she doubts herself, make her feel secure in the relationship, make her feel like she has value in your life,  Put her first above everyone else including parents, children and friends, and always defend her no matter what...because no one should talk about your woman even if what they are saying is true.....make it clear that no one talks about her that way.  Pray for her and let her know that you do pray for her and your relationship, respect her and yourself.  Make sure she respects you.  God Bless You and good luck|`|wpi36XBAaa	How to meet a woman's emotional needs? Learn her love language and do what SHE needs to feel the love. Some need the loving words said often, some need loving gestures, others may need gifts, may need you to make sacrifices for them, for some its physical affection/sex/passion, some need you to spend "quality" time with them. A lot have more than one of these needs to be met to feel the love. If you learn what makes her feel loved and do that/those, you will be meeting her emotional needs.<br>  Remember what makes you feel the love may not be what makes her feel it.|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	Really listen to what she is telling you. I mean really listen. Don't judge, don't try to fix her life, don't tell her what to do, just listen to her. Tell her you understand what she is telling you and really mean it. Dtits 13.....I don't know what kind of women you get involved with but apparently they are the wrong kind and you know nothing about women.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	dude,you're asking something almost impossible to answer....evry woman has a different set of needs...try meeting one that has something in common and be good listener...or have a strong self esteem to move on when you cant.....|`|bqkfu6Diaa	That's impossible. You can temporarily meet a woman's needs, but it will only last for so long.|`|AA10986891	A women's G spot is in her ears. To get there all you have to do is listen to her.|`|BMEMH7JLaa	Great question few answers I'm surprised by the lack of answers.|`|IvMPh09baa	think about her box :)|`|5bqKLMg0aa	You have to be really sympathetic and stern at the same time. You have to understand there is no way to exactly meet a woman's emotional needs when she cannot meet them herself. (Yes, I am a woman). Personally, if their crying hold them until they feel better.<br>  In a fight, hug them until they can't hit you anymore. And in general, try to put yourself in their situation.<br>  What really would help you out, is complimenting them when it seems they haven't been appresiated. I see that all the time in relationships and marriages.|`|t9xQYdZ8aa	That is what we have girlfriends for!  Lol<br>  <br>  It is hard for a man to meet a woman's emotional needs because of the differences in how we think and see and feel about the world around us versus how men do those things.  Men are action-oriented and we are not.<br>  <br>  I can answer for myself:  I need to feel appreciated, loved and cherished.  I also have to get a good cry once in a while, if I don't I find that I get really crabby.<br>  <br>  Now the question becomes for a man: How the hell can I give her those things without seeming patronizing or a jerk?<br>  <br>  Again, for me, a simple touch or a rub of my shoulder or something lets me know he cares and its not always a sexual touch.  I need to be encouraged to hang with my girlfriends, watch chick flicks to get that good cry.<br>  <br>  One thing important to know..communicate.  If you don't want to hear about Sally & John and everyone's drama, be up front at the beginning of the relationship that drama is not what you want, she can gossip with her friends, not you.   <br>  <br>  You also need to let her know how to meet your needs as well.  What makes most good relationships go bad is two things, a lack of communication  and unrealistic expectations.|`|pxygDg7Aaa	Secret Asian Man,<br>  Keep in mind that whatever advice you read right now from any woman who answers here, it will be different the next time you ask them.  This is not a dig on women, it is a fact that women change their minds as the wind blows.  Good luck with your moving target.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	You can't.  Give up now; do not try.  Get a beer habit or something.  <br>  <br>  Her "need" is to feel in control.  So, when you think you've satisfied her needs... she changes her needs.  This gives her a feeling of control.|`|zfhTOfs5aa	Practice licking your eyebrows put down the remote and listen when we talk|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Well, I can't speak for all women, but I like to be cuddled.  I love it when my husband just lays in bed or on the couch with me to watch a movie or a show, or is just physically affectionate with me, without it having to be sexual.|`|kbz5S3waaa	you always need to tell her you love her (if you love her), you need to show it too.|`|zdu3gh8jaa	Make her feel like she's the only woman in the world, no matter what time of day or night it is. Hold her when she's sad, cuddle her for no other reason than you want to cuddle her, laugh with her, protect her, when she asks you to do something - don't question the reasons why, she knows why even if she can't make it make sense to you, listen properly when she talks to you - if you don't understand ask her to explain, show interest in all that she does. Remember to appreciate her without her having to remind you about how much she invests into the relationship. Do all this and there should be nothing at all left for her to complain or get upset with you about unless you flirt with her friends, sister etc - if you do that then you would deserve every ounce of grief she can throw at you. Treat her like a queen and she will treat you as her king in return. Hope this helps.|`|IqtzkgyBaa	Honorable Elijah Muhammad through Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan teasch us -<br>  <br>  There cannot be a new world except that there is a new and better understanding of the female, which will give us (men) a clearer understanding of self and above all, a clearer understanding of (God). In the Bible, (God) declares, “Behold I make all things new. What is the nature of the woman and what is the nature of the man?<br>  <br>   The Holy Qur’an  and Bible says, “Men are the maintainers of women.” It is the natural role of a man to work hard and produce what is necessary to maintain a woman and the children that are produced from that woman. As a maintainer, he is a protector, provider, and he is supposed to guide. <br>  <br>  You cannot guide a woman just with sex, and if a man is dumb enough to think that sex can guide a female, then the marriage falls apart and the relationship tumbles down. Guidance comes from the brain, not from any other part of the body. Guidance must manifest wisdom and since Woman is the Second Self of God, then the man must bring to you wisdom and truth that is from God, because the only thing that can maintain the woman of God is the word of God, rightly brought from a man who is in the image and the likeness of God.<br>  <br>  Since, the womb of our mother is sacred, then, this teaches us that the womb of every female is also sacred, for it is from her womb that all the Scientists, Prophets, Sages, Messengers, Kings, Rulers and Gods have come and will come.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Be there when she needs you. Listen to her when she talks to you, and they do talk a lot. Even if it is the last minute of an exciting ball game when the score is tied. Don't show boredom or irritation on your face. Get excited about issues that excite her. If she says yes, you say Hell Yes. If she says no, then you add Hell NO. When she cries, mostly for no reason, be sympathetic. Be very sympathetic. Don't laugh. Simple. Done. You have met her emotional needs. Get ready to get laid.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Listening to her goes a long way... Or at least doing a very good job at pretending that you're listening.

chENztVEaa	Sounds to me like you need to keep it on friendly co-worker terms at this point.  If he is making an effort to make sure you don't get the wrong idea than he must not have feelings for you like you do him.  Clear your head of him and go on with your life.  It sounds like that is what he is trying to do and still keep his job so he is trying to balance being friendly and being too friendly making you get the wrong impression.|`|BlVudiyfaa	add more detail so I can understand|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	That's why you should never get emotionally involved with people you work with!
nMYxyrzraa	There seems to be a lot of compounded issues. You are disillusioned, but this is just a part of growing up. It’s a part of discovery, the realities of the world and responsibilities. You cannot switch off from your parents or family, for they will also be a base for you and love you unconditionally. I feel it’s a part of your custom and cultural to be obligatory in this regards. Perhaps time away will be good to refresh your thoughts and give you time to recollect you ideas.  Plan a holiday or a trip even a few days will be good and refreshing.<br>  However I am well aware that main reason is probably the current political situation within your country, hence reference to politicians. I have seen a previous question of yours also in this regard and I do follow current affairs. There’s little doubt the aftermath after yesterday tragedy was shocking for that nation as a whole not just the sporting world. It was a shameful and disgraceful act and will have repercussions on the sport and the country for a long while. But now only time can heal that process, what has happened cannot be changed. It was unfortunate and tragedy.<br>  Time is good healer for all situations. You might also consider taking up some new activities or hobbies which you enjoy that might be benefit to you, something that will help release the tension and pressure. Get active! Listen to music and get motivated. Life itself has ups and downs. Sometimes we do not where the course takes us.   Everyone has issues and problems some worse than others. We all need to cope and keep moving forward.<br>  Religion is a good solace. If you need peace and harmony, sometimes reading wisdom and scriptures from the bible or Quran, or any other holy book as they have such good values. Do not always see the negative side of things, especially in uncertain moments. Keep an open mind, knowledge is a part of the fun in learning.  Quality of individual is measured when they can raise above adverse circumstances. We have the ability to change and make decision that will develop and shape our futures.<br>  I will leave you with an expression from a wise man, which you may know, “Unity, faith and discipline”.|`|AA12135516	Think positive! We all have our hard times where we can't see an end to it but don't give up because something good always comes out of it if you want it to. Life is a learning lesson & the hard times only make you stronger (i am living proof of it!) Try & find something you enjoy & fully focus on it, which in turn helps to take your mind off your problems. When i'm stressed i go for long walks by a river with my ipod 'cranked" up & it really does help change my mood, but i had to force myself to think this way & if i can do it anyone can. Good Luck!|`|DtUy1IFmaa	You need to figure out why your so angry.  I get sick of everything to but I'm not going to kill myself over it.  Go into the wilderness?  How is that going to resolve anything?  You think life sucks now.. how do you think its going to be when your alone in the woods with no electricity, or internet or fresh water and warm food while you take a dump behind some tree with no toilet paper?  You may be sick of your parents and relatives and friends and all that other crap but remember that sh*t can always be 1000x worse.  Go see a therapist if you can't figure out why your so angry with yourself.|`|BbcBTIrUaa	Sounds like you are stuck in a sick state of mind.<br>  You could kill yourself but realize you will never be able to do<br>  anything anymore. Or you can change your state of mind to<br>  something that will make you want to keep living, in the end it is<br>  all up to you, it is, after all, your life.|`|tJel8yiFaa	Find a cause to donate your time / effort to.<br>  <br>  <br>  Got to be a better idea than either of your proposals.|`|On5Mj7mAaa	...dont kill yourself, to many people love u...
AA0MuMt3aa	You can block his number from your phone, so he can't call you or text you. He's just being an idiot and messing with you, so just ignore him and don't give him any attention, and keep your phone with you at all times discreetly, then ignore any calls or texts from him, and delete them. Eventually he'll stop.<br>  However, the easier way is to just block his number if he carries on. Usually, if you go to his number on your phone, select options, then block number. That's how it can work for most phones, or research it.<br>  Just remember, ignore him continuously, it does work. And delete all traces of him if you don't want your parents to know.|`|Dwhyo9yPaa	this is gonna sound so harsh, but its reality...<br>  ignore him... really... <br>  there's nothing YOU can do to make him forget you... only he can do it for himself... <br>  <br>  the other option is much harsher... get a restraining order against him... because it seems like he's harassing you. and sounds to me like he's trying to get in bed with you... thats all... but... i guess boys will be boys... <br>  <br>  choice is yours. good luck!<br>  <br>  p/s: yes, guys are really distracting... and annoying at that age... how do i know? cause i'm a guy!!|`|lbB4lq6Daa	omg yes, i wanna know too =]<br>  <br>  edit my answer later|`|K2dv9u7baa	Tell him that school is your priority right now and he will find someone better than you; I'm sure he'll get over it after a while.<br>  Good luck :)
NkAFBgxRaa	It's one of two things. Either your sister really likes Patrick and is sort of attracted to him. Even though she knows that it's just a crush it makes her feel awkward to see a guy that she finds attractive being affectionate to someone else. OR it could be that she still feels strange that you have such a close relationship with a man. It's like how you felt when you see your parents kiss. It's just strange and you feel uncomfortable, except this is worse for her because you're her sister, and she's known you before him, so she isn't used to picturing you with someone like that. Also, sometimes it's just awkward to witness two people kiss- you just don't know what to do or say after the fact. If you think you need to then I'd talk to her, otherwise just try and make it less awkward for her, because I'm sure she feels it worse than you do!|`|KjzR1k1Kaa	There is a possibility that since she is 15 years old, she isnt mature enough yet to be around two ppl that love each other (Everyone matures at a different pace).  <br>   Maybe she is jealous that you have such an awesome fiance and she doesnt. Is she boyfriendless? (is that a word? ) Maybe she wants to discreetly pick up some tips from how you are around him so she can learn how to be around guys!<br>  Maybe she has a crush on him...But i doubt it, use that as your last resort; ask her if she does (if things dont improve soon). <br>  Also, "break the ice" by asking questions about Nicole to Patrick, for example, something like, "Oh Pat, did u know that Nicole takes skating lessons? Wow, i would probably fall!" And then laugh a little. This way, you'd be lightening up any tense atmosphere in the room.<br>  Good Luck! :)|`|we0mTKUWaa	you and sister can Girls<br>    Lesbians|`|HtyaefiXaa	She has a crush on your fiance, so of course she'd feel uncomfortable. Stop being like that, you are only making it worst. Confront her about it. Put yourself in her shoe and see how you feel when someone caress the one you love??? Please go and confront her about it, and maybe find her a boy friend.
u7LSohRyaa	Not really. I know some very happy bachelors and widows who wouldn't want it any other way.

If people are annoying you that much they are not worth your time. Make a new friend or two when you get the time.

yiFuMlwzaa	you could do a black white party but then everyone would be waering the same colors and prolly the same dress or something.. you could do masquarade just for fun.. you could do like beachy theme just to party.. or maybe something like 60s 70s like some old time period..
9qmWUg6xaa	Go back and ask once, that shows you're interested.  Any more just looks like a crazy stalker.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	I think she was trying to make a sale. If she was really interested she would have called or made the time to exhange info properly.|`|gqvvXknQaa	If she gave you all those signs, then yes, she was probably interested in you.

Not to shoot ya down but she could have just been trying to make a sale... then again maybe not. I wouldn't go in so soon. wait about another week then go in...but have a different reason...like to buy shoelaces or something...u dont wanna appear desperate...just a coincidental meeting. Then u can flirt all u want and try again to get the date.|`|tbFvGrvNaa	she ask for your business card and not just you phone number.   she sounds like she wanted to know what you do for a living and not who you are.  sounds like a gold digger.|`|jQUIg20Oaa	your feelings for her should lead you to her,am suer she likes you because she is lady you go for her|`|G8vZoM8iaa	I am sorry but that is how those sales ppl do their business...whenever<br>  I go shopping ppl always do that to me...they are jus trying to b friendly....
j5xd5s11aa	well if he had a girlfriend at the time he found out ofcourse he would reject you. people change their minds and your should be open for it. maybe u should confront him about the flirting or maybe he just trys to get your attention when u see each other but he wants to avoid talkin to your cuz hes scared hes going to mess up or look like a dork.<br>  <br>  he may have changed his mind and realized he found a really nice and pretty girl to be more than friends with...<br>  <br>  give him a chance!|`|hvIMKEH0aa	I'm sorry ):<br>  But, that means he doesn't like you and he's not interested in you.<br>  And he's the kind of guy to flirt with you without even knowing, he's<br>  just that kind. <br>  You only like him more because he rejected you, it happens to<br>  everybody.<br>  Find somebody new, or just realize that there's better people in the world than him.|`|rXMLELjnaa	because guys are idiots! just go up to him, def when hes talking to another girl and interrupt and be like, hey if you don't bring my scarf to school so i can get it back im just gonna come by your house and get it and just walk away, bc then he'll be like, "shes a feisty girl, maybe I want to be with her" lol then you get your scarf and your man! <br>  good luck!|`|KIH0DyRyaa	he's obviously immature, and is using the fact that u use to like him to his advantage.

Either hes playing hard to get or hes just being a real jack ***. Walk up to him, tell him "Ok dude I'm not interested in you, so knock it off.

RcAofGkIaa	You say this person is your friend, but it doesn't sound like you two have a very similar world view.  It is great if you can be friends with someone who is different from you...you both learn from each other.  Her views (no doubt brain washed into her at home) sound pretty extreme.  It is not your job to form her world view, but it might be a side-result of your friendship that you temper it.  If you live an upright life in accordance with your principles, she may see that her views are not correct.  But don't make it your job to instruct her, she's had enough of that in her life.|`|qpmGLd7laa	Ummmm...  When people grow up that sheltered, they often go completely insane when they leave home and ... get horny.  So, I think you should let her think what she wants, for one because you can't change that, and also because she's either going to go crazy one day anyway, or she's going to live her entire life afraid of getting horny.|`|PTshTOSUaa	shes not guna change, maybe when she gets a boyfriend, but wow, she has issues dont even bother fighting with her say ok whatever and just walk away|`|8Y9timR4aa	leave her you isnt going to change her mind if you do try anyways lol werid Friend|`|TfOfVRYnaa	yeah. Just leave her alone. lol what a prude|`|EdidZdtlaa	you cant really change a person from something they believe in. if you've told her before that its not true and she didnt listen to you then theres not really anything you can do about that. just leave her like that if she dosent wanna listen to you. you just have to hope that she gets out of that kinda phase that shes in. just respect what she thinks and keep being her friend you kno?! good luck|`|NXujuDxnaa	Well, that's just your friends way, and it sounds like it's been hardwired into her. Over the years she might change her views and assumptions of the world, but that's not something you can alter or force. Just respect her opinion, leave her with it, don't let it bring you down.<br>  <br>  Most people this generation totally do the boobs thing on purpose by the way. ;)|`|lW28oUSpaa	My suggestion is to respect your friend's beliefs.  They aren't hurting you.  I agree wth her about guys going shirtless having no manners.|`|9OHeder5aa	Sometimes I don't even wear pants in public. It's human nature to be perverted.|`|VXEJVBdFaa	I'm sorry but I have to speak my mind here - she's a freak. WTF? I could go on quite a bit, but to make it brief, I think you should really talk to her and tell her to snap out of it. OR go to the source and straighten out her dad. <br>  I mean, what? Does she think humans were f***ing born with clothes on or something? If she thinks looking at someone's body is perverted, how is she going to cope when it comes to relationships? she should grow up. One of my sister's friends is 19 years old and her parents don't allow her to watch 18 rated films + a whole lot more weird stuff.<br>  I'm probably being a bit harsh here but you're right - it's not even about living in the right generation, she's just a very odd fellow.
I7zocOEnaa	Talk to them separately ask them why they feel that way "the best people are those who listen" so listen also maybe put in your own words on how you feel about your friends <br>  <br>  say it something along these lines-If you want-:<br>  <br>  "Listen (Friend's name) I'm sorry if i sound rude but I would like you to stop talking about (So&So another friends name) that way if she where here how do you think she would feel)|`|1egCvgSLaa	maybe these girls r just trying you to choose a side i mean, they just want you to be friend of one of them and non both of them<br>  I agree with your boyfriend but u should talk with Lisa and let her know u don't like the things she says about Kary.<br>  And then talk with Kary about Lisa<br>  If they're really your freinds, they'll understand your ponit of view and respect your friendship with both of them
BKr3y30maa	Well let me say this first, i'm happy that you learned your lesson.  He seems like he is a good guy though....he obviously didn't run to his friends and tell him what happened.  I know you said you can't remember, so I would just ask him "hey i'm a little embarassed but what exactly happened last night, I normally don't drink like that".  Or you can just drop the subject entirely.  What you really need to ask yourself is, can you?  Can you just push it aside or is it going to eat at you until you know what really went on?  Personally, I would ask him.  Oh and if you like him, tell him!  Maybe he likes you too and is too shy to admit it.  BTW, I love how you give each other nicknames, definetly shows you both probably like each other.  Good luck and feel free to email me if you want.|`|izbAdDUraa	Nah dont ask. We have all been there and done that. Sh** happens! You learned a lesson and dont do it again!<br>  he knew you were drunk as heck that night so anything you did or said that was dumb was just looked over. :]|`|DxohE884aa	Maybe he meant your secret about throwing up.|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	I think she has told you after 70 days  she doesn't want  her Italian clothes covered  with  orange puke . IDK  but you  need  to go to  say a prayer maybe,check the virgil strenght after all that drinking.|`|AA11015829	wow<br>  just tell him that you don't remember and ask him<br>  hopefully HE remembers|`|HctybHFvaa	lol i cant beleive i read the whole thing :P|`|hUt8Vt7oaa	Ask him what happened. Proceed from there.|`|5nAnWp3daa	ask him|`|mCQx7Co5aa	just ask him and tell us what you did|`|kfM7ppWpaa	Didn't get many answers with the last one huh?<br>  <br>  Its ok...thats why your my contact, so I can help you out! lol|`|65ojSBXgaa	Dont worry your pretty little head. The guy is a sweetheart for not embarrassing you. If I were you I would just apologies for embarrassing your self and laugh about it. Don’t put any more thought whats done is done. Believe me I made a jackass out of my self and all I do is laugh about it and not speak about it again. It won’t be the first time believe me there’s more to come. So don’t worry be cool soon nobody will remember and if they do laugh about it you were drunk.<br>  <br>  Take care,<br>  Gail Friend|`|6oSm5Qxzaa	I say you just flat out tell him that you don't remember anything from the night and you aren't sure what you said or did. Don't make it into a big deal, but tell him that you are sorry if you did anything offensive. It could definitely be a joke between you two, but it would be better than you pretending like you remember and never really knowing what he is talking about. So just ask him flat out what happened, and laugh about it.|`|PYIA2FCFaa	lol you sound young so i dont think this will be your last time getting wasted :) i have said that one too many times before myself! lol<br>  <br>  I would just come out and ask him. There is no harm in wanting to know if you made a fool of yourself.  ;o)|`|fc964df50bc3ae84b97937ecb982821baa	How about instead of asking some awkward question, just say you are sorry if you did or said anything embarrassing but that you really appreciate how he took care of you and that you want to repay the favor and lay one on him!!|`|N2JGcgfZaa	dont do that cause things happen that should not happen to u an it will hurt u 4 a long time|`|pjrRbgnIaa	well i'm guessing you guys are close friends- so just be honest and ask him. i'm sure he'l be ok with it and tell you. xx|`|MocCfpILaa	if it were me...i would be pretty up front about it...sorta. I would probably say something like: "Hey remember ur b-day party that one time when we got totally trashed? Well i had this weird dream about it, and now i cant remember if it actually happened or if it was all the dream...so i dreamed that we made out a little...did we? or was it all my imagination...cuz 2 b honest i hope it wasnt...but if it was thats cool to" U may want to throw something in there about not wanting to damage friendship...hope i can help
cen8SIssaa	I was going to say the exact same thing as William...<br>  <br>  but since he said it already....i think another good idea would be to maybe bake her cake and write with the icing on top and say "thanks for...."<br>  <br>  ~i would love that!!|`|zUdxoRbyaa	buy her a nice gift and send it U.P.S.|`|W4BsmESnaa	Williams answer is clever!!! But you said she doesnt drive so why don't you offer to drive her around while she runs an errand or two. Or take her to a restaurant so you can thank her personally over a nice lunch.
AA10874773	yes, the preggy girl needs to know not to sleep with him - that he may be transmitting diseases.  for sure tell her if he's not willing to go find out for sure.  people never cease to amaze me.|`|1isDbRZFaa	What a DOG..Scum<br>  <br>  Yeah tell all of them and evryone  from here on out.|`|HtyaefiXaa	Woooah, your brother in law? You should really...tell your sister.....and get a divorce with him......
PMrTleDJaa	Its your choice either way.  I would tell her to stop being with him.  Because obviously he has had his share of girls and your sister would fall next in line..|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Wow, he sounds like a real piece of work, lol. It is indeed her problem but if it would make you feel better than tell her.  I hope I am wrong but I get the feeling she probably doesn't care anyway.|`|awWhY4jiaa	She might be a "hussy", but you should tell her that he wont get checked for STD's, she is pregnant after all..
277efdce8c0ee4a061432d1c6596e76daa	What exactly about porn don't you like? The fact that you think he has to look at young hot porn stars to get turned on? That's not the case. Of course hot, big tittied naked porn stars are going to turn him on, that's instinctive, but you're going to get the benefit of that stimulation, imagination and even techniques. Its impossible to stop men from being aroused by graphic nudity, and its a waste of your time and energy to get jealous because of it. <br>  <br>  Rather than being bitter, you could use this as an opportunity to spice up your love making. Be the porn star, make your own movies, tell him how horny you are thinking of him at random times during the day. Trust me, if you want to get his mind off porn and back on you, then being angry and giving him ultimatums will only push him to porn more. Use your own sexual charms to lure him to you, he'll forget about the porn and you'll be amazed at the results!|`|lxJaqQ95aa	i understand your frustration, but in my opinion.. its better than he sleeps with other gurl|`|IE3i4dhNaa	He's not sick of you...... he just likes to pleasure himself..... like the first answer said, take the porn away. e.g, block those sites and channels with parental control on the computer and tv, and maybe be MORE KINKY IN THE BED... may i suggest a threesome|`|VnCVkHDhaa	no its male instinct! you can take the porn from the man but you cannot take the man from the porn! do not worry!|`|IYg7TUd1aa	i'am so sorry to hear this..... iam a girl but sometimes guys want something crazy u know something different try it out it might work <br>  + his just a horny matha **** right ?? iam guessing|`|451ded38071eb1d1c5ce11c28a9e627daa	This is a stupid male answer but would you let him use his hand or would you like if he did someone else instead?|`|AA10227788	He's just being selfish - which isn't bad in and of itself. <br>  <br>  The only time it's bad is if it interfers with your sex life with him.  If he's perfering his hand, then there is a problem.|`|JT92LbRdaa	Because your boring in the bedroom? Maybe try something new.<br>  That always works with my wife and myself.
GSe6owcPaa	tell them that your down for DP.. u know double penatration|`|m9bRpmN4aa	Niether girl (:<br>  Too much drama.<br>  But....

They are best friends and it will just be drama.|`|tFbdkxyIaa	boy a sounds like a playa. i think he told you not to tell boy B because boy B had told boy A that he likes you and boy B would be really angry at boy A if he knew he had invited you somewhere. boy A sounds shady (girlfriendish, secret invitations (horrible!)). i don't see any problem with boy B who sounds more clear.  so text boy B or give him your number when you see him, even better.|`|y1JJhQ0Vaa	Well, you obviously can't have both... You'll just have to decide.<br>  I'm also in the Boy B fan club, but I'm not sure if you're asking us to choose. You could ask them both together if they would have a problem with you going with one of them.|`|ab56af4e329bedd35b68ba9892425376aa	It's all good.  Do both of them.|`|8KmGcTW8aa	Just stay pimpin' .... all day everyday!|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Boy A and boy B are playing with you.|`|9CMGO5fhaa	Careful boys are boys and they may be playin you like a fiddle honey!|`|9f8a58d970a66b4ecccc6e2320c54473aa	the first thing i want you to know is that you're heading for trouble!<br>  there are rules to dating and loving for all reason(s). well known.<br>  come to terms with what you want. and then go for it. you want boy<br>  a or boy b or both just remembe that'st's not the real world.|`|D2cCZVQXaa	Which one do you think would make you happier and satisfy you "needs". Boy A sounds like a party animal and Boy B sounds like a down to earth kind of guy. It depends what type of relationship you want. <br>  And as for confronting them, choose who you want first. Then don't hesitate to make the first move. If you guys are good enough friends but he doesn't want a relationship like that, then you should be safe no matter what. But if you confront him and he starts rejecting you, then it isn't worth it. And if one doesn't work out you can always try the other! It never hurts to experiment, because you never know what you might end up with!|`|IE3i4dhNaa	well.....Boy A seems like a bad type if he gets drunk and just stares at u through windows. Boy B, on the other hand, looks out for you and is sweet. If he hugs u and DOES look out for you.. he is obviously a better guy. I doubt they would try to confuse you. Boy B might be too nervous to ask you for your number again, but he is probably the best guy, plus he seems to like you more|`|L2tQ7t6Faa	Kiss them both and then pick...|`|jixdk8wraa	Dang... That sucks. <br>  Hehe, boys rock but suck so hardcore =P<br>  Just flirt.<br>  Go with the flow.<br>  Chill out and things will work themselves out =)|`|3bpwLPxjaa	Blow them BOTH off.  see who is sincere and checks up on you.

Be honest and let them know how you felt like you needed to make up dating this guy. If they are your true friends they will understand.|`|I7zocOEnaa	Don't feel left out *Hugs* Its ok you see having a bf could mess up your life and if there really your friends they will understand <br>  <br>  you could say:<br>  "I'm sorry I lied but I was feeling left out and now i feel really bad please forgive me"|`|9OHeder5aa	You should have told your friends lies when you first met them... I find it's best to lie to all your new friends and lose credibility in the beginning... then when you lie after that, they'll just think it's normal.
odc8LHbBaa	As a Japanese grim reaper, i believe i have an answer to ur question.<br>  <br>  if you ever dated 1 of my fugly stepsisters (did i ever mention I was Cinderella?) i shall make sure you regreted it all day everyday.<br>  <br>  1st i would hold the biggest grudge i would actually become the Grudge.<br>  <br>  then i would throw you in the ocean along with the whales, then hunt you as that's what Japanese ppl r best at doing.<br>  <br>  then i would make u live out ur life doing complex mathematical questions that would take u ur whole lifetime to finish. but since we Japanese r so blessed with extensive education, it would only take us 1 minute 2 answer.<br>  <br>  u better keep ur chopstick in ur pants now.|`|qB4KvbDiaa	that is so wrong|`|AA11015829	not really<br>  cuz technically your related..|`|ZaxpQSO5aa	Not okay, unless his or her mother/father and step parent got a divorce, then maybe a year or so later.. it would be okay.|`|wjS3GtOYaa	Heyyyy thats like Dan and Serena on Gossip Girl! ...well..almost lol - their parents are dating not married.<br>  anyway ya its weird..|`|AA11193401	sure|`|HctybHFvaa	ew sick, no|`|CSysSbnlaa	Oh my gosh, no!

lK3TXGBOaa	well its a pretty long story but i read it all....first of all i think this guy was trying to hide his true him and then he got tired and all of a sudden without him noticing you saw the true him... (99.9%) of guys are like this they try to be all nice in the beginning and then after a while they show "the real them", theyre all stupid and they dont care... i dont think you did anything wrong he was just a jerk so moove on and try to forget about him....yes it may be hard but i think that time heals.... i recently broke up with my ex  and i felt horrible,sad, lonely...but i decided that i wasnt gonna let him see me like this so i go out with my friends to place like out to eat, movies, play sports..etc. cheer up okay :) life is too short to waste it on losers like that good luck.|`|1fcb7562596b52ad171b00f259e7e947aa	wow that was looong edit it down next time|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	well, he was obviously attracted to the dancing and the other girl.<br>  <br>  while you sat and watched and acted silly and grumpy.  not very attractive thing to do on your part if you really liked the guy.  <br>  <br>  by your details, you really didnt like the guy that much so I think you should get over it.  my guess is that he also 'felt' that you didnt like him that much either.  <br>  <br>  the problem seems to be in your head alone.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	From what I'm reading, you WANTED your relationship to fail.  You consistently gave him the wrong number (perhaps it was subconscious?) then got mad when he didn't hang all over you in dance class.  Well, it's class!  If he hung all over you, you'd just be embarrassed and wish he'd leave you alone.<br>  <br>  Then he is dancing with other people because you're not having a good time and you keep saying you want to leave, and he still wants to have a good time.  Here's someone who likes dancing, so he gives her a card -- and you get mad.  Why?  It wasn't his phone number, it wasn't "Let's salsa in the bedroom", it was for a class.<br>  <br>  Then you tell him you're not friends, then you try to hug him and have him come upstairs.  You're giving mixed messages all over the place.  I'd probably dump you too.  The truth is, he CAN'T make you happy because you admitted to still being in love with your ex.  Until you get over your ex, you'll never find a fulfilling relationship.  So be single for a while, or go back to your ex.  But stop pursuing men that you'll never be happy with or you'll keep having questions like this.|`|cKy6yLDMaa	i really really really really really really really really really really really really  really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really cant be bothered to read ALLLLLL this!!!|`|hyY5t2JKaa	I like older women, I am 25 let me get at you!!|`|JbFToTMdaa	Maybe you talk to much ^^... just check how much you wrote :O|`|56238df610f5337752dc7843453a522daa	he's not so into you.. go find yourself first.. go find another hobby .. meet people.. go out with friends....|`|9a5yuzpNaa	He's just a jerk.

Doing this only date men who live within driving distance and those who will meet you face to face within two weeks.  More and more people are going this way.  When I lost all hope from an ex who was mentally abusive I never dreamed of the happiness I have now.  Smile and be happy, it makes things go better in your life.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	You don't write like 35 and what you say is void of the maturity and experiences that would be expected.  More than likely, your relationships and interactions reflect this as well. Don't worry about letting it go, it has gone on its' own.  How can you be honest in a relationship when you aren't even honest with yourself?|`|LLeQyWGcaa	maybe you might be a bit on the controlling side, and seem to be wish-washy. do you really know what you want in a relationship. if you do, do you let the guy know what you want . maybe you come on to desperate. most guys don't like desperate women to tend to be clingy.
N5mSDe1Naa	I would go over there and see if you could care for the baby for more than an hour, with your brother and sister-in-law there. If they see that the baby won't calm down for you maybe they'll realize they can't really go out of town for days. Just tell them the truth. You have three of your own and it's hectic.|`|sFXla2gIaa	well like you said, you're busy, the baby screams when not around her parents....meaning not you....so she'd scream and you'd get exhausted and annoyed and your hands are already full.<br>  <br>  i say you dicuss it with your husband and see what he wants and to do the same for you...do you really want to do this?<br>  <br>  sometimes you just have to say no to the people you love.|`|mflVhx0haa	First of all If you want to say no better say no now so she knows than too late so she can figure out what to do? another thing you can try to help her two days sounds very long because your very busy yourself with your own kids but you can do for her, she ask you because she trust you with her kids and I'm sure she does understand your situation but sometimes we have to help each other who knows one day in life may be you will need her help too. That's all for today|`|HE56Jra6aa	My god!!! A Family member asks for help and all you do is say OMG and have excuses after excuses.

0KLu4hRaaa	Could you guys agree on Pure Joint custody with no sole physical. I think I might understand his point here. You said the kids go to school from his house--so he does need a little more legal leeway with that aspect that he can't get if he does not have any of the physical custody. Instead of one or the other of you having it all why don't you petition the court to make it all joint. Then you are not losing and he is not losing. Obviously, you can co-parent well or the kids would not have the arrangement as they do now. So instead of thinking he is trying to steal your kids why don't you just ask him. If his reasons are legit he will have no problem with pure joint. You could even address your concerns about CS.|`|IWzV60R3aa	I believe that you are their mother and no matter you should fight for them. It may seem hard but they need to get use to and adjusted with you too.  You need to fight!!! Those children are more you then him. They may have been created by both but overall they came from you, your womb, you felt them groq and everything!!!! THINK OUT IT! Dont make a mistake. FIGHT FOR THEM!|`|OtKCAeQZaa	That would be the biggest mistake of your life. Remember that at any time you could change the agreement that you have made have the children come to your home at night some  time as well, but tell him no thanks to what he asked.  because he could then turn around and have you never see the children again. remember this.|`|5hxWSezPaa	Do not sign it over.

Don't point the finger, and call her names, go at this in a nice way. Sit down with just her and explain how you feel. If you do this face to face, nothing can be taken the wrong way, if you talk to her over the internet, you might end up adding fuel to this fire. Hopefully she will listen to what you have to say, and make sure that she tries to change her behavior. If you are honest with her, she might tell you about why she is doing this. It could be a family problem, or you could be contributing to it. If you are upfront and honest, but not pointing the finger at her, or calling her names, you will most likely get a positive outcome.|`|TzfupeX1aa	Well don't worry shes just yearning for attention. Also make plans with YOUR friends and go out just yall when she not around and if she tags along okay but just remember that they are your friends too. So just because she friends with her don't try to make it seem like they should choose sides. Once a friends always a friend try to make plans with them go out for a movie or burger so like that you will keep your bonds tight with you friends. Hope i helped okay good luck.|`|KJiXs4yraa	same with me! i just try to be nice, and invite all your bffs (including her) to a sleepover or something, that way she has to be nice

TsGOaJYNaa	Yes you are no longer a virgin. <br>  <br>  I don't know how old you are but if you are gonna have random sex always use protection.<br>  If you don't want herpes, stds, aids, a baby or baby mama drama, then it might be a good idea to have protection. and if you don't want bleeding, pain, sore *** etc then don't have so much random sex. NO seriously if you don't want have any of the problems don't have sex period.|`|AA10404026	you had sex, so no, you are not a virgin. not everyone bleeds the first time.|`|KIgEBTI6aa	you aren't a virgin even though he didn't pop your cherry|`|jTV6rLX3aa	Um.

I would have to say that if he went inside of you then you are not a virgin anymore, sorry to say.|`|kmGW34unaa	you had sex, you are not a virgin anymore, yuo dont always bleed, you could have busted your hymen along time ago playin sports, **** him again and let him go deep this time|`|tT04bRLraa	if his dick was in ur pussy ur not a virgin
3NoQuoWuaa	No. you are not wrong to feel the way you do. It's time for a sit down frank conversation with her and let her know she hurts you. She may not know she hurts you but that she is avoiding some bad vibes from her coworkers. You need to find out what you need to do to help with her situation. Hopefully, both of you can help each other.r|`|SzZxgHdtaa	It sounds as though she is ashamed of this relationship.<br>  If this is how she is making you feel you have got to ask her to stop.<br>  <br>  Spend some time apart too, you don't want to be together all the time. That can sometimes damage a relationship|`|JT92LbRdaa	Shes cheating on you, this is why 83% of lesbian relationships don't work out.|`|QQd1C9HGaa	i don't think so, i would just sit her down at home and talk about how she makes you feel when she does that. Listen and try to understand her feelings too.|`|mRwnlmtYaa	if she was embarrased about your age, I dont think she would have taken you there at all. My fiance gets upset that i dress up all week long, but when we go out on the weekends, I dont wear make-up and usually im in sweats. If its around people she works with, then I would try dressing better, and looking good when you go in there. Her response to it will let you know if that is the issue, or if its something else. <br>  I would get upset as well though. My feelings would be hurt, because now its not just being with the one you love, and comfortable, you have to worry what you look like when you go to the store. I would just try my suggestion and see what works for you two.<br>  <br>  Best of luck
9CMGO5fhaa	I am so shy and I hate drama, but I do know how to face it. if someone gets in your face stay calm ask don't tell but ask that they leave you alone. Ask them once they back off what their damned problem is anyways and see where it goes from there. If a fight starts it wasn't your fault cause you stayed calm oh and always make them swing first do not be the first to take a punch let them go first then you can say they started the whole thing and you were only defending yourself!|`|Dwhyo9yPaa	its stories like these that doesn't heal my mental wounds... until i got my shoulder tattooed 'justice' in chinese... to remind me that there are laws... and there will be consequences taking matters into your own hands. <br>  <br>  this guy back in school,who was in the same grade, blocked my way in the toilet entrance... and as i asked him politely to give way. instead he kicked me in the thigh and left me with a bruise. i grabbed his hair and smashed his face into the glass mirrors in the bathroom. 2 years later, as he held tightly to his grudges against me, he turned 8 of my friends (or should i say f***ed up friends) against me, and they started beating me up. in high school, he carried a knife around everywhere he went (so i heard), and i wasn't in the same school... <br>  <br>  i didn't have to do anything to get justice served... he got beaten up by teenagers a couple of years ago... an he was already 25 at that time... what a pussy... now he knows how i felt... maybe worse...|`|1Qha5gwVaa	Fighting back is in most cases a proof of weakness. Try to be calm and consistent in what you say, be aware of it and bare in mind that you as well as that person are equal in this world.|`|cB2VGhLgaa	Laugh in their face. If they want to start drama, they are asking for it. Don't get offended, get even. Make fun of them back, do the same thing they are doing to you, just make in 10x harsher.|`|MuQ72xobaa	It's kinda hard to do it if they're in a gang and you're on your own. 2 lads out of my old school used to shout at me and tease me and i never said anything, i'm shy and have no confidence. But one day i got totaly pissed off with them at my locker and i kicked one of them in the balls and just made a run at the other one who was cowering in the corner. I can still remember the looks on there faces. Maybe you might need to give them a fright, turn around and tell them to stay the f*ck away from you, or whatever you want to say and just walk off.
AA10065812	├┬┤═┬┬<br>  Perhaps he doesn't want to see his children's lives torn apart.|`|IvMPh09baa	reasoning was gone once divorce was decided, and the lack of reasoning is probably the main reason for your divorce... so why do you expect it now?|`|0gOWh0z2aa	Wow.

Most spouses don't want to talk about divorce.  Sounds as if you want to bend his ear to try to justify why you are divorcing him.  Forget that.|`|QCmRRbABaa	You don't need his permission or his opinion. If he doesn't want to discuss divorce, do it yourself.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	You just have to get tough here and tell him its his choice but you can get the divorce with or without him. that it would be so much easier and chaeaper and quicker if he only cooperates but its up to him. that should get thru to him. Chances are he doesnt want the divorce and is doing everything in his power to delay the inevitable, but he has to understand that nowadays a divorce is so easy to get whether both parties agree or not, so try to save as much money as possible here. No one ever said that men were the smartest animals on the planet and we keep showing it. Good luck|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	I'm not sure why you would want to try to reason with him. He's clearly got some issues that are deeper than just being mean. You cannot reason with someone who is not mentally stable.<br>  You do not need his permission to file for divorce. If he's abusive/hard with the kids, and the fact he's a pedophyle gives you reason enough to get out of the house and get the kids away from him and file a fault based divorce. Do not wait for him to agree, it will never happen.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	It is better to ignore then to deal with the situation. That is what he is doing and wants nothing to do with a divorce . Just take it to a layer and file for devoice, it does take one year before they can officially devoice anyone. Hand him his divorce papers then go from there nothing he can do to stop you then.|`|fc4NOCp3aa	Tell him either the 2 of you attend marriage counseling or the next thing he'll be getting from you are divorce papers.  That might get his attention!  Not communicating doesn't do anything to solve one's issues.  If he's completely unwilling to communicate about the problems in the r'ship, then there's no where else to go but divorce court!|`|WU6pTTvCaa	No need to discuss it with him . . . discuss it with your attorney.  Your attorney will have your husband served it divorce papers, at that point he will get the hint.|`|0ece3ea96233735c56393ae48382a64caa	Wouldn't exactly be my favorite topic either.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Go ahead and file.  Then he will have to discuss it with you.|`|D7JZPxDzaa	you can't im afraid...leave him and come over my house|`|crFl8m26aa	Honestly it is very hard to reason with someone is very irrational or not willing to be open to discussion. With people like this you are going to have to simply show them that you mean business. You are going to have to make every possible reasonable attempt at talking to him via alone or at last resort via with family or church. As a last resort just leave|`|36a102df643da35a7ec81416e5244893aa	Make sure you go over every other option, such as counseling before you make a decision like that.

xGshAiXOaa	And who would you suggest be the 'supervisor'?  His trashy parents that raised him the same way?  Maybe one of his trashy friends that acts the same as he does?  Unless the courts make the ruling, they are not going to supply a supervisor for these visits.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	You could reduce or refuse child support from him until that point...|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	hes a fool sorry but true .. just go to court and tell them .. and you will get your way .. goo luck to you and the kids .. but he will go to hell before i say something nice to him .. sorry .. but true ...|`|wNLmGzSwaa	Speak to your lawyer and you may end up with sole custody. He sounds like an unfit parent. <br>  Even if he is accompanied by another adult, is there any reason to assume they would be any better? God knows his parents aren't.|`|OBCvewW2aa	Child support is your bargaining chip.  Forego it and he'll be like putty in your hand.|`|ByUS0k8waa	No child support. You could tell him that he can come see the children when he wants and you wont file for child support. Also some courts will look at his home and vehicle. If his home or vehicle isn't fit for a child then they wont allow him to keep them over night and may require for you to be present when his visitation takes place. We got my ex on that. His home was unfit for a child to live there so my daughter never had to go there to see him and he could  never keep her longer than 2 hours at a time.|`|d665c8adfe92a87bcbce06e12996f077aa	He will never agree to that. He will most likely fight you for reasonable visitation. The things you are saying are all hearsay to the court without documented proof from a doctor or professional such as a couselor. My first husband was raised around bikers and drugs. He grew up as an adult like that. Still, he got joint custody because there was no signs of physical or sexual abuse documented from a professional or some sort. However he never abused the kids like that. Just his trashy ways he lived were not enough. There are many women out there that live in the bar every night and come home drunk while the children stay with a sitter. These women still manage to get full custody of kids and even get rewarded child support to help pay for their good times. You will most likely get custodial of the kids but don't be surprised if your ex husband gets visitation rights without supervision. In my parenting plan me and my ex are not allowed to criticize the way we raise the kids while they are in our care unless it is a life or death matter (very detrimental situation) concerning the kids.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Child custody/visits are never easy for all involved and definitely never easy to attempt what you want. Youre just going to have to persuade the Judge on supervised vsits due to the evidence you have and then pray for the best.Chances are you will get your wish based upon what youre saying so let the Judge tell him.  There really isnt anything legally that you could ever tell him to get him to agree with you. Sorry and good luck|`|PILm2U4Taa	He sounds like an idiot, so perhaps you could try saying "If you don't contest this Divorce, I'll allow you daily SUPERVISED visits."

The choice is his...|`|31b9789366ff5be076f00fbeadf4d573aa	you have to have a reason to insist upon supervised visitation.I don't think anything you have mentioned is inappropriate unless they are physically harmed from his actions or lack there of, I would make sure he clothed them and fed them properly. get an attorney|`|pxygDg7Aaa	Tickets to the next NASCAR race or maybe even a dinner for two so he can take his sister.  <br>  Are you crazy?  Don't let him see the children unsupervised.  Make sure the court says the same thing.|`|MYU46ap5aa	I think you should speak to an attorney.  If you go to court and he does get unsupervised visitation contact your local child services agency and continue to document everything.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	If you have all of this documented all you need to do is present it to the court/judge stating he's an unfit father and you request full custody with supervised visitation for him. The more proof you have, the better your case will be. If you can prove these things you say, there is no way CPS/the judge would leave the kids in his care w/o supervision.<br>  There is not anything you can to do prevent an uncontested divorce in this situation. He will not likely admit to anything, nor will he willingly give up his "rights" to unsupervised visitation.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	My ex husband was just like this and it get worse if you do not stand up to him who else will do this, think is this the sort of man you want any were near your kids,you can not pave over these crack you need to stand up and fight for these kids protection,amd i also be keeping  the grandparents at a distance too<br>  people told me the court would never grant me full custody and i have to accept supervised visit then contact i refused to accept this and i won my case,it took time and in and out of court but  he got no contact in the last ten years,so if i can do this so can you you owe it to the kids
GSe6owcPaa	more than just holding hands|`|cmEi3CVqaa	trust, love for each other, communication at least once a day, regular meetings up, it helps if you have interests in common, conversation in general, conversations that go a little deeper than general, the physical side of things is also good to have and does help keep the relationship alive but it's only a bonus in a relationship tbh, it's not essential that you do things! you also need to have borders and boundaries as you both need space at some point even if its not very often. you also need to know the person you are involved with but getting to know each other is part of the fun in a relationship as you can never know someone too well (: and really just be there for each other. have a laugh but know when to be serious. <br>  <br>  hope it helps (: x|`|AA11795191	Trust, feelings towards one another, ability to get along, lots of things, really...|`|hUt8Vt7oaa	Trust, loyalty, chemistry, similar interests....<br>  <br>  A lot of times the stars have to align just right.|`|ndZiyvWRaa	Trust.

R7b150Iyaa	I'm in the same situation, I got two of something at my shower this past Saturday too and am now writing thank you notes.  I would go with your idea of saying that her gift will be used to purchase something useful later, or you can just not mention the specific gift at all and instead say something like "Thank you for your present. Your presence and generous gift have helped make my bridal shower extra special!"<br>  Good luck.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Well, seeing as you opened gifts in front of your guests and one was paying enough attention to realize the duplicate gifts and offer you the receipt right there to return it there isn't a problem letting her know that you returned it. Write, "Thank you so much for attending my bridal shower. I really appreciate you catching the double gift, I was able to find the (Blank) that I've been looking for."|`|PqGCeIelaa	You need to send her a Thank you for the gift she gave you. I got a few  doubles and I just wrote thank you to the person anyway. I'm pretty sure they knew that I was not going to use 2 Clothes steamers.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|qVL5R8nuaa	She was kind enough to let you return her gift. Let her know what you got (or are planning to get) with the money. It was her idea to get something new.
h5ghD3Zxaa	Well you should first ask her about how things are going between the two. Although he comes off as a great guy, there may be things that you do not know. This is probably her way of getting out what she truly wants to do, which may be to possibly break it off, but cannot really bring herself to do it seeing that they have been together for 8 years. <br>  <br>  Another thing that I want to point out that if they were together for this long, then would it be safe to assume that wedding bells could have been heard a mile away? I am not saying that all people that stay together for 8 years or more necessarily have to get married, but if he is amazing, like you said, then what is holding them back (That is, unless they met when they were like 10 years old)? <br>  <br>  Anyway, there may be more to the story than it lets on. Just try talking to her about it. Ask her how things are going between them.|`|WOHc22Xiaa	well shes not gonna flirt with other guys with her boyfriend right there.|`|qGrp1hYLaa	talk to her and tell her to be herself with himm and that dont flirt with others when he is around so talk to her be sincere|`|SVyvqLIiaa	talk to her about it,

byBY2vpGaa	Make the police report.  It could come in handy in the future if he asks for property or custody.  It could help prove he is a lame dumb ***|`|vFCva8R5aa	He's probably just passed out in a ditch somewhere.<br>  <br>  However you should file the police report just in case they find him dead and hopefully they won't suspect you..<br>  <br>  It could just be a drug deal gone bad...|`|XqS5DxR9aa	Sorry, but you don't have a husband.  You have a stupid room mate.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	The time is now for you to report him missing ,for they will wonder why you waited so long to report him missing. They may think that you had something with his disappearance Just let them know what he normally does. No harm in this . The police always look to the spouse in a disappearance . So do not wait to much longer to call them.|`|XfSvwiVDaa	Hell yeah file it !  Then when you divorce him you will have proof of what an a-hole he is. I have been in your shoes it isn't fair to you so get out.<br>  <br>  My husband used to go on binges and be gone for days.  He has probably binged for a couple of days then passed out somewhere to sleep for a couple of days. That is the cycle.|`|5hxWSezPaa	You can file any truthful report that you want to.  Your priority should be getting out of the relationship ASAP.|`|chENztVEaa	So you feel guilty for not filling out a missing persons report?  My guess is you are right and he is binging again.  He is the one who is at fault here, not you.  You are reacting to the patterns he has set so don't feel guilty.  Change the locks and the curtains while he's gone, maybe he'll return so stoned he'll think you've already moved.|`|36a102df643da35a7ec81416e5244893aa	You are not wrong and I would do it now. I wouldn't put up with that one minute. I am a man and I would NEVER do that to my wife. Pic up the phone and call.

AA12135516	I really think he cares about you & you have to realize that he's watched you go through this so just imagine how hard it has been for him. Please let him help you, talk to him about it because i doubt very much that he's going to tell the world about your diary. If he didn't care for you he wouldn't have stuck around for so long watching you go through all this pain, so think about it. Good Luck!|`|gYuJUyvvaa	He's trying to help you.

LET HIM HELP YOU! He obviously cares about you and doesn't want to see you unhealthy. If he were involved in your recovery, it would probably give him some peace of mind and bring you closer together. You may even be able to convince him not to tell anyone, as long as he sees you trying.<br>  If you can't recover without professional help, then all you can really do is accept it. I don't know what you have to go through in recovery, but I like to think that it can't be worse than slowly starving yourself to death. I've only read about anorexia, but it sounds like a miserable way to live. <br>  I wish you the best of luck with your recovery!

nMzzwrtUaa	Well here are my thoughts when i was 18 years old i moved out exactly on my birthday it was both the dumbest and best thing i could of done because i got out in this big old world and got my back side handed to me. When i was 19 years old i already had a kid and a wife to provided for so i had to grow up real fast. If you have 7000$ saved up take online courses to get a degree in something to make more money. Try helping your family out and pitching in to pay for some of the bills like food, water electricity, and sewage to help pull off some of the strain for the main reason you use all those items as well. I suggest you get a job as well I know it sounds like a boat load and it will not be easy or the best thing in the world as it would seem but it will be best for you. I am now older still have a family to provided for but wish i would of taken time to save more money and get more schooling before i jumped out here. I am now back in school, working, being a loving husband and father at the same time and it would of been allot better if i would of just held out a little longer. I know when your 19 you are an adult but you don't feel 100% like an adult because you can't do much of any thing at that age but smoke and drive, you can't rent a car or do any thing really till your 21. I know when i was 20 i went to go buy a house and was rejected because of my age, (not a fancy one a kind of crummy one that needed tons of work to be called a home). Now what i suggest you get up and get a Job and look in to a Online course that your intrested in I know my courses where 3000$ and worth every penny, then try and help pay for some bills because its hard to keep every thing going in this economy these days. When you say she never lets you have things you want or like, are you talking about she doesn't buy them for you? or wont let you buy them? <br>  If she wont let you buy them then honestly she has no choice on what you buy or don't buy with your money.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	You need to be out on your own.  Find a job go to a college and  have them help you with the paperwork and your goals in life its time to leave the nest my kids are out of the house and they were out of the house by age of 18.  I did just fine and so will you and why should your mom give you what you like and want you are a adult.|`|PqGCeIelaa	If I was your mom I would want you out 2. You have no job, she has no money and you want things from her. What do you expect the women to do! GO and get a job, and go to school. I'm sure you can apply for loans or get grants if your mom doesn't make a lot of money. <br>  I lived w/my parents 'till I got married but from the age of 20 I worked 2 jobs and never asked my parents for anything besides shelter. <br>  You need to pay some bills. That's what it sounds like to me.|`|vEv2YwWdaa	Your mom wants you out b/c you dont work and ask for things.  My God, she wont let you have what you want?  Come on, do you know how stupid you sound.  You cant just quit a job b/c you hate it.  You mom probably thinks your lazy.... she is supporting you.  You are not helping.  You are an adult. Move out.  Give your poor mom a break.|`|lNqSx1znaa	I went to college, but I knew what career path I wanted. If you aren't ready, work for a while. Ask your Mom if you can pay her rent to help out, or look for a place. Make sure you have a job before you move out. It's tough at first, but you'll figure it out.|`|NoFC9rtKaa	Me and my husband have told our kids they can live with us as long as they want, as long as they have a job and are helping us out with the utility bills (electric, gas, etc.) and they also have to abide by our rules as well.  If they complain about these things, they can get out on their own, simple as that.  Your mom may not have the heart to tell you pay up or get out, but you should be helping her with the bills.  Sorry you hated your job, but most people don't like their jobs either.  It's no  excuse to be sitting their without a job.|`|KB4e8qSBaa	Goodness!  Most 19 year olds are unsure about what they should be doing and some just do whatever.  I am sure you're mom doesn't "want you out" but it sounds like she is struggling in general.  Like a lot of people these days.  Do you help your mom with any of the bills?  If you are living at home, working and you know your mom is struggling wouldn't it just be nice for you to say, "hey mom, here's a few bucks for groceries, the electric bill, or the water bills.." or whatever.  Believe it or not it does cost money for you to live with her, even when your 19.  Its just part of growing up.  <br>  <br>  I will always advise any youngster like yourself to go to college!  There is plenty of financial aid, scholarships, etc for you to go to school.  Educate yourself so that you have more options and can do things that you want to do.  Good luck!
SkUGrOTpaa	Live above the influence. i know that sounds really cheesy but its so true. PS: not every one who you THINK is a good friend really is one. Once your around people like that your going to start doing those things too.|`|HtyaefiXaa	You should stop worrying about it, many kids today smoke even though its not suggested its her life. Let her deal with that, no need to get into her business like she won't get in yours. You should talk to her and tell her that smoking is bad, but don't tell an adult or her parent, as she will get in trouble and hate you.|`|mQ1fH98taa	how old is young tell your friend your concerns if she wont listen to you ask her how much she paid for them then ask her what she would<br>  like to buy then tell her that for every packet she buys to save the money in a jar and treat herself to something nice smoking is not cool and she does,nt need to in press anyone|`|B8UFf8Ojaa	You guys better quit asap.<br>  Many of my friends regret the day the lite one.<br>  I'm the only non-smoker from my friends.<br>  Waste of money and its a death stick.<br>  Make her quit and stop drinking if your underaged to smoke.|`|1isDbRZFaa	Tell her no guy wants to kiss an ash tray. And she is starting to stink.. And You well rat her out cause ur her friend and care about her. Drinking leads to trouble at a young age|`|7wSAtahnaa	tell someone cuz if u r rly young and she is already started drinking and smoking it will b crazy when she gets older.|`|qB8moTTcaa	tell her its bad for her. STOP her now she needs to know it is bad and that you want her to stop!!!!<br>  good luck :p|`|BdJLiv7Laa	You should tell someone, maybe not a parent or a teacher, but if either of you have older siblings because they may be able to help. When i was 13 i smoked, and got caught. My brother found out and lets just say I will NEVER smoke again.|`|BlVudiyfaa	tell your friend she is wrong because she is lying. Tell her you cannot be her friend if she's going to behave like this...|`|KjzR1k1Kaa	Well tell her its a very very bad idea to smoke, it is an unhealthy addiction and is life-threatening to your health. Trust me, i know several ppl that say that if they could take one thing back in their lives, its smoking. Talk to her parents discreetly if she doesnt stop. You dont want her or yourself to be mixed with the wrong crowd. Tell her that you wont be her friend anymore, seriously, if she doesnt stop smoking and drinking, and if she doesnt then seriously consider doing just that.|`|1663aacaf477ab5d8cb4705d60ab324faa	Tell her she should dump it out before her parents find it! Tell her that it's going to stink up her purse, because actually it will, and tell her that her parents are going to end up finding it because of the smell! Also let her know that if she starts smoking, her breath and clothes are going to smell and she's going to have stained yellow teeth by the time she's 18!|`|9V07srI9aa	just tell her it is gross to smoke and hopefully she will follow in your foot steps ,maybe if you nagg her enough she wont do it , if she has a brother or sister that you talk to maybe just tell them|`|bmJxgKADaa	tell her to stop and if she dont tell someone you are saving her even if you look like a snitch|`|zUdxoRbyaa	try to talk her out of it but do not squeal.
a35c4a3ab714036bfd3c31e133920f9caa	maybe is flirting with you or trying to flirt.  let him know you don't like it.  make him look stupid if you really want him to stop or you can be nice and tell him quietly.  good luck|`|OJIZQYDcaa	That's probably the most action he's ever gotten.|`|FQnVmRqRaa	unless he's wearing extremely thick pants or has some sort of nerve damage, he most likely can feel it. maybe he likes touching you?|`|dQCZDAqgaa	he's flirting. if you do not like it, tell him!!!|`|ZKVHT0traa	he's flirting like crazy if you like him tell u so and if u dont just say to stop brushing ur leg|`|EdidZdtlaa	maybe he wants his leg to touch yours. maybe hes trying to flirt with you or something.|`|xfk2xMWEaa	lol hes flirting with you. he likes you. if you like him, push a bit back. if you dont, move your leg away or ask him to scoot over. after a few times, he will get the message
cMyPQ90vaa	why don't you ask him to take just you out and just sit down with him and let him know just how you feel and no maybe you can't change him but at least he'll know how your feeling in side. but that's my opinion. good luck :)|`|N8tKHr1oaa	he's probably going through midlife crisis|`|1egCvgSLaa	unfortunately we can't choose the dates form people. I mean everyone has a different taste and way of thinking if he's with her, it's just because he feels fine and loved.<br>  Try to understand him
NUMBHdgfaa	Everybody gets depressed sometimes.  Everybody doesn't cut themselves.  Sure, you can see a counselor if you want, but you could also just think long and hard about everything you have going for you in your life.  This seems like a serious case of teenage melodrama.<br>  <br>  I was kind of a wimp when I was in middle school.  I cried a lot over grades, homework, etc.  Then I just asked myself, why?<br>  <br>  Like, whats the point?<br>  <br>  I doubt you'd be cutting yourself if you didn't hear about older emo kids doing it all the time.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	You definitely need to see a professional. Your parents aren't qualified to help with your depression, so what needs to happen is you need to get them to take you to someone who will understand. Your friends might have the best intentions but they don't understand either, just because they haven't experienced what you are going through, and could potentially make things worse for you. So yes you need to see a counselor.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	call one of your good friends as soon as you can. tell them how you are feeling and ask them to help cheer your up. make an appointment to see your counselor as soon as you can. If you are can call your minister or priest asap that would be great too. you need to talk to someone now as soon as you can honey. i am sure you are a wonderful person who has lots to look forward too in life. please talk to someone. email if you wish|`|XKhNw221aa	it's because you're 13. I hate to sound like a jackass but, in today's society, most people want to be outcasts, they want to be depressed, even if they have nothing to be depressed about, they want it all because nowadays, being all that gets you attention. But even if you want to kill yourself, you won't. You might cut yourself, but you won't kill yourself so stop acting that way. What should you do, start figuring out what you want to do with your life. Maybe doctor, or journalist, maybe you want to be a trucker, I don't care, but what you need id a set goal. Cheer up and work it off.|`|u7LSohRyaa	Besides a counselor to help uncover what's causing your depression, you might need anti-depressants or something to boost your moods while you're talking about this.|`|vFCva8R5aa	Yes see a counseler|`|IvMPh09baa	uh....uh....uh....MOM!!!!!|`|WU6pTTvCaa	Yes, and it your parents wont take you, then try a school counselor.  The cutting will leave permanent scars . . . which will be very unattractive to any future boyfriend when he finds out.  Not only will he think they are gross, but he will think your unstable . . . .even if it was years prior and you got your act together now.  <br>  <br>  You must realize that the feeling of sadness comes with the territory of being a teenager.  Finding a productive way to deal with your sadness is what you should do.  Have a great social network of friends you can talk to.  On the other hand, having your life together but wanting to kill yourself is NOT normal under any circumstance.  Get help now, the difficult years are coming up and if you are incapable of handling today's 'stresses' you will have trouble over the next few years.  Good Luck!|`|nyrXBf6kaa	I know what you're going through, when I was your age I had the same thoughts. 13 is a very tough age, & even though I personally didn't tell anyone about it, you should.<br>  <br>  You should try talking to your school counselor or someone who can professionally see what needs to be done. Friends are great to get burdens off your chest & all, but you are so young & someone older who will actually listen might be more helpful. They will be able to help guide you in the correct direction. That's what they're there for, to help kids with their problems. <br>  However you should know that if you do talk to your school counselor they are required to call & tell your parents that you came in & what you said exactly. I don't know if that's a problem for you or not, but you should know before going in.<br>  <br>  Good luck & take care sweetie!|`|aDhZIhQcaa	You have what is known as "attention seeking behaviour".  Which means that you aren't receiving the love and attention you crave so you hurt yourself hoping to win someone's pity, thereby, that person's love and attention.  You need to get help, now.  You are frustrated by the people who won't give you enough attention and now you are hurt and angry.  Hurting/killing yourself or others, as you know, is not the answer.  All that does is make you a coward for not wanting to respect yourself or love yourself to live life, to survive life.  All human beings go through emotional problems,  it is how we make it through that makes us stronger and better people.  More loving and committed people.  What is it that you really want for your life?  Strive for that in a positive way.  Learn to believe in yourself and to love yourself.  Your life is what you make it, regardless of how others treat you.  I will pray for you and God Bless You.|`|fc4NOCp3aa	YES - you should most definitely see a psychologist to help you through this dark period in your life.  If you don't, you could end up doing harm to yourself, others, or slipping further into a more debilitating depression.|`|SHoGWZWPaa	You should tell your parents and go to the hospital ER now! You sound suicidal and there is nothing worth dying for. Talk to your parents. Don't cut yourself.|`|SToOdHj1aa	Maybe you should try to find a more productive hobby, like gashmoygading your gaflavity with my googus.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Turn to god and pray unto him for help, for he is there to listen and helps us out  Amen|`|u5nYlVMxaa	You do seem to be showing symptoms of depression.<br>  <br>  Please talk to someone, a teacher, a friend, a counsellor.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter who, just as long they will listen and help.<br>  <br>  Don't act on your thoughts of self harm, get help quickly.<br>  <br>  There are people who will be able to help you feel happier and more comfortable and you will no longer have these horrible thoughts.<br>  <br>  But do tell someone. There's nothing worse than suffering in silence.<br>  <br>  I hope you find the help you are looking for.|`|qZOuxR1Raa	im 13 too and ive felt like that before. Its like you don't know why your so upset when your life is almost perfect and nothing is like specifically wrong. You don't know whats wrong so you don't no how to react to it. Maybe it's a stage, maybe not. But whatever you do don't cut yourself. The things that are bothering you might be gone for a few minuets but will come back eventually. Tell your parents about what you've been thinking about doing. If you don't feel comfortable doing that, see a  counselor at your school or something. Talk to your friends too. Since there your ge they probably understand you best.|`|Dx9kCsrzaa	Yes, you should see a counselor immediately.  <br>  <br>  Are you in middle school or high school?  Then one way you can start is by contacting your middle or high school counselor and ask them to recommend someone for you to see.<br>  <br>  You should talk to your parents if you can.<br>  <br>  You can also do a web search for "crisis intervention" or "hotline" for teens and type in the city or state where you live.  <br>  <br>  Here are some other resources:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.allaboutcounseling.com/crisis_hotlines.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.allaboutcounseling.com/crisis...</a><br>  National Youth Crisis Hotline: 800-442-HOPE (4673)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sisupport.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sisupport.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.selfinjury.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.selfinjury.org/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Remember, trouble doesn't last always.

Sometimes just talking things out with someone who really listens to you makes you feel alot better.  Life sucks I know.. and we deal with alot of b.s. in our lives but cutting yourself won't get you anywhere.  You will still be depressed and then you'll also have scars.  It won't make anything better.  Go see a counselor please!|`|H5K9R8mdaa	i think you should go to your school councelor. they can really help you through the hard times<br>  when no one pays attention to you.<br>  you can keep it confidental. and mabye eventually you can get your parents involved to help you out.<br>  <br>  as long as you know its wrong to cut yourself, your on the right path of finding help.<br>  <br>  good luck hun!|`|McyBIwvlaa	I think you should find someone to talk to asap.....it happens sometimes when you just don't know why u feel sad...u just do. U really need to let you parents know that this isn't a game. Write them a letter or something telling them how you feel and that you need them to get you help......but at the same time talk to someone outside your house.

mTqkcTtWaa	well like everyone else same with me but instead of listing what happened you seem a little down so i will try to say something inspiring, lol ok so here it goes........you just have to wait for the girl to come , you find them easier when you dont try, there is so many nice girls you just might be hanging around the wrong places, try to be open to more people maybe, and since its happened to you so much then you probably know the girls type so stay away from them, and if someone asked you out dont just say yes think about, it will happen,....well i tried lol good luck, to every one too lol (we can make club lol)|`|kuj20srVaa	ok well first off you don't have to look for the right one eventually they will find you. its not always about you looking for her/him. its about then just randomly running into you. and if all they wanna do is use you then don't even stay with them long leave them as soon as they try to use you. its not worth it trust me my ex used me and now i sit on the side and let the right guy find me.|`|QmfKV651aa	I used to have the same problem until i realized that i need to stop looking.

The reason you feel that you get used a lot because maybe you keep on falling for the same type of girl...Plus, it takes a while to really fall in love with somebody..Love/relationships take a lot of time and work...People who are married or have a boyfriend/girlfriend, didn't get them by meeting them, then instant magic happened. Take your time with girls and don't expect every girl you date be "the one" ....You'll find somebody, these things take time..Good luck!|`|sCr2iTczaa	Damn well you need to stop dating the girls you would usually date because i am sure those are the ones who have used you.

In the Bible, (God) declares, “Behold I make all things new.” <br>  <br>  The You are not the woman of man; you are the woman of God. The more men grow to reflect God, then the hearts of women will calm down and you will be more at peace. You are not at peace today. You are very disappointed, disillusioned and hurt by mens, because you expected something and did not get what you expected. An illusion attracted you, but reality woke you up. Were you wrong to expect? No. <br>  <br>  Why do you expect something from a man? The Holy Qur’an and Bible deals with the nature of things, because no person can rule unless you understand the nature of that, which you are trying to rule. You must understand your own nature, in order to develop self-master<br>  <br>  Love is the most awesome creative force in the universe. Love is the basis of (God’s) Beneficence, Mercy, and Forgiveness. The true life of marriage is based in the quality of love. Where true love exists, we can weather the storms of life and its ups and downs. Where true love exists, we will be faithful through sickness, poverty, and through whatever difficulty life brings to us. Therefore, to accomplish the goal of the union of two people is to gain the incomparable quality of true love.  A Divorce acceptable or breakup in case !<br>  <br>  Men think after you beat up a woman that she really wants to give herself to you?  Why would want to take pleasure from someone to whom you have given so much pain?  Men want to beat women like they are inanimate objects, like trees or a lamppost that a dog will lift its leg to; like women do not have feelings.  Ignorance and authority is very destructive. That is against the law of nature and intelligence. So a woman cannot obey a man simply because he is a big, strong man if he is not intelligent and same with a woman ! <br>  <br>  Women cannot honor, respect, obey and cherish a man who does not understand what it means to be a man. So our family life is being destroyed. Our marriages are falling apart and the only way men think we can maintain strength in the house is by physical force.

DvjUO51Oaa	This is your big day and you should do whatever makes you happy. Your wedding day is for you and your soon to be husband. You should have your beach wedding, it's a wonderful idea. You want this day to be special with all the memories. I think that you should only invite the parents,brothers,sisters and grandparents.  Having a Big receptions afterwards is a great idea! That is what my niece did and we never got upset with them.  Remember.....THIS IS YOUR DAY if someone gets upset..it would be very silly of them and they will just have to get over it.  BEST WISHES ON YOUR WEDDING DAY!! :)|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi and congratulations!<br>  <br>  It's perfectly fine to do things as you want.  NO, you do not need to feel pressured to invite all of the cousins and cousin's kids to the ceremony.  The ceremony certainly can be kept small and then, as you said, have a bigger reception.<br>  <br>  The only thing that I see.....I think $3K is outrageous for what you are getting!  Really....you are getting the ceremony and some pictures and that is going to cost $3K?  Wow....I would look into another officiant.  If you want the beach, most beaches are public anyway.  You may need to get a permit from the city/county of where the beach is....but that is usually only about $25-$50.  And, then an officiant should only be around $100-$300 (judge, justice of the peace, minister, or other officiant.)  I can't really see spending $3K on what you are getting.  I would look around a bit more.  But, if you feel that that is a good deal....then you most certainly should go with it.<br>  <br>  Again, no need to invite more to the ceremony if you want it to be more intimate.  It is perfectly FINE to have a smaller ceremony and a larger reception.  People do that all the time. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|29I8PWrxaa	By the way you worded your question, it almost sounds like you only want to limit it to 20 because you found this nice package that is offered by this specific officiant.  If you are willing to pay for a large reception anyway, then why not just invite everyone to the beach wedding and have the reception near the beach as well?  Those who can't make it, can't make it - fair enough.  But you would probably be surprised at how many people would come if you gave them enough advanced notice so they could save up for a flight.  <br>  <br>  If you really want an intimate wedding however, then that's fine too.  Ultimately, it's up to you.  But if you think people may be upset, you will have to weigh out which option is better.  I would ask around your family members and see how many of them would prefer to be there if you really don't care either way anyway.  The other thing is - where would the reception be?  If your families live in different states, then one side would have to travel anyway so you would still have that issue.<br>  <br>  It's a personal choice.  If you would prefer a small wedding on the beach, then that's up to you.  But I have been to weddings on the beach with a larger guest list - over 100 - that were lots of fun and very nice.  If you can't get enough chairs and are having a short ceremony, have guests stand and let older guests sit in the front.  That's what they did at one wedding I attended and it was very nice.  I'm sure this package could be altered to accommodate more guests if you wanted more.|`|AA11100500	Just invite the immediate immediate family and see you is diffently coming, take the spaces you have left and just go down your list till your 20 spaces is full... Have a big reception party or something when you come back from your honeymoon for all family. <br>  <br>  This is what my fiance's niece did, she was only allowed 50 people to her wedding, so she invited immediate family then went down the list.|`|cPjEXQ3uaa	I would just invite the people you originally wanted: parents and siblings, then maybe a few friends that you would like there. I wouldn't purposely fill up the list. It may hurt someone's feelings if this cousin was invited, but not that one. If you think your fiance's family won't mind that, then go ahead and fill it up, but I would keep  in mind their feelings.<br>  <br>  I've also considered eloping like you, but there isn't a place close enough that is pretty enough!

P96KyO77aa	I'm 38 years old and my mother has never wished me a happy birthday even when i was little. when i moved out at 16 she never talked to me again and same as your father he does what ever she says. <br>  You just need to know that your 30 and all grown up and you don't need your to validate you anymore.|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well you have too shes your mother|`|LBAh1tPoaa	How do you know that it wasn't one of the three to five percent of mail that goes missing every year?<br>  <br>  I would not be so quick to jump to conclusions.

When Tom and Giselle were hooking up, Bridget Moynahan was fat, hormonal and all alone.  Abandoning a pregnant woman is about as low as you can get.  Frankly, I question your boyfriend's character.  Aren't you scared he'll lose interest in you if you get pregnant?<br>  <br>  And just because Tom and Giselle are married now doesn't mean he can't do it to her too.  Married men are just as capable of being blackhearts as single men are.
WETYSQcfaa	Well I'm 18 and my girlfriend asked me to marry her. Yes she does freaky stuff like that. I told her that both of us a have our education and career in front of us.

But a little of advise you have to be straight up with him and dont hide anything because marriege is a big sacrifise speially for someone under age make him understand how you are not ready for that kind of event in your life and let him know that you have a lot of plans for your future but marriage is not in it yet because of your age. well hope that helps either way your GOING to help him believe me so if i were you ill just tell him everthing that comes to mind.|`|YT9vgUNbaa	Perhaps that you feel too young to get married.<br>  ... I met the man I married when I was 16. We're very happy. We always knew we'd get married. However, we didn't actually do so until I turned 18.

a1731418e68343f01ae82b7c12846cf2aa	He's up to no good.  Sorry.  But you already know this.  He's not going to quit his job.  On the off chance he did, he'd really make you miserable for "forcing" him to.  If he were sorry for what he's done, he'd be begging for forgiveness and asking what would help earn your trust back.<br>  <br>  It's hard to make a choice if you're to leave him or not with a small child.  I've been there.  Ultimately, you have to find a way to be happy without him.  You may still be married to him, but you have to get to the point where you honestly don't care about where he is and what he's doing.  he does have the responsibility to financially support his child and pull his share of watching him, too.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	no give up on him. You have showed him once that you trusted him by letting him go out like you did but he has showed you dishonesty and trust me it is not worth it.

Is he trained for anything else? -And does he WANT to be trained for something else?  All questions that must first be answered - because he wants "none of the above" you're up a creek w/o a "paddle" so to speak.  You can't salvage the relationship all by yourself, now can you?<br>  <br>  You say he's "given up" does that mean on you?  The marriage?  You inclinate you might be part of it (i.e., "cool" wife)  Does he help with balance in your relationship by helping w/housework and your son?  If the answer is "no" you really have a big problem altogether with this guy, on the other hand, are you part of his upset in "giving up".<br>  <br>  You need to have a real "heart to heart" evening dinner and talk...in fact, you should be having "date nights' if you two are still in love...<br>  I can't imagine a husband who goes out as much as yours...He wants/needs to get away from you and the boy?  What's up WITH THAT?  Really sad...so get to the source of all this, okay?

He'll be home when you let go of your own problems.  YOU, my dear are the problem.  It's worth it if you love him and your baby.  They need a clear headed, educated woman to guide them and you are, so far, definitely not the one.  Godloveya.|`|aErUKUvVaa	Do u really expect him to quit his job, lose his friends, and stop seeing all the naked women he "works" on?  I certainly don't know him, but from what u say, I seriously doubt it.  Your son is your most important aspect of your life so keep him close to your heart and your body.  If he "kissed" another girl and tells u 6 months later, he likely did more than kiss.  Either that or its been killing him with guilt.  Depends on the way he told u which way it would be interpreted.  My wife goes out and I used to ask her all the time to call if she was going to be late, or later than expected, but it doesnt happen.  I've gotten accustomed to it.  I believe she's not out there f*cking around on me and that she is either with friends or business associates, and she needs her time too.  But its not every nite.  Nor close to it.  If u want him "back" you need to do something about it fast.  The longer this goes on, the more likely he'll "kiss" someone again.  And again..... If you think its over, then tell him and start planning the separation.  Cut your losses and move on.  I have a 3 yr old daughter myself, and things here aint been so hot lately, but i'm trying.  Searching for advice here is only 1 way i'm doing so.  So if u really wanna make it work, and it IS work, keep workin.  Good luck - hope it works out the way u want it to......|`|jofuVL9Baa	In my personal opinion: when you get married, you commit to your spouse.  You make changes in your life.  You don't live a single person life.  It's o.k. to go out by yourself, with your friends, have all guys time or all girls time.  But there should be limits as to where it is acceptable to go, when to go, with who and how much (meaning time to get back home).  I think its always a good idea to first define how you would like your relationship to be in this aspect, then sit down with your hubby and talk about this.  As far as his job is concerned, only the two of you know if it is financially feasible to change jobs-or not.  But, things can get out of hand when too much independence is given and/or received, because it can easily be taken for granted.  So I think its o.k., for fairness and peace of mind's sake, to set some ground rules you both can feel o.k. about. If there is a child and there are deep feelings, nothing is lost, its just a matter of talking it over.I hope this helps, good luck!|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Time to move on. He doesn't seem to be committed to you and your son anymore. And I'll bet he is seeing someone else. No one who loves his wife and family will stay out until 5:30 am.You have been to trusting for too long. Now it bothers him with all the questions. And if my husband told me that is kissed someone 6 months ago, I certainly wouldn't be hanging around, If he admitted to that what else is there?

It depends on what you need if it is conversation starters that is one thing, if you just run out of things that is different. Find a subject you love by going to a book store or library & walking around to find what catches your attention. Read 100 books on the subject then if you can get a tea shirt or key chain with the subject wear it so people will start conversations with your or carry a book on the subject with you. You can even meet people in that section & talk to them. If I see someone grabbing a book I like I might say "Oh, I read that & it is really great".

Your bottom line is this: You'll either get into a power struggle with him or you'll each do your best to find a shared solution. <br>  <br>  If you get into a power struggle, it means that one of you will "win" and one will "lose", and the "loser" will be resentful, and you'll hear about it the next time you have an argument. It'd be a shame if snakes came between the two of you. The alternative is to find a solution to meet both your needs.|`|mGDDpdH2aa	Why dont you just tell how you feel?<br>  Explain to him that your terrified of snakes and you cant be living in a house with them. If he loves you, he would understand.<br>  Also tell him that your not trying to make a problem, you just need to let him know how you feel.|`|O44n4xpQaa	If you just moved, and he has snakes, you should suggest him to put the snakes in a room where you don't go often like a basement or an extra room. It's okay, I am terrified of them too! EEK!

You want what you cant have because you are putting these guys on a Pedestal.  Take a look at them for who they really are.

Please try to stay away from the a$$holes they may seem great but their not. you may be attracted to them bc you don't think you deserve better, well everyone deserves better. and when you finally get something good you sabotage it b/c you don't think it will work or (again) you don't think you deserve it. <br>  <br>  P.S. if i came across as mean i'm sry like i said i just got out of a relationship with a girl like you. since i don't know you i can't really say why y do things the way you do but there's always a reason and i would suggest seeing a therapist about it to figure it out. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|9hoz5Xn8aa	Falling for the wrong guy huh? I know how you feel. If he is treating you like crap, don't bother. He's not going to be any nicer to you.

Does it mean some fantasy relationship? Or does it mean actually knowing someone well, knowing their likes and dislikes, their strengths and weaknesses? OR is the issue your self-esteem? Do you feel like you are not worthy of real love, so if someone treats you well, something must be wrong with them? And, on the other hand, if someone treats you poorly then, well, that just confirms your selfimage? Maybe take a break from seeking a relationship, or having any kind of flirtation - and get to know yourself a little better. Then you will be open to finding a real, honest, deep relationship with someone who treats you as you deserve: which, I can tell you, is with love and kindness, not *****.|`|hUt8Vt7oaa	Sounds like you're suffering from the "Bad Boy" affliction.<br>  <br>  A lot of women (and people in general) desire the things that they can't have, and don't want the things that they CAN have. Not sure why this is, think it has something to do with evolutionary psychology or some other tl:dr BS. <br>  <br>  You need to start by recognizing that you have this sort of unhealthy behavior. You need to commit to someone and see it through; your "hate" for that person after a short time with them is just your fear of commitment and your dislike for something you already have access to. If you can get past that "hate", you will find yourself in a rewarding committed relationship.|`|noI3pIXzaa	Ahahahaaa, you sound exactly like me. I drive my friends crazy! I complain that I don't get anyone when every time I like a guy, I finally get them and then think 'ewww, noooo'. I actually read that the singer Adele has the same problem. I think it's sort of normal, especially for people who are really fussy and picky, but standards are good right? Perhaps you have this expectation of love that these guys don't fulfill. <br>  As for liking this guy that treats you like ****, you obviously don't deserve that. I used to like a boy who was incredibly arrogant and wouldn't give me the time of day. It was almost as if I liked him just because I knew I couldn't get him. It suuuucks, although you will get out of it and find someone. But not this guy, he sounds like a tosser. I did eventually meet someone, who broke up with me. Now I like him even more, I think I have issues.....<br>  All I can say is that you're doing the right thing by not getting into relationships with people who you don't feel or good enough or with people who don't excite you or who you can't see yourself with. <br>  Once you find someone who excites you and who you can see yourself with, you'll be onto a winner! It'll be worth the wait. :)<br>  <br>  I probably haven't helped a bit but I hope that you can take something from what I've said. <br>  <br>  My question if you fancy it .... <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090301093223AAeLKVO&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>

At the age of 17 how capable are you of truly being in a MATURE ADULT relationship?? Exactly you'r not! Whoever the 26 year old is, is robbing the 17 year old of their youth a very VITAL part of their life that will determine who they are! The saying "age is nothing but a number" only goes to a certain extent......from the age of 15 to your mid to late twenties you are really finding out who you are, what you believe, and what you are going to make of yourself. How healthy and interdependent can their relationship be? It couldn't be if one person is well on their way to knowing exactly who they are, where they are going, and securing their belief and the other is still getting that all figured out!
LBAh1tPoaa	Before you trust a fortune teller, ask them what has happened to you and when, not will happen to you. If they can't answer that then they have no psychic gift.<br>  <br>  You might be amazed to discover that NONE of them can tell about your history, yet they'll gladly take money to tell you total nonsense about your supposed future.<br>  <br>  As for those charlatans who claim to speak to the dead,  ask them what the dead person was wearing when they died. None will be able to tell you that either - even though popular legend has it that ghosts are seen wearing the clothes they died in. No one ever talks about naked ghosts.<br>  <br>  They are all fakes - every one of them. test them and see.|`|hat60KYXaa	I'm sorry about your situation, but a fortune teller won't help you. They'll take your money though.  I don't know what religion you are but you can pray for him and maybe you'll feel better about it, or visit his grave.  I personally don't think people can communicate from beyond the grave.|`|CASwFr7kaa	My dad died when i was young also.<br>  It's strange but sometimes I can smell his cologne and it calms me.<br>  No, fortune tellers can't tell you much. You just have to listen to your heart, like sometimes I'll be doing homework and I'll feel like someone's watching me in the corner and my little girl (dog) just stares at the corner like there's something there.<br>  I'm sure your dad had habits or certain things he did, just look for those kind of signs.<br>  Just know he is watching over you.<br>  My dead died on Father's day because he decided to go drinking at a bar instead of spending time with me, and died drinking and driving even though he did not make the right decisions I know that he loves me.

Yes, you should so break up with him because his dinner partners should NEVER have friends...<br>  <br>  But let's assume you meant he mentioned before that she IS a friend... <br>  <br>  Oh my, seriously?  You do not want your boyfriend to have friends?  My boyfriend often dines with his friends (female and male) and I often dine with my friends (female and male).<br>  <br>  A healthy balanced relationship has two people that trust and respect each other enough to be comfortable with your other going out with friends.  Plus, sometimes it is nice to have a night on your own, with your friends... Keeps you sane.  You cannot spend ALL your time with your boyfriend.  You need outside sources to keep you grounded!<br>  <br>  The real thing here is... since you do not trust him, maybe you should break up with him.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	If she's just a friend and you knew about her, why would you do that?<br>  Unless you have reason to belive he cheated with her, it was probably just a dinner with a friend.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	if you asked this question .. then its time to think hes not for you sorry .. but he after a bit of sex from her i bet ..|`|LVlS4y7Caa	You're not married.

Love is the force or power generated from acting on the principles of truth<br>  <br>  Love is the most awesome creative force in the universe. Love is the basis of  (God’s) Beneficence, Mercy, and Forgiveness<br>  <br>  LOVE is the creative force out of which life comes. To truly love is to live and to have true life is to exist in true love. Lust is different. Lust is a passionate or overmastering desire.<br>  <br>  There cannot be a new world except that there is a new and better understanding of the female, which will give us (men) a clearer understanding of self and above all, a clearer understanding of (God). In the Bible,  (God) declares, “Behold I make all things new<br>  What is (God’s) view of the female? <br>  <br>  She is the manifestation of His attribute of mercy to the world. She is undeserved kindness to us, for, through her we are extended through the generations. It is only through her that we live again, and again, and again. It is only through her that we continue to move toward the true perfection that (God) desires for His creation. She is the cornerstone of the family and therefore is critical in the whole process of nation and world building.|`|31b9789366ff5be076f00fbeadf4d573aa	Have you talked to him about it?

If you were engaged but not married, then giving them back is the right thing to do. But since you were married, you should keep them. Legally, they are yours. But if they are family heirlooms, then you should give them back, but with compensation from them for their cost. Your in-laws are @ssholes, by the way, and no matter what you do, they'll still behave terribly and treat you terribly. Their behavior has nothing to do with you, and everything to do with what awful people they are. So if you want to disentangle yourself from their family, then I wouldn't ask for alimony, but for a fair distribution of assets.|`|pRZ0YviYaa	Here is a legally sound answer:<br>  <br>  The necklaces are yours, even in small claims court, your in-laws would lose.<br>  <br>  Don't bother with alimony, you haven't been married long enough.<br>  <br>  All in all, don't speak to them, and move on with your life.

As far as alimony is concerned, you have not been married long enough to claim it.|`|ndQkhqZeaa	If you are given a gift, it is yours.<br>  Never mind what they say, obviously they lie.<br>  <br>  Do not give them anything back, you gave enough of yourself.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	Deceitful as your husband was, and perhaps his family as well whom you clearly have issues with...I would take the "high road" after only 3 years of marriage and ONLY IF they are family heirlooms, would I return them.

I wonder...<br>  <br>  Usually, the actual wedding gifts to set up a new home and that are to the both of you after such a short time are split - whatever his side gave remains with him - whatever your side gave, remains with you.<br>  <br>  Well at least he's out of the "closet" which I think is healthier for him, but in this day and age, he was indeed, rather deceitful to you and this is most unfortunate.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|aDhZIhQcaa	What does the term "gift" mean to you.  In a court of law, any gifts that you gave each other are just that....gifts.  You keep any thing he had given you, period.  Only if you want to give back something does he get it.  Legally, your in-laws (or outlaws) have no legal claim on anything they gave you, either.  They are blowing smoke up your skirt to intimidate you into handing over everything.  They are full of crap.  Avoid them, hold your head high, don't ever explain yourself or make excuses.  You have done nothing wrong.  They did.  They and your husband blatantly lied to you about his sexual preference, which is morally, ethically, and legally wrong.  You should get an annulment based on misrepresentations and lying.  God bless you and good luck|`|gC8xO53Oaa	A gift is a gift and no one should expect it back. I wouldn't give anything given by them or your husband back. It's yours now and there's nothing they can do about it. I don't know if you've been married long enough for alimony, but you could try. You can have 1/2 of everything you two have accumulated though and I'd definitely get that. As far as what they are saying, that's pretty normal from either side and I wouldn't let it stress you too much. Those who know you and care about you won't believe what they say and to the others who cares. Don't give into anyone who threatens you with whatever means. Keep your head up and take and get what's yours and let the rest go. If they can see it affects you in any way, they're achieving what they want whether they get their items or not. Giving them their gifts back won't stop them from gossiping. Good luck honey.|`|eWMn7dhKaa	They are gifts, dear.  Which means that the person they are given to is now the owner of the property to do with what they please, whether that be of legal or illegal actions.<br>  <br>  In other words, you do not have to return the necklaces that were given to you if you choose not to.|`|6b3TGvJ5aa	Anything given to you as a gift is just that....a gift.  You do not HAVE to give anything back necessarily because it was given to you as a gift.  However, if the necklaces are meant to stay in the family or have some sentimental value, you may want to just give them back to avoid any additional stress.|`|vfQDSrAMaa	I dont think they can take them from you legally, in the end Im sure they would lose the battle... if you truly want to keep them.<br>  <br>  I say if they mean a lot to you keep them.

When I say alchohalic I mean Not abusive, able to hold a job, just drinks alot.<br>  Well, I share this because your ex has issues of her own.  Issues that are just as hard to overcome.

Bad judgment on your part, thinking he would develop some.|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	If you've already expressed this to your husband and he still won't change maybe it's time for the next step. I would first find a place to stay. Maybe your parents house or a close friend for awhile. I would just move out unannounced and serve him with legal separation papers. Bu you staying there and continuing to tolerate the situation he has no reason to change. I would give it a couple weeks at least and see if he realizes the severity of the situation and I share your concern for your son's well being. If that doesn't wake him up, file for divorce. The welfare of you and your son should be the first priority in his life. Not his thug buddies he hangs around. If you do decide to take him back I would insist on moving out of that area and he sever his ties with the "thugs".|`|IvMPh09baa	so... he likes to bring losers around his son?<br>  <br>  If that were my kid, there is NO WAY IN HELL any drug dealer would be around my son... absolutely not!

Did he grow up around these types of people? If he did then you knew before you married him the types of crowds he is accustom to. My first husband was like that. I knew this before I married him. I thought that maybe after marriage he would leave them behind and move on. No such luck. These people were like family to him. To this day he is still hanging with the same crowds and has become a career criminal himself. Your husband may not care what he has to lose if he is smoking weed with these guys and possibly being a runner for them to pay his debt. Your husband may never want to give up his friends and it may be a terrible thing you may have to someday face. Be prepared.<br>  <br>  EDIT: If your son is seeing this influence, there is a very good chance that your son may grow up to be like dad. I have seen a few kids who have parents that are hanging with thugs and doing drugs and such and when their kids reach the teen aged years they start getting into the same thing and possibly seeing drug dealing as easy money and ending up in and out of jail. Teenagers are easily influenced. <br>  <br>  Your family needs the Lord. Trust me, He turned my family around drastically.|`|wHDxWWhraa	ok....i think someone here had a bad decision long 4 years ago...that is natural, we are humans and make  a lot of mistakes....<br>  but what scare me is this saying " tell me whom you hang out with,and i'll tell you who you are" !.... <br>  if you don't want thugs...then don't let them get in your life or  get away from them ...<br>  So talk to your husband quietly and tell him how this affect you and your son....if no +ve result in return....then ,sorry to tell you, your husband is a thug too...and the only solution is to get rid of such loser and separate from him!!!! and take care of your son ......<br>  and see a real man to continue your life with....<br>  I KNOW YOU WONT GIVE ME THE BEST ANSWER BECAUSE YOU WONT LIKE THIS SOLUTION, you maybe fear this woman,but believe me no other is efficient....you cant continue your life not know the taste of security...!!!<br>  am really sorry and am trying to help ....you had a mistake in the past...but now you are conscouis of the results...so it is the only time to resolve......<br>  "the best time to plant a tree is 25 years ago, the second best time is NOW"<br>  so have the courage to take the desicion that will change your life to a more secured one...|`|AA11328507	If these were the same folk he hanged with before he met and married you ...I do NOT see the problem.

You cheat on him because he changed, and is now boring.<br>  <br>  Women are never satisfied.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	But his friends were good enough when you were dating and you guys were doing the same things together...<br>  <br>  You have no right to try to control who your husband can or can't have as friends.

Deal with it.|`|wqL84O8Naa	make an anonymous call to the po-po, turn those thugassed losers in, once their in jail, your hubby will have no friends|`|3NoQuoWuaa	As it should. You need to start preparing for a life without your husband. If that means socking some money away every pay day ,do it. If he is still with you and when you have sufficient funds to sustain yourself and son for 3 or 4 months, Tell him it's his friends or you. Part of the deal will be to relocate to another part of town away from the bad influence. If he isn't agreeable, Then move out yourself with your son. (that's why you saved money) The main point is you have to do whatever is necessary to protect yourself and your son from danger.r|`|AA12160073	So, take a well-deserved vacation from the little hubby who doesn't want to grow up.  Stay away until he decides who is more import:  you and your son, or his wayward friends.  Perhaps; you guys need to move and not let these low-life know where you're living.  At any rate, take control of the situation and follow through.

You want the best for yourself and especially your son. Your concerned about your husband because you love him and you don't want to lose him to "thugs."<br>  <br>  You say he is 29 and has a career, but i don't see any signs of maturity. At 29, you should be passed that life of "hanging out." He needs to step up as a father and husband and provide for his family. <br>  <br>  Solution: You need to speak to your husband about your feelings and express to him that you don't want him to hang out with these kind of people.<br>  <br>  Now, if he doesn't listen to you...he doesn't respect you. If he doesn't respect you, then he isn't a good husband. A good husband respects his wife and wants the best for his family. You cannot continue to subject your son to your husband's way of life. Therefore, you need to take him to counseling and if he refuses...you must leave every time these "thugs" come to your house. Either you go to a friends, family member...<br>  I say this because you husband is your son's influence...your son watches his father and the things he does..and i'm sorry to say this but your son MAY mimic what your husband does in the future. <br>  <br>  For your sons sake you must not allow thugs or anybody who does wrong things around your son because its your duty as a mother to protect him.<br>  <br>  I dont know if you believe in God but you can also bring your husband and you son to Church. Because with God, anything is possible.
oVxr5B3Eaa	It kind of depends. You can have good nights, and bad nights. Some girls will already have boyfriends. If your hammered, like SUPER drunk, No girl is going to want you. A little tipsy will make you much more confident, but if you're stumbling, girls are just going to laugh at you. Some girl might seem like she's all over you, but make sure it's just you and not every other guy in the bar as well. I sometimes see girls in the bar and think they must be with their boyfriend because they're going at it, but then realize they're doing the same with 10 other guys every hour. <br>  No, i wouldn't say most girls are looking for guys. Most are there to have fun, but there are SOME. Just buying girls drinks doesn't work either. Or trying to dance with them. Your better to try and catch their eye a few times and then maybe say hi and ASK them to dance. <br>  Make sure you don't get so drunk you can't judge looks. If your really drunk, it might be easy to pick up, but it's not going to be the same kind of girl you'd want if you were sober. <br>  Pick up THEN drink. <br>  It takes practice, and you'll likely fail a LOT. <br>  I find when I go to the bar there are so many guys that will offer to buy me a drink (and i'm stupid and turn them down for some reason).. but then they'll just move on to the next girl. These guys will just keep buying girls drinks until one of them gets drunk enough to hook up with him. <br>  <br>  Overall.. Easy to pick up, usually. Easily to pick up a half decent looking and non diseased girl - difficult. <br>  <br>  And remember never go to the bar looking for a girl for anything more than a one night stand.|`|AA10636677	I say that u should put it on the ah-ah-ah-ah- ah-ah-alcohooooool|`|FpDxNb3gaa	You're probabl more likely to get laid from meeting a chick in a bar than anywhere else. But you gotta know what to say. Best pick up line (or ice breaker) i've ever come across is to ask for an opinion on something..<br>  <br>  When you open with a pick up line the girl instantly starts thinking 'jeez, when's this guy going to leave'..<br>  <br>  Whereas saying 'Can get a quick female opinion on something' and then 'do skinny jeans make a guy look gay?'. Something like that, she'll probably end up chatting to you for the next 5 minutes, and you don't end up looking like an idiot.<br>  <br>  You can ask for an opinion on anything, and even if you used a chat up line you'd have to follow it up with conversation. So the example above is probably a far better option.<br>  <br>  There's loads to learn in this free audio course <a href="http://www.richardholbrook.info/puarotines" rel="nofollow">http://www.richardholbrook.info/puarotin...</a>|`|pus08YEOaa	Most girls are just out to have fun and wouldn't be interested in a really drunk guy hitting on them. Most young guys are bad or selfish lovers and alcohol doesn't make it any easier on guys' performance. Hit on them BEFORE you start drinking and you'll be more successful.|`|4V3SJ0FQaa	Easy to get drunk.  Picking up a woman is harder.  Women look for men with $$$. Sorry, but it's true.

q2AsDnjpaa	She is paranoid. If it was a problem she should have chosen to go. You can't have your cake and eat it too. She could say not to invite her again but for this time I think it would be mean of him to have to cancel. Unless she is ok with going again. <br>  <br>  Or he should just pretend to be gay and take a guy. Just kidding.|`|AiM05sD0aa	If she doesn't want to go with him and he HAS to go, then she needs to learn to compromise.  Which would bother her more, going to the function with him or him going with an ex?  He's not choosing the ex over her, but by her saying she won't go it kind of makes the decision for him.  She needs to get her priorities straight.|`|qJZRKR16aa	If she feel that way she better learn to like to go to certain types of events or learn how to trust boo boo|`|BXgqdaMVaa	Tell em Kick Rocks lol|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	she's gonna hafta lighten up and trust him or she'll lose him.  trust me...been there done that
pNrfE7fHaa	Anything related to sex.  If it has 'sex' in the name or has to do with any part of the body that isn't covered by a bathing suit, then that is too far.  It all leads to actual sex.<br>  Just some advice, don't play with fire.|`|FAQnVhH9aa	well as far as you're comfortable you can always stop and say no but at some point you become a tease and guys do not like this even if they respect you wish to remain a virgin. It makes it way harder for them. Just make sure they know your intentions in advanced. If I was you I'd stop with heavy kissing and maybe some touching but even that is hard. oral is very intimate so I wouldn't cross that line.|`|mvkIlbx4aa	sex<br>  <br>  (oral is ok imo)|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Anything that penetrates vaginally, or anally.  So no manual (fingers) or oral.  If you want to stay a true virgin, you shouldn't be letting anyone near that region at all, particularly if clothing is missing.  <br>  <br>  Honestly, dry humping and kissing are really the only things that are okay when a partner is involved.|`|fc964df50bc3ae84b97937ecb982821baa	Anything that involves your clothes being on the floor is too far.

paHjJrrdaa	I'm sorry but  this information isn't going to be found for free.  I used the US people search and found my real father. It was $60, but it was worth it! Go get one of those re-fillable Visa cards and put just enough on it to cover the price.  I only knew my fathers name to, so there is hope for you.  I met him when I was 24, 4 years ago.

Why is it so important anyways?|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Set up a fake myspace page (if she has one) and try to hit on her and see if she flirts back.Or you can just ask her or ask her what she thinks about gay people and see how she responds and ask her would she ever date a girl..but if she's confused about her sexuality i doubt she'll just come out and tell you.|`|4cWtH7X2aa	You can ask.|`|LBAh1tPoaa	Why do you care?

GSe6owcPaa	quit being a little insecure girl|`|RgAVm7zCaa	Just tell yourself that if she liked other guys and wanted to be with someone else she wouldn't be with you. She is with you for a reason, you are the one she wants! Jealousy is a hard problem to get over, I am extremely jealous, but sometimes I just hide it. It's hard I know, but good luck!<br>  <br>  xx-Shelby|`|aAZaqTpEaa	You need to take the time to realize how your girlfriend treats you. Around other guys. Like actually PAY ATTENTION. Is she flirting with them? probably not. Is she ignoring you? probably not. YOu have to realize her feels are for you and you alone. Relationships are about trust, and a part of jealousy is not being able to trust, and another part is insecurity. Why are you jealous of the other guy? Because he has something you don't? He's smarter? Get down to the bottom of it, and build yourself up from there. As for making it up to her, #1 would be to work on your jealously, #2 would be after you figure it out, sit down and talk to your girlfriend about it. #3 would be maybe do something she likes, take her out for dinner, get her flowers, write her a poem, send her a sweet email. It all depends on what your girlfriend likes. Or maybe just let her spend a day with you, no fighting, just a good close day for the two of you and you can show her you love her =) thats what would work for me =)<br>  Good luck!|`|SPhq1BFUaa	Tell her your sorry and you'll keep trying to make an effort to not get jealous. Tell her that your doing your best even now to keep yourself in check, apologize for your slipping up and getting jealous the other night.<br>  <br>  Explain to her (even if its a lie) that your getting jealous has nothing to do with your lack of trust in her. Tell her that you just don't trust other guys because you know they'll see her for the exact same thing you saw - A beautiful amazing girl (Dude, I know its sappy and kinda lame but I'm pretty sure she'll appreciate it) <br>  <br>  As for your getting jealous. It will really actually ruin your relationship if you don't stop. So rather then getting all pissed and flipping out on her, or whoever. Talk to her about how your feeling - have a REAL conversation with her. Not a yelling match. Explain that you feel threatened because you don't want to lose her. Because shes important to you.|`|m9bRpmN4aa	Awwwww.<br>  Hey, who's with her? You are.<br>  If you're getting jealous of other guys, then just think about this:<br>  Who is she with? Him/them? No she is with you! (:<br>  <br>  And if she is feeling the same way as before about your jealousy, just explain to her it's 'cause she means too much to you and you want her all to yourself because you love her (you can say what you like, just using this as an example, LOL), and that you can't help but feel protective over her. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps in some way.<br>  Best of luck!|`|X3kz6fG8aa	you have to mature a little to stop being so insecure.  I mean if you know she loves you then what is really the problem.  Maybe you need time out for yourself.  As far as making up goes...promising not to do it again is not enough, you will need to go thru great lengths to get her attention...make a fool of yourself for her some way.|`|v2XKMN32aa	Well first of all your jealousy may be valid, what exactly makes you jealous about the other guy. Do they hang out, talk on phone, hug, what is it? Your jealous may be appropriate. So what is it than we can give you a better answer.|`|63j0onthaa	she's right jealously will ruin a relationship just like that. how you can get over it? just remember the other guys you're gettin jealous of aren't with her. they don't hold her, spend time with her like you do, and they don't love her like you do. till you're actually over being jealous, try holding it in.|`|6oSm5Qxzaa	You need to just make the decision on whether or not you trust her. If you trust her then just truly trust her. If there is something in particular that she is doing that is making you mad then you need to discuss it with her and figure it out together. If you don't trust her then you should just get out of the relationship now.|`|2ksfxngSaa	Do you have a real reason to be jealous?<br>  If not then stop acting like this and try to understand that you are the most important guy to her.|`|8t7E9S1taa	just tell her u are jealous if u admit it she would stop w/e she doing that makes u jealous nd she probaly even feel pitty for u nd maybe go like this "awww ur jealous how cute" but if u don't tell her it's going to get worse nd u going to lose her

AA10065812	?????<br>  It's likely he's afraid you will try to move away with HIS daughter.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	The courts will look at what is best for the child.  Most likely what is best for her is to stay in this country, where she has family and knows the language.  Not seeing her father would also not be good for her.  Not seeing you wouldn't be great for her either, but you are the one making the choice to leave the country, not her father.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Unless your intended is a convicted child molester or abuser, and unless you are leaving the country, ther's not a damn thing he can do about it. He sounds like a real jerk.|`|ByUS0k8waa	As long as your married and not just living with the guy he doesn't have a foot to stand on. Something big would have had to change in your living situation but marriage is actually a good thing to the court. However if you are planning to move with your new husband to his base, where ever that may be, out of state he can try to stop you there. You should read your custody paper to see if it has the fact your aren't allowed to move the child out of state without first coming before the court and letting the father know. The judge can find out if its necessary for the child to move out of state.|`|t81MEJ82aa	Do you mean you're remarrying someone who actually is a citizen of Iraq or are we talking about a soldier or someone with a temporary job over there? <br>  <br>  It is perfectly legal for him to fight for custody but he probably won't get it unless you are doing harm or neglectful of the child in some way. If you plan on moving to Iraq then that is another story.|`|cGbTJobeaa	I would speak to an attorney and read your child custody agreement VERY carefully.  You may be restricted in not being able to move more than 50 miles away from your ex.  <br>  <br>  Would your soldier bf be willing to have you stay in GA until your daughter turns 18?  If you move, your ex could win full custody to prevent you from moving his daughter halfway across the country.  She's his daughter too.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	No. There is nothing that he can do. Tell him that your remarriage has nothing to do with the relationship he will continue to have with his child. He's afraid that you'll try and replace him, and reassuring him that this is not the case is the best way to defuse the issue with him.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	He doesnt have any grounds. I learned a long time ago that it never hurt anyone to want, but getting it is something else. Hecan threaten all he wants, the only thing hes going to do is waste his money. Its not as easy as he thinks to overturn a mthers custody and unless shes ruled unfit via child and/or drug/mental abuse charges, its almost impossible. Remarriage has nothing to do with this so dont worry.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	As long as your future husband is a good man, and you are not planning to move, and you are a fit mother he will just be a broke guy with a lot of lawyer bills and still have to pay child support while he gets to see his daughter on the weekends. Just because you are getting remarried isn't grounds for loss of custody unless there is more to the story than what you have said.|`|OBCvewW2aa	If you're marrying an Iraqi citizen and moving to Iraq, your ex has every right to try and keep his daughter in the country.<br>  <br>  If your ex-husband thinks you're an unfit mother, can prove it and has plenty of money to throw at a family attorney he can absolutely take custody.|`|THWHHHRWaa	he can take you to court any time he wants...he can defintaley stop you from taking the child to iraq, if that was the plan|`|jBigEy0Caa	He doesn't have grounds to take your daughter away for re-marrying.  Now if there is some other reason then I don't know.|`|gfHutvEFaa	I'm agreeing with Lucy!|`|d665c8adfe92a87bcbce06e12996f077aa	If you marry a man in the military it will interfere with his (your ex husbands) visitation should your new husband get stationed to another country. I don't blame your ex at all. That is his daughter and he loves her too and wants her close to him. He may very well be able to take custody if he can show just cause in court that it will interfere with his visits. The court may tell you that you cannot leave the state with your child but that you can go alone. I have seen this type of thing happen before. I know a woman who is stuck in Pennsylvania because she and her husband lived there and divorced there. Later this woman wanted to move west to her home state. The courts told her she can go but she has to leave her son in Pennsylvania with his dad. Needless to say she is still living in Pennsylvania until her son turns 18. If she leaves before that her son then goes to live with his dad.|`|557f121bfd3b4b87eb6c5214cbb1e223aa	He has to prove that you're unfit or the person you intend to marry is unfit.  He could certainly say someone coming back from a warzone is unstable and not suitable to be around your daughter.  Granted, all of this takes proof.  No one can swoop in and take your daughter if charges of abuse, neglect, or abandonment are unsubstantiated.<br>  <br>  Sounds like he's bitter and his motive is to hurt you through your daughter.  Sounds like his thought is if you can't be his, you can't be with anyone.  He's taking advantage of the love you have for your daughter.  People like that should be doused in gas and burned alive in the town square.<br>  <br>  (Sorry about the graphic!)|`|MYU46ap5aa	I don't believe he has grounds for custody unless he can prove that your'e an unfit Mom (using drugs, abusing your daughter or your fiance abuses your daughter).<br>  <br>  I think he just doesn't like the idea of another man raising his child.  Contact an attorney for a free consultation and watch out he sounds a little touched.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	i think we, as the society, should buy a big island off the coast somewhere,  fill it with all the bitter ex's,  and drop an atomic bomb on it and be done with it.|`|9CMGO5fhaa	If you or your new man are unfit then by all means he has a right now if he is bitter let him blow his money recoup yours through your lawyer and let teh judge handle it.|`|chENztVEaa	Sounds to me like somewhere in the back of his warped mind he thinks the two of you may get back together someday and he doesn't like the idea of you getting married.  Unless your future husband has done something to make your ex feel this way than he is probably blowing some steam in your face.  Marriage isn't grounds for loosing custody of your child and he knows that.  Maybe it is just hurtful for him to accept the fact that your daughter may be growing up in a household with a different "Daddy" figure and it bothers him.  If so, it kind of makes you feel for your ex.  Once he has cooled down just try to reassure him that no one is going to take his place in your daughter's eyes.
4Pzql73Oaa	you have my sympathy,brother, <br>  i really have NO idea what females see in manga so much!!<br>  <br>  i mean itz fine once in a while,,but yeah so many of them are ADDICTED to it just like you said...<br>  <br>  i myself know six girls that rather read manga than eat or sleep...<br>  <br>  anywayz good luck with her..maybe she just likes it..and if she still sticks to them books, itz time to get addicted to your own stack of Playboy magazines!<br>  After all, them female chauvinistic pigs need one in their face,eh??!! (with no offence to you or your girlfriend)..|`|szVvf7Nkaa	Sorry to say but her message is clear that she prefers to read her cartoons then to be with you. You really need to talk to her because what she is doing is not right. If she treats you like this now then  how is she going to treat you once you marry her. You do have a problem on your hands. And you need to fix it because if you don't then your life with this girl will get very boring.|`|No3wL14Yaa	I dont neccessarily see that there is a problem it could just be that she is really into manga right now and she just wants to read it.

a1XEf8lKaa	First off, I do not think that you should be getting advise from yahoo answers let alone anyone!  You are the only person who knows what you should do and if you take advise from other people who do not know your real situation but just what you have told them, then maybe you really do not want it to work out?  I am not saying that you should hold it all in but the person you should be discussing this with is your boyfriend and you should be asking yourself what you want!  <br>  I know that it is not an easy task what you are going through but believe me, if its going to work out then it is going to not from fate but from effort on both of your parts!  Fate is  what got you there and effort is what will keep you there!|`|BlVudiyfaa	he is a coward - 'nuff said...|`|AA11707529	When he handed you the computer, what you read was how he really feels.And he's a big enough coward to lie to you, and let you twist in the wind.By the way, all couples have problems in their 5th year. ALL. I've been married 32 years, so I know what I'm talking about. <br>  <br>  Also, guys don't know how to talk to girls. And although you think everything was perfect before, if you 2 never fought, things were definitely wrong. The thing is, if he can't talk to YOU, his communication skills won't change suddenly if he gets with a new girl. Have you told him how much you love him, and won't  be able to live without him? If you haven't -- don't. Talk about flattering his ego.<br>  <br>  By the way, you should have your feelings and needs catered to: forget his. Tell HIM that he's not a very good b/f [or husband] and that you are  thinking of dropping him. All you have to do is get him to sit down and look at you as you talk. Tell him he doesn't talk to you, lies to you, gives you the silent treatment, and that he does not care about your relationship on any level.<br>  <br>  Make sure he keeps eye contact with you. Tell him you read the computer [whatever] that he handed you, and you don't want to hear his lies anymore. That he may have a "girlfriend" [he probably does]who thinks he's hot stuff, but people don't change. She'll figure him out sooner or later, and drop him as well. And that when that happens, you don't want him  back, daughter or no daughter.<br>  <br>  Tell him that the 2 of you have a good life together, he just doesn't know it yet. That he needs to consider his options, and go to counseling on his own Otherwise, he can start all over again... that YOU have some self-respect for yourself.<br>  <br>  If he starts talking, just know it's a line of bull. Raise just one eyebrow at him without saying a word if you can. Drop your chin toward your chest and without moving your head, look up and at him. It's a pose that also tells him you think he's full of bull.<br>  <br>  At which point, just tell him you have respect for yourself, and don't believe any of his lies, no matter WHAT he says. <br>  <br>  But you need to talk to him this way as soon as possible, that way if he leaves, your daughter will have months to get used to him being gone. It will help a lot come Christmas. <br>  <br>  You have to stick to your guns too. If he wants to leave, help him pack.<br>  IF he comes crawling back, you also need to weigh your options... because once a cheater, always a cheater. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|qJZRKR16aa	Honey move on!!

m9bRpmN4aa	Hey,<br>  i've been in the same situation, and I kinda am now actually, except the fact that I'M the depressed girl and yeah.<br>  <br>  If she is looking down, ask her once if she is alright. If she says she is, then leave it and say to her that you're always going to be here for her. Actually let her know that you care about her too much to sit there and not be a help to her. Yeah, it might seem as though that'll make her feel worser, but reassure her that you'd rather be with her and be there for her then not have her at all. Depressed or not depressed, she means a lot to you and you'll stick by her. Just tell her something along those lines.<br>  <br>  If this is depressing you too, don't let her go still stay with her if she means that much to you. Being depressed sucks, but being with loved ones is the best cure. The last thing she needs and you need is to be shut out or pushed away. You'll both pull through, you just gotta talk, remain close, and try and laugh together. You have each other, and that should at least, be a good thing. I don't know why she is depressed, but eventually she'll find her way around it, everyone goes through stages of depression at least once in their life, and it happens among most young people, like me.<br>  <br>  Be there for her, and it'll work (:<br>  You both just gotta stick together.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  best of luck! <br>  <3|`|Q9sjbSkqaa	sweetie the only thing u can do is talk to her ask her wats wrong and if she cares about u then she will tell u and if u need more advice just message me kk i'll be happy to help thesocomprincess_rules@yahoo.com|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	tell her baby  i love you  what can i do for u to make u happy|`|65ojSBXgaa	Hello Friend,<br>  I'm sorry your GF is depressed. When someone is in this situation it's hard to get them out it takes the wanting of the person to change. The more your GF drowns in depression the harder it will be to get her out and of course as you know it's affecting you too and everything around you. What you need to do is talk to her and try to find out why is she so depressed? Tell her that you want to help her in every way you can but she needs to trust you you are not there to hurt her you ae there to help her. Just know that if she opens up to you listen dont judge and understand.You need to let her know that its hurting you too and you want to help and she needs to find refuge in you. once she opens up it may be hard and scary for her but walk her through it. Sometimes you need to know whats wrong with the person in order to help but again this wont be easy and again if she wants to be set free from depression she has to face it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  Gail Friend (and I am)|`|D2cCZVQXaa	It never hurts to confront someone about how they make you feel. Communications is the main key to a relationship. If you don't take a step now things might get worse. If she tries to hide it, she obviously doesn't want to hurt you. But you should say something. If you guys tell each other everything, then she needs to know how you feel too. Help each other out.|`|8t7E9S1taa	oh yea i was just like ur gf but the best thing to do is comfort her then everything will start getting better just give her a hug /kiss nd let her no everything okay nd u there for her nd that will change alot nd once she c/notice that then the sooner everything will get better|`|z1UXptEmaa	well she is depressed cause u got a little dick and u know it and thats why ur depressed too.|`|3bpwLPxjaa	I suggest she talk to her doctor about mood stabilizers.  If you love her, you can talk to her about it.  She does not have to go to a counsler.  (some people shy away from getting help because they think they have to go to counceling)<br>  <br>  BTW and this is BIG!!! **** IF she uses insurance of any sort*** the copay is the same for any amount of mgs of medicine she gets.  Have the doc perscribe double the daily dosage and she can split the pills in half.  She can get double amount of pills for the same copay!  I do this with mine.  I take 20 mg of Lexapro.  I split the 40 mg pill in half.|`|9KklDAjDaa	when a girl is going through alot of pain and misery, the last thing she wants is for her partner to be down too. instead, try cheering her up. first of all, ask her what is wrong and give her a hug. tell her u are there for her. this type of reassurance will do the trick-its warm, caring, and sweet. she will feel really relaxed from inside as she will know you are there for her =) secondly, after you have asked her, whether she tells you or not, try doing things together, whatever interests her. it may be shopping, going for a movie-anything. or even buy her a cute little teddy bear keyring to cheer her up-or even a chocolate. anything! itl make her happy as its coming from you. <br>  even if she is not confiding in you and telling you what is bothering her, or she is trying hard to stay smiley, keep reminding her you care by giving her a hug everytime you see the pain through her eyes. <br>  you asked for advice to improve the situation-this is mine =) <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|IiEtONjzaa	I have the exact same problem with my boyfriend he is always depressed. To be honest it ruins the relationship. I dont think I can live with him forever. I am a very optimistic and happy person where as my boyfriend is the opposite which ruins things. I really dont think that there is much you can do. I have tried everything and nothing seems to work. Overtime you are going to go through depression it will get to you. It really is hard to go through this and you are always thinking that there is someone out there who is much happier. Good luck.|`|hUt8Vt7oaa	Depression is a real affliction and not just some imaginary "feeling" or something. As such, it needs to be treated medically, by medical professionals.<br>  <br>  If you care about her (which you clearly do), encourage her to get counseling/therapy about it. This can help. I would also suggest looking into prescription medications, but proceed with extreme caution and make sure she asks her doctor many, many questions about meds before she decides on whether or not she should be on them. <br>  <br>  If she's alread on meds, she should think about switching to something more effective. There are a lot of SSRIs and other things out there these days.|`|qg11igznaa	You're a sweet guy and a really decent human being to worry about her like that, especially when the situation puts strain on you as well. <br>  <br>  I actually have very similar depression symptoms (I alternate between depressed and normal every few weeks) and having a supportive boyfriend really makes everything easier. Believe it or not, listening to her and showing her that you do genuinely care is really the best way to help. People with depression turn their anger inward at themselves. They doubt their self worth often, so remind her that she's wonderful and beautiful even if you think it's cheesy. Holding her and kissing her and making her feel protected don't hurt either. <br>  <br>  However, if she is not already seeing a therapist I insist that you convince her to meet with someone. This will take a lot of the strain off of you. <br>  <br>  Just be aware that she has this problem and that it's a part of her. Be prepared. Some days will be easier than others. There will be times when you question how much more if it you can take, and there will be days when you could never imagine being so happy with anyone else. It's just the nature of the disease. I wish you the best of luck.|`|JNTiteXmaa	I've got a whole mess of mental problems, so over the past year with my fiance, I've learned a thing or two about being in relationships with depression.<br>  <br>  Firstly, nothing's really going to make the situation better.<br>  <br>  What you've got to understand is that it's just the chemicals in her brain. It's not because of anything you're doing or not doing. This is one of those situations that there's no way for you to make it all better. I know that you men have a problem with accepting that you can't make the girl you love happy all the time. Just try not to let it get to you. If you get depressed or frustrated that you can't fix things, it's only going to upset her more.<br>  <br>  Basically, all you can do is be there for her and put up with her. Because eventually, if your relationship lasts long enough, you'll get to a point where she stops pretending to be happy when she's not. And she will probably just sit there and cry and complain. For hours. And you've just got to learn to sit there and comfort her.<br>  <br>  Don't take anything personally. It's her problem, not yours. Just be there for her and support her.

3NoQuoWuaa	What is your question again? I don't even understand what you wrote.r|`|frxEgBaxaa	I'd got to the little shop and check out there help with love section.  I casted thier voodoo love spell and it returned my lost love.  It's worth contacting them|`|f5FmJRfIaa	Merry Meet,<br>  I won't tell you too much about it, but a word of advice.  Don't aim a love spell at a specific person.  Granted, that is just my opinion, I believe in things like Karma, and three fold law.  You could have serious consequences trying to "make" someone like you, if you interfere in thier free will for your own selfish ends.  If you do it for the wrong reasons, it could come back on you 3x3, 9 times over.  If you like someone who clearly isn't interested in you, it would be a lot of wasted effort anyway.  <br>  If you insist on doing a love spell, then do it to ask the powers that be to bring the right person into your life.  If the right person just happens to be the person you like, well, that's nice too.  But don't aim a love spell at someone specific, if the universe has someone better in mind for you, focusing your attention on someone who isn't interested will only close the door to the potential someone else could bring into your life.  <br>  No doubt there will be plenty of people and websites who will be more than happy to tell you otherwise, but the way you worded your question suggests you don't even really know much of anything about magick, and should probably leave it alone.  If you want to learn about magick, there are plenty of books and websites out there, but if you want to learn about spells you should learn more basic information first, or you could wind up in a whole lot of trouble.<br>  Blessed Be )O(|`|zKAtOueQaa	Yes,<br>  <br>  Only if you beleive and are absolutely sure that this is what you want to do. ask yourself these question before proceed<br>  <br>  Do you really love him?<br>  Can you live with the knowledge that he does not actually feel these feelings for you?<br>  Would you want to be forced into a relationship?<br>  Can you handle rejection?<br>  <br>  If you answered yes to all of these your in trouble, But proceed to do this spell.<br>  <br>  By the light of a full moon, take a silver ring and wrap it in a clean white cloth. Dig a small hole and bury the ring inside. While focusing on the kind of lover you are looking for and pouring a small amount of wine (or milk) over the earth recite these words:<br>  <br>      Blessed Mother fair and true<br>      This Gift I offer unto You<br>      Bless this ring and make it shine<br>      Bring a lover to be mine<br>      So Mote it Be!<br>  <br>  Leave the ring buried until the next full moon, then dig it up and wear it. If your lover is near, he/she will be drawn to you. <br>  <br>  Please be careful this is a powerful spell and can do major damage if done wrong.|`|WnCTxGQNaa	they work but you need to know what your doing and sometimes you don't always get what you want. there are consequences in forcing someone to love you.

JuNf9cnJaa	Hmmm, well this is something seriously medically disturbing.  And being a friend, there should be no question about it... throwing up, or starving yourself to get thin is not the answer!<br>  I too can gain weight a lot easier then losing... unfortunately, some of us are built like that.<br>  What she needs to do is work out more.... do the work outs that are going to give her the body she wants... jumping on a tredmil or something wont give you a tonned belly if thats what she wants, and it wont take away the flab under her arms either.<br>  So she needs to SERIOUSLY study what excersizes will help her where she needs it.<br>  Secondly, "considering becoming bulimic" is not something you just "fall upon" bulimia is an illness..... its a disease... same as anorexia, or an addiction to drugs and alcohol... hence the reason they have recovery centres for people who suffer with this illness.<br>  She wouldn't know the first thing about bulimia if she was just "telling" you,... people hide that kind of thing, its like a closet secret, no one knows, but they HAVE to do it or they go crazy.<br>  thirdly, let me inform you bulimia can actually bloat your face due to the continuos throwing up... you have to eat RUDE amounts of food in a sitting and then perg it....<br>  your teeth can rott from too much puking, the neck swells making it look sometimes worse then if you were just healthy.<br>  If they do this as well, your body goes into starvation mode and starts holding all the fats out of foods when they do eat because it wants to store food it can break down later when they are not eating for survival, sometimes leading to greater weight gain...<br>  If she gets really bad then it can cause complications with having children someday, she wont get her period anymore, she could be hospitalized or even die....<br>  so if this isn't convincing enough to make her not want to do that... then I dont know what is?<br>  Tell her to just stop thinking of an easy way out, and work out harder if it means that much to her... honestly!

You succ.....<br>  <br>  anyway, I dont think you can get this info form a site, I would do an "experiement" on a real girl. I know its kind of defeats the purpose (of your question), but I would go for it, why not?<br>  <br>  If you dont have one already, form a close friendship with a girl you know, and just observe her. Keep in mind that not everyone is cut ou to just be cool and friendly alla time. Dont trip tho.<br>  <br>  Anyway, listen to the things she says, take note of the colors she wears, and always be honest, even if it makes you feel weird. Women are detailed creatures, expecting the whole world to notice what we do, and how we do. In most cases, only certain men can see that. Dont you wanna be tha MAN!?!?! <br>  <br>  If you feel comfortable doing what I mentioned above, you will "understand girls better" in no time! Most women adore positive attention and love, even if its on a friendly level. Compliments, advice, (and gifts here and there) will always a good way to put a smile a pretty girls face!

I think you should go after him, in the end you can't change a person. & if you don't love them for exactly who they are then it doesn't count, well that's what I think. But there always is that saying it's better to have loved and lost than to never had loved at all. But really it might be harder to lose him than it would be to not have him again. In the end, go with your guy feeling. Good luck!<br>  <br>  xx-Shelby
mcxM2jhiaa	my fatherw ants nothing to do with me. he did everything for my mumj not to have me. he tried hurting her and everything when she was preggers with me. i didnt even know he exsisted as a kid (dont worry he didnt live with me) and then, my mum had a new boyf. he was nice and everything (i was 3-5.. and somehow i remember his face.) anyways, he was violent had skitzophrenia, and hated me. then my mum moved house and stuff, and a new man came along. my mum had a child with and got married, but he always wanted the best for his child. my brother (whom i love)<br>  <br>  at christmas, hed buy the best stuff for his son, and when it came to my turn, my mum got me presents labeled from him, and "santa" too. and when i went in to show "daddy" what i got from "santa" he says to my mum "HOW MUCH DID THAT COST?" and id say, no daddy, SANTA got it for me. ect ect....<br>  <br>  then my mum ended up leaving him when i was 13. and as much as i loved my mum, i was so upset. my "dad" came closer to me and started asking questions like "does mummy still love me.."<br>  <br>  ect. i moved out with mum. then mum re-married a few years later. and had a child. (my sister) i was scared to love him for a while. scared to play games. scared to call him dad. so he sorta distaced himself as if he was shy to talk to me, as if he intruded. but i love him now and he loves me. mind you. i have left home and now living with a guy.<br>  <br>  <br>  the moral is, i dont knwo what it is. but i knwo whats its liek for a father not to like you. take it slow, and pretend as if you dont liek him either, it will get better.<br>  <br>  (dont get the wrong idea about my mum, shes wonderful, always wants the best for me and has a nice supporting job.)|`|oRzqWhsDaa	you are better off without him as much as that hurts I grew up with the same situation I had a mother who loved me and guided me through life my dad had a drinking problem and couldnt get past that|`|vEv2YwWdaa	You leave it alone.  If he wants nothing to do with you, there is nothing you can do.  You can waste your time begging, and chasing him but in the end you forced him.  It is not worth the time or energy.  Accept it and move on.
wlCMlFSEaa	Its sounds soppy but the whole day. My Husband had a quivering lip when he first saw me, we had fun wedding photos taken rather than posed one's, Speeches bought a tear to guests eye's (because they were so funny), we 'body popped' at the end of our first dance, we ended up drunk and did a group dance (hugging with 20 people) to all you need is love by The Beatles. Oh and my Husband did Russian dancing and ended up ripping his designer Trousers! The day was a fun fun fun and that was the best thing about it.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	When the doors at the back of the church opened and my husband saw me for the first time, he cried.  So did his best man, actually.  When I reached him at the alter, he whispered, "You're beautiful" and my heart melted.  I realized that this man loved me beyond reason and would be there for me forever.|`|BlVudiyfaa	knowing just knowing|`|lJhl3wLAaa	When we were finished with the vows and heading to the reception.

I kinda missed the fuss of the wedding vows exchange/ring placing and dance with my dad and hubby scene.I felt like a guest sadly...so maybe time to renew my vows so I CAN answer this question?|`|ZEitfScGaa	The entire day was happy for me. But, I guess when I saw her coming down the isle, how happy she was. And when I read my vows too, I teared up, just knowing how lucky I was.|`|zdW5frmPaa	Seeing the love in my husband's eyes as he recited his vows. It melted my heart.<br>  <br>  Also, I loved how he looked at me when he first saw me in my dress!
zSq1cS35aa	not really sure. i was with you on all of this except the part where you dont want anything to do with her kid. i dated a girl and after a month was more in love her her 2 year old son who had a dead beat dad, than i was with her. i stuck around for another 2 months for the kid only. i was about 24 years old. id do it again in a heartbeat with a woman better for me than she was. however, if you dont want anything to do with the kid save all 3 of you the potential pain and problems|`|AiM31dMyaa	yes<br>  <br>  but only<br>  <br>  if the child is well behaved.|`|GVlzdZKsaa	Date her. Go for it.|`|HEQc83d9aa	you are the only judge on whether you want to date this lady or not, just because she has a child it does not mean she is an alien! so what she has a child, its just more of her to love.<br>  Don't worry, she wont expect you to play mummies and daddies to her child, but she will expect you to acknowledge her child!<br>  Relax she is still a woman,not just a mother! xx|`|a35c4a3ab714036bfd3c31e133920f9caa	i have dated a girl with a kid.  the smartest/best thing she said is she does not want you to meet her kid.  when i dated the girl i was out of school and already working.  keep in mind you have a lot of school left if you want to be a doctor.  i have a five year degree so i know what it takes.  don't pass up the chance to meet new people and experience new things.  hang out with girl and see what happens.  don't rush things just be cool with it.  good luck|`|AA12259389	uhhh,if you like the woman enough then yea date her.just take things slow.|`|QJK1Uhdhaa	No, but I'd date a man with a kid :)<br>  <br>  Do you know how hard it is for women with children to find a new love?<br>  I would definetly give her a shot. <br>  You just have to be prepared for a new family in your life, not just a new woman.<br>  If you're not ready for this type of relationship yet, you can always wait on it & tell her that you're not ready yet.<br>  <br>  <br>  peace <3|`|FhWOpW4waa	It might be worth a fling, but its not a good choice for you or her as a serious relationship.  You are far too young, and have far too much going on right now for a serious relationship with a single mom.|`|0ucm3dmyaa	If you like the woman it's worth try out and seeing where things go. Who knows maybe being with her and eventually the kid is something you decide you like a lot more than you do now. Try and see what happens.|`|3GJBXyYRaa	dude go ahead n  gt laid....dnt gt emotional n all vry fast coz it mite tricky later.......njoy being 2gether n c if it works........try n b  frnd wth her son...coz if he does lik u...u stand no chance of bein wth her.....she nt putiin him aside 4 u 4 sure.......|`|kmGW34unaa	if the kid was a hot ****** daughter alteast 11, then i'd have a sex samich like dat ***** dre'know up on fif street behind da bowlin alley|`|9BsyKN9haa	I wouldn't unless you are looking for something serious.|`|OJIZQYDcaa	If money was an issue, she wouldn't be looking for a younger guy. She probably just wants some ding dong.|`|VLRZT9Foaa	I say go ahead and date her.  I have two sons (17 and 19) and I was the same as this girl.  I had no intention of letting men interfere with my life of the life of my sons.<br>  <br>  She wants someone to hang out with, she just doesn't want you involved in her life.  Good for her for being so smart!  When I met my husband of 10 years, I told him the same thing.  I knew he was a keeper when he finally said that he couldn't keep seeing me if he couldn't be involved in my life.<br>  <br>  She's not trying to trap you into fatherhood, so I say go have a good time.  She will probably end up turning you loose before you'd like, so dont' sweat it.|`|NmeOoQIvaa	if i was you i would go on a few dates with her and talk to her about you two becoming a couple, you guys should definitely talk to see if u have a connection with her, i would date her if i was you. don't be afraid of the kid, i'm 17 and dating a 24 yr old guy with 2 kids and we fell in love and i love his kids. try to give it a shot. let me know how things work for you.|`|trpxNsrnaa	Honestly, if it was a guy with a son I would probably not date him because I don't really want kids of my own.<br>  <br>  But bottom line is you should give it a try. Ignore the kid for now, doesn't seem like you'll see him much anyway. Figure out how you feel about her before you worry about how you feel about the kid.|`|QFLN2xgeaa	If you care about this woman, then the kid shouldn't matter. The child is a part of the woman and if she cares about it, and you date her, you should too. It would be a great opportunity and if things don't work out an awesome experience I guess. Good luck!!|`|PzboDDI2aa	just as long as the father is completely out of the picture or it will not be fun.|`|srj3LwHvaa	i think u should try|`|8t7E9S1taa	i didn't read all of it i stop at the part where u didn't want to be messing with her son either nd that is very wrong so move on with ur life if u don't want to be bother nd her son life dn her's u not the right guy for her cuz either way at the end she goign to be like she can't keep sneaking around her son nd lieing to him what yall going to do tell her son that u is his uncle but anyways it's going to fall apart to cuz he is now at that age where he know's stuff nd he learnign so <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck XD|`|pAUYYBZeaa	Yeah, I would. It's not about her having a kid, or not. If you feel attracted to her, and want to date her, yeah, I think you should. However, I think that you SHOULDN'T date her if you feel no attraction to her. If you're just trying to date because you've only had one girl friend in the past, and your experience is limited, I would say don't because it'll end up messy. If the attraction is there, I think you should. Her kid might be fun, I mean, I think raising a kid would be nice. It'll probably teach you a lot of things to about yourself, and life in general. I'm only 19 though, but w/e.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

tgb8DrYaaa	In our laundry room, we have this... metal panel thing... -checks- Yuhp. It's a heater that's wired through the whole house. You should be able to remove the panel by just lightly pulling (Because that's how you fix the heater if it breaks) and it should come right off. In mine, there's a little one-foot-by-one-foot space, and that's where I hide my stuff.<br>  <br>  NOTE: There might be cobwebs. Attack it with a broom first if this bothers you.<br>  WARNING: If you'll notice there's a sticker that says it's got propane gas in it, DO NOT put anything very flammable in there, like oil or a lighter.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a central heating system like this, make a secret compartment in an old book, but this will only work if the item is small.|`|9CMGO5fhaa	Hiding something you did or something you have? If you did something then don't tell and hide the evidence of doing it such as letters from school. Something you have just depends on who cleans what and where. I used to cut holes in my teddy's to stuff things in them Mom never found out but one day I had money there hanging out. I had been saving for a while and it was a big amount she called me a prostitute and a drug dealer so be careful.|`|VcIN9CUKaa	you shouldn't really hide things from your parents, because if you can't trust them and they can't trust you it's hard to build a relationship, but an easy way is just to avoid talking about anything near what your hiding, and keeping a trustful friendship around you not letting anything slip|`|aIFfOrFSaa	try under your wardrobe.<br>  in an old sock in the back of your drawer lol.<br>  an old bag under your bed.<br>  any sneaky place you can find really ...|`|keTNfOOhaa	cut out the insides of an old book, put the stuff in.

21cf999bfe54057972e1de48b7cd2cf3aa	This is the same exact thing with my boyfriend and me. When he makes a derogatory comment I just say his name in a disappointing way and shake my head. Basically, what has ended up happening is that I asked him to not embarrass me with comments like that in public. For instance, not in earshot of other people. But if we are driving in the car and he makes a comment about the race of a slow driver, I still shake my head, but live with it. Some people would ask you and me why we are with men like this, but you really summed it up in your first sentence. Our men were raised differently, mine in a small midwest town, population 400! I have lived near Houston all of my life. I guess the only good thing I can say is that if I have children with this man I will help prevent him from passing on this behavior by being a better influence in our children's lives.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Stop arguing about it. You can't change anyone but yourself. If he doesn't want to change oh well. You married him. You picked him as your mate. Hopefully you don't have children learning racism from him. If he uses the word just leave the room or change the subject. He doesn't care if you are offended by it because there is nothing you can do to him to make him pay. You will not leave him or with hold sex or whatever. Maybe getting his *** kicked by some people he is talking about will fix his wagon. Really not sure what to tell you.|`|uI4Dspi4aa	He was obviously like this before you married him, and you have now been married 10 years. Theres no sense in trying to change him because its not going to happen.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you guys just need to agree on disagreeing. But let him know that his words are hurtful to you and ask that he refrain from using them when you are around|`|SHoGWZWPaa	Well then I guess you're at an impass. Obviously he won't change. All you can do is ask him not to say it around you becuase it offends you. Hopefully he can give you that respect. If not, well there is really nothing you can do. People seem to think that they can chage someone when they get married. He was who he is now when you married him so you went into this with your eyes open.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Do not think I am condoning this for one minute but people all over the south have used that for generations without thinking about it. Often older people just blurt the word out. This is the way they were raised. Don't condemn someone because his past has given him what is now a bad habit. Try to coax him to change but otherwise give it a rest.|`|OBCvewW2aa	I'm assuming you married him that way, so why are you complaining now?  He didn't suddenly become ignorant, did he?

If he does maybe get him to actually talk eye to eye with some of the people he seems to have a problem with, not to the point of blatantly getting him to talk to them simply because of their skin color etc, but maybe introducing him to people he may get along with or if this proves difficult introduce him to the internet, where some sites prohibit that sort of language. As people tend to speak like they do in real life on the internet it may cause him to speak more respectfully in real life by default.<br>  <br>  These are some quite practical measures though talking to him while both of you are relaxed and feeling good about each other may also help him understand your point of view.<br>  <br>  Question is though: Does he act like this in work? That sort of behavior is often not tolerated in the work place. If he does not go to work maybe one of his problems is that he may have forgotten about social taboo's? If he does go to work and he does not speak like that there maybe a reason as to why he acts differently at work as to at home.<br>  <br>  On thing NOT to do is to try and force him into this sort of thing. Forcing a person into this sort of thing often causes feelings of resilience and they may lash back and become worse for the effort.

Tell him that you are not trying to change him because you married him for who he is.  However, when he says these things in front of you, it makes you feel disrespected/ embarrassed/ or however it makes you feel.  Let him know that you love him and appreciate who he is and where he came from, but you would just like it if he could refrain from talking that way in front of you.

From reading it like you said you two where raised completely different he believes it's different so some where you have to find a middle ground. I under stand the word ****** is a racist name/word, but it also has another meaning of one with lacking knowledge meaning it can be used for all races as well, for those who are reading this and are offended sorry but its just a word and a word can't hurt you if you don't let it bother you. I my self am classified slightly racist not against a certain race just against every one that claims that because I am white i owe them some thing for a matter I was not involved in. But that's how i am you can't and don't have to make him change his attitude about this issue 100%, but you can find a middle ground as in he is still racist towards a certain select amount or people (not because of the color of there skin) Also when it come to racism we all are racist to a certain point. Examples are If there is a gang activity we all automadicly think it was a black or hispanic person, Some one steals your car you think its a black person, just like if your audited by the irs you assume its a white guy trying to keep people down, If i say an illigal imagrant we all think of a hispanic so we all are accountable for it its just to different dagrees.
eawDlYHnaa	shes just trying to be a good parent. sometimes kids don't understand that getting good grades isn't an option anymore... with the economy down and business closing even though your in high school- you need a perfect GPA to get into a good school. this is extremely important... its not a luxury kind of thing. <br>  girls now-a-days do spend too much time with their boyfriends and forget about friends until something happens and you need them because you and your bf broke up.your mom might have gone through something along the same lines and is only looking out for you! <br>  as far as taking your phone away, you shouldn't be all upset over something like this. so what? you'll get it back. just calm down... and especially calm down about your boyfriend- obviously you might just need to only see him once a week if your freaking out when you cant talk to him other than at school.<br>  <br>  i bet your just at that age that you just dont get a long with your mother (or parents) and it will pass. however, it does take time... you wont see eye-to-eye for a long time but she is still your mother and instead of rebelling (bc that only makes it worse... you know that...) that maybe you should pick up some things she is trying to teach you and just go with it.|`|AA11185479	Your mother's requests are not unreasonable.  She may be overreacting, but she does have a legitimate point.<br>  <br>  She is overreacting because she is frustrated, and frustration makes people say and do unreasonable things.  She is frustrated because she set reasonable rules and guidelines for you, and you repeatedly ignore or forget them.  It's hard to convince a parent that you are adult enough to be independent and mature if you can't demonstrate self-discipline - like, for example, picking up after yourself.<br>  <br>  First, sit down with your mom and clarify the rules you need to live by.  Put the list in writing so there is no confusion or misinterpretation.  Be specific about when chores are supposed to be completed, and which activities need to take priority (homework over social time.<br>  Also make a list of your rights, and when those rights can be taken away.  For example, you have the right to spend time with friends and boyfriend, but only if you have completed your chores and homework for that day.  You have the right to participate in extracurricular activities, as long as your grades stay above a certain level.  <br>  <br>  Once you both agree on these lists (it may involve some compromise, so stay calm and open-minded), then agree that instead of yelling at each other, you just calmly say, "Check the list" and the other person must abide by the list.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	When you get your own place then that is the only way to deal with mom who is either a control freak or she is stressed out and she wants nothing but the best for you|`|vEv2YwWdaa	Your mom wants you to be a good person, she does not want her daughter wasting time with a boy, she wants you to get good grades and wants you to respect others.

Stay with one of your friends or your boyfriend, and when your mother yells at you, tell her you won't come home until she cools it.

IqtzkgyBaa	Honorable Elijah Muhammad through Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan teaches us<br>  <br>  The Old Testament says, “A virtuous woman is more precious than silver and gold.<br>  <br>  Cover of women, because the female body is a natural attraction to a real man.  (God) formed the female that way. Human beings procreate because of the attraction between male and female. A woman that covers herself is not trying to attract a man on base principles. Women have had enough of men being attracted to them because of the beauty of their forms, face and hair rather than the INTELLIGENCE of a creature of God that He created for a serious purpose “Where there are no decent women, there are no decent men, for the woman is the mother of civilization.” <br>  <br>  There cannot be a new world except that there is a new and better understanding of the female, which will give us (men) a clearer understanding of self and above all, a clearer understanding of (God). In the Bible, (God) declares, “Behold I make all things newIt is only through her that we continue to move toward the true perfection that  (God) desires for His creation. She is the cornerstone of the family and therefore is critical in the whole process of nation and world building. <br>  <br>  Since, the womb of our mother is sacred, then, this teaches us that the womb of every female is also sacred, for it is from her womb that all the Scientists, Prophets, Sages, Messengers, Kings, Rulers and Gods have come and will come. <br>  <br>  Men cannot guide a woman just with sex, and if a man is dumb enough to think that sex can guide a female, then the marriage falls apart and the relationship tumbles down. Guidance comes from the brain, not from any other part of the body. Guidance must manifest wisdom and since you are the second self of God, then the man must bring to you wisdom and truth that is from God, because the only thing that can maintain the woman of God is the word of God, rightly brought from a man who is in the image and the likeness of God.|`|SHoGWZWPaa	Do you think you will get different answers if you post this two days in a row?|`|oQq1rqDVaa	Far too many black young males are that way these days that it is an epidemic.

Get a clue!!!!  The writing is on the wall and you are too busy trying to wash it off instead of accepting that this guy is a jerk.  You have a very low sense of self esteem to put up with this behaviour.  Why would you settle for less than you deserve, or do you feel like you deserve to be lied to and cheated on.  Stop trying to manipulate him into being faithful to you.  He will never be faithful to any woman.  He is sexually insecure with himself and has NO respect for you.

0KLu4hRaaa	She has a really good chance of getting custody. Grandparents are not recognized as "parents" in most states. If custody was giving to you and you shoved it off on someone else then the other bio parent has every right to go back to court for custody. Why would you even fight her on it if you admit that you do not take care of them. Giving her custody does not mean that you shouldn't be active in their lives. The best thing that could happen is that you both have joint, and both are ACTIVE in their lives.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	It's entirely possible that she will get the kids.

How funny and ignorant of you! I dare say you probably have never stayed in a penthouse suite at Bellagio for 3 nights for your wedding festivities, had an entire design team from MGM Grand Hotel & Bellagio work on your reception decor (not just the flowers, but everything from custom lighting, custom dance floor, custom tapestries, etc.), probably didn't wear a couture wedding gown, probably didn't have a private room at 5 star restaurant at Bellagio for your rehearsal dinner, the list goes on....I would never look down upon someone for having a smaller budget than I did...that's not where I'm going with this...instead, I just find it funny how some people are so misinformed about just how elegant a wedding can be in Las Vegas.

aTsnVbMSaa	No, not "once a cheater, always a cheater". It all depends on whether the cheater knows why they did so and if they're willing to work on fixing the problem that caused them to cheat. I'm such a person and I take offense to anyone who says categorically that I *will* cheat again just because I've done so in the past. Absolute statements are never correct because it only takes ONE example to prove it wrong. Yes, there are serial cheaters but that's that person's problem. Either they don't know why they're cheating or they know and just don't care to address their issues. Making blanket statements is a bad habit.|`|IvMPh09baa	go check the cheaters guide, there you will find all your answers for generalizing about people.<br>  <br>  ADD: Again, refer to the cheaters handbook, they have case by case in the book you can refer to.|`|vFCva8R5aa	"Once a cheater...who the hell wants to stick around to find out if they are always a cheater?"|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	He is an idiot.

Sorry, but this is not your concern.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Okay but why in the world are you continuing to talk to him? You do realize you are helping him to cheat on his wife yet again, and this time you won't be able to say "I did not know he was married."|`|OBCvewW2aa	I cheated on a boyfriend once.  Know why?

Damn these pigeon holes.|`|FosasZIbaa	Well- i guess there are some people that are chronic cheaters (eh hem this dude) and some that just make a bad decision once in a lifetime.<br>  <br>   So I think people can change if they are with the right person for them. But then again if they have always cheated in their past relationships that is something to look at.|`|aWgdX0pZaa	GOOD FOR YOU! I'm glad you told his wife. And yeah, ONCE A CHEATER, ALWAYS A CHEATER. i don't care if your wife/ husb bf/gf treats you bad, or cheated on you, or doesn't care about you, there's always another exit and that is to LEAVE the person, that way you don't lower yourself to his or her level.|`|36a102df643da35a7ec81416e5244893aa	If it were me I would ignore him. Best to stay away from someone who cheats on his wife.

It may hurt their feelings but at least your being honest and they'll appreciate it in the end.

aDhZIhQcaa	If you have ever studied history and the Bible you would realize that our government's laws and ideas are based on the Bible.  It states in the Bible that "no man shall lay with another man, nor lay with any beast".  I live and let live but I do believe in the sancitity of marriage and the moral laws that govern it.  God did not create Adam for Adam, but Eve for Adam.  Our society has become so desensitized to moral wrongs that we will accept any kind of behaviour.  I do live and let live, as long as other's behaviours and choices do not affect my life, I really don't care.  But I know one thing, I would not want to be a person who practices such behaviour the moment I have to face God.  Then the judgement really begins.  Ouch|`|qpAYU8Knaa	In politics, you do not have to practice what you preach.|`|vFCva8R5aa	See if they have a website and then check there...|`|5hxWSezPaa	Listen Chester, do not even think about trying to justify anal and oral sex between men because some other guy cheated on his wife.|`|Gy9kt139aa	Sarah Palin had very strong ideas as to what constituted a marriage, yet her 18 year old daughter is having shotgun wedding.

Movies are great for dates, don't get me wrong, but not for a first date. Go some place where you can have a good chat. Coffee shops are quite good for this, I've had plenty of good first dates in coffee shops, bars are ok too so long as you don't drink too much booze. With my current girlfriend our first date was meeting up for a coffee first, then just went walking around the shops and chatting. It was a nice sunny day so it felt great. If the weather is great, go for a walk in a park maybe, anywhere that is fairly peaceful where you can get to know her.<br>  <br>  Best of luck buddy.|`|DKEOJ0h6aa	Take her to your own home dude and she won't Refuse you for sure.<br>  <br>  P.S.:-tell her you have got some surprises in store for her at your place.|`|nQuhBChNaa	McDonalds, :D|`|lymCWLcaaa	Bring her to a bar with a band playing in it!!|`|f1lpdiNEaa	I'd probably try and persuade her to go to the movies instead and a drink before or after.

Meet A but  do it with your husband's understanding, and please be careful don't let your lonely frustrated heart take over your good common sense, good luck to you honey and  I hope you have a nice visit with your friend|`|xmG5zRieaa	You are looking for financial security. There is nothing wrong with that. However, your search for the right choice has you sitting on the fence now. A or B, it's obvious that you will end up between two men. Your financial security with one won't last as long as you are holding onto a bankrupt relationship. Your bankrupt relationship will continue the run on your bank. Any hope of making some progress with A, will be sabotaged. You are not a bad person, you just need to be honest with yourself, you may not want to move on from B, until A is in the bag. You have a jealous husband and your heart is set on a different man. Interesting tho, person A has put out an invitation, if you do this," the chase me while I catch you", the excitement will soon help to push the person B further away. How painful for him....all he did wrong was lose his business and wants you to take his responsibility onto yourself. This sounds like your relationship is headed south anyway. Good Luck.
5hxWSezPaa	You know I read all the answers and I really do not believe the women who declare that they have never been tempted by a married man.  Heck, its biology!  That does not make them bad.  Acting on it makes it bad.  I'm a darned handsome man in his 50's.  I am married and I wear a wedding ring.  Yet, women hit on me from time to time.  Nothing wrong with that.

Yes Iv seen attractive married men but it's just a no no to even let it get to ANYTHING.|`|5R9d1U2Iaa	i succumbed to temptation...except he was "going through a divorce" and I was the married one....i ended up leaving my hubby for this man...|`|ujSG6NhHaa	Yes  and we have been married 25 years now.|`|jBigEy0Caa	Never.  I don't put myself in the position to be tempted.|`|5OXtsCv1aa	Yes, we're still together. Being with him I have no regrets just love and happiness.|`|TWCQCSfRaa	Heck no!|`|Z2xETWhbaa	No,  I have never been temped to have an affair period.  My husband and I don't allow ourselves to get too close to someone of the opposite sex.  That way you never have to worry about unwillingly developing feelings for someone that is not you significant other.|`|ma36UfpBaa	Why are all the women that slept with married men getting thumbs up and the ones that walked away getting thumbs down? <br>  <br>  I guess only whores are answering this question!|`|t0rOQ5FWaa	My wife never has we have the perfect marriage.|`|aBMc8J4xaa	yes. he's so perfect, i just couldn't resist. yet, he's married so i betta forget that i once met an almost perfect man of my dreams. how sad.|`|2bhMmlzHaa	Yes more than tempted 8 different married men.|`|FosasZIbaa	Yes- it is normal to be attracted to something you cannot have. AND especially if they are older they just know how to treat women better (my opinion). Just depends on you =)|`|bdLnUhRCaa	no never! and never been tempted.|`|USooqQlWaa	Yes...to both.
oKExTm8paa	Your parents need to take away some of his privileges like using the X-box until he brings his grades up.<br>  <br>  His job right now is going to school and getting passing grades. He is not doing his job. He should be disciplined before it is too late.
AA11596133	SORRY, but he is WAY wrong.  YOU should NEVER be the last on his list - in fact, he should not even HAVE a list.  ALL outside relationships should be mutually agreed on WITH your blessing - that includes Mom, and sister.  YOU and what you want or need should always come first. <br>  <br>  WHAT on Earth would ever make him think he owes his EX anything is beyond me.  THAT is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard! WHY do you put up with that? "Dissolution of Marriage" means exactly that - neither person EVER has to see or hear the other person again!  WHO told him he HAS to stay in contact with her?  My husbands EX TRIED to strike up a relationship with my husband after 12 years - so I wrote her a letter and very nicely but bluntly told her I did not agree to that, and if she pushed the issue, she would be having to deal with ME.  I admitted that I am NOT tolerant of games, I am NOT pleasant when my boundaries are crossed, and I have no reservations about beating her senseless if I needed to.  She was never heard from again.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Depends on what the "duty" consists of.  I personally think it makes him a damn good man to want to take care of his own mom and sister.  I'd draw the line at the ex-wife if there are no kids.  Also sounds like he could be being played by them too.  As in any relationship (marriage or family), I believe there are moral duties but there are also healthy boundaries.  We don't know any specific examples, so we cannot comment.|`|3Y6xb4YCaa	okay it is not normal for you to be last he should elevate you to no 1 or no 2 every person that gets married should be seen this way mum you will only ever have one and they deserve along with dad a special duty the bible also reflects this|`|f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	Nope, not normal, sorry, my hubby puts me and our kids first.  Why on earth is he bothering with his ex if there are no kids involved, no harm in being friends, but no need to put her before you.|`|3PF3lt5Qaa	Absolutely not.  I'd be concerned if he had no moral obligation to his family but you should at the very least be on a par with mother and sister if not above - after all i assume you're the one who does his dirty washing etc?<br>  <br>  As for the ex ... that needs a word!  He has no obligation to her, moral or otherwise and he needs to reconsider his priorities.<br>  <br>  Good luck :) xx|`|Ox9xc9fKaa	i think he has "duties" as a son, brother and a husband like the rest of us. all of us have a variety of roles and we fulfill them simultaneously as much as we can, so he can too... BUT he's now your husband so has no further duties to an ex-wife. if he had a child, he'd have duties of a father, but that's not the case. soooo.. the ex-wife should be off the list!!|`|N8EB7YkMaa	"forsake all others".  He is wrong.  There is room for everyone (except the ex-wife) but you are his wife now and you should ALWAYS at least appear to come first.  If I were you, i'd run like hell before this blows up.  The ex-wife definitely needs to be bye bye.|`|6cm6MB66aa	He has no duty's to his ex what so ever . You should be no.1 then mom then sister . But you should not come in between mom and sis . If he takes care of you don't try to keep him from them . As far as his ex that's just plain wrong|`|1fa1d82a6a831651d482ff85ed3b01dfaa	You should be the first in line not the last. Give him a wake up call and draw a line in the sand. Hopefully, you knew what you were getting into when you married him.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Should we not be aware of our Pride for Pride is the cause of one suffering.|`|th7C1aoaaa	No your married now.... you should be first.|`|KEUFaCkUaa	maybe she's better looking than you?|`|zTLjmrKtaa	Duty is an outmoded expression in modern human relationships.  Responsibility is what better sums up our real association.<br>  <br>  It can sometimes happen that men can be bullied.  This is not the common perspective, but it is true nevertheless.  This can sometimes result in earlier relationships being invasive in new ones, and that one of the new partners may still be 'tied' to old responsibilities.<br>  <br>  I would urge you to consider that your husband may not know how to understand that his old responsibilities have changed.  Consider that he may think it easier to confront his new relationship than revisit the difficulties he couldn't cope with in the past.<br>  <br>  Consider that your man may be more frightened of them than he is of you.  Then consider how you can help him.|`|68lLAQnKaa	he's wrong in thinking he has a moral obligation so his ex... that is insane and you shouldn't be last on the list... seek some counseling from a christian church, they are the best a dealing with this kind of thing|`|AA11185479	Technically, his moral duty to his CURRENT wife should come before his duty to his EX wife.  His duty to her as a husband ended with their marriage; he only duty to her now is as a friend and fellow human being.<br>  <br>  "Moral duty" is a very vague term, and you need to get him to clarify what that means to him.  Sometimes duties can't be so clearly ranked, and might conflict with each other - he is not required to neglect one responsibility to attend to another.  In other words, his duty to his natal family shouldn't have to come at the expense of his duty to his marital family.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	He married you not his mother, sister and the ex is the ex.<br>  Tell him if he wants to be single again put you last on his list<br>  of people to take care of and that is what he will be.. in fact if <br>  his ex is so important he might go back to her or mama.
gRZT4pnUaa	go to the tanning bed to get a base tan. Whenever it gets warm, get your pics done. So that way you could use them in your invitations, or whatever. I would say about 3-6 months before.|`|29I8PWrxaa	I don't think it matters as long as it is before the wedding.  Of course it depends what you are using them for - are you using them for anything in the wedding?  In that case, you just need to get them taken at a time that is early enough to get the prints before the wedding.  My fiance and I got engaged in December but are planning on taking our engagement photos in the Summer when it is nicer outside.  Engagement photos aren't really a necessity for the wedding, but are nice to use as a personal touch in the wedding or on invitations or save the dates.|`|nCxraniDaa	It depends on what you're using them for.  If you're sending out engagement announcements or save-the-dates and want to include or incorporate a photo, you should probably do it soon.  Or do you just want a couple to display at the reception somewhere?  If so, then I would say waiting until summer would be fine.  I don't think there really is "proper timing".  It depends on what your plans for the pictures are.|`|HcboXOmjaa	I would do it in June or July when the weather is nice. Or possibly in May if you want pretty spring scenery. Congrats!|`|e1da218fa360d619acec56b3218b6e6caa	I take them usually six to three months before the wedding.  A park setting makes for beautiful pictures.  I am a wedding photographer.  Congratulations!|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I don't really know if there's a right time to get engagement pictures.  We took ours in April and got married in September.  It's pretty much up to you.|`|CM1dfztQaa	Taking the pics in the summer should be fine. It's more about what you want then what others think anyway. Don't get too bogged down with the littler things. Wedding are stressful enough. Have fun and best wishes.
nqINitkmaa	No your not the only one, I've always wanted a diamond. I got one on september 27th! I think a lot of women say that because their fiances can't afford it.|`|e944de21d2b8be3991f127b78c28319daa	To each their own, if you want a diamond, no problem with that.<br>  <br>  I'm personally not that into diamonds... I find them boring.  My engagement ring is is sapphires with tiny diamonds in between, and very low to my finger.  It's very understated and I LOVE it!  I'm also not all that into jewelry, so it didn't matter to me how much we spent on it (heck, our wedding rings only cost about 60 bucks total!)  Not that I look down on people who spend more on their rings, as long as they can afford it.<br>  <br>  I think the main thing is to find a ring that suits your personality and lifestyle.  I'm not really very girly, love color, and work with animals and dirt, so I didn't want a ring that sticks out to get caught on things.<br>  <br>  But if you are a little more into fashion and like classy things, or are traditional, then by all means, expect a diamond.  Just keep in mind that guys aren't mind-readers :-)|`|RDWVoc9Naa	I am with u,<br>  <br>  i want a diamond (not a huge one that will burn a hole in his pocket) but i nice one that looks pretty on my hand.<br>  <br>  i like diamonds cause to me they represent 'forever' cause diamonds are forever and thats what i want my marriage to be FOREVER.<br>  <br>  and i too am dreaming of getting engaged... it will be so wonderful!!|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	I wanted a diamond. I love jewelry and I love colored stones of all kinds, but I still wanted a diamond. Traditionally, colored stones were used in engagement rings until De Beers, however.|`|GvamTVqAaa	No, I wanted a diamond - and it's beautiful :)|`|AA11352641	I can see why you'd want that. For me, it really depends on a few things. If I'm proposed to in the traditional sense, like down on one knee then I'd like it to be with an engagement ring. If it's a mutual "let's get married" then I'd be happy to skip the ring and go on an extra long honeymoon. <br>  <br>  I was proposed to once, he got down on one knee and whipped out a ring and I felt pressured to say yes because he'd bought it.|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	If the moment's right and he just hasn't found the perfect ring yet, and he still asks then I would say yes. I wouldn't turn him down just because he didn't have it. But I would still expect something (a little something at least, nothing huge) later on.<br>  And I'm not a fan of the non diamond engagement rings.|`|L6DZZ6SJaa	people usually say that and look down on people with nice rings because they cannot (or their fiances cannot) afford one. I am not saying it's necessary, but I have never met someone in person who has said, "Man I wish my husband didn't buy me an engagement ring!". That's insane. Some people may not care if he proposes with one or not, but I doubt anyone would really not want one. If they are saying that they are a waste of money, it's because they don't have any money. If you guys can afford a ring, great. If someone cannot, then I don't think it's a reason not to wed, however. Good luck.|`|kRh3slhdaa	I think you and I are in the same boat. I don't want some high end designer brand diamond that costs him an arm and leg. But a nice diamond that compliments rather than overwhelms the hand would look nice, in my opinion.|`|39e9235b89c9b80c32eb4b4082db80ccaa	i bought my fiancee a 3/8 carat diamond ring.  it's not huge, but it's gorgeous and classy.<br>  <br>  plus, this leaves room to upgrade later without crossing into tacky.|`|AhKaLuO3aa	I love my amazing engagement ring and wedding ring! I won't bother going into just how many carats, or the cost. Let's just say that diamonds are this girls best friend!  ;)|`|6UmRmaeWaa	Nope ~ I think it is great if people are all about getting diff stones but me...I got my diamond and would not have it any other way!<br>  <br>  Im with ya!|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Of course you want a diamond. So do I.|`|USwF4113aa	I always had the same opinion as you: I would dream of the moment that a man knelt down on one knee, opened a little black box with a sparkling diamond inside and asked me to be his bride. Then...my boyfriend proposed.<br>  He didn't get down on one knee and there wasn't a little black box. The love that we share and the sincerity in his voice was more than I could have dreamed though. It was the most beautiful moment of my life.<br>  I now have the engagement ring of my dreams and I got the proposal that I was too close-minded to dream of.<br>  Dreams are good to have, but memories are better.|`|AA11148769	I agree with you.  That's all I ever really wanted - for someone to think enough of me to propose to me, ask me to spend the rest of my life with them and a sweet little diamond ring.  You know - the American girl dream.  lol.  As it turned out for me, I didn't get either.  My husband didn't propose (got engaged as a result of an argument --- looooooong story!), and he didn't give me a ring.  In fact, we are going to be having our 5 year wedding anniversary in May, and I still havn't received a ring yet...  ~sigh*~  there's one dream dashed to bits and pieces.  I figure if it hasn't happend by now (6 years after I was supposed to receive one), it probably isn't going to happen at all! hahaha.<br>  <br>  But, I do want a diamond ring!  Maybe in my dreams I'll get one!|`|q7NrlanJaa	If he can't afford even a small diamond on amazon then you have to wonder if you should be getting engaged yet, a wedding is expensive and so is a house/apartment.  I'm not a fancy jewelry girl but to me this is the one time in your life you should have a real diamond.  It is a necessary expense and a way for him to show he has his finances together.  I think it shows that he is responsible with his money, even if it takes him a while to save for a small one.|`|Ocv4G6Y4aa	Of course I want a diamond engagement ring.  The point is that you don't get engaged to get a ring.  You get engaged because you are in love and want to marry that person.  So if I was asked by the person I love, I would say yes with or without the ring, even though I really WANT one.|`|CnLL5ENmaa	I def. want one. not a huge one, but not one from walmart either! haha, my friend told her bf when they were getting engaged that she didnt want him to spend the money on a diamond, she wanted a gemstone(like Spencer gave Heidi, haha) but he got her one anyways, and she;s so much happier!|`|220efd8bf22a76c726e0db2ad3ce0379aa	my boyfriend bought me a promise ring that we are going to turn into an engagement ring when he proposes the ring was bought at Zales and cost us only 239.95 and it is the perfect ring. even though i told him he could propose with out a ring.|`|ztQYhqsIaa	Oh I definately want a diamond. My boyfriend of 4 years on the other hand, thinks that it's way too material. But I have convinced him that it's what I want, and he said he will do what makes me happy. :)|`|f780ea619b789f4d61961ffc629fad35aa	No your not the only one, i do want one 2,I just got engaged on Sunday, I said yes no ring yet but he wants to choose the perfect ring and diamond for me awwwww :D :D|`|HcboXOmjaa	I for sure want a diamond. You are entitled to your own opinion so don't let anyone tell you you shouldn't want a diamond :)|`|44Sj3bsZaa	I think most people want diamonds!|`|CM1dfztQaa	There is nothing wrong with tradition. I, personally, always said that I either wanted a princess cut diamond set in white gold or a princess cut sapphire set in an antique, white gold band.
BTHY8oZYaa	I have a four year old and she comes up with fears all the time.  <br>  <br>  Keep working with her.  Take her to the park, see if she has the same reaction to the slides and ladders.  Let her practice.  The only thing that will help her through is confidence.  <br>  <br>  Falling is one of those fears that most of us are born with, (like spiders and snakes.)  Only with repeated exposure do we start to let these things go, but we will always be cautious.<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much.  Usually kids grow out of these things and move on to scarier things...like being a teenager.  :)|`|Eug52iQDaa	Practice and self-confidence is the only thing that is going to help her.  However, as long as she is tentative about climbing the ladder alone, assure her that it's ok to wait until there's someone there for her.  It's better to be safe than to push her into a situation that might harm her.

wCTq9p2Uaa	I would tell my cousin " Look, these lies need to come to a stop. If they continue, then I will see that this comes to a halt."

Good luck!|`|tDnD7Uqgaa	Find out or make something up about her and spread it around. Say how she'll sleep with anyone and they all say that it's crusty down there.

wovoZ5Z0aa	Feelings are feelings, and they don't always make sense.  You're frustrated because your boyfriend doesn't have time for you, which is understandable.  At the same time, acting on these feelings should be thought out carefully.  <br>  <br>  You know that he still loves you and he's VERY busy.  Frankly, things should improve when he's commissioned, but not by a whole lot.  Commissioned officers can be very busy for long periods of time.  If you can live with his distractions, it would probably be best to bite your tongue for now.

Gy9kt139aa	I would rather marry someone who knows more than I do; living with someone who knows less than I do would probably make me dumb in the run... And who would fix things around the house?! (I certainly can't...)<br>  <br>  Marrying someone who knows more than me might make me smarter for being around them and having conversations with them. As long as the person wasn't a belittling asshole, I would enjoy being with someone smarter.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	I'd prefer to marry someone who knew different things.  And that's what I did...<br>  <br>  I know about math and science and mechanical stuff and philosophy and personality types.  My wife knows why, when, and how the koreans were invaded by the japanese, and she also knows which movie won best picture in 2006.|`|AA11596133	Neither.  First of all, it would be pretty hard to find a guy who knows more than me, and if he did, he would be the type of guy who I am not at all attracted to.  Guys like rocket scientists and lawyers - lawyers are just high paid liars, and I know very little about jet propulsion and quantum physics.<br>  <br>  I find ignorance or people who are too slow in catching on to reality very frustrating - that would drive me nuts.  I married a man who was and is very much on the same level as me.|`|SHoGWZWPaa	My husband is really smart and that is a turn on. I went back to school though because I didn't like feeling inferior to him.|`|TXCNJAFtaa	i would perfer someone thats doent know more then cause i want to know more then him|`|bO2rzfISaa	About the same is good, but in different areas.

This is not a healthy situation to begin with but if your friend fails to see the problem or do anything about it should tell you something.|`|bjt4M3Icaa	I think that if you catch things like kisses or touching that are not appropriate then assume this is not normal behavior.  But what she could be doing is pretending that she is grown up and is kinda bitter about the divorce.

She was raised by both of them and she may be more inclined to have her mother's personality traits; she's also the older sister (I'm one of those, mother hens is what they usually call us).  She is who she is...<br>  <br>  Also - she's 14 and the whole "friend" thing - she sees through it...I don't mean it in a bad way, I just mean that she's old enough to  understand there's something going on.<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much - just take time to get to know each other.|`|mQ8e5jZnaa	no normal behavior is not calling a parent by their first name, Dad needs to step in and make that right.  She probably feels responsible to help her dad, and yes its normal to feel like a caregiver for her younger brother.  Divorce is painful, and terrible for children.  counseling helps and just plain guidance from her dad, is needed badly|`|O3CPESX1aa	Yes sort of normal. But hard to understand the why a parent would allow there child to call them by their first name... Humm that not right in my book. She is only 14 care of a five year old is adult issues. She not the mom here just a  teenager, and needs to act like one. You sure you want all this?|`|e3442b42bd59f05b36773c8ef3077c53aa	yes it's normal, my 14 year old daughter assumes my role with my ex, she looks after her 1 yr old sister, nothing odd. She's a good girl and being a help to her dad , better than being a rebel and making his life hard .|`|oXj0Y2pNaa	i noticed the same thing with my friend when her parents were divorced. i am guessing that is it just a reaction to the divorce. sorry about spelling i am only 12 and horrid at spelling.|`|cLPimVR6aa	That's very strange if child of mine called my by 1st name he/she will be in big trouble. I think the daughter is just bitter and he dad needs to put her in her place. Why you care though.|`|uVL1kJr4aa	not really. sometimes they feel presuure, feel as if they are responsible  or that they have to assume a role when its not being assumed.
yFBKkcqLaa	I would say that don't buy him anything I think he would rather that you and your family would spend the day with him. Or if you get really stuck I would buy him a silver ornament and get it engraved with his name and date of birth on it wishing him a happy birthday. Hope this helps|`|lRD08TTcaa	tools! <br>  what are his hobbies? my dad likes to work out in the yard, so for his bday i bought him some gardening stuff. think about what he likes and go from there! if all else fails....cook him dinner or take him out to dinner and a movie!|`|FI8aMuAGaa	A grill.  Regardless of age, men love to cook outside.|`|lapMAm0Aaa	Buy him a memory card for his camera, he'll appreciate it.|`|oKExTm8paa	Take him out for lunch or dinner. You spending an hour or two with him over lunch might mean more than any other gift.<br>  <br>  I would love that if I were your Grandpa.
oKExTm8paa	I think you should finish college and get settled in a job in NJ right now. With unemployment rates high at this time, you may not be able to get a job in Florida.<br>  <br>  Do some research on careers in your field. Look at states that have a lot of warm weather and see what the job situation is in each one. Then do some more research on the cost of living in those areas. You might find a place you like more than Florida.<br>  <br>  You should move when you are young, though. Once you are old like me, you will be set in your ways. By then you might have children and grandchildren you won't want to leave behind.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	the younger the better then you adapt more quickly - as long as you're not going to get homesick|`|0884ff2a0f28bad739166da0f1176c3baa	When you have finished with college and got the grades needed find a job where you'd like to live. Of-course it'll be hard at first, but that's life!<br>  When promotion comes along take it even if you have to move again. When the love of your life comes along discuss and decide together where to live - even if it means moving.<br>  Twenty or so years down the line you'll be settled somewhere with a growing family and then other factors come into play should the urge to move raise its tantalizing head again.<br>  Good luck. I wish you a very happy life.
mBXu5G5saa	Well this is as silly as it sounds, how could you possibly find a real man, you are only fifteen, when i was that age, i wasn't really interested in guys, i only focused on my school work, and they approached me, lots of them, goodlooking ones too, and the funny thing is i ignored them because i was not interested, the fact of the matter is, you are too desperate, and you should not be depressed, focus on your grades, i know lots of girls like you that were like that, all they cared about was boys and they never did good in school because they only focused on boys 24 hrs a day and today they have kids and they still do not have a high school diploma,is that what you want? you may say oh i'm not like that, but you are because when you are young like 15, you are still naive and what ever someone tells you especially a guy you do it, no matter if you disagree, and this is wrong! and did i mention how much they regretted it, it is just ridiculous, i know how you feel, because you see other kids at school with their boyfriend or girlfriend, and you are like why don't i have one, and you start making excuses like you are ugly or too tall or your body is not fit enough or whatever, you do not need this, trust me i graduated from high school already and i am so glad i listened to my parents, when they told me to focus on school and not boys, it is okay to have guy friends, only the right ones, but it is hard to find "guy friends" they always want something from you, so take the advice from me, and just ignore the fact that you don't have a boyfriend, you do not need one, when you are old enough, with your degree and making lots of money then i guarantee you that guys will be drooling over you, i know because it happens to me all the time!|`|DBdR26Ssaa	there is no such thing as a mature guy. if it makes you feel better, i never really had a boyfriend until i was 18. and no im not ugly. actually now i am 30 and i dont want a boyfriend. they are a pain. trust me on this one. just enjoy being young and have fun.|`|N0rI6N9baa	maybe your height is a turn off? but what your looking for isn't available right now. sorry.|`|XxR1CxHQaa	Hey me too! 15 and never had a bf.<br>  my homecoming date didn't rele come up and dance with me and ppl thought i was blowing him off so ppl got rele mad and it sucked!<br>  but im over that.<br>  <br>  i like a sophomore tho.  but im rele shy so i need to suck it up and talk to him.  freshmen guys like me, but i get shy around sophomores sooooooo wish me luck loll<br>  <br>  i don't think ur height has anything to do with it.  but im 5'6" soo i wouldn't rele know LOL<br>  <br>  buit im rele selective tho so if i find someone i like (like right now) i gotta go for itttttt but i haven't before cuz my middle school was rele small.  <br>  <br>  lol sorry for this lengthy reply phahhahahaaa|`|71EwzPSlaa	well your not gonna find a "real man" in high school sweetie lol....just give it some time when you get out of high school then it will help ...you have a long time to worry about not having a bf ...just enjoy school while you can lol|`|IAlFjGwUaa	jus gotta look in the right places and high school is not the right place. many guys are mature. you just have to take your time and look.|`|h03xGw9Qaa	I totally understand!<br>  I didn't have a boyfriend till this year. (I'm 15 too)<br>  And it'll just happen when the time is right.<br>  Maybe talk to guys more. <br>  Good luck (:|`|IJ4iv4Wsaa	I don't think anything is wrong with you.<br>  The right guy will come sooner or later!<br>  while you wait, have fun! what you're missing out while thinking about this, you can't get back!<br>  live.life.<br>  (:|`|lgM3xZkWaa	It could be your height.Most boys would be embarrased if there girlfriend was taller than them.They'll come around.|`|Zexhg9Lbaa	Nice try.|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	yea u wil find someone and mabye the guys might not be as mature as u think they are?|`|6lT9HmPqaa	I'm almost 18, and I'm mature. There ARE mature guys out there, but at your age they don't exist in great numbers. I understand what you're saying when you want a real man, but a "man" is someone at least my age. Don't expect anybody to "manly" to be coming into your life...<br>  <br>  When you get older, some guy will come along and talk to you and you'll probably hit it off. Just be patient, if you try to force these things you'll wind up unhappy. A lot of guys don't approach pretty girls because they're to afraid...and they hate themselves for it.|`|JVfJWd6waa	In high school it isn't finding a real man most high school guys are assholes jerks etc u know don't know how to be mature think their the shitz height doesn't really have to do with anything height shouldn't really matter what really should matter is the person u are inside if your a super cool person with a great personality than most guys would like u but don't waste your time on immature guys theres someone out there your only 15 still young and a long way to go|`|QxoF1JQyaa	Nahh your def. not going to find a real man in high school.<br>  But i'm pretty sure you can find someone who treats you right<br>  and will care for you,<br>  and thats preobley when it comes down to it what you want.<br>  so if it means to keep waiting until theright guy comes along you really should. <br>  And never stay with a guy who cheats<br>  Honestly it shouldn't be your hight, <br>  that'd be a pretty lame reason not to be interested, <br>  if they dont like your height their a waste of time.|`|ioHn3ahRaa	Aww, don't worry about it. When i was 15 i was taller then all the guys too. And never will you find  REAL man in highschool. Trust me. Some people do get lucky and find "the one" but have the time of your life, flirt, but don't lose your innocence, and be with your girlfriends! guys are stupid. Don't put yourself up for heartbreak. Be hard to get, not desperate.|`|WTgD2nUoaa	No offense you have no idea what a "real man" is a MAN is a guy that supports himself, and had a job and lives away from his parents...Now you  are 15 a MAN is around 21 or older! you need a guy your age that functions with you...And honestly you wouldnt be able to handle a real man!|`|BhjNaqDiaa	that explains everything most of the guys this age are quite short you know......But you could still find a guy your size!:)  there is no such thing as being mature........<br>  <br>  <br>               oh good luck with finding a guy !!!!!!!!! SORRY I CAN NOT HELP YOU FIND A GUY. BUT WHEN IB KNOW OF A GUY I'LL LET U KNOW|`|2zKBJkM8aa	"No guys ask me out, and I dont know its like the guys at my school.... they just seem so immature!"<br>  <br>  Guys don't get mature until about age 27.<br>  <br>  And my sister has never had a boyfriend and she's 25, so you're not alone.|`|thl3vKnBaa	dont worry so much about it.<br>  just flirt with alot of guys and they will come around.<br>  a lot of guys arent like what you see in movies. they get nervous too.<br>  <br>  and your height is not an issue. i would love to be 5'9|`|MDgVPwU3aa	Don't be depressed. Height may be a factor...but in modelling it wil be a plus<br>  <br>  The guys can be shy too around you , so be more open, flirt a little, look your best.|`|wSgfsllUaa	No I'm 19 and never had a boyfriend yet!! No your height does mean nothing a guys take a long time to not be immature.|`|XnIdLz9xaa	you're 15, cry me a river.unless you wanna date a 20 year old (which is highly ILLEGAL) its just not gonna happen|`|oFoMI9okaa	Dont rush, you will find a man. All they do is just break your heart, walk out and leave you... A good man is hard to find|`|pjrRbgnIaa	its cos they can sense that ur desperate and thats a turn off for guys|`|9XlQdh2Aaa	I completely understand that you think high school boys are immature. Its not their fault, but its the truth. If your parents will allow it, its always easier to date someone older because boys do mature slower than girls. However, you don't need a boyfriend to be happy. This is a time in your life that you should be spending with your friends and just having fun. I've found that if you go looking for a boy you won't find one. They just have to come to you. You never know when you're going to meet an awesome guy. So just have fun, and don't worry about anything you can't control. You'll find Mr. Right when the timing is perfect :D|`|F958j8YQaa	Sometimes it difficult to figure out just what we want.  You'd like a relationship, but then again, some relationships entail mostly misery.  So it's not so good to jump into a relationship, especially if you have nothing to compare it to.  It's also harder to read people if you have very little experience.  I think it's important to find a way to socialize with others, and maybe not necessarily at school.  Like make a promise to yourself that you'll find a way to join a group or do something which you enjoy and take a chance.  In life, it's the person who takes a chance at things that gets somewhere.  If you stay on the sidelines, you'll regret it for a long time.  I know from experience.|`|GbzBYzC8aa	Sorry, no but your height has nothing to do with it.<br>  well, just wait is All i can really tell you, and if you really like a guy i think that you should suck it up and go ask him out....you never know he could say yes, and if he says no, its not the end of the world, just remember that. And you have your whole life ahead of you so don't worry about it too much.<br>  Hey! i am 15 too, and i have had many boyfriends, but i have learned that it is a lot better to be single, because then you don't have to deal with as much drama, which is such a relief! let me tell ya! Right now i am dating a guy and he is THE BEST, but there is so much drama in our relationship, and sometimes i wish i was out of it because of the drama...<br>  well honey, a lot of the whole population of teen boys are immature, but there are some guys who are not...but not many.<br>  yeah i know how you feel when you say you want a real man, but even if you give an immature guy a chance i am sure there would be a real man inside of there. Oh and please dont try and find a guy on the internet i think that that is one of the stupidest things, just find a guy near you...like in your school.....or a school near you.|`|us1RhvbUaa	aw =[<br>  dont feel that way girl! <br>  its NOT ur height haha<br>  either u R in a totally immature atmosphere where the guys havent gotten a chance to relee grow up yet, or maybe ur not making enough progress to show the guys u like ur interested!<br>  sometimes (ugh dont worry i hate accepting this too lol) we cant just sit and WAIT 4 a guy to come, but WE have to be the ones ourselves to go out there<br>  4 ex..say a shy guy likes this girl, whose also shy, and both know they like each other, but neithr r brave enough to do anything/make progress, and they never DO go out =[|`|06Z3fh4laa	You're fifteen, yet you want a "real man" within your age range? Because after all, that makes sooo much sense, right?|`|Tf19RETiaa	most of the time, when your fifteen your not going to find a <br>  real man prince charming in highschool. their all immature idiots who dont give a damn about girls feelings. they will end up dumping you and you will be heartbroken. sorry but its the truth. height may be an issue but theres alot of guys who are past 5'9.

FgjhjRxZaa	Appearance and personality are exactly 50/50! <br>  People say personality is MORE important but I disagree! <br>  Sure if your going out with somebody, they won't like you if you have a bad personality BUT <br>  If your butt-ugly, how do you attract that person in the first place? <br>  <br>  In other words, they'll come to you for your looks, but they'll stay for your personality! <br>  <br>  Therefore it's 50/50!|`|srSXgoTvaa	we dont need a play by play of your looks to answer the question, fyi. anyway looks do matter, but every guy has a different opion of each feature. my hubby would think you are too thin, where as another guy would think you are the perfect size. just be happy with your looks and guys will be drawn to you. you have to like yourself enough to not change you looks just for a guy.|`|cwVQc3RJaa	The saying is 'Dont judge a book by its cover' but its fact that most people do.

But does appearance matter in a relationship?  Absolutely.  You can be the nicest person on the planet, but if there's no physical attraction, he won't date you.  It's not rude or shallow; it's just the way things are.  I mean, would you have sex with the ugliest guy you know, even if he's a sweetheart?  I couldn't.  There has to be something there that draws me to him, or a romantic relationship could never exist.|`|cwsYM2F4aa	An attractive outer appearance is the door opener.

HHB9LUqiaa	First and foremost ask yourself do you love your husband???  If the answer is yes i do then forget about the other guy and talk to your husband, if you still love him and you want to make it work with him talk to him about whats making you unhappy.<br>  If the answer is no i don't love him any more and i am happier when im not with him then maybe you need to get out of the marriage, although not necessarily for the other guy.<br>  If you do happen to leave to be with this other guy and you want to have a relationship with him you need to talk to him about it and see where he stands.<br>  <br>  I must say however that i disagree with people always saying the grass is not greener on the other side.. because you know what, sometimes it is :) but only you can make that decision.  Speaking from my own life, i crossed over and let me tell you it is greener, i know that this is not normally the case but like i said.. only you will be able to make that decision|`|1f466fb15f8227e755961caa50253aaeaa	I think you have 2 separate issues here. The first one is the relationship between you and your husband. Even if this guy weren't in the picture would there still be problems? If so you need to address them and decide if they can be repaired irregardless of your male friend. If not then you need to move on because you will eventually do something you will later regret. If not with this guy than with someone else.<br>  <br>  The second problem is if you and your husband can't work it out, would this guy be good for you. Right now everything seems wonderful because there are no demands on the relationship. It is kind of like when you and your husband were first dating. There are no kids, bills, chores, etc. All the stuff that can cause stress in a relationship.  You also have to decide if your willing to have an affair with guy and put your family in jeopardy on the hopes that this dream relationship you have in your head could be real. Is it worth it? Only you know.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	If your marriage is important to you, you will stop all contact with the guy.  Focus on why you got married and why you want to be married.  You are letting yourself get off track.|`|JnXmSLDfaa	If you start playing around with this guy while you are still married, and have children at home, just what do you think he's going to think about you ?  REspect ?  Love ?  Trust ?   I don't think so.  And you already have crossed the line with your marriage and your vows.  Maybe if you put out more effort and love, your husband will come downstairs to spend time with you and the children.  <br>  I have been the emotional and financial head of my home for too many times, and it is hell..  Nothing good about that situation.|`|th7C1aoaaa	Well sound like your the kind of women that gives other women a bad name. First, the grass is not always greener on the other side. Someday you will wake up and realize there's just as much crap over there. Second, if you want this guy so much. Get a divorce first and then do it. Don't be a pig.|`|GzvLG6x5aa	The guy is a recently divorced single dad going out with a married woman. You think he is remotely interested in any sort of commitment? <br>  Get out now whilst your marriage may still have a chance and work on that.|`|EbUSYjLRaa	wow tough one i say go with your heart you only live one and life is too short to be unhappy. if he makes you happy go for it, and see your kids every other weekend like the rest of us do|`|JccCurLgaa	Hi<br>  Take it from me - my husband has just done this to me.  Met up on the quite with an old school friend and now he wants to leave me and the kids.  I will never ever forgive him and will divorce his **** as soon as possible.  the kids will never forgive him - they will love him because he is their father but they will never forgive him.  they have lost their happy home.  Dont wreck your happy home just cause your husband likes to read and is a bit lazy about the house work - look at your husband and make an effort to appreciate that he does love you and ok he may have got a little lax but tell him you want more romance from him..... dont throw away a good marriage for a silly little flutter of your heart - remember your husband made it flutter before and will do again if you both make some effort.... Really what are people playing at GROW UP.  MARRIAGE IS Not a game IT IS A REALITY AND SO ARE YOUR CHILDRENS LIVES AND HEARTS.|`|LQISGYbEaa	Every relationship is exciting and wonderful in the beginning.<br>  If you divorced your husband and got with this new guy the newness would eventually wear off and you'll be complaining about all the things he does and talking about how he just isn't exciting anymore. He will come with his own set of problems, because every man and woman does.<br>  It takes someone who has some character to realize this, and you clearly have none.<br>  And yes your kids will hate you, and they will suffer.|`|mQ8e5jZnaa	STOP playing in other womens backyards, stay in your own backyard.  Seriously, how would you feel if the situation was reversed?   If he was carrying on an emotional affair, making out with another woman?  Shape up, the grass is never greener, EVER!  You need to work on your marriage, for your sake, his and your children.  Someone on here mentioned "giving women a bad name?"  Yes partly true, but it takes 2 to tango.  Your children will never hate you but divorce is ugly and especially if it involves possible affair, infidelity, etc.  I think you should lose this person, the new guy, and realize your marriage is whats important.  Your children and marriage, wake your husband up, communicate with him, give him the chance to make this right.  Tell him the things he is not doing right, and what you want from him, but be ready to hear his side too.  Its about 2 people, not just 1|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Let me be very blunt and honest with you. You said you like the attention he gives you, and since your husband doesn't give it to you , you are getting it from this guy. Well, that's how ALL people are in the beginning of a relationship. They are so perfect and there for any and everything you need. Once the relationship has been going for a while the new-ness wares off and that kind of stuff tends to not happen as often or at all. So you are risking losing your husband for something that would only end up being temporary with this man anyways.<br>  <br>  If you left your husband and moved in with this guy, I'm sure that after a while he wouldn't be putting in as much effort to woo you over any more. <br>  <br>  Stop being a whore behind your husbands back, and treat you man right! Or leave him so he can find a classy woman who will appreciate him and treat him good.<br>  <br>  How would you feel if you found out that your husband was doing the SAME thing? I'm sure you would be crushed. Also do this, close your eyes and imagine your husband having awesome mind blowing sex, with a 22 year old , that has a body of a goddess? Does that make your stomach twing? Does it make you sick? Does it crush your heart?<br>  If not, then leave him, if it does bother you then again BE A WOMAN A WIFE AND MOTHER AND STOP THIS SCHOOL AGE DRAMA|`|m81dfyOYaa	You should work at fixing what you have (marriage counseling). The grass is always greener on the other side but not a reality.  While I'm sure it's pleasant and titillating to chat with someone who is attentive, you owe it to your spouse and children to try to work through your issues. Good Luck.
wRHhpanmaa	Look, look, look....people are telling you to end the engagement and stuff like that.<br>  <br>  I had/have the exact same problem. I was with a guy for a while, and He was my first love. Gosh, he was the first guy I ever loved more than myself. He broke up with me for no reason at all. He left for a mission trip to North Carolina, called me once, told me how much he loved me and missed me, and then dumped me once he got back. I was devastated and didnt date anyone for about a year afterwards. I just needed some me time. <br>  <br>  This happens to people all the time babe. I got engaged to alexander, and then after three months he and I got married.<br>  <br>  It is easy to remember the good times, and you will always remember your first love. Always. Like they say, the first cut is always the deepest. I had  the ring, the letters, the pictures, everything from my first love in a box in my closet.It was so so hard for me to let go, and even harder because i knew he was with someone else. <br>  <br>  but you have to think hon, if it didnt work out the first time, then it wasnt meant to be. It won't work out the second time. You will always wonder if he is going to break up with you, or if things are going downhill etc. Sure you will be happy for a little while, but then what, back to fighting and breaking up. Me and Matthew never fought the whole time we were together, but we still wound up breaking up.<br>  <br>  And then what after that? After you are alone, you are gonna remember your fiance and think of what may have been with him. It is gonna be the same way and he is going to be happy with someone else. <br>  <br>  It is impossible to forget your first love. Impossible. No matter what, songs on the radio, little things like movies, outfits, places, are always gonna remind you of him. <br>  <br>  but after you start to make more memories with your fiance, you will think of your ex less and less.<br>  <br>  don't throw away a great guy on what could have been. especially if he is happy with someone else. <br>  <br>  If you have to, tell your fiance you want a long engagement. Tell him you need more time. Just make sure what you are doing is going to make YOU happy. Dont think about him, dont think abuot anyone but you. If you aren't going to be happy married to this guy, then by all means, dont do it. but are you honestly gonna wait around for your ex to break up with his girlfriend? dont chase old dreams honey...make new ones.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	Get rid of both of them and grow up. I still love my ex. He is my sons dad. He will always have a place in my heart. But the love I have for him is different then the love I have for my fiance. Do you love your ex more because of the memories you two shared or because he was your first love? Why did you agree to marry someone if you didn't have enough love for him? Seriously, don't put your fiance through this immature bullcrap. Make a decision. Don't dwell on the past and what you no longer have. Move on.|`|VlzlPAEwaa	young, young, young, you weren't even over your ex, and you rebounded to someone else,grow up a bit, call this off, until you are clear in your mind of what you want to do...|`|gRZT4pnUaa	You should not be getting married. Its not fair to you or him. You will probably not have a good marriage if you are in love with someone else.|`|3gljWitCaa	be honest<br>  do not marry this man if you do not love him <br>  <br>  just dont date or do anything for awhile<br>  end this relationship and just get your head straight and decide what to do <br>  <br>  hollyy|`|RuKK1LYiaa	its only mean if you tell your ex and then get married, you may very well have those feeling the rest of your life. My ex and also the father of my oldest daughter(left when i got pregnant) actually had the nerve to call me on HIS wedding day and tell me he still loved me. we havent spoken since that happened cause it hurt me so badly knowing he still loved me yet was marrying someone else, i'll always love him but i cant even talk to him now and after we had split up we kept in touch as friends but he completely ruined by what he did and broke my heart. you need to think about it long and hard before you get married to your now fiance, good luck.|`|q7NrlanJaa	DO NOT get married to someone you don't absolutely love.  It would be better to be alone than marry someone you don't truly love more than anyone else.  If you know there is someone else out there you feel would be better with you then you know this guy isn't the one.  Even if you can't be with your ex you are only hurting yourself to marry someone who it will not work out with.  You don't want to end up divorced when you knew he probably wasn't the one when you got married.  Save yourself the pain of regret and at least put off marrying him until you decide how you really feel.  How can you marry someone when all you can think about is someone else??  Sorry but that is just disrespectful to your fiance and is bad for you too.|`|tyl9aSu9aa	End the engagement.<br>  <br>  If you spend all your time thinking about another guy, it's not fair to you or your fiance to marry. It'll be a waste of time and a wrenching experience in the end, because you will probably end up divorcing.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying this to hurt you. Honestly, I think (from the little you told us) that your relationship with your ex was at best immature and at worst unhealthy. It truly sounds like you didn't give yourself enough time to grieve, or learn lessons from what went wrong.<br>  <br>  You don't say how long you and your fiance have been together, but it can take a long time to get over an old relationship that ended poorly and learn from it. It's even harder to do that once you get involved with a new person, because a lot of people don't do it - they just get sucked in and ignore their doubts.<br>  <br>  Those doubts are speaking up now, and it sounds like they're speaking pretty loudly.<br>  <br>  Listen to them.<br>  <br>  End your engagement, no matter how much it hurts you or him, and know that you're doing the right thing.<br>  <br>  Good luck - and don't listen to any abuse anyone throws your way.|`|Th2qZedsaa	you will end up hurting somebody. it sounds like you are only thinking of yourself.....you arent thinking about the man your going to marry, you ex, or his girlfriend. how do you think she will feel that some ex girlfriend wants to be back in her partners life. and if your ex doesnt want you back you will be hurt and then have nobody. you cant marry this man its unfair to treat somebody like that when you like somebody else.|`|HcboXOmjaa	You may be feeling this way b/c your ex bf has a gf and it may  just be jealousy.  Remember why you broke up and that is was a while ago.  People change so how do you know you are compatible now?  However, if you truly love your ex more than your fiance, which is sad, you shouldn't plan on marrying him.  Maybe you should be single for a while to think things through.|`|USwF4113aa	You will never get over your first love, but don't be naive to think that it would work now.<br>  <br>  As for your fiance, you are be completely unfair. He deserves to hear whats going on in your heart. Don't go to the extreme of breaking it completely off with him, but let him know how you're feeling. If the two of you have a mature enough relationship he will gain respect for you and be willing to help you in any way that he can. Don't keep hiding the truth though. That is the worst possible thing you could do. Be respectful and honest; you will get the same in return.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|CM1dfztQaa	You're going to cause more damage if you marry someone you haven't given your whole heart to. Don't be selfish. You are not ready for marriage.|`|cqgWkdPtaa	do not get married, you may hurt your fiance now but its better than putting him through a life of hell. Break it off, do not waste your fiances life, even if you cannot have your ex, you cannot lie and stay with your fiance, its your problem, not his|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	You need to either postpone or end the engagement until you are sure that marriage to your boyfriend is what you want. It's not fair to him that you're fantasizing about your ex. You need to grow up and decide which means more to you. <br>  <br>  Remember - he's your ex for a reason. If he was that great, you'd still be with him.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	If you can't move on with your life and leave your ex in the past, you are being selfish and it is not fair to your fiance because you can't give all of yourself to him when you are pining over someone else.|`|6UmRmaeWaa	Tell your soon to be hubby you wanna wait and have a long engagement. Chat with your ex before it is too late. Find this out before your soon to be hubby is wondering what the problem is. Then you might loos a really great guy!|`|29I8PWrxaa	Why on earth did you agree to marry this guy if you are in love with another man?  I dated my ex from when I was 15 to 21 and sure, it's easy to remember the good times with him now, but there's a reason why we broke up.  I met my fiance about six months later and we have been together ever since for the last two years and a couple months.  Sure, at first I still thought about my ex when my fiance and I started dating - but not for a long time!  You shouldn't get engaged if you are still fantasizing about someone else.  And you should marry this guy just because your ex has another girlfriend.  What are you going to do if your ex and his girlfriend break up?  Leave your fiance or husband?  It's not fair to your fiance for you to be with him but thinking about someone else.  You should be an adult and tell him how you feel and break off the engagement.

fBso80Ubaa	I had to do that when I was growing up.  After age 3, any closeness I had with my parents almost completely vanished.  They were focused strictly on making sure I had food, clothes, and a roof over my head.  And most importantly, that I had good grades in school; if I got anything lower than C, I was grounded for a week.  As far as anything else is concerned (life skills, emotional well-being), I was pretty much on my own.  Since they were very old-fashioned (read: strict), I didn't dare talk about things that bothered me, let alone my daily life.  I relied heavily on books, TV, pop culture, and my friends.<br>  <br>  So here are the things I can suggest.<br>  * Do well in school; it'll pay off when you start applying to colleges<br>  * Find a hobby you enjoy, and pursue it extensively<br>  * Spend a lot of time with your friends; they're your support network, even if you might not realize it<br>  * If you have the pick-up skills, find yourself a girlfriend; the caring and affection she'll give you will make you feel better about life<br>  * Books can do wonders in teaching you about things your parents didn't teach you; a library can be a great free resource center<br>  * Get a job if you can balance school and work; with the income it'll provide, you'll have the option to move out after you graduate<br>  * When you start college, go as far as away from home as you feel comfortable; you will feel better on your own, not to mention have tons more fun<br>  <br>  That's all I can say.  I've been in your situation, and turned out OK for the most part, although there are things I'm still getting over.  I hope everything works out for you.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	You need to learn everything you can, for your survival. I was in the same situation growing up, my parents weren't a part of my life. My biggest regret is that it left me not knowing a lot of important things about life and it's harder to figure things out on your own. So yes do well in school, but ask questions and learn from your parents and other people whenever you can.|`|5IkZ64aFaa	Living in a situation as you describe is difficult.  Have you tried to talk to your parents and let them know how you really feel?  Tell them specifically how you feel when they are not at your games.  If you feel you can not say this to them, consider writing it down in a letter form.  Sometimes it is easy for kids to think that their parents are not in their life due to busy work schedules, but the simple fact is, in your situation, they are neglecting you if they are not concerned with what is happening in your life.    <br>  You mention you are part of the football team and wrestling team.  Is there a possibility you can talk to one of your coaches?  Or is there any other adult that you trust you can talk to?  Seek this support for yourself is a good idea.  Focus on the good decisions you have made for yourself: team sports, going to school, etc.  Make sure you maintain good grades, as your grades reflect you and your future success--not your parents.  <br>  If you need someone to talk to, please consider calling the Boys Town National Hotline at 1-800-448-3000.  We have counselors available 24/7 and can offer you support and guidance.  It may help to talk to someone.  <br>  Take care, Counselor KJ|`|fc4NOCp3aa	I'm so sorry to hear about your situation.  It's sad that not all kids who are born, get born into loving situations with parents who love & care for their kids.  Yes, a first step is definitely to focus on your studies because that's the surest path to success, freedom and independence.  It's true that money can't buy you happiness but what it does buy is CHOICES.  Right now, you have to live with your parents because, let's face it, most kids don't hae the income to rent a place of their own, pay bills, cover health insurance, or medical things, etc.  Money does all of that.  So focus on what you'd like to become when you grow up.  The sky is the limit when you push yourself, believe in yourself, and work really really hard.  Then, when you' can stand on your own, you won't need your parents.  I fear that you'll fall into the trap that many kids do in your situation.  That is....going on to try to find love & approval from other not-so-great places because you're not getting that love & approval at home.  I hope you'll be stronger than that.|`|FI8aMuAGaa	I've been there.  You do the best you can.  Just make sure you go to college so you will never have to rely on anyone ever again.  And don't try to take time off after school, time flies too quickly.|`|vEv2YwWdaa	Try to make the right choices.  You will be OK.  Do the best you can.

VSVQHKwKaa	Ok,<br>  <br>  Here is what you do:<br>  <br>  1) Just before the argument begins, ask yourself:<br>  <br>  "Is this the hill I want to die on?"<br>  <br>  In other words, make a RATIONAL decision if the argument is worth having in the first place (btw...95% of the time...arguments are about meanless nonsense). <br>  <br>  2) Never ever ever ever argue over the phone. Arguing over the phone depersonalizes it, dehumanizes it, and makes it easy to be greedy and cruel. <br>  <br>  So if you must have an argument, have it in person. The phrase "Well, lets talk about that tonight. I'm still unsure." works great! <br>  <br>  If it's not important enough to talk about later...then it probably wasn't worth arguing about in the first place.<br>  <br>  3) When you argue, I want you to SIT next to him. By SITTING, you're demonstrating a) that you're on his side, you're his partner, his wife, the love of his life and b) you're not emotionally bombastic. It's hard to yell sitting down.<br>  <br>  4) I want you to TOUCH him. TOUCHING him communicates "Hey! It's Me! It's your wife! It's the woman who is allowed to touch you! I'm not just some crazy broad on a PMS bender. I'm your loving wife!"<br>  <br>  This will calm him down, keep both your voices in check, and reaffirm the bond between you. It's hard to yell at someone who is touching your shoulder.<br>  <br>  5) ASK to have your way. <br>  <br>  In other words, don't try to CONVINCE him that you're RIGHT RIGHT OH SO RIGHT I"M RIGHT AND YOU"RE WRRROOONNGG!!!<br>  <br>  Ask him to have your way. Ask him.<br>  <br>  "Honey, could you please pick up your shoes at the door when you come inside. It really means a lot to me that the doorway is clear. I'd really appreciate it."<br>  <br>  You're much more likely to get your way, if, instead of brow-beating your man, you GIVE him the ability to be CHARITABLE with you.<br>  <br>  You win: You've gotten your way.<br>  <br>  He wins: You're grateful and happy that he gave you your way.<br>  <br>  Both win!!<br>  <br>  The voice thing is a defense mechanism. The goal here is to avoid activating it. Because when you have, he's in "Battle-mode". And men don't take prisoners in "Battle-mode".<br>  <br>  By the way, sometimes, he WON"T grant you your way. He'll stand on his principles. He won't budge.<br>  <br>  When this happens, you just have to accept it.However, you'll quickly find this is the exception. Generally men want a happy wife more than they want most things.  And the better you accept this, the more often he'll WANT to give you your way. <br>  <br>  That's how you solve the larger issue behind this problem. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|FXCoGD44aa	It's not just your husband that doesn't know how to handle arguments - it's you too. Here's some argument "training wheels" you can try:<br>  <br>  1. Set rules of your arguments when you are not arguing that you can both stick to. Rules such as no voice raising, no interrupting, no insulting, no name calling, no belittling, no walking away, no veering off topic, etc. If you have to, write them down.<br>  <br>  2. Have a "talking stick." This can be anything object, from a book to the remote control. Only the person who is holding this object can talk, period. When you're done, pass it to your partner and listen while only he talks. I don't recommend time limits for how long a partner has the talking stick, but some couples need them.<br>  <br>  3. Instead of having the goal of winning the argument, make your goal to be to resolve the issue, find common ground and a solution that works for both of you. If this isn't your goal, then your objective is for you to "win" and your spouse to "lose".<br>  <br>  Try that. I bet it will work better for both of you.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	So he continues to tell you that you're shouting even when you're whispering? (Which would annoy the hell out of me, by the way. Can you talk in a normal tone?) Maybe he is just nonconfrontational. If he starts accusing you of something like yelling, just calmly say, "You're right, I'm sorry. I won't yell anymore," or call him out (Calmly) on changing the subject.|`|uO0NW2nZaa	it typical and normal for men to go into shutdown mode when there is arguments|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	you both need to control your anger..have a time out when things get heated between you both. try marriage counseling|`|AA11785285	Yes, a few.<br>  <br>  First stop fighting.  <br>  <br>  Obviously neither of you were raised in a family that resolved issues without rage and resentment, and this is what you still are looking to do...<br>  <br>  "Does anyone have a comeback?" screams that you are still in a fighting mode...wrong, hon, acid all over your marriage.<br>  <br>  Hon, you don't WANT a comeback----- you wish the issue discussed, and concluded so that both of you are satisfied.  This isn't what you are ever going to get, looking for a "comeback'><br>  <br>  From this posting you are attacking each other, rather than the problem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  There is a whole lot of difference between: <br>  "Goddamn it George.

Shii(ttt), can't you just pick up after yourself, just once?"<br>  <br>  and:<br>  "I'm hoping you like a clean kitchen as well as I do, but with our equally busy schedules, it ain't happenin'.  Do you think this weekend we could sit down and make a list, or find some sort of  way that we both can enjoy that room being a bit cleaner?"<br>  <br>  In this first, you are attacking him, insulting him and it is all his fault (It may be, but blasting away isn't going to get you your goal....a clean kitchen).<br>  <br>  In the second, you claim responsibility for part of the mess (your lack of time) and as well, claim some of the cure.<br>  <br>  1.  There was a great book written years ago.... likely still cheap, <$3.00 in paperback at Amazon, called The Assertive Option.  Some of the examples are dated, but the idea is there.  Surely saving your relationship is worth $3.00?????????????????????  <br>  <br>  2.  And as well, get an hour of counseling, and ask the counselor to help you with language to get your issues resolved.<br>  Hon, both of you need an attitude adjustment.<br>  <br>  It is not him who is strange, nor is it you.  It is lack of each of you never learning to solve problems together.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	If you are going to argue never do it over the phone, don't raise your voice, and don't get going in public. If you absolutely have no way around an argument then do it in the privacy of your home without anybody (including kids) having to listen to it. Pay attention to how you argue too, and not just how he argues. Again arguments are not for public or the phone. If he starts an argument on the phone simply say "We will need to discuss this when we both get home." If you argue a lot then maybe it is time to seek counseling to help both of you be more constructive instead of destructive.|`|68lLAQnKaa	it is not strange behavior, remember that you guys are on the same team, not in competition, perhaps you should step back and examine where you are wrong,  I am sure he's been wrong plenty, but you have to know that you have been wrong too, humility is key, also a soft answer turns away wrath.  Be a supportive wife. don't nag at him.  let him be and learn to love him regardless of his inability to argue with you... LOVE HIM, apologize for where you have been wrong and don't be an accuser, give him the benefit of the doubt from time to time.|`|ysUqQ9Qkaa	It souds to me like you're the one who doesn't know how to resolve arguments.  If every argument you engage in he tells you to stop yelling and you keep yelling he is ending the argument in the best way he can.  If you can only yell at him to be effective in the argument I'd say the fault lies with you.  I live with a couple, the girl is the same way, nearly every argument with her with either her boyfriend or myself ends with us telling her to quit yelling.  We've both requested numerous times that she not yell during arguments but she claims we don't listen to her and starts in with the yelling . . . then we start ignoring her because as stated we will not try to talk to her when she's yelling.  So her yelling fulfills the prophecy of us not listening to her.  If you went about talking rather than yelling you'd probably find it worked a lot better.|`|mQ8e5jZnaa	lol, thats a hard one,  seems like he doesn't want to listen, so you feel the need to make him hear you.  This is why we yell.  Another reason is that we are trying to get our point across and get everything out before the other can react, so you don't forget to tell him.  maybe a face to face conversation is better.  My ex and I used to fight but we'd meet face to face, we tend not to yell when we are face to face as much.  We  stopped doing that and f ought  on the computer or on the phone and our relationship ended, so don't let that happen!|`|5QRIWopSaa	Read "The Care and Feeding of Husbands" by Dr. Laura Schlessinger<br>  And give him "The Care and Feeding of Wives" by her as well.<br>  <br>  You could also call into her show, and ask her. 1-888-DRLAURA<br>  I listen to her radio show every day.|`|LQISGYbEaa	I suggest you accept him the way he is and stop fighting with him.|`|vx9DNum6aa	both of u need to learn the differance btween a fight and a person throwin a fit

They destroyed my last marriage and some past releysionships and today i have been married for 10 years and i'm not letting this women go<br>  So i had to do the most difficult thing to save my marriage and that was to cut off all ties to my parents.<br>  My mum was so cruel  we lost our daughter to leukimia and my mum still was being horrible to me and my wife so i kicked her out it had to be done i did leave it a litle too late but better late than never.<br>  I dont want to get all religious but here is some good advice for your husbane take it or leave it<br>  It states in the Bible that when a man marries a women he leaves his mother and father to become one with his wife now biblically this is your husbans priority pecking order<br>  <br>  Husbane:<br>  God comes 1st<br>  You second<br>  Children(if you have any) third<br>  others(eg. family friends)third<br>  Husbane Last<br>  <br>  Your husbane is the head of the house he should beprotecting his family(wife) against anything that tries to hurt his family that is his 1st and foremost responsibility not yours<br>  Even if it was your parents causing the trouble it is still your Husbanes duty to protect your family(you)<br>  make no mistake about this<br>  Since i learned this my marriage has been so blessed and stringer than ever <br>  For your Husbane it will be very difficult but worth it and if he also agrees that his parents are nuts then nicely tell him to grow some balls and sort it out<br>  Because i left things so long My wife gave me and ultimatum either it's them or me(you know what i mean)<br>  I didnt like what i had to do because love for ones parents is unconditional but it's something if ididnt do it i would lose my wife and children so i had to be cruel to be kind and cutt my parents off. Yes i was sad but it saved my marriage which i am truely greatful|`|EjyD1sXeaa	your in-laws sound disgusting, I would move away from them as far as possible so they can no longer be in your lives and influence the baby.<br>  congratulations on the baby by the way|`|AA10478980	Your situation is a complicated one, but I would not recommend avoiding them completely.  My own mother was much like your inlaws, but I didn't keep my children away from her.  Consider that they raised your husband, and he turned out well, so they cannot be totally bad.  Be upfront with them and let them know that you and your husband will not tolerate bad behavior in front of your child, but they are the grandparents, and your child has a right to have his grandparents in his life.  There is no other relationship quite as special as that between a grandparent and a grandchild.  In terms of the baby shower, if you really cannot tolerate having them there, then have a separate shower or event where you invite them.  Take the high road with this one, and someday you may be glad you did.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	Yes i would i also have there comment to threaten to kidnap your baby and the rest recorded with a lawyer even the police you could get a order. these people are evil and very cruel,if it was at all possible job wise i move so far away they never get to see the kid grow up as they not stop as there nuts<br>  Your husband and you need to stand together and stick to what you have agreed, and no way invite them to a baby shower I never let them in my house)|`|a402885910549caddf0eb474b891f438aa	BAby or no baby, you should completely avoid them.

Wimpy men who let their wives tell them what to do, plan their weekends for them, make them take care of the kids cause' they had "one of those days", or anything of that should have their @ss whipped and their man card pulled.

My wife and I had to buy both when her family started trying to poison our relationship before we got married. Here they are:<br>  <br>  Toxic Inlaws:<br>  Toxic in-laws come in a variety of guises. There's the Critic, who can't wait to tell you what you're doing wrong: the Controller, who tries to run your life; the Engulfer, who makes constant demands on your time; and the Master of Chaos, whose numerous problems inevitably end up in your lap. If you're suffering from these or from any other type of infuriating in-laws, your frustration is likely affecting your relationship with your spouse. This remarkable book will help.<br>  <br>  With equal doses of understanding and advice, Susan Forward helps you navigate the treacherous waters of toxic in-laws. She explains the unique complexities of the in-law problem, a triangle that forces you and your spouse into a tug-of-war of loyalty and support. She shows how in-laws often manipulate their children to get what they want, and helps you understand the difficulties this poses for your partner.<br>  <br>  Drawing from real-life stories of men and women struggling to free themselves from their in-laws' destructive behavior, Forward offers highly effective strategies for getting your partner to stand up for you, for setting reasonable limits, and, most importantly, for protecting your marriage. Her techniques and strategies may not transform your toxic in-laws into the in-laws of your dreams, but they will help you maintain your sanity, self-respect, and, best of all, your relationship with the person with whom you've chosen to share your life. <br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  Toxic Parents:<br>  All parents fall short from time to time. But Susan Forward pulls no punches when it comes to those whose deficiencies cripple their children emotionally. Her brisk, unreserved guide to overcoming the stultifying agony of parental manipulation--from power trips to guilt trips and all other killers of self worth--will help deal with the pain of childhood and move beyond the frustrating relationship patterns learned at home.

WEekT4b6aa	Well, girl, you hit him with one brick, and then you hit him with another one when he asked for honesty.  <br>  <br>  Your first comment was that you like him in your paragraph above. <br>  <br>  You gave yourself a black-eye when you said it wasn't true because you stupidly let yourself be embarassed that some stupid guy told him that you liked him.  Lying ruins your credibility.  That's the black eye. <br>  <br>  So when he called you out on your lie, and told you it would have been better to be honest, you go overboard the other way and tell him he's "hot".  I agree with him.  He needed an honest answer in the first place and not an overboard, I can't live without you because you're so hot type answer.  <br>  <br>  I think he thinks your a liar and stupid.  You've shot yourself in the foot.  He has every right to get po'd at you for lying to him, and then for going overboard.  Leave him alone.  I think if you don't push him any, he might give you another chance.  If not, hopefully you've learned a lession and won't lie next time.  That was just plain dumb.

By denying that you liked him, you offended him. It probably hurt his feelings a little bit. But it didn't mean he liked it...it just mean you kind of offended him. So then when you said bluntly that you thought he was hot....it kind of caught him off-guard. I'm sorry hunn but if he liked you back, he would have flirted back or made a move. Guys are confusing sometimes....I hope I helped.<br>  you can do better hunn =)|`|oyjP2mZBaa	He doesn't like you.<br>  He would have liked it if you had said you thought he was hot.<br>  Or maybe he does like you...<br>  and that's why he got kinda touchy when you said you didn't like him.<br>  He didn't want to hear it.<br>  And he got kind of freaked when you said you thought he was hot.<br>  I'm sorry, but this guy is kind of confusing...mixed signals.|`|dd7dc75ce0c863c0c9da46c01ffc1d2daa	his confidence probably boosted when he heard that a girl liked him. and then you disappointed him. and when you called him hot, maybe he doesn't like that word. how would you like it if a guy called you hot but didn't like you? maybe apologize to him and say maybe i do like you maybe i don't. you'll just have to figure that one on your own. be mysterious =] guys like a fun challenge lol|`|nd5w7v4saa	No, i don't think so.<br>  <br>  But, i think you were put in a tricky situation, <br>  He probably said whats so wrong with liking me, because he may have gotten offended.<br>  <br>  I'd say its a no.|`|xyW8PsfUaa	I dont think so. or maybe he does and he's just weird like...

Brush your teeth, become preppy, stop being a goth freak, work out, lose weight, get nice hair, put on less makeup but spend more time on it, paint ur nails pink or red or clear, instead of black... get rid of any acne using proactiv or even accutane, if it comes to that... if you have constant allergy problems, go get allergy shots once a week, talk to ur doc about that.... if you're too white, play sports outside, and get a tan once in awhile... be upbeat, sexy, funny, confident, and happy (and DONT BE sad, depressed, "i will set you ablaze", angry, unconfident, or quiet!), etc!<br>  <br>  See?  Self improvement is just a check-list away!  Sorry about the sobering truth, but I'm NOT going to lie to you, cuz I know everything, and I never get things wrong or say lies... But on the OTHER HAND, my knowledge transcends merely insulting you with painful truths; I also delved into some things that can help you out.  <br>  <br>  If you do them, and ALL of them, you should be good to go! =)|`|qFjCHxCSaa	A similar situation happened to me a while  ago.

It is most likely the first one.|`|JWbwcqUXaa	Haha, wow you are bringing way to much drama into the situation.

Cyw2caaoaa	I think something personalized with his name would be a great gift, but you'd want it to be something that he's got an interest in.<br>  <br>  For that age you could probably look at regular groomsman gift options and just find something that is good for a 12 year old.<br>  <br>  This site has some interesting sports related signs that could be put up in his room (if he likes any sports).<br>  <a href="http://www.mygowns.com/groomsman-gifts.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mygowns.com/groomsman-gifts.h...</a>|`|9kgYFEbOaa	We have a sr. ringbearer lol...and for his gift we got him basball showcase things from The Land Of Nod website.

They are just cute red little platforms.|`|JrVhTyLdaa	My two best ideas are an engraved baseball with his name and the date of your ceremony on it, or an engraved mug with his name or initials.

Or to the monster trucks, I bet he would be thrilled to get a gift like that!! <br>  Does he have an Xbox or playstation? What about a video and game rental store gift certificate? And maybe a gift certificate to a local pizza joint, or movie passes for him and a friend, famous players has those cards and they include a movie, two pops and one large popcorn for sharing.<br>  Although I do think boys appreciate cars, and toys and stuff, but I think giving him something he can go and use would be so much more beneficial then him playing with something for a couple days and then forgetting about it.|`|mQSk7fB6aa	For a boy that age, a good-quality replica model car is a great idea, perhaps even engraved someway.  That way it would be something to keep and cherish.

However since she is your daughter and you are the adult here, for her sake you do need to establish some kind of relationship with her.  Try mixing up the time by spending some of the time with your family and some of the time with her or bring along one of your other children and see what happens.  You can also try doing things that you enjoy even if she doesn't and vice versa.  It can be helpful for her to see you doing something you enjoy even if she doesn't unless she makes it absolutely miserable for you while you are doing it, then don't.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you can love someone but not like them much.  For her sake and because of your love for her, try to get along the best that you can.  The harder that you try, the better that you will feel if you know that you gave her your best even if you are never able to get to a point where you like her.  She is your daughter.|`|9zM6QFEOaa	you don't like your 12yr. old cuz you abanned her. and you feel guilty.<br>  but she doesn't know that you abandded her, not yet anyway, but if you quit hangging out with her she will figure it out, and that will cause her alot of emotional strane in her       life she will always think that you don't love her.and that she is a loser.<br>  <br>  what you need to do is realize what you are doing, she is not gonna be little forever. and there is no gaurannttee that your 2nd marriage won't break. or you won't become a widowwer, and i hope that never happens, but if it does those adopted kids are gonna grow up and leave you, but you know what that 12yr old never will say thats not my real dad. or  stop wanting to care about you.<br>  <br>  so find out how you and her can click together<br>  if something was to happen to you right now your ex your wife and your adopted kids could turn there backs on you but that beautiful little 12yr. old daughter of yours would stand up for her dad. unless you abannden her again. good luck!|`|ApXbe2EWaa	You didn't mention the ways you are trying to bond more with her, so I'm assuming you haven't tried to. Try doing something new with her, something neither of you have done before... horseback riding, rock climbing... or teach her something new that you're good at, maybe fishing, golfing, boating... teach her a new skill. Go camping where you can all of these things. Listen to her and find out her interests... she can teach you something new, too. Take her to the movies and let her pick out any movie she wants, and watch it with her. If you're not enjoying it, don't let it show... just make her feel you're enjoying being with her. I worry she may be picking up on your feelings and I can only imagine how that is making her feel. You can fix things. Switch up visitations every once in awhile, it doesn't have to always be on the weekend... tell her you're going to pick her up on a specific weeknight and take her out to dinner and a movie. Prepare topics to talk about beforehand... bring her a gift certificate to a CD store and give it to her at dinner and say she can pick out a CD after you're finished eating because you're not sure "what kids listen to these days", and that could start up a whole topic about music when you were younger.<br>  <br>  Just relax and enjoy eachother's company.|`|CaG5qOJWaa	Well, from what i have seen in my friends' marriage, I am going to try to help you the best that I can. I had a friend that remarried and she was in the same situation that you find your self in. She had a 12 year old son from a previous marriage and felt that he was being very annoying, did not want to listen to her or her present husband. She would always ask me "is it bad that I just can't stand my son sometimes?" I couldn't understand either, why he was acting that way until  when I caught her son off guard one day and asked him " why do you seem to act as if you don't want to be with your mom sometimes, why do you act so bad with her?" Out of shock, he answered my question, with tears in his eyes. "I know, I love my mom a lot, but my daddy said that I have to be like that," and that he had to behave that way because if he didn't he was not going to be grounded. I mean, its sad to say but maybe, just maybe, your step daughter is being put up to it. I just thought I will answer your question by telling you about one of my friends' past experience.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Find things that will occupy her time wail she is with you know video games etc.. give her things that will make her happy and you happy.For my self both of my children had ever thing when they were at the age of 10 they had cable in there room DVD and many movies VHS and many movies big 32 inch TVS, X Box and games  PLAYSTATION and games, N64 and games, etc and this kept my children happy all the time. They always had something to do with there time instead of complaining that there is nothing to do .try it and you will see a big change in your daughter, and it will bring Joy into your life trust me.|`|oGbHyZR8aa	You should seek counseling.

My dad has never even said one word to me he left before i was born. and he told my mom it was a mistake having sex with her because it evolved into a baby now im 14 with no clue who my dad even is; and i feel like its my fault. so just talk to your daughter|`|FBhjhjR0aa	That breaks my heart. Honestly I think you dis-like your 12 year olds mother so much that you can't seperate your feelings from your daughter and your ex. But that's not fair to your 12 year old. Every little girl needs her daddy in her life. You play a VERY important role in her life, and in her life as an adult. You will be the man that she looks for in every man that she dates. Please please, don't push her away.... <br>  <br>  Just because you can't stand her mother doesn't mean that she is her mother. She's also part of you! Maybe if you spend more time with her, her personality will start to reflect you a little more than right now. I would assume since she lives with her mom, that she's reflecting her mothers personality right now, and that's another reason why you have a hard time enjoying her being around.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Tell your wife that you prefer to be with  your present children and that you will see your biological daugther only when she wants to see you. <br>  She is being a teenager and yeah I can understand. <br>  But she may feel the same way about you. Tell your wife you need time with the present family the teen probably would rather be hanging out with her friends anyways. Check in from time to time a phone call maybe all she needs right now. She will let  you know if she needs to be with you more but give her that opportunity to say it.  I really don't think  your ex or your wife should be telling you what to do.. its her choice.|`|Zu7GJeU4aa	The answer is because she is twelve ride it out she will be a joy when she is over the teenage thing|`|YTasscmKaa	I think you may be projecting some of your anger toward your ex on this girl.

She is the cornerstone of the family and therefore is critical in the whole process of nation and world building.<br>  <br>   The Holy Qur’an says and Bible says, “Men are the maintainers of women.” It is the natural role of a man to work hard and produce what is necessary to maintain a woman and the children that are produced from that woman. As a maintainer, he is a protector, ( provider), and he is supposed to guide. <br>  <br>  Since, the womb of our mother is sacred, then, this teaches us that the womb of every female is also sacred, for it is from her womb that all the Scientists, Prophets, Sages, Messengers, Kings, Rulers and Gods have come and will come.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Honey...12 is a difficult age.  My son is almost 12 and he's not as cute and adorable as he was when he was 3, let me tell you that!  Right now, you're in the cute stage with your wife and younger kids.  You may also feel a tad of resentment because your 12 year old may remind you of your ex-wife.  I sometimes feel that way too.  My son will do or say something and it's like, "AUGH!  YOU SOUND LIKE YOUR DAD!"  I don't say that...but I think it.  Right now it's really important to make her feel good about herself.  You don't want her making the mistake of "daddy didn't love me as much as I wanted him too, so I'll find it in these young boys."  See what I'm saying?  Girls that don't  have their fathers affections are more likely to be permiscuous, etc.  Just do the best you can.  Set aside time ALONE with her.  Even if it's just lunch between the two of you.  Ask your current wife for help too. I'm sure she's a good woman who will be more than willing to help out and understand.  Good luck to you.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Rebekah0...Nice language.

aDhZIhQcaa	I was in exactly the same situation about 25 years ago.  I had 4 children and felt lost, with a husband that was a great father but a lousy husband.  I realized that I had "married" my mother.  I was a great wife, but realized that I was trying to win my ex's approval just like I did growing up with my mother.  So I left.  I got a job, enrolled in college to become a nurse, all the while having to raise my children.  I never got child support, never borrowed money, but I made it!  I survived!  And that set an example to all of my children.  Than anyone can rise above difficulty.  Your life is what YOU make it.  It is not up to anyone else to do it for you.  Of course you are unhappy, you feel lost.  You go and find yourself, girl.  Learn to love yourself and not seek approval from anyone other than yourself.  The rest will follow.  And now a days, there are all kinds of programs to help you better your life, alot more than I was able to get.  So if I can do it, I know you can.  God bless you and good luck|`|MYU46ap5aa	Because you need to find yourself.  You need to find something to make you happy and find your way in life.  Have you considered going back to school.  It can help you socaily as well.  You went from one situation to another.|`|mBXu5G5saa	Well first of all let me start by saying you are not being selfish! Sometimes life itself is hard and it is up to you to be strong through both rough and solid times, there is absolutely no perfect relationship out there, no matter if it is husband-wife, boyfriend-girlfriend, or brother-sister, no one is perfect, everyone needs help at some point but what i want to say is that you seem to be a very loving and caring mother and there is nothing wrong with that, you are still young and wanting a career is also tough when you have children, You cannot just do everything on your own and expect it to be all nice and great, you need support and to get to that point you have to struggle, but the outcome is always positive you need support from as many people as you can get, especially your family, and I must say that it is very sad that your husband does not support you to do want you want or to be what you want, this is the duty of a husband/father and you need to sit down with him and talk things over, before your marriage is over without you even realizing it! if he needs to get a second job, or whatever to get a babysitter or a nanny to come into your home to watch the children while you try to get into your career, then let it be, you both need to make some changes in your life and marriage to better yourself and these three lovely children, and to also save your marriage, eventhough things are a bit rough and crazy right now that does not mean it will be like this forever, only if you let it, it will remain that way, so i suggest that you have a long talk with your husband, and see where things go, I wish you the best in all your endeavours and good luck!|`|Gy9kt139aa	You're not being selfish at all. You are simply experiencing the feelings every person your age does (discovering who you are and what you want out of life), except 25 year olds aren't usually married with three kids; they have the freedom to change their lives whenever they want.<br>  <br>  I completely respect you for wanting to stay in the relationship, but it sounds like you need something you're not finding there. Maybe it's time to get a divorce or at least take a break. Maybe you should explain to your husband that you waited for a year and a half so he could pursue his career, and now you want your turn. Having passion for your career is so important and so overlooked today, but it is a huge key to being happy. <br>  <br>  If your husband cares at all for you, he will respect your decision to try and pursue your dreams. It will make you both happier in the long run, and you'll be better able to support your kids.
Wqqoo0IZaa	You're the rebound guy, at the moment. Don't fall into that trap, man. You'll live to regret it. Let her go, either she'll come crawling to you after she's gotten over her ex, or you can let her have some other poor sap who will be the rebound guy.<br>  <br>  Just to give you more info on the rebound guy: He's the one who the girl falls for immediately after she's broken up with her ex, and she cannot get over her ex, so he is there for support physically, sexually, emotionally.  Problem with this is if you're into her for more than just sex and someone to support you, you'll soon face the realization that she's still thinking about her ex the entire time, and that you're a sort of ghost-replacement of her ex. Either you're very similar to her ex, or you're the entire opposite (based on how their relationship ended). Either way, it's best not to go for such an adventure.<br>  <br>  This is information I gathered not from a personal anecdote, but rather a couple of my homegirls who ended up breaking up with their current boyfriends because they realized that they were just rebound guys...|`|3eIuXzrAaa	I can totally relate to your situation. I met this girl at a school related conference... She lives very far from where i liveu, so we kept contact over the internet. Everything worked out so well, she visited me just a week ago and we had a great week together... but she told me that we should just be friends... she also kept mentioning her EX and how she couldn't forget about him... I've decided that there's not much I can do about it... she's invited me to visit her in the summer, I think I'll do so, but the fact that she just wanted to be friends kind of, blew it for me :S...<br>  <br>  I think its best just to leave her to think it over...<br>  Its probably same with your girl... perhaps she had a rough time with her EX and is still getting over the fact that she liked him, part of her probably loves him... still...<br>  <br>  I know it hurts, but I think girls just need time to think things through... and I'm sure friends between you and her just means friends for the mean time... friends can always turn into something more "serious"...<br>  <br>  From what I've read... it looks like the two of you have a better chance than me and this conference girl, just don't give up, but remember to leave her some space... If she doesn't come back for you, then perhaps its not worth it... IDK, but be subtle about it, and be patient as well, you need to give her time.|`|UwHMNHVZaa	Dump her.

If a girl still has feelings for her ex then its pretty dangerous. She may be acting really hot and cold because she's on the rebound. She wants someone to care for her... but she still hopes things will work out with her ex. My advice: I would give her time. She may flake out on you if you try to pursue things right now. So avoid the heartache, and just find a girl who hasn't had a bf for a while.|`|6oSm5Qxzaa	I think you should just move on. Obviously you guys are too attached so move on before you get hurt. She sounds like she isn't ready to commit and still isn't over her ex but wants you there in order to have someone to hang out with and fall back on. You shouldn't be that guy, especially since she is just someone you met online. Get out now before you get hurt, unless you just want to hang out with her in order to get sex, cause it sounds like you may be able to.
t4DP30r6aa	I'm not sure why people say wait until marriage. Except that it is religious beliefs and safer when talking about accidental pregnancies and STD's. The unfortunate thing is condoms break and accidents happen. The only safe sex is no sex as the saying goes.  Seems that in this day in age that is somewhat unrealistic, especially in the professional world where many people don't get married until late 20's. (after they are stable in their careers). That would suck to wait that long. I think knowing when your ready for sex is different for everyone. It's a maturity thing.|`|vHxauOyeaa	Just be safe. that is all. <br>  I am religious, but I'm pretty sure 90% of america trys before they buy... you know?<br>  <br>  if I had to put an age restriction on it, I think 16 is acceptable by law haha, 17-19 is preferable<br>  <br>  and seriously, you are right, I know a bunch of these religious zealots who have no clue what the hell they are talking about. <br>  <br>  to them fun is a sin. and sins make you go to hell. <br>  according to them. <br>  <br>  But they haven't read closely enough : <br>  You will stand before God and be judged individually and asked to repent one last time for your sins and there are some people according to this doctrine of christianity that would be honest enough to say they have no remorse or regret for what evil they have done. <br>  Those people will go to hell (if there is one.) <br>  <br>  A lot of religion sounds like behavioral control to me sometimes, so I follow my own path now.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I agree, those answers are so far off base its not even funny. I try my best to give the person my opinion without preaching or telling them what I think they should do. If I can't give an answer without being judgmental or opinionated  then I won't leave one.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	i believe that people shouldn't listen to others opinions on such personal matters and do what they feel is right for them. it's as easy as that.|`|NWwGl4k6aa	...and what the hell does birds and bees have to do with it.  for most of my adolescent jears, i was going in the woods when i got horny.|`|4jW455dgaa	Wait till marriage|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	If U feel your ready and not to young, Its ok|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	It's not realistic to wait until your married, good for you if you can and want to though.  I don't think you'll be damned for having sex before marriage; I think you'll be damned if you don't believe in the forgiveness of sin.|`|RCfc9hMKaa	Wait 'til marriage, damn it.

Like birth control and condoms. There are things you can use to prevent pregnancy. There's even a emergency contraception. Not that it should be use all the time but as a back up just in case. I'm religious too and I don't think your going to hell. One thing I would advise is I waited till my late teens to do that. I think doing that between 15-17 is a little on the young side but that is my opinion. We're humans its in a nature to have desires like that and to act on them is not a big deal as long as your safe about it and that your older and mature. Hope that helps. Good luck.|`|FhrCLLzFaa	I really believe that you're completely right.<br>  If you found someone that you know that <br>  you're in love with [even if older people say <br>  that you're too young to know what love is,<br>  which is complete ****] then you know <br>  when you are ready to have sex. As long <br>  as you use the right protection and you <br>  approach it in a mature way then you<br>  won't go to hell for having sex!<br>  <br>  Edit: and also half of the adults that say "wait till marriage"<br>  didn't wait till marriage themselves. Talk about being a hypocrite.|`|w5F1hCdiaa	In my church we believe to wait until marriage. But i honestly believe it is your choice to do it.

KH3kbRjgaa	The human race has always been fascinated by selective breeding - from dogs (AKC) to the Hitler Youth (and the Arian breeding programs). I do not think looks will be that important - this time around.  They may try for the next genius or super soldier. I'm sure Nature will throw her curves at the "master race" (like she has done before - both physical and mental). Results were often mental retardation or physical deformities. Knowing the human race - it will probably be "try and try again". Too bad - a lot of souls may have to suffer for human vanity and pride ?<br>  <a href="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1568582587.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.amazon.com/images/P/156858...</a><br>  <a href="http://galeriekulturistiky.webz.cz/arnold/Arnold%2010.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://galeriekulturistiky.webz.cz/arnol...</a>|`|A2Ba5udyaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmE8O3dYx2ArC56peTM5aa2_7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090304141218AAtpn0O">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Please answer<br>  <br>  Sorry 4 spamming|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	Parents with money can buy all sorts of advantages for their children....Does it surprise you that they would buy good looks for their them as well?...Its so very American.|`|SMVsmzi4aa	yeah that's real smart, now watch the kid come out retarded.|`|L5I2tXvVaa	i actually want my child to look like me not like some perfect weirdo|`|XyD7tITxaa	Yeah, that is pretty wrong lol.

You could get you're grandparents and other adults into trouble. I'd advise you to stick them until you've turned 16.|`|LsE1RS0vaa	it is legal for your grandparents to take you in as long as your parents agree. but if you up and leave you could be considered a runaway. but since you are turning 16 i think the cops would probably not make you go back so soon since you are old enough to know what you want. besides it's your grandparents not some random neighbor or something.|`|EvIWKqpDaa	I would say yes since they are your parents and they could look at you leaving as a runaway. <br>  But why do you want to leave?

Don't beg to be roomies though, your dignity is much more important than this room with them.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't work ask other friends, not them, ask sam or meagan, but only one of them, and ask a couple others that maybe u arent extrememly close to, but its better than not having anyone and having someone have to place you.<br>  <br>   Hope this helps :)<br>  Have Fun!|`|lM9OwEiNaa	ooh, my school is doing that too !!!!!!!! so COoL (not for EVERY student though...)<br>  Well, its always a good thing to meet a new person, be roomies with someone you kinda know and are somewhat freinds, and hey, you might get another close friend!|`|i3AfWxjZaa	oh god this is scray...that happened to me...but on our phily trip...my two friends and their mom got a room and got to ride together in my friends car...i hate her now.. talk to one of the...one that will understand..dont sound like a baby though

Plenty of hot sweaty sex.|`|a6p6zaYFaa	my brother said that a guy looks mostly for a girl that is INDEPENDENT, and/or CONFIDENT, and/or SECURE, and/or NOT DESPERATE!!!|`|gnIEDg6maa	Don't pay attention to what the guys say.  I have been married 4 times and have had many proposals.  No kidding!  I stopped counting at 21 when I was in my early twenties.  They like to be loved. Cared about. Flattered. kissed up to. Tell them constantly how good looking they are, how nice, how much fun, etc.  Now comes the harder part.  Do not cling. Be independent. Do not let them push you around.  Make eye contact to let them know you are attracted and then retreat .  Look down but let them catch you looking at them. Never chase them. Don't be snotty or hateful. Be hard to get but then be faithful. Never cheat and don't put up with bullshit from them. Let them know you really like them but you can live without them.  All guys would like a girl that looks like a movie star but if you notice, the fat girls, the ugly girls and even the girls with bad personalities get guys.  Have sex only if you are so passionate about them you cannot do without.  Waiting will not hurt them and it is part of being hard to get.  When they finally get you, they will be so thrilled and proud of themselves. An easy to get girl is no challenge and not rewarding. Don't tease about sex, that is, don't pet and go as far as you can and then say 'No!" That can lead to rape. At your age, double date as much as possible  until you learn to handle guys. It is the only safe way to go. There is a lot more rape going on out there than you can possibly believe.   Guys know that you cannot pet and play and then go to the police when they finally rape you. So don't do it. Double date, flirt and have fun.|`|xxwb0sCdaa	Well if you want the hard cold truth unlike the other ones.<br>  <br>  BOOBS(no fat chicks.)<br>  BIG BUTTS(no fat chick butts please.)<br>  FACE(no bad faces)<br>  Personality(not annoying please)<br>  You must first start with this.(there are others)|`|ReaD6u4paa	it depend s on the guy.most of them look for sex.some who are more matur will look for a stable relationship based on trust,affection compassion.<br>  i like you a lot :)|`|Qe95LNxYaa	personality|`|JV5Ckfl4aa	The first think a guy sees in a girl is their body the first think i look at is boobs or butt but if u don'tt have those then u have to be funny and an open mind guys like to be phycial ok so kissing and grabbing are good the moresexuall u r the better but don'tt be a **** so do it with just him and be sexy about it guys like to be turned on ok|`|wegBosN3aa	wells I can answer this for the guys.

And you grow knowing yourself much better.|`|gG2CuoF8aa	Yes I am. :P<br>  And it probably is better than having a broken heart.|`|a1b7c4cf11e20d9d9f24ac54972174dbaa	Yes and unfortunately I have both. My boyfriend and I aren't close like we use to he's always working and I don't get to see him that often the fact that we're not close like we use to be breaks my heart and the fact that he's always busy makes my heart lonely.|`|9f8a58d970a66b4ecccc6e2320c54473aa	why you want to know?<br>  yes, at one point i was the owner of a (lonely, scared , broken, crusshed) heart. yes a lonely heart is better then a broken heart.<br>  i don't get it? a scare is better then a fracture and thats better then a broken.......hello............|`|VFdC2wPlaa	I think it is a lot better. My sister has a broken heart and she is crying and sad all the time. I'm just lonely... so it isn't so bad.

A broken heart needs a lot of time to heal over a guy. But a lonely heart isn't so bad.|`|oFoMI9okaa	I think a lonley heart would be better than the broken heart i have from a guy who i once thought had a honest, caring heart....|`|kNqS12qwaa	its better a broken heart can bring you mental and phyisical pain which is much worse then being lonely im alone but not lonely got my best friend lol single and loving it. be happy! :)|`|vn6jewrlaa	yup, i want a bf really bad but every1 tells me once i get 1 its really hard to be single afterwards|`|YjByj5UOaa	ya it's better to be alone than having a broken heart. so what do you say
yhQXJ8rbaa	haha well first off, congratulations for being on the list. :)<br>  <br>  your friend seriously overreacted, and you have done nothing wrong. i think she was probably jealous of you already, and knew you were 'hotter' but having it kinda put out there publicly probably pissed her off. girls can be catty and competative for guys' attention. <br>  <br>  to save your friendship, dont tell her any of the above. it'll hurt her pride. tell it it's just a stupid list made by a bunch of horny guys, and that if they made a top 10 hottest girls, she'd definetely end up on the list. and keep complimenting her about her looks. it'll make her feel better.
QS8urDOCaa	ok make sure you dont keep on trying to get her total attention if you stay away for a little bit she will start wondering y u arent ganging around with her and she will start to notice you more
uO0NW2nZaa	tell the court your living situation and also tell yoor mom how you feel and if that doesnt work tell family services|`|OtKCAeQZaa	It is between you and your mother for she has custody of you. Talk to her let her know what you want ,let her know that you love here and that you just want what makes you feel more comfortable concerning the roof over your head .|`|th7C1aoaaa	How old are you?
tT4zaIDUaa	U had no connetion means there was no spark there,, I think :0|`|aLLWID9xaa	Sorry Melissa, but if he told you that, the only meaning it has, is that he doesn't love you. Even when you've split up by a mutual decision, were together 9 months, and living hour and a half away by train, my answer is the same.<br>  There are many couples that live far away from the other, and they have "connection" because they're in love. That's not an excuse.<br>  Sorry again, I'd rather be sincere.<br>  Axel|`|YLxlFD6gaa	if there's no connection. then he doesn't see why you guys should be together. like he doesn't think you guys click anymore like you used too. he sees the relationship has pointless cause he doesn't see it going anywhere. <br>  <br>  or there is just someone else who is closer. :/|`|2zKBJkM8aa	"he feels we didnt have no connection"<br>  <br>  means...<br>  <br>  he felt no emotional connection with you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Pretty obvious, really.|`|FbK255c6aa	There could be a few things to that. he found someone else or he though you were his type but.. its turned out your not. its okay though it most likely mean he doesn't think your the person he thought you was.|`|HVqkJD83aa	It means that there's not that earth shattering tension and smoldering eye contact.|`|YGbiIxq4aa	you weren't putting out enough|`|cvhIAd6baa	That her just used you! i have been in your place dont go back|`|1oKardRKaa	usually when a guy comes to you with these lame excuses all they want to do is break up with a person. just the fact, that they dont want to say anything to you to make you feel bad. even if you try to make the best out of it he tries to back it down some way or another.  he could be interested in another person or could be talking to someone else at the time when he said that.  ask yourself questions on whether he is doing something that's not the usual, now it may seem as if there is cheating involved but most of the time that is not the case.  try not to "connect" with him and see if he still comes back to you. my advice: talk less and and start answering questions on what he does and what he feels toward you. hope this helps!!!!!!!!|`|epD0VxFkaa	That basicly means that he really had no feelings for you but he probly sayin that because hes mad....9 months is long but yep that means there was no strong feelings trust me i know i sed that before and that was because me and him had no chemisty there was no clicking no nothing so hope this helps...duces<br>  ----ebony----|`|nLhbxXwcaa	i think that it might have been hard for him or he isn't " in love" with you anymore and you should give him some time to think about everything, then try talking to him|`|7G9FDoinaa	Like the relantionship wasn't going anywhere.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  xoxo|`|pjrRbgnIaa	you basically answered your own Q. NO   CON-ECT-ION!!|`|B1GjfOUdaa	It just means there was no spark and nothing to keep yous together.|`|mBXu5G5saa	well he means the feelings were not there or you guys did not really have much in common|`|htNI5FEaaa	Basically, he wasn't feeling the whole "long-distance" thing.<br>  Maybe he's bored.<br>  It's a possibility that he wants to do something that he couldn't do while dating you.<br>  <br>  Either way, you have to get over it & realize you deserve way better.<br>  <br>  If you want to talk about it: AIM me @ aytaytay23.|`|5b11def76967d62059b5c3c3cba31cf2aa	Does he need to spell it out for you? There was no chemistry, no spark, you had little in common, he's not in love with you anymore, he got bored. All kinds of things...|`|71EwzPSlaa	that he didnt feel like you guys had anything going for eachother....like he felt there was no reason to stay....i mean its pretty simple really|`|ZxCK2vi9aa	He felt that the chemistry was wrong...
yhQXJ8rbaa	well he's obviously a dick and insecure about his relationship with 'Ashley' and probably has low self esteem. he probably thinks not a lot of girls like him, so he's putting you down to make himself feel like he's got more of a chance. <br>  <br>  ditch him and ask ashley out.|`|GGwOjodDaa	Dude go with your heart and dare him to ask her out to see if he really does have a chance|`|WvKDJmO0aa	ask her out first    show her a good time      tell her a sweet sappy story about how you've liked her for years       buy her things and get real close      be the first before your best friend is|`|fQ2wDlgNaa	Fight him for her|`|26hymEi2aa	young and very immature toward the subject. Ignore him, if he can bugs you mean gosh you can never have her. Build up your confident, a women always love a guys with confident. Not too much but at least a bit confident lol|`|ejrxNVD1aa	thats wrong man you are probably the bestfriend to her but honestly if you love her stick through it all if  he doesn,t fall in love it sounds like lust but you know he shouldn,t put you down like that and when they do break up later shes going to come to you and realize if youre the one for her then she is eventually going to come around and ya,ll will be with each other|`|Zc9dG012aa	Nope, not right at all. Friends definitely don't put their friends down.
120795afd4e1011681d5fd1a51b845a9aa	good luck with that|`|EjyD1sXeaa	disgusting, what will you look like when you're older - same goes for tattoos.<br>  cartilege in ears and noses can easily become infected and de-formed<br>  do you want to look like a bull with a ring through its nose???????|`|mbDp1IHuaa	when your 18 you don't need her permisson.<br>  listen to your mom she knows best.<br>  its not like you can't live without, seriousaly.|`|AXj4OnZBaa	Um there's not really a way to convince her of that, because parents don't really see it as "necessary" I think your best bet is either to wait until you're 18, or find someone over 18 to go with you to get it pierced, and just flip it up when you get home. My friend did that about 3 years ago, and her parents still have no idea.|`|yciJslC4aa	honestly as I guy I think your absolutely gorgeous. why would you ruin it by making yourself look like a cow with a bull ring? <br>  <br>  sorry but I agree with your mum on this one. whatever though, I'm all for people expressing themselves.<br>  <br>  your best bet is to try to bargain for it. say if I make all a's this semester or wash your car x amount of times. of course offer to pay. but good luck on this one lol. depending on the type of person she is, that'll be pretty tough to pull off!!|`|ANsznbWsaa	wait until you are 18.<br>  you can make your own decisions then.|`|ipln31mOaa	You're sixteen. You can do what you want to you're own body!<br>  You're bodys still growing right enough , and this could cause a few consequences. Its up to you though !<br>  Now to convince your mum ?<br>  It took me ages to convince my mum to get my belly pierced, thats my belly button haha.<br>  Just say to your mum , its you're body and you want it done. Just tell her everyone get's them done at you're age or younger, and you'll feel weird if its because your mum's not letting you.<br>  Do the guilt thing and just tell her how unfair it is, put on the tears ya know ? ... Just say " aw i thought uu were a cool mum " etc... it'' possiblyy work ? but who's to say it will :)|`|98z1KLLiaa	Im 14 and got my belly button pierced at a place which didn't ask for ID.<br>  <br>  Your 16 its your own body, explain to her that this is something you have thought about alot and that you would be quite happy if she lets you have it done, ask her would she rather you go behind your back and get it done?|`|fUZw0ZB0aa	depends the big horn ones or the small diamond one <br>  <br>  if the small diamond one just be like mom please its just a small one|`|qlrzr4mJaa	What the **** is septum??

e62f95518e0bb700635945c8033d6bceaa	I think that he is talking about making the future contact with you...superficial or very limited at best. Example: Refuse to attend Christmas, birthdays and so on. Another way to take it is emotional blackmail...do as I say or I don't want anything to do with you.<br>  <br>  You are 31 with a life of your own....ultimatums are useless unless you can back them up.|`|gRXy66dOaa	i would define when you're in a relationship for nothing more than personal gain.<br>  <br>  here are some examples of superficial relationship:<br>  <br>  Ryan is only going out with Cindy because she's the easiest girl in school.<br>  <br>  Pedro married Sarah to gain American Citizenship.<br>  <br>  all examples of superficial relationships.
AA11352641	I believe the rule of thumb is 1/3 expensive, 1/3 moderately priced, and 1/3 inexpensive. You're not twisting anyone's arm. Don't forget people will give you gift cards to go towards it just to skip the registry part altogether. For 315 guests and only 3 big ticket items, I certainly do think that's reasonable. I've seen some pretty ridiculous things on wedding registries, like sets of luggage for the whole family, expensive vacuums, etc. for couples who had already cohabited and set up house, had kids, and didn't have a wedding ceremony!|`|gFwD0yeCaa	I hardly consider those splurges. If your guests can't afford it they just won't buy it. My sister just had a baby and she had her crib, carseat and stroller on her registery. Her crib alone was around $700. She got a similar but cheaper version from our grandparents. I guess you could expect that too, for someone to buy a similar but cheaper version of what you asked for. Also people may buy what they think you'll need.|`|29I8PWrxaa	I don't think that's too bad ... I want that mixer too!  If you registered for mostly reasonable items under $100 then I think its just fine.  It's not like you registered for something for $1000!  There's a chance some guests may go in on a gift together in order to get you the mixer you really want.|`|gRZT4pnUaa	Register for anything and everything you need, or want. It's up to the person buying how much they want to spend. You might get lucky and rack up with everything you needed. Good Luck!|`|AA11380378	That is perfectly priced! Good for you for being sensitive to your guests budgets! Finally a bride with sense and manners!<br>  <br>  Congratulations and good luck|`|GvamTVqAaa	Put everything you want on there.  If people don't want to buy them, they won't.|`|AA11312653	As long as you also register for an unlimited number highly affordable items like kitchen towels and wash cloths as a courtesy to those with modest gifting budgets, then go ahead and register for the "dream" items. <br>  <br>  Hint: If you receive more washcloths than you can use in 4 lifetimes, then you can return them and exchange for things you are more in need of. Aunt Tilly will never know that HER washcloths were returned and those are Cousin Gert's identical washcloths in your bathroom.|`|bunAXlrXaa	i think it's fine<br>  if all the other items are under $100, people can most likely afford them<br>  i agree with the others, your guests can pool together, or you'll get a discount<br>  it's useless not putting it on the list, you won't get it for a gift, or a discount<br>  if there's only 3 more expensive gifts, i think that is fine<br>  i just don't think that people will buy the ipod dock because it's a luxury, but maybe they will<br>  good luck!!<br>  -14burks|`|kHUPZTn5aa	I don't think your registry is bad at all.  It has a range of prices for people to choose from.  I am so used to seeing people register at Crate and Barrel, Williams-Sonoma, and Tiffany's that it's a welcome sight to see people are being more practical and considerate.  <br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  I love pots and pans too but my brand is All-Clad.  Personally, I'd rather get this than any other kitchen appliance.  Congratulations!|`|p27jMTFuaa	I don't see any problem with it.  There will be some people who want to get more expensive stuff.  My fiance and I will be registering for some pricey items such as the mixer, pots and pans, and a video camera.  But we are also registering for a lot of inexpensive items as well (like some under $20) for those who can't afford a lot.|`|EetB3Jpyaa	Keep them all. We also had a Dyson vacuum cleaner (which was about 400 bux but so glad that we got after seeing how much dirt & dog hair it picks up) and Kitchenaid mixer (the one we had was 500 bux)...all of these items were bought by parents, siblings, and very close friends. If the guests don't want to spend that much, they will pick something else from your registry. Don't worry about it!|`|YqIVYBjTaa	Its reasonable.  We did Crate & Barrell, Bed Bath & Beyond and Macy's.  We put both inexpensive and expensive things.  Depending who you invite, you never know what you might receive.  The key is to not have an expectation that you will receive everything you ask for.  Enjoy.|`|5dd9437d2887d5800d393adb8a4b516faa	No way!  I registered for the mixer, $250 pots & $25 knives as well as $100 sheets.  Don't forget people spend a lot on weddings (way more than you think they will) and people also go in for joint gifts.<br>  <br>  You should have things in all price ranges including the most expensive!<br>  <br>  Check ours out on Bed, Bath & Beyond, search Molly Steinberg|`|4G6FFKrxaa	I honestly have seen much more expensive items, I really do not see the big deal with what you have chose.  Congrats!  Also some close family members are prone to buying a really big gift and giving it from 1 or 2 people for example a cousin or yours with your aunt etc.|`|SZdSFi1raa	I dont think so. Just make sure you have a wide range of prices. People can always go in on a gift together. For my oldest brothers wedding gift my other brother and I split the cost of one of the most expensive gifts on the registry.|`|IWWZdZRpaa	It's not bad as long as you have affordable stuff as well.  When we have weddings with people at work a lot of times we'll pitch in and get the couple one of the expensive items.  Not bad at all.|`|0BX1yFGuaa	That is not bad at all!  I would actually put a couple other "big ticket" items on the registry because many people like to go togther on a gift and purchase the larger items.<br>  <br>  I really think your registry is completely in line.|`|7vFylPygaa	yeah it's not that bad. it's your day! but it all depends on your idea of expensive. =P nothing over $1000. $500 at least. congratulations and best wishes!|`|44Sj3bsZaa	I dont think that is greedy! Just go for it girl~ ITs your wedding and those bigger priced items will be good for those people that want to go in on a present with others!|`|RuKK1LYiaa	no just dont hold your breath on getting them. i love the kitchenaid mixer as well and am hoping for that because it would help me at the holidays when i make my family's secret recipe of Chocolate pie and everyone loves it. as long as its stuff to make a home then people wont really look down on you, if its just stuff you want like cds or game consoles or stuff like that they might be a little offended but sounds like you have it all under control. no worries.|`|o72Ng7IRaa	I agree with your Mom 100%. Many people, when shopping for wedding gifts, will use your register items as a guide to purchase the items at their favorite stores or some where they can find things cheaper. Your downfall is, you may get several instances of the same gift becasue people DON'T shop from the registry and thus can't have it removed from view. As far as the iPOD doc, it's 2009, you'll probably get 3 - LOL. Seriuosly, put everything you can think of on your register becasue after your wedding, you and your lucky husband will have a truck load of gifts to return. When you return them, get gift cards or store credits so you all can purchase what you're missing. Several small unwanted 29.99 gifts returned to Target can net you a $150 store credit - look out sheets!|`|q7NrlanJaa	I know how you feel I was worried about putting too many expensive items on my list as well.  I kept thinking "no one will spend that much" but hey some people did.  I say it is fine as long as you have a wide price range of gifts on the list and you have plenty of smaller items $20 or less for those that don't have a lot to spend. I put lots of brand name stuff on mine because I figure I want quality and people don't mind spending a little extra for a gift as long as it doesn't get out of hand!<br>  Also that is smart about the discount, I considered that myself just keep in mind I think it is only like 5 or 10%|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I don't think a few expensive things are a problem.  It does help to have less expensive things, that way you will actually get stuff!  I was looking at a friends registry today and was wondering what I would get her because it's all pretty expensive!|`|hkwBR1moaa	Leave them on and don't feel bad.  You don't know what someone will get you.  I know sometimes when my whole family is invited to a wedding, we all put in to get something 'big' on the registry so the couple can get a bigger ticket item that someone individually really can't afford.|`|nqINitkmaa	I registered for the $400 kitchen aid mixer! lol. Agree its great!  I think you are being very reasonable. I registered at Bed bath and Beyond and Macy's and I have several kitchen items that are over $150 I have a thing with alclad pots and pans! More expensive items guests may contribute to get you one joint gift, or you may not get it at all, but people will not be offended if you have a few higher priced items. Congrats!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	You can register for almost anything you want. Cash, cars, honeymoons, houses and anything of that nature are considered rude. But some people will go together on a gift and others will prefer inexpensive items since not everyone has a ton of cash laying around in the current economy to spend on other people. A registry is a wish list, not a must-have list. So you can put nearly anything you want on it but don't expect to receive everything you want.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	in my family a kitchen aid mixer is like, a standard issue presant, everyone gets one when they get married.  so that to me is definatly worth keeping on there especially if you like to cook.  also, kitchen aid mixers last FOREVER! my mom has hers from when my parents got married, the thing is 33 years old and still works awesome! so thats DEFINATLY worth the price<br>  <br>    good sheets do cost a pretty penny these days, so that $129 price tag doesnt really surprise me either.<br>  <br>  the only one of your three items im questioning is the ipod dock, but then i have seen far stranger items on wedding registries, so if you wanna keep it on there, go for it|`|e944de21d2b8be3991f127b78c28319daa	Not at all, the main thing is to register for a wide range of prices, to accommodate everyone's budget.<br>  <br>  We registered for stuff in the 200 or more price range, but a majority of what we registered for is around 20-30, and lots even under 10.  There may very well be some family members willing to splurge or go in on something together, just give them options.<br>  <br>  Heck, we registered for a 750 dollar pool table!  Mainly as a joke, no one thinks we are serious about it.
8f7484cd58d5ae1f35f8ec33cbe9d727aa	Dear Angel,<br>  <br>  Listening is one thing: You seem to do it well and his Mom seems comfortable talking with you.  GOOD FOR YOU!!  You are miles ahead in a relationship that will have a huge impact on your married life.  Don't mess up.  Be supportive, but be honest.  <br>  <br>  Giving advice is another:  if you have had no experience in that area, tell her so.  You can offer opinions, but be careful that they are not too extreme.  Mostly, she is needing a friend.  You can do that!!<br>  <br>  Good luck, Sweetie!|`|htWw0OlCaa	I think she does just need someone to listen, and someone that she can turn to to vent about things. Sometimes just getting it out and having someone to listen helps. So that may be what it is. Best wishes|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	I'd just listen unless she asked me a direct question.|`|JlbxqSM6aa	listen, but if you don't agree I wouldn't be saying i did|`|07A0bFi6aa	Listen but don't get dragged into saying anything about anyone. You can show empathy to her feelings without actually being rude about the person in question. Remember these people are going to be in your life as well and you need to have your own relationship with them. Also you don't want things to be thrown back in your face in the future (out of context or otherwise). How do you know she doesn't complain about you behind your back? Better to play it safe.....remain neutral and welcome to family politics.|`|05367a0d7cefb29c0600aa24d75c941faa	Do wad u are doing...listen and agree on most of the things.By listening, we lose nothing.Juz make sure not to mention abt others in the conversation.<br>  Hope i helped!|`|AA12324252	Being able to listen without interruption is a gift worth cultivating. It is not only beneficial to her but to you as well. It teaches patience. Thank God she loves and trusts you enough to talk to you and take you into her confidence. This is a very good start in your relationship.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Just listen....
krQiDGCHaa	...Not really getting why him having playing cards in his pocket would mean he were cheating.<br>  <br>  ..Am I slow or does this question just not make sense?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  OH WAIT WAIT WAIT.  I get it. :)<br>  <br>  Not stupid, just a little slow on the uptake. :)<br>  <br>  Take one of the cards out, mark it subtly, and put it back in his pocket.  Then, next time you play you'll know if he cheated or not.|`|9163f6723559c34dd8054736b04c9f39aa	If when you say "he" you mean your husband and by saying "cheating" you mean in a card game. Why don't you ask him why he hard cards in his pocket.  If a card game's that important to you that you would accuse your husband of cheating, go ahead and risk having an argument.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	Yes, he is a cheater! You busted him Girl, now MAKE HIM PAY!!!<br>  he owes you foot rubs and back rubs for the next 20 YEARS!!!!<br>  great question!<br>  <br>  I wonder how many will say: <br>  DIVORZ HEM, SISTAH!<br>  gets urshelf a loller ans SUEZZ HEMS!<br>  find a counselor, your marriage can be saved...<br>  <br>  and my personally favorite: <br>  FINDZ THAT HOMEWRECKER AND SHOTZ HER FULL-O-HOLESZZZZZ....<br>  <br>  have fun!|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	you said "we used last night" that mean you were there too.  therefore he's not cheating.  if you already seen the cards and now the cards are in his pocket that means you're allowing to put cards in his pocket.|`|9qiLZp50aa	Wow you guys, she's talking about cheating in a game of cards. <br>  Maybe; why don't you ask him?|`|uTdEdpAeaa	...|`|W0XoDxJraa	LOL at people not understanding this!

ZmdIlkpQaa	Love is, at its base, that condition in which the other person's happiness is integral to your own.  <br>  <br>  Now, passion, friendship, loyalty, admiration and companionship are all elements of love.  Passion tends to was and wane over the years as our bodies change and as our chance to focus on each other changes.  Friendship and loyalty and companionship and admiration all fill in the dips of passion.  If whatever you call love is just passion, then its actually just lust, and it will certainly fade away now and again, and if there's nothing else to fill in, then the relationship is probably done.  <br>  <br>  I've been married more than 20 years now, and I find that love renews itself over and over, and passion is subject to just such a renewal, if the other elements are working properly.  I'm every bit as in love with the woman I married as I was the first time we kissed, and I'm still very passionate about her, too.  The stereotype you are thinking of, I suspect, comes when people stop focusing on each other, begin taking each other for granted, and stop feeling that the other person's happiness is a critical component of being happy themselves.  They stop trying to be happy and to make their partner happy, and that's death to love.  In my humble opinion, another absolute killer to love is jealousy.  Loving someone should not equate to owning them!|`|kbz5S3waaa	Love is being content and 100% comfortable with the person you’re with. It’s knowing that no matter how bad it may seem, you know you’ll pull through. Love is when you ask ‘is it worth this fight’ and the answer is always yes, because you cannot imagine having to go a single day without that person. Love is when you know you would do absolutely anything for that person, no matter the harm done to yourself. You put that person above yourself for everything, always.|`|QCfOUgxnaa	I am more in love with my husband now than I was when I married him.  It just grows each day.  <br>  <br>  Love is when someone else's happiness is essential to your own.  It's when you put your wants after theirs.  I can't be happy until he is.  <br>  <br>  And I don't think love is just up to destiny or fate.  It's a choice!  We choose to keep dating and flirting, even though we've been married for awhile.  That's what keeps the love growing.  Love only diminishes when we stop giving it.  You have to CHOOSE a happily ever after.|`|1NIFJaThaa	I've only been married for two years, so I really couldnt comment on how the love is after 60 years. What I do know is that you know its love when no matter what you and your husband go through , the challenges, the arguments, the highs and lows, at the end of it your love conquers all the challenges you faced together. That thing that words aren't enough to capture what it really is.<br>  <br>  I mean we have had pretty rough moments (my husband and I ) and I think, is this worth it, but when the dust settles and you look each other in the eyes and you feel that warmth when you look at each other you realise nothing is too big for both. Marriage is a lot of work and as my mom says, 'only the strongest marriages can stand the test of time'. Tests meaning the challenges, financial burdens etc.<br>  <br>  Hope this gave some insight.|`|RvpWs34Saa	"It is wrong to think that love comes from long companionship and persevering courtship. Love is the offspring of spiritual affinity and unless that affinity is created in a moment, it will not be created for years or even generations." <br>  — Kahlil Gi bran <br>  Beautifully said, this famous poet believed in love at first sight. To find true love is something special and something to treasure. I think we take one another for granted way to often. The initial stage of butterflies in your tummy does fade but its replaced by a deeper peaceful kind of love, its comforting, its rewarding and best of all you dont remember a time you loved or were loved by anybody else. Being in love can evolve and over time become just as strong as the moment he/she took your breath away|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	Love changes over time; <br>  <br>  passionate early years,<br>  happy years with young children, buy your house, start careers<br>  worrisome mid-life crisis years, bills are stacking, love making is lacking, <br>  comfortable years when you can finish each others sentences and thoughts,<br>  <br>  It is probably different for every couple, but you roll with the changes, get thru the challenges; that's what it's all about!|`|LnFRZkRCaa	You know you're with the right person when you can imagine walking through life together for eternity. Love is uncontrollable and you'll know it when you feel it. It's in the way you feel around each other. There's passion and comfort, adoration and companionship, security and a sense of belonging.
hvIMKEH0aa	Women need guys with respect and guys that can care about them.<br>  Looks of course, do matter, just not as much.<br>  Personality makes a guy look better to us.<br>  <br>  & mostly because all of the 'hot' 'rich' etc... guys are always conceited &or have no respect.<br>  If you have looks and respect like those 'goofy' guys than that's like ...<br>  amazing :P<br>  but, that's hard to find.<br>  <br>  We women go to whoever is mysterious, different and has a great personality.|`|x5ftqjo5aa	This is my theory....<br>  Society pressures women to be sexy more than it does men. Hence, if they get an uglier lover, they don't have to try as hard and they can still look good while standing next to him. Also, uglier guys will be less likely to cheat or be flirted with by other women. They also will not think of themselves as stud muffins and big shots.|`|Wqqoo0IZaa	Who cares? It's all about game. You can be ugly and have enough game to bag a hottie. or you can be great lookin' and have absolutely no game, and bag nothing but internet porn. Whatever it is women seek, you just need to adjust your game to be able to pull your own hot girl, so do what you have to.

I personally want the guy who is romantic and sweet, not someone who is going to treat me bad, but then again most guys who are the same age as me are not at the same maturity level as I am, so I am attracted to older guys.  There is a girl out there for you though, just keep being who you are and don't start acting like a jerk.|`|Qbczt3ivaa	no...thats the worst thing in a guy! I'd rather have someone is is romantic and sweet than a person who isnt! how about you? <br>  <br>  Personally, I would LOVE a guy who is romantic! <br>  <br>  <br>  some girls are crazy to think someone can be too "nice"...but it can also be an age thing. when your older, you learn to appreciate kindness and not just some guy who doesnt have any respect towards others.

Also, if you're acting all romantic with girls that are just your friends that's a total turn off. Basically, yes, the whole going for the bad boy thing is a stage, but being overly romantic and clingy will never get you a girl at any stage.|`|78ouhV4caa	Hi! well im a 19 year old girl from Suffolk and have heard that london women are prone to liking A holes lol.

AA12160073	I had a similar situation.  I would legalize your marriage to the man first and then, you're in a position to oppose what goes in and out of his wallet.  I did find that after I married my husband and his kids became "of age" he put a stop to them using him for everything.  It all hinged on our marriage.  Eventually, the ex married the boyfriend and the kids had families of their own and they learned that Dad was not a cash cow and they would have to face both of us if they asked for anything...which they don't.  Guess you and your man will have to sit down and hash this one out.  Godloveya honey.|`|68lLAQnKaa	you married him knowing that he had been married before, this shows some sign of acceptance for his past.  In a situation like this though, you have to walk in forgiveness daily and communicate to your husband that he should not be manipulated by an ex...|`|SHoGWZWPaa	It is very hard dealing with an ex and especially children from a prior relationship.

So let go of the poor guy and move on to someone with no baggage.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	I know - it is REALLY frustrating to be on the other side. I commend you for knowing that it's not your place to say anything. All your man can do is do his best. His children are the ones who will lose out on positive experiences they could have had with their dad. <br>  <br>  Men on Y!A are always complaining about how unfair the system is, but I do personally know many men who've successfully fought for fair child support, equitable custody and fair divisions of expenditures outside child support. One of my friends has an ex-wife who constantly tries to get away with making him pay for more than half of things like summer camp, music lessons, etc. etc. He's just had to be vigilant about making sure she pays her fair share. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you. Be strong for your man. If you need support, try a counselor/clergyman what have you.|`|mQ8e5jZnaa	wow! I dont think you need counseling, I think you need some deep conversations with your husband.  He probably compensates her whims and his childrens needs more than others because he feels bad that they had to endure their parents getting divorced. This is a difficult situation.  WOW!  This is obviously getting to you, and I can't help but wonder if your husband knows how much this all upsets you.  Does he realize what he is putting you through?  Ex wives are not all like her, I am one and I've always worked and depended on no one, not even their dad,  only what the court financially said he was responsible for.  She gives us Ex's a bad name.<br>  Talk a lot to your husband,  Try to keep the home fires burning, and supportive but keep in mind he has to be in tune with what you are feeling about all this, give him a chance|`|bO2rzfISaa	My husband chose a real loser to be the mother of his kids, but I figure they had lots in common at the time. Your husband chose that woman, too. He also raised those kids long enough to instill some of those values you disdain. Likewise, he hasn't done much to remove those values if he just hands the kids money and lets them treat him badly. Why isn't he straightening them out during visitation? Something tells me there's not much of that happening. He checked out of parenting them, and it shows, right?<br>  <br>  Don't let your husband off the hook.<br>  <br>  I see my husband check out of his children's education and upbringing. I also think that we live at my level now, not necessarily the one he would choose if alone. Sound familiar?|`|AA11596133	OK, so are you going to tell me that you DID NOT KNOW all of this garbage about the ex BEFORE you let yourself become involved in his life?  When you two discussed his relationship with the ex, did he make you any promises that anything would ever change?  Did he tell you that once you two became serious that he would cut her or the kids off?  Did you ever agree to not get involved or have any say in how things are handled?<br>  <br>  OBVIOUSLY your husband is a wimp.  If his kids or the ex USE him, it is because he is too weak to stand up for himself and say NO.  You cannot blame THEM for that - for all they know, he does not mind being used.  Sure, they do not respect him - it is very hard to respect a wimp. As long as he LETS them USE him, they will keep coming back for more. HE NEEDS TO SAY NO - and mean it.  Have you ever asked him WHY he does not do that?<br>  <br>  YOU make your OWN life hard. You too need to stand up for yourself and learn how to say NO.  Quit blaming everyone else.  If you do not like what is going on, SAY SO or shut up and learn to live with it.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	maybe you and your partner should try couple counseling..|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	First of all, this situation is hardly the norm, and no, you do not want to be "an ex wife."  He is a good father, otherwise your situation wouldn't be so hard.  If he wasn't a good father, you probably wouldn't want him.  It's just a big cycle and you have to take the bad with the good.  It's just life with a divorced parent.<br>  <br>  Teenagers get their values' system from just about any source but their parents and of course, they know more than their parents, so you really cannot judge parenting by looking at teens.<br>  <br>  I'm a single mom and have been for 10 years.  It's really difficult to instill solid morals and values in your children in this day in age, because it's swimming against the tide of their peers and their entertainment--even regular television for children, sometimes.  And no, we are not living off my ex husband.  lol|`|AA11990465	This shouldn't be about your husbands ex, it should be about the children and what is best for them. The children need to be supported by both parents financially, medically and emotionally. What  your husband is doing for his children is exactly what he should be doing. Someday the children will be old enough to take care of themselves and your husband will be off the hook for support, although you must understand that he will still always be their father. I think you should try focusing on what is best for the children and forget about the ex.<br>  <br>  *It is spelled interfering for future reference.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Honey, I can completely appreciate how you feel.  She probably won't marry her boyfriend of ten years because alimony will then stop if she's legally married.  But this is all about you right now.  You have to decide for yourself.  What is more important to you?  Being with him with all this drama or moving on and eventually being with someone else?  You really have no choice in the matter.  You're right, you have litttle to no say in how his ill mannered kids act, you have no control over the ex-wife and her antics.  But yet you love him and are very compatible with him. All you can do is try to accept it.  Accept it as well as you can.  Realize that you are hurting YOURSELF when you let these thoughts in your mind.  Their bad behavior takes the front burner in your life because what you put your attention to (their ways, their ill manners, etc.) has the control over YOU.  So you're allowing it basically.  Get yourself into a peaceful mindset over it.  Pray that you can let this go.  Practice letting it go.  Whenever they irritate you or creep into your head, let it go.  Especially if it's just a thought and they're not even around.  Maybe seek some counseling too to get a better handle on it.  Counseling just for yourself initially, see what a professional has to say.  Good luck to you!
ZEhpjZfXaa	Okay,<br>  1. He looks at you alot<br>  2. He blushes when you catch him looking at you<br>  3. He always starts the converstaion<br>  4. He likes to tease you in a friendly way<br>  5. He talks about him self when your around<br>  6. He tries to get your attention<br>  7. He tries to impress you<br>  8. He is always facing towards you<br>  9. He talks to you and is happy to see you<br>  10. His friends talk about you<br>  11. Hes nervous around you( some guys are and some arent)<br>  12. He flirts with other girls infront of you( hes trying to make you jealous)<br>  <br>  <br>  Thats pretty much the basic signs:)|`|p59ew3dMaa	Some times not all signs are meant to be.  It comes from the way that person makes you feel inside.  You see if that boy makes you feel special it's how you feel that makes it special.  Signs are when he approaches you with questions like want to go to the movies, hang out, trade numbers, asks who do you like in school?  That's the ticket!  To find out ask him first who he wouldn't mind going out with. If he tells you someone else don't get upset.  If he asks you tell him you are the one I would like to go out with.Doing this creates reality. Telling someone how you feel isn't so wrong.  It opens doors sometimes.   Sometimes people are shy and from this people loose out.  This is Life and signs always don't mean what they say.  I wish you the Best and be smart!|`|lX1zpaoAaa	Different things for different guys. But sometimes they will treat you different from any other girl, may it be good or bad. They prolly want to be around you a lot too. Good luck! =)|`|JDC02N8waa	Pays attention to you<br>  His friends start paying attention to you<br>  he offers for you to hang out<br>  Walks with you to classes or helps you<br>  tells you you're the best and whatnot constantly<br>  And yes even the being picked on thing<br>  watches you also
djUMvICoaa	I've been divorced from the mother of my children for 30 years or more.  When they got married, I danced with my ex.  We are together for birthday parties and I talk with my ex and her hubby.  It was better for me not being in that marriage, it just wasn't working out.  I still have that special place in my heart for her, it would be stupid not to for she is the mother of my children.  The trouble with divorce is that the kids end up hurtiing the most.  Why, because you love them both and suddenly with your world is turned upside down and not of your own doings, and to a degree you feel you have to pick a side, mom or dad.  It shouldn't be about picking sides, you should be able to still love them both the same, just under different circumstances.  But you should be able to talk with them and tell them how you feel, it won't change things for them but you might get some words of advice that i may have missed, or at least a hug and kiss for you to know you are still loved, that that never  changed.  Sometimes kids feel that they are the reason for the divorce and that is never the case and that is maybe part of what you have to get out in your anger.  One thing that happens to couples is that for some reason they drift apart, they find that what drew them together in the first place was lost or just not enough to make them happy anymore..  And both your mom and dad deserve to be happy, don't they, even if it means not being together?|`|AA11220327	it is more than possible, it is preferable. My own ex and I are on very good terms, and still good friends, doing all of the kids things together, and even get along with each others current spouses. My parents have been divorced for 20 years, and are the best of friends. None of us find any reason to have it any other way, this is whats best for the kids and grandkids in both situations, and we are all happy with it.|`|7d768c46ae3bc8900df03faec5161f4eaa	I have seen it happen that way once.  The couple were friends of mine... and at one point when the ex wife lost her apartment, her ex husband took her in and let her live with him.  Strictly as roommates.  <br>  <br>  Some people are better as friends than they are as lovers, but they didn't know it when they got married and started a family.  Its sad.....<br>  <br>  Good luck... God bless|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	My parents got divorced when I was 5.  I've never seen them act in any manner other than being friends.  They've always went to my school functions, to each other's 2nd weddings, sat by each other, called each other, it's always be friendly.|`|6hgiRL7Vaa	I know of several divorces that contain all of the above ingredients except respect.  They are friendly, amicable, understanding, attend back yard Bar B Q's together, etc.  Makes for great family get togethers and the children feel they have happy homes at both places.<br>  <br>  <br>  In private, they both say the other isn't a good person.|`|4JrDGW7Taa	Amicable divorce? If it has happened I do not know about it. But I understand why you feel so uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately life is full of obstacles. If it isn't divorce, it's loosing your job or a serious sickness. That is the way things are. And the best thing I can tell you is that you better learn how to deal with adversity.<br>  <br>  Check out my source for more info about dealing with life's problems.|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	Quit pretending. Talk to your parents and let them know how you feel. Is the action amicable? It can be if They DO NOT let others tell them what to do. When me ex I decided to end "it" It was going good till others butted in...with all the wrong advice ect... It is hard on the kids and you should at least express your concerns, respectfully, to them.|`|rv0EMOKwaa	Yes I have. Sometimes people just fall out of love with each other, and they both realize that. When that happens and there is still respect between the two involved things usually end up amicably, at least it did for my parents.|`|dnFjdJ72aa	no most end up badly|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Yeah.  Mine.  My brother's.  My best friend's.<br>  <br>  Divorce is hard on everyone.  But lots of divorcing parents are able to separate thier marital issues from thier parenting responsibilities and meet the needs of their kids.<br>  <br>  My ex and I have such a good relationship that he spends all major holidays with us.  <br>  <br>  My brother and his ex wife go out of their way to ensure they talk at least once a week about the kids (they each have one living with them in different cities).<br>  <br>  IT takes time, that's all.  Tensions run high in the beginning, due to the huge changes you're all going through.   The hurt doesn't go away immediately for anyone.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	It would be a good idea to let your parents know how you feel...just remember, their divorce is about them, and caused by them...not you...
Tuv79aXWaa	dude, why does it matter? <br>  lmao|`|19JRf8Cxaa	Interesting question, I'm really not sure!|`|GRa8dmx7aa	yes ~ it is the delicacy of our touch and the nimbleness of our fingers.|`|d940b613c72e65dceb131f078c7f061eaa	It would be interesting to see this tested blindly if it could be done to see just how accurate your premise is.  There may be a point in your favor to do with fingernails; women generally being more accustomed to the tending and management of theirs than men, and thus perhaps having an edge when tickling deliberately.  But on the whole tickling is far too situational and dependent upon the state of mind of the participants to be able to make strong generalizations.  Possibly you're more open to being tickled silly by women.  Alternatively, the converse might be true; the women who tickle you might be more inclined to enthusiasm.  It's a delicate encounter, in that many things might cause an extra burst of oomph to kick in or open up on one side or the other.  It's not easy to tell what might influence the way you might respond to being tickled by different people.
ina2jZ5Saa	calm down sweetie, its just that you got bad genes. Meaning, lucky you, you tend to get really sick simply cuz of your hormones rampaging when you get your period. Birth control really helps A LOT. You do know, that you can take it without parental consent. Ask your doctor about it, or ask around and there should be a local clinic somewhere near you, where you can get free birth control without your parents finding out. I hope I helped. =)|`|O2qwuIhqaa	Im sorry. Why don't your parents take you to the doctor? Yes for sure get a hold of a heating pad it works miracles for all sorts of pains especially in the lower tummy! Yes, some birth control pills will help with cramps, you should be able to go to a clinic and get them without your parents consent. Not that I am condoning sex by any means; but your health & feeling good are very important. BUT watch out for the pill; what it does is gives your body a false sense of pregnancy so about the first 3 months or so you will want to eat everything, have mood swings, etc...  Good Luck!|`|DTGZJ8T6aa	you just have a more intense period, it happens to me some months too. I think i might get birth control soon, that's really the best way to fix it. try to convince your parents, telling them how it can help you with the once a month pain. In the meantime, use heating pads... I use them and they help alot.|`|nd5w7v4saa	I'm not gonna lie, i cry when i get mine too.<br>  But mine last for much longer than an hour.<br>  <br>  Birth control pills, i'd say no.<br>  <br>  I would try these,<br>  Laying flat on your back, using a heating pad.<br>  <br>  Putting a freezing cold wash rag on it, leaving it there.<br>  <br>  Drinking water, <br>  <br>  Pamprin works good too. <br>  <br>  Ha, I know it sounds retarded coming from someone younger than you, but I learned all of it from my older sister.|`|KcK9K7PQaa	its normal to have pain when your on your period, everyone  is different try taking paracetamol and get a hot_water_bottle and drink allot of water or juice. my mum says  exercise is the best thing. I WOULDNT HAVE IT , THATS JUST STUPID WAIT UNTILL YOUR OLDER!!!!!!|`|v2XKMN32aa	What? Have what your period? Your question makes no sense maybe that's why people don't answer, they're confused, your title is could he possibly like me. Then you go talking about you period?|`|HaRVuFCOaa	Well going through your period is tough. I get my cramps before my period.Nothing is really wrong with you it is just "mother nature". But if medicine or other stuff don't work. Ask your doctor just in case it can be something serious. But I am sure there is nothing wrong with you. Check with your doctor before you go on the pill.|`|sntmmx4gaa	I think you posted this question in the wrong area. That doesn't sound comfortable. I think that maybe a doctors visit would be helpful because if a doctor prescribes birth control then your dad might listen. That's not normal. I'm a couple years older than you and I don't have cramps like that. If you can't afford a doctor then maybe mebmd it. They have alot of good advise. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!! I really mean it!|`|SaTa58emaa	Walking around might help. I know it sounds silly, almost the oposite from what you want to do... but exercise can make cramps feel better. <br>  Try to eat a lot of bananas around that time, Potasium has been shown to help with athletes that get cramps. <br>  Midol will allways work better for things like this, it is actually made for it... so try that. <br>  Hope you feel better hun. <br>  Sucks that you had to post this and make it seem like its about a boy in case ur parents see.. :*(|`|4088855415d3c30807d176d03d3e8922aa	Birth control in the form of pills is well proven to help keep a period more regular and lighter which may in turn result in a less painful period. You can get free birth control from the nearest Planned Parenthood and it will all be kept confidential.

svzGz9STaa	Of course it's legal for him to take you back to court. Any divorced parent can take the other back to court whenever they want to. But filing a custody modification suit does NOT mean that he has grounds to take her away. If he has grounds - abuse, neglect, etc - then he may very well win custody. Or if he has evidence that your fiance has a history of abuse. Or if he is able to prove that he can provide a better environment for her. <br>  <br>  And even though he's most likely blowing smoke, you'll probably have to hire a lawyer to fight him in court. That being said, your attorney can request that if you win you get reimbursed for attorney fees. There's no guarantee that you'd get it, though.|`|m81dfyOYaa	You are correct, "what grounds does he have to take her away?" - none. Just ignore his threats if you can, he's just blowing off smoke.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Honey, I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.  It sounds like your ex-husband is jealous of your upcoming marriage and now he's acting like a jerk.  But who is he really hurting?  Your daughter.  Get yourself a good family law attorney.  Start asking around NOW before it even gets to that point.  You may want to set up an appointment or call one now just to see if what he is threating can be done.  I don't believe any court of law is going to take your child away from you.  If anything, you're the one displaying a more solid family foundation (you and your husband) than he is (him alone).  So that would be taken into consideration.  Just make sure he has nothing on either of you (you or your husband).  But it's far better to hear all this from an attorney and be either prepared for the worse or be glad to tell your ex-husband, "I consulted with a family law attorney and you have no leg to stand on."  Just get your ducks in a row first.  I hope I helped.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	He angry your getting married  again and he trying to frighten you so stop being scared he got slim chance to take the child or less the kid wanted to be with him <br>  I think you need to take these threats to your lawyer and make sure you a good case put together why she needs to continue  to live with you|`|dWLGK7nlaa	You cannot lose custody of your child because you remarry. If your new husband is a child molester or a drug addict or something like that, it is possible. Your ex is trying to threaten you for no reason. Don't let him scare you. Keep your nose clean, keep being a good mom and you will keep your custody. He has no grounds unless you aren't telling us something.  GOOD LUCK!!|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	People threaten to do things all the time..wait and see if he truly takes you back to court.|`|v0ZQWry7aa	Look at your divorce papers. I live in GA and was remarried this past summer. Divorced finalized in 2006. I still have full custody of my kids and my ex can't touch that. Your final divorce papers state all of the facts. Mine says I can't have overnight guest that aren't family. Your paper may not even touch on that.|`|b2dffdde9d95855452a59a5a7564c914aa	He can revisit the family court, but it will be up to the judge to alter any existing custody agreement.  Your ex may not have any grounds.  He may just be fearful that he will not see your daughter anymore.  Best to check with a family court attorney for advice. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Most lawyers offer a free consultation - I don't think that remarriage is grounds for custody loss unless it somehow makes you unfit - but I'm not a lawyer.  Contact one just to be sure...I have a feeling it'll make your ex pretty steamed when he realizes he won't be getting his way...Good luck!|`|nuwzqEbzaa	Unless you or your fiance are abusive to her, there is nothing he can do. You have moved on and he is trying to keep that from happening|`|8259f37f3bb63217d47d975af43b7855aa	He's just trying to scare you to prevent you from re-marrying.  You have primary custody, and the judge isn't going to take that away from you unless you prove to be an unfit mother, or your fiance' is considered a threat.  You can contact the lawyer you used for your divorce & tell him/her what your ex is trying to pull, and go from there.  I don't know if it's illegal, but I know it's immoral.  You have a right to be happy just like anyone else, and your daughter has a right to a positive role model.  Who better than someone with an Military background?
1415133dda6d51b695452e406f5973a5aa	Thats what you think, not what you feel. <br>  <br>  If you really felt he was that weak already you would of quit. Take control of YOUR relationship, YOUR friendship. Simple things like who asked who, or how it all started will be pretty small to the bigger stuff your missing out on right now.

vUVxS9Xhaa	If a girl thinks its acceptable to get into a fist fight then that girl is obviously not very classy and doesnt deserve to be with someone like me.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Here's the real question: why were you allowing flirty messages to be sent to you while you know you had a girlfriend?  Didn't you ever stop to say "Hey, you know, I appreciate the compliments, but I have a girlfriend who I really care about"?  I assume your girlfriend wouldn't be mad if you had actually put a stop to this in the first place.<br>  <br>  You should apologize to the girl for leading her on, and you should apologize to your girlfriend for being an idiot.|`|pjrRbgnIaa	get them together and talk about it x
4c83045a8d203567c04bfaf4a84efa0eaa	believe me, we all flirt! <br>  If you were attracted to this other man at the gym, you would have felt it BIG TIME. A feeling inside would have literally screamed in your ear "OH MY GOD HE IS THE ONE" (or something like that)<br>  <br>  Good luck, don't think about the guy at the gym too much now, because you may be fooling yourself into thinking you like him as a consequence of someone else telling you you were flirting. The fact that you talked about your gf's and bf's so much is because you love your current boyfriend a lot! You can't stop talking about him! You told us the evidence!<br>  <br>  Once again good luck, the more you avoid this guy at the gym, it is likely you will just dig yourself a deeper hole mentally, set things straight with the guy at the gym, and move on!<br>  <br>  xxx|`|5hxWSezPaa	Stop beating up on yourself.  You did nothing wrong.  So, you have a boyfriend and flirted with another guy and your boyfriend said no big deal.  That should be the end ot it.  Save your worries for when you do something relaly stupid, but not for this.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	you probably flirted because you are just close friends with him. he also has a lot of things in common with your bf so part of your brain might of thought he was your bf or something like which then you flirted.<br>  <br>  it is really not a big deal at all. it is not cheating, not even close<br>  <br>  and no the person above does not know what she is saying|`|SHoGWZWPaa	It sounds like you may have had more of an intimate relationship with this other man than you initially realized and now you feel guilty. You were honest about it and now you just have to move forward. You need to stop thinking about the other man.|`|Iod5edCSaa	If you are flirting and you don't even know it...<br>  <br>  You weren't really flirting, you were being friendly. Often times when a person is in a happy commited relationship they get real comfortable around members of the opposite sex. Comfortable, because they are no longer looking for a mate, so they are not worried about how they look or how they sound. None of that does he think I am funny, sexy, cute, mean, nice... So in that comfort zone others might see you as being flirty, when what you are being is yourself. Instead of some fake plastic person who is trying to be something she is not. The only way this could be harmful is if the other man thinks you are interested and then he starts to get personal. It sounds like this did not happen.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Remember that forgiveness is the answer to ones problems.

You were simply talking. It's perfectly fine for women to have male friends, you know. You don't need a closer because you didn't do anything wrong. Surround yourself with healthy relationships.

6LamNmHsaa	My eyes in tears for you. I really feel for you. God you must be devastated. Just keep your own family close. My cousin have the same problem he looses it when he is drinking. I would do the same as i wouldn't let any drinker come near young one if he is out of its senses. child safety is of first priority for you. I know you love him and he loves you as well tell him to stop drinking there are ways to control addiction. as in our country UK has people to help alcoholics like "Talk to Frank" etc...|`|oojO4WAraa	Accept him as he is, or file for divorce and hope he comes to his senses and stops drinking.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Don't convince him to come home unless he joins AA and dries up. He is already batting with a strike on him because his father was an alcoholic. He needs professional help. Help him to get it. If you weaken because ' you love him' then you will damage your marriage and your baby's future beyond repair.|`|5hxWSezPaa	Nothing will improve between the two of you as long as he continues to abuse alcohol.  Admitting that you have a problem is tough but he needs to admit it and go to AA meetings regularly.  Talk to him about it.  Tell him how much you love him but his drinking is ruining the marriage.  If he loves you he will get some help.|`|lNqSx1znaa	He needs to come home because he's choosing you. That's what you deserve. There's more going on here than you think.

Don't call him.|`|OBCvewW2aa	Two words.<br>  <br>  Al Anon.|`|JV0i77uiaa	The best thing you can do now is to go to Al-anon, they are wonderful people and they will help you.  There is nothing you can do, he in denial at this time.  Let him pick his clothes.  Don't try to convince to come back home, if you do that he will come back with more power and he will do it again.  Don't feel bad, you did not do anything wrong.  The only thing is you never argue with somebody who has been drinking.  I hope you go to Al-anon, God bless you.|`|874EAxkfaa	your baby's well being should be your utmost priority. make your decisions based on that. alcoholics are LIARS.|`|y9TUWrjIaa	Excessive drinking is NOT a disease , it is a CHOICE.|`|c2da9d6744cd0c23d5d0b9b9300338a7aa	Stand your ground for you child's sake. It's not just about how you feel. Your husband is bullying you. Go to Alanon for yourself.|`|0792619596c4d5ccb67112a927699e6eaa	Plain & simple:  YOU CAN'T.  He has to make that decision on his own.  But if he has a drinking problem, why do you want him anyway?  There's no telling what he could do to you or your son.  But if he doesn't know whether or not he wants to still be married to you already...  that's not a good sign and chances are that even if you do work things out this time, sometime down the road it'll come around back to divorce anyway.  And if he can't stop drinking for the sake of his own child & put the child's welfare above him wanting to go out and have a good time, then you shouldn't even want to stay married to him anyway.  I say cut your losses and go.  You don't need someone like him anyway.|`|6wd1SWn0aa	My Dear Child,<br>  You are feeling what anyone can possibly feel under the circumstances.  You are trying to protect your child from harm and possible bad examples. According to your statement you seem to think that he has a problem with alcohol, maybe he does, whose to say.  I believe that you need to tough love him and stick to your guns.<br>  He needs to realize that he needs to change in order to continue with his family. The only way that I would suggest for you to be with him is if he promised you to seek help and you can support him in the process otherwise I don't see how else this can be resolved unless he makes the first step.  Realize that deep inside he does have a problem that he needs to deal with. I know that you love him and your child is just a little baby...but you need to realize that you are living for your child now. He is an adult and he needs to take his responsibilities seriously and take charge of his life and his beautiful family.<br>  <br>  I wish you all the best.<br>  <br>  Baby~|`|TR5ntsavaa	A lot of alcoholics don't think their drinking is a problem, even if it's obvious to everyone around them that it is. He needs to make the choice for himself that he's going to come home, and work on his drinking problem. It hurts, I know. A few weeks ago I permanently cut off contact with my alcoholic ex-boyfriend, whom I was still completely, madly in love with. I miss him, but honestly, I'm happier without him. If your husband does end up leaving, it's going to hurt, but eventually you will come out stronger and better for it. Trust me. I'm sorry you're having to go through this. Feel free to email me if you need to talk.|`|WU6pTTvCaa	You could always beg him to come home and tell him you'll never mention this again . . . that may get him physically home, but it won't change a thing.<br>  <br>  I have a feeling more was said that just the fact that he came come drunk.  If that was the case then you would quietly put him to bed as to not disturb your child.  But to put him out of the house after a fight, more was said then just don't come home drunk.  I'm sure your husband is aware of the fact his father is an alcoholic, so there is no need to remind him of the fact.  You need to realize that the fight and what was actually said is the reason he does not come home.|`|bjt4M3Icaa	You can't make anyone do what they don't want to.  Let him leave and miss you. Move on with your life (not with someone else) take care of your child. Wait it out. He will come back on his own but once he does tell him that he can only come back on your terms and explain how the drinking is not healthy for him or your marriage not to mention your child.  Let him make the choice.|`|4e0pOmt7aa	ok i think you did the right thing and now the thing is do not like cry and stuff just go up to him and say look i love more then life itself or something like that and then say we brought a kid into this world do you feel the same way or did we like bring a child into a loveless marriage.|`|vzvhvCNiaa	Get a marriage counselor, open up more, and if he doesn't straighten out, leave him. <br>  <br>  Trust me honey, if he thinks drinking is "okay" then he is an idiot.<br>  You can do better :D<br>  <br>  Hope it works out !|`|V30nBH97aa	since the alcoholism runs in your husband's family he has a 50% chance of picking up the disease. just an FYI|`|b58uhcneaa	I think you need to give him some time to cool off and think things over. Call him up and tell him that you miss him, and remind him of what is important in his life. You need to think back to why you married him in the first place, and what you wanted to get out of that marriage. Go to counseling if needed, but whatever you do. Even if he decides to leave you,  remember, life goes on, and don't worry or else you will get wrinkles. Seek help from a counselor, or best friend. It might get hard. but you can do it. Good Luck
aDhZIhQcaa	I know who I am and I like myself, by myself and for myself.  I love being the woman God created and I enjoy being that woman.  I love taking care of my man and having the role God made for me.  I love my man being the Priest, Prophet, Provider, & Protector of me and our relationship.  I can't stand women-libbers who claim that they don't need a man.  When really, inside, those same women ache for a man to love them for them.  I would marry my man today if he wanted to, but we have only been together for a couple of months.  I can tell he is ready to "pop" that question, but he feels he needs to take care of a financial situation in his real estate dealings so that he can give me a stable life.  He hasn't said that, but I have the "gift of discerment" and know what is going on.  I love marriage and all God's laws that pertain to it.  I willingly "submit" to my man as he does with me.  And I love making love everyday....yes, I said everyday, not to brag.  But he makes me feel womanly and I love to make him feel manly.

Gy9kt139aa	Go to court. The constable will serve her the subpoena papers, and she'll have to appear. When you're there, she can sign the divorce papers and the judge will want to work out some sort of custody agreements... Not letting her son see his father is not going to look good, so the judge will probably be in your boyfriend's favor.|`|mBXu5G5saa	Wow i would not want to be stuck in something like this, did you know all of this was going on when you met him?, it is just so confusing, especially that he has a son and ex-wife! The last thing you want in a relationship is trouble with your boyfriend and his past, I would have told him to take care of that, because we had gotten into the relationship but then again you are not me and i would not want a guy that has already been married or has children so good luck and best wishes!|`|96zZlJVYaa	his lawyer should know the best way to get her to sign those papers. have him to contact his lawyer and explain everything to him/her and let them take it from there.|`|AA11388175	get the lawyer to get it to court, she will sign it or the judge will|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Push his lawyer to get the divorce rolling without her unless theres something more here that he isnt telling you.

Good luck|`|Iod5edCSaa	If he is not the one asking these questions, then I would question just how hard he is trying to become divorced.|`|WU6pTTvCaa	He hired a lawyer, so the paperwork should have been sent by the attorney and the follow up should be from him.  If she does not want to sign it, you should ask the attorney to proceed on finalizing the divorce thru the courts.  He needs to go to family court to file for visitation with his child.  The court will set the guidelines for time of visitation and contact allowed between father/son.  If she violated it, you can take her back to court.<br>  <br>  The divorce and custody arrangements must be done thru the courts so the sooner you get yourself familiar with the process and start, the sooner you can have these issues ironed out, at least in a court of law.<br>  <br>  You must realize that if SHE wanted to follow thru with the divorce she would have made the payments, borrowed the money, or asked her soon to be ex husband to split the fee.  The fact she did none of these means she will drag her feet to GIVE him a divorce.  He has moved on, she has not and she is not going to make life any easier for him.|`|QCfOUgxnaa	respect marriage and family and don't date a married man.|`|AA11596133	WE?

Is there another role for the second child? Perhaps that ring bearer could also carry flowers?

If you want both ring bearers, then you shouldn't have  two ring pillows unless they are both being used. In other words, you should have each ring on a different pillow I guess. So have one carry in the bride's ring and stand on the groom's side, then have a flower girl, then have another carry in the groom's ring and stand on the bride's side, then another flower girl, etc.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	Yes, thats what we did.

You can put your head on their shoulder and it is like a nice soft pillow!|`|DTGZJ8T6aa	guys that are a little chubby can be cute, like someone else said, a giant teddybear! and they're comfier to hug|`|oyjP2mZBaa	You mean chubby?<br>  That's not a problem.<br>  (:|`|ls7tcUpiaa	you will have to work really hard to show them your personality|`|mVnZkwcGaa	cubby? what's cubby?? ha ha <br>  like chubby??<br>  well if you mean chubby..... well to be honest i wouldn't be thinking "god he's a bit chubby" i would be thinking of whether he was nice to me and how he makes me laugh and things like that. personally though i think lads who are " a bit chubby" are soooo cute. just be a nice person and you are onto a winner!!|`|qpkXD4RCaa	It depends how chubby...<br>  <br>  theres:<br>  <br>  fit - Yes<br>  meaty - ya<br>  chubby - from what these girls say ya<br>  husky - ya somewhat<br>  fat - alittle<br>  really fat - not really<br>  obese - not okay<br>  morbidly obese - bad...<br>  <br>  I'm a guy but from what I've seen I think i'm not too far off.|`|vXuiXF0taa	LOL, i like how the 1st answerer is obviously trying to point out her looks, showing her chest and hair and with that smile, yet she is saying looks don't matter! LOLOL|`|sntmmx4gaa	Looks are everything and chubby doesn't not mean cute. Personality is personally more important to me. A guy can be as ripped as ripped can get, if he's a jerk then I'm not interested!|`|oP6mtiKAaa	Yes yes yes!

bO2rzfISaa	You made a big mistake. It's not your place to contact her. If your husband doesn't like what he's doing, HE should contact her. However, what she did wasn't that big a deal. Many women keep the ex's name, and it's pathetic that she's calling his family. It's too bad it bothered you so much, you need a thicker skin if you're going to make a go of it with a previously married man. <br>  <br>  I think you should apologize and stay out of your husband 's relationship with his ex. It will only cost your step-children.<br>  <br>  It's ok, btw, to be irritated. Just keep it between you and your husband.|`|m81dfyOYaa	My husband is friendly with his ex, they have been divorced 24 years, their children are grown, married and out of state. We were all in Italy together when my step daughter got married and went sight seeing together. They maybe chatting on facebook, I've never checked, her home number and cell phone number are in my husband's (we have been married 20 years) cell phone, she calls him at least once a month, I invite her for holiday dinner when their kids are home.  I honestly don't think about it and now that I am really don't care. She's a part of his life I don't want to erase, we both have his name, they've had children together and her friendship with my husband doesn't threaten me.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Your husband should be dealing with the ex wife..he has the power to speak to her and set boundaries with her.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	I have to agree you have a right to be upset. I have to disagree with ouragon on one point. The ex has decided to drag you in by adding you to her face book. If she had not done that I would say that your husband (only) needed to shut her freak show down, but since she sees fit to drag you in then you have every right to tell her that when it comes to you she needs to stop what she is doing. Being his ex does not give her the right to cross YOUR boundaries about yourself.|`|AA11596133	NO - I think you handled it very well.  Of course she got defensive and tried to throw it back in your face - that is because she KNOWS she is in the wrong, and she is selfish, angry, and jealous herself.  She WANTS you to feel the same way SHE does, and she is in shock that you are not. Whenever people GET angry and defensive like she did, it is because they are not getting what they want. <br>  <br>  YES, you CAN control her, BUT, you HAVE to get your husband to be on the same track as you and stand united against her.  Make visitation plans with the kids well in advance, put it in writing, send her a copy, and add that this is the ONLY time she is to come in contact with your husband.  The ONLY thing they NEED to talk about IS the kids.  NO personal calls, emails, letters, or messages are to come from her - period.  Also add that if she refuse to cooperate, she may end up getting herself a restraining order. <br>  <br>  She does NOT NEED to respect you.  She NEEDS to understand that your husband is not available to her anymore - period.  She lost that right when they got divorced.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	This is unusual to say the least. However, my wife and my ex have become very good friends. I've had to stay somewhat in contact because of the kids. They just sort of got together and their friendship took off. In fact last year she went on vacation with us. Now I'm the one who sometimes is bothered. I suppose I can live with it. Between the two of them I've lived 18 years. Talk to the woman. Find out what she's after. It could be as simple as friendship.|`|CUDkCB1Uaa	I have a feeling that if your husband tells her, it will be a whole lot better than you telling her. If you share mutual feelings with your husband, then he should be able to stand up to his ex-wife.|`|SHoGWZWPaa	Dealing with an ex is never easy. It probably would have been better if your husband manned up and told her he was uncomfortable himself. If it came from him, she would have probably listened.|`|Gy9kt139aa	You are NOT being silly about this! You should be mad as hell! This woman is obviously trying to make you jealous, and is probably just feeling bad for what she did and regretting the fact that she lost her "family." <br>  <br>  She seems to be very immature. The only thing you might be able to do is just ignore the behavior. If she doesn't get a reaction, she might stop and it will circumvent getting the kids involved.|`|eawDlYHnaa	well if he loves you and you feel this strongly then yeah, its a big deal. your husband needs to be the one to talk to her because i think that women won't listen to each other in these circumstances. he needs to be on your side and tell his ex that their ARE boundaries that she has to live with now. the worst thing you did was both add her to your facebook. i would suggest both of you to delete her out. make things clear to her. you also dont want to cause family drama so i wouldn't mention it to other family members unless they ask first.|`|zu10q3Qyaa	I didn't take the time to read the entire thing you wrote but she is out of line.  She is not a part of your family and the time she spends with the kids should be between her and the kids without any involvement from you or your husband.  She shouldn't be calling and acting like his best friend and she should only visit with the kids on her own parenting time at her own house.  She has no reason to be involved with anyone else in the family except the kids that she actually gave birth to.
TR5ntsavaa	As hard as it is, you need to apologize. Simply say you're sorry for the things you said. She's probably just as sorry as you are.
1415133dda6d51b695452e406f5973a5aa	Tuck your head in, and take it till you can get out. <br>  <br>  I wish I could give you more then that, but to fight to change this situation takes more wisdom then I can shove into a single response, you can e-mail me. But it might just come back down to that, do the best you can with the resources you've got in a way that gets you out and more stable, controlled situations. Becuase what I see is two chaotic situations, and two emotionally neglecting one's, tuff stuff.
DxfFItv2aa	wow, <br>  i dunno cause im not gay. and maybe you are hot. maybe you should be un-gay. lol <br>  maybe ur 'hot' 'straight' friend really likes you back .<br>  play the field a little try girls out too. you never know :]|`|jCdC5BUdaa	hey handsome.why gotta worry for bing hot is not what lifes about.life is about having fun.everyone in this world is ho.only ugly people can see the ugliness in other people.babe its all good,dating him would be the best  thing to do,love yah|`|4yILMX7raa	ask him to stop being a self obsessed butthole and he should get over himself

e4apiusoaa	This best revenge in life is to let other know how good your life is. This makes people jealous of you. Act like you could care less. That always makes people mad. Trust me, the best revenge is be happy and show how happy you are.

Why seek for revenge for it only causes more pain to one heart .Forgive and let it be for then ye become the stronger person. Amen|`|EmGhqtt2aa	Just because someone stooped low doesn't mean you should stoop lower.<br>  Remember the Golden Rule - Do unto others as you would HAVE them do unto you.|`|GGwOjodDaa	Well you should tell them that their is a secret about some one they really hate and keep on teasing them with it.|`|IfHCSlbSaa	i like "tripping" and having my tray "accidentally" landing on them|`|WvKDJmO0aa	it doesnt work to get revenge try being nice|`|fQ2wDlgNaa	S**t in there lunch box|`|T3ZT8RLzaa	blackmail them|`|k1m8mb0qaa	we kinda need to know what happened?

AA11356977	Disfunctional! You only want her back because you dont know any better. Shes not a great catch. High maitainance and insecure. Stay away from those you fight with and your life will be much better. Stop trying to make a size 10 foot fit in a size 8 shoe. Youll get over  her I promise! Things will get worse if you move in together.|`|NyeUGGWRaa	i would just try and move on she sounds annoying and embarrased of you <br>  i think you should be single for a few weeks and see what you both want instead of breaking up every 2 seconds and being childish :) x|`|F958j8YQaa	It seems to me that you are trying to find things wrong with her.  Do you send her things on Valentine's day, and cook dinner for her?  Or do you ever plan to take her out on a weekend and do something that she enjoys doing?  Do you make a romantic evening with her for just the two of you?  Or did you ever let her know what is missing in the relationship from your point of view.  It takes two to tango, and making a relationship entails hard work.  If both parties aren't working at it together then it's not going to go where you expect it to.<br>    Why don't you come straight out and tell her you want to have a discussion with her about the relationship.  That might be a positive step in the right direction.  Or cool it for awhile and see if you really need eachother or not.

WDs4fRoxaa	Unless she lives with you, you do not have to interact with<br>  her on a constant basis.<br>  <br>  She either has psychological problems, or serious health<br>  issues that cause her to think illogically.<br>  <br>  eg. mental health issues or congested heart failure, dementia, etc..<br>  <br>  You need to have your husband go with her to her next doctors<br>  appointment and inform the doctor of her behavior so the doctor<br>  can make a decision as to what he thinks, or who he thinks she<br>  should see.<br>  <br>  eg. mental health professional or health specialist.<br>  <br>  In the meantime...keep your distance.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|585b7dfd77e867b2877fe507e55eb149aa	You husband should put you first. And his mom needs to talk to a dr and be put on medication.|`|oKExTm8paa	She sounds paranoid. Does she have any activities in her life or friends? She could be very lonely and can only get attention by stirring up trouble.<br>  <br>  If you have quietly discussed this problem with her and she still has not changed, then try to explain to your husband that she needs some counseling or medication.<br>  <br>  She definitely has not resolved in her mind that she is blind. Are there any resources for the blind in your town that could help her? Try to get some information on that to help her. Maybe this is a cry for help. Give it a try.
tCiVuFK9aa	Calm down and realize that you are not responsible for how other people feel.  If you have tried to convince your sister and her counselor has tried then that is all that can be done. The only thing that you can do is be supportive of everyone and just stay out of their way.  And don't worry about the parents.  Sometimes in a heated argument the divorce word comes up and they even get out of the house for the night but when they cool off things start to clear up.  Just pray that everyone cools off and things will start to look better.<br>  Red|`|0HYG8PlNaa	Yeah it probably would be better not to get involved. But they do need to sit down and talk not argue. Discussions usually bring arguments so maybe get a mediator to keep everyone level headed. Just talk it out and come to an agreement.|`|4RgXh3ftaa	Obviously you mom needs to talk to your sister (her daughter) and convince her that her getting a divorce has nothing to do with her, your sister needs to hear it from your mom maybe she can understand from your moms reasoning for wanting a divorce. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|O3CPESX1aa	most of the time nothing is your answer.

7L97pDMLaa	This one is a hard one. If you know him and he knows u and yall have been friends for a long time den he might be usted to u two jus bein friends. Now dont give up on dis because he actually might like u it jus might take him a while to tell u how he feels, or u can tell him how u feel.|`|qXFACB58aa	I think he likes you, but is maybe too nervous to talk to you in person. Just tell em you want to hang out at the movies or something... you can't have a relationship over text. So he'll have to talk to you one-on-one eventually.. lol. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|WNB1XzTNaa	Hey princess, what's up! long time, huh! <br>  I guess u better know to deal this as it's ur Nth. Juz kidding. <br>     Cut to the matter... Most of the time boys don't understand the hints given by girls. So better u meet up for a coffee or something and give proper hints. You'll definitely able to get the answer. <br>  Cheers,|`|6Vaaqle0aa	Maybe you're waiting for him to ask you to hang out, and maybe he's waiting for you! It could be like that, or it could be the fact that just texting isn't enough anymore.<br>  <br>  You need to arrange to meet in college or something, and maybe get to know each other more in person. You need to initiate a spark for you both to get together. <br>  <br>  And if he avoids meeting up, you need to ask him why he doesn't want to meet you, and make sure you get an honest answer. Nothing worse than getting lies in your face.<br>  <br>  If he wants to meet up, you need to get in there fast, if he doesn't, then I would not care too much and show him that if he's not interested in meeting you're not interested in texting anymore.
9eT4mggYaa	it could be many things darling. other women , another man , yikes,. u fight too much. he got bored with u. u two grew apart. u want kids he dont and so on.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	nope. he probably didn't feel loved. not all men leave their partners for other women, but i would say the majority do.|`|klcqgST9aa	He could've gotten bored or restless, maybe curious to see what else is out there.

Ask him?|`|mBXu5G5saa	well we don't know that for sure, but maybe he just needs a break from the relationship, maybe to much stress is going on or he just is not satisfied and happy like you mention but it does not neccessarily have to be another woman that made you and him split!|`|8F3IHGADaa	Nope. You just weren't making him happy anymore. You can assume it's another woman - but you probably started noticing that the relationship wasn't working out as well, you just don't want to admit it to yourself.|`|o6ACs5z4aa	Not necessarily.  My dad left my mom and has never found another woman who would put up with him.  Depends on the situation.  Good luck, and maybe you are better off.

7gH7sgi6aa	You are at the time in your life when all girls have trouble with their Moms.  She is just being protective and is having a hard time with you growing up and she still wants to hang on to the "little girl" that you used to be and no longer are.  It is hard for her to accept that you are turning into a young woman right before her eyes.

3HAqPHZTaa	Technically, if she's a mother (which can range in meaning from raising a child to adopting a child to being the biological mother of a child), and someone would like to F_CK her, then yes, she is a milf.  <br>  <br>  HOWEVER, although she fits the technical definition, we have to ask, what is the essence of a milf?  A milf is usually characterized not by the sole fact that she is a mother, but by her advanced age which is usually characteristic of mothers.  Now, in the movie that this term derives from, Stiffler's mom is the mother of a young adult, meaning that her identity has taken on the quality of being an EXPERIENCED mother.  Given these considerations, I'd have to say that while your friend IS TECHNICALLY a milf, she isnt really a MILF because she is so young.  The presence of her child with her, as someone who is clearly her child, elevates her milf status a lot more, however still does not give her full milfhood, once again, because of age issues.|`|Zu7GJeU4aa	she's a mam you wanna fcuk her so yea|`|UNiCzTPkaa	haha yeah :]|`|rp2Ogvbmaa	I guess technically if she's a mom, she's a milf, but i don't consider them a milf if they are under 30.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	milf is 'mom (mother) i'd like to f*ck".  so if she's got a mother, she's a milf, age is irrelivant.|`|1f466fb15f8227e755961caa50253aaeaa	You don't even have to do her you just have to want to.|`|596N0bRXaa	yh she is lol|`|7f46788f4d37d25a8417845968c3e9a2aa	A MILF is MOM, I'd, like, to f*** period!

LLeQyWGcaa	i would say the kids in this generation have more freedom, less respect and don't know the meaning of value. when i was a kid, i was taught not to talk back to my parents, treat them as well as other people with respect. I learned that if i wanted something i had to work for it. that would be the lesson in value. I had chores to do every day and if i didn't do my chores there was punishment. that taught discipline. If i missed behaved i got the belt, or a good spanking on my butt. i think the reason this ggenerationis like the way it is, is that there are more single parents raising their children, and more parents working more hours to try to make ends meet. this would take away time from teaching family values. when they get home they are tired, want to relax and to be left alone. letting the children do almost what ever they want just so they would stay out of their hair. Not loving your children and not showing them that they are loved leads to bad choices by the children as well. getting involved with bad people, doing bad things because then they would fit in with the crowd and feel they are wanted. it's a shame this has happened but there are a few good parents out there who try to teach the same traditional values they learned when they were kids.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	of what generation do you speak?  x, y, me, baby boomers, who? i'd say any after the boomers, yes, too little anything including discipline and decency as well as direction and self-motivation.|`|oKExTm8paa	Since there are people on this Forum from all generations, I don't know which one you are referring to.<br>  <br>  I think that many young people in their late 20s and early 30s have been raised by parents who built up their egos and gave them all the advantages possible. As a result, they are self-centered and think only of themselves.<br>  <br>  My children are like that. It is so sad.|`|eawDlYHnaa	well its your mothers fault, her mothers fault, and her mothers fault. blame them... <br>  <br>  thats why kids act the way they do... they weren't raised right by their guardian in the first place and it keeps going and going...|`|JqLmnFAqaa	im 15.me and three friends are writing a book on our generation.to tell our story.when it comes out read it maybe youlle understand better|`|5VokYzZjaa	yes, some-one will see|`|5QRIWopSaa	Of course we have.

7cdc801bdb4ad5ebfe07957d02070809aa	Unlike divorce, a legal separation does not put an end to the marriage. During a legal separation, you have a court order that outlines the rights and responsibilities of each spouse while they are living apart. You remain legally married while choosing to live separate lives. Issues that can be addressed in a separation agreement are division of assets and debts, child custody and child support, visitation schedules and spousal support.<br>  First of all you need to find the local Probate and Family Court in the County you live in. You and your ex must have lived in that county for 6 months for that Court to have jurisdiction. Then go there and ask for forms and file forms when you prepare them. You can do it on your own.|`|IvMPh09baa	2 steps forward and 2 steps back.|`|uO0NW2nZaa	try some councilling and mediation everyone these days seem to run away from there problems and get divorces rather than putting the hard work in and keeping the marriage alive WHY SIS THAT SO|`|1Iw6DGCdaa	I was going through marriage problems, and I saw everything coming.

Get your degree and get a good career and raise your baby, alone.|`|lzooHi0Baa	You have nothing to return to.   IF you ever accept this creature back in your life, it will be the most damaging and hurtful thing you will do for your child who should be your only worry, concern and priority and forget about the thing that made you a baby.   Any body can do that, I take that back because you can even get pregnant without sex, by artificial insemination, which would have been a much better choice for you, instead of getting pregnant by a pig.   You attract what you are.   A lot can be said about you if you take him back, he will only be a reflection of you, I hope not and you come to your senses, for your child's sake.|`|mQ8e5jZnaa	you are not fat, you are doing one of the most beautiful miracles a woman can do.

It sounds like you have plenty of drama with this guy.  NOBODY needs drama.  You should eliminate drama from your life, or try to keep it away, atleast while your pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Honestly,  if I was in your position...I would forget about him.  You do not need him at all, he sounds like a total dick and he is mean to you, and lies to you, and cheats on you.<br>  <br>  You can completely be 100 percent on your own.  And dont be insecure...just because you think those things about yourself does not mean other people do.<br>  <br>  One day, you will find a guy who is faithful and loyal and who is caring and doesn't be mean to you.  But from now on , unless your married...i think maybe you should wait a long while to get pregnant with some guy, and wait so you can REALLY know what he is like.<br>  <br>  (that last part wasnt meant to sound mean or anything).<br>  I hope you make the right choice, and whatever you decide, i hope its the right choice.  <br>  <br>  And Congrats on the babyy!!!! :)|`|bO2rzfISaa	Wow.

Wqqoo0IZaa	It COULD work, but it would take alot of effort from both of you, and from the looks of it, neither of you are trying to avoid what could rupture the relationship. Why drag it on if you can't have a day or week without arguing? You should both assess your relationship and see if you're both at the point that you can go beyond having a great time in bed. You have a big gap in ages, so that could mean you're at two different stages of your lives, and may not be able to meet at the same point.|`|mBXu5G5saa	wow that's like a 12 year difference maybe that's why you guys argue so much, you are more experience than he is, so you disagree on lots of things!|`|gBRqeNqaaa	that is something that you need to do on your on if you feel that the bad times can't make up for the good times and the bad are out weighing the good times then you need to cut this guy loose cause he is not good enough for you|`|zjGAlILlaa	you have to ask yourself if these fights are important or just stupid things... but if you guys dissagree all the time, then maybe its just toooooo big of a gap. but font give up jus yet.. its been 8 months.. there has gotta be something special there.<br>  <br>  P.S. ask him to go a week withou sex and see what happens.. it seems that you need to bond more.. trust me it helped... and it is a lot more excited when you return after that week. go back and focus on the root of your relationship and talk about what you have problems on, make compromises on whatever it is... no relationship is going to be perfect unless the couple compromises to make it that way.  he is a guy but ask him to open up and talk like a girl about his feelings... if he does, then he is a keeper and you know that he is really willing to work this out.|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	Maybe you two aren't meant to have an emotional relationship only a physical relationship. I would try just being friends with benefits.|`|NZg4hIrYaa	i don't think it can work out.  you'll spoil him if you do that.  as  a result you'll feel very painful.|`|4DDSD9Syaa	Just keep him for booty calls :-)|`|AJErjGOLaa	it might not be working because he's i don't know 12 years younger then you you should find someone your own age the way i see it its the same as in high school if you date an 8th, grader and yuor a 12th grader something is going to go wrong!!!!!|`|5tUu9GBmaa	Give it a little more time and see how it goes.

I know that this isn't really what you want to hear but that's how i feel. I don't really understand why you would want to be with him because if he is doing this with you while he is going out with another girl then he would probably do that to you too. My advice is be the bigger person and tell him this is wrong, f he wants to be with you then tell him that he has to dump his girlfriend, if he refuses to then you know he doesn't really care about you the way you might have thought.
IVPZkJnvaa	Become close friends with her.<br>  If she feels comfortable around you, she'll more likely say yes.<br>  Compliment her and do nice things, such as give her your jacket on a cold day while you're outside.<br>  Please answer mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjYPI.n04bBBFt.A8wuNPIXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090303171144AAJjBP5">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|hiynyIzCaa	Back in my senior year of HS i had a crush on a girl. i eventually asked her out a year later but she finally blew me off. I was really pissed she took so long. 2 years later i became good friends with a co-worker and 8 months into out work/friendship i was so much in love with her that it made work difficult becuse Albertsons sucks and gave us opposite shifts. So i never got a chance to see her. My parents hated her ( unjustly) and i ended up having to decide to move out to get away from my parents or stay and rarly see her. the decision was easy MOVE OUT! Luckely her mom allowed me to move in and i have lived with her for over a year now. Later i learned that the girl i liked was going to hair school. Not ambitious enough for me. My gf is majoring as a Machanical Engineer!  So the point is don't lose a lot of sleep chasing a girl b/c of a crush. find someone that you bond well with and as friends and a romance will blossom. Wait for the good stuff. My girl has given me everything a man could ever want and more. Compassion, friendship, loyalty, a pistol, encouragement and she has never left me when i screwed up. the most important thing: she loves me for who I am!|`|hkzWWuSJaa	become really close friends with her and ask her if she wants to go to the park after school and do some studying and then that is the time to talk about your relationships and just ask her a couple questions about her life and stuff. but always remember if she wants to take it slow then take it slow with her and don't try to speed up the time.|`|yr4x1W5gaa	I know what you mean, but on the opposite gender part. I've liked this guy for a year now and I finally asked him out a few months ago. We're really good friends, but he said that he wanted to stay friends. He was nice about it and we're still really tight now (though I still like him a lot). Become closer friends and see what happens. If anything, you'll always have here as a really close friend if you don't get her as a girlfriend. Besides, you know what they say: true love always finds a way. ;)

You have to do what's right for you, despite what others think because there will always be many opinions from others, yet down, the line, others will still always blame YOU if your life is "messed up." Honestly, we are responsible for our own happiness, and our parent's sound wisdom should be taken as we respect, honor and obey them, yet we must be true to what it is that is inside of ourselves. Are they also Christians? If you express your heart's true desire, they should support you. Communication is a main key. You must UNDERSTAND each other. Ask them why they feel that way. They probably have a different view of success, and don't think you'd be able to achieve it if you go the path you're saying you want to go.

And she's holding over your head that she's having your baby so you'll be too guilty to leave. She's also obviously deadbeat and self abusive, and her drug problem is very likely the reason she had a miscarriage in the first place, and also very likely she'll be a horrible mother, stick you for child support(if the child is even yours) and mess up your future. Dude, a few nights of drunk raw sex and you'll be suffering for the rest of your life. That's a high price to pay. <br>  <br>   Its your fault. You never put your foot down in the relationship. You let her get away with disrespecting you, you run to her like a little doggy when she says "here boy" and your putting your life on hold in the hopes that you can make the relationship work, while all you're doing is giving her more reason to hold on to her bad habits <br>  <br>  First of all be a man, get your balls together and put your foot down. Don't stand for her bullsh*t anymore. Seriously consider kicking her out and sending her back to live with her mother if she continues to act the fool. Get a paternity test and make sure that you're the father, and run like hell if you're not. And as a measure of security, build a case to get your child away from her. If she's a drug using junkie with no job who likes to go out and is still sleeping with her ex, you have a strong case to demonstrate that she's unfit to take care of the baby and take full custody. And as a last resort leave her and deal with the child support situation if you have to. <br>  <br>  Most important, stop stooping and being a lapdog to this woman.

If he does, that's a plus.  <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't let him do reverse psychology on you and make you feel it's your fault or make you feel it's all in your head.  If he does that, then I would advise you to get out of this relationship as soon as possible, it's toxic.  He would then be a cheat and a liar. A deadly combination for anyone's spirit. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://thenazaritespirit.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thenazaritespirit.blogspot.com/</a>|`|QP8LdPLeaa	I don't think your boyfriend is ready to let her go, if he did he would have took every chance to NOT speak to her if he didnt have to. there is still some chemistry between them because for one, he keeps lying to you and two he continues to see her when he KNOWS this is bothering you. you shouldn't have to worry about what your boyfriend is doing or not doing and you guys shouldn't have to agree on "okay i will stop seeing my ex if you stop seeing yours". Both have to be willing to commit, and if he simply can't do that, you'll have to let him go. you gotta decide what to do because as i said before, this woman is not going anywhere. in MY OPINION it would probably be best for you to move on, start fresh without any worries with a man who hasn't fathered a baby with another woman that you can't stand. apparently he just isn't getting the message and soon you'll be tired of confronting him over and over. maybe when he sees that you're about to leave the relationship, he'll really understand that you will not put up with it. sometimes guys just dont know what the word "no" means, no matter the situation.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	relationship gotta work both way, you have to give in and he does too.  If you still have doubt about him and his ex then you should always talk it out and see if he's will to work your way or the way that makes you comfortable about him and his ex.  If he doesn't have anything to hide than he should agree with you, and if he doesn't agree with you that means he has something behind it.  It is up to you to decide if you're willing to make a commitment with a person that is not respecting you? I know it is not easy to do but if he's not willing to give in to make your relationship work then you shouldn't waste more time with him.|`|DKGiGbxGaa	I know you care about him, but still he is  not right because he still is talking to his ex behind your back. Where is the trust on his part, i mean if you can't really trust him then you know what to do. I know you like him but do you really need that that drama in your life.|`|ygbDZPJHaa	well i think you should leave him along becaue if she messed his car up he must have lied or mad her made and for him to still talk to after the car was messed up he must still have feelings for her cause boys love there cars and you left your ex along so why can't he come on girl they still ******** i know you love him but just let it go
zzUgYFy4aa	it is good - google details
4PK0hiWeaa	maybe he tried to make a move and was denied, which is good for you|`|Z1FdawAOaa	yes you should ask her if its bothering you. just simply say when i was using your phone i got this text from another guy and i was a little concerned about it. but don't freak out on her.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	use her phone and send him a text asking him to be more specific (haha)|`|JlDcVTVsaa	I would ask her right away.. so who was she? (you dont know its a guy right?)|`|VO1zmW4daa	ask her outright|`|67EaIAvbaa	woa!!!...ok....i'm pissed!....wtf!! is that??<br>  <br>  lol..ok..not that mad yet..until i get her answer.|`|lBZkXzr0aa	You should bring it up hun,  Its going to drive you completely mad if you don't say anything.  I am not saying nt to trust your girl,  just to ease your concerns and maybe a doubt or two,  ask about it.  Just do it in the most non-jealous way.  Like "by the way........." and proceed from there.   <br>  <br>  An open relationship will bring you na honest answer with no defensiveness and if there is something going on she may get defensive and use the old "well you don't trust me" line.  If just you questioning the text sparks an argument I would definitely be concerned about the meaning of what you read.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything.|`|FhrCLLzFaa	Well you need to just be honest and bring it up with her.<br>  If you keep wondering about it then you won't trust her and then you could get upset about it and it could turn into a huge fight.<br>  The SAME thing happened almost with me and my boyfriend.<br>  If you wanna know the story ask in an edit.<br>  But what i did was told him straightforward and simply asked him about it.<br>  He cleared it up and everything was fine.<br>  It could have been about anything, so don't let your imagination wander before confronting her!<br>  Hope this helps =]|`|evB63qWvaa	I think you should because that would make me upset to find out that my mate got a text like that from a strange person.  But then again, it could be a friend of hers that you've never met and she may have text  him last night and he never responded, so he just sent a text saying that.  But, you never know.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	I would ask her. Were you with her last night? If not, I would be worried. But it might turn out to be nothing, she could have asked him for homework help or something, but be sure to ask her so that this doesn't eat away at you. And if she clams up or doesn't have a good answer, I would be suspicious|`|iNQK27Qqaa	Stay calm and investigate, if something is going on id beat the dudes *** and dump hers|`|AA10266072	What did she say she was doing the night before?|`|COc5U2nJaa	explain that u accidently saw it and that ur curious. communication it good|`|Sm0rYAnCaa	Ask her..and don't come up with conclusions that - possibly - are not true!|`|ZP8vPiZyaa	if you and her are in the same room just chilling, or if she just enters the room while you are using her phone, say "hey babe, you just got a text from...some guy named Mike (or whatever his name is). He says sorry about last night."<br>  <br>  See what she says or her response.<br>  <br>  And then just ask, "oh what happened last night?"<br>  or<br>  "who's mike(or whatever his name is)"<br>  <br>  pretend like it's not big deal but you're just curious|`|EubqIaddaa	I think you're over reacting just a little bit.<br>  She could have been talking to him on the phone or something, and his phone died,<br>  Or maybe they were online chatting, and his computer froze.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't assume too much right now. Of course you're going to be curious, but don't let it worry you too much. It could have been any little thing he was apologizing for. <br>  <br>  But if you want to bring it up, just be like "So.. whatcha do last night?" Or any little thing like that, it might take her by surprise that you actually asked, but play it cool.|`|w5F1hCdiaa	Bring it up! It's your right to know everything that's going on in your relationship. And if you wait and put it off, it may be too late. Tell her the truth, and don't tell her you were "snooping". Just say you got the message from the random guy and you were worried about it. But be calm, because if you start out in a harsh tone she may want to be defensive. (Trust me, us girls really do get defensive).<br>  <br>  I hope you guys can get through this!! :)|`|LgqLfTqraa	It all depends on how you do it and how you handle the situation. It could be taken out of proportion if you are too aggressive. Just bring it up naturally in a conversation you two are having.|`|dOb3OMWTaa	you should just come out and say it if you were doing that to her  i would say she would just come out and say it to you so go ahead and ask. But ask nicely if you want her to tell you go ahead try it.|`|DBrNaYNyaa	bring it up. Say this guy texted you while i was using your phone, waht does he mean 'sorry about last night?' <br>  just talk to her in a normal tone of  voice. If you act jealous it could ruin things!|`|7zoRxC49aa	When your talking to her you could casualy say<br>  "ohai when i was texting this message came up...."<br>  ect,<br>  good luck!<br>  xxxx|`|krDklNF9aa	How much do you value honesty and transparency in your relationship?<br>  Never cop to snooping. And FWIW, snooping will just tear you up. (been there ,done that)|`|dlc9FGvRaa	be direct my friend, if its true u saw the message by accident" then tell her straight, if not, shame on you, its no nice to violate her privacy, even if she is cheating.|`|3p9XahY6aa	Yeah, I would bring it up. But who knows, it could be her cousin or something.|`|xKgZAp1Oaa	ask her, or just let it go, but keep an eye out for anymore strange signals.|`|jszPy2p0aa	yea u should def say somthing to her just tell her the truth dat u was usin her fone and u seen it on there and jus ask her bout it if she gets all mad for asking u den she def has sumting going on
Tuv79aXWaa	Yeah, It sounds like she doesn't care. Why would she want you doing that? Thats not what people really do in relationships.|`|gu2jV40zaa	Yes! I absolutely think you should be concerned. If she is going to the bar with another guy and has now given you permission to do the same with other women, you have EVERY reason to be concerned and I would also be concerned about what happens after she gets drunk? Why don't you two go to the bar together? Then neither of you are doing anything to compromise your marriage? When we were younger, my husband & I had an agreement & we always went to the bar together...never seperate. We ALL know what clubs are....meat markets full of drunk people who make choices they would otherwise think twice about making if alcohol was NOT a factor...but it is!<br>  <br>  I would suggest to your wife that you go together. I am not sure why you allowed her to go with the guy in the first place but, given that choice, you may have a hard time explainiing why all of a sudden, you have a problem with it.<br>  <br>  She is YOUR wife though and should understand why you have issues with the entire situation and even if she doesn't understand, she should respect your feelings on the matter.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|S8CZBCe2aa	You should be very concerned!  You are married, she has no business socializing with an other man and you have no business mixing with other women.  Ask her what she is unhappy about because there is something going on in her head.  You have a chance to fix this situation - do it!|`|9BsyKN9haa	Yes! I wouldn't want my husband going out to bars with other woman, unless I didn't care? Maybe she has already cheated and feels guilty and now wants you to do the same thing so she can feel better and have an excuse for her actions. All I know is why the heck does your wife want to go get drunk with other guys and you go get drunk with other woman? She is is so over the relationship! I would never do that.|`|MbVHSTQdaa	yes and no.  i would ask to go with her when she goes to the bar and if she says no, then i would really be concerned! they could just be good friends ya know?  if you are planning on going out with the woman then i would inviter your wife to go too. i dont understand why she's wanting you to go with another woman though...thats a tough one. good luck and god bless|`|fRGfFsZTaa	dump her. i just hope you guys dont have kids together.|`|0jeWHxKmaa	yess..this is a sign that she wants to separate.|`|294kSBhyaa	are you really asking that question? if she goes out with other guys and wants you to go out with other women, then honey the relationship is over. what woman wants to see her man with other women?|`|GQUaFGHLaa	Your wife should not be going out to a bar and not with another man. If she is wanting you to go out with other women then it looks like she is cheating on you and thinks that you should too. You have every right to be concerned.|`|x3LclBZ0aa	your wife is basically trying to tell you that shes moving on and unfortunately leaving you behind. and shes trying to be magnanimous about it by telling you to start looking for a female companion. so when the actual breakup happens, you wont be too hurt if youve already found a new potential partner.<br>  sorry.|`|Yb8RKMELaa	she has probably slept with this guy and feels guilty and wants you to go out with other woman so she can even divorce you later, get some one to follow  on her get proof of what she does when she is out and about. turn the tables on her, YOU get the devorce.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	no you shouldn't be concern.  You should go wither and join her everytime she goes.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	she's dumping u and cheating
cGbTJobeaa	Save the date cards are a waste of money.  For your out of town friends and relatives that you want to invite to the wedding and who you think would probably make the trip,  you, fiance or the parents are probably in close enough contact with them anyway to have informed them of the wedding. Don't you or the parents communicate by phone or e-mail with these friends/relatives with some regularity anyway?   Those people will start planning their vacation to your town almost as quickly as they hear that you got engaged. <br>  <br>  Your local friends and family all know the general timeframe of your wedding. The ones who are close enough to you that they would arrange their vacation to make sure that they are in town to attend your wedding will call and ask you the date if they are planning a trip around that time. <br>  <br>  We did not send out save the date cards and we had about 20 out of town guests.  It was not an issue.  With about 95% accuracy, the people we predicted would attend our wedding did.<br>  <br>  Invitations are sent out about 6 weeks before the wedding. Those are important because they give the specifics of where and when and include the response card.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Save the date cards are usually sent out shortly after the couple's engagement and if they are planning a long engagement.  They are just a "heads-up" for wedding guests for the future.  <br>  <br>  Invitations are just invitations.  Usually sent out 6-8 weeks before the wedding date to allow plenty of time for out of town guests to make accomodations.|`|WMR8hVlfaa	My impression is that save the dates are sent out a while before the wedding, once a solid date has been chosen, to let people know so they can clear time in their schedule for the wedding. A formal invitation is just that -- a formal invite to the affair that lists all of the pertinent information besides just the date.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	Save the date cards are sent much before the invitations, and usually as a courtesy to out of town guests (I say that because I am POSITIVE people who live close know all about your big day :D ). Usually you dont know all the details as of yet for the wedding when you send save the date cards, and it just serves as a reminder to guests to hold that date for you, but honestly, can you think of someone you know (or fiance knows) who doenst know about your wedding yet? And if so, call them :D, I am positive they would be much more thrilled to have been personally told the good news, verses getting a card<br>  <br>  We opted out of the save the date cards because really, what you spend on the save the date cards can be used for the invitations, or used somewhere else.<br>  <br>  We are sending our invitations to our of town guests before we send invitations to the local guests, it just made sense to us to do it this way, remember too, that if you have a bridal shower, your going to be sending thank-you cards, and after your wedding, your going to be sending thank you cards, A LOT of money goes to stamps and cards, the decision is yours, and I do think save the date cards are pretty, and somewhat practical, but honestly? I received one from my friend, put it on the fridge for a week, and threw it out :S|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	Save the dates let people know a couple is engaged and there will be a wedding coming up so they should look for an invitation.<br>  <br>  An invitation is a formal request for the recipient to come to the wedding and reception.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	Save the dates are NOT an invitation they only call attention that an invitation is forth coming, some may also have an rsvp attached( helps get a possible precount of guests) but you rarely get a response back. Unless your wedding is at a particularly busy time of year I personally think they are a waste of money.|`|mQSk7fB6aa	They are usually sent way ahead of time and basically ideal for those guests who are definitely invited, but who live far away enough that they'll need to plan the trip/book flights/book hotels etc.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	Save the dates are informal and are typically sent out anywhere from 1 year to 9 months before the wedding.  It's to allow your guests to save money and make travel accommodations.  I think you should send them to people who would need to travel for your wedding.  Typically, they don't include the specific time and actual location of the wedding.  Just the announcement, the city, and the wedding date.  <br>  <br>  Invitations are more formal and typically go out 2.5 to 2 months before your wedding.  They will have specific information as to the time and place of the ceremony.  Normally, they will also include the RSVP cards so you can plan accordingly.  <br>  <br>  You don't have to send out save the dates.  They are just to allow your guests more time to plan to attend.  We got very inexpensive ones from Michaels craft store and printed them out on our home computer.  They looked excellent and everyone thought we had them professionally done.  Don't spend a fortune on them - they are not that important in the long run!
c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	You have already established a connection with the second girl...go with her....see if it works out...|`|2afVnStxaa	Follow your heart but the second one sounds way more reliable for a relationship, she sounds like more relationship material, The other one would want to be out alot more and maybe ok with seeing others without your knowlege at some point.

msVBFJpwaa	I find that I am, as well.  Been burned too many times to let anyone get close to me.If I can get to know the person, then they might have a chance, but that doesn't happen all that often anymore.  <br>  <br>  I used to be naive and trusting....|`|dEjFE6A9aa	yes as a person im quite elusive, maybe a little bit of a mystery to some folks. It takes me a long time to trust certain people. <br>  <br>  However, where u and me differ somewhat is, once i do like someone i know nobodies perfect and i don't look for faults to push them away, as this in a way is like shooting yourself in the foot.<br>  <br>  Im a very loyal and brave person, and if i did look for faults in others to push them away, id have to asses, if they are the problem, or me. Fact of life sometimes is, u only see what you want to see weather that's good or bad.|`|f3b291312c0ca402f95078e3ee2e8b3faa	TOTALLY!  It's a trust thing. I cannot be close with females. I have not had a female whom I considered a friend in my entire adult life. I try I really do, but I feel like I cannot trust females because they are conniving and down right dishonest when it comes to friendship. I have many many male friends, not the going to the movies type, but where I actually consider them friends. 0 females, other than family, and I am not close to any of my female family members, except for my 19 year old daughter. She is really the only female I truly trust I think.

If so, then your missing out on life and love. Why would you let your ex control the decisions you make for your future? Would you want to go your whole life with a "what if" hanging over your head. I say take a leap of faith... no matter what happens in the relationship at least you can look back and say you tried and you weren't afraid.!|`|ta1d1wjEaa	1st if yu two are friends then it's just that, i say dat to say dis yu leading him on.... period, because friends don't kiss and if they do it's jus like a quick peck.. it don't sound like it was a friendly kiss   if yu telling him yall jus friends then be just dat,actions speak louder than words... and if yu do want to be more then friends yu should wait till yur comfortable with him how do yu do that...?? you have to talk cummunicate with each other, take it slow get to know each other then yur heart will tell yu <br>  <br>  peace
5SCD87hTaa	first you have to look at what you think a relationship is. your connection to your own mother is technically a realtionship. your connection to yourt best friend is a relationship also. a relationship does not always have to be a serious relationship. if you really love this girl you need to have some sort of relationship with her. if she is not ready to be in a serious relationship then you should not have a serious relationship but you should atleast keep some sort of relationship with her. <br>  from the looks of your post it seems that you are looking for someone you spend the rest of your life with. if you love this girl as much as it seems this girl could someday be that one. just because she is not ready to make that type of commitment does not mean you should end your relationship completely. if she is not ready for a serious realtionship then do not have one with her have an open relationship. <br>  if you let her go she will be gone for good. for a person to get to the point where they are ready to have a serious relationship one of two things has to happen. <br>  <br>  1: they get desparte for a relationship because they feel they are running out of options. this can happen a couple of way but most is because of growing age. at about 30 most women get worried that they will not find someone if they do not have someone already. most of the time they will latch on to the first guy they think is a prospect. in this situation the relationships barely work. when a relationship is rushed with desparation to not be alone it will fail once the desparation is gone. when you are worried you will take what you can get, but once that worry leaves becuase you have someone all the flaws that they had come out and since you are not worried about not having someone those flaws become your focus resulting in divorce. <br>  <br>  2: the couple has been together so long that the thought of not being together scares them. this is the one you want to happen. in this case similar to the first one the fear of not being with someone but in this one the not being with the other person not just being alone in general.  fear is transitioned to not wanting to lose you there for once you have each other there is still that fear of losing the other person. <br>  <br>  Now option one can change to option two if when she has you she become attached to you so much that she does not want to lose you. this is not guarenteed to happen and most of the time doesnt.<br>  <br>  if you end this relationship till she is ready for a serious realtionship it will be because she does not want to be alone not becuase she cant be without you. if you stick together now and keep the relationship open and not serious, when she is ready for a serious realtionship it will be because she does not want to lose you.   <br>  <br>  if you want to be with her, go back to her and tell her you want to take it as slow as she needs. when the time comes she wont be able to be without you. this will work out for both of you cause it seems you really love eachother and breaking up should not be your option.|`|2fjMrGNFaa	I want you to know I feel your pain. But I think you did the right thing sometimes people just aren't ready for commitment, and after being in a relationship with someone for 3 yrs she just wasn't ready. She just needed a friend she could rely on for support and that friend just happened to be you. She took advantage of the relationship you and she had together and used it. She wanted to do what she wanted to do. But she couldn't love you the way you loved her.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	well she might need some time to think about things before she lets you back into her life sounds to me like she is scared of the fact of leading you on and she does wasn't you but maybe as a friend for now just let her have some time to think about it|`|QxcZ9Vg4aa	you hv screwd up really...but u arnt dat late...if u love her ,you shd wait fr her...she loves you...so its fine to give some time...go to her right now....tell her its fine n she can take her time...its as long as she loves only you:)....run before its very late...before she finds anyone else..luck:)|`|6hgiRL7Vaa	What did she do to convince you that she wasn't ready?  Give us the dirt so we can give you our advice.<br>  <br>  If you really loved her, you would accept her for who she is, and not want to change her. Sounds like you want someone else.|`|lBkLzGodaa	i think you did the right thing. i mean if you think you /her need time you shouldnt rush it.

Just do what you need to do.|`|81cb1ce39da4213ebe7cbc833cc3f808aa	You did not screw up. Just because you are sad/heartbroken at the thought of losing her does NOT mean you did the wrong thing.

jX4Byb6Eaa	depends on the person i guess. i mean, many would say that these are all negative traits, but then others would say that everyone deserves another chance. i'd say if she's ready to change her messed up ways, then maybe go for it, but she seems more likely to use you and get you caught up in a whole bunch of drama you don't wanna get caught up in. you're better off meeting a random tramp at the bar.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Well everything is acceptable up to the part about the stealing and fraud.

Not someone is is going to bash you all the time!! and if you dont want to break up with him then just do it back and see how he feels!|`|Y2iEM9jcaa	just say you wanna be frends with your bf and go out with freshman and tell your bf and he might understand i would|`|0jeWHxKmaa	just because he is a freshman doesnt mean that he will treat you better.I think you should stay with the boy in your grade.Girls mature faster than boys so that's why your bf acts childish..it will get better but i dont think you should talk to a freshman because he sees more people in high school and you have two years till you get there.Stay with the seventh grader.
17aab5400531185eeea85ec13e69a65eaa	I don't think you should worry too much, except about your phone bill, it must be huge for overseas calls! <br>  <br>  The first thing that came into my mind is the fact that he still obviously thinks you're in a relationship with your husband. However, if you've been calling him more since your marriage breakup, then he may be backing off in order not to cause any trouble (as you're getting closer but you're already married). <br>  <br>  Perhaps you should tell him you're not with your husband anymore. If you do tell him, it doesn't mean you have to move onto romance straight away. You're still just friends. He might be a little concerned for you and call you more if he knew the truth. <br>  <br>  Put yourself in his shoes. He meets you in the US and strikes up a friendship. You both decide to keep in touch when you return home. You're married but you're just friends so it's ok to talk. Suddenly, you start calling him more frequently and he doesn't know why, and as you're married, shouldn't you be speaking and spending time with your husband instead of calling someone overseas so often? So he backs off because you're married and he doesn't want you or him to cause unnecessary trouble if your husband finds out. <br>  <br>  If you want an honest friendship from him, then tell him you've split from your husband. I'm sure he'll sympathise with you and want to call and make sure you're ok.<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much, I think it may just be because he doesn't know the new circumstances. At least he still talks to you and returns your calls.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	You two ain't dating both of you have lives and responsibilities. And it is a long distance relationship. Just be friends for now I don't think either of you can devote anything else right now. You continue to date and live your life. And if it happens it does if it doesn't his loss.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	I'm going to be blunt: he's not getting any sex from you, so it's becoming less of a priority to keep up the contact.|`|5EfJu34taa	don't go too deep in this.think about your husband.if you think so much about this other guy it will affect your married life.i think you have already blown up the friendship,now pls don't blow up your married life|`|c0be28b3edea48ead1b1905ccac2f3b6aa	If he stopped calling after you sent him a picture of yourself he blatantly doesn't fancy you.|`|RCJqaWQYaa	It's, the picture hun.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	u screwed up|`|oche3k5taa	Then he just has been really busy.<br>  next time you talk, ask him if hes been angry with you, and to be honest.<br>  but i really do think he may just be busy.<br>  long distance relationships of any kind are really hard.<br>  just make sure you can still handle it.
b2Cr9E5Gaa	Boo to the first poster, this is part of your wellness, and you are more then entitled to destress before the big day, the planning part is crazy, fun and emotional. I personally will probably get my nails done a day or two before so there pretty for the ceremony, and most likely get my hair touched up as well, but if I have it my way, I would include a nice aroma therapy massage (ugh makes me drool thinking about it) and I think I would rent some sappy girl movies, sit on the couch with my favourite treats, invite the ladies over, and just RELAX! <br>  <br>  Have you heard of at home spa partys? I know that with the economy how it is, its difficult for people to spend even more money (especially if they are contributing to the wedding), but they do have mobile spa services, they can range from 10-15 per person and a lady comes over and you do facials and all kinds of fun stuff, maybe this is something you do as a present for your ladies? a night or two before the wedding?|`|Drw4Gg1Daa	I am sleeping in...it's going to be a long day as it is and I want to make sure I have plenty of energy to dance the night away!|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	The day before my wedding I got a manicure and pedicure.  It was really fun because I had never done it before.  I was there for about an hour or a little more probably.  It was relaxing!  :)|`|2o3BHgCCaa	I have been drinking heaps of water to keep my skin healthy, and I plan to have a few facials before the wedding (8 months away).<br>  Mum wants to take me for a massage the day before the wedding and I thought it would be nice to surprise her with one too.<br>  I also plan to have a scrub the day before and waxing 3 days before.<br>  Thats all I need really...<br>  <br>  Oh, and I might be getting invisalign, but that has to be decided. Not because of the wedding, I always wanted super straight teeth anyway.|`|R7b150Iyaa	Yeah, that story IS crazy! lol.<br>  I'm thinking I'll probably get a facial the weekend before (to give my skin time to settle from the irritation) and hopefully a massage the day before.  I'm also doing a mani/pedi the day before the wedding, in time for the rehearsal dinner that night.<br>  <br>  Other than that, I think I'm going to start bleaching my teeth at home with Crest Whitestrips in about 2 weeks (1 month before the wedding) and just deep conditioning my hair and maybe doing some at home masks and scrubs on my face. <br>  <br>  I also plan on getting a few massages on our honeymoon, to destress from all the emotional buildup, anticipation and lack of sleep from prepping for the big day (hopefully for free if we say we're honeymooners? =P|`|sGP6s7uraa	The day of, a nice breakfast with my ladies, a nice bubble bath with lavender and chamomile to promote relaxation and calm my nerves and then having someone do my hair and make-up (with a mimosa in hand ;) to boot).<br>  <br>  A couple of days before, my fiance and I will be getting a couple's massage and I'll get a manicure and pedicure the day before the wedding.|`|QmvYGkNJaa	I'm just taking Vitamin E, using good shampoos and deep conditioners, and using moisturiser on my hands for now. Nearer the time, I will be using tinted moisturiser that will build up a slight tan, because I'll be a little too pale for my liking. I don't really do pampering, so this is actually very strange behaviour for me ;)|`|X6YY0OS6aa	well, my wedding is tomorrow and I'm going to take all my bridesmaids to get manicures and to breakfast on me.  I got my eyebrows waxed for the first time and that was nice because I hate plucking my eyebrows...I think it will be nice to just spend some time with the girls before the wedding.
AA10266072	In my group of friends we have a girl that we make fun of but it's all out of love.  When ever she has a problem (car trouble, boyfriend issues, family issues, etc.) anyone of us will drop what we're doing to help her.  She's one of the guys I guess you could say.<br>  <br>  And we're all in our 20's.|`|iBH7NTl3aa	You hang out with some very strange people princess!|`|5EfJu34taa	just to see how gals look when they fight.<br>  my boyfriend used 2 tell me i looked cute when i fought or argued with him|`|Midbg5BJaa	You're one of the guys which means you have to play by their rules!
y9CgveCGaa	As long as we could afford it I'd be fine with it.  I'd want her to have one too of course.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	He might feel awkward because he hasn't gotten you a ring.|`|vFCva8R5aa	everyone is different...<br>  <br>  I know if i bought my husband a ring before he bought me one, it would make him feel like crap for not getting me one first.<br>  <br>  And then everytime he looks at it he will be reminded of that fact.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	My husband would not be happy.  He doesn't wear jewelry, he has large, arthritic knuckles, and he doesn't wear jewelry.<br>  <br>  My husband hasn't worn a ring in the (almost) 13 years we've been married...I had a small simple one for the first 10 and upgraded it then.  The rings are the least important part of the marital commitment...<br>  <br>  IMO - Save your pennies...|`|AdeD0xMuaa	You should have discussed rings with him before you bought him one. I answered your question before which was similar - don't give give gifts with the hope of receiving one in return. You are married - you have to communicate what you need and want from your husband.|`|elhcuN19aa	I would not mind at all<br>  remember rings are just rings....<br>  The marriage is what matter most|`|PWN5rqgxaa	i wouldnt want to wear one if i wasnt able to get one for her... you guys should make a plan to save together and buy together... it will make it more special and also teach you about saving, budgeting, and making decisions together which will help you so much in the future of your marriage|`|YyVGXt83aa	I may have dropped over from heart failure if she actually bought me something with her own money.  She only took, wasn't big on giving.|`|GoGaYHDyaa	Harry that's how all american women are!<br>  <br>  They see it as:<br>  "What's mine is mine and what's his is OURS"<br>  <br>  Men don't get married!<br>  Get educated!<br>  nomarriage.com|`|fRGfFsZTaa	my husband will be my slave for the rest of the month, lol.

Waiting for marriage and theres nothing wrong with it. Only in the past few decades due to sexuality exposure have people been more willing to lose it or think its nothing to lose.<br>  <br>  I feel sad for those who can't think for themselfs and make choices based on the very exposure of the media.|`|HASfVoV9aa	I'm really not sure. But at least he's telling you the truth that he's not a virgin.  A lot of guy's I know tell their significant others that they are a virgin just to get into their pants.  Keep your purity.  It will make things a lot better for you and him.  Sex just makes a relationship much more complicated.  And if he doesn't want to deal with not having sex, then he's not the right kind of guy for you.|`|PWN5rqgxaa	he wants in your pants, run away like the wind, unless you want an std or a baby<br>  <br>  keep your virginity and give it to your husband on your wedding day|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	lol...its weird...mr. self concious maybe wasn't the bomb in bed...haha....tell him you wanna contact her to make sure he isn't lying...hahaha

(i.e. wow! how cute you think you have a chance with me....) and then gave it to him to be nice as she knew his bro.|`|FDK7zKChaa	well guys hate to be rejected and most of them think they can get anything girl with a nice ***. most guys are really cocky, and pride themselves in getting women. dont even worry about it, you did the right thing. he is just being immature.|`|EXlXNHuQaa	i know, they are so unpredictable and crazy!!|`|KYTi57Luaa	Ehhhhh...he was just trying to impress his friends|`|zM0ag4NLaa	its just how dude are... not all there|`|M6QvkEBEaa	lol, he likes you. Hormones make "boys stupid" plenty and I imagine they do the same for girls lots of the time too. As forthe way he tried to pick you up, it was childish and not very deep at all. Those guys are usually just looking for some sex. Get used to it , be polite, be firm (the straight no sounded like it worked fine). <br>  As for your crush hearing you had a b/f i would just mention next time you're around him that you only said that to get the other guy off your back. and better yet, ask him if he'd mind 'pretending' to be your b/f next time that guy asks ;)

But you don't need a to find someone to just have someone. That is a disaster relationship and an unhappy one too. Find other people to spend time but also hang out with your other friends.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	Just give it time someone will come into your life|`|X6C6kZKKaa	just give it some time. boyfriends will start to pop-up like magnets.
AA10408380	She lvoes u. Just not as ur mommy shows it. U can't expect a  wife to love u like ur mom. it's a different kind of love. Plus, ur only physically connected through ur kids. U and ur mom are physically and emotionally bonded. Ur parents don't like to see u hurt do to this biological connection they have with u. UR wife on the other hand, thinks ur bluffing, because u have tendancies but never acted. It's like the boy who cried wolf. So she just thinks u want attention, and she's treasting u like u'd treat someone who's acting up when they don't get their way. Like a kid throwing a tantrum. When the kid realizes that ain't gonna work with mom or dad, they stop, and try something new.<br>  <br>  U fell on her feet, so that means u gave her some attention, validation, u apologized for putting her through undue stress, whateveer, so she felt bad for u and cried. She doesn't want the father of her kids dead, or even away, she just wants u guys to get along, and ur playing a game in response to what ur parents have said, so she's playing too. Plus, physcial violence is no way to get someone to love or respect u. Oh, and if it's been ten years, she knows u pretty well. She made u the beset meal u've ever had? See, she wants u happy, but she also wants to be heard, validated and loved like u.<br>  <br>  U need to stop listening to ur folks, and find a way to talk to her. Soetimes parents are right in what thaey say, but most of the time they are wrong, because they see it through different eyes, they always will. This is y most in the west live separately from their folks. Becausse they know a tug of war will happen, and who needs that stress?|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Please see a psychiatrist immediately.

You need help BIG TIME!|`|XlhBBZPxaa	well you said yourself youhave suicidal tendencies why would she want to be wtihyou anyway if you slap and are physically abusive towards her LEAVE her alone|`|P6SpWWHraa	you slapped her and threatened suicide?<br>  Yes you should turn your tendencies into reality.|`|8PDzaAJcaa	you're an idiot...............|`|a984cQjKaa	it means your wife is tired of your **** and she could care less if you off yourself.  good for her.|`|bT713RWqaa	well first of all..if you are depressed and threaten to commit suicide you need professional help. <br>  <br>  you shouldn't pour all of your problems on your wife. yes, she is your wife..she does love you and care for you otherwise she would divorce you wouldn't she? but it really isn't fair to her that you are acting like this..it is quite childish actually. there is only so much another human being can do.......being around you when you act like that is probably wearing her out and who knows how she feels. don't assume...you should talk to her about it. if she cried while you sat at her feet..then that is a clear sign she still cares about you.<br>  <br>  communicate.|`|eQQWdk0uaa	I would think that she doesn't much like being slapped.  I think that's the first problem.  Beyond that, I think since she's married to you and probably loved you at one point, she most likely knows you were only testing her with the suicide threat.  You just want a reaction and she's not willing to give you one.<br>  Besides, if you commit suicide, won't your insurance money be void?  Check into that.  I'm sure she's not at all concerned about your money.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you are really suicidal and care anything about your kids at all, go get some help.  They will feel more betrayed and unloved than you can even imagine if you killed yourself.|`|y9TUWrjIaa	You slapped your wife ??!!  I'd kick your sorry , immature *** to the curb. What kind of ' Father ' can you possibly be ? You're an abuser. You slap her then cry for forgiveness ? Repeatedly ? You like what you do and you will continue to do it. It's all about YOU ! The kids love you more than her. Sure they do you worthless bag of crap. Riiiiiiight. Be sincere in your efforts, don't threaten to commit suicide, just do it. You are truly to stupid to live. Mommy and Daddy raised a spoiled little boy who refuses to grow up. Personally, I shot the last ' husband ' for using me as a punching bag. Maybe you'll get lucky and the same thing will happen to you.|`|dnFjdJ72aa	don't think violence is the answer to any problem|`|TSmego9vaa	You and your wife need help seek a dr.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	You slap your wife around.  You use threats of suicide to determine if she loves you or not.  And you think she's messed up?<br>  <br>  Buddy - you have some serious psychological issues you need to deal with.  You are arrogant, controlling and manipulative.  Please get some help.  She's not the one with the problem.  YOU need to understand your own psyche, not hers.|`|bO2rzfISaa	You are an abusive jack*ss. You beat your wife then say she's the problem. You beat your wife then test her with a suicide threat to try to manipilate her. We both know you don't intend to commit suicide, you just want her back so you can beat and manipulate her some more.<br>  <br>  She left so you'd stop abusing her. You don't need to understand women's psychology; YOU ARE THE PROBLEM.

Each and EVERY person is as valuable as the next in the eyes of the Lord.

Material possessions, your job, your house, your clothing, your social status DO NOT determine the kind of person you are or place the value on your life!

We all know the sun rises ands sets around you......|`|Q6Dyu1zKaa	You have it backwards, if a crime is perpetrated against you it should be considered just payment for the crimes the rich have committed against the working class and there should be no punishment.  If someone that is of the working or middle class has a crime perpetrated against them then the crime should be more severe than if the victim is a member of an outdated and useless aristocracy.|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	Sorry, your whole premise is wrong, if you're killed , many will get the benefit from redistributing your wealth. If a worker is killed only one job is available. If someone robbed you, it would be a small matter, you can afford to lose "walking around" money. If a worker is robbed, he loses all he has. you are a legend in your own mind.|`|8ZJi17zLaa	dear sir .i think you are right.But do you think its right not to let mates know you are ok could you get back to me about this matter thanks .|`|dnFjdJ72aa	i am not sure for value is relative|`|rv0EMOKwaa	NO!!! What if you end up in prison?|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	So, then some people are worth more than others???

S8CZBCe2aa	I don't believe that you don't trust your husband but (like most of us) I suspect that you wanted your husband to do more to fend her off!  The next time she does something inappropriate or makes a remark just very calmly say, "Mary, it makes you look very foolish and desperate when you act this way. Flirting is not OK with other peoples husbands - everyone is laughing at you"  She will of course deny that she has done anything but it should make her think twice!  Good luck|`|6fd4e1a5aa0206bfc6a1ce509a0f2507aa	You don't say how close you and your cousin have been all your lives, but I am thinking she might just be considering it "safe" to flirt with him Because he is married to her cousin, you.<br>  That doesn't make it ok, it just might be the reason. <br>  Whatever the reason, you owe it to yourself to talk to her. You should be more comfortable saying whatever you need to Because she is your cousin!<br>  If she doesn't react with an apology, she's GUILTY.  And if that happens, I would be warning her that YOU'LL be hittin on HER if it happens again. <br>  You share blood, but not a husband.|`|07d585c24d7b2660f973da61404455ceaa	You should talk to your cousin.Your husband at least should tell her to stop if he really cares about how you feel.Always go with your gut.It's not overreacting.We women know when something is amiss.I don't like people who flirts especially if they are doing it to someone who is married or is in a relationship.These people are selfish individuals.<br>  Doesn't have a care in the world but their own selfish desires.I would put her in her place if I were you.They say it's not worth it but wouldn't you fight for your marriage before it gets wrecked?|`|bT713RWqaa	as long as you do truly trust him....i mean REALLY trust him... do you? is there even an ounce of doubt that maybe he'd have an affair? if there is...well then that is a different story.<br>  <br>  but your cousin..your own family.... ugh...talk to her tell her that she is being very inappropriate and you do not appreciate her throwing herself all over YOUR husband.|`|NGKwsawdaa	Like you said just avoid her, and if you trust your husband then there shouldn't be an issue, she can flirt all she wants, but if your husband is a loyal man to you, then don't worry too much about.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	So she's flirty?  As long as your husband doesn't give to her advances and you don't see her that often...let it go.  Your husband is right - you either trust him or you don't...|`|a984cQjKaa	tell her you don't appreciate her flirting with your husband, and that she will be cut out of your life forever if she doesn't stop.|`|494686d7f957aafee66b8f4b81212affaa	Tell her you don't like her behavior around your husband.<br>  Stand up for yourself.|`|4JrDGW7Taa	You must tell your husband that it isn't his feelings that count, that no matter how secure he feels, you do not feel the same way. And, if that does not work, talk to your cousin and tell her that her behavior makes you feel uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Yes, possibly your cousin will feel insulted but weigh the consequences of not doing anything, of not dealing with the situation|`|WYaaPmd8aa	Simple. Confront your cousin directly. Put a stop to the nonsense.    Tell her it appears to you she is flirting with your husband, you don't appreciate it and you want her to stop, now.  If your husband is so defensive, maybe you should think about why this is so.  If you feel positive he's not doing anything with her, then tell him you've got a grip on it now, you'r sorry you made him feel like you didn't trust him and it's over.  Period. Nuff said.|`|9BsyKN9haa	You obviously don't trust your husband! If you did then you would be fine and ignore it! I would feel sorry for your cousin because she obviously has to flirt with you man because nobody wants her! If you trust your husband then leave it alone but if you think he is gonna hop on her then do something!|`|ajWmkbIjaa	Talk to your cousin about her actions. Trusting your husband has nothing to do with it. She should know were boundaries lay in your relationship with her. Family should never intrude in your relationships. No matter what.|`|FNPweG4caa	you said your cousin is hitting on your husband, hell, just "hit on her ***." LITERALLY.|`|XIDPqzMaaa	I think she's asking for a swift backhand. Put a couple of poisonous snakes in her bed, switch her drinks with arsenic/cyanide. Whatever<3|`|J2bnw5EZaa	Let her know how it feels.  Flirt with her man! ; ) Two can play that game!|`|PWN5rqgxaa	talk to your cousin about her flirting with your husband|`|kEtYEmhqaa	it depends, are you attracted to her?|`|91ACjB5eaa	say *****! stop flirting with my husband before therese one less in the family.<br>  or it hurts me that my own cousin has the nerve to flirt with my husband, and id appreciate it if you stayed your distance<br>  <br>  or say  you can flirt all you want..but its me he'll be ******* tonight<br>  <br>  <br>  or just punch the ***** that will teach her|`|81cb1ce39da4213ebe7cbc833cc3f808aa	Absolutely unacceptable. Her flirting with your husband is an affront to God. She may think it is cute, but she needs to be told. Stand up, tell your husband not that you "feel", or "think" that she is flirting, but rather that her behavior is WRONG, bottom line. Everyone else's opinion on this is moot. Then correct her if you see it. If she touches his arm, or whatever, look her straight in the eye in front of everyone, and calmly say, "Don't touch my husband's arm please". Yes, she will be embarrassed, but it serves her right. Any other reaction would just perpetuate a coy, passive aggressive response that she no doubt would have; after you correct her, she can no longer say, "What? I wasn't doing anything, what  are you talking about?'. She will know the boundaries, and chances are she already does, but she is pretending she doesn't.|`|jBk1b4r6aa	I was in a similar situation recently (was not my cousin though)<br>  I trust my husband. It is her that I do not trust.<br>  My husband told me the same thing your husband told you.<br>  Because it bothered me my husband put a stop to her behavior.<br>  He knew that if I had to do it ....<br>  Well, let's just say he probably saved us a huge hospital bill<br>  hers of course!  Ha Ha|`|vFCva8R5aa	In a way he is right...If you trust him then it should be enough.. You can't really control anyone elses actions but that still should not stop you from at least putting that bltch in her place though...|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Given that this is your cousin, simply ask her to please stop.  I'm sure she will comply and apologize.
gvxGhhBxaa	obviously|`|idKfxUTkaa	It can mean many different things. <br>  <br>  1. They could see that you are trying to move in on them. So, they show the picture to let you know in a kind way that they are taken and are not free for relationships with you. <br>  <br>  2.He is taking pride and just truly loves his lover, and all. So he is saying he likes her. Thinking your just going to be friends with him.<br>  <br>  It's just what guys do, I mean I would if I had a girlfriend.|`|cHM2US6xaa	Yes, they are telling you to back off.<br>  <br>  Yeesh. You had to ask ?!<br>  <br>  I do this when an annoying person is trying to get with me but i have a boyfriend.<br>  <br>  In your situation you are that annoying person. haha<br>  <br>  Or they are trying to show their girlfriend off.<br>  <br>  But its most likely the first one.|`|yM8NiXmLaa	no... i do this. im proud of my girl so i want the world to know it. she forces me to the mall, not to shop, but to show me off. its weird but when you find that special someone you want the world to know how you feel. thats the only reason. we like to brag about how great our girls are no matter what. for me, its a pride thing. i try to give her everything and shes happy so i show her off. and she does the same.|`|XVygEWLcaa	omg this happened to me. this guy would totally flirt with me and we would hang out and then he would constantly bring up this chick that he says he lost his v to. he even has the pic in his wallet! wtf lol|`|jBk1b4r6aa	You actually had to ask?<br>  Nevermind....Im speachless|`|NxZl1Qccaa	yip you are,|`|W9z9Al4Oaa	yes they are telling you they are taken. Like if I'm talking to a guy and he's trying to get with me, i bring up my boyfriend.<br>  Its a way of telling them to back off.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	they are telling you to back offf|`|KCpGsN2faa	Wow. Are you serious or are you just...nvm. Wow. OF COURSE THEY WANT YOU TO BACK. Sheesh.|`|RCfc9hMKaa	Yes.
dqZrq7Zeaa	All you can do is pass the message on. Sometimes arrangements are not just about desire but rather created by circumstance.... <br>  It's wonderful she has 2 loving parents.
iOAl0n4taa	It  means he's taking advantage of you.  You need to leave him.  He's using you.  Also does he have a drug problem??|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Find yourself a new boyfriend.|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	You're getting played.  He wants you around to help him financially and probably for sex and that's it.  You need to drop this loser quick.|`|sZ0McynSaa	Get rid of the free-loader, he is only using you.
vUVxS9Xhaa	Show me your picture....I will give you an honest answer.<br>  <br>  If you are a model and you are really attractive, the other girl is probably just jealous of your good looks.

Clearly she doesn't like money and is seriously socially stunted if she thinks it's appropriate to talk about her customers that way.|`|XVygEWLcaa	she's jealous. that's the only reason why girls talk **** about eachother. if they didn't care at all about you, they wouldnt say anything. its pure physics|`|0jeWHxKmaa	She is jealous..she was probably ugly.TRUST ME!!!..i go through this eveyday!!!|`|iBH7NTl3aa	The ***** needs an attitude adjustment lol perhaps a nice firm fist in the fizzog would rehabilitate her! xx|`|AYH0RPsjaa	Did you tip?

Ignore her back|`|HIGZ6Dasaa	A kinda similar thing happened to me and I found that the harder I tried to fix things the more I pissed her off.

They also have not figured out who they are as an individual & usually are unable to give themselves the structure they are needing if they move out. Personally why move out, if one is not paying rent (forcefully) & the situation is bearable? Of course there are different circumstances and such but usually home is a very good place. Why change it if it is unnecessary?|`|B7kPUmUWaa	Depends on the age you are talking about. But most young people know nothing about the real world and how it works. It's really hard to be on your own and take care of things like an adult. There's a big difference in wanting to be an adult and do your own thing and actually having to do it.

Someone that's honest and loyal. After that you may want someone as smart as yourself wherever along the IQ scale one may be. Next you want someone that has a similar sense of humor (some have dry, some have goofy etc..), and attractiveness differs for everyone as well. The truth is when people are going over what they look for in someone, it's really just a guidline as love is blind. You may fall in love with someone that doesn't fit the complete bill but you will love them for their faults anyways.<br>  <br>  If you want more specific advice you need to give a more specific question.

It's all about how they were raised. If they were taught to respect women and treat them as equals or if they were taught that women are just another tool for pleasure and self gain. I've met plenty of guys who would rather get some and those who want to take it slow and are more interested in who you are than if you'll drop your pants. Most guys aren't what you think when they're with their friends they're one way and when they're with you they're another. Guys are far more complex than they let on and even more so than us girls are willing to believe. If you can find that one guy who can simply be himself when he is around you and/or his friends keep him by being yourself. Guys appreciate honesty as much as we do.|`|P7HdSzhKaa	we say what we do not mean sometimes because we want to make a woman happy.<br>  <br>  some of us are new at it.<br>  <br>  some of us practice, i guess. they say it to a woman, then go to another one.<br>  <br>  <br>  it is because we lack something inside.<br>  <br>  <br>  it is not like we have detectors that will let us know if a woman is materialistic or not. <br>  <br>  all we can do is sense it..or we tell by what past experience we had with some women.<br>  <br>  <br>  most guys just wants a female comanion who accept the guy for his flaws and perfections. but no man or woman is ever perfect.<br>  <br>  they just want an honest loving fun personality in thier lives.|`|37ana68Haa	well i look for whether they are fun to hang with and if they will be compassionate or not if there not then they are a booty call so to speak lol i really dont have to high of standards on looks but i dont date fat girls or just flat out ugly girls they have to be alright lookin!!|`|187i20N5aa	well diffrent things for diffrent guys some guy just want in your pants .... not all some .... some wanna just chill at the house and cuddle and watch movies .. .where some wanna go out with friends it really just depends on the guy your talking bout here just try playin hard to get and if that doesnt work try just being friends with him and move in slowy :]]|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	different things for different ppl.  Guys just wanna get laid so we say what it takes. haha.  Honestly though, guys like a challenge...don't be to easy....or easy at all for that matter life will pick up for you.  You will get less, but what you do get will be worth more....|`|BL4PEjAWaa	the ? is did you get what you wanted out of the meeting.  Guy's are all about impressing the ladies, words, cars, cloth's.<br>   On the other hand, if you offer they will take.|`|zuVZUDRdaa	well....i look for a girl who is honest...and actually wants a good relationship....but with <br>  some guys its all about sex
8e373a7bc6b3c784f2bae9cc02a6cf20aa	Ignore her!  She's getting a response from you and that's what she wants!|`|rqFbNhAGaa	she's acting like a child treat her like one, not sure of age but if she expects to be treated as an adult tell her to behave like one, let her know that if she continues to behave like a kid that's how you'll treat her.|`|YcWGDKvkaa	Don't treat her like a child. Instead if she starts to whine, cross your arms and let her finish ranting. If she is done then walk away. If she tries to start something with you, be completely mellow (it will drive her mad) and intimidate her a little by showing that you don't care.
B7kPUmUWaa	Why would you say you have a brain tumor? That's crazy stupid! She should be mad at you. I personally would never speak to you again. That's horrible. Can you imagine how worried they were about you? You need to get some help for your compulsive lying to get attention! She is crazy if she ever speaks to you again.|`|16827288a6ef61faf9d2e2c99f7102edaa	first of all shame on you for lying. only time will heal all wounds. don't do anything.
rNmekxLcaa	No, not really. Sometimes... when it's something stupid (in my mind)|`|POHWTDPRaa	When they cry for a real reason, no. When they cry to get attention or sympathy, yes.|`|i3PGjRRfaa	Yes - especially when it is over stupid stuff like a movie, etc.................|`|BN5nW4rZaa	If they cry a lot then yes. every once in a while is expected though plus you have the chance to comfort them.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	The answer would be: it depends. On what? well, it's different if she's crying because her pet died than crying because I told her to shut up. O:)|`|jcL7gDMKaa	yeah i do its so pathetic! they only do it to get their own way and more attention.|`|AA11108018	For me it softens my heart and she could get away with just about anything|`|9BUc0lgjaa	excessively yes. crying sometimes is acceptable and warranted, but girls who cry anytime sometihng happens are annoying and immature. if you cry over something like a bad grade or someone calling you ugly, your acting childish. if not then i wouldnt worry aobut it, nothing wrong with a few tears.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	If it's over something serious, most men will be sympathetic. But if you're always crying they will probably get annoyed.|`|JH8Afnf4aa	My guyfriend Matt LOVES it when girls cry. He'll come up and hug them as they cry on his shoulder. It's ridiculously funny.|`|DKEOJ0h6aa	Do you Cry Too???<br>  <br>  Hey what about the men out here and why the boys only???<br>  R you asking the opinions of nursery kids out here?<br>  <br>  LOL|`|8Ypkfr7jaa	My boyfriend panics when I cry lol. Coz he knows it's his fault =/|`|ablriuUVaa	if its about nothing yes,<br>  <br>  if they have a valid reason no|`|TTFGJrvXaa	It crushes me lol and I have to hug them.|`|DybOqfGpaa	yes boyfreind doesnt like anyone to cry|`|jC46idZTaa	yes.. why do u always cry??|`|3ekncEpaaa	honestly no because it shows simpathy and caring character... i like it because depending what they are crying over i can find out more about them and what they are going through so that i can help them in the long run... i also think it may be a little nice because when the girl is crying i get to hold her and tell her everything is going to be alright in a calming voice... i think that no matter what the problem is, if its a true relationship anyone could get over any situation, especially the ones that involve crying because you get to talk more and open up about things that you were scared to say... also im one of those sweet guys that when i see someone cry my eyes get a little watery when i hear about the problems of the other person|`|gibnbbWDaa	It depends on how frequent and what she's crying over. As I understand women tend to be more emotional than men im okay with my woman crying when a sensitive moment comes up. But it does annoy me girls (not my girl) cry over little things to get attention or whatever. I still spoil her and make it seem im not annoyed but it does urk me just a little.|`|TawYWc4waa	guys will get annoyed if the girl is crying for a stupid reason but if its a good reason then no cuz theyre opening up and not hiding their emotions and guys like open girls and im sure the guys would love to be the one to comfort her|`|600df65ba01a2467217ddd81f1760a2aaa	Depends on the frequency.  Crying a lot is tiresome.  I've known people who cried at every stressful time possible.  Crying at a great movie or at a sad event is human.|`|PWN5rqgxaa	not if its because of something i did, because then its my problem<br>  <br>  but yes its very annoying when a girl cries because she wants something from you or wants you to change something about yourself|`|ZmyS0tkgaa	Hell no When i see a girl cry i try to cheer them up by making them laugh and asking them what is wrong|`|AA11632061	A little, if it my girl friend then YES... I dont like when a girl is crying.<br>  The same thing is If she is someone that I dont know then I dont like it because it sucks|`|0XknsE3waa	If I'm attracted to a girl and she starts crying I will be so turned on that you wouldn't believe it XDDD|`|uIg6an6Jaa	not if its my gf or good friend then you take her in to your arms and try your best to make them feel better|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	not annoyed but don't cry if you don't have to|`|l18jsspOaa	No.I would try to cheer her up.|`|4bDPhnCKaa	it depends on what the girl is crying about|`|KYTi57Luaa	Yes I do|`|h9RCLfgWaa	no. its cute, i hug em.|`|AA12190990	yes|`|jXDjHUHxaa	no
