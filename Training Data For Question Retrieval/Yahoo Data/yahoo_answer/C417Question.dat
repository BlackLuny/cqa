20090203151542AAIf5pl	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Conversion of garage...?	I have a two car attached to the house and a separate 2 car garage with bonus room above detached from the house.      Do you think if I converted the garage attached to the house I would benefit from the additional sqft. or would I be better off keeping all 4 garages. My home right now is 4 bedrooms ~2400sqft. I would put an additional bath in the garage with a closet to be able to sell its as a 5th room if necessary for resale. We would convert it to either a bigger kitchen or an indoor workout space.      Also we are at the top of our price range for the neighborhood. There is only 1 other house in the neighborhood that has a 3-5 car garage.
20090203151332AAl8tkC	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	What is causing my well pump to pick up air?	I have a shallow well jet pump. About a month or two back I started noticing that we were getting bursts of air in the water from the faucets. Suddenly one day it shot out one last burst of air and the water stopped flowing. We called a plumber and they came and got it pumping again but shortly after that we had the same problem. I primed the pump and got it pumping water, but after using the water and bringing the pressure down in the tank to the point the pump kicks on we get the air and the water stops flowing. Every time this happens the pump seems to have lost its prime. We had a well company come in and look at it and they said the pump is cavitating. The well/pump company replaced the pump (said it was damaged probably due to the cavitation) with a new one. The new pump has the same problem with the cavitation but they affixed a release valve that releases the air and keeps the pump primed. It seems to be working for the moment but they say that this doesn't fix the underlying problem, but we'll have water for now. The company wants to dig out the well and replace the line that goes into the well and add a pitless adapter and new casing (the well casing is broken). The well company doesn't think the line is leaking though, they said if the line was leaking we should be losing pressure when the pump shuts off. I would appreciate any thoughts on the matter, thanks.

Our back patio is ground level, and there is a small area out from our patio where I'd like to plant some flowers.      The area is about 1 foot wide, and 4 feet long.       I'd like to plant something colorful, that will last through most of late spring through late summer.          Any suggestions? Please specify if the plants will come back up every year. I'm debating on weather or not I want to do plants that will come up every year or not.       There is a 1foot x 2ft box out side below the deck now that the previous owner used for planting...it was obvious that it had not been planted in for quite some time. I'm wondering if I put it in the center of my planting area with a pretty flower in it - something that over flows maybe...and then plant around it on the ground...how that would look.    If I choose to do that, what would be a good flower to do it with? Something like short and flowey that will grow down the side of the box. Almost like a ground cover but not leafy - more flowery.       I'm also planning on having a tomato plant on the porch its self. I'll probably buy it pre-potted though from a near by garden store.

20090225070523AA5VEaJ	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	What can he grow at 11yrs. old, with no garden and a very small balcony?	My friend has a son of 11yrs. old, who has learning difficulties and ADHD.  But, he enjoys "gardening".  Unfortunately, we live in flats and do not have gardens, just balconies, and at this present moment in time, every conceivable place in her flat is now covered with pots of seeds.  Tomatoes, radishes, spring onions, beetroot....... You name it, Tony is trying to grow it,  Unfortunately, her flat does not get much sunshine at the time of the day you would need it for growing things.  Our main concern is that if Tony keeps planting seeds, watching them germate, and then, everything dies, he will lose his interest in gardening, which would be a negative imput on him.  No-one wants that, especially his mother or me.  So, if there are any enthusiastic flat-dwelling, indoor or balcony gardeners, that could send any info./timetable/calendar information that I could print out for Tony, so he can actually grow and see to fruition, (no pun intended), i.e. eat his produce, it would be very much appreciated.  As a last note, I have a good sense of humour, but I DO NOT want any suggestions of "leaf" plants that he may be able to grow.  I am being serious on this matter.  Thanks alot.  Christine
