So I need to know a fast growing grass. Furthermore, how do you recommend I grow the grass? From seedlings, sprouts, or just buy some already grown turf? etc? I don't have much experience on plants and how to care for them etc. I am not a plant person.      It can't be anything like bamboo, because technically that is the fastest growing grass but it isn't suitable for indoors.

20090130170052AAWW9bD	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Help with AP Biology sex-linked genetics problem!?	An American couple both work in an atomic energy plant, and both are exposed daily to low-level background radiation. After several years, the couple got it on, made a baby, and this baby got this disease thang called Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a sex-linked recessive genetic defect in which the mutant locus is on the X chromosome. Both parents are normal, as are the grandparents. The couple sue the plant claiming that the abnormality in their child was the direct result of radiation-induced mutation of their gametes, radiation against which the company should have protected them. Before reaching a decision, the judge insists on knowing the sex of the child. Which sex would be more likely to result in an 'award' of damages, and why?

Suppose that a market research company finds that at a price of p = $20, they would sell x = 42 tiles each month. If they lower the price to p = $10, then more people would purchase the tile, and they can expect to sell x = 52 tiles in a month’s time. Find the equation of the line for the demand equation.

So, while practicing for the SAT, my classmates and I came across a math SAT question, and it is rather difficult, no one has been able to figure out how to solve it, even our teacher. We sneaked a peek at the answers, we know what it is, (don't look!! Spoiler warning!) Answer is 72. That's it. Well, here is the problem, if you can give me a mathematical way to solve it, I will be glad. It was on a grid-in section, so there is no wonderful "educated guess"    The question is (get some paper!):    How many different sequences/orders can these five cards be put in?   (draw FIVE squares, 1st one has a circle in it, 2nd has an X, 3rd is shaded, 4th has an asterisk *, and the 5th has a dot.     Here's the kicker: the shaded card can NOT be at either end of the line... it must be in one of the middle three spots.     Thank you in advanced!

Since childhood, I have trouble making it through the day without a nap.  It always seemed to be another issue (children are growing and need sleep, teenagers sleep a lot, college messed up my sleep cycle...etc..).  Now I'm 26 and it's still the same.  I'm tired all the time and over the past few years have put on more weight even though I'm eating MUCH better and exercising more than I used to (and drinking a lot less than in college too).  I do have some of the more minor symptoms too, like losing a lot of hair in the shower and being intolerant to cold..  Please share your experience or opinions with me.  What did your doctor do?  Did you notice a change with medication?  Like I said, I'm going tomorrow for bloodwork and I'm just trying to get an idea of what to expect.

20090130193615AAfbFze	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	How did the universe come into existence?	Something has to have a beginning, even the "Big Bang" theory- something had to have caused it, and something would have to have caused or created that.      I'm utterly fascinated with "existence" in general, so much as when you think about it, its somewhat depressing. We really all are irrelevant, no matter which way you cut the cake. Its depressing to think that in 1.5 billion years, everything we know on this earth will be gone. Millions of years before that, the Earth will cease to be able to sustain life. Not to say that it won't be gone when we die, but everything man has achieved, everything man has enjoyed, man in general- will be gone for eternity. Gone. Obliterated. Anihilated. Not a trace of our existence. Your favourite lake, your favourite tree, the place you may be standing in or sitting in at the present moment- gone. All will turn to molten rock then be obliterated from this universe. It sounds cheap when saying it, but if you take your time to think about it-  It really is depressing and fascinating at the same time.      Anyways, back to my question, how did the universe come into existence?
