20090223113706AAxDuc3	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Virgin Mobile text messaging problem - same message keeps resending over and over,only sent once - please help?	I have a Virgin Mobile UT Starcom Super Slice phone. I have been having many problems, but the main one is the phone keeps resending the same text message over and over.      For example, I will text "Hello" to a person's cell phone. But, that same message gets sent many times (my gradma once said it was 7). When I look at the Sent box, it will show "Hello" text, but only once-that one time I sent it. But, the person who I am texting says they get the same message over and over.       It is getting very annoying. But, I don't want to deal with the hassle of switching PrePaid Cell Phones. I like my current cell phone number, too. I have tried to contact Virgin Mobile directly, and all they said was that they were working on it.. that was a couple months ago.      Is anyone else having this problem, and do you know if Virgin Moible is close to fixing it anytime soon?      Please and thank you.

I have experienced the RROD once before, and there are no red lights this time, or error messages. Plus i bought it in July 2007. So what are my options? Should i try DIY tips on in?

20090223102958AAwnnwO	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Can someone help explain "System Link" for Xbox 360 to me?	What exactly is System Link? I know you can do split screen from separate TVs/xbox's so you don't have to actually split the screen.  You connect 2 or more xbox 360's through a hub/ethernet port, right?      So do you need to be online? Or is it all between the two consoles? For two of them, does one end of the ethernet cord go in one 360 and the other end goes in the other 360? Is there any internet involved?  Thanks!

I don't watch sports, and I don't intend to get a BluRay player (at least not for a while -- maybe I'll get a PS3 eventually).  I currently have 25-in TV that isn't a flatscreen.      I'm tech-savvy, but pretty ignorant about TVs. I want a flat-screen that is significantly bigger than my current model, though not anything too huge.  Can you make a recommendation?
20090223123004AAUx92l	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	What do I need to buy to establish a wireless connection to Xbox Live?	I live in a two story house with my Xbox on the 1st floor and my desktop computer on the 2nd connected to a cable modem. All I want to do is get onto Xbox Live without running 100ft of ethernet cable and maybe allow friends to bring their laptops over and be able to get online. I'm pretty sure I need the $100 360 wireless adaptor, but what other piece(s) of equipment do I need to create a wireless network?  Brands, models, and prices would be appreciated.

20090223131735AAk1gJK	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Why did my xbox 360 stop reading my backups?	I have a hitachi 78k (yes i know its old) and have it flashed with ixtreme 1.4, when i first flashed it i could not read backups, so i read online to use q-tip with some alcohol to lightly clean the lens on the dvd drive to make it read better. It worked great all my games i burnt ran perfect first try. One day i burnt fear 2 and it wouldnt play i would get the open tray message like when i first flashed my xbox, but after like 5 tries it finally read it. All the other games ran fine it was just that one that had trouble. So i decided to try and clean the laser again. I used alcohol like the first time then wiped it off with a cloth. I turned the xbox on tried fear and it still was messed up along with all my other games! I was so mad so i tried cleaning it like 4 more times, once not drying off the alcohol and it still did nothing. After a million times opening and closing the tray it finally will load my game but i was wondering if there was anything else i could do to fix my laser to where it was before i tried cleaning it. Is there somethin better than alcohol to clean it with? Please help as it is very annoying having to open and close the tray like 5 times to get a game loaded.

Hi,   for some unknown reason my iPod Touch has recently failed to communicate with my iTunes version 8, and basically nothing happens. I plug the iPod in to the USB on my computer (using the lead coming with the iPod), and iTunes behaves like I didn't even do anything (i.e. no 'My Devices' found, not even an error message on the iTunes screen). What the hell is happening, as the lead works fine (I use this lead to charge my iPod via a wall charger, as my computer doesn't even charge the thing while connected). Please can you help me, as this is really bugging me; I can't update and put new songs on my iPod. PLEASE help me.

I've been looking at tamron lenses, but need to know what is best to train on. dont want to exceed 400 on the lens. 200 would be ideal as I already spent 600 on the camera.       later on i' may graduate to a better lens.

So I call the AT&T store to see what they can do to help me fix it, and do you know what they tell me?!! They tell me that if I ship it alllllllllllllllllll the way to FREAKING NEW YORK that they will have it unlocked in like 6 weeks, WITH a $25 charge! What the hell is this!?   I never knew how stupid and crappy AT&T was until now! There is nooooo f*cking way the New York is the ONLY place in this entire freaking Untied States that can possibly unlock my phone! That is such ****! I hateeee AT&T and I think they have the worst possible customer service ever! I don't know about other phone services, but right now I'm wishing I had a different one! For reasons like these, I DO NOT recommend AT&T.!
