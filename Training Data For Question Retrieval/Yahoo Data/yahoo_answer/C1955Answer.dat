1F6KJt0oaa	There are zooms and primes.  Primes are usually faster (allow more light to come in at their widest aperture) and have better resolution.  Zooms are more convenient in that they allow you to change focal lengths quickly to catch the perfect composition.  Zooms come in fixed aperture and variable aperture.  Usually a good fixed aperture lens is about f/2.8 which is pretty decently fast for most applications.  A variable aperture will be something like f/4-f/5.6 meaning that at different focal lengths you will have a different widest aperture.  It has to do with lens construction.  Generally speaking there are three types of sizes; wide, normal, and telephoto.  Wide means that it has a wide angle of view.  These are generally considered to be anything under about 40mm in 35mm cameras.  These lenses the shorter they are the wider the angle of view.  Think about it like this with a 28mm lens what you will be able to see will be like if you hold your arms out for a wide hug.  Normal lenses are generally lenses between about 40mm and 80mm in 35mm film cameras.  About 42mm is actual normal for 35mm film but the range given is basically normal.  Normal refers to theoretically the angle of view of the lens is the same as the eye sees and is the same as the diagonal of the capture area.  In the arm scenario it is like holding your arms out for a close hug instead of running across a field hug.  Telephoto is basically anything past about 80mm on 35mm film cameras.  It has a very narrow angle of view.  It is kind of like when you zoom in all the way on a point and shoot.  It tends to flatten a scene and relative distances can be reduced of far away objects.  A 500 or 1000 mm lens is like a child's telescope or a pair of binoculars.  To think of the angle of view in terms of arms it is like holding your arms out to a small child to pick them up.  <br>  <br>  Wide covers a broad area and can exaggerate the relative distance between objects.  Normal is theoretically like your eye sees but obviously there is some play in the range to allow for wide normal and short telenormals.  Telephoto lenses are for long distance shots and minimizes relative distances between distant objects.|`|MIiQt8TWaa	it's hard to really tell you about each lens individually without knowing the kind of camera you have and what you'll be doing with it. when I first bought my DSLR, I read that buying the camera is the easy part. becoming obsessed with lenses is the next step. certain lenses allow you to do certain things. some specialize in close-up shots or shots that require a deep field of view. there are also specialty lenses like a wide angle lens, panoramic lens, etc. they can range from anywhere from $80 to several thousands (for Canon at least). here's a guide I found online similar to the one I read over and over when I first got my camera:<br>  <a href="http://photonotes.org/articles/beginner-faq/lenses.html" rel="nofollow">http://photonotes.org/articles/beginner-...</a><br>  happy shooting!|`|AA10567651	different lenses are used in different situations. Some lenses are recommended for dim lighted areas and some require lots of light. It just all depends what your going to use your lenses for. Some have some pretty cool effects like focus/blur everthing else out....|`|TbTO5SXlaa	Just go to <a href="http://www.dbusch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dbusch.com/</a> and buy "David Busch's Quick Snap Guide to Digital SLR Lenses" by (surprise) David Busch. He will explain everything about lenses in an easy to understand way.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	AF-S Zoom NIKKOR 28-70mm f/2.8 IF-ED<br>  <br>  what the heck does all that mean? Different companies use different abbreviations for their lenses, this is just an example. The afs at the front means the lens has a built in autofocusing motor. The zoom means the lens has zoom, as opposed as being fixed. Nikkor is the brand name. 28-70mm is the focal lengths of the lens. the lower number, 28, signifies a wider angle, while the 70 is the telephoto end of the lens. mm is millimeters, used to measure focal length. f/2.8 is the largest aperture possible on the lens. the f is f-stop, numerals used to indicate how large an aperture is opened to. The smaller the number, the larger the possible aperture. In cheaper zoom lens, a f/3.5 reading at the wide end often falls to a 5.6 at telephoto. IF is internal focusing. all the focusing happens internally, meaning the lens does not extend when focusing. ED is for a special lens element used in the construction of the lens. ED glass supresses chromatic abberations at the telephoto end, otherwise knows as color fringing.<br>  <br>  In some lens, the manufacture may indicate it is a "DX" or "digital" lens. This means that it only covers the image ciricle of aps-c format dslrs, not the traditional full frame and 35mm film cameras. In other lens, there may also be a VR or IS in the lens name. This stands for optical stabalisation. It works by compensating for minor camera shake by moving one of the lens element in the opposite direction you are moving yours.

TaxYLHbMaa	depends what you need it for , the lg viewty has pretty mediocre video capabilities , and will not handle many of the visual spectrum's considered in relation to a video camera , the video's will be grainy in many light conditions , and will be pretty much on par with mobile phone video and picture schematics. but if you are buying LG viewty for other functions within it then this is another story.<br>  for the cheapest and best alternative and high quality camera's I would suggest you consider a SVP T-500 , small pocket sized high definition camera for your video needs

R5DlzGveaa	As long as the music doesn't have any copy protection (DRM), there shouldn't be any problems importing it into the Zune software. Just point it towards wherever the files are. <br>  <br>  If it does have DRM, then it's a little more difficult. You'll have to use a program such as Tunebite (I don't know of any good free programs for this) to remove it before you can move it to your Zune.<br>  <br>  You can check to see if the music has DRM by right-clicking it in Windows Media Player and clicking "Properties." One of the tabs should say something like "usage rights" (I forget what, exactly). Click on it and it'll tell you if it has DRM.

fa3db0f254c65d60df56a24161efe96faa	RS and Wow are very simple. I dont think they are rly a game b/c no skills are required its all about time. If a person plays wow and gets addicted to it then that is not good. I know that i can play for a few hours and be done. They are not immoral unless they dominate your life. If on the weekends you are playing Wow or Rs instead of playing with friends or making new friends then you should not be playing the game. If you are playing from say 9:00- 12/1 in the morening then that is not too bad. These games were made for people to have fun when they are alone. Not to take over a persons life|`|blYvr1Uzaa	I just think that if most people realized how boring and repetitive the game they are playing is, then they would move on to funner and "healthier" things.

5ccfb257346579f524c107a4b2fd24f6aa	Je suis surpris de voir tant de critiques de la photographie chimique.<br>  Je suis désolé de vous l'apprendre, mais tout est moins cher, de A à Z. Mon appareil numérique (un bridge à 600 euros que je trouve particulièrement merdique vaut le prix d'un appareil professionnel moyen format d'occasion... voire d'une petite chambre. Comparez donc ce qui est comparable).<br>  <br>  Perso, je fais de la diapo, je la développe moi-même :<br>  - la couleur avec un kit Tetenal 5L à 100€ les 60 rouleaux de 36 poses... faites le compte.<br>  - la noir et blanc (disparu du marché) à partir de négatifs ilford ou kodak black & white grace à une chimie maison après de longues discussions sur le forum photo 35mm de Lionnel (voir lien).<br>  Sans rire, c'est vraiment pas compliqué (sauf la température en couleur), et la qualité est remarquable. Je pense qu'on l'atteindra en numérique, mais on a encore un paquet d'années à atteindre ! De plus, tu as la possibilité de ma?triser la cha?ne du début à la fin.<br>  <br>  Enfin, on me dit souvent de tout faire en numérique, ce qui revient pour moi à faire l'opération suivante :<br>  - image réelle<br>  - shoot numérique<br>  - flashage diapo argentique (très cher et énorme perte de qualité), parce que je ne vais pas me servir d'un vidéoprojecteur, ceux-ci étant de bien piètre qualité par rapport à leur énorme co?t !<br>  - développement (labo, boulot salopé)<br>  <br>  plut?t que :<br>  - image réelle<br>  - shoot diapo<br>  - développement (perso et pas labo)<br>  (une étape de moins, un prix de revient ridicule, une qualité inégalée et le choix du film Kodachrome 64, Fujichrome Velvia, Kodak Ektachrome...)<br>  <br>  Bref, j'aimerais que ceux qui viennent pour critiquer s'abstiennent de répondre des conneries, parce que la personne qui pose la question a l'air motivée !<br>  Genre : j'aime la marche à pieds en montagne => achète un 4x4... <br>  -------------<br>  Bon, et pour répondre à la question :<br>  - diapo (positif) : film à traitement E6, très peu onéreux ; j'ai choisi cette option à condition d'avoir toujours le projecteur sous la main.<br>  Tu peux aussi (dans les grandes occasions) tirer des agrandissements de qualité et de longévité inégalées grace au papier et procédé Cibachrome (ou Ilfochrome). La légende des légendes...<br>  <br>  - négatif : film à traitement C41 : si tu tires tes agrandissements toi-même, tu obtiendras de très bons résultats, mais la couleur, c'est assez difficile. Tu risques d'être dé?ue par le travail des labos qui salopent tout pour te faire passer au numérique.<br>  <br>  Le développement, c'est grosso-modo le même boulot : un film dans une cuve noire, à température stabilisée. Seuls les produits changent. Par contre, la diapo une fois développée, tu as l'image finale ; tu la mets sous cache et tu peux la projeter. Le négatif a besoin d'être agrandi sur du papier négatif (besoin d'un agrandisseur et d'un labo). Si tu fais de la couleur, c'est compliqué, et si tu passes par un labo, c'est du sale boulot ! Si tu fais du noir et blanc, c'est très simple et de très grande qualité... mais faut aimer !<br>  <br>  Moi, je conseille :<br>  - diapo<br>  - développement maison<br>  - mise sous cache (cache en verre pour tes photos les plus précieuses)<br>  <br>  Et en option :<br>  - création de diapos noir et blanc à partir de films négatifs noir et blanc : chimie maison<br>  - tirage de positifs sur papier positif cibachrome... le must<br>  <br>  Pour faire de la photo de portait, il y a le négatif Kodak Portra 100 iso, en diapo, il y a l'incroyable Kodachrome 64.<br>  Et en négatif noir et blanc, il y a l'inimitable Kodak TMAX100.<br>  <br>  Mais si tu débutes, achète des pellicules classiques, pour te faire la main (diapo fuji Sensia, kodak eliteChrome ; négatif kodacolor 100, N&B Ilford FP4 125... chez tous les photographes)<br>  <br>  On a tous débuté un jour ! Ne te laisse pas décourager par des adeptes de l'informatique... dans 30 ans, tes photos seront toujours là, elles !|`|966c31b8af0cad793b5493f0036ce4c4aa	Sincèrement je ne vous conseille d'acheter un appareil numérique, oubliez les pellicules 135. Les pellicules font déjà presque partie du passé et elles rejoindront bient?t les films 110, 126, 120, etc...|`|9a1362748c4b503339f9e16b19d074ceaa	puisque tu es "amatrice" (tes questions prouvent que tu n'y connais vraiment rien , et ce n'est pas une critique !! (on ne peut pas tout savoir !! <br>  :-)))<br>  renonce aux pellicules,...!!! <br>   ou inscris toi a un club photo pres de chez toi, car on ne peut pas te faire un cours photo via yahoo QR<br>  <br>  tu obtiendras plus de satisfactions avec un bon appareil numérique et cela te reviendra bien moins cher (sauf si tu es riche et que le prix ne t'importe pas)<br>  <br>  il n'est pas non plus raisonnable d'envisager de developper tes photos toi meme, a part eventuellement le noir et blanc..<br>  mais la encore cela s'apprend en club photo, ..|`|d7b27868028af5fe9e001e7f17be012daa	Tu trouverais des réponses plus exactes à tes questions chez un professionnel contacte le labo - photos le plus proche|`|a2c4e1a4e42fc7ccccb902c4a4b6fb3caa	DIAPO DEMANDE PROJECTEUR ET ECRAN POUR VISIONNER . LES TIRAGES PAPIERS SONT PLUS PRATIQUE ! si tu débutes 400 asa c'est plus s?r.<br>  quant au labo a la maison cela devient professionnel,|`|aa19eefd6dad93763e81d79c9e2bd2cdaa	Un négatif est le résultat d'une prise de vue en couleur ou Noir/Blanc et si au développement vous faites une "inversion" vous obtiendrez un positif, appelé communément "diapositive".<br>  Le traitement entre les 2 n'est évidemment pas le même. Sur le plan "labo-photo", c'est délicat, car il faut déjà un local équipé de l'eau chaude et froide, d'une évacuation des eaux usées, d'un éclairage inactinique... et de la place pour le stockage des produits chimiques usés, qu'il est interdit de jeter aux égouts.<br>  En cas d'infraction, l'amende est salée et des fournisseurs contr?lent votre consommation et récupèrent vos produits usagés.<br>  Sur un autre plan, si vous ne développez pas vous-même vos photos (négatifs ou diapos) elles seront traitées de fa?on professionnelle par un labo. Seul hic, c'est que les meilleurs résultats sont obtenus en couleur, avec des pellicules Kodak... et que tout est développé aux USA depuis quelques temps... donc délais plus longs, co?t plus élevé... c'est pour cette raison que je suis passé au numérique, avec un réflex, pour retrouver les plaisirs de la photographie et des tirages papier. L'avantage, c'est que je peux faire des diaporamas commentés sur fonds musicaux à regarder à la télé.

Firstly, you can connect your Nokia 6288 to your PC and load the load the Nokia PC Suite which is found on a CD together with your package in the Nokia 6288 box. Another way is to send it by bluetooth (you must have a bluetooth dongle connected to your PC to send files over). The last way is to get a Mini-SD card, put it in a case for the SD card and slot it into your computer's SD drive. Drag the music files and paste them on the Mini-SD card. <br>  <br>  The first method is the easiest and the most convenient.|`|sU0q6rZpaa	Hey i jst wanna purcshse 6288...please give me it's response.. please tell me r u compltely satisfied wid it

If you go to the Apple store, someone may be able to find what is wrong and possibly be able to fix it. If someone at the Apple store is not able to fix it, they will better explain to you what to do. It's more helpful if you speak to someone directly instead of looking online because there may be some questions you need answered that are not found online.

AA11042749	If a phone is water damaged, you will not get a new phone through VZW, nor is it covered under manufacturers warranty.  If you have the insurance, they will replace the phone for you.  Once a phone is water damaged, you have to get a new phone, just replacing the battery will not solve it.  The water damages the internal parts of the phone.  You can call cust svc at 1-800-922-0204 to see if you are eligible for an early upgrade that will allow you to renew your contract and get a phone at a discounted rate, or you can go through e-bay.|`|2LLWgl2haa	If your phone had been in the water for quite a while with you, chances are its not going to function properly again, you can try to open the cover and let it dry out for a day, you can see if that takes you anywhere.

tR8pdo5Vaa	I have been reluctant to answer your question because I am unclear as to your frame of reference... but here goes...The analog turntable(such as the DJ favorite technics SL1600) sounds great with a new vinyl record. You can scratch with a sound that can never be duplicated in its clarity. When you change tempo with an analog table , you also change pitch.With a digital turntable(cd player with jog wheel) you can change tempo without changing pitch, and change pitch without changing tempo.The talent in operating either has to be there, but the digital table leaves the option for more creativity.    Much Musical Love........

IphfLTYuaa	My 5 year old LOVES the Wii...we've had to limit him on his playing time, but he has really enjoyed it!<br>  <br>  Anyway, my son loves the Crash Bandicoot games (you can put them on the Easy setting) and he has a Go Diego Go game that has an option where a parent can help out if he gets stuck.  My son also likes the Mario Kart games.  They aren't too difficult and it's pretty forgiving when Mario goes off the track!  <br>  <br>  One suggestion I have is to get a membership to a video store that rents Wii games.  It's not too expensive and that way you can get a different game every few nights.  This is really great if you want to find out what your son really likes, and then you won't be stuck with a game that he doesn't enjoy playing forever!<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!|`|egE9Pl0xaa	I have a 4yo, 8yo, and 12yo.

AA10929465	Definitely the lower megapixels.  If two cameras have the same size sensor, the one with the least megapixels will have larger pixels and therefore a cleaner image, especially in low light.  Even at the same zoom, it would be worth it to get the one with less megapixels (unless it was junk).  Tell us the specific camera models you are looking at to be sure.  |`|7vGUIszVaa	It truly depends on what you want to do with your camera...<br>  if you are somebody who mostly just turns on the camera, points and shoots, you're better off with higher megapixel and digital zoom only.<br>  If you find yourself using the zoom for the majority of your pictures, you'll want to get the optical zoom.<br>  I've had a couple of the compact cameras and my favorite has and will always be the sony cyber shot. <br>  These little guys pack a great punch, have unmatched color range, take great pictures in low light and have a sharp image and amazing auto focus features.

AA11056614	The PS3 has been rated the best Blu-ray player, HOWEVER that was when stand alone players were much more expensive than they are now (under $200). <br>  <br>  The link says the PS3 isn't the best (and that's almost a year ago).<br>  <br>  It has several disadvantages, including being expensive (although it does more than just play Blu-ray movies so this may be acceptable); using 2x the power of a stand alone player, having mediocre video quality (particularly for DVDs) and needed accessories to be a complete player (e.g. remote). In addition it doesn't match stylewise with most HT setups. It's big advantage is its speed (the Cell processor makes load times very fast).<br>  <br>  Bottom line ... if you like PS3 games and want to have a network media player and Blu-ray player the PS3 is good value, but it isn't the best player these days. That said, you probably won't notice unless you did an A/B comparison.|`|sjLUe4Kxaa	Yup, I've just bought a ps3 and flat screen HD tv.

Step by step guide about converting DVD, Videos, Flash and Youtube videos to iPod:  http://dvdtoipodtouch.org/dvdtoipodtouch...  Some useful information you can get on the official site:  http://www.apple.com|`|AA12180617	the ipod ONLY play mpeg4 with h264 encoding, if you have the file in Quicktime or (only on systems with windows media components for Quicktime installed [ Microsoft website for this one]) WMV you can import it into itunes then form the itunes advanced menu use 'convert for ipod' and then the converted file will be mpeg4/h264.    getting this from a DVD or other format needs you to get a convertor or RIPPER and you can get these via www.versiontracker.com    although many shareware will either overall a trial logo or limit it to 30 seconds until you pay the unlocking fee.    for the Mac I use handbrake to RIP DVD's and it does correct to MPEG4.  the reason ipods only use mpeg4 is that its the only OPEN format that does not need an extra codec loading it into the operating system.    WMv, RAM, AVI, etc are not open formats they need codecs adding to the system to play and often these are locked to one program to play them.    ALSO You need to tell your ipod to sync apps, Music (or Movies etc) as by default most syncing is OFF other than Music which is ALL unless its too big for the ipod/iPhone when its none.    Plug ipod into itunes.  click on the ipods Icon its summary page appears.  click on the tab that says Video  click on 'Sync All' or ' Sync only selected'  click on APPPLY BOX  click on SYNC box.    voila it now will sync Video|`|7iugcRV6aa	I'm Pretty sure that Ipods can only play .mp4 file formats.

There are many converters that you can pay for, but there are some free ones with trials such as Xillisoft|`|6bQFiOvyaa	I looked into doing this a while ago. Unfortunately you will need to download a converter to change the format to something like an MP4... I have looked everywhere for free ones, but it seems that most of the names out on google are all paid for!    Also, there is another sticking point. If you are trying to transfer your DVD's i.e. movies, there may be copyright laws that stop you from doing this!     Sorry not much help. Good luck.|`|hB4W099saa	You can use Anydvd and Ulead videostudio 11.5 Plus together..Once you rip the vid into Ulead you drag it to the timeline click on SHARE then click on EXPORT TO MOBILE DEVICE,choose the second option from the drop down menu,a window will open,name your vid,click on OK and it will convert it to mp4 format.You'll find the movie in the Ulead folder marked 11.Go to itunes click on add file to library,add your movie ,then sync your ipod.Works every time.  You can get Ulead on a 21 day free trial,you have to pay to download Anydvd ,Google it..Good luck.

The Canon is a great camera except for shutter lag - there's a very noticeable delay between the time you press the button and the time the shutter trips - which means some missed shots and a lot of camera shake and blur. The Kodak doesn't have the fancy settings, and it's bigger and bulkier, but it takes a great picture - it's the one we use for most of our 'on-line' photos - and fewer settings means easier to use. The next time we're shopping for a camera, we'll look at Kodak first.

There are similar cameras from other manufacturers- go to www.dpreview.com and check out their camera database- you can compare the reviews of every camera.<br>  <br>  EDIT*- the thing abut this camera (and others like it) is that it's super easy to get great shots, but also has full manual controls for you to grow into and learn as you improve.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	For under $300 I would suggest Nikon Coolpix S710.Great 14.5MP with 3.6x Wide Angle Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom <br>  High ISO 3200 take great picture even in low light.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DO15CO?ie=UTF8&tag=computer0bd-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001DO15CO" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DO1...</a>|`|Rs5QTZ85aa	I have this camera!<br>  <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&storeId=10151&langId=-1&productId=8198552921665495060" rel="nofollow">http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stor...</a>|`|TTsVhHq4aa	canon cybershot|`|kySXdFQnaa	I currently have a Kodak Z710, which has 7.1 megapixels, 10 times zoooooooooooooooooooom, and quite good colour reproduction - takes videos with audio, very versatile camera. I have taken some beautiful photos with it, but I have also taken some beautiful photos with an old 2 megapixel Kodak camera. It depends what you want to do with the images - A4 prints are still good with 2 megapixel, any larger though, go for higher megapixels. See if you can borrow cameras from friends, try some out, see what the images look like on a computer screen before you buy, as this is where you see the truth about colour reproduction.|`|2icbmWKXaa	I THINK YOU SHOULD GET A HOT CANON CAMERA|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	Do you want lots of zoom ( big camera)? Tiny camera?<br>   A tiny camera with very good image quality fully automatic would be the Canon SD1100 IS. About $150-+ shipping on line.<br>   Or do you want lots of zoom, where the camera brings in far away scenes a lot closer? These cameras are on the big side.|`|AA12133586	pay another 100 you can get a good slr

w4I9oj2Maa	BOTH your Skybox <<AND>> TV are down?<br>  <br>  Sounds like a power line surge to me....<br>  <br>  Let's get one unit up at a time...you have the time since you can't watch TV at all.<br>  <br>  First, pull the AC power cord on both units and wait 5 minutes to RESET the microprocessors on Both units.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't fix it, then pull the back cabinet off and look for the main fuse(s) --replace them if bad, <br>  <br>  Lastly, if that doesn't fix it, Then I hope you're studying electronics and have some troubleshooting skills...if not, then take the TV to the local TV servicer, and the Skybox to your local Skybox for an exchange/diagnostic.
nQ7G1nBVaa	If replacing the set is an option, go for that. <br>  <br>  Go for an LCD set. they are more power efficient, and have other inputs as well, and may have the benefit of HD and widescreen.<br>  <br>  If the "old" set is relatively new and works fine, just go for the convertor box.|`|Qmef98Kaaa	R.T. is correct, you will need a converter box for the small analog TV.  You shouldn't need to pay more than $49.95 (less if you get the coupon, now that the government will be sending them again).  Shop/call around.  I discovered the same converter box at Radio Shack is $10 more than K-Mart.  Plus the K-Mart guy told me that the Zenith one is better than the others...people will wait until the Zenith one is in stock.<br>  Since you have the digital TV's and they must either have an antenna or be hooked up to cable/satellite, you shouldn't have a problem with reception on this tv after you connect it to whatever system you have.  If you do, you may need to get an additional antenna.|`|AA10594501	First, are you aware that you only need a converter box if you get your TV service via antenna. Those with satellite or cable service don't need converter boxes. <br>  <br>  If you DO use an antenna, most converter boxes are around $60, some as cheap as $40. You can get a coupon from the government to subsidize the first $40 of the cost per box.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dtv2009.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.dtv2009.gov</a>|`|qGfAlDd2aa	The converter boxes are $40 - $75 retail.  If you need to convert this TV or buy a new one is up to you.  If this TV has an external antenna input, you can use a converter.<br>  <br>  Being a "small" TV, this may be a portable set.  If portability is an issue, then you may want to replace it with a portable digital set.|`|wEOJyEw0aa	Dude go out and get your self a Large screen wall mount and hook it to your computer too. you have earned it you can tell the wife I said so

0SFGnjq2aa	Hi Tasha,    carphone warehouse doing best deals so far on the U600.  I used to have one.  They were ok,  no initial problems.   Eaiser to transfer pics and music with Windows Media Player than with their own PC Suite.   Only drawback is you can only use up to a 2gb micro memory card.<br>  <br>  I did encounter a few probs when charging the battery and subsequently had to charge phone switched off thru my usb cable and pc<br>  <br>  it is a handy little phone overall, and if you did buy one,  it should be worthwhile|`|a6j7Bu9daa	I had one when it first came out and its a pretty good phone,really slim, camera is good on it (3.2mp), only gripe i had with it was the edging came off mine. But i was pretty rough with it i worked in a factory when i had it and dropped it many times, and worked fine|`|tf54yivaaa	I think the Samsung U600 is a fine cell phone. and the man who worked at the factory said he had drop the cell phone many time so why not buy it?
QQDaVwb0aa	Different output frequencies - 50hz (Australian Standard) and 60hz (American)... PAL 60hz can be used in Australia and is recommended for playing games... By memory, Halo3 or COD4 forces 60hz before you can play the game.|`|RyvKws7Laa	PAL is a TV standard designed for AC of 50Hz used in Europe and Asia.  So real PAL is the PAL 50 that you are referring to.  Its never really called PAL 50 though, that is just simply PAL.  The North American equivalent is called NTSC and is designed for AC of 60Hz (used in North America).    Many newer VCR and DVD players sold in Europe can play back NTSC tapes/discs. When operating in this mode most of them do not output a true (625/25) PAL signal but rather a hybrid of PAL and NTSC known as "PAL 60" (or "pseudo PAL") with "60" standing for 60 Hz, instead of 50 Hz. Some video game consoles also output a signal in this mode.    PAL has 625 vertical lines (576 viewable) while PAL 60 works under the NTSC size so only has 525 vertical lines (480 viewable).  So PAL is a better image as you get more detail displayed.  Its not vastly different, but for those really sensitive to such things, it might be noticeable.
a1A05HWMaa	No, when the DS is fully charged it, automatically cuts off the power between the battery and the chord. The designers of the DS did this to ensure that the battery would not be overloaded if the owner was not around to unplug the DS in time.|`|i8MCI09jaa	well idk but am pretty sure it just ruins it and the world lol soo leave it charging fhur sum hours, i guess it would be less harmfull to leave it on a day but plz dont do this alot lol one day wouldnt really hurt =)|`|7C4GeHxOaa	I am not sure, but it can't be too good.|`|Gerxn2Whaa	the ds power adapters burns out before the ds console does, but i wouldnt leave it plugged in all the time. my nintendo ds power adapter broke after 1year and the light stayed on red all the time. luckily its cheap to replace. ds battery charges last 4 hours|`|hA4Q1Q8xaa	its using up a lot of electricity and energy, look at our planet!<br>  <br>  also it slightly damage the DS if its charging when its already charged, (not fully, just charged.)
bVDU8vX7aa	Nope. It wont. I do the same thing.|`|Zjq1yzEqaa	just close it it still goes of..|`|i8MCI09jaa	i hate that stupid alarm =/ it wont work if yhu turn it off lol i use my phone instead cauz it works even if the phone is off - awesum lol|`|PBQA8tJ0aa	i dont think so but keeping it plugged to ur charger is a great risk (stressed). battery leak, take longer to charge etc
ZCZChQZvaa	the xbox arcade is actually better than some of the other systems as all the new hardware has been put into these as it is quite new it took over the xbox core system looks alot better as well with the white disc drive and eject button just put your hard drive on the arcade and a lil hint :if you are worried about overheating dont get one of those add on fans they make it overheat!!!! put the xbox horizontally so the back is not to close to a wall and put some thing under each foot for maximum ventilation some people use jenga blocks i taped 4 lots of 7 1ps  together then blutacked them to the feet and then blutacked the pennys to the surface this also stops any vibrations from loud music shaking the xbox|`|AA12103453	The arcade is the SAME SYSTEM, they just take off the hard drive.|`|5IttGRxtaa	The consoles themselves are the same.. the only difference is the bundled accessories..    Storage:  Arcade: 256MB memory unit  Premium: 20GB hard drive    Video Cable:  Arcade: Composite cable  Premium: Component HD cable    Other stuff:  Premium: ethernet cable  Premium: Xbox Live headset    Other than that some Premium packages have 2 games packed in.. the Arcade has a disk with 5 arcade game..    Basically the Arcade is good to get started with.. the memory unit can be used to save games.. you can play online on Xbox Live.. you can add on the hard drive later if you want.. If you plan to play online a lot or plan to download xbox live arcade games or other content from xbox live you will probably want the Premium..
vlFVdcxOaa	well miss, your normal video cannot be recorded with sound and music added to it.If you want a video with music and sound. you make the video, add the music and then use a computer microphone to add talking singing ect. If u want to txt me and u can borrow my computer microphone. And make sure those songs are burned to your hardrive. then they will play without the device plugged in. good luck!|`|17cb5831318713f8a5d49a5983625b89aa	it should all work try updating your version of windows moviemaker
rDoS2jsNaa	I think that means that is in a area where the tv will receive good service. Look it up in the phone in the icon directory.
w4OGnyn8aa	Data plan is another at least 30 bucks per month.    EDIT: You can get it without the data plan, but then you have to pay more for the phone and you CANNOT get on the internet.|`|fdlhUxzRaa	the data plan is extra

1WgOj89kaa	Wow, i hope so, this would mean the XBOX 360 would have nothing over the PS3 anymore and the PS3 would become even more dominant.<br>  Thank you very much for the news.|`|quYLRIrgaa	Don't get your hopes up too much & file it under rumours for now.<br>  <br>  There may be loads of sites showing this, but they probably all come from the same source, and we have had plenty of rumours about updates come before that've turned out to be nothing.<br>  <br>  Might just as well come from someone at Microsoft, knowing it'll annoy the heck out of some people when it doesn't happen! (just a thought)
nQ7G1nBVaa	Yes, Wheel is in HD. You may have an HD cable box and that is tuning the HD channel. Your set probably isn't HD though, so you are not seeing the benefit of an HD picture. You may have an SD box that thinks it is an HD box, or component inputs on your set that cannot take better than 480i signals.
e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	The D40 is limited to what?  If you are truly trying to do photography... put the camera in manual mode and get creative.

A better camera doesn't mean you'll get better pictures... it's all about the photographer.  Keep the camera and get a better lens|`|vXkPUOWdaa	just buy it you wont regret it later on in life|`|7955b15e3d87129ea8b03f0c80a27dd4aa	I don't prefer u a Phone where it comes to Photography, if we can get everything in mobile phones there ill be no sales of Digi-cam,ipod etc. i hope u understand my point, everything has itz unique quality,if u need for photos- buy a cam,for phone buy a good voice quality phone thts all but Don't merge them!. gudluck...|`|7yoheNkcaa	i think you buy a phone is better becuase if you have problem you could use the phone to solve problem call your friends for help and many more things
xG5ZlJDqaa	In absolute terms, the D80 is the better camera. Both cameras doesn't feature in-body image stabalisation. VR does make a difference, but usually only at a focal length of 80mm or longer (on a dx body). Here is a detailed side by side of the 2 cameras, both with detailed in depth reviews.   <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_post.asp?method=sidebyside&cameras=nikon_d80%2Cnikon_d60&show=all" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_...</a>|`|AA12133586	d80|`|tWoN22rRaa	The D80 is definitely the better body. It gives you quicker and easier access to the major settings. Has a bigger and brighter viewfinder. Has "advanced" features like Depth of Field preview. And perhaps most importantly it can actually autofocus with ALL Nikon AF lenses (the D60 can only autofocus with AF-I/AF-S ones).<br>  <br>  All modern Nikon lenses will work fine on the D80. That includes the models with VR. And though it's not a total replacement for a tripod or a wide aperture, VR can be useful when shooting indoors or at night.|`|VYjbGbGJaa	D60!! <br>  1: Much newer than the D80<br>  2: Priced lower<br>  <br>  Save the money and use it on a VR lens or two! :D<br>  Digital camera bodies become obsolete quickly, lenses don't!<br>  <br>  Or if you really want to save some $$ Nikon D40 and a VR lens or two.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	D80 is better.You can get D80 body only and get VR lens separate<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref%255F%3Dnb%255Fss%255Fe%26field-keywords%3Dnikon%2520d80%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Delectronics&tag=computer0bd-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a>

But there are a lot of local companies in your country that makes cheap headsets with built-in mics!<br>  <br>  Try to buy them, not because its cheap, but because you want to SUPPORT your COUNTRY! :)).

You can get em at either glasses shops or electronics places cuz they're also great to clean LCD screens. Either that or a soft cloth washed without fabric softener...but I dont recommend that cuz of possible scratches    2. Go to myxer.com, they come as texts. Then when you get it in (if they didnt block the internet too) go into the message, click options, then extract data. Click the website (should be the third option) then hit options again, and go to connect. Should work just fine

Make sure any non-rechargeable battery you buy is alkaline.|`|TuLOVv5taa	I dont think it does anymore than other batters like AA|`|n2IKJh5Daa	Yes, Energizer AAA works better than local drugstore brands that may be cheaper.

Get a steering wheel, a few friends and be prepared to lose a few hours playing this one! Some of the tracks from previous Mario games are on their such as Peach Gardens and Bowsers castle from the N64 version. You won't regret buying it I promise! Even my gran loves it!

RyvKws7Laa	Model numbers matter.  If the TVs are fairly equivalent, the Samsung will usually be better in picture quality.  But it depends what models you're looking at, as perhaps the Sony you're looking at is one of the elite Bravia's that might actually be better than one of the entry level Samsungs.  But if you go top Samsung vs top Sony, I go top Samsung all the way.  Samsung is hands down the leader in LCDs right now.  They make better panels (Sony buys its panels from Samsung pre-2008 and is now buying them from Sharp).|`|KkzHfEFZaa	I've had Sony TVs and they tend to be bad. They don't last long, and my last one almost outlasted the warranty. I don't know about Samsung but if that is your only other choice, go with that.

RpCwfcRzaa	The batteries start to lose their charge and can't fully charge after awhile. Just buy a new one. They're only $20.|`|nAf24HBUaa	its called a charge and play kit for a reason it charges the battery as you play and only enough power for you to play it does not give the controller a full charge|`|fv6jIn59aa	I got the kit and it stop working so I bought a new cheaper one called play & juice by pelican and it works excellent.
xFt2n0iFaa	RELOADED just came up with a new version for NBA. NBA 2K9.Its with a third party installer cause it uses Steam. No crack needed.    My advice get the RELOADED one.     Have fun.
F67IRVmvaa	Actually, you could set your iPod to "MANUALLY MANAGE MUSIC AND VIDEOS" and you don't have to sync your iPod. You could simply click-and-drag the music onto your iPod... once it's there, you can erase it off of your iTunes.    Also, with you iPod set to manual you can connect to your friend's computers and do the same. Your iPod won't sync.    To do this:    (1) Connect the iPod into YOUR computer.  (2) Click on your iPod, once it shows up on iTunes.  (3) Click on "Manually Manage Music and Videos"    A message will pop up telling you that you'll have to eject the iPod manually - click "yes" or "okay". This means that you'll have to hit the "Eject" button before removing your iPod from the computer.    That's it. Now, all you have to do to get your songs and movies into your iPod is to click-and-drag them there. No more syncing!      Hope I helped!
dMBSE8ilaa	Make sure your files are really .mp3 files, right click on the music file and check the extension is .mp3, if it's not convert it. If they are .mp3 files then I don't know. Also your phone may only support 1 GB micro sd cards and not anything more.
YKc3YrxXaa	You can choose the Wi-Fi option that many people choose because it is cheap and easy to do. As you said, you have a wireless router, so the steps to connect to the home network should be fairly easy. Things you will need:PLAYSTATION?3 computer entertainment system (Note: PLAYSTATION 3 40GB / 60GB / 80GB / 160GB models ONLY (20GB model does not have built-in Wi-Fi connectivity))  SIXAXIS? wireless controller (and USB cable)  AC power cord  A high-speed Internet account (cable or DSL) with an Internet Service Provider (ISP)  Router  Wireless router compatible with 802.11b or 802.11g Wi-Fi standards  Or an Ethernet (wired) router with a Wireless Access Point (WAP)  You may need to open firewall port numbers on your router to connect to the Internet.  The PLAYSTATION 3 will not connect to the Internet through the USB ports.    1. Power-cycle ALL network equipment.  Turn off (unplug) ALL of your network equipment, including any wireless access points, routers, Voice Over IP (VOIP) modems, and broadband modems for two (2) full minutes. See How to power cycle PLAYSTATION 3 network devices for more details.    2. Confirm that your internet connection is enabled.  In the XMB? home menu, go to Settings icon (Settings) > [Network Settings ] > [Internet Connection] and select [Enabled].    3. Scroll down to [Internet Connection Settings] and press the X button icon button.    4. When prompted, "Do you want to continue?" select [Yes].  On the next screen, select [Wireless] as your connection method and press the X button icon button.    5. Pick "Scan" and press the X button icon button.    6. From the list, pick your SSID and press the X button icon button.    7. On the next screen, press right on the directional pad to continue - do NOT press the X button icon button to [Edit].    8. Pick your WLAN Security Setting (either WEP or WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK).  If none, pick [None] (and skip the next step).  Press the X button icon button.    9. If you selected a Security Setting, enter your security key with the keyboard.  Press the [Start] button to exit the onscreen keyboard.  Press right on the directional pad to proceed to the next screen.    10. The system will check your network configuration settings and display the information.  Press the X button icon button to save these settings.    11. Test the connection on the next screen. Press the X button icon button to start the test.    12. When the test is complete (usually less than a minute), it will display the results ("Succeeded" or "Failed").  If you have successfully connected to your network, congratulations, you have completed the network setup process.    You can also buy a 100 ft. cable and run it through your house. The cable will cost $12.90 on eBay with free shipping. You should make sure that 100 ft is actually enough long before you buy though...  Keep in mind that I am neither seller nor advertiser of the item and I just used the first one that popped up under the search "Ethernet cable" on eBay. I do not guarantee the quality of the item.    Then, you hook up one end of the Ethernet cable to your PS3 and one end to your router. Assuming the PS3's and the router's Ethernet port is working, you should have a wired, steady connection.    Hope this helps!!|`|H162bS7kaa	Very simple, you need a wireless router hooked up to a DSL or Cable modem and the brain power to know how to set it up in the PS3  network settings.      Its really easy, takes about five minutes and then you will be playing in the wonder land known as online gaming.  Becareful though, you will lose hours or even days of your life once you start...lol.    Enjoy|`|sbNnnPewaa	phone line/internet connection  wireless router  ps3    turn on ps3 goto settings network settings then select wireless then scan(u might have to push discovery button on router)...enter wpa/wep code...(found on router)  save then connect  should work ok then
vf5gLYEaaa	yes there is you need to unsync it first in order to that, connect your ipod, open itunes, go to your ipod, you should see a pic of your ipod, then below are a list of options, click sync music and videos, so its unmarked, and click mange own music and videos(something like that), then on the bottom right there is a button that saids "apply" click and there|`|KNYF1hnhaa	The way the iPhone is designed, it will only allow you to sync music from one iTunes library on one computer.  This is due to digital copyright laws and without hacking the iPhone software and voiding the warranty, there is no way around this.
vf5gLYEaaa	yes just  trasnfer all the music from the old ipod to the itunes libary  by dragging and dropping it, then when you connect your new ipod just sync it or drag and drop the songs onto your ipod

SKkE3fK1aa	The GPS is real as well as the one in the Nokia N95, N96 etc. but you must know that the GPS will only GET THE COORDINATES. In order for you to know where you are, you need to use a MAPS applications with the GPS.<br>  <br>  When you are in an area with no service, you can use the GPS and MAPS as long as you are in eye-to-sky contact (outside). Also, if you do not want INTERNET to download maps, you should manually download them before going to the area with no coverage. Go to your PC, and get the application for the GPS Maps to download maps for it.|`|mJpwJbaXaa	It depends if your version of BB has GPS integrated. I have the 8320 and doesnt have it, but what Google Maps does is figure out my position by triangulation, using the antennas that T-Mobile has. Is not very accurate, but can help you in some situations.|`|XcF4L6KMaa	Blackberry GPS functions very well. And you dont have to be online to use it. Blackberrys actually come with a maps program, "blackberry maps"
wZsKG8bPaa	It won't hurt it.  Might not help much but it can't hurt anything.

Though the best thing that could happen is if you get the RROD in about 2 months and get one of the new 360s that should (in theory) not get the RROD. Though microsoft have said this before and it didn't work.|`|l4M6FbJOaa	ive had an xbox 360 for a while. all you have to do is give it breaks from time to time and dont hit it or anything.|`|SmprA8m7aa	I found some thing related to your question at xboxclinic.. you should find out more before you do it|`|xF7dJgFlaa	intercoolers are good idea but can be noisy, one thing i have noticed after having two rrod xbox's, try to install game you are mainly playing to your hardrive (goto games library select game you want then it gives you the option to install to hardrive) it takes up memory space but you save extra wear by playing from hardrive, you still need to put the disc in put it dosen't have to play from the disc.|`|2FgbcyLhaa	They do make external fans but only the intercoolers which usually draw more power from the 360 resulting in faster RROD and they spin the 360's internal fans faster or slower not sure.

SAVE THE CONSOLE!!!!!|`|AWP2raLqaa	no just let it vent itself or buy a intercooler fan for a fiver from gamestation (pre-owned)

6S3P1XFPaa	HI 1080 or 720 are the number of lines top to bottom .P means they are refreshed every frame , i means every other line is refreshed with each frame . <br>    HD ready TV's will have a digital tuner ( freeview ) and atleast one HDMI port . <br>  <br>    Up to and including  42" 720P is OK above this get a 1080P .

Full HD is better ( 1080p ) but if you want to save money on a smaller set there are lots of 768 line TV's still out there and its not easy to tell the difference. <br>   I would stick with LCD .|`|AA12180617	HD Ready is a OLD term used on older models (often with only 7689 lines instead of the full 1080) that were first produced and some did NOT have HDMI sockets nor have TV tuners that were upgradeable for DVB-T2 for hi Def Freeview if and when its introduced.<br>  <br>  Also Plasma is on its way out except for  screens over 50" and in commercial environments.<br>  <br>  Go for the LCD FULL HD!

pTyAKKkfaa	you can either ignore it,change your number or get in touch with the network and they could point you in the right direction.<br>  If the person is sending nasty malicious things then note down the dates and times and keep the calls/txt's on your phone as you may need a crime reference number from the police to have the number blocked.
tsn34pS4aa	if you are going to go to the store anyways after doing this form, you may as well just go to the store and have them do the credit check, because it only takes about 5 mins, and you will know right then and there weather or not you have to pay a deposit.<br>  <br>  but to answer you, if it does not ask for your social security number, full name and address, then no. it is just gathering your information so you have it all in one place when you go to the actual store.

LIUsQtLqaa	A podcast is a series of audio or video digital media files which are distributed over the Internet by syndicated download, through Web feeds, to portable media players and personal computers. Though the same content may also be made available by direct download or streaming, a podcast is distinguished from most other digital media formats by its ability to be syndicated, subscribed to, and downloaded automatically when new content is added. Like the term broadcast, podcast can refer either to the series of content itself or to the method by which it is syndicated; the latter is also called podcasting. The host or author of a podcast is often called a podcaster.<br>  <br>  The term is a portmanteau of the words "iPod" and "broadcast", the Apple iPod being the brand of portable media player for which the first podcasting scripts were developed . Such scripts allow podcasts to be automatically transferred from a personal computer to a mobile device after they are downloaded

Xa98Zj10aa	yes i think its definitely worth it the story writing skills of Rockstar have increased dramatically since making GTA 4  this story is very different and refreshing and definitely fun the story took me just under 8 hours to complete but iv'e already racked an extra three hours doing the new side missions the new multiplayer modes are great the new bike handling physics (and bikes) are fun and the characters are cool. don't listen to the other two as i have a sneaking suspicion one of them has a PS3 (just the way they answered the questions especially second answer) anyway i'd say it was definitely worth it its given me hours of enjoyment and i'm sure it would for you too. the short answer is definitely  yes why haven't you got it yet lol happy gaming|`|d3ifIHPlaa	No.<br>  GTA IV was good, so they just leave it in it's legacy and not destroy it's image by bringing out a poor add-on for it.<br>  Expensive aswell.|`|9hxg6sjPaa	Not really. Too short.
Vf0g0q8uaa	Yes, if you type in pantech matrix pro on youtube, the very first video should be called pantech matrix pro (unboxing). I dont know how he got the matrix pro 5 days before its release, but yes, the guy says in the video that it is springloaded.
Vob62XChaa	Differences in New Play Control! Pikmin:<br>  <br>  Controls that use the Wii pointer<br>  Supports widescreen<br>  Its save system (on the GameCube if you didn't complete the game in under 30 days (in game days) it would be game over but on the Wii you can go back and repeat a day)<br>  <br>  It is up to you whether or not it is worth it. If you haven't played it before then I suggest you buy it.|`|ncCWnApDaa	Simply the controls, meaning it will be redesigned to use the wiimote, not redesigned in game terms, though it may look a little better on wii graphically, its still the exact same game it was on GC, which means if you think about it Zelda was really the first of those even though it wasn't titled as such.
4cMuedpWaa	Think it this way.<br>  <br>  If all the use of your notebook is about internet, email, instant messaging, the iPhone can do all that and more.<br>  <br>  Why would you need the Macbook...?<br>  <br>  Go get the iPhone, get another present and you can save money.|`|BaFgY7Dcaa	MacBook. You will not be disappointed.|`|7C4GeHxOaa	Well, it depends. If you need a laptop, then a macbook is worth it, but if you already have a laptop then an iphone is really cool. Personally I would get the iphone.|`|Rs5QTZ85aa	iphone, the macbook isn't as great as everyone says, it's just thin, that's all.|`|MRODFWgmaa	iPhone for sure you could save up for the mac later.|`|u3YvK5C2aa	A Macbook is better.
yrQFXxcXaa	Use a dvd recorder,record whatever you want of the PS3 then put the disc in the pc drag files to desktop,download vlc player open the VIDEO_TS folder select a file play with vlc & there is an option in vlc to take snapshots from the film ; )|`|ad2faoKcaa	You may need a screen capture device !
lnV00iQxaa	I haven't had any issues with my Motorola KRZR K1.
4cMuedpWaa	There is no 100% Official New about it.<br>  <br>  Rumors say that a new version of the iPhone is on the works that will support the new 3G protocol HSUPA (up-link speeds up to 5.76 Mbit/s) which is supposed to be faster than current HSDPA but it will need network improvements by the carriers.<br>  <br>  Anything else is pure speculation and there is no official new/leaked new to confirm a better camera and whatever else improvement.<br>  <br>  Knowing APPLE, you should definitely expect hardware and software improvements based on the feedback from the iPhone 3G.<br>  <br>  Upon this feedback, you can hope for a faster network support, increased internal memory (32GB/64GB?), a better camera and definitely, hopefully a MUCH better battery. ALL this unfortunately is PURE speculation, again.<br>  <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would definitely wait to see if the new iPhone will come out. If it does good. If it doesn't, well, I'll buy the iPhone 3G.<br>  <br>  No loss either way.<br>  <br>  And people, please, don't call it iPhone 4G, there is NO 4G network and you just confuse everyone who doesn't know better.<br>  <br>  the next iPhone will be the iPhon 4TH Generation, NOT 4G.|`|XkidpdPWaa	Who cares? The iPhone is really bad. Just buy a Blackberry.|`|tkkpUGuwaa	whetever anyone says there no pictures of the new iphone apple are going to release a new iphone, apple releases new ipods every year <br>  2007-iphone 2008 iphone 3g so hopefully this year the iphone 4g should be relesed <br>  and asfar as leeked pictured go there are no oficial iphone 4g pictures yet they are all pictures made by fans <br>  i think you should wait for the iphone 4g apple always make big improvements in their devices i bought a ipodtouch a mounth before ipoftouch 2g and now i feel i should have waited so just wait for the iphone 4g it will be worth the wait|`|rQgYL4Zzaa	im not sure about the iphone but i have heard that there will be a new lg prada called lg prada 2 which has a slide qwerty keyboard. I think it will have 5 megapixels and it will be released just in time to be the competition with the n97 which is pretty much the same thing|`|u3YvK5C2aa	I suggest that u wait because apple is planning to release a new iphone called the iPhone 4G.it's pictures have been leaked out.You can view them in google.
42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	Actually...I'd be surprised where there not a patch that allows it to be run on Vista.<br>  <br>  That being said...<br>  Battlefield 1942, Battlefield Vietnam<br>  Call of Duty, Call of Duty: United Offensive, Call of Duty 2<br>  Breed (from cdv)<br>  Castle Wolfenstein (all of them)<br>  Doom, Doom 2<br>  Halo, Halo 2<br>  etc...(hundreds of them)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Xxviy63Paa	If call of duty 4 isn't going to run, then how is crysis or bioshock? Those games are equal to call of duty or better.<br>  <br>  You could get an older game, like quake 3 or Halo 2. How about Battlefield? Bad Company probably wouldn't work, but the older titles would. Star Wars Battlefront 1 is a great game too.<br>  <br>  Try Alien Arena 2008. It will run as long as you've got around 1.5ghz clock speed and a decent video card. It has probably the best graphics of any free shooter in existence. A close second would be World of Padman.<br>  <br>  You could also get a lot of your XP games back by getting another hard drive (A cheap used 20gb drive would do) and install linux on it. A lot of good shooters from the past few years have DIY linux ports. That includes MOH Allied Assault. All you need is the game disc, and download the free porting tools and run them. This is true for all Unreal Tournament and Quake titles, and all Doom titles, all Descent titles, return to castle Wolfenstein, and many more. to find one try googling "[game name] linux port" and it will probably be on the first page if it exists.<br>  <br>  Lets see... How about Serious Sam, that's another one that's older but has good graphics... (another one that's got a port, too)<br>  <br>  a lot of people have turned to these ports because of Vista.|`|U4Vxe6FTaa	Crysis (set graphics to lowest... even though its on low graphics still good)<br>  <br>  Crysis2 - warhead<br>  <br>  F.E.A.R. - F.E.A.R. 2 (coming soon)<br>  <br>  Farcry 2<br>  <br>  Mirror's Edge (First person but not a shooter, its more of urban running, try it out its interesting)<br>  <br>  Clive Barker's Jericho.<br>  <br>  -------------------------<br>  <br>  if your into MMOFPS (Massively multiplayer online first person shooter)<br>  <br>  then try:<br>  <br>  Crossfire<br>  Operation 7<br>  wolfteam<br>  battlefield heros (coming soon)|`|CNFMta5faa	Counterstrike games are good if u like that kind of thing<br>  also games like command and conquer are good<br>  and some halo games are good|`|MFFwll7taa	Try these games:<br>  <br>  BioShock<br>  World in Conflict<br>  The Witcher<br>  Half-Life 2<br>  Gears of War<br>  The Wheel of Time<br>  Wolfenstein 3D|`|icEPC9t3aa	try SWAT 4 or Wolfenstein. if is fake you can also play online we it.
f89f116400d4ff9b53b246c33e1753cdaa	Medion - Not bad cameras - usually supplied via ALDI.<br>  <br>  The size of the files also can be down to the quality the footage is taken in - higher the quality - the bigger the file.<br>  <br>  I use a programm called KANGUN video converter - it's free but you will have to search google for it as I can't find the link I had.<br>  <br>  This will convert most formats from one to another - eg AVI to Mpeg - FLV to Mpeg, AVI blah blah blah.<br>  <br>  Have a look on here for conversion software - www.majorgeeks.com<br>  <br>  They usually have loads of free software or links to free software.<br>  <br>  As for the DVD - need to know more about it - most DVD's can be ripped - try DVD Shrink 3.2 or above (again you'll need to find it on google I'm afraid)
XsZsk55Jaa	The audio output on the back of the TV need to go into a separate amplifier and the speakers are hooked up to that amp in the usual manner.  The jacks will usually be RCA type jacks but some newer TVs have a fiber optic digital connection.  Your amp would need a digital input.  Some TVs do have speaker out or headphone jacks so you could hook the speakers directly to your TV.  The output would specify the required speaker impedance.
HKS2hRk8aa	yes it can be prepaid
UtHnh0aHaa	Rs422 and rs 485 are very different protocols. The devices are not hierarchical and therefore not interchangeable.<br>  <br>  I'm curious as to what you need to accomplish. There are many ways to use different hardware such as CAN buss or other bridge controllers.<br>  <br>  There are so many sites that are educational and accurate supporting these technologies. One of the most useful I have found:<br>  <a href="http://www.dontronics-shop.com/fts_sitemap_cached.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.dontronics-shop.com/fts_sitem...</a><br>  <br>  Be sure to check the kits on the site and the information pages.<br>  <br>  I have dozens of tutorial site available if you specify your interest.

BYHmKxpdaa	I don't think 360s play .avi format. I have always just converted them to wma files and that always works. No way to get an update like that unless u have live. Perhaps u have friends that can update for u with their Live?|`|wIM3vNtwaa	You need the optional media update only available from LIVE. Connect to LIVE, try the avi disc again and it will prompt you to download, download it and it will run avi files

1F6KJt0oaa	It takes Polaroid SX-70 film.  You might still be able to find some but since Polaroid stopped making film it might be difficult.  Your best bet would be to see if you can find a Fuji replacement film or convert your camera to take Polaroid 600 which there is a replacement for but is still quite ubiquitous.|`|jYMUzFRzaa	I'm not aware of any "Polaroid 2000", but if it doesn't take standard pack film you're pretty hosed at this point.
