20090205133657AANnUNq	News & Events;Current Events	9.3 BILLION BUDGET for the Olympic Games in the UK?	 http://uk.reuters.com/article/domesticNe...       So the Government are to increase yet again the funds for this 'height' of entertainment!  With all us common folk losing jobs, worrying about bills,  mortgages and the dreaded recession, isn't it about time they spent these billions on things that really matter?   By the time this extravaganza comes to a head the only game we'll be able to offer and afford will be 'throw the pennies at the poor!!'
20090205131313AAiUeU9	News & Events;Current Events	Are the 'compensation experts' who create corporate packages valid experts or . . .?	. . . just shills?      Why is our economy failing? Is it because executives reward the wrong people for achieving goals that actually destroy their business and the overall economy with it? Are the management and compensation consultants who help devise thse goals and packages simply perpetuating a process guaranteed to fail? Something has got to be intrinsically wrong, permeated throughout the entire corporate culture, when financial sales people earn huge bonuses for abject failure, both individually and as a whole. Do you think we need bailouts or redefinition of the type of people to do these jobs, total redefinition of success metrics?

I'm doing an extra credit project for my college music class and it requires that I find current events (no longer than a month old) relating to World Music as well as Classical Music.  I've been looking and haven't found very much (a lot of outdated news).  If anyone could point me toward a credible source or interesting articles, I'd very much appreciate it.
20090205132108AA1Udoa	News & Events;Current Events	Who would win a fight between the Royal Navy and the Israeli Navy?	We all know how good Israel is at fighting the Arabs so i dont want to hear "oh they beat ed all the them Arab Armies up" in some distant war in which the Arabs were armed with sticks and stones.      If Israel came up against a modern Army roughly matching its size who would win?      So just imagine their is a naval battle e.g Prime minister Gordon Brown or the British Queen Elizabeth goes a bit mental and says he/she wants to blockade Israel and any ships heading towards their will be intercepted and be boarded by the Royal Navy.       So if Israeli navy has to break out the blockade can they succeed?       (Without their mummy the USA helping them out?)

20090205135831AAnvrJh	News & Events;Current Events	What do you think of the Somalian pirates after reading this?	I'll be honest and admit I haven't been paying very much attention to the stories of pirates until now. I read the word "pirate" in the headline and find there's some mental block that prevents me from reading it and taking it seriously. However, someone read this article aloud to me and as well as being able to consider the matter with a lot less giggles, I'm surprised there's not much media coverage of the circumstances that have created the pirates.       Read the article and let me know what you think after reading it.       http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/com...

20090205140305AAkCtY1	News & Events;Current Events	Do you think that the Congress and the President should demand that the execs who took bonuses, give it back?	I am speaking of those who took money as bonuses from the 350 billion dollar bail out that our children, grand kid,s and great grand children will be paying back. Surely if we are the "Government of the people, for the people and by the people." We should have representation that can take back our tax money that we have not even earned yet, from those greedy clueless fat cats who ruined the world's economy right?  A guy stealing a beer from a liquor store can go to jail or be shot as he runs out the store but taking millions of taxpayer money for yourself goes unpunished? Am I missing something here?

"In the midst of its campaign against Hizbollah and Hamas "terrorists", Israel has been accused by Britain of feting Jewish "terrorists" whose bomb attack killed 28 Britons 60 years ago today."    http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1524552/...    The Irgun and Stern Gang were terrorist groups, nothing more. Celebrating their attrocities (this one killed over 90 innocent people) is disgusting. Just as we condemn Al-Qaeda for celebrating such attacks so too must we condemn Israel.

Do you think our friends would think we were odd if they knew how much time we spent on here? lol  Has anyone ever gone cold turkey only to fall off the wagon?  I know I have.      So - why do you think it's so addictive?  Is it because:   1) We're all opinionated sods who love the sound of our own voices?   2) We want to help other people out?   3) It's a forum where (some of us) can safely voice objectionable views?   4) We're bored?

20090205105231AA7kC8M	News & Events;Current Events	Are we entering another Depression era?	Companies are going out of business everywhere it seems, and even those who are "making it" aren't really doing that well... My oldest brother has been unemployed for over a year and my husband just found out his company is shutting down production.  Costs are going up on a lot of food items and so is college tuition.  My mom lost all she had invested in the stock market and I can no longer afford eating out anymore.  Is this going to get worse?  Are more people going to lose their jobs?  Are more businesses on their way out?  I'm concerned that my dream of having my first kid within the next year or two will be overshadowed by a horrible economy.  Everything is so expensive but it seems like no one is getting a raise.  In fact, many peoples' wages are being cut.  When is this going to get better?
