20090309131745AAGzs4k	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Warriors cats name ideas? From the series written by Erin Hunter?	I need some Warriors cats name ideas. Not some n00b posting names for warrior-like cats, such as Titan or something. From the series written by Erin Hunter, with names such as Fireheart, Graystripe, Crookedstar, Spottedleaf, etc.   Please don't make them silly or irrational such as Destinyheart or something like that; sure, a cat in the series may know what a destiny is, but wouldn't include it in a name...    I suppose gemstone names are fine, such as a name beginning with ruby or sapphire or emerald. Thanks! :D

I am taking a course on Russian Soviet history and am around that time in the chronology of European history. What happened in Germany - it can be said - wasn't directly pertinent to what I'm learning about, namely, the emergence of the new Russian Soviet social, economic and political reforms. However, I try to supplement my readings with an elaboration of whatever else was happening in the geographical vicinity or around the same period, particularly if it is pertinent to the Russian milieu of the times. However, with midterms coming up I don't have enough time for tangents like these. Can someone please outline what the German Revolution was about? I am not looking for specific details, more like what the underlying cause or political tension was. Importantly, what were the political affiliations and ideologies about, and what was the outcome of the revolution. A few key facts won't hurt; I'm good at memorizing :) thanks so much.

20090309142204AA1wtK5	Arts & Humanities;History	How should I handle these antiques?	My fiance's great aunt and uncle are probably going to pass away by the end of the month. So they've been taking care of their wills and what not. My fiance is inheriting their house (they live in a house that used to be a plantation. It was built in 1823 I believe), anyways, it's been kept in the family and since we are getting married, they are giving it to us.      Not only that, but it has an old shed out back FILLED with a bunch of stuff. They were afraid to let their kids go through it because their kids were going to sell pretty much everything that belonged to them. So they allowed my fiance to go out there and take anything and everything we wanted. Well, there are TONS of stuff I found that I want to keep. I'm a history major and I love collecting old stuff. I don't want to give any of it to a museum as selfish as that sounds, though I do want to take care of these things and store them correctly. The house has a huge attic and I plan on putting everything up there in class cases and what not. A lot like how people display china in dinning rooms. Anyone have any tips to offer me about preserving these antiques?       What I've took was:      *A tin of musket balls from the Civil War   *A school text book that was PRE Civil War   *A lot of confederate paper money (I havn't counted it all out yet)   *A valentine from my fiance's great aunt and uncle   *A World War Two uniform   *A confederate Civil War uniform(with small blood stains on it that I do NOT want to wash off)   *An army dagger that was used in World War I   *A rifle from World War I   *A pistol from Word War II   *A gun from the Civil War   *A republican party membership card with Hoover on the front   *A journal of a civil war soldier(Someone way back in the family)   *A 1,000 dollar bill from Germany that has Adolf Hitler on the front of it   *Every single National Geographic magazine ever published up to about a year ago   *Sitting out in the garage is an original Model T.

20090309144602AAJ2udJ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What are your opinions about why Twilight isn't "The Best Book/Movie Of The Decade"?	The "#1 Best Seller" title the reviewers give it makes me believe Judgment Day begins in the year of 2012. Okay, that is harsh, but I can ask without shame if people cherish this book and movie because they don't regularly read books or watch good films. Yes, I am a girl, and a fellow writer. The book is perfectly good for "FictionPress.com", but not the "Best Book Ever" public title. I mean, I can relate to Bella's character, and I love that so much, but no, it's not even a good vampire novel. It's got its ups and its downs. However, the reason I don't favor it seems different than other Anti-Twilight groups. So, those who don't gush over it, why don't you think it's the best, and why do you think it's not well-written? I'm curious - I was trying to find why people don't like the writing, because it doesn't bother me too much, but that's the most popular claim.

20090309164136AA2ffM2	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Who wants to read three paragraphs? Which one is the best?	Two friends and I are having a contest. Whose paragraph sounds better? All three paragraph are the first introductions to a character. Our stories and writing styles are very different. Paragraph 1 is from a fantasy story that takes place on earth roughly 400 million years in the future. Paragraph 2 is taken from an action/romance about the mafia, government corruptness, and an assassin. Paragraph 3 is from a science fiction story that involves genetic crossing between humans and other species as a plot point. Give a 1-10 rating for paragraph one which follows:      Picture a young man, his dark leathery wings the same colour as his oily black hair; his eyes the colour and opalescence of grey moonstone. Akin to the typical citizen of Moonlight, his fingers are clawed as a cat’s and his pale skin appears to hold a certain flaky fluorescence. On his chin are the scant, barely visible beginnings of a beard. Loved by none, lover of no one, Shaft of Moonlight is a Wanderer. The Wanderers are generally treated with the same hospitality as lawyers or taxmen, as you surely know.   Picture the ever-present-over-water smog, being penetrated by a sudden ray of blinding rose light, and the brimstone brine that blanketed the brackish floor of the lake being dissolved by this light.       Now a 1-10 rating for paragraph two:      As the sun quietly set on the horizon, Nathaniel found it ever more difficult to concentrate. There were so many things that could go wrong at any moment; in fact, it was a miracle that they had lasted this long without being taken out. He admired his father for keeping the mob so well organized, however, he knew that he could not possibly do so well himself. Not only that, but people were determined he never get a chance to lead. With twelve known attempts on his life, and possibly more that never got off the ground, Nathaniel Skye is one of the few teenagers ever to face the perils of death by assassination.    Because of this, and much more, he is currently writing a suicide note.      Paragraph three:       Leo jumped down from one of the rafters on the thirty-foot-tall ceiling and landed nimbly on his toes in the middle of the crowd. There was silence. While Ylva’s voice wavered uncertainly when she talked, due to some odd gene that controls the great howls of wolves, Leo’s voice was a sort of crooning; he could have any person entirely mesmerized when he talked. This has always seemed odd to me; cats are more knows for their silence than they are for their vocal abilities, but sometimes you never know.   “It doesn’t seem unethical to me, and doesn’t my opinion matter the most? Besides, if these good scientists didn’t behave incredibly ‘unethically’ I currently wouldn’t exist. And I will say I’m rather happy to be alive,” he continued.      Which paragraph is the best? And can you guess which of these characters become villians?

20090309152521AAJED3X	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Most Britons have lied about the books they read; maybe...but wasn't Orwell's '1984' a staple diet in schools?	Remember writing various essays about 'Airstrip One', 'Oceania', 'Unpersons' and 'Winston & Julia' - and after leaving school, reading it often.     Realise there are some books in the 'top ten' that would be hard work for anyone who wasn't in either Oxbridge, or the top red-bricked universities...'War and Peace' and 'Ulysses' to me was like climbing Everest backwards in a bearsuit - hence me only reading between ten and thirty pages of either - and that was in the days when I still had all my braincells (between 17 and 20).     Orwell's '1984' was top of the fib-list, which surprised me...does this mean the book is no longer used in schools - for during the time I was in my last year at school, Orwell was seen as 'fairly easy'.

20090309150944AAky37y	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can you give me any ideas for a good book?	I need to read a book for a book report, and can't think of any. I like to read. I prefer long books, at least 200 pages. I liked twilight, eragon, rangers apprentice, and harry potter. thank you!
20090309162437AAmDw43	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	And, once again, I'm bookhungry. Does anyone have any titles they'd like to toss my way?	I'm15, hate most books written for teens (except for those such as Thirteen Reasons Why, where the characters aren't even trying to relate, you just find something to latch onto in their rawness. In fact, I revoke that general statement. There are plenty of "Young Adult" books I'd like out there... I just want to throw the biggest apple I can find at Stephenie Meyer's face.) I love Catcher in the Rye (because that's SO original. And yes, I have read Someday This Pain Will be Useful to You.), Found The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime refreshing, I am a sucker for sighworthy Mitch Albom stuff, and most recently, I've fallen in love with Water for Elephants (Seriously, it's in the running for being my favorite.) I'm currently working on The Thirteenth Tale, which I'm finding a bit too addictive, as I'll be done with it soon... What should I read next.      Pretty much, the only thing I'm not a big fan of are the kind of "Romances" that are like times new roman porno,  and ridiculously Sci-Fi stuff, though I like a bit of fantasy, when done well... for example, I enjoyed the Scott Westerfeld stuff back in middle school, but was ready to shoot my english teacher like a bugger when we had to read Ender's Game.

20090309163806AAu84Fk	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How would you write the title of this story?	I have to write an essay about a short story we read from our literature text book.  The story is a section from the book, Night, by Elie Wiesel.  Because it is only a section, the title of the story in the book is "from Night".  So my question is how should I write the title of the story in my paper?  Would it be underlined/italicized because it is from a book?  Or would it be in quotation marks because it is technically a short story?  Is "from" part of the title of the story?  Sorry this question is kind of dumb but I really need to know.  It's due tomorrow.
20090309160218AA4I34k	Arts & Humanities;History	Thomas Hobbes, what do i wear? PLEASE answer!?	For my high school english class, i have to dress up as the philosopher Thomas Hobbes and answer questions that the class asks me in his character. I'm at a loss though, since i have no idea what to wear! half of my grade is dressing as the historical figure, but i don't know what to do.      I was thinking maybe dress pants, a shirt and a tie, but that isnt very specific. Also, i was considering wearing glasses but im not sure if Thomas Hobbes wore them.      Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!! thanks!
20090309164251AAjdrFR	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my writing.....any suggestions?	I wrote about a paragraph out of my fantasy story that I plan on writing for fun soon.Here it is.....      Karen Numasse proceeded cautiously down the dark, rather frightening, hallway that seemed to go on for an eternity. She would never have guessed that this was part of the same structure as the glorious Temple of the Light. Even the lower quarters of the white robes laid several stories above her. The stone floor was damp for some reason and Karen shivered as her foot stomped on something that squished under her weight, then shivered again simply because of the cold. She refrained from looking down at whatever it was she had trodden over, partly because of her fear that it may be yet another deceased rat and partly because she knew it would not have done any good. The corridors of the floors several stories beneath the ground level of the temple were very badly lit, and there were large gaps of darkness between the pools of light that surrounded the lanterns hanging on the walls. The servants often tried to skip their duties when they were ordered to light the lanterns this low in the temple as it was usually useless. Karen stared at every dwindling flame on every lantern that she passed fearing that it may go out any second. She could use Cal’Aldazar to light the hallway easily, but keeping the hallway lit for long would begin to drain her energy slowly, and the Father knew she needed all the energy that she could muster for this task. She scowled and gripped the note she clutched in her hand tighter as she stepped in yet another puddle, causing the hem of her dress to become even damper than before. Father of Light! She could have wept! No, she would not let her guard down; she needed every ounce of concentration she possessed to do this. Grinning slightly with relief as she entered a pool of light, she lifted up the letter that had brought her down here. Unfolding it and carefully smoothing it out, Karen read it yet again…..      excluding the parts that you have to have read the rest of the story to understand,was it interesting?What did you think of it?Any suggestions on how to make it better?Any input would be greatly appreciated.

20090309160607AAhieLW	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can you help me find this book I read a few years ago?	I can't remember the title or author, but a vague plot summary.  The main characters are a young gay man, his older and homophobic step-brother, and the step-brother's girlfriend.  The POV shifts from chapter to chapter, from 3rd to 1st person, and there are several sideplots running along the main story.  The older step-brother is in an up and coming rock band and in love with his girlfriend.  She is a liberal, free-thinking feminist.  The young gay man gets arrested for soliciting in the city.  He is sent to live with the girlfriend's grandmother to keep an eye on him and get him out of the small town where he is ostracized.  He meets the guitar player of the step-brother's band and they begin a relationship.      That is a rubbish summary, but it's most of what I can remember.  The book is actually better than it sounds there and I'd really like to find it to read again.  If any of that was recognizable, your help would be greatly appreciated.      Thank you.

Know that you have something amazing in your hand,    And let yourself be overcome by its powerful message.   If you really want to know me, grab a pair of dance shoes.   Feel hours of hard work in the beaten leather.   If you really want to know me, cuddle a puppy.   See its shining eyes beg you to play with it.   Sense the loyalty and love the adorable creature has given you.   If you really want to know me, discover happiness.   Experience a grin from ear to ear and laugh at everything.   Be optimistic because life if too short to be anything else.

Evelyn took her share of the money and invested it into a small restaurant called  Le Lune Blue. Evelyn watched her brother carelessly gamble away his money. she tried to stop him but he would not listen. She watched Mason go to the point of no return he lost what he had left of his life    Evelyn felt like the older child trying to take care of Mason when no one else would . So she gave him a job thinking she could final do some good in this world. He was always late but she could look past it they had been through a lot and he needed time to heal. Finally after a week she got feed up with it when he came to work dunk off his *** reeking of stale alcohol and grabbing on the waitresses in not a friendly manner.      She took a deep breath in and counted to 10 but he had not disappeared like she had hoped he would. She knew what she had to do.    “Mason can I see you in my office now?” before he could protest she was walking through the back area that led to her office.

All of them center around the contents of a person's mind. I don't really know how to start it though, because the story is about his mind in the form of a house. So I was wondering on how to start off this, I have so many good ideas but I can't figure out how to go from real life, or outside his mind to the house on the inside. It sounds really weird I know, but I really need help on this.

20090309091834AAHEu7n	Arts & Humanities;History	Do you think America is a more equalized country, since the 1877?..?	I'm arguing that America has become a more equal country, because at one point blacks couldn't vote, and now there's a mixed man as president.       At the same time though, I know its not equal, as some races are not as advocated, and with affirmative action, some suing can take place because of the quotas that have to be met.        I do believe America has made progress...      its a more equal country, than what it was over 200 years ago.      What is your take on this issue and WHY?..      * no lame answers*

20090309174559AAHVC7Y	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Is this a good poem to enter for the literary fair?	The Memory.    J.Z      Never settled, always gone,   Almost like, the pretty dawn.    Give or take a day or two,   The forgotten memory   Won’t be back for you.    You want to remember,   But you seem to forget.    Because you caused,   The silly regret.   If you smash it and break it,   It won’t come back,   Only in the form,   Of a slap.    Give it a good shake,   But don’t let it break.   Maybe for a second,   You’ll have a date.   With the happy memory,   That you nearly ate.    Perhaps you’ll see the sky,   And the way the clouds fly,   It’ll be a good way,   To end your worthless days.   The remembrance of the memory,    Was a memory you've slaved.      I have a couple, but my sisters claims that this one is my best.   To summarize, it's about a happy memory that you've changed into a bad memory. But there's not really a way of seeing it the way you once saw it. Perhaps for awhile but otherwise it's a lost cause.

Being a citizen is important to me showing respect to my flag and country.   Many people don’t respect the flag which I think is really sad. Thinking about all the ways citizenship is important to me.   I will always remember America will always be home of the free and land of liberty. I will always respect my country and my liberty.

What does this poem mean exactly? i know its the road less traveled but is it a good or bad ending?      Robert Frost (1874–1963).  Mountain Interval.  1920.         1. The Road Not Taken              TWO roads diverged in a yellow wood,     And sorry I could not travel both     And be one traveler, long I stood     And looked down one as far as I could     To where it bent in the undergrowth;         5         Then took the other, as just as fair,     And having perhaps the better claim,     Because it was grassy and wanted wear;     Though as for that the passing there     Had worn them really about the same,         10         And both that morning equally lay     In leaves no step had trodden black.     Oh, I kept the first for another day!     Yet knowing how way leads on to way,     I doubted if I should ever come back.         15         I shall be telling this with a sigh     Somewhere ages and ages hence:     Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—     I took the one less traveled by,     And that has made all the difference.

For an essay, we have to find places where the characters are able to see things from other people's point of view. We need four examples. I've got more than four, but they're kind of loosely interpreted. Like they could be if you really think about it, but they're not blatantly stated. Can you give me some examples of how people in the novel see things from someone else's viewpoint? Thanks.       Here's what I think:   Scout and Burris Ewell, Walter Cunningham, Miss Caroline   Jem and Boo, Ms. Dubose   Obv. Atticus and Mr. Cunningham.

20090309123959AAYG93j	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What would you choose?	I am making a Fantasy-story with Light, Darkness & Twilight within it. It's about a boy who lost his parents, his name is Zero. But in truth he is The Chosen Hero. He has a legendary weapon (Looks like the Aerial Blades wielded by Xemnas in Kingdom Hearts 2 or the lances wielded by Shanao in Castlevania Order Of Ecclesia). With this he protects the worlds against evil. But in one point of the story he sacrifies himself for his best friend, a girl named Dawn. He's falling into Darkness but because of his strong heart and all the power hide in it, it's finally about to awaken, he'll be neither or Light or Darkness, thus Twilight. He fights villains from Light and Darkness and his biggest opponents are The God Of Darkness & The Goddess Of Light.      So that is kinda the story. But I need a name for the story. Because of the Twilight serie from Stephanie Meyers I can't use the title Twilight. Here are some examples for the title (I like also title with 1 or 2 words) :   - Into the Twilight   - Between Light & Darkness   - Between Dawn & Dusk   - (From) Dawn to Dusk   - Beyond Dawn & Dusk   - Beyond Light & Darkness   - Beyond Twilight   - (From) Light to Darkness   - (I was thinking maybe something with Horizon?)   - (Something else, like.........., I would also like a title with 1 or 2 words)      * I doesn't know a name for the weapon either so maybe you've got an idea, I thought of "Enerblade" but you can also choose own ideas.      I would like Latin or Greek words for the name of the title/weapon also.      And maybe you know a better way to let awaken the Twilight powers from Zero, I fought this way is a little bit stupid. All ideas are welcome.      And I'm sorry if grammar is that worse, I had got some reactions about that.   Thanks ^.^

20090309135016AAZY0d9	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you guys think of my writing?	As I walked out of my apartment building with Toto--my dog--Mark shows up with two cups of Starbucks coffee. It was cold for a morning in June so he was wearing a black Zoo York jacket and jeans. I smiled as he handed me my cup.   “Hey Toto.” He looked down at the Cairn Terrier and smiled. He barked back happily.   Mark pulled down his aviator shades and smiled. “You ready?” he smiled. Toto darted off as soon as the words left his mouth.    And then we heard a flashbulb. Actually, it was multiple flashbulbs. I looked up to find about three or four cameramen snapping pictures.   Being a celebrity sucks. It’s like you’ve wished away your right to walk your dog with your boyfriend without it ending up on the pages of Us Weekly.    But we tried to ignore them. I mean. I’ve been mastering the arts of paparazzi avoidance for two years now, it can’t be that hard.   But when we were halfway through the walk, a cameraman said something that made me smile.   “MARK WE SAW YOU WALKING OUT OF A TIFFANY AND CO A WEEK AGO. WHERE’S BRIDGET’S ENGAGMENT RING?” they shouted.    I smiled to myself as Mark blushed. “Dude, it’s not like that.” He smiled, wrapping an arm around me. it was obvious by the way he was staring down at my dog that he was nervous. I wondered what he was thinking.   The cameraman didn’t go away though, he kept talking. “WELL WE GOT A PICTURE OF YOU BUYING A RING?” he said.    Why did they have to shout everything? It was getting really annoying. I slipped my sunglasses on and then tried to ignore the flashbulbs.    “I didn’t buy a ring.” Mark lied. I knew he was lying…I could tell by the way he didn’t take his eyes of the ground. “Goodbye.” He said to the cameras. We had reached the door to my apartment again.   As we got inside, Toto stood on his hind legs and pawed at my leg. I quickly got down and picked up the tiny dog. I undid the leash and smiled.    “So what you get from Tiffany’s?” I asked jokingly. Mark rolled his eyes and wrapped an arm around me.   “Let it go Bridge.”

20090309135010AAq6RSN	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of this beginning?	I first wrote this story when I was 16, I'm 21 now and re-writing it to try and get it published. What do you think of the opening? This is only the first 655 words (the full chapter is over 2700 words didn't think it would be good to post it all lol).      A piercing beep broke the early morning silence, realising that the noise was refusing to go away a young fumbled under her pillow still fighting the instinct to wake up. “Five thirty is not a time God invented for people wake up at…or even be awake.” She grumbled as her right hand continuously fumbled under the pillow for her mobile phone. Feeling frustrated she shoved herself into a sitting position and yanked the pillow off the bed hurling it across the room. There laid the culprit, pushed to the edge of the mattress hovering between the headboard and the gap. Seizing it she was about to click ‘Dismiss’ when she thought better of it and hit the ‘Snooze’ button with an irate thumb.      “Alexandra?”      “I’m sleeping!” She called out, reaching over she grabbed the discarded pillow and slammed it back onto the bed as she simultaneously yanked the duvet over her head. It was as if she believed that by simply retreating under the duvet the statement would suddenly become true.      “Then maybe you should wake up? That is unless you want the disciplinary your boss keeps threatening you with?” Alexandra jumped up from her bed and reached it in two steps. Throwing it open so she could glare at Patrick, the only other person in the flat of three who had to be up at this unfortunate hour.      “It would be worth it! Because then I would get the sack and could actually do what normal people do at this hour and sleep!”      “Whoa, take a breath. Someone’s a grouch –”      “Someone didn’t sleep until two hours ago because of a certain someone’s late night antics!” Desperate to vent her frustration she moved to slam her door. At the last second she remembered Bree was still sleeping and instead closed the door softly. Sighing and rubbing her eyes vigorously she tried to get her mind to wake up. “Shower.” She whispered groggily and grabbed a towel from the bottom of her wardrobe along with a clean uniform.      “Hey! Don’t run all the hot water!” Patrick cried in an alarmed whispered and pulled a face when the reply he received was Alexandra poking her tongue out. She turned the water on so high that at first it scalded her skin. She quickly turned it down a fraction and began to wash, she needed to wake herself up – which the hot water did, but she didn’t need to give herself a third degree burn. As she washed she ignored Patrick constantly pounding on the door in an attempt to get her to hurry up – and to save him a little hot water. She really was angry at him for coming home drunk and stumbling around until he finally passed out at three am. Turning the water off completely, Alexandra reached over and grabbed the towel off a hook and quickly wrapped it around herself, her skin already breaking out in goose pimples from the cold. As she brushed her teeth she wiped the steam from the mirror and stared at reflection in the mirror. Her normally pale skin was flushed from the heat of the shower and steam and her damp hair had gone from mahogany to almost black. Forest green eyes stared back at her from the mirror; these were the most unusual things about her appearance. From the pupils sprouted an unusual pattern, a kind of clockwise spiral that you would most likely find in a cartoon of someone being hypnotised. And some people swore to her that her eyes did have that kind of effect on them, that if they stared into her eyes they’re feel themselves becoming lost. That all thoughts would leave their mind, their only concern being making her happy. Alexandra would merely laugh and roll her eyes in response. It was just a birth defect. Or at least she thought it was, she had no way of being certain.

20090309133743AA5GzQs	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What is the title of this book?	I was in Border's around Christmas time and found a book that I wanted.  I can't recall if it was on the sale table or the new releases table.  I'm pretty sure it was hardcover, but not positive.  It was written by a male author, I'm pretty sure it was fiction.  The story is told through a series of letters written by the main character.  I may be confusing this with another book I saw that trip, but I think the letters were written from prison or maybe a hospital as a way of looking for forgiveness.  I believe the main character had some sort of psychiatric problem.  And the book include some letters that character wrote to himself.  I should have picked up that book when I was there, but now it's killing me to remember what it was called or more about it so I can find it again.  Any suggestions?

20090309134428AAfJ4oB	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Help with a short story I wrote?	My english class was assigned to write a short story and I am in need with some help as how to end it and advice on what I have done already. So here it is:       I was sitting in my favorite park on a random Tuesday when I saw her. It was like most any other Tuesday, really. I come here on my lunch break, buy a sandwich from my favorite vendor, take a seat on my usual bench and watch the people wander by. Occasionally I’d throw a few bread crumbs to the birds or read an interesting looking article from a magazine that the previous bench user left behind for the future occupant’s entertainment.  But today, like most other Tuesdays I was just watching the world go by.     She was wearing a short aquamarine dress that hugged her in all the right places. Her legs long and snowy pale, as though she had been hiding somewhere cold all through this dreadfully hot New York July, made the thin fabric of her dress swish and ride up her legs a little with each step. Her hair tumbled down her back in a gorgeous cascade of chestnut brown and her elegant green eyes burned holes through me. Before this moment I never really noticed how important girls curves were, I mean, I’ve noticed them but never like this. The way her ankles arched to meet her calves, the curve of her calf to her thigh, the curve of her back meeting up to the gentle curve of her neck and the curve of that perfect nose.     I was hooked, and I couldn’t figure why everyone else in the park didn’t stop dead in their tracks to stare at this beauty. Then a crazy thought ran through my head: What if I went and spoke to her? Would she reply to me? Or would she just breeze by like she hadn’t heard anything? I imagined holding that perfectly sculpted hand in my rough calloused hand, her fingers tangled in mine in an unbreakable hold. Just to walk with her, to talk with her I knew that’s all I needed.     I glanced back at her I noticed the most peculiar thing; she was getting closer. She was walking towards me now!  What unearthly force would cause this miracle to happen? From front on she was even more striking, her cheekbones so sharp they cut through the air like knives, her full lips pulling gently pulled up at the corners like she just heard a good joke and the way her hips rhythmically swayed from side to side with each and every stride she took. Now she was still a good fifty or so feet away from me, but I could still feel my heart racing faster and faster with every graceful, beautiful step closer she took towards me. Thump –a-Thump. All I could hear was the blood pulsing through my ears and the sound of her clickity-clackity shoes hitting the pavement.  There was a feeling in my stomach that most people would call butterflies, but to me felt more like a stampede of rhinoceroses plowing through my guts. At this point she was about twenty feet away from me and I was beginning to wonder if maybe I should give a friendly wave or smile at her, maybe get up and meet her half way.  But maybe that would seem too anxious, I think I’ll just sit and wait for her to approach me; at that point it seemed like the safest bet.     By now she was about ten feet away and was slowing to a halt in front of me. I opened my mouth to say hi when I heard someone say “Hi honey, sorry I’m late”. It was my girlfriend.

I wasn't able to touch a piano for 6 months. Now I'm trying to relearn a piece I played last year and it just ISN'T coming along. I can't seem to control the keys, and I become very tense when I play the piece (Un Sospiro by Liszt). I know I can play this piece well, but I seemed to be "blocked". Have you ever experienced this? Any advice? Why am I so tense when I play this piece?         ARGGHHHHH!!!!

20090309174612AAX2CN6	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Please rate these poems about abortion?	I wrote these last night and I would like some critique on them   This one is the words of the child      Mommy   Do you remember me   I’m the little baby you didn’t want to keep   Mommy   Do you miss me   Do you ever wish that you had given me a chance   You decided that I wasn’t worth your time   Wasn’t worth a dime   Didn’t deserve a life   And now though, sometimes you cry   Wish that you had chosen right from wrong   I wish that I was there   Or that you could hear   Me say   Mommy I’m alright    Don’t worry anymore don’t feel sad    Someday we’ll meet for the first time   And I’ll be so glad   And you’ll never feel another drop of pain   Cause you’ll be safe   You won’t be afraid   And you’ll hold me tight   Hug me, and love me   Be it day or night   We’ll be together      This is the mothers words      Sweetheart   I'm sorry   I didn’t know what to do   They told me that I would be better off without you   And I just wanna cry    Cause I don’t understand why    I killed you   What did you do?   Why did I punish you   For things that weren’t your fault   How could let a part of me die   And Why   Would I    Punish you   For something you didn’t do   Just because you were an inconvenience   I murdered you   And I sometimes wonder what to do   Because the guilt becomes unbearable   And one day will you say that you love me   No you can’t how could you   But I know that somehow I’ll meet you in heaven   And I hope that you will understand that   I was confused   I thought it was the only thing to do   And now I wish that I   Had chosen life         And could you please help me with names.   Thankyou

I have this book than I'm working on I've had a couple different friends of mine to read it and they all give me constructive criticism but in for the most part they absolutely love it. I always said I wanted to get it published but most of the urban fiction publishing companies are in the states like Q'Boro and Triple Crown Publishing. Does Toronto or Canada have a publishing company that focuses on urban Fiction

20090309175122AAVgRrH	Arts & Humanities;History	Questions about Germans in Russia/Soviet Union?	This will be a wall of text, sorry. Not a short question at all.   I didn't know where to post this, should this be in genealogy?      Here is a SUMMARY of what I will be asking, but please read the whole thing.      1. Could someone born in the USSR be a German citizen at birth?   2. Did you have to illegally escape from the USSR to go to Germany in the 1940s?   3. Would the Nazi Army Youth allow someone in if they had knowledge that they were from the USSR?         My father's family moved from Württemberg, Germany to Russia in 1821. I do not know where they originally settled. Anyways, my grandfather was born in Odessa Oblast, Ukraine, USSR in 1931.      I know they were farmers and had kind of a tough life. His father was taken away (I guess by the government) for I don't know what, hiding wealth or food or something like that. He was apparently going to Siberia, but "died on trainride of starvation and freezing weather".      Ok so, apparently he has always been a German citizen. How can this be? I believe his parents from the Russian Empire. Why would the USSR allow someone to be a German citizen?      Anyway they left in the 1940's, I assume they escaped, and moved to Germany. My grandfather was put into the Nazi Youth. Did they lie about being full German or something? How did they cover up the fact that they had been from the USSR? Would they have allowed them to even get into Germany? I'm assuming they had to lie and cover it up somehow.   Right?      Anyway, they finally got to America in the 1950's.      My grandfather does not like talking about his past at all.   He considers himself American now.      Would you consider them more German or Russian? All of the food in their family is of Slavic origin save for a few dishes. He likes a lot of borscht, pelmeni, pierogi etc. They speak both German & Russian. We have a German last name but it seems like they have more Russian traditions??      But basically....I'm curious about those things. Could you seriously become a German citizen at birth if born in the USSR? Did they have to lie to get into Germany and such? I am assuming so because Germany was an enemy of USSR at the time .      Just curious how you think this all went down.
