20090221043106AAv9mXP	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	How Can I Control Weeds On My Farm This Spring/Summer?	I live in the mountains of Western NC. We always have farms going on and it seems like with every year the economy gets worse it gets bigger. Our main problem is of course the drought (we water if needed though with private well). But what really hurts us is the weeds. They seem to grow better in the drought and eventuallly take over the field. Last year we lined the field with newspaper and hay, it worked a little bit but still not the best. The corn field always gets destroyed due to the fact that the weeds grow faster than the corn durring drought conditions. Is there a type of poison that we have to use? We are not organic freaks, anything that will boost our harvest will work. Thank you.

About 20 minutes later their mum thought that all the dishes were in the dishwasher because they weren't in the sink. as she normally does, she opened the detergent dispenser and loaded the washing tablets and rinse aid and selected the 50 degrees plates Multizone cycle,(multizone - sprays the dishes from the top and bottom), water locked the door and started it. all of a sudden i was being washed and rinsed with about 30 plates, 20 cups and a pile of cutlery. after 3 hours of of being washed and rinsed and slightly dried on the low dry cycle, and their mum trying to look for her teatowel and dishcloth. the machine stopped. (by this time my friends went to the movies, so it was only me and their mum in the house.) then suddenly the door was pulled down and the tray i was on was slid out and i was grabbed by a pink tea towel, and the mum said rory, what are you doing in with the dishes, and she quickly dried me off with the tea towel and made sure i was ok.      Now i have this clear film all over my skin from the rinse cycle with the rinse aid, ive had a shower at her house but it is still there and i cant get it off. im staying at her house for a few days, because she said we will fix this,(my friends have gone on a holiday). how do i remove it, do i have to go in her front load washing machine with bleach to remove it? because it says on the bottle,"if on linen, wash in hot rigorous cycle to remove"

When we built our home in 2005,I went to a local distributor,as the general contractor & purchased the light fixtures I liked.  Unbeknown to me, I found out that they were a very reputable name in lighting fixtures(as I've been told).  The foyer light cost me $375.00 and each stairway sconce cost me $175.00. (if that helps)  For the life of me,I cannot remember the name brand...all I can recall is that is consists of 2 names(1st & last) of what I remember to be similar to a man's name.  Does anyone have any suggestions as to the name?  If I see the name, I will immediately recognize it!

20090221033732AAmwyd3	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Shall I color my walls teal & grey? (pics & detailed...)?	Hey guys!! =]   Could you please help me? I'm 14 and I want to color my room's walls someday. My room isn't too small and not even too big, too. ^^      At the wall across from my biggest window, there's my bed,   it looks kinda like this bed (color):  http://www.frenchshabbychic.co.uk/catalo...  but it's wider, it has got only one backing (at the head of the bed), not at the foot, and it's coated with fabric.      It stands with the head at the wall, and on that wand there are these huge wallstickers which look like orchids.   (these:  http://www.mikado-shop.de/images/product...  , they're affixed like on the first pic on the left.)      'Kay on the second wall there's my wardrobe, at the time it's white with black flower silhouettes, but I hate that pattern and I want to paint the wardrobe-doors. (Should go with the whole room, maybe you can help me??)      on the third wall theres a long white totally simple frame.   and there's a little black wooden table (TV), it looks a bit like this, but its way more massive and prettier (and it's not shining):    http://dma01.com/u/104/b/d2e535979d19a6d...  and next to the wardrobe theres a longish window.      on the last wall there's a big window and my desk (glass desk).      Sooo that was much information, so here's my question:      1) What do you think about the combination teal (like this  http://www.candlechem.com/images/D152tea...    and a elegant grey?? (I mean, one wall teal, one grey and so on..) I'm really not shure.   2) What would YOU propose for my walls?      Thank youu

20090221045909AAhNoiR	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Why does the furnace limit switch fault randomly occur but immediately when my furnace starts a cycle?	I have a 2 year old furnace 2 stage furnace.  It will run fine all the time for long periods without any problems.  However, every once in awhile, about 1 or 2 times a day, after the furnace has been totally off for awhile, the problem occurs right at startup.  When the furnace gets a call for heat from the thermostat, the high speed blower will kick on immediately before the burner has started.  The burner will start normally after the normal inducer fan cycle, and after about 1 or 2 minutes, the blower drops back down to the normal speed for heat.  Once this occurs, there is now a high limit fault(four flashes) in the fault history.      I am confused because the high limit does not occur when the furnace is warmed up, but at startup, after being off for awhile.  I have noted that the cycle previous to when this problem occurs ends normally.  This problem won't occur again for hours.  I don't understand why the high limit is occurring at start up.  Example of a normal cycle.  Inducer starts, burners start, blower starts on normal speed after about 30 seconds, burner runs until thermostat is satisfied, then 2 more minutes of blower.  Example of random problem.  High speed blower starts, inducer starts, burners start, blower drops from high speed to normal after about 1 or 2 minutes, burner runs until thermostat is satisfied, then 2 more minutes of blower, high limit fault code in the furnace history.

Hello All,  I recently rented an apartment in a building which is the last one on the street, and hence closest to the highway. There is heavy traffic on the highway, especially heavy trucks, some of which cause vibration in the whole apartment, from the front to the end. Its not a shattering of doors, etc type of vibration, and I usually only feel it when I'm sitting or sleeping. I dont feel much just walking around in the apartment. I inquired with the owner of the building about this, and he said not to worry about it as it has been happening for years! (I Wish he told me that before I rented it). Not all traffic causes the vibration - just the trucks. I am looking for advice on 2 things, firstly is there a long term risk of damage to the structure of the apartment/building by constant vibration, and secondly are there any measures I can take to reduce the effect of the vibration.     Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.    Thank you in advance.
