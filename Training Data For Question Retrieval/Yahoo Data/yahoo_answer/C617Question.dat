20090205191514AAlUcZG	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Can someone please help me understand him?	I just recently got out of a relationship that I've been in for the past year with a friend of mine that I've known for 20 years. We grew up together. Both have been married before and been thru bad divorces. We took things slow and had a great relationship. Only thing is that he had a girlfriend before me that was the first girlfriend after his divorce. And she really wasn't good for him at all. They were together for almost 2 years on and off. She has left him 3 times to go back to her ex boyfriend who doesn't get along with my friend at all. I personally think she uses him to make her ex jealous in hopes that he'll come running back to her faster. What hurts is my friend really cares about her and now she's back in his life. He is now giving her what he says is the 4th and final chance. He told me that if we are really meant to be together then it will happen but he has to know for sure that it isn't going to work with this other girl who was there before me. That hurts, but I really do care about him. In a back handed way I think he knows that it's not going to work with her either, but doesn't want to admit it. He's told me that I'm the only other person he could see spending his life with and that he does care alot about me but in order to move forward with me he's got to make sure this girl isn't right. He even admitted to me that I'm better for him then she is. Am I wrong to think she's going to leave him again if she's already done it 3 times? Will he come to his senses and choose me??? What do I do?

20090205192543AANIwN8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	She is back to the same old jeaulosy games??!!! WTF??!!!?	I know I posted this question before, but the thing is, is that I want to hear from you what you think is going on in her mind, I know that it depends on the person, but any advise would help.Thanx in advance         my ex came back acting lovely and stuff. we dated for a year and a half, she broke up w me coz she said I took her for granted...that was 6 months ago, since then I have been begging her to come back and she wouldn't, I did everything possible, I begged I cried, and instead she turned into hardcore drugs (Meth), she became a stripper, and was hooking up with so many guys (Very trashy people) at the same time. She told me that she had a misscarage two weeks ago. Now she left her apartment (Where she did all these things) and decided to go back to live w her parents, and planning to start working at mcdonalds again. Should I believe her? Basically, she ****** me up so many times, she would team up with someone she just met against me. She broke my heart, tore it, and stepped on it. And I am afraid to believe her. I'd rather live my life lonely and not to have those feelings again. Please advise.      Oh, and now she is back to the same sick jealusy games, where she leaves, dont tell me where she was going and dont reply for my texts, the thing is that am not really needy in general at all, but its the fact that I dont trust her, I dont know where she is at now. WTF, also how do I get her to stop this B.S, I mean whats wrong with ******* picking up the phone or texting back immediately??!!!
20090205192324AA7IiPK	Family & Relationships;Family	What will you do if your daughter is feeling left out because her sister has cancer?	i have a little cousin called nicole, who is four years old. she is a very spoiled little girl, who always gets upset when she doesn`t get her own way. she was an only child raised by her single mother. aunt rose had recently got married again. her husband is a man called harry, who was a single father. he has a six-year-old daughter called jade. jade had also been greatly spoiled by her father, who doted on her. after the wedding, the two girls did not get along. nicole often tattled on jade and got her into trouble. jade thought nicole was an annoying little sister. unfortunately, jade got cancer and was in the hospital for ages. she had to undergo many treatments, including chemotherapy, which made all her curly hair fall out. when she got home, people gave her most of the attention. they let her have her own way because of her illness, which made nicole jealous and bitter. nicole feels ignored and left out. she threw temper tantrums and became greatly attention-seeking. she had even tried to fight with jade on some occasion.. there were times when she was mean to her sister. nicole had teased jade, called her names and took her anger out on her. when they go out as a family, jade might not feel well and they have to hurry her home. nicole would cry and scream because she wants to stay and play. aunt rose and uncle harry would just comfort her, saying"we have to go home now because your sister is tired. we will play later." what can i do to help them?

Theres a girl at my college whos from my hometown that I knew back in the day vaguely... so when we met I teased her and she got a bit pissed but I quickly apologized and told her later via facebook that I was really interested in her and didn't know how to go about confessing it since things got awkward real quick and that I want to ask her out.      A few days later she got back to me saying she thought it would be cool for us to go out and said she likes coffee... so I got back to her later saying ok, well this week isnt good for me since i've come down with a sickness and she felt bad and said she hoped i feel better, but we agreed on a date and she gave me her number      i texted her later today with the time and day next week and she hasnt gotten back to me yet, but im optimistic      does she like me?

I have a bit of a problem and its really getting at me mentally and def emotionally. I cant think str8,etc. I REALLY like this girl and want to ask her out but i have these problems:      Im kinda shy, but willing to do anything for her (only shy around her)   every1 is knows i like her and startin to bring it up whenever they talk to me, and its slowly tearin me from the inside out, cause im not with her and really want to be.   We dont talk enough (she said that indirectly, to a bunch of ppl when i was walkin away from her and i basically kicked myself on that one when i heard her say it).      Now... about what i really want to do, ask her out. She knows how i feel (i gave her a card, and told her it was from me), she does things with her friends and play games literally with me (i take them as hints she does like me too), and i just want to ask her already but for some reason am unable....      Im lost cause she would be the first (i wouldnt be the first for her).I dont want to **** it up, want to really have a good relationship with her, but her saying we dont talk enough hit me like a brick!      I want to really know if its alright to just ask her out??????????? Is it alright if i just came to her table at lunch and started talking with her and her friends... and lead it to asking her to movie or dinner or both!      Is there something im missing or do i just ask her?! Shes amazing and i dont want to ruin anything, but why is it so hard to ask her? I want to but it just doesnt come out! Im pissed, gettin a little emotional to say the least, and am really stressin bout wut to do.      Her friends keep saying, "so have you talked to her yet?" I say no but on the other hand, idk what they mean by that? Talk about what? (asking her out, just talking, idk, imcompletely lost!)      WUT AM I SUPPOSE TO DO?! The guys are saying just ask her but i keep thinking theres something more to it... HELP ME?!!!!!!!!
20090205172125AAQL12O	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can you help me control my anger and get my wife back?	The other day my wife left me. he said something about me being to angry or something.   I thought about it and realized there were many times I've been to angry.  Here's the list:   1.  When we first got married I got really drunk at the wedding and smashed a chair on my mother in law, then I punched my father in law in the balls.   2.  During our honeymoon I wanted to watch this show but my wife said we should go to the beach.  I pretended to be happy and buried my wife in a 4 foot deep hole in the sand, leaving only the head uncovered.  I said I was going to the bathroom and that I would be back soon, but I just drove back to the hotel.  About 6 hours later my wife came back, with some really bad face sunburn.  I said I had forgotten, but my wife didn't believe me.   3. My wife suspected me of having an affair with my secretary and I had to fire her.  Now we have to meet at a motel.   4. One time I peed all over the toilet seat out of spite.   5. I often flush the toilet during my wife's showers.   6. One time I replaced all of my wife's diet drinks with laxatives.  Then I said "This better be cleaned up by the time I get back!"  and I went to the bar and told my friends.  We all had a good laugh.      So can you help me?  I just want my wife back.  I miss Paul so much.  I just want to tell him I'm sorry.

These are graphic posters displaying people having sex (one photo is of a threesome). These people are in underwear/lingerie and there is a photo of a girl holding her bare breasts. I do not deem these photos appropriate for public display (they are all over residence, inside and out, and around the dining hall, where parents bring their children) and have sent an email to the organizers about them. I would be grateful if everyone would just take a minute to tell me if you think that photos like this are appropriate (or people should be free to put up whatever they want etc.).  This issue is really pressing on me and I need to know if I am the only one that feels this way. Thank you for your time! All opinions welcome, just don't be rude, that's all I ask.

20090205171846AAmhNKC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this cause problems?	Unfortunately three years ago it started having epileptic fits in my sleep in the middle of my GCSE's (yeah wot timing!!) but in the last year I've been put on medication that's working and that's all well and good. I'm 18 now and out of school. The thing is I'm into this girl at work and the other day she saw me taking my meds and began to ask what I was doing, Normally I wouldn't care to tell people but the thing is I thought maybe if I did I stood less chance of going out with her because she'd be afraid something could happen. I said it was paracetamol and walked away. I know she likes me too but I don't want to scare her! What do people think I should do? Would it scare anyone else to date someone who has a medical condition even if it doesn't effect them on a day to day? Any help appreciated!

20090205180014AAQ9oVC	Family & Relationships;Friends	Her house flooded??? What do I tell Her (read details)?	I've been writing this magazine editor in Chief about the magazine she works for, She said that she was going to send me the issue that i wanted for free since i was a fan of who they had interviewed in the issue, she didn't reply for a month and I thought she was just being rude. So I wrote her and said:      >> Did you get my last email?  I've been waiting for your reply all month   >> long.  I left a message at your phone number on your site, but I still   >> haven't received a call or email back.      And when she replied she told me that she did not receive my last email and that her house had flooded, she had to move and that it'd been a horrible month. I would still like for her to send me the pdf version of the magazine and the print issue like she said she would, but I find it rude to just ask now if I can have it after all that happened to her. Can anyone help me out and tell me something nice to say and still request her to send it to me? Thanks

There is a guy I have known in my Tae Kwon Do class for about a year now,but we really didn't get to know eachother until I was about 5 months into my classes,he started talking to me and is watching me in class..I sometimes catch him staring while I am getting a drink or cleaning my glasses,well I just recently found out my friend talked to him (without my permission) and asked him if he liked me,here was his exact words,"I really am not sure,I can't just give you an answer right now...I honestly think she would be better off finding someone else..All I know how to do is play video games =/" and she apparently said to him,"She likes you so much though..I'd hate to see her heart shatter" and he said he came back with,"I would break her heart to fast,I am a sh**** bf and I could never be good enough for her.."      So now what?I REALLY like him...and he flirts with me and stuff,but I am afraid he might think I am to good for him,which I know I am certainly not...But how can I make him realize he is good enough?How can I get him to ask me out?
20090205173236AAd7kVw	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I'm concerned for my sister and her upcoming marriage?	My sister is getting married this spring and I'm worried that she's making a mistake. I know it's not my business who she chooses to be with, and I'm not going to try and stop her if she's determined to marry him, but I can't help but feel concern for her.       I feel she's in a rebound relationship. Her ex used to beat her and emotionally abuse her. She has a two year old son with him. She dumped him when she discovered her now fiance was single. He got dumped by a friend of mine just prior to his relationship with my sister. He was with my friend for 7 years and was absolutely crushed when she left him. He asked my sister to marry him a few short months later.       But the kicker is, he cheated on both of them. 3 years into his relationship with my friend, he cheated on her with my sister. Neither girl knew about the other. My friend discover what was going on and confronted him. He choose to dump my sister and work it out with my friend. My sister was so unbelievably hurt. Now she's going to marry this guy? Does anyone else see why I'm concerned? Part of me wants to talk to her about this, but I think she'll just get mad and tell me to mind my own business. Would you be concerned if it were your sister or am I nuts?

20090205175455AASoZ0j	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm a jerk and I'm currently not attracted to my husband's body.?	I never thought of myself as shallow but I obviously must be. My husband of 5 years is overweight (well, bmi tests say he's just over the obese mark) and I'm just not physically attracted to him. He's always busy at work so I'm sure that influences my opinion since quality time is very important to me and I distance myself when I don't have it. However, I just don't know what to do. It's starting to effect our intimacy and I would never dare tell him that I'm not attracted to him..... so I guess instead of a question, I'm wondering if anyone out there has some (polite) ways of kicking me in the butt and telling me that it doesn't matter if I'm physically attracted to him at this time since I love him and that's all that matters.
20090205180339AAZ3U84	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do you get over a 4 year relationship when you never expected it to end?	Here is a little background on my relationship.  I've been in my relationship for about 4 years now, and i was so happy, i was in love with my ex and he seemed to love me too.  then out of the blue he tells me that he doesn't want to get married to me and that we have no future together.  i was completely in shock and hurt, because just a few weeks earlier he was talking about what our kids would look like and how he loved me.  now he ignores me and tries to stay away from me as much as possible.  he says i didn't do anything wrong, but that he has been thinking of leaving me for more then 1 year now. people tell me i should be happy without him, but i was so happy with him and he seemed happy too, telling me he loves me and wanting to be with me just a little bit earlier.  we live together, and we just signed our lease again, we even work together so i see him everyday.  i just feel so lost and upset right now, that i dont know what to do.  he says he feels upset that he had to break up with me but he doesn't seem sad because he is always flirting with new girls and when i cry and tell him how hurt i feel he just says, well i dont know how else to explain it to you, but i just dont love you anymore like how you love me.  he even told me that he just stopped feeling guilty about hurting me after a while because he knew it wouldn't work out in the end, but to me i never knew it would end because he just kept telling me he wanted to be with me and he was so happy with me. i dont know...i'm just so lost right now because everyday i see him and everyday i'll ask if he wants to do something and he will say yes, but then right away change his mind and go out to the bar with his friends.  i just want to know, is there a way to move on from a relationship that you thought wouldnt end?

We were in a long distance relationship because of college and we fought a lot, I think out of misery. I was unhappy because I feel his family controls him because they don't want him to move away to me. He told me that he wants space. I don't like the idea of space. It think if you love someone, you don't need space. He says he does not want to break up. After this, he has not answered my calls, text or anything. He completely disappeared from me. Why is he doing this to me? Why does he need space but doesn't want to still have some sort of communication? We were engaged to be married...It has been over two weeks and still no form of communcation.
20090205192513AANpHhB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If your spouse's sex drive was higher then yours...?	Would you prefer your spouse constantly nag you for sex or watch porn and masturbate? I've read a lot of questions where one spouse gets mad because their husband/wife constantly harasses them for sex but when their spouse turns to porn and masturbation they get even more furious.       So basically what I'm asking is If your spouse's sex drive is higher then yours, would you be willing to give them what they want when they want it or do you expect for them to sit back, relax and wait until you're ready?      To keep the peace wouldn't it be better to just bite the bullet and please your spouse, even if you aren't in the mood!  Everyone has the right to say no so don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you have to, I'm just saying 10min of pleasure sounds better then an hour of arguing about it.
20090205195042AAheI0S	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Relationship?.................…	I know I posted this question before, but the thing is, is that I want to hear from you what you think is going on in her mind, I know that it depends on the person, but any advise would help.Thanx in advance         my ex came back acting lovely and stuff. we dated for a year and a half, she broke up w me coz she said I took her for granted...that was 6 months ago, since then I have been begging her to come back and she wouldn't, I did everything possible, I begged I cried, and instead she turned into hardcore drugs (Meth), she became a stripper, and was hooking up with so many guys (Very trashy people) at the same time. She told me that she had a misscarage two weeks ago. Now she left her apartment (Where she did all these things) and decided to go back to live w her parents, and planning to start working at mcdonalds again. Should I believe her? Basically, she ****** me up so many times, she would team up with someone she just met against me. She broke my heart, tore it, and stepped on it. And I am afraid to believe her. I'd rather live my life lonely and not to have those feelings again. Please advise.      Oh, and now she is back to the same sick jealusy games, where she leaves, dont tell me where she was going and dont reply for my texts, the thing is that am not really needy in general at all, but its the fact that I dont trust her, I dont know where she is at now. WTF, also how do I get her to stop this B.S, I mean whats wrong with ******* picking up the phone or texting back immediately??!!!

20090205200215AA0z06X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like this girl, but I dunno what to do?	We're barely friends, if that much, and I've liked her for 4 years now. I really wanna go out with her, but not only does she never notice me, but it seems like I actually attempt to avoid her involuntarily. For example, if she's near me, I'll start walking away noticeably faster until I can get where I was going, then when I sit down or stop, I get angry for a second or two, I dunno why, and then it's like nothing ever happened. I'm REALLY shy, so I can't just walk up to her and talk to her. There is no godly way she's interested in me whatsoever, so I know she wouldn't want to go out with me.

I guess he's the "class clown" and kept getting the class to laugh at him, and without realizing I groaned "oh my god.." and he turned around, probably thinking I was sarcastically laughing with him, and turned right back. I'm just upset because I really, really like this guy when we talk and I get the feeling he feels the same way.. but when we don't it gets to me (bad I know.) Also, I know he doesn't have any experience with girls whatsoever..but does this really have anything to do with it? Cause there's a girl he's seriously just friends with that they talk to all the time..which I admit does annoy me. When she isn't there he talks to me like crazy. I just need advice please, thankyou. PS: Should I let him know I like him?

20090205200312AADhcK0	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm worried for my best friend...?	So...   The other day my friend was upset because she lost a note she wrote to me and supposedly it contains very personal info. I tried to help her find it, we couldn't. So, she started to cry and said I don't feel so good and ran home. Now I haven't heard from her in 3 days! I tried calling her cell, it was off. I called her home and her mother picked up and said she's ok , I know you're her best friend, it's about you and she's not here. I'm so confused?! Why wouldn't she be home at 8:00 at night.   So today I tried calling again and received the same answer from her dad. It was 5:00. So, I had three other friends try at different times and they got the same thing. She has been very depressed lately and she has cut herself before. Where could she be? Do you think her parents just don't want any one speaking to her? Could she be in the hospital, for a possible suicide attempt, like almost bleeding to death? She has a boyfriend who she won't leave and needs to but could she be pregnant? That's the only reason I could come with because one of my friends is her cousin and they wouldn't even let her speak to her.   If not what are some other reasons as to why she hasn't been to school in three days?

20090205193302AARH1R8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do fathers always act crazy around tax time?	My sister been separated from her husband for over a year. She lives in Atlanta and he lives in Houston. They have a 4 year old son together. He called her today and they argued. He wanted to claim his son. He came and got him last August with the understanding that he could spend 1 month with him. She had to go get her son in December, because the father claimed that he doesn't have money nor time to bring him back. Now he says he should be able to claim him, and that he is in a financial bind. (like no one else is) He also wants his son in Houston for the whole year, right when the boy starts school in September. He barely helped with day care or anything. She basically has to beg him to pay anything, not spend time, because the father does spend all his time with him, when he is around. She is actually considering give him to the father for the entire year. She asked me my opinion? I told her no way in hell I would do that. She might not get him back. The father said she is keeping him from his son. What would you do?       She is in the very near future divorcing him.

I am 16 and there is this girl who ive known since freshman year (im a sophmore now) and we used to like each other towards the end of freshman year but she was already dating one of my other good friends, so that would have ended up bad if we had gotten together. Over the summer we hung out together 1/3 days and the last day of summer her boyfriend had broken up with her because he was seeing another girl. when school started are relationship started to fade away because we were both involved in activites and sports, and had none of the same classes! Randomly last Friday night she had called me at 3 AM and wanted to talk to me, i was up becuase i was chillin with some firends who had crashed over that night, So we were on the phone from 3:00 am to 7:30, and i had to get off becuase i had to get ready for helping at the local animal care center. So she texted me the next day and said "can i call you tonight?" so i replied "yeah that's fine" and we had conversations throughout the whole day by texting. that night she called around 11 and we ended up talking till about 3:00-3:30. So ever since then i had been talking to her on the phone everynight for at least 3 hours...she is a very open and honest girl and is cute funny and very smart. i'm not sure if she is over her last boyfriend though, because he still says she is trying to get back together with him...please help becuase im not sure if im getting mixed signals.

He wasn't even aware of this because the mother of the child has kept it from him.  The child is a girl and was nine years old then.  Which made my husband 15 when the child was conceived.  Now the mother of the child has the child believing that she is her sister.  The grandmother has been taking care of the girl since she was brought home from the hospital.  The way we found out was our neighbor came over for a visit.  Now my husband has known our neighbor since he was born.  To make things clearer we are now living in what used to be my husbands parents house.  Ok, now our neighbor said he was going to be bringing his grand-daughter over from out of town, he said he doesn't get to see her much since she lives out of town.  So I was excited about meeting her because I love kids and at the time my husband and I had a daughter and was expecting a son.  Anyway when our neighbor walked in the door, my jaw dropped.  And my husband walked out of the room crying because he knew right then and there that that one night that him and his neighbor's daughter spent together nine years ago ended up being more than just a fling.  His neighbor broke down and said he has known since the child was born but his daughter told him not to say anything because she wasn't quite sure who the dad was.  Well you can definitely tell now and my husband took it pretty hard that not only did he have to find out by seeing her in person but that they had kept it from him for so long.  Now the grand-mother that the girl is living with has been having health problems now for a while and we have been discussing whetther or not we should do anything.  I mean he definitely wants her to be a part of his life but he doesn't want to cause any problems or confuse the poor girl.  I mean this girl thinks that her grandmother is her mom and her mom is her sister and doesn't know her real dad.  I'm scared that when all this comes out for her she is going to need some serious help!   I want to take her in because her mom isn't much count and who knows how long her grandmother is going to be around.  I wish I could do something for her now but we can't afford legal fees, but I'll tell you this we sure would try if we knew she was in harms way.  If anyone has any advice for me please reply.  I would appreciate all of your thoughts on this. Thanks

20090205194225AAQI3kC	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Sensitive question: getting someone to tell the truth.?	i have found out that my partner is a member of an adult contacts/friends website but they don't know that i know.  they use the main PC and i use a laptop.  I found a link to this particular website in my internet history on my laptop and casually asked them about it, saying that it may have just been a pop up from a site that i was looking at.  They just said that it's a common link on certain types of sites and they may have accidentally clicked on it once before but never on my laptop, they said it was already in my history (which it may have been as they looked through it to find a website they'd looked at).  Whether to believe this or not i am not sure at the moment.       anyway, they may have told me the truth in relation to that link in my history but they didn't say that they are actually a member of that site, even if they hadn't viewed it on my laptop.        how do i go about getting them to admit to me that they belong to the website without disclosing any information i may have, or how i may have got it?      how do i get them to tell the truth?        i looked at the signing up process on the adult contacts/friends website and it really upset me, they ask if your single or a couple joining etc, what type of "fun" your looking for, and with what sex.       i'm thinking about creating a new email address under a name unrelated to me and secretly joining the website to find their profile (profiles have public views once you are a member) as i know their username, so i can see what they are claiming to be.  i really don't want to have to do this, and if it can be avoided i will, but i'm really short of options with this one.      please help.

20090205194908AA3zkaL	Family & Relationships;Family	Nanny travelling with employer?	I have been working for a well reputable movie director for a month and will work for them for 6-8months while he's shooting a movie here in New York. I work as their nanny for their 11month old son.   They have asked me to travel to Washington DC with them for 6 days (Sunday-Friday) and they have told me that I'm more that welcome to take my son with us if I'm concerned about living him behind.   Should I expect more pay during this time? I normally work 8hours a day for $650/week mon-fri. They have told me I will only work my regular 8hrs a day during this time but I figure that even though I will take my son, I'll still be away from my husband and my daily routine and I should be compensated for that.    Will I be wrong to bring this up? Is it fair of me to expect extra pay?

D:      does he like me?
20090205195138AAWVBaG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HOW DO I BREAK UP WITH HER?	Okay. So i started dating her just over a year ago. She didn't look bad 5'11" 150. Nice round a$$ C cups.       and for all you girls reading this and thinking "omg he's so shallow" F**K OFF!! YOU CAN'T SIT THERE AND TELL ME YOU DATE ANY GUY BASED ON PERSONALITY!! YOUR FULL OF $HIT!!    He's gotta be "HOT" or "cute" so just don's even answer this unless you want to be truthful.      anyway I was attracted to her and we went out on a date and you know it's the kinda girl you "keep around for a while". we had a great time. I really liked her and fell for her. We moved in after 6 months.       One of the things that attracted me to her was that she has a bachelors degree and was going somewhere in life. she had a great personality. she worked at a local shop making 10 bucks an hour, not much for having a degree, but this was her part time college job that she never moved on from.      She was laid off with the shitty economy right after we moved in together, and collected unemployment for a while. she said she was looking for a job the whole time but I didn't see her put any effort into it. still hasn't found one interview, hasn't completed her resume in which i did 90% of and does nothing but watch tv at home.      I don't work either, but I have saving we are living off. I am still attending college for my degree, this is my last semester.      She doesn't do the dishes, doesn't cook, will not take the dog for a walk, will not clean up the house, will not vacuum, or do anything I ask her.      Frankly I have had enough. on top of all this she has gained some weight. I don't mean a little, she went to the doctor the other day and is up to 192 lbs!!!! I try to get her to go to the gym with me, but she will not, her back hurts. or her leg. SHE WONT EVEN TAKE THE DOG AROUND THE BLOCK!      Anyway, since all I am doing is bitching about her, she is not the right one for me!       How do I break up with her without hurting her so bad, that she grabs my gun and kills herself?      I did love her, but her lack of motivation is the biggest turn off in the world.       How can I have kids with her? she'll gain even more weight and then never lose it!      IDEAS PEOPLE PLEASE!!!!

There is a prom at my school and a boy asked me, i have known this boy my whole life and he is asking me to his prom. I don't like him that way, and you know i am friends with him but we aren't best friends or anything but i think he has had a crush on me for a long time. The second guy is the guy i took to other proms he is totally sweet and oblivious to the universe. I like him but i'm not sure if he is going to ask me to the prom plus even if i did go with him i would need to reject my first friend whom asked me. I'm not to excited to go with guy 1 but guy 2 i would be pleased with. the 3ed guy i really like, like i really really really like him, but i am not sure if he is going to ask me or not. i mean if he did...i would be on cloud nine...but i don't want to wait around for him and then not end up going to my prom because he is an asshole. Also guy number 2 is so sweet i mean what if he asks and i say no, he is kind of awkward around girls and stuff and if i don't go he might not even go to the prom. This is a totally ridiculous story and i commemorate anyone who made it all the way through this story and has some kind of opinion.

20090205195835AAq4kyL	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I get my dad to see things from my point of view?	I've been wanting to go to this anime convention since October. I asked my dad about it, and at the time he said yes, but now he's saying no because I had an argument with him a couple weeks ago and he says I was being "disrespectful." I apologized to him after I realized that I shouldn't have talked back, but he still won't let me go. I'm not the type of kid who normally gets into trouble. I'm very well- behaved, I'm responsible, I make all A's, and I've never gotten into any serious trouble. I told my dad I'd pay for the entry fees myself, I told him who I'd be at the convention with and the type of parental supervision I'd be under, and I even asked that permission to go to the convention be one of my Christmas presents. Now, he's just adamant about not letting me go and I don't see why not. This is something I've always really, really wanted to do and now that I'm old enough, I'll be seriously heartbroken if I can't go.

The father has not established paternity, and is not part of my daughter's life. He has not provided anything for her, I have sent many emails specifically telling him what she needs, yet he has done nothing. I have had many phone conversations with what he needs to do for her as well. (I only did this because he asked me what he could do) He keeps saying he is going to do things, but he has yet to do anything whatsoever for the baby.       I am living with my parents while I go to school so they can help me with the baby. They have supported me financially during this time. Now, my family is being stationed to Hawaii. I'm afraid that the father will not allow me to move. Is there anything I can do?

20090205200306AAIeQ7Z	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I dump friend that almost got me fired?	I have a friend of 10 years that I work with that almost got me fired recently.  Twice before she got mad at me at work and ran off to the manager's office and got me in trouble.  She recently did it again and this time she spoke to our Vice President.  The funny thing is that it was always more about how I did something rather than what I did.      The VP ripped me a new one in front of the whole team and he stripped me of all my leadership responsibilities.  Now I get the same work of people I used to supervise.  I really like this friend of 10 years and I still have to be nice to her while I still work with her, but I am looking for a new job and I think once I leave this job I will terminate our friendship.  It will be hard to do, but I don't expect much from friends except loyalty.  To me a disloyal friend is an enemy in hiding.      Should I give her yet another chance and forget about it, dump her as a friend now, or just wait until I leave the company to dump her?
20090205200430AAmDf8p	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Need Help Understanding Ex-Girlfriend! Please Help! Confused!?	Hi guys I know this is pretty long but please help me out if you can find it in your heart to aid a really down college student.      I will choose a best answer and dish out points whenever possible      Alright so basically, my ex-girlfriend and I broke up like 3 months ago because she said that she needed time to "grow up". Basically, we decided to still be friends because we really still like each other and get along great. However, I am still very much in love with her.      The problem is that lately I've been feeling really down around my ex and kind of jealous and I don't know why. She's basically perfect at everything. She's very attractive because a lot of guys flirt with her, wears size 00 pants, exercises constantly, her parents are wealthier than mine as she lives in a half a million dollar house and her dad retired at the age of 48, she always gets whatever she wants (material-wise) i.e. she has two pairs of Uggs, wears all Abercrombie clothing, gets the newest iPod every year, breaks her cell phone at least 3 times a year, has two pairs of Sperry type shoes, and gets Tiffany and Co. jewelry costing around $175 once a year (She gets all this stuff usually for Christmas or just because presents but she always gets whats on her list of wants), she makes friends easily, has time to join lots of clubs in college, works as a store model for Abercrombie and has a higher GPA than me while majoring in journalism, and sometimes I feel like she has all of God's blessing even though she is extremely atheist.      However, I am the complete opposite as I always work for what I get. I'm in one of the top 10 business schools in the nation but struggle to maintain a 3.0 GPA and spend most of my time studying, I haven't met very many people in college because I'm trying to save money by living at home with my parents (my ex lives in the dorms which her parents pay for even though her parents live 2 blocks away from campus), I spend all my free time at home, I don't find myself as attractive because I've only worked for American Eagle and I am Asian, my parents want me to earn things so I have to work to pay for my clothes, cell phone, car repairs and other stuff I want unlike my ex.      I just feel crappy to the point that I've been unmotivated to study and I want to sleep all day. I've stopped going to the gym and I have been wallowing in my own self-pity, I'm always wishing that my parents were a lot richer because my ex gets to finish college at her own pace while I'm pressured to finish in 4 while her parents can also afford to let her take summer classes not only at where we go to school but to other colleges such as New York University and/or Chicago to make her workload easier while I don't have that luxury. She also got a chance to study abroad twice.      The only thing I feel like I have an advantage over her is that I know how to invest and save my money better than her because she can't save her own money at all. She doesn't even know how the basic definition of a stock or how a credit and debit card work. I am very ambitious and always look for ways to make extra money through investing and saving but I always still feel down because I know that she'll still get ahead of me in the future because her father is already investing money for her for her retirement in the thousands already.      Not only does she get all that stuff but her little sister and her brother get all the stuff they want to. Her sister basically gets everything my ex does like a new iPod at the same time my ex does and wears Abercrombie only also. However, if she doesn't get her way at all, she always throws a fit (I've been there to witness it) until she gets her way. I don't understand how she gets all this stuff either. Is it possible to get a life like this when her dad worked as an engineer for GM for 20 years and is now retired and her mom is a territorial manager for Johnson and Johnson?      Despite all this I feel like God's let me down. Why does he bless people that don't believe in him? Should I stay away from my ex even though I still love her? She is white and we've known each other for 4 years and dated each other for 2 and a half years. Can a relationship with 2 different people like this work out again? Why do I feel this way? I get really jealous because no girls flirt with me at college compared to guys hitting on her. What should I do? Am I even in her league at all?
20090205200621AA5zd40	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do? Does she like him or me? BEST ANSWER GETS MAXIMUM POINTS!?	I told this girl I liked her and I just get shy around her over the phone and she told me "just talk to me more and everything will be fine" and she asked "why'd you wait so long to tell me this?"...She then told me a week after that to go to the library to "hang out" with her during study hall at school. However, she is always walking around at school with this other guy who she turned down 3 times for a homecoming date because she told him she wanted to go alone. This year they have gotten mad at eachother a good amount but they always seem to end up being back to being friends. She has called him "psycho" to her friends. She also told her friends that she walks with him at school because if she didn't he would go crazy and it would ruin her day. I take this to mean she likes him because why would it ruin your day if he got mad? She told her friends she really wants to be friends with him. When I see her walking with him, she always seems happy and everything, and a lot of the time she will look at me as they walk by. They are not dating but it always seems like it because of how they are always together. It really makes me shy around her because I feel she and her guy "friend" are way ahead of our non-existant relationship. Should I even bother talking with her? Right now she is in one of my classes and every day she will ask some simple random questions every now and then and she says hi all the time at our lockers throughout the day. I don't know what to do?

He told them to be nice but they still act out and their mother eggs it on. I love him, but I don't know if I could deal with his bad kids. They are 9 and 11. Two girls. They are also spoiled rotten. Things are fine with just me and him but they are so mean and disrespectful to me. I don't want to marry him. But I love him so it hurts to let him go. What should do?

I'm 19 years old and I have a son that is 4 years old. He keeps me really busy all the time and I would like to give him the best. By keeping him in a good environment. But my sister seems to do my life more difficult than what it already is. She is 14 years old. She is cursing back and forth. Every word she speaks seems to start with the "f". She does not talk to me at all. But when she needs a favor done, she wants it right away. I tried ignoring her, giving her tips and advice. But she just doesn't care, she yells at my mom. And to make it even worse my dad doesn't say a word about it. At least that is what we see. He thinks by just sending her to her room or telling her to do the dishes she is gonna be good. I just don't know what else to do. can someone please give me a tip on what I should do.

One of my friends at University of Florida is like a 2nd string 2nd year football player for the school who went to same high school as me.  He told me that he was teased by some of the popular girls when he was nerdy and fat because someone had spread a rumor that he was playing with himself in the boys bathroom.  He told me that he likes it when he goes home because he rubs it in their face that he is a good college football player and that he is getting laid at his university and he wont marry them or their friends.

First off, I feel it is easier to relate when you have a mental picture, so here you go:  http://i43.tinypic.com/t9y72e.jpg.       I am seventeen years old, and my usually in supply optimism is running short.   I've always secretly wanted (what any girl wants, really)   that fairy tale, sweep you off your feet relationship!   Well, I did have a bit of a fairy tale relationship with my ex a year ago.   Boy was I happy (long live summer '07)   We have a great friendship now, but I'm starting to give up.      I've gone through a failed relationship since then.   He just wasn't right for me.   I've even tried my luck at getting my biggest crush, failed.   And another crush, stood up.      I believe these are your most fun years for dating!   I'm just tired of being taken granted.   I'm not just some "good looking" girl.   I actually have something going on inside my head, morals, tale
20090205210346AA9XI2q	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Getting married at 18...?	What do you think about getting married between the ages of 18-25.  I have seen a lot of answers where people just seem to dismiss it.  Society expects us to be an adult at 18 but, then doesn't expect us to take responsiblity to be adults...such as everyone at this age is going to drink, smoke, and have casual sex.        I think for the most part this sterotype is a scam.  So, let's not be afraid to say how we really feel...do you think marrying 18-25 is good?  Or do you think everyone should wait?  Please explain.
20090205210308AAWw5l1	Family & Relationships;Weddings	It is rude to ask the guests to pay?	Ok Im getting married this August but its really small and pretty much all immediate family. Its a civil ceremony not in city hall but in the justice of peace ''office'' but its actually a really nice formal room where all my guest can sit and watch the ceremony (30 guests). Then afterwards I reserved a private room in a very nice restaurant but I was wondering if it would be rude to ask my guests ''my family'' if they can pay for their meals, pretty much what ever they decide to order, I mentioned this to my ''mother in law'' an she said that it was rude and she wouldn't go to a wedding if she had to pay for herself. I know my family wouldn't mind. Any thoughts? Be honest. Thanks.
20090203071509AAGzboZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is my fiance so hot headed?	Im engaged to an amazing NYPD man. He is so caring and treats me wonderful plus he is so gorgeous ha. He is known to be very sarcastic and out spoken he also has a really short temper & is very hot headed apparently on the job also. Despite his apparent co*kiness he is amazing i guess cause i see the 'real' him. My 3 best friends are fond of him but my other friends don't get him at all and ask me why i am with him, i try to make them see but they refuse to. My family are the same,They are very comfortable money wise and are so stuck up im not like them at all. They tell me i could do so much better but i absolutely love him. I hate the tension that's going on. I am 25 years old(my fiance is 30) & this shouldn't bother me but it does. Once when he had a fight he ended up putting his fist through the wall. He snapped at me the other night during sex again i just walked away. We don't fight that much at all but when we do i just walk away or leave the house, sometimes when i get back he has done something really romantic for me. He grew up with an abusive father and his brother is an addict he is the only one who came good from his family. Could that be a reason for him being so angry? I love him so much, i adore him. Please help?

20090205201913AAkuf2i	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Are love/relationships needed in life?	Right now I'm a 21 year old college student. My major is International Economics/Business, and I'm not really that happy with it. Yeah, I am semi-interested in it, but it's not what I want I want to do with my life. The problem is, I don't really know what I do want to do. I just don't know that I'm not doing what I want to be doing. Honestly, I don't get enjoyment out of many activities. Part of me actually wants to drop out of college, but I only have a year left, so it's not an option. I just don't know what I want to do. I feel that even if I do get a great job...so what? I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want.   Another issue is that I've never been in a relationship, which doesn't bother me so much. I also have no desire for sex. So perhaps I'm asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships. People think that if they don't have someone they are incomplete or a loser. Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? I think there's more to life than relationships and love. What's with society's obsession over love. Because when it comes down to it, if you're not happy with yourself, and don't love yourself, you're not gong to be happy in a relationship. Relationships are not a cure to make yourself happy.   Between school and relationships, I'm just at a very confused point in my life. Society's typical path of good career, marriage, white picket fence, kids is not for me..   On top of everything, I have an extremely overbearing mother who won't stop telling me what jobs to apply for and what to do with my life.

20090205211021AAMGjum	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Having colored tablecloths with contrasting color at reception: Is it tacky?	My wedding colors are canary yellow and pool blue so I was thinking, having a blue tablecloth and a yellow table-runner. I bought everything that goes on the tables and set it up (just enough for one table) to see how it would look. I thought it was beautiful. I needed a second opinion so I decided to show my sister. When she saw them, she goes "Ewww!" She said having colored tablecloths at a wedding is very tacky and I should stick with white. I was just wondering, I know this is my wedding and I can basically do whatever I please with the decorations (considering me and my fiance are paying for everything), if it is tacky to do this. I don't want my wedding to look like a birthday party or something.       Also, I have vases on the tables with blue and yellow flowers in them, just wondering if having blue and yellow table cloths would be a bit too much.       Thanks in advance to everyone who answers! =]
20090205202605AAnGfQN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What is your husband like? What do you love about him?	I have to ask this because I am bored and also I like to brag on my husband because he's AWESOME!!! He is one of those men that women consider "one of a kind" to say the least.      We've been together for 4 years, known each other for almost 5. Anyway, we were neighbors at an apartment complex and I just had given birth to my first son-- I left his father when he was 2 months old, and my husband was my neighbor. We met and became best friends for 7 months and had strong feelings for each other and began dating when my son was 1. We moved in together shortly afterwards, and have the most amazing relationship! We got married 2 years later, and he assumed responsibility for my first son and has now adopted him....      Now we live in a nice house, our relationship is better than ever, and we're still best friends! He treats me like a queen everyday, and we just had our first baby together after 2 consecutive failed pregnancies. We had another boy 14 weeks ago! Anyway, he takes care of both kids, works full-time, and we love every minute we're together! It's great!! His sense of humor is awesome, and we spend our time together joking and laughing all the time...he goes OUT of his way to be a great father and husband! He never disrespects me.... I could not be any happier!!!      What do you love about your husband???

20090205204633AAYSPIT	Family & Relationships;Weddings	The dollar dance dilemma?	My mom is contributing half to my wedding and my fiance and I are paying the other half. Since my mom is paying half she wants her say in the wedding. I've kept her happy so far and the wedding is how we both want it but today she said "Oh we've got to do a dollar dance!" and I was like "No I' don't want to have one."(I've heard everyone is turned off by it and usually leaves when this happens) My family is hispanic so she is dead set on it and won't budge. She keeps making comments like "Whatever. It's your wedding I'm only paying for it!" She's paying half....I don't want to scare off my future in-laws because I've been to weddings on his family's side and they would never do this. It pretty much looks like I have to do this now and I'm dreading it. Any tips on what I could say to my mom or how to make the dance appear less trashy?
20090205201125AATCsnT	Family & Relationships;Family	My mom's putting me down?	I know she loves me, but sometimes, when she drinks or when she's mad, she calls me names or says I'm this or that (negative things)      No she's not a bad person, but I just don't know what to do when she says things like that.   She doesn't beat me up or anything, but when she says nasty stuff to me, (not swears), it really hurts...   At the moment, I just agree with what she says so I don't have to argue with her...      what should I do?   Should I confront her?      She's not good at understanding and listening other people's feelings and points...
20090205210737AAtqxEA	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Does she like me or not?	I've been friends with a girl since we were both freshmen in college during our first semester. So it's been about a year and a half now since we first met. Over time I've really grown to a like her a lot. Now, coincidentally we're in the same class together. Obviously we sit by each other every day and for the most part we pretty much stick to only talking about school and work.   However, today before class she was reading some article in a magazine and was then telling me what it was saying. She said "This says it is obvious when a girl shows she likes someone if she's playing with her hair. That is so not true! It means she is just fixing her hair!!" So I then ask her "Okay, so what do you do whenever you like someone?". She hesitated for a few moments and replied "Ummmm I guess I'd tell you....... I don't know."   What do you take from this? Does she like me or not?   I thought it was interesting that in her answer she said "you" instead of "him". Maybe I'm just over-analysing it.   PS I've never noticed her playing with her hair.

20090205211324AANSPYD	Family & Relationships;Family	How do you deal with your mother in-law?	I feel as though my MIL doesn't like me, she's nice to me but it feels so fake a lot of the time. She has made it clear to me on several occasions that her daughter is top dog in the house, she makes sure I know that her daughter gets everything passed down to her and I get nothing, not that I want any of her old stuff anyway. When I go there the first thing she say's to me is 'so and so are grandparents now' and then she'll go off and have a sniffle or a cry about it because she wants to be a grandma but isn't yet. I recently found out that she told my hubby that her youngest son tried to kill himself twice because of me!! Apparently it happened a few years ago before I was married. I don't know if it is true or what I did so bad that he would do this but either way she brings it up now! Then the other day it was my bday and she came over to give me a card and gave me $250 for my bday, I told her I didn't expect to get anything and said thanks and asked if they would like to stay for a cuppa she said they were too busy, its a half hour drive to my house so they made that much effort but not enough to sit and have a drink.   She has already been accousing me of treating her like a second rate grandmother (not to may face she tells my hubby) and we dont even have kids yet, it hasnt even happened, im not even pregnant or anything. But she recons that when I do have kids I wont let her see the baby or visit or help out or anything! When we have had conversations about baby names and stuff she always say gross you can't name your children that when I say a name (even if its a really pretty name) but she'll say thats nice if my hubby says a name even if its a rediculus name and my hubby is just making it up to get a reaction.   I feel so upset about it all at the moment.   Does anyone else have to deal with stuff like this from their in-laws?   How do you deal with it or what would you do in my situation?

We've been sure about it for months now, he just had to actually get the ring on my finger and we had to tell our families.      We've always wanted a small wedding. Nothing extravagant...it's just not our style to go over the top.      I have a question about the budget and who's paying for it.      Would it be better and easier to make a list  and the prices of everything we'll need then present it and find out how much the families are willing to chip in?      --or--      Should I see how much everyone is willing to chip in and then plan accordingly?      I'm opting for the first choice, but I really don't know.   That's why I'm asking you guys.      I'm trying to make this as stress free on me and our families as possible.

Ok it happened like this tuesday during english class and it was during my period. It seemed like a normal day in class when suddenly when I got to get a kleenex i noticed there was blood on the chair i was sitting on! No one noticed it but me so i didnt know what to do but sit back down and tried to wipe it while sitting down with a kleenex or my pants but it made things worse. When it was time to go, i left the class last and i looked at it and it was even bloodier than before! and i mean bloody. I was like oh crap, and i walked really fast out of the class, leaving my teacher and the bloody chair behind and i didnt really tell her. After that class it was homeroom and she has homeroom with 10 people (maybe) in it and i was in a different homeroom. During homeroom i went to the bathroom and noticed that my pad didnt really catch 'most' of the blood and went through my back of the pants. Now i'm realy embarrassed because she must have been really shocked if someone told her there was a bloody seat in her room and probably knows it was me since i sit on that chair all year. it has been two days since it happened and i wont have her class until next week, but i dont know what to do if i meet her in the hallways or something. Should i apologize or something!? this is the first time this happened and hope it's the last.       Has this ever happened to you? And what should i do? Pls, i'm really embarrassed.
20090203072714AABrYXE	Family & Relationships;Family	What should I do? My mum hates me?	My mum hates me because I did not get into a certain prestigious university and I keep telling her that it's really hard. She believes I did not study to my best for AS levels but I still got 3As.  I don't know what to do, she won't talk to me without being really nasty and saying "you should have listened to me". I don't even care that I did not get in, after the initial shock. But this is really destroying my life. I keep telling her to stop but she won't. HELP!
20090205204315AAIlb9Y	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husbands letter to me...?	Here is a letter my DH wrote to me about his family. I am lucky to have him.  Its not every DH that would side with his wife & for all of you ladies out there whos DH's tell them to "suck it up" now you can see what a good DH would do in this situation. Unfortunately it took him years to put his foot down w them, but better late then never.      Hey Babe,         I'm not sure anyone in my family knows how or when to give a correct apology, not that that's an excuse it's just sadly enough the truth. I will say that all the events that followed our blow up with my family since last Easter are completely unprecedented, however whether or not it translates into anything good remains to be seen. I know they are not your blood relatives and understand your hurt and anger towards them. I carry a lot of resentment towards them myself which is why even now after that whole family meeting I still am not sure if I can trust them. The truth is Lilly that my family is never going to be the same. Over the last two years I watched it torn apart by the two people that were supposed to be responsible for keeping it whole. I don't think I can ever go back to feeling about them the way I once did and that breaks my heart. The truth is that even if things did eventually thaw between my mother and you and xxxx(my sister) I don't think I'm capable of things going back to weekly visits and hanging out on Sundays. The truth is I don't think I could take more than some holidays and maybe once or twice a month dinner/coffee visits because I just feel like the less I see of them the less they have to talk about. This whole thing eats me, not because I miss my Mom and Dad but because I see them differently now (I'm not gonna lie I do miss them taking the kids for sleepovers and going out with you alone -with no kids) I see them as old all of a sudden and wonder sometimes how long I've got left with them and that makes me question what I can only call the love/hatred I feel for them right now. Where my parents have proved themselves to be pretty lousy parents/in-laws your right when you say they do love their grandchildren very much which may be their only saving grace.   You know it's hard to go over there for me with out you because even though your okay with it, and they may be fine with it, I'm not. Which is why I'm not taking the kids there as much as I should. The holidays were tough for me this year as much as I enjoyed just us, I was a little heartstrung too. Families aren't supposed to act like this, mine does -and it's embarrassing because I can't help but wonder how they felt during the holidays... did they think of me and my family and hurt at the absence at their table the way I did?? I wish I could say yes absolutely, but I can't. I can't and won't tell you what to do with your feelings because I'm not sure what mine are. I know that deep down I would like for us to reconnect with my family and try to do this the right way but I'm not sure how. I have to tell you I carry a lot of guilt because I let things go with my family for far too long and can't help but blame myself for not putting my foot down years ago. I mean my family is still fu*ked up about a lot of other things, but when it came to my wife and our house I should have never let them get away with the things they did. I can only tell you this, if we were to eventually exist with them again it won't happen again. The truth is like I said before -my family will never be the same..                                                                                                    All my love                                                                                                         XXXXX

20090205205113AANN4yf	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How long is too long for a Bride's speech at her wedding?	I've been trying very hard to come up with an eloquent Thank You Speech for my wedding this spring but when typed out, it's three pages long, not double-spaced.  I could shorten it but I don't want anyone important (my brothers, parents, new in-laws, bridal party) to feel left out.  It's especially important to me that I give a sincere thank you to my parents since they are the ones' footing the bill and they raised me to be the person I am.  I don't know how I can make my speech more succinct without cutting out important details or things that add emotion/humor/tears.  Anybody have any suggestions so that I don't come across as boring?  I know that brides aren't required to make a speech but I feel obligated, so what is the longest it should be?  5 minutes?  Or can I get away with more?

20090205203129AATNpSu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it possible to forgive a spouse who pursued another, but got caught before cheating? Read my details.?	My husband and I clearly have relationship problems.  We are young and struggling, but both have dedication to the commitment we made.  Im struggling with my dedication at the moment because he has done a few actions that have installed doubt.  For a little background, he was taking a winter session class and had some one on one time with a girl(freshman) in his class. I am not the jealous type and acknowledge that he did not create this situation.  They met four times, and the night of the last meet I found him obsessively texting.  I asked who he was texting and he told me specifically one of his friends. Lie #1  Due to the intervals of time between the texts, I asked to see his phone.  He was asking the freshman girl information about herself and invited her to go to the hot springs and downtown with him. Needless to say, I feel as if he has already let in his mind that cheating is an option and he has already taken action.  I know this is not the full extent of cheating, but where is the fine line?  Also, I asked him if it was more than just friends, meaning he likes her, he lied and said no. Lie #2  I then asked him at a later point if he thought about having sex with her and he said no. Lie #3  I can read people incredibly easy, so he confessed to all his lies. My rules on cheating, if it is done, we are done.  If this is not the full extent of cheating does my rule not apply, can this be forgiven?
20090205201957AAVPJ0T	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need a help with this friend of mine which I kinda used to hate till I added her in Yahoo Messenger?	So I used to hate this girl, till another friend of mine told me to add her(no matter how I said why) At first I dont know it was her, tillI noticed that the username was the same with the notebook she told me to write on, with the same username. So it was a good start she told me that I was an 'good friend' of her so I know she wants to start off a new start. Till I kinda said something about what she hate. Then I heard from a friend of mine that she's fighting me, by telling her(I don't know what she meant) I MEAN I was VOICING MY OPINION!!!! I don't know what the heck is wrong with her, last time I asked her about something and she blocked my profile in friendster. I mention to friends what I hate and don't like, but if she likes it, she secretly attacks me by telling my other friends. I don't know what to do, delete her or just tell her something?

Should I marry him regardless of how my parents and the rest of my family feel?Everyone says I should wait, but I miss him so much and being away from him so long. If he and i got married we could live together. Should I tell my parents how I feel or just do what I want. Did I mention that I'm 18 and still ask for permission to go hang out with him?

20090203070157AAqJ4Os	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How can I kick an ex-boyfriends butt? am I self centered?	Me and my boyfriend just broke up recently because according to him, he cannot take my being a "career woman" anymore. He said I am more devoted to my friends, studies, organizations and work than to him. I am a 3rd year college student and modesty aside, I am a deans Lister and I have to maintain it until I graduate so I really do my best to study well. In addition, I am the current president of the theater arts club of our university so I have to stay with my members and practice school and we usually finish so late because of some preparations and meetings. Another thing is that I work. I am teaching during Saturdays to out-of-school youth, out-of-school adults and out-of-school children and then on sunday, of course I go to mass and then go to bible studies and other mission works. Plus I am managing one of our family business. my boyfriend knows all these before I said yes to him. I explained everything to him and he said he understand and he would help me. but then he keeps on demanding for a date even though it is already late and I am tired. He's being jealous with my work and told me to let my sister handle it but I can't because she is already handling one of my family business. not just that, he is jealous of my friend and organization. He wanted me to quit being the president and he wanted me to stop hanging out with my friends when in fact he knows that my friends are helping me in my works and obligations. and then one day he told me just stop being in the deans lister because according to him it sucks. He told me that I cannot use a DL title in finding work. He is even jealous with my cousin who is a guy who is always with me. He always want to call me even in the middle of class, meetings or important occasions. and when i did not take his call, he will eventually get mad at me and say bad things against me. he even humiliated me in public and embarrassed me at school. At first I thought I love him so I just did my best to understand him. So even if I am really tired I have no choice but to go out with him even if it is so late at night. But then last week, he punched my gay friend and told him to stop dating with me. He even shouted that I am not a virgin because according to him something happened to us when actually none. I am 100% virgin I swear. I am so pissed off so I broke up with him and he told me that I am being selfish and self centered. He is spreading that I am a worthless and useless woman who just uses a guy who is inlove with me to gain popularity and that I am a gold digger when in fact I did not even ask anything for him...I did not ask even a piece of candy...gosh...I am really annoyed with this guy and I don't know already what to do...
20090205202318AAff23e	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do i do when i've liked a guy for a year and he says he likes me but he always goes for another girl?	ok so here's my story.    last year i was a freshmen and i had my first actual boyfriend. the relationship started out great but than once we got into our 3rd month of dating things weren't going right we had no physical connection because he was to shy to do anything but we had a good emotional connection but i wanted more than just that, so i broke up with him in the nicest way possible. he understood completely, but the thing is it wasn't only that i wanted more i also started to become friends with my friend mandie's ex boyfriend, rick, right from the start we had this special connection and we both new it.    rick was a sophomore,one year older than me, tall, blonde, blue eyes, great personality, and everything a girl could look for in a guy. we started talking and flirting and eventually we went out on a date and started hanging out like every weekend. we kiss many times and it was the best.     it finally was summer time and we drifted apart. we didn't hang out once or even talk but i never lost feelings for him.     than my sophomore year and his junior year came and we saw each other and all of the feelings we're strong than ever. we talked a lot, saw each other everyday at school, and we have hung out once. and the night after we hung out he was asking me if i liked anyone and i said ya but i don't want to tell you [because it was him, i was shy] but he got me to tell him that i liked him and he acted surprised  when i told him and i remember asking him why he was shocked and he said because the night we hung out all of his feelings came back and he started to miss the old days and i told him that i never lost feelings for him but now that i've seem him more they have been stronger. he said that he liked me!    than a couple weeks later i guess he moved on because he kept talking about this girl andrea and that he liked her and they always hung out. later he found out that she liked him and i just became a girl who was really good friends with him. he told me he liked her and was thinking about asking her out tomorrow and i was really hurt because i liked him and i thought he liked me but i guess i was wrong.      he asked me if i had any new guys and i said no just the same guy and he said still! and i was like ya but that's all going to change tomorrow and he was like why is that? and i said  "cuz i like her and think that i might ask her out tomorrow=]" does that help? and he was like OOOOO IM SORRY=[[[[[[[[ and than i was like its alright you do what you want to do and he was like but that's the thing i don't want to do something that i going to hurt someone=/ and i was like its alright i get it and he was like alright=/.......seriously like i know i just said it was alright but its not alright because the guy i like likes another girl.    he says he cares about me and will never hurt me but by him asking this andrea girl out is the worst thing that will hurt me. i don't want our friendship to end but i also don't want  him to ask her out.    why can't he just ask me out already? i mean i've known him for almost a year and a half now we know basically everything about each other and we have a connection. why does he keep going for other girls and not me? is there something wrong with me?     i need help...how do i get him back?

20090205202538AAcKlC8	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My Girlfriend's Going Crazy?	Thank you for taking your time to read this rather lengthy dilemma but I really need the help. To start off im 18 and she's 17, she thinks she is Bipolar and takes 3 different medications to cope with her anxiety and depression. And we love (or loved) each other very much after realizing we were meant to be after my last relationshit. So my girlfriend for a little over a year called me yesterday on the phone crying and telling me that she is so stressed out about the new semester at school and that she doesn't want to be in relationship right now, and wants to be alone for a while. And today she talked to me on MSN Messenger and talked to me about dyeing her hair red and cutting it "boy" short, and my reaction, was surprised, confused, and concerned, because she would never do that, and I asked her i she was feeling ok and she gets mad at me for not "supporting" the idea or whatever, and I told her I was just concerned about her, and she tells me "that's not being concerned, thats just being a jackass." She also told me I "changed in everyway" and I "hurt her too much." I do not believe I have changed at all, bt I know I hurt her once involving a drinking party, and she got upset because she hates when I drink, so after that I told her I would not drink anymore just for her and that I wouldn't have any more parties, so she would forgive me, and it seems like she did. But now suddenly she says I'm so mean andstuff, and I'm wondering if it is because she ran out of her meds? Because she has in the past and has been bery hurtful towards me and I don't want that to end our relationship? Please help me, I don't know what to do. =(

I wouldnt really have romantic feelings for this guy, he's way too old and im about to be engaged to my boyfriend.   how can i express to him that id like to be his friend, but not anything more.

I bought a puppy and I got the mum dog offered to me for free from the breeder (she's now retired and no longer useful to the breeder) but this mum dog has ingrained bad behaviours, jumping on me, separation anxiety really bad, she smells and won't let me bath her without a fight and isn't interested in her puppy at all - which was supposed to be the idea - they'd be companions, mum and daughter dogs together. The mum is too anxious about my whereabouts to bother with her puppy. And the puppy I spent my hard-earned money on is missing out on my individual attention now I have the demanding mother!      I wanted to take her back to the breeder 2 weeks ago; But my mother in law said she'd have her, only she has been fobbing me off with reasons why she's not ready yet for the past 2 weeks and I am sick of this hanging on situation.      Should I just return the mum and tell my mother in law I couldn't wait any longer?   She is very sensitive and might fall out with me about it now she thinks she's getting this dog.   But should I keep waiting?   Yesterday I asked her 'when are you having her' and she fobbed me off again saying 'after the house is ready' - they're doing decorating now!   And have given me no time-scale at all!      Should I hang on or disappoint my mother in law?   If it was anyone else I'd have said 'sod them' by now and taken the dog back to the breeder. Should I give my hubby's mum special treatment?
20090203065549AADUqXW	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do I do about my roommate?	I told my roommate on the 22nd of January that she had to move out by the 5th of February. She and I signed a seperate contract from the lease agreeing that if she were to be evicted, she had two weeks to move out.      It's almost the 5th, and she still hasn't even been home to get any of her stuff. Her name isn't in the lease aggreement and she doesn't have a copy of the thing she signed between she and I because she didn't want a copy.      What do I do? Should I just throw all of her stuff out on the porch on the 5th like I promised I'd do, or should I just let it go and let her do it on her own time?      If I don't do what I said I was going to do, I appear as a pushover. If I do do it, I'll appear as a *itch.      What do I do?      **Sidenote: I kicked her out for a good reason. I didn't just kick her out to be an @$$.
20090203065627AAkytZm	Family & Relationships;Friends	IM 14 And i hate my life.?	(i'm female btw)   i've always longed to be a happy person, well i am, on the outside, i dont really show when i'm sad to anyone, i keep a fake smile or just act like nothings wrong. My life is boring and dull, ive always admired other people, and wanted to be like other people.      i worry constantly over EVERYTHING, like whats my life going to be like when i'm older i'm far too concerned of what people think of me..      i want a best friend, i don't think i have any real friends, any actuall close ones,      i try making new friends but, they dont want to know because they already have their own close group of friends, ive always wanted to be like the girls who go out all the time and always have fun with eachother and go to all the parties and are always there for eachother.      No boy has ever even looked at me, as far as their concerned i look young for my age, & with everyone else loosing there virginity it makes things worse, i feel really left out.      i want to be able to go out with my friends all the time like everyone else,, but my parents arnt like theres, they dont let me stay out late,,      my friends will be going out nearly every night and going to every party and doing all-nighters, but i cant.      i'm also flat chested and skinny (32B) which is another problem.      Again im constantly worrying about EVERYTHING, and i hate the fact i'm growing up too fast, times flying and i hav no idea what i want to be when i'm older.      My mom said there wil b plenty of time for going out and partying when i'm older..but i disagree as i'll be too busy tryina find a job or sumthing.       EVERYONE looks older than me and it's not fair. i don't even have any male friends.      i worry like theres no tomorrow, i think about things alot,, i just need to find a way to enjoy my life and be happy like everyone else x

20090203070251AAmih4m	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Need help with my BF situation, about marriage. calling all men?	Me and my BF have been going out for about 3 1/2 years. we have a 2 year old daughter, and we have been living together for 3 years. we fight. a lot. we have almost broken up numerous times. he has a bad temper, and i have a nasty attitude. after we have argued about it for a while. so i changed. i still give attitude when i feel like i have reason to. but i know i am a lot better then i used to be.       so heres my deal. when we first started dating he used to joke with me about getting married. then i got pregnant. i told everyone, that i didnt need papers to know that i wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. well that was about 3 years ago. now i want to get married. we are at a different stage in life now. but all of a sudden hes telling me he DOESNT want to get married. so of course being a girl, i think its about me, so he tries to comfort me about it saying he doesn't want to get married to ANYONE. well that doesn't help me at all.    im learning that we apparently are on 2 different pages. he wants more kids, he wants a house with me, but not marriage? he said hes afraid of the commitment. but our relationship wouldn't change at all if we got married. then he tries the excuse he doesn't want the ceremony and all that ****. well im scared too, but i still want to be married. so i finally got out of him that some of it IS our relationship.    i really dont know what to do about it. hes sending me mix signals, cause he will look at wedding dresses with me, and tell me what ones he likes, and wants me to get. so im going to try to make our relationship better, but its hard cause when i try to talk to him he just tells me to shut up (nice right?) so when he doesnt want to hear something he will piss me off so bad that he knows ill just go in the other room, or go to bed.       can someone please give me a different perspective on this?

20090203070816AA39oZA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this suspicious? My husband would go out 5 minutes after he comes home from work. Usually for 2 or 3 hours.?	I'm always be the one who put our 4 children to bed. He would talk on his cell phone in the chill in winter evening, out there at the corner of the street, he could have come back and talked in the house. Somebody saw him linger on at the entrance of the nearby underground station, talking on his mobile. It's only one minute distance from home and the station since he was with his bike. Why didn't he talk in the house but out there in the chill? Is he hiding something from me?

20090203071355AAgLnyO	Family & Relationships;Family	What should I do? my little sister is horrid?	My little sister is 8 years younger than me(age 10) and is sooo mean.She used to be so cute and has changed alot now. I'm a very nice person, sensitive and hate fights and arguments, so when she comes to my room when Im busy doing my work or relaxing Im ok with it ,and dont ever tell her to leave, but then she makes a snarl comment about me that hurts me at times. When I ask her in a polite way if she could leave my room and tell her you are being a bit rude, she says Im mean and the worst sister and annoys me until boiling point when I explode. Im not this sort of person, Im nice to everyone, but she brings out the dark side of me and at some points I have pushed her away, but she starts hitting me. I try to tell her Im not being mean to you, 'I just want to give you a small talk on how you are acting', but she ignores me every time and closes her ears singing'lalalalalalalalalalal, stupid girl stupid girl!!! nonstop until I have to chuck her out and she starts crying because I hurt her arm by accident. I know Im much older than her, but she is really making me depressed, its got so bad that she treats me like this every single day, I really want to move out, but where would I go? I havent got any money!!!    Also my parents are always on her side and there is no discipline to her behaviour, but when I was her age I was shouted at and even at times my dad would hit me on my backside to teach me a lesson, and to tell you the truth it kind of worked as I am very well-mannered, don't swear,treat evryone equally and I am a good person as most poeple think so. MY sister on the other hand is a little brat, no manners , she does anything she wants and gets away with it and I get the blame.Help!! she won't listen to me!      Its not that I hate her,I actually love her but she is just a really big pain and its effecting my mood every day. Also to mention, I think you cant ask for a better sister, I take her everywhere, buy her stuff when she wants something, help her out and at the end of the day I'm like a stranger to her.

20090203071649AAnUC4a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do guys feel about girls asking them to dinner or a movie? Is this a good way to do it?	I'm 20 and the guy I have a "crush" on is 20 as well. We work together.  I recently got out of a relationship, oh about 2 weeks ago, and he knows I was upset and he told me to cheer up.  I really think he is a nice and cute guy but I'm scared to ask him to hang out.      He has a really high position at the company we work for and I know he gets a really big salary as well. I don't want him to think that is why I want to hang out with him.       He also is always busy at work and running around, it's hard to catch him in one place for more then 2 minutes.      How do I pursue asking him to hang out? What should I say?      I was thinking of saying,   "What do you usually do on your weekends?" and then I'd be like, "well I really wanna go to (restaurant name) on Friday, if you don't have anything to do, you should come with me"      Do you guys think that is a good way to do it?      thanks!

I have been with my girl for over 3 and a half years we have been engaged over a year and live together , I am 44 and she is 42 . I love her so much but the problem is her kids  she has 4 and they totally dictate to her what to do . Really 3 out of 4 do, the dad is a deadbeat who does nothing for them including provide anything , I help do that. He seems to go out of his way to cause problems for us by what he says to the kids. (can't prove it but know that he does not want us to work out due to jealousy ) each of the kids have seemed to resent me being there at one time or another my girl thinks it is because they feel sorry and protective for the dad . I never say anything to them about him and neither does she.i never try to replace him but we have all done things together including vacations and he has not I was told by my fiance to not reprimand them when they so wrong so I dont . they range from 12 to 15 years old . I am getting tired of feeling unwanted in my own home and sometimes feel like giving up on this any advise would be appreciated !

20090203072226AAoeA6z	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I fear that he wants to take this futher? But then I feel like he doesn't care?	SORRY IT'S KIND OF LONG. But please. I need your help.   I've been dating My Boyfriend, for going on 11 months now. We're both 17, except go to different schools. On Saturday night it was his Sister's birthday party, at the party there was lots of booze and drunk people.   One guy came up to me who was drunk out of His mind, pinched me on the bum. My boyfriend noticed, but didn't really do anything about it.   Then later on in the night He told me that He loved me for about the 5th time.      We then went home to My House, as he was dropping me off by the taxi. He walked me to the front door then pushed me up against the door and started kissing me. He then, goes call me tomorrow walked away making these meow, woof woof, hubba hubba noises. Which I can only image are from The Simpsons.      The next day I called him, and He went ballistic at Me because, he remembered and thought there was something going on between Me and that boy who pinched My bum.   I told Him it was nothing and that He was just too drunk that He did that.   We then made up, and He then again started kissing me. Things moved to the bedroom and He didn't wait for Me to undress, He just ripped at My clothes like He was a hungry lion.   He then opened my legs and started to "do me". (Sorry to go into detail, not gonna go into anymore detail).   After having sex, I realised that He hadn't been wearing a condom. So its obvious I'm pregnant. But this is not what the question is about.      Why does He do this to me? I don't think He cares about me at ALL.
20090203072304AAKJC9u	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can a man love you and still cheat?	I have a 3month old child with my boyfriend and we are in a long distance relationship.I've noticed on many occasions that he has relations with younger woman on myspace although none of them were real but this time I believe it is someone he is cheating with. He always tells me he loves me so much and wishes he could be with me but unfortunately right now we can't live together because he is US and I am Canadian. How can he really love me when he is having relations with other woman?  Sometimes I think that he is insecure and because we are so far apart he needs to get attention else where. Anyhow when I found out about this new girl I told him where to go VIA text and have not spoken to him since.  Do you think he can love me but because we have a child together he thinks he can get away with more,  thinking I will always be around?

20090205205140AABXGuZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can anyone in india predict What is going to happen on Valentines day? Are lovers gonna be beaten up? How to.?	Dear Friends in Community. Mutalik has issued an ultimatum that His goons are going to beat up unmarried couples celebrating valentines day. I know the state Machinery can do very little about it and we will witness the beatings of girls as well as the boys by the hooligans on TV probably live coverage too, Also most of the shops stocking valentine cards namely Archies etc will also be targeted.   But this evil cannot be fought with goodness as far as I see it this evil must be fought with a different kind of evil. I call upon all to join hands and we shall form what is a revolution " VALENTINE SENA" to counter the "SRI RAM SENE".    Will you be a member of this "Valentine Sena"?   Lets go out and beat up those who are out to take our "Right of expression". What you say?

20090205205851AAXQsoE	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How to get out of an abusive relationship?	I'm currently entangled in a restrictive and emotionally abusive relationship. I can't explicitly detail what landed me in this predicament initially, but I can assert that my partner did not purvey aggression or controlling abusiveness at the on-start of our relationship. I'm perplexed as to what happened, but it can't be helped now. At this point, I just need an exit strategy. Seeing my daughter gaze from me to her dad, confused, and burst into inconsolable tears during a heated argument was all that I could take.      Of current, I'm a 22-year-old student and stay-at-home mother to our year old child. I'm working on securing employment. The shelter facilities in my town are wait-listing new entrants and the housing market in my regional area is an expensive mess. I have no family to speak of, and no one who would be willing to take my daughter and I in.       I'm sure this sounds like an extremely obvious and mundane question, but what are the first steps I should take to unfetter myself from this situation. Everything is in such a confusing place right now, my thoughts aren't lucid enough for me to effectively strategize a way out and I'm too emotionally confused to be decisive about much of anything.       I would greatly appreciate your assistance in helping me figure out what I should do, step-by-step, about finding a way out. If anyone can lend advice from an experienced perspective...even better.      Thank you all so much.

20090205210252AAzOoVD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	French kiss "problem"?	So my boyfriend and I made out for the first time about...ehh...3 days ago. I thought it was great because he's an AMAZING kisser, but a few minutes later when we were talking he told me "you bit the hell outta my upper lip"    At first I thought he was joking...until I saw the bite marks...   Apparently they hurt and he admitted that it hurt.....   But we've made out more over the past few days and I'm pretty sure that I've done everything right...but I have NO idea why I keep biting him   He hasn't complained at all the last two times so does that mean he's getting used to it??

20090205211133AAc5nfB	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it okay for me to be her friend, or should I break it off?	My friend, who I've know since 2006, has been being a little mean. A "little" is kind of an understatement. Well, earlier this week, she told me that my opinion didn't matter, and I can't tell if she was trying to be funny or she was nervous. But it was either of those two, and I have been re-examining our friendship. At first, she was really nice and told me a lot of compliments, like I was smart and etc, but after 4 months, she started being more abusive. She called some of my clothes and actions words whack and things related to it. And after two months, I was used to it. When I got back into class, she was worse, and got a worse attitude. She got more conceited, and started to lie to me and everyone else. Her story is different with everyone, and we're not sure which is true or false. And she is starting to make almost everyone close to her crazy. She says her life's the worst, and I guess that gives her some leeway to act like it, but she's getting out of control (in my mind.) Do you know other ways to deal with it? I don't like losing friends, even pretty bad ones.

I am a little bit of a shy person so I was rather quiet.      Then I was at my last period for the day. Two girls were sitting behind me. They were giggling behind me and I figured they were just laughing at their own jokes. They were actually laughing because my whitey tightes were showing the entire time.      I found out because right before class ended, one of the girls grabbed the waistband of my underwear, pulled it out, and then snapped it back, making a loud noise. It caught a lot of people's attention, embarrassing me!      What do I do?!

I also dreamed my old neighbor/ best friend who I grew up w was there also.   I was sorta yelling at her. It was about a recent issue, but then the guy is from senior year in HS or in 9th grade.    9th grade, is the year that my best friend and neighbor who I had known since I was 5, started to drift.    A year after her dad killed my dog(well we put him to sleep)   The guy is the love of my life's(or so I thought) best friend. I've been torn between them for a while.    Last night I had decided to give on being w the love of my life.    It's always this time, and I always say that.    But I am sick of it. I'm ruining possibly, course I think I already did that.    I don't see it happening I really don't. It's too late. I'm sick of waiting.    And it's a long story but I don't think it would work.    I feel guilty, and it wouldn't be happy.   It wouldn't be nearly as romantic. It's time I forgot. That's what I think sometimes.

20060713071047AACEvuz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My ex has a brain injury which has lead to her having memory loss. But not extremely bad memory loss. Her ex?	boyfriend showed up to her house one time when i wasn't around. They ended up getting intimate. I found out from her lil nephew, cause he saw her do it. He told me about it. I comforted her, but she denied it. She finally came clean about it. I asked her why she lied to me, she replyed, she didn't know how we were on terms in the relationship. What made me even madder was when she said, what you don't know won't hurt u. I didn't buy what she told me. For one thing, we were together nearly 2 years, and she was always able to remember the nasty things she enjoyed that her ex's did for her. She use to always tell me what they would do for her. My question is should i had looked pass it because of the brain injury, or does it sounds like she used the injury as an excuse, to get pass the fact that she was wrong.

20090205214323AAqifAk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How the heck to I get her to like me?  She's too shy!?	All of the sudden I've been going crazy over this one girl who's been in the same class as me for years. She's kinda shy and doesn't talk to too many people. Actually, she's extremely shy. In speech class whenever she gives speeches she can stop laughing/blushing. (She laughs a lot though)      One bad part about this is she sometimes hangs around this girl who I pretended to like (trying not to hurt her feelings) until just a few weeks ago I flat out told her she was annoying and I didn't like her at all. So.. who knows what she thinks of me.         So.. I don't know how to get her just as a friend. I can't read her. I talk to her a few times a day, but she never comes up to or talks to me. Gosh, this is driving me crazy! What should I do?!?         Also, when I was trying to flirt, it seems like another girl was led on my that instead of her. Now I have another problem.      Any suggestions?            Oh, and the girl I like is extremly tall. Maybe 6" taller than me.      What do you think about that?

I try really hard to believe my "big brother-in-law" is a good man, but it is hard because last thursday he told his gf that his friend Josh liked me alot. His gf knew that Josh looked good and told my brother that I liked Josh too, so then his gf told my brother to tell Josh to meet me at the pool. Josh never came. My brother told me it was because Josh was busy but he really wanted to come to see me.    Secondly, my brother told me that he gave Josh my cell phone number and that Josh was going to call me. Josh never called, but I also found out that my brother told Josh not to call me until a few days went by so that he would not look desperate. I also added Josh as a friend on xanga, Josh added me, but when I tried to message him, he said things like, " I don't even know a Larry" Now, please tell me what you think of this situation that way I could show your responses to my brother and his gf.                     Thank you

20090205211645AA4GgdO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Did I let the "one" get away?	A number of years ago I broke up with the only girl I can truly I've ever loved. I did this because I didn't feel she had to give up her life for a choice I made that would require me to leave the country plus I wanted her to go back to school. Her ex husband made her drop out of med school and follow him around. So, I broke up with her and told her to go back to school, which she did. We lost touch after awhile because from what I was told she was really hurt about the entire thing and I didn't get a chance to say how sorry and how much it hurt me too.   Ever since then, it is like I'm being punished. Every girl I've dated since then has cheated on me, no exaggeration. The thing is, I'm picky when it comes to only dating girls that I feel are real nice and feel I can trust.   Am I being punished for what I did?

Then he hit me with it. " I was never good enough for you was I.. Did i ever make you happy " " i said off course u did. He said I feel so ashamed & I can't even look at your properly cause its hurts... U were so good to me, & I should have been there for u too,he was crying again, I gave him a hug, & he hugged me back .      I asked him if he loved this new girl ( the one he is seeing ) and he said I dont know.. "i did not react"   He said to me, but I don't know if i really made you happy, then he added "I want to remember the good things I don't want to remember the bad bits, but when I think of the good times between us, i get really sad, - he then said yes cause how could we have had something so beautiful and then not ... he was crying his eyes out & put his arms around me and i hugged him back. I said to him, if ur truly honest with yourself and u have an open heart, then that is all u can ask for.    he left and kissed me on the lips then  threw me a kiss as he walked off..

And she is single because I never see her around guys. She's always around her girl friends. I think she's attractive. But I having a problem on how to ask her out

20090205212839AAkwsL1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My wife lied to me when we started dating?	My wife lied to me when we started dating about a friend she had, what she failed to tell me was that friend was her ex boyfriend.  She didn’t realize that I knew he was her ex and for months I watch her omit information spin information and even lie about this guy.  We argue for weeks but never came to an agreement about what to do about her ex.  She knew I didn’t want her talking to him but one year after we got married I saw her phone bill and realize she was talking to him  weekly sometime several times a day. I don’t believe she cheated on me that I am sure of that but I have a problem with her lies.  She continue to lie about many small things in out daily life She will either omit key information or spin information in such a way as to make it appear that she is not lying.  And what frightens me is that she check my phone records often when I’m at work and when I’m in school I know this because my computer records all activity on it.  I must admit I did check her phone records because I didn’t trust her, that’s how I found out she was still talking to her ex.  But I never gave her a reason to distrust me why would she spy on me.

20090205213039AA1mSNI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Need to live separately before file a divorce?	I heard in Canada, if you want to divorce you must live separate with your husband/wife for at least half year. Is that true?

20090205213127AABCt5l	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I need some advice on how to handle this guy?	I work for a small company that is having financial problems. They just cut all the employees salary by 20%. My husbands company is laying off 8000 employees as well and haven't notified which employees will be going. I am also trying to conceive a child and currently going through my first IVF cycle. The drugs are making me really emotional. At work I have to deal with the Sales Director who is pushy, over demading and yells when he wants his way. Just today in a room full of 15 employees he verbally attacked me out of the blue for something I was working on but couldn't complete in a day as he wanted. I can't really avoid this person or quit, but it is stressing me out and I am worried about if this will affect trying to conceive or make me lose my baby if I do. Does anyone have any advice how I can handle this guy or avoid the stress of this situation? Plus, the HR and Executives knows about his temper and don't care what he does or says.

Like in there 30's on up. Yet, sometimes I think that I am not attracting guys my age that much, which I don't understand why. So as I went to a reasturant, there was this older guy who was in his 50's came over to me and said that I was cute and left. Also, I was just sitting in the mall, waiting on someone and this guy approaches me trying to flirt, he look like he was about in his 40's.  How should I go about dealing with these old folks? Does this mean a good thing?  Do you think im still attracting guys my age. Please someone give me some serious advice. Thanks

20090205213732AAZT8nF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm not able to contact my husband for a divorce, what to do?	I sent the divorce papers to my husband (I lived in Tennessee, he lives in CT). I sent them certified and he received it. All I needed was his signature and to have them sent back to me so I could take them to the court. By the way, we don't have any children or property.        He called me to tell me that he sent them back, but I have not received them. Now after several emails to him, calling his cell phone, texting him, and calling the house where he lives, I can not get a hold of him.       Now I've moved to a different state, and have notified him of my new address so he has NO reason not to contact me. I know that there is a way to get a divorce if I can't find him, but I'm not sure how. What do I need to do to make sure I can prove that I've tried every way possible to reach him? How long does this usually take (approx)? Also, if I am able to file this way, can I add things to the divorce decree? For example, he owes me $1,500... is this something I can put in the decree?

20090205214036AA9O5VT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I try to get back together with my ex? Please, Please help?	About a year ago, my ex and I broke up after we had been dating about a little over a year. It wasn't really on the best terms.      We truly did love each other though, and it honestly felt like that forever kind of love. I still love her the same I did when I first knew I did.      Anyways, she told me she wasn't sure if she wanted to be with me because she had never done anything with another guy. So we took a break. I find out about a week later she had made out with a guy about a week before we took that break. So I was upset. I told her I never wanted to talk to or see her again for violating my trust like that.      It was her grandma's fault. Her grandma had never been with another man, cheats on her husband, and told my gf that she needed to break up with me and get with other guys or she would regret it.      She had written me a note though. The main point of it was that 'She knew I was the one. Even though she knew she wanted to be with me, she couldn't be with me right now.' It said, and I quote, 'I want to marry you and I want to have kids with you one day. Just not right now. I can't do it.'      I still have the note and all the other things she gave me when she left (small, mostly drawings, but very meaningful).       I don't know if I should take her note seriously though. I've talked to her a few times recently, and though we are on good terms now, I don't feel like she'd ever want to be with me again. She does currently have a boyfriend, and I know for a fact that all the guys she's dated since have treated her like sh!t, since she's told me. She even sent me a text recently saying 'What do I honestly deserve?' (as to meaning what does she deserve in a guy).      So anyways, I truly loved this girl and I know that if I married her I would be happy for the rest of my life. I don't know how she feels now though, even considering what she gave me. Should I just let her go or if I do go after her, how do I go about it? Especially since she has a boyfriend now and I know she won't just leave him. Would it be worth waiting out?

20060623125932AA3RTX5	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Very Complicated Love...Advice Needed....Please!?	My boyfriend and I had been together for a year and a half, living together for 1yr...Everything was great together, then he had to leave the Army for medical reasons and moved back to MD to be with his mother/sis/bro because they needed him to take care of them.. I am stuck 4000mi away and am 2yrs away from getting my degree, which we both agree is the best thing for me to do.  He and I broke up and didn't talk for a month and a half and he finally emails and calls and we are on the process of working things out.  He is working 6days a week, about 13hrs a day, hardly makes enough to support all four of them up there, and has some psychological problems because of serving in Iraq.  I am in love with him and he is the one I want to spend the rest of my life with, he feels the same, he says I am his world-the last thing he wants is for me to be unhappy...   Is love supposed to be this difficult?  And should he have to take on all the responsibilities and sacrafice him happiness?

20060708141420AAlIrao	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I control my orgasms?	I don't know what my problem is. When my girlfriend and me first started going out I could have sex for hours apon hours. I could have sex from morning to night. But now after being with her for almost 2 years, I can only have sex with her for about 25 mins. That may sound like a lot, which it doesn't if you have ever had sex before, but 25 minutes go by REALLY fast. How can I make my self have longer sex. I don't want to go out and buy pills, or buy anything to make me better, so id like to hear convienent ideas, I have already tried the climax control condoms, I get the same results.

20060713205542AAEVjve	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this infatuation or merely friendship?	Im am working in a small office and was tasked to employ an assistant to help me out in a major project last year. I managed to employ this lady ’S’ and for the next six months we basically formed a very good team, slogging day and night on the job and naturally seeing each other a lot. Things like lunching together ,taking the same train home daily and etc became part of our daily routine. Of course friendship grows and we appreciate each other a lot as we knows each other working style and can compliment the other party very well.There was a structural change in my office recently and now we are at the same level, she was tasked to handle another project but still get advices from me from time to time. She often complains to me about her new team members and I still always help her out, be it in after office hours or making special arrangement for her behind the sceneShe was station abroad due to this new project and we communicate daily either thru sms, emails of internet chats….so much so that I felt something amiss if  I don’t get to hear from her for just one day. Due to the difference in time zone….i would  even wait for her to the wee hours of the morningAll the while I thought that its only out of friendship and as part of ‘our team’ I am showing that much of care and concern. Even that she is back now….we still sent each other sms daily and talk over the phone for hours and Im always super protective towards herI much stress that both of us are married and there is not even the slightest bit of physical contact between us since day oneI am pretty worried about my emotional state now and don’t know what to do…..my wife trust me a 100% and told me its only me to be protective and showing tke amount of care for my friendsAny opinions out there can help me to analysis what is happening….or what should I really do….avoid contact with her or just maintain what is happening as we should know its just platonic

20060803172853AAp0S9n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he just not into me or is it something else?	This guy and I have known each other for about 6 months.  We work together but in different departments.  He's flirted with me before.  Then he just acted really nice for a while but not in a flirty way!  At first he could never make eye contact with me.  But now he does.  The thing is lately he sometimes seems like he can't again.  It all started when I tried getting personal with him.  He acted so nervous and shy.  Gave me big smiles and looked into my eyes and down at my lips.  But when we walked out together he just looked down and he almost seemed kind of sad.  He ignored me for a week.  Now he's talking to me again.  Today when he dropped something off for me I had to get up, he just stood across aways and looked at me but nervously and almost frustrated looking.  I'm 10 years older then him do you think this might be part of it?  I've always been so nice to him so he might think I like him.  And of course I do!!!!

I intend on moving my 3 year old son with me.  How do I go about filing for temporary custody so my husband doesn't try to take my son away?  I am not trying to be mean but he is not taking my leaving well and he keeps threatening me about keeping our little boy from me.  I have no intention on keeping our son from him but at this point, I don't think my heart can take anymore hurt, especially from not having my son. I just want a way to ensure that if our son goes to visit his daddy or his paternal grandparents during this transition/moving period, that I will get him back.  I live in Texas. Do I have to have an attorney to file for temporary custody?  Any advice legal or otherwise would be very beneficial for me.  Thank you!
