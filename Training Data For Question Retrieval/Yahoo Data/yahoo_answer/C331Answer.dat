She had her foot flat to the floor trying to get up the hill (she was in the wrong gear), when we got to the top we crossed the opposite side of the road and jutted off the cliff. Lucky for us the security barrier got caught under the car and pulled us back in like a spring. <br>  A change of underwear was needed by all involved!|`|tGAt3ZKkaa	YES!<br>  <br>  It was not VERY high but high enough to die if you fall off.<br>  <br>  I was on my skateboard with my friends and we didn't know we were on a cliff, we thought we were just going up hill.<br>  <br>  And I went off the edge but because we were going UPhill I was going pretty slow so I grabbed on to the ledge.<br>  <br>  And the funny part is, the was a small cave type thing sticking out under me so I didn't even have to hold on.<br>  <br>  lol<br>  <br>  <br>  good times|`|fDQ163B5aa	ah nope but definitely had dreams about falling off several sky scrappers, cliffs, fences etc etc ecetera..|`|h5p9exIDaa	Hi Shin lover,<br>   I totally My New Harley at the time(2007)Harley was just 4 months old..I was riding in the Mountains and it stop snowing a few hours before I got there..This was La Porte California..It was pretty cold so I stop at a small country store and had a cup of Hot Coffee..I decided not to go any farther and just go home..<br>   I left the store and was riding at 35 miles per hour and then I hit Black Ice..You can't do anything when you hit this stuff,but I try to bring her back up,but it didn't work..I when down the side of a Mountain and I hit every brush and everything else going down..When I finally came to a Stop,My Bike was a complete Mess..I broke a Rib,legs and arms badly bruised up and I hit My Head some hard it Damn near knock Me out and one Hell of a Black eye(It even Gross Me out)...I was Lucky to walk away from that wreck..I still ride today and I have another Harley and doing find..<br>   Never go to the Mountains after snowing,Black Ice is a Killer..Sooo True.. Thank You for listening to My Story..<br>  Your Friend,<br>  poppy1|`|SDP4qopIaa	Kinda.  I was stationed at Malmstrom AFB in Great Falls, Montana and a bunch of my friends and I went to the rockies to go fourwheeling for the forth of july weekend a few years back.  We found this really steep part of the mountain that flattened out a bit about two hundred foot up the side of it.  I was trying to climb it with my 400ex but when I got to the top I ran out of momentum and the quad flipped backwards on me.  I rolled all the way to the bottom with my quad flipping end over end right behind me.  Turns out I broke my collar bone and my fibula.  I was dumb and I was trying to impress this girl I had just met.  But it worked out good because since I was in a cast and on crutches she offered to stay at my place and chill with me for a few days after it happened.  It was pretty sweet!|`|b9c8b7ed89414752e9c9d8160bec8b19aa	hmmm...<br>  i once drank cookery stuff(liquid, just out of curiosity) and it made my throat swell and close so I couldn't breathe and I had to get to the fridge really fast to drink milk cause that reverses the really hot stuff. and keep my head up to keep breathing.<br>  maybe i was alergic or whatever<br>  but it was scary! i'm never gonna taste something even if i'm burning with curiosity.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	I think the thing that gets me with that "falling" feeling is when I almost slip like in the bathtub or almost trip I hate that feeling!|`|XFzX4nLSaa	Isn't Angel Island the home of the Master Emerald which Knuckles guards?|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	nope|`|AA12309532	Not me,  but my  dad  drove off  a  mountain  rode  on  ice .<br>  Luckily  him,  my mom,  and brother  were  all  belted in .

eYQMygJnaa	No offense, you are 20 years old, why do you label yourself as "emo"?  Isn't that a bit childish?  I can understand if you have struggled with depression, I have as well, but I'm not going to live my life with something holding me back.<br>  <br>  I  honestly think you should put the past behind you, start your life as a new and improved person, and maybe you will feel better about yourself.  You are holding onto the past; it is time to move on and gain a new perspective on life and all that it has to offer.  I'm curious, are you happy or ashamed to tell people that you are using anti-depressants?  This is a serious matter, and by the way you have described yourself here, it sounds like this is a cry for help and I recommend you see a psychologist or even just talk to someone you trust.<br>  <br>  As for you and your girlfriend, sounds like a love-hate relationship.  Is this for real, or are you just playing games?  I hope you think about this, and really, is your life as bad as you make it seem?<br>  <br>  I'm going to be blunt here, you need to push yourself and at least make the effort to feel better about yourself and stop being so depressed.  Why would you want to live your life like this forever?  Your life is just beginning, I hope you aren't proud of degrading yourself by stereotyping yourself as emo, because I am sure you are much better than that.  This is a reality check.  Time to grow up and face the truth.  And I am not being ignorant, I have been in your situation before.|`|Dd34j24laa	fight it and you know praying helps.  Looking back at myself I was basically depressed throughout my life but fight it, you know what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.|`|fSRqz7aYaa	Get a hobby, learn to play an instrument, listen to some upbeat music and work on getting your life upright.<br>  <br>  Dude, I'm sorry, but you come across as a whiny little boy in this question.

D8sN8gNFaa	It just went into depth about what America already knew (their health care sucks) I've talked with some americans who believe that their health care is better than ours (Canada). I'm not bragging, but if you're uninsured here you can't rack up a $200,000 hospital bill for having a sick kid. Sure you have to wait sometimes, but it's all free. The one part of the movie that surprised me was that the lady actually had to pay for the ambulance ride. That's pretty sad.|`|ViEgekyIaa	It makes me think that it's sad/funny the way people actually take what that biased man says seriously.|`|xqrwDmyUaa	I just wanted to say that I am Canadian and I had to pay for an ambulance ride. They do charge for that here. I didn't think they did until I got the bill. I haven't seen Sicko but I do take everything Michael Moore says with a grain of salt, his "docs" which I don't really classify as real documentaries are heavily biased. Watch Manufacturing Dissent, it shows how much he lied when making Roger and Me and talks about the interview he did get with him and the fact that he lied and said he never got it and left it out of his film. The people who made the film actually REALLY like Michael Moore, that's the sad part. Despite all of this I do watch his films and enjoy them, I just keep in mind that it's not the whole story.|`|XKhNw221aa	The only Micheal Moore film I liked was Canadian Bacon, the rest were biased documentaries.

My favorite album by them is "Phobia," released 2006. It is their darkest album (if they can be considered dark). They have also released two other albums: "Saturate," released in 2001, and "We Are Not Alone," released June 29, 2004. They are about to go into the studio shortly to begin recording their fourth studio album shortly, and hope to have it ready by summertime. They also did a lot of the music for "Halo," so if you know any gamers, they should have at least HEARD of the band. Their most famous song off of the Halo soundtracks is "Blow Me Away," so check that song out and play it for your friends. Most people are apt to have either heard that song, or  "Diary of Jane," but did not know who performed the song. So, there you go.|`|7UmSr1qpaa	This Band is not very new.... They have been around for quite a while. I recall listening to them when I was in 7th Grade. I'm now a Junior so it's been a good 4 years I've heard of them. It is quite old news. It's quite possible that you've just been so attuned to your music that you haven't been able to hear them.|`|Vf9mlHU7aa	yeah been around for ages there alright nothing new|`|t2evcVVEaa	theyve been around forever. old news.|`|SOGkJSN4aa	I like a lot of their songs<br>  Diary of Jane<br>  Breath<br>  Until the End<br>  So Cold<br>  Polyamorous<br>  Evil Angel

0F8hauikaa	Don't be scared sweetie. No one knows this for a fact. Just try to enjoy each day of your life as it comes, because each and everyday somebody's world does end.

So why worry about it.|`|sbdgdaznaa	OHNOEZ IT WAS IN THE NEWS SO WE ALL HAVE TO BELIEVE IT!<br>  <br>  WE'RE ALL GUNNA DIE!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Lol, I doubt it.  No one can tell for sure whether or not the world is going to end, and people said that it would end in Y2K didn't they?  And poof, nothing happened.  We'll just have to wait and see.|`|2IILBm42aa	Maybe the mayan people got tired think about it they had to die one day! And they said the world would end in 2000. But that is all a lie.

THAT was an awesome movie!! :DDD I can't wait for the next one: L changes the world!<br>  <br>  Peace Out|`|P8Q39vA4aa	You mean the live action? I personally have not seen it but i hear it is one of the best live action from anime out there.|`|gJhwH335aa	How about rent the movie and see if you like it before buy it. You don't want to regret buying it later don't you?<br>  <br>  I have seen the movie and kinda enjoyed it a bit though I must say the manga and anime counterpart is a lot better. The only reason I like the movie is because of the plot twist and the alternate ending they have on the second movie. There are several reason why I don't enjoy the movie.<br>  <br>  1. I don't really like several changes they made on the first movie like the way Light getting Naomi real name and the way he planned out Naomi suicide. Its more fun if they follow the original plot instead of making up unnecessary plot for this part. The movie starting to drifting away from the original plot starting from this part.<br>  <br>  2. The second movie is a huge letdown for me because they don't have that Yotsuba arc like the manga and anime counterpart did. Instead, they replace it with Takada being an anchor woman for Sakura TV and being the third Kira. One of the major disappointment to me is the fact that they clearly tell us who is the third Kira while on the manga / anime counterpart, we have to guess which one is the third Kira. I mean, I have a lot of fun guessing which one is the third Kira among the Yotsuba but on this movie.... -___-"<br>  <br>  3. The third movie is more like a filler or non canon to me because the movie has an alternate ending compare to the manga / anime counterpart. It's a whole new dimension of L character and we get to see Near making an appearance on the movie. The third movie kinda ruin the original storyline and the character development for the actual series which is why I consider it a filler. <br>  <br>  The movie isn't really that bad to be honest. Its still a good movie. Its just that, I prefer if they stick with the original plot. I do enjoy watching several scene from the manga / anime counterpart brought up in a live action. I like the way Kenichi Matsuyama potray L because we get to see that eccentric, weird gesture of L in live action. Light is a bit chubby if you ask me and he plays basketball instead of Tennis >__<<br>  <br>  Just rent the movie and see if you like it before buy it. I'm just sharing my opinion here. You are probably going to enjoy it more than I do.|`|mePPZXAsaa	Honestly, not really. The show is much better. It was quite dissapointing really.|`|X3dfHBGGaa	Well,I've seen the deathnote movies,but while I was watching them I noticed that it wasn't transulated well.I didn't even see Near or Mello.|`|RUQpHoYnaa	well watch it and you'll know<br>  <a href="http://www.justdubs.net/dubs/death_note_episodes/movie.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.justdubs.net/dubs/death_note_...</a><br>  i didn't watch it. i still have to finish the show, i have left the last 3 episodes but without L the story is kinda boring. if in the movie there's L i think it's be pretty good.

I love it now and it goes with music!|`|Ght1Ik7Iaa	THe Masks boosted they're popularity all crazy. <br>  Then they have like 4 unnecessary band members.|`|0b3fa313a09fd3b8730664822eb4455baa	I think they would be less popular.|`|d1wYHWK1aa	They are probably more popular for the masks, its their trademark. It makes them unique and separates them from the mainstream music.<br>  <br>  Us maggots like it anyways! AHIG!!!!!|`|E09RDCt8aa	Me I Say They Would Be Less Popular Because The Masks Are Their Trade Mark, And They Use The Masks To Show How They Change When They Play Their Music Live................|`|RQXjD8Bpaa	I heard the music b4 i saw the videos so i didn't really care cause it's still good music ya know.|`|5rEV8FgDaa	They would be less popular because they didn't have a special theme.With or without masks I still like them.|`|hGVkInSnaa	They suck horribly so why does it matter?
oA8Rtyxuaa	they play whats in demand, if they played things that aren't requested no one would listen. its sad, i know.

If you keep your legs shaved, even a tiny amount of growth seems phenomenally fast, whereas it you got a bad cut at the hair salon, it seems like AGES for it to grow back out to a length you can work with.  But for those of us who don't have to shave our legs, that hair doesn't seem to grow at all, but we have to go back to the barbershop at least once a month.|`|nqlk9iUCaa	If you think about it, Atleast 80 of your (Head) hairs fall out Daily, and You don't even Notice<br>  So, Not really.<br>  <br>  Edit: Sorry lol, I was actually trying to give a "Logical" answer for once!<br>  But Yea, It bugs the Hell outta me too|`|2DK4QoV9aa	yes which is ridiculous!! someone understands me =]|`|21cf999bfe54057972e1de48b7cd2cf3aa	Ugh, yeah.

XdMcYDgbaa	I think cause we have the capacity to see both sides of an equation...and we do not necessarily have an opinion or feeling towards either sides. <br>  <br>  and...although we are very cold... we understand emotions and people (at least I do) very deeply.<br>  <br>  Plus...I must admit...I am really good at lying...its like an art for me.<br>  <br>  so you have people who are objective, they understand people and they are good at lying. With that power, they know what influences others they know what other people like and they let them hear what they wanna hear.<br>  <br>  geminis are the type of people that would say a word...and it would have two meanings. We love to communicate...and writing is a gift we were born with.<br>  <br>  yeah|`|AA11946996	It’s one of the friendliest, most positive, most charming and interesting signs around. Mercury, the planet “in charge” of Gemini rules literature, media of all kinds, communications, language and speech.<br>  <br>  I'm a Gemini and there are no tricks, that I'll admit to anyways. We are the "communicators" of the Zodiac and thats what we do. Take the Cancers for example; they are the "mothers" of the Zodiac. Now are you wondering what tricks they use to care for you? <br>  <br>  We are the rulers of communication. Oh sorry, by the way, all Gemini's are Jedi's and we use the force to get you to do our biddings.<br>  <br>  (While waving hand) You will accept this as a good answer.|`|E5rhAaLGaa	Well im a Gemini and i am really good at negotiation and pursuading.<br>  I guess in your head you just put yourself in their shose. what would be good to hear, point out that there isnt anything to lose. i cant explain it very good, but i know what i mean lol|`|AA12170604	Johnny<br>  I am  Gemini and my wife is Libra (like Kimberley)<br>  you hit the nail right on the bl**dy head <br>  I honestly don't think i have ever lost an argument;  because of the way we Gemini's can twist things around to suit ourselves or the argument|`|5XfEuHuiaa	The secret to Gemini's negotiations are to be respectful to the person, be honest (sometimes use a little reverse psychology) and get your point across without belittling the person.|`|gUUtGcbBaa	you have to lie, like manipulate,  tell pple what i would like to hear if i was them<br>  man geminis are so full of mischief...but they are harmless they are the most naive signs and would never hurt you on purpose.|`|CYyVD0ADaa	Geminis are like the sexy lil bad fairies..<br>  tehe..<br>  I'm Libra with a Gemini partner and honestly I can't say I've thought of him as a "sexy bad lil fairy" haha..<br>  <br>  They have a passion for words communication and conversation their brains are always buzzing.<br>  <br>  I remember one night I was lying next to my Gem male when he was fast asleep (I couldn't get to sleep). He suddenly woke up and nudged me...asking if i were awake... I was like yea why?.. He was like i need to talk to someone I said why wats wrong? He was like nothing I just feel like I need to talk!<br>  <br>  I swear communication is their oxygen! They have their way with words because of their passion for words and communication.<br>  They can be very manipulative and would all make excellent actors!<br>  very correct quote about Gems "Geminis are lovers not haters, but will knock you the f*ck out".<br>  Just dont make their innocent blood boil and you will be fine ;) <br>  <br>  <br>  Libra<br>  x|`|cjk4eZWvaa	Gemini's bring out the best in others and make you feel like you can walk on water. People like to be around people that make them feel good about themselves.  We have a way with words and we sometimes stretch the truth to get what we want.  We can be manipulative too, so be on guard.

oA8Rtyxuaa	i read the book the first girl suggested, i liked it too!|`|aVMVjfGMaa	well if you like girly type books you should check out Angus,thongs and full frontal snogging by Louise Rennison <br>  i am also really girly at what to read and it's a weird title but it's a very good book<br>  it's about a girl named Georgia who is around 13ish:)<br>  so check it out and let me know what you think <br>  and i thought i wouldn't like it but almost every girl in our team/school read it and it's also a series so just let me know <br>  thanks:)<br>  and it's also a movie just the first one but it's called angus thongs and perfect snogging<br>  BYE<br>  hope you read it and take my suggestion:)

Ide give it a shot if you dont wanna spend the extra cash.|`|SkRJNhuCaa	Get a real amplifier, don't waste money on some piece of Spider junk.<br>  <br>  Something like a Vox AC15CC1 or AC30CC would do nicely.<br>  Remember that wattage says little about loudness, especially when comparing solidstate amps like the Spider to tube amps like the Vox AC range.<br>  A 15W tube amp can be louder than a 50W solid state amp and still sound good.
cVbpywZpaa	because truthfully most new music is shite, the only new(2000sish onwards) bands i like are the strokes, the arctic monkeys, the libertines and the kings of leons first two albums were good.but give me the rolling stones, zepplin, guns n roses, rhcp, oasis, pink floyd or acdc any day!!!|`|73760ec70f62b217eab4a5ab28ce822baa	Because that's just your taste.

Good Music is still being made, but it's not being played. Atleast not  on radio in my part of the country.<br>  Some Newer Bands you might be able to get into based on your love of punk & RHCP are 9 Black Alps, The Artic Monkees, Louis IXV, Local H, The White Stripes,  The Racounteurs,or Operation Ivy. Public Radio is one of the few places good music is still being played.

Steve Martin and Bill Murray<br>  <br>  **************<br>  Tom Cruise, overrated? Brad Pitt? There is a difference between being sick of ad nauseum media coverage of a celebrity and them being overrated for their skill. Truth be told, I think this thread is great proof that they are actually undersold as actors. How can you watch Magnolia or Rain Man and call Tom Cruise an overrated actor? What about Kalifornia, True Romance, Seven, friggin 12 Monkeys for Brad Pitt? Interview With the Vampire for both of them? It's not their fault that for some reason silly people can't get enough of their pictures on magazine covers. They're both fine actors.|`|PzaJO1Ekaa	robert pattinson...major sh!t. if good looks and no talent were needed for a leading role, then sign me up.

Once they are in love they want to make sure the person loves them back, and sometimes trying to figure that out might sounds possessive, controlling! If they feel that the person they are with might be cheating or not faithful, then they will start to investigate and that might seem controling to you. However, once a Scorpio feels comfortable with the trust he/she puts in their partner then don’t expect them to be possessive or controlling! Once they love the person a lot, to a point where they can not imagine their life w.o them, they try to do everything they can to keep that person happy and in their life... wouldn’t you?...|`|bvwYVGJOaa	Scorpio|`|50dfad07d8ee2b10b7bb6c48c0f62037aa	Scorpio tends to be more possessive by far.|`|gUUtGcbBaa	scorpios leo arent that possesive.|`|0Wj5MRjNaa	def Scorpio. they're the most possessive out of all the signs. ;)|`|tFcsLR7Maa	ME ! <br>  <br>  I guess i'm cursed !!

MwiBGBK1aa	Be confident, friendly, don't be overly nice that it's annoying. Be cool and be yourself, let her know that you're interested in taking her out for a nice dinner or movie.<br>  <br>  Most women, including myself, don't like men that completely throw themselves right away, coming off too nice and too strong is annoying and a turn off.|`|JpfECkjzaa	haha im 20 and never had a girlfriend....but i dont want one i want to focus on my school, work, guitar, and car right now...im honestly too busy for one. yes the nice guy comes in last. you have to act only semi interested in a girl... dont over complement her or come off strong AT ALL!!!! this is a major turn down for guys and girls. you have to act confident even if youre not. hey, dont be yourself (contradiction to what you always hear) because it obviously aint working... so look around and see what an alpha male does and make it your own.|`|t6MdopzFaa	umm i think it depends on the girl your going after<br>  <br>  <br>  like in my case i like the nice guy,. my boyfriend is the nice guy and its the amount of attention he gave me what made me notice him, even though he did kinda of do it in a smooth way. all my ex when they wanted to date me was more like a game, semi interested, like nice but then would take it away and then nice again and then take it away, cycle. that to me is annoying i hate guys. if you like me show me, thats the type of girl i am. i'm a nice girl too, very polite, talkative, and outgoing so im happy my BF is too( he's the one by the way, i know it, he's the only one i've only told that he's the one).<br>  <br>  <br>  my best advice is just be yourself...if you want try to be smooth but not so smooth, we like dorky sometimes, like when you try to be smooth and you mess up and aren't so smooth and the girl notice and we giggle. Girls/ we love that! but that usually is a natural thing, when a guy is just being himself. don't try to hard.|`|0fd84ba056353594be65eb4771d885ebaa	wow good luck in life|`|yVZR0N0Haa	Maybe it's the hat.

He's cried on the show before so this wasn't totally out of the ordinary for him.  He already stated earlier in the season how much the brown team meant to him, so I guess seeing them split up was part of why he was so upset.

But I will focus on the one that is the most important to me at this time.<br>  <br>  I want to talk to my ex boyfriend. I want to talk to him because I want to see where we went wrong. I know if there were different circumstances at the time that we dated, we really would have been in it for the long haul. <br>  <br>  I reall miss him alot because I feel that he is the one of the people who taught me to be strong. Even though the way he taught it too me hurt like hell (he broke up with me, so I had to learn how to deal with it and move on). I have learned a whole lot about myself from him, so yes, I miss him dearly.<br>  <br>  But like they say, people come into your life for a reason or a season, and then once they fufill what their purpose is in your life, they leave. Wish they could stay forever, but everything is not meant to be even though we want it to.|`|SLL4sNnnaa	Yes. They are my Parents. My Mother Passed away by 1975 and my Father by 1984.

q5m9g1yWaa	Oh, you have no idea how mad I am that Jamie got sent home instead of Leah. Jamie knew the mistakes she made every single time, Leah didn't care at all. She pretty much sabotaged Arianne on the episode where she went home, and she constantly has a "I really don't care about this competition" attitude. I think they kept her on purely for the drama factor with Hosea.<br>  <br>  And then they bring Leah, Jamie, and Jeff back to compete...and choose Jeff, who also messed up a million times.<br>  <br>  I don't get it at all. Jamie definitely deserves to be in the Top 3. I'm hoping either Stefan or Carla wins...I can't help but love Carla, lol.|`|iklfmx02aa	totally agree leah needed to be gone a long time ago|`|aZXnW6AUaa	yes|`|DtkLsetkaa	I agree, I would have loved to see Jamie in the finals, maybe to replace Hosea.  I think the final 4 should have been Fabio, Stefan, Carla and Jamie, but after those 4, picking the final 3 is SO hard.  I really loved Fabio and really hate Stefan, but damn Stefan is good lol.  I am rooting for Carla in the finale :)|`|Leda2ha0aa	I do think that Jamie was the better chef even though early on in the season all she seemed to prepare was scallops.  One guest judge did compliment her in a big way saying he loved to watch her cook and she was very methodical.  That says a lot about her skills.<br>  <br>  Leah was probably kept on to keep the "shomance" going between her and Hosea even though it fizzled.  In the Quickfire challenge where Jamie, Leah and Jeff were all brought to New Orleans, Stefan said that Leah is an extremely talented chef.  That was a very big compliment coming from an egomanic like him.<br>  <br>  In the end, they both were able to come back and try to get into the finals one last time and I'm surprised Jamie didn't win it.  All in all it has been a good season and I can't wait to see who wins.
vsy4QMHMaa	The one that gets used, the one that inspires a person to play, the one that isn't treated as an object of adoration or coveting and left to wither in the corner of the room.<br>  <br>  ... and your screen name has me wanting to retell the old "What is better than roses on your piano?" riddle but I won't.|`|tuATxHsVaa	I'm not sure why people took your question and twisted it around. Your question is fairly straightforward... who makes the best pianos? <br>  <br>  Others say.. it depends on what music... is this still the Classical forum?  I think we're talking about Classical music here! Sure, we can talk about harpsichords and period instruments like fortepianos... but I think not.<br>  <br>  If you don't know that special feeling that you get inside of you when you find out you're playing on a Steinway... maybe you haven't played on enough pianos yet =).<br>  <br>  Why did people even consider who is playing this piano? Let's just assume that one of the greatest piano players in the world is playing.<br>  <br>  More often than not, this player will probably agree that Steinway & Sons, B?sendorfer, Baldwin, Mason & Hamlin, or even Petroff make the greatest modern pianos in the world. Bechstein also makes a fine piano.<br>  <br>  In my professional opinion, the pianos from Steinway & Sons are unmatched by any other modern piano manufacturer. I have never really liked Baldwins all that much.<br>  <br>  Yamahas and other Asian pianos are not at all very good in my opinion. Yamaha makes great practice instruments and tolerable, cheap concert grands. It's more of a budget piano. In a world where a decent violin costs $50,000 and up, how can anyone say that Steinway pianos are too expensive? They are priced just right for what you get.<br>  <br>  Steinway & Sons - final answer.|`|rNqF4gIVaa	There is no definitive answer to your question... it depends on what is to be played on the instrument in question. The best pianos are essentially hand built so they vary from instrument to instrument. They are also extremely expensive. There are three manufacturers that pring to mind when considering a top of the line piano... Steinway, Fazioli and Bosendorfer (as far as pianos built today), but this list is by no means comprehensive and other manufacturers built instruments that are competitive with them. Judgment on what constitutes "the best" is highly subjective.|`|tcf0jbIpaa	The one that fills lonely hearts with joyful music. The one that changes lives through its beautiful conveyance of emotion though musical notes. <br>  <br>  The best piano in the world is one that is used by someone who understands the purpose of the instrument, and uses it to do all of those wonderful things.|`|SkRJNhuCaa	There is no "best". It's all personal preference.<br>  The "best" when it comes to mechanical quality is likely one you'll never be able to afford, in which case it's utterly useless to you for example.|`|64jTtN0jaa	Probably a Steinway. That's what you see most concert pianist using. But who knows... I own a Kawai.|`|ZELFStQnaa	The answer will always depend on the piano player himself/ herself. No matter how excellent the pianos are like Yamaha, Steinway, Bechstein, and others more if the piano player doesn't know how to play with expression, the music played will not make any difference.|`|YIJWZfPDaa	My personal favorite is a Steinway piano.<br>  <br>  However, the performer is what makes a piano great!

AA12025213	Ok, well, the keys of the piano are attached to hammers using levers. When you press a key, the lever moves so that the hammer strikes a string. <br>  <br>  The higher registers of the piano have about 3 strings per note, which have to be tuned exactly together, otherwise you get that honky tonk dusty bar sound out of it. As the notes get lower, the strings get thicker, and are able to resonate better, which eliminates the use of more strings. This balances out the volume across the keyboard. <br>  <br>  The strings are housed in a box that is built to amplify vibrations. The same concept works if you take any wood object (a wall, for instance works great), and use it as a sounding board for anything that makes noise by touching the vibrating part of it to the wood, causing the wood to buzz at the same frequency (speed) and amplifying the sound. <br>  <br>  So we have this box that is not only vibrating with the strings, but it causes the waves that the strings AND the box produce to bounce off of each other and the sides of the walls, and all of the wood in there, which amplifies the waves even more.<br>  <br>  The amplified waves then move across the air, and reach your ear drum, which your brain interprets as sound, and gives you the pleasure or displeasure that you have when you hear it.<br>  <br>  There.|`|E6669uxyaa	The are attached by levers to a hammer the hammer than hits a string which vibrates creating the sound the lower the note the lower the sting the lower the pitch the higher the note the thiner the string the higher the pitch|`|tcf0jbIpaa	The keys of a piano drop hammers that strike corresponding strings. There are also typically three foot pedals on a piano that raise or lower the hammers to give the piano a more shimmery sound or a more mute sound. Raising up the top covering of the piano amplifies the sound.<br>  <br>  Because pianos use hammers to strike the strings, they are often classified as percussion instruments, however some call them string instruments. Since organs use air, they can be construed as woodwinds. For this reason the musical community as decided to put pianos, organs, and harpsichords under the classification of keyboard instruments.|`|Jd91RxNKaa	you hit one of the keys and a wooden hammer like thing hits a copper cord inside of the piano which vibrates and makes a sound. For every key there is a hammer the same size and for every hammer there is a different size of cord that when struck by the hammer creates a different sound.|`|L0o5OJp2aa	A piano is a strings instrument because then you press a key, a hammer is released hitting a string for the corresponding note.

VXW1XeFsaa	You need to actually play the piano to develop those muscles and the neural nets in your brain that correspond to them.  The Czerny piano finger exercises are excellent but if you don't read music, you will need to have someone show the exercises to you on a keyboard and memorize how to do them.  In the meantime, start learning to read music-it is a skill you can use with any instrument and with singing.|`|THuplVHpaa	Practice, practice, practice. <br>  Doing the scales over and over again might help. <br>  Best of luck to you!!|`|Khwt4oL6aa	On these free video clips in the link below, you can watch the piano exercises Hellene Hiner uses with her students of all ages on the day to day basis. This piano training helps to establish coordination of different groups of fingers essential for piano playing. You may start learning and practicing the exercises with children as young as 2-3 year-old. At this age they already capable of controlling each finger of right and left hand, and coordinate both hands.|`|m12R3pEMaa	Play the parts separately.  If you can get one to the point where you could play ti in your sleep, then work on the other hand.<br>  <br>  Another option that I have actually used is to play the full treble part and alter the bass part so that I am only playing quarter or eighth notes with my left hand.  Then, once I master that, I slowly increase the skill level until I can play the full piece.|`|qswrz268aa	You don't learn dexterity...<br>  <br>  You build it, just like you build muscles. I highly don't recommend Hanon like a previous answer said. I recommend Cramer studies. They're much more fun and effective than the ridiculously boring Hanon. Brahms's studies are superb too...<br>  <br>  Arpeggios help too, and scales.<br>  <br>  All you need is regular practice, and diligently keeping to it...|`|ZELFStQnaa	Have you tried playing Hanon exercises from the Hanon virtuoso book? It has all the finger exercises you will need including all the scales from harmonic to major to minor scales, all the arpeggios from each of the scales as this book is meant to develop finger dexterity.

NQnOw4Qbaa	Work on tone and smoothness rather than speed and the speed will take care of itself.  The best leverage comes from the Classical orthodox grip with the ball of the thumb of the fretting hand centered on the back of the neck.  Doing the steel-string grip with the neck nestled in the palm of the hand requires that strngth be built-up in the fore-arm and will take some time to master:  It is also more prone to causing Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address.

Just search for Bleach raws of the episodes you're needing.<br>  <br>  In the event that you still have difficulty finding them, you might consider settling for quality fansubs and just strip or crop out the text.|`|22tPNksKaa	I can only think of Youtube, which has RAWs for some episodes. Good luck!

5faa7df1dbf6be8d22c72f7cca966e7baa	To be honest, I don't think you can find a good, dependable car for under $2000.<br>  <br>  I loan might be difficult to obtain right now, especially with the economy in the shape it is in, but you might try to do the following.<br>  <br>  Look for a good dependable car.  Here in Texas you can find them priced anywhere from $5000 to $7000.  Get the paper work on the car, year, make, model, mileage, warranty, and price and take it to a bank.  Ask to speak to a loan officer.  Tell the loan officer what you want and why you want it.  Explain your life situation and state firmly, but politely you absolutely need a car in order to better your life.  Also, have a reasonable and well thought out plan for making the monthly payments on this loan and be able to prove where this money will come from.  If you are truly as responsible as you sound, I think you have a pretty good chance of obtaining a loan for a car.  Good luck to you.|`|16vMIGPiaa	You might be able to buy a car for what you have available BUT what will you do about operating it?<br>  You have to buy insurance.  That'll cost you about $100 per month.<br>  You have to buy gas.  You'll spend about $20 per week.<br>  You have to put tires on it.  Tires will will cost you $300 every year or two.<br>  And there are incidental repairs and maintenance.<br>  <br>  If you can't afford to save up around $4000 to buy a better car, you can't afford to run a car once you have it.  And you certainly can't afford to be servicing a car loan.<br>  <br>  Finish high school.  Go to college.  Live on campus.  Visit home once per semester and either ride with someone or take the bus.<br>  Do Not saddle yourself with the expense of a car until you must have it for a job.  That won't be for several years yet.|`|YX1ddnXmaa	Buy the Honda, put another $1000 on new tires, battery etc...do NOT take out a loan, would be very bad idea with no income, insurance and gas will take what you make.|`|gQudMMTXaa	NO taking out a loan for a car is a very bad idea!!! <br>  Car's loose value so so quickly it is really not worth it!|`|f4zlMpc6aa	Id say your mom is right.. you might find a car for under $2k that seems fine.. but it wont be.. you pay for what you get and $2k is really cheap and would most likely break down pretty quick..you would end up putting more money into the car then it is worth just to get your self around.. maybe $50 here or $75 there... but it will add up.. its just not a good idea..|`|oTmylEGUaa	Maybe you could try to take out a student loan for the car.  You wouldn't have to pay it back until six months after you graduate.  The honda for $1000 seems like a great deal.  I have a  1996 buick skylark custom with 119000 miles that is super clean and a great runner I'd sell you for 1700.

My husband saw how much it bothered me that he was friends with this lady and put a stop to the friendship.  Tell your man how much it bothers you and maybe he will talk to her.|`|CINVz5qXaa	Nope. <br>  But  what a dumbass, needy loser  is that woman.|`|ogs0AZA3aa	Kick her a**!|`|Sw0yxyueaa	takes two to tango.

I did not ask her anything. I did not even respond to her messages, because she's not the one in a committed relationship with me. She is not obligated to do anything for/with me and has no responsibilities that affect my life.<br>  <br>  My man however... II never got pissed at him (only on the inside). I remained cool and collected and simply told him it was hurting and disrespectful to me that he was allowing this to continue. He had to make a choice, cut ties and stick to it.<br>  <br>  He would have a lot to lose leaving me for another woman, so I wasn't really sweating it (most of the time :P). If he had left me then he didn't deserve me and wasn't worth being with in the first place.|`|CVP5SOsbaa	She obviously does not care about what you say so don't talk to her. <br>  <br>  Talking to your man, in an honest and truthful way (but don't be needy!) is probably the best thing to do. Relationships are all about honesty, and that includes sharing thoughts or situations that might not always be fun to deal with. If he loves you, he'll do the right thing.|`|39wdXn3haa	Yes.  Getting rid of her is your boyfriend's problem and you should let him know that in no uncertain terms!  He can do it if he loves you.|`|qF4S56THaa	Kick her ***!!<br>  haha<br>  no no.<br>  Umm <br>  Well.. have ur guy tell her off.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090224163301AAnFi56&r=w">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|nmu6coapaa	I would break her face. Simple as that|`|04d81c107f433cebb6371d36ae227a9baa	I WOULD SNACK DOWN THAT NASTY SKANKY GARDEN HOE!!!|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	Wow I am not sure I can do better than the answers you have already gotton they are great. I agree don't waste your time with girls like that. It won't matter what your relationship is or if you have children with women like that. Because they have no self respect, morals or values. Those kind of women will take what they can get however they get it because they don't care. Has to be your boyfriends deal explain to him how that makes you feel. Or sometimes it helps to turn things around because guys do think differently than we do. Ask him how he would feel if it was the other way around? Sometimes they really don't know so once you explain yourself then if he doesn't do anything about it, my might want to question his commitment.|`|t9htoO50aa	Yes that has happened with us but my wife knows she has nothing to worry about because I made a promise to her and I always keep my promise. We had the same situation with a guy trying to break us up, it was her boss and she quit her job to get away from him because he wouldn't learn that some people believe in their wedding vows.|`|7toznquyaa	Talk to your man.. not to the girl. <br>  He's giving her the signals that her actions are acceptable.<br>  He should tell her in no uncertain terms that he's not interested and she's stepped over the lines of friendship.<br>  <br>  If you guy would Man up.. you wouldn't be having this problem.|`|G6Uy43coaa	Yes...and after we divorced, they started living together.   Better for me to be alone than in bad company.....

TCehI17kaa	My guess it sounds like the meeting of two people with two personalities is like mixing Oil & Water.|`|hR1cZhJBaa	when you put together 2 chemicals, and soemthing happens...like, it changes colour...or starts to smoke.... is it not transformed?<br>  <br>  So 2 people meet, there is a reaction, both lives transformed. <br>  <br>  This could be meeting a friend!<br>  <br>  If 2 chemicals meet, and nothing happens... same with 2 people...do you phone them up when you need to talk? Nope... life the same as before|`|houWY7qvaa	When you mix the two they are transformed whether it be two personalities meeting one another or two chemicals mixed.together, how hard is that?  Both are changed and not the same as previously.|`|BO28Mn8haa	because when two chemicals collide, they come together and form something new. think of H20 (water) made from hydrogen and 2 oxygen|`|I6vMxEU9aa	Think of it this way... Say you meet 10 new people today. When meeting most of them, you walk away feeling unchanged - just like two chemicals that don't produce any kind of chemical reaction. But if you meet one person that you talk with and you find each other's personalities engaging, your relationship will probably continue and (as with any relationship) both parties will grow and change - like a chemical reaction.|`|abc381813c165c2e05af1a5b03932dd2aa	that is an chemistry defination of human relationship,<br>  in othr words u  make relation with some body (any kind of relation) when u get attracted to his personality or something which bond u to make relation..................<br>  <br>  see if u meet a person on the yahoo answer and liked his answer or question, then u add him/her to ur contact...........  <br>  now u can see that u and that guy r chemical substance , a reaction happen as u liked answer or question, and u transformed as a friend on net and that s how u transformed............<br>  <br>  i hope u got it|`|PHOyKsmPaa	Everyone has effect on everyone else. Whether positive or negative, you are making an impact in the world around you. Nothing is static, including our personalities and outlooks. They are constantly being changed by what we observe and learn. We are constantly evolving. Being shaped by the circumstances and people that come in and out of our lives. Even if we are just trying to avoid someone, that is changing the way we are experiencing the world because of the different path that avoidance (fear) puts us on.|`|XuEMf100aa	When you put together two chemically reactant substances, they transform into an entirely knew substance.  So the quote is talking about two different personalities reacting to the other and going through a transformation.|`|N2XKAzZQaa	um, sounds like it's saying when you meet someone both you & the person you have met's lives have changed because of the meeting<br>  <br>  :)|`|FD0cZu9Uaa	sodium on it own is just fine; so is chloride but if they meet and combine you have salt and that is a tasty transformation.|`|jFqWYC4uaa	Unless you sit and talk in a positive manner you cannot solve any problem.|`|CYhOr4s7aa	sounds like crap to me|`|bIouq64Oaa	Well, there's a simile here - Carl Jung is comparing the meeting of two people with a chemical reaction. As you know, certain chemicals, when combined, cause chemical reactions that alter the chemicals. Carl Jung is suggesting that when two different people meet, if they connect, they are both changed, thus a "chemical reaction" has been worked.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	People you meet can touch your lives in many ways.  It has been said that some people come into your life for a reason, a season, or a lifetime.  In each case, you and the other person are both changed, hopefully better for meeting each other.|`|grwtwPbAaa	Your Question:   Will you help me understand this quote?<br>  The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances; if there is any reaction, both are transformed.<br>  <br>  Carl Jung<br>  <br>  <br>  I kinda like this response to your quote!  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ideas are, in truth, forces. Infinite, too, <br>  is the power of personality. A union <br>  of the two always makes history. <br>  Henry James, Jr.<br>  <br>  How can anyone not be transformed as soul messages  as well as  spiritual messages touch and are exchanged...chemistry and thoughtful unite in this excahnge...Both hearts are transformed!

So if you're prepared to sell a 700 quid telly for 20 quid, fair enough.<br>  <br>  Just a note: Someone mentioned that you get about a third of the value, but that's not true. They offer you a third of what they can sell it for.|`|YW74O9aNaa	i totally agree!<br>  I was in USA on a work visa. The project i worked on ended on a short notice due to cash problems and i had to return back to my country in just a couple of days notice.

That's when you say "I have a life" Like really. Just because you missed his call doesn’t mean that you were deliberately trying to ignore him. And if he’s said this to you on more than one occasion then I suggest you move on and find someone else because any guy who acts paranoid over trivial matters is a complete waste of time.<br>  Hope this helps =)|`|4YnoykD2aa	He likes you, but guys always act weird.

Some  Turkish and Armenian, Irish music, or maybe one or two by Johnny Cash, Cat Stevens, or Dean Martin, or a few 60's songs. I happened to find this great listening site by typing the words in the Google bar : Songza. Then when you reach Songza, it will have an orange screen, just type in what you want on the search bar of that site and you can listen to anything you want, just like your computer is a stereo and you have almost all the songs that were ever recorded under that title to listen to for free. Only if you have the speaker system on your computer you can try this. There is also a small video picture to compliment the song on the screen.

fQqAWGTgaa	hmmm... well thought out answer, or something quick like the Yahoo Bunny...<br>  <br>  Since he looked back and checked you out, at a time he guessed you would not be looking... I'd say that he was interested in you for one reason or another.  It could have been your pants, it could have been your butt, it could have just been you.  Does he like you?  That's a bit of a stretch.  Only he knows why he looked back at you.  But it does show interest, and that is encouraging.<br>  <br>  (insert my standard answer here)... yes communication.  Work on it.  I promise you... if you work on being direct and to the point with people, it will really help your confidence and comfort levels in social standing.  It will.  I'm NOT saying that you should approach him tomorrow with a scene like this...<br>  <br>  you: Hey.  Were you checking out my butt yesterday?<br>  him: Umm.. well, you know...<br>  you: It's Ok.  I like the idea.  Anything else you want to check out?  *blink* *blink*<br>  <br>  ... however if you treat this like it might be a sign, you can then step tentatively forward, and talk to him some more, or try flirting a little, or when you talk to him, reach out and touch his forearm a few times.  That little physical contact will do WONDERS for encouraging him, if he really is interested in you.|`|YE0baNYRaa	he may like you but just wait and watch his body language to see if he is interested in you. if you think he is then you can throw hints at him and flirt a lot to tell him you are interested.|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Audri,<br>  <br>  Yes .. he's interested and was checking you out .... it was either the killer outfit or the person wearing it . . . .<br>  <br>  I'd think it was a combination .. the total package !<br>  <br>  Have fun & good luck.|`|tGkhYbM2aa	If he is reluctant to make the first move, then you will have to do it.<br>  Talk to him and you will have your answer.|`|7nRom97Daa	why don't you ask him that question instead of wasting our time here?|`|G0wGbdENaa	wats the harm in asking|`|AA10629904	yes i think he do , i feel that u talk abt me|`|UdwIaCxBaa	My cliche answer - Just ask him girlfriend!<br>  <br>  *Clicks fingers*<br>  <br>  : )

t9htoO50aa	Reality is much better. I dreamt for years before I met Makwa of her and in some of the dreams we made love. I dreamt of making love to her in her bed with what seemed to be stars above us. Two years later when I finally met her I was at her house to move her stuff down to my place and we were making love and I looked up and on the ceiling just like in the dream there was theses glow in the dark things she had put on her ceiling and I tell you it was a lot better making love that night than it was in my dream. Dreams do come true so don't give up on you dreams. It didn't stop me from pursuing other relationships at the time but they didn't work out. I couldn't understand why at the time but when my dreams came true then I seen why the other relationships didn't work out.|`|JV0i77uiaa	Yes indeed, I had a dream once with this guy and that was the most fantastic thing.  It was like been in heaven, but other had been like a nightmare.|`|fp4mChXHaa	yes i do and i cant wait for it to happen|`|AA12226501	I used to wonder about that...now I know.<br>  Fantasies are idealized, no relationship is perfect.<br>  However, I'd rather have the relationship I have with my wife than be constantly searching for something that might possibly be better...if she leaves me, I guess I'll search again.<br>  Yes, I believe in making dreams come true...you can't always dwell in fantasy, you have to conform your dream to reality as best you can.|`|mggll8dRaa	I am too busy 'Bettering Myself' at this time;<br>  <br>  Then hopefully, I will eventually find a more Quality S.O.......!!<br>  <br>  But, I'm Happily single,at this time.....lol.....!!|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	My dream is my reality.

But I am not afraid of the storms, for I learned how to sail "our ship" together with the captain.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	No I don't wonder that. A dream doesn't hold me and kiss me like he does. I had the wondering before we actually met and by the time we met I was sick of long-distance and dreaming and wondering and was ready for the real thing and he is!<br>  Yes I believe!|`|L1DUcTtSaa	Yes i do, i believe you should never give up on a dream no matter if its big or small.

He reacted by proposing to me on the friends group that we met on! :) Have a super Hump Day!|`|t9htoO50aa	Yes but it was the wrong person. I found it back in my mailbox a few days later. This person did say she regretted it after I met Makwa. We are still friends with this person.|`|JV0i77uiaa	Yes I did once and got back a Dear John letter.|`|RyYV3aXlaa	Yes and the judge read it too. I won't ever do that again.

6ik7OJRNaa	...If he cries for me, he is a sensitive, kind, romantic, gentle, wonderful guy....<br>  <br>  ...If he cries for someone else, he is a stupid man whore....|`|XjcrMNBuaa	i think it really shows their vulnerability and its one of the most intimate moments u could possibly share with him|`|a745322b92770fa14e810733a8030534aa	It makes me nervous.|`|jYmvtUC5aa	...y'all have tear ducts too......it's human....|`|oDGttkmLaa	It's crushing to witness b/c you know they don't want to do it. I remember when I saw my dad cry. He was watching a movie (Home Alone ) and he cried when the kid was walking alone..looking in the windows of the happy families but had none of his own. And..I mean..god..it's 'HOME ALONE'. ..no one should be crying to that...but it made me realize how deeply his childhood had effected him. And it just made me respect him more and feel for him more. I think he's the only man I've ever witnessed cry.<br>  WAIT...my ex fiance did when he was trying to explain why I shouldn't go for coffee with men after I'm dating someone. At the time I thought "WHOA..if he's crying he must be right"..but now I just think he's a sonofabitch.|`|GBRmOem8aa	It really depends on what he is crying about.... It can be cute if the reason is something that is worth crying over.... but then it can be just absurd and make them look like a wimp if they cry over something that has made no point to cry over....|`|HRQjffv8aa	It shows that they have a sensitive side, which is good. <br>  <br>  I feel bad when a guy cries..because mostly they cry when it truly hurts unlike girls who cry much more often.|`|oDL02s8kaa	i know this may sound really weird...but it's kind of a turn on!!!<br>  <br>  wiping his tears and comforting him can always lead to other things!!!|`|4YnoykD2aa	I don't mind.<br>  Why aren't you numbering your questions anymore ohGr?|`|mwv79AIhaa	damn, havent had a reason to tear up in a long time...but just here checking answers|`|f8d37f51816f93a01c3756a4f407dca2aa	Just over 4 years ago.<br>  For reasons I won't get into here.|`|jBKiD5ugaa	Its okay , shows heart!|`|pclfASBraa	i don't think much of it, we are all human and we all cry even if we admit it or not. i don't think there is anything wrong with it.|`|yz6G7jfXaa	yea, i did weep recently.<br>  my times are bad right now, i had to wait till late night so no one could see ;P<br>  i've lit a fuse, just waiting for it to explode!!! get the idea?|`|fTLzKg5Eaa	It touches me Deeply and Makes me think that This Man is So strong not to be afraid to show his tears...not to be afraid to fail...|`|0Pf6yvhwaa	i think its sorta sweet, a little to sweet if he crys often. <br>  <br>  i like to see a guys sensitive side every once it a while... shows that they ARE infact human|`|pvvNuOXlaa	When a man cries, it is sign that he is not hung up on being macho.  Not being able to cry is not healthy.|`|UHGQI2p8aa	umm it depends<br>  A little cry I think is a little sweet<br>  weaping in my arms....well not as sweet|`|sZHcfnq9aa	i think it's normal. everybody cries.|`|6Nmly1wmaa	Its okay...I mean if they cried over a chick flick ide be a little concerned|`|qWELS6N2aa	Its ok, as long as they dont cry more than me.|`|sP8KrvA7aa	Maybe it's the way I was raised but .. I've always thought that real men don't cry in front of others. Not unless someone they loved more than anything just died or something.|`|AA10053661	I think it's normal..... I think anyone that feels passionately about something or someone is going to cry when that something or someone is taken from them, hurt or compromised in some way. <br>  <br>  I see NFL football players who have put their heart and soul into the game weep real tears in the playoffs when they lose. I see men cry when they lose their jobs and feel they can't protect and take care of their families. I see guys rejected for being the best they can be...... and the tears of frustration well up in their eyes, even if they don't let them fully stream down their face. <br>  <br>  I think anyone, man or woman, that can cry is healthy. They are letting their feelings out, instead of supressing something that could truly hurt them later.

If the guy does that all the time she will of course get mad.

Boring looking, no one has long meaningful conversations...people look me up to "collect" friends but--when the time came to have conversations--the people seem to be very lazy--<br>  The layout was just boring yet--the programs...were not set up to be simple to navigate...<br>  Redundant multiple 'walls' which are basically "comments" with varied categories in lame attempt to make the page look more interesting...which it is not.<br>  I don't give a damn who wrote on whose wall or who commented on what...and I didn't appreciate it being announced if or if not i accepted a friend or who of my friends is now friends with whom...who cares?<br>  ==========<br>  Action--color, movement, lights, video, music boxes, photobucket pix, answering machine, blogs, bulletins, comments...multiple albums with no pic limit...more mature...meaningful discussions, art, work, entertainment, film, politics, and groups--that's what can be found on Myspace.<br>  <br>  Facebook is for those who don't understand myspace because it's too complex.|`|LS2mF8u3aa	Facebook.<br>  <br>  Or porntube.|`|gtINkA19aa	Myspace is the sex haha<br>  www.myspace.com/mylovetragedy<br>  feel free to add :]|`|mNWgzQDOaa	Facebook.<br>  It's just like livejournal vs. xanga...<br>  intellect vs. dramatic pre-teen emo angst|`|OYITN4S2aa	Facebook is all around better then Myspace.|`|XLkrxXOcaa	myspace just more user friendly.|`|E9MF18FRaa	myspace!! <br>  <br>  to keep in touch with old friends|`|901f6618ea3fa1d1b7c9ed4a27d40a3daa	I agree totally with you.  MySpace is a lot easier to understand|`|4iSnuDS9aa	myspace <br>  <br>  love it, but haven't been on it lately in the past month|`|WlFIXJSeaa	It depends on what your looking for.  Myspace is more of a  showboat  which is why it attracts the younger audience.  Facebook, on the other hand, is much less customizable but also a lot more reassuring. The interface is comfy, sturdy, and attractive without being showy—the kind of social network you'd bring home to Mom.  Myspace is also more attracted to the lower income households unlike facebook.    If your looking for women than myspace have a slighter advantage due to its higher percentage of women visiting the site.   Both are even as far as keeping up with old friends though. Either route you choose make the best of it and have fun is really what it's about.|`|fNBGSfnAaa	i hate both far too much spam however if i had to say it would be facebook because it's for people in collage and above or at least it is suppose to be while myspace is the kids table sorta site.|`|fKuvMPCiaa	Facebook before they changed everything, because its less creepy than myspace and you actually know the people who message you (most of the time)|`|dpCsTIEIaa	Myspace....definitely.

I really think it depends on your purpose and age.  I'm 30 and am having a blast finding high school and college classmates and catching up with family.  It seems more basic, organized, real-life and less drama to me.<br>  <br>  My perception of MySpace is more for a younger crowd, more "fun", creative, and a way to connect with your friends and fellow teenagers.<br>  <br>  My 12 year old niece had both and is no longer allowed to use MySpace as she wasn't really being totally herself and her mom thought she was putting herself in danger.  Where on Facebook she is herself, has family on there, and it just feels safer.  Although I know, if done correctly, both can either be safe or unsafe.<br>  <br>  Those are my thoughts:-)  Thanks for asking.|`|kk8ypSTSaa	I like myspace better only b/c you can customize your stuff. However , myspace layouts are messy.... Uneven borders .... etc...  They did do better with the new 2.0 profile but for people who do not know how to center etc etc... Their layout comes out messy . However , the home page is set up a lot better than Facebook, I think. I do like Facebooks crisp lines and more mature look. I think if myspace corrects some of the things they are lacking, it is myspace hands down!! Myspace is more you ! I think myspace should have automatic chat like Facebook. You have to download it for myspace & they do not have a MAC version so MAC users can't chat which in my case SUCKS!! So , Facebook wins that one!!|`|pLcUFBl2aa	I'm never getting a My Space because one time this girl posted pictures of herself and asked ppl what they thought of her.

One of the main qualifications is to have remained active over a twenty plus year period. His career seems to have many gaps where production ground to a halt.

4f8d8369ef1509758bf98e8adc3d5af2aa	god thought if they want  a sex change they would be half way there|`|4IVWMgp7aa	Because men are a genetic malformation of women.  Everyone is conceived female, but develop differently in the womb.   We actually have all the girly parts, but they're malformed, rearranged, and hairy.   Ovaries drop down and become testicles... the clitoris grows into a penis... and breast tissue shrinks into a flat, hairy chest.|`|ff8f1f5e6ae77b2318640fce7787a746aa	OK, God created man and until he created woman he was just gonna let the man produce in auto and the male nipples were going to feed his offspring.

The best explanation I've been able to find (and frankly it doesn't explain very much) is that nipples aren't a sex-linked characteristic. In other words, nipples are just one of those sexually neutral pieces of equipment, like arms or brains, that humans get regardless of sex.<br>  <br>  As you may know, every human being gets a unique set of 23 pairs of chromosomes at conception. These fall into two categories. One pair of chromosomes determines sex--the XX combination means you become female, the XY combination means you become male.<br>  <br>  The other 22 pairs, the non-sex chromosomes (they're called autosomes), supply what we might call the standard equipment that all humans get. These 22 pairs constitute an all-purpose genetic blueprint that in effect is programmed for either maleness or femaleness by the sex chromosomes. The programming is done by the hormones secreted by the sex glands.<br>  <br>  For example, the autosomes give you a voice box, while the sex hormones determine whether it's going to be a deep male voice or a high female voice. Similarly, the autosomes give you nipples, and the sex hormones determine whether said nipples are going to be functioning (in females) or not (in males).<br>  <br>  One interesting consequence of the developmental set-up just described is that during the very early stages of fetal life, before the sex hormones have had a chance to do their stuff, all humans are basically bisexual. Among other things, you have two sets of primitive plumbing--one male, one female. Only one set develops into a mature urogenital system, but you retain traces of the other for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  It's tempting, therefore, to say that male nipples are yet another vestige of your carefree bisexual youth. Trouble is, male nipples are hardly vestigial. They're full-sized and fully equipped with blood vessels, nerves, and all the usual appurtenances of functioning organs. Why this should be so nobody knows--in some other mammals, such as rats and mice, male nipple development is completely suppressed by the male sex hormones. (Incidentally, don't start thinking that at one time our human male ancestors must have suckled their young. So far as anybody knows, male lactation has never developed in any mammalian species.)<br>  <br>  Human nipples appear in the third or fourth week of development, well before the sex characteristics. (The sex hormones start to assert themselves at seven weeks.) As many as seven pairs of nipples are arranged along either side of a "milk line," a ridge of skin that runs from the upper chest to the navel.<br>  <br>  Normally only one pair amounts to anything, but on about one baby in a hundred you can detect some vestige of the other ones, usually on the order of a freckle. There are cases of women who ended up with an extra breast, which made them freak show candidates not so many years ago. Luckily today the women can avail themselves of corrective surgery while the rest of us can watch Jenny Jones.<br>  <br>  Anyway, both male and female babies are born with the main milk ducts intact--the gland that produces milk is there in the male, but it remains undeveloped unless stimulated by the female hormone, estrogen. Occasionally, a male baby is born with enough of his mother's estrogen in his body to produce a bizarre phenomenon known as "witches' milk," with the male glands, suitably stimulated, pumping away at the moment of birth.<br>  <br>  In the adult male, the dormant glands can still be revived by a sufficient dose of estrogen. Actual lactation is rare--only a couple cases have been recorded. But at least one writer (Daly, 1978) has suggested that the "physiological impediments to the evolution of male lactation do not seem individually surmountable." Meaning we may yet see the dawn of the truly liberated household.|`|IP2suWFTaa	Its just an accessory and convenient for me when my boyfriend picks on me I'll reach over and give his nipple a good twisting.|`|G4wDlSh7aa	ever heard of purple nurples?<br>  or texas titty twisters?<br>  lol.<br>  :)|`|UgxF5nxhaa	the same reason girls do i guess.... lol

I just answered this question yesterday. lol. This was my answer.<br>  <br>  <br>  Both.<br>  My dog goes everywhere with us and loves playing and walks. He loves to cuddle and knows when I'm feeling down and cheers me up with a wet sloppy kiss on the cheek.<br>  My cats are affectionate and cuddly as well. They are very funny to watch when they get playful with each other and when I play with them.<br>  <br>  I hate it when people get pets and then get upset because "all they do is lie around".<br>  Cats (and dogs) are not inanimate objects that just lie around. If you stimulate them then they will play or be affectionate with you. If you ignore the animal all the time of course it won't be active or affectionate. People need to be more involved with their pets. They are not knick-knacks.<br>  <br>  Sorry I went off but my neighbor has decided to get rid of his "lazy" cat to get an "active" kitten and it has thrown me into a mood.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your day.|`|weMhsZUNaa	Dogs for sure! <br>  But I also like cats.|`|Up6ANLQeaa	Dogs!!

UY2MJtfGaa	If people really do write the way they type, then we are in a world of hurt when their generation takes over the leadership roles of the nation.  Such intellectual laziness is habit forming and most of them will continue in that manner.|`|0y6sztTwaa	well at my high school i take AP classes and if you do that you will fail...most of the teachers at my school have a "Netiquette" policy that means you submit work properly, no matter how you type on the computer.

We call one "The Shields Gazette" after the local paper, and due to her rude and snobbish attitude about my mother when she moved into the area (because she was divorced) I wouldn't like to tell you what I would like to call the other one.<br>  <br>  Maybe, the reason I don't know who mine is, is because I am the gossip, lol!!|`|NKuQh4sSaa	There are a couple of neighbours that are curtain twitchers , but they will soon get bored of looking at me when me and my kids go past their houses.

211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	The song is about the band aging gracefully. The phrase "Touch Of Grey" is a reference to getting older. For most people, their hair starts getting grey as they age.<br>  <br>  I honestly think this is what the song is about and the lyric, "I will get by" simply continues to address the age issue.  People that are aging get a touch of grey in their hair and will get by on whatever they need to.  Also, the touch of grey could be in reference to how so many people see life as being black or white and Jerry might have wanted us to see the grey areas in between.<br>  <br>  Check out the link below for more facts about the song & The Dead|`|ld1vh7nHaa	it means whatever you want it to mean...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/GDead/AGDL/touc.html" rel="nofollow">http://arts.ucsc.edu/GDead/AGDL/touc.htm...</a>|`|Gk4kNAWsaa	IT MEANS THEY Are all getting older (sorry about all-caps) not one of their best songs, but it is the only one that hit the top-40 for them and one of the only videos for this band as well.<br>  <br>  just getting older, dear.|`|Ho3lRmDMaa	Worst Grateful Dead song ever.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	"Every silver lining has a touch of gray" ...so I would imagine it means that nothing is perfect and everything has its flaws

9GHhc9SBaa	This joke is better when said aloud with all the mimicking but here goes (it mad m laugh so hard though, it's so cute!):<br>  <br>   It's three in the morning, a man and his wife are sleeping. Suddenly someone knocks on the door and forces the husband to get out of bed and go downstairs. He opens the door and asks grumpily what the guy wants. The guy knocking was a drunk and when asked what he needs he replies: ''Come push me, you really need to push me!''<br>  The husband who just wants to get back to bed and is really angry tells the guy to go bother someone who isn't sleeping (etc).<br>  When he gets back in bed his wife tells him off: '' That wasn't very nice, I'm sure that if it had been you, you would have been happy that someone helped you push your car!''. The husband feels guilty and goes back down and calls to the guy: '' Hey man, it's ok I'm gonna push you. Where are you?''<br>  The drunk answers: ''I'm over here, on the swing!''<br>  <br>  Cuuute! Haha|`|QawRIQcJaa	here are two.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Okay there are three men outside.

And god was right there when they woke up.

After that the two guys that were left went waking down the road. Then the second guy spots a penny! He says to himself, No i will not pick this penny up for it will cost me my life.<br>  <br>  So they keep walking. and on the ground is a dollar. He says to himself, "I really want this dollar, but it is not worth it." So they keep walking. <br>  <br>  Then the man see's a Five Dollar bill on the ground. He couldn't help it so he bent over to pick it up and POOF both guys disappear. <br>  <br>  :]<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  There is this boy who one day goes up to his dad while they were in the garage. the boy says "Hey dad i finally had Sex!"<br>  <br>  Dad: "Thats good for You!" and he pulls out a couple of beers to celebrate.

After passing the first 9 tests, the three will face their hardest challenge yet.<br>   The first guy arrives.  The agent hands him a gun and says, "Sir, your wife is sitting in this room.  As a final test of your total loyalty, we want you to go in and shoot her."  The man instantly does a double-take and says, "I-I-I'm sorry, but I can't do that!" The agent replies "Then you are not the man we need."<br>  <br>  The second man is brought outside the same room and given the same task.  With a face full of horror, he enters the room with the gun.  After a long moment of silence, the man comes out of the room crying and gives the gun back and says "I'm sorry. I just can't bring myself to do it." And the Agent replies, "Then you are not the man we need."<br>  <br>  Afterward, the third candidate is brought outside the door, but this time it's a woman.  She is given the same instructions, to shoot her husband.  With a firm hand, she takes the gun and marches into the room.  Suddenly, there is gunfire coming from the room. BANG, BANG, BANG...BANG! Then there is a brief pause, followed by loud noises...grunting, shouting, cussing, banging...and then all falls silent.<br>  The agents are preparing to enter the room when the woman finally emerges, her blouse torn, her forhead dewed with sweat.<br>  <br>  And she says "**** me!  This damn gun was loaded with BLANKS!  I had to beat him to death with the chair!"<br>  <br>  hahaha<br>  Moral: Never underestimate the power of a woman!|`|nX5whEkOaa	this one is good.....ok.....<br>  <br>  there's a man with no arms and no legs and he goes to the house of the girl that he is completely in love with.

Lead singer Mike Shinoda is of Japanese descent but he is an American and they are definitely an American band. Listen to some Fort Minor. Mike Shinoda is the leader of this group too. It's rap but it's sweet. The only rap I will listen to. I don't think you want to be listening to Japanese bands if you like Linkin Park. Just don't do it.

b76781d65df747aaaba9b8c020b060e0aa	This is a really great question! I think my favorite part about a new relationship is the excitment when you feel you meet the right person. The enjoyment in spending time with that person, hanging out, going places. Getting to know them and bonding with them. I guess you can say the honeymoon stage is the best part of a new relationship for me.<br>  <br>  New relationships get your adreneline pumping, You are like in suspense always when the person calls, texts you or comes to pick you up. The sparks are flying all over the place. I love it!! Flirting with them and realizing how wonderful they make you feel.|`|EHQCkDaqaa	Learning all about the other person.. not so much the who what when where.. but the little things that you only learn from being around a person, like what they dont like on their food. little things that bug them, or things that they like. Plus the passion in the beginning of a relationship is always good :)|`|MFWEkkd9aa	When you get butterflies in your tummy just thinking about the other person :)<br>  Anticipation, just waiting for them to be with you.  If you get it right, that feeling never goes away and that is love.<br>  <br>  Take care you, Lulu x|`|L0o5OJp2aa	Those indescribably good fizzles of excitement when you think about spending time with that person. The joy of the simplest kisses and touches like holding hands. Mmm... makes me smile just thinking about it.|`|M1B1EvI7aa	hmm the way they come and hold you form behind =]<br>  i im in a new relationship right now<br>  the kisses ^^<br>  the sweet cute things he does ^^|`|64cUxJn1aa	The fluttery stomach.

You did follow the neccessary procedure and steal as many pens and staplers and copper wiring and people's dental fillings and their cars and wallets and set fire to the building, all the while laughing and pointing and saying, "I'd told you I'd do it, but you didn't believe me, why didn't you believe me!?"<br>  <br>  As for bad karma, don't worry.

XIRqDfUpaa	Yes I agree.<br>  <br>  Conversation is often guarded.  Most people when talking tend to make it a show.  They will act in a manner that will give them the appearance of authority, and often conversation is not about winning or losing, but about proving a point, or gaining information.  Having said that, fearing that you may give out too much information, one may hold back.  <br>  <br>  But when people are at play they tend to drop their guard, and act in a more natural manner.  Facial expressions become spontaneous and honest.  <br>  <br>  Games are most often about winning or losing something.  How someone goes about winning the contest is a very good measure of a person.  Will you cheat, or lie to gain the upper hand?  Furthermore, it is true that success is less a measure of a man than failure.<br>  <br>  It is easy to be gracious when you have won, and far more difficult when you have lost.<br>  <br>  There is another important quote: "Don't tell me what you are made of, show me."<br>  <br>  Yes, play can tell you much more about a person than talk.|`|jfOSVSQkaa	Yes|`|1RFf8nQeaa	Of course i so agree with that.....|`|7nRom97Daa	yes|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	I agree. When someone is playing, or enjoying themselves, their true colors come out.|`|Li9oemwqaa	Yeah, because when you play people play to compete and i think true feeling are revealed when you are distracted by something else e.g a game

fh8bQdGkaa	it was a great band, but it's way too over-rated. a lot of kids only heard about SOAD after their album "Hypnotize" was released, and B.Y.O.B was played on every god damn radio station, thousands of times a day until it was jammed in teen heads that they should play it at every house party they should ever organize.

ivqfhzHXaa	to be honest with u, with the things u have provided i think it's to vague to give it a title... but maybe since it's a love story which has to overcome quite the obstacles as it seems... u could name it "the love story of _____ and ______" or since it's a fictional world, u could give it a name to that world and give a good explanation and a lil bit of a history of that world... and the title would be the name of that world...<br>  or u could maybe name it the name of the main character. <br>  <br>  by the way i really love those kinda stuff the vampires, werewolves angels and what not... so could u please e-mail me and tell me if u r going to have it up on some website like onemanga.com or mangafox.com cuz it seems pretty interesting, i would love to read it!!!<br>  <br>  anyways, i wish u the best of luck, and ur idea sounds pretty interesting and original so i wish u success!!|`|trMsK86jaa	You intend to work this?<br>  <br>  I refuse to give you a title, it's your own work and i wouldn't want to take that away from you.|`|L7ongbylaa	lmao idk<br>  <br>  but kyuubis r not an animal his demon is jus called kyuubi, its actually jus a freggin nin tailed fox which is once again an mythical animal in chinese/japenese? folkstorys|`|hAo1GmZaaa	i like the story but i dont like that there are sooo many different types of creatures... u should stick with different animals...<br>  u should name it torn or something

BNwfnFgcaa	they are both equally good bands but its hard to compare them by 'who's better.' if you are speaking skill-wise, a day to remember is no where near as technical as tdwp. but if we are talking sound-wise, adtr is a very consistent band that blends a lot pop punk, post hardcore, and even have some elements of metal to them; whereas, tdwp is strictly what i would consider as a post hardcore band that they themselves define as metalcore that have somewhat repetitive sounding songs but it can also be pointed out that adtr has a stale writing style, but this is backed up by the fact that they use punk as the main source for their song structures. so in the end, they both are about equal. in one way or the other, they outweigh each other at something different. oh, and they are both great live. although adtr's energy is a bit lacking in comparison to tdwp's, but adtr makes up for this by having VERY consistent live vocals compared to their recordings. tdwp have sometimes gotten a bit lazy at their vocals, but hey who doesn't get tired?|`|lkPYYLiKaa	the devil wears prada.<br>  <br>  i've never heard of the other one|`|weMhsZUNaa	The Devil Wears Prada|`|0b3fa313a09fd3b8730664822eb4455baa	THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA! <br>  <br>  ...but ADTR has a lot of great songs too...

eEgyo9rFaa	In the past, not necessarily with oboes, but with other instruments, Jupiter has not been trustworthy...your tone is off, and you don't sound as good.  But other than that, the fact that you can actually play the oboe and will take care of it, you can go with any oboe.  But if you're not going to stick with the oboe, keep the one you have now.  They're very expensive (because they are hand-crafted).  Every one is different.

DtkLsetkaa	The teams were assigned trainers basically on the flip of a coin.  The green team won the challenge (because Tara is AWESOME) and got to choose their trainer, so they went with Jillian.  The blue team who was originally with bob went to Jillian too, along with the lady from the pink team and the young guy from the brown team.  The rest went with bob.  So Bob was very emotional and got really upset.  I only caught the first half so that's all I know for now, but its no longer colored teams either, its black vs blue now.|`|Leda2ha0aa	Kia is correct with her answer.  Bob was upset because his teams were no longer with him.  It's hard to work with someone so closely and then have to break ties with them and start looking at them as the "competition".  Jillian, on the other hand, seemed to take it very well and became the trainer immediately and got over it.  The weigh in is tonight.|`|AA11429880	Everyone except the ones who won the pop up challenge had to switch trainers.  Everyone was all upset about it.

I hit the front part of the mirror on the wall but the back part popped off. I freaked out and pulled back into the garage and ended up running over the piece I had broken off and shattering it. But the good thing is that the actual mirror is fine & she has yet to notice.  :)|`|eiSaaLxUaa	no but as a pedestrian i often push peoples wing mirrors in when they park on the kerb with no consideration for people who want to walk past. if i push too hard and wing mirror breaks, tough, serves them right!|`|WvtMU3Lsaa	yes on the road passing another car.|`|tm8FcNGlaa	no but ive smashed them on other peoples cars|`|5HECRgcMaa	NO not me but my mom did it backing out of the garage|`|lfamfJhUaa	my first time going through a drive through|`|4kX61Y97aa	i did it to my boyfriends car and my moms its weird the wont let me drive there cars again lol  my boyfriends a lamp post ran into me and my moms the wall moved over on purpose they wasn't impressed still feel bad about it
u4liwDhAaa	Cheers hands down!  That was a classy show.|`|50ab85f362cbbddab47844295a4bba7caa	Between Seinfeld and Cheers I would have to say that I liked Seinfeld better. It could just be that I was a little older when that was on, so I understood it more. I still enjoying watching the reruns.<br>  <br>  I've never seen Curb Your Enthusiasm|`|UY2MJtfGaa	Seinfeld -- it's the only comedy I've watched that kept political correctness to a minimum.<br>  <br>  I didn't really care for Cheers and I've never heard of Curb Your Enthusiasm.|`|a950da063e9c670dfa13b1fd89d288ddaa	Seinfeld. <br>  Cheers is a little old for me and I don't have nor want the cable channel Curb Your Enthusiasm is on.|`|53WL6akOaa	It's a hard decision between Seinfeld and Cheers. I'll have to go with...Cheers.|`|ACc1skbPaa	Cheers!!!  Not pretentious or gimicky--I live in the Northeast so I love the Boston connection, but it could work in any bar in America--we all know a Cliff Claven!!!|`|Ns5miQQmaa	I have seen every episode of Cheers.  Im from Boston so its more than manditory...I could never relate to Seinfeld.  Curb You Enthusiasm is really funny but ive only seen a couple episodes|`|szNnEDvgaa	seinfeld|`|a745322b92770fa14e810733a8030534aa	I liked Seinfeld.
6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	Loved the Sopranos and continue to watch Law & Order.|`|3ca554b994e514508242f36d37077a74aa	It's funny, I don't really consider LOST a drama, more of an action/adventure show. So my choice is Law and Order. I would say that SVU is my favorite. Gotta love Mariska Hargitay, Ice-T, and Chris Meloni.|`|HTitV7Plaa	Sopranos|`|DUg1IkTIaa	LOST gets my vote.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	The Sopranos..|`|ZPeXA9CQaa	Law and Order.<br>  <br>  The others are rubbish.|`|152b3a8ec4e56ae376c7fcca43292d4daa	LAW & ORDER|`|EGna1nEfaa	I personally prefer Lost- can't stand to watch the other two.|`|tEpR9kr1aa	Law and Order <br>  SVU is the best!!!|`|HHniTZTbaa	law&order|`|53WL6akOaa	Lost!!!|`|W4ydOMYjaa	lost...|`|szNnEDvgaa	sopranos|`|d2RV8HTmaa	LOST...definitely.<br>  <br>  I always loved Law and Order SVU, but Lost wins!|`|u4liwDhAaa	Oh this is hard.....  It's 50% Law & Order and 50% Lost.  The Sopranos wasn't a big turn on due to the language.  I'm weird but I think ppl can have an intelligent conversation without all the foul language.  I'm half Italian and somewhat resented the way the show portrayed Italians!

We have everything in common together so I'd say we are exactly the same and I don't mind it.

1356ce82bb96a07d5c301bab5e73ccb3aa	try watching the movie, but i'll answer your question anyhow, no one dies in the whole movie. his wife is already dead when the movie opens. i think the movie was great, best next to the first i think.|`|293976269c449191c866d0d512c1f924aa	His Wife!|`|8fb9684ea6626a83ebf1f7acd61d9b06aa	Hopefully it was Rocky himself!!
2e03d9c0ae13a3d9eea4f64e4eb3a52aaa	Why do I get down on all fours on the floor to play with my dog? He slowed down to interact with humans because it was interesting. Do humans run all the time? No, we're quite capable of running but often walk or even just sit around.<br>  <br>  He aged simply by altering the shape of his outer "skin." Piece of cake. Coloring the hair would be easy, too.<br>  <br>  He obviously breathed because the actor playing him needed to breathe but, if you want a Star Trek answer, he was programmed to simulate breathing (the in/out movement of his chest) but actually was nto breathing.<br>  <br>  I never gave much thought to how he got rid of what he ate and drank but maybe a little furnace inside him just burned/incinerated it all later or maybe he ahs a little trash bag like a colostomy bag somewhere that he has to remove and discard.<br>  <br>  Noonian Soong or whatever his name was that invented Data was an eccentric genius. They didn't fully explain his power source or anything else that was intersting because, after all, it was just a dumb show. <br>  <br>  As for the storage issue, yeah, whatever. Maybe you just thought they said 100,000 "terabytes" but you heard "terabytes" because it's a term we use. Maybe they meant "tarebytes" which is a term not yet invented and much higher than "terabytes." Maybe the writers just lacked imagination and plugged in "100,000 terabytes" because it was an easy term for them to come up with. It's fiction, not reality and nobody really cares.|`|ba52jQHyaa	Remember that Data's creator wanted him to appear human.  The blinking of his eyes was governed by a Fourier series, to simulate randomness. Regarding breathing Data said "I do have a functional respiration system. However, its purpose is to maintain thermal control of my internal systems. I am, in fact, capable of functioning for extended periods in a vacuum."<br>  <br>  Data could move faster than humans but when interacting with humans that would be kind of rude.  He did think faster and did mover faster when the need was there (as in TNG:The Naked Time at the end when he was putting the computer chips back).  Data wanted to be as close to human as possible, so for the most part he moved like we do.<br>  <br>  Attempts were made to recreate another Data type brain, but none were successful.  Including Data's child that he built.<br>  <br>  Maybe the 100,000 terabytes is like RAM memory or what fits is his positronic net, then he would have additional storage that he could access.  There are time when we see him pause to find info in his memory, kind of like archiving.<br>  <br>  I think he did say once what type of power source he has, but I can't remember right now.  In "Insurrection" he said "My power cells continually recharge themselves."<br>  <br>  What happened to the food and drink that Data consumed?  Well, keep in mind that in 10 star Trek movies and over 700 TV episodes we never see anyone go to the bathroom. We never even see a toilet  That must just be one of those great mysteries of the future.

UlME0etLaa	Yes! I think  they are Very suicidal! I have alot in my area mostly in the neighborhood. Where they run across the street part way...stop in the middle...you come, lurch to a halt and wait....then start to go, and then run back and forth....one did that to me...wasn't cute...not at all! <br>  <br>  Tx.|`|4IFXHz80aa	No squirrels are not suicidal in my area; however, rabbits are. every time i drive at night or early dawn, they run right in front of my car. its like theyre waiting for someone to pass and once they see the lights, they run. unfortunately, and this is kinda sad, ive experienced this way too often and have killed way too many that i no longer have much feeling about it anymore. its now a normal thing to have a rabbit run in front of my car and possibly get killed. it doesnt faze me.|`|Wr3l34EUaa	I live in New York and yeah, a lot of the squirrels are, once I was in school and the window was right near the roof of the building and it decided to just jump off. It was funny, but sad at the same time. They also like to jump in front of the cars even when they see a car coming. The birds here a sometimes suicidal too, they like to just run into the school's windows.. O.o|`|d33ff6b12876ab19368e1b44c245857caa	not the squirrels, they seem to have crossing the street figured out...but the RABBITS...they are a whole different story...they JUMP into your car! not cool...and the doves here are stupid like that too...they wait until the very very last moment and then try to fly...ugh...<br>  <br>  <br>  also...I have always wondered where the squirrels came from in my area...the trees here were all brought in...Southeast New Mexico...aka desert.|`|AA10808686	No.<br>  I live in Connecticut and our squirrels like to get killed. O_O<br>  It is like, so gross because once I see a flattened squirrel, I move across to the other side of the street. :P|`|fe4a7c5e36d28eb34ebcf6d49980a6faaa	They're just stupid. They go on vibrations from the car to tell them how close you are and which way to go. But they get confused I think. This is why I come to a complete stop if I can until it decideds what the hell its doing lol.<br>  <br>  Lower NY here|`|cnulCeFaaa	No not here.|`|AA10142515	I think they are in my area. I live in Northeast Florida and the dang squirrels keep coming into my yard knowing those kids next door will shoot the poor little guys with the pellet gun they got for Christmas. I hate that they get shot in MY yard. Police won't do anything about it because they say I cannot prove that it was the neighbourhood brats!
lpznO5Inaa	Yeah. Would you get them at the DMV or could you get them from Wal-Mart or Target.|`|0d85582d7671f3804556de3575f8fe34aa	That's fcking ridiculous that she has 14 kids but on welfare, what makes her so special. There's people out there who needs welfare for their children and they can't get it, but this blown out lady can get it? I don't care if she has 14 children, shouldn't had that many.|`|J9sJz46Eaa	Not like a license, but more like a economical review of their living situation in order to get an evaluation on how many kids they can bring into the world without affecting the government in this case other people's pockets for the welfare this lady is receiving.|`|cdpy5iv5aa	I think your right, you need a license to get married, you should need to take a test to see if your fit to raise children.|`|YX1ddnXmaa	It makes me want to throw up, California is laying off thousands and these pathetic people still get paid for making babies, ridiculous.|`|hgyiS7Glaa	CPS may not alow the hospital to release those kids to her..Either way CA. will support these kids ,Say Thanks American tax payer......|`|Ecx8SQM3aa	People do crazy things for their 15 minutes of fame!!! You know she had some plastic surgery too. I can't stand when people are selfish like that. License thing maybe it would be a great idea but will never happen|`|AA11523465	I thought about that too, years ago.|`|Hn8XZiXraa	yeah, actually that really does make sense. but some people say that since it's your own body that it shouldn't matter if theres a license or not. but it doesn't make any sense because if you're gonna actually give birth than you don't have to do anything but have sex but if you're gonna adopt there are like a million questions and stupid things like that.<br>  <br>  anyway...|`|Vt4qUSA3aa	fish you take home clean them and eat them....not the same as kids and getting a license to have them....<br>  <br>  why would u wanna take a basic right and make it possibly hard for the rest of the normal people/potential parents out there?|`|AA12032352	Did you hear about the new breakfast at Denny's?<br>  <br>  The Suleman Slam.<br>         14 eggs, no sausage, and the guy next to you has to pay for it!|`|13b0ee2df2675456a4d60accfb6c703faa	I concur with Leroy.....|`|AORcLwTNaa	she had too many kids|`|92iuiuZKaa	LOL. No but some people need to think more logically and use common sense!|`|AA11784965	Wow - lotsa good comments! I concur with you, Whipper - it seems logical to me that SOMEBODY shoulda at least checked her & her living/financial status before they put 8 more babies in her!! Really, it's ridiculous - she had NO business being on welfare & having more kids period - much less EIGHT!!!<br>  <br>  And Rushevents, dear - seven figures notwithstanding, she WAS on the dole BEFORE she was impregnated, no? So what was this, a publicity stunt? Hmmmm? Do you REALLY think this woman can give ALL 14 of her children the attention they deserve, being a single parent?

I think the doctor that did the invetro fertilization should have to pay to raise those kids.|`|M7W7lZBBaa	I think that anyone going for invitro should be required by law to only have a certain amount of children. Women like her are a drain on our society.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, all people should have mandatory child care classes before giving birth.

Later Wilson arrives and comes in to find House on the floor vomiting from a combination of the alcohol and the new painkillers.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tv.com/house/merry-little-christmas/episode/888757/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;10" rel="nofollow">http://www.tv.com/house/merry-little-chr...</a>
AA10835427	Macho went and talked to Mr. Bentley, he told him he felt violated and that A Felon disrespected him by assuming he was gay.  He also told him that A.D. had a part in it too.  Bentley told Macho to go get them both.  A Felon admitted that he went about the whole confrontation wrong, but A.D. denied doing anything and placed total blame on A Felon.  In the end, Bentley says that Macho can continue on, but told him if he get's one more strike he's out.  A Felon & A.D. both get the boot.  Jo-Jo also gets cut for his drunkiness.|`|uoMoDCdXaa	Macho went to talk to Mr. Bentley then he called in A-Felon and A.D. Jojo voted himself. Then Mr. Bentley eliminated both A-Felon & A.D<br>  <br>  Too bad.. A-Felon is so hott xD|`|cYmIMtGOaa	honestly i didnt know it was on but watch it tonight|`|AA10958272	I saw it.. and what it showed was that Felon was a complete phony.  He could NOT rap at all -- and if he could even in the least bit, his squad would have WON the contest outright!! He couldn't handle defeat or understand he'd been exposed, as an awful "G". He repeats "where I come from" so much, that's I'd BET he's from a nice suburban family. (Anyone who "knows" -- just shows it, and they don't say it.)  After all, Long Island is no one's idea of a ghetto hotbed. It's not Compton. It's not upper Harlem.  There's NO projects anywhere on Long Island.  And it's not Coney island or Pitkin Ave. in Brooklyn, either. I wonder what town he's from.<br>  <br>  Anyway, he reacted.. and tried to blame the little tattoo'd guy (funny that he's named Macho, maybe because of Macho Comacho the old latino boxer?) who'd stuck out his tongue, while Felon was on-stage. He called him "gay" etc. in front of other housemates, and it worked on some level.. but, in the end, it didn't play well -- as far as "gentlemenly behavor" goes. Of course. <br>  <br>  You know who's out, from reading these other posts that preceeded me. But, you know now.. that in my perspective, that Felon was a Stone Cold Fony.

oVxr5B3Eaa	I've only ever had one vehicle, and it was freakin' ugly but it got me through. It was an 89' chevy astro... The classic two tone blue that everyone has seen. It was headed for the junk yard in about '07 so we donated it to a high school so their auto dept. could do whatever with it.. They gave us 500 bucks and fixed it up. When they were done, they called us and asked if we'd like to buy it back for 300. My dad didn't want it as he had a new, so I bought it. All new parts, I mean EVERYTHING had been replaced by the school's auto department. <br>  It was missing a seat in the back so it was great to drive to parties and then sleep in the back. It could hold a cooler, and it was a piece of crap so I could do whatever I wanted with it. The empty space was right beside the sliding door so people used to sit there and open the door when I was driving (slowly, of course, haha).... my mom used to borrow it to go to work on fridays because she didn't have a car. <br>  The paint started to flake off the roof and she told me she was going to paint the roof to stop it from rusting.. She worked a paint shop so I figured she'd be smart enough to get automotive spray paint in an appropriate shade of blue .. I came home one day to her painting the roof of my van WHITE with a PAINT ROLLER and HOUSE PAINT. It was SO embarrassing. We called it the white top after that. I didn't want to spend the money on floor mats so my dad carpeted for me in some salvaged 70's carpet from a room in our house (VERY 70s i might add)... <br>  <br>  That van was spectacular. <br>  <br>  My mom decided she needed to use it every day to drive my brother to school and to run errands and go to work and she basically took it from me. She couldn't afford it (she only worked 4 hours a week), so I got stuck paying for insurance, gas, and repairs, even though I wasn't allowed to use it. I'm still paying for it, and I haven't had it since I moved to school in June 07. I need a car BADLY as I work 6am-6pm with an hour commute on the bus and sports as well so I'm only home about 4 hours a day. I'm trying to convince my parent's that I want my F****** van back but they seem to think my mom needs it more even though I'm paying for it. <br>  <br>  *sigh*|`|paerqxfMaa	1968 Camaro - customized - flared wheel wells, chrome exhaust, candy apple red and persimmon - took 2nd place in the NY Custom Car Show for street-driven vehicles back in the early 70's.|`|4YnoykD2aa	1981 Camaro.

AA11401988	Cut down on sugar. Make time for yourself to do things that you like. Don't overload yourself with things that you have to do. Learn to say "no."

c026f214ce25aaca881d2aff949cfcdcaa	There really aren't any other films that can compare with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy in the sword and sorcery genre. <br>  <br>  But my second favorite would be Excalibur (1981), directed by John Boorman. The complete version of the film runs 140 minutes. It is a bit on the erotic side, but it is the best retelling of the King Arthur legend that I've seen. <br>  <br>  Another film would be Dragonslayer (1981), directed by Matthew Robbins. The special effects have held up remarkably well, and the film has an <br>  effectively dark tone.<br>  <br>  I also enjoyed The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe (2005), directed by Andrew Adamson.|`|9a6a488bbd91d84fc00565d50a529eb4aa	ummm...no!<br>  <br>  I LOVE PIRATES! ;)|`|09a4321ebd94fc1f04dc6be9944836ceaa	Braveheart, though it's not a fantasy film. Watch it and see what I mean. It resembles that historical epic war genre. It's seriously a very touching and dramatic piece of filmmaking, but it's very action-orientated and very bloody, too.<br>  <br>  One of my favourite films.|`|637c57357b89a346a7b2f3393476a5ecaa	Narnia|`|AA10728293	Lord of the Ring is unique. There is nothing like it I'm afraid.. <br>  Unless someone is making a film from Robin Hobb's Farseer trilogy..<br>  But you could try these old classics:<br>  <br>  Willow<br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096446/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096446/</a><br>  <br>  Legend<br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089469/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089469/</a><br>  <br>  And if you want to slip a bit to the SciFi scene.. <br>  <br>  Frank Herbert's Dune    (a true Interstellar saga)<br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142032/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142032/</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps..|`|AA11939076	Ther`s literally nothing like the Lord of the Rings... if youre looking for something like that in scope, battles and humanity, Braveheart would be a good option...|`|bfd34570ba9a17ad35aab952678e1f1caa	I think Willow was a great call.  It's definately a classic, and I think a movie that is easily lost/forgotten with a lot of people... especially with the younger crowd.
AA11151199	I love that show! I never missed an episode. I agree with you. It sucks that it only shows once a week. If you miss an episode, it's hard to find it again, but there's always youtube and the season dvd. Well, at least the show wasn't canceled when cw took over. <br>  So far the shows have been interesting. Veronica's in college and the plot seems different. Logan and Veronica is together again! Yay! Hopefully, they won't split apart again. I'm sure Rob Thomas will make a love triangle between Veronica, Logan, and Piz because the show would be boring without it. :[|`|14aa50e1d3c13e04f3cc3c904709c13daa	As long as I get to watch it, I don't care what network it is on.

There choices may be wrong, but again, they are their own choices & that's better than not having them at all.

p7yaM0qiaa	my own opinion is that this other girl is a rebound and a way to throw something in your face, a " well you initiated the separation so here's what im gonna do". You need to tell him that he cant have his cake and eat it too. that he needs to be able to accept his part in the seperation and start taking an active part in the reconcillation. i dont know if you and your husband are christians or not. i am and i can only tell you my opinion and what it says in the bible. a husband should lover, honor, cherish and cling to his wife and a the same for the wife to the husband. i strongly suggest that the both of you read mathew and get into marriage counseling with either your paster or a local paster that you trust.|`|aHlpWFVhaa	Because your husband is a jerk.|`|ogs0AZA3aa	Actions speak louder then words in my book!|`|Vt4qUSA3aa	divorce that @sshole...and move on..find yourself a young, rebound guy...|`|FvpktkB8aa	don't be a fool!  let the worthless jerk go.|`|ZWp23ujeaa	Sounds like he's playing games with you.

It also doesn't take much to make a woman feel good and put her in a good mood, a compliment, a card, they just don't get it.  <br>  My boyfriend called me on the cell phone as I was coming home from work and said he was making dinner (which he usu didn't do) and ask what I wanted to drink.  I walked in and he had flowers and candles on the table.  He handed me my drink, told me to stay out of the kitchen.  When dinner was ready I sat down at the table and he served TV dinners.  Hey, we LOAO and it was great because I didn't have to cook or do dishes and we had plenty of time for other things................|`|AA11689110	So true!

b7eedea764d7b30daa102b9e63137ed3aa	I think it's played like this....<br>  <br>  1) Any member of the crew can be challenged.<br>  2) They are each given a cup and 5 die. (they wager, how many years service they offer Davy Jones).<br>  3) They cast the die and keep them covered underneath the cup from each other.<br>  4) They then takes turns in placing bets off how many die have a certain number on.<br>  5) After about 3-4 rounds the cups are taken off the die and they see who is correct.<br>  6) The person/people who lose the bet are the ones to take the wager they placed at the start of the game.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!! ;)|`|9a6a488bbd91d84fc00565d50a529eb4aa	this game was made for the movie and it's called Pirate's Dice. but it is similar to the game of Liar's Dice only with simplified rules. <br>  the sites provided explain it with more detail!<br>  <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/45..." rel="nofollow">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/45...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_18464_play-liars..." rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_18464_play-liars...</a><br>  <br>  here's the actual game that you can play online:<br>  <a href="http://adisney.go.com/disneypictures/pir..." rel="nofollow">http://adisney.go.com/disneypictures/pir...</a><br>  i've gotten rather good at it.

You bet on what numbers not only what your dice say, but everybody else's too. When Will Turner betted four fives, he was right, and Davy Jones betted again for seven fives, because he knew there wouldn't be seven fives. It's kinda confusing, but watch that scene over and over, and eventually you get it. They probably have instructions on the Web on how to play it.|`|5eaad8a838b5906ad84659f496c62cd8aa	You bid on the total of any one number. Somebody ups the bid or calls you a liar to make everyone lift their cups to prove that you are or vindicate you. In Dead Man's Chest, filmmakers decided it would be more dramatic for Davy Jones to call Bootstrap a liar BEFORE they lifted the cup.|`|fff943e5d23e346156089b00d36419edaa	Basically, it’s a complete guessing game.<br>  <br>  Everyone has a cup of five die and they shake and throw them down. They all then place a wager. Then, by only looking at their own die, they take turns making a guess (a “bid”) as to how many of a certain die are on the table (ex: three 2s, four 5s, six 1s, so on and so forth). Next, they go around upping the bids (three 2s now is raised to four 2s, or six 1s changed to six 4s). <br>  <br>  If player “A” thinks that player “B” has said a possible bid that is too high, “A” calls “B” out and all the players lift their cups. If the number on the table is equal or greater than the challenged bid, then the person who guessed the bid losses (if the player is called out on saying five 2s and there are five or more 2s, then he losses, but if he is lower, than the challenger losses).

I hope you have at least a little skill at it.  Personally, I never joined anything because it would look good.  I did get Richard Russo to come to my Honors Lit class because we read one of his books.  I didn't do it for my transcript, though.  That's just silly.  It's like, "I kissed my girlfriend in public so people knew we were dating, not because I wanted to."

Atreyu is not goth.<br>  <br>  Of course, many goths also enjoy other genres of music, including, synthpop, futurpop, industrial, and many others.  The cr@p part of it all is that this new breed of corporate music that some dumb kids are calling goth is NOT goth.  It is a bastardised version of metal.  Hell, even the headbangers won't call it metal.  It's cr@p.  The new rubbish they call punk is NOT punk, it is cr@p.  Hell, nu-metal, real metalheads can smell the corporate sellout.<br>  <br>  What do I listen to?  I'll name some artists, you can do the research and figure out if they fit into your definition of "goth music."  The Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Ex-Voto, Joy Division, New Order, Alien Sex Fiend, Combichrist, Bahaus, VNV Nation, God Module, Frontline Assembly, :Wumpscut:...and many others.

This is starting to make me take the attitude that if they are that lazy(that means that they don't really care about their issue or question to begin with)why should I waste my time giving thoughtful input to someone who can't be bothered to give all the details & doesn't really even care anyways! <br>  <br>  --Plus, people like this are more prone to give the 'best answer' to someone who tells them what they want to hear versus someone who tells them the truth.|`|AA10414527	Ya, it does bothers me too, so I usually try and edit my answer.<br>  What really bugs me, is when you have given an educated , thoughtful answer, the person who asked the question picks an answer that is just random nonsense and has little or nothing to do with the question asked.They picked it because it was funny.|`|4WCLWhaTaa	I'm more of a fire and forget answerer...I won't likely see a question again after I answer it...|`|Ecx8SQM3aa	yes I agree.

There's 6 and it's about a teenage witch (who's really bad at magic) who comes to a human high school. Contains romance and it is SO cute!!! seriously, I really recommend reading this!!<br>  <br>  Vampire Knight - This is kinda gory in places (not really, but just a warning in case you don't like that kind of stuff) but it's a really good story. It's amazing as an anime as well. I think the anime is actually better than the manga because it's more dramatic but the books are awesome too! Contains romance, action and it is so DAMN GOOD!! seriously, watch/buy this!! <3 <br>  <br>  Fruits basket - I LOVE THIS!!!!! Reeeeally cute! Tohru is the cutest, most innocent character ever! Lots of adorable romance! ^ ^<br>  <br>  I.O.N - This is really cute! It's just a one off, not a series but I definitely recomend this! About a girl who finds she has natural physcic powers. She falls for this boy but is worried he sees her only as a physcic and not as a girl.... really cute read! ^ ^<br>  <br>  The gentlemens alliance - Haven't actually read this but I've heard great reviews on it. I've heard it's REALLY good! =]<br>  <br>  I recommend looking here, there's a really good list of books to read:<br>  <a href="http://www.shojobeat.com/manga/sb_vols.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.shojobeat.com/manga/sb_vols.p...</a>

He was always asking stupid questions and other people took him really seriously! He was absolutely clueless about "political correctness" in American society and said all kinds of outrageous things. And that naked fighting scene with the 300 pound man and running through the hotel like that! Hilarious!! Or how about the scene when he thought that sweet, old Jewish couple had turned into cockroaches? How dumb can you get?? I loved this movie.|`|6c8f7169075cda44362fe00b907ef3f0aa	I honestly did not want to see this movie because I thought it would be stupid funny, which is annoying. But then I saw Borat.

y0uTByS1aa	Well what it all comes down to is, if you recall the case Brown vs. Board of Education, the movie is Komodo. In the movie, the komodo dragon eats the dog, which you seem to have tragically mistaken for a boy burning his dog (you are an awful person). Also the porno that you recall is actually when the guy walks into the room and finds the girl being dragged through a whole in the house with her stomach essentially ripped up and gushing (which makes you an idiot for thinking that is porn.) The notebook you are thinking of is really the front door that the dogs scratches at before he is devoured and Darcy ran away crying because she was scared, and Corey and I laughed because the dog was a puppet. So what you are going to want to do is send the truck right down Pennsylvania Ave to Senator Obama's door and he will surely tend to agree with the divine opinion like such as mine.|`|na8ObA5Haa	Butterfly effect <br>  <br>  <br>  (Horrible movie)|`|RWYMy7jOaa	The butterfly effect<br>  <br>  :)|`|NV6nso5zaa	Atticus, that's the Bunny Rabbit Effect by J.K.

You had some small mistakes in the story line though: the guy doesn't loose his memory, he looses his job, he didn't write down everything in his notebook, he would tell everything to his refrigerator, he found the fridge, not the notebook, he didn't read the notebook, he got a salad out of the refrigerator, and he didn't like a girl, he liked his male refrigerator, and the he burned the candle, not his dog, and it wasn't a babysitter he had when he was little, it was a refigerator he had when he was little, and he was not mad at the fridge, he was pleased with it because it kept his refreshments cold, and they didn't make a porno, the made a cake and put it in the fridge.|`|GZnOE7oXaa	The Butterfly Effect with Ashton Kutcher<br>  <br>  A young man blocks out harmful memories of significant events of his life.

AA12296959	Yes dear, it is. The whole album, The Black Parade, in fact is revolved around "The Patient" who is a cancer patient. Each song has something to do with him and bad things happening to his life. The new song, Welcome To The Black Parade, is about how his dad taking him to see a marching band was his biggest childhood memory. I know it's very sad. Also the reason for Gerard Way's new hair is to give the illusion that he went through chemotherapy like a candcer patient. It's basically a symbol.|`|4ad5e88f50cc44a4d99583c32683ad86aa	Yes . The whole album is about someone suffering from cancer|`|6a591937efade07188b98cb1da73b70baa	well it's about the death of a man and when he dies death comes to him in the form of a parade so sure it may not be MENT to be depressing but it dose give the dark feeling off.On the new CD The Black Parade there is 1 song (#8) called Cancer that think is supposed to be sad.But it's a awesome song none-the-less

u5eHNj0taa	DC Shoes is an American based footwear company in Vista, CA founded in 1993 who specialize in producing shoes for skateboarding as well as snowboarding boots and outerwear. On March 10, 2004, DC Shoes was acquired by Quiksilver.<br>  <br>  DC Shoes was created by two main owners, Ken Block and Damon Way, older brother of professional skateboarder Danny Way. A few years later, the two hired an accountant by the name of Clayton Blehm, who had just lost his job a few months earlier and was living in his daughter's garage. He was later given the chance to own one third of the company, yet he refused the offer, only to reconsider two years later. He has since been dismissed from the company which resulted in a lawsuit for wrongful dismissal and a counter-suit by DC, which has since been settled.<br>  <br>  The company was originally called "Eightball" and only made T-shirts for skate shops. The owners were sent a cease and desist letter by a man in Seattle who had allegedly already copyrighted the name "Eightball." The man had made an offer to allow them to use the name "Eightball" if they had given him a large sum of money and a cut of the action. The newly hired Clay Blehm refused the offer, and they began to look for another name. The owners then created a new line of clothing called Droors Clothing, in which they create ads spoofing famous ads ranging from Calvin Klein to famous rapper's CD covers. Famous rap and hip-hop groups "Cypress Hill" and "The Beastie Boys" sported their clothing. DC originally stood for Droors Clothing Footwear, but since the sale of Droors (which is now defunct), DC no longer has any ties to Droors and is simply DC Shoes.<br>  <br>  The three owners then created new sub companies like Dub Snowboard Clothing, which sported an urban feel that lead to them being extremely popular with the hip-hop subculture. The company also published Blunt Snowboard Magazine which mainly featured ads of new, small and independent companies. Blunt was eventually sold to Big Brother Magazine, and later ceased publication.<br>  <br>  DC Shoes manufactures footwear for all types of extreme sports, including skateboarding, snowboarding, BMX, motocross, and surfing, for men, women, kids, and toddlers.<br>  <br>  They have released a video, entitled "The DC Video" which featured a part by Danny Way in which he skates the DC "Mega Ramp," a series of enormous skateboarding ramps. It has been released on VHS, DVD, and UMD for PSP.<br>  <br>  DC recently sponsored the world's first skate plaza, which was built in Kettering, Ohio. The skate plaza, a dream of Rob Dyrdek, is billed as the first skate park for street skateboarders.
h1IYS0dbaa	Buddy Bolden (1877-1931) is generally considered to be the first bandleader to play the improvised music which later became know as Jazz. He was the first "King" of cornet in New Orleans, and is remembered by the musicians of that time period as one of the finest horn players they had ever heard. He is remembered for his loud, clear tone. His band starting playing around 1895, in New Orleans parades and dances, and eventually rose to become one of the most popular bands in the city. In 1907 his health deteriorated and he was committed to a mental institution where he spent the remainder of his life.<br>  <br>  So, the answer to your question would be around 1895.<br>  <br>  The first jazz recordings were made in 1917. Let's be more precise.  the record "Livery Stable Blues", coupled with "Dixie Jass Band One Step" became the first Jazz record ever released on February 26, 1917 for the Victor Talking Machine Company.<br>  <br>  The first most significant jazz records, not only in jazz but also in music history, were recorded in 1923 by King Oliver and His Creole Jazz Band. Jazz music recorded between 1917 and these recordings in 1923 don't have such a great musical value.<br>  <br>  Back to your question.<br>  <br>  Jazz music started around 1895 and first time recorded in 1917. From 1923 on, jazz music became musically more and more significant.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	it is assumed to have started sometime around 1910 in new orleans. the first jazz recording is by the original dixieland jazz band in 1917. as with most "when did this type of music start" kinds of questions it is hard to be exact about it. But it is generally safe to say it is shortly after the turn of the century by musicians such as jelly roll morton, buddy boldin, king oliver and sidney bechet.

6112fce921c5789ff47b05c280e49bffaa	There's two things to consider: the maturity level of the kid and the specific movie.  For instance, one 13-year-old may be more mature and more able to handle and understand things better than another 13-year-old.  The parent knows their child better than anyone.  The R-rating is a very wide category.  Some films can have no violence, nudity or sex but still get an R for having 6 or 7 "f words" in.  Some are stronger and have lots of graphic violence, torture and gore.  Some of these "harder" R's may have been trimmed only by a few seconds to avoid an NC-17.|`|AA11032183	17|`|d3b9ef2a478fe9a4685a6a30dde3ba87aa	depends on their intelligence and maturity levels. my parents never really had a restriction for it. but i might wait on letting my daughter watch them until she's 12-16. depending on maturity when she gets there. she's only 2 now.|`|fc5839cd3ee629a9e7e63ed6974f312faa	When they become ADULTS|`|0bc202b826b7f3550117d2c6eaaf2237aa	i'm 12 and i watch  of R rated movies. it depends on how mature the kid is i guess.|`|4b0350f9780a8eec20143d7ad2744aa3aa	I STARTED SEEING THEM WHEN I WAS 7<br>  <br>  IT hasn't psychologically Marred me though.|`|AA10204072	depending on their attitude AND the movie, but I say 15 for most|`|AA11333511	I don't think it should be based on how old they are, but how mature they are. I know 20 year olds that are old enough to watch rated R movies, but not mature enough to handle the contents like an adult|`|c0892f59ad66605ff3238d4fced03215aa	15 or 16, most kids by this age have already been watching R movies anyway|`|c09745e19554dfb4ed4ee433c3d33adbaa	There are several different reasons for a movie to be R rated. Adult content. graphic violence, Graphic and unacceptable language,Disturbing or graphic sexual content. It is my opinion that many of these movies are not fit for ANYONE of ANY AGE to watch so they should NEVER be viewed by children. TO many violent movies and killings on movies have lowered the value of life in the minds of our society. If we continue on in this direction we will soon have the same problem with radical religious extremist/ politically motivated terrorist and assassins. lets get back to a kinder less objectionable, more comedic source of entertainment.|`|cd023b628db4ffd97e9837ab845e37f8aa	I also have to side with the opinion that it really has to do with the maturity level of the child instead of a chronological age.<br>  <br>  I've been watching R movies on my own since 7th grade. I love horror and action/ martial arts movies, which tend to get an R rating. At the time, we lived in a small town that only had 1 theater. My mom hated having to take me to see the movies I wanted to (she's very squemish) so she was able to clear it with the theater management that I could see R rated movies on my own, and that she would drop me off and pick me up afterwards. <br>  <br>  But that requires a parent to really know their children- what do they want to see, why do they want to see it, etc. If a parent doesn't spend time watching shows and movies with their kids and seeing how their kids are, a parent won't know enough to make an informed judgement on their children's maturity level.<br>  <br>  I think that is a sad sign as to the rise of all of the ratings systems for video games, tv shows (all of which I didn't grow up with)... it takes less effort to use a "rating" to determine if a child should watch something or not, versus taking the time to learn about and watch these things for yourself (especially with your child) and making choices tailored to you and your child.|`|fac046bc8c7ddc70d39fe56618540d7aaa	13|`|196ede5c2f60bc28fdbc980af32c7b4baa	17years, and it also depends on the content of the movie|`|1ff1ae11ff03835417e35331041cd4e7aa	i think the law says 17.  but if a parent is there, i think youger is allowed|`|71e56fc36adf89365daaa42e2b0094f2aa	14|`|815dd641f35705da7262866617e8aad5aa	well for me i was 10. but probally about 12 or 13. i saw SNAKES ON A PLANE with a freind @ the movies and the movie ppl didnt say n e thing.|`|AA10481304	The parent has to decide. I was ten whenever I watched most of Black Hawk Down on TV when my folks wern't home. I never payed attention to restrictions, for better or worse...|`|AA11044306	It really all depends on the child's maturity, i started watching rated-R movies when I was around 6.|`|AA11113278	I honestly think around 17. Even though i know that many kids start at a much younger age it still dosent seem right. Parents think that showing a rated R movie to a 5 year old won't do much since they'll "forget" but it can carry on. Since I am younger than 18 I seriously refrian from watching them since rated R movies are rated that way for a reason.

After about a year, I asked her if it was okay for me to date him because we'd become best friends and she said it was fine, so here we are today!!<br>  <br>  He is very intelligent. He's a CPA at the #1 accounting firm in America. He's also extremely athletic. He played both college soccer and raquetball and now plays golf on a regular basis to stay in shape. He's a very spiritual person and shares the same faith as I do. He is a wonderful father to our four-year-old daughter. He can make anything fun for the both of us. He's very laid back which forces by Type A personality to calm down a little bit.<br>  <br>  The thing I like best about him is that he never ceases to amaze me. He's not the most spontaneous person in the world, but he always seems to be surprising me with something he knows or can do or does for me. It keeps life interesting and I love that about him.|`|8b714b6befd467f1d0b0dd8e696d426daa	I met my best friend when I was in the 10th grade. We are still friends to this day. Except for the fact that we are 2 different people. We have the same personality and have each been through the same things in life. It is pretty funny we graduated the same year, had kids at the same age and around the same time. Have both been though a divorce as a child.|`|20ab897b35d2b4e61e58bc784081b475aa	my best friend is corlisia I met in the 6th grade I love how she does'nt care how I act and she never lets me get out of hand|`|bfe9bd5754aecae25e1d6811a173c4fbaa	My best freind is William Thomson. I moved to Sandy Creek between the second and third grades. The first day of third grade, he came up to me and started talking to me. We have been freinds ever since. William and I both have a love of video games. (I think that is mostly my fault, because I loved them and I would show him my games when he would come to my house. He is pretty undisciplined and doesn't mind his parents very well. Not that they even can because we are 15 (Will) and 16(Me) now.He has a huge potty mouth but I just think that is halarious. Me on the other hand, I never swear. He has short dark brown hair, he wears glasses, he is a little taller than me (about 5,10), he's not really skinny but he isn't fat either, he loves anime manga like Shonen Jump and Yugio, he absolutely loves the TV, he worships it, he also likes to think of himself as a Budhist. What I like most about Will is that he swears, A LOT, and that we share some of the same interests.
AA10389003	Liar's dice (liar dice) is a name for a class of dice games for two or more players. A common feature of all Liar's Dice games is that each player in turn must either make a higher bid (or claim) than the previous player, or challenge the previous players' bid as too high.<br>  Poker Dice are often used in Liar's Dice<br>  Enlarge<br>  Poker Dice are often used in Liar's Dice<br>  <br>  While many variations exist, they generally fall into one of two major categories: "common hand" games, where all players are bidding on the group's collection of dice while only seeing their own portion of it, and "individual hand" games, where each player makes claims only about their own dice. These major variants are different enough to be considered separate games but unfortunately both have come to be known as "Liar's Dice."<br>  <br>  It is easy to learn, requires minimal equipment, and can be played as a gambling or drinking game. Playing this game well requires the ability to deceive and to detect an opponent's deception. Liar's dice is known as Dudo or Perudo in South America. The game has also been marketed under the name, Call My Bluff, winning the 1993 Spiel des Jahres and Deutscher Spiele Preis awards. In Germany, Liar's Dice as a gambling game is called "M?xchen"; the equivalent drinking game is sometimes called "Mexicali" or "Mexican" in the United States (see below). Given the similar pronunciations of these two German and English words, it is likely that the name of the one game derives from the name of the other.[citation needed] Whether the German or English version was the original, however, is less clear.<br>  <br>  I think it's this one.  Hence there could not possibly be 12 fives on the board|`|9a6a488bbd91d84fc00565d50a529eb4aa	i think its kinda like the game "bull ****" (BS) only u use dice and u say how many of a certain number of dice u have...like if u have two "5" one the dice, but u said that u had eight "5" and the other people have to guess if your telling the truth or not<br>  u win by having the most of something: <br>  *example*<br>  first player has: four "2"<br>  second player has: eight "4"<br>  third player has: six "3"<br>  the second player would win!<br>  <br>  i hope that made sense...i was kinda getting confused myself!!|`|AA11867189	Sorry, I don't. I was kinda wondering the same thing.......|`|0327af14aaaa73a535ba3cff0a536897aa	No I was trying to figure it out myself.  William said it was a game of deception so I think it has something to do with tricking the people you're playing with as to what you have under your cup.

4b0350f9780a8eec20143d7ad2744aa3aa	LIZ needsta get with JAAACKKKK.<br>  <br>  I wish they could expand the possible romance a little more. <br>  <br>  My idea of a story:<br>  <br>  Let's say Liz gets kidnapped by some villain pirate. <br>  Jack may (at first) not come to her rescue (especially after what she did), but later decides that he cares enough about her to rescue her. <br>  <br>  Will may also "go the distance" to rescue Liz as well but hopes to get to her before Jack does (since he's (Will) jealous). <br>  <br>  Later when Will sees Jack and Liz together, he'll realize how much she really loves Jack instead of him.<br>  <br>  However, Will may get mad and try to convince Liz about how much he loves her and then ask her to marry him in a "final wedding." Liz (though with many doubts) will say yes and a ceremony is prepared for a second time. <br>  <br>  When Jack hears that Liz and Will are about to get married, he'll be sad (but he hides his feelings) and gets ready sail away with his pirate crew on the Black Pearl.<br>  <br>  BUTTTTT on the day of the wedding, Liz will realize how much she misses and wants Jack. She runs from the wedding and tells Will how she loves him, but is not "in love" with him. Will understands this and let's her go.<br>  <br>  <br>  Just before the Black Pearl leaves the port, Captain Jack suddenly hears a shout...."Jack!!! JACK!!! Wait!!! Surely you can let one more person on your ship!!"---- <br>  <br>  Jack smiles when he's sees that it is Elizabeth who is running towards the ship. <br>  <br>  Elizabeth races up on deck, wraps her arms around Jack and says.."Don't worry, Jack. I'm not going to chain you this time." She smiles as Jack pulls her closer to him and then.......THEY KISS!!!! and the beautiful music plays as the credits start to roll up.|`|842bcd07b8ca1731aa0673dd72496852aa	you know its just a movie right???|`|9a6a488bbd91d84fc00565d50a529eb4aa	stay with will because they're a cute couple and because will would do anything for her...even risk his life to save her!!! but the question is, will Will even want her back after he saw her kiss jack? <br>  but her hooking up with jack would simply be amazing!!!<br>  and norrington should just stay out of the picture!!
aeabd61802ee52a79ed3440c8e85bcc3aa	This is a post I saw on IMDB:<br>  <br>  Okay, everyone's been freaking over how and why Capt. Barbossa is still alive. If you watch the first movie, you'll see why.<br>  First of all, Barbossa wanted Will Turner's blood to sacrifice with the Aztec gold, because Elizabeth's didn't work. However, it was Jack's blood that was used (because during his duel with Barbossa, Jack cut his own hand, remember?)<br>  Second, Jack shot Barbossa BEFORE Will dropped the coin into the chest, meaning that at the point old Barby was shot, the curse was still in effect.<br>  Third, when Barbossa "dies", he falls onto the pile of coins next to the chest. However, in the scene later where Jack steals a crown from the treasure and talks to Will, the camera pans slightly over to the right. The chest is in the background, but Barbossa' body is not there.<br>  Finally, there's the monkey. In case nobody noticed, the damn thing is STILL undead, which means that el curso is still somehow in effecto. The other cursed pirates were cured because Will had already dropped the coin, but Barbossa was still alive. And, he could have made the monkey take a coin and hide it somewhere, which explains why the monkey is still cursed and Barby isn't.<br>  There. That's why he's still alive, even after being shot. Happy?|`|9a6a488bbd91d84fc00565d50a529eb4aa	i thought it was a little confusing, too...but i still loved it!!!! i think tia (the witch doctor) brought barbossa back to life because she can see the future and knew that he could help them find captain jack or he never died in the first one cause the monkey jack took a coin at the end of the movie!!|`|AA10787347	It really wasn't all that confusing, the only part that was confusing, was when barbossa came back.<br>  i agree with you there.|`|e76367aa3d42298a452a1f51c086026caa	Try watching the DVD (after it comes out) with captions on. It's under languages. Nobody knows why Barbossa came back.<br>  <br>  When Jack took the coin in the first movie, that meant that, in order to lift the curse, Will AND Jack both had to put blood in. If you notice, when Will drops the coins, his own hand was cut.<br>  <br>  True, when Barbossa was shot the curse was still in effect, but that bullet was still lodged in his heart when good old Will lifted the curse.<br>  <br>  After the credits on the first movie (yes, AFTER the credits), the monkey showed up, climbed over Barbossa's body, and took a coin. Barbossa's body was there, so it might have just been a mistake that he wasn't there when Jack took the crown. The monkey was then cursed.

AA11049717	I love this show, it was Reflections by the supremes. They also used We Gotta Get out of this Place by Katrina and the Waves for a few episodes. Also, I'm sorry, it was Dana Delaney. Just thought I would let you know.|`|AA10117437	That is Diana Ross and the Supremes.  Actually, I don't know who recorded it for the show, but she is the original.|`|3c207a93cde65fa25f604dfe01c90b7daa	Diana Ross & The Supremes, "Reflections", the song already existed before the series.|`|62a2e0a5c3891702b903e27edec067e6aa	That version is by the Animals and it is called "Reflections"<br>  <br>  <br>  Through the mirror of my mind<br>  Time after time<br>  I see reflections of you and me<br>  <br>  Reflections of<br>  The way life used to be<br>  Reflections of<br>  The love you took from me<br>  <br>  Oh, I’m all alone now<br>  No love to shield me<br>  Trapped in a world<br>  That’s a distorted reality<br>  <br>  Hapiness you took from me<br>  And left me alone<br>  With only memories<br>  <br>  Through the mirror of my mind<br>  Through these tears that I’m crying<br>  Reflects a hurt I can’t control<br>  ’cause although you’re gone<br>  I keep holding on<br>  To the happy times<br>  Oh, when you were mine<br>  <br>  As I peer through the window<br>  Of lost time<br>  Looking over my yesterdays<br>  And all the love I gave all in vain<br>  (all the love) all the love<br>  That I’ve waisted<br>  (all the tears) all the tears<br>  That I’ve taisted<br>  All in vain<br>  <br>  Through the hollow of my tears<br>  I see a dream that’s lost<br>  From the hurt<br>  That you have caused<br>  <br>  Everywhere I turn<br>  Seems like everything I see<br>  Reflects the love that used to be<br>  <br>  In you I put<br>  All my faith and trust<br>  Right before my eyes<br>  My world has turned to dust<br>  <br>  After all the nights<br>  I sat alone and wept<br>  Just a handful of promisses<br>  Are all that’s left of loving you<br>  <br>  Reflections of<br>  The way life used to be<br>  Reflections of<br>  The love you took from me<br>  <br>  In you I put<br>  All my faith and trust<br>  Right before my eyes<br>  My world has turned to dust..|`|a90c35c25de0409dc0d6c08a00c6a069aa	The song is called "Reflections", The Supremes sang it, and it reached #2 on the charts in 1967.

2021c62da959fb83b78dad453cdce43aaa	The best one we've ever been to is Colette's in New Orleans.<br>  <br>  It's a European style club that offers three floors of partying.  The first floor is very typical of an upscale bar.  Nice dance floor with a couple of stripper poles and appropriate lighting.  There are also several lounge areas that are very comfortable and allow for certain extra activities to occur.<br>  <br>  The second floor is the 'playing floor'.  It features rooms like the Porno Room, the Voyeur Room, the Dungeon, and the Orgy Room for your playing needs.  There's also a quiet lounge on this floor so you can have a conversation with a couple and not have to shout over the dance music on the first floor.  <br>  <br>  The third floor provides you with rental room for the night.  Should you feel as though you've had too much to drink or want to stay and play after the club closes or want to rent it for the weekend, there are several different themed rooms that you can rent at a better rate then most hotel rooms.  <br>  <br>  We've been told by several people that Colette's is one of the premier clubs in the country.  If you're ever in New Orleans, check it out.|`|48b8c22d641669c011477b8b9ecc2629aa	La Trapeze in NYC> Very cool place that is clean and discreet.<br>  Check it out you freaks!!!!|`|767cff39a6c842d2d0579458ce9daa2baa	freak|`|b8a5e56e6e9a04e9cf01f58e05c246b1aa	r u girl or guy OR you both are asking question lol|`|bde6ec7b4b036258fc81a0bb1273ee70aa	There a really good one in Missouri.....its a nudist campground called  Natural Pines.

2b884608f707ba450e4e091dce105992aa	Nope.<br>  Despite the popular belief that Battle Royale has been banned in the United States, that's not the case. There are two conflicting (but similar) stories as to why the film hasn't come out in the U.S.: The production company, Toei, refuses to license the movie for North American distribution and has already rejected offers from several North American companies; or: The licensing price is unusually high for this kind of film and smaller independent film companies (Tartan, Synapse, Sundance) can't afford it, while larger companies specializing in independent film (The Weinstein Company/Miramax, Fine Line, Warner Independent, Fox Searchlight) won't buy it for that price.|`|9a6a488bbd91d84fc00565d50a529eb4aa	i have no idea

I am not fat and I hate hot weather.|`|19f203a7d072464b4aa3270cd7feb335aa	Now maneater, let's get one thing straight: Super Junk is not fat.  I am black and I don't like cold weather.  Now I've got a fat friend named Lugnut and he gets sweat stains all over his shirt when he even steps out into hot weather.  I don't think he minds, but I hate looking at the big wet spot left on his **** when he lifts his body out of his car seat.  Embarrassing.|`|AA11326688	I don't think weight really makes much of a difference I don't think I am fat and I hate hot weather,but my sister is overweight and is always cold when I am hot. I don't think it has anything to do with your weight but more how your body is able to process the temperature changes.|`|AA12237967	i dunno|`|AA12359907	Well, figure it this way... look at all the pics of Nicole Ritchie, she always looks like a frail, hunched over elderly woman because she is so damn thin, I'm sure she FREEZES in the winter, especially in those skimpy outfits. <br>  <br>  And fat people, the sweating probably causes heat rash because their sweaty skin is rubbing together, so thats uncomfortable, and they cant (SHOULDNT) wear too little clothing, so they are just adding to their body temperature.<br>  <br>  Either season, you're better off for a healthy weight for your body type!|`|AA12064626	i don't know. yesterday i was freezing and the day low was 76 and it was in the high nineties.....i am average weight for my height... thin for my age|`|AA10737267	I'm not fat, but even I dislike hot weather.

He's a little chubbier than his brother, but I totally liked his answers so much better than Cole's on their site's profile thingy: <br>  <br>  Cole: 8, I like his character better on the "Suite Life..." He's that dorky kid that I had crushes on when I was in school :)... -1 for each of the twins because they are too young to ever be in my reach as well :( and then the other -1 for Cole just because I like Dylan better...check out the sites!|`|AA11807718	DYLAN|`|520b43dd4a4c72b12d0058a1995e6ef2aa	neither|`|9120696d9caf008354bad8dd74e1c01caa	dylan sprouse because he's my age|`|AA10425960	Zac Efron !|`|AA12021508	Zac Efron hands down!<br>  <br>  i|`|f98c4e8ca6aa455daf73781909efa4e0aa	I think Zac is cuter!|`|fb31be53a02cbf697ee9c5ac2e33f1dcaa	Neither they are dogs!

Vanessa sounds really off key and it just doesn't sound good at all live.|`|AA10558731	She sounds horrible not because she's singing live (as one person stated) but because she IS horrible and she was lip-synching to the CD.<br>  <br>  Just my humble opinion, of course...|`|1a46d0074681bb9d896de237c86a3799aa	i know what you mean. she is soooo fake and bubblegummy. im not a huge AT fan, but yes she is way better!  blah!|`|3a7f4f647586bcc40965ffe7842aadafaa	ok|`|9a6a488bbd91d84fc00565d50a529eb4aa	i know.....they are both bad!|`|bd6a96df906b5e809c2055466b9e83bcaa	That was a good live performance.

a41bd848869f511e910bd0717457d67eaa	Yes - definitely.  it's perfect for someone who doesn't speak any english - or any language for that matter.  Stomp has no dialog whatsoever.  It's all storytelling through beats and rhythm made by the performs live on stage.  It's fantastic...I've seen it twice, I can't imagine anyone who would not like it.|`|a5289779b2148f9a924042f6ad8a6f0eaa	i haven't seen it but i heard it's really cool|`|c5022dd3e5b437b78aa3c42835f0a24caa	Como Estas.

3994707fa4bf4bb68e2faba303c80dc7aa	i would say ibanez, because it is a more trusted brand by most of the beginning guitarist i know, and it has a fuller sound and feels good in your fingers and anyway i tried this guitar my self and it is not half bad, and you are getting all those goodies with it so go with the ibanez (good deal if i so my self)<br>  -ovation is for country style and not really for rock, not so full in the sound<br>  -last thing is that you got to go to the guitar store and ask experts (there are cheaper and better guitar out there than these two)<br>  go to either a Sam Ash or Guitar Center, als you go to try the guitar themselves to see what you like (looks is only 33% of the guitar, the rest is the sound)|`|fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	Applause, Ibanez, and most other cheaper plastic backed guitars (not Ovation or Adamas) are built in China or Indonesia, in the same factory... only the names change. One factory popular with Kaman (Ovation/Applause) in Indonesia is called Oz Musical Instrument Company (no kidding). Look at the label inside the guitar or on the back of the headstock for where it was made.<br>  <br>  Instead of brand shopping, instead look for guitars with solid tops and transparent finishes that let you see the wood. Although some guitars look really cool with figured tops they are usually plywood... coupled with a plastic back the sound just isn't there.

8718f7f58eedaaf7fa4f72fc3c487fa6aa	I don't exactly know what you mean by techniques but there is alot of symbolism in this film. For instance , the names of the characters. The mom and dead brother were very close and both of their names started with a B, as did the doctor's. The dad and the surviving son were alot alike and their names started with a C. When Conrad was contemplating calling the girl, he thought of changing his name to Bill. The only other thing I noticed was the lighting. The home is brightly lit and the doctor's office is very dim.|`|24278ccbf827a1e39ca9aa96fa8296b1aa	Watch the film...it's quite good.

The Silver Surfer can fly, survive in space, project bolts or energy, transmute material and other powers because of the Power Cosmic.

I would travel around the world looking for people worthy of power, people who would act responsibly and use their power for the greater good. Plus, I would be able to give myself superpowers. My favorite would be a power similar to that of Mr. Fantastic or Elongated Man. I would be able to alter my appearance by stretching my facial features and pose as anybody I want. I could turn myself into a living slingshot or shapeshift my arm into any weapon, like a hammer or a sword. I could never be harmed by physical attacks because my malleable body would absorb the impact. Stretching my limbs backwards and snapping them back would provide for swift and powerful attacks. Intangibility (phasing through solid objects) is cool, too.|`|938c884b01a162594f2dea609ff3c42caa	Telekinesis.  It's probably the most versatile power ever imagined.<br>  <br>  One drawback about invisibility: if light isn't bouncing off your body so that others can't see you, how would light reach your eyes?

They were eager to learn, to be taught, and to teach.<br>  There's Veronica. She's biting her lip as she watches the waves turn white at the tip.<br>  There's Vada. Radiating with joy and luckily luckily she still can't stand the sight of a boy.<br>  Lastly, there's Dade. His hair dances in the wind and he's wondering what love is and why it has to end.<br>  He can't understand how everyone goes on breathing when true love ends. His mother whispers quietly...<br>  Heaven's not a place that you go when you die<br>  It's that moment in life when you actually feel alive. So take this advice<br>  live by every word. Love is just a hoax so forget<br>  everything that you have heard and live for the moment now.<br>  There's Veronica. She's licking her lips as she waits for her real<br>  first passionate kiss. There's Vada. Can't admit her jealousy<br>  of her sister Veronica and how she's so pretty.<br>  Lastly, there's Dade. Still sitting on the dock.<br>  Ponders his life, and he skips his rocks. He wonders<br>  when his father will return, but he's not coming back.<br>  There's three, count 'em three children missing from the beach.<br>  But the sad thing is that they never lived past the age of fifteen<br>  due to neglect from their mother who was bedridden<br>  by her ex-lover, their father. She didn't even notice, or pay much attention<br>  as the tide came in and swept her three into the ocean. Now all her advice<br>  seems useless. Heaven's not a place that you go when you die<br>  it's that moment in life when you actually feel alive. Take this advice, live by every word.<br>  Love's completely real, so forget everything<br>  that you've heard and live for the moment now.

f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	The operative word here is "Take" which implies you have a choice.<br>  <br>  You have no choice.<br>  <br>  Like the vampire, does the vampire choose to be undead or do undead choose the vampire? I think it is the latter. Once bitten, the vampire either drinks blood or suffers but they can't die and they can't live, unless some stake wielding do gooder decides to break their heart. Vampires are somewhat tragic figures in that way. For a vampire, life has no value. Everything is pleasure and pain. For a mortal, life is a game of musical chairs and eventually the last chair disappears or they bring out more chairs and start the game all over again. Did they take life as it came or did they have a choice other than to not play and therefore die? <br>  <br>  I don't see myself taking life as it comes but rather I rage at life until it is done. I think of it as going to the beach and backing into the surf. With eat step back wards the waves get higher and I struggle more to stay with my head above water. Pretty soon I have no footing and I either have to turn around and face those waves or drown for lack of effort. And then there is the undertow. Life is filled with surprises. <br>  <br>  Like the hunters I have sent over to your place to find that little voice and capture her. I am sure there is money to be made off a little voice that gives you such interesting questions. I just don't have a name for her yet. She keeps telling you to change your name so I wonder what to call her. Perhaps Sibyl. I am not really keen on that name but it fits.|`|e7585a7d30f01cc2255dfa437072e3cdaa	Yes I do.

AA11371581	I think it's because running a childcare center is so expensive, and parents can often only afford so much in a month (my childcare bill is way more than my rent as it is!).

48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	I think "not" is proper in the context, and with the understanding that in slang expressions many words are left out, but you have to punctuate it correctly.  Put it in more formal English:<br>  <br>  Tex: There is not anything here worth a quarter of a million dollars.<br>  Gideon.  There is not, unless we are blind [and not seeing it].<br>  <br>  The elision is of the "there is" leading to the "not."  <br>   Or is this too pedantic?  :)|`|ZkDm2lfgaa	I think that it was just a grammatical error stuff like that in movies always bothers me but next time i watch it i will  watch closer :)

A3dlM9mtaa	Il finale del film "Gli Uccelli" è aperto a diverse interpretazioni tanto che i vari critici per anni si sono scervellati nella vana ricerca di un'interpretazione che, perlomeno, si avvicinasse al pensiero di Sir Alfred. Ma cosa voleva dire realmente il maestro?<br>  Cito alcune interpretazioni "Gli uccelli sono variabilmente l'incarnazione dei timori edipici di mamma Tandy per l'abbandono del "nido" famigliare da parte del figlio/uomo cresciuto, sono una punizione per la gioiosa ma inetta vita di Melanie, sono il volto oscuro della natura che si ribella all'uomo, il volto più tetro di un Dio punitore". <br>  Tutte interpretazioni valide ma non definitive. Probabilmente la verità la conosce solo Hitchcock  e purtroppo sono passati 27 anni dalla sua morte.....|`|981ab376a4ebbdda1013c7296f8a1b27aa	Interpretazione: ogni ucello è bell'a'mamma soja!|`|9becf708835039d61156a7728e67b20daa	che gli uccelli non bisogna sottovalutarli!!la scena finale del film mi ha fatto un pò paura..nn nascondo ke inizialmente la prima volta che ho visto questo film avevo paura ad uscire xk quegli uccelli mi avevano messo molta paura!!|`|b536c8e14ed51cfe62ac9ab8ee215f46aa	Il finale del film gli uccelli di Hitchcock  è completamente differente da quello del finale del romanzo di fantascienza degli anni '50 dal quale è stato tratto.|`|44VY400Kaa	che la natura, alla fine, vince sempre.<br>  il finale è lasciato sospeso proprio per sottolineare il mistero e la forza, insondabile, della natura stessa: non ci sono ragioni, non ci sono spiegazioni..il che è ancora più terrorizzante.|`|9472f60f2cbe27ab68e5f0a23db18e40aa	Non sottovalutare la natura.|`|dd4239d57daacf2c8aef2d82ed6897e7aa	gli uccelli è meglio non svegliarli....

I like hip hop(T- Pain, Bowwow), r&b( Chris Brown, Mario), pop ( The Click Five, HelloGoodbye, Gym Class Heros), rock ( Panic! at the Disco, Fall Out Boy), reggaeton( Toby Love, Rakim y Ken-y), Bachata( Aventura), reggae( TOK, Sean Paul), and soca (Blazer).........AND MORE!!|`|rei1xT3haa	R&B, it has nice beat and cute lyrics.|`|tovbXrS0aa	rock, because it all doesn't sound the same!|`|Cf294Tozaa	80's and 90's and some 70's.

zmue9Renaa	With no time for thought after all their was a thundering Rhino behind me... I ran down the aisle  peppering him with any antacid or laxative that I could find but I knew this was only a stop gap measure for soon he would be upon me.  ..I turned left onto the diaper aisle grabbing Huggies as fast as I could. IN my panic and stupidity I imagined they would cushion his charge if it came to that.  Unfortunately, I could only manage two so instead I dropped them in the middle of the aisle hoping that they might make him stumble and fall.  I knew he was right behind me because I could almost feel his breath on my back .  All the while I'm shouting at him to turn back into her!!  It wasn't working so I looked for a door that I could put between him and me til I figured out what I could do to save myself.  I remembered the bathroom was in the back of the store so I veered down toys as I grabbed some weaponry and ammo for protection running as fast as I could.  There was the door if I could reach it before it....But no, this was a "thinking" Rhino he had cut over and outflanked me and now stood  right smack in front of the door.  How could he have realized what I was thinking?  I didn't have time for an answer.  Instead I tried to stop but my momentum was carrying me straight into him.<br>  A Kamakazi I was not so I put my arm out to grab anything that might anchor me.  I was lucky.  My fingers found those round little holes that outlined the Walgreen's shelves.  I grabbed them with all my strength and realized after that I was listening to my own screams as my fingers were stretched to their limit.  But hold I did.  Unfortunately,not without a huge sacrifice on my part.  Bolts of pain shot up and down my arm.  <br>  I never felt anything like it before and hoped never to again.<br>  I tried to tell myself to forget it just load the ammo into the gun.<br>  It was good advice but I was righthanded and that was the arm I hurt.<br>  <br>  That was lots of fun.  Thanks for the question.  Hope your story is a huge success.|`|KV7fkp1qaa	Soon the new beauty advisor trainee jumped out trying to sell me perfume, I said I had no time that a rhino was after me, she said that was fine but her supervisor yelled at her and soon she was chasing me with the rhino. I quickly ran to the unlocked stock room and lost the rhino, but where did the beauty advisor go? *I used to work at walgreens this is a true part -->) the stock room was cold and dark, Halloween decorations were still left all around, I turned the coner and heard a scream "AHHHH" shivers climb up my back but it turns out it's just a black cat decoration.

"ach ja" dargestelltw werden. Du wei?t schon in solchen Comedies.... Das wirkt sich leider auch auf die Wirklichkeit aus. Ich mein, okay ich bin jetzt nicht Transsexuell, aber dafür Ausl?nder. Hm.... Viele, ehrlich gesagt, die Jugendlichen sind da die schlimmsten, k?nnen so etwas nicht ab. Ich kann dich verstehen. Aber ich finde, dass du k?mpfen solltest. Diese Frage zum Beispiel ist schon ma der erste Schritt....Die Frauen haben es ja auch auf Gleichberechtigung geschafft!!! Versuch andere kennenzulernen, die auch transsexuell sind und wenn ihr mehrere seid, k?nnt ihr auch mehr schaffen. Ich wei?, es klingt lasch, aber stell dir vor, wie es vor fünfzig Jahren geklungen hat, als die Frauen sich erhoben!!!!!<br>  Das ist jetzt so eher weitsichtiger.<br>  Direkt auf deine Probleme hier: Wenn die Leute dich ablehnen, dann erkl?re ihnen, wie es für dich ist. Sag ihnen du bist auch nur ein Mensch. Die sollen sich ma vorstellen, die leben in einer Welt in der alle gegen hetero sind. Wie würden die sich fühlen??? Schei?e. Du bist auch nur ein Mensch, der etwas verdienen muss, um zu leben. Du WILLST ja nicht vom Staat abh?ngig sein. Und da sollen die Leute nicht immer sagen: Ja, die, die Hartz IV ham, das sind ja immer "solche", wenn sie selber eben dran schuld sind und es nicht erlauben, dass jemand, wie du auch "normal" wir WIR ALLE leben kann.|`|c0998070bced6de899f7cc9ebe3780eeaa	Die Vorurteile - selbst bei jüngeren Leuten - sind sehr sehr hoch. <br>  <br>  Ein junger Mann, der zusammen mit mir in einer Abteilung (Bank) gearbeitet hat, hat sich irgendwann geoutet und kam als Frau. Er war in medizinischer Therapie wie du. Eine Hasswelle schlug ihm entgegen. Ich habe es nicht verstanden. Er war immer anerkannt und hat seinen Charakter nicht ge?ndert. Er war ganz normal und nicht auf?llig gekleidet oder geschminkt. Die Abteilung bestand zu derzeit aus 80 % Leuten, die zwischen 20 und 35 Jahren waren. Also relativ jung und in einer Gro?stadt BERLIN.<br>  Es wurde dann von den Kollegen her so schlimm, dass man ihm von der Gesch?ftsleitung eine Abfindung bot, damit er geht. Er hat das Angebot angenommen und das Geld für seine medizinischen Sachen, die er nicht bezahlt bekam, genommen (Bart weg lasern usw.)<br>  <br>  Da ich nicht mehr in Berlin wohne, wei? ich nicht, was aus ihm/ihr geworden ist. <br>  <br>  Ich kann es bis heute nicht nachvollziehen, warum so viele Leute so intolerant sind.Die Geschichte f?llt mir immer wieder ein, wenn ich h?re wie tolerant es in Berlin zugeht.|`|uQoJFuIIaa	Du mu?t Deine Transsexualit?t ja nicht vor Dir hertragen.<br>  Es interessiert niemanden, was oder wie Du bist.

Seit Dezember ist sie operiert.<br>  Sie ist H?rakustikerin und hat seit jeher in der ?ffentlichkeit gearbeitet. Ihr Alltagstest-Jahr hat sie bei ihrer angestammten Arbeitsstelle durchgezogen. Die Kunden (naturgem?? haupts?chlich alte Menschen und Stammkundschaft) hatten überhaupt keine Probleme damit, aber die Chefin um so gr??ere, sodass sie ihr letztendlich kündigte, mit der Begründung, die Auftr?ge seien zu stark zurück gegangen, als dass sie sie weiter besch?ftigen k?nne. Ganz sch?n verlogen das Ganze!<br>  Die Freundin ist immer noch auf Stellensuche, obwohl bei ihr Name und Pass inzwischen ge?ndert sind. Allerdings habe ich nicht den Eindruck, dass es an ihrer Transsexualit?t liegt, dass sie noch keine Stelle bekommen hat, sondern daran, dass sie, nachdem sie nach Jahren endlich den Mut gefunden hatte, sich zu outen, überhaupt nicht mehr bereit ist in irgendeiner Form Zugest?ndnisse an ein Team zu machen, sondern nur noch ihr eigenes Ding durchzieht.<br>  Ups, jetzt hab ich aber aus'm N?hk?stchen geplaudert, wa?|`|fe8106565b56d36fa043b16a31471e78aa	Hallo! Wenn Du Deinen Namen noch nicht hast ge?ndert hast, wirst Du leider mit der Intoleranz Deiner Mitmenschen leben müssen. Dir zu sagen, da? Du "erhobenen Hauptes" durchs Leben gehen sollst, wird Dir nicht weiterhelfen.<br>  Du bist aber doch in Therapie und irgendwann wird in Deinem Pass ein Frauenname stehen (wenn Du es durchziehst).

Viele Menschen lassen sich davon abschrecken, wenn jemand nicht genau so ist wie alle anderen. Tanzt jemand aus der Reihe wird er nicht mehr akzeptiert. Bei Jobs kann es natürlich auch sein, dass die Personalchefs auch Angst haben, dass die Kunden diese Einstellung haben und nicht mehr kommen, wenn ein Transsexueller zu sehen ist...

82c64064ae238f0ce223f33036950a66aa	In diesem Fall definitiv Ja! <br>  Wenn die Annahme verweigert wurde dann ist die Kundigung zugestellt. Die Kundigung wurde ornungsgem?? zugestellt. Das die Firma die Kündigung nicht animmt ist allein deren Problem. Für eine Kündigung Bedarf es keiner Annahme, da eine Kündigung eine Einseitige Willenserkl?rung ist (im Gegensatz zu Vertr?gen).<br>  <br>  W?re jedoch die Kündigung an die falsche Anschrift geschickt dann ist sie nicht zugestellt.|`|205abd62e46618d0495f9ec4942e3c74aa	obwohl ich kein jurist bin, habe ich die meinung, dass  die kündigung rechtskr?ftig ist. deinen freundin hat alles zumutbare unternommen, die kündigung zeitgerecht und nachweislich zuzustellen. wenn der empf?nger das schreiben nicht annimmt, setzt das die kündigungsfrist au?er vollzug. ich würde nochmals eine kündigung nachschicken, den sachverhalt erw?hnen, und jede zahlung einstellen. nachweisen kann sie es mit ihrem einschreib-beleg. wenn der empf?nger das ding nicht annehmen will, ist das sein problem. im zweifelsfall würde ich bei der verbraucherzentrale anrufen.|`|48eecc1547ed409534e55333eb4e0555aa	Das ist schwierig ,aber ich denke mal das die Kündigung nicht gilt ,weil der Empf?nger sie ja nicht angenommen und somit auch nicht gelesen hat|`|95da5edb422fff35e9d24ad6e45ce86caa	Die Kündigung gilt in diesem Falle als nicht angenommen. <br>  Einen guten Tip für deine Bekannte, auch wenn es nicht billig wird: Sie soll die Kündigung immer wieder schicken und dabei zum n?chst m?glichen Termin kündigen. Die Firma kann sich nicht ewig weigern, einen Brief nicht anzunehmen. Wenn sie es nach dem dritten oder vierten Versuch, den Brief immer noch nicht annimmt, mu? sie zum Anwalt. Eine Kündigung mu? angenommen werden, egal ob es einem Vertragspartner pa?t, oder nicht.|`|QMdbLQmyaa	Wenn sie per Einschreiben und Rückschein gekündigt hat ist es doch wohl kein Problem.Den Rückschein mu? ja irgend einer in Empfang genommen haben und mu? unterschrieben werden.Wenn der Brief nicht angenommen wurde hat trotzdem der Postbote Tag und Zeit und die Begründung Annahme verweigert notiert|`|c3da718848533c993adf7e87fd073aaaaa	JA diese Kündigung gilt trotzdem..die Post in den Machtbereich der Firma gekommen.<br>  D.h. sie h?tte ihn annehmen k?nnen.<br>  Wenn eine Post in den Machtbereich ger?t, dann gilt sie als zugestellt.<br>  Der Empf?nger hat ja Kenntnis davon gehabt.<br>  <br>  Mfg Marie|`|98b79eb622036d14f6523f929035ff62aa	Die Annahme sowie die -verweigerung werden auf dem Rückschein notiert. Bei nicht zugestellter Post wird der mit dem Vermerk versehene Rückschein zusammen mit dem (jetzt nicht zugestellten)  Brief an den Absender geschickt. Ich würde den Brief nur von einem Rechtsberater ?ffnen lassen, der dann best?tigt, da? wirklich eine Kündigung darin enthalten war. Hat die Freundin eine Einzugserm?chtigung erteilt, würde ich sie in jedem Fall zurückziehen. Vielleicht ist dieses Zeitungsunternehmen ja auch ein Fall für die Verbraucherschutzzentrale. Die freuen sich immer über solche Vorf?lle und k?nnen sicherlich einen guten Rat erteilen. Viel Glück.|`|b87274b505f7f473a1045c13faedc413aa	Muss ich rumraten wie alle.Ist ein Fall für die Verbraucherzentrale<br>  oder für einen Leseranwalt einer Tageszeitung.Mach die Firma doch hiermal ?ffentlich,damit einige Mitbürger gewarnt sind und solch eine unseri?se Firma meiden!|`|d6669d0eed21af19a1d4f4da848c25bdaa	Dies ist wirklich ein interessanter Fall. Ich wei? es auch nicht, habe aber eine Theorie!<br>  <br>  Deine Freundin hat doch sicher noch den Beleg über das Einschreiben und das zurückgesandte Einschreiben! Darauf steht sowohl das Datum, der Empf?nger und die Annahmeverweigerung! Damit ist ja belegt, da? die Kündigung rechtzeitig und korrekt - Einschreiben mit Rückschein - abgesandt wurde. Demnach mü?te diese Kündigung eigentlich rechtswirksam sein!<br>  <br>  Ich hoffe, ich konnte helfen!Teil uns doch bitte mit, was draus geworden ist!|`|nSxwBvZjaa	grunds?tzlich gilt als eingegangen..die Gerichte urteilen hier immer grunds?tzlich im Interesse des Verbrauchers:<br>  Was ist zu tun ??<br>  Alle Unterlagen aufbewahren<br>  Annahme der Zeitung verweigern<br>  abwarten|`|w4Pq2Vnxaa	Diese Kündigung gilt als nicht zugestellt.Wenn es eine Telefonnr. gibt einfach mal anrufen und nachfragen oder übers Internet versuchen.

Früher als noch die "Zettelwirtschaft" im Kreditkartenwesen herrschte, da kamen pro Jahr mindestens 300,- bis 500,- DM nicht zur Abrechnung, wahrscheinlich hatten die Gesch?fte eine besondere Art der Ordnung und die Abrechnungsbelege irgendwo verkramt.

Magneto tiene el caso anti "Charles", puesto que lo construyeron juntos, al igual que Charles tiene la máquina "Cerebro", que también fue construída por ambos... Suerte..!|`|mGSLxG2Eaa	Juggernaut tambien tiene uno parecido, y Magneto no les dio cascos a los demas por que no le importa lo que les pase a ellos.|`|o98wX7hNaa	por que es el unico inteligente y es el jefe|`|P7ys7uWdaa	no es cierto tambien juggernaut|`|ZAqunwOdaa	por que charles sabe como controlar a magneto o al menos sabe algunos de sus secretos debido a que en su juventud eran muy buenos amigos y compartian todo
DE64BfvHaa	Oye!! q muchas dudas tienes con Xmen!!!! jajaja...parece q no t gusto!!....Jean, convertida en ese momento en Fenix no hace nada por q estaba solo observando, sabia q nadie podia frenarla....lo q en realidad no entendi es q la forma mas obvia para frenarla era colocarle al nene (Jimmy)a su lado para q perdiera sus poderes y ya...no tanta cosa!!  pero esta cool tus interrogantes, pero tienes muchas en verdad...t falta preguntar por q no murio Charles!! jajaja|`|pIxha9xeaa	Sorry, no he visto la película.|`|8JDyb40Vaa	porque era el elemnto sorpresa, no has oido que primero que mueran los menos importantes osea que despejen el camino|`|2w3ZxRcmaa	No hace nada porque estaba manpulada por Magneto!! Adeams de que estaba manipulada por el Fenix!! Aparte él dice que primero, los que tienen que entrar en batalla son los "peones" asi que él manda a pelear a los mutantes menos poderosos y como que deja lo mejor (o lo peor) para el final!! Estrategia de combate seria...<br>  Saludos!!<br>  <br>  Y "She will rise again" como dice la tumba de Jean!!!! (en el comic) jaja|`|XDuDKX19aa	Si escuchas el comentario de DVD de la pelicula vas a escuchar a Brett Ratner (Director) discutiendo con los escritores Simon Kinberg y Zak Penn sobre por que Jean basicamente se sienta a ver la batalla, segun Ratner si Jean entraba a la batalla, la batalla simplemente se acabaría por que ella simplemente desintegrearia a todos. No estoy de acuerdo con eso (Como tampoco estuve de acuerdo con NO ver una gigantesca ave de fuego cuando Jean usara sus poderes de Phoenix, pero ?que se puede hacer?) pero basicamente esa es la razon real por la que ella no hizo nada.<br>  <br>  Si quieres una explicacion en la pelicula de por que ella no hizo nada, tal vez puedes pensar por que Jean no quiere ser manipulada por nadie en meterse a una batalla que no es de ella, y tal vez tiene un conflicto interno sobre que hacer o si debe rendirse a utilizar su gigantezco poder, como finalmente lo hizo.<br>  <br>  Suerte.|`|mGSLxG2Eaa	Le valió...

The second time when they got out the one smaller horse was walking back into their yard and just as my dad looked down the horse stopped, my dad not aware of this and the horse kicked him in the chest and when the guy finally came over to see if my dad was all right, he tells my dad "well you should never walk behind a horse".

Add that to 25 and you get thirty dollars.  It is ridiculous to assume that each friend paid 9 dollars because they each paid ten dollars.  They just got a dollar back because of the special and the shop keeper get two dollars which evens everything out.

iWv0rjUVaa	Ciao amici. Sai, secondo me stai facendo un terribile errore. Sbagli. Lui non odiava la gente, gli altri, il mondo. Odiava solo se stesso. Odiava la sua disperata incapacità di vivere. Ha cercato di distruggersi più volte; mai gli altri, consapevolmente. C'è riuscito. Leggi i suoi testi, leggi le interviste alla Love. Guarda che c'è scitto questo. Come Janis Joplin, meravigliosa, dolcissima, ruvidissima bimba; come Jim Morrison, un poeta straordinario, fragile come un cristallo, incapace di sopravvivere, neanche di vivere. E' morto a 27 anni; a 24 era di una bellezza quasi imbarazzante, a 27 era obeso, sfatto dentro e fuori, mascherato dietro ad una barbona risorgimentale e a etti di ero: Vuoi che continui? Qualcuno di voi si ricorda di Brian Jones? La mente pensante dei Rolling Stones? Affogato in una piscina, fatto come una ramazza; secondo Jagger era da circa 2 anni che era uno zombie: era già morto; anche lui non aveva 30 anni; procedo? (non tirate fuori Jimi, non c'entra un cacchio, ha solo avuto la sfiga di affogare nel suo vomito, avendo sbagliato la dose di barbiturici; lui secondo me, è stato solo sfigato, s'è proprio sbagliato). Elvis? disintegrato da downers e uppers e tonnellate di farmaci; trasformato come Morrison nella parodia di se stesso; crepato a 42 anni, nel cesso di casa, con la sua donna che non s'accorge di nulla perchè, da buon americano, la moquette alta mezzo metro ce l'aveva pure nel bagno e ha attutito la caduta; non mi dite però che non sapeva dove stava finendo; qualcuno può dire che ha avuto più coraggio Cobain, che s'è ammazzato direttamente, non giorno per giorno; io dico che è lo stesso, all'atto pratico. Io dico che questi artisti fantastici, sono stati tutti disperatamente incapaci di vivere una vita che a noi pare straordinaria e che ha loro, evidentemente, risultava straordinariamente...impossibile.<br>  Povero Curt.

Vivi che fingono di odiare la vita. Vivi che vivono in apnea sperando, poco prima di svenire, che il corpo non riprenda a respirare, come è destino che faccia.. Vivi che passano tutta la loro c@zzo di vita a fantasticare sulla morte. Lì, stesi sul"celofan"disposto  appositamente da loro...<br>  Ma come ci ricorda Alberto "Torna la Libidine prima o poi".. Che ci piaccia o no. Siamo legati.. Invece di pensare alla fuga... Pensiamo al perchè.. Buona fortuna. Io ne sono uscita ed è +facile che rimanere dentro ... Le idee sono cose strane. Passi molto tempo a premeditare una follia e per questo ti sembra che diventi cosa lucida, eppure resta solo una follia.. Passi molto tempo a premeditarla... Ma quando scompaiono i motivi che ti hanno spinto a farla, rimane solo una follia..Follia che ha dipinto il quadro di un periodo tatuato sulla tua pelle. Indelebile. E sei ancora così giovane, come puoi sentirti così vecchia? Eppure... Che ci crediate oppure no, basta "spostare l'orizzonte un pò +in là" (meg)... Baudelaire è affascinante, ma la gioia della canzone di mika come non fa a farvi venir voglia di canticchiare, di ballare..<br>  <br>  Sì. Esistono le cose atroci, brutte.. Esiste anche una realtà peggiore: il cinismo, l'apatia, l'indolenza, l'indifferenza, l'assenza o l'eccesso di empatia... Tutto questo ti induce a credere che bisogna salvare il salvabile, lottare, ma quando ti mancano le forze tutto diventa una merd@.. Il punto è che, per quanto possa far comodo chiudersi gli occchi... Esistono+cose belle che brutte. Se avete visto tutto troppo in fretta, non nascondetevi, non nascondetevi almeno da voi stessi. Se davvero vi fanno schifo la maggior parte degli uomini, fate qualcosa per quei due o tre che amate.. Leggete Travaglio e incazzatevi, andate ad uno spettacolo di Beppe Grillo con un fazzoletto e con la risata pronta, smettete di guardare il tg e leggete le notizie su internet.. Diventate qualcuno che possa fare qualcosa per questo tugurio. Ok, magari sono utopie, ma cazzo se pensate di non aver speranze èper voi stessi, date l'anima per chi cerca una speranza con tutto il cuore.. Ci sono tante cose belle ed umane da fare. Non capisco come la gente possa crucciarsi così nella proprio sofferenza e dimenticarsi del mondo.<br>  Non è sano.<br>  Non è giusto!!|`|XE2u491Faa	Kurt non ti preoccupare, cè qualcun' altro che la pensa come te!

Don't compete with her.<br>  5. Don't invade her privacy; respect it. Scorpions love their little secrets. You can't expect her to be as open as you would like her to be.

To add to that though, most definitely do not flirt with other women around her. Maintain your confidence throughout the relationship maintain a backbone and keep an air of mystery or excitement about yourself so she can stay intrigued. Also be a little freaky in the bedroom (a little bit can get you a long way) but still respect her and do the romantic thing every once in awhile. <br>  <br>  One more thing, don't try to tell her what to do or try to confine her.|`|PXfWEhsxaa	That astrology is a bunch of bunk.

RVr3K5CTaa	La saison 4 commence comme la suite de ce qu'on voit du passé dans le dernier épisode (l'épisode s'intitule : le début de la fin) : ils sont sur l'ile, l'hélico arrive mais ils s'aper?oivent que c'est Dharma (c'est pour ?a que Ben leur disait que ce n'était pas des sauveurs)<br>  <br>  Selon les rumeurs, l'explication sera donnée dans la saison : l'ile est dans une bulle temporelle dont une des entrées est dans l'antarctique, d'où la présence d'ours polaires. Quand on n'appuie pas sur le bouton, l'ile remet le compteur du temps à zéro et repart dans le passé (donc c'est cohérent avec le fait qu'ils reviennent avant d'être parti et que le père de Jack soit vivant dans le dernier épisode de la saison 3), mais à ce moment-là, il se produit une brèche. Quand Desmond a fait son erreur de manip, l'avion est entré dans une brèche.

Unsere Ergebnisse: Mit "Tri tra trullala" bringt Kasperle, von jeher schon ein nonkonformistischer Anarcho-Clown, das pers?nliche Scheitern der menschlichen Existenz auf den Punkt: Worte machen nicht wirklich Sinn mehr, nur noch dadaistische Wortfetzen, die einzig noch von reinen Kinderseelen goutiert werden, da sie sich noch nicht von der globalen Gesellschaft haben korrumpieren lassen. <br>  Die Sinnlosigkeit der menschlichen Existenz und die Wut gegen die Obrigkeit entl?dt sich in zielgerichteten Aggressionen: Kasperls Knüppelschl?ge auf den Kopf des Polizisten sind daher als Metapher der unterdrückten Kreatur zu verstehen, die gro?es Leben haben will.|`|2a612225665dcc9750bbcf2909421a31aa	ja, den gibt es noch. kasperle -theater ist doch immer wieder gut. nicht nur für die kinder. glaube auch nicht, dass der ausstirbt. kasperle wird sicherlich bis in alle ewigkeit weiterüberliefert...so wie der stuwwelpeter....|`|5bd4620d23c8179134f91df15aff2f84aa	Hall?chen,<br>  <br>  Lebt denn das alte Kasperle noch???<br>  <br>  Jaaaaaa, es lebt noch, es lebt noch, stirbt nie!!!|`|aa9970419d942b906dc42cc685094de7aa	Er lebt weiter in Kinderherzen, in unserer Fantasie und wohl hoffentlich auch noch in der Augsburger Puppenkiste.

Usually file sharing follows the peer-to-peer (P2P) model, where the files are stored on and served by personal computers of the users. Most people who engage in file sharing are also downloading files that other users share. Sometimes these two activities are linked together. P2P file sharing is distinct from file trading in that downloading files from a P2P network does not require uploading, although some networks either provide incentives for uploading such as credits or force the sharing of files being currently downloaded.<br>  <br>  COPYRIGHT ISSUES<br>  File sharing (such as with the Gnutella and Napster networks) grew in popularity with the proliferation of high speed Internet connections, relatively small file size and high-quality MP3 audio format. Although file sharing is a legal technology with legal uses, many users use it to download copyrighted materials without explicit permission: copyright infringement or "piracy". This has led to attacks against file sharing in general from some copyright owners.<br>  <br>  There has been great discussion over perceived and actual legal issues surrounding file sharing. In circumstances where trading partners are in different countries with different legal codes, there are significant problems to contend with. What if a person in Canada wishes to share a piece of source code which, if compiled, has encryption capabilities? In some countries, a citizen may not request or receive such information without special permission.<br>  <br>  Throughout the early 2000s, the entire file-sharing community has been in a state of flux. In the year 2000, there was speculation over how seriously record companies and the Recording Industry Association of America would strike the file-sharing community because of its limits compared to more traditional forms of media. However, the communities suffered strain as record companies and the RIAA tried to shut down as much of it as possible. Even though they have forced Napster and Grokster into cooperating against copyright violations, they are fighting an uphill battle since the community has flourished and produced many different clients based on several different underlying protocols. The third generation of P2P protocols, such as Freenet, are not as dependent as Napster is on a central server; and as they encrypt the shared data, it is much harder to shut down these systems through court actions. Another attempt (used by the maintainers of KaZaA) is to change the company's organization or country of origin so that it is impossible or useless to attack it legally. To date, file sharing in Canada is somewhat legal, though not completely so[4]. The uphill battle also extends to the legal actions taken by the RIAA and motion picture counterpart MPAA against individuals using file-sharing programs to distribute material protected by copyright. Ambiguity in the interpretation of copyright law has been a major factor contributing the lack of successful enforcement by the Intellectual Property owners. In Electra v. Perez for example, the Court ruled that the act of making such files available for distribution equated to infringement of the works involved. In the more recent UMG v. Lindor, Judge David G. Trager ruled that the RIAA would be required to prove that actual distribution (sharing) occurred. Should this case go to trial in 2007, it will likely set a precedent for further RIAA and MPAA actions.<br>  <br>  The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a donor-supported group which seeks to protect and expand digital rights. Its activities include litigation, political lobbying, and public awareness campaigns. The EFF has vocally opposed the RIAA in its pursuit of lawsuits against users of file sharing applications and supported defendants in these cases. The foundation promotes the legalization of peer-to-peer sharing of copyrighted materials and alternative methods to provide compensation to copyright holders<br>  <br>

vhh8kJkTaa	you might have the action too low, in that case it doesn't matter WHERE it hits, it just matter THAT it hits.  If you're not quite sure how to raise the action (i don't know how to either), take it to a reliable guitar shop and ask them to raise the action and if they say that isn't the problem, ask them what IS the problem. And ask them if they can fix it.  It won't cost much unless it's not repairable in that case you'll have to buy a new one (hopefully that doesn't happen :])  Hope I helped!

Claire's father is Nathan.  We have not met Linderman yet, but he did get Nikkie out of Prison.  Hiro's father just wanted him to come back and run his business with him (his father owns the company he and Ando worked for.)<br>  <br>  If you are looking for a recap of Heros you can always go to nbc.com or tv.com|`|12afba87062c9c06cd74aacf60f91c06aa	will tr to find a recap -- <a href="http://www.cinemablend.com/television/TV-Recap-Heroes-Chapter-14-Distractions-2683.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cinemablend.com/television/TV...</a> here's part of what it says in the recap .. Meanwhile, Claire’s biological mother makes a phone call to Claire’s real dad. The way she introduces herself on the phone, its clear that she hasn’t been in touch with him for some time. She explains that Claire is alive and it is then that we see his face – It’s Nathan. This was a popular theory that was going around (based on the watch and rolled up sleeves that we saw in the preview) but still, it is a clever twist. Not only is Claire Nathan’s daughter but this also means that Peter, who seemed to really connect with Claire when they met briefly, is her uncle .. hope this is what you're looking for ... I really get lost trying to follow the plotline of this show .. great show but confusing ..

There wasn't one guy who had anything worth showing (those other guys don't need to send out unsolicited naked pics).<br>  <br>  On one level I feel very sorry for guys like this, because they really don't have much of a life and need to rely on fantasy and anonymity for their pleasure.  I spend lots of time during the summer at the nude beach so I'm obviously not offended or shocked by the sight of a naked guy, but these anonymous pervs are just so sad.|`|fd55f91a29e97723aabb5d414bf68247aa	can you give him my email?

n57LSvzraa	Stupid people,<br>  This picture is as modified as humanily possible.

Meanwhile, just get a cheaper one and dont succumb to ego or taunts from idiots that say you must have a $3000 telecaster to learn how to play|`|6wcGwv3daa	It looks like a pretty decent beginner guitar, inexpensive with pretty nice curves, you wouldnt want to spend too much on your first guitar because you will most likely get allot of pick damage on the body because it doesnt have a pick guard : P|`|AA10753822	i haven't heard that much about it, but if you want a good guitar, buy a fender stratocaster. great for beginners. i have one. go with the guitar.

For example, you can buy savings bonds at the US Treasury.  For a fee, you can buy them at your bank.  As a business, you can invest on your own or pay an investor from the bank who is going to push the product of the month that is going to make them the most commission.  Read the Wall Street Journal, and invest on your own, if you are able.  One thing banks do provide is the Federal Depositor's insurance up to $100K, so you're protected for that amount.  Over and above $100k - invest in different banks & on your own.|`|a84a7799f01d775d961e01defa85cc29aa	Bad customer service?<br>  <br>  Long telephone waiting queues?

John Brown was into the business aspect and all the shows I watched he didnt seem to have any passion for the words that were coming out of his mouth.  None of them were good enough to get any major radio play though.|`|PIg1jz3Uaa	i think $hamrock won cause he deserved to win!

So that is why Persia should have won.|`|c1aea8c256d48edeaf017d5df5503dd7aa	Shamrock definetly deserved to win. Sulee was no where near as creative or as versatile with his word play as Shamrock or John Brown were. I was rooting for Sham and John  in the last episode but Sham came on top with a better track.

45a1015e53756570285bb0db36d3763aaa	You cant judge anyone on just their sun sign, it all goes so much deeper than that<br>  <br>  To get a true picture of your relationship you should get a compatibility chart done, with exact times, dates and places of birth<br>  <br>  Beyond Star Signs is a world of Astrology where every aspect of a Horoscope (Birth Chart) has meaning.<br>  <br>  IN GENERAL (without your birth details)<br>  <br>  Capricorn and Aquarius<br>   <br>  When Capricorn and Aquarius come together, it is a union of two people who bring out the best in each other. Capricorn has a cautious, sensible approach to life. Aquarius has an unquenchable, visionary approach to just about everything! They may appear to be absolute opposites, but once these two set their sights on a common goal they are an unswervable force.<br>  <br>  Both Capricorn and Aquarius can be stubborn and opinionated. Capricorn appreciates organization and is always looking for results. Aquarius is modern and finds routine smothering and uninteresting. Capricorn will find Aquarius exciting, yet may feel frustrated trying to find a logical sequence in their desultory, mystical mind. Aquarius will not appreciate the domineering nature of their partner, but will find the solid base that Capricorn provides to be a great support and will be relieved that someone will take care of their shared practical or business matters.<br>  <br>  Capricorn and Aquarius are ruled by Saturn, and Aquarius is also ruled by Uranus. Saturn is a cool, traditional energy. This planet is very goal-oriented and devoted to progressive thinking. Capricorn and Aquarius merge their strengths to Aquarian revolutions or Capricornian social status. Uranus is about all things different and unusual. Capricorn will show Aquarius that life is based on organization, rationality and comfort. Aquarius can teach Capricorn to be more dreamy and stand up for what they believe.<br>  <br>  Capricorn is an Earth Sign and Aquarius is an Air Sign. Aquarius moves through life through pure and independent exploration, while Capricorn looks for an end result. At times these partners may find it difficult to understand the other's perspective. Conflicts can arise in this relationship if Capricorn seems too narrowly focused or Aquarius seems too caught up in their own world and ambitions. Both partners need to learn that they navigate life's paths in different ways, and have many things to share with one another.<br>  <br>  Capricorn is a Cardinal Sign and Aquarius is a Fixed Sign. Both can be implacable, opinionated and unyielding. Both partners tend to pursue things persistently. If they have a plan, they'll stick to it until their work is finished. Capricorn prefers to generate the ideas and to dole out the assignments. Aquarius is pleased to work with Capricorn on their projects if they are given a substantial role. Conflicts may occur due to the pigheadedness of both Signs. However, if they understand they're working together for a common goal, it's much easier for them to achieve noticeable results.<br>  <br>  The best aspect of the Capricorn-Aquarius relationship is that when they decide to come together, they are an unbeatable team. This relationship will be informative, enlightening and a pleasure to both participants. Their output will be a valid asset to themselves and their community.|`|86fjMfbTaa	sorry but astrology is for fools and if that's your basis it's doomed<br>  <br>  what matters are areas of compatability<br>  romance, politics, religion, family, finances, personality, past history, etc.<br>  plus you have to love and respect eachother, and be impressed by and feel taken care of by one another|`|950fbc0fdd07e3750d2b16c89dad0dc0aa	Out in the "real world," next door neighbors often don't fully understand each other's needs, then again maybe you two could find love with the sign next to each other. When you're involved with a Capricorn, you're involved with a father figure, an executive and a task master. When you're involved with an Aquarius, you're involved with an inventor, a genius and a freedom lover. <br>  <br>  If you can give a Capricorn respect, status, power, and authority then you have a better chance of getting their love and affection. If you can give an Aquarius tolerance, choices, and something new and different, you have a greater chance of getting their love and affection. <br>  <br>  Essentially, Capricorn is cautious, steadfast and reserved. Even as a child, Capricorn's personality was probably mature for the years. With any luck Capricorn's life will get better and responsibilities will become more enjoyable over time. Capricorn can only fail by giving up. Never, never, never, never, never give up. Capricorn, you were made for management and leadership. Capricorn's ambitions are only limited by your self-esteem. Planning and work will pay off. Be sure to ask for a fair price for your efforts. <br>  <br>  Aquarius is friendly and likes people. But if the people are emotionally needy, then Aquarius needs space. Aquarius can march to the beat of a different drummer. Aquarius can have an eccentric temperament and can be just a bit strong, original, independent, unpredictable and contrary. Aquarius is well suited to become an idea person. <br>  <br>  Aquarius can become a fabulous communicator, perceptive, intelligent and highly intuitive. Aquarius is no snob or hypocrite. On the contrary, Aquarius has the potential to develop tremendous social skills. The more Aquarius adopts the "live and let live" attitude, the more friends Aquarius will make.|`|AA10039111	Thats the exact same sign combination as my parents, who have been married over 20 years and get along very well. <br>  I think you're in for a good chance.|`|AA10961241	I don't know if it's compatible or not (I only know of myself) but if you are not compatible, you should try to prove the system wrong and try anyway.|`|VPhjqlT9aa	It could also just be coincidence about your birthdays. I used to check and worry about my star sign being compatible with the guy I was with, but then I met my true love. He is a Pisces and I am Aries. According to most...these are not compatible. My mind changed. Don't look so deep into things. If you love her and she loves you...then it will all work out. Things happen for a reason and what is meant to be will be. No star sign will determine that, only you two can.

CB6ctW99aa	Zimmer produced the score for the first movie, Badelt was the one who did most of the composing.

I personally like the music from the first one better ;)|`|yzwBMTw2aa	Klaus Badelt did the first movie, while Hans Zimmer did the second. You can tell the difference between the two composers if you listen to the othr movies they have done, but i agree one or two songs from the first movei do sound like ZImmer. I think they did a good job transfering between Badelt and Zimmer, whiel using the same "tune" for some songs, but Zimmer was still able to compose some new stuff too.

AA11322117	I actually like Cash's version a bit better because of the quiet desperation in his voice.  Something about an old man singing such an angst-ridden song gives a whole new layer to the meaning of the song.  I give Reznor due credit for his work but Cash's stripped down acoustic feel creates a mood that is unmatched.  Also, Cash kind of makes the song his own by adding the religious element of his life in the song- changing the lyrics "I wear this crown of ****" to "I wear this crown of thorns."  Excellent question that I'm sure will start a good debate.|`|9e2edc13bc584b5dbeead19cad26ffb1aa	Johnny Cash|`|c47da15fdc6e17571ad7443290e6bf9baa	I love Johnny Cash, but something is just wrong with him covering a NIN song...lol<br>  <br>  I prefer the NIN version.|`|2jsSM2U9aa	i only heard nin and johnny cash----- johnny cash is better, but i fell in love with his version also cause i heard it first|`|74v0PfVbaa	Johnny Cash|`|BXZjWJ5daa	Cash|`|bcdc6827abb12ad034263463fa0905a8aa	i like the original<br>  <br>  NIN!|`|2MOc395Baa	johnny cash|`|caXAMwxnaa	Johnny Cash is awesome, and the "Hurt" cut is probably the best from that recent album he did before he died.

yLQLBqVLaa	tsunami. "Tidal wave" is a common, traditional name for the occurrence, but considered incorrect by oceanographers, seismologists and other scientists since no tides are involved. (However, "tidal" can be thought to refer to the magnitude rather than the nature or the origin of the wave.) The term "tidal wave" was much more familiar to the general public than "tsunami" before the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, but news media reports of this disaster used "tsunami" almost exclusively and so it has become better known. <br>  The crest of a tide as it moves around the Earth. These are caused by the natural gravitational pull of the sun and moon as opposed to ocean surface waves which are caused by wind friction on the surface of the water. <br>  A tidal bore, a large wave formed by the funneling of the incoming tide into a river or narrow bay.|`|crRPjrDNaa	There you go buddy!|`|6c9c24cc2f5a9fe184937330e063c86eaa	BIG <br>  BLUE<br>  CURVY <br>  GIGANTIC<br>  =<br>  MONSTER

Fyx5lXC8aa	per tutti è strano sentire la propria voce e tutti i cantanti dicono che la propria voce faccia schifo.in realtà ciò accade perchè noi sentiamo nel nostro orecchio sentiamo la nostra voce qualche tono sotto e perciò ci sembra strana.ma capita a tutti anche a me. pensavo di non saper cantare proprio io,poi una volta cantando con le amiche al karaoke la mia migliore amica mi disse che la mia voce era diversa dalla loro,vibrava e sembrava più da grande.ora faccio musica leggera col mio gruppo e canto lirico in conservatorio.vedi un po' come vanno le cose!<br>  <br>  <br>  ah per ora esercitati con van basco il karaoke.digita su google "van basco download" e apri la prima pagina mi sa e scarica.installalo e scarica un po' di midi da emule delle canzoni che vuoi cantare.le apri con van basco e fai il karaoke.|`|IKrCpFdVaa	di solito a tutti non piace la propria voce..poi beh..a dirla tutta la registrazione col cell non è proprio veritiera cmq sia allenarti lo poi fare anche sulla tromba delle scale ahah (tralaltro è un buon mezzo anche per sfogarsi)..cmq continua a coltivare la tua voce buona fortuna ciao ciao|`|Zxi44ZRWaa	Con tutto il rispetto, Avril Lavigne dal vivo fa abbastanza pena a cantare.|`|zVPIai1paa	Inannzi tutto nessuno ha a utostima di se.. e poi sopratutto la voce quando viene registrata cambia x via delle onde sonore e magnetiche che riesce a captare un cellulare.... se tutti ma dico tutti te lo dicono vuol dire che hai veramente una bella voce...<br>  X quanto tiguarda ilmmodo x sentirtela vera ... dovresti andare in una vera sala di registrazione ... solo li la senti vera vera vera vera.... ma nn so se ne hai la possobilità|`|X7QxxNf0aa	Il 99% delle persone, ascoltando la propria voce, al minimo inorridisce !! Logico e normale, perchè per la prima volta ascoltiamo "dall'esterno" il nostro timbro ed il nostro tono ! Personalmente, ho scoperto di avere discrete doti vocali (quella che molti definiscono una "bellissima voce") da ragazzino, facendo le prime esperienze nelle (allora) "Radio Libere". Trasmettere in radio mi ha permesso non solo di poter avere riscontro oggettivo da persone esterne sconosciute circa le mie ... performances vocali, ma, lavorando in cuffia, mi ha consentito di familiarizzare con la mia voce, di conoscerne le potenzialità, e di modularne i vari timbri e tonalità. Puoi tentare l'esperimento !|`|b536c8e14ed51cfe62ac9ab8ee215f46aa	Non sono d'accoprdo con le due risposte precedenti.<br>  <br>  Il fatto èche TUTTI sentono diversa la propria voce al naturale rispetto a quella recistrata.<br>  <br>  Fate questa semplice prova, parlare a voce normale e ripetete le stesse cose mettendo le mani a coppa dietro le orecchie come per sentire meglio. Sentirete una voce diversa perche diverse frequenze vengono percepite in modo diverso con o senza le mani a coppa.<br>  <br>  Questo fenomeno è accentuato sentendo la propria voce registrata.<br>  <br>  Questo a molte persone ,incluso il sottoscritto, da tremendamente fastidio.<br>  <br>  Traducendo al dittafono talvolta devo tornare indietro per correzioni o sentire dove mi ero fermato....questa operazione per me è una sofferenza.<br>  <br>  Comunque registrarsi con un cellulare non è certo il massimo !!!!

AA10463678	1. Zee Germans<br>  <br>  Typically used to poke fun at what someone said or did, to show that it is stupid.<br>  <br>  First two examples are quotes from the movie "Snatch"<br>  <br>  "What's a gun doing in your trousers?" "It's for protection." "Protection from what? Zee Germans?"<br>  <br>  "Then what happens to the rabbit?" "Well, it gets fucked." "Proper fucked?" "Yeah, before Zee Germans get here."<br>  <br>  'What's with all the locks? Afraid Zee Germans are going to rob you?'<br>  <br>  'So did you get to play?' 'No, Zee Germans did.'<br>  <br>  2.   Zee Germans   <br>    <br>   <br>  It is actually a term used to make fun of how Germans speak english.<br>  <br>  "Zee" is the inability of Germans to enunciate the 'th'.<br>  <br>  Hans-Dieter: "Zee Lederhosen were so tight JA, I could not feel zee schnitzel ?nymore!"<br>  <br>  Klaus:"Scheiss mich an, du Sau!"<br>  <br>  Trevor: "Did you hear what Zee Germans said?!<br>  <br>  Mike: They are not German, they're frickin' idiots!!!"|`|JKcV871Daa	Thee Germans. They're all French to the British people.|`|w3zCztQ2aa	He was making fun of his partner Tommy.<br>  Tommy was known for telling people he was "named after a gun", he buys a gun, and he thinks he is more of a "bad ***" than he really is.<br>  Also, buying and carrying a gun in England is really not needed (unless you need to protect yourself from gangsters).<br>  <br>  "Ze Germans" refers to the Germans in WWII. They were a threat to all European nations, and people in Europe still make jokes about "Ze Germans" as something "frightening".<br>  <br>  So, simply put, Turkish was making fun of Tommy for buying a gun because he thought there was no need for having one in their line of work.

01828ba3a2ceab3b3b6ed1d24349e9d6aa	For now...start easy and learn the basic chords until you master them. You cant inhale a whole guitar library in a few weeks? Understand? <br>  <br>  Be patient with yourself. It will take time and lots of practice for you to get good, better and then great if you practice enough down the road. Its normal for people to get frustated when learning drums or guitar or whatever you're learning.<br>  Because you get all excited and want to start playing rock or metal tunes like Metallica, or MCR or whatever.<br>  <br>  So, my adive to you is slow down...take it easy and conquer the easy chords first like<br>  E, F, G, A, B, D,...get those down first. Also..learn power chords or 5th chords. They are much easier and more simpler. I use those all the time in my songs.  I can't read standard notation or sheet music, but I learned how to read guitar tabs or tablature when I was 15. That is my guitar foundation and I continued building from there. Now....20 years later.  I write all my own songs in guitar tabs from scratch.<br>  <br>  <br>  Look...Here is an example below of a 5th chord. This is G5<br>  <br>  ___3__________________________________...<br>  ___5__________________________________...<br>  ___5__________________________________...<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  ______________________________________... <br>  <br>  <br>  You see.. your put your left index finger on the 1st string on the 3rd fret. Then, you also put your left ringfinger on the 2nd string on the 5th fret. Then you put your left pinky on the 3rd string on the 5th fret.  Understand?  This a G5...or Power Chord G . I hope this helped you undestand it a little more.<br>  <br>  You just have to keep practicing and learn the basic, give yourself time and space to make mistakes too.<br>  <br>  Also...get yourself a little $5 Guitar Chord book to carry with you so you can memorize chords when you're out and about too. They are really helpful and small enough to put in your gig bag or guitar case. Good luck to you|`|3X7hF6ssaa	Just learn the basic chords at first, you should probably be able to learn the harder chords as you get better.<br>  <br>  <br>  Using a chord chart helps, too.

Si de esas 10 diferentes posiciones, solo consideramos una, la posición del Sol...eso no sería "tu horóscopo completo...".<br>  <br>  Tu carta natal es una representación gráfica del cielo en el momento de tu nacimiento. Muestra los signos del Zodiaco, los planetas y cómo se relacionan entre si (los aspectos), así como las casas, una división matemática del espacio. Toda la interpretación del horóscopo está basada en dicha carta.<br>  <br>  Preguntas ?Crees en la astrología o el horóscopo (completo, no el de las revistas)?...mi respuesta es SI, yo creo...he estudiado mucho de ella y si es leida a conciencia si es verdad todo lo que dice ahí, pero por muy escrito que este no es suficiente. La carta te dice que caminos podrías tomar, pero no dice: "todo esto pasará quieras o no...", eso si que no es verdad. Cada uno es responzable de sus propias deciciones. Pero que esta en la carta todo el potencial que uno trae, es verdad y que puedes hacer uso de ello, pero eso depende de cada uno...espero haberte aclarado algo...cualquier duda me vuelves a preguntar...y te las aclaro un poco mas...<br>  <br>  El dibujo de la carta que se muestra en los diferentes sitios de astrología está creado de acuerdo a los datos exactos de tu nacimiento. Por lo tanto, nos muestra como estaba el cielo al momento de tu nacimiento..., las lineas de color que unen a un planeta con otros planetas y ángulos importantes de tu carta; los aspectos de los planetas al ascendente (Asc) y al medio cielo (M.C).<br>   La elección de los aspectos refleja exactamente las reglas utilizadas para la interpretación de la carta. Así se interpreta una carta astral, hay aspectos mas o menos importantes y es ahí cuando se nota la calidad del astrólogo, la intuición y el manejo "real" que se tiene de la astrología|`|K0OeiAraaa	Bueno, mirá... yo tengo una teoria a cerca de eso que me invente yo y que espero alguna vez pueda comprobar XD<br>  <br>  Si la llegas a enonctrar en otra parte avisame que quiero hablar con esa persona jaja<br>  <br>  Yo creo en la influencia de los planetas sobre la vida de la persona, aunque claro, desconfío un poco de esos HOROSCOPOS DIARIOS que no sabes de donde salieron.<br>  <br>  La razon por la que creo es porqe hay algo que esta cientificamente aprobado y es que el ser humano tiene una BIOENERGIA o un magnetismo determinado, por las cargas electricas de las celulas, segun se ordenen se peuden fotografiar y ver dicho campo magnetico... que los esotericos llaman AURA.  Por eso es distinto para cada persona y nos peude indicar ciertas cosas sobre la salud, estado de animo etc.<br>  <br>  Entonces si somos peque?os campos magnétcos, es absurdo pensar que los campos magneticos de los enormes planetas, el sol y la luna no nos van a influir en nada.<br>  <br>  Es como si pusieras un iman chiquito y otro enorme, obviamente hay fuerzas que interactuan.<br>  <br>  Es por eso que si creo en la influencia de los planteas y no asi tanto en los horoscopos diarios de las revistas.<br>  <br>  Hay que comprarse un buen libro de ASTROLOGIA y aprender uno mismo a sacar calculos jeje.<br>  <br>  Slds y mucha suerte.<br>  <br>  Que los planetas esten dispuestos a tu favor :)<br>  <br>  Millor.-

c7Zmlediaa	If you're talking about the Anime Expo in LA this year, the pre-registration hasn't started yet.  You can either buy it online when it becomes available or wait in a massive line to buy it there.  Either way, pre-reg. badge pick up and buying it "at the door," there will be a massive line.
Y4RS35M7aa	No!  Absolutely not!<br>  <br>  What did happen was that the film received a storm of protest for including that footage, which was Clinton cautiously praising the discovery of the so-called "Martian life" rocks in Antartica.  <br>  <br>  Scientists dicovered a rock that they claimed had somehow escaped the Mars gravity and made it all the way to Earth that contained some microscopic traces that may (or may not) have been left by uni-celled life forms.  <br>  <br>  In the film, Clinton appears to attend a meeting where Ellie's discovery (the radio/TV signal from space) is being discussed, and then Clinton praises the team for finding it.  He was really talking about the rocks, but the director, Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Castaway, etc) did his editing in such a clever manner, that it appeared flawless.

AA11033942	Mine doesn't look exactly like me but it's fairly accurate. I'm going to edit it again soon.<br>  <br>  The whole thing about avatars in Yahoo (well, and other sites as well probably) is that its just a representation of what you look like. I've stored about 5 or 6 different designs here that I change every so often at different times of year.<br>  <br>  Now ask the same question about your (if you have one) Nintendo Wii profile or maybe for the other consoles as well...|`|EkaX4GdAaa	It's the way I want it. If you don't like your avatar, open a 360 account, it's free. Then you can upload your favorite picture from your personal files to 360. After that you can go back to your profile in answers and change it to the 360 picture, then you should be good to go. If your picture is too small you have to crop it, and adjust the properties in paint. |`|ERRkUmWvaa	Yes, but the space between my eyebrow and eye is WAY bigger then in real life but the only other eyes are huge and make me look bug eyed or the eye brows like a psycho *****.

gnCiGSjbaa	Reese Witherspoon. She's my favorite actress and is a "southern gal" like me. It's by PG-13.|`|Or7wuZpaaa	It would be a PG-13 film with either Denzel Washington or Larenz Tate as the lead in an alien adventure film where the world is being conquered by creatures called Venators that are suck blood and infect their victims and my character has a little teenage sister he must care for. It would take place in Chicago and be called Infection! The main character Antoine Benoit is bitten by a drifter he picks up in the rain, undergoes genetic changes, and becomes a primary weapon in mankind's fight against the hideous Venator aliens whom can morph between human and insect-like alien form at will and their sole purpose is to drain their prey like a mosquito. If the person is a female playing my character then I would want either Jada Pinkett or Angela Bassett to play the role of my character because those women really know how to put power and emotion and courage into their characters. I think Larenz Tate would be an interesting choice though and the sister role could be played by Paige Hurd whom looks like my real-life 11 year old half-sister Camille and whom the sister character Lauren Benoit would be based on. Antoine joins a group of mercenaries called the Quarantine Commando Union (or Quarantine Commandos) working under the National Guard to eradicate the hideous Venators. This might sound like I Am Legend or Aliens or Blade II even but it is just a cool plot I thought of as an idea for a movie since I am writing a novel about this right now anyway-Humans vs. Venator aliens Windy City. Venator is Latin for "hunter" so I picked that word because the aliens hunt humans to suck their blood like mosquitoes. It'd be real dramatic.|`|BMri9tITaa	Ellen Page.  She looks a little like me (brown hair, pale, chipmunk-cheeked) and she plays deep-voiced, sarcastic, intelligent young women, and her most famous role is a girl who talks a little surfer, like me.<br>  <br>  The rating would be PG-13 for excess language.|`|4dQ3xu7Aaa	I gotta first say, GOOD QUESTION!  Marisa Tomay, I don't look like her  but I think they are good actress and can play comedy and drama very well.|`|UbBz9NGAaa	It depends upon when the movie was set...I am 34 so I guess if it were a movie about me presently reflecting on my younger years I would have to go with John Cusack.... without any grays.. great actor for comedy and drama and is smart witty and sarcastic like myself.   that and I have a movie poster framed of Cameron Crowes "Say Anything"|`|zIm39K97aa	Jonah Hill. When i seen superbad, I was kinda taken back from the similaries in our humor and apperance. As for the movie about my life, it would DEFF be an R rated movie. Way too much swearing, drinking and smoking weed to not be R rated.|`|AA11521270	it'd be Parminder Nagra from Bend it like Beckham & ER...it'd be a PG-13..i'm indian..& Beckham is the story of my life..lol..except for me kissing the Johnathan Rhys Meyers part..|`|45fc97cbdeaeb17e9243f4e2eb6cf440aa	Amy Adams.... she's a bit older then me but we look similar and she is a good actress  the rating would be 14A for severe language|`|rdMGWgZBaa	Kristen Stewart|`|sP8KrvA7aa	Jojo.

Misa's look is gothic lolita, so it's not that hard. By showing only head shots it seems as if you're asking if your face is identical to Misa's(and it's not, but that's expected). The hair, gloves and choker look good though. And Misa's death note doesn't have 'Death Note' written on it, it has that weird shinigami stuff.|`|4UeOIGuhaa	Yeah, you did a good job.

Let's start a revolution.|`|WuxFXpQDaa	Questions regarding sex can be asked in the men's health and womens health section.|`|oa6GJ1piaa	Because 13 year olds are aloud on here, meaning children are on here.<br>  <br>  ?|`|kRSplbHNaa	because a lot of youngins use Y!A<br>  .. if Y!A had an age requirement, then they could have stuff like that.|`|cR1M8ALyaa	Because they have to "babysit" the little kids who might go to that section.|`|gWCs7CSHaa	good fargin' question.|`|8a3822ced036f956bfbf2ffe198d7003aa	because Y!A has it in their community guidelines "no adult questions"...and between that and a lack of a section, they really expect that nobody will ask the questions...which is hilarious XD|`|991409e2f8815e4e8a645dd82791db41aa	cause they couldn't keep they kids out.. and by kids I mean 16 year olds...|`|Hy5XeA0Waa	You go girl, we need one!|`|rXbtkSBWaa	lol, I dunno, they need one for all these losers,|`|50073dbd5ecac430d78adbf7aa450341aa	because that would probably open up a whole bucket of worms.  Have you seen the arguments over in the religion section, now multiply that by 200%, and that is what would happen.<br>  On the other hand, would be very interesting, but would the questions really be about sex, or just trying to hook up.<br>  Maybe a "Adults trying to hook up" section, and no points.

PVMsr2Faaa	Sounds like you were having a fantasy relationship to me. Either you were dating or you weren't and it had to be mutual. You never went out but you were a couple.

We don't go out either, but we are a couple, at least in my mind.<br>  <br>  You know I am one of the jackasses you were talking about.<br>  <br>  Parents moved!!!

You opinion that the men where you are are all jerks could stem from the unresolved feelings of "discomfort" of a new situation.  <br>  <br>  Don't wonder about how he feels.  Decide for yourself if what you felt was love.  It was, call him and tell him and ask him if he feels the same.  You let too much go unsaid, hence your current situation.  Have an honest (if painful) conversation with him and move one once and for all either towards him or away.|`|rTtIKOmpaa	I think it's weird that you guys never became officially a couple even after 2 years.

Good Luck.|`|3SWjKcAEaa	Hi, well the best thing to do is to talk to him, face to face, about your relationship. Ask him what he wants and whether you guys want a long distance relationship or stay friends. Distance should not separate you guys....talk on the phone, chat online, etc. Visit each other once a month or something.<br>  But first, you have to talk to him! In fact, you should have talked to him before you left. Better late than never I guess.<br>  Good luck I hope it works out!|`|eOZvYxJTaa	well, all i can say is that if ya loved him, you always will. i really used to like this guy this year and i really wanted to get over him. it turns out that if you preoccupy yourself with someone else, youll get over him. it worked with me. ive liked him for two months ending last week. yea, its not long but hey, what 8th grade relationships are?|`|iU6pZmdGaa	I'd call him and ask him what he thinks about the situation. Ask him "Are we in a committed relationship?" Tell him you need some reassurance before you find interest in someone else. That will really get him saying he wants to be with only you!! <br>  If he says you're not..just date around, feel other guys out. I think there is going to be someone out there for you..you just have to be patient because no one will just pop up instantly. Good Luck!!|`|Drw4Gg1Daa	You need to talk to him and tell him how you feel.  One of my best friend's and her husband have been on/off long distance for 9 years and they make it work, because they love eachother and she works in another country half of the year.|`|Yt7OmAS4aa	if its meant to be it will be.

AA10622783	I agree with people who said Carla had no confidence. BUT Casey is also one hot mess and totally ruined it for her! Yeah, yeah I know Carla shouldn't have listened to her but Casey should have kept her mouth shut. Marcel and Richard are big personalties too and did not interfere with Hosea's or Stephan's decisions.<br>  <br>  Funny thing is when Carla started to emerge as a contender she kind of reminded me of Casey. But I was wrong! Carla's lows were NEVER as low as Casey's and Casey's highs were NEVER as high as Carla's. This competition was Carla's to lose. If she hadn't listened to Casey she would have won I have no doubts about that.|`|21fee98831946197f4886f287f0a38c1aa	Carla had a good chance at winning.  She should not have listened to Casey. Sadly the pressure got to her and she let Casey call the shots.|`|3L9bRmOqaa	When Carla had the last pick of who her helper would be, I KNEW it would be that witch Casey and I was correct.  I KNEW that Caesy would bully her way to making Carla choose a dish.  Darn!  I wish Carla stuck to her guns and was more assertive.  She blew it!|`|ciXSjbCiaa	Carla is too nice, too passive and doesn't know how to say "no". Casey should have known her "place" but she seemed very aggressive and intent on throwing Carla off her natural course. If I had been her soux chef, I would have taken on a passive role; unfortunately Carla suffered because of her humbleness. <br>  <br>  But I still love her all the same:)!|`|I7gOLwQbaa	I think that Carls just did not have enough confidence. She took a suggestion and second guessed herself. She sjould have known that what brought her that far was cooking her way and having confidence in her skills and then at the finale she loses a back bone and does things she knew werent right. So mad at her. wanted her to win so bad. She will go far though. I hope she will be a celebrity chef. I was disgusted that Hosea won. he is a PUSSYcat. PITA. Pain In The ***. All he did was cry. I was so irritated like when Houng won. He was irritating too.|`|cd5e6845894c4a2b40cc9c337f23b171aa	you betcha....i believe casey wanted to steal some of carla's thunder by influencing her decision to alter her menu.  unfortunately, carla was too compensating toward casey and it cost her the title.|`|rNIFQKF9aa	Carla is the one who ultimately made the call on her dishes she is saying she does not even think of blaming Casey for anything. I think everyone else should do the same.|`|p9Dpths5aa	Ooooo I'm so disappointed that Carla didn't win!  I couldn't watch the finale until this evening and I was just sure Carla would win! Do I think Casey is to blame? Unfortunately no, she did have opinions/suggestions and we all know she blew it more than once when she was competing but ultimately Carla lacked the backbone to make Casey a subordinate.  Hosea should not have won. He was hanging on by the skin of his teeth and dumb luck through most of the show.  And I have to say that LEAH! What a HOMEWRECKER!!!|`|p3w7KKGXaa	Casey, Casey, Casey why?!?!! Carla had a great chance of winning but casey put way to much input into CARLA'S menu. Even though you may think carla should have not allowed casey to make the changes, Casey in the first place should have taken a BACKSEAT its not her at stake its Carla. Im really mad at Casey:( Carla should have won she was on a roll before the finale.|`|nY8BVJP2aa	umm i wish i did, but i dont!  i wish that she been super bossy and mean and whatnot, but all she did was calmly say her opinion, and carla jumped all over her ideas.  i mean come on, doin a cooking method uve NEVER done for the final meal?  what were u thinking, carla?  so sad... i really like her.|`|e27fe1a9205b53137b4cbd03b8a47947aa	Carla was a better cook than what was done on the finale. Carla lacks confidence in herself. Casey is not to blame for Carla's failure. Stefan should have won. Or Fabio. Or Jeff.|`|K1YHSR3oaa	I think Carla's extraordinarily kind personality put her at a disadvantage because she wanted to please Casey by trusting her.  I wish Carla would have gone with her gut.  I felt so sorry for her.  :-(|`|B94YE68Raa	i agree that THAT was friggin lame!!!!!! <br>  <br>  it was nice how stephan wiped her tears. he showed a lot of heart in the finale.

BPNDa95Laa	LOL.<br>  <br>  Those are just sayings.  It doesn't actually mean that you feel incredible spasms in your chest that put pressure on where to go. <br>  <br>  lol...<br>  <br>  The word "heart" is used in many ways.  Yes, it is an organ.  But it is also a word that means a feeling, or a thought direction, or a metaphor for "soul", etc..<br>  <br>  Like if somebody were to say "run with those feet!"  well you run with your legs, but who cares right?  or "use your head"  well i'm not actually going to hit my head on the table to build it, but use my intelligence and knowledge to build it.  <br>  Just phrases. |`|EXlXNHuQaa	a lot of people think that your feelings come from inside your heart. i dont know where that came from. but the brain does a lot of feelings and everything. the heart just makes the brain function so i agree with your statement|`|1hgnMtT9aa	Good point, i agree with your statements :)|`|97NuUmtCaa	well i never thought that way but i agree to you.|`|oXKrT3Q7aa	Your brain doesn't release adrenaline, your adrenal glands do. Although this is stimulated by the pituitary which is in the brain.<br>  <br>  It's just a figure of speech, we all know that our heart is just an organ designed to circulate and oxygenate blood.<br>  <br>  You are correct about the stomach though.|`|NTKeyWaNaa	jmm it doesnt matter really . . .<br>  in that case, by the way, the heart signals love; not some organ.|`|e7Wpm0afaa	I ignore both head and heart, FLB, and only ever follow my groin.<br>  I've been doing this my entire adult life and in some 80 plus years it's never steered me wrong.<br>  Good luck!|`|FC0CPzv3aa	girl u just did enough thinking for both of us..Ill jsut take my 2 points and sit here quietly lol|`|nXSpS3Axaa	Yep, I must agree with you on that.|`|AA11033942	Your question also opens up the gap between the masculine and feminine thinking processes. <br>  <br>  Obviously your brain calculates HOW to do stuff, but in many cases its your heart that determines WHAT you do. Love and emotions start battles that are completely unpredictable and makes your heart, brain and wallet compete for supremacy...<br>  <br>  Biologically and physiologically, yes you're correct, but the human body is far more complex than just a series of cells, tissue, muscles, blood vessels etc. If that's all it was then the term broken hearted would be a misnomer (which in a sense, it is) because if your heart is broken then you'd be dead.<br>  <br>  Let me say one other thing about the brain that has become apparent to me a lot more recently, and that's some people don't tend to use theirs very much, and others don't seem to engage their brain before clutch off and foot on the mouth's gas pedal.<br>  <br>  I may need to be corrected,but essentially there's a quote I think is from Confucius, and it says "Wise man prove himself wise by not saying anything, idiot prove himself when opening mouth" !! Look at the leader of the western world (George W Bush) and well, many politicians but him especially....

And Yep it is coming outin 2009 unfortunately =/ *|`|JLT87CXraa	umm i think that harry potter and the guy that plays him dosent want to finish the movie but idk|`|ok6q1Lanaa	forget about harry potter butmy sisters say that twilight is better than harry potter|`|70xVYTYlaa	i think the person who plays harry potter got sick so the had to delay the movie|`|H1EFtjy7aa	there filming another film at the moment.|`|lLU9GXteaa	Harry POtter is coming out in July, they moved it because of the writers strike and they didnt want to movies that are going to be huge out at the same time.|`|JHOlfb1jaa	LOL. Death Threats?<br>  <br>  How awsome would a fight be between HP & Twilight people. HP fans would be running in with twigs in there hand and a wooden broom shouting random spells, then the Twilight fans would just be walking with baseball bats and knives lol, it would be the funniest thing...|`|WMNbGsoWaa	No, no. Half Blood Prince was going to come at during the same week as Twilight. They knew they wouldn't make as much money with all the hype on Twilight, so they changed the release date to summer 09'. There was even a HP preview before the Twilight movie in theaters.|`|V1hxvQukaa	harry potter and the half-blood prince got pushed back to the summer of '09. <br>  <br>  i thought it was because warner bros. wanted a big summer hit, and HP is definitely going to rake in some money...|`|8e373a7bc6b3c784f2bae9cc02a6cf20aa	The next Harry Potter movie is supposed to be out in the summer.|`|nrnVqh7iaa	Once I found out that Dumbledore was gay, I lost all interest in the series.
mSKeN7OLaa	Edit your listing. It's saying you are charging too much for shipping.<br>  <br>  What are you trying to ship?<br>  <br>  Can you change the shipping to calculation because then you wouldn't have to worry about it. It would be based on weight. <br>  <br>  Plus you do have the right category for it?|`|AA10275738	It means <br>  the seller is only allowed  3.99 for the shipping. Agree to pay for the higher shipping rate.   |`|FBGMKdqKaa	Means you have to lower your shipping price to $4.00 or less. <br>  They've caught on to sellers trying to rip buyers off with ridiculously high  shipping prices. |`|md40OlCUaa	your shipping service is $4 too much<br>  come on! i'm 13 and i got that! -__-|`|sKeClOsDaa	Argue with the cargoman!

Now Blink 182 has top hits like I Miss You, Adams Song, Feeling This, etc.  They have had so many #1 hits that they deserve to be recognized as one of rocks best bands.  Since their latest cd however, one band member was in a horrible plane accident and is currently in the hospital.  The other band members seem to be mad at each other, so sadly one of the greatest bands is at its end.  <br>     Now, whether you think they are a good band or not is up to your taste in music.  If you like the sound of rock and a band with very deep lyrics of love, you will really enjoy blink-182.  I encourage anybody to listen to them.  their lyrics are so true, and the music is so great and famous.  My personal favorite, Stay Together for the Kids.  I hope this was able to help you decide whether or not you will like them.<br>    <br>     P.S.  Most there Cd's are parental advisory for  few accounts of cursing.<br>  |`|5aKBB2gfaa	They are "ok" -- you could do worse but you could also do a lot better.<br>  <br>  For the record, I like the songs "Dammit" and "M&Ms" and "Stay together for the kids"  Enema of the state is one of the first albums i bought and listened to a whole lot.  I bought "californication" by the red hot chili peppers at the same time and found the Blink 182 record to be much more enjoyable, if it says anything about their standing in the history of rock.|`|7o5tXgc5aa	**** yeah.<br>  <br>  they got a song for everything.<br>  <br>  serious songs, funny songs, fast paced songs, slow songs.<br>  <br>  <br>  why wouldn't i like them?|`|AVfRSj9taa	YES. <br>  Idc what anyone has to say, they're awesome.|`|ceee3d5ea77b72ba319785cd375855c0aa	that is completely a matter of opinion, but yes i like them|`|Rt4OfE6Naa	Yeah They Rock!!!|`|ZDVMOZf3aa	yes they are really good<br>  
PfhgAI4Jaa	Linkin Park owns Marilyn Manson. |`|UDAeKt7Eaa	I hate Linkin Park, but Marilyn Manson is awesome.|`|UnsZKr4saa	Early Linkin Park.<br>  <br>  It's become clear to me that all TD trolls are also Marilyn Manson fanboys.<br>  <br>  *MaDiSoN*: I salute you.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	I've seen interviews with both...heard their music...noticed the extreme differences in each one style and everything. <br>  <br>  I don't understand why the linkin park fans got so many thumbs down. I actually am shocked and a bit disappointed...i thought people knew better to respect both of them...I respect both Manson and LP for the sucess they have had and the passion and love they have for this music industry. They both make great music and in most cases shouldn't be compared. Like someone mentioned it's two extremes. ...but as musicians and great ones at that...i wouldn't be able to choose who is better. They both are a big part of the music industry and work really hard on what they love. I did see Linkin Park in concert...It was amazing...and they have great music. I also have a cassette of Marilyn Manson...so for me it goes both ways. I can't choose. |`|GhI9wYUiaa	hmmmmmmm....tough...id say...can i use a shout out?|`|7B2s7maWaa	Linkin Park |`|TeJuytjZaa	LINKIN PARK!!!!!|`|fGpAU0xwaa	This is the equivalent of saying... <br>  <br>  "Which is a better rock band, Jonas Brothers or Miley Cyrus?"<br>  <br>  <br>  No soup for you!<br>  |`|pLPKo6mBaa	Personally, I like Marilyn Manson better. This is like comparing apples and oranges though.|`|wXloRCegaa	Those are two extremes!!!  I'd have to say Marilyn Manson.  I've never liked those winy boys from Linkin Park.  Hell, Manson should have even done some songs with Jay-Z!|`|i0eMTHVnaa	Marilyn Manson|`|BzP0JX1caa	Are you people serious???<br>  Manson BY FAR.<br>  No comparison.|`|AA10795350	I'm honestly not a huge fan of either, but I have more respect for Marilyn Manson.|`|AmfN9KPHaa	omg, Linkin Park all the way! They are a band that has changed lives! :}<br>  <br>  ?|`|oYIpW9Ypaa	Linkin Park|`|jKCw9r0zaa	DId you seriously ask that question? Ok, lets start with the basics. I'll give Linkin Park credit for having all their original members and coming up with something original at the time. I'll also give them credit for selling out at the highest degree by teaming up with Jay-Z. It wasn't for their fans, it was for the money and a chance to gain a new "fan base" in the rap community/main stream music community. Now they continue to make mediocre music at best. Marilyn Manson I guess you could just consider him more an artist than a band since for the most part the drummer/guitarist/bassist/keyboardist don't really matter (not putting them down or anything, but they've had many different members, but it's not Marilyn Manson without Manson). But look at all Manson has done. He's been banned from Pittsburgh for "violating" a security guard, he's been called the Anti-christ, he's been used as a scapegoat for the church and all society for years. All because he has a message and stops at no length to deliever it. Never has he changed lyrics or his performance just to appease "the man" and get more fans. He started out original and continues to be true in a world full of sheep. <br>  <br>  Now, listen to Shadow of the Day by Linkin Park then Great Big White World or Coma White by Marilyn Manson and then you tell me which band is better.|`|uPyiIKivaa	is everybody really high? who in there right mind can like linkin park?<br>  those guys suck a lot of *** holes! i stopped listing to them after there first annoying cry baby song came out, and totally forgot about them until i came across this question. they probably put out 2 or 3 cd's, and now where are they?<br>  Then you have Marilyn Manson who as been out 16+years, and put out 8+ albums, everyone completely different from the last, and still coming up with new material.<br>  choosing between the two is like choosing to drink beer over toilet water<br>  plus the fact that i know old women who listen to linkin park creeps me out, i don't know any old women who listen to marilyn manson<br>  |`|sZwGlfsbaa	Manson pisses better music than Linkin Park. Manson actually has something to say. He does it in a way to shock and get your attention and you can not ignore him. He does these amazing concept ablums, and each album is new and different. <br>  <br>  Linkin Park is just  very juvenile and doesn't seem to have anything genuine to say. its not believable and its just boring old rap-rock. |`|ZLh7goJJaa	Marilyn Manson, hands down.|`|XTHmWkhWaa	i like linkin' park. its sounds better in my opinion and it dealsw ith ppl lives.|`|kO3U06h1aa	marilyn manson is the best :)|`|AIhL8wLkaa	Honestly, it's LP<br>  <br>  Manson isn't bad...but his image scares the living crap out of me.|`|1ovWmBoyaa	Linkin Park :]]|`|lSQaJvcoaa	LINKIN PARK!!|`|lW0WvL3raa	Linkin Park |`|lZ1GDZp9aa	LINKIN PARK|`|RTqkBX0Oaa	I don't like either of them but if I had to pick one I'd say Linkin Park.|`|N8bZuaV6aa	linkin park|`|aWbhfgyXaa	linkin park|`|9KsY2vEKaa	Linkin Park, wayyyyy.
31e3aeeef48254ed515aa846df344c44aa	I waited to see it on DVD and forgot most of the hoopla (great word, eh?).  It had some good shudders, and the SFX were good -- so overall, I liked it.  <br>  <br>  But then again I liked The Blair Witch Project, so what do I know?|`|6Gm7TFQ4aa	The characters in the movie were so unlikable that I found myself thinking "When will they all hurry up and die already?!". It made for a long, torturous ordeal. |`|iYGBHO0jaa	i thought the whole movie was pretty realistic, if for some crazy reason we would really get attacked by aliens :]<br>  <br>  and i didn't feel like crying, but it definitely wasn't a feel-good movie.|`|AA10783780	??? Seriously?<br>  Well I enjoyed it. A good monster movie, and I heard they're coming out with a sequel (the same scenario, but a different person's point of view). |`|JRiqDH0Saa	It's the best Godzilla movie yet.|`|oMuruvkMaa	I felt empty - but only beacause it didnt live up to the hype|`|lQxcoMLcaa	If you are looking for that "empty" feeling,  watch "The Mist"|`|QT8oQ1IMaa	yes ive seen it.

Might not be appropriate for the average 14-year-old. Also, I fell asleep while watching it (it wasn't that funny). I think Dane Cook is funny while doing stand-up comedy, but he cannot carry a movie.|`|btrMdy5Uaa	I think its too adult for a 14 yr old, its about a guy who, when he sleeps with a girl the girl just happens to find the man of her dreams, not him, and get married, hence, Good Luck Chuck|`|2Ys6pUg9aa	It has a lot of sex in it so maybe you would not want to buy it for her, but the content was good. I personally love the movie.|`|Q6hMOR12aa	It's extremely inappropriate with plenty of lewd scenes and some nude shots of Dane Cook. In fact, the movie sucks crap and is inappropriate for all ages, but hey, if you want your 14 year old sister to see nude shots of Dane Cook and expose her, yourself and everyone else attending her party to the horrific film known as Good Luck Chuck, then by all means.|`|sPRaPt6Maa	The movie is very inappropriate.

Nv3eQenUaa	In Greek Myra means myrrh-- one of the Gifts of the three kings to the Christ child.    A person with that name is blessed and honored with heavenly gifts.    So it is a pretty cool name for a child.    |`|AA11033942	If you think about it (and so far none of the respondents who have answered so far seem to have done so) but the name Myra - or if you want to spell it differently, Mira  - are both a shortened from of the name Miriam.<br>  <br>  I like that name, it was my grandmothers name and in some cultures you name an offspring after a departed relative, and when I get married and if I have a daugher, then might just use this name for her.<br>  <br>  Try starting here... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Given_names" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Gi...</a> <br>  <br>  Alternatively (this text also from Wiki) Myra, a female given name in the English-speaking world. Created by the 17th-century poet Fulke Greville. He possibly based it on Latin myrrha, meaning "myrrh". Myrrh is a fragrant resin obtained from a tree<br>  <br>  So in a word YES but as for the second part of your question... There is no way of answering that because for one its as daft as asking what do you think of Dave?  or Jane? etc etc. Different people with the same name will always be completely different peorsonaities, based on other familial and environmental factors.|`|StsTnMoPaa	I don't like it much, I have a cat named Mya and an ex of mine used to call her Myra.|`|AA10390256	I really love the name MYRA!!|`|NxduWqKRaa	It reminds me of America's Next Top Model; it's reminds me of Tyra.|`|zsnKf57Maa	I love it!

wtQY6VEwaa	I agree about the anime part, but i dont think sci-fi ever died.|`|Q6hMOR12aa	I'd say Akira was a groundbreaking film in that the animation was groundbreaking. It apparently didn't reuse frames like other cheap cartoons which was why the expressions looked so life-like and realistic. However, beyond that, I felt the story itself wasn't anything spectacular. It seemed more like a rushed summary of events and some of the elements didn't make sense. I realize that it's based on the Akira manga which I have had the pleasure of reading and that it would have been impossible to fit so much story into a short film, however it felt a bit like watching Mortal Kombat or the first Street Fighter film. What I mean is that it seemed like they were trying to fit in every character from the manga without any rhyme or reason. Some characters appeared for a couple of minutes and made to look significant and then blown to bits.

DKcUHiP7aa	TF1 Hésite à passer Heroes, les audiences ont été faibles l'été dernier, et la saison 2 s'est ramassée aux USA, il est probable qu'il n'y ai pas de saison 3, et TF1 n'aime pas diffuser des séries avortées (comme la 6 avec Tru calling, John Doe, Jeriko, ...).|`|c968c89b0481d11b783f26d37ae531b0aa	Aucune idée, je l'ai déjà vu, et il n'y a eu qu'une dizaine d'épisodes à cause de la grève.<br>  Si Heroes a eu une mauvaise audience, c'est peut etre car elle a été diffusé le samedi soir...

OUqRcvJFaa	Yo no soporto las cartas cadena.  No sé porqué la gente las envía.  Quizás ellos/as piensen que eso le agrada a Dios.  Yo pienso que Dios estaría mas compacido, si la persona en cuestión invirtiese su tiempo en ayudar a las demas personas, a los desvalidos y a los mas necesitados.  O sencillamente con hacer el sacrificio de no decir malas palabras por una semana o un mes.  ESO sí sería mas difícil para dicha persona, que estar enviando cartas cadena y robandole el tiempo a a sus parientes, amigos y conocidos, con esas supersticiones.<br>  <br>  Y a los que les gusta enviar cartas cadena, les ruego, les imploro: ?ya NO LO HAGAN POR FAVOR!   Con estar enviando esas dichosas cadenas, les aseguro, NO SE VAN A GANAR LA GLORIA NI EL FAVOR DE DIOS.  Mejor hágan algo en favor de su parroquia, su congregación o su comunidad.  Involoucrense más en su iglesia, y déjense de esas cosas que son pura superstición.  A mi me enviaron una en la que me decián (y esto es veridico), que si no seguía la cadena, se me hiban a podrir los genitales.  Yyyyyy pss no ocurrió, de lo cual yo estaba plenamente seguro que no hiba a suceder en todo caso.  Pero qué mala vibra es siquiera desearle algo tan nefasto a alguien que se negase a seguir con una superchería.<br>  <br>  En fin.  No, no me gusta que me los manden, ni por coreo terrestre, ni por e-mail;  a mi me desagrada mucho que me manden esas cartas cadena, sobre todo aquellas que amenazan con un límite de tiempo, como mandarselos a 15 de tus amigas/os en 20 minutos.  Ya parece que yo voy a estar desperdiciando mi tiempo haciendo esas tonterías e importunando a mis seres queridos y amigos/as.

uKXgg9heaa	She's a young girl give her a break! Jordan Sparks use to vote for her friends instead of herself as well!|`|SFDCB2Xsaa	No, she wasn't affected by the other groups outcome. It didn't make her look foolish at all.|`|2ab0f4f84a201bc39a3fb4a1b64db222aa	i dont think she's stupid. she has a great voice although her performance wasn't the best last night.|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Unless she just wanted the ratings to stay up with extra votes across the board, it was silly to us to hear her say that.  Though I didn't quite want to believe her, hoping she was just trying to sound like she supported everyone and didn't want to call faves yet, out loud anyway.|`|btrMdy5Uaa	I somewhat agree with the guy above me, but I also agree with you....whats the point in even voting if your just going to vote for everyone, it defeats the purpose|`|wFMhmZCYaa	She probably said it be nice or did it to be a nice person <br>  She has a great voice though|`|pDmTRG82aa	she is stupid but not for voting for other contestants though. 1 vote alone wont change the results.<br>  <br>  but I do think she among virtually 95% of the other contestants are stupid for choosing all the wrong songs. in my opinion the whole "well I had fun onstage" thing is just an excuse or another way of saying "I didnt take this opportunity seriously and I sabotaged my chances and /i dont want to admit it"|`|e12a1f2ed505be8021ede0df33b7238faa	What's dumber is picking the song she did.  Randy was right, she should have sang Rihanna, it's much more her style and she could have shown off her vocals.  She's actually very good, she just picked the worst song possible to prove it.|`|e27fe1a9205b53137b4cbd03b8a47947aa	Probably just nervous and going for the brownie points.|`|5W3S2PvJaa	no she isnt|`|c4RT0sFOaa	yep i agree... although she's not stupid! she just trying to be nice for the american public :P hehe

This is one of my favorite songs from the sixties.I saw The Animals perform this one live.<br>  (Yes is old)<br>  <br>  The Animals did perform the song on TV here in the USA.The show was called "The Ed Sullivan Show" 10/18/64<br>  <br>  The group also performed the hit on a  TVshow called "Hullabaloo."|`|f2c03d5c2b6c415dede17268613279ecaa	It was recorded for a single record and later appeared on a LP.  It is a version of a traditional blues song which was also on an early Bob Dylan record around the same time.<br>  <br>  It has not been used on any film sound tracks to my knowledge, but has been in a couple of TV shows including The West Wing.  The Animals also performed it in a number of pop or variety shows.|`|35ccc8ce58bda98ad049f1093b5a126aaa	It was issued as a single.  No programme/film was involved, although they appeared on TOTP/Thank Your Lucky Stars, etc, performing the song.|`|a47cAPypaa	Remember the record, but not the film.<br>  Used to listen to record at a Pub called Rising Sun whilst on holiday.

Besides Kakashi has told Naruto after killing Kakuzu that he became stronger than him so there is nothing left he could teach him. Concerning Hinata she still has to prove something (mainly to her family).That's why I think she's alive.<br>  But after all she's a property of Kishimoto. He can do whatever he wants with her. We will be fixed in the 438th or 439th chapter.|`|X45rxI7gaa	I really doubt she's dead because she is a main character in the series. But if she is, then the wait for the NaruHina pair was for nothing. Kakashi, I really don't see how he's dead, it's clear he'll be back.|`|stYO4Q1Haa	wow what a question.<br>  when i read that part my heart sunk a few levels, lost my appitite and lost tons of sleep trying to figure out why?<br>  <br>  hinata had just confessed then attacked just to defend naruto. <br>  <br>  i don't think she dead because she has been in a lot worse situations and still survived. what about her battle with neji during the chunin exams. and the search for the bukoichi. there were times where she almost yet pulled through in the end.<br>  <br>  kishimoto isn't a fool to let even one of the main characters die hinata might not have had alot time on the manga compared to other characters but now her character has reached greater importance than ever. she is apart of the konaha 11 why kill them off, if that is the case then pain should have killed choji as well|`|0uCu6xsVaa	Well if Hinata were to die, I think it would be close to the same as when whats his face killed Asuma. I mean Didn't they show asuma getting stabbed to death. And Kakashi. They showed the nail going through him. They only showed Hinata's body when she was unconsious and nothing else.|`|ligmlWpgaa	its not clearly seen yet that she died,so theres still a chance.i think she would be badly injured,but not dead.

I love Page's guitar playing on both of those two albums.  I pick Led Zeppelin I over Led Zeppelin 2 by a hair.|`|NQ37mnWkaa	I never can decide, since my favourite songs come from across the lot of them... <br>  <br>  I would actually by cheeky and say it is this compilation : "The Remasters". <br>  But if I had to pick a studio album, probably "Led Zeppelin II"|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	I like Physical Graffiti|`|ONWCXzUMaa	I believe the First, but they are all pretty  much equal.<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|0a88332d968993b9b9d62ec94243eb24aa	The only CD I own by Led Zeppelin is Zoso/IV. Only because I like the songs Stairway to Heaven, Black Dog and Rock'n Roll. I never liked Led Zeppelin because of their singer Robert Plant. For some reason his voice is terribly annoying to me. Like chalk on  a board. Sorry this is just my personal taste and I like their music in general.<br>  <br>  That is why I am very grateful to Smiley for having introduced me to Vanilla Fudge " Out through the in door "  as now I can finally enjoy Led Zeppelin. That is a fantastic album and my fave  cover is Ramble On.|`|srtoPxN2aa	Hard to decide, though I think for me it would be their first album (self titled). <br>  Led Zeppelin II was great also, but not quite as consistent, and didn't flow as evenly as the debut IMO.<br>  My second choice for a favorite is possibly Led Zeppelin III...as I remember really enjoying the nice mix of acoustic numbers, hard rock and blues.<br>  <br>  I don't really care all that much for "Zoso/IV" anymore, though it did have a few excellent songs. I guess it was the most overplayed of their albums back in the day, and that sort of ruined it for me I think.<br>  <br>  This is so difficult..wow. I'd say for the post "Zoso/IV" period, my choice would be either 'Physical Graffiti', or 'Presence'...as both were very strong albums in my opinion. <br>  As for 'In Through the Out Door'? Well I think a more appropriate title should have been, 'In Through The Outhouse Door'...as I felt that's how bad it stunk in comparison to their previous works.<br>  <br>  So yeah...I'm sticking with Led Zeppelin's first...self titled.<br>  <br>  You should check out the 'Vanilla Fudge' album titled 'Out Through the In Door', released in 2007. Great reunion album, and homage to the mighty Zeppelin, and they cover may of their classics. Pretty cool, considering Led Zeppelin used to open shows for them, and were hugely influenced by the Fudge. They take each Zeppelin number, and make it their own, as only the Fudge can do, courtesy Mark Stein(Hammond/keyboard/synth/lead vocals), Carmine Appice(drums/vocals), Tim Bogert(bass/vocals), and Vince Martell(guitar/vocals). If any other band had attempted this, I doubt I would have enjoyed it. The members of Led Zeppelin and Vanilla Fudge have a tremendous amount of respect for one another. Very cool...considering these guys were in their early - mid 60's at the time of recording this album...here's a few songs:<br>  <br>  Dazed and Confused:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/music/dDHX-sZw/vanilla-fudge-dazed-and-confused/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/musi...</a><br>  Dancing Days:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/music/ZMIgSEQa/vanilla-fudge-dancing-days/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/musi...</a><br>  All Of My Love:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/music/FqwLg5D-/vanilla-fudge-all-of-my-love/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/musi...</a><br>  Trampled Underfoot:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/music/9eNj2wfX/vanilla-fudge-trampled-underfoot/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/musi...</a><br>  Black Mountain Side:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/music/jfgWmQN5/vanilla-fudge-black-mountain-side/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/musi...</a><br>  Immigrant Song:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/music/IviTZSD-/vanilla-fudge-immigrant-song/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/musi...</a><br>  Your Time Is Gonna Come:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/music/P9-tukVy/vanilla-fudge-your-time-is-gonna-come/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/musi...</a><br>  Fool In The Rain:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/music/i8luMSPe/vanilla-fudge-fool-in-the-rain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/musi...</a><br>  Ramble On:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/music/T60CzB35/vanilla-fudge-ramble-on/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/musi...</a>|`|JmzHvt71aa	Physical Graffiti<br>  <br>  The various styles covered on that album are ridiculous for any band.

Jhpiy5lFaa	usually that kind of situation is solved by auditions. but since you worte the script why dont you politely bring up the situation with your director. it never hurts to ask right? it's not who wrote what, it's who can do the best of their abilities at something they are given.|`|LMFOUJZhaa	you should do it, great opportunity, especially if you wrote the character for you.  whats the movie going to be called?|`|cIqpL3tGaa	nope.com|`|Q6hMOR12aa	Yes, do the role and fire him!

Good luck!|`|OQVcemHdaa	When you have given your script or in fact sold your script to a studio, you may or may have some leigh way as to whether or not you have a part in the film.  If it's an Independent film, you can certainly act in it on your own.   Do you believe that your acting skills and ability can truly bring to light the character that you are trying to portray, better that a more experienced actor or actress?  If that is the case then you should go to the matresses for it.<br>  <br>  A film company/production company that sees that you have no previous acting experience may want to have you audition for the part in the film llike any other actor to see whether you are fit for the part.  If they have bought the rights to the film, they have the right to decide who may act in it.|`|F1uo6nzvaa	Well, I wouldn't suggest being a producer/director yourself in it if you want to be the main character. You'd have to get a producer and a director that work well together, and see if they both agree to you as the character. I'm trying to begin my career in acting myself, but it's hard because I'm young and have school. In my opinion, since you are the writer you should get some say on how the cast comes out.

211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	I had never heard the song before, so I played it.  As a lyricist, I can only tell you what I think.  It sounds like as much as they love each other, they hurt each other all the time - thats why they have bruises.  And its almost like they are proud of them... they are o.k. with the fact that they are hurting over each other (not the healthiest of relationships! - LOL!!)  But, she does love him.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I checked back here, as I commonly do with my answers... everything that Lacey wrote is what is on the songfacts page.  It does not answer your question directly.  Also, she simply cut and paste exactly what the site said.  Just thought I'd let you know.<br>  <br>  Check out the link below - it really doesn't say much, but it might help.  Good Luck!!|`|J05WTQwPaa	Chairlift are an electronic pop trio based in New York, consisting of guitarist Aaron Pfenning, vocalist Caroline Polachek and keyboardist Patrick Wimberly.<br>  <br>  This song about falling in love became a surprise hit after featuring in an Apple iPod Nano-Chromatic commercial.<br>  <br>  Caroline Polachek told the NME December 13, 2008 about the recording of this song: "We actually recorded two studio versions of it with a producer, and we didn't like either of them. All of us just had this gut feeling that it wasn't right. So in the last two days before we had to hand over the final mixes, we spent those two nights in Patrick's basement in Brooklyn, pulling all-nighters, recording 'Bruises' the way we wanted it to be. We gave it to our producer and he was like, 'Are you joking?' In fact he actually said, 'if you want the good Pitchfork review, use your version. If you want the iPod commercial, use my version.' And as it was, we used our version, got slammed by Pitchfork and got an iPod commercial."<br>  <br>  Other songs that came to peoples attention after featuring in an iPod advertisement include The Ting Tings' "Shut Up and Let Me Go", Feist's 1234 and The Asteroids Galaxy Tour's Around The Bend.
RUoXZmYFaa	I read the same article in Newsweek regarding "Exterminating Angel" and I found it very interesting.  It made me want to see it.<br>  <br>  I've seen Un chien andolu (An Andalusian Dog), the collaboration between Bunuel and Dali - I'm assuming that's the one you speak of.<br>  <br>  Both films are available on Netflix (see links in source area below).<br>  <br>  My personal favorites of Bunuel are "Le Journal d'une femme de chambre" (1964) and "La Mort en ce jardin" (1956).  "The Young One" (1960) is also good.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't know if this is the answer you're looking for, but I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Good to hear of another surrealist fan out there!|`|aYNoQvfMaa	Un Chien Andalou, and L'Age D'or are the two he made with Dali. Both are very interesting, and very good (Un Chien's better). Bunuel's a bit difficult because he had a large period of his career where he made basically Hollywood films, and didn't make any true surrealist films.<br>  <br>  Viridiana (fantastic film, but not surrealist)<br>  The Milky Way<br>  Simon of the Desert<br>  Diary of a Chambermaid<br>  those are my favourites (other than Un Chien)<br>  <br>  pretty much everything after Viridiana (The Exterminating Angel, Diary of..., Simon..., The Milky..., The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, The Phantom of Liberty, The Obscure Object of Desire) is very highly respected and good surrealist fair. The only two in this time not surrealist films are Belle De Jour, and Tristiana.<br>  <br>  If you want to see his films look on youtube (shitty quality, but it's free). Check your library too, it's free and may have one or two of his films. check out the auteurs, too. They have at least one or two.<br>  <br>  Nice call on Jan Svankmajer. Very interesting form of genius. You've seen Faust, right? You've had to have seen Faust.<br>  <br>  I too am pleased he still makes films. In Fact I'm happy every great active filmmaker is still active and making films!

However, sometimes women get bent when they see their guy just talking to another female.  I try to treat all people on friendly terms, men and women.  I always say, if you're the one I'm coming home to then you should trust that you are the only one.|`|dkEUJPhnaa	No, but I'd probably be able to tell if he had a flirty nature or not before dating him.|`|PzmLYUe6aa	no, because that guy would turn out to be a cheater|`|mBlcD6sRaa	my wife did|`|FD0cZu9Uaa	Depends on the guy. Some people are just plain flirts. its in their nature.<br>  If my guy is the type who flirts with everyone from my sister to the old ladies who live in the same condo as his grandma I wouldn't worry about it. <br>  Now if he flirts like a player...well that's a different story, I would have to let him go.|`|50073dbd5ecac430d78adbf7aa450341aa	ah, no, not ever, not even.

8yE2sYGeaa	Well, if you've read Lord of the Rings, the elves are like that. they can live forever, provided they are not arrowed or stabbed|`|tVvH28GCaa	Introduce an element that can hurt her? Think silver bullets, but not as lame. Like...diamond bullets? Or make up an element like adamantium. A rare element, so people don't use it all the time either. Or put a time limit on her power. Like, it only lasts for a few hours at a time.<br>  Or have a day, perhaps once a month, when her powers are weakened/disappeared.|`|Zy95gx6raa	My only suggestoin is to work on her character, make her personality unique. There's plenty of invincible characters in comics, television and movies, and it's not their powers that make them interesting, it's their individual personalities and how they resolve conflicts where their powers have no use.<br>  <br>  I guess one more suggestion, maybe have a villain with the ability to cancel out her power.|`|s90DY6Dyaa	hmmm...bulletproof skin. of course nothing can penetrate her skin. Just like Colossus or Luke Cage.<br>  <br>  How bout if she was like colossus from x-men where she can make her skin invincible at will but when shes not fighting crime her skin is normal.<br>  <br>  or maybe a special type of metal can only be used to cut her skin. lets say lead or adamantium (be original)? |`|VY6cX6jWaa	@ Stephen K: w00t? Elves aren't bulletproof or indestructible.<br>  <br>  Like Mandie said, add a condition.<br>  <br>  Make her power tied to an emotional state  like anger, need for justice, survival Instinct, fear of others or own fear etc.<br>  <br>  Or she could be invincible but every time she uses her ability something bad happens like a kitten dies or to enter that state she needs to draw the life force of a living being or she ends up hospitalized after it.<br>  <br>  Then you could add some actual limit to her invincibility. Like she is bulletproof but she can be slashed (lufie) or she skin is interpenetrate but she can still be hurt by blunt damage (a club to the chest will still break a few ribs). That way she is bulletproof but not really invincible.<br>  <br>  Finally if you don't like any of the above you can just make her totally invulnerable but that's just used over and over and over. Wolverine, The hulk, Superman, cheerleader from heroes etc etc etc. Pretty much every comic book hero can take more punishment than the average human so I don't really like invulnerability powers.

My best friends are all ones the stars say I get along with, and people I clash with are the signs said that dont go well together.  They are fun to read though.|`|EkPdCXBGaa	If it was for real,it would tell people,"Today is a bad day my dear Libra,If you leave your house,you will be hit by a bus"|`|GdqFNxt5aa	i never believe in zodiac an horoscopes....|`|FFrUZAoraa	No. I don't believe in star signs or that people can predict my future from the stars.|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	I'm not interested in them. I don't care whether people like it or not, I just don't believe in it. I also think it's boring just reading the prediction thingy, since I don't take it seriously anyway. |`|qhU3PDgfaa	well, its all about beliefs.. if someone believes in it..its true for them..<br>  <br>  just like ghosts etc.. i dont believe in it..coz i have never come across it.. <br>  <br>  so at times, some things that the horoscope predicted for me, has come true.. and that is why.. i kinda listen to it..even if i dont believe in it completely.. |`|oM6Fugk6aa	I do believe in horoscopes, cause one day i read my horoscope and it said there is love in the air. that day when i was in the swimming pool i saw this Hot boy,he was massive, and he said hi, by the next day, he has my number and i have his.<br>  <br>  What a romantic story!!!!!!!!!!.|`|rbqvDZyxaa	I belive in them strongly, I'm so like my star-sign Aries its unbelieveable, everything it says about my personality is spot on, and what is said in the horoscopes almost always happens to me, I find it interesting and have always believed in it. |`|LnyEMVFAaa	i believe in astrology but not entirely with horoscopes...<br>  the characteristics of my sign  perfectly fit me...|`|AA11033942	I'm not sure, occasionally I do. When I read what is written about my star sign in the newspapers I occasionally browse, find that they get it exactly spot on! but other days, when I read them, because they're either incredibly cryptic (to the point of being nonsense) decide they're a load of crap and have nothing to do with me.<br>  <br>  The descriptions of my current set of circumstances made by these people are written in a really arcane way, and are designed to enthral and intrigue the readers but how much of it can be correct? only you can answer that question for yourself, and it depends on how much you really believe in it.<br>   <br>  I used to agree with a couple of very good astrologers in one newspaper, but since he died his replacements haven't been as accurate so certainly LESS that I used to but wouldn't say not at all.<br>  <br>  I'm a cancer and according to different people you ask, then certain things are going to happen and you are compatible with this star sign but not that one, and if you really believe in it then people with the same sign and occasionally the same birthday read a star sign prediction in the paper and it applies to one but not the other? Read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology</a> for an in-depth explanation of its origins.<br>  <br>  A lot of my friends dismiss it as superstitious nonsense but enough people do that a whole industry has been spawned of the back of it. I wouldn't pay anyone for astrological advice, but as I mentioned above occasionally read what some of them say.<br>  <br>  Personally I believe the Chinese horoscope provides a far better insight into the person than the 12 signs in a calendar year because they more accurately describe the person based on their year of birth animal sign, and its compatibility with the other eleven animals of the chinese zodiac cycle. see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zod...</a> for more information on this branch of the subject.<br>  <br>  Another way to think about horoscopes is this: there are roughly six billion people on this planet, but there are only 365 days in a year so the horoscopes that are published would at times apply to hundreds of thousands of other people as well as you, so does that make you believe in them any more or less? <br>  <br>

While an Mp3-Mp4 is hardly a big deal in my opinion, they felt the need to ban for a reason and you should do your part to follow the rules.

2EvkFausaa	I honestly don't think a woman HAS to have big breasts. I think as long as she's got a handful, that's big enough. But like if she has small breasts, or worse yet, is flat chested, that is a massive turnoff and a total dealbreaker. With small breasts, it's like, "what am I grabbing?" And when I stuff my face into her chest, I get NO pleasure out of it cause there's virtually nothing to rub my face against and she barely has that womanly valley that I love to enrapture myself in. And without a doubt, bigger is better.

Il famoso detto "ho le gambe che fanno Giacomo Giacomo" deriva proprio dall'evocare lo stato di sfinimento che il pellegrino provava al ritorno da un viaggio a piedi così sfiancante (ed inutile).|`|WHy92kiIaa	nn lo sò, ma lo vorrei sapere x la tua domanda ti meriti 1a stellina|`|vmHF0153aa	ho trovato questa spiegazione:<br>  <br>  Giacomo Giacomo<br>  ?Voce fonosimbolica, nata probabilmente dall'onomatopea -gi... -ci... relativa allo scricchiolio delle articolazioni e incrociata col nome Giacomo? <br>  ?"Giaco", corta camiciola irrobustita da fili di ferro, con cui i contadini rivoltosi combattevano contro i signori, assai meglio armati. E non è escluso che proprio in quei momenti nascesse, per la manifesta inferiorità dei primi, l'espressione "le gambe mi fanno giacomo giacomo"?|`|b1bd140370a61f7aeef955278a23ccb6aa	so io cosa ha fatto Giacomo...

Il primo film intitolato "Ano hi ni kaeritai" cioè "Vorrei tornare a quei giorni" termina con Kyousuke che lascia definitivamente Hikaru(anche se in modo un po' brusco) e si mette con Madoka mentre Tinetta parte per l'estero decisa a diventare una famosa ballerina.<br>  Il secondo film intitolato SHIN KOR riapre il triangolo tra i tre protagonisti ormai diciannovenni.

e41c7ea732c4106f0534d71b0abf910faa	Maybe I should help you.<br>  <br>  Kiba: very good, complex storylines.  Since it's unlicensed, you should have no trouble finding it online to watch/downloade.  However it is 51 episodes long.  I've watched them all, it's worth it.<br>  Jyo Oh Sei: I liked it.  However there is a confusing time jump.  Just be prepared.  If you like fighting and stuff, this is it.  It's only 11 episodes long.  You would have to watch this one right away.  It just go licensed, so it will be soon disappearing on the net.  <br>  Hunter X Hunter: good action and comedy.  However, it's long as heck.  It keeps you glued though.  From the guy who did YuYu Hakusho.  Still unlicensed.  <br>  Godannar: It's been licensed for a while, but it is hilarious.  Giant robots with gratuitious fanservice.  A must watch.  <br>  D.Gray Man: It is GREAT.  I think it's still unlicensed, making it easily accessible.<br>  Ouran High School Host Club: I don't want to say that this is a shoujo title, because I've known grown men toname this as a favorite.  I cosplayed as a character and guys pointed me out excitedly. Unlicensed. 26 episodes. <br>  Twelve Kingdoms: Ever wanted Fushigi Yugi without the lame romance?  This is it.  Swords, demons, and lots and lots of blood. Great storyline.  There are 45 episodes, however you don't need to watch past episode 14.  After that, the story gets a bit stale.<br>  Death Note: Very good psychological anime.  What happens when you can decide who lives and dies?  Very highly recommmended.  I think it has 39 episodes.  Was licensed, however there are episodes everywhere on the net. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|2b15d8add7f79b4cb204e37154203e82aa	trinity blood<br>  blood plus<br>  s-cry-ed<br>  ergo proxy|`|fQ9p4kGXaa	Go to Aol video search and search the following shows.

jE85tGlraa	Jay-Z is the top. Diddy has a whole lot of money, and Russel Simmons is up there, but I dont really think they're considered rappers. 50 Cent is a rich mo-fo, and I'd say Eminem, just for the fact that he usually gets a piece of 50's money. And if thats the case, then that means DR. Dre is pretty paid off of Aftermath, because thats where Eminem gets his money through too. Kanye made alot of money off of that last album, and besides that pretty much everyone else is living comfortably, or might as well not have a career.|`|FSuOygWuaa	I think 50 cent and Kanye West are at  the top right now|`|gCT8ODKFaa	its kanye west common|`|xV8vyuElaa	tupac

doHX8Ue3aa	ihihi... carina<br>  <br>  Te ne lascio qlkuna ank'io<br>  <br>  Pierino e' andato in drogheria x comprare della carta igienica.<br>  il commesso "come la vuoi? celeste, rosa,crema,paglino,oppure bianca?"<br>  Pierino"me la dia bianca che a colorarla ci pensiamo noi"<br>   <br>  allora pierino alla prof.:-professoressa ho buttato carta giù dalla finestra-<br>  e la prof. dice:- va be ma nn farlo +-<br>  ad un certo punto arriva un ragazzo tutto insanguinato e la professoressa spaventata dice:-ma ki 6?-<br>  e il ragazzo: -Carta-<br>   <br>  Le ragazze scrissero sui muri:ce la pagherete!<br>  e i ragazzi risposero:e quando mai ce l'avete data gratis?! <br>   <br>  La mamma di Pierino è incinta e promette al figlio di dargli una sorellina. Però quando torna dall'ospedale ha in braccio un maschietto. “Mi hai imbrogliato,mamma,mi avevi promesso una sorellina!” “Non è colpa mia,Pierino,ma è la cicogna che ci ha imbrogliati!” “Allora mamma cambia uccello!”<br>  <br>  Ora di cena a tavola: mamma, papà, tre figli e la nonna che sferruzza sulla poltrona.<br>  Uno dei bambini a un certo punto chiede:<br>  - Mamma, come sono nato io?<br>  La mamma un po' imbarazzata, improvvisa:<br>  - Sai, un giorno è arrivata una bella e grande aquila e ha appoggiato un fagottino sulla finestra, ed eri tu!<br>  La nonna continua a sferruzzare e alza un sopracciglio.<br>  Allora il secondo bambino, incuriosito chiede:<br>  - E io, come sono nato?<br>  La mamma prosegue con lo stesso tema:<br>  - Tu invece sei stato portato da un grande condor!<br>  La nonna continua sempre a sferruzzare e alza l'altro sopracciglio.<br>  Il terzo bambino ovviamente vuole sapere anche lui com'è nato. E la mamma:<br>  - Un giorno è arrivata una bellissima cicogna e ti ha depositato sul davanzale della finestra!<br>  La nonna smette di sferruzzare e bisbiglia sottovoce:<br>  - Mi pareva infatti che fossero tre uccelli diversi!<br>   <br>  Un alunno chiede al professore:<br>  Professore mi può rispiegare la lezione sugli sperma?? e il professore risponde:<br>  Si, ti faccio subito uno schizzo alla lavagna<br>   <br>  La verginità è come una briciola, c’è sempre un uccellino che te la porta via...<br>   <br>  Educazione sessuale a scuola: <br>  - Pierino, che precauzioni si devono prendere in caso di rapporti sessuali con sconosciute? <br>  - Nome e indirizzo falsi, signora maestra! <br>   <br>  Nella scuola elementare una maestra della prima elementare ha dei problemi con uno dei suoi allievi. La maestra domanda: <br>  - Pierino, qual è il problema? <br>  Pierino risponde: <br>  - Sono troppo intelligente per stare in prima. Mia sorella fa la terza ed io sono più intelligente di lei! Credo che dovrei andare anche io in terza! <br>  La maestra ne ha abbastanza. Porta Pierino nell'ufficio del direttore. Mentre Pierino aspetta nel corridoio la maestra spiega la situazione al direttore. Il direttore dice alla maestra che metterà il ragazzo alla prova: gli farà una serie di domande, se lui sbaglia una qualsiasi delle risposte dovrà tornare in prima e comportarsi bene. La maestra è d'accordo. <br>  Pierino viene fatto entrare, gli vengono spiegate le condizioni e lui accetta di sottoporsi alla prova. <br>  Il direttore esordisce: <br>  - Quanto fa 3 x 3? <br>  Pierino: <br>  - Nove! <br>  - Quanto fa 6 x 6? <br>  - Trentasei! <br>  E così via con ogni domanda che il direttore presuppone che un allievo della terza debba conoscere. Il direttore guarda la maestra e le dice: <br>  - Credo che Pierino possa andare in terza... <br>  La maestra dice al direttore: <br>  - Posso fargli io qualche domanda? <br>  Il direttore e Pierino acconsentono. Allora la maestra: <br>  - Una mucca ne ha quattro ma io ne ho solo due, che cosa sono? <br>  - Le gambe! <br>  - Cosa c'è nei tuoi pantaloni ma non c'è nei miei? <br>  Il direttore si domanda come mai la maestra faccia una simile domanda, ma Pierino risponde prontamente: <br>  - Le tasche! <br>  - Che cos'è che inizia per "C", finisce per "O", è peloso, saporito e contiene un liquido biancastro? <br>  Gli occhi del direttore si spalancano prima che lui possa fermare la risposta... ma Pierino con tranquillità: <br>  - Il cocco! <br>  La maestra non demorde: <br>  - Che cos'è che entra duro e rosato ed esce molle ed appiccicoso? <br>  - La gomma da masticare! <br>  - Che cos'è che un uomo fa in piedi, una donna da seduta ed un cane su tre zampe? <br>  Gli occhi del direttore si spalancano ancora di più, ma Pierino candidamente: <br>  - Stringere la mano! <br>  La maestra sempre più presa dalla sfida: <br>  - Ora ti farò alcune domande del tipo "Chi sono io", d'accordo? <br>  - D'accordo! <br>  - Infili dei paletti dentro di me. Mi leghi a terra prima di montarmi. Sono bagnata prima che tu abbia finito. <br>  - La tenda, signora Maestra! <br>  - Un dito entra dentro di me. Giochi con me quando ti annoi. Rimango con te per tutta la vita. <br>  Il direttore guarda irrequieto e teso ma... Pierino: <br>  - L'anello nuziale! <br>  La maestra si sforza per pensare a delle domande difficilissime: <br>  - Esisto in diverse misure. Quando non sto bene sgocciolo. Quando mi togli il liquido ti senti bene. <br>  Pierino: <br>  - Il naso! <br>  - Ho un corpo affusolato e rigido. La mia punta è penetrante. Sto spesso in una custodia. <br>  - La freccia! <br>  - Quale verbo inizia con "SC", finisce con "ARE" e significa un sacco di divertimento? <br>  Pierino: <br>  - Scherzare!!! <br>  Il direttore tira un sospiro di sollievo e dice alla maestra: <br>  - Sbattilo in quinta: le ultime dieci risposte le ho sbagliate persino io! <br>   <br>  Pierino va a trovare la nonna e porta con se un amico. <br>  Mentre chiacchiera con la nonna, il suo amico gradisce il caffé offertogli e sgranocchia le noccioline che sono in un vassoietto sul tavolo. <br>  Al momento di congedarsi l'amico di Pierino saluta l'anziana nonna: <br>  - E' stata una bellissima giornata, grazie di tutto e soprattutto per le noccioline. Ne ho fatto davvero una scorpacciata!!! <br>  La nonna: <br>  - Ma figurati! Purtroppo, da quando non ho più i denti riesco solo a succhiare la cioccolata che le circonda e le noccioline mi restano sempre... <br>   <br>  La maestra alla fine della giornata di scuola dice ai suoi alunni: <br>  - Per domani vi do un compito diverso dal solito. Ognuno di voi domani porterà qualcosa di eccitante su cui discutere in classe. <br>  Il giorno dopo i bambini arrivano ognuno con qualcosa di strano e la maestra li interroga ad uno ad uno. <br>  Quando arriva il turno di Pierino questi si presenta con la sua bici. La maestra allora gli chiede: <br>  - Scusa, Pierino, ma non capisco cosa ci sia di eccitante in una bici? <br>  E Pierino: <br>  - Questo non lo so, ma questa mattina mia sorella ha detto che aveva perso uno dei suoi cicli. Allora il papà ha avuto un attacco di cuore, la mamma è svenuta, e il vicino di casa si è sparato!<br>   <br>  - Sai, mamma, - dice Pierino- oggi abbiamo imparato tante parole che non conoscevamo! <br>  - Bravi, come avete fatto? <br>  - Abbiamo messo delle puntine sulla sedia del maestro... <br>   <br>  Un gruppo di amici sono seduti a un tavolo a giocare a carte.<br>  uno di loro chiama a voce alta la moglie:' Maria, madre di 5 figli porta da bere ai miei amici'.<br>  e la donna porta da bere al tavolo...<br>  e poco dopo il marito:<br>  'Maria, madre di 5 figli porta da mangiare ai miei amici'<br>  e la donna gli risponde:' Sì padre di tre..'|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	ahahahah|`|n4iNj8ghaa	bella|`|0eCKunT6aa	Ma è vecchiccima!!!!!!....ma cmq è carina dai...<br>  <br>  Ti va di aiutarmi? clicca qui almeno per una stellina<br>  Grazie<br>  <a href="http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Av_y7BmDTxB8ReZcZEZya9rwDQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20080426080511AACy0mX">http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|dhmPxH9Paa	divertente|`|h3AA6WWWaa	divertente|`|uwACuEYcaa	è trp bll...fantasticaaaaaaaaa........altre csì divertenti e t accenderanno ttt le stelline!!!!!!!!!ciauuuuuuuuu 6 forte!!!!|`|0d42007f61aef3b8a141fa11a3976fcbaa	uhahahahaha che cavolata però è carina =D|`|2SvmCdfgaa	ahahahaha :) :) :)|`|6438pbOtaa	ahahhahahahahhahahahahahah....no!!!ma dv le vai a prendere!!!troppo frt!!|`|8A1Uf93Faa	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAQHAHAHAHAHAHA stupenda!!!|`|93bAKz0Raa	forte XD|`|B9ffYfLoaa	AHAHAH,BELLA!!!|`|iNvK3LpHaa	stupenda!!!!!!!!!!|`|8fIg8h99aa	bella...sto ridendo come una cretina!|`|Aub3pOx5aa	bellissima ke ridere|`|CNZ9GIrvaa	ahahah|`|UquueiLPaa	hihi e carina|`|XYWNs51Zaa	:-(|`|ga3ZS97uaa	Forteeeee!!!!|`|lIL5Rqc5aa	fa ridere, nn c'è k dire, xò avrà cento anni!!!!|`|mafQNyHkaa	Bellissima, divertentissima...........ahahahahahiihh...<br>  Ciao..............|`|npWc1LFzaa	Devo dire ke è bella....|`|yDA33UQWaa	sii è trp simpatica!!!

P8gGMlbIaa	Not likely to find that one, it was licensed by AD Visions.

The following comments basically reflect a pathological liar who has the characteristics of histrionic personality disorder. <br>  <br>  Some characteristics: <br>  <br>  1. Exaggerates things that are ridiculous. <br>  <br>  2. One-upping. Whatever you do, this person can do it better. You will never top them in their own mind, because they have a concerted need to be better than everyone else. This also applies to being right. If you try to confront an individual like this, no matter how lovingly and well-intentioned you might be - this will probably not be effective. It's threatening their fantasy of themselves, so they would rather argue with you and bring out the sharp knives than admit that there's anything wrong with them. <br>  <br>  3. They "construct" a reality around themselves. They don't value the truth, especially if they don't see it as hurting anyone. If you call them on a lie and they are backed into a corner, they will act very defensively and say ugly things (most likely but depends on personality), but they may eventually start to act like, "Well, what's the difference? You're making a big deal out of nothing!" (again, to refocus the conversation to your wrongdoing instead of theirs). <br>  <br>  4. Because these people don't value honesty, a lot of times they will not value loyalty. So watch what you tell them. They will not only tell others, but they will embellish to make you look worse. Their loyalty is fleeting, and because they are insecure people, they will find solace in confiding to whomever is in their favor at the moment. <br>  <br>  5. They may be somewhat of a hypochondriac. This can come in especially useful when caught in a lie, for example, they can claim that they have been sick, or that there's some mysteriously "illness" that has them all stressed out. It's another excuse tool for their behavior. <br>  <br>  6. Obviously, they will contradict what they say. This will become very clear over time. They usually aren't smart enough to keep track of so many lies (who would be?). <br>  <br>  Here are some ways to tell someone is a pathological liar contributed by another WikiAnswers Contributor: <br>  <br>  <br>  They lie about even the smallest things. For example, saying "I brushed my teeth today," when they didn't. <br>  <br>  They add exaggerations to every sentence. <br>  <br>  They change their story all the time. <br>  <br>  They act very defensively when you question their statements. <br>  <br>  They believe what they say is true, when everyone else knows it isn't. <br>  Here's an alternate "checklist": <br>  <br>  <br>  Lies when it is very easy to tell the truth. <br>  <br>  Lies to get sympathy, to look beter, to save their butt, etc. <br>  <br>  Fools people at first but once they get to know him, no one believes anything they ever say. <br>  <br>  May have a personality disorder. <br>  <br>  Extremely manipulative. <br>  <br>  Has been caught in lies repeatedly. <br>  <br>  Never fesses up to the lies. <br>  <br>  Is a legend in their own mind. <br>  Here are more opinions and other input from WikiAnswers Contributors: <br>  <br>  <br>  I have found a few differences in pathological liar and a "slime ball" liar. Pathological liars cannot tell that they are lying they actually believe the lie as soon as it comes out of their mouth. They lie about unimportant things that don't really matter to anyone. This can be caused by mental defect but isn't always. Slime-ball liars lie about things that make them look better or embellish to get attention. They also lie to keep their butts out of trouble and to get what they want. <br>  <br>  Here are things to ask yourself: How could this many things happen to one person? Would believe these stories if someone else told you? Think back to the beginning: you had red flags and alarms going off in you head. Learn to trust your instincts. <br>  <br>  It is very hard to tell when one is a pathological liar. Some people just are liars and lie to lie because they can and they don't care about getting caught and aware that you know they have lied. These people care not about lying, it's no big deal. It's like "ok, so what? I lied". The pathological liar on the other hand, IS aware that they are lying BUT will go to extremes to make you believe that they are truthful. They appear to believe their own lies BUT in truth, they know their lies are just that, lies. But because their efforts are constantly backing up their lies, it appears to us that they actually believe their lies, when we eventually do find out about them and then we tend to feel sorry for these people. Then they have an excuse, "I am sick, I don't know why I lie, I believed what I was saying etc." The only truth was the fact that they don't know why they lie. Other than that it's crap. It is true that most of them have an extremely low sense of self worth and are continuously trying to make themselves feel better about THEMSELVES and this is one reason they lie. It is about them but the lies are not always set up|`|3yNh5jO8aa	a pathalogical liar = extreme insecurity<br>  <br>  I know a guy like that.

They feel that something catastrophic really will happen late in the year 2012, since there are so many prophecies from so many sources related to that year.

r4ar5lekaa	Hey, I just found this question, and I don't know if you're talking to me or not. haha. Since I recently answered your Q where you asked about this song. The other girl who answered said it was "Freek 'N You", but that was the wrong answer. My answer didn't win :( but it's OK. hahaha. <br>  <br>  Anyway, where did you hear the song? And I'm sure you heard the "I wanna love you" at the beginning like I said you'd hear? haha. But yes, it's definitely the song "What About Us?" from the Diary of a Mad Band album.

2VNmxfgpaa	Hi,  I'll get to your question but I must tell you first that this person has very strong intelligence and mental acuity.  Mercury (mind/communication) conjoining the Sun in Leo jumps out right away.  Then they both trine to Neptune, which is related to distant communication, psychic faculties, and abilities to hone in on the mass consciousness.  All of the speaks of a high mental order.  As Neptune also deals in illusions, this person has an incredible imaginative ability that can translate to inventions, vision.<br>  <br>  Relationships?  In the Seventh house of partnerships, there's Venus, the natural ruler of the 7th house and relationships.  Venus is in Virgo, which is a careful, faithful sign,  Venus makes a hard aspect to Neptune here, which can mean not always seeing difficult things and people the way they are as it is too painful.  Then Venus sextiles Mars, which is a great placement for harmonious relationships with the opposite sex.<br>  <br>  Mars squares both Saturn and Jupiter here, which can lead to occasional flares of temper, but with the planets in Libra it's likely any flare-ups are well justified and at the same time, with the mentality we're dealing with, this person has also given it some thought.<br>  <br>  All in all things portend well for this person in relationships.  I would say this person should watch out for being a sensitive soul that gives too many second chances (Neptune) but with all the strong Leo energy, the intelligence and the Jupiter and Saturn in Libra, it seems this person possesses enough to balance that out.|`|nZ3Shhliaa	thats a perfect astrology chat you have great signs

5XYlHv6Paa	I know people who know her, and after getting to know her, they see she's not really on drugs, just crazy hyper and insane. SHe is pretty disgusting though. How does Mario deal with her?<br>  <br>  LuAnne needs to be countess slapped. She is trash.<br>  <br>  I like Bethenny and Jill.<br>  <br>  The new Kelly was ina social climbing idiot.<br>  <br>  And Simon and Alex?????? What? What is wrong with these two?|`|AA10958272	Neither, she's a little hyper... as she said, 'an A personality'.<br>  <br>  But, she's got her own business, afterall. The faces she makes with her eyes -- I think, is a learned thing, something that's developed for decades because she believes she's MORE attractive, if her eyes are wider or something. Because they're not always that wide. But, I agree it does make her look psychotic, and I don't believe her husband cares to tell her about it. Now, she CANNOT dance but thinks she can -- which is funnier for us, watching right?  I think she's pretty attractive, for a mom.. and Jill is too. In fact, I'd take both of them over the Countess. The Brooklyn mom is whacked -- and has more "bad parts" than she'll ever know.<br>  <br>  Ramona isn't the worst, on that show.  She's OK.  She's likeable because she's not sophisticated and is naive enough to say what she thinks (again, it makes good TV). Her hubby isn't that much of a catch, either.. if you recall his roving eye in the opening show -- he's a player, behind her back I would think. She shouldn't dispense advice about a happy marriage, because being on a show like that, can get people videotaping her hubby's affairs (if they happen, you know). And then, she's be immediately single.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I did notice that too.

aMOWPRaCaa	I've never owned Marshall amps, but have friends that do and love them. They do have great tone and are solidly built. But, based off of what I have owned and played, i'm a line 6 guy. They are so incredibly versatile. Just my opinion.

I rest my case.|`|SkRJNhuCaa	Line6 are rubbish, certainly their low-end Spider line are.<br>  Their Pod series are nice, but I'd not want to use them for anything except recording and playing through some headphones.<br>  <br>  Marshall are better overall, though their MG line are utter crap.

6HyFHrfIaa	Well, let us look at some facts (True facts):<br>  <br>  1. Obviously, they aren't but people, especially young men call them gay because they are annoying thanks to their all-female fan base.<br>  <br>  2. They have songs that are pretty darn cheesy and sell-out-ish.<br>  <br>  3. Whenever a young man makes a promise to not have sex until he is married, well, he is just asking for some gay jokes to be thrown at him.<br>  <br>  4. Three brothers form a "Disney Corpoprate" band thus meaning triple the trouble to make the money double.<br>  <br>  5. (Even I hate to admit it) They can get chicks while guys my age do not even get something greater than a Southern cow.<br>  <br>  6. Their songs are very simple and very non-complex with childrens lyrics given to young men who probably do not no the difference between a Diminished 5th and an Augmented 4th. *Hint, they are the same thing*|`|kiJ0rUrVaa	wear make up? they wera more make up then there girfriends and mothers... they just are i guess|`|lkNJNnlSaa	They are just ''too pretty'' to be straight.|`|fuvSSi9aaa	because they are|`|kUZH6fzWaa	lol nice question first off, i think people think that because of the way they act. im not sure about zac but i do know about joe, hes sweet and caring, he also not afraid to show he's feelings. he's an over all nice guy who isnt gay i mean come on he dated taloy swift and she about as girly as you can get!|`|t6k3yoNdaa	Haha, from the way they dress and act. I seen a picture of Zac Efron wearing a tight shirt, holding some skateboard in his hand and pouting. THEY HAVE VIBES. <br>  And, Joe's hair :S<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.autographdealer.com/images/ZacEfron556.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.autographdealer.com/images/Za...</a><br>  <br>  :s|`|sMc5rrtFaa	People are jealous.Joe and Zac look slightly feminine and some men think only girls can sing and dance.They are jealous that young men are getting all the hot chicks.None of them are gay,ever heard of Zacessa and Joe went out with Taylor Swift.|`|eeKlogL4aa	Because they look gay.<br>  Cmon, Zac Efron obviously wears make-up!<br>  Joe Jonas wears coloured skinny jeans... WTF?!<br>  And they both iron their hair straight.<br>  <br>  Not very manly, is it?|`|6pR2xr1Jaa	I guess its because they both are in movies that are for the younger generation and maybe because they are slight pretty boys but i think that's just because they are in the limelight....<br>  <br>  I like them both :)|`|IbtEvdriaa	Cos they give off a kind of gay vibe! Efron particularly! He's just very feminine!|`|AKoMffOPaa	Cuz gay guys have a gay "vibe"|`|LZyW0VQqaa	Because they look gay....|`|MZKRvMdaaa	They're associated with cheesy Disney films/music that little girls all adore :)<br>  <br>  They both have "talents" in the theatrical business, singing + dancing, acting which some people think are feminine attributes (which is lame..we're in the 21st century!!)<br>  <br>  However.. I only think Joe is a little happy because he sings really girly, and he has a purity ring xD  Zac has/had Vanessa Hudgens ;o|`|KTa2y2Ewaa	because they have been unbelievably successful and are a teen icon, recognised for their performing talent and sexual appeal<br>  <br>  so all these sad guys say they are gay because they are jelous that they dont get all this female attention<br>  <br>  simple as|`|tudnaJkWaa	Because they star in films like high school music and camp rock which i find gay.|`|0e30db1991b7d2ef05edf73b241560e9aa	who?|`|D2WLPK0gaa	I don't know.<br>  <br>  Sometimes Zac sounds sorta gay, but I know for a fact that he is not gay at all.<br>  <br>  & I would never say any celebrity is gay EXCEPT if the celebrity themselve admitted it..<br>  <br>  People who say Jonas Brothers or other guys are gay love making fun of people I guess xP|`|gCdP3NJGaa	Who??

And her and Edward get married.<br>  And they have a baby that they name Resnesme. <br>  And Jacob imprints on her.<br>  And nicknames her Nessie.<br>  <br>  IS that enough spoilers for you?
