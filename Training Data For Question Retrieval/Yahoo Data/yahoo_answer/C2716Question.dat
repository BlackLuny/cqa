20090308030906AACM2jW	Pets;Dogs	Is there a limit to how many animals a person can have IN YOUR OPINION?	I've got 6 animals staying with me right now, three cats and three dogs. 4 of them are mine, two are rescues.   I've got the time to and patience to look after them even though I live in a townhouse.   I KNOW I give them more exercise and attention then many owners do when they have a big house and a big yard.   I know 6 is enough for me at any one time (4 is better but 6 is manageable) do you think there is a limit even if someone can provide everything the animal needs?   THANKS!

I heard gurgling noises then when I looked over my cat was heaving and I knew he was throwing up, me and my boyfriend approached him, but didn't touch him and let him finish.   The puke had chunks of his food (which we have been feeding him for months now and he has never reacted to it before) and it was very very watery. Like it looked like a puddle of water with a few food chunks floating in it >.<   He have just cleaned the floor with Pine cleaner and the cats (we have two) have never ever licked the floor. In fact, they were sleeping when we cleaned the floor and it had dried. He's fine now, but it was very sudden and scared us a little. Anyone have any ideas?

20090308045738AAB5mFt	Pets;Rodents	Any ways I can keep my hamster active?	Whilst it looks very cute, I have noticed my hamster is getting porky.   She has a huge Rotastak cage, so I'm confused why she isn't burning it off running around like a lunatic. She has a running wheel which she has never run in since we got her at Christmas.   I get her out almost daily in her run, but she just constantly tries to escape by standing for about an hour chewing on the bars. I have a hamster ball which I put her in, but she's rather nervous in it, especially on our wood flooring.      So I'm wondering if anyone out there knows a fun way to keep her active and interested. I usually introduce something new for her to play with every week, and I'm stuck for ideas.   Thanks in advance. :D      PS: I don't overfeed her. I follow my vet's reccomendation, and she only gets treats twice a week. :)

20090308045919AAlG2TP	Pets;Cats	Is my SUPER AFFECTIONATE cat normal? She seems weird to me.?	Hello, I have three cats (ages 6, 5, and 5). One is a boy and two are girls. I raised them all the same way--with lots of attention, love, and care. They are all affectionate, more than other cats I've seen (who are more independent and aloof), but my second cat is so weird.         She sleeps with me every night until I go to bed, and she makes sure she's under the covers. If my head is poking out, she'll make her head poking out. Is my arms are crossed, her arms are crossed. if I'm curled up in a ball, she's curled up in a ball.      She NEVER leaves the room I am in. EVER. If I'm working for ten hours straight in my room, she's lying beside me the entire time. When I go into the bathroom, she follows me and sits with me. She only eats and drinks when I go into the kitchen, so I have to make sure to go regularly.      She's a little jealous of other cats but not that much; they very rarely fight, but she also doesn't like to interact with them. She mimics me, and constantly "talks" to me with a series of chirps, meows, and burbles. Whenever I sing or laugh, she climbs on top of me and kneads me, purring and squeaking. She kneads me with her hind legs, too (almost like she's going to the bathroom).      Every time I have to go away for 1-3 days, I come home and she won't get out of my arms. I am literally with her every moment of every day unless I'm not in my house. Any time the weather is stormy, she hides in my shirt that I'm wearing.      I love her and I don't mind all of this affection, but I'm wondering: does anybody else have a cat like this? Is this normal? Is it because I lavished attention on her when I got her? (She was four months old when I got her.) She's very clingy but I love her. :) I'm interested to know what you guys think.
20090308041659AAOYjt5	Pets;Dogs	How to desensatize a dog to bikes and kites?	My husband and I took our two labrador retrivers 2 year old Beethoven and 1 year old Buddy for a walk yesterday. Buddy is an owner training SDIT (service dog in training) it has been so cold and nasty for a while that we havent really walked the boys much and yesterday it was so nice 74 degrees out that we decided that we would walk the boys along the river and enjoy the afternoon. Well as we were walking we came across two young men flying kites Beethoven suddenly went nuts tugging on his leash which he never does and barking also something he never does when on leash. later we took the boys to the park and there were people on bikes going by and once again Beethoven started barking and tugging on  his leash. I know that there are kids in our neighborhood that ride bikes and like to tease the dogs  but I would like to know how to correct this behavior before we take our vacation trips this summer.  Buddy  will be going everywhere we go anyway as he is a service dog in training. Our home state gives SDITs the same rights as a fully trained SD.

20090308040615AAsU0NO	Pets;Dogs	What do you think of The perfect dog?...?	I have recently bought Don Sullivan's secrets to training the perfect dog set. It seems a bit cruel when he yanks the dog for not doing as its told. Has anyone else tried it? Does it work? My dog will not do as he is told. Treat training does not work with him as he doesn't like the treats. Any ideas? He seems to get worse as he gets older (he's 10yrs old)   He hates men and other dogs. He was abused as a puppy and thrown out of a car. We rescued the poor little thing. Any ideas on training him? One of these days he will get run over. He gets out of the garden sometimes and bolts accross the road. He has learnt how to open the gate!

20090308044650AAZnGef	Pets;Reptiles	My Tarantula is acting madly. What's happening?	My Cobalt Blue sling is doing somewhat like "Marching" on a spot and it seems to be "drunken" or lose coordination while doing so (imbalance). Sometimes, it just runs around the enclosure wildly. It all happens when I make a slight movement to the enclosure (carry up or tap). It doesn't seem agitated and I can't really describe what it is doing.   I'll explain through sequence which I thought to have lead to my tarantula being crazy.      1) Caught a cockroach in my house   2) Dropped it in the tarantula's enclosure   3) Cockroach ran MADLY in the enclosure. (Probably that's the source of the problem)   4) Tarantula ate the cockroach   5) Tarantula gone mad.      I don't know if it's mites or any infection or what. But I know I'm probably at fault for simply feeding it with wild caught insects. Please enlighten me.

20090308075845AAt7oF7	Pets;Dogs	Get rid of the dog or the son?	we have a two yr old son, 10 months old daughter, and a 7 month old boston terrier.  we got the dog from my mother in law.  so anyway, my 2 yr old taunts the dog. he runs string across his face, tries to ride him, chases him, and wakes him up. i tell him "be nice to the dog bc u love him" the first time, the second time is the same ting with a threat to time out, and on the third time it is a straight shot to time out, and i put the dog away.  The problem is that my husband thinks that the 2 yr old shouldnt have to be told 3 times, and the dog should be able to stay in.  "He should only have to be told once.  When we were kids we acted right when daddy was around bc he would beat us if we didnt" is what my husband says. so he thinks the dog should sit up on a pedestal while the kids tip toe around him. i think the dog should either be outside in the kennel or in his crate if he is causing a distraction for my son.  what do u think?

If a journey is said to take six days on a horse, how long would it take to walk?      The assumption I'm making is that the rider is not flying like the wind, but simply trying to make good time, riding during the day and stopping at night. On foot, the traveler would be trying to make good time as well, but is certainly not running or jogging, just backpacking basically.      Based on that, about how many days would it take to walk, if the journey is a "six day ride"?

I have always loved them a lot and now I am becoming disabled due to chronic back pain and problems so I can't care for BIG dogs anymore (even though I love them too)Right now I still have a cat and a Lab/Golden mix that I love dearly but am finding it harder and harder to take care of  and who is soooo jealous wouldn't allow me to have another dog(so it won't be anytime soon for the Yorkie!)   My question is this--if I cannot find one from a shelter is it ok to get one from a cousin of mine who is breeds them?    ALL of my other pets all my life have been unwanted cast outs from neighbors or something --I know it is bad to breed with soooo many homeless animals out there but I cannot make them stop I know they do it for the money(they also do like animals they have horses and dogs and cats on a farm)   I would look at shelters first and have done so recently and see there are some but wonder if they are full blooded and if they will get larger than 6 lbs or so (I can still carry that if need be)   Would I be a terrible person for getting one not from a shelter?

OK, it′s like this: I live in a nice apartment with a little balcony, but I have a lot of place to walk a dog outside. My Dad is very busy and he could′t give too much attention to the dog.

20090308050339AAywyNn	Pets;Birds	My budgie pulling feather out?	Hi everyone, I've 2 budgies recently (1 male about 2-year old, I got him for a month, and the other one 9-week old, got him for 2 weeks). They got along with each other really well but I started to realise my older one keep picking (pulling) a particular feather (mainly on his right wing) for 1-2 weeks. I also saw his tail feather fell out last week.  He's pretty normal after all and I dont think he's sick in any case - although I learnt that birds pretend they're ok even they're very ill.  As with his 'abnormal' behaviour (pulling feather), should I be worried about it?      Since I've 2 budgies in the same cage (i think it's pretty cruel to have only one in any case) - while I can touch and pet them - they (especially the older one) seemed to be feared of me, their bodies would be shakened up when I approached, specially when I opened the cage.  Have I already scared them by touch and petting them a little too much?  Also, as my 2 budgies are best mates now, does it neccessary to be really difficult for them to be friends with me?      Sorry for asking so many questions coz' I am a new budgies owner.      Thanks for your advice.
20090307161111AAm0hOt	Pets;Cats	How long will this go on for?	So we recently got my one cat spayed and we left her over night. We went back the next evening to get her. Since we've picked her up she has not left us alone. She will crawl into your lap curl up and go to sleep. When I'm in bed she practically lays on me. I didn't mind it at first but it's been a constant thing like she's afraid we're going to leave her again. The only relief we get is when the other cat takes a nap and the one goes to cuddle up with her. How long will this go on?

He isnt eating or drinking normally; and he is scratching so much that he is pulling a LOT of fur out & making his skin raw & bloody. I have tried giving him Benadryl, but cant get him to take much of it without spitting it out, and we bought Frontline for him in case it is fleas. I also have 3 cats & they arent reacting like this. So I am beginning to think its the stress of the move - does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can ease his discomfort??

We've taken it to several veterinarians and they cant figure out whats wrong with the cat.        They just say "buy Advantage".  Guess what.  It doesnt work.  Two years later my cat is covered in sores,bloody, and bald but the vet still doesnt have any better answer than random allergy medicine and the cat has now started to just pee wherever it feels like.      I cant have this as a renter.  I thought i could just try to make the cat comfy as possible but i cant afford to be evicted because the cat feels like peeing where it wants.

20090227135252AAsTFBd	Pets;Fish	Is my female betta fish dying?	My betta fish (female) was in a 2-gallon bowl with three other female bettas for two months, and they all seemed to get along fine. She was the smallest, and about three days ago I noticed her acting really sluggish, hanging around the bottom of the bowl, not moving a lot, and I thought maybe it was because it was time for a water change, so when I was changing the water, I noticed that her fins were all torn like the other fish had been attacking her. I immideately quarantined her, and put her into a spare 1-gallon bowl that I had lying around, but I keep her bowl next to the other bowl with the other fish so she can still see them. She still hangs around the bottom of the bowl barely moving, and sometimes she puts her body in an "S" shape, which I've never seen any of my other fish do before. What's wrong with her, and what can I do to help her so she won't die?

20090308010113AAyQtI0	Pets;Dogs	Aggression in a 12 week old cocker spaniel puppy?	A couple of weeks ago my family welcomed a male cocker spaniel puppy into our home. Like most puppies his age, he likes to chew on everything and often nips during play. We have taken repeated measures to stop the nipping, but nothing seems to work. I have attempted to ignore him, give him toys to chew, growl back, close his mouth with my hand, and I always give him a sharp "no!" when he bites.       When I get up and walk away from him when he is nipping, he bites my pant leg or feet, and won't let go. He often attacks my long hair as well. It's very difficult to correct because he locks his jaw on my hand, foot, hair, etc., so I have to pry his mouth open to release whatever he's biting down on.      More disturbing than the nipping is the aggression that sometimes goes along with it. At times during play, he let's out playful growls, and I always correct him. Occasionally, when he's over-excited, or when I try to pry his mouth open, he growls and snarls at me. He also snaps and tries to bite me in an aggressive, non-playful way. He even snaps at my face. Additionally, he seems to direct this behavior mostly at me. Perhaps this is because I'm the one who spends the most time with him - he sleeps in my room and plays with me more than anyone else.      He comes from a good pedigree with excellent temperament, and he can be very sweet and submissive at times. I just don't know what to do anymore. Any advice?

My kittens are from two different litters, one will be about 9 weeks when I get her, and one might be only around 6 weeks when I bring them home. I'm planning on feeding them Wellness kitten food, Mostly dry, but either once every night, or every two days I'll give them a little wet wellness food.   On the back of the wellness bag though with the feeding instruction they say      For dry, feed 1/4 of a cup. But if your mixing, mix 1/4 dry with 3oz of wet      ...I'm confused. I feed less if it's dry? but more if it's mixed?   And I know kittens generally eat a lot so I'm prepared for that, but I'm still not 100% on how often or how much to be feeding them.      Thanks

20090308040521AAsWDe4	Pets;Dogs	What do you think of The perfect dog?...?	I have recently bought Don Sullivan's secrets to training the perfect dog set. It seems a bit cruel when he yanks the dog for not doing as its told. Has anyone else tried it? Does it work? My dog will not do as he is told. Treat training does not work with him as he doesn't like the treats. Any ideas? He seems to get worse as he gets older (he's 10yrs old)   He hates men and other dogs. He was abused as a puppy and thrown out of a car. We rescued the poor little thing. Any ideas on training him? One of these days he will get run over. He gets out of the garden sometimes and bolts accross the road. He has learnt how to open the gate!

I have just gotten a 4 month old german shepard/lab and have heard that you have to be careful as they are a breed that are easy to get hip displasia. I am really worried because I do agility and I want my puppy to be in it when she is full grown. I don't know what it is and how to "prevent" it. So here are my questions:   1. What is it?   2.What can I do so my puppy doesn't get it?

Lately, I've been helping my friend take care of the dogs while the female dog's owner is in florida.       I pointed out to my friend that the female dog was humping (like a male trying to get it's thing into the female's) my friend's male puppy! The female is 3 and a half years old (we think she has been spayed... 99% sure) trying to mate (well DO IT!) with a male puppy... doing the male's part!      Is this normal or is this the first trans-gendered dog!?!      By the way it looks really wrong!

20090227142253AASrGxC	Pets;Rodents	Is my hamster afraid or sick?	I just bought a 3 month old dalmation/fancy hamster from the local petstore. When I got him, he was really outgoing and you could hold him and everything. When I brought him home I had him in a cage that was a little to small for all of his accessories so I bought him a 2 story hamster cage that has a little house on the second level and I can fit all of his things in it now. Well, for some reason, he will burry himself under his shavings and sneeze and he also does it when hes not in his shavings to. He has got so now that he will go upstairs in his house and not come back down. Im not sure if hes cold or what but when he wakes up he will stair at me and click his teeth together and shake like hes either scared or cold. He is a male, im not sure if that would have anything to do with his behavior or not but I would really like to have him as happy as possible and right now I feel that he is not happy at all. Do you think that maybe another male hamster would make him happy? He was with his brothers when I bought him but I herd that hamsters are happier living alone. If anyone has any advice for me to make my little guy happy I would certainly appreciate it.

20090308060705AArVGPr	Pets;Dogs	Puppy crying in crate after 2 weeks of not crying?	I got my puppy at just over 6 weeks and have been crate training her, for the first week she would cry when put into the crate for about 5 minutes, than that dropped to 2 minutes, and slowly was getting even better.  I never once responded/opened door when she would whine.      Now suddenly two weeks into it she will go for 15+ minutes plus!    Does anyone have any idea what happened  and why??  It's not as if I ever opened the door when she whined before or changed anything I've done during the previous two weeks (Still let her go to bathroom before putting her in crate).      She is only in her crate at night when I go to sleep, so its not like she spends large amounts of time in it, is this the opposite of what I should do perhaps?? I'm so lost!

20090308075221AAuLXjP	Pets;Dogs	What illnesses can dogs get?	I was wondering if dogs can get a flu-like illness, or if perhaps if they start showing signs of being ill then it is something more serious?      My dog has just turned 7. She is an english cocker spaniel and i have noticed in the last few days that she has become very lazy, lazier than usual (after all she is a cocker and is pretty lazy anyway). She wont even get out of bed when someone goes outside (she would usually race to the door to go out with them) instead she just lies in bed and whimpers. She also slept the whole night outside, we couldn't find her as she was not even in her kennel, and she never has spent a whole night outside. Usually she barks to come inside. She came in the morning and was cold and shivering. She is just acting weird.         What are some of the illnesses that I should be looking out for? What can dogs get? Can they just get a flu or are dog illnesses usually more serious. I will take her to the vet if it gets worse or maybe if it doesn't get better in a few days.

I didn't take him out of his cage yet. 2day is only his second day home. I have been talking to him and petting him while he is in the cage. To let him know my voice nor my hand is a threat. When should i take him out? I can't wait a week because he has to go somewhere while i change his bedding.      2) I never see Speedy drinking. I change his water and his food every day. I keep a close eye on him and watch what he does as activities to get to know him better. But still he NEVER drinks his water. I've been thinking he doesn't know how to get  water out of the water bottle. (he is not a new born)      3) Once I take him out what are some activities i can do with him? I know I can put him in his exercise ball but what are some activities we can do together?      Thanks 4 ur help!!!

20090308063618AAnVCrY	Pets;Reptiles	Keeping turtles as pets?	I am wanting to give my daughter a pet turtle for her 18th birthday, in November.   We've never had a pet of any kind, so a lot of information would be appreciated.   In particular, we are wanting to know   If turtles are easy to keep pets.   If all turtles hibernate during the winter   When buying a turtle, things to look out for. Ie, how to check a healthy turtle and how much one should cost.   If they can be kept in an enclosed area, or if they need to live outside   What their habitat should be arranged as, and how much space they require.   Also, my daughter wishes to live abroad after finishing university, in USA Australia and France. Would she be able to bring her turtle with her. Are they safe to fly? Are there any laws that don't allow livestock to be brought into the country?      Thanks, also write anything else you think would be important to know, we're complete beginners on this.

I have two aquariums I want to sell, but I don't know what they are worth.      1. 55 gal, hexagonal corner glass tank with a wooden stand/cabinet, hood/florescent light. Was used for 6 months. Paid over $900 for it (including a nice Fluval filter, but that is no longer with it) a couple years ago, which I know is far, far, far from what I could expect now... but surely it's worth more than a few bucks.  What would be a decent "asking price" to tack on in front of "OBO"?      2. I also have a 75 gallon rectangular glass tank with wooden stand, fluval external filter, hood with florescent lights (two lights instead of one long one across), heater, light timer, power strip.  Paid around $600 a few years ago. Again, I don't exepct to recoup any where near what I paid for it, but I don't want to give it away either.  What would be a decent starting price?

I have been potty training my Shiffon (Shih-Tzu & Brussels Griffin) consistently for the past 3 weeks and he REFUSES to potty outside. Correction, he will only pee outside, but if he has to poop he refuses to do it outside. I'm not crate training him, I just don't like crates, but maybe I should consider it because I am very consistent with feedings and going out 10 - 15 min after each meal, we're doing puppy pads, praising him when he does pee outside, giving him a treat when he goes outside but it's not working. I swear he is the most stubborn pet I've ever had. I have sat outside for 2 hours once and all he did was pee .. as soon as we were back in the house he pooped on my floor!! Slowly and surely he is wearing me down. I'm getting to the point where I take him out to pee and just expect to have to clean up poop later. I dont know what else to do except sign him up for expensive potty training classes. GRRR!! Any suggestions?

20090308080623AAziBz1	Pets;Dogs	Can I request a leg amputation for my dog?	My sister has a Shar Pei/Pit Bull mix (I think he's about 4?) and he suffered from a torn ACL about a year ago. He had surgery on it but did not recover well and we guess that he re-tore it because he carries it and seems to be in pain just like he was before the surgery. From what I understand the risk of re-tear after ACL surgery is high, so even if my sister paid for another surgery I don't know that it would be the best solution. I've known dogs with only 3 legs and they seem to get around really well and be able to run and play. Before I suggest to my sister that she look into amputation, though, I would like to find out if this is something she can even opt for. Are veterinarians willing to perform amputation surgery for these types of cases? Or is there a better alternative? All input is appreciated.

20090308085951AATQB7m	Pets;Cats	I don't know what's wrong with my kitten?	My daughter's boyfriend gave us a kitten because his mother was allergic.  We took her on a trial basis because of my 9 yr old cat.  We weren't sure how he would take to her.  He loves her.  Yesterday, this supposedly 6 mon old cat started acting like she's in heat.  She's so tiny and we wanted to get her fixed when she was old enough.  The vet told us to wait until she's 8 months old.  She went in front of the male cat, (who has been neutered) and stuck her behind in his face and he walked away.  She will howl so loud at times.  Normally her meow is so tiny and dainty, I didn't think she had it in her.  We thought it was the male.  I'm calling the vet tomorrow, this is Sunday and it started yesterday.  I want to make sure nothing else is going on with her.  Do you think she sounds like she's in heat?  She also rubs her face all over the other cat, on his bed, on the rug he sleeps on,  She just wants the male cat. I don't know.  I've owned animals all my life and I never saw such a tiny cat in heat.  Is it even possible.  When I talk to vet tomorrow, I will let all of you know, but I want to see if anyone out there knows.  Thank you so much.

20090308091115AAESK3U	Pets;Dogs	What kind of dog do I have?	5 year old male, 12 lbs, twice as tall as a Pomeranian. When he is wet he is as thin and trim as can be. Mostly a fur ball. We were told he was a Pom by the person who gave him to us, but I need to take him to a groomer and they said he is too big to be a pom and it will affect the price. Any help would be appreciative I don’t really care if he is a pom or not, I plan on spoiling him as much as possible anyway.        http://i67.photobucket.com/albums/h299/s...        http://i67.photobucket.com/albums/h299/s...        http://i67.photobucket.com/albums/h299/s...        http://i67.photobucket.com/albums/h299/s... 
20090308083709AAzONIC	Pets;Fish	Breeding and Keeping Betta's?	I currently live in Ohio and recently caught the Betta bug.  I currently have a few rescued from the pet store, but I am interested in serious breeding.  As there is not an IBC in my area (I live in Ohio and the closest one is in Indiana) There aren't many local breeders with show quality stock, the majority is the pet store variety who are too old and of the wrong tail type.  I did however manage to find a two little crown tails. The red one is my favorite, but he's probably not show quality because he seems to bear the plakat (sp?) design instead of being a clean solid red. Personally I like the green dotted body and rays on his fins. More information all over is appricated, I've read up on Betta Talk, but I also know better than to use only one source for all my information.

20090308085048AA9NTT5	Pets;Cats	Why have my cats suddenly stopped getting along?	I have two Maine Coon cats.  They are almost 3 years old and they are brothers.  They are indoor cats and have only been outside of the house to go the vet a few times.      Yesterday I had to take one to the groomer because he had knot in his fur I could not get out on my own.  The groomer bathed him and removed the knot from his fur.  He was only gone for a few hours.        When I brought him home his brother ran from him and now he barely acknowledges him!  He will not go near him.  Occasionally he will sniff him for a few seconds then walk away from him.        The cat who was groomed just walks around the house with his tail down, he seems so sad.  He tries to get near his brother to nap sometimes, but his brother gets up and walks away from him.      They used to be so close and would play and nap together.  How long will this behavior last? Is there anything I can do?
