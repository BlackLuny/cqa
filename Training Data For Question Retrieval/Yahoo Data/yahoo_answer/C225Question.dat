I told him no the first time (even though im not 100% sure, Im not due for my period for 3 more days) so why would he ask it again today? He doesnt know my cycle or that we had sex 5 days before and 2 days after my expected ovulation date. Do you think that its possible that he thinks that he came inside me and is worried about it?

20090128213654AAHUxd3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How to make baby fall asleep?	My baby is 4 months old. She sleeps about 10 hours at night. The night sleep is not very good, she wakes up a lot, sometimes she is awake for 1-2 hours. During the day she will have 2-3 very short (20-30 min) naps. I don't mind short naps, I know it's normal. The problem is I have VERY hard times putting her to sleep. She hates her bouncy and her swing, co-sleeping doesn't help - she thinks we're playing together, she hates rocking - starts crying and tries to get out of my arms. I can see she is tired, but no matter how hard she (and I, of course) tries, she can't fall asleep. I tried everything, and each nap is an achievement for me. It takes me about 40-50 minutes to put her to sleep. I'm exhausted and don't know what to do. When she doesn't have enough sleep during the day, she cries uncontrollably for an hour before her nigh nap.   - I have read a bunch of books on sleep - no help with their techniques   - I know when my baby is tired   - Crying out didn't work for us

20090128220341AAXBulX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby Nutrition Question:  What do you think?	My pediatrician told me not to feed my infant "fish oil" because it will "disrupt the balance" of fats and non-fats.  Yet, he said I can start "juices" (which I believe are non-fat.)  I didn't feel like being a pain, but this makes no sense.    My baby is four months, but very coordinated, and teething, so apparently, almost ready for solid food.  I am wondering if this "balance" of nutritional components is really so important, and if one daily meal of, say, pureed sweet potato will "disrupt the balance."    Don't you remember when a baby died because his mother fed him water?  Wouldn't I actually need oil to re-balance?  When is okay to break this balance?
20090128220810AAWQTsK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Soap in infant's eye....?	I use a very mild, "California Baby Super-Sensitive" baby wash.  I have gotten some in my eyes because I tried it once!  It was not bad, at all.  It's mostly oil.      I accidentally drizzled a few drops in my baby's eye this morning.  He is four months.  He's a good little guy, didn't complain too much...he never does.  I quickly took my cup of water and splashed the eye.  Then I dried the outside with a towel.  He responded more to the water than the soap.      I thought the matter was over and that he would flush the soap out of his eye....but I am not sure.  How is babies' tear production at four months?  I have seen him cry before.        His eye was reddish, and the lids around it were quite red.  But after his nap, he looked normal.  That was in the morning...  By evening time, he was rubbing his eye, and he went to sleep grumbling a bit more than usual (but not rubbing the eye anymore.)      Are more steps needed to rinse an infant's eye than an adult's?  Could I have caused damage?  Do you recommend flushing the eye again?  Any experience with this?

I produce about an ounce a day, at most.  This is about .25 oz each time I express it.  I say "express," because my infant has refused to feed at my breast for over a week.  He's 4 months old.

20090128220953AAMzAqZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Do you think this will make him freak out or like the baby more?	Okay so complicated situation, is the guy that is the father of my unborn baby is a really good friend of mine, we are ex's and it just happened out of the blue. Getting pregnant that is. It was an accident, I was on Bc. It failed. And here we are. He likes me/loves me but the baby situation scares him as does it me, but I think Ive come to terms with it better now. He can't make it to the ultra sound in 20 days! Which is just the normal one at 20 wks to check dev. and I will get to find out the sex. I was thinking of the week after (and pretending I dont know the sex of the baby!) Of getting the 2d/3d Ultra sound. Because he is totally into technology things, loves games, being on the internet he works alot and even when hes at work he can go on the internet, well isnt suppose too but its just him and one other person there so he can! They have basically a webcam thing where they can broadcast the whole experience I go through and seeing the baby to him as long as i give them his email a day in advance. Do you think this might make him feel like wow this is more real, and freak out more, Or maybe he will feel more apart of this experience?? Especially since hes kind of at work, and i guess if he has to freak out for a little bit, I wont have to see that and get upset! Or do you think it might scare him off? Im hoping after the shock of wow this is really happening I hope maybe he'd think its kind of cool...... And this is the only way I can think too include him since hes an hr and a half away from me! But what do you think?

Then around 930 i went to the bathroom and i was sure i had to throw up bc of my stomach pains but ended up using the bathroom reallllly badly. so i felt shaky and still felt the nausea and laid down. had a hard time resting bc felt sick to my stomachso badly and was shaky and sweaty. I used the bathroom maybe another time or two. then at 130 i threw up. I went back and laid down but was still restless and felt awful and barely slept.      All tuesday i lied around bc i felt so nauseous but never threw up again or went to the bathroom again. The smells of my husbands food and snacks made me feel even sicker but no throw up or anything.      At first we were thinking this might be the flu bc he had it a week before....but this didnt even last long.   ive been so tired like pretty much slept all day yesterday and a lot of today. but no nausea whatsoever.      what do you think does it seem like the flu or morning sickness. Ive tested neg.and all but am a week and 3 days late. Had an appt yesterday for a blood test but bc i was so sick and snowed in cancelled it.

20090128220352AAjtpIi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Figured this would be a better place to ask (Warning: TMI)?	I'm 18 weeks pregnant and normally in the pregnancy section, but I am looking for those mothers who have already given birth to answer this question.       Just as a warning, the answers given could be WAY TMI - but I really want to know...      My question: Tell me about your labor and delivery - in as much detail as you can. Everything. The good, the bad, the ugly, and even the uglier. I know every woman's experience is different, but I rather know as much as I can, and hear all the bad rather than to be taken off guard and have something come up that will freak me out.      Please... tell me of your experience (in great detail). Thanks!

I had unprotected sex saturday night/ sunday morning, possibly around ovulation time, i'm not sure, i'm really irregular. Well now its thursday and the semen and all has come out of me but I'm still really wet down there, more than usual and am having some cramping. Not bad, just enough to notice and know its not gas. I know its too early for implantation or anything but does anyone know what this is? I don't believe its my period, I can just tell, its a different feeling.       Could it be because of me stressing over the unprotected sex? Would the cramping prevent an egg from implanting?       Thanks!! =)

Ok this is the situation, my best friend who is 18 has a 2 1/2 year old daughter with a 24 year old man. The child has lived with her mother ever since she was born. The father is constantly threaten the mother he is going to get full custody of the child. He lives with family members and he does not have a job. The mother lives with her grandmother right now and she is looking into getting an apartment in the near future. Every time she takes the child to see the father he really doesn't spend time with her he just plays his video games. He still tries to control what the mother does even though they are not together anymore. The mom already has a restraining order on the father but he still calls and contacts her through the computer. She is pretty much fed up with him not being a good father and she wants to get full custody of her daughter. This guy is really not a good guy he used to hit the mother while she was pregnant with his child, and has hit her since the child has been born. She is scared and very much alone, what can she do? What are some of the things she needs to do to get full custody of her daughter. Please any information would help! Thank you.....

Do you think i would conceive this fast again? I am asking this because it is my daughters first birthday party on saturday and i wanted to have a few light beers to celebrate. If i were to have a few light beers do you think this could affect conception? Or have i not been off the pill long enough to worry too much about it? I know this is weird and is probably hard to understand. I am trying to word it the best way possible. Please give me any advice you can and please no nasty comments. Thank you for your time.

Original question-  I went to the doctor today for my UTI meds and the doctor didnt even take a pee test or anything (I'm in Mexico) As you guys might know me and my husband think that i might be pregnant I have almost all the symptoms ur supposed in the first two weeks we told the doctor this and he still did nothing just gave us this medicine for SEVERE uti which i dont even have a severe one. well we get home and i go to take it and it has a pregnant lady with an X through it so i guess i cant take it now im 4 days before my period. I want to get rid of this UTI and i dont wanna risk doing something to the baby if im pregnant. What can I do    Updates-  So there really isnt any other doctors i can go see i live in mexico where things are VERY expensive and since we dont really have money here (i have a lot in the US where i do live) we werent thinking i was gonna get a uti while we were trying to conceive so we didnt take into account that we were gonna have to pay for a doctor for that too so we went to a clinic (10 pesos) and alls they did was that i was sure they'd atleast test to see if i was prego but they didnt so now i dont know what to do.     -sorry i had to re ask the ? i got 12 answers and i just didnt think people would look at the ? any more thank u to all who answers    No negative comments please

20090128230843AADf2XD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Can someone explain the concept of an infant's "womb bonding", please?	I honestly don't get the concept of "bonding inside the womb".  Mothers, yes.  They form strong bonds with their unborn babies.  I'm talking about the baby's point of view.      Hello!!!      Do you remember your trip through the birth canal?   You're first breath?   You're first poop?      NO!!!      Baby brains aren't CAPABLE of those memories.   So, if they don't remember birth, how do they remember what their womb was like? How do they know heartbeats? How do they know smells?      Say they did "bond in the womb".   OK   How long do you think a baby's memory is?      THEY'VE DONE STUDIES that show an infant can only remember a few minutes at a time.  Basically, 10 minutes after birth, they don't remember a single thing about it.      Just how, exactly, does the child "remember" this "womb bonding"?      It makes no sense.      I want facts, books and websites.  Something other than "The Primal Wound", please.  I know that's gospel around here, but I need more sources than that.

Now I know , in principle, this is setting myself an him up for bad habits later - its a toss up between that, and getting him properly nourished at this stage in his life. I'd like to know if anyone else suffers with this - or if you've got a particulary ACTIVE toddler, how you get him to sit calmly for a good meal?

20090128223010AA7ImC6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	1st B-day party advice?	We were going to go all out for Peyton's 1st b-day party but after thinking about it, she won't even know what's going on or remember any of it. Would it even be worth it then. We were going to have 2 ponies for pony rides and a petting farm. We got a photographer for the kids to take pics on the pony. We're getting food catered. There's going to be a 3 layer hello kitty cake made by a pastry chef. The whole party will be hello kitty. It's going to cost us a couple thousand. Should we just keep it low key and have the big party when she gets old enough to enjoy it. If so what's some ideas.

20090128224746AAL4kBp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Someone please help with my daughter.?	So my baby girl is 17, and is an amazing young woman. She manages to help me and my husband with household chores. She is a honor student, plays volleyball, runs track, plays soccer, and is vice president of her senior class. She also manages to stay sane in our house with 4 older brothers. She has always been a practical young woman, until yesterday. Her boyfriend, Derick, has been with her for 4 years. They started dating when she was 13 and he was 15. We thought it was so cute him being her first boyfriend and all. There relationship grew and grew over the years, and she loves him with everything in her. I am very open with her, and they hadn't had sex and he never asked her to. He respected her limits and values in life. He bought her a promise ring for Christmas, and i honestly believed they would get married.  He even endured the ruthless taunting and insults my 4 sons threw his way. Last night though derick came over and broke up with her. He did it in a nice way, and gave her a letter explaining his reasoning and let her know he still cares about her. My daugther was crushed. He had been with her through all her life challenges, made tough situations easy for her, and encouraged her in everything she did. She cried all last night, and when i went to get her up for school she looked horrible. Her hair was matted, her eyes were red and swollen, her face was swollen up, and she was paler than she usually is. I have tried everything to cheer her up. I offered to take her shopping, let her stay home from school, had my sons girlfriends talk to her to see if they could help, my sons tried to sooth her, and my husband did as well, but nothing has worked. She has been locked in her room listening to sad music, and cries loudly. She sounds like a banshee screaming. How can i help her? My first serious relationship was with the man i married and i feel so horrible for not knowing what to do. Any suggestions?

20090128231218AAnPuWX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	WHat would you do as the mother of this child?	In kindergarden going into the first grade my little 6 year old brother is going into this private schools where most people are white and although he has brown/blonde hair he is still latino. In the middle of the year my parents had a conference with his teachers about him and they pretty much tolled him that he wasn't keeping up with the group, that he was too shy( because he didn't talk much in class), and was slow at reading. So my parents got him a tutor which was a 1 grade teacher from another school. They meet for about 4 hours a week and in about a month he started reading really well. We were already scared that they would kick him out of the school, because the year before that they had already kick another latino boy out of the school and to be frank I knew this little kid and he was by far the most energetic, smart, and fun kid in his class but even through that they still kicked him out. My parents and the little kids parents were friends so it was pretty hard for us to hear that this little boy was not going to attend the school anymore. Anyway my mother got a call this morning requesting her to meet with the kindergarden principle and she got pretty scared. After school when my mom when to pick up my little brother she spoke with the teachers and they pretty much tolled her that they taught my little brother was getting better but my mother keep asking "but theirs got to be something else to it because the principle wants to meet with me", so they tolled my mom that the principle would tell her...   Thats at the point we are in right now.   now some things to consider-   1. reading isnt a requirement to get into the first grade   2. My little brother is reading and he has had multiple test that the school requested and he passed them.   such like - psychological and some others I don't remember.   3. Isnt it a little too late in the school year to tell someone that their not doing well.   4. He's really smart in math, he's bilingual and he can say the alphabet backwards (in a song)   4. Isnt it the teachers duty to teach every child in the classroom and if someone is falling behind, then to help them.    Example: As a doctor would you let a patient die, if he wasn't making progress.       PLease respond and give me perspectives
20090128231400AAUQ7TF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Why do people think that just becuse a fetus dose not breath air that it is not considerd alive?	fish dont breath air so are you telling me that they are not alive? Just for the record I have no problem with abortion if the moms life is in danger or the baby's is terminally ill (going to die a slow and painful death at a young are) and i wont criticize a woman who gets one because she was raped, I dont agree with it but that's just an opion, but i see a lot of people asking about abortion because they dont want to be parents, or im seeing a lot of it would be to hard for me to give the baby up for adoption after i have bonded with it (so you would rather kill it?) that is just selfish. Every woman has a right to choose and it all depends on the person you are and the situation you are in, but how can you tell me a fetus is not alive when it moves and responds to light, sounds, touch, ect.....?

20090128224724AA3lCc2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	How can I get my mom to understand how important this is for us?	We live in the south, and when I asked my mother if my hubby could come with me to the baby shower that she and her friends are throwing me, she said "Absolutely Not, men dont attend baby showers." Keep in mind this is the same mother who told me that MY husband will be completely useless in the delivery room. My hubby is in the military, and it is a complete suprise that he is at home for the day of the shower instead of out to sea. He is leaving on the 4th of Feb. until the end of Feb., and were due March 5. I want to be able to include him in anything he wants to be a part of while he is home because there is a pretty solid chance he will NOT be home for the delivery. He is soooo excited about our first baby. I have to tell him to chill out with the baby stuff at Target lol. Should I tell my mom and her friends who are throwing the shower to stick it where the sun dont shine? or should I leave my hubby at home. Im soooo confused. I might not even go lol.. Just kidding, Im going but Im sick of "traditions" keeping me from letting my husband be where he wants to be to support me. The shower is this saturday, and Im starting to get really panicky about the whole situation to include his leaving for the rest of my pregnancy... There is a good chance that she will get her way and he will not be home for the delivery. So i guess my question is how do I politely tell my mom to shove it and move over. It is our baby, not hers!

But I don't know how to get him prepared to that? should I just go militant and make him sit on the couch and watch women giving birth until he just gets bored with it?? or should I do something else?? ....crazy thing is that he is in the Army and he is naturally gross.

She been developing normal. But her language skill isn't there. Doesn't no how to say mom or dad. She still doesn't know how to say or wave bye. If she like you then she'll talk to you but if she doesn't then don't even try because she won't give you the time. I really don't know what it might be. I know that a 14 months old baby would understand half the word your saying, but my she doesn't. Her doc isn't helping, telling me its to early to know . Doesn't want to do any test. But they say the early the better for them. I was think it autism, but a person told me to search about rett syndrome. So i was wondering , at what month did your child loss the ability to walk, feed themselves , or any of those skill?

20090128231234AAz9bGx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Should they stay or should I throw (them away)?	Ok here is my issue. I have been going through our house the past few days and getting things ready for a yard sale. In our spare bedroom I have 2 gi-normous Rubbermaid buckets FULL to the brim of baby and kid clothes. These are clothes that either were Rylee's when she was little or little boys clothes sizes newborn-6 years that I have picked up at the Goodwill store over the past few years for my nephews when they come to visit. I want to get rid of them, but I can't. Not just a don't want to, but just the thought of getting rid of them is hurting my stomach, literally. I have never had pains like this before, it's agonizing. I keep going over the negatives and positives in my head but I just can't seem to win!!      Argument 1: The reason I bought the boy clothes in the first place was because when my nephews would come to visit, they would always be dirty and their clothes were either too small or too big. Their mom would never send any clothes for them to wear any of the other days and if she did they smelled bad or were dirty or too small or too big. So I bought the clothes and when they come to visit, I immediately wash all of the clothes they are wearing and brought with them and put them in bags by the door and they wear the clothes that I have here for them while they stay.      Another reason that I want to keep them is in case we have a boy. These are really expensive clothes that I bought for cheap (Lands End, Children's Place, Carters, Gap, etc.) and I am afraid that if we do have a boy that it will cost alot of money to try and replace them all.      The reasons that I want to get rid of them are because we could really use the money for them. Also, I'm not pg yet and I don't know how long it will be before we actually do get pg. They are also taking up alot of space and did I mention we could really use the money right now?      The reasons I want to keep the girls clothes is kinda the same. We might have a girl. Also, these were Rylee's and it would be very special if #2 got to wear her sisters clothes. Not to mention we wouldn't have to buy any clothes. The reasons I want to get rid of them are the same as well. We really could use the money. But I don't want to sell everything out of lack of cash, just to regret the decision later. I find it easy to part with some of the boy clothes but not all of them. But I can't even bring myself to get rid of one singe outfit of the girl stuff.      Also, I have some nursery decor (mobile, bed skirt, plush heart wall decor and a diaper stacker) that was Rylee's when she was a baby. Even though I can't find the bumper and I haven't seen the quilt in years, I don't want to get rid of that either. It's not even the same color scheme that I want to use for our next baby. I don't know what the heck is wrong with me but I really want to get rid of this stuff because we really need the money more than we need baby crap for a baby that doesn't even exist. Should I get rid of it or would it be a better idea for me to keep it? I just can't rationalize which one is the right choice. Any helpful ideas would be greatly appreciated!

20090128225545AAVef0T	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What are the chances that she's pregnant?	A few days ago, my girlfriend and I had sex. She just ran out of BC pills about 3 weeks ago. The only condom we had left was a regular, unlubricated one. I am kind of on the larger side, so I'm used to using magnums. Now, it had been about 2 weeks since she had her period. So, we started to do it, and after a while, it started feeling weird. Turns out, the condom had started to come off. I slid it back on, we went at it again, but, we had to stop a while later, because it had completely come off. So, immediately after that, I pulled out, and we just decided to cuddle. Well, after a while, I was still erect, and it wouldn't go away. So, my girlfriend asked what I wanted to do about it. I said "IDK". She suggested we do it again, but I pull out before I ejaculate. So, I decided to do this, but the thing is, I had a feeling that I was going to ***. So, after like 2 thrusts, I felt I was going to ***, and I pulled out immediately (and I'm talking IMMEDIATELY) and I came on the sheet. But, I've been stressing out for the past few days about it. It's stuck in my head and I can't make it go away. She reassures me that she's not pregnant, but neither of us knows for sure. I know that precum only contains sperm if you ejaculate prior to having sex, and not urinating until afterwards. Please, someone help me, I need someone to tell me that everything's going to be ok....

20090128235650AAqVAQ1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Anyone else still throwing up in the third trimester?	I am just shy of 31 weeks. I know it is normal and nothing to be worried about.  I am just sick of it.  I am not throwing up all day like in the beginning, so it is much better.  But I guess it is just getting me down.  The last week or so I have been throwing up every single night, at least once a night.  It is mostly annoying but it also makes me feel defeated.  My doctor wants me to gain more weight, and this throwing up is not helping.  I guess I am just annoyed and wanted to vent and see if anyone else was in my same boat.

20090129024812AAzPBK0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I have a question about little baby boys?	Were expecting a little baby boy in 4 weeks and I have no experiance with baby boys and had a couple silly questions but I want to know. I heard years ago that when you put a nappy on a boy you have to make sure his penis is completely straight otherwise when he wee's it will make the nappy leak, is this true? Also I heard that they get stiffies, is this true and if it is when your changing his nappy are you suppose to pull it back down again or leave it? I know they are silly questions but I need to know. I only have experiance with girls.

20090129021507AAT6zSu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How can I get over this?	I know it seems a little petty, but I really can't get over this....4 and a half months after my son was born...and a year now since the whole pregnancy saga began!      But I still can not get the reaction of my partners parents out of my head.      The first this his mother said was "Oh  F*** off, and put her head down in disgust.   His father just shook his head, and said "I can't believe this, you've just ruined your lives"      I try to put myself in there shoes, I mean I too would be pretty darn shocked if my son came home and told me his girlfriend was pregnant!   But it still hurts to this day.      They love our son, but I still feel so mad about this, and can't shake it, to the point where just today I am ready to snap, since it's been bottled up for so long.      How can I get over this? What can I do?   The thought of this still brings tears to my eyes.      I'm young (19)-please don't think I typed my age to start up anti-teenage pregnancy tirades, I really didn't.   I just think my age is pertinent to the information of my question, since  believe if I was 28 and married, the reaction would have been quite different!      If you feel like having a go because I'm a young mother, at least do so tactfully.      (And yes, my Child's father is still in my life, just in case people actually wanted to beleive the 'all teen dad-to-be's run off stereotype)
20090129004249AAjHufa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Im a bit worried about my 6 month old.?	My son got changed onto the stage 2 food about 2 weeks ago when he turned 6 months. For the past few days he has been choking on his food, so i changed him to the ones that say 'smooth' instead of 'mashed' but he still chokes/gaggs. So tonight i tried him back on the stage one food and he still choked/gagged on it. Also i changed his nappy tonight after his food and it was very runny and soft when it is usually quite firm and stiff. I cant take him to the dr as it is half past nine at night and my husband works night shift and he has the car. Does anyone know what it could be? I have given him some baby paracetamol to try help him, incase it is a sore throat. also he is breastfed

20090128234548AAllxdX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Did you have a healthy preg. after 1 m/c?	I joined several forums for women TTC after m/c, trying to get info and support, but all of the women there have had several m/c.  Up to 8 of them.   I had my first, in my first preg. in December.  I feel like I'm going to have to have many m/c before I have a baby.    So (I know it's painful and I'm sorry) have you had ONE m/c and then had a successful viable pregnancy after that?  I know the statistics, but I just don't trust them, those same statistics say the USA has a seriously high IMR, like 30th, which I just can't see.     Sorry, but I'm just looking for a little hope.  I don't know how many times I could go though that.
20090129021108AADQqcJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Possible Pregnancy/Worried?	I have been up all night wondering if there is a possibility that I might be pregnant. Heres the situation, (I appreciate all advice!). I have been with my bf for 2 years and we plan to get married, im 20, and we did not have unprotected sex. we did use a condom and even though we use protection, he does not ejaculate until he pulls it out. I dont want to take even the slighest risk. The other night in the middle of 'the act' he realized that the condom was leaking. It wasn't torn, it just wasnt tight enough but it was only precum. We got a new condom right away. On another occasion, the condom slipped off and we put it back on, as dumb as that is, but i know for sure it wasnt torn. Then, the other night, after he 'had his happy moment,' we were messing around like 1 min later and im worried that he might have had some sperm on his finger as he was fingering me ... Could we have made an oopsie on any of these occasions?? Oh btw, its too early 4 me 2 take a pregnancy test, this was all happening in the past 2 weeks, if not less. im supposed to get my period Feb 4th. Thank you for reading and taking the time to answer!

20090128231801AAjP7Ul	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Mommies and Daddies w/ more than one child...?	I am just curious how much baby equipment you have, and what yall do with the items from the previous child. My oldest daughter Avery is 3, so we got everything new and girly for her, and then when she was 13 months old we had her sister Madison, since Avery was still using most of the items, we bought more, another swing, another playpen, etc. Well this compiled with the items that we had from our 5 year old son, carseat, playpen, swing, hichchair, etc. So now that we have 12 day old twins, we once again purchased some more key necessities, car seats, and were given a swing and a pack n'play for twins, and two bouncers as gifts. What do you do with all of these products? Do yall use them in different parts of the house, send them to the grandparents, sell them, give to friends, etc. I hate to get rid of good products all of which are less than 5 years old, so what should I do with them? Thanks...and sorry for rambling, the clutter of baby equipment, and 7 kids in the house has got to my head, lol =)

20090128234150AAB33kj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Just stopped birth control pills and really confused! Any Help!?	first of all sorry for this being so long!! please help me out though!      Ok so i had been on bc a couple times before, i was on it when i was 16 till i was 18, then took a break from it for about 2 or 3 months, (nothing was different, i felt exactly the same). Then i got back on it and was on it for a little over a year. I finally decided to stop taking it in early november, and when december came along my period was extremely late im talking i had a 40 day cycle. it was a weird period i had heavy bleeding for about 3 days then it stopped for a day and started up again for another 2 days. Then in january i had my period really early, only a 21 day cycle and it was really short (4 days but normal flow)!       In december i was nervous that i was pregnant because i was having all kinds of signs and my period was so late, i took 1 test at first sign of late period, then another one 1 week late and both came up negative. Then in january, even though i had already had my period i was still feeling wierd and still having signs of pregnancy (getting car sick in the front seat-never have b4, bloated, moody, and exhausted) so i took another test which came up negative.       My question is, has this ever happened to anyone else? has anyone else had wierd symptoms when quiting their birth control(mood swings, car sick, bloating, exhausted, loss of appetite, and neck aches)? And will things ever go back to normal?      please dont be rude i just need some feedback on what might be happening, im so confused!   Thanx!

Hello,    I'm just curious, but since my last period started 13 January I have been trying to get pregnant & have attracted a yeast infection as the doctor said. It's also too early to do a pregnancy test so I have no idea If i'm preggers yet as the 10th feb is the earliest I can test. The doctor gave me canastein cream (antibiotic for thrush incase of pregnancy) to insert into the vagina but I forgot to ask him if in anyway the cream could prevent an egg getting fertilised or the fertilised egg to implant into the uterus days later as it would have to go through all this cream.   I know this sounds silly but has anyone else experienced this?

I have suspected preeclampsia and keep getting sent to hospital everyday. The local hospital shut the meternity ward down and i have to go into the next town, only 10 miles away but its a big hassle with parking and getting there as i can't drive ect. People take me there but its just not fair for them to take time out of work for my blood pressure to get taken and come back ok basically. I went to see a consultant & i said i'd rather get induced than keep doing this, which she agreed too but also said if it don't work after 3 times i could end up having a c section. Id also perfer to go natrually, i don't really want to get induced. I feel like i might get told off by my midwife when i go see her today as really it's me chopping & changing my mind thinking i want to get induced then bottled it when i was told i could. I know every women has to go through all this crap but i don't want enternals done ect and thats what i think i might have to have done today. Iv had them done before so i no what they are like, i just dont want it done. I just wish my waters would break on there own and i could be left alone but if i let it go like that i have to go to hospital everyday which is horrible. This is my first child if you couldn't tell lol. And i am nervous about everything and don't no what to do. I am basically being given the choice to have the baby natrually or be induced. I have been told it hurts more to get induced and its just not very nice. What would you do in my situation?

20090129022854AAXSTIV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I "accidently" walked in my teenage son while he was naked?	VERY awkward...    Earlier this morning, I had to grab something I forgot in his room on his desk. I thought that he was still sleeping so I didn't even have a second thought. I opened the door, and he was JUST about to change into clothes and it was by total fluke I saw him naked and almost a second after his face turned red. I walked in, and I left within 2 seconds. Throughout the whole day he seemed extremely shy and was fairy coy, avoiding conversations with me. He's 14.    I'm sure this happens on accident with lots of families, at least once but the thing is that this was pretty much the first time I've seen him fully nude-I adopted him just the past October...Which probably made him real embarrassed. Do I say anything? Leave it be? It is quite obvious he's still being coy from when it happened. I didn't say anything to him about it and just pretended it didn't even happen.

20090128234144AA1hib3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	What should we name our twin baby girls?	i have a daughter called jade, whose mother died shortly after she was born. i brought her up. she is now six. i recently met a woman named rose, who is also a single parent. rose has a daughter called nicole, who is four. we got married and became a family. we adopted eachother`s children. adjusting to a new mother and sister haven`t been easy for jade. i had spoiled her a great deal. nicole had also been greatly spoiled by her mother. jade and nicole did not get along very well. nicole often tattled on jade and got her into trouble. jade thought nicole was an annoying little sister. unfortunately, jade got cancer and was in the hospital for ages. she had to undergo many treatments, including chemotherapy, which made all her curly hair fall out. when she got home, people gave her most of the attention, which made nicole jealous. nicole even tried to fight with jade on some occasions. when we go out as a family, jade might not be feeling well and we would have to take her home. nicole would cry and scream because she would want to stay and play. rose and i comfort her by saying" we have to go home now because your sister is tired. we will play later" nicole had now became greatly attention-seeking. how can i make things better? i love both my daughters very much and want them to be happy and comfortable. they both need to be cheered up. also, rose is now pregnant and there is now twin baby girls on the way. somebody adviced us to enroll nicole at a preschool so she can try new things and have children her own age to play with. we thought that was a good idea as she needed a distraction. she was looking forward to attending when we told her about it after taking her to have a look at the preschool. she was doing pretty well there until a boy there called billy pushed her. billy is a naughty little boy who have pulled her hair and teased her on some other occasions. she didn`t feel safe there anymore and has been telling us she doesn`t want to go. she is begging us not to send her back.

Tuesday i decided she needed to see a doctor and was told to give her no milk just re-hydration drinks to replace fluid and well, i stuck to it even though my daughter was screaming with hunger having had no milk. then 24 hours on when there was no change and i had used all but one of my re-hydration drinks i decided it was time to return to the doctors where i was basically told that i was over reacting and the only thing he could do would be to admit her to hospital but because she wasn't really dehydrated all they would do is observe her which i could do myself at home. and sent away. well...another 24 hours is nearing its end fast and well i have seen no change in my daughter. it is hard being alone with her all day because i can't do anything for her. she screams with pain everytime she poos, her bottom is red raw and well...i have run out of re-hydration drinks. im at the point where i think the best thing to do is let her get really poorly and dehydrated so someone will pay attention and believe she is ill. has anyone ever experienced any of this? and what did you do? im clutching at straws because i really really dont know what to do for the best!
20090129022446AAuRoYJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Problems with 1 year old son and his cot.?	My one year old son keeps getting his leg stuck between the bars of his cot. It has gone on every morning for a week but he only does it in the morning not after his naps. he hasn't really hurt his leg, just leaves a horrible red mark but it really stresses him out for a short while. He can't walk yet so I don't want to get him a toddler bed as I don't think he'll use it properly and just be getting up and down all night. I don't know what to do. Is there anything I can do to stop him doing it?      Cot bumpers will not work he doesn't like them and throws them away.

20090129000806AAkwb4l	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Bloating and cramps in early pregnancy?	I think I may be pregnant as my last period was less than half as long and very light, and that's what happened last time I was pregnant (I miscarried last time though) I have taken several urine tests but all were negative, but again, last time I never got a positive urine and was nearly 5 weeks along at the time of miscarriage. The blood test was positive.      My question is, Has anyone else had experience with major bloating and pretty constant cramping? Its not really painful, just annoying with slight "stabbing" pains. Again, not terribly painful, just a sharp increase in pain level for like five seconds.      My abdomen feels really hard and I have been back and forth between constipated and diarrhea....      Just wondering if this is normal pregnancy symptoms.
20090128234010AAEDuZr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you believe to tell a child that Santa does not exist?	My cousin who is six years old believes in Santa. I never believed in Santa since my mum took that Santa is too much of a strong belief. I know that Christmas is over, but next year, I want to make sure she doesn't believe in Santa. I won't tell her because my Auntie would be angry with me, but I want her to stop believing in Santa too strongly otherwise her heart will be ripped to pieces when she finds out! She actually made a list of 10 things she wanted for Christmas and walked with me to put it in the post box.   I don't want my little cousin to feel hurt, what to do?   By the way, if you have a child or not, do you believe that they should believe in Santa?    My answer is no, it hurts too much and it would break their heart once I have children.

20090129024306AAzSQ3o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Advil during Pregnancy?	My wife has been taking advil for her headaches and she is pregnant. She didnt take much but possibly 2 tablets once every two weeks. I recently read that advil is not recommended during pregnancy as it may have horrible effects in the third trimiester. The last time my wife too advil was exactly one week ago. She was 2 days into her third trimester. Could she have done something very bad for the fetus? We are really worried about this
20090129005924AAkUBg7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	When should I switch her crib with a toddler bed?	I have one of those cribs that can change into a toddler bed. Are there any signs? I know every child develops at a different rate, so is there any particular clues as to when will be a good time to do this?  My daughter is 2.5 and at times she takes her naps on my bed alone. When she wakes up she knocks on the door and calls "momma, daddy" calmly and then wants in our arms or into the kitchen for a snack. If she is sick and sleeps with us, she will tap me and say "wake up momma", and doesn't just walk off.  But I don't know of any difficulties with this switch. I'm nervous about it because she is getting older but I'm afraid of what she could do, not so much what she will do. Its like giving a 16 year old a car lol. I know I may be jumping ahead of myself. =P

20090129011618AAUJAc2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What should I do if my daughter says she's being picked on at school ?	My daughter is in 9th grade and she's been complaining and even crying to me that there's a few kids at school who keep bothering her and saying mean things to her, she says a lot of what they pick on her for is her being Jewish and Israeli (we're from Israel). I talked to two of her teachers that have her and these few kids who are mean to her in their classes and they said they've seen no evidence of it in the classroom. But my daughter claims they bother her whenever they get the chance when they're out of the teachers' sight. What should I do about my daughter's situation?

I have a friend who I haven't really hung out with in a while, but recently caught up with a little bit on facebook. I probably won't hang out with her anytime soon, since she is married and is about to have a baby, but also because I'm moving, but I was thinking about crocheting her some booties or something for her new baby.

She's not due until May, should I wait to send it until after the baby is born or just send it whenever I make it?

20090128234332AAeTFsO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Can a parent help their son to pull a fire alarm in a fire?	If there was a fire and your son who is 11 asked if he could pull the fire alarm since you were away from the fire and out of dangers way what would you say? How would you help your son to read the directions  break the glass and make sure the handle is pulled correctly? If your son knew how to pull the handle but his hand slipped because of sweat would you let him pull it again or would you go ahead and pull it together.    For breaking the glass would you tell your son how to hold the hammer or kick the glass? Sometimes it is hard to break the glass with the hammer so how would you give instructions on how to break the glass?

I have numerous friends that either just got pregnant and are EXTREMELY happy about it or are about ready to have their babies.  I am very happy for all of them, but it breaks my heart every time one of them talks about it.  I know that my husband and I haven't been trying for all that long, but it still hurts.  My sister in law for example got pregnant while her husband was home on his two week RR from Iraq.  Its such a small window that I think, what are the chances that the two week period in which he was home was the right time....then what are the odds that the time took?  I know I should just stop and be happy for them, but how do you pretend that your not broken inside?

About two weeks ago I posted a question after I started what I thought was my period that ended up only lasting 3 days and being extremely light. I took on more pregnancy test after the bleeding was over and it came out negative. Now, 2 weeks later, my breasts are very very tender and swollen and its still 2 weeks before my period is due to start again. I have always been regular and there is no reason why both of my breasts would hurt at the same time around this time of the month. I scheduled an appointment with the GYN but it isnt until next week. I'm going crazy here and all the pregnancy tests ive taken are neg so im not really sure what to do with myself right now. I am peeing a little more that usual but I am also drinking plenty of water. I also just started a new job at a medical clinic so its hard to tell if Im exhausted from working or exhausted bc theres a baby in my belly, but I am definitely more tired than usual.    I just need some reassurance or someone with a similar situation to give their opinion on mine.

20090129004805AA10MLn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	A 5 year old kid is behaving like a philosopher?	Hello,      I have a cousin who is just of 5 years. From last few months, he is showing some different kind of behavior. He is behaving like a philosopher. He talks useless related to life and death.       His last day's activities had forced me write here. Yesterday when he wakes up in the morning had started drawing some graphs. Later on he told that me that these graphs gives relation between the age of a person and the time elapse in his life. He told me that the age of the person does not depends linearly on the time but depend on some other co-efficients which he is trying to resolve from the graph. He had drawn the graph in an unusual manner which I cannot explain using words. He had tried to explain me the graph but I had not understand anything.      Here, my question is how a 5 year old kid comes to know about the cartesian co-ordinates and these relations. May be, he had seen me drawing graphs, but it is impossible at his age to understand them completely.      One more point, I would like to add here that he had gain very much knowledge in the field of computers. He has a very great control over the image editing softwares. He can smoothly operate the major of the image editing softwares whether it is Adobe Photoshop or corel graphics suite. Only a few months before, I had taught him Microsoft paint and how he learned all these softwares, I don't know. Even his editing is so perfect, neat and accurate that many of the proffesionals will get ashamed of themselves.      Manytimes, he sits on my lap and make discussions over the architecture of the operating systems like about kernel and virtual memory concepts. He compares the architecture of Windows Vista with Windows XP and Mac OS. We had never used Mac, but he stills talks about the same. At present, I am doing B.Tech in computer science and Engineering. and the topics he discusses with me are my favourite topics. So, my family members thinks that I am telling these things to him. Trust me, I had never told these things to him. By the way, if I had told these things to him, it would be very impossible for a 5 year kid to understand these things.      He discusses these things whether related to computer or related to life and death with me only. May be, because he is very much attached with me or spend most of his time with me. Also, he does not discusses these things regularly, may be twice or thrice in a week. Because of all these things, my family members does not take this seriously and take it in a very light manner. But I don't feel it to be a normal case. Many guys say that he can remember these things from his previous birth but I don't think so. I want the proper answer.

20090128204600AAiteyj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Mother of 1, second on the way, fighting with husband everyday over his smoking. ?	I have an 18 month old child. and I have a baby on the way. When I dated my husband I had told him I hate smokers and couldnt be with one. He assured me he didn't smoke. We got married and oh surprise surprise he was smoking here and there and now he smokes all the time. Not infront of me, but when he comes in the house he smells awful and I want to kill him. Its really bothering me that he could continue to smoke when he has a son and another baby on the way. I find it extremely selfish, disgusting and wrong. I dont want my kids to have to watch their father die of cancer. I told him i wouldnt bring them to his funeral. Nothing gets through to him. At this point I am really starting to hate him. Like i look at him and am disgusted. What can i tell him to get it through his selfish thick skull that he shouldnt be smoking? how dumb can a person be? he just says he cant quit and he doesnt have willpower. Honestly, i need advise cause I really want to leave him. I dont know if its the hormones or what, But everytime he comes in smelling of smoke i go into a complete rage and i loath him.

But it was found at the end of my pregnancy...about 2wks before i had my son and was mainly because of my high blood pressure.

They would go into my room when I'm out, and go and hide in my closet to spy on me.  I don't know why they are spying on me, but they are for whatever reason.  They have made me paranoid, I now check my closet just about everytime I enter my room.  I asked my parents to ban her friends from the house, or at least do something, but they decide to do nothing.  They say that I should handle it myself, but what am I supposed to do?  Put a lock on my closet or something?  How come my parents won't help me with this?  Do you think they are bad parents for not telling my sister and her friends to stop spying on me?
20090128211856AAMJ0Cs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	What do you think??????	3 and 1/2 months ago something happened ....(very personal not sharing on here)    2weeks after that happened she bled for 2 days, light spotting, only changing the pad 1 time a day if that. She had an annoying cramping, it was mild. (not like period cramping).    A little bit after that she started having morning sickness and actually puking.Then little by little she started feeling pregnancy symptoms like: being tired all the time, wanting to sleep all the time, (morning sickness above), that butterfly feeling (not so much at lst she did not notice it til later on), being very bitchy, peeing a lot, cant quench her thirst.    1 month ago she noticed her belly getting bigger (I actually saw the 3 pics she sent me she has got a prego belly look they were taken yesterday and sent to me on the cell phone). She started getting the round ligament pains. The butterfly feeling still continued.(it would go for a little bit then kinda stopped) She was having clear, runny discharge steadily (no foul smell). She was having random cramping (not painful but annoying.)    She is craving: peanut butter, fritos bbq chips, cheese and ice cream l    When I was asking her the past couple of days she has noticed    * Her belly getting bigger  * her boobs getting heavier  *growing out of her jeans(tighter around the belly part)  *feels hard  ovbiously missed period  extreme tiredness  headaches  more frequent visits to the bathroom  *hard time consternating/clumsy  *:heartburn, indigestion, gas  *irritability, mood swings, irrationality, and weepiness  *hot on moment cold the next  *restlessness  *out of breath just from going up the stairs(she is not overweight, she is average)  *:tingling feeling in arms and legs  *saying she looks fat (saw pics just looks prego, she said she has always been flat but now a huge buldge)*belly she has gotten like that in the past month)  *belly feels to her like there is a weight on it (heaviness)    AFTER ALL THIS SHE GOT 2 NEG TESTS but did them wrong (poured the pee on the stick from the cup. and drank ALOT of water I mean a lot, to be able to pee.  So, What do you think? She is doing another test (1st response tomorrow)    *her period is due in 2 weeks about*      **OTHER THAN THE BLEEDING SHE HAD 3 DAYS.. SHE HAS NOT HAD A PERIOD SINCE.

Disney star collectables all over her room.       She is nearly 18 and i've known her since she was 15 or 16.      She was so sheltered. And she had trouble in every aspect of her life because of it. She hasn't kept a job, a boyfriend or anything. She can't keep friends either.      But have you ever known anyone like that in school?

I've been trying to calculate when i due to ovulate, but i have heard that your ovulating just before your period, and that your ovulating just after your period. Is it different for different women? If i'm on a 28 day cycle, how do i calculate when i'm ovulating. And is it just for one day, or is it for about a week? i've heard both so i'm having trouble figuring out which is true. I'm not trying to conceive or anything, i'm actually trying to find out what days i would be more likely to get pregnant so that i don't conceive because i'm in college and i'd like to finish school before i have another persons life in my hands. I absolutely want children, but not yet.      So this would be great to know about so that for now i don't conceive, and so that in the future i will know when i can conceive.      Please no rude comments or answers, i'm just looking for some helpful advice. Thanks.

20090128223559AAPQn0h	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Blood on daughters eye ? ?	Hi,    When my daughter was born, she had blood on her eye, broken blood vessels. My doctor told me this happened because she came out so quickly, and that was perfectly normal. Well, today I noticed that she had broken blood vessels on the same eye, but on the opposite side (the inner part closest to the nose). What could have caused this ? I am with her all day ( I am a S.A.H.M.) and the only time I'm away from her is when she's taking a nap. She recently started a new kind of cry,(it sounds a little 'forced' or over exaggerated) but I don't see how that could force blood vessels to pop, so to speak. Does anyone have any idea ? We just moved to a new town, about a week ago, and I haven't been able to find a doctor that I like just yet. So if I take her, I'm going to have to take her to a clinic of some sort. Does anyone have any suggestions ? Or has anyone had this happen to their child before ?    Thank so much in advance!      Take care all

We live in the deep south, and when I asked my mother if my hubby could come with me to the shower, she said "Absolutely Not, men dont attend baby showers."  Keep in mind this is the same mother who told me that MY husband will be completely useless in the delivery room.  My hubby is in the military, and it is a complete suprise that he is at home for the day of the shower instead of out to sea.  He is leaving on the 4th of Feb. until the end of Feb., and were due March 5.  I want to be able to include him in anything he wants to be a part of while he is home because there is a pretty solid chance he will NOT be home for the delivery.  Should I tell my mom and her friends who are throwing the shower to stick it where the sun dont shine? or should I leave my hubby at home.  Im soooo confused.  I might not even go lol.. Just kidding, Im going but Im sick of "traditions" keeping me from letting my husband be where he wants to be to support me.

She has always had problems with bowel movements and it wasn't uncommon for her to regularly go 10 days between BM. We started offering her solids at 5 months but was refusing until a week ago when she decided she would eat them. she now has 3 meals a day, at this stage just pureed veg and rice cereal with breastmilk. she keeps having problems with her BM, every nappy has a very small amount of poo, its like plasticine and a bit dry. She is well hydrated and has plenty of wet nappies in the day but her poor little anus is red raw and there was bleeding . I resorted to suppositories  which worked almost instantly ( had a very large/almost adult size poo) but she was straining so hard to get it out she urinated at the same time and was screaming. The same thing is happening again, very small amounts (tip of finger size) in every nappy. I don't want to keep using suppositories what should I do? Is this normal?

I'm seeing numbers like 1 in 500 or whatever live births are DS babies, which is used to figure out risk for women of different ages having a baby with DS.  But if 9 out of 10 are aborted is the risk of a pregnancy being a DS fetus ten times the number given or do they take that into account and just don't talk about it because it is not polite conversation.

The other day I heard a commotion downstairs, and when I came down and saw my daughter standing over my son, holding his legs up, while pushing her foot into his groin. My son was in obvious pain.   I immediately told her to stop, which she did. My son was in pain, but was otherwise okay. Later I talked to my daughter and asked her why she did that. She said that he had made her angry, and that her friend (the same age) did it to her younger brother (he's 7) all the time. She also said she's seen her kick him many times. I asked her if her friend's mother knew what was going on, and she said that very often her friend did it in front of her mother, and that her mother had taught her to do this to boys when she is angry.   I told her to never do that again, and that what her friend was doing was wrong.      What I don't understand is why her friend's mother would allow, and even encourage her to do that?

My son woke today with a cough...it doesn't sound bad..maybe a little chesty..but no fear or anything. This is the first time he's been sick so my question is when would I call his doctor about a cough? He is 8 months old this coming Monday.       I think he got it from the kids I nanny for Mon/Wed/Fri. They've been coughing since last week but their mom thought it was because of the dry house...except the 18 month old had a fever on Tues night but didn't have one yesterday...just a cough.
20090129034838AACNlwh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My 10 month old baby has had a chesty cough for nearly 3 months ?	I have taken him to the doctors quite a few times now.    He was given a course of antibiotics which didn't even help him.    He was also given an inhaler as a trial but my doctor said it's pointless giving babies inhalers as their air passages are too narrow so they aren't really effective until they get to around 2 or 3yrs old. (well he explained it better than that!)   I have asthma so maybe it is that, but I dont notice much improvement after he's taken his inhaler.      We were previously living in a house with serious damp and mould problems so I put it all down to that, but we moved house a month ago and I was hoping the move would improve his chest but it's still the same.      I feel so sorry for him, hearing him coughing during the night.    It's ruining his sleep routine too. He used to be an excellent sleeper but now he wakes regularly from coughing and a lot of the time has trouble going back to sleep.      Do you think he could be allergic to dairy? he still has 4x 7oz bottles of formula each day so maybe soy milk might help him??       Has anyone had a similar experience with their baby? if so what was the problem?      Many Thanks
20090129035254AAEnQBo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Why does my son do this?	My son has been putting himself to sleep since August 2008, so almost 6 months now.  He will be 3 years old in 3 months.  He was putting himself to sleep fine, but in the last 2 weeks we have noticed that he puts himself to sleep by covering his head with his blankets!  I always check on him about 20 minutes after he goes in to his bed, at which point I uncover his head and cover him up like he should be.  I check on him about 3 other times a night, as our daughter still gets up at night, and he is fine the rest of the night.  I can't really take his blankets away as it has been below zero (like 10-15 degrees below zero plus a windchill on top of that) at night.      We keep a close eye on him, so it hasn't been a problem, but it makes me nervous. Any ideas on why he is doing this and how to stop it?
20090129034809AAbXjfK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How tall is your 21 month old?	This isn't something I'm like obsessed over or anything, and I am not at all concerned about my daughter's growth.  I just happen to think my daughter is short, but that doesn't matter, I figure she may be as I am only 5'3" and I am one of the tallest people on both sides of my family! And a lot of my husbands family short, like actually everyone except him and his dad!  My daughter has only grown a couple inches since she was 9 months old, and is still wearing 12 month pants (ones we bought her at 6 months old!), but she was a big baby at 21 inches and 9.5 lbs at birth.  She grew a lot the first 6-9 months than has slowed down.  She is currently 21 months and 32 inches tall.  My mother-in-law though constantly tells me how tall and huge my daughter is, and that she will "probably be at least 6 feet tall."  I will still love my daughter if she is, but it drives me nuts that she constantly tells me this, especially when my girl is approaching her 2nd birthday and is still in 12 month pants!        Sorry.... so how tall is your 21 month old and is it a boy or girl?  At 21 months my son was like 34.5 inches tall.

20090129035901AAqYy7k	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Adoption from foster care vs returning to bio parents, where do we draw the line?	When children are returned to previously abusive or chronically neglectful bio parents, how do we determine their level of fitness to parent?   I saw many children in my care return to far less than ideal homes, where they would no longer know if there was a square meal headed their way, if they were going to be spanked for saying the wrong thing, or even if they would be warm enough at night.  When I questioned the social workers on these aspects, I was told "it doesn't matter what a child's fed, as long as they're fed something".  Or, "spanking isn't illegal, as long as the child doesn't sustain injury, there's nothing we can do".   Essentially, I was told that "different families have different values".  Now I fully respect this, we all have our own opinions on child-rearing, however, who defines what is acceptable for a child to endure when you're talking about substandard care?      Social workers told me that children "always want to be with their natural families, no matter what.  If we possibly can we place them back there".  Who are they to speak on behalf of the children?  I had children cry, beg and plead to stay with me.  Instead their parents were deemed 'fit' and they were sent home.  I shudder to think of the lives those children live now, some of them I know their stories and it was a tragedy returning them to the care of their abusers.      Do you  think the pendulum has perhaps swung too far the opposite way, and our emphasis now is placed so firmly on family preservation that in the process we are condemning children to lives that we ourselves would be miserable in?

It has gotten out of hand, she will lie over the smallest things. She did something she was not supposed to do yesterday. I saw her do it and asked her about it and she lied. She lied three times and finally I told her I was giving her one more chance to tell the truth or I was going to have to spank her bottom. She paused for a minute and then lied again. I told her to come to me, and then she wanted to tell the truth when she saw I was serious about the spanking. I told her it was too later and I made her bend over and get four swats. I hope this works, I then explained the importance of telling the truth and told her the classic the boy who cried wolf story. I am not much of a spanker, her father usually does it. Do you think spanking was a good punishment? hopefully she remember her bottom stinging the next time she thinks about lying.
