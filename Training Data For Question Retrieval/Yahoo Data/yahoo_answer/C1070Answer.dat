xxtvhn5Naa	Date: February 1, 2009   Stadium: Raymond James Stadium   City: Tampa, Florida   Favorite: Steelers by 7   National anthem: Jennifer Hudson   Coin toss: Roger Craig, John Elway and Lynn Swann   Referee: Terry McAulay   Halftime show: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band   Network: NBC   Announcers: Al Michaels and John Madden   Cost of 30-second commercial: $3 million           Super Bowl XLIII, an American football game that will decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2008 season, is scheduled to be played on February 1, 2009, with kickoff at 6:20 PM Eastern Time (23:20 GMT), at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida.    It will feature the American Football Conference champion Pittsburgh Steelers (14-4) and the National Football Conference champion Arizona Cardinals (12-7) . Of historical note, this game matches up two franchises previously merged into a single team (Card-Pitt) for the 1944 season in response to the depleted rosters during World War II. Pittsburgh will be going for its sixth Super Bowl win, which would place it in sole possession of the record for most Super Bowl wins, while the Cardinals are seeking their first league title since 1947 and only the second undisputed league championship in their history. It is the third Super Bowl in history to feature two pre-expansion era (pre-1960) teams, joining Super Bowl XIV (Steelers vs. Los Angeles Rams) and Super Bowl XLI (Indianapolis Colts vs. Chicago Bears). It will be also the first time that two quarterbacks who previously started for a Super Bowl winning team (Kurt Warner and Ben Roethlisberger) will oppose one another since Jim Plunkett's Los Angeles Raiders defeated Joe Theisman's Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XVIII.          The seeds of Super Bowl XLIII can be traced back to the end of the 2006 season. After winning Super Bowl XL in 2005, the Pittsburgh Steelers had dropped to a 8-8 record the following year. At the end of 2006, Bill Cowher ended his 15-year tenure as their head coach, leaving with a 149-90-1 record and a 12-9 record in the playoffs. Offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt and assistant head coach Russ Grimm were widely considered the front-runners to succeed Cowher in Pittsburgh.    However, without waiting to see if Pittsburgh would hire him, Whisenhunt accepted the head coaching job with the Arizona Cardinals, a team that held the second longest championship drought in U.S. sports (1947, with only the Chicago Cubs last winning their championship in 1908) and had never advanced to the Super Bowl in their franchise history. The Steelers then passed over Grimm and instead hired Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Mike Tomlin. Once Tomlin was hired by the Steelers, Grimm joined Whisenhunt in Arizona in the same position as assistant head coach as he had in Pittsburgh.          The AFC Champion Steelers are staying at the InterContinental Tampa and will hold their pre-game practices at the University of South Florida. The NFC Champion Cardinals are based at the Grand Hyatt Tampa Bay and will hold their practices at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' training facility. Both teams arrived in the Tampa area in Monday, January 26.    Also on January 26, the NFL announced that the Super Bowl game will be one of the safest places in the United States during game time. Personnel from over 20 different federal agencies will be on site to help assist in protecting players and fans.    Pittsburgh enters the game as seven-point favorites over Arizona. Major factors for this include the Steelers defense compared to the Cardinals, and the feeling that the AFC is an overall better conference than the NFC.    The Cardinals will be the designated "home team", as is the case for all NFC champions in odd numbered Super Bowls. Arizona has chosen to wear their red jerseys. The team has worn red at home since moving into University of Phoenix Stadium in 2006 after predominantly wearing their white jerseys at home for their first 18 years in Arizona to combat the intense heat of September and October. As a result, the Steelers will wear white jerseys for the second consecutive Super Bowl.    Entering the game, Pittsburgh is 2-0 lifetime wearing white jerseys in the Super Bowl, wearing them as the "visiting team" against the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IX (back when the designated "home" team was required to wear their team colored jerseys and not given the option, this changed in Super Bowl XIII, when the Dallas Cowboys opted to wear their traditional home whites, forcing the Steelers to wear black) and against the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XL despite being the "home team" that season due to the team's road success in the playoffs and the team consistently wearing their black jerseys in home games. In addition, teams wearing white jerseys in the Super Bowl are on a four-game winning streak entering Super Bowl XLIII, dating back to Super Bowl XXXIX, currently the longest such streak between white and team colored|`|UULgRsDSaa	3:00  feb 1st  steelers vs. cardinals    don't know the channel, but I know its one of the main ones (cbs, nbc, or abc)|`|J9jAwJ6saa	Pittsburgh Steelers vs Arizona Cardinals    Feb 1     6 pm ET NBC|`|efonvqTmaa	6:17 PM   Fox 5  Arizona Cardinals Vs.

Back then, when the Green Bay Packers "ruled-the-roost", the SuperBowl was a football game, and a good one, and NOT some commercialized "extravaganza".  Ever since SuperBowl III, when Joe Namath came on the scene to lead his NY Jets to defeat the Baltimore Colts, the SuperBowl has increasingly lost its focus as a football game as opposed to some low-rank "entertainment" show.

First because it's just baseball in general, and because I get to see the talent that's coming up in the system, you know, the future players. (:    Plus, I go to a lot of Triple A games because the Scranton/Wilkesbarre Yankees' stadium is only about a half an hour away from me, and I know a lot of the players I'm watching.     Looking forward to an exciting season, (:|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	My Brewers head to Phoenix and on February 25 to play the Athletics. I am very excited for the games to start.

It is something that I look forward to every year.|`|XrCc85kNaa	What is your question??|`|sHXazyDWaa	Spring training games usually begin in the first 2-3 days of march. Sometimes the Florida teams will play exhibition games against college teams in the last couple days of February
xQFWjFyZaa	I think 3-4, 8-9 are the best because your picks are reasonably spaced out. 5, 6, and 7 is an area where talent can drop off and leave you not knowing what to do. The first few picks of a draft are pretty much locked before it starts. Hanley, Pujols, and A-Rod are guaranteed top 5 unless you play with idiots. A lot of people like the turns(1, 12) because you get two picks in a row but I get impatient when I have to wait an hour for it to get back around to me. You want enough time to plan your next pick with a few alternates but short enough so you're not screaming HURRY UP! to your league mates.|`|gUMucKOkaa	Have drafted all over of course since it is random or based upon the previous year finish.    I really like the last/first spots in the first and second rounds, etc. You don't get the Pujols (my favorite player), but you do get two first rounders so to speak for example. I find myself usually trying to decide between two players so this way, I get them both. lol.    Actually, any place is fair but your strategy has to change accordingly.  Keep doing some mock drafts and see how it goes.    Good luck.|`|gvMr9lMbaa	I like picks 1-12.First u get the first choice and second u get back to back picks next and can really have a nice 3.Also it does not take an hour most drafts are done in a hour so that one guy is wrong.|`|2meTcR8laa	11-12 since you can see what people missed out on and draft them and/or acquire them from free agency, good question I never really thought about it like that ;)|`|tfEuBhpzaa	I love to be right in the middle of the draft.  I feel if you are on one of the ends then you can miss out on position runs and can sometimes have to reach to  make up for it.   You know the round last year where 6 closers go and you are sitting there wondering if you should pick Isringhausen because you want one more closer and he is the only one left on the board.  You often think that there is multiple of a position left so it will get back to you, but it is 22 picks away and you could get in trouble.  Anyways, I hate the ends of the draft and can't stand when someone thinks they are clever by picking two guys on the same team with back to back picks.

OHs8yJiOaa	You might need to be properly fitted for shoes. If you're wearing cotton socks instead of a tech fabric, they may not be handling moisture properly for you, too.    You can try using something like Body Glide to minimize fresh friction when you go running.    Other times you can put something like Aquaphor or lotion on your feet to help keep them hydrated. You can also look into soaking them in water with bath salts and comparable stuff.    I personally swear by Aquaphor, which is similar to Vaseline but not greasy, and much more effective for stuff like this.|`|KoJ0rddfaa	put on lotion?|`|Rt6ajbqoaa	try putting lotion on before bed and then sleeping with socks on. The socks will help keep the moisture on your skin so it can soak it up. Also you might want to try exfoliating with a foot scrub to get rid of the excess dry skin that has built up on your feet. If your running shoes are causing this much trauma on your feet, they may be too small or possibly too old and need to be replaced. Hope i helped :)|`|0bzIkdyOaa	you might also want to get some athletes foot cream and apply it, you could have it and it takes about 4 weeks applying twice daily for it to go away. For the rough dry skin sounds like callouses you can soak your feet and take a pumice stone and slowly smooth them away. callouses will build up where shoes rub to protect the feet from getting blisters and then apply lotion daily. using a pumice stone will take a little time as if you rub to hard the pumice can scrape your feet. You description of what is happening doesn't totally sound like athletes foot but there are several types if over the counter remedies don't work you may want to see a doctor as if left untreated your feel can dry and crack deeper being painful.

T13xM9iJaa	He would be in a match with Shane at No Way Out and will compeat at WM25 and this is why I think that.    This plan was set up by Randy and Stephanie and this is how    I mean look at it Stephanie wants all the power and is a 4th generation diva so what dose she do ask Randy to take out her dad and in return she will not only join Legacy but give Randy equal power as GM. So now that Vince is out of the picture, Shane is next. What is gonna happened is that over the next few week leading up No Way Out they are going to be hyping this storyline. Then at No Way Out Steph is gonna make some match like a no DQ match or something like that during the match both Randy and Shane are gonna be going back and forth then Shane is just weak and can't go on that is when Randy will punt Shane. Then being that Steph is ringside she run in to check on Shane then she get up with a VERY angry face then turn around and starts to smile and shake hands with Randy. Revealing that she and Randy where working together all along.    Also history shows that Stephanie has turn on her family to gain more power.|`|Jy7t6grDaa	yes|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	I predict Steph will get punted next.|`|AA10691319	He has won the right to Wrestlemania, so the only way to deny him that would be for him to be in violation of his contract.  now with that said, i will garentee that shane and stephanie will not make it an easy two months for orton.|`|LxBwmRTlaa	Nothing will happen to him and yes he will go to wrestlemania.|`|NvT0IE5aaa	here is what i think should happen Stehephen Mchahon should erither suspend him or fire him and give his wrestlemania shot to Rey Mysterio|`|L0eI2zM6aa	well i thought his punishment would be not going to wrestlemania but since shane came and tried to beat up legacy i think he will,i think that was Sukey punishment|`|gTEAPM9Xaa	idk i hate randy orton!!!!!|`|BQqI0REEaa	I wish he would leave wwe. I cant stand the ground he walks on or the air he breathes.|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	Yes and I also hope he goes to Smackdown so Edge can return to Raw where he belongs.
bc5KJdaFaa	cut then sew them back together, although lots of people use a square knot it works better to sew it|`|dKq7DZkbaa	If you are crafty you could cut the straps in the back and put in a hoop to make the straps tighter. Or you could try shortening the straps.|`|9D9f1bIxaa	get  a pair of spandex  they  work just as good|`|L7uz5Xmzaa	You could do that or sew some other kind of fabric strips to tie it with. You may even b able to use elastic (the 3/4 to 1 in think kind.) That way you NEVER have to tie it!
8hIs3dHsaa	It is not easy. Try for Varsity and then if you get cut play JV(Junior Varsity) Start running, hitting the batting cages, fielding grounders and fly balls, start practicing pitching, and lift some weights and make a plan for it. Hope this helped and good luck.     P.S. Please pick me for best answer|`|iz5zDFxvaa	Like all other sports, you have to compete with others to try to impress the coach to pick you for a certain spot on the team. Nothing is easy these days, except maybe running cross country or being on the wrestling team.|`|FO9WK7kjaa	Baseball coaches should allow every one a chance to be in the roster of course if you do not try your best you will get cut. Or even worst of all the coach will not put  you in and you will get a spot in the bench. If you really want to make an impression it is better to take the sport seriously and not joke around when some one wants to teach you something. If you are not in shape start thinking about it so you can make a good impression on your first day.|`|qmG3q9Nmaa	You need to sell yourself.  Pick what your best off and show him that you know why he will pick you.  Because if you know why you are good; and you are not trying to hit HR's when you are not powerful; and it will impress him.  Like me I was a runner, strong defensivley, and I got walked alot.  My avg. was.243 but my OBP was.412 because of my ability to steal bases.  Try your hardest.  It least you can't say you didn't try.|`|0e3d21f52ae8d3a44a6dd71d8d2fbeafaa	as sad as this sounds..... no one gets a fair chance. the coach already has an idea who he is going to pick before the tryouts start.     at my school we have a baseball class and everyone on the team the previous year is in the class for the next year and we all lift weights and hit and "practice" to get ready for the season.    so coming in your junior year and trying out will be tough... but not impossible.    i am an outfielder as well,, and my advice.. is go for it.   first things first, dress the part. look like you know how to play the game. once you get out there hustle your *** off on every play. take the right angles and sprint for every ball. when throwing to your cut off or a base, throw it hard and straight.. no rainbows. play 150%  before try outs.. throw every day.. work on long toss to strengthen your arm. and hit. hit off a tee. hit at the cages. anything to get you swinging a bat. and RUN. condition your body.. you need to be able to run all out.    just work hard and you will get it. good luck!|`|KWxwishQaa	work your *** of get in shape and deffinetley get your arm in shape it matters how good of a highschool you go to make sure your arms in shape
aa30097e8a8b6000ee807296e82bc381aa	TO is the man.  The problem with TO (he may or may not know this) is Dallas is the only team he can play for.  He can't be TO in Jacksonville or Seattle or many other teams in the NFL.      He's as attached to a good QB as any great receiver's ever been.  The spotlight too, the numbers speak for themself.  But he's nowhere without a Romo, McNabb or even the younger Jeff Garcia.      He needs the limelight as Dallas provides but he needs a QB that can get him the ball to do his thing.  The only other place that is suitable for him is NY Giants (if Plaxico can't make it back).  Or a team like Atlanta, big gun QB that can get him the ball deep, opposite of Roddy White.      He'll play the part of the good citizen for awhile.  He knows without Dallas, there's not many places to go, especially many places to go where he can be TO. But I believe that's strictly up to him and how he handles this offseason.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	I read that too..... I see Jessica Simpson is gaining a few pounds, maybe she is beefing up to be Romo's receiver.|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	idc about dallas or t.o to much drama in dallas shouldnt even be a football team anymore! what has happend to the cowboys!?|`|9XxQJLqUaa	im a dallas cowboys fan too!, terrel owens was interviewd by espn at a lakers game last week and t.o. said that he will be a cowboy until the day he retires, so thats great news for the cowboys.|`|efonvqTmaa	At the beginning of the offseason they said they were but because jerry jones likes him so much i guess hes gonna stay 4 a long timmee  even if he does leave dey got roy williams whos like a younger version of t.o,|`|tEW4SjBnaa	I hope so I'm a Cowboys fan as well but I can't take another season of Me.O. T.O. The guy is not an elite receiver anymore he drops to many balls when it counts.  He quits on routes if he knows it's not coming to him. My 2 yr old niece blocks better than him, if anyone thinks he is so great your as stupid as any team who's picked him up(yes even dallas).  T.O. will quickly learn the NFL is a Business and his days are numbered  It was a mistake in the first place but i think Jerry Jones ego will bring him back.    p.s.   Parcells left cause of T.O. and took Sparano with him thank jerry for that.

Idk.|`|XQZEa7oOaa	Orton has too much talent to be on Smackdown. Edge should be on Raw. HHH is only there to do is father in-law a favor to save a crappy show. Taker as much as I love him, is getting old. Jeff is a drug user and cannot be counted on to be at every show. Raw is the top talent show. Smackdown and ECW are the punishment and not ready for Raw shows.|`|w173betxaa	Randy Orton uis going to SmackDown because he's going to face Edge and MVP in a Triple Threat for the WWE Championship at WM25.|`|2rJwgk40aa	Yeah,hes scared of Taker.He already fought him once,He doesnt want a repeat.    Honestly,theres no reason for Orton to go to SD.Edge is the main heel there,they dont need a heel.Raw,on the other hand,wouldnt have a main heel.|`|NW39CoLKaa	He sucks, trust me.

They do not get to choose which brand they want to go to, so shut-up. And what's so big about the undertaker, edge, HHH and jeff hardy anyway?    A question to the rest of you, since John Cena (a.k.a Miss Piggy) is WHC and "we can't see him", why doesn't he go to SmackDown and take on undertaker, etc?|`|RxRYlOblaa	Randy orton is probably just afaraid of triple h and the undertaker    and to the million dollar man, on ECW the gm said that matt hardy is going to smackdown|`|F6Q92Qmoaa	randy ortons a ***** sooo. ya he's afraid  and ps  wrestling is all staged and fake so it doesnt matter ahhaa  ;)|`|fKuvMPCiaa	Who cares?

I'm not his fan, but even I could say that no, he could go there any day and I don't think he's going anywhere as far as trading/new contract is concerned. I don't think he's going anywhere until the 2009 lottery. Matt Hardy could go to Smackdown, now there's something.|`|WOTSmX6jaa	he is little ***** And Afraid Of Undertaker|`|r5RKJa1Raa	Wrestling is fake. If you're a hardcore fan then you say it's "Scripted" but any way you look at it Randy Orton is not afraid to go to Smackdown at all. The question is why is he ACTING scared. And the answer is to establish a fanbase so he can make an unsuccessful action film and make an easy 5 mil...|`|6Ro48ZhMaa	1. its scripted not fake 300 pounder coming off the turnbuckle onto someone else hurts alot so the fighting is fake but the pain is not    2. you people who come on here just to say its fake are stupid you go in the ring and let Undertaker choke slam you or Kane power bomb you and then you can come back and say its fake idiots

I don't see Hossa going anywhere w/ the contributions he is making to the Wings. They know he is only a 1 year shot and I think they  are going to play it out to the end w/ him.    I know it sounds crazy, but I wouldn't be too shocked to see the Wings make a move for a veteran D man, maybe trading Lebda and/or Meetch.|`|eCvm71URaa	i dont think vinny lecavelier is going anywhere. its only rumors. hossa's contract isn't up yet so he won't be leaving. atleast not yet. gaborik? i don't know. there was a rumor going on earlier in the year that he was coming to pittsburgh for jordan staal(it never happened). i think he will probably stay unless another team really wants him. my team is the penguins and i REALLY think they need to make some trades so we can be a much better team. thats all i gotta say :)

J3kfQtViaa	Watching him this year would lead me to say no.  I didn't get to watch him that much in college except for a few times when he led bc to a miraculous comeback, you know i mean we dont like baughston down here, but after seeing him this year i was asking myself if i was missing something about boston college football. lol.  Anyway, i dont see more pressure being on him next season than this one, other than to get to the playoffs.  That is where i would say hey i dont know.  I mean even the most dominant team in the last decade can miss the playoffs.  I will say this though he looks 10x better than vick.  With vick it was always, jive during interviews, flick fans off, try to take marijuana onto an airplane, etc.  Eventually leading up to his house in va getting raided.  Ryan has given us a good year and whats more important he has shown (at least for now) that he can set an example on and off the field.|`|gHtI5xe7aa	Id say no, as long as they dont put him on the cover of madden.|`|MPDgKgIxaa	No Matt Ryan is the real deal.    http://americanfootballtopics.blogspot.c...  http://americanfootballpredictions.blogs...  http://nflstadium.blogspot.com|`|xxtvhn5Naa	naw... he wont rock... but i dont think he will stink either|`|9f2391ebf6a1c505bb9421899963d771aa	A little, bc the schedule willl be harder since they won 11 or 12 games|`|48c83727f449473c97be31a3baff4f99aa	No  Matt Ryan will be o.k.|`|NSgSaspAaa	He could definitely step back in his second season. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see the Falcons take a big step back. They took everyone by surprise this season and next year they'll be expected to do the same or better.|`|XLIjwvNXaa	Yes, I totally think a 8-8 4-12 season.|`|bpWtrb7Haa	He will be good, if not better, as long as Michael Turner is healthy.  If Turner goes down with an injury, and the Falcons have to rely on Ryan's arm to win games, he may struggle.      Eventually, "Matty Ice" will be good enough to carry the Falcon's offense on his own, but keep in my mind he's still a young QB.|`|gBfPkdroaa	possibly, he took his opponents by surprise this season with him and micheal turner. but we'll have to see      Matt Ryan has some potientil if he can keep his cool tho.|`|nJGCWO0Paa	I would like to see him and Michael Vick have a standing gunfight where they both lose|`|4KTe107Yaa	Hey what's up girl  History seems to repeat itself in football. teams usually know how to stop somebody after there is film on him.

Z0IKiIJ4aa	fake is not the right word, cuz u cant fake some of those moves, and some of those falls and slams.     Wrestling is more real than movies, cuz even though both are for entertainment, these guys are much more real.|`|SOuezSW2aa	no!!!!!!!!|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	Yes it fake, everything is staged before they go on.    If you look closely (well actually, its way more noticable now) When the superstars are fighting, you'll notice that their feet and fist never touch when they are punching and kicking each other.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	is scripted entertainment  well Pamela Anderson boobs are fake but wwe is scripted|`|AA10691319	heres the skinny.  as far as the actual fighting, most stuff is designed to minnimize the actual damage (no closed fists for example) as far as the athleticism needed and the amount of training which they have to undergo on a daily basis, all that is real.|`|xO2fDqklaa	It is fake. It is scripted.|`|hVjxNhJWaa	Wrestling has been fake since its conception in the 1930's|`|IMQm9JTMaa	its scripted.    scripted simply means that the creative teams give the wrestlers a gimmick (the character they play). they put them in a match, and they say whos gonna win and how long the match will be.    but all the wrestling is real, you cant really fake getting hit by a ladder now can you?    so no its not fake.|`|02XHxknUaa	yes some like on 30% but the injusries are real.|`|BsLq5J7haa	its fake and real at the same time.......itz fake by the show beein planned but all the moves are real|`|95uXmC94aa	It's not fake in some way. The whole everything being scripted and stuff makes it fake. I wouldnt call it fake since it's still just a show you watch like spongebob or whatever. It's not nessacarly really watching soccer which isn't scripted but it still takes professional atheletes to wrestle. Just don't worry about it being fake or real. Enjoy it!|`|SsodRf4kaa	Wrestling was once real. By the 90's it began to grow faker. Today most of it is acting, but falling off ladders through tables is real.They made it fake to prevent injury to superstars. HBK has had the most real injuries so they don't want to risk anymore superstars except Jeff Hardy and Edge. But WWF, the good old days.|`|5vXgcAbCaa	It's scripted, not fake. There's a difference. WWE tells the wrestlers who will win, how long to go, and a few big parts of the match. That's all. It's up to the wrestlers how to do it. Some of those moves hurt. Weapons are modified to lessen the pain, but the impact still happens.|`|zczneZ7baa	its all fake dude...i figured tht out when i was 10 years old|`|TBu2iaPaaa	its not fake its scripted and just ignore them|`|RUrHwts8aa	WHAT?!?!?

4gwSrPhfaa	like the person in front of me said there is MMA for teens already it usually is not governed by any commission but its done between gyms, the problems its hard enough to get MMA sanctioned for adults for teens is going to be even more difficult and child advocates, conservatives, and any politicians wanting to build a name for themselves as having strong morals are going to be all over ,    i had my first full contact mma "smoker" a week before i turned 18, the guy who i fought must have been +30 ( he had his wife and kids there), every thing was legal except for knees to the head, i got a bad mouse under my eye other then that everything was fine     smoker can be dangerous but, if u have trainer looking out for u they will make sure that everything is on the up, plus smokers are good bc they allow fighters to get experience without it going on there record|`|7CNGokPVaa	Yes but it would have to be way more regulated than UFC cause the teenage body is still developing. And you would need parental consent.  But i would totally be down for teen MMA fights and i know a couple of my friend at the gym already can't wait til they turn 18.|`|cf3a64ff0b77dd5034a285108f675957aa	It would require more extensive safety regulations than regular MMA, but that's a decent idea.|`|5DUDsEwpaa	yes there are.  they let them fight in the cage but its illegal.  its called smokers    i know a couple of mma gyms that does that every month and not get caught by the commission|`|w9kSGLBxaa	The 17 year old phenom at our gym won the bantam weight title a little bit a go and is going to be defending it in February or March.

If anyone who reads this lives in OR & want more info I know of a couple places that promote legal, well organized fights for teens & adults as well as the subleague circuit in this area & I would be happy to give anyone the info.
CdAE4nXcaa	i don't think there is but there definitely should be but i doubt they will pass that, the athletic commissions are strict on adult fighters imagine how they would be for teens, just train hard until your able to fight.,|`|QKEYRzOiaa	They do have MMA for teens. It just depends where you are. And it's really for anybody. You go by weight classes, so it's not really by age, but there is a limit on how old you have to be.|`|67ZgA0PZaa	they don't have "ufc type" events for teens for legal reasons.  but they do have under 18 full contact point fighting.|`|v1mbL56caa	NO|`|616f37abb5f6bb497fbb33bae765a7e2aa	They do have leagues for teens.

For somebody who hasn't played soccer before, it is important to work on your endurance. You need to be able to keep running/jogging throughout your playing time without being short of breath. In order to do that you should time yourself while running laps or do intervals on a treadmill and if you continue this you will see improvement and start to work on speed.   Besides that, you should grab a ball and someone else, head out to your backyard or lawn and kick around the ball. Passing, dribbling, and controlling are very important. Set up cones or some type of markers with about a yard between each. Using one foot try dribbling through the cones/markers in and out in and out. Do the same with your other foot. The more you do this the easier it will be and the faster you will go taking at the most two touches between each cone.   Don't forget to hydrate.  Watch some youtube videos on soccer training.You can get some ideas that way too.|`|24WKJ6SPaa	well for both you need to run.....a lot.....for cross country basically its a mind thing...overcoming the pain of running.....for soccer though you should probly join a league to get an idea....just playing by yourself wont get you ready for team play|`|e81B9pDKaa	Well for cross country they practice running. So just start practice running. Like those running things at the gym. Or just start running to places or something. For soccer when I used to play they teach you how to dribble, (you need to run good to for it) they teach you how to pass back and forth to people and tons of other things. I would find another school or something that has full time soccer and cross country or just one either way.|`|acf2c4c647ac5cade01d5fbace174430aa	start running.  Start off slow and do short distances.  After a while start to run faster at the same distance.    Then run longer at a slow pace.  Then run that distance at a faster pace.      Build on like that if you know what I am trying to say.|`|ZIUK6UzRaa	well if you havent played soccer before, i suggest just getting familiar with the ball, that is definitely the first step. Just go out to a field with a soccer ball and dribble around, if you have any friends who play you could go out and pass with them, or anything like that. Just get comfortable with it, passing and dribbling right, and the rest will fall into place. Again, if you have friends who play, you could ask them to teach you the positions on the field, or just learn them if you join a league sometime.|`|rQG60W0Eaa	you good join a team like rec in softball in the summer or at your local ymca try to google it|`|m0SbpDkUaa	lots of jogging...eat pasta...that is supposed to be good...other than that idk|`|MwJBlbWYaa	run,run, and more running|`|Xce2KvGnaa	Take soccer out of your list. You need skills for that not just training.  Go for cross country. All you have to do is run or jog everyday until you think you are ready.|`|24bdcdc34da2c3f37a8684801cf27971aa	if you start running,.....that would help|`|A1yHDCwxaa	Get running! Thats the best way to get in shape for sports like that... build up stamina. Everyday you should be running! And yea, go ahead get some instruction, maybe join a team, soccer is fun! In my opinion, cross country is a lot more boring, but I suppose it is a lot easier to get into, since there aren't a bunch of rules n' stuff.|`|QLYBqDokaa	just run!!! as much as you can! and try to run more with every day. For soccer just try to keep the ball in your feet.try to run with it|`|NCvX4I0baa	One, don't overload on carbs like you've been told. That's only if you have a race and you need some carbs to burn the night before.    And Right now it is late to sign up and be played in soccer or cross country (on a school's sports team). Right now is basketball and wrestling and swimming season at schools. If you still wanna do soccer there could be local clubs you could join. For cross country, you have to work on endurance. So start cardio running 1 mile. and go up slowly at your own pace. Try to not stop and walk while running because ina race that's almost a guaranteed loss. You can slow down and slow jog but remember to be in a quick moving positions.      You don't just run, you have to work on speed, ask a running coach about intervals (or email me if you need to). You have to run hills and run hard miles.    good luck, and if you train now for cross country by the time next season comes around you're guaranteed to not come in last at a meet. Be Persistent.|`|QRLbF63daa	run|`|mFAzUh93aa	start running EVERY SINGLE DAY for at least ten minutes. try to keep running the whole time.   do some ab exercises too like crunches|`|nFlaPmnTaa	I ran cross country this year  and the most you can do is run   1. more often  2. at greater distances   3. faster    Don't overdo it  Run a big distance monday, then a smaller distance like 2 miles Tuesday, Than big Wednesday.... and so on and so on    On the nights before a run  Eat carbs: bread, pasta, fetticini alfredo is always good  or even protein like meat would be great too but carbs are the best    and hydrate hydrate hydrate  All the time you have to be drinking water  especially the night before the race    Drink so much it feels like you are about to puke and then drink some more haha    it's not as hard as it seems    What you put into it.. you will get out of  if you try hard you will get better  plain and simple  if you just kinda jog and don't try or get tired than you will not get any better and be doing nothing for you times    good luck =]  it's a lot more fun than it seems haha|`|nqOqaNIEaa	woooooooooooooooooooooow. run

Hail Pittsburgh.    http://www.cafepress.com/uncleoddball/63...|`|e5B5ITbhaa	Cardinals|`|py0DpCh4aa	cardinals|`|AA10304847	The Cardinal defense can stand up to the Steeler offense, the question though is can the Steeler scary defense shut down the impressive Card receivers?     The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     The "us against the world" mentality is the other big edge for the CARDS, used to win the last 3 playoff games.....|`|rzkFHAEJaa	idk, cardinals?|`|CtwEFHcqaa	Go cards prob. steelers|`|LjqoMHMJaa	Cardinals|`|gHtI5xe7aa	I think the steelers are gonna win, but I hope the cardinals whoop they A**

Mqurv3LXaa	I'm not sure what you are asking. Joe Sakic has been injured for most of the season. However, he could return in the late stages of the year. Joe was having a nice year up until the unfortunate injury.
5VKBBsA0aa	Most people think allowing the teams play head to head is the only fair way to decide which team is truly the best. With the way the current system is, there are usually a handful of teams in debate for the top two positions which means there is no true winner.    I do not think, however, that a playoff system will truly eliminate all the controversy. If, for example, you had an eight team playoff you would just create a new controversy over who the top eight teams are. The team that ended up number nine would likely complain that they deserve to be in the top eight and we really haven't gotten anywhere from where we are now.     Also, just as in all sports, the best team doesn't always win on the field other way. In college sports, if a number one team was eliminate in a playoff system, and say, a two loss team ended up winning everything, that original number one team, especially if they went undefeated in the regular season, could just proclaim they had a bad one game and still deserved to be the best.     All in all, although there is quite the controversy over the BCS, I really don't mind it. I think the quote about the ENTIRE season being a playoff is true. If you want to assure yourself a trip to the title game, you better win ALL your games. And, if your a team like Utah and you have a ridiculously easy schedule (yes I think the 39th ranked schedule is pretty easy), then you not only should win all your games, but you better not have any close calls!|`|gvMr9lMbaa	I don't agree with Thomas saying that if you had 8 teams then the 9th would complain.And that if a 2 loss team won it over an undefeated regular season team.Ask the patriots about that, a 6 loss team beat them and they deserved to win and pr|`|54587a005ce491d9b4862a09ef7af9acaa	no split national championships and, no snubs. the team with the richest history, isn't necessarily the best team EVERY year. and, there is nothing wrong about having the best teams, go head to head. that's the way it should be.|`|bGCeKuDMaa	There are many reasons why this would be a good way. One is that so many teams that finish the season with only one loss. How can you pick two teams out of 5-10 with the same record  to play in the championship? Plus the B(c)S leaves out great no BCS conf. teams like Utah and Boisie State. Finally college football is full of upsets and giving more teams a chance would increase that.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	With the BCS, teams are assigned their games based on several different polls. So basically, the "best" two teams ON PAPER are handed a trip to the national championship. In a playoff system, they would have to earn their way there, which makes a lot of sense. For example, Utah had an undefeated season. I don't think they'd beat Florida, Texas, Oklahoma, or USC. But they should at least get the chance to prove me wrong. Look at it compared to the NFL. Would ANYONE have put the Cardinals in the Superbowl based on their regular season play? Absolutely not. But they earned their way there and deserve their spot because they beat everyone standing in their way. The playoff system basically gives underdog teams the chance to win, and I think they deserve that chance. I think there ought to be an 8 team playoff system.|`|LVjM9k8yaa	Champions should be decided on the field not in the polls or by computers. Every sport other then D-1 college football decides their champion by a playoff. This year was yet another example of why the BCS doesn't work. Four other teams had the same record as Florida and nOU going into the NC game and one team had a better record yet they weren't allowed to play for that same championship. One of the teams with the same record as nOU even beat them in the regular season. How is that a better system of deciding a champion then putting all of those teams in a playoff bracket and letting the last one standing win? It's not!    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!|`|Io3VsAexaa	the problem with the BCS is that if you score a lot of points (oklahoma) you can still jump a team that you beat if you impress the computers.  if were gonna leave it all up to computers why even play the game?  it should be like the ncaa mens basketball tourny (not as big), where a committee of people select the 8 or 12 or 16 best teams, play the games, and crown a true national champion.
TFhf5skNaa	If you are going to ride switch a lot, get a "twin tip" with a "centered" stance.  That way the board will react the same in either direction.      I used to have a board that was almost a twin (but wasn't) and the stance was only 1.25 back.  I could feel the difference when I would switch it up.    I'm a big Burton fan but most major brands are similar.  The Burton Twin, Dominant,and Blunt are all true twins and mid-range in price.  I have an X-8, which is an ICS board.  It did come with plates to use your existing bindings, in case you don't want to buy bindings too.   Love it!!|`|1FGWFcljaa	a twin tip is best for riding swtich. the very best would be a true twin, twin tip and twin flex.|`|Hsyjt3wTaa	ROME is a traitor company. Go for Burton of Rossingnol. at 4'11" i would get a rossignol mini. Great twin tip and twin flex board and it should fit you almost perfectly.
AA12069128	Once while camping in Canada with my family as a child I had a weird/scary moment. I was a youngster (pre-teen) and had to go back to the cabin by myself to fetch something. When I was leaving the small bedroom area into the open living space I thought I saw a pair of boots move from the corner of my eye. I thought there was an intruder in there with me. I froze for what seemed like an eternity on one side of the wall fearing the intruder in the boots on the other. Finally I jumped around the corner and screamed...at an empty old pair of boots!|`|AA10025824	Along with 3 other big tough guys from the crew of a submarine I was on we scared the crap out of ourselves and ended up packing up and going home in the middle of the night.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	I went snow caving once with my wife's family.  We were dating at the time so I had to look cool and wear my contacts.  I have to wear the gas permeable, and you can't sleep in them.  So when we went to sleep in the snow cave, I popped my contacts out and put them in their case.  It was ten below zero that night.  The next morning I had to put them suckers in my eyeball at -10 degrees.  Could easily be one of the most painfull experiences of my life.  How many people can say they've had a contact frozen to their eyeball.  The second one was even worse, I knew what was coming.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	The sun was still shining at midnight...but we were in Antarctica during the austral summer.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	woke up with a pickle in my butt. no not really just sounds funny.hahaha  i did wake up in the middle of a lake on an inflatable bed once. those bastards i will get them yet.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	camping in a remote place where someone left their cows annd horses for the summer, one night a cow came in investigate the sugar I had in my tent, what a surprise, the cow made the tent collapse and scared the bejesus outta me, then I heard it's breathing, I thought it was a bear and kept me up the rest of the night. the next morning we found it's tracks and my friends had a good laugh at me, then the next night a horse got interested in my friends tent and did the same thing to them.  nothing's worse then karma is there? lol.|`|1njsqy0laa	My fellow campers decided it would be a good idea to put the bear bag directly above my tent.

Today, thought, I remembered an incident that goes back more than 30 years, when I was in Girl Scout camp.  I had a vivid dream about being by the campfire with the other girls.  In the morning, some of us were talking, and it turned out the whole troop had the SAME dream.  They even claimed that they remembered specific details, such as me tossing a small stick into the fire.      I still don't know how it happened.  Of course, my bratty big brother claimed that it was just a bunch of little girls convincing themself of something that never really happened, but I still remember that dream.  I believe it happened.      Was one person in the tent talking in her sleep, and thus influencing the dreams of all the others?

Y4mz8BShaa	You're aren't getting anywhere near 100 yards with and discernible accuracy with that POS, nor with an $80 bolt action. The cheapest worth buying is listed below, and I'd rather have it any any other.    Yes, it's a lot better than that R72.

Airsoft guns have a very short range. Perhaps 50 yards at best. The wind will also wreak havoc on the bb.|`|AA10056762	You are lying...he didn't hit you from 100 yards away. It was most likely 100 ft which is absolutely pitiful for a sniper rifle. You would be better off getting an AEG for around $100 and having it shoot 125ft on full auto. Anyway yes there are sniper RIFLES that can shoot out to 300ft. These rifles are HEAVILY upgraded and take hours and hours of fine tuning and tweaking on the rifle. The price tag will run you over $1000. Most stock sniper rifles have a MAXIMUM range of 200ft. With and EFFECTIVE range of 150-175. Anyone who keeps their rifle stock will just get beaten up by AEG's who can shoot almost as far with a heck of a faster rate of fire. Thats why you have to upgrade and modify a sniper rifle.    And by he way...crossman is terrible.
5573832243a1d5e3f002d23bed5be490aa	Good Luck with this one, the way the economy is right now not alot of busineses are wanting to sponsor. We are having the same issue with our slow pitch team!     Last year we could find one business to donate the entire amount we needed so we ended up asking several businesses to sponsor $50. Since we have several sponsors we couldn't call ourselves the "main stop, subway, mini mart, drug store,.... team" so we made up our own team name  that was unique and fun to us and then on the back of our shirts we had our number and name and below the number we listed all of our sponsors! Asking for only $50 was alot easier than $550 and businesses we more willing to sponsor. I think this is what we are going to have to end up doing this year as well!     Good luck!      edit on1/30/09: The "sport leg" user just copy and pasted my suggestion!|`|AA10025824	Go to local banks and bigger businesses who aren't already sponsoring a team.|`|uF31S9Dqaa	Given the economy, this will probably be a pretty tough venture. We've discussed it on the team I play on, and it never has gained much traction. But some things to consider:    -What value will the sponsor get in exchange for their financial investment?    -Assuming you're going with some kind of ad, how many eyes will see those ads? How many of them will patronize that business and help the owner recoup his investment and make a profit?    -If this is a feel good sponsorship, what is the feel good angle?    Remember that if you are promising signage at your games, some fields may have rules that prohibit you from hanging banners or putting up ads, so don't commit to that until you know the rules of where you'll be playing. Also - be honest about how many people come to your games and how many eyes are seeing the ad.    Something you should do if you find a sponsor - create an end-of-season recap package that includes photos and documentation of what their sponsorship got them and how it hopefully helped their business.    Remember - just because you land a sponsor doesn't mean that's all that goes into the process. Most likely they'll want some updates as to how the team is doing and they will want to see that their sponsorship is getting them some sort of benefit - which ultimately means more sales and dollars in the register.    Best of luck - and good luck with your upcoming season!

AbjC4p6aaa	it depends on the coach when you are trying out.  If you can't do flips, they may let you do something else. but be aware they want you to do flips to go to nationals...|`|23qMl5LXaa	Yeah, totally. My friend Maddie can't hardly do any tumbling, but she still cheers. Acctually it depends if you wanted Middle school, high school, or competitive cheerleading. For middle school and maybe high school you can get away with that. Not for competitive though. Work on flexibility. Practice splits even if they hurt mildly-medium pain. Try to get a back bend if you don't have that. Then try doing a handstand straight into a back bend. Then try a front walk over. Then try a front hand spring. Cheerleading has to do with raising spirit and cheering loud and being energetic. If your bouncy and smiley, you'll do fine in the non-competitive world of cheer.|`|n2O0NwR6aa	Cheerleaders don't often do cartwheels or handstands.  When they tumble, they do roundoffs, back handsprings and back tucks.  Most schools don't require those skills to make the squad - but the girls who can do them will score higher at tryouts, and have a better chance of making it.  So whether you can make it without tumbling just depends on who else is trying out, and what they can do.    At my school, every girl on the freshman squad can tumble like crazy.  That's because there just happens to be a lot of gymnasts in our freshman class - and a bunch of them tried out for cheer this year.  People who couldn't tumble just couldn't compete with them at tryouts.    On the other hand, very few girls on our JV squad can tumble.  For some reason, not many of our sophomores have ever done gymnastics or tumbling.  So as long as they had good jumps, dance and motions, they didn't have to worry about not being able to tumble.    So it all depends on who you're competing against.  But just to be safe, why not take a tumbling class?|`|vtR5277laa	ya you can.. just get really strong so u can do stunts the whole time|`|3c3a6998da4c577a09bc2789d0d7787caa	Some teams don't require tumbling skills. Even if your team does require it, you could still make it, as long as you are flexible, have good motions, jumps, cheer/chant/dance skills, have spirit, and show the potential to be able to tumble.

He has been very impressive since he has started playing regularly for the first team. However there is nothing sane about Spurs and Redknapp is like Arthur Daley in the transfer market. Keane should stay at Liverpool and wait for Benitez to go which I think will not be long now.|`|tfotPdeZaa	eh dont listen its probably some gooner writing all this stuff.
AA12034105	Nooooo never !!!  It's Rafa's for ever and ever and ever and ever and so on haha :P|`|	I dont think so not anytime soon anyway|`|	Yes of course -Federer will be back in the No 1 spot soon.|`|	Yeah,Federer,but it's unlikely.|`|	federer|`|	no, right now , he is unstoppable
ziPiHdcHaa	I would say John Elway, He is a great guy. Second choice would be Peyton Manning. And Tony Dungy|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Manning. The elder.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Justin Tuck for the Giants, Jerome Bettis for the Steelers, John Elway of the Broncos...|`|MbcvI1A9aa	as a raven fan i was happy 2 see bob sanders from the colts get a ring.hes a great player who has so much heart. even though the colts abounded baltimore they are a great team with "team players" who aren't selfish all they time and worried about how much $$$ is in their contract.|`|ndopqX6Taa	Derrick Brooks, great player and class act. Always had a ton of respect for him.|`|ntLUHiTAaa	my son is gay too|`|AA11464128	Tom Brady... He needs another one to match Joe Montana.|`|Ph5EkwwNaa	the bus   jerome bettis|`|FtkoBEVpaa	Jerome Bettis.  Nobody was more deserving.|`|B5BWocvZaa	peyton manning. he deserved one. and the bus|`|Dd4BKOeqaa	I am a giants fan and i loved it when brady got the ring in 2001. He has so much class and it makes me happy that the patriots aren't all bad people with attitudes. (Randy MOss)|`|fk30FQz2aa	Peyton Manning. If not he would have been similar to Dan Marino.|`|uEMyWOHnaa	This is a tough one. I immediately thought of Steve Young's win over San Diego, but I think the real answer is John Elway.    Even though I love the Packers, it was great seeing him finally win his first ring. The second one, however, could have gone to Chris Chandler. No reason to be greedy. ;)
mSZoMKD6aa	Who do you think we are Rangers.    Isnt it funny when your champions for 3 seasons in a row that the wee teams like Rangers would find glory in the smallest of places. I say give them a nice shiny egg cup and they will add it to their trophy room.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	lmao at Bluebell - Naka had a brilliant game, what were you watching|`|bej55wxUaa	Joking aside, Chas, Celtic look like they are struggling to cope playing more than one game a week.  Thank your lucky stars that they are nowhere near as successful as Rangers were last season.    As opposed to Martin O'Neill's side of shrinking violets who reached the UEFA final, Adele ?    3 bruising centre-backs, Lennon kicking everything that moved, and Sutton the helicopter or Hartson providing the twinkle-toe stuff up front.  Take Larsson out of that side and your left with hammer-throwers.  Thompson who was sent off how many times V Rangers, and Petrov the Trident submarine, complete the ensemble.    Horses for courses.  Last season's Rangers team cost a fraction of the Celtic side and equalled their achievement.  Plus they could win away from home.    Michy - still in Europe after Christmas - doh !|`|S0LSmJ9haa	nowhere near as succesful as Rangers Billy?    oh yeah sorry defending your way to a UEFA final was success in your eyes wasn't it?  apart from that we are in the same boat are we not?|`|bzwSCm6taa	don't worry chas you can play your superstars who didn't show tonight..you know mcgeady..big jan..wee naka.....nitey night..lol|`|cTTmHn9paa	How on earth Big Chief were Rangers more succesfull than Celtic last season?????    Rangers - Champions of nowhere  Celtic - Champions of Scotland|`|QfAlbKH9aa	its a disgrace making us play football lol they're all against us    big Chief thinks rangers equalled celtic achievement lol. yous disgraced yourselves on and off the pitch and were easily beaten in manchester n yous never came up against much en route but still played for a draw in most matches|`|e17700eb327636de22fc84eb20b45234aa	I heard that recently, some club in blue strip lost to a team that was full of wodka drinkers, thats why they didnt when the title, so i was told. Me thinks they lost form a lottery number    4-5-1    why they lose
bzwSCm6taa	lol bitchy bitchy.......|`|e17700eb327636de22fc84eb20b45234aa	I'd like to see Boyd in another league, just for a season so we see how many goals he scores. Nothing against the lad, but we know his record in big games    Plenty of big games coming up to prove me wrong soon too. I wanna see it, him score, even an assist or two, in a match that matters against good team.    Me sound like Cheif at end|`|gGyMPfM0aa	only the smaller teams so i guess he will not score chas well fingers crossed|`|lsXcvlTbaa	Unless the diving turncoat (let's see how many violations I get this time for using that phrase) is sold before then of course.|`|S0LSmJ9haa	I see Walter and Ally were at the game..sorting out the defensive tactics for saturday lol

I certainly didn't hear anyone shout that  he didn't get the penalty...we won    no cheating refs, no cheating linesman, just a figment of a silly indian wannabe's imagination|`|mHnNibApaa	BOLLOCKS !!lol  who wus the knight of st columba in the black !! when looverns should have been sent off|`|lKdLsRPDaa	Who cares, only you it seems.     It was never a penalty, Robson just made a meal of it. For gods sake, a player dives and tries to get a penalty, shock, horror, this type of thing never goes on, does it.     I've sung "who's the mason in the black", I've shouted it on many ocassions, as well, it's not paranoia, it's just a laugh, it does not mean I really believe he is. Stop being so fecking anal about it. I'm not paranoid, even if we had gone out, I would never had brought up the Robson incident, because it was never a penalty.|`|lsXcvlTbaa	Not sure who he was but he has an absolute shocker. Then listen on car radio after game and they think he was excellent?!!? Dont think it was after that incident that it was sang, think it was when Crossas was brought down at the half way line. Anyway like I said he was abysmal|`|e17700eb327636de22fc84eb20b45234aa	Ginger boy sucked cheif, he no warrior. No Paranoia, we just no many buffalo at Celtic Park, whilke Ibrox has only prairie dog to skin, much more wampum at East End    Rangers need Sitting Bull    Ugh|`|5Agn35EKaa	Should change your name to big chief radar ears if you could hear one fan out of all the ones there.
bzwSCm6taa	ffs billy you have certainly reeled them in tonight..bloody hilarious......keep up the good work.....|`|lsXcvlTbaa	Oh dear Billy, that how desperate things have got that you are already relying on the tiredness of other teams. LMAO. Maybe you should be asking why Skinty decided to fire out another few moonbeams instead of asking for help identifying the fans who shamed Scotland on Crimewatch. Guilty by association. Hows the stadium plans coming on by the way? lol|`|e17700eb327636de22fc84eb20b45234aa	Why youem always say 4-2? Why that factor? Why you no say 4 in row, or 1-nill? Me wanna know|`|8kpvTUQaaa	4-2....Celtic have lost 4-2 twice this season...is that some sort of sore point with their fans.....why is that?|`|sGDSotWAaa	and who won the last old firm game ?????????????|`|5Agn35EKaa	Big chief you totally underestimate Dundee United as a team, at the end of the day Celtic are through. If Rangers had played Dundee United instead of Falkirk the boot may have been on the other foot. So away home to your wee squaw and stop talking claptrap.|`|AA10464717	LOL     'who won the last old firm??  It was celtic  - did you not see it?  No tv or License??  Rangers won the 1st old firm of the season 4-2 - incase you missed that too.    Sorry Big cheif, what was the question again, I got lost looking at some of the answers to what actually was the question.  That and River city was on my mind.     Rangers have had a good few nights.  This weekend hopefully better get Utd at home and obviously they be ;tired'.  A new manager at Inverness hopefully giving them a ego boost and celtic being 'tired'.  Though the best laugh I heard this week was a few celtic fans wanting celtic to have this weekend off LOL  they knackered after last night.  LOL|`|2sxiHRvzaa	i smell fear.rangers have a great record agianst d utd dont they.scraped a draw a t ibrox with the boy that is oot injured.oh dear,i smell fear.floods of tears|`|S0LSmJ9haa	aye and don't forget their debut on Crimewatch last night and their chairman's speech today!    no Billy you really couldn't make it up!!|`|1d9b5228edfe6d8363220570ff4e828caa	christ billy you ken its getting bad when an "excellent" couple of nights for rangers is a win over falkirk and celtic getting taken to extra time by dundee united.    naw...you couldnae make it up eh?|`|EsTAylwIaa	was there tonight and the game was ok pitch was a bit of a shambles but big chief i think it would have made better viewing than the rangers game as for the weekend we will win hey big chief you forget who their manager is now points in the bag anyway off to get something to eat and then bed nite nite x
BiMkowVMaa	I've been saying this for a while. Shut up... get back on defense. It's the coaches job to talk to the refs. For the star players in the league Kobe, LeBron, Duncan, KG, Wade and so forth it may influence a call later on in the game. I don't like make up call though and hate any special star treatment towards players.    It's one thing to talk after a foul is called, another to yell while the game is going on for a non-call.    In general and as a fan of basketball I hate seeing it. I want to chuck my remote at the TV every time i see a Laker arguing with a ref and letting their guy go and get a wide open shot on the other end because they're too busy complaining.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	Sometimes they do reverse them, and the players plant a seed in the referees minds, so they get the next call.|`|RfbpvqSWaa	I argued once that an offensive foul is not a team foul and the other team did not get to shoot freethrows against us.|`|wHdrezlmaa	to get the refs more focused in the game in hopes that they wont make another supposedly bad call.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	well players like derek fisher actually debate with them. it sometimes changes the outcome the next time.

rJMZdp04aa	I hear voices in my head  The council me  They understand  They tell me things that I will do  They show me things I'll do to you  They talk to me, they talk to me    You got your rules and your religion  All designed to keep you safe  But when rules start getting broken  You start questioning your faith  I have a voice that is my savior  Hates to love and loves to hate  I have the voice that has the knowledge  And the power to rule your fate    I hear voices crying  I see heroes dying  I taste the blood that's drying  I feel the tension rising      All the lawyers are defenseless  All the doctors are disease  And the preachers all are sinners  And the police just take the grease  All you judges you are guilty  All the bosses I will fire  All you bankers will have losses  And politicians are all liars    I see darkness falling  I hear voices calling  I feel justice crawling  I see faith has fallen      As you can tell:    They tell him Things that he should do , They show him things He'll do to You.  They Council Him.  He has a Savior.    Pretty Much - They Tell him - "PUNT , PUNT , RKO , RKO , RKO , I have IED".|`|nzKo4TFvaa	song sucks|`|eJDRyYNaaa	Maybe he eats drugs with Jeff Hardy that's why he hears voices in his head, while Jeff Hardy sees writings on the wall after a dose of crack.|`|pmjOiQFvaa	dey just be saying PUNTTT PUNNNTTT PUNNTTTT THE MOO F**KAH PUNTTT|`|fvMv1DT3aa	They tell him to punt people in the head.|`|53986a54fb7e28986e6d815651923852aa	The voices in Randy Orton's head tell him things that he will do and  show him things he'll do to others.|`|tCWwQfYNaa	Thats just a song|`|59r8mfsfaa	I don't know, but they need to tell him that he needs anger management classes.|`|kPcmUf9saa	Obviously how to win a match oh wait.. he doesn't need that cuz he already owns!|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Apparently: "I hear voices in my head, they council me, they understand, they talk to me"|`|Y93pUmAGaa	they say       "randy , you have IED you loser" :) lmao|`|l6g3moiEaa	They seem to talk to him and understand. They've also been known to tell him things that he should do (like apparently sticking his nose so far out there into things that don't concern him that he had to kick an old man in the head...), they tell him things he'll do to you, too. They... talk... to him.|`|5Hh4Stj8aa	For anyone who gets George Carlin references, "Take a s*** on the salad bar at Wendy's!"|`|VuIxxJvqaa	Maybe its like peer pressure.

Owie, this hurties, I look silly now.    Randy, Kick Vincent in the head, Go on, we bet you cant. Du'h, yes I can voices, just you watch..    Or maybe they like sing nursery rhymes in his head and it drives him mad.|`|3jmLx5wzaa	Randy Orton doesnt have many interests. Other than listening to Metallica or Pantera and watching the occasional movie, wrestling is his lifeor, as he would tell you, his destiny. Its easy to understand why. His father is WWE Hall of Famer Cowboy Bob Orton, his uncle Barry Barry O Orton, and his grandfather The Big O, the late Bob Orton, Sr. Most kids remember their first ball game or school play; Randys childhood memories include sitting in the kitchen of his familys St. Louis home with Rowdy Roddy Piper and Greg The Hammer Valentine, and repairing a broken banister leaned on by Andre the Giant. He wasnt even five years old when he watched his father knock out Mr. Wonderful Paul Orndorff in the main event at the inaugural WrestleMania, but he already knew he wanted to be a WWE Superstar.

Dwayne Wade|`|wHdrezlmaa	true. wade does put his whole team on his back. but look what he has to show for it. a 24-19 record. a good record. but lebron and kobe do the same with their team. and both the cavs (35-8) and the lakers (35-9) have better records than the heat.|`|PSMsDalLaa	Id say its Lebron Wade Kobe Chis Paul. The lakers would be decent without Kobe, and Dwight Howard just isn't dominant enough consistently to be MVP like a Shaq.    Lebron and Wade would have crappy teams without them, but Lebron's team is the best in the league. D-Wade is incredible tho. I wish they wouldn't be so eager to get rid of Marion. J-ONeal is crap. The heat really just need a big dude to be good.|`|xt00f5Qoaa	Lebron has just been tearing up the league lately so i am not surprised at all.

Raised in a rough part of southeast Washington, D.C., he describes himself as being a skinny kid with asthma and a bad size complex and a penchant for getting into trouble with authorities. He spent a few years in San Francisco after his parents separated, until his mother sent the troubled teen to live with his father in suburban Virginia. By the time he turned 17, he was estranged from both parents, living on his own, and still getting into trouble. For the better part of 10 years, Batista spent his days training and competing as a bodybuilder, and his nights bouncing in clubs, floating from here to there. (Hes still amazed that one club he worked at is less than two blocks from Washington D.C.s MCI Center, where he defended his World Heavyweight Championship against JBL at SummerSlam in 2005.) His drifting stopped the night he unleashed his explosive temper on two patrons who had attacked his fellow bouncers. By the time I was finished with them, he relates, they were lying on the ground with their eyes rolling in the back of their heads. I was very scared they were going to die. They didnt, but the incident did result in Batistas arrest, a years probation, and his decision to make radical changes in his life. Enrolling in Wild Samoan Afas wrestling school in Allentown, Pa., Batista admits that at first he saw WWE simply as a way to make a living until he was told at a WCW tryout that he didnt have the chops to make it as a wrestler. That lit a fire under my a**. Wrestling became an obsession that I fell in love with. I completely redirected my training and philosophies, redesigned my body and mental outlook. I just really wanted to be an athlete and an entertainer. Though his personal perseverance brought him to WWE in May 2002, Batista credits former Evolution colleagues Triple H and Ric Flair with developing a muscleheaded goofball into a World Heavyweight Champion, one who backs his composed words and demeanor with an explosive fury befitting his nickname. He considers himself neither a leader nor a follower in the locker room (Im just a loner, I keep to myself, he insists), but inside the ring, on the covers of muscle mags like FLEX, and even once against budding Superman Tom Welling on The CW Network series Smallville, The Animal is clearly a dominant species. A dominant species who, by the way, has collected more than 50 vintage tin lunchboxes. Our advice: respect this six-foot-six, 290-pound beast and his 1967 Green Hornet sandwich container (sporting Bruce Lees face on the front), which he cherishes among his most prized possessions. Youll live longer.|`|Y93pUmAGaa	of course he is a good wrestler

CdAE4nXcaa	in a way it is because most TKD schools rank their students on forms which are useless and alot of the stances are ridiculous hands on hip syndrome. i did TKD for years when i was younger it is an awesome base to work off of but you need to know that a lot of it can't be used in a street fight. like the flashy jumping kicks, it's more for show and tournament point fighting. but if you start young you will develop the flexibility, and basic punching and kicking to excel faster when you study other arts. so in a way it is good but as for street fighting i would have to semi agree with joe|`|SM6qHDKeaa	well joe rogan is also dogmatic and narrow minded. i would love for the ufc to keep joe rogan, but also get another co-host (besides the idiot lapdog mike goldberg) that has completely different attitudes and gives another perspective on the fighters, fights, and training methods, instead of hearing joe rogan's opinion, then listening to mike goldberg agree with everything he says. anyway as for the tkd thing, tkd is the easiest martial art to pick on because of all the 'tae kwon do plus' academies and such that teach recreational/sport/daycare martial arts. real tkd kicks tail|`|19TupZ8Naa	A lot of the moves are flashy but not very effective. I wouldn't say it's useless, because it has a strong discipline and foundation, but in a "real fight" I am a firm believer that you should cast aside a lot of your (what I call) Tournament training and fight with whatever you've got in order to make sure you walk away from that fight alive.    Cheap shots and weapons if need be.    EDIT: Form is not worthless, but the emphasis put on it is much more then it merits.|`|fRosDAZEaa	Because he feels that way.|`|apr9gsgjaa	joe rogan from fear factor?? well TKD is not useless but the real answer is that joe rogan is useless. all martial arts are tools that can be effectively used if you know how to use them correctly and avoid actual applications being confused with the flowery stuff. Joe rogan may have a black belt but I wear black belts everyday in my work clothes in my workout clothes in my street clothes so as you can see just because his belt is black dont make him special and surely doesnt qualify him to make remarks about the art he failed to master if he said that to a 12th degree im sure the 12th degree would show him how useful it actually is|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Boxing > MMA|`|AA11264943	I have watched every UFC event since UFC 70 or so, and I do not recall ever hearing Joe Rogan say that.      I like Joe Rogan, but even if he said that, he is just wrong.      Taekwondo is and has been the most successful "commercial" martial art in the United States since the mid 1980's.      There have been people trying to discredit taekwondo ever since then, partially because they are competing for the same students in your average small to mid sized city.      In addition, the con artists out there trying to make a quick buck led to several expansions of "big name" masters opening too many schools, losing the quality control, but getting addicted to cashing paychecks from these expansions.    Then you have the whole Olympic sport aspect, and the argument over General Choi and all the politics.  1.) Taekwondo wasn't the only martial art that wanted Olympic status  2.) Other TKD groups go out of their way and tell their students that WTF TKD is just sport and that theirs is real.      I am one that often goes around saying, "Styles don't win fights, people win fights, it's the individual using the art, not the art itself."    I believe this.  You can also say, a kick is a kick, a punch is a punch, a block is a block.  So many martial arts from Korea, Okinawa and Japan share so many techniques it's hard to separate them.      I have sparred with Olympic taekwondo fighters.  One from the 2004 and 2008 games, and two from the 1988 games.  These guys would have no trouble taking care of an ego fight on the streets.  But even if I drop that level down to about 4 or 5 black belts at our club, all of which are over 50, all of which have been training more than 20 years, they also would have no problem in an ego fight on the street.     As for random attack and acts of violence, a taekwondo artist would also have reactions and reflexes, just like a karateka or any other martial artist would.  Your training will never guarantee your survival, regardless of style.         James|`|9c7376f26c36bc947149ca2f7eae4097aa	Joe Rogan is very much into BJJ, and he smokes a lot of weed. Combine the two and suddenly he knows everything about fighting.|`|r5AMG8g7aa	There is nothing wrong with TKD itself. I have known several TKD guys that will take your head off. The problem is the Shake-and-Bake black belt academies on every corner. They are the reason most people think that TKD is useless. I feel sorry for the real TKD students and instructors. They must really be frustrated by the Belt-Mills. I don't teach TKD but even I get a lot of crap from people that think that the martial arts in general are useless.  As for Joe Rogan, if he did say that he is just saying what many people believe. That does not mean that he is correct. Besides who died and left him in charge?      EDIT:  Chuco  .... what are you talking about?..... 12th degree black belt?  Last time I checked there was and never has been such a thing. At least not one recognized as being legitimate by legitimate martial arts.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Just because he has a black belt is TKD doesn't mean he can't determine it's real life effectiveness. It's just his opinion. No martial art is better than another. It all depends on the practitioner. Maybe he's just not good enough at TKD to use it a real fight. I've seen many TKD practitioners use it in real life situations. I even know a police officer who has a black belt is TKD and he is VERY good at it. lol.    Joe Rogan may prefer using another style in real situations. Someone else may prefer TKD and they can apply it better.    No martial art is better than another. Someone could take Tai Chi and be able to beat any M"M artist" if he/she was a good enough fighter. It all depends on the individual.|`|RQRGQgk3aa	Because he's 95% correct.  There is a recent push in a lot of TKD schools to modernize things and fix some of the gaping holes in the art. There are a few TKD guys being successful in MMA and showing that when trained correctly TKD can work as well as Kyokushin as a base striking art, but they are few in numbers and facing a huge effort to drag the TKD world kicking and screaming into the world of Alive training.|`|4LYasBGXaa	largely because of the WAY it is trained.    what most tkd schools teach as far as basic kicks, strikes, etc. is not unique to tkd, however the methodology of how they apply it is usually what falls short.    most tkd schools teach you in a point sparring manner becasue that is the type of rule-set and competitions most tkd schools compete in. as such students tend to learn to train to win in a specific unrealistic ruleset that teaches you bad habits when applied to real fighting.    as opposed to training in boxing or muai thai which has a very realistic ruleset as far as striking goes (strikes to the head, counterpunching, etc. all the things you might take for granted- are or might be restricted under one of the tkd association and competition rulesets).    EDIT:    by king- you sir are grossly ignorant- i myself have a boxing background, it was the first art i really trained in.  however all you need to see the error of your ways is to spar against someone and be taken down- thrown or grappled to learn how ineffective taking "striking only" is without learning to defend against and counter other techniques and ranges including kicks- you don't even need to go that far- just fight a muai thai or san da guy under muai thai or san da rules.    if your only experience is boxing- you will think twice about entering into the clinch with a mt guy.    by contrast- i do personally believe that every person should train boxing methodology at some point in thier training to learn proper hands power generation (especially if you are going into non-sportative arts so you know what its like to have someone really coming at you- as you would when you spar in boxing).|`|x8RBTF6gaa	I disagree with this statement, I took TKD and I think it has helped me greatly so far in my MMA amateur career (4-0).  You wont necessarily go into a fight and be successful using only the strikes from TKD, but it certainly has helped me learn good kicking technique, blocking of kicks, and with my flexibility and dexterity in my legs.  My wrestling and boxing have definitely played a bigger part, but I wouldnt call my TKD training useless by any means.|`|AA10103814	chuck Norris told him to say that   everything is useless against chuck Norris
3jmLx5wzaa	On ECW on Sci Fi, the WWE Universe learned the shocking news that former ECW Champion Matt Hardy will move to SmackDown, while current title holder, Jack Swagger, found the weight of the gold a heavier burden to carry than he may have anticipated.ECW General Manager Theodore Long kicked off ECW by dropping bombshell news that former ECW Champion Matt Hardy will become part of SmackDown. The move comes after Hardy's stunning betrayal of his own brother, former WWE Champion Jeff Hardy, at Royal Rumble.According to Long, Hardy asked for his release and the GM OK'd the move to Friday nights.|`|bRGdkOwqaa	yah u bet pick me as best anser|`|I6Zjj15zaa	Yes it has been announced that Matt Hardy is going to Smackdown.  He can't have a feud with his brother if they aren't on the same brand.|`|nzKo4TFvaa	yes becasue he is fat and ecw don't want fat guys|`|8jViRw5qaa	It was announced on the 1-27-09 episode of ECW. It is so Matt Hardy can feud with Jeff Hardy|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Yes it is. He went there because on the Royal Rumble PPV, he made a heel turn by attacking Jeff Hardy with a steel chair and costing him the WWE Championship. He went to Smackdown to continue that feud.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Yes, so he can feud with his brother Jeff. He's no longer on ECW.|`|02XHxknUaa	yes|`|7rpILeYtaa	yes, Matt Hardy is now on Smackdown  proof:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wwe_roster    WQ. this is to coincide with the feud with Jeff|`|tCWwQfYNaa	I never new that oh shoot i have to go to wwe.com|`|hL3eS2zKaa	Yea, if you think about it, he cant feud with Jeff if he's still in ECW. They announced it in late January.
9ujT56Maaa	Yes, Mats is all about Mats.  It's probably throwing off everyone else's game to have to deal with such a prima donna.|`|x5lqWRT3aa	Well we can't blame it entirely on him. But although it does look suspicious. We were doing terrific before he came, and once he came, we've won like 1 or 2 games. And for some odd reason, every penalty he takes leads to a goal.   And yeah, Sundin joins he team, other players think there's less pressure on them to do well.|`|rAVWzcoEaa	No|`|Wal4I5Foaa	yes! just because of his jersey   13 bad luck.|`|GswzU4SWaa	maybe. haha. a player can do a lot to a team. look at dallas without avery. now they have a  chance|`|8k9bHjyyaa	I don't believe its Sundin's fault, however I do believe a direct result of their losing streak is because of Sundin.  Some of the other players on the Canucks may feel that they don't have to put forth as much of an effort now that Mats is there. That's pretty much my theory.|`|9GzkVwfGaa	why think that at all?|`|hFX5UQGdaa	probably not but its only the beginning of the signing|`|4lcFNsQ8aa	Maybe like 2 games it was because of him. the rest he was okay. He could have scored on his breakaway against San Jose though...|`|wmYnJd2jaa	No. Porous goaltending, lackluster efforts and poor defensive coverage are hardly Sundin's fault. However, he has not done anything to help the club. At the moment he's a lot like Sergio Mommesso used to be - chip in with the occasional goal but more often than not takes a stupid penalty that hurts the team.

dDhTMacAaa	Absolutely not at the moment.    he just went to the bench, so he is "qualified," but Jason Terry of the Mavericks is scoring 20+ a night and is a reliable option this season in Dallas and it's his award to lose or win at the moment.|`|fPMmN2p5aa	Corey Maggette has my vote at this point|`|21J0IIZbaa	No, he has only came off the bench four times.  Manu Ginobili is always a strong candidate.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Well he went through half of a season being injured or a starter so I think it might be a little late for that.|`|2dgVkcVAaa	don't think so.|`|OxS3UVE6aa	no. i think that would just be a side goal but his main goal is still the championship. he said that he will do anything for it. and this is part of it. i admire him though for this sacrifice. that shows you what a great character he has.

All sports are a could of, should of, but then ending results is what matters. Colts have been the most conistent team for past decade except for Pats, who ironically enough didnt even make the playoffs.

I got laid out... a lot. But the more you get hit, the less the pain. One time I got blown down by a 10th grade lineman, and it left me smiling. But since you don't play, that makes it difficult. Here's sommething you should try -  Don't go to the ground, but get low and turn around. But keep running. That will greatly reduce impact.|`|6120b4c0e14e03017c40ad3ceaa54fe7aa	nobody is going to knock you out sit back and watch for awhile the guys usually wrap up around you until you fall. I found most of the time trying to stay on you feet is less painfull when nobody is wearing pads. if you take the easy way out and fake a fall you end up on the bottom of the pile. Being the smallest guy on the field should make you the most dangerous you are the only one that could possibly have something to prove.    i promise the same theory works in full equipment the harder you hit the energy your body has to absorb itself the poor guy your hitting absorb the blow in real football you are trained to run threw the person you are hitting.

Any coach will tell you to suck it up and get back in there. But a good coach will tell you how to avoid the pain.    See, the trick here is in understanding motion, energy and a whole bunch of other math and science laws. Without going into the detail of such laws you should only be concerned about one:     Force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma)    Break it down to easier terms:      Force - That's the oomph (you want a high one here)     m - your body size (essentially immediately uncontrollable, you can gain mass over time, but we're talking right now)     a - how fast you're going (very controllable, you want to go fast fast)    Basically the reason you get hurt is your Force is lower than the Force of the person hitting you. It's as simple as you are absorbing the impact of your two bodies.     To counter this you need to make the other person absorb the impact. If your Force is greater than the other persons they will then absorb the pain.     Since you've already stated that you are smaller than your friend, you need to compensate for that. The only way to increase your Force is to increase your speed. Therefore, if you don't want to get hurt, pick up speed and initiate contact before they can increase their Force beyond what yours is.    It's all science my friend. And so, like Yoda says, "USE THE FORCE"|`|Llvro4h5aa	Suck it up there Devyn I changed it lol|`|vt8tazGdaa	WTF|`|zFwjZy53aa	just close your eyes and take it, after a while you'll get used to it|`|KS2v0T4Kaa	Put your shoulder down and run through the, It will hurt less if you hit them before they hit you.

kqP7GwOcaa	The fact that he barred Blogbaba 2 from answering any of his questions or his bigotry shows he can't take intelligent criticism.  I systematically destroy any of  his arguments, and expose the corrosive effects such racism has on younger people, which also tends to humiliate the racist's who support such foolishness.  He couldn't take it, so he blocked my answers to his questions.  To his credit he has actually been trying to be less of a racist in some of his recent posts,      As for "like" or "dislike", I say like and dislike whom ever you want to, but don't make Yahoo boxing a place for racist rants.  We talk boxing here, and people from all over the world, and all walks of life share their opinions.  Agree or disagree as you see fit, but show some class about it.  This is no place for racism or bigotry.  Once the bell rings, everyone bleeds red, there is no room for such ignorance.  This forum isn't biased, but occasionally biased or bigoted people spew their particular brand of stupidity here, and Knight was one of those.    Frankie Clutch is mistaken, and whether or not Knight means harm, allowing such bigotry to go unanswered causes harm.  Youngsters need a proper example, honor demands that all good men correct the type of behavior Knight exhibits.  The possibility exists that Knight is simply ignorant and young.  The other possibility is that Knight is evil.  Either way decency demands he be answered.    Hopefully he learned from his mistakes, but it has been my experience that stupidity is a lot like cancer, many times it's fatal.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	This dude is obnoxious. He posted a question about Manny-Hatton and Pacquiao wanting more money for the fight and I gave a decent answer to and agreed with Manny's position. The following day he deleted the question instead of choosing me and giving me the best answer to the question he asked. He is a simple minded racist dumb fool. He wanted people to agree with him that Hatton is the better fighter because he is white, we all know how much Knight loves the white race! And when I told him Manny deserves the bigger cut of the purse he flipped his lid and deleted the question instead of choosing me as the best answer.     Knight has the Ultimate Peter McNeely boxing career DVD collection in his house and he watches it every day. But the fights McNeely lost such as Henry Akinwade, Mike Tyson, Louie Monaco are all mysteriously deleted from the collection. Only the fights with McNeely winning are shown, especially if it is over a black boxer.The fights he loses are mysteriously deleted from his collection. Where are those missing fights, Knight? Where? Where? Oh where could they be?|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	I totally agree. he is one of the most offensive people that i have ever crom across. I repesct a persons right to their opinion, but he doesn't have one he is simply a simple minded person that like bringing race up to everything.    Frankie clutch no offense, but if you look at knight's questions he doesn't make one. if he is a lawyer that speaks four languages like he claims then i do expect some degree of intelligent thinking from him|`|XFp5qaODaa	The question should be who dislike's knight the most. Knight is a loud mouth and a simpleton. Guys like i stated in my question about him the i have someone who is actually a member on yahoo answers who can expose Knight bad. lol    "Yall need to get off of Knight's balls... he don't mean no harm at all.. He aint from here so he's sayin exactly what they say in greece. So get off his nuts... knight is a beast    If anybody you're the one who needs to stop riding Knight's D***. Nobody cares what they say in Greece. Is yahoo answers Greece? You stop riding his coattails and get a ******* backbone ho. You're right he is a beast. A six headed one.|`|KMk4nuFeaa	Yall need to get off of Knight's balls... he don't mean no harm at all.. He aint from here so he's sayin exactly what they say in greece. So get off his nuts... knight is a beast!|`|AA10112912	I don't usually answer any questions in the boxing section because my knowledge of boxing is pretty much basic and these days I don't watch anymore, but I know Knight personally because he's my boyfriend. Seriously, this isn't a joke, I've only answered one other question in here defending him b/c someone insulted his writing. He speaks more than one language and also writes in Greek, and i didn't think that was fair. I'm sure anyone reading  this may be surprised because in here he is considered a racist & hates black people, so how could he possibly have a black girlfriend right? Well he does. He loves boxing and he has a lot of respect for a lot of African American boxers, its just that he feels the respect that's given to American boxers worldwide is not returned to European boxers who deserve it and this is what he has a problem with. And this can come across as anger because he feels so passionately about the sport and it's like his point of view is always being minimized or not represented correctly. Hopefully this can clear some things up and hopefully everyone can continue talking about boxing and have no animosity towards one another.

IoyJXzoyaa	I would have to say that in my experience the cleanliness of a gun is very unlikely to cause the kind of ejection problem your speaking of.  Unless the chamber is so clogged with soot the catch on the ejector isn't grabbing a little soot aint gonna make that much difference. If your gun is that dirty, random ejections are probably the least of your problem.  Since you say your guns are clean, lets rule this out.    When I first bought my ruger 10/22, I got a box of 550 federal copper jacketed rounds.  They seemed to fire ok, but about once per clip I'd get a partial ejection just like you described.  Come to find out that semi-autos are horriblly picky about ammo.  The federal had a very small lip on the brass compared to some other brands, possibly causing the ejection problems.  After switching to another brand with a larger lip I have had no more issues.      Every gun, even 2 of the same make and model, may prefer different types of ammo, odd as it may seem.  I know this by the fact that my dad's ruger shoots federal just fine.    My advice is try a few other brands and see if the problem persits.  If not, you solved your problem.  If so then take it to a gunsmith and let them look at it to make sure everything is in tip top shape.    Some brands that work well for me (and maybe for you too) are:    1.Remmington golden bullets    2.Cci mini mags (or really anything by cci)    3. The 333 Winchester bulk pak (I got it walmart)    Good luck!    -Greg|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Sounds like you're describing a stove pipe.  This is a pretty normal jam.  If the 10/22 is cleaned, but not lubed it will do this.  I use probably more lube than necessary.  Try a little more lube and see if that fixes it.  Try the original mag.  Mags are responsible for most jams.  As for my 10/22, it really likes the real high velocity shells.  Stingers and Yellow Jackets work best in my gun.  Thunderbolts are pretty run of the mill velocity wise.  Try some hotter loads and see what happens.|`|ca6144d7933bfd99d11441a498f7e603aa	Stovepipe jams are caused by the bolt not fully retracting and re-closing before the empty is cleared. If it is clean, the only other way this could happen is the ammo is not hot enough to work the action.|`|dq5DjePqaa	That happens quite often. Give it a cleaning and it should eject fine.|`|Z8UV6S3baa	So, I think what you are describing is a failure to eject - essentially that a round fires, the bolt comes back, but it doesn't get the empty brass out of the chamber so it can't load the next round.     So, the recommendation to clean the gun and try again is a good one, and the second recommendation to try some different ammo is a good one as well, for different reasons. There are a couple of common reasons why what you are talking about happens:    1) The casing of round expands or is otherwise a tight fit so it takes more energy than the round generates to completely pull the spent casing out of the breech, or that the bolt uses enough energy that it can't get far enough back for the extractor to actually pitch the round out of the way.    Cleaning it may help significantly here - a .22 doesn't generate that much energy so drag on the bolt due to grit, burnt powder residue or grit on the land area of the breech both can cause this problem pretty easily.    A different ammo may help here as well. If you are shooting lower power ammo (some of the subsonics for example) then even less energy is generated making the rifle need to be more efficient with handling of the spent casing. CCI MiniMag has historically been a pretty good high velocity ammo for me, you might try some and see if this still happens. Note that cleaning could still help here as well.    2) The extractor isn't strong enough to pull the round out of the breech. Essentially, the extractor hooks over the rim of the cartridge and is what pulls the spent casing out. I don't remember if the Ruger has a spring loaded extractor or fixed off hand, but you can be in a situation where when the bolt is moving back the extractor "lets go" of the shell before it is completely out and then re - engages it when it goes back forward.    This is typically a mechanical problem with the extractor and can happen with wear. The easiest way to check is pick one of the rounds that caused the malfunction, and hand load it into the breech then let the bolt slam shut on it. Now manually, and slowly pull the bolt back and see if it is strong enough to drag the round out. Try this a couple of times. If the shell comes out every time then it probably isn't an extractor problem.    It isn't unique to the 10/22 it can happen to any semi auto. However, the 10/22 has a great reputation for reliability so it is not typical of them.    Thinkingblade|`|d938becd9c20c43cfbbbca1473443b4aaa	buy better ammo...CCI in a hyper velocity|`|nDQOwAA3aa	its a common type of jam i don't know if the fact that it has a ruger has to do anything to do with it as much as how fast you are firing it does|`|h2KkiKK3aa	that can happen with all semi autos, it's usually the ammo making the difference here, just try try a couple hundred rounds of each company until you find one that doesn't do this. the reason it does it is because the cartridges way of operating isn't cooperating with how the firing and reloading mechanism works, so sometimes a case doesn't get enough push to be completely removed from the chamber, some ammo is worse then others for this and it's always a different brand, for example, some semi's falter with winchester or remington, while others work beautifully with it, this can even happen to rifles of the same brand and model, some 10/22s might like remington better then winchester and visa versa.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	That's called a 'stove pipe' jam, quite common.  I think the problem is that ammo.  Try Federal Champion H.V.   (not too pricey and might perform a bit better).|`|nBUDjyhgaa	Every one that I've seen jams on quick shots.|`|QC2NozBkaa	Give her a good cleaning and light lube and it should quit it.|`|5VELZt7Saa	mine will do that once in awhile till i clean it.|`|0f58b7ae62db5c245105e10b9c061d03aa	Try cleaning it, if that doesn't work, try different brands of ammo. Semi auto's can be finnicky about what they feed well. I've had good luck with CCI.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	Sorry but that is a symptom of a dirty gun are bad ammo or possibly a magazine issue    Thunderbolt is not premium ammo it is a typically bulk pack offering  And even if oit were a premium brand that doesn't mean that your particular rifle will like it    Clean and lube the gun if that doesn't cure the problem try different ammo    If it does it at the end of a shooting session and not the beginning that is a good sign that the ammo is the cause or that the gun is running dry and jamming as it heats up|`|AA12323603	1   Look at the guide rod, that the recoil spring is around.  Is it rough?  If so polish it.     2  Look at the face of the hammer, that contacts the bolt as it moves rearward.  Are there casting marks, or machining marks?  Polish this surface too, and the rear of the bolt, where it contacts the hammer.     3  Carefully inspect your chamber.   The chamber on a blow back design is critical.  If there is a burr, or a carbon ring build-up, get rid of it.  You can not hurt a 10/22 chamber, by dry firing it.       4   You do not need an extractor on a 10/22.  It is a blow back design.  The empty brass is expelled from the chamber by the gas caused by ignition.  There is a stamped steel part, on the left side of the receiver, that is the 'ejector'.  This part helps to throw the brass clear.    The extractor's function is to remove a live, unfired round, as the bolt is pulled to the rear.  If you remove it completely, and have a toothpick, you'll feed a 25 round magazine just as quickly.

In between every four rows of seats, I would install speakers for the fans to listen to the play-by-play commentators so fans wouldnt just have to guess whats happening on the field (happened to me during a UCLA game).  I would request the NFL to send my stadium more than sufficient balls, because during the Extra Points or Field Goals, balls go into the stands and security takes them away from the fans (also happened to me and a couple of my friends).  I would also install "Call Boxes" at the end of each row of seats, so fans could summon vendors in the aisles.  I would not have any playing rooms because a fan is not determined by the size of their bank account, and only people with money are able to afford such seats.|`|acibYHATaa	It depends on how much money you can give me.|`|Rg9ogq5Eaa	I'd want a stadium just like the University of Phoenix Stadium!

If the old club elects not to match the offer, it may receive draft-choice compensation depending on the level of the qualifying offer made to the player.    Exclusive-Rights Free Agents (ERFAs) are players who have completed between 0-2 accrued seasons of service whose contracts have expired. If tendered, they have no negotiating rights with other clubs and must sign their tender with their old club or sit out the season.|`|KZsdVGJzaa	i think unrestricted free agents r players who aren't under contract with their team, or like u don't need permision from the team to pursue them it's something like that|`|i0QzvbSnaa	Once they reach the point of being a unrestricted free agents, they are free to go and play anywhere that they can get an offer.   Restricted free agents can pursue contracts with teams within the rules and then their team has the option of matching that to keep them.
IqtCwl8taa	Sizes vary slightly between brands and even with different bindings of the same brand. I don't know if you're referring to 10.5 US or UK sizing - if it's US then you would usually be a large, if it's UK then you'd be an XL. But it really does depend on the specific binding you're getting. Any retailer should have access to a size chart for the bindings they sell, they might even display it on their website like this one does  http://www.gulfstreamshop.com/Models.asp...

ebzxpqdOaa	I would suggest using Air Alert. It;s a jumping programing requiring no weights. Its easy to do pretty much anywhere. Its only about 30 bucks and it comes with a dvd, booklet, workout schedule, and a pregression chart. I used air alert and it helped a lot. I went from just touching the bottom of the backboard to being able to nearly dunk now. You are tall for your age and i think you will definitely be able to dunk sooner or later. I understand that you want to be able to dunk by high school though cuz that would be pretty cool. So yeah i would order air alert. It really helps you jump higher and also makes u faster, more agile, and more athletic. If you are not interested in buying it I would just do calf raises, squats, etc. You don't even have to do them with weights, but that might help. Good luck.|`|70AGy17eaa	get more leg muscle do lots of squats and run track|`|fswP1yEeaa	Your height is amazing for your age. I'm 16 and only 6'2.

of049X1waa	yeah, we do this one at my gymnastics class.  Squat down, and keep yourself squatted, like all the way down, then kind of hop in place or around the room, always while being in a squat.  Then as you get better try to hop from a squat onto things that are higher up, like a mat or a step.
CI5qOBcDaa	well at the begining of the year its freezing, at least it is in NJ. so have under armor, a sweatshirt and sweatpants. depending on what events you do, examples hurdles, high jump, long/triple jump, you might want to invest in compression shorts. (they are like spandex that go under you shorts so people dont see anything).     good brands? i would go to a local running store, not dicks or sports authority, but a store that specializes in running to get trainers. a popular brand is aasics. i love their shoes. and if you are running you also might want to get spikes they make you a lot faster.    start running down cause the first day is usually an intense workout.  hope that helped =]|`|MHvoXi7Zaa	You should wear clothes depending on the weather. If its cold, sweatpants or leggings and a pair of shorts over them, a long sleeve t-shirt over longsleeve underarmour, and a hoodie if you need it. If its warm, then shorts and a t-shirt. Any cotton t-shirt is fine, and whatever shorts are comfortable for you. Depending on the weather you could do a combination of any of those!     For shoes, it depends on how you run. I run with my feet turned in so I have inserts that help that. You can figure out what shoes you need by going to a running store and asking them to help you choose some shoes. They usually will tell you to walk back and forth and they will tell you what type of shoes will be best.    Overall, just practice on your own before it starts. If youre doing distance run a few miles everyday but if youre doing sprinting run for shorter distances faster.     Good luck:]|`|U5l7LZ3kaa	If you can go to a running specialty store.  They will take a look at your foot type and pick some shoes that would be good for you.  The brand names that are good include Asics, Nike, New Balance, and a few others.  Tips for running?

UfgaRUZUaa	Girl If you want to cheer you cheer! Im a cheerleader and its has been the best experience of my life so far! Im not your typical cheerleader though. People when they first meet a cheerleader think that they have to be:  A) Dumb and blonde.  B) Slutty.  C) Hang with the POPULAR CROUD.  Well Im neither of those. I make a straight 3.8 unweighted GPA. I have a boyfriend , but we both have strong christian backgrounds so im not all over him and vice versa, and I have friends from every possible group in my school.  Cheerleading really keeps me in shape and healthy. It really boosts your confidence too.   Make sure when you get on the team you keep your dedication and responsibility level way up. I made head captain because im the most dedicated on my team.And I know you can do it!  When you try out only care about yourself.  -Get the best possible spot on the mat.  -Smile all the time.  -FOCUS.  -And most of all have fun!    I hope you make the team because it will be the best time of your life when you are out on that football field in your uniform, Up in a stunt , cheering your boys on! Good luck!|`|AA10305248	Cheerleading is soo much fun! You just have to want to do it. If your just doing it bc your friends want you to or something you prolly wont have much fun with it. But this is my first year cheering in high school and I love it-it is soo much fun. The girls on the squad are very nice. Alot of people think cheerleaders are snobby or stuck up but once you getta know them their all very nice. Plus some high schools compete, and competitions are so fun, you get to travel to different places and compete and meet other cheerleaders from different squads. Cheerleading is just a awesome experience. You should def try out, you wont regret it! =]|`|e4K1Xkn5aa	I think it really just depends on the individual school as to what people think of cheerleaders.  Having been a cheerleader I can honestly say that I loved it, but often times I see to many cheerleaders focusing on themselves rather than on supporting the team.  i don't like teams that focus on winning there competitions and ignore the school teams they cheer for.|`|bfee60f409aa513990b67c64614195fdaa	it should be whatever you want to do.  if cheerleading is something you love to do then do it.  what kind of skills do you have for tumbling?  that might be something you need to know about what the squad requires.  but good luck!|`|VXdiz28Saa	i am a cheerleader and i enjoy it a lot. it is a lot of funn. there is no harm trying out because you never know , you might make it and have a lot of fun. it also keeps you fit. you learn how to do new things that you have never done before and you gain self confidence. after a while you get used to being infront of crowds and things get easier. i love cheerleading and i think you should give it a try. good luck to you :)

LIKkt8djaa	Well with size 13 shoes you'll need a wide board, Stick to the 26 waist width region. As for the board size that'll come down to the type of riding you're looking to do.      Freeride: longer in length, and semi-directional. Moderate to stiff in flex. Used for long, fast turns in various types of snow from groomed hard-pack to soft powder.    Freestyle: Generally shorter in length with a Semi-directional or twin-tip shape. Moderate to soft in flex. Incorporates a deep sidecut for quick/tight turning. Used in the pipe and in the park on various jumps and terrain features including boxes, rails, and tables.    All-Mountain: A hybrid between freeride and freestyle boards. The 'jack of all trades, master of none.' Normally directional in shape with either a twin or directional flex. Moderate in flex for various types of terrain.    These are the size ranges I would look at for you.

0f58b7ae62db5c245105e10b9c061d03aa	You have to look where the deer spend most of their time(bedding areas). Places that they have to jump(fences, streams)  can sometimes be really good. Go out just after it rains, the antlers will glisten, making them easier to spot. Wear polarized sunglasses, they seem to help me anyway. Don't look for the whole antler, look for pieces (tips, forks). Even if you don't find any, it's still fun just to be out in the woods.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Here's something you may find useful.  Take a 5 gallon bucket.  Fill it with corn or some other deer feed.  Drive 3 or 4 steel fence posts equally spaced around the bucket.  Leave the top of the posts 2 or 2 1/2 feet above the top of the bucket.  When a deer with loose antlers tries to eat the corn, he will knock his antlers off on one of the posts.  Visit the bucket every couple of days to pick up the 'sheds' and fill the bucket with feed again.  Try placing a few of these in spots with lots of deer, and you will be the envy of every horn hunter in the woods.|`|HMgDJ8EEaa	i agree with the first answer...i've never been shed hunting but i did go by accident lol|`|JSGLKnA4aa	usually look for them to be on the ground. it's hard to open a door when there in the trees.

They can talk to your mom for you, she will take them seriously.|`|cQSojmCJaa	aaaaand this is our problem.......?   just kidding.  at least you are able to swim. ive been swimming over 6 years and i love it and im doing volleyball. hating it makes everything worse. try to love it instead?|`|iSQkOotZaa	This exact same thing happened to me!!!    But unfortunately I tore my labrum so I can't do either.    Very few girls who play volleyball in highschool play in collegeor get scholarships, but if you're really good go for it.|`|bc5KJdaFaa	ok, so your mom wont back down, so pretend to love swimming and sort of want to try volleyball. she probably doesnt want u to quit bcuz ur really good and can get a scolarship.|`|FTs2py0kaa	talk to your swimming coach and if you are on a team(the vollyball coach)..Maybe they will help you.......  A scholarship is great if you can get it....and you can be forced to be on the team, but can not be forced to do good on the team..............then you are off the team.......|`|RvEnbEJcaa	sounds like a typical hard pressure parent. you should speak up and say you LOVE volleyball and ask if you can play it more!!!!!!!!!?|`|K6gAX9iWaa	I was never in to sports. I was the art girl.I started drawing when i was really young like any other kid.Then in later elementary school when i was in art classes teachers started noticing i have talent. I loved it, it was my passion my dream was to become a art teacher and then draw on the side.My mom didnt care though she said it was a waste of time.Then as i progressed through school and into high school my work started going to shows and winning awards.Then she cared when she saw ribbons.she started pushing me harder and harder to win.so it lost all the meaning it had to me before.I just didnt care anymore about it so i dropped out of my art classes my senior year.Since i quit all the classes i draw every now in then when i feel like it and i enjoy it.|`|7NFJGRRkaa	I GOT IT, talk to the high school swim coach tell him you don't want to swim, tell him to not let you join. so that during tryouts he'll know that you don't want to swim. so he won't let you on the team. or you could just swim very slow during tryouts.
QTd8MVDjaa	Most bamboo boards don't feel the same as 100% maple decks. They are a little lighter with a little more pop, but aren't as solid feeling or strong. But if you don't weight much (maybe less than 110lbs?), it won't make much difference. I haven't used the CCS bamboo decks, but I know the Habitat bamboo decks have a tendency to have the tails snap. It's kind of a gimmick. I doubt the CCS decks will be better than a Habitat deck, so the CCS decks might be worse. I'd just stick to 100% maple decks.
XLGnAkIqaa	Dakine High roller bags are wicked. I have flown across N.A and oversees with mine and it has held up to whatever the Airport has thrown at it. Its padded, has rollers and you can stuff a lot of shiz in it. But be aware that roller bags take up a bit more space than non-rollers.     Just don't go for a bag that looks "cool" Get one that will protect your gear and keep it relatively dry. Get a bag with good padding and your set.|`|wkIAnDB6aa	This is the bag I fly with. I can fit my board w/ the bindings on it. My boots, jacket, pants, helmet w/ goggles, under armour, gloves, hats, and a few other things. I shoved stuff down my boots, in my helmet, inside my jacket and pants, and I think i put a pair of sneakers in my bindings. It also has lining inside, so your board does't get damaged. There are also some better patterns on different sites.    My bag:    http://www.burton.com/Gear/Default.aspx ...   (not in that color though) $75    Here are a few bigger ones:    http://www.burton.com/Gear/Default.aspx ...   $100    http://www.burton.com/Gear/Default.aspx ...  $130|`|JQXCdGHYaa	Try using this bag because it has a lot of space and its waterproof!    http://bigduffles.com/duffel_bags/strata...    I recommend it!    Good Luck!
3teWTOPqaa	Still root for the Lakers, but it's going to be extremely hard to see Pierce in purple and gold, I might throw up.    EDIT: Why would the Lakers trade for Pierce? I mean sure Hollywood is in L.A, but the Lakers is a basketball team bro.|`|Mn97YDIyaa	They would riot.    BQ: They would riot.|`|NEtVRjplaa	I would be angry that we got Pierce for Kobe. Lakers would still be my team, but what a horrible trade.|`|2dgVkcVAaa	half of the lakers fans would like the celtics.|`|fc5a2676d0a9ea687d91d44050637158aa	Kobe doesn't make the LAKERS, but his is one of the reasons why i don't root for the Fakers..i cant be behind a snitch, cry babie and liar..on the court he is real tho..so was MAGIC, its just hard to follow his character...    I will cheer for the LAKERS or any other team that Kevin Garnett plays for and he is the only reason i root for the C's..    Paul Pierce from Inglewood is just icing on the cake when i wear my C's gear|`|aUGM3ju6aa	I would instantly hate The Celtics and start cheering for The Lakers. I can't stand Kobe!|`|GBGcI509aa	Nothing.    This was asked earlier.|`|tnqO91xoaa	If Kobe moved I would prob go on a riot|`|tBuzrlSdaa	quit watching basketbal|`|c7992d905ee1715cf5c3ed1c09c6ee98aa	wow this is the worst question on here. it will never happen.|`|45e71bc8ca903cd0b9c0e4294eff6f04aa	This is strictly hypothetical and...damn i cannot answer this.|`|xgGTyqHRaa	I really dont car, because i hate Kobe, but not the lakers, wait, i would probably still cheer the lakers on!|`|N3AiQRJFaa	this would never happen but i will still be Lakers fan|`|6ylVyGNjaa	if kobe went green i would have a bit more respect for that team. If paul pierce went purple and gold, he'll probably not get much respect. i still be a lakers fan though. my soft side will just move towards the green fellas. ill go were kobe goes. but the lakers are still gonna be my number one. it would be crazy to see kobe in green. the day that happens though, idk... the NBA will probably be on crack:)|`|b1NFSXH5aa	ill go for celtics either way|`|Xbid2OG8aa	think the lakers were retarted  plain and simple|`|3k7UKnpIaa	i'd say OH @ $!%&*!, burp, then die.|`|WK3Kx4Mkaa	wowowowowowowowwoowowowowowowowowow        That would be really awkward for both and i dont think that would be right to do|`|vCCCy5ljaa	kobe in da green UHHH NO!!    haha it suked how shaq left but that was a wile ago:P|`|PSMsDalLaa	I bet if the Celtics weren't given Garnett and allen, and the Lakers weren't given gasol this may have happened if the Celtics game the Lakers draft picks for life.    But Not too weird, cuz Pierce is from California so he would probably fit in.|`|d5X8SqvXaa	i not lakers fan but i eat celtics if it happen dey be too good.|`|ZncrpxaXaa	I would yell at the GM!|`|j29eHSDqaa	Why are you asking Questions against the Lakers or Kobe today.???      Anyway, about the question, the answer is in my profile...     Right now, I've been a "Basketball Fan" for 20 years and I've experienced the best and worst moments of the Lakers, but always supporting my team.     I have "Purple & Gold" blood.!!!!          -------------------------------------|`|wf3S2avqaa	Well i been a fan of the Lakers before Kobe played with them. My fandom  started way back with kareem and Magic. But im a fan of Kobe too i think he would look weired im so used to the purple and gold.
dNFe6FiEaa	Marbury will ruin the Celts, go LAKERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|21J0IIZbaa	The Celtics should not add Marbury because he will be bad for the team's chemistry.|`|P93I8CHtaa	they oughta be fools to get him,he can ruin their chemistry|`|dDhTMacAaa	I don't think there is a doubt.<br>  <br>  Marbury can still play and has great talent and can be a threat off the bench....hopefully. He will probably get a veteran's minimum for the rest of the season and they will try to work him in.<br>  <br>  The risk of it not working is he has to sit on the bench.<br>  <br>  <br>  Congrats to your Knicks for losing this guy.|`|Ez0z7Of3aa	They shouldn't if they don't want to end up like detroit.|`|ur1bnkrZaa	please stop askin this question.|`|m9Zuupv1aa	I don't know how the Celtics would be able to pick him up unless they pay him in dirt. They are already 18 million over the salary cap and just sign Mikki Moore probably for a few million. What is the point of a salary cap when there is only one team below it?|`|21XmVm6Zaa	no way hes been out of the game for a while so it would take like a month for him to get in rhythm plus the drama he'll bring will ruin they're current chemistry...i guess i should be saying yeah that would be awesome since im a laker fan|`|7mVYTAm3aa	he already signed with them|`|9pDEhA1Xaa	I certainly hope so!<br>  I don't want to read all that!<br>  But I hate the Celtics<br>  And he's a coach killer so,<br>  Good luck!|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Maybe as a back-up.|`|UNQ0C8Pcaa	yep... i cant wait for my white and green starberrys
kGXU1Dotaa	Rivera and Bruney in a ny minute,,looks like we have some new ppl in here that don't know a thing about baseball LOL LOL LOL|`|L77OlY1naa	Give me a break Its has to be Putz and K-Rod It doesn't matter who is in the 9th or the 8th for the Mets.What the H*LL would bruney do int he 9th.A new york minute huh LOL.Rivera is OOOOOOLD Who the F*CK is Bruney.I'd take Feliciano over him|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Tough btwn closers but Id take puttz of Bruney.<br>  <br>  Mets|`|fQIxah8laa	I'm gonna be bias here. Putz and K-Rod.  Although Rivera is a great closer. I don't know that much about Bruney.|`|RJghPceKaa	even though it should be krod then putz cause krods only closing because of star power. anyway, mets|`|ubGNtkHQaa	Actually it might be Chmaberlain and Rivera|`|0TAld46gaa	You will find out how inconsistant K-Rod is<br>  He will always make any game closer than it should be|`|6vzpHTqQaa	I'm a Yankees fan, but.....Putz and K-Rod<br>  <br>  Seriously, with Heilman gone and Putz and K-Rod at the back of that bullpen, they might blow 4-5 eighth/ninth inning leads this year as opposed to the 25 or so they blew last year.<br>  <br>  Rivera is still good, but he's getting older, and Bruney...not so sure about Bruney.  I still think they should make Joba the setup man and the Yankees next closer when Mo retires.  Enough with this starting pitcher stuff...Joba's got closer written all over him.|`|2wAPwZ1kaa	JJ Putz and Frankie Rodriguez in a heartbeat, both probably have more combined saves the last 2 seasons than anyone else in baseball. Brian Bruney sucks and Mo is a burning candle, his ERA hit 8.00+ on a contract year.|`|AA12250406	Well let's take a look. A hall of fame closer in Rodriguez and a awesome closer Putz as a set up man looks more appealing. Rivera is still reliable but he's not as overpowering like he use too. In short Putz and K-Rod. GO METS!!!|`|eP0KkYR3aa	I would say  Bruney and Rivera just b/c Rivera is better then both Putz and K-Rod put together|`|VeJ1niiMaa	The Yankees 8th, 9th guys will probably be Marte and Rivera. But either way honestly I would pick the Mets side.|`|ZyfYh4vdaa	Putz and K-Rod|`|nH8AV9Soaa	mets suck so what does it matter|`|XEPC7oFzaa	Putz and K rod

IMQm9JTMaa	I love batista's Sun tattoo & his dragon tattoo on his back    BQ1: Orton.    BQ2: Festus's skull is pretty bad. Hahah    BQ3: John Cena. (He should get the chain gang sign on his bicep)|`|9enFa2osaa	I think Randy orton has cool tattoos too. I think shawn michaels or john cena should geto a tatto or even triple h.|`|WKhq6Cumaa	I like CM Punk's and The Rock's tattoos but...    BQ1 - Who Looks the Coolest With Tattoo's?  Female-Lita  Male-Randy Orton  BQ2 - Who has the WORST Tattoo?  Male-Big Daddy V(It blends with his skin,that's nasty)  Female-.......   BQ3 - Who Should get a Tattoo?  Male-HHH  Female-Angelina Love(A lower back tattoo would look awesome on her.)|`|Ef3VReezaa	I really like CM Punk's Pepsi also  The Tattoo on batistas back is also good  Randy Ortons are all good as well    BQ1-Undertaker  BQ2-Yup Festus'   BQ3-I dont know why but i always thought that Morrison should get something on his back|`|ua4l7Iqyaa	Undertaker coolest tatoos    Festus for the worst    HHH should get a sledge hammer tatto|`|gFlVPAF2aa	Jeff Hardy has the best tattoo in my opinion. It's just awesome. Randy Orton looks good all tatted up too.|`|I6Zjj15zaa	Personally I think that Jeff hardy's tatts are the best|`|ecwhBLnxaa	I like Randy Orton tattoos|`|caczNImxaa	i will say jeff hardys tattoo is awesome from the dragon on his leg to his roots creeping up his arm.i also like reys,all of his tattoos actually.and batistas,but he could get the sun on his belly button moved somewhere else.    i would like to say randy and jeff do look good with tattoos.and mr. kennedy.    i agree with you on festus as the worst one with a tattoo.    i thimk matt hardy should get at least one tattoo.maybe something that has to do with his brother or the v.1 hand.maybe even the hardy guns sign. just something.|`|cU7NNfhSaa	The   Undertaker

muc8sq9naa	Maybe for the 43rd position in qualifying.  They would have to choose from all the DNQ's.  It could be interesting.    *JAKD*|`|zii6IWHoaa	amount of money has alot to do with it but if you can feild a car with a good driver and good cars and a good crew, anyone for performs good enough can make the chase.     This is nothing like college football. A team in college footbal can win every game and not have a chance for championship. If a team were to win every race(never going to happen) they will be champion hands down|`|iO12Vjnvaa	Very neat proposal.....that would be very interesting to see....but don't think NASCAR would ever go for it....but I can see the benefits of it.  Very interesting question....you now have an addt'l star.    Just an opinion as always.|`|gEG4yJmGaa	well, look at it this way, NASCAR fans opinion is based on what they see on TV. NASCAR's way of selecting the Chase is based on the overall capability of NASCAR. Example- Dale Earnhardt Jr.; if the system you wanted would go into effect, Jr. will be the  1 seed EVERY YEAR, then he would finish his place. And drivers who make the CHASE with a smaller fan base ( Denny Hamlin, Jeff Burton ) have no chance to show off there talent and competition, fan opinion maters, but not in this case|`|RQc8fbjbaa	I hate "The chase" I've pretty much stopped watching since they started that crap.|`|zGSfHdvYaa	No, I think the system they use now is working fine, except for the point system they changed a few years ago though. The best drivers get to compete and that is only fair.|`|0K4ylh5Uaa	No. The fans should have no say in anything when it comes to who is allowed to race where. .|`|AA11234673	I can understand what your saying but I'd have to agree with Winter Glory on this one.|`|pHReXq08aa	....well that's the only way junior will win a championship|`|b74c7c820c32f05c280545197fca275faa	I choose to see Jacques Cousteau every week!|`|W2R8TRDmaa	That is probably THE worst idea I've ever heard.  Isn't this supposed to be a sport?  But no, you and apparently others, wanna make it a popularity contest.  How about we just run no races and have a beauty pageant for the championship?  The best owners are rich and win because they have been the best owners over the years.|`|Lcot0LCoaa	well that is what I think should happen|`|Qw4l9R68aa	Because the Chase drivers would be Jr., Jimmie, Jeff, and Tony each year.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Because then you'd go from the richest to the most popular.  Those that are good drivers who the fans dislike would never make it in, regardless of whether or not they deserve it.|`|7RUMbREoaa	I do agree with you that only the richest owner's really have a shot at getting their teams in the Chase.However,like the guy before me said,it wouldn't work with fan voting either.There would always be Jr. with the  1 seed even if he is 43rd in the standings.There would be some drivers(like Kyle Busch) who wouldn't even have a shot at it even if he were leading the points going into the Chase.    Also,I definitely would not compare it to the BCS bullcrap.At least the Chase is set by a consistent system(you are either in the top 12 or not).One can't decide who is in the Chase by "difficulty of schedule" because they all race the same guys every week.
AA10248312	0-82.  <br>  <br>  The best college teams might (and I stress the word might) have , at most, two, and no more than three players that will be drafted by the NBA.<br>  <br>  How often does a college team have all 5 of its starters even make an NBA roster?|`|tzrLDbHWaa	They would win some games.  I mean you're talking 82 games, some against the worst teams in the NBA.  They wouldn't win many, would probably be the worst record in NBA history, but 0-82 is highly unlikely.  Even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in awhile.|`|ur1bnkrZaa	i do think they would end up 0-82 with some really really really low scoring games.. like in the 119 to 23 or sumthn crazy like that|`|67EaIAvbaa	they might beat the clippers..if they had a great game.|`|0J834CA0aa	yes they would they have go 0-82 the wrist teams like Clippers would beat them by 20 the good teams like LA boston and Cleveland would beat them by 100|`|8qH5q7TGaa	They probably wouldn't win any. NBA players are all sick athletes and amazingly skilled. Not to mention huge and very strong|`|xRPjgGs1aa	31- 51|`|21J0IIZbaa	The best college team would beat the following: Clippers, Bobcats, T-Wolves, Thunder, Kings, Bucks, Grizzlies.  <br>  15-20 wins|`|mwxKnUleaa	Yes I just can't see who they would beat, because if you look at NBA rosters even the teams that struggle in the league have players who played outstanding in college and have gone through the ups and downs of the NBA

If so can I have more brownie points for that?    Federer vs. Roddick - Once Federer gets into the latter parts of the slams he gets on a roll (just ask our little giant) and Federer has mastered the art of flicking his wrist for the return of serve.  Federer should take this one without to much problem, and hopefully he can tie Pete's record, because after he gets 15 I don't think I want him to win another slam again.  Federer 6-4 6-4 7-5    Elena Dementieva vs. Serena Williams - Hmmmm toughie, I want to go with Elena since Serena hasn't entirely been on her game and Elena is undefeated this year, but it will be a close one.....so how about Serena 6-3 4-6 7-5    Vera Zvonareva vs. Dinara Safina - I want Vera to win, plus she has spent less time on court and has won the last 3 meetings between the two.

Nadal will win the other, and Fedrer will emerge the overall victor; he's got this one in the BAG.    womens: Serena will win that semi round, zvonareva will win the other because Safina is not playing up to her usual and is being very inconsistent.

65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	I'd say the 1500m, its really the first event (if going down the list from shortest to longest) where conditioning and strategy are nearly of equal importance.    You've got to have the super-stamina of a long-sprinter, but also the game plan skills of those who run longer distances, all combined with the mental toughness to handle 4 minutes of continuous, top level exertion.  Shorter races are, well, shorter.  Longer races often afford the opportunity to relax for 50 or 100m without ruining your chances of winning.  You can't do that in the mile.|`|eflQHBK2aa	If you count cross country its got to be the 5k. it takes to the most amount of endurance and strategy. When to pass someone or make a move. Also, when to go all out on the final stretch.  On the track though i think the most challenging is the 400m race. thats because u need to know how good your endurance is to know when the time is appropriate to go all out. Whether it be from the gun or midway. Also, in the 400m you are running as fast as you can for the longest period. Every other race is longer so u pace or shorter so its a full out sprint no matter what|`|EOxqdThTaa	I think that the 800m is the hardest race. I have to run it, and it's really challenging because it's a very fast race but also distance. So it takes a lot of  both endurance and speed.|`|ybTgq7eAaa	The 800m is by far the most challenging running race. It takes endurance, but it is still pretty much a sprint.

AA11016927	Depends on what your fishing for and what part of the water column your fishing in. <br>  <br>  In most cases, I like Braided lines (Power Pro/Fireline Braid) for most casting (VS Trolling) applications. <br>  <br>  However, Mono and Flurocarbon have their place, (in certain situations). <br>  <br>  Depends.|`|KJWxqQHiaa	I use Stren a lot, and i usually bass, carp or catfish with it. For panfish, i like Cajun Red Line (It's cheap.) or other mono's. I also think Berkley Big Game is very good for the price. <br>  <br>  For lures, it depends what i fish for. But, here's what i normally use.<br>  <br>  Bass - plastic worms, spinnerbaits, top-waters, or other soft-plastics.<br>  <br>  Panfish - Grubs, or in-line spinners. I use beetle spins too, but that's the only spinnerbait (Excluding in-line spinners) that i use for them.<br>  <br>  Trout - In-line spinners exclusively. I don't trout fish much (Not many quality trout fisheries around here, and only one place here in Knott County that you can target them.) <br>  I do occasionally use the Kastmaster though. (I had to buy one when a bunch of people on here recommended it.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.|`|155d0ecdf11afeeeadf9b3048aac99f9aa	Some times fly fishing may help me out and have good luck on it too.|`|c81fa0395c7807a69ecfa0cdd3674cb1aa	i like berkely hi test line and power pro braided line|`|qaj8KTzxaa	Keep in mind that rod reel and line all compliment each other. Too heavy a line will result in short casts and light line might not be strong enough for larger species. If fishing fresh water 8-10 lb test is all you need.

1jmXT4Vvaa	Shot placement is everything, that being said, most misses in bow hunting are caused by improper distance calculation.  You thought it was 30 yards and it was 38 etc.  Speed makes for a flatter trajectory, giving you more room for error.  I have seen a number of deer jump the arrow as well.  They will jump between the time the arrow leaves the bow and the time the arrow gets to them.  Faster bow equals less time in flight.  There is nothing wrong with a slower bow, it is just a little more challenging.  You need to practice a little more with your range estimation and make sure your target isn't alert to your presence when you loose your arrow (which you should be doing with a fast bow anyways).  Personally if I was a deer, I'd worry more about a guy with a 270 fps bow that had practiced a lot than I would about a guy that shot his 350 fps bow a few dozen times a year.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Don't get hung up on published speeds.  They will vary with arrow and point choices.  Since you will be shooting at 30 yd.s or less, the difference   in flight time is negligable.  How well your bow is set up for you will be far more important   then what brand you buy.  Purchase your bow from a shop that will spend some time   tuning it for you.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	your bear will be fine. i use a jennings it's 278fps. there are way too many bows to list. you like the bear get it. get good with it from where your gonna sit, ground, tree. shot placement is everything.|`|IVGrDYJ5aa	I shoot a Bear Element and love it, but the true answer depends on what you are hunting. 270 fps is enough to put down any large game animal in North America, though some may not agree. Your speed will vary however based on how many grains your broadhead is and the weight of the arrow. Also if the draw weight varies from say 60 to seventy pounds and you shoot the bow with a draw weight of 60 pounds you will not get the full 270 it will drop a few fps ( the fps is shown at optimum performance, Full draw weight, no wind 100 grain broadhead and so on.)                              I highly recommend a Bear. You will get a little better performance out of a Hoyt although i do not personally believe it is worth the extra money.|`|d24f7a30bc118870baac73f6e65257d6aa	Don't get caught up in the hype.  Speed is just one part of the equation, a very small part of what sends your arrow though an animal.  If your going to target shoot...speed and light arrows are a great combo.  For hunting, speed is a non-issue for most bows on the market including any in the Fred Bear line up. Equip your bow with heavy arrows, the heavy arrows will make them slower but will increase their penetration ability.  It takes allot of time and money to get enough speed to effect penetration, but adding weight is inexpensive and the gains are achieved with less work.  Research arrow penetration, KE, and arrow building.  This will show you how little speed has to do with killing deer and how much it's really targeted at you to buy the sports car rather than the wagon.  Here's a great place to get any question answered...|`|zeXMAsF7aa	No speed doesn't count for much if you miss at 300 fps or at 150 fps its still a miss. my bowyer shot a bear with a bow that shoots a wooden arrow at 140ish fps and it went 40 yards so placement is every thing and a sharp broadhead.|`|xOReEw6Waa	Speed isn't everything, accuracy and shot placement is, just like in rifle hunting. A deer isn't going to tell the difference between getting hit at 270 or 305 FPS. More important is your ability and that the bow is quiet when you draw and shoot. Try to practice on 3-D targets and study animal anatomy, they have a book called "The Perfect Shot" for N. American and African game animals and is a good thing to check for at the library.|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	No. Hitting the target is everything.

If this happens, San Francisco would be clear front-runners to win the NL West.    Scenario two: The more likely scenario. Dodgers sign Ramirez; This would once again solidify a powerful lineup including young stars Matt Kemp, James Loney, and Russell Martin. This would give the Dodgers a slight edge over the Giants and would make LA the favorite to win the NL West|`|a51AvQrlaa	D-Backs|`|Ch40nAvCaa	It depends if the Dodgers get Manny back or not.|`|iz5zDFxvaa	It's a toss up between the Giants and D-backs! Both have made some moves this offseason, especially the Giants. Dodgers have let most of their key players get away (Lowe, Penny, Saito, etc) and Manny might be next to go elsewhere. If the Dodgers don't make some moves this offseason, they can kiss their chances of making the playoffs this year goodbye because they will NOT make it until they fix their rotation and bring some artillery to their hitting staff.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	I don't think the question should be who will win the division as much as who won't lose it.  I think the D-backs will win it unless the Dodgers get Manny back, but the winner will probably the only team over .500.|`|MjMkPi0yaa	I think the giants will win with their pitching.

All they need is a GREAT bat and they are in|`|OutwChXwaa	In the last few years (not including last year) the NL West has been an exciting division. Ever since the NL starting using the three division format (1994), only twice as the NL West champion returned to win the division the next year (Arizona in 2001 and 2002 and San Diego in 2005 and 2006). Most of the NL West teams have lost crucial component of their offenses or defenses this season with the exception of the Diamondbacks. The Rockies lost Matt Holiday, the Padres lost Jake Peavy and the Giants lost Barry Zito, a vital veteran of that pitching staff and the Dodgers lost Manny. So the odds are pretty good for the Diamondbacks to take the division. It should be a good year though!|`|0HCop2Bbaa	The NL West is pathetic. No team in the division is good enough to be a "playoff" team. Somebody has to make it, I suppose.    I think it depends on what goes on in the next couple of weeks. There have been rumors about the Giants getting Manny. If they can pull that off, I would have to pick them. Their pitching is awesome, and their defense is good. They are one good hitter away.    If they can't get him, I would have to say the D-Backs. I like their lineup, and their staff is pretty good, too.    By the way, nmpanthers21, what are you talking about, "the Giants have lost Barry Zito.." No they didn't. He is the third guy on their rotation.|`|BlAL7mELaa	I think the Dodgers will win and I think that this year it will be more compititive.

tLLWMy7iaa	I have watched every mavericks game this season and have come to the following conclusions:<br>  <br>  1. Kidd is not the problem, and the trade for Devin Harris was NOT a mistake. If Harris had remained in Dallas, he would not be an all-star - he would be primarily responsible for getting the ball to Dirk, Jet, and Josh and would not flourish as he is now. I'm happy for him. Kidd is showing why he is one of the greatest point guards ever this year, but his impact does not show up in stats: he hustles, plays amazing defense, and does all the intangible things.<br>  <br>  2. The mavericks sorely lack a good big man. Erick Dampier is TERRIBLE. I cannot even stress how bad he is. His one-on-one defense is passable but his team defense is horrendous, and his offense nonexistent. He regularly has games with 1 or 2 rebounds. Tony Parker dominated last night not because of Kidd's lack of defense, but because the Spurs screened for him every time, leaving Damp (or some other big man) to guard him. Dirk is alright in the post, but Carlisle rarely calls plays for him there, and plus he is more effective out on the wing. We need a dominant big man badly. <br>  <br>  3. Josh Howard is a cancer both on and off the court. You are familiar with his bone-headed actions in his personal life, so I won't even talk about that. But while he is playing, he is lazy on defense, never hustles, and is a non-factor after the first half. Oh, and he never passes, electing instead to shoot stepback jumpers every time he touches the ball.<br>  <br>  4. Rick Carlisle is a huge bust. He was supposed to be a good coach, but as I've watched his play calling and strategy this year, he seems really incompetent. Last night, it took him two and a half quarters to realize the Spurs were setting picks for Tony Parker EVERY SINGLE TIME and letting him go one-on-one with our slower big men. I was literally screaming at the tv for the Mavs to go zone and make the spurs beat them from the outside! Plus, he benches some of our most promising and hard-working players (JAMES SINGLETON). On top of this, he is very plain and doesn't seem like he can fire up his players very well. <br>  <br>  A combination of these things, I think, is what is making the Mavs so schizophrenic this season. Every great player in this league either is, or has, a good post player. Kobe has Gasol and Bynum; LeBron has Z; Dwight is Dwight; Chris Paul has David West and Tyson Chandler; etc. Dirk has no one, and has had no one for the past decade. This is why the Mavericks are floundering.|`|vxz91VBfaa	All of the above i guess. I dont watch them enough cause i live on he east cost. Well from the games i have seen is they relly too much on dirk. The game agaisnt boston where they could of won Dirk had the ball like every possecion.

If Terry was healthy he would have been on Parker, but without him the Mavs have no way of stopping opposing point guards.  <br>  <br>  The Mavs took a chance with the Kidd trade, hoping he would be able to lead them to a ring before age caught up with him.  It looks like that's not going to happen now.  It's kind of ironic, because a few years ago Mark Cuban decided not to resign Steve Nash because he was worried about being stuck with an over-the-hill point guard.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	No defense every time some allstar is playing them there defense always falls apart.|`|W6jjsiMxaa	no defence, parker owned them by dropping 37.|`|ur1bnkrZaa	why do they struggle every year around this time?|`|9pDEhA1Xaa	They need a coach!

AA10304847	The Cardinal defense can stand up to the Steeler offense, the question though is can the Steeler scary defense shut down the impressive Card receivers?     The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     The "us against the world" mentality is the other big edge for the CARDS, used to win the last 3 playoff games.....|`|qhvQDcdfaa	steeelerrsss|`|U6WmAb6Jaa	Arizona i hope=]|`|fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	The best team.  :)  The one who plays the best.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	take AZ and the 7pts|`|06382CnOaa	hope to god arizona, but over here we've been way to cocky and gloating to much|`|hOH33uBnaa	GO STEELERS!|`|qZNdKQPmaa	Steelers babyy ;)|`|GOAGQZg3aa	ARIZONIA ALL THE WAY!!!!!

AA12274507	RWS Superdome. Crosman Premier Domed HP's work very well also.<br>   <br>  A Quality adult Air rifle can easily and very effectively take out birds by the way. Your Remington Airmaster is more than capable of taking many species of birds. So don't listen to the misinformed above me.<br>  <br>  We have birds that can be shot year round (except in shotgun deer season) here in MA. They are the English Sparrow and Starling. You still need a license to hunt them but they are really in abundance as far as their numbers.<br>  <br>  In MA, it doesn't say you can use an Airgun but it don't say you can't either. All it says is you may use a rifle.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	If they're game birds, you shouldn't be using an air rifle.  If they're not game birds, you shouldn't be shooting them.|`|EGe0k8P6aa	When shooting birds you should use the pellet which is most accurate in your air-rifle. There is no one best choice. You have to experiment and see what pellet type and brand shoots best in your gun.<br>  <br>  As far as airguns being able to take birds, Mike's right. Pretty much any airgun that can deliver 3 ft-lbs of impact energy can take birds at reasonable ranges. All the hunting airguns I know of can take birds out to 30 yards or so if you can properly place your pellets at those distances. The only issue is you need to make sure its legal to use an airgun to hunt small game and birds where you live/hunt.|`|35aUnX8Xaa	Mikes choice is an excellent pellet.

91p3bqzIaa	No, it sure wont, but I have been shooting a bow for years and although its never happened to me i know several people who have had "accidents."  What your doing wont hurt your bow, but if i could offer some advice just put a arrow on the knock each time you draw, if you continue to let up smooth you will have no problems.  But if you do happen to slip a small hole in the wall is much easier to fix than bow limbs.|`|wMvd9x06aa	Nope, aslong as you dont let go fully and just slowly return the string back to its original position there is no trouble, you wont damage the limbs :)|`|8W53Y9vJaa	Not at all.

27fd034847d3d27fde933f822451de7baa	i severely sprained my ankle in sept. and when i skied for the first time this season in early Dec. my boot fit very poorly (from swelling?) and I had a spot that was giving me a tremendous pressure point.(where the actual sprain was) I loosened that buckle slightly. skied all day w/ no problem. the problem came when it was time to take the boot off. i had to get someone else to help me spread the boot apart so i could wiggle out without hurting my foot. Depending on your boot fit I wouldn't necessarily recommend taping the ankle. The tape could make things worse. I like my boots extra tight and a band-aid bothers me so tape would have been out of the question. I snowboarded for 2 weeks. no problems. no pain. now my ankle is fine and my boots are fitting like the custom foot gloves that they are!  if you don't have extra room in your boot your ankle should be adequately supported. just warm the boot up before you remove it. btw. I have 27 days on snow to date so i have been using the ankle.|`|DD5Gsqx4aa	Likewise, I wouldn't pass that up for the world. Make sure you protect your ankle in any way possible, like wrapping it up. Be prepared to ice it the day after, as the awkward pressure will most likely hurt. Being that you're a teen like me I will make an assumption that you might like to go big in the park or pipe. My suggestion would be to stay away from huge kickers and stay on the c-rails, kinked rails, and boxes.   Good luck and enjoy (wish my school had a ski trip = )|`|JeNN7ZNqaa	dont where thick socks, just a thin layer of tape because your ankle will be swollen and already taking more room, and taking up to much room will cut off your circulation and that is not good.  just stay off of it as much as you can and ice 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off.  take a painkiller like advil before you go out and you should be pretty good.|`|2JOZUP6taa	I would suggest wrapping your ankle with sports tape or an ace bandage first.  Wear two pairs of socks.  Try it, see how it feels.  It may feel ok, but you will probably have swelling and soreness the next day.  It's basically feeling it out and going with it.|`|RZJLLxnUaa	i would ice it first, then if it's not in too much pain go for it.just take it fairly easy

It really doesn't matter that much about weight (I mean, it doesn't hurt either), but if you can't do a good heel stretch or scale then it really doesn't matter. If you really want to fly, you should work on become really flexible. It definitely helps if you weigh only a little bit like you do, but it doesn't help if you can't do anything while you are in the air. You should work on your splits and heel stretches, then I am sure that you will be a flyer when cheer leading season begins.

The planned stadium was the subject of a protracted legal battle. A lawsuit by local automobile franchise mogul and former Philadelphia Eagles owner Norman Braman contested the legality of the deal with Miami-Dade County and the City of Miami. However, Miami-Dade County Judge Beth Cohen dismissed all the charges in Braman's lawsuit. Braman is likely to appeal, but there is only a slight chance of the appeal being heard, so construction will begin soon. When completed, the seating capacity will be 37,000, making it the second smallest stadium (in capacity) in the MLB. Set to open in April 2012, the stadium would become only the sixth MLB stadium to have a retractable roof, joining Rogers Centre, Chase Field, Safeco Field, Miller Park, and Minute Maid Park. The Marlins will share Dolphin Stadium with the NFL's Miami Dolphins and the Miami Hurricanes football team starting in the 2008 season until 2010 when the Marlins' current lease runs out. The new stadium will not be ready until 2012, so the team needs to work out an extension of the lease.
i0QzvbSnaa	Well, if you must know - next year it will he a huge advantage for the home team.     It is jerry's life long dream come true, why he might be willing to hire Dan Reeves to guide the process, and hold that trophy high above his head and smile soooo big that that surgical stuff around his mouth actually tears and he starts looking like Michael Jackson.|`|a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	It was a big boost to the Bucaneers once they got rolling.

6205283364bce5bf761e31dbab2a3426aa	I was unable to find a video but i will keep looking   meanwhile here is a site that teaches you   http://www.ehow.com/how_2000912_float-se...    heres one   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re8ZG5OQZ...|`|K87vKkA8aa	Float and Spin , and when you toss up the ball with backspin (spin serve) and hit it really hard it will float a little bit to (Float-Spin(my fave)|`|qRA0rA5Taa	try youtube.com|`|9xElJzxSaa	a floater isnt that hard if you have the techinique.    first hold the ball out in front of you, with your arm straight, toss it up but do it a little lower then your normal serve, now this is important.. you have to hit the ball with an open pall, because that doesnt mae the ball spin. It takes a little bit of time but you'll get it :)|`|61YYOcLVaa	I really do not know any websites, you could possibly try youtube? But I can tell you how to float serve..    Take the ball put infront of you just like you are going to serve.  Where the hole is to pump the ball make sure that it is faced down toward the floor and put your left or right middle finger (which ever hand you serve with) ontop of the hole. Then thrown the ball up just a little bit passed your head and hit it on the way down with the palm of your hand and hit straight into it.    Hope that might work for you!|`|2CWmEnlHaa	well idk but to float serve u simplly serve but instead of following thro u stop when u make contact with the ball!!!!!! good luck!|`|2C8Kjj78aa	I like Misty May Treanor's site for well-produced instructional videos.  www.mistymay.com.  The videos are listed in the box on the right side of the screen.|`|60c1c3cd65f0c9deb7c8cdbb1a06ba1baa	There's the standing float, standing topspin, jumping float, and jumping top spin.     Float serves are difficult to master. Just remember to keep your palm as open and flat as possible, toss the ball with minimal amount of spin (easier in a standing float), and that you do NOT snap your wrist or follow through after contacting the ball. Just straight and out.
8MUj24s6aa	Any semi-auto .22lr can be picky. I suggest CCI mini-mags. It does not gum up the barrel and will shoot everytime.<br>  <br>  as for the gun...I like the size, fit, and feel of the Mosquito to the P22.<br>  <br>  That is the one I went for.<br>  <br>  My Mosquito also shoots the Remmington .22 ammo from walmart (550 for 17.00) but out of the 550 about 200 did not fire.|`|99dde179de70f1317248d9ffaaf554b0aa	Walther|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	I have no experience with the sig, but I did have a walther p22.  It was the jammenest little pistol I've ever seen.  I sent it down the road.  I tried several different types of ammo.  The only way it would feed was if it was literally dripping gun oil.  I WILL NOT own a semi auto that does not feed.  That's the quickest way to earn a one way ticket out of my gun safe.|`|4i133cAVaa	I have the Mosquito and it only seems to like CCI ammo. Otherwise it shoots well. If i had it to do it over i would get a Ruger or an Walther SP22 with a longer barrel for target practice. The Ruger has better sights than the SIG. <br>  <br>  Good luck shopping|`|cLm5FqWnaa	I have the Walther and a Ruger MK2. The Walther is fun to shoot, but given the choice I would take the MK2 anyday. A lot less picky and a lot more accurate.|`|fC64C0diaa	They are both a bit picky about ammo. However, the Walther is less picky than the Mosquito.

GGEAttkgaa	zuca bags are awsome for figure-skating!!!!!! i love mine.... Oh yeah and by the way you are supposed to wear tights from the start lol. But yes these are the things you need for skating.    Zuca bag  Tights (about 6 pairs depending on how often you skate)  Figure Skates (and DONT remember to get them sharpend every 6 weeks!)  Skate-grards  3 pairs of gloves  Butt/hip pads (so you don't get hurt if you take a bad fall!)  maybe 2 skating dresses would be nice!  black stretch skating pants (3)  and a few cute sweaters!    Hope I helped!  (but i think maybe you could hold off with the skating dresses until you go to a higher level or a skating show or something) :)|`|L3VbnH1faa	Look online or ask around at the rink for a good skating store. they have plenty of competition dresses, dance dresses, practice skirts, skates, skate guards, tights and more.     before you buy tights decide which type you want. There are three main kinds:    Regular: Just regular tights    Stirrup: Open at the bottom with velcro stirrups. Can be done up inside the skate or under your boot.    Over-the-boot: Entirely covers the boot.     A plain suitcase will do just as fine as a zuca bag. their like the ROXY or BENCH of skate bags. Just another name brand that you can have just to show it off, but in know way superior to other ones. sure, your stuff will be all "organized" but it's no better than a 20 dollar suitcase whereas you will spend over 100 dollars on a zuca bag|`|lzHeelVKaa	No offense but please, I don't think you are a "figure skater" just yet.     Give yourself some time. Don't get dresses until you're at a higher level, like axels or something or for competition. Get a skirt maybe when you're in or above Basic 3... same with tights.    Zuca bags aren't necessary unless you have your own skates. I got mine when I was in the Delta level... which is equivalent to Basic 8.|`|5nvgGbcmaa	you'd probably get tights and practice dresses when you're in a competitive level. i took figure skating up to free skate 2 and didn't ever need to get any, but then again i never entered any competitions. if your rink puts on exhibitions (which are for all levels) you would be given a costume and have extra practices and stuff.   as for equipment, if you have skates i'd get a basic, durable bag for them as well as some skate guards. also, keep a small towel in your bag to wipe off the ice and water off of them after practicing (so they won't rust) hope this helps : ) have fun skating!|`|NxlA3f6Paa	I have been skating for a really long time. If you really love skating and say you are going to do it for a long time then I say you can get skating gear whenever you feel comfortable wearing it.I have skating tights and a few different dresses. I love my zuca bag. They are very expensive but they are totally worth it. They are very useful and you can fit so much stuff in it. So if you already have your own skates, then I would definately recommend getting one.

tvuhGTD9aa	The major league record is four. The most recent time this was done was by Carlos Delgado in 2003.<br>  <br>  The minor league record is eight, by Nig Clarke in 1902. This game, which had a final score of 51-3, was played on an irregular field (it was not often used, and the fences, such as they were, have not been accurately recorded), and defies description sufficiently that there is no one reliable box score (though the final score doesn't appear to be in dispute). Very strange game.<br>  <br>  -----<br>  Oh look, the politeness filters are working overdrive.

W4LGDVsIaa	Training and practice!  In swimming you need to build your lung capacity to be able to have stamina, the best drill to do for that are underwaters.  Push off the wall and dolphin kick under the water for as long as you can, or until you reach the end of the pool.  You can also use resistance and weights to increase your endurance.
exBs58QVaa	Well its like 2009 so it does'nt matter how long  teams have been playing against each other. It's a new century, new decade & new year of Rugby so it's preety much anybodys' ball game. But....if you wish to weight in History then a little flashback for the Welsh fans out there may be in order, remember the 2007 Rugby World Cup....yeah Wales got the thumping from minnows Fiji. This means if Fiji can kick Wales out of the World Cup, I believe the French should'nt have a problem with the Welsh unless they have'nt lifted their ball game. But anyways good luck to both teams.<br>  P.S: If Sebastian Chabal is in the line up, then the Welsh gotta be ready to make reservations in the nearest Health Facility.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	I think Wales will be too good but it is in Paris so the French may try that much harder.<br>  <br>  The big game will be Ireland v Wales.

ZWkX43zMaa	Thank you. No one gives any credit to Drew Brees or the Saints. And to EVERYONE, Reggie Bush is NOT a bust, he's been very productive when he's healthy (he won't put up huge rushing numbers like AP, but he set the league record for receptions by a rookie running back. That has to mean something). Remember when he was leading the league in touchdowns before he got injured? Anyways, back to the point. I think Brees doesn't get mentioned with them because the Saints don't have a ring. He is every bit as good at Peyton and Tom; he just doesn't have a ring. But it will all change next year, my friend.     Super Bowl XLIV Champion will be the New Orleans Saints!!!|`|qivUrJ3Naa	What has he won?|`|a59796a93e9118b10a4496b3195421eaaa	Come back when he wins a Super Bowl.

Yes, it is unfair that he is held to account for linebackers and stuff, but that is the way it is.  The QB gets too much credit for winning and too much blame for a loss.    As Patriot fans we've seen it with Brady.  In XXXVI the MVP should have been Ty Law.  (In XXXIX it should have been Rodney Harrison, but the "winner" was not Brady.)|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	He's no Bubby Brister that's for sure|`|KZsdVGJzaa	doesn't have a ring and i question his decision making|`|lP9kQmRraa	Because he hasn't won a Super Bowl and the Saints have a culture of losing.|`|qxgpXA6kaa	???

My 11 year old can deer  hunt in Washington state, but not in Idaho till he is 12, so some states have a minimum age while others do not. Some separate out small game and big game also, so you can hunt rabbits when you are 6 and not deer till 14 or 16. In almost every case you need to complete a Hunter Education course, which is a great thing to do anyway. Most state require the course but once you get your Orange Card other states recognize it most of the time, so you only have to do the test once in a lifetime.    EDIT: Yes, in most states you need to be directly supervised by an adult till you are 14,16,18,21, depending on the state laws and the Federal rules on gun use.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Read here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politic...    I won't copy and paste whole parts or an article like some people do.|`|nooi0ldjaa	you don't need a gun license in the U.S.|`|IVGrDYJ5aa	I disagree with the above posters. While it does depend on the state and most accept a valid drivers license I live in the state of Illinois where you need a FOID card (Firearm Owners Identification Card) In order to get the card you have to be at least thirteen and pass a background check that takes 6 to 8 weeks. And even while you can get the card at thirteen you cannot buy a rifle or carry one even while hunting unless you are under direct supervision of a FOID card holding adult until you are 18 and then if it is a hundgun you need to be under the supervision of a FOID card holding adult until you are 21|`|c474fd81caa3e43b78b2c3cb23eb0a39aa	I don't know about New Zealand, (sorry).  I just wanted to give a shout out to all those free states (most of which are in the US) that allow gun ownership.|`|1njsqy0laa	Most of us are from the USA which means we wont be much help here. Sorry.     In the US most states don't require a gun license, but those that do require you to be either 18 or 21.     I would imagine that IF New Zealand requires firearms licenses it would be the age at which a person is legally an adult.    I would look into hunting or shooting organizations in New Zealand or within your local area. They can give you a better answer than us.

Kansas Speedway 426 miles  http://www.kansasspeedway.com/  The prices vary from track to track. Check the tracks website out.  Have fun!|`|iO12Vjnvaa	I would say that Talladega or Texas would be the closest to ya. Nascar is great! Hang around this forum enough maybe you can pick up some things. Ticket prices vary....you may want to check their websites.....but generally you are looking at $40 for crappy seats....up to several hundred dollars for the good ones. Good luck and hope ya'll have a great time!!!!!!    Just an opinion as always.|`|OfQwVhD2aa	Oh boy are you gonna have some fun!  The closest track near you is Texas Motor Speed way.  They have a race on 04 / 05 / 09 called the the Samsung 500 that I found at NASCAR . Com  Go to this web site & pull up the sprint cup schedule.  Then click on tickets for  the price of tickets & then click on travel for   A hotel to stay at.  Warning after you go to your first NASCAR  race your hooked ! !  btw Scope out the info fron superdave rip maggies cody  NASCAR is going to run their whelin modifides at Bristol this year. Find out about them at  NASCAR s web site under home tracks.|`|74792a199b94cdf95f223d686149faf0aa	Depends.  I mean, Nashville and Memphis both have tracks, but only races Nationwide and not Sprint cup.  Dallas has the Texas speedway which races both. If ya want to consider Talladega Alabama close, then their is a track their as well.  Their is a site below...hope it helps.    P.S.  I am actually taking a trip to Little Rock/Hot Springs.  Heading out Friday, and been trying to figure out what are some of the best attractions.  If ya wouldnt mind sending me a message of the best things to do around the area.  We are staying there (Hot Springs) for a week, and want some fun things to do.  Thanks!|`|4l0yGuE9aa	Texas is about 350 miles from Little Rock Arkansas (close to a  5 to 5 1/2  hour drive)    3601 Highway 114  Fort Worth, TX 76177    There is Memphis Motorsports Park and Nashville Superspeedway and Gateway International Raceway at all over 6 hours drive but they are not Cup Series tracks.|`|2dfe1a04cbba62e3fc3fa1e11c8562e9aa	The nearest track that holds Nascar events is Memphis Motorsports Park in Memphis. It is host to one race in the Nationwide Tour and one in the Truck Series.    The closest track with Cup Series races is Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, 4-5 hours away. Next is Talladega, AL, about 6-7 hours, then Bristol TN, about 9 hours from Little Rock.    You can go here to get track info and for each track there are links to ticket info.    http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/|`|vkT7xRuxaa	Probably Kansas city. It cannot be too far away. That or Fort Worth.|`|500b01b2c821cf9bf9cbf4aaebd13417aa	chicagoland?|`|3428e05827d8a97d81a01c7d1a8a99efaa	Memphis is the closest track to LR, you can see the trucks run there.     Texas is the next closest track, all three series run at Texas.     Kansas would be the next closest track all three series run there as well.      I've been to Kansas and Texas and I prefer Kansas speedway a lot more than Texas. It's a little easier getting out of Kansas when the races are over and it's a really easy drive up I-40 to I-540 straight to Kansas City.    Watch EBay and Craigslist for tickets, last year we went to Texas for about 80 bucks and Kansas for just over a hundred.
euOtDB3Baa	Hey, if it you think it sounds like fun, then go for it!  I love it, but don't be discouraged if you fall a lot on the first day.  Snowboarding is tougher to learn, but easier to fool around with once you get it.  Go with your friends and, hey, have fun!  Good luck on the slopes!|`|5V6jEg9saa	Yeah you should be OK just be careful especially since it is your first time one a board/skis, and wear a helmet they will help if you fall on your back. Just start on the small bunny hills.|`|a0a8LsN5aa	Yea it can get frustrating when your learning but it is worth it just keep all your wait in your front foot and slide your back leg left and right. go heal toe heal toe. Good luck|`|DbyvTE4laa	definitely ... especially if u just start on the bunny sloops (little hills)...  u definitely will take a couple of tumbles but don't worry about that it honestly it doesn't really hurt its just cold   take ur time and have fun :)|`|jK2xUOyTaa	As a very experienced snowboarder let me say this:    Snowboarding, like most hobbies requires a LOT of time and effort before you get where you want to be. Yes, i do think you should try snowboarding if you want to. BUT I suggest you do a few things.   1. WEAR A HELMET! even if you arent doing "extreme things" you can still accidentally fall backwards  2. Start off small! go only on the bunny hill at first and get used to turning and stopping correctly. once you can go top to bottom and be confident, move up to some greens.   3. Stay with friends. give eachother advice, have fun with people, and stick together in case someone gets hurt.    most important, HAVE FUN! snowboarding can be a very fun sport, but you need to be smart about it

RjQLB9s1aa	The website below tells you all you need to know about Arthur Ashe.  <br>  <br>  This is a "small" extract from it;<br>  <br>  On July 10, 1943 Arthur Robert Ashe Jr. was born to parents Arthur Sr. and Mattie C. Ashe in Richmond, Virginia. Arthur began learning tennis from an early age, in part because his father took a post at Brook Field in 1947. The position came with a house that was located in the middle of the blacks-only playground at Brook Field, which was an 18-acre park that included tennis courts. At the same time as he was playing tennis, he was an avid reader and straight A student. In 1950, a few months before Arthur's 7th birthday, his mother died of complications from surgery. In 1950 Arthur met Ronald Charity, one of the best black tennis players in the nation and a part-time tennis coach, who took an interest in Arthur. He began working with him regularly, teaching him strokes and proper form. By 1953 it was apparent that Arthur had a talent for tennis but needed a proper coach in order to keep improving. At this point Charity introduced him to Dr. Walter Johnson, who would become his lifelong coach and mentor. Dr. Johnson was also the coach of the only African-American competing in world tennis at that time, Althea Gibson.<br>  <br>  Arthur continued with his tennis under Johnson's instruction and in 1958 became the first African-American to play in the Maryland boys' championships. This was also his first integrated tennis competition. During the summer Arthur could travel and participate in competitive tournaments around the country; during the school year his competition was much more limited because he was limited to black opponents from Richmond and there were only outdoor tennis courts for blacks. In order for him to continue his tennis, he was sent away before beginning his senior year in high school to St. Louis, Missouri. He stayed with a friend of Johnson, Richard Hudlin and enjoyed a number of strong tennis opponents. At this time he was also making a name for himself, having won multiple junior tennis tournaments around the nation and being featured in the December 12, 1960 issue of Sports Illustrated as a Face in the Crowd. It was at this time that the University of California, Los Angeles offered him a full scholarship to attend college there.<br>  <br>  Upon graduating from high school first in his class, Arthur went to UCLA, which had one of the best college tennis programs. Playing there brought him more recognition amongst tennis enthusiasts.|`|0zwnZKwiaa	Arthur Robert Ashe Jr. was born on July 10, 1943, in Richmond, Virginia. He spent most of his early years with his mother, Mattie Cordell Cunningham Ashe, who taught him to read at age five. She died the next year of heart disease at the age of 27. Ashe's father, Arthur Ashe Sr., worked as a caretaker for a park named Brook Field in suburban North Richmond. Young Arthur lived on the grounds with four tennis courts, a pool, and three baseball diamonds.  His early nickname was "Skinny" or "Bones," but he grew up to be six feet In 1977 Ashe married Jeanne Moutoussamy, a professional photographer and graphic artist. The couple had a daughter, Camera Elizabethone inch with a lean build.<br>  Ashe began playing tennis at age six. He came from a not wealthy family

He does not get as much credit that he deserves|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	No|`|6yknPnOVaa	Curtis sucks and Buckhalter has been a backup his whole career. Two bums!|`|5etFAmrsaa	Kevin Curtis is so fast, if you blink you'll miss him.    Correll Buckhalter should get more playing time because he is good, and Westbrook is always hurt|`|CL7OTeiCaa	they both are underrated. They are both great players, and make great plays.|`|0BgzkLdUaa	Kevin Curtis is very good. Very fast. I'd love to have him on the Bucs.|`|PSMsDalLaa	Nope.    I wouldn't want either on the giants, so no.|`|Fl4b4Yd4aa	Curtis for sure he's a lot faster than people think hes even faster than jackson and he's smart not like jason avant who instead of running into the open field tries to juke a defender and gets caught. Buckhalter is a little i mean hes no real power back but hes faster than most think|`|iKoNwk0Kaa	No, your under rated.  Curtis is a great WR, McNabb never gives him a chance, you seen him during the Cardinal game, he was very fast, good for big gains.   Buckhalter is also a great kick returner and runner back, once he has a hole, hes gone.    You do not know what your talking about.|`|q6NGxNR3aa	I don't think buckhalter is that good because he's injury phrone but I do agree with you about kevin curtis he's the faster white Receiver Ive seen in a long time and the rams were stupid to let him go.

qyATAaeXaa	Ski size is based on the make of the ski and your weight. Your shoe size has nothing to do with it. If you wear a US Men's 14 your ski boot size will be size 32(Mondo).|`|dcfVXO43aa	Ski size is based on height, not how big your feet are.|`|WVyaBzcdaa	I'm pretty sure it will be 12 or 13.  a bit smaller... but you can call them and ask.|`|UIlcj4Ouaa	boots are adjusted to the skiis, not the other way around. So you get your skiis based on your height and weight, and sometimes how good of a skier you are (usually not that last one, that can also be adjusted most of the time) and you make the bindings on the skiis bigger or smaller to be the right size for your boots
uj3TpkW6aa	i say backside, everyone else in the world says frontside|`|Z3l08BDAaa	its whatever feels more natural.frontside feels better for me, but im goofy|`|0VyMTIoKaa	frontside|`|FcNOkHquaa	It's easier to do them frontside for me....  I think it varies from person to person, most of my friends and me learned them frontside....    /m|`|DbyvTE4laa	whats ur stance ?  it depends on the person !!!  r u ride regular? or do u ride goofy ?  im a goofy, for me its backside|`|jK2xUOyTaa	which edge do you prefer to turn on. For me its heelside (frontside). So, i learned to 180 that way first. They both are pretty easy, hike a SMALL jump to start with and you should have it down in a few hours. Also, practice riding switch(backwards) so that you get used to it since you will land that way.|`|ZIu4DVslaa	backside|`|CckFjXIPaa	it's usually personal preference...  but when you do it front side you can see infront of you the whole rotation...|`|iEVwHmchaa	frontside. its like skateboarding you start with the basics first. if you go backside it is harder to balance. definitely|`|a0a8LsN5aa	Its all about what you like like me and my friend always get mad at each other because we are both regular ( left foot in front ) and he likes doing spins backside and I like them front side if I go front side I can 540 but backside I can only 360 and the same thing with him but the other way around. You just have to go out and see what one you like better.|`|bLrbDp0saa	Depends if your goofy or regular.  For me (regular) i think frontside is way easier because you don't have to turn your head around, you can just keep looking straight.
8orHBAykaa	There are pros and cons.    What breed is your dog? How old is it? How good of shape is it in? Is it an outdoor dog?     Basically, I think if your dog would be an asset and a good companion then take it.     I would look at a doggy backpack so the dog carries a lot of its own food and water.|`|CFQbdDRNaa	Bread fan is right, it does depend on the dog.If you think ..if a bear comes will the dog stand  or worse...run back to you with bear intail well thats not good!...................depends on the dog!|`|mMFJrPbvaa	Like Mtn Man stated...how will it react to a Bear...or any wildlife?  You wouldn't want to kill half the day pulling porcupine quills out of its face or de-skunking him in a tomato juice bath.  It`s not like a Jack Russell or anything that can get picked off by a hawk or eagle is it?  Stranger things have happened.  I`ve seen a lot of it lol|`|WOM8ZavGaa	I would probably say "no", but it really depends on the dog and how you think it would behave in the wilderness. Would it be an asset or a detriment? If you think that the dog is going to be a major help, bring it. If not, I would just leave it at home. Especially because you call it a "survival trip", I'm not so sure that I would want to be dragging a dog along with me, especially if it can't keep up.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	Tastes like chicken...|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	If worse comes to worse, you could always roast him on a spit.  Sorry, couldn't resist this one.
7xOLyGM8aa	the match will be at 3:30am or so..i live in nj to, but i dont think i will stay up for that match even tho i will love to. but yea the match should be around 3:30. depending on the ones before that..n if anything go on the Australian open site and it tells you what time is it over there and what time it is over here..i hope this helps|`|ezjarBMKaa	the first semi with fedrer and roddick in on feb. 29 (tomorrow) at 3:30 a.m. the second semi is on the 30 with nadal and verdasco at the same time. if you will get in trouble for turning on the t.v. at that time ( i would lol) then do what i'm gonna do-watch it on a laptop in your room at espn360.com. lol just a tip :D|`|YPiSspo9aa	you could stream it on channelsurfing.net at 3:30 am so like 5 and a half hours from now|`|Ectn7tkSaa	Well, right now the time is 4pm and the match starts at 7.30pm so it will start in 3.5 hours if you watch it live over there.|`|AbDAdrXkaa	you can watch it 3:30am ESPn on thursday morning

3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	Hey PV    The Marlin 60 is one of the most made guns ever, so you can find parts for it in lots of places. Actually Ebay still sells stocks for guns, so I went there first.             (Pretty Vacant....the Sex Pistol's song?)
1H2sTpyKaa	I'm not entirely sure of what you're asking, but I believe mine are just the normal Poweriser brand... I love them, even though I'm not very good... But I definitely recommend them.    I guess I haven't tried any of the other brands yet, but mine haven't given me any trouble at all. They're amazing. :)    Good luck!
KdhNCnEjaa	you know who really sucks? Sasha Vujacic    And to the Knicks, I love Wilson Chandler, he is going to be a star. Chandler and Lee are already two stars to build a franchise around, and Gallinari is showing some talent as well. Could this be another Big 3?    GO Celtics!   All the same|`|lMDy8W0Raa	I'm glad for the Kicks and their fans. They are a big team.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	Well looks like you don't need LeBron. We'll keep him, thank you very much.     And don't use "witness" and Knicks in the same sentence.|`|fuYYRJXtaa	They're doing pretty good, I mean they beat the Rockets, and now Atlanta... If they do make the playoffs, I doubt they'll advance to the 1st round.  They will face Boston, Cleveland, or Orlando... And they're just to powerful for the Knicks.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	You are, obviously.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Lol|`|ExVTrokAaa	what that guy said ^|`|BEiJCLSgaa	david lee should be in the AS game|`|JsVZQkWyaa	yea you guys won i kind of expected this after that lose at home to the suns. the 3rd quarter killed us. other than than we did good. all you guys need is a good center. the only person we have because of al horford's injury is smith and zaza and that is not enough. anyway no excuses good win hope to see you guys in the playoffs|`|EKF2HdZKaa	for the guy above me.........  i wonder how well kobe did with a garbage team........  how did wade do with a garbag team............    the knicks have been playin well thic year and might get that 8th spot   they do have anightmare week comin up though|`|uJB8ZCCraa	No, you won because of the Hawks TERRIBLE free point shooting. We had 15 points which would've won the game but Josh Smith missed 80% of his free throws (2-10). Well, gratz on the win though. I just hope the Hawks don't fall apart COMPLETELY this season. -.-|`|dDhTMacAaa	Where is your lineup to add with your essay, Anthony? ;)|`|cgAjzSVKaa	you are a very hardcore Knicks fan. You guys have been laughing stocks for years, so it;s nice to see you guys start turning things around. You have the same record as us, but you guys have momentum.    you guys have been winning against quality teams. Good for you guys.    congrats, and hopefully the Nets can beat you guys for that playoff spot.

97Xy6pEGaa	Wow. I never saw that before. I lost a lot of respect for KG right there. That and his extremely gay "Anything is posiblllllllle" crap after they stole the Finals against the Lakers. Anything is possible with Ray Allen and Paul Pierce carrying the team.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Wow, every NBA vet punks on the rookies, thats all KG was doing, thats not even bad.|`|Oes7TRNVaa	he's always done that and No its not the lowest not even top100|`|xgGTyqHRaa	wow thats cool, and funny at the same time, but when kg is in the game he makes everthing fun, like he did in that you tube video, thats what makes him a trash talker because he is still i friend, he just likes to make the game a little more exciting!|`|jj4ZbtrCaa	Kg is a d*ck he is a loser who with out Paul Pierce and Ray Allen could never win a championship yet alone bring his team to a final like Lebron did with a weak supporting cast. I think the media licks KGs a$$ and never says anything bad about him. He is a punk and he proved it in his post game celebration when the won the championship. It is one thing to celebrate but other to act like an a$$, I mean i have never seen anyone act like a crazy fool like him.|`|Ry4Jc96Aaa	not the lowest, but it was from kg...what do you expect/  he plays on the damn celtics for crying out loud!|`|kmk95QOMaa	KJ doent trash talk well there he did but not on a regular basis and HELL NO this is not the lowest seen i saw there r way more player s that started fight en ****|`|NmXKPDoIaa	KG's always been a trash talker.    Makes the games better, when a little extra drama is added.    Not the lowest act in history, that would be Ricky Davis Triple Double

Began in 1898 in Chicago, as the Morgan Athletic Club. Originally named for their "cardinal red" jerseys. Played in Chicago, St. Louis, and Phoenix. Home field in Chicago was Comiskey Park. Two NFL titles: 1925 and 1947. Owned by the Bidwill family since 1932. Merged with the Steelers in the 1944 season, because of wartime roster shortages, to form a team called "Card-Pitt." Longest championship drought of any NFL team.    Anything else you need to know?|`|xxtvhn5Naa	yup!|`|TjttzpPKaa	And your point is? They beat some very good teams to get there. Nothing was handed to them. They peaked at the right time. They deserve to be there.|`|5NF4sAPaaa	what about them?|`|5VKBBsA0aa	An NFL football team that will be playing in this year's Super Bowl on Sunday in Tampa Florida.|`|rzkFHAEJaa	yeah.|`|nRSjUKJZaa	Yes|`|LVjM9k8yaa	The Pittsburgh Steelers?    45-35  Enough Said!

(Even if they are all gay)  Anyways there is my answer,  xxx allison   ps: Jonas bros suck :)|`|iNXRK080aa	No offense but your are gay thinking about that yhypw of thing, also I'm not a big fan of the jonas but it's hard work to get where that are today. Also many girls want them.|`|5NF4sAPaaa	They probaby do.......its like the wind...I already know its there, just b/c I can't c it.|`|JnYFLsZcaa	oopsy! Someone set off the gay alarm!!!  :O|`|in8K5fJraa	Okay, so by "it" im assuming you mean having sex.    No, i don't think they do. Im not just saying this because of the fact that im huge fan, also because they come from a very, well structured family. I mean their dad used to be a priest or something, so their father wouldn't be allowing that to happen, its incest, and secondly, WHERE WOULD THEY FIND THE TIME!?  with all their tours and writing songs and their busy lifestyle.|`|f207af95c8df0fd00364fb3d4518fa7faa	Well, yes I do think that the Jonas Brothers play Scrabble with each other. That was a good question.|`|5VKBBsA0aa	I highly doubt it. Why would they? Every girl from the age of like 5 to young adult is throwing herself at them.|`|dtGInk4Faa	NO i don't think so.  some folks think they look gay but there alright (i hope).|`|q7ZMQeCMaa	OMG!!

La Liga: Osasuna, Espanyol, Numancia.  Seria A: Reggina, Torino, Lecce.
tvuhGTD9aa	There's lots of guys who hit only one dinger, but Duane Kuiper is probably the one you want, as he went deep only the one time with more modern era career plate appearances than anyone else.    He's a broadcaster now.    One-homer guys, top five by plate appearances    Davy Force (1871-86), 4407 PA  Duane Kuiper (1974-85), 3754  Bob "Death To Flying Things" Ferguson (1871-84), 3596  Emil Verban (1944-50), 3110  Johnny Bassler (1913-27), 2858    Kuiper's big moment: http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/...|`|fHxpycJSaa	There are probably a bunch who only hit one homer. One I know is Duane Kuiper who is an announcer for the Giants. He hit his only home run off of Steve Stone.|`|l0iCqzlQaa	how many did Jeff Frye hit?    yeah i knew he didnt have much, thanks.|`|yjwQG6tXaa	Duane Kuiper who hit his one and only HR with the Cleveland Indians. What a lack of power, over 3000AB and only 1 HR!     Anyway, hes the Giants broadcaster now|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	There are definitely at least 2 players that have hit only 1 career home run because Kuiper (as already mentioned) and Al Pardo both finished their career with 1 dinger.  Apparently, Pardo is the all-time home run leader for players born in Spain.    BOSTON:  Frye hit 16.|`|2wgEsVmsaa	Hoyt Wilhelm was one, just to segue into a trivia fact. It was his first at bat in the bigs, and he never hit another one.|`|tvy8qFKCaa	What a ridiculous question. There are HUNDREDS of players who only hit one home run in their career. You know of ONE, you need to preface the question with "who is the one player I know of..."

I turned to my friend Tony and told him (I was completely serious) "By the way, the Cardinals are going to the Super Bowl. Bank on it!"

PVpQ2GqPaa	Gymnastics is one of the hardest sports around: no offense even harder then cheer leading. I love gymnastics and cheer leading. But gymnastics is defiantly hardest. Well I'm a level 9 and we flip over bars and beams. We have to trust our coach very much and our team members to cheer us on. Also we practice 5-6 times a week up to 6-7 hours a day. Then we have competitions that last up to 5 hours. Also gymnast and cheerleaders end up with life long injuries. But once again over all gymnastics is harder.|`|23qMl5LXaa	Gymnastics, Cheerleading, Figure Skating, Lacrosse, Basketball, Football, and especially Track.

TNTFomKeaa	Ask your mom if you can get a salon wax for swimming. Some women shave this area but it grows back itchy and you can get razor bumps.  Waxing lasts for ages (like a month) and isn't that painful. I am a wuss about pain and I started waxing when I was 14 (23 now). The other advantage of waxing is that your hair grows back thinner.   Don't worry about it being embarrassing - if you're just getting the edges done so it won't show out of your bathing suit, you keep your underwear on during the wax. Then you won't have to think about it for a whole month.  Your mom will understand - every woman to ever wear a swimsuit has to deal with the same problem. I hope that helps.|`|PCsW0gbPaa	Yes, you can shave it all off.  Most women do, nowdays.  It might feel a little irritated, but that's just the reality of shaving.  Most people deal with it.|`|RXhP9B5Maa	i DO but sometimes the skin gets irritated and red shaving bumps occur and its not that attractive if u know what I mean|`|TlA1SmrLaa	you cant let it grow forever. Right now is the best time to start shaving. It may be uncomfortable to talk to your mom about it but she shaves too. You can cut it if you'd like and no, it wont get infected.|`|u0DClS0Taa	You could cut it, but shaving does make it very irritating. If you really want to, you could also cut most of it and then wax. Of course, it's pretty painful, but it's better than dealing with shaving.

NqzCxepGaa	sit down at home on ur bed lol and just toss the football up and cach bring it in secure it ,repeat try diffren ways of catching and pratice|`|MPDgKgIxaa	You need to catch the ball with your hands not your body, look at the ball until it is in your hands.      http://americanfootballtopics.blogspot.c...  http://americanfootballpredictions.blogs...  http://nflstadium.blogspot.com|`|69b4203311a371eab3d1c0ebf526270caa	Keep your eyes on the ball at all times.      * Extend your arms toward the ball,  so your hands meet it at the furthest possible point. Do not run with your arms extended because you'll probably look stupid. (:     * Make a triangle with both hands, palms facing away from your body. Thumbs pointing at each other, all other fingers pointing up. If the ball is below the waist, palms still face out.    * Watch the rotation of the ball. The rotation velocity affects your ability to catch it. The faster the spiral the harder you will have to grip it.     *Great receivers have the confidence that they will catch the ball. And if they don't - they believe they'll catch it the next time.     Practice, practice, practice. You can't master anything by reading it in a book (or on Y!A). Get out there and practice. (:|`|Io3VsAexaa	you may not think it, but you are afraid of the ball.  just practice|`|E8iM4gY5aa	well if it is a directly pass towards u it aint a problem to try to catch it with your body, but it will always be better to catch it with ur hands and once u have the ball secure it towards ur body, if it doesn't work, buy a pair of gloves, so u can get a better grip, also, don't have ur hands wide open when catching the ball, always try to have them semi closed, to get a better grip of the ball.|`|5VKBBsA0aa	Well, to be the best, you definitely do want to catch the ball with your hands. I'm sure you watch college or NFL games; think of how often you see those receivers use their hands! It is basically 95% of the time if not more.    However, it is tough when you are young and your hands just aren't that big. All in all, sometimes it is just a think where you need to keep practicing. The best way to get better at catching is to catch! Also, though, I think confidence is important. Have faith in yourself that you are a good receiver and WILL make the catch. If you doubt yourself you are only adding to the pressure.    Final idea...make sure to concentrate. Don't worry about what you're going to do after you catch the ball until you actually catch it. Look the ball all the way in and try to judge the rotation so you don't get any funny bounces.    Good luck!|`|Ebx1uTbUaa	Yes. catch with your fingertips and you should catch it a lot easier|`|tvUPseuwaa	make like a triangle with your hands and keep your hands soft dont try to squeeze it when it hits your hands or tense them up. itll sit in your hands for  second so you can pull it into your body. yea dont try to let it hit your body first and catch it thats not the way. biggest thing is just make like a nice soft pocket in between your hands for the ball to hit and sit in|`|d13ae9db5dc48ff6d163f13e94352d38aa	Catch the ball with your fingertips and then bring it into your chest.|`|ZLCKl5fuaa	You should try to catch with your hands not body.  Your hands should make a triangle, your palms not facing you.  You should catch the ball right between your hands(in the triangle).    Hope i helped  http://media.2theadvocate.com/images/biz...  Kinda like the picture but your index fingers don't have to be touching.

wf3S2avqaa	I've been to many WWE Monday Night Raws. I'm going to one in June at the Lafayette, LA Cajundome. I have pictures from other shows i attended. The show starts at 7pm. They have some less popular names wrestle first, they have a few women fights. The practice with us what to do before the show kicked off on tv. We practice and chants and the countdowns several times that hour. Sometimes wrestlers come out for a lil bit just to get the crowd pumped up and screaming and then they go back in the dressing room. They show footage on the Screens sometimes also. The ring is dead smack in the center. It's off the hook man. If you never been you will enjoy yourself to the fullest.|`|84yfLzM9aa	-I went to one of WCWs last shows. The crowd was DEAD!    -A WWE house show in Fredrick, MD. It was awesome. It was one of HBKs first shows back in 2002 with n.W.o. and it was one of Shelton Benjamins first matches|`|96cbb3400adf35a5d7f3196ddae61ff0aa	I have been to several events over the years, but none since 1999's royal rumble in Anaheim.  I started to hate the way the WWE put on a show and have not gone since.    I have gone to a few small promotions, but none worth mentioning.    My all time favorite was around wrestlemania 8 and I was in Las Vegas.  The show was at the Thomas and Mack Center and started a little before 5:30pm.  The show ended at 3:30am in the morning.  This was when they did 3 TV tapings (Saturday morning Superstars) and some for the USA Network.    It was awesome.    I have such wonderful memories from the old WWF shows  The wrestlers actually knew the crowd existed and they tried to interact with you.  Today, it is about the smut, lights, and Hollywood.  No more fun.  That is why I do not go anymore!|`|TBu2iaPaaa	nope never i watch it on tv|`|FJO5wqsvaa	its an amazing experience  i still remember mine, December 27th 2005 for a Smackdown taping, you go there around 7, and the show will start at the same time, and of course you see the wrestlers in the ring    its really fun, especially if the superstars sign autographs after the show    and pick yourself up a souvenir roster book, its about 15 bucks but its awesome|`|MYMpCrEYaa	i havent been there though i know what happens u came a 7:45 if its SD they show a dark match

Ucbnl7VJaa	Normally they are all very thinly plated steel balls. I've only seen copper and zinc plated but whichever plating metal has the lowest coefficient of friction in the material being shot is going to give you the deepest penetration. Mind you this is likely to be such a small difference at normal bb gun speeds as to make basically no difference. The exact weight of the BB will affect penetration far more if velocity is equal.
XGWDpV4Gaa	nike has a cool one.  look at it here and read about it.  my chick is a swimmer and has one    http://www.swimoutlet.com/product_p/4226...|`|f3b513a0133713ab68cfda8b8b712c06aa	well not exactly big, but absorbent would be to get a chamois. those things are great for using and reusing.
5573832243a1d5e3f002d23bed5be490aa	well if your new to softball and by you asking this question I am assuming you are! You just really need the basics; glove and cleats.     When the team is formed you will find out what else you really need but you will more than likely need knee socks. You will also want to get either sliding pants or a sliding pad. Other wise I would not recommend purchasing a bat unless you are positive you are going to stick with it. And even then purchasing a bat is your choice, the team will have balls and bats! Some schools/teams are starting to require you to purchase your own helmet with a face mask...but that is not for all, so you should definatly look into if you'll need one for your team. If you do need on I highly recomend either the ones that have a hole in the back for your ponytail to come out of or the ones with the channel in the back for extra room for your ponytail!    Oh and how could I forget the most important thing you need for softball; SUNFLOWER SEEDS!!! HAHA! The girl that I played with in high school were addicted to sun flower seeds we couldn't play without them. My senior year in tournaments we played 3 games on a Saturday and we ran out of seeds, I have never seen so many parents jump to run and get more seeds! It was pretty great! But any way you don't need sunflower seeds, it's just a must for me! HAHA      Good luck and have fun...I live for softball...it's a great sport!|`|36zm5zK8aa	bring a glove, a hat, water, you might need to bring a bat and some balls, wear sneakers if its inside, cleats outside, ask people on your team|`|s4VzPulYaa	There are a lot of items for the sport of softball, not all of them are necessary though.    Mitt (you will need this)  cleats (you will also need these)  batting gloves  sliding pad (so your knee doesn't get cut up, when you slide)  sliding shorts (so your upper thigh doesn't get cut up)  Under Armor   high socks  baggy t-shirts  shorts (not jean shorts, athletic shorts)  i always take extra ponytails just in case  it is also good to have eye black, or sunglasses.  and it always is good to have a high quality composite fastpitch bat   ^_^ hope i helped!|`|yzxDvRzUaa	cleats, softball glove, batting gloves, softballs, softball bat, baseball hat, long socks, comfortable athletic clothing and sunglasses
g5wninniaa	well if its indoor practice....bring a good pair of shoes...a glove...maybe a bat if u have one/need one(ask ur coach) and some comfortable clothes    if its outside, pretty much everything i said except bring cleats. still bring a glove, comfortable clothes and stuff.    and remember...bring confidence..never let urself down since its ur first year...u might never get out of it      GOOD LUCK!|`|PKn30Hqiaa	a bat|`|l1D3YaCoaa	You will need cleats and a glove for sure..and a bat but if you don't want to spend the money than maybe borrow someone's. And if you have a bat you will need a bat bag. High knee softball socks..and a helmet.

I fail to see how it's not golden.|`|dhs9QBMoaa	It doesn't matter where the new Commissioner comes from.  All the league needs is a Commish with a hockey background.  Bettman has had his ups and downs, and I guess he has succeeded since the league has a salary cap.  Still, he keeps fiddling with a game that needs no more fine tuning.  He simply doesn't know when to stop.|`|hX089rlnaa	Basically what LITY said. While I dislike Bettman personally (he is a bit of a worm) he is moving Hockey forward. The game is gaining momentum in the media and with new fans. The Winter Classic was a rousing success.

They could hire God as Commissioner and the goobers running the show will do what they always do to keep the NHL in 4th (soon to be 5th) place among the 5 major sports in North America.

I think hiring a Canadian as commissioner would be a step backwards fro the league because there is no money in Canada to make the league grow.      Wayne Gretzky told a room full of economists last fall that Winnipeg can't support an NHL team.  Just before Christmas, Mario Lemieux said that Canada is tapped out as far as the NHL is concerned and that all new growth will have to come from the US and beyond.    Two of the greatest players in the game's history.  I think they know what they are talking about.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	I'm curious as to who or whom is going to fire Bettman.

e937b00635efe3f3ae128aa4d3682db1aa	basically any kind of sport will affect your body. actually, it depends on what kind of running you are doing. if you are into cross country (long distance running) then your body will adjust to your work outs by becoming slightly slimmer so your body won't carry as much weight, and gaining "leaner" muscles. If you are going towards sprinting and shorter distances, your body will build up on bigger more bulky muscles, since sprinting is all on the muscle power. Running will affect every part of your body. your legs, thighs, glutes, and arms will get toned eventually, the time depends on how far you push yourself everyday. I suggest running no less than 3 days a week, alternate recovery days and work out days, and spend about 1-2 hours if not more, depending on your body and experience.|`|Y8AxM7c1aa	All I know is, it's super bad for your knees.

acWyJ3t0aa	To run faster you have to train . If you are training for the mile , then you have to get on a program where you run one lap at 2.5 minutes rest and do it again 3 more times .

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	Vince McMahon is a lot like P.T. Barnum and he does business in much the same way: "there's a sucker born every minute".  Barnum said that and Vince lives by it.    Like Barnum's circus and sideshow attractions, Vince will do anything (even to himself) to get people to watch his "circus".  He's more concerned with "shocking moments" and "spots" that get people talking (and buying his PPVs) than he is in creating and sustaining a high-quality and interesting TV show.  This is why people only talk about one or maybe two incidents that happen per week during his shows, and not the quality of the show itself.    Vince is, basically, the biggest "spot monkey" in the wrestling business.  Mickey Rourke at Wrestlemania is just another one of Vince's "spots".|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	Are you really surprised by this, Vince Mcmahon only cares about the money and Ive been wondering what stupid match was going to be at this years Wrestlemania.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	McMahon does anything for publicity and money|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	You answered your own question.

4maLlESdaa	I've only tried the Tempest 165 once and never tried the Sea Cruiser before, so I can't give you a definitive answer (not that I could anyway since it depends on what you like, not what I like). But looking at the specs and info, there are some similarities and differences:    The Tempest 165 is 16'6" long, 21.5" beam. The Cruiser is 17'3" x 22.8", a bit more volume than the Tempest. That doesn't mean one is better than the other. It more means that you're comparing apples and oranges. If you're doing a lot of multi-day trips, you might appreciate the Cruiser more. But the Tempest *might* be a better day boat.    As far as similarities, both boats appear to be heavily influenced by British designs: they both come standard with skegs and have the round rubber hatch covers (which are usually very watertight). The decks look fairly low, and the Tempest is somewhat narrow, while the Cruiser is only slightly narrower than North American designs. In addition, some argue that the Tempest is very heavily influenced by the Nigel Dennis Romany (which would be another boat worth checking out, especially since it's now available in plastic). And Point 65 claims Nigel Foster heads up their R&D department (but who knows how active he is; he's also helped design some boats for Seaward).    As far as durability, if you're looking at polyethylene, I'm thinking either would be fine. It'd be more a matter of design than construction. You can check out some reviews on paddling.net. But in the end, the best thing to do is to try out the boats yourself and see which you like better.|`|8Qm4duyeaa	Tempest 165 is better|`|BHNDGBs9aa	.

dcfVXO43aa	LINE or Armada|`|DD5Gsqx4aa	Actually, Line skis make the best models. The skis are super light, come in all different lengths and widths, and they are all twin tips for the freeskier. They have special features like carbon ollie bands and butter zones built into the ski so you can pop and do switch-ups on rails like its nothing. Check it out at www.lineskis.com/home  Check out the model Chronic if you like to go huge off 40 foot jumps and in the pipe.   Check out the Invader if you jib everything in sight.   Check out the Anthem for an all around awesome park ski.  Check out the Blend if you want to tear up other trails and the park too.|`|WBzoocIhaa	Line for sure|`|9Kt7p7Vfaa	Depends, Volkl skis tend to be stiff so if you are on the heavier side or really overpower softer skis, check out Volkl. Salomon skis are light and ski pretty nice. I have Line Chronics now that are great in the air but tend to have a soft flex at the worst times. Check out the various websites for specicfic models and see if the rental shops near you have any or if the resort near you is having a demo day. Everybody skis differently and therefore looks for different aspects when buying skis.|`|UZ8IcCwtaa	LINE, LINE, LINE!!!!!!!!!!!  Its the way to go with the butter zones. Plus they are fast and durable as hell.|`|FOtMIdGUaa	LINE for sure they have great butter zones and are 100% symetrical or the back curve is just as big and tall as the front (Makes riding switch the easiest thing to do)   if not line then my second would be salomons the suspect is a good ski|`|pGBTHEjtaa	ask.com|`|BwKCvvWgaa	i have armadas and they are great|`|oij6ZrxXaa	Lines or Solomens    I have a pair of Line Shawdows, their light weight and great for the park    Also I have a pair of Solomen Suspects which have a triple layer base and edge so their heavier set, great for mountain skiing, through powder and off the tabletops in the park
SZK670QTaa	I think that they will win the big games, but i also think they overlook the small games. I hope they win the ACC and got to the Final Four. I like the style of WF.

Wake is going to win it all.|`|4yiH5TiQaa	I'm so glad they beat duke! But I think UConn is the best.|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	they aren't the best team, but yeah, i'll put them in my final 4...|`|Xi6KGBG0aa	they are now gana be ranked higher because of the win against duke however Uconn will be at  1, they are currently ranked  2 and beating Depaul so they will be  1 next week      as for making a run march, definatly. they have a very good shot at the final four if not the finals.|`|onkUcy19aa	No. But I would pick them as one of the best 5.|`|wmGcAec0aa	THey may not be the best, but theyve got what it takes to go all of the way. So much depth in their bench. What other team has Ish Smith on their bencH? He had a great game tonight against duke. They may surprise some people in the tourny. FSU is beating UNC 64 64!
WiIUEObTaa	if ballet was a sport instead of a art form number one. master of martial arts . not the ones we see the ones we will never see. played pro sport. old guy. won rings. better athletes than players on floor ice field. best all around athletes with high injury risk. no doubt are cheerleaders. it is a simple fact. to those who enjoy mocking, disrespecting these great athletes. consider the fact. the last year you played a sport was when you were ten years old. stop the ignorance. admit the truth. you failed. cheer teams . succeeded. stop the disrespect. there is to much ignorance. water polo would be there but as a team players can and do cover other players errors. there is no room cheer for tiny error. high risk of injury. very good question|`|ZKikquiOaa	I'm surprised noone mentioned gymnastics yet.

It's got the same amount of running as lacrosse, and certain positions in football and basketball, and has plays set up like hockey (and bball as well.)  Water polo is so out of the norm in the sense that it combines odd "techniques" from various sports and combines them all into a sport played in the water.|`|65p86fMtaa	Football....you got weight lifting and running.

Cricket is very similar in summer the main difference being we all barrack for the Aussies but in football we have different type rivalry as we have different teams.|`|lTVS56Mgaa	maybe because its the sport only played in their country. its made to be loved like the americans love baseball.|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	Because it is such a great game. Why else. Best game in the world. Well footy and cricket are anyway.|`|kecdkv6jaa	because most of us were grown up watching and playing it.  besides why wouldn't you want to watch a group of buff guys ram in to each other for 80 minutes!|`|ZlFZtTlmaa	because if you don't get into it, you feel left out and it brings old and young, wise and even stupid people (collingwood supporters) together for something thats great. It's like a religion, its not just a sport its like a cult following. its more than a game.
4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	I thought it would be between HHH or Orton from the start.

AA11092188	As I said before:    THATS WHAT UP>    We had the homecourt swagger for sure.  I think nate the Great's energy was so explosive and infectious it would have been impossible for the rest of the team not to catch on.    What a game and what can other teams say about the Knicks now?  RESPECT- we have had such an intense turnaround for the second half of the season.    I hope we win at least one of the games during the Dream Week- the lakers game was so close last time we played it'd be sweet to finish it off, the cavs ate us alive, but maybe they'll be shocked at our home court style this time, and the celtics- hmmm we'll see- it was a super nice win last time....      GO NY!!!|`|VFMt6g2iaa	Knicks are on fire! =)|`|2dgVkcVAaa	Congrats bro    sucks 4 peaches tonight.|`|GBGcI509aa	I predicted they win in so many questions.|`|BIyJUmM9aa	Congrats  We broke down in the 3rd quarter  I miss AL more and more      Again Congrats    =]]|`|dDhTMacAaa	Mike D'Antioni's brilliance is being showcased once again.|`|NOYDj1lAaa	Whos cares...Knicks are soft. Miami slapped around the hawks a few nights ago, so dont make a big deal out of the win...|`|rEafx4QTaa	the knicks are so unpredictable i'll bet they lose to the thunder the next night and then beat the lakers. i love em and they're a good hard nosed team, but they gotta be more consistent|`|UMVWQiYJaa	I was pullin for the hawks but nate just tore it up in the 4th, what can you do|`|JsVZQkWyaa	it was a good game. david lee was on fire. he deserves to be a all star reserve. good job you guys. and you might make the playoffs so we hope to see you there. now we need to find wins and find a way to get al horford back. and i miss al to peaches.
95uXmC94aa	Who knows. There isn't a storyline for her yet. Just wait and watch :)|`|BAurzDXtaa	I highly doubt it she isn't even being used on television right now. I think that she is too injury prone to be a champion. If she ever wants to be a champion again she's going to have to train harder than she has ever trained in her life to improve her skills. She's not a bad wrestler but she isn't great.|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	Only Vince McMahon knows, and I don't think he is on Yahoo Answers|`|SOuezSW2aa	NOOO  she was the most boring womens champion ever and shes 30 i think she'll be gone in a year or two.|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	ya when she stops acting like a little slut and goes back to being a heel, which is what she's best at|`|w173betxaa	maybe this year but she sucks.|`|upIrlDm5aa	think she should stick to the playboy magazine, she was awesome in it haha|`|TBu2iaPaaa	the only people who know are the peoplwe who write the storylines and run the wwe|`|IMQm9JTMaa	i'm not too sure that it'll be anytime soon    she hasn't been wrestling that much lately, and she's just been in a couple backstage segments.    they're not just gonna randomly make her come on one day and win the title.|`|b5c261dfe3ee5e5442b8195afe51a0b9aa	yes it will come one day|`|TAPBWPJLaa	I doubt it.    Not only does Candice not have the following she once had, but she has gotten worse overall. Her wrestling ability is not there anymore (not like she had much before), and she's gotten somewhat out of shape in comparison to a year ago.|`|v4hFUpC5aa	yes. the  wwe has started a repeating trend that candice will soon b apart of. beth domanates as champ loses to underdog dominates 4 the title back and then it starts again. it will happen but she should go 2 smackdown Cuz shed fit in fine there|`|scIlBbaMaa	I don't know but "rumors' have it that shes going to turn heel soon
thcr8Y5vaa	Boxing...|`|wf3S2avqaa	I'm a big wrestling fan. I've become a more bigger fan since my best friend wrestles. I'm not a big fan of boxing but i do like it. Esp. Ali and Mike Tyson my two favorites. I'm going to answer some of the questions i see about them.|`|KmzjSnzVaa	Boxing|`|QKEYRzOiaa	Boxing, there's more stuff in it like punches, kicks, blocks, and it also has take downs and is kinda based on pressure.
5WttD4V5aa	Nah it hurts.|`|Z0IKiIJ4aa	finally! someone who shares the same views. That is one of the worst submission moves ever  and coming from such a legend. Hells gate is terrible|`|KIOR56r6aa	Yes, it is one of the most powerful submission maneuver in the history of WWE|`|w173betxaa	Yes it's powerful but its obvious that he fakes it because in real MMA people are smart enough to avoid the submission and if they do get trapped they tap immediately, they don't let Undertaker keep the hold on for over 30 seconds like Festus and Edge did.|`|5vXgcAbCaa	yeah, it looks downright weak to me. I don't think that submissions is the Undetakers thing. I like the tombstone, the chokeslam, and the last ride, but Hell's gate isn't that good. The bloody mouthes make it look better than it is.|`|AA10691319	the move itself is designed to hyperextend the shoulder and neck, but the scematics of the move are such that if it is misaplied it can crush the jugular and/or trechea which can leed to death|`|1UKAho1iaa	I don't like that move. It really doesn't make much sense. It's a shoulder lock that makes people bleed internally. I just don't get how that would work.|`|TAPBWPJLaa	He uses it for a couple of reasons:    -It's a submission hold that's easy to apply. That move is easier to do than the Tombstone Slam with all of his injuries stacking up against him.   -The Undertaker is a real life fan of Mixed Martial Arts. Ever since his American Bad *** days, he's been varying his moveset with MMA moves and holds here and there.  -The move he's doing (the Gogoplata) is really lethal. It attacks the windpipe, which is one reason most wrestlers have the "blood" coming out of their mouths when he applies it.|`|0mg4OBcMaa	Have you ever been put in a Hell's Gate?  The move basically chokes you out with the other persons legs.  Thats why it is effective.  It chokes you out.  Any person put in the move would believably tap out within a couple of seconds, and it is a legit MMA submission move.|`|FJO5wqsvaa	idk, i mean it looks like it hurts, but not powerful|`|AA10341097	the submission is a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu choke hold and has a more formal named called a Gogoplata when you choke your opponent with your instep or in Taker's case and many others, your shin.     It really is a choke because you're pulling down on the back of neck and head while shin or instep is choking.    used in MMA and like said before Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.|`|TBu2iaPaaa	it is powerfull and   he uses it because its affective|`|4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	It's a really powerful submission maneuver if you ever get into that kind of submission in real life it chokes you out by restricting the wind pipe which would make anyone tap within seconds. He uses it now i think to enlarge his move set with a submission and for the big guys he doesnt have any moves that can take them out and of course as the others said he's interested in MMA so he likes to use some of those moves.
hIOHfsGPaa	I hate to say it, but most of what you will need is expensive. Club volleyball is an option. It usually goes from November to May. Many clubs and some schools offer summer camps and sessions. The YWCA may offer training that is not as pricey as others. Good luck!|`|D6Ck3wcTaa	ok oh my goodness. practice. join club. try out for school. suck it up when it gets tough, it'll only help you. and always give 100%.|`|K87vKkA8aa	PRACTICE i've only played 2 years started when i was 11 and i was 4th in Canada last year after one year of playing  you know why? practice. we practiced 8 hours a week. You should practice serving and passing cause if you can do that you will get TONS of playing time|`|V68UttIMaa	All you need to do is to practise. Thats the key, no secrets, no magic pills. In volleyball body size really matters, but its not only this. So even if you are not tall enough, dont give up and keep practise. I was  playing for 10 years :)|`|zpRR5KIdaa	by practicing...|`|ArtR1MCvaa	Practice is the best thing to do. I started playing volleyball in grade 6 (5 years ago - yes im in grade 11), and at first i wasn't all that great at it. But it was that year that i realized volleyball was cool and i wanted to continue playing it. So every single year since then i've played volleyball on my schools team, and i am like a million times better than what i started off as in grade 6 :D

ZQ0C6xgnaa	Hi! I am a gymnast who wanted to do cheerleading and when tryouts were held a few months ago I made the team! So I'll give you my tips:  1) Practice jumps! Being flexible will definently help! Some jumps you might want to do are toe-touch, pike, front hurdler, and herkie. (If you don't know what these are search them on youtube that's what I did!)  2) Tumbling! This is not usually required but will definently help a lot!!! I think thats the reason I made it! Back-handsprings are great! Round-offs, walkovers, front hansprings, round-off backhandsprings.  3) SMILE !! The word says it all! This is the most important part! Show a lot of peppy spirit!  4) Try to be as loud as possible! Depending on how loud or quiet you are this could be hard. I'm quiet so this was sort of difficult but not I am used to it.  Hope I heled and Good Luck!|`|LGik99VIaa	make them focus on your tumbling and being attractive never hurt nad  eing abole to yell|`|oUNST2Zgaa	3 good jumps    a tumbling pass    how to spirit in    a good quality cheer|`|ZtP0dobmaa	short skirts and a nice butt, the ability to yell READY, OK!!! would be good for you too. :P|`|3c3a6998da4c577a09bc2789d0d7787caa	It depends on what your school requires..what jumps? what tumbling skills? do you guys stunt? If I were you I would talk to a girl who has been on the cheer team in the past or who is bound to make it this time around. Ask her what you need to be able to do? You have 7weeks...that really is plenty of time. Work on jumps everyday (toe-touch, double toe-touch, r/l hurkey, front hurdler, pike)...any tumbling you can do will definitely score you some points! standing bhs is almost always required but if you have more than that definitely show it off. Facials are everything! Make sure you are smiling and when you are performing your dance do cheer facials (wink, o face, big smile, smirk, etc...) be nice, positive, and even if you are not the best show you are willing to learn. When learning the material stand in the front..it will show you are eager to learn and it will get you noticed. Have fun and good luck!|`|vtR5277laa	first of all start getting into shape- just like 3 laps on the track a  day, practice your jumps, stretch alot, and learn a couple of cheers so you will have a feel for it before you get there, and practice having sharp motions.

9rhmeb7raa	Yes indeed it is worth something. If you can't find a buyer who is offering a price you are comfortable with, or you don't need the money, you might consider donating it to the Brooklyn Baseball Gallery which is co-located with Keyspan Park in Brooklyn, the home field of the Brooklyn Cyclones of the New  York-Penn League.|`|upmPW2phaa	That is worth some serious cash. if it were me though, id keep them. Memories and things like that should be kept. Unless its of no value to you then save it a little longer. As the years go on, it'll get more valuable.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	It has to be worth a lot of cash !

Hook'em!!!|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	what are u a euro?|`|D6yvUKm3aa	it is who wins in each division in the AFC and NFC. (+1 Wild Card winner)  Then they have 2 or 3 playoff games to win before you make it to the SuperBowl.    P.S. Steelers are in AFC (North) and Cardinals are in NFC (West).|`|exOOXAkBaa	It's like a tournament. You get in the playoffs, and whoever wins , moves on.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	They don't. They are, however, playing in the Super Bowl. Proper noun, two words.    The NFL has two conferences. In each conference are four divisions. The division winners automatically qualify for the playoffs, and two more teams from each conference -- the ones with the best records that didn't win their division -- make it in as wild card berths.    The division winners are seeded 1 through 4, based on record. The top two seeds get a bye -- meaning they skip the first round of the playoffs. In the first week of the playoffs, the  6 wild card plays the  3 division winner, and the  5 wild card plays the  4 division winner.     In the second round of the playoffs, the lowest remaining seed from the first round plays the  1 seed, and the other first-round winner plays the  2 seed.    Then come the conference championships, played between the two remaining teams in each conference.    The conference champions then play each other in the Super Bowl.|`|kXZtPZFjaa	Winners of AFC-Steelers and NFC-Cardinals Championships face each other @ Super Bowl|`|X6Di5elQaa	because they won|`|PCsW0gbPaa	There is a playoff system.  There are 32 teams in the NFL.    They are divided into two conferences.  The champion from each conference plays in the Superbowl.  Each conference has four divisions.  The team with the most wins in each division goes to the playoffs.  So do two other teams in each conference.  Those are the teams with the most wins, besides the division champions.  Those are called "Wild Cards"  The two division champions in each conference that have the most wins get to rest for the first round of the playoffs, while the other two division champions play the wild card teams.  The winner of that game plays the teams with the most wins in the second round.    The winners of that round play for the conference championship.|`|efonvqTmaa	They both made it to the playoffs and they beat all the teams they faced in the playoffs to get to this point which is the SB.
OxS3UVE6aa	Marbury would play for veterans minimum in Boston    Earlier this month, Stephon Marbury expressed interest in joining the Boston Celtics. Now, Marbury is saying the Celtics have made a verbal commitment to him.    Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge declined comment on Marbury specifically yesterday, but had said that because of luxury tax concerns, any free agent interested in coming to the team would receive the veteran's minimum. The Globe reported in December that the team would have interest in the point guard's services if he were available on the open market.    But Marbury's availability depends on him settling his contract situation with the Knicks, and a league source close to the situation said it would be surprising if the Knicks bought him out. And if Marbury does reach a settlement, he still could receive a better financial offer and a starting role elsewhere, instead of backing up Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo.|`|Uyup7lBDaa	He finally got called back to the mothership. They're still waiting on Curry.|`|AA11305672	He live in LA now and he come to watch the Lakers play all the times. He is technically still on the Knicks, but he doesn't play or practice.

I played with an attackman in high school who was 6'2", 230 and he was too big and strong for defensemen to handle.  Scored lots of goals.    You need to to focus on both running and stick skills.  You can't play lacrosse if you're not in good shape and you can't play of you can't catch and throw.    I coach lots of new players (no experience) and they end up doing fine.  It just takes some time to get a feel for the game.  Just remember to hustle all the time in those tryouts.|`|12f639e58f0b59cee3198f2b1e8cbdc5aa	yeah work on your stick skills and do some wall ball    run and lift to lose weight and get lean.

Granted that alot of my wieght is muscle and i'm pretty thick. I play defense which is a little less running then attack but to be honest you really got to be in shape to play any position. My suggestion is to play and have fun and try to slim down a little bit in the process. When I started playing I was really really big and had no muscle and now I have alot of muscle definition and I play college. If you put your mind to it you can acheive it

Most people would probably go with RB, since they get to carry the ball, catch the ball, and directly help the offense. Some, however, would say line backer since they enjoy tackling other people and hitting hard. Yet others, may say lineman since they enjoy blocking!    It is basically a personal preference! In the end, though, a majority people would like to play a position in which they get to directly impact the game such as receiver, running back, or QB.|`|679b6c2e3d98d5af9b9c37cd3490d71daa	i was a running back and a tight end i liked it i would have tried out for quarter back but they was to obsessed with my running SPEED|`|Ebx1uTbUaa	I'm a running back and I really enjoyed it last season. i would pick that one unless your more into defense.|`|F9WyYPYlaa	Depends on your current size and your future size.  Speed, weight, agility, and so much more.  Just focus on the skills your good and and go from there.|`|Io3VsAexaa	i played runningback and safety/corner but i always thought the funnest position was defensive end|`|2d0efaa23f2174aef8fbc90163b24fffaa	it all depends what you are good at  if you are fast and strong in the legs rb or de  if you are huge o-line  if you are medium lb|`|Kr9A1hryaa	i would say defensive end because then when you get into the pocket you can destroy the QB and its just fun with the routes like if the half backs running ur way u can take him out|`|ZLCKl5fuaa	Running Back or Linebacker  Depends on what you like...    If you like hitting people then linebacker. If you like running and juking and stuff then running back.

ROWbHIqTaa	sure you can, its painful not harmful as long as you dont shoot at the head.  350-400 fps is normal for a good airsoft.  dont worry you wont seriously hurt anyone it will just sting a bit.  and what the person said above about it wont hurt at all after 50 feet, thats a lie. check out scoutthedoggie on youtube.com many great vids|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Nope. But it won't cause permanent damage. Now don't ask airsoft questions in hunting.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	shoot someone like me with it you'll have more to worry about than fps.  they really should have a section for air/paint guns.|`|dfBwVxXFaa	wrong section again!!  apparently you air softers can't read either.  This is the hunting section!|`|nooi0ldjaa	painful? maybe a little.  harmful? only if you shoot someone in the eye or rear end.    btw, this is HUNTING...your not hunting wit that toy are you?|`|TvARYVRJaa	well shoot each other  and scale it on a 1-10 index,,,, and get back  asap   ok thanks|`|21bef845536547868b0d688917f58277aa	Sound like murder to me.|`|lmJlABpZaa	use plastic bb's and wear ski goggles... just wear layers if necessary.|`|aWPfvwilaa	You guys point real guns at each other? That is odd|`|kMZMFaeHaa	If your going to be "sniping", from like a hundred feet away, i doubt it will seriously hurt anybody. Airsoft bb's typically lose over half their velocity after about 50 feet, which makes it funny why they advertise "400fps" when the gun can't even shoot that far..400 fps being the muzzle velocity, or the speed of the bb the instant it leaves the barrel. So it won't hurt anybody unless you shoot them point blank.  Yeah it'll sting, but your friends will get over it..    just remember to wear eye protection|`|UmobeP5Saa	it will be painful and some people might refuse to play with you. just dont shoot people point blank. use a sidearm of some kind for close range shooting. the m-16's shot speed varies but i have one that shoots at 375 fps and it doesnt really hurt all that bad except from close range|`|e674db559351530f01932d3a880224a4aa	I've been hit with Airsoft BBs from pistols, AEG rifles, and spring-powered sniper rifles.  With the exception of very close ranges, it stings a bit, yeah, but nothing permanent, not even anything long lasting.  The M16 and G36 rifles we use all run around 400 FPS, the sniper rifles run around 450.  I love battles, and recommend you get into it, if you can find a group to play with.
Y4mz8BShaa	Who makes the AR-15 variants? A decent MPEG shoots about 350 stock.    If they can't deal with 400 with a .20, why are they playing? They won't get hurt, aside from a welt (If they're wearing goggles like they should.), and it'll be from a good distance away while they're wearing clothes. They'll be fine.    A sniper rifle is not meant for heavy combat, The sniper position is build around gathering intelligence, and if you like to be in the middle of it, a bolt action is going to be useless. Too large, manually chambered rounds.|`|kUJtfmDaaa	I would just go for the real thing and play survival of the fittest.  Hope you win man!|`|JRZAdToZaa	dont listen to the retard that says airsoft guns dont hurt. he's either made of steel, too dumb to know what pain is, or just too cheap to buy a decent arisoft gun. or maybe he's never played at all. anyway, yeah it'll hurt but 400 with a .2 is nothing compared to what it can be. imagine getting lit up at 20 rps with .25s at 600 fps. that'll hurt, but even that won't break the skin unless you're really close. btw listen to that dmitri guy, he knows what he's talking about. give him the best answer. he deserves it.|`|AA10056762	1. If you are focused on shooting people with an airsoft sniper rifle...sniping is not for you.  2. If you plan on using .2g bb's in a sniper rifle...well I will just be nice and say you will never ever ever do that.    My gun shoots hard. It will hurt up close. I am around 440FPS with a .29g bb. But really its about accuracy and range in sniper rifles. I find it enjoyable to be 200+ ft from my target and waiting 20 minutes for that perfect shot. You frankly don't sound like the waiting kind of guy. I suggest you look into AEG's my friend.|`|b1yx4e8Eaa	I got shot with a 600 fps gas gun (I think they measured it with .12s) and the bbs were .28s . It was from maybe 10 yards away and in the head.    My UTG MK96 hurts a lot too.     i don't think that a 400 fps sniper could break skin with a .2 g bb|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Nope. Airsoft guns don't hurt. If you guys wanted to have a real experience you'd use simunitions or bean bag rounds.

Definitions    Those Player rights expressly set forth in the Basic Agreement for which a Players eligibility is dependent upon credited Major League service will be determined as follows:    (1) One full day of Major League service will be credited for each day of the championship season a Player is on a Major League Clubs Active List. A total of 172 days of Major League credited service will constitute one full year of credited service. A Player may not be credited with more than one year of credited service, 172 days, in one championship season. Major League service will be computed commencing with the date of the first regularly scheduled championship season game, through and including the date of the last regularly scheduled championship season game.

xPCKePufaa	I can empathize with the whole match-play thing. I can play pretty well in practice, but once it gets to a real match... everything goes tight, I only hit about half the pace I do in practice, and errors just keep increasing. It can be really frustrating.    In the way of your ankle... As another said, if it swells or gets to bothering you too much, take a break. Its not worth making it worse. Its always tough to quantify things like that, but if it gets worse, you can review the situation then. Hopefully it just gets better, and skips the getting worse bit.    If you can stick it out, I would really suggest staying in this session of tryouts. You don't have anything to lose (as long as you keep watch of your ankle), and there is a possibility that you won't get cut. Also, don't blame it on yourself. Really. Tennis is a tough sport, and it takes a really long time to get good, or even decent. The nerves will go away in matches (after a year of competitive play, they're finally starting to go away for me), and you'll get better in that respect.    I hope your ankle gets better, and I hope it all goes well!|`|ToZer2Adaa	One of my tennis instructors told me tennis is 90% mental (maybe it wasnt that high of a percentage, but it was up there.) You probably aren't confident enough. Watch the Aussie Open and look at the pro's. You will learn techniques that they do. Look at their body language; almost every player has a positive body language, even when they're losing. Don't get down on yourself if you lose the point, you can win the next one. Keep trying, do some rafa fist pumps to get you motivated. Intimidate your opponent, and act like you are the better player (don't be too arrogant.) Be assertive and always say the score, they'll know who's boss ; )  Good luck.|`|iyDXt5d9aa	I agree! Don't give up. Just stick to it. I know how ya feel. I've been doin lessons too (expensive!) and I'm nervous, but I've improved so much. Matchplay is the hardest past of tennis...of any sport really! Just warm up before and try to focus when you play. Don't let emotions get to ya when youre on the court either. Ya can do it!|`|aEmT36XOaa	Depending on how long the tryouts are, you should try your best to stick in there. The coaches will appreciate the fact that you are not a quitter. Try your best not to draw attention to your ankle, even if it does hurt while you are playing because many coaches can take this as purely psychological. Many athletes complain of physical symptoms when they are not winning or doing really well.     If your ankle does start to swell though, you should definitely stop. This is not a good sign and you should go see your doctor.     You might as well stick out tryouts though so you can get feedback from the coaches and learn what to do better next time. This will help your motivation in the off season.|`|z3KqGlm8aa	I LUV TWILIGHT|`|Nn9t3DyYaa	I say don't give up and stop beating yourself up about it continue with tryouts and if u get cut hopefully you wont but you can say that you still tried and u can count it as experience and you'll get better with time especially if you're gonna be attending tennis camp however i hope your ankle gets better you should have it checked out or get yourself an ace bandage to wrap it or try ice packs or maybe heat therapy to ease the pain i hope everything goes well and you make the right decision about this i am cheering for you =) so dont give up give it a good try and have fun tennis is fun

n2O0NwR6aa	Well, quitting in the middle of a season is definitely a bad thing.  People see that as being a big baby - selfish, whiny, and only thinking of yourself.  And if you quit, you'll be letting down your team.  Yes, even if you're the worst player or rarely get out on the court, your team needs you.  Your presence at practice and inter-squad scrimmages helps the whole team to improve.  Your encouragement and support keeps your teammates motivated.  Your continued effort to try and improve inspires the other players to do so themselves.  And when you do get some playing time, it's because your team needs you there.  Every player on a team is important and has something to offer.    If you really hate it, just don't do it next year.  But stick out the season.|`|99amr13kaa	i think of them as quitters. but it depends on what the people on your team are like and how much they really care about you.|`|NCvX4I0baa	Well if it's because of personal family issues than that's another story but other than that I think the person lacks determination & motivation. There are circumstances where the team falls apart & becomes less organized.     A real athlete has more than skills & strength, they have to have determination and put their heart into the team even when the rest of the team walks out.  If you're not having fun than you probably haven't put an effort into being with your teammates & spending time.|`|a0da3e586ab84fa0f4d47aca26b554c5aa	its depends on how old you are, and how much tome you spend on it.  i dont think there is anything wrong with quitting if something is going nowhere, and you're not enjoying it.  i was  6 on my basketball team in eighth grade, but didnt start most games, got offered a spot on varsity cuz of my height, but i decided to go out for track instead because basketball just wasnt fun anymore.  so idk  its really subjective|`|6N1hy4SQaa	Don't quit. I think when people quit it says a lot about character.  Just because someone doesn't get a lot of playing time, and decides to quit, comes off as a person who is unwilling to work harder than anyone else.  You have to earn a playing spot, and if you really wanted to play bad enough you would work really hard. Plus, you tried out for the team and made it. You now have a commitment to that team. Just because you don't play or maybe aren't having fun, you are still a part of that team and bring something to the table.  Don't let your teammates down. Quitting is the easiest thing you can do, but actually having to work for something is way harder.  My suggestion... don't quit.

Some people are bothered by the swim suits that go to your ankles when they are swimming breast stroke because they are tight and don't always allow you to do your kick the way you normally do. If this is the case with you, I would suggest getting a kneeskin or speedo type suit. If the legskin suits don't bother you when you are swimming breast stroke, and the LZR is in your price range, totally. Go for it.|`|f3b513a0133713ab68cfda8b8b712c06aa	i wouldnt get a full legskin. do you plan on swimming for  along time? because then i would invest in the lzr. however, if you specialty is stroke stuff like im and breast i would go with like something to your knees. legskin for breaststroke can be restrictive. movement can be lessened. i have a fastskin II, which i love, and it is a neck to knee.

yjwQG6tXaa	Im not being biased here, but Corey Maggette would get my vote. Ever since the Warriors had him come off of the bench he's been averagin 20points, 10 rebounds a game. And he gets like 25 min off the bench. I dont know if he can keep it up, but he has been a great 6th man for teh Warriors|`|rTbKXMMpaa	I agree. His production off the bench is great for the mavs. They could have easily thrown him in the starting five but they had no offense off the bencg. terry assures you a good 20 points off the bench.

eDCyle05aa	I would not take over the counter medicine, because it covers up one problem and causes another, but anyway, you should just stretch really good before and after you run. Stretching before and after you go to bed would be a good idea too. You just need to go on long runs to get a good base. I run track in college and when i do long runs i usually run for 45 minutes. I'm not sure how much you usually run, but do however long you think is confortable. You should do this 3-5 days a week. You should be in decent shape after 2-3 weeks. After you get a good base, you should do some speed work because thats how you really improve your times. 50-80 meter hill charges work great if you have any hills around your house. You should do 8-10 of these. If there are no hills doing it on flat would help, but not as much. If you do it on flat, go 100-200 meters. If you do speed work, run as fast as you can through the whole 50-80 or 100-200 meters.

kH4LeoAAaa	Muay Boran (Thai: ????????), which translates to "Ancient Boxing", is the term Thai people called their fighting art and competition during the fists binding or "Kaard Chuerg"(????????) era ,to differentiate it from the modern rules Muay Thai. Eventually, regional styles of Muay Boran were developed such as Muay Thasao (North), Muay Korat (Eastern or North-East), Muay Lopburi (Central) and Muay Chaiya (South). There is the phrase "Punch Korat, Wit Lopburi, Posture Chaiya, Faster Thasao" (????????????? ?????????? ????????? ??????????????).    The practice of Muay Boran was kept up largely by Buddhist monks who were the keepers and teachers of all arts both practical and spiritual. Temples began holding fights during festive occasions. As every Thai man is expected to live as a monk at least once in his life the art grew in popularity among common people, so much so that it was said that any man worth his salt would practice it.  Knee strike    Muay Boran's form is quite efficient, in that it maximizes the amount of damage that each blow can inflict, and effective, in that it can easily lead to the death or serious injury of the opponent. Most notably, Muay Boran emphasizes the use of extremely powerful elbow and knee techniques, and combinations thereof, always thrown at full force and speed, with the intent to overcome one's adversary as quickly as possible, because another one might already be coming close or attacking. Muay Boran has been influenced my neighboring martial arts and vice versa such as the Kamae Kham Sao which is a technique borrowed from Cambodia. [1]    Traditionally, Muay Thai masters would teach the techniques of Muay Boran as advanced Muay Thai but this is not often done today. Various moves in Muay Boran are forbidden in present-day Muay Thai tournaments and competitions. Even in Thailand it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a school willing to teach it; they prefer to focus on "modern" Muay Thai, as this is more easily exploitable as a form of income. Many schools nowadays who claim to offer Muay Boran just teach Muay Thai and sell it under the name of Muay Boran.    Muay Boran was previously not well-known in the West outside a small circle of practitioners. The art was featured in the 2003 Thai film Ong Bak starring Tony Jaa.        Lethwei (burma : ) or Lethawae (Read as "Let-whae", but quickly) ; also known as Burmese Boxing and Myanmar Traditional Boxing, is a form of kickboxing which originated in Burma (Myanmar). Lethwei is in many ways similar to its siblings from neighboring Southeast Asian countries such as Tomoi from Malaysia, Pradal Serey from Cambodia, Muay Lao from Laos and Muay Thai from Thailand.Lethwei is similar in concept, but radically different from Muay Thai due to the allowance of head-butts. In comparison, Lethwei can be interpreted as being bolder and more extreme. The techniques are a bit slower and stronger than in the other Southeast Asian kickboxing forms, possibly because it has more Indian influence than the other styles. There are records recording Lethwei style matches dating back to the Pyu empire in Burma. Ancient Burma armies successfully used Lethwei, Bando and its armed sibling Banshay in winning many wars against neighboring countries.    Spinning Elbow       Down Roundhouse Kick       Knee and elbow       Knee and punch      It should be noted that the modern style of Myanma Traditional Boxing greatly resembles Muay Thai in its sporting outlook, and not the rough and tumble fighting of its rural roots.    In many traditional and rural fights, members from the audience are welcomed onto the ring to fight with the professional boxers. Sometimes, fighters among the audience successfully knock out the boxers in the ring.    Many of the ethnic groups within Burma have their own variant of the indigenous martial arts giving them different styles of Lethwei that make for exciting action.    The Kachin variant of Lethwei is referred to as soft (relaxed). There is very little wasted motion or effort. Lethwei matches usually start in long range with kicks to the legs and raking punches to the face in an effort to draw blood. As the match continues, the fighters often end up in a clinch and the primary techniques used are standing grappling coupled with various takedowns and sweeps. The preferred finishing techniques are head butts, elbows, and knees. The Kachin Practitioner generally prefers to fight from the clinch and tends not to fall after missing with a long distance strike, opting instead to follow low line kicks and raking punches into close range.    If the sport is viewed in the context of preparing an athlete for combat you can see that it not only teaches timing, distance, and movement but also the ability to absorb and deliver punishment, thereby winning a war of attrition. The goal is not so much the winning and losing but fighting hard and learning lessons about survival.|`|gBO908P6aa	dang Swede...mondo cutting and pasting.    Anyways, nothing more to add except that Lethwei ("boxing" in Burmese) is sometimes called "Muay Pama" by the Thais.  Many would argue that these two dominant "muay" styles were once one and the same.  It was believed that during the Pre-Sukhothai and Sukhothai Era of Siam, the art of "muay" spread throughout much of Indochina as a combat skill, esp for the military in the battlefield.  Burma and Siam used to beat the living daylights out of one another back during around the 15-17th centuries.  Lots of skirmishes and major border conflicts including tournaments provided ample opportunities for cross-cultural assimilations and development of muay.  In the 1763 King Bayinnaung sacked Ayutthaya, the ancient capital of Siam, destroying the capital by 1767 and thus establishing the second Burmese empire.  Many famous names were found during the Ayutthaya period, names like King Prachao Suer aka the Tiger King who would dress as a peasant and compete in tournaments to test his skills and the very famous Nai Khanom Tom aka the Father of Muay Thai who was captured during the fall of Ayutthaya and brought back as a slave.  During an exhibition tournament in 1774, the Burmese King Mangra wanted to see who had the better style of muay.      The primary difference at the time was the Burmese boxed with fists and wore ankle length sarongs which hindered their leg movements while the Thais used every part of their body, hands bound in kaad chuek and a wearing simple wrap known as a paanung.  Nai Khanom Tom pummelled all ten Burmese opponents with ease and impressed the King so much he was soon released.  In his honor, his statue was erected at Ayutthaya and to commemorate his incredible feat the 17th of March is designated as Boxer's Day or Muay Thai Day.

vlISWIOSaa	Hello Josh!    I do not know if your Savage is a Model 99 variant or a bolt gun, but either way, Savage's are high quality rifles ... you do not want to risk damaging the barrel with cheap, potentially corrosive surplus ammo. It is better to get quality ammo and pay a few bucks extra ... your rifle deserves that! If you look at getting either Remington, Winchester, Western, or Peters ammo, you are making a good purchase. If you can find Hornady or Black Hills, they are also quality brands ... but if I were you, I would not seek out surplus military ammo! Ammo with 150 grain bullets is a wise move ... for any game you might hunt in NEPA, the 150s will serve you well! Twelve dollars a box is not a bad price ... actually, with the economy and market conditions, $20 a box would be a fair price for quality ammo.     Good luck and good shooting!|`|YrxLbfiIaa	If you want cheap then surely consider purchasing it in bulk.......    http://www.jgsales.com/index.php/ammo-fo...    Consider the Silver Bear stuff..... No its not the greatest but you can surely get a lot of target practice time in on the cheap......    Also look over.....    http://www.the-armory.com/shopsite_sc/st...    If you like the .308 cartridge be sure to look over this .308 guide.....    http://www.6mmbr.com/308Win.html|`|xOReEw6Waa	Use the 150 grains for practice because you can never shoot enough, and it's fun anyway. $12 a box is dirt cheap these days, buy a bunch, unless you plan on reloading. If you are getting good groups with the 150s there is no reason to change bullet weights, just make sure your hunting bullets are a decent BONDED bullet for best penetration. If the 150s don't group well then go up to 165s for both practice and hunting bullets. Most guns aren't as finicky on bullet manufacturer as they are on weight and powder used. So, practice with the cheaps and make sure the hunting loads stay close or make a small adjustment if needed.|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	Don't skimp if you are hunting. Winchester is as cheap as it gets while still being a quality round: relatively clean, good brass, good bullets, and very accurate.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	$12 for 20 is about the best you'll do for commercial ammo.  Try Sportsmansguide.com or Cheaperthandirt.com for cheap   surplus berdan primed military ammo for target practice.  150 gr. @ 2800 FPS are about the standard military weight and velocity.  Use only commercial soft points for hunting though.  Military solids are not appropriate.  The 150 gr. loads will have the same velocity and ballistics.  What range do you go to around there in Penn. ?|`|EDc2Ipe6aa	Look in Sportsmans Guide they have Berdan primed brass cased FMJ 146 Gr .308 (7.62x51 nato) for $ 289.97 for 500 rds with ammo box. These are non- reloadable (Berdan Primed). Good for practice though.Can't use them for hunting in PA.  because they are non-expanding full metal jacket.|`|dfBwVxXFaa	$12 a box, that is cheap.. Try and price some for a 7mm mag at $40 a box of 20.  Not something to go shooting cans with.|`|GcOWoAmSaa	Get a reloading set up and make your own ammo. It will cost you to start with, but soon it will pay for itself and you will save money and also get better ammo.    I have 6 rifles that shoot the  .308. My all time favorite bullet for them is the Hornady 150 grain soft point boat tail. I've killed about 20 deer with it here in Virginia.|`|UrNVuFx6aa	For cheap ammo try cheaperthandirt.com. They usually have some full metal jacket rounds available that don't cost too much. Don't use the fmj rounds for hunting; most places they are illegal for such purposes. Once you find the best-shooting weight in your rifle try to find the same weight in hunting loads. The closer they are to your practice rounds the more accurate you will be. If you have to make adjustments to your sights/scope I would recommend setting the zero using the load you will be hunting with. A miss on paper is not nearly as bad as a botched kill. And don't skimp on the practice. Remember to practice firearm safety as well, for yourself and those around you.

Mqurv3LXaa	During the year many MLB teams will travel to the greater north to see possible prospects.  We mainly go for players in your age group, however those who are older can still go to these "screenings".  I know the Rockies will send a few scouts to the Vancouver area in mid May.|`|69b4203311a371eab3d1c0ebf526270caa	The first thing a scout looks for is a good arm. One game under a radar gun will tell if the pitcher has the arm strength to be a major league prospect. There are two basic models of radar guns used to clock the speed of fastballs. The Stalker Gun will pick up the speed of the fastball after it has traveled 2 feet. A fastball will lose 8 mph from the time it leaves the pitchers hand to the time it crosses home plate. The average major league fastball is 89-90 mph on a Stalker Gun. Scouts will rarely sign a pitcher who does not throw at least 89 mph on the Stalker Gun.       Two more big things they look for:    Control- The ability to throw strikes on a consistent basis is vital for any pitcher to have success at the major league level. If the pitcher has less than overpowering stuff his control becomes even more important to his success.    Delivery- A pitchers delivery should be as smooth as possible. It should look effort-less with no mechanical problems like: throwing across the body, landing on a stiff front leg, overstriding, etc.    Good luck! (:|`|tvy8qFKCaa	LOL, right on schedule, it's been a couple hours since we had some kid come in here with some bull about how fast they throw. And why do you need Canadian scouts to see you? What's wrong with American scouts? And if your 16, why do you need scouts to see you? No scout in the world would risk his job to see a 16 year old American. Especially one that only throws around 66, which is what you throw.    Hope this helps.|`|AlZPIAtmaa	Wait for the thaw.

Anyway, regardless if he's in the game or not, as Normen mentioned, Taylor is not well recognized by casual fans, especially the much younger ones.     Personally, I think the cover should just feature Ali and Tyson in a stare down.
jWVZ9gFFaa	WOW. This is terrible for you. Are you serious? You're dehydrating your body - all you're losing is water weight, not any fat. Extreme dehydration is very dangerous and can lead to kidney failure, coma, shock, and heart problems. If you want to lose weight start exercising and eating healthy and in moderation. Please stop doing this to yourself! Also steam rooms should only be used as therapy/relaxation, not as a way to lose weight.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	You're not losing any more weight doing this than if you were running in place at room temperature, or in arctic cold.  The only pounds you're sweating away are water, which is dangerous.  And as soon as you drink again, the water will come back.  In the long run, this could hurt you if you're not fully rehydrating after these sessions.  Additionally, you're wasting hot water and electricity.    Weight loss is simple:  you take in calories, you use calories.  If you use more calories than you're taking in, your body has to burn stored calories (fat) to provide energy.  This is done by dieting (taking in less calories) or by exercise (burning more calories).    Rather than what you're doing, go out and run somewhere.  Its free to run in your neighborhood (no gym membership required!), and all you need are clothes.  In addition, you can do pushups, situps, and standing squats, right in your living room, to help build lean muscle to burn calories.|`|OHs8yJiOaa	To lose weight, you need to burn off more calories than you consume. For it to be sustainable, you can't play games with starving yourself so that your metabolism goes out of whack. You generally need to go onto a reasonably healthy diet that doesn't include "junk" calories, and you need to exercise on a regular basis -- this can include even just regularly walking, however.    All you're doing in your bathroom is sweating water out of your body temporarily. Your scale may say you've lost weight, but it's ultimately water you need and that you'll gain back once you're properly hydrated again.    You're probably not doing anything much beyond wasting (hot) water and your time, and you may be doing harm to yourself.    You'd be better off eating a reasonably portioned healthy meal, maybe some salmon or tuna and rice, and going for a long walk of at least 30-60 minutes if you can.|`|Lv4voQ9iaa	good way to loose money, get a gym membership wheres theirs steam rooms

HHICEewjaa	Wal-Mart and Dick's do NOT even sell handguns.  And anyone who wold prefer to buy from "big box" stores is obviously way out of touch with reality and the reason we need guns.  Find a local gun shop that you like and buy from there.  Gun shows are dangerous to buy from since you do not have any guarantee of the background, and may receive a lemon.  Yo can usually seek repairs through the manufacturer but why risk that head ache?  You will thank yourself for buying from a gun shop because you will get a lot more help and assistance from more knowledgeable people there.  Contrary to popular belief, Wal-Mart for instance is not really any cheaper on firearms, as they pay the same for them as anyone else.  There is also zilch selection at Wal-Mart.  Cabela's and Gander Mtn. are pretty good but Dick's is a lot higher.  Dick's is also an anti 2nd Ammendment company, so think twice before spending any money there.|`|AA11694178	I have bought many guns from both shops and gun shows.  I have never had a problem with any guns that I have bought at either place but, I am pretty knowledgeable about guns so I know how to avoid buying a problem gun.  If you are buying a new gun, it is not warranted by the seller, it warranted by the manufacturer.  If you buy from someone at a gun show and you have a problem, you are on your own in dealing with the manufacturer.  This is rarely a problem.  However, if you buy from a shop, in almost every case, the shop owner will assist you in getting the needed warranty work done by the manufacturer.    Simply stated, with a dealer at a gun show, you will get as good a new gun as you can get at a shop.  The main difference is in service after the sale.|`|xOReEw6Waa	I prefer a local sport store or dealer that I can have access to, so as everyone says, if they have a local place of business or are at least available then the difference shouldn't  matter. This is the cost I found on one site for the pistol, an other site had one for $310.    http://www.gunslot.com/store/sig-sauer-m...|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	So your basically worried that if you buy at a show and the gun has some soft of issue or is faulty that you won't be able to get it repaired is that it? Usually repairs are done through the manufacturer. You pretty much go through the same things and the people selling guns besides private sellers are FFL holders and will therefore have a physical address. You could ask them for it. But most guns don't have issues and the ones that do the manufacturer will take care of it.|`|fcc5487b88b4303d263e3ddb1df9a865aa	a brand new gun from your local gun shop is always best-if you know the guy personally at the gun show and you know he backs up and guarantees his products then that is also the way to go-i would not buy a gun from a stranger(unless he is from a local gunshop selling new products or profesionaly refurbished older guns with some sort of a gauruntee) at a gun show unless it is a great price,you know all about the gun and how to fix it if need be,and you already know where to get the parts you need for it(just in case something is faulty) ;)|`|oYf3jSq6aa	It is generally not any cheaper to buy from a show than a shop  The biggest rip offs I have ever seen are at shows  many people come in assuming that the prices are cheaper and don't bother to even research what the going rate on what they are looking for is  Dealers know this and prey on it    Buy a new gun from anywhere and any problems are factory problems  Buy a used gun from anywhere and have problems the most most shops will do for you is feel sorry    The only deals at gun shows come from people like me that are just selling off part of their collection, and I am usually sold out by noon on the first day  Most of the time the dealers make the rounds and buy half my stuff before the doors even open  I walk around and see my stuff on their table for twice what i sold it to them for, and I make a profit on everything I sell|`|xcG5Tasiaa	Every gun show I've been to in my area is pretty much comprised of local FFL dealers and the occasional antique dealer, including one guy that's been trying to sell a 4-gauge shotgun for I don't know how long.     They all have addresses prominently posted (easy advertising), and you're going to be dealing with the manufacturer for repairs, anyway.|`|Vakup5Jvaa	A lot of dealers at gun show are from brick and mortar stores.     But if you can find the very same gun at a close price, it is good to support local businesses and to develop a rapport with a gun store. Many times on a return trip the owner may remember you and drop a couple bucks off the price of an extra clip.|`|UrNVuFx6aa	Most of the gun shows are made up of local dealers, although many are not well advertised. When you go to a gun show find out which dealers are local and where they are located at. Get a map to their shop if possible. That way, when you need more information about your firearm you can contact the same dealer who sold you the weapon. If you are worried about malfunctions in the firearm your best bet is always a licensed gunsmith. They may or may not be represented at the gun show, but are easily found in the Yellow Pages in most areas.   Ask around, chances are you know at least one person that has used a local dealer and gunsmith and can make a recommendation for a reputable shop for each. If not, call your local shooting club; they'll know who does the best work and who sales the best products.|`|21bef845536547868b0d688917f58277aa	The guys are right, gun show are made up of gun dealers.|`|803a466c10f04d50a006761a7ef5b803aa	Either or, I sell mine at 5% above cost + shipping + tax.    Pretty hard to beat.|`|4pLEDSejaa	I always buy from the big box retailers be it Walmart, Bass Pro, Cabelas, *****, etc.     Reasons   1. Gun shows, gun shops, and online auctions are expensive. Many times you can buy a brand new gun for the same price as a heavily used gun of the same model.   2. Small shop owners and gun show dealers are typically arrogant know-it-alls around here. I can't even stand to be around them.     If you have a big box retailer that sells handguns nearby, I think it's worth the drive.
f49ZZ8ILaa	Most MMA shorts give you better range of motion than a normal board short, and like the guy above me said the have a stronger stitching. They also usually have a tighter drawstring setup in the waist to keep them from being pulled off. The only MMA shorts I know of that have the grip in the groin are sprawls new line. That being said I train in both, if my grappling shorts are dirty or whatever I just throw on Billabong surfer style board shorts and train in those. They work just as well. If you are on a budget and want to train and already have regular board shorts they will hold you over just fine.|`|4gwSrPhfaa	MMA board shorts are made of different material and they are specifically made for grappling so they dont get bunched up, and they have tougher stitching,|`|7CNGokPVaa	The fabric for MMA shorts are tougher and most have a rubber strip in the groin area to help lock in triangles and other holds. Hope this helps.
Agsp62ttaa	I don't agree. She isn't ugly at all. Just because she isn't plastic perfect doesn't make her ugly.

As a result, it is less important to them to put others down in order to build themselves up.  So as a result, they tend to be more accepting of others.    Point is, join.  You will likely find that most of the members of the track team will be friendly and you will likely make new friends and learn something about yourself in the process.

Z1BtUmC2aa	If you're at a bar or a party with them, bet one of your friends that they can't balance a glass of beer on the back of each hand (on a table of course). When the beers are balanced...simply walk out!!! Well worth the cost.  If you live with them, you take a garbage can and fill it about 3/4 way with water. You lean this up against their door. Knock on the door, run, and hide so you can see it from a distance. When they open the door the water falls into their room.   If you work with them you can take a can of regular shaving cream, put it in the freezer overnight, use a canopener to cut the bottom open, then place it in there desk drawer, locker, shoes, etc., it will slowly unthaw and fill everything with shaving cream.  Hope this helps!|`|39cbcb3803017f914854d7e536ef56e5aa	letting Arizona play them in the super bowl that's a huge joke

The term soccer refers to an ancient game played using the same principles as todays futbal.

H3nbC71eaa	It's hard to compare the two because the Hart Foundation in the 80's was a tag team...in 1997 they were a stable. The tag team is one of the all time great tag teams, and the stable was loaded with talent...and always had each other's backs.    Overall I would go with the stable from 1997 just because by the numbers there was just more talent than in the tag team. When you have Bret, Owen, Davey Boy, Jim Neidhart and Pillman...that's just a whole lot of talent in one stable.  Even though Owen and Davey Boy did team up and held the tag titles while they were in that stable, tag team wise no other combination within that group beats the Hart Foundation tag team of the 80's.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Hart Foundation 1997.

obPSaYf3aa	Looks like you have a very high backswing like Pete Weber has.  Without seeing you bowl, it's definitely difficult to determine what type of tips or advice you need.  There are bowlers with high backswings, low backswings, 1/2 a swing, those that just dump it down onto the lane surface, some that use only two fingers, no thumb or a few that just plain fling the ball down the lane with all their might.        The basics are just to:    1.  Relax at address (when you're up on the approach with ball in hand and ready to start your motion) and breathe.    2.  Isolate your target, whether it be an arrow, a board or by sight towards the pins.    3.  Begin your approach with pushoff, backswing with a straight pendulum motion, forward motion on the front of the pendulum straight towards your target, release with thumb first, fingers last (right handers steering the ball with a 1/2 counterclockwise motion still pointing to your target) and then followthrough after release with your hand pointing straight out similar to shaking someone's hand.    (bowlers have different approaches to the foul line with 3, 4, 5, or even 6 steps, they walk straight, some drift left or right, but beginners are taught to walk straight with 4 steps, but to each their own, especially for their comfort and to match their usual gait, or walking style.)

AA10304847	The Cardinal defense can stand up to the Steeler offense, the question though is can the Steeler scary defense shut down the impressive Card receivers?     The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     The "us against the world" mentality is the other big edge for the CARDS, used to win the last 3 playoff games.....|`|rzkFHAEJaa	idk, cardinals?|`|DjjCvjlnaa	Steelers because their "D" is too much for the Cards to handle|`|DvKpx0Reaa	the steelers. now please stop asking this question.  kthxsbye !|`|MPDgKgIxaa	The steelers will win their defense is to good.    http://americanfootballtopics.blogspot.c...  http://americanfootballpredictions.blogs...  http://nflstadium.blogspot.com|`|yg3Pveakaa	We all know this saying, in sports "Great Offense wins games but Great Defense wins championships"    Pittsburgh has the D and they will win for sure..|`|65p86fMtaa	Steelers........Defense wins championships|`|3FYU6BBiaa	Cardinals because Kurt warner is too good of a quarterback to let the steelers defense get to him|`|Io3VsAexaa	The steelers D is nasty, but so is the cards O.

The main reason is that I do think the Steelers will be able to pressure Warner limiting the Cards passing game. I think the Steelers are good enough to pressure the QB while still only rushing four men. That leaves seven man that can stay back in coverage.

Pluim, Ivo Tiemessen, Alberto Mendez-Villanueva  The following research was taken from a study conducted with a partial aim of finding out the  physiological effects of 1 hour of tennis on male veteran (mean age = 44.6 years) tennis  players. A comparison between advanced (ITN 3-5) and recreational (ITN 7-9) players was  produced.  RESULTS:  Distance Covered  1. Advanced tennis players cover about 3.5km during a one-hour tennis match, and  recreational players about 3.2km.  Heart Rate  2. Average heart rate during tennis match play is fairly similar in advanced vs. recreational  players and is around 150 bpm (148.3 vs. 149.8). This is about 80% of maximum heart rate  (80.4% vs. 80.7 %).  Oxygen Consumption  3. Average oxygen consumption (VO2) during play was fairly similar in advanced and  recreational players (24.5 ml/kg/min vs. 23.3 ml/kg/min, p = 0.54). This equalled (54.9 (9.5)  % vs. 53.0 (7.1)%, p = 0.55) of VO2max.  Motion Analysis  4. Most of the time was spent walking (46 vs 42 min), followed by jogging (6 vs 7.5 min),  striding (2.1 vs 3.6 min) sprinting (0.5 vs 1.20 min) and sprinting 11 vs 30 s), in advanced vs  recreational players, respectively.  WHAT DOES THIS STUDY SHOW:  Advanced veteran male tennis players are able to cover a significantly longer running  distance at a lower running speed than recreational tennis players, even though their activity  profile is similar.  We hypothesise that this is the result of the advanced players` ability to hit wider angles and  anticipate better, resulting in a more continuous movement pattern. In addition, regular tennis  match-play at both an advanced and a recreational level meets the exercise  recommendations for healthy adults.  Study Reference:  Fernandez-Fernandez, J., D.

SgYMKzqyaa	I'm on the team and we do halfs fulls baskets and one leg stunts sometimes. I'm a flyer. And you probably could. Like flying is really fun and stuff. Some schools need a backhandspring to be on the team. Others dont. But you probably could. If they do require tumbling you should go to a gym and take classes. Or you can ask someone that can do one to spot you. If you are flexible and your really tight. You will be one. But jumps splits and motions are important too. You can be a good flyer but if you are sloppy you wont make it. Im really good at flying i have a double. Good luck and squeeze!|`|3stHzT1Haa	You would probably be doing elevators, extensions, elevator push up to extensions, liberties, heel stretches, maybe scales and scorpions. You just need to show your able to do this stuff because your light enough, and sometimes weight doesn't matter.

All positions are important.   you might be a back spot or a front spot also .  in middle school mostly you will be doing the basics that will get you prepared for high school. simple thing like basket tosses and half up and MAYBE fulls are what you will be doing. they might get the flyer into a liberty also.   just know the basics and have sSchoolspirit and you will be fine  and remember NEVER EVER EVER EVER say " whewwww"  its totally against the rules.   good luck (:|`|vtR5277laa	it all depends on the bases. if you have good bases you should have no trouble being a flyer.  mostly only basic stunts are done in middle school. like halfs, fulls, libs, heel stretches, and maybe scorp to scale combos if your team is good.|`|mUP8Spj0aa	Flyers don't do a lot of stunts at a Middle School level. Basically just heel stretches, scorpions, liberties, and possibly kewpies.    If ur a flyer though, you'll probably be expected to have a few floor skills down already (a Roundoff Backhandspring and a front or back tuck would probably be enough)    I think you should try out to be a flyer, but settle for base if you don't make it

cd8fb1a8552a48786a6354cd99f5f249aa	well you never know, Catania is a weak team and were probably not so well motivated to play, not even against 10 players.    Hans-Dieter Flick, Germany's assistant coach, took over the team in the Euro quarter-final against Portugal and they played very well against them, although the score was 3-2 but Germany clearly dominated that match, and they seemed to have played a more comfortable match than they did in the group stage, but still, i wouldn't say Flick is better than L?w.    that doesn't mean Baresi might not be good enough, i mean he is an assistant of Mourinho's and he was probably an assistant or head coach of another team, so he mixes up his experience with what he learns from others and the result can be very good, but the point is we cannot judge how good he is from 1 match.|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	Are you serious with this, the guy wins ONE game against CATANIA and he is better than Mourinho.....

kqP7GwOcaa	If I was you I would listen to your Dad, his advice is sound, and he is correct to steer you away from boxing.  Find another outlet for your energy that doesn't further risk your already questionable eyesight.  Your not screwed yet, but if you mess around and don't see a punch coming, you could be screwed and blind if not worse off.      Find another dream.|`|l4WEwTWwaa	I'm going to say go for laser surgery otherwise you will have to find something else and wonder at fifty if you could have made it as a boxer.|`|AVTXclXqaa	If your vision is horrible then i would say to forget about a boxing career cause taking punches to the eye could make u blind , but if ur family has the money and if u would take the risk, then u could have laser surgery. Tiger Woods had it done and he sees better now, so u never know.
MsnVIjbnaa	I am right where you are, Pink. I know the answer (for me at least) because I used to be a couple of minutes faster per mile when I trained correctly.    To go faster you need to be able to sustain a higher aerobic rate. Sure, but what's that mean?    You said you do distance so you should already have good endurance. You get strength and endurance from long, suitably paced runs.    If you want more speed, you've got to mix it up! Endurance days plus speed days = good race times. We both need to get with the sprinting and speed work.    But relax, speed work can be fun. Run intervals on a track, 200's and 400's. Run stadium stairs. That's the traditional way. If you want more fun, try touch football, full court basketball, soccer, jumping rope, trail running in the hills or anything else with that requires bursts of speed.    It would help me to shed a few pounds but you may not need to do that. Anyway, to go fast we both need speed work. Try putting in at  least 10% or more of your weekly training miles running intervals on the track or something equivalent.|`|2Pkgn88Paa	You have to work on your form, if you start of having big strides then step it up from there you'll notice a difference in your speed.|`|ev3EwV2laa	not sure, maybe use more resistance by using ankle weights, im sure if you ran with someone faster than you and did your best to keep up with them you would figure out how much you could truly push yourself.|`|xhF99ubuaa	Run  East to West coast 10 Times, you'll be the fastest!|`|94FivE4yaa	If you just want to increase your speed, try doing a little strength and cardio training. Leg weights are good, but you can also workout using machines at your local gym. Riding on a bike machine with resistance added can really help to make you stronger. You can also do squats, lounges, run up and down stairs/hills, jump rope, which can all help you build more leg muscle. Another thing to focus on is your overall energy. Make sure that you're drinking plenty of water and eating healthier foods. Once you began eating right, you'll notice a change in how much energy you have and you won't get tired as quickly when you run. Hope this is helpful!!
nLXKmcnBaa	well, yes footwork... but specifically, it helps you maintain a rhythym...   you know.... you shouldn't stand still while your opponent is winding up...things like that.|`|NdTy3twjaa	It definitely helps your footwork but also your coordination as well.|`|RC4K4TQ4aa	definately helps with coordination  calf muscles  foot work  and its a great cardio workout and alternative to running|`|3eeda29c64cb4c0d10c7d7c0813cce7faa	Jumping rope helps tremendously!

Since I started jumproping, I have noticed that my footwork is a lot less sloppy than it used to be. It is also great for all around fitness as you can work up a good sweat jumproping.|`|WAfh2Blqaa	it is great for tennis. in tennis, you have to move on the balls of your feet, and not let your heels touch the ground. jumping rope helps that. it is very similar to boxing in that regard.    it helps build footspeed, agility, and endurance.     Connors used to jump rope for hours each day.|`|B8TrAbMwaa	it would certainly help with your footwork. in tennis it is good to be quick on your toes. also, jumping rope is a fantastic workout!

Taker is gold, he is the WWE. However, since he only appears now and again that is why he gets over looked by some fans. Plus we all know that Taker is the best, let some of the younger guys get the Glory for a change.|`|8Im1iGFTaa	He did do a lot last year but it could be that he took off so much time|`|NqTXgrZgaa	You are right but maybe its the fact that people like hbk or jeff hardy is always around and never get forgotten, he does not appear in every show and that could make people kinda forget him to go for the younger talent. I admire Taker he did last year a great job but he does not stick around to get any type of thank you from the fans or to be seen as the main guy for those things, he just cares to put on a show something he does, he said in a interview ages ago that the wwe for him is not about money anymore its about helping younger talents get somewhere!!!

7wVm7lwEaa	I think it must be the offensive side as a striker  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with|`|q8mbICQ8aa	taller players usually play safety, or cornerbacks, maybe even outside linebackers. The only difference is outside linebackers are more strong, and safety's and cornerbacks are more fast, or speed and agility. If you would rather be a linebacker, than i would suggest lifting a little bit of weights and doing push-ups. If you want to be a safety or a cornerback, i would suggest running more to work on stamina, and jumping-jacks.|`|06sKUW40aa	I play defensive end i i was pretty good and that i was the only defensiveline men that got a sack.

UmkumUXJaa	I have been coaching for about 8 years now and every year I get some guys that don't know what they are doing. It isn't that big of a deal I can usually pick them out pretty early. If you have any problems with learning talk to your coaches and they will show you. They may make an example out of you but it is only to teach the whole group, they aren't picking on you. You can also ask some of the other players if they can catch you up. The main thing is most middle schools don't run the same scheme as high schools. I personally have different schemes that I go to every couple of years because of the different kids that come in.  As for the drills just watch and learn because most of the freshman coming in haven't done the drills that high schools do. As for the basic formations, play a little Madden, pick plays by formation and pay attention to that.   Hopefully this can help you out. Good luck. And always go 110% no matter what anyone else tells you. As I always tell my guys practice at high intensity, play at high intensity. You can always take someone's spot, nothing is guaranteed.|`|3KPzDyE6aa	First of all you are exactly like me last year so I feel what i say will pretty much be right for you too.  First off I was exactly your size at this point last year (I am currently a Freshman).  I actually played Flag Football (got MVP :]) but that shouldn't matter too much that you didn't.  Now for what you have to do to succeed.    Start lifting weights by the beginning of March.  I will not get into the serious details but here is basic outline.  Make sure to ask people from a gym what to do.  Don't believe things you here online    Monday=upper Body, run 3 miles ( work your way up from 2)  Tuesday=legs  Wednesday=upper Body, run 3 miles ( work your way up from 2)  Thursday=run 10 hill repeats (work up about 2 more every 2 months)  Friday=upper Body, run 3 miles (work your way up from 2)  Saturday=legs  Sunday=technique drills    If you want me to explain you the details of working out just hit me up with an email.  I Just would rather not waste time here if you are not commited.    When I joined the Freshman team I played RB and MLB, which is basically what you are asking to play.  I was 5'11" 175 pounds (I am now 185 pounds).  In fact, I was so strong they moved me up to JV to play TE and I never played a Freshman game, which is good because the coach sucked.  I also recently benched 240 pounds after starting at 75 pounds.  I am expecting you will have much the same gain.    Anyways yeah hit me up with an email if you are interested.
ZKikquiOaa	I've seen the sand pits here in the US at the local high schools and at the olympic training center.  That sand is so soft it must feel like landing on a bed.

37evQRaDaa	I think everybody who can should use it as their main transportation.  I don't think it's possible for everyone.  A bike wouldn't be practical for someone who has to haul hundreds of pounds of materials every day.  There are bikes and trailers that can haul upwards of 300 pounds, but I don't mind seeing people use automobiles for that kind of thing.  Some people who are disabled can't use a bike.  Some older people can't use a bike.  However, perhaps if they'd used a bike more in their youth, they'd still be fit enough to use one now.    People have been conditioned to use the auto for every trip they take.  This was done in great part by the automobile companies.  People use to walk to places that were close to their house.  Now most people live isolated from the businesses that they frequent, so they (think they) have to drive.  However, do they have to drive from one store in a mall to another store in the same mall, even when they're only a few hundred feet away from each other?  Absolutely not!  And when it boils down to it, do they actually need to drive to the mall?  I won't get into the politics of where you shop, but if the place you're shopping is just a couple miles away, why not hop on your bike?  The only reason we hop in a car is conditioning.  Why wouldn't you want to get out and enjoy the fresh air?  Why would you pay (gasoline, insurance, maintanence, etc) for something you can do for free?  And why would you pollute your environment when you can do it without polluting your environment?  Some folks will complain about bad weather, but again that's just conditioning.  Sometimes a good rain shower while you're riding your bike feels fabulous!  Although I'm not a big fan of the cold, even -20 degree days haven't kept me from riding my bike.  It all depends on how you've trained yourself (your mind and your body.)    I have written many pages on the reasons to ride a bike.  I'm not going to go over them again here.  I'll just say that I mostly agree.  There are obviously exceptions, but I think that everyone who can should use a bicycle as transportation, and I think that cities should be designed to be more bicycle friendly.|`|KhfFeve9aa	Most definitely, and more people would if they got into it a little and saw how easy it is to do most trips with a bike.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	up here it's not practical. too cold too long. too far between places. in cities or towns more people could. i would have to disagree as a generalization for everyone.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Most people cant, but those who can should.|`|5aKUV5afaa	Not as a main source of transportation.  I think people need to start thinking about using the car.  If you have to run to the store, and it's under a mile away, to pick up one thing, do you really need to drive?  Can't you walk or ride your bike?  This would cut down obesity in the US as well as helping the Environment.  Everyone has excuses though.  It's too hot or too cold to walk.  It's called dressing for the weather and not being a wimp!|`|qwI7pLHqaa	Depends on the distance.|`|5rOPGalhaa	NO WAY JOSE!!!!!|`|Hq9NPQkOaa	if your only riding short distances to places i don't see why not|`|iYDPodN0aa	I agree just think about it im from Chicago if it was only bikes in the street how clean do you think the air would be?    and for those who cant "ride" a bicycle  that's why there's public transportation(buses,trains)    ahhh good ol dreams

He's like a lot of pros in all sports...  tremendous athlete, needs a little work on the "human being" part.|`|cw4T3xMhaa	KG is one of the best players in the league and every good player in the NBA knows it. So me comin from the city of Champs yes i do like KG, he's the big ticket.|`|OxS3UVE6aa	1 ring and he acts this way? i mean MJ had 6, Magic, Bird and Shaq has a couple. But they are not cocky like KG. I liked him when he was with the T'Wolves. Right now? I don't think he has the right to do the things shown in the video. No one does. Regardless of championships won.|`|wWucY461aa	you got KG mixed up with Paul Peirce.  Paul Peirce is the one who's full of himself.. None of the big 3 won championship before last year. so why just criticize KG? why not criticize ray allen and Paul Peirce?  I agree that KG is not good enough to lead a team to the finals or win the finals, he does need a good team around him.  However hes the heart of the celtics.  They would have never made it to the finals let alone won the finals without KG.|`|fVDlxV9Eaa	why cant you just be happy for the guy. He has never won a champonship before. Before that season when the whole trade happened people had doubts because people didnt think the three could work together but they set their differences aside and won 1. Also what do you know about getting to the finals without a supporting cast? Allen Iverson did the same thing got his team to the finals, just shut up and give it a rest. You are just mad that they are so good and lebron didnt win

It would bring peace to the world if people can just accept they are both great players.|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	Lebron James. Kobe Bryant is the most overrated player in NBA history. ask yourself: would the "best player in the world" choke a 24-point lead in a Finals game? or get absolutely humilated by 39 points? both of these happened to Kobe Bryant. i know you delusional Lakers fans can't handle the truth.    Kobe Bryant = 2008 Finals LVP for choking a 24-point lead|`|3Widbjn2aa	i'd say lebron is the better playa. he didn't get caught by the nation cheating on his chick like kobe did. real playa's don't get caught.|`|F1xpcJ2Laa	wow...you can put anything on the end of "le" these days.....youtube videos prove nothing...

I'm gonna tell you what I tell them: it's fake up to a point. Any idiot knows that if you do any of the moves they do to a person out in the real world (or hell, even in the ring, if they actually DID THE MOVE), said person would be frigging dead. But you have to know how to fake the move, to make it look real, in order to be any good at wrestling. It's all about selling the move, making it look real without hurting the guy you're fighting. My advice? Find a wrestler, ask him that same question. He'll happily give you an answer while kicking your head in.|`|PCL2ofRuaa	yes it is fake|`|6guPnmcOaa	OH MY GOSH!  If I got paid a dollar each time someone asked that... I'd be RICH!  UGH...  Its SCRIPTED! Not FAKE but SCRIPTED. Theres a difference...

GpzvrlHdaa	Wow, that model 88 Winchester is some rifle!  I have owned two of them, one in 284 Winchester, and a 308.  That is a fine and fast handling rifle, and the 308 will park your deer decisively!  I personally don't like pump rifles because they tend to rattle while being carried.  Having said that, your 270 will park your deer decisively!  In other words, either cartridge is fully up to the task you set for it, so take the rifle you feel most comfortable shooting, and use the other as a back up.  J|`|JSGLKnA4aa	both calibers are good.|`|IvwstV5Laa	i think the 308. is better|`|r00oHbqlaa	there both great guns i prefer the 270 from those two but you should look into bying a 243........that is the best deer hunting gun i have ever used.|`|21bef845536547868b0d688917f58277aa	It is really depend on the person.  Personally, I like the 270 cause it is 30 06Caliber (30 caliber).|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	Just use whichever you are most comfortable with. If you shoot both equally well then I'd use whichever one has better quality glass on it.    Of course that Model 88 is a classy piece. I know someone who has one in .308 and uses it for about 99% of his non-varmint hunting.|`|5VELZt7Saa	i would take the .308 out for the morning hunt then after lunch bring the .270,theres nothing wrong with bringing 2 guns to deer camp|`|ZA7qM4mvaa	The .270 without a doubt.|`|803a466c10f04d50a006761a7ef5b803aa	Whitetail deer I would use the .270    For the Mule der I would use the .308|`|bHr7nGAvaa	The .270 and the .308 are both great cartridges, and both are more than satisfactory for deer.  The .270 will shoot a little tighter groupings and kick a little less though.  When it comes down to it, choose whichever rifle is more comfortable to aim, carry, shoot etc...|`|7royFhIgaa	The 270 is a flatter shooting rifle and less kick.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	For woods hunting, I'd pick the lever action but put less magnification on top. Something like 1.75-6x or 2-7x (or even just a peep sight) makes the 88 a top choice.|`|TvARYVRJaa	by far the 270,,   better to have that long range  in them there hill and long corn field flats,,,, former pa res.... sw bedford co.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Use which ever you are most comfortable with and shoot best.  Either is a superb choice for deer.  Me, I'd opt for that 308.
xOReEw6Waa	Travis said it, here we go again.     Any of the 30-06 family is going to work, 25-06,270,280,30-06, same with the 243,7mm-08,308 all will work equally well. If you really need to access your gun needs then determine if you are going to hunt anything else. I have owned 30-06s since I was 14 because I hunt deer and elk, and options for bear and moose. If you are using a quality BONDED bullet at 90 to 105 grains, your 243 should be all the gun you need for deer at 100 yards out to 250 yards. That being said, it is always fun to have a new gun, and the 30-06 and 270 give you the most bang for the buck in performance. I wouldn't hesitate to take a shot on elk or moose with either out past 300 yards if I have a good spot to place the bullet. If you want only a deer rifle then 6.5 x 55 Swede is a wonderful cartridge to go with the above mentioned. There in no better "brush" cartridge, but some people like lever action rifles for ease of handling in tighter confines. Considering I hunt in North Idaho where the buck brush has to be worse than PA., I still rely on a bolt action because I know my shot placement at 300 plus yards counts more than it does at 100 yards.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Here we go again!!!!|`|TvARYVRJaa	well   here is a ole saying    yous can cut down a little tree with a big chainsaw,, but yous can not cut down a big tree with a little chainsaw,,,   so  always have in your ability to shoot at distance with any  cal  one day you will wish you had the  long ranger   ok thanks former pa res centerville  bedford co,,,,,,,,,|`|JSGLKnA4aa	either will do fine for deer. i personally prefer 270 with 140 bullets.|`|5VELZt7Saa	i would use the .270,i hunt 15 minutes away from PA,there are some long shots from the top of those hills.|`|kMZMFaeHaa	If you hunt in thick brush, I would recommend a lever action like a 30-30. I personally was never a big fan of the '06 but i love the .270 and .308. I hunt in PA also and I use a Tikka T3 in .270 With a 3-9x40 Bushnell elite 3200. If lever's not your thing, you could also try shotgun slugs or even an old WW2 Rifle like a Mauser 98 (8mm, similar to a 30-06) or a Mosin Nagant(7.62x 54, also very similar to the 30-06). The Mosins are open sighted and usually cost around $100. I have been seeing more and more of those around.|`|fuyyuo0gaa	I'd personally go with 30-06|`|cobI4JIzaa	i would just stick with the 243.( i have taken a lot of game both big and small with mine). unless you just want a new gun for your collection. i my self would pick the 270 over the 30-06 or 308..jack O'Connor killed plenty of game with his|`|ZA7qM4mvaa	As a PA resident I have been hunting with a .270 for 22 years, has never failed to do its job.|`|LnWOSedEaa	7mm rem mag|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Go with whatever. I like my Mosin Nagants. They are cheap to get, cheap to feed, and easy to use and clean. What's not to love?
AA11016927	It all depends on what type of structure your fishing.    The type of structure or situation you would fish a cork and jig would be:    a. Very cold water situations where the fish are suspended and you need a super-slow, suspended, retrieve.     b. You want to suspend your jig over thick wood, shell, bottom/structure or weeds.    However, most Jig situation in Bass fishing is one of 3 main presentations:    1. "Flipping" to heavy structure and matted weed-beds and docks.    2. "Pitching" to heavy structure, matted weed-beds, and docks      3. "Swimming" a Jig much like a crank-bait or an auger/swirl-tail worm.     Examples:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLxd10P2I...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faZef9ATI...    Hope this helps ya? Good fishing!|`|ICGQ9EBcaa	I hop my jigs along the bottom or pitch/flip to cover. the bobber and jig you speak of is what we call float-n-fly here in Western Carolina. It uses a long spinning rod about 8' with a 3 way swivel tied to main line and a bobber on one end and a small hair jig that sits 1-2' under bobber. this is a deadly smallmouth rig here in the cold clear mountain lakes. never fished it I just stick to bass jigs|`|AA11554307	Learn to pitch and flip, to me thats the only way to use a jig. and yes you should fish it slow by making it jump around with your pole.|`|AA11318420	it depend on what kind of fish your wanting to catch. you can fish them either way when i fish for crappie or trout i use a float if i am fishing for bass i just bounce it on the bottom or swim it slow right off the bottom good luck|`|amlmhoUuaa	I always swim a jig or hop it along the bottom try different things the fish will tell you what they want.

Other than that, if this is a last minute thing, then one thing you can do is call in 2 days before Sunday and say you have come down with a cold of some sort, and snifle while you are on the phone. If they ask, tell them you don't know what kind of cold it is, or if it even maybe bronchitis. Tell them that you will have to miss Saturday and Sunday but should be able to go back into work the next day scheduled if feeling any better.

J6xmZqj1aa	So this is the second time I'm gonna have to write this message, I accidentally erased the last one.  Maybe this one will be more refined.    What you are training for and what the time span are every important factors.  (let me know if you can and I can give you some more support)    I was in the exact same situation a few months ago, I was runnin 10 min a day after injury and I had districts in 3 weeks, now my long run is 7 miles.       The general rule for increasing mileage in 10-12% a week, but you can be more agressive if you hav more imediate goals.    The routine is a variation of Brad Hudsons adaptive running theory/method.  When you are young a strong base is most important check out the marathon preformanct link and click on youth development tab.    Not all of you runs should be at the same legenth or speed, the repetion bores the muscles, stunts your fittness, and results in serious injury.  A good program that you can tailor to your needs follows: Sunday: rest, Monday: easy slow and short, Tuesday: threshold/ long intervals( a speed day but not super short and fast, a fartlek is a good way to start), Wednesday: easy recovery, Thursday: super speed day, start easy and work into some more intese fartleks, and/or track workouts, Friday: recovery nothing hard, Saturday: long run not to fast and no longer than 50 minutes.    About the abs; only 20 reps of one move is not enough (try to start with 3 minutes a few times a week and work up from there to 7-15), and once again variation will go a long way in engageing th muscles and preventing injury.  I can't recomend any piticular moves, but check out the Runners World link and explore the site for some more moves.  Try not to ignore the back, butt, or stabalizing muscles, us runners have a tendancy to have really bad backs.    If you can add some hill sprints to help prevent injury, gain stregenth, and inprove you stride it would be great. Just 8 seconds a pop, no more than 10 a day a few days a week.  If you feel really motivated doing some drills would be a great idea, as would working on the upper body as well.       Sorry and misspellings, and good luck. By the way i do all of this stuff myself and i'm in great shape for track, it dosen't take more that 3 hours a day (running included)  Let me know how it works|`|0bzIkdyOaa	You can also use the beginners running plan on www.runnersworld.com and then once you finish that 10 week program you can either train for a 5K race or just go through the training plan as if you were going to run one.  since your beyond where the program would start . begin the program where you would be. There are also lots of good articles and training plans to slowly increase your mileage up to where you want to be.    http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,71...

Be a grand slam champion and be no.1!|`|lzVF1diNaa	yes... out of all the tennis players i dislike her the most  there's something about her that i dont like she's too arrogant.    EDIT- lol at the above answer!!!|`|rGGymoowaa	What a bunch of jealous losers as when it is all over and done Serena will be in the top 5 all time grand slam winners.

I do the surfing on tv when she's on or go online to get the results rather than watch her.

Honestly..|`|sywoTNKgaa	I love watching Serena. As a matter of fact, her and Venus are the only two women players that I actually enjoy watching.     I'm kind of surprise that people think she's boring. Whether you root for her or her opponent, watching a Serena match is like watching a suspenseful drama, you never know what's gonna happen next and when it does it's always very dramatic.     You can't tell me that Dementieva and Kuznetsova fans weren't on the edge of their seats when their player went up in the match hoping for the upset? I don't think you can call that kind of tension and emotional up and down boring.     Serena is a dominating player with extraordinary mental toughness. When you have that kind of power it's only natural that people will hate you. You want her success for yourself or someone you identify with. The sad thing for you and the others here is that your opinion won't stop her from succeeding.|`|agHUvyAtaa	I find shis a very talented player but the horrible grunt and poor attitude don't make it easier to watch.

At least Elena has a better grunt :D|`|gWLhIoIiaa	she bores me|`|oGBEl25jaa	i cant stand the williams sisters.    only reason they are good is because they are freaking huge and have a lot of strength.    had they not been that big, they would be just another average player.    and they keep getting lucky. serena should of lost in the last round but as soon as she started losing magically the temperate hit 40 degrees C and they closed the roof.    but when djokovic played it was 62 on the court. it doesnt matter what the normal temperature is because they are not playing in mid air. they were playing on the court where it was 62 and it should have been closed.    the americans always get what they want.|`|NdTy3twjaa	That's your prerogative, I like watching her play.  Maybe subconsciously you have  racial overtones.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	I do.. i watch her play just to see who wins between her and her opponent.

Of course Serena will be a great you idiot she's won friggen 10GS titles! Sharapova will always be known to the tennis world. People WILL consider a RUSSIAN an ALL TIME GREAT in years to come. Are you aware of how many are currently in the top 10?! RUSSIANS ARE KNOWN FOR DOMINATING THE TOP 10. Clearly they're good enough to be great somewhere along the line|`|RC4K4TQ4aa	sick of her...    the russians are much nicer to look at.
KdhNCnEjaa	I think their record speaks for itself|`|F934e4HQaa	NO|`|Hki3AoL5aa	their play is amazing right now, Thomas has been sensational in net they are for real.  They can beat anybody.|`|jKOB7n35aa	If anything they are underrated. They are fighting with San Jose for the President's Trophy and people still doubt them. They will continue their success in the postseason, and I think they are good enough to return Lord Stanley's Cup to Boston.|`|hFX5UQGdaa	they are good but people think they are overrated|`|G33E41IBaa	No.  They're first in the East, and a close second in the league.  Nothing overrated about that.|`|KDLoxdQgaa	They are for real right now. But i could see them screwing it up just like The Tennessee Titans did in the NFL|`|TBu2iaPaaa	their underrated because of their poor their hockey skills|`|hX089rlnaa	I'd like to say yes, but they have been playing very well for some time now. I don't think you can have their record and not be good.    However I think when push comes to shove, they will fall short this year.|`|dhs9QBMoaa	The team itself is solid.  I still have a hard time believing in Tim Thomas though.  I guess I just can't believe in career minor league guys who suddenly come out of nowhere and look great.  Then again, Kurt Warner is heading back to the Super Bowl.  I guess he's living proof that a nobody can become a somebody.|`|kFaJxEhPaa	First off... which Boston team isn't. But, the record does however speak for itself, it's just... anything less than a Championship in Boston, is a disappointment.|`|Ife1hiyyaa	i dont think so i think the sharks are overrated plus teams that peak this soon will eventually run out of steam i'm hopeing.|`|sVg0O0Jcaa	they are an exciting young team but until they make it deep into the playoffs, its all just speculation|`|Jb5itwHtaa	Over rated means they get a lot of props, but don't have the numbers. Right now, they have the numbers and are getting their props. So, yes they are for real. Will it continue?? Lets wait and see in the playoffs|`|97Xy6pEGaa	They're good. But no way can they compete with the big boys out in the West if they were to make it to the Stanley Cup Finals. Plus their team is very young and many do not have any extended playoff experience. I also personally think that Tim Thomas is overrated.|`|Mqurv3LXaa	No.  The Bruins are a young team. The likes of Krejci, Bergeron, etc. are all young and talented players. Those players are starting to come into their own.   Marc Savard is one of the premier passers in the games. (A fan from Boston calls him the "poor man's Joe Thornton".)  Zedeno Chara and his defensive parters have done fantastic.  Tim Thomas continues to amaze me and if he falters they have Manny Fernandez. (who has won hardware in the past) (Jennings Trophy)|`|rAVWzcoEaa	Yes and No.  They really are a good team but it seems that their progress is slowly going downward. They will make the playoffs but it will take them a few years before their young players begin to mature into a Stanley Cup Team.|`|O1pbzo8Vaa	They are certainly having one of the best years in NHL history according to an article at NHL.com    To the person who said they can't hang with the teams out west..........The Bruins laid a 4-1 beating on the Red Wings at the end of November.  They are also 7-3-1 against the 'over-rated' west!|`|TNAxR21Maa	no|`|A2au0v5saa	Someone mentioned Boston sports teams being overrated.. How can you even say that. The Celtics are in first place, the Patriots went 11-5 without Brady, Maroney, Thomas, Bruschi, Harrison, Lmaont Jordan for 8 games?, and manyyy more, the Red Sox got to the ALCS and put up a good fight, and the Bruins are tied for first in the NHL.    Back to your question.. no, they play the game how it should be played. Right now they have 2 strong goaltenders, good defensman, the scoring has been there, they're a young team and they have first and second year players stepping up like they've been in the league for 10 years. With Savard and Krejci setting everyone up, Kessel and Wheeler putting the biscuit in the basket, Lucic and Thornton kicking a$$, and Thomas and Fernandez standing on their hands night after night.. they got something good in the mix here.
50bEHtYfaa	Monta Ellis is still trying to get back in the motion. I say give him maybe 1 or 2 more months to get back on track. He is not used to playing on a regular basis. It is not easy coming off an injury and playing like you used to. Give Ellis sometime and he will be back to normal.|`|Jsvz996Baa	even though they did not win i think monta is doing well.he hasn't been playing for a long time he has to get back to his normal self.|`|P93I8CHtaa	i stopped watching it since the warriors are losing big time|`|NJtjJA8Baa	I was watching until halftime. Then I gave up.|`|2dgVkcVAaa	i'm not watching it since 1st Q ended.|`|vRhdPxNxaa	give monta some time.  well in his first game back he scored 20 points.he just needs to get back in the flow of things.|`|jBxoy6Pbaa	it is the NBA|`|YkiLHRK9aa	hes overatted|`|0Fi9EANKaa	I'm TRYING to watch it...its a whompage.
xPCKePufaa	Though tension does play a factor in it, string type is also a bit part of it. Polyester (one of the stiffer types) hardly ever move, whereas multifilament (the super soft expensive stuff) is pretty prone to string movement, generally speaking. Either way, restringing is a pretty good idea, that always helps some. If it really bothers you, try looking into some polyester stuff. You may like how it plays as well (lower power, higher control and spin).|`|GombKA8Kaa	The nature of the sport is that the strings in racquet must move, especially if you hit with topspin or slice.    Sure the looser your strings the more they move and the tighter they are this will definitely lessen it.    As already mention more power but less control if strung looser, more control, less power if tighter.|`|ZpNQVyLkaa	if you get your racket restrung with high quality string real tight, then is should improve but if you always slice there will always be movement.|`|cs7qQ1Wyaa	if your strings are moving around a lot it means they are loose and need to be restrung but in saying that having loose strings makes your shots more powerful but not as accurate, and I'm pretty sure its not from doing a slice shot lol.
5WttD4V5aa	I know i wish edge would Hit vickie with a Chair and then Edge become a Fan favourite heel like Orton.|`|4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	Yeah i definitely agree with you this storyline is now boring and it's been going on for months. I was glad when they stopped kissing and stuff in the ring but this is too much. They really need to do better than this. Well so far smackdown ratings have been much better than it was before. With the Hardy's rivalry and christian returning to smackdown i expect this storyline to break and improvement in smackdown.|`|AA11044288	it  sucked from the start it was boring from the start why  vickie edge and her do not match up lita and edge worked be cause amy  and edge    was a good match|`|ZofcbEzvaa	viagra! lol! wat da heck?!!? that's hilarious!  but i hope that edge and vickie storyline ends this year.|`|7IWvFHOxaa	FIRST OF ALL IT NEVER WAS FUN AND NEW. AND SECOND, WHO EVER COULD BELIEVE EDGE WOULD TAKE AN UGLY FAT CHICK LIKE VICKE AFTER BEING WITH A SEXY REDHEAD LIKE LITA. I MEAN THAT IS JUST NOT REALISTIC. GIVE THE VIEWERS SOME KIND OF BRAIN WILL YA WWE.|`|l6g3moiEaa	This storyline truly shouldn't have been to begin with. It's been pointless since day one, and we've seen jackassy GM's before she rolled along. It's not as if she revolutionized the concept. All she's done is trash the Guererro name, and make us all question Eddie's taste in women, because she's fugly as all hell...|`|mvTc3GxNaa	lmao that story line is still goin on?    i quit watchin wwe for tna.    its non-repetative.    xD|`|S6iJSXseaa	YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

85kWzSzuaa	The Steelers have much more talent and work better as a team both on offense and defense.    My team, the Patriots, beat Arizona by 40 points but then lost big to Pittsburgh.    If Arizona beats Pittsburgh I will vote for Obama in 2012.|`|gHtI5xe7aa	I think the cardinals play better as a team, but the steelers have more talent.

5WttD4V5aa	Yes it's true but mkan hes LUCKY.|`|O6VTWYDtaa	no he has a boy friend|`|4tvI9WYjaa	possible cena is not lucky melina is 10 times better|`|7f2GSDmqaa	no|`|4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	Well i think before they were but now i don't think so. I think Mickie is single now.|`|8Im1iGFTaa	not any more but they were|`|PNu9c7UZaa	They were, but they split up a while ago sometime before summerslam, I believe.  Vince doesn't like when his stars date each other.  When John Morrison was dating Melina he moved John Morrison to ECW.  He moved Bobby Lashley to Raw so he could separate him form Krystal (who Lashley was dating at the time) then WWE ended up releasing Krystal.  That probably was one of the reasons why he quit WWE. Maria had a crush on John Cena and Cena felt the same way about her and what did Vince do...he moved Maria to Smackdown (true stroy).|`|kFstyJTPaa	doubt it|`|ZofcbEzvaa	Not anymore. Mickie and Cena were dating last year but, Cena broke up with her because CM Punk wanted to dated Mickie and Cena was just being nice. Then CM Punk dumped her and Jeff Hardy started dating Mickie and they broke up so, Mickie is single now.|`|PCL2ofRuaa	yes|`|AA11230418	Probaly not true|`|2GYmGP90aa	don't listen to half of them cause they lying. john and mickie never dated they where just friends.people act like a guy and girl can't just be friends they think they dating, nut they ain't. hey never went together because john has a girlfriend at home in his hometown.|`|AA11970344	nope they were like 3 months before it came on screen then after about 4 weeks of being on screen they really broke up actually Mickie broke up with John he was really sad about it :(

lWoxFHhFaa	The Undertaker and Shawn Michaels have fought twice once in the Hell in a Cell match and once in a Casket Match. The Reason those were the only two was because Michaels suffered a severe back injury in the Casket Match and was out of wrestling for four years. And then with Brand Extension they were just never in a storyline together again.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	that's nice  no the  first time they meet and only time they meet was the hell in a cell match which shawn michael's won due the help with kane who made his debut|`|ZofcbEzvaa	pretty cool promo dude. 5 stars|`|qbEeecndaa	looks good A+

XtFsntdSaa	sania Mirza is an Indian tennis player who has caused a lot of controversy in her country for placing her feet on the Indian flag and for wearing revealing clothes while she plays.

RIP is the problem, pistons were doing good while RIP was out. Also Curry is an Idiot! And to the guy who said Iverson needs to step up his offensive calibur?.... thats not A.I.'s fault, the pistons barely let him play and they limti his shooting. When the Pistons win A.I. normally has good points and assists. But no he doesnt get the ball enough. Also A.I. isnt a cancer he is actually helping the Pistons as a team, they just recently did an article on A.I.'s efforts as a team and in the locker room and stuff like that. So scr*w the Iverson haters you act like everything is his fault|`|OxS3UVE6aa	ai for any center with the same price tag or ai should start to pull his high caliber offense. that would resolve the issue as well. but the bigger picture is 2010. that's what this is all about. the future of the pistons.

1Byis7Flaa	I just finished reading some articles from Fox sports, and there is a lot of speculation that Favre will not be returning to the Jets.  Sports Illustrated writer thinks so, anyways.    I think Favre was inked to a 3 year deal, right?  So, I like to hope Favre will be back next year.  He led the Jets to a nice finish, and very close to a playoff run in a tough division.      But if Favre doesn't come back...I'd have to say, the Jets will go with another option for QB,|`|BlgZmV6uaa	They might be intrested in another Hall of Fame QB maybe Joe Montana will get the call.|`|Gz0gS1KZaa	IF THEY LOSE FAVRE THEY ARE GONNA LOSE EVERY GAMES THEY PLAY|`|XLIjwvNXaa	well, maybe marques tuiasosopo or whatever as a raiders fan ill give him to you|`|ak44mIy3aa	Maybe they will bring back Dan Marino just how they did with Favre|`|0Fi9EANKaa	Brett Favre wouldn't be able to tell you if he was coming back even if it was at the end of July. He's cried on television 2 seasons ago and when asked how does it feel he responded with tears in his eyes "its tough, its tough" but he came back the next season and contemplated retirement and came back the next season to play for the Jets. I personally think he will be back for 1 last seasons with the Jets but even he doesn't know what he's doing with his football career.|`|nkyRezB7aa	I think Favre will be back for 1 more season. If he doesn't, the Jets could really make a splash by getting Matt Cassel. He was terrific last year. Plus, could you imagine a game between Cassel and Brady twice a year?  I know the NFL would love it.|`|KNTofuxMaa	If Brett Favre had made a decision and retired, it would be front page news. I haven't heard anything about it.|`|KhBmlaefaa	I heard that too. He's also celebrating his 80th birthday soon. I doubt they draft anyone this year. The QB pool is pretty shallow. If Sanchez or Stafford fall I think they will go after whoever is on the board. If both are gone I would think they would go with Clemens.|`|DvKpx0Reaa	how do you know favre is not coming back? you heard that from ESPN, right?|`|6iuZEUhzaa	KELLEN CLEMENS  or  they draft someone, or they get kevin kolb from the eagles|`|MPDgKgIxaa	Kellen Clemmens    http://americanfootballtopics.blogspot.c...  http://americanfootballpredictions.blogs...  http://nflstadium.blogspot.com
Ln5XNno3aa	Until they do something to prove otherwise....I don't think they are over-rated...Scary...Not over-rated|`|V8yR8BU1aa	Nope, I wouldn't say they're under-rated.  They've been one of the best teams in the league for some time now... at the very least since 2004.  They just have a general inability to put things together int he post-season.  They haven't been able to get over that "hump" yet.      I think my team.. the Flames... are under-rated.  OK, i'll be the first to admit... I'm a bit of a homer.  But look at their record?  Look at the point spread between them and Detroit, and them and the second place team in the NW..... pretty incredible considering they were only squeaking by last year.  I asked everyone how they would do... lots of folks said they'd either miss the playoffs or come in 7th or 8th!  Now that is a team being under-rated.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	I'm quite happy that there isn't a lot of buzz about the Sharks.  Keeps the boys focused on winning hockey games.|`|9GzkVwfGaa	I though Pittsburgh and Detroit were?|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	San Jose...we've been to this movie before.  Great team, talented, fast, skilled...this is the year.    2006- up 2-0 to Edmonton in the series, and then they flat pissed down their leg.  2007- up 2-1 to Detroit and up in the 3rd period of game 4...why, what's that warm feeling again?  2008- 2nd round loss to Dallas    The Sharks don't need "love" they need to do the business.    Boston...good team, skilled, fun to watch, but that playoff pedigree over the last 10 years doesn't exactly inspire confidence.      They don't award championships in January (or March).  They're usually handed out late May/early June (about 6-7 weeks into golf season in my universe).|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Leafs fan for BA. Saved me some typing. It's only the second season that counts and these teams aint done diddly!|`|hFX5UQGdaa	sharks are a really good team but not over-rated|`|vbm7LTnfaa	The Sharks are like the under-dogs. I think that's why I don't hear too much about them either. But whatever, cuz I always go for the underdogs! |`|IRQFF1HXaa	The sharks are definitly underrated. Sure their stars are great, but what really suprises me is the play of some of the younger players, especially Setoguchi and Pavelski. Setoguchi reminds me of Ovechkin, he scores, hits, and skates. If i didn't know better, I would think he's Russian. Also, I think Blake is a good addition, even though he has lost some of his speed, and spends a lot of time in the box.|`|9ujT56Maaa	The Sharks have underperformed in the playoffs rather consistently in recent years.  Until they prove that they can win when it counts, they will continue to be undervalued (and rightfully so).|`|sVg0O0Jcaa	its unfortunate but they remind me of the Mets in baseball. strong in the regular season but choking down the stretch|`|LEQowzHCaa	I do...

AA11694178	You are correct, all guns that are chambered for the .357 mag. cartridge can safely fire the .38 Special cartridge.  The .38 is simply a slightly shorter cartridge than the .357.  All other dimensions are identical.  All guns that are chambered for the .357 cartridge are designed to withstand the increased pressure of that cartridge.  That may not be true of guns that are chambered for the .38 Special cartridge.  Therefore, if you could re-chamber your .38 handgun to take the longer .357, you could be holding a bomb in your hand.  It may not be able to withstand the increased pressure and could come apart when you fire it.|`|TvARYVRJaa	yes unless it is custom ,,,,,,|`|21bef845536547868b0d688917f58277aa	Yes, with less kick|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	You said revolvers, so I will say yes.  In the 357 Desert Eagle, the 38's wouldn't have enough pressure to work the slide.  But in revolvers, the 38's are ok 100% of the time.|`|9cpKYneZaa	With few exceptions, the .357 and .38 Special have similar enough characteristics, with the exception of cartridge length, so that you can shoot a .38 Sp. in a .357 revolver.    Semi-autos, if you can find one that actually does .38 specials (a true custom job), will not do 357's. And 357 auto mags usually do not handle 38 Specials. But again, those are custom guns and often there are modifications made to the cartridges themselves.    44 Mags can shoot 44 Specials if they are revolvers. Same issues though with semi auto firearms with interchangeability.    If you want a 38 caliber/9mm style gun that fires all versions of that sized bullet, try a Medussa. I don't know if they still make them, but that one digested every 38 caliber style round made including Makarovs, 9mm Parabellum, 38 special, 357 mag, 380 auto, and so forth. An extremely versatile gun. But don't try and go wild on trying to make the wrong cartridges work in your gun. That's downright dangerous unless its made for it.|`|6380221dbceb0381d89b54bd786e9f42aa	I do in my Ruger GP-100 revolver all the time; it's less expensive to shoot .38's when you're just plinking around. For deer hunting and home protection, I use my .357 reloads.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	Aye, it can be done. Quite well, actually.     And John De Witt's recollection of history of the .357 is correct.|`|wphUIz0naa	Yes|`|OAEuYZkZaa	The .357 Magnum case uses the same bullet diameter and weights as the .38 Smith & Wesson Special/  The .357 Magnum case was developed by lengthening the case of the .38 S&W Special.    Therefore, any pistol or revolver chambered for .the 357 Magnum cartridge can safely chamber and fire .38 S&W SPL cartridges.    Even if one may chamber a .357 Magnum round int a .38 S&W SPL chamber, it is not safe to fire the Magnum in the Special chamber since the .357 Magnum is loaded to 37,000 copper units of pressure and a .38 S&W SPL revolver is designed to contain pressures around 17,000 copper units of pressure.    Doc|`|h2KkiKK3aa	yes, even custom guns can since the only difference between the two is the case length.  only semi autos like the desert eagle can't do this because of pressure issues.|`|7royFhIgaa	That is true.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Yep. The .357 magnum casing is 1/8" longer than a .38 special so a .357 couldn't fit in a .38 special. Accuracy is not affected|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	Yes, 357 Magnum was developed from hot loads of 38 Special. Originally, in the development phase, there was no difference in the cases. A final touch was to add to the length in order to keep people from firing the hot load in the old revolvers. And since they headspace off the rim in the cylinder, there's no need for the case length to be exact.

KdhNCnEjaa	Its not that the teams they pick do not deserve to be there, but those that they dont pick do deserve to be there. Like Utah|`|LVjM9k8yaa	45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!|`|XLIjwvNXaa	lesser known teams do not bring in viewers and sponsors such as a ohio st usc florida. boise st deserved a better bcs bid but because of there market (region) don't have a shot|`|LjqoMHMJaa	It is based on formula.    I. Harris Interactive Poll (1/3rd)  Replaces the AP Poll. The first poll will be released September 23, then weekly through December 3. A team's score in the Harris poll will be divided by 2,850, which is the maximum number of points any team can receive if all 114 voting members rank the same team as Number 1. (Example: 2,850 / 2,850 = 1.0. If a team receives a total of 114 voting points, an average of 25th place, their BCS quotient of this component would be .04. (1.0 / 25    II. Coaches Poll (1/3rd)  A team's score in the USA Today poll will be divided by 1,500, which is the maximum number of points any team can receive if all 60 voting members rank the same team as Number 1. (Example: 1,500 / 1,500 = 1.0. If a team receives a total of 60 voting points, an average of 25th place, their BCS quotient of this component would be .04. (1.0 / 25 = 0.04.)    (Better understanding the polls: In both human polls, voting members fill out their own top 25 rankings ballot. Each team receives 1-25 points in reverse order of the way they are ranked. The 25th place team on each ballot receives 1 point, 24th place gets 2 points, 23rd receives 3 points... first place receives 25 points.    In the Harris Interactive College Football Poll and USA Today Coaches Poll, a team will be evaluated on the number of voting points it receives in each poll. The number of actual voters, which can vary and has varied in the past, is figured into the computation on a weekly basis in stating each team's percentage of a possible perfect score.    III. Computer rankings (1/3rd)  Six computer ranking systems will participate. The highest and lowest rating of each team will be thrown out and the remaining four will be averaged. The current participating computer rankings are:      USC was the best team this year but since they lost one game the BCS ranked them as 5.|`|fiaFQAWWaa	Only a little when it comes to the major media darling teams:  Notre Dame, USC, Ohio State, Michigan. Those four will always get better than they deserve. Other than that, it is pretty fair.|`|IIt2e7pJaa	The way the BCS system is set up, makes the whole season a beauty contest.  Basically since Oklahoma scored 60 in 5 straight games they got to go to Miami deservingly and got their @$$es handed to them by a superior football team. While Texas who did beat OU 45-35  lest we forget was stuck playing a game that was a lose/lose situation for them. As for Utah they were snubbed by the bad taste Hawaii left everyone. And as far as USC goes they lost to  Oregon state the worst of the teams that caused loses in the final 5 in BCS standings, (Ole Miss, Tech, Texas, Florida and none were the others)  Until there is a playoff me declaring a national champion is as credible as the BCS.|`|97Xy6pEGaa	BCS  ? Creates a playoff atmosphere throughout the season.  ? Uses the traditional college bowl games  BUT  ? Allows the National Champions to be crowned based on statistics and personal opinion.  ? Produces a controversial champion as often as it produces an undisputed winner.  ? One off game can eliminate a team from contention.  ? Smaller non-BCS conferences are at a disadvantage.    Playoff  ? Decides the better team in head-to-head competition.  ? Would be easy to implement using the current system of Bowl games.  ? Would create a lot of interest and excitement in post-season play.  ? Would eliminate, or at least limit, doubt or controversy.  ? The majority of fans seem to want it.  ? A playoff system seems to work just fine in I-AA, II and III.  ? It's the only fair way to decide who the best team is.  ? Adding another Bowl game to hold a true national championship game would generate millions of dollars.  BUT  ? Would diminish the value of the regular season.  ? An already-long season would have to be extended.  ? Would take more time away from acedemics.
XLIjwvNXaa	I would say just right. your average back|`|wYdHeAE9aa	i think he gets the right amount of coverage. RATED RIGHT!|`|xxtvhn5Naa	Yup... He's really good, but underrated.|`|8hIs3dHsaa	Overrated. He is an average back.|`|j3QosG68aa	he is overrated.|`|B8sJEBxTaa	He's a good player, but he is overrated. I don't remember hearing his name too often in the second half of the season compared to the first half.|`|0Fi9EANKaa	I personally think he is underrated. The Ladanian Tomlinsons, Brian Westbrooks, the Adrian Peterson's, the Chris Johnson's, the Matt Forte's all got much respect for contributing to their teams this season but Clinton Portis didn't get the respect he deserved. This is because his team had a disappointing season, when statistically he had an excellent season.|`|fiaFQAWWaa	Overrated a bit. He is a good back, not a great one as so many on here say. I've seen clowns on here saying that he is better than A.D., which of course is sheer fantasy.

THATS HOW THE STEELER PRETTY MUCH LOST ALL THIER GAMES THIS YEAR! AND THE CARD LOVE TO DO THAT! AND ALSO, NOT ONLY DID THE CARD BEAT ALOT OF GOOD TEAMS THIS YEAR, BUT THEY DID IT IN A VERY IMPRESSIVE FASHION! ALOT OF STEELER GAMES WER PRETTY CLOSE !!|`|mT1WYaKhaa	I think both teams have an equal chance in this game. I am going to have to lean towards the Cardinals to win Super Bowl XLIII    If the Cardinals can protect Kurt Warner, expect a Cardinals win by at least 10pts. I say 24-14 Cards!|`|AA10304847	The Cardinal defense can stand up to the Steeler offense, the question though is can the Steeler scary defense shut down the impressive Card receivers?     The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     The "us against the world" mentality is the other big edge for the CARDS, used to win the last 3 playoff games.....|`|rRE7ZDK6aa	I am sick and tired of all this Cardinal bull crap. People dont give that Steelers Defense enough credit. Dont get me wrong cardinals are explosive but the Steelers D will slow them down. Look the steelers has faced big game receivers all season long. B. Edwards, Plaxico Burress, Terrell Owens, Marvin Harrison, Reggie Wayne, Randy Moss, Wes Welker and Chris Chambers. So dont act like we havent played aganist talented receivers. Look at the list of receivers and tell me how do the steelers only give up 236 passing yards a game. Warner is old and his legs are not there. Woodley and Harrison will give him problems all game. Give this team the credit they deserve. They beat the Ravens three times. Look at their schedule and they still came out with a 12-4 record with a so-so running game. Their defense carried them here and their defense will not let them down now. One more fact since 1997 the stronger defense in the superbowl is 9-2 only two offenses that won over a good defense was Patroits over Colts and colts over Bears. Last year superbowl do I need to say more ok then one more Raiders vs Bucs.

Out of the west, the Lakers are clearly just getting through the regular season healthy. Nobody in the West really has the inside talent to match up with Bynum, Gasol and Odom.    In the Finals, I think the motivation vaults the Lakers over the Celtics in 6.|`|XcfgCOCoaa	PHOENIX SUN ALL THE WAY|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Do you sense the similarity 1999, the greatest miracle and road to the Finals in NBA history.

And, like that team the 2009 team have a lot of new players that they are accumulating to the mix.

ATV trails, like roads and bridges, require people to build them. The people who build them will be getting paid to do so. As a result, building these ATV trails may be creating jobs.    Your comments show you don't really understand the realities behind this. You're assuming that the building of ATV trails means unemployed people are going to be going out and buying ATVs. What about all the people who already have ATVs? And even if people are buying ATVs, don't you realize that it takes people to build them which means jobs.     Like I said, I don't know the details - or even if you are telling the truth. But there very well could be a valid reason why $25 million for building ATV trails could be a valid part of an economic stimulus package.    It's also possible these trails could be intended to mitigate ATV traffic in environmentally sensitive areas such as wildlife preserves or natural wonders like Monument Park.
8ZzzA70Raa	heel stretch could take maybe 2 or 3 weeks and a scorpion maybe 5 or 6 but this is only if u stretch as much as u are plannng to and you puush yourself you should go to where it starts 2 hurt and then hold that for 20 seconds to get a real good stretch and you will get further everyday. the best thing to do is 2 hold the same position for a long time not to keep pushing further n further|`|vtR5277laa	sooner than u think, probably about 2-3 weeks. dont over-stretch tho(you will want to quit really soon).    also a quick tip for a scorpion do your splits with the bases leg in front, and lean back, for front stretch do other splits and lean forward.  stretch your back too!!|`|SgYMKzqyaa	If you are stretching everyday then you will get it soon. I got my scorp in a week :)|`|23qMl5LXaa	I would say a fair heel stretch shouldn't take more than 3 weeks maybe 2 if you work really really hard and can endure mild-medium pain. A scorpion might take longer. I would say for scorpion.....a little less than a month. So like about 4 weeks? I am over estimating because I never practiced. One day, I tried a heel stretch and got it, and the next day I tried a scorpion and got it. I still practice to make them as best as they can be, but like I said I wouldn't really know. But I would say that thats a good estimate.

The mistake that many people make is that they want to go fast on their first time down.|`|mne7kd8Taa	Be prepared for a sore rear and knees - and try not to catch the edge of your board in the snow, you will fall right away.  Also, try not to panic, lean hard on one leg to turn, then the other as you pull the first leg around.  That will help you to zig zag on the slope so you don't go too quickly down the mountain.  Also, getting off the lift can be tricky since one of your legs isn't strapped in.|`|uj3TpkW6aa	dont go|`|LygV4VOOaa	strap a pillow to your a**|`|TqJk5cRLaa	don't fall and break a leg or die|`|wDJbbb2Iaa	Take lessons, I learned in a few hours instead of a few days like my friends did|`|8PtMvfzBaa	Make sure you wear clothes that will help you stay warm and dry.  Don't give up.  Stick to the circle slopes or else you'll be completely overwhelmed.  It's also a good idea to find somebody who is willing to at the very least not lead to far from you in case you have any problems.    Taking lessons is very suggestible.    All in all snowboarding is a lot of fun but learning can be a ***** when you're learning.|`|I2sELFGfaa	1. don't give up just because you fall on your ***/face too many times    2. confidence is key; half the time beginners fall it's because they get scared and do it on purpose.    3. try to get comfortable with both sides of the board, don't just slide down the entire slope on your heel side because you feel more comfortable that way|`|oij6ZrxXaa	dont quit, youll only regret that later      the pain after the first day is a good sign|`|FZkdh4sEaa	Its just like flying an airplane.  The edges where your front foot is when you are traveling foward work like the aeirolons on an airplane.  The edges where your back foot is work like the rudder and elevators.  When you are traveling backwards its just reversed.|`|SItDrRfsaa	When turning, don't be afraid to really get on the edge of the board, because if you try to turn on a wimpy edge, you will most likely catch your edge and lose your balance, and inevitably fall, so keep that in mind. Also, always stay on a slight edge; never go down the hill on the flat base of your board, because you will pick up a lot of speed and freak out (that's what I did my first time lol). All in all, don't get frustrated. Everyone learns, and everyone who can snowboard now went through what you are going through, so do what you need to do and don't be embarrassed. The big one is: have lots of fun. This way, it's makes it seem less like learning. And anyways, you can look forward to being able to snowboard like the seasoned riders on the slopes, and that will be awesome, right? Good luck dude!|`|ed1e958a74b3aff1204376a3d8dca2a2aa	take lessons and wear a helmet|`|Di8jT1f0aa	wear a helmet|`|kLU7s58Oaa	prepare to be sore the next day!

0Fi9EANKaa	Andre Johnson is without question an underrated receiver in the league. He's got both speed and excellent handling.

WpqwaqcQaa	winning is fun, running miles after school is training.    being part of a winning team is fun    beating your best time is a good day.    getting the school record is an accomplishment|`|60c1c3cd65f0c9deb7c8cdbb1a06ba1baa	Some runners actually enjoy the long runs.   But most of the high school cross country runners I know joined for two reasons: the bus rides to the meets and the bus rides back.   It's an excellent team bonding time, and when you go to meets more further away, you just have a lot more fun. :)|`|MVz2sETraa	Running track is like playing tennis: all the venues (track and court) are the same.  XC- all the races are different.   There's the challenge of beatng your personal best and of beating the rest, or of beating someone, anyone. (I remember one race in which I was far from the lead, just chugging along. About a mile from the finish some dude passed me. I stayed close and at the end, I returned the favor (hill training and the fnal kick, baby!))  You can go for a run anywhere and enjoy the scenery or street-scape.  You can run 'til you drop (Ask George Sheehan.).  And if you run in mixed company, stay in the crowd and check out those shorts ahead of you. That's it, I'll just hold this spot all day.|`|EfaQpsd5aa	cause it is fun, the running high. and if your better at it you seem 2 enjoy it more|`|fOMcLCCcaa	I haven't done cross country before, but I have ran a few 5K road races, and I do long distance in track..    it's fun because you get to challenge yourself, and work at getting new personal records...which is always AWESOME to beat! :)|`|TKNPveHDaa	It's like asking why diving is fun, or football, or boxing.  Boxing?  You get punched in the face.    Running is challenging yourself to compete and overcome obstacles and discomfort.  It makes you mentally and physically tough.  There is no better martial skill then running and not many people can compete in it.    I like it because it's my body and my will against everyone else's.  If I'm more determined, I can win.  I also like improving.  When you see times drop, you are getting better, no ifs, ands, or buts about it.  It also keeps me fit and I like having a good body.|`|AA10279646	They like it is the simple answer. There are a google reasons that a person could like running. It's like asking why someone likes ice cream -- they say it tastes good and then you ask why again. This could go on into perpetuity.  If you are a beginner it is really hard. Then after about a month, it gets easier. But running is hard for all runners. That's what makes it fun for me because it is a challenge.|`|tl3AHpIpaa	This girl on my team, Kate says, "I do it for the dolphins."  What she really means is the endorphines, haha.   Runner's high.     Personally, I do it to challenge myself and to build endurance for track. There's nothing like the end of a good race, either.     Why do people only question why XC kids like to run? Why do some boys play football? Why do they enjoy hurting themselves and others? Do they like wearing those shoulder pads and tight pants?     We run because we're runners.|`|0gtkUJawaa	I like the challenge and i love to push myself and my limits.    Running is pain; Pain is beautiful; therefore running is beautiful|`|fo2E0NOLaa	Running is so much fun. I made a lot of new friends on the XC team and track team. It is a great exercise that you can do for like 40+ years and the races are awesome. It has also become a major part of my life and it affects my personality. I'm usually upset,guilty, and sad when I didn't get my run in for the day. However, when I do get my run in for the day, I'm really happy, energetic, and most of all, proud of myself.    There's also runner's high but that's a completely different story. ;)|`|wFw0SlJsaa	Because the feeling of finishing a race is like no other feeling on this earth.  You can't get it anywhere else.|`|BWHLwPooaa	We are the tough people. Other people play there sports like football and think they're so cool/tough. We're the tought ones. We run because we want to get better. Everthing you do doesn't have to be fun. Think about it.

TH1fT6rdaa	The rhino is the better striker, and that will be the difference in the match. In their first fight (which the hippo won by split decision), the rhino destroyed the hippo in round 1, cutting him open below the eye and breaking his nose. The hippo was unable to even land a punch. Rounds 2 and 3 could have gone either way. The rhino continued to have the edge on the feet, but the hippo was able to take down and control the rhino for parts of both rounds.    The rhino has the striking advantage. The hippo will likely try to take the rhino down and pound him out, but the rhino has amazing takedown defense. His flexibility makes it near impossible to take him down. When he gets taken down, the rhino is still dangerous off his back. Not only is he a world champion BJJ black belt, he is extremely hard to keep down. Even the alligator said he has a hard time keeping the rhino on the ground.    If the hippo can fight through the rhino's amazing boxing and take him down, he will win. However, passing through the rhino's powerful boxing will not be easy. And, the water buffalo proved that the hippo doesn't have the toughest chin.    I predict the Rhino by decision.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Depends on what kind of martial art they have trained in.    Rhino will naturally have a better take down technique as they shoot better. Hippo is good with submission and ring management (as they can fight on dry land or wet area too)|`|fRosDAZEaa	Original question.

AA10304847	The Cardinal defense can stand up to the Steeler offense, the question though is can the Steeler scary defense shut down the impressive Card receivers?     The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     The "us against the world" mentality is the other big edge for the CARDS, used to win the last 3 playoff games.....|`|DjjCvjlnaa	Steelers|`|GoWPQvgHaa	Why the Steelers of course!|`|qJDNIRjraa	The Cardinals.

60c1c3cd65f0c9deb7c8cdbb1a06ba1baa	Is this in a school team or a club team? And what level of intensity do these girls usually play at?     When you do a lot of cardio and running, it is important to get a sufficient amount of water breaks in between. In high school season, usually, our first 3-5 days of season consisted of 80% conditioning and 20% ball handling. This meant lots and lots of running, squating, jumping, core workouts (sit ups, push ups, other ab workouts), and other things such as this. Our coach always made sure we had enough water to last through our 2.5 hour practices, but not too much. If you say that 70% of a two hour workout was cardio, that would mean almost an hour and half of it was entirely cardio. This isn't too bad, but as a "punishment" in volleyball, especially for a group of 13 year olds, seems a bit too over the edge.   Take track and field for instance. In track, we do about anywhere from 90-180 minutes of cardio-like activity (running and footwork drills, hurdle and jumping drills, flat out sprinting, interval running and such). For this kind of sport, this would be the right kind of workout, but of course, we have the allowed and sufficient time of water breaks and whatnot.   But for volleyball, doing track-like workouts would be to the extreme side, especially for a group of 13 year old girls. Even in high school season, our punishment was nowhere near as intense. We usually just had to spend 30 minutes doing hard sprints, jumping lunges, wall touches, and whatnot, and we'd get back to playing ball for the rest of the time.     If the coach doesn't agree that this "punishment" seems too extreme, you should talk to the athletic or club director about this. Athletes are dedicated to their sport and should take their punishment acceptingly if they deserve it, but it seems as if this punishment went too far.|`|tTiE9R0Aaa	The only time I have every worked any of my club girls nearly that hard  (and this was a 17's elite club team) was when the entire team decided to have a sleepover at the captain's house, all showed up 30 minutes late for their reffing duties (we reffed the first game), put the entire tournament behind schedule, played like crap the entire day,  then came to practice the next night acting like it was no big deal and blew it off when I had originally attempted to discipline them. They did a 30 minute run, 15 minutes jump roping, 5 minutes of the dot drill, 20 block sets, and some other exercises (planks, push ups and sit ups) I use it as an example for all of my teams and let them know how important responsibility is, and how it won't be taken lightly. 2 hours for dropping a ball is completely ridiculous. If it's a club team, I would definitely go to the director, or if it's a school team I would go to the athletic director/principal, that is completely inexcusable and poor coaching.

96cbb3400adf35a5d7f3196ddae61ff0aa	You want to wrestle.  Cool.  You need a name.  Later on.    Ok, I remember watching an old show called "I Remember Gorgeous George."  The show was about a nerdy dude who wanted to be in pro wrestling.  So, he met an old wrestler who got him into training with the late Curt Hennig.  Curt told the guy the following: "I train 10 hours a day 6 days a week for 6 month to get ready for wrestling full time."    So, I think you need to start there.  He did squat thrusts, 2 man situps, 2 man pushups, and so on.  The guy lasted a few mintues and left.      I know it is a little different today, but you need to be in top shape.  They will try to get you to 'roid up.  Do not be surprised by that.  They say that only a few are juicing, but that is not true.    I had a friend, still do, who wrestler out here in California.  I promised never to tell, but he told me they all are on something.  Some are drunk, others HGH, 'roids for the rest.  It is part of the field.      Pro wrestling is a hard, hard life.  You are in pain a lot of the time.      But if you take care of your body, add 100 pounds of muscle over the next 5-8 years and grow some more, you will be fine.    By the way, some of the smaller promotions do not have those kind of problems.    Most of these guys bench 500, 600 pounds.  Several wrestlers overs the years, Ted Arcidi, Bruno Sammartino, Ken Patera, have held world records for weight lifting.    I hope you the best.  It is a job, remember that much and you can do it!|`|mvTc3GxNaa	WWE doesn't take much talent below 6'1.     But mainly you have to work independent circuts and build you're way up, maybe even landing in "The Farm'' (where WWE trains talent that oneday might make it big)    Search for circuts in your area...but you have to be 18 and get a liscense to wrestle in most states.
39j4ON6Zaa	for your size you definately want a 450, i would go for a honda CRF450R or kawasaki KXF450 the 2009 models have efi so coming off a road bike you should appreciate that. coz you want 2 bikes, maybe go for a yamaha yz250, a two stroke for something different, or even a quad if ya dont mind that kind of thing. the new honda trx700 is awsome. wishbone suspension in the back aswell.|`|WFxVuM1Laa	a 450 is what you want. all makes have em. kawasaki, honda, yamaha,Suzuki and ktm.

If you could find a used Honda XR 400 that would be a much easier to manage power plant and much cheaper to purchase and maintain. A 250F would pull you fine but you would probably need to go with stiffer springs front and back unless you are riding very calm terrain. I agree the YZ250 is a good option but only if you are a pretty decent woods rider, not so good in the hands of a novice.

Slowly, go up farther on the stairs until your legs are in a split position. Its really cool and kinda challenging if you do it right! Also try doing toe touch jumps. Try putting one foot on a bed and sliding your other leg out away from the bed, kinda like the stair one, but in your room. Also, before you do these, just streach those hammys.

Cr0wCMzlaa	I had something similer. The popping and tightness is probably from the fluid from the swelling.  The pain is your body telling you you shouldn`t be on your foot until its healed. If its hot to the touch then you have an infection. Remember your body will aways give you signals when you have an injury.     As far as what it might be. It could just be a sprain or it could be a broken bone. Mine was a sprain. Either way they are treated same, I believe. Stay off the foot , elevate, and ice.     Your doing the right thing in going to the doctor.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Go to the doctor(I know you are going tomorrow). I had a foot injury, on the bottom of my foot, and had a similar circumstance of delayed pain.   Hope you feel better and everything is OK.  Good luck!|`|AA11579568	Hairline fractures can take a while to develop.   I dropped a computer on the top of my foot and it hurt so I went to Urgent Care that day and got an X-ray. There was no fracture to be seen. A few months later, my foot still hurt really badly so my doctor ordered another X-ray, the fracture appeared.

3teWTOPqaa	Hopefully Andrew will help the Lakers to take out the Knicks next.

You could also try holding her hand while walking her home.|`|XLIjwvNXaa	well id nail her first and if i liked it maybe then she'd get a kiss|`|l6g3moiEaa	No. You go in for the kiss, you're going to end up embarrassed as all hell when she pulls away from you and looks at you like you're a new species of fungus.

Ucbnl7VJaa	yes you can safely fire any factory loaded shells provided they are the correct gauge and no greater in length then the barrel is chambered for.    Of course there is no point in using sabot slugs unless you have either a rifled choke tube or a fully rifled barrel. Traditional types of rifled slug are usable in a smoothbore but you'll generally get best accuracy with a choke ranging from cylinder to modified. Full chokes tend to be inaccurate more often then not.|`|U0Rvsabdaa	No reason you shouldn't be able to.

QTd8MVDjaa	Both kinds of tanks work with the VS1. HPA is better. It will give you more consistent shots, better for the gun's internals and works a lot better in cold weather than CO2. The only thing is an HPA tank can be expensive ($75+). CO2 tanks don't work great in cold weather (40 degrees or less) but will work well in warmer weather (50 degrees and up) and the CO2 tanks cost less ($25 or less). If you have enough money and sometimes play in colder weather, definitely get HPA, but if you're on a smaller budget, CO2 will work fine with the gun. Hope this helps!
8HmULotpaa	Level 7 doesn't have core skills and bonus skills and that sort of thing in Australia.  This is an optional level so gymnasts can make up their own routines with in the guidlines and it is run very similar to the international code.    For vault in level 7 they can do absolutly any vault they like from the F.I.G. code of points.  This could be a simple handspring or it could be anything like a tsukahara, yurchenko or anything there is no difficulty restrictions.  The vault table has to be set at 125 cms (5) and they have the start value from the code of points plus 0.5.  So a handpring in worth 2.9 (so the vault is out of 12.9) all the way up to the hardest vault which is a handsring double front which is worth a 7.6. (so routineb out of 17.6).
NdTy3twjaa	I'm not surprised, she always chokes in the big spots.  I like her but she doesn't have that mental edge that Serena, Maria and others players have.|`|75ZMWlnnaa	serena just upped the intensity during the key moments, and that was the main difference, also elena double faulted at the inopportune moments, she was up a break at 3-0 in the 2nd set, but then she choked =(, i really hoped elena could have levelled it at a set all just to get serena feeling a bit tight.    im sad for elena though, this was her biggest chance of getting to AO final and then maybe winning it, but still at least now she has reached the SF's in all 4 slams.     well she has had a great run so far in '09, i think she won 15 matches in a row before she ran into the serena today.    im not disappointed with elena, she has played some great tennis, but she came up against a very tough opponent in serena today. i am disappointed FOR elena.|`|GAsHsBEGaa	I am! I was sure she could kick Serena's fat ***. UGHH|`|lzVF1diNaa	i am cos i wanted her to kick serena out    i seriously cant stand serena williams|`|FYd1ndVxaa	Sort of. I really want Dementieva to win the final! She's supposed to be hitting her serve better these days, she's supposed to be more confident and composed having beaten Serena for the last 3 consecutive times. 8 double faults in crucial moments of the second set, letting 3-0 lead advantage slip away. She's shown a lot of results recently and is missing the major very much. It's also a little bit of luck that Serena has had from the beginning rounds through the quarterfinal. She plays greatly improved compared to the past several matches. But it's already a past, hope Dementieva will play steadier every next time. I'll always be with the demure off-court and fighting on-court Dementieva! Go for the French Open  this year! Or US Open! Or be greater and win the coveted Wimbledon!|`|2hjMFEUyaa	I am, goodness me - she had Williams 3 - 0 in the second set and then just pissed it away!!|`|agHUvyAtaa	I was so nervous for her but she double faulted her way to the bottom. She did attack some points but like Vera Zvonerava it was too late.  I was dissapointed for her but then she would be feeling ten times worse because she knew it was her best chance to get her first Grand Slam title. Now i don't know if she will have the chance......ever!|`|ob4rAvJQaa	i am a huge fan of dementieva and maria   and i was confident that she could beat serena  this was the last chance  i think she wont have many chances like this to get her 1st grand slam  any ways its bad luck!!!!!!!  and i think god dont want her to win a major thats all  me or you cant do much abt it  so just forget it !!!!  AND NEVER SUPPORT HER AGAIN

DAM IT AINT THE WORLD CUP.|`|Epmny08zaa	its not valenzuelas or memo "s fault,, all the mexico defense players coulve pressured the guy.....all the mexico defense were falling asleep, and cmon they only scored 1 gol??????? its not like if its a tournament or something ITS A FRIENDLY GAME?

tl3AHpIpaa	Sprinting spikes, any kind will do. They don't have a heel since sprinters run on their toes and don't require heel support.      DickPondAthletics.com has good prices, and if you order shoes from a season or two back, they're dirt cheap.     As for PV, I'm a vaulter going into my senior season and I'm going to buy some pole vault-specific shoes. They have a heel and the spike placement is slightly different. However, I used some Nike Zooms or something (sprinting spkes) for the past two years and they worked pretty well for me.
NR5LhOpPaa	I'm gonna take a stab at what is going on here, and I think it's probably more mental than physical.  You probably get to the line for your first serve, and want to really kill the ball.  So you hit it so wildly that you never land it in.  You get to the second serve, and feel the pressure of needing to get it in.  So, you start thinking about missing the serve.  So then you double fault, and get frustrated. You try to take it out on the next first serve, which causes you to miss it even worse than before...    Maybe it's not quite so exaggerated as that, but you get what I'm getting at.  You need slow down on your first serve and just concentrate on getting it in.  Then on the second serve, have some confidence.    A good way to improve consistency for both serves is to do a simple serving drill.  Take a few tennis balls, or some sticks, cones, or whatever else you might find to do the job, and divide the service box into three parts. One far out wide, one right in the middle, and one down the T.  Start with the segment near the T.  Take first serves at about 75% power at that section only, and serve until you get 10 in that section.  Then repeat for the middle and then wide sections.  You can do this a second time through for second serves as well.    As your consistency improves, start hitting a little harder.  Eventually, you'll be serving almost all-out every time, and making a good amount in.  This won't just help you get serves in, but you'll also have much better control over where you are hitting the ball.|`|8juUgSK2aa	take a lesson.|`|U83jqEJaaa	above all practice.     Get a coach or experienced player to have a look at your technique. and Visualize the ball , the path of the ball , where you want it to land. make sure you ball toss is fairly high.|`|aFxD3tH3aa	keep on practicing  you can work on you serve by ureself  take a hopper of balls or like as many as you have  keep serving them over and over and soon enough youre serve will be goood  make sure when you serve you hit the ball at the highest point  bend ur knees on the serve  some tennis classes, private or group would be good to  the coach could show you the technique and really improve your serve  hope these tips work|`|FYd1ndVxaa	Master topspin serve. Watch video online to get the knack of it. That's how I learn it. Here's a rough idea of how I do it:  1.Practice consistent ball toss  -toss the ball to the suitable height above your head so that if the ball falls, it would land onto or near to your head. Don't hit it. Just toss it. Stand with your shoulder pointing to the net.  2.Practice ball brushing and swing  -when u manage to toss the ball like the way I say, start hitting it. Remember to stand with your shoulder pointing to the net when u are to serve. Use continental grip. Brush the backside of the ball and when your arm stretches to swing, while at the same time you turn your shoulder and pronate (lean/bend forward&downward) your body. While hitting ball, jump more and harder gradually as you move on.  -the brushing of the ball is to make the ball spins; the shoulder turn and body pronation are to generate force to 'push' the ball forward (together with the spin that has been generated with the brushing of the ball's back); the leg jumping is to generate extra energy/force to the ball swing and pushing of the upper body.  3.Practice the placement and direction  -after u master the topspin serve, practice the placement and direction of the serve.  Watch video more. Scrutinize it. Practice it. U will make it better.

Currently Nadal is the world's best player but both Federer and Roddick were there too, at his age. But going by their entire career AND entire style of play, it's Roger. I mean, he has 13 Grand Slams -- more than Nadal and Roddick put together.|`|Bkzff34Haa	Rafael Nadal he is the one get champion for this year!.|`|6LRhRdxmaa	Federer has won more tournaments than ANYONE Tennis History. Nadal won't be able to sustain the level, because his style is too draining on his body, and will wear himself out in 2-3 years. There will never be another Federer again, because the game has evolved.. too much competition for one man to dominate.|`|XxIWPoIpaa	Rafa!|`|to1eqQzyaa	xiao wen your off your head, federer hasn't won the most in history sampras has, sampras won 64 singles titles, federer has won 57, and sampras won 722 singles games, federer only around 600. federer has a game which is easy on his body and effective, he will be around for years to come, roddick will be around also but his explosive style will see him come in and out of form, i would imagine he will shape into the top 4 again, nadals style is very draining and hard on his knees, he will last another few years on and off with injuries, at the moment i see federer as the best player consistently, with nadal being in form he is obviously the favourite and world number 1, but this doesn't reflect the real standards, there is nothing at all between them. roddick is behind both nadal and federer, but on his day can take anybody in world tennis and make them look foolish, his fast paced serving and powerful forehands are to be feared. between all three they can win the open, but federer will go faster stronger harder and better.|`|IN3wSxr5aa	roger  because  hes held more records than anyone else that u have mentioned.    btw, its gonna be a good match to watch if rafa wins the semis...|`|aGT6dtXdaa	Some have answered this Q based upon the total career. If that's your criteria, the Fed Express is absolutely the answer.     But then again, he's nearly 5 years older than Nadal. He's had that much more time as a pro to rack up matches and career titles. We may get a better insight if we look at how each performed at a given age.    Fed won his first Grand Slam, Wimbledon, just a couple weeks before he turned 22. Nadal won his first French Open just days after he turned 19. At 22 and nearly 2 months, Rafa already had 5 slams. The Fed had two slams at the same point in his career.    Many tennis pros already consider Rafa the greatest clay player ever; only Borg's French record remains to be claimed.     During 2004, at only 18, Nadal played his first match against World No. 1 Roger Federer at the Miami Masters, and won in straight sets -- on hard courts. Today, he's 12-6 against the Fed in all head to head contests. Fed fans claim most of those were on clay; Fed leads on grass and hard courts.    That's true. But, on the other had, many of those wins were a "rookie" Nadal against a "veteran" world number one.     By winning his first Wimbledon title, Nadal became only the third man in the open era to win both the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year (Laver and Borg are the others). Not to mention that absolute hammering the Fed was handed at the 2008 French Open where Roger only won 4 games in three sets.     Nadal's got 31 career titles, well short of Roger's 57, but significantly more than the Fed had at Rafa's age. So far at just 22, he's set more records that Roger has at the same age. (Will anyone catch Jimmy Conners who has 107 ATP titles with 147 total titles? Or Rod Laver with 198 titles including 40 listed by the ATP.)    Another very important stat -- which broadens the field to how well these guys played against the entire universe of tennis pros -- is to look at is their win/loss career singles record. Nadal (33778: 81.2%) and Roger (620150: 80.5%) are essentially even with a slight lead to the Spaniard.    You get an idea of how great BOTH Nadal and Federer are when you throw in past greats like Sampras (762222: 77.4%); Conners 1241277 (81.8%); Borg 597127 (82.5%) and McEnroe 875198 (81.6%) or Rod Laver (39299: 79.8%).    Here's what's scary. Nadal's been getting even better. Perhaps not too surprising as most pros put peak performance at around 24 to 26 years.     Remember that Fed didn't not really start dominating the game until he was turning 22.    How good will Rafa be in 2 or 3 years? At last year's Wimbledon, McEnroe analyzed the big improvement in Rafa's serve. "When he was 19, it was just a shot to put the ball in play, now it's a real weapon." No one sees Nadal as just a clay court specialist anymore.    To be sure, Rafa has to remain free of any serious injury to match what the Fed has done over his entire career. He also has to win big matches, i.e. "slams" on "hard" surfaces.     Perhaps the the real question should be: Who "will" be the better player?      Given Nadal's almost unhuman will power and incredible drive...and the big improvement in his game over the last 18 months or so as he's transformed his game to grass and hard courts (where's he's now won major titles)...I wouldn't bet against him.    Time will tell.|`|XL4aHe7Waa	nadal, federer, roddick  rafa owns:]|`|ZxWnYwKHaa	Roger is always gonna be the best , but in the moment Rafael.
M0IRADgWaa	If it's your first time you should have a thin under armor brand shirt, then a thin sweater, then your jacket. Your jacket HAS to be waterproof. You need long john type pants then something like jeans, then your snowboard pants, which also needs to be waterproof because you'll be sitting on the lift and when you strap in. You need a good pair of gloves and a hat. If you decide to pursue snowboarding more you won't always need all of these things. Sometimes I get toasty up on the slope and end up having just having a long sleeve shirt with a short sleeve shirt over it for my top. So for now it's best to have these things.|`|uj3TpkW6aa	clothes|`|v1oFID4aaa	I agree with KT for the most part but you don't want to wear jeans or tight pants for your second layer, loose fitting sweat pants are best for that layer, or else you might wanna just get warm snowboard pants and forget about that second layer.

AA11016927	Congrats bro!|`|d29M7lGKaa	The art of presentation !!! which make lures work
f1o6mAe1aa	Ok, to do an ollie it helps to understand the physics of an ollie. In reality you don't have to slide to get off the ground, you have to jump. Instead of thinking of popping, think of jumping off your back foot with your shoulders square, if you pop and jump the board should come up with you a little because it's a compression trick. The slide helps you level out so that's the next thing you want to work on. If you can't seem to do the two motions, then when you jump off your back foot jump just slightly towards the nose. 3 most important things: 1. Jump off your back foot and bring both feet up. 2. Keep your shoulders completely level, if the board is going in front of you lean towards your nose, if it's going behind lean towards your tail. 3. The motions are two separate motions, it's pop/jump then slide, not pop-slide.    To ollie while moving there is not much you have to change. Sometimes it helps to jump towards your nose so you don't have to focus so much on sliding.  Really just be confident enough that you aren't going to to fall and you should be fine|`|lmJlABpZaa	Practice landing an ollie while standing still... and I will assume you can already do that.  After you have mastered that then give yourself a small little push and give it a try... pushing more after every success.  eventually it will become natural.  Go skate!|`|3lS7FJDQaa	The Ollie is the root of most skateboard tricks. It is the jump of skateboarding. By popping your board and jumping you will get your board a little bit off the ground, then by dragging your front foot up the board to the nose, you will suck the board higher and even it out, to be even with the ground. This is usually the first trick you learn in skateboarding. Place your feet as follows: Back foot on the tail, with your little tow even with the edge of the board, and the front in the middle of your board. With the back foot, quickly pop your foot down and snap it back up. At the same time you are popping you should be dragging your front foot up the board. As soon as your front foot reaches the front truck you need to put your back foot on the back trucks and push down. The ground is coming so bend your knees. The key word is drag! You have to drag your foot up. A lot of people just slam their foot as soon as they pop, but you need to drag. Usually what happens is you learn to slam your foot down as soon as you pop. I can't say enough about this because almost everyone slams. YOU NEED TO DRAG! Another common problem is when you pop sometimes your board doesn't get in the air because you didn't snap your foot back up. You need to snap your foot back up as quickly as possible. This problem is easily fixable though. From hear I can't tell you much more. You have to practice, practice, practice. If you're still slamming your foot and not dragging, then you probably know that I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall or lamp post. You need to drag! If you want to get a higher Ollie, you have to pop quicker and drag higher on your board. Start small. Ollie hockey sticks, around 8 sticks are usually a deck high. From there on you need to stack decks because it is easier to put a deck up then to put 8 hockey sticks stacked up. A good thing to start doing is Ollie stairs. Like 3 sets and 5's and stuff like that. Try to Ollie of high drop offs and don't be afraid. Try it if you have a chance that you could possibly land it. Remember, the worst thing is not to try.

You may still purchase handguns that are not only the list from private individuals.  These purchases still have to be recorded through a licensed dealer.  Both you and the seller must complete the appropriate paperwork, DROS fees must be paid to the dealer and he (or she) will hold the pistol for the mandatory 10-Day Waiting Period.  You must also have a Handgun Safety Certificate (or qualifying exclusion), demonstrate your ability to safely handle a firearm, and provide 2 forms of identification as specified by statute.  A driver's license works as one and a utility bill (not phone), vehicle registration, etc. works as the other.  The dealer recording the sale will tell you what you need.  If the seller is unavailable contact a licensed dealer to determine what, if any, course of action you need to take to legally possess the firearm.  Failure to properly  transfer the weapon is a sure way to end up in more trouble than most people want.  Good luck.
