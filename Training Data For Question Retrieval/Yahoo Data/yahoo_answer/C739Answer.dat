ct6cfRMbaa	nessun passaggio strano  proprio cos che si fa. Comunque se preferisci fare una crostata classica di confettura non fai altro che seguire le istruzioni per l'impasto, stenderlo nella teglia abbastanza sottile (mettiti sopra  della carta antiaderente e stendila con il mattarello abbastanza sottile) , buccherellarlo (evitando di fare dei trafori) usa una forchetta o uno stuzzicadenti poi metti la confettura coprila con le striscioline di pasta e metti in forno. E' vero la pasta cresce un po' ma non si nota molto la lifferenza. Il tuo sistema lo utilizzo quando devo fare torte con la frutta e quindi prima faccio il fondo e poi la farcitura.|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	mettendoci i fagioli sopra la pasta non aumenta di volume|`|qb6zclleaa	no non  strano  serve per far cucinare la pasta senza farla crescere cosicch poi la puoi guarnire  io la carta oleata non la metto ci metto solo i fagioli|`|NQBqw4Xsaa	Se ti serve un fondo tipo crostata sul quale poi mettere della crema e magari frutta...ti serve che sia piatta e non lieviti in cottura diventando irregolare e difficile da riempire poi.  Coi fagioli o il riso metti il peso che la tiene piatta, con la carta impedisci a questi di venire inghiottiti dallimpasto della frolla.  Se devi fare una classica crostata di marmellata, metti direttamente questa al posto di carta e fagioli e cuoci tutto insieme.  Ciao|`|qjCyqGj8aa	E' normale, se devi cuocere solo la base della crostata per poi guarnirla da fredda, devi usare questo procedimento altrimenti la base si gonfia e si rompe.  Se invece devi preparare la crostata con la marmellata, questo procedimento non serve.|`|Yx73zECpaa	Riso e fagioli si mettono quando il ripieno della crostata non pu essere cotto in forno, evitano che la pasta gonfi.    Una crostata alla marmellata puoi cuocerla gi con la marmellata dentro idem alla nutella altre crostate (tipo frutta fresca) no.|`|yGhE0eppaa	servono da peso per non far gonfiare la pasta durante la cottura. se fai come dice la ricetta sar piu' facile riempire la crostata.|`|mCdHcfENaa	I bucherelli servono a nn far gonfiare la pasta, i fagioli a nn farla cuocere eccessivamente(e gonfiare eccessivamente...) .....potrebbe pure bruciarsi e nn sarebbe poi molto buona....ma cmq io la faccio senza....al massimo copro la teglia con carta argentata.......in bocca al lupo|`|PfAYOQYfaa	Mi sembra una cosa abbastanza inutile ... forse lo fanno fare per evitare una involontaria lievitazione della pasta, nel senso che i fagioli fanno da peso (un peso facilmete eliminabile anche a caldo) mentre la carta oleata serve a fare in modo che tu non sia costretta a versare i fagioli direttamente sull'impasto col rischio che ci si attacchino (la carta oleata viene via facilmente). Altra spiegazione sinceramente non saprei! Ah, me ne  venuta in mente un'altra: evitare che la pasta arrostisca sopra: la carta oleata, tenuta ferma dai fagioli, mantiene l'umidit allinterno della pasta evitando che questa evapori e faccia diventare troppo secca la base!|`|x9wnIIheaa	Serve per non far lievitare la pasta!
ae729aadca46161a6847ccb02c4a9e49aa	If you are talking about the dish curry,  it's a pungent dish of vegetables, onions, meat or fish flavored with various spices or curry powder, and often eaten with rice.  Actually any dish flavored with curry powder or the like can be referred to as a "curry" (i.e. lamb curry).  It's used widely in India, Asia and the Middle East.    If you are referring to the actual condiment or curry powder, it is compounded of such spices as turmeric, fenugreek, cloves, cumin, ginger, black and hot red pepper, and coriander.|`|3YRrGfkiaa	Lots of spices.

iD3vfpg6aa	i petti di pollo sono la cosa + odiosa da fare, come li fai fai (persino fritti) rimangono sempre stoppacciosi e secchi. prima di tutto la carne alla piastra con olio e sale  tutto fuorch calorica, certo, se ci metti 2 litri d'olio  calorica si! cmq x variare, i petti di pollo l'unico buon modo x mangiarli con piacere  farli alla pizzaiola, niente di che ci metti della passata di pomodoro, un pizzico di origano, aglio, pepe e un goccino di olio (x l'olio regolati misurandolo con dei cucchiaini, secondo i medici non andrebbero usati + di 5 cucchiaini da caff di olio al giorno x rientrare dalle calorie). prova almno una volta (io la mangio praticamente sempre cosi) mentre cuoci la carne sulla piastra, a metterci una spruzzata di aceto balsamico, acquista un sapore incredibile (ancor meglio se fai degli straccetti (fettina tagliata a pezzetti) con la rucola, il balsamico ci st da dio). altrimenti anche il curry (a me piace molto come spezia, poi non so tu), una spolverata sulla carne ed hai un nuovo sapore! tutte qste sono solo varianti x cambiare un p, dato che la carne alla piastra non  assolutamente calorica (magari evitaci l'olio), il fritto x naturalmente si. la cottura influisce pochissimo sulle calorie (a meno che non ci sia di mezzo del fritto appunto, o salse e condimenti particolari), dipende soprattutto dal tipo di carne, evita carne di maiale e parti particolarmente grasse, ma non devi per forza mangiare tutto al vapore!|`|1759630df16fda19a8846799638d8673aa	basta cuocere la bistecca (di pollo,di tacchino,di manzo,etc) semplicemente alla piastra (sai quelle padelle che hanno il fondo con le righe in rilievo) per renderla leggera....non ci aggiungi ne olio ne sale e la tua dieta  salva....a volte per varia un po altrimenti ti stanchi....|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	se ti piace la cottura a vapore, prova a fare il pollo, magari fatto a pezzetti dos cuoce prima e sembra di pi; abbina delle verdure tipo asparagi che depurano favorendo la diuresi. Infine ricorda che aggiungere olio crudo fa solo bene, perch molte vitamine sono liposolubili, cio vengono assimilate dal nostro organismo con i lipidi (i grassi) e l'olio d'oliva va limitato e non tolto completamente dalla dieta. Usa pochissimo sale meglio se iodato, e insaporisci con le spezie: sai si possono usare anche i fiori di lavanda essiccati? li abbini a spezie pi comuni e l'insieme  molto armonioso. Per le bistecche se proprio non vuoi l'olio, aromatizza con il rosmarino fresco appoggiato sulla carne in cottura, poi per abbina una bella insalata con uno o due cucchiaini di olio extra vergine di oliva.  Buona dieta|`|V22bcWQKaa	amore ti capisco ma  dura far capire alla famiglia l' esigenza della dieta    alla piastra cmq non  una cottura calorica.    per dopo un p viene a noia la bistecca grigliata.    il petto di pollo io lo inforno (15 minuti a 180) con una fettina di limone, sale e pepe, senza olio e sulla carta da forno. a met cottura metto un p di succo di limone.    altro metodo e acqua, cipolla, prezzemolo e aglio sulla fettina di vitello ristretta in padella.

Pse 50g de farine, tamise-la au travers d'une petite passette, et rserve-la.  Dans le bol du mixeur, casse 2 oeufs et ajoute 50g de sucre.

Sur une feuille de papier sulfuris (lui-mme sur la plaque du four) fais couler  la cuillre des tron?ons de pate de la longueur d'un doigt, assez espacs et enfourne pour 7  8 minutes.   Les biscuits dorent sur les bords et restent clairs au centre. Ils deviennent plus croustillants en refroidissant et se conservent 5  6 jours au frigo dans une bo?te hermtique.

IKD72nwhaa	Ciao,lo yogurt  un alimento sano,come del resto il latte...  Non penso proprio che con i quantitativi che tu dici,puoi assumere calcio in eccesso...  Non preoccuparti,ce ne vuole molto di +...  Mangia yogurt magro e bevi latte magro.  Sono alimenti che hanno giuste proporzioni di proteine,carboidrati e grassi.  Sono anche ricchi di vitamine.  Sono alimenti adatti per sportivi,hanno un buon quantitativo calorico,ma senza eccedere.  Se questo regime alimentare lo segui da un p e non ti ha creato problemi allora va bene.  L'unica controindicazione potrebbe essere l'intolleranza,ma non penso proprio sia il tuo caso.  Anche le intolleranze sono superabili poi,con prodotti delattosati.  Tra l'altro lo yogurt e' anche un prodotto facilmente digeribile,+ digeribile del latte stesso,poich contiene enzimi che rendono + facile la digestione delle sue proteine.  Ciao|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	beh credo che male non faccia, lo yogurt ha tanti fermenti lattici e poi non conosco la tua et, ma il mio medico mi dice che il calcio viene assimilato in pieno fino a 30 anni circa, poi l'assorbimento diviene sempre pi difficile e quindi  importante accumulare il pi possibile.

1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	una delle cose che preferisco al mondo...quello greco  di maiale, quello arabo  con carne di montone, o meglio ancora di castrato; in italia si trova al vitello o anche pollo ma quello originale  pi buono. Il migliore? Quelli di Istanbul, non nel panino ma in una specie di piadina arrotolata (questi si chiamano drm)|`|dFdJcCsCaa	x me il giovedi' e serata kebab!la carne e' di vitella e pollo(non di maiale x motivi religiosi) e lo preferisco con la piadina.e' uno dei miei cibi preferiti|`|CO7jjff7aa	Il tipico metodo di cottura del kebap  lo spiedo verticale.    La carne (solitamente agnello e manzo o pollo, ma mai maiale), tagliata a fettine, viene sagomata e infilata nello spiedo verticale, fino a formare un grosso cilindro alla cui sommit vengono poi infilzate parti grasse che, scolando, evitano l'eccessivo abbrustolimento ed essiccamento della carne arrostita. Il tutto viene quindi messo a ruotare vicino a una fonte di calore che una volta era fornita dalla brace sistemata in apposite griglie disposte verticalmente intorno allo spiedo e che oggi  invece  rappresentata da apposite macchine che utilizzano l'elettricit o il gas.  Prima di essere cotta la carne viene condita o marinata; le erbe o le spezie usate in questa fase variano a seconda del luogo e vi si pu trovare una vasta gamma di sapori del mediterraneo: origano, menta, peperoncino, cannella, cumino, coriandolo, aneto...  Il taglio della carne procede dall'esterno del cilindro di carne, mano a mano che questo cuoce, verso l'interno con un movimento che va dal basso verso l'alto per far s che il grasso sciolto rimanga il pi possibile sulla carne impregnandola e impedendo che diventi troppo secca e dura. Un tempo eseguito con un coltello affilatissimo oggi il taglio viene effettuato con una macchinetta elettrica rotante che asporta sottili fettine.  Viene servito in vari modi..come piatto unico(in genere trovi la carne,il riso,pomodori a fette e insalata) o al'interno di panini(dove mettono carne,insalata,pomodori e a piacere cipolle e salsa piccante..dipende molto dal posto in cui vai puoi trovare quello con la salsa yogurt..)..il pane era pane arabo all'origine adesso inteso come un pane simile alle piadine(io preferisco il panino)!!!|`|e95313ee9153066564706b3e80f9d5ccaa	IL KEBAB A ME PIACE TANTISSIMO.....il kebab originale sarebbe fatto con l'agnello...per se ne trovano anche di pollo e di manzo (non si trova di maiale perch  un piatto marocchino e i mussulmani non mangiano maiale quindi non troverai mai il kebab di maiale a meno che non vada a mangiarlo da un kebabbaro indiano....visto che loro non mangiano la mucca non lo fanno con il manzo ma con il maiale).....per la farcitura del kebab ti consiglio la salsa allo jogurt e se ti piace il piccante anche la salsa piccante con un p di insalata,pomodori e se ti piace anche la cipolla......|`|9rEGSjNIaa	si  buono,ma non troppo!!!  dipende dai gusti,comunque lo voto 7 e mezzo!|`|G0gQOvh7aa	PORCA EVA SE E' BUONO!!!  una delle sette meraviglie del mondo moderno... per lo devi arricchire con insalata, cipolle, pomodori e salsette varie...|`|dfygc0jYaa	a me fa impazzire|`|6WBIx5ofaa	mmmmhhh  delizioso, con salsa allo yogurt.  mi hai fato venire una voglia|`|haxBTRraaa	si  buono, almeno a me piace, una o 2 volte la settimana la mangio.

Poi io aggiungo wrustel, pezzetti di emmental molto piccoli, un paio di preparati per insalate, tonno in scatola,mais,funghetti sott'olio tagliati a pezzi piccoli e poi aggiungo la maionese.  ps la maionese aggiungila all'ultimo altrimenti in frigo secca il riso e diventa acida|`|32d713e0785ba8fa09c1826fe256a869aa	verdure sottaceto, tonno, olive e capperi|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	io la faccio molto leggera: mais, tonno  sgocciolatissimo, sottaceti, olive, fontina a cubetti, prosciutto cotto a cubetti, e se al posto del riso metto il farro o l'orzo aggiungo foglie di menta o basilico e un p di scorza di limone grattugiata. e naturalmente olio extra vergine di oliva|`|C7bEXkjEaa	riso mais, pisellini, parmigiano, wustel, maionese, quelli sott'olio|`|XJnxFWh4aa	olive, sottaceti, prosciutto cotto o wurstel, uovo sodo e maionese come se piovesse...|`|5u8ePQD2aa	dipende da cosa ti piace  io oggi l'ho fatta aggiungendo al riso pisellini , wurstel, prosciutto cotto olive nere mais uovo sodo e un po di majonese|`|ZzwSU9wSaa	tutto quello che ti viene in mente:tonno,olive,capperi cetriolini ,mais,pomodorini sott'olio,un paio di filetti di acciuga,gamberetti,surimi.Io amalgamo il tutto con pat di carciofo o di pomodoro un p di maionese Ciao|`|KNd4a6wbaa	prosciutto cotto..wurstel..mais..insalata russa sott olio..mozzarella..e tonno..|`|GAuz0cltaa	Ciao!   io direi di unire al riso tutte le verdure possibili (pomodoro, sott'olio, olive, fagiolini...) e poi uova sode, emmenthal e tonno.

Lessate il riso per 18-20 minuti e aggiungete lo zafferano.         Scolatelo, stendetelo su un panno da cucina a fatelo asciugare al forno a temperatura bassissima.  Scolate bene il tonno dall'olio di conservazione e sbriciolatelo; mettetelo in una fondina e unitevi il riso asciutto.  Lavate i peperoni, privateli dei semi e di eventuali filamenti e affettateli a listarelle piuttosto sottili.  Fateli rosolare in una padella con l'olio di semi, l'uvetta e le mandorle.  Quando i peperoni saranno appassiti, trasferite in tutto nella fondina col riso.

6YWHbf6Aaa	a me personalmente fanno schifo, compra dei limoni veri!!!|`|UvBBvGVtaa	Io lo uso per fare le scaloppine al limone..  molto buono!!|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	non  malaccio, io ne tengo sempre una confezione in casa perch se mi mancano i limoni almeno posso usare un surrogato;  vero che il prodotto fresco  sempre da preferire, ma il succo concentrato  comodo.|`|lNU9UpCvaa	nulla  come il vero limone spremuto...s di conservanti e di sicuro ha xso tt le vitamine|`|Qu0XMdZIaa	no, dai, restiamo al naturale, e nn usiamo queste schifezze immonde, il limone li nn c' ne sar per niente!|`|wtzg6Xdraa	si l'ho provato ma non mi piace molto...sa di chimico...preferisco la spremuta di limone fresco...|`|Abz1zou8aa	conviene lascir perdere. solo pessimo surrogato che di limone ha solo un vago aroma!!!  mia madre di solito compra un paio di chili di limoni, li spreme e li travasa in bottigliette di vetro per averlo sempre pronto. ottimo metodo|`|ZCM2M0pzaa	come tutti i prodotti a lunga conservazione avr coloranti ecc....  preferisco farmela da me la spremuta di limoni, ciao!|`|vcjwCkElaa	non l'ho mai provato|`|w9ILrMpQaa	Si  ottimo quando non hai limoni in casa.. xch si mantiene di pi, io lo uso x le insalate, x la macedonia e a volte anche x il th! Certo ha un sapore pi "debole" ed  meno fresco del limone xr  pratico e utile, secondo me  una di quelle cose che non dovrebbe mai mancare in casa!!|`|3YkvTBYjaa	Io lo uso spesso quando cucino...lo metto nel pollo arrosto, nella zuppa di ceci, nelle patate al forno e nelle torte al posto della buccia grattuggiata del limone..tutti esperimenti miei e ti assicuro tutti ben riusciti..te lo pu confermare quel mangione di mio marito :))))))|`|2EQFCX2zaa	Si, un po' aspro, ma...|`|dpFhG8Khaa	io  palermitana doc adesso vivo in prov di milano e nn avendo limoni freski a disposizione ( nn mi fido a comprarli e poi nn avranno mai il sapore dei limoni della mia campagna del tutto naturali) compro il succo di limone certo  normale nn  come il limone fresco ma devo dire ke nn mi sono poi trovata cosi' male!!!io lo compro anke all' LD !!!|`|H7cDciqxaa	io l'ho provato, se lo tieni parecchio in frigo perde sapore... moooooooolto meglio il limone vero!|`|XpD1ZzVuaa	ma tu dici tippo succo di frutta al limone ?|`|TWAwadxyaa	mai provato! e buono?|`|OLo3t1Thaa	bl sar trp acido...XD|`|UHXkN440aa	Sono buonissimi, specialmente quando vedi sull'etichetta che neanche il 5%  limone. L'unico buono  lemon soda, se vedi ci sono pure i residui sotto, non  perch  scaduto, ma  perch  fatto con il limone diversamente dagli altri!CIAO ;-)|`|YT9l6IXAaa	provati... perche pensavo di trovarli piu pratici...e in effetti li sono...pero il gusto  ancora piu acido, contengono concervanti, e perdono la vitamina C contenuta nel limone che  tanto importante... quindi perche utilizzare una sostanza acidula che non contiene piu le sue proprieta?  utilizzo ancora il limone!!!|`|MpPG59hgaa	S io lo uso sempre.  molto pi facile da usare per ricette che chiedono un p di limone di quanto sia usare i limoni veri (che poi non mi capita di avere sempre in casa) Se tagli un limone per un paio di goccie poi il resto va a male, mentre con la bottiglietta puoi usarne solo un p, rimettere la bottiglia nel frigo e usarla un altro mille volte.     A me piace, e te lo consiglio!!|`|YaXHRRSOaa	secondo me, vale la pene avere sempre un paio di limoni freschi in casa... la cosa migliore e soprattuto + genuina...e poi non hanno mai lo stesso sapore del limone appena spremuto!!!!|`|X164WIaIaa	blaaaaaaa....ha un nn so che di medicinale(saranno i coloranti e i conservanti?! :-)) ti consiglio i limoni freschi che in media durano pure di pi...il succo una volta aperto max 3 gg e va buttato....|`|OZ4BchUVaa	Pessimo...ha un sapore di "chiuso" "stanto" .  W i limoni freschi|`|zKNWOcpGaa	ciao! io ne tengo una bottiglietta in frigo per emergenza, ma prendo solo 1 tipo, ha una bottiglietta di vetro con il manico ad anello, il tappo e l'etichetta sono verdi, non ricordo la marca in questo momento. non  male, tra i vari che ho provato, ma ripeto: solo come emergenza!!  ti suggerisco una cosa in alternativa, lo faccio anch'io ed  meglio. compri molti limoni, li spremi, poi prendi quelle formine per fare il ghiaccio e le riempi con il succo di limone, le congeli, e ogni volta che ti serve ne prendi un cubetto, cos avrai il tuo succo di limone gi pronto se non hai tempo o se non hai limoni in casa.  comunque qualche limone in casa non va mai male averlo,  vero che quando lo tagli si rovina presto in frigo per  anche un ottimo assorbi-odori naturale per il frigo oppure passato sulle mani aiuta a togliere le macchie di altri cibi (tipo se hai pulito i carciofi, x esempio) e nutre la pelle (difatti ci sono anche delle creme x le mani al limone), grattugi la buccia e ci insaporisci una crema o un risotto o una pasta... insomma, ne trovi tanti di usi per il ns. buon limone!!  scusa le divagazioni! ciao!!|`|c7zgdJonaa	sai c' anche quello di melone|`|JlC28lvRaa	Usato come condimento alle pietanze  favoloso

QueenOfSockPuppets|`|pjumSgiGaa	olio di semi come tutti i ristoranti (anke quelli italiani) cosi risparmiano|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	usano l'olio di semi che non copre i sapori. Vi ricordo che i gatti, ahim si mangiano anche in italia, e anche da noi te lo spacciano per altro (coniglio); inoltre si parla tanto di igiene...forse perch non vi ricordate (o non sapete) della chiusura nel 2004 di Savini, uno dei pi rinomati ristoranti di milano in pieno (pienissimo) centro; si fa presto a puntare il dito verso gli altri per nascondere il razzismo che c' in alcune persone; dico semplicemente: se non conoscete o non volete proprio conoscere, dite semplicemente non lo so.|`|f1C7B3CEaa	olio di cane!!

Certo una buona pasta al pesce mi soddisfa molto di pi rispetto ad un risotto ai fiori di zucca che comunque  buonissimo.  Non bisogna dimenticare che con il riso si fanno le arancine siciliane. Che buone che sono!   Comunque preferisco la pasta. perch  pi nutriente e mi da pi senso di saziet, cosa che il riso pur lasciandomi soddisfatto non mi da. A mio parere il riso e la pasta vanno a pari merito. Inoltre come la pasta in Italia e da qualche anno nel resto dell'occidente sta prendendo una posizione fondamentale nella piramide alimentare, il riso  un alimento fondamentale di molti paesi d'oriente. Infatti fino a pochi decenni fa gli abitanti dei ceti pi bassi della Cina vivevano di Riso. Ancora oggi molti paesi asiatici vivono fondamentalmente di riso.|`|eaG1bvjCaa	pasta decisamente !

Utilizzo come base o della ricotta (io preferisco di pecora ma va bene anche di mucca) o del tofu (il "formaggio" di soia che trovi nei negozi di alimenti biologici") che  l'alternativa per chi non digerisce il formaggio.  Ne preparo varie versioni:  - alle erbe , pi facile d'estate perch utilizzo erbe aromatiche come timo, maggiorana, basilico in proporzione variabile anche a seconda dei tuoi gusti.  Aggiungo un po' d'aglio (circa mezzo spicchio per una tazza di ricotta o un panetto di tofu) e delle noci (4/5 almeno).  Metto nel minimiper (il tritatutto elettrico) prima le erbe lavate ed asciugate bene (calcola un 3 cucchiai di erbe a pezzetti), le noci e l'aglio. Aggiungo un po' di sale e trito il tutto a lungo. Solo alla fine aggiungo la ricotta (altrimenti non riesci a tritare bene le erbe) e continuo a tritare fino ad ottenere una crema densa (se la ricotta  molto asciutta potresti dover aggiungere un filino di latte).  Controlla se va bene di sale e se vuoi puoi aggiungere a tuo gusto una grattatina di noce moscata o del pepe.    Un'altra variante la preparo unendo alla ricotta della mortadella a cui tolgo il grasso, dell'erba cipollina e sempre un pochino d'aglio.  Trita sempre prima di tutto l'erba cipollina lavata e asciugata con l'aglio e poi aggiungi prima la mortadella e solo alla fine la ricotta.  Aggiusta di sale.    Un'altra versione prevede del tonno al posto della mortadella, gli altri ingredienti rimangono invariati.    (riguardo alla quantit di mortadella e tonno dipende da quanto vuoi che il pat risulti saporito. Per la solita tazza di ricotta direi almeno un paio di fette erte di mortadella o una scatoletta di tonno da 80 gr. possibilmente all'olio di oliva, sgocciolato!)|`|CAJkyI6taa	fai della salsa alle olive,frulli delle olive cn un p di olio e se vuoi qualche aroma,oppure delle salse al formaggio frulli del filadelfia con un filo d'olio e pomodori,oppure basilico,oppure salmone,in modo da creare tante salsine diverse,per le dosi fai ad occhio,dipende da quanti crostini devi fare.|`|YSDGAJXCaa	fai una salsa con maionese tonno panna e limoncello qualche goccia. e che te magni...,

I don't understand that...for one thing there is no "survival instinct" involved in eating meat, quite the opposite since gorging on flesh can lead to sickness and obesity, and even if there were, how is that the only reason for living?|`|AA12334360	Once the confusion caused by fear, panic, dehydration, hunger and fainting fits set in no one can honestly say what they would do.    Many people wold like to think they wouldn't eat it, but who knows how we'd behave in such a situation, no one can honestly say with any certainty.|`|kQSSz2X2aa	Yep. In a survival situation I would eat my dog (if I had one).  I would also try dog meat in Korea or somewhere similar where it is a common food. I put a different value on the life of an animal and the life of a person. I have no problems eating the meat of cows, pigs, chickens, and fish, so I don't see any problem with eating dog meat. It just isn't as common here in the west. Also, I am a pet person (I just don't have a dog right now because of my apartment).|`|NNiN0tK0aa	I would never in a million years kill him.  If a human or dog were already dead, who knows?  Nobodys knows what they'd do when starving.  My Great Uncle was starving in Japan during World War 2.

He didn't believe God could possibly exist when terrible things like that happen.  This isn't God's world though....heaven is, and things like that don't happen in heaven.  This world is full of evil.|`|p5hvth7zaa	Although I dont argree with eating meat,  i would eat my dog..Slowly..a little everyday    If I don't eat him, and he doesn't eat me..

And yes-eat the dog, so that you can possibly survive and the dogs death would not be for nothing.|`|J54q2aVtaa	I'm vegetarian and I don't have a dog.  However to answer your question, yes, I would eat my dog.  Especially if it died already as you posted in the details.|`|b9wICW1Paa	Great hypothetical question, but not one that those who have never been starving can answer objectively.  I can clearly state that if it comes down to me or the dog, you can bet that Fido will be on the menu.  That is, of course, if he doesn't tear my throat out first and dine on my innards.    As others have said, when it comes down to survival, our ingrained moral notions will be tossed aside.  Just about anyone will consider eating something they would not have even thought about previously when starving, including other human beings.  You need look no further than the Donner expedition of the 1840s in California, or the Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 crash in the Andes Mountains to find examples of such.    So to answer your question - yes, the dog is dinner.|`|7ad7b6a92f7e7ce5b8737b84ca7924ecaa	I probably would. I don't eat meat now because there is no need to. I don't want an animal to die just because I think it tastes good. But if I were lost in the desert and eating my dog would allow me to survive, I would eat him. I would be horribly upset, but I wouldn't want to die. At least I think I would eat him... I'm not sure how I'd kill him..or if I could...or if he wouldn't kill and eat me first..|`|PBBkky3Faa	No i wouldn't eat it, even if it was dead.

dpYpY6qmaa	Hi Richard,      I would use Mao Tai in the same manner as other strong distilled spirits.  That is, I would use it sparingly as a flavoring combined with other ingredients rather than a primary ingredient in a dish or as a marinade.        Here's a recipe for Shrimp with Gin that might make a good test recipe for Mao-Tai.  The ginger and garlic in the recipe should stand up nicely to the herbal flavors Mao-Tai bring (I remember it as being rather herbal/spicy when I tried it years ago in Wuhan).    SHRIMP WITH GIN     1/2 lb. shrimp in shells  1 tbsp. peanut or canola oil  2 tsp. salt  3 cloves garlic, sliced  1 tsp. fresh grated ginger  1 tbsp. soy sauce  2 tbsp. gin (replace with a similar amount of Mao-Tai)    Heat wok until hot; add oil, garlic, and salt. Drop in shrimp and cook a moment. Add ginger and cook until shrimp changes color. When shrimp are cooked to your taste add soy and gin (Mao-Tai) to pan. Turn off heat and put on a lid. Serve while hot.      Best of luck!

dpYpY6qmaa	Hi Kranthi,    Basically, the difference in the flours you are asking about is the protein or "gluten" level.      All purpose flour is just that, a flour with balanced levels of starch and gluten that is suitable for most tasks.      High Gluten flour is often called Bread Flour.  It's useful for making breads because gluten is what gives the baked bread it's "chewiness" and crust.   Low Gluten flours  have low protein content.  They make poor bread, but very tender baked goods (which is why its often called "Cake flour").    Dumpling flour is wheat starch.  All of the gluten has been removed from the product.  It cannot be used for bread or cakes but is perfect for the paper-thin doughs used for a good Chinese dumpling.    Hope this helps a little! :)|`|bnJPvsVWaa	I don't know about the dumpling flour, but I was just asking a baker about this the other day.    I was trying to make better home made breads and pizza crusts.  I'm told that adding wheat gluten to regular all-purpose flour gives it more protein, which apparently makes a better, more elastic bread.  They also make a flour called "better for breads," which has a higher gluten content.    Dumpling flour?   (shrug)

FicyC2TXaa	As long as your work is fine, they can't get rid of you for being a vegan. There are people who don't eat certain meats or any meat for religious reasons, and your workplace would not be allowed to exclude Hindus, Jews, Muslims, Rastafarians etc from employment.    Tell them the truth. You can make it clear you are fine with the cooking or serving, but that you can't eat the food yourself.     And don't be put off by anyone who tells you a vegan shouldn't be working there; work is work, vegans live in the real world and putting a roof over your head and food on the table comes first|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Hey they shouldn't make you eat the food. I worked in a place that served a lot of meat and they never tried to make me eat it. The other workers there can tell you what to recommend and what they like, and you can pass that on to your customers. If you're a good employee they would be crazy not to keep you, especially for the reason that you are vegan. If they won't understand, maybe you could tell them you're on a diet, or you have an allergy. I always told people I'm a vegetarian if it came up, very nicely and nonchalantly, and 99% of the time they were mature and understanding enough. They teased me a little but it was just good fun and I laughed with them, no big deal. Good luck.|`|iXx9SWceaa	Most people would just be understanding. They might of course ask the age old question of What Do You Eat? and How Do You Go Without Meat?, but they'll stop treating you like a museum display soon enough, and ask you to maybe sample something that's not meat. Or maybe they might think it would be good for business to have you prepare a few vegan dishes, in a small vegan part of the menu, it wouldn't have to take over the whole thing either.     Good luck. You have a lot of people rooting for you.... So when you're done you should tell us how it went!|`|vKvNDPbDaa	i don't think you have a choice.  you have to tell them your vegan, but let them know that it doesn't affect you preparing and serving meat delicious meat meals.  that you don't intend on projecting your personal beliefs onto customers or staff.  explain this is your life choice and that you wont let it interfere with you doing a professional job that you love.  good luck:)|`|909476bee458f21159530ec489fd5173aa	Hi NG,  Good question,again.  Lucky you.  Someone is here to win another 10 points,and help you win too.    You could just easily take a few very small mouthfuls.  And also even spit it out,each time,for the same reason a wine taster does.  Wine tasters don't swallow, so that their taste buds aren't affected by each different wine that they taste test.  You could even do it without having to tell any lies/fibs/bs.  Just have a cup to spit them into.  You didn't buy the meat,so you didn't help to financially support the meat industry.  Your diet preferences are your private life,so they don't have a right to know.  Just relax when you take those very very small mouthfuls.  If everything doesn't turn out as you planned,just keep cool and do your best.  You could use the situation to practice your acting skills.    You have the support of about 6 people,at least.  Which is a lot more than the other meat head staff have.    After the taste test,leave your comments on this question,so we can follow the drama.    Try and fail,but don't fail to try.    Dr Douglas Graham's website has great FAQ.    PS : They want you to taste it.  They don't want you to eat it.  Taste it and say 'mmm,yeah,that is good(good for loser meat heads/environmental destruction)'.|`|J54q2aVtaa	Ok, I am in a similar situation as yourself.    Start out by saying you don't eat meat for "PERSONAL" (make sure you say personal) reasons.  Don't go any more in-depth than that.    If they still pressure you, and if you aren't disgusted by eating meat, just take a nibble of each thing and let it go by.  The food is cooked and in front of you as it is, and what is left will be thrown out.    The point of being vegan is to not provide demand for these products, but at that point you wouldn't be either way.  Thus, if your job is at stake, just take a tiny nibble and let the customer know they all taste like BBQ sauce, as they all do.    Meat tastes like absolute garbage by itself, and takes on the flavor of what it is cooked with (exactly like tofu!  interesting...).    Point is, lie your way through this situation, because by lying, you are avoiding murder!|`|AA12250678	tell the truth,you may get away with not having to eat the meat.|`|shcsbtbYaa	Being your Vegan is your own right. You wont be being rude if you dont try the food. Im sure there are other people too that are working with you that can observe and give advice on the food. Many people are Vegan and they cannot be kicked out for working at a restaurant if they dont eat meat. If you are a Vegan then stay...Or if you want to try the meat, then I would reccomend not being a Vegan anymore. You can always tell them. They wont kick you out. Tell them that you love to work at this restaurant and have no harm workin but you dont want to try the food cause you are Vegan...Come on. You can do this! Good luck!|`|tRXTkzHzaa	You could turn into a ware wolf!  Dont do it.  Stick to your beliefs.  I Truly believe if enough of you turn vegan our planet will do much better, and I will be able to eat meat without worry.

361f27d7d9df5011e4d2f3f01c77d549aa	Brothers Robert and George French bought a flour mill in 1883 in Fairport New York. It burned down in 1884, and they relocated the flour mill to Rochester, New York. They named their mill the R.T. French Company. Robert French died in 1893, and brother George became company president. George (who developed the creamy yellow mustard) and another brother, Francis, introduced French's mustard in 1904.    George J. French introduced his French's mustard in 1904, the same year that the hot dog was introduced to America at the St. Louis World's Fair.    FRENCH'S? Mustard is the  1 brand in foodservice, leading the tabletop category with a 49% share, and by far, the most recognized mustard among consumers.

Chinese sauerkraut, made from shredded cabbage fermented in RICE WINE,    Most likely it was brought to Europe 1000 years later by Gengis Kahn after plundering China.       Although in Germany instead of using the wine they dry cured it by sprinkling salt on the shredded cabbage. The water is then drawn out of the cabbage to make the juice that you see that accompanies the kraut.     The Dutch , who were great sea-fearing traders used sauerkraut on their ships as it did not need refrigeration and helped prevent scurvy.|`|dM8EyL6caa	"Sauerkraut is principally a German food--the word simply means "rotten cabbage." Despite its German heritage, the sour, salty stuff is a staple in many other European and Asian cuisines. A version of sauerkraut stuffs pastries in Russia (piroshki), accompanies Alsatian sausages in France (choucroute garnie), and accompanies almost everything else in Korea (kimchi). In the United States, of course, it's most commonly associated with hot dogs."|`|16e730ba39930a9906b368149bb74bbfaa	Nearly every culture has some kind of fermented or pickled cabbage recipe.

By the way, the Chinese produce an incredible amount of the stuff!|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	I know it as a german dish although Korea has a similar cabbage preparation called Kimchi.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	Contrary to common belief, the basis of Sauerkraut DID NOT originate in Germany. It actually dates back to 200 B.C. CHINA where the workers building the Great  Wall of China ate it as a supplement to their normal diet which consisted mainly of rice. Admittedly, it was made with wine at that time, but nevertheless, it was the origin of today's recipe.    It is believed that Genghis Khan is responsible for the introduction of sauerkraut to Europe in the 13th Century when he used it to feed his troops during their  raids in  Eastern Europe. From there it spread to other countries including Germany, where it is now a traditional and popular dish  eaten as an accompaniment or used as an added ingredient in recipes.    During the making of sauerkraut, the salt used draws out the cabbage juice, which contains sugar which causes a fermentation process when  lactic acid forms. This is what produces the faint tangy flavour .    Below is a recipe for home made sauerkraut, however it is widely available in jars and tins. You can find more recipes using this ingredient on the main Germany Cooking by Country page or by using the search form.

doz7RIoeaa	No,"humane" is not applied to humans exclusively, it is applied to how humans treat ALL creatures. However, interpretation of how an act is "humane" has changed over the years and in fact varies from culture to culture. Not long ago, it was "humane" tp put people before the firing squad. It was quick, and relatively painless. But it was considered too brutal so they came up with something more "humane", lethal injection, But now, there are questions if the whole concept of execution is "humane".|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	The term humane was used to describe the proper treatment of animals for years before it was anyone though to apply the same standards to children.  The RSPCA in England was actually the first children's advocacy group.  So you are wrong.    Killing an animal quickly ensures that the meat is not tainted with adrenalin.    Simply hanging a carcass upside down is enough to drain the blood when the main vessels in the neck are cut, the heart is not needed.  And unless a cow is slaughtered Kosher or Halal it is killed by massive head trauma.  Slitting throats is only common for birds in modern slaughter.|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	I don't have issues with animal slaughter, as long as the animal is fully dead when it is butchered, and dies a quick, clean death.    I want to maybe raise a few of my own chickens later on, because I don't like to support the way that animals are raised for their products here in the US. Its really awful.    I also am interested in either owning a milk cow, or buying milk and an annual steer from a farmer in my area.  It would be awesome to have beef, milk, eggs, and chicken that isn't full of chemicals, and knowing that the animal lived a nice life, and was humanely killed!  I love meat and animal products.  I am willing to go as far as butchering my own meat in order to have it without supporting the atrocious meat industry.|`|nDOWKhwCaa	"eighty percent of U.S. agricultural land is used to raise chickens, pigs, and other farmed animals"    The biggest reason WHY that is, is because animals can be bred and kept almost anywhere where as it is awful hard to farm on hilly or mountainous terrain.|`|MpzPfzivaa	Okay, I get booed a lot because I am a Christian and happen to believe the Bible. But here are my thoughts on this matter. Yes Humane is the root for human, yes we need to take care of all human kind. The Bible says this is Genesis...That in the Garden of Eden there was no death, and humans were vegetarian. After sin came into the world so did death and the consumption of animals. However, God also placed on our platter the job to be good stuarts of His creations. This includes the animals. I can not justify the torture and slow death of an animal as being a good stuart. Most animals in the meat industry are severely miss treated. So the way they are slaughtered almost becomes a moot point for me. I will not support an industry that can not put the welfare of the animals they raise into consideration. To them it is only a product and they do not care what there life is like, after all, they are just going to be killed anyway. I live out where I see lots of privately owned farms where the cattle have a great life, they get to graze on hundreds of acres and the ranchers care about their cattle's well being. In those cases, yes the slaughter is the issue. I have to think of how I would feel if I was being slowly killed by draining my blood, just so I could be tastier. It repulses me.|`|s4WywJ8baa	God gave man dominion over all the animals of the Earth.    If he didn't want us to eat them... why did he make them so tasty?    People  Eating  Tasty   Animals|`|Ed8LtPLiaa	Look at it this way... eighty percent of U.S. agricultural land is used to raise chickens, pigs, and other farmed animals; seventy percent of grains are used to feed them. If the massive quantities of land, grain, soy, and corn now fed to factory-farmed animals were freed up, there would be plenty of food and then some for the worlds starving people. Is that not humane?|`|7ad7b6a92f7e7ce5b8737b84ca7924ecaa	"Marked or motivated by concern with the alleviation of suffering, showing evidence of moral and intellectual advancement.   Characterized by kindness, mercy, or compassion: a humane judge. Marked by an emphasis on humanistic values and concerns: a humane education."    Humane doesn't mean just treating humans well, it means using our ability to think as humans to feel for other living beings.    And no, slaughter hasn't always been the same. Animals used to have some semi balance of a life worth living before they were killed. Now they live in horrible conditions that no living being deserves. Also, animals used to get slaughtered in smaller numbers, so the person killing them was actually paying attention. Now slaughter houses work so fast the people doing the killing can't be sure every animal dies a pain free death.     I demand that you stop trying to justify eating meat to yourself. If you want to eat meat, fine. I'm not one to waste my time trying to convince someone with such an obviously closed mind.|`|J54q2aVtaa	No, you revealed the entire conspiracy there!

Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours or until potatoes are tender. Add cream cheese; stir until blended. Garnish with bacon and chives if desired. Yield: 12 servings (3 quarts).    Notes: I've used all types of potatoes in this, but love the red ones, and they look so pretty. If you do not have chives, or cannot find them, green onion tops are also excellent.    Great Poster's Notes: This is one of our family favorites and it is easy to add in corn or ham, whatever your family fancies. We absolutely love it. You can also cut the cook time by softening the potatoes by boiling them then adding them to soup.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    SLOW-COOKED PEPPER STEAK    1-1/2 to 2 pounds beef round steak  2 tablespoons vegetable oil  1/4 cup soy sauce  1 cup chopped onion  1 garlic clove, minced  1 teaspoon sugar  1/2 teaspoon salt  1/4 teaspoon pepper  1/4 teaspoon ground ginger  4 tomatoes, cut into eighths or 1 can (16 ounces) tomatoes with liquid, cut up  1 large green peppers, cut into strips  1/2 cup cold water  1 tablespoon cornstarch  Cooked noodles or rice    Cut beef into 3-in. x 1-in. strips brown in oil in a skillet. Transfer to a 3-qt. slow cooker. Combine the next seven ingredients; pour over beef. Cover and cook on low for 5-6 hours. or until meat is tender. Add tomatoes and green peppers; cook on low for 1 hour longer.     Combine the cold water and cornstarch to make a paste; stir into liquid in slow cooker and cook on high until thickened. Serve over noodles or rice. Yield: 6-8 servings.     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    PORK CARNITAS (Crock Pot)    3 pounds pork butt roast  4 garlic cloves  1 fresh jalapeno pepper  1 bunch fresh cilantro  1 can lite beer  Corn tortillas    Insert garlic cloves in roast; place in crock pot with whole pepper and half bunch of cilantro which has been chopped. Season to taste. Pour in beer.     Cook on high 4 to 6 hours until fork tender. Remove meat; shred. Serve in steamed tortillas with tomatoes, onions, cheese and cilantro.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    SLOW-COOKED STROGANOFF    3 pounds boneless beef round steak  1/2 cup all-purpose flour  1-1/2 teaspoons salt  1/2 teaspoon ground mustard  1/8 teaspoon pepper  1 medium onion, sliced and separated into rings  2 cans (4 ounces each) mushroom stems and pieces, drained  1 can (10-1/2 ounces) condensed beef broth, undiluted  1-1/2 cups (12 ounces) sour cream  Hot cooked noodles    Cut round steak into 3-in. x 1/2-in. strips. In a large resealable plastic bag, combine flour, salt, mustard and pepper. Add beef in batches; toss to coat.     In a 5-qt. slow cooker, layer the onion, mushrooms and beef. Pour broth overall. Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours or until meat is tender. Just before serving, stir in the sour cream. Serve over noodles. Yield: 8-10 servings.     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    PULLED PORK (Crock Pot)    1 day | 30 min prep - Serves 10     4 lbs pork roast (shoulder or butt)   2 large onions   1 cup ginger ale   1 (18 ounce) bottle favorite barbecue sauce (I like Sweet Baby Ray's)   barbecue sauce, for serving (optional)     Slice one onion and place in crock pot.  Put in the roast and cover with the other onion, sliced.  Pour over the ginger ale.  Cover and cook on LOW for about 12 hours.  Remove the meat, strain and save the onions, discard all liquid.  With two forks, shred the meat, discarding any remaining fat, bones or skin. Most of the fat will have melted away.  Return the shredded meat and the onions to the crock pot, stir in the barbecue sauce. Continue to cook for another 4 to 6 hours on LOW.     Serve with hamburger buns or rolls and additional barbecue sauce. Any leftovers freeze very well.     TIP: freeze ready-made sandwiches - a scoop of meat on a bun, well-wrapped. These make a great quick meal or snack. To reheat, remove wrapping, wrap in a paper towel, and zap 1-2 minute in the microwave.     Poster's Note: Shoulder or butt are recommended because the meat shreds very well. Other cuts do not shred as readily. It is a fattier cut, but the fat melts away in the cooking and is poured away when you discard the liquid.     Poster's Note 2: I have an older, smaller crock pot. The above times work perfectly for me. But if you have a newer or bigger crock pot, you may need to revise times downward, esp. after the bbq sauce is added. I think you need at least a couple of hours for it all to meld, but that may be all you need.|`|uVTosLc9aa	My favorite is super easy too! Just a plain old pot roast, beef or pork, add a little water, about half a cup. Cook all day long, then when you are ready stir it up with a bottle of BBQ Sauce. Serve on buns. Voila, BBQ beef or pork sandwiches. Yum.|`|0652e17f9d7b965dbf45d90fb460f124aa	http://southernfood.about.com/library/cr...|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Simple, cheap and easy.    One can of each, drained unless specified  corn   peas  green beans  carrots  diced potato  1 can white beans not drained  2 cans of diced tomato not drained  3 cans of chicken broth  2 cubes chicken boullion    Heat some broth in the microwave to melt the boullion.  Dump everything in the crock pot and simmer til hot.  It's all cooked, so don't overcook it.  Serve with fresh bread and/or a salad.    I do dried beans in the crock pot, but that takes a few days to finish.  Tastes good tho.|`|AA10985522	Crock Pot Recipes you might like to try:    COLA CHICKEN  (And more variations of recipe)  (My favorite: Wings or Ribs)    4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts  1 cup catsup  1 12oz. can cola (pepsi, coke, etc.)    Put chicken in a non-stick pan.  Mix together catsup and cola, pour over chicken.  Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat and cook 45 minutes.  (turning chicken a few times, while cooking...to prevent from  sticking to pan)  Uncover, turn up the heat and continue to cook until the sauce  becomes thick and adheres to the chicken.  It turns into the most incredible BBQ sauce. Yummmm!    You can double the recipe and use more pieces of  chicken....wings...would be ideal...add some hot  sauce....presto "Hot  Wings"!   I have used Ribs, just as good.     I fixed chicken wings, (using the above recipe)  but...I added the spices from a MILD (I don't care for "HOT") Buffalo Wings packet...(the kind you get to bake in the oven).....I thought it was really good.....(but you/I can't find a 'bad' way to fix chicken).    Also tried beef stew cuts......that was pretty good.....I can see  myself making this again.  Served over rice.....think the stew cuts would have been just as good over noodles.    Mushroom Chicken    4 chicken breast  1 can cream of mushroom soup  water    Mix a can of cream of mushroom soup with can of water.  Place chicken in crock pot.  Pour soup over chicken and cook on medium ....4-5 hours....or until desired doneness.      Stuffed Peppers for 2  (Can be doubled, tripled..etc.)    Mix together:  1/2 lb. Hamburger (or gr. turkey)  a pkg. of onion soup mix  3/4 of 1 small can tomato paste.  1/2 cup rice    Prepare peppers.....cut off top and take out seeds.    Fill with meat mixture. Place in an oven proof dish/pan that has a lid.  Place any extra meat mixture in bottom of pan or make a couple of patties & freeze for future use.    Mix remaining tomato paste with can of tomatoes (crushed....diced...etc. whatever you want to use.)    Pour tomato mixture around peppers, cover and bake in 375 degree oven for 1 hour.    Serve with cornbread or garlic bread.    POT ROAST  Your choice of beef or pork (to fit crock-pot)  1 pkg. dry Ranch dressing mix  1 pkg. dry Italian dressing mix  1 pkg. dry Brown Gravy mix  1 cup water  Put beef in pot.  Mix together all the dry mixes.then add water pour over meat and cover & cook on high 4-6 hours.  Until meat is tender.  The first time I made it I didnt have the Italian Dressing mix.so I added a pkg. of Onion Soup Mix.I have to say I liked that better.  If you use more water you might want to add more Brown Gravy mix. Was gonna add potatoes and carrotsbut never got around to it.       (Should work well in crock pot)  Poor Mans Swiss Steak  (can be doubled. Etc.)    Mix: 1 lb. hamburger  1 cup cornflakes  salt & pepper to taste  small amount dices onion  Spread in a square baking pan.  Pour: 1 can mushroom soup  1 can water  (combine together, first)  Pour over meat mixture.  Bake 45 minutes at 350 degrees.      "Canned Soup".(My Way!)  Whatever cans of veggies I have, that I like, in cabinet it goes in the pot.....along with all the juices in the cans.  Cook on stove top or Crock pot.  Enjoy!    Canned:corn....peas....carrots....gr.b... (any variety)...lima beans....wax beans....tomato (any variety)...potatoes (whole or sliced or diced...whatever you like)  You get the idea....lol.    Also add a package of shredded cabbage (cole slaw mix).  You can even add a package of onion soup mix.  If it gets too dry and needs more liquids....add tomato juice...V-8...etc.      "Corny Beanie Weenies."     Mix one large can of  baked beans (seasoned with brown sugar, onion, and bacon).      and a package of Weiners (all sliced up).    with a can of whole kernel corn (drained)    Heat ingredients, and serve.    It doesn't get any easier than this, and is suprisingly good!    P.S..Might put ingredients in a casserole dish and top with corn muffin mix.
ZDfdbEl9aa	A website that has lots of information and is easy to navigate is http://www.keepwinesimple.com    If you are looking to taste different types of red wine, next try a beaujolais, I think you might like it.|`|t0vuwuGXaa	Welcome to the wonderful world of wine!  My first advice is to trust your own palate before anyone else's.  Having said that, there are a ton of great websites out there:    This is a fun one, many videos on his experience with wine, and he has a great library of all sorts of wines (he also caters to those who are new to wine):  http://tv.winelibrary.com/    This site will give you the "dictionary" of varietals:  http://www.winepros.org/wine101/grape_pr...    Riesling technically isn't a dessert wine, but it can be made into one.  there are a lot of non-sweet ones, especially those from Alsace.    I wouldn't rule out any reds just because they aren't Merlot.  There are a ton of other great wines that fit that style, you just need to find them!    My best suggestion is to join as many wine clubs as possible and attend as many wine tastings as you can.  You can try a whole bunch of stuff and don't have to buy an entire bottle to try it.  Check with your local liquor stores or wine shops, and they should have information on ones in your area.    Have fun!    BTW, something else I wanted to add:  The Varietal is just as important as the region when it comes to wine.  A Merlot from CA is going to be different than one from France (St. Emillion for example) or Australia.  My advice if you are new is to start with California as they tend to fit the american palate the best.|`|RCsLrFEXaa	AA|`|EUd3HjFhaa	You should research for local wine festivals in your area. They do wine tastings of all sorts of wine for like $30. Or look for local wineries in your town.    Hope this helps|`|a5Y0nQf0aa	Wine spectator is a good website.

19da204b17b5b7cec2adfc4630aea4d1aa	Popcorn is a product of a corn cob kernel.  Corn kernels are individual seeds in the corn cob.  The seed kernels are produced from a mature ripen corn ovary when fertilized by pollen grains carrying sperm that land on each end of the long silk strands that protrude from the developing corn cob top. Pollen tubes grow toward each developing ovary on the cob via the silk strands. Upon fertilization the kernel starts to form on the cob...many kernels are seen on the cob.  Each individual kernel is justly called a FRUIT by the proper definition of fruit formation. (Fruits are mature ripened ovaries.)    So..sorry people, things you call vegetables may not be vegetables at all due to their biological formation. A tomato, pumpkin, cucumber, pea pod, pepper, rice,wheat kernel, etc...are ALL FRUITS.    Veggies are accessory parts of plants that are eaten. The stem of celery, the root of carrot, the root of onion, scallions the leaf/stems of the onion, potato a root, radish root., lettuce leaves...etc...    Many arbitrarily call anything sweet and eaten as a snack or dessert as a fruit....Veggies are served with your main meat meals..WRONG!!!!    Hope this helps....  Banjo you are correct, POPCORN (from a corn kernel) is not a veggie but a fruit!!!    Sammy!!!   :-)    .|`|NCmDeklwaa	It is a vegetable.

It is also a grain.    -----edit----    Keep in mind that there is NO official definition of the word Vegetable.    The word "vegetable" is not used scientifically.   So, your question actually has NO correct answer.    There is no such thing as a botanists classification called vegetable.    This becomes obvious with the often repeated question about the classification of a tomato being a fruit or a vegetable.     The question is constantly re-asked because there is no classification called vegetable to verify against.|`|g5Bx6MN5aa	You're the brains of this operation so you tell me.|`|DFXS4SB4aa	Because maize is a mutated cereal grain.

EPIELNBuaa	i go to AA. i am an alcoholic.  to me, an alcoholic is a person who needs alcohol to make them feel "normal". someone who can wake up in the morning and not feel like "themselves" until after a drink or 2, and someone who cant perform normal everyday functions if not intoxicated, like laundry, cooking, driving, shopping, etc. i remember the first few days i was trying to get sober were horrible, i could barely drive my car becuase i was so use to driving drunk every single day, driving sober felt so wrong and i could barely do it. an alcoholic just becomes dependent on the alcohol as well to make them feel happy. somethings n life may not be going so great, and we turn to alcohol to cheer us up. the bad part is with alcohol that you build up a tolerance, so you just think you have to drink more and more to feel the way you did yesterday, then it sneaks up on ya and u end up passed out in random places or doing stupid things. it starts out as just trying to feel good, and you have a problem when you realize you're drinking just to feel normal.|`|EUd3HjFhaa	When you wake up in the morning and want a bottle of beer instead of a glass of milk or juice!|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	I am one of the people who think that a drink everyday makes you an alchoholic.

Its like the coffee addicts who don't realize it has taken hold of them until they try to get away from it.  The people who have started to turn alchoholic do the daily doses of strong liquor, and show opposition to giving it up for a day or two.|`|AA12327015	An alcoholic is someone who continues to drink even after alcohol has a detrimental effect on their life.

These are all kind of general, and there are more specific guidelines out there, but this is what I think.

I think it is true alcoholism when you will do anything for a drink and get drunk every night.|`|o65klEwWaa	I don't think you can be officially declared an alcoholic unless your life is detrimentally affected by alcohol. For example, you can't function without it, it is affecting your relationships, it is affecting your working life, you are facing alcohol related illness and yet can't stop drinking.    I personally believe that every person has the potential to become an alcoholic and everyone who drinks more than a single drink in a month or two is on their way to becoming an alcoholic. If you can truely drink only occasionally, eg: once a year on your birthday or something, then you are truely not affected by alcohol at that period in your life.     But most people who claim that they can stop drinking any time they like, can not do it in reality. Whether an unexpected social event or a bad day or whatever, most people claiming that they can stop drinking will be drinking again within the week. But these low-level drinkers convince themselves that they are not at risk of being alcoholics and really believe that they can stop, even though they never have.    I think the best way for a low-level alcoholic to stop drinking is when they realise that their drinking could kill someone they love, such as when pregnant or driving etc.|`|h22i96g7aa	when you need it to function, at least you are convinced you do.
mSGG9UaZaa	I have heard stories about the infamous Redline. I know people who abuse adarol who think redline is even more intense. Your experience sounds normal compared to what I have been hearing. Most people drink only half a bottle at a time because it is so potent. I would be weary about taking a sleeping pill because their are some weird chemicals in Redline and I don't know how they would interact. (Redline is considered a food supplement so its contents are not regulated by the FDA). I would make sure you eat regularly and drink water to help you body process it. Besides that I think you just need to ride it out and wait for your body to process it.  Lessoned learned I guess.

If it's streaky when you paint let it sit for a minute so the alcohol evaporates a bit and gives you more of a paste.  If it starts to dry out add a drop (really, just a drop) of alcohol at a time until it gets back to the right consistency.  The alcohol evaporates quickly and allows you to paint.  There won't be a flavor left to it and you certainly can't get drunk off of it.

AA12031316	You can be CERTAIN that any lettuce you buy from Walmart is not only loaded with chemicals, but is genetically modified too (GMO).  The GMO process makes lettuce grow very quickly so it can be mass produced.  (pretty much ANY veggie you buy in walmart or grocery stores will be genetically modified)  If you aren't familiar with GMO, I suggest googling it-it will make you a believer of the whole organic thing!  What you were likely tasting is the chemical based antimicrobial spray that large chain stores spray on their produce to kill the nasty bacteria that they acquire during harvesting, processing and transport.  Commercial produce is often handled by many people in less than sanitary conditions, so the produce is sprayed with stuff to kill off germs.  So, the germs may be dead, but they are still on there!   Keep in mind that the more "perfect" produce looks, the less likely it is to be non gmo and organic.  The GMO process and growth stimulant hormone given to plant seeds cause them to grow rapidly and to look hearty, but they are, in fact, frankenfoods!  Do yourself a favor, and buy organic, but NOT from Walmart-they are known for labeling food as organic, when it really isn't)  A truly organic fruit or veggie will look less appealing than conventional, due to the fact that they haven't been loaded with all the artificial stuff that makes them grown quickly.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	If it was an iceberg lettuce they aren't very good anyway.|`|RZuIs1GQaa	yes that is the reason i do go to super wal mart i go to super jack rampas|`|fhyYh3Dzaa	You have two problems.

KeevlZnTaa	It is a good idea to do a little research and to be sure you have a lot of great recipes to cook. The first time I tried to go vegetarian, I didn't last very long. I had no idea what to make, and had nothing in the house b/c I hadn't prepared.    About a month later I tried again, but this time I had recipes planned out, and had gone shopping. After that day I never looked back. I now have tons of recipes that I enjoy. I quickly replaced old meat favorites with tasty vegetarian ones.|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	check out indian and thai food, there are alot of great dishes and lots for vegetarians..sushi is a good alternative if you don't mind eating fish, too..but if you don't want to eat fish (my daugther is vegetarian and won't eat any seafood , meat , poultry..), I have noticed that the finer sushi establishments sometimes have Excellent vegetarian rolls.   You can also find gardenburgers, and vegetable pot pies, etc,etc right in your grocer's freezer. Also trying grilling portobellos, and corn on the cob, baked potatos/squash..tons of alternatives..    edit..don't forget a good multi-vitamin..and you really need to read up on nutrition (or go to a health store and ask, they usually love to share knowledge)..the first time my daughter went veggiesaur, she was 12, and didn't like vegetables..I had to convince her that potato chips simply won't cut it. Fortunatley , that didn't last long, but as she got older , she still wanted to be a vegetarian. When she was about 18 ish, she did again, and this time approached it much better. She still takes the vitamins, but she eats pretty well and she's been a veggiesaur for 3 years now.|`|MpzPfzivaa	Go to these websites, I find them helpful.|`|29maScwJaa	I've been vegetarian for about 7 years. To some people, that is nothing, but for me, it's been my life as far as I can remember it.    I have had my own thinks to keep me on track. You just have to never give in, no matter what. It's hard sometimes. After 1 month, I was hanging out with my friend and instinctively bought a hot rod from our local store because we were so used to doing it, it just happened without thought. As soon as I took a bite, I realized what I did wrong, and I gave the rest of the hot rod to my friend and spat out what I had bitten off already. I felt really bad, and ever since then, I've never forgotten about it. The trick is to turn your diet into your hobby. I don't know, it might have been easier for me because I live in the middle of nowhere lol, but all I had to do was do constant research, because there is A LOT to being a vegetarian. You'll find animal products in things you'd never expect (Gelatin ingredients in things, for example).      So that is my two cents, it worked well for me, you just have to sort of "obsess' over your change, you'll feel really good, and you'll learn a lot about what you're doing, and it won't leave your mind again, you just need to be strong and totally selfless, and keep in mind that you not eating the food is for the sake of an animal's life, no matter how hungry you are.    You also MUST keep in mind that you will still need the proper vitamins and stuff like protein and iron are big ones... you can get that stuff alternatively from brown beans. The best combo that I am aware of is Beans and brown rice, because, put together, they contain every protein to make a complete protein. They also have complex carbohydrates which is important to good health too.     Anyway if I can think of anymore important tips Ill come back when I can, but for now this is all I've got for you, good luck and you'll greatly enjoy it! Yay, you're gonna help contribute to saving an average of about 90 animal's lives each year! :D|`|JPH16411aa	try out indian food... u'll have a lotta tasty wholesome dishes to choose from.... u wont really miss meat....  and ive been a vegetarian all my life.. ive never had any health problems... people who say that its not healthy, (like the guy above me)  are just too ignorant...

Just answered another question based on the same subject! I am a vegetarian and have been for a while now. I have a healthy (and very tasty) diet!   The best thing to do is to evaluate your current diet. Shockingly, nearly all meat-eaters have meat somewhere in their diet every day, which  makes switching to a new diet that little bit harder. Work out what you eat and then cut out the meat of that dish and add another ingredient.    For example:   Current diet: Chips, Egg, Sausage and Beans.   Veg diet: Chips, Egg, Beans (maybe bread and butter on the side!)     Current diet: Jacket Potato with corned beef.   Veg diet: Jacket Potato with cheese and beans.     I know those are poor examples, but you get the idea. It just shows you can have a good, tasty diet (maybe not even much different from the one you have now) minus the meat.     It may take a while to get used to - Goodluck! :-)     Michelle|`|1onb5QDaaa	take it slow, girl! even if you slip sometimes and treat yourself to a burger or pizza, don't stop! just start over the next day!  make sure your fridge is stocked up with plenty veggie alternatives - you can find tons of fake chicken nuggets and veg pizzas and stuff, so when you have a craving, you can head straight for those.  try going a month without any meat whatsoever, your taste buds will begin to change and adjust, and after a month you'll stop craving things you used to like!|`|3SY0ObRQaa	Look out for these brands of tasty vegetarian/vegan food!

You could always use a knife technique called frenching as well to cut the onion...    Why do the French get everything?|`|AA11304025	Because French Onion Soup originated in France
MpzPfzivaa	Check out these websites, they are very informative.|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	Center the diet around fresh fruits and veggies and whole grains, eat beans daily for protein and take a vegan multi-vitamin to make sure you aren't missing a thing.|`|A5gfxSyzaa	Please forgive me for the cut and paste, but i just answered a very similar question:    The hardest thing about being vegetarian, I think, is learning about what to eat in the beginning. Once you have it all sorted out you are good.    What to eat :    1- At least 5 servings of fruits and veggies a day. You want to eat a selection of different colors to make sure you are getting all you vitamins and minerals (everyone should, no matter is they are omnivore or vegetarian) Different colors have different vitamins (for example dark green veggies are high in iron and calcium)    2- Beans, nuts, eggs, soy, lentils, and dairy products will give you protein. You only need about 45 grams a day, and as long as you eat three balanced meals you are fine. You do NOT need to take a protein suppliment - your body doesn't process it as well, you don't need it, and too much protein is bad for your kidneys and depletes your vitamin B levels.    3- Whole grains. Try and avoid white breads and rice, as many of the nutrients have been removed. Look for whole wheat breads and brown rices. You need to make sure to get enough fiber every day, and this is a great way. Whole grains also contain protein (as do veggies)    4- Good fats. You need some fat every day, both for your brain and your digestive system. Cooking with virgin olive oil is great. Avacados are great.    Be careful :    Don't rely on fake meats to replace meat. Some is fine, but it's better to go with natural foods. Soy is great too, but in moderation. Also don't fill up on dairy or carbs when you are hungry. You may be more hungry in the beginning until your body adjusts, but nuts, seeds and veggies are better to curb the hunger and not add on weight.    Hidden non-vegetarian foods:    Gelatin is made from boiling the skin, bones, tendons, and cartalidge of dead animals. It's in MANY processed foods like Jello, candy (Skittles, Stabursts, marshmallows, gummy bears, Junior Mints, etc) many yogurts, some soups, most poptarts.    Beef: Beef fat is everywhere - vegetable soups, McDonald's fries, Hostess desserts, top raman and cup of noodles (only the Oriental flavor is safe) Many prepared beans have beef or pig added to them.    Enzymes: Used to make cheese, sour cream, etc they may or may not be from animals.    Lard: In many mexican foods.|`|7X82RNuiaa	There are several websites out there that are just for this purpose.

05ff5bb18eb4c096ef430ca99d7dad2daa	The reasons vary. Simply not liking meat, being against the slaughtering of animals for our food, allergies, whatever it is it's their reason. My brother is vegetarian, just doesn't like red meat. But keep in mind the difference between Vegetarian and Vegan. Vegan is one step farther, they don't eat anything that comes from an animal. No cheese, eggs, no meat at all. Vegans need a lot more vitamins and supplements because they aren't getting some of it that Vegetarians do in limited amounts.|`|4604flr2aa	I personally became a vegetarian as a teenager originally because I just always thought meat was "nasty".  Even as a small child growing up my mom said I always asked at the dinner table, "What part of the animal did this come from?"  I didn't do it for religious reasons, health reasons, or environmental reasons to begin with... just because I thought it was nasty.  I stayed vegetarian until I was about 26 or so and I started adding fish into my diet.  I'm currently 33 and still eat small amounts of fish... even though I still think it's nasty if I think about it too much and I have NO desire to eat anything beyond fish.  :)|`|A5gfxSyzaa	1- The way animals are treated (ie: cages, loaded with hormones and antibiotics, slaughtered)    2- A vegetarian diet dramatically reduces the chances of developing diabetes.

Now, despite the fact that I love eggs and eat them a couple of times a week my level is around 75.    4- I feel healthier.  I get sick less.    5- The longer I'm vegetarian the more I learn about food and the more varied my diet is.|`|7X82RNuiaa	some people love animals.

Add those mashed potatos, some fresh green beans and a lemon curd tart for dessert and you have a winner of a dinner for your folks!  Here are some other ideas:    1.  Beef tenderloin stuffed with a mixture of breadcrumbs, gorgonzola, sauteed mushrooms, and a little rosemary, rolled, tied, and roasted.  Serve with a cabernet reduction.  Garlic sour cream mashed potatos and fresh asparagas with lemon zest.  2.  Roasted chicken with herbs and butter massaged under the skin, roasted sweet potatos with a carmelized onion and candied pecan butter, chopped baby spinach with blue cheese, candied walnuts, sliced ripe pears, and champagne vinagrette.  3.  Meatloaf wrapped in bacon and topped with a sweet and sour tomato sauce; kicked up mac and cheese (add smoked gouda, blue cheese, and fontina to traditional sauce); fresh green beans with onion and bacon.  4.  Linguini with fresh tomato sauce; turkey italian sausages with green pepper and marinara; cheesy herb bread, green salad.

DFXS4SB4aa	http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-diff...    Traditional vanilla flavor is derived from the seeds of a vanilla bean pod, or at least a synthetic chemical equivalent called vanillin. French vanilla is more of an egg custard before freezing, and contains egg yolks for a richer consistency.    Traditional vanilla ice cream is also likely to contain small flecks of vanilla beans, but French vanilla is often strained to remove these flecks. Because of the egg yolks, French vanilla ice cream also appears to be a deeper shade of yellow than traditional vanilla ice cream. French vanilla ice cream is often viewed as creamier in texture than many standard vanilla ice cream brands, which may be a result of starting with a custard base instead of cream.    There is no difference between the vanilla flavoring used in standard or French vanilla ice cream. Vanilla beans are often distilled in alcohol to extract their complex flavors, and this extract is often used instead of natural vanilla beans when producing ice cream in bulk. Some brands of vanilla ice cream have flecks of real vanilla bean added during the mixing process, but their contribution to the actual flavor may be negligible. French vanilla ice cream is made with the same form of vanilla, but with a different base containing egg yolk.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	vanilla is just "vanilla flavored" but french vanilla has actual vanilla beans in it (thats the black dots in it). hope i could help! :)|`|qt4Shm2caa	that one smells like perfume and armpit and the other one doesnt.|`|IqOaDmBbaa	In my opiion French Vanilla Ice Cream has move Vanilla flaver then plain old Vanilla.

4de3da5babb437b65a9e55c075cdbbdeaa	Ideally everything should be cold, including the bowl and beaters.  Cream of tartar is best for stabilizing the egg whites, never heard of using cornstarch.  And when you put the meringue on, seal the edges of it to the crust.  There should be no gaps at all.  That prevents the 'weeping' that's commonly seen on meringue pies.  Good luck, it is kind of a tricky pie.|`|uVTosLc9aa	I always use the eggs from the fridge, but the rest is room tempurate. And a fast mixer always helps. You will have to mix it a long time. My best meringue is usually 5 eggs and 1/2 cup sugar and thats it. Some recipes call for a little corn starch, but I dont like the way that turns out. And I mix and mix and mix until it is very stiff.|`|AA12077984	When whipping egg whites temperature is not important, room temperature or right out of the fridge will work fine.     The MOST important thing is to make sure that everything is grease free. Your mixing bowl, whip or beaters must be ABSOLUTELY clean of any trace of oil, fat, grease or butter, etc. Many cooks will actually "scald" their equipment with boiling water to be sure all traces of fat are removed before whipping egg whites.     If you make sure everything is grease free you will have no problem with your meringues.     Good Luck
iNFE3utOaa	Im not a vegetarian, I eat fish, But I dont eat chicken or red meat. Because I do not feel guilty eating fish, I feel guilty eating the others. Cant ask me why I feel that way. Some things we just feel are wrong, inside of us. Its not just blind morals though, there is enough evidence to prove that we were not intended to eat red meat in the first place. Red meat is bad for us, they have already proved that. We were not meant to eat red meat, possibly fish though. Japan has the highest life expectancy out of any large country. China has a similar environment right next door, but they have one of the lowest. USA has better medical facilities than Japan, yet Japan still lives about 10 more years than americans on average. This is because Japanese diet consists of mostly fish and less red meat (in addition to rice and veggies), and China diet consists of mostly pork and chicken (in addition to rice and veggies) and USA consists of mostly burgers, pork, and chicken(we are well known world-wide as being "the obese country"). Doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the difference. Red meat clogs arteries, which is why people who eat too much of it are more prone to having heart attacks. If you have any kind of heart disease, the first thing the doctor tells you is to reduce your red meat consumption. Gee, I wonder why. Red meat and fish is acidic, vegetables are alkaline. Our bodies need more alkaline than acidic to remain healthy. The alkaline cancels out the acidic, so it keeps the ph levels in our body balanced. Just google "acidic and alkaline foods" and you will find many lists of what is acidic and what is not. You can live on nothing but vegetables, nuts and beans (for protein) and fruit. If you eat nothing but red meat everyday for a month, then eat fruits or vegetables along with it, you will not get sick. If you eat nothing but fruits and vegetables for a month,then eat red meat along with it, you will get sick. It's because our bodies were not meant for red meat, and it has to adjust to it again after cleansing itself, kind of like how if someone quits smoking for a month, then starts up again, its harsh on their lungs and makes them cough the first couple of times. I went to Cambodia and many people eat large plates of tarantula spiders. This is weird to us, but they were raised that way so our objection to it is weird. Thats all they have ever known. Imagine if they could step outside of themselves for a minute and forget everything they were taught and raised on. They might look at tarantulas in another light, same thing with meat eaters. As far as the whole "vegetarians dont get protein", thats what whey is for.|`|5otuCS3Caa	vegetarians gett their vitamins but they dont get a sufficient amount of protein, as far meatetarians go the pros are their getting alot of iron  and protein and cons are their not getting enough nutrition, they can suffer from scurvy lol|`|C6m2RTZjaa	im basically a vegetarian. i mean, i eat some meat, but very very rarely and when i do its very small in quantities. i think its very healthy for you, and you can get your protein from protein bars, shakes, and peanut butter. my diet is high in fruits because i lovee them! :)|`|AA11304025	Vegetarian = healthy life style, more efficient farming, less pollution, less animal cruelty.  Meatetarian = unhealthy lifestyle ( heart disease, bowel cancer, obesity), using large areas of land to feed animals to feed people (very inefficient). massive pollution from animal waste, more animal cruelty.|`|4vLt3SqFaa	I am vegan from choice - I think it is healthier, but not from ethics. If I was starving and there was an animal around, well sorry animal but your time has come.      I do think that a vegetable based diet is more sustainable than meat based diets.  I feel that meat diets are contaminated by what the industry does with and to then animal.  Not just the drugs and such, but all the natural substances - the fight or flight hormones released amid the stress of shipping and slaughter.  The waste products that remain in the tissues,  the accumulated poisons and heavy metals that we get enough of without added those received second hand by an animal.    I don't have any issue with people who are meat eaters - although I think that everyone should visit a livestock aution for slaughter and see what system they are supporting.  However, there is another side to personal beliefs and that is allowing beliefs to be offensive to others. I haven't eaten meat in 20 years but if I was visiting in a place like Alaska where native prepared caribou stew is a way of honoring a guest, and they didn't know anything about my dietary habits I would probably eat as minimally as possible so as to not insult their welcome.  I think vegan zealots harm other vegetarians reputations and never convert a soul to their viewpoint in their offensive behavior.      Being vegan is a personal choice.  I think it is the best but I respect personal choice too much to try and dictate to another what their moral view should be.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	I don't like to think of it as a debate, and I don't like that people have this "us vs. them" attitude in regards to their diet. It breeds hostility and intolerance. But I'm going to answer your questions and give you my personal opinion anyhow...    I am a vegetarian because I find dead muscle tissue completely unappealing (no offense), because I don't think that animals should die and hurt to feed us, when we have a CHOICE what we eat, and because I believe a responsible vegetarian diet is healthy.     The good things are: I can have a clear conscience when I'm eating, I feel great and in good health, hardly ever get sick, save money, it's easy to maintain a healthy weight/nice figure.    The negative side is that some people are confrontational and try to push their belief on you, that it's wrong and deviant to abstain from meat. And a lot of people will ask about how you get your protein, and whether you feel guilty about eating plants, etc. It's rather depressing to find out how small-minded so many people are.

AA10466359	Wrap them tight, don't over fill them & lay the flap side down and a toothpick will definitely help. You only need to pan fry them, bake them in th eoven or even grill them on a griddle. No need to deep fry. Here is the correct way to fold them.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwm3J9eBo...  Deep frying(with your choice of meat not venison)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tP3F7Wgb...
VYWaL2graa	They are incorrect. It is a fried burrito.|`|11wcVc0Eaa	Your getting me hungry = )|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Since I live in Texas, our chimis are huge compared to burritos.  They are three times the size and fried.  Most of the ingredients remain the same, but they are prepared differently as a burrito is soft and doesn't come with sauce on top.      My husband gets a chicken chimi every time we go out for Mexican.  He can barely finish the whole thing.|`|s7PxM001aa	what the hell are chimichangas|`|J36Rc5DKaa	deep fried, and there not any burritos they need different ingredients|`|i9L5z4O6aa	i know they are deep fried.  i remember jack in the box used to have those mini chimichangas! i miss them.. noone seems to remember them but me when i bring it up. lol|`|DFXS4SB4aa	Chimichangas are deep fried burritos.|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	Splitting hairs are we?|`|EYqTV2EYaa	Yes, chimichangas ARE deep-fried burritos. Not only that, but they taste GREAT too.
1onb5QDaaa	i don't really like vegetables either. but i like a few of them!  i'm a big fan off carrots and cabbage and cucumbers, and i'm slowly pacing myself towards not only being vegetarian, but vegan.  so eliminating any kind of animal product.  vegetables are very important, so you could try several ones, and try several different ways of cooking them and preparing them and see what you like.  grains and pasta are great meal alternatives, as well as soups without meat, and there's always tofu and soy-based fake meats - fake chicken breasts, and beef strips, and nuggets, and veggie pizzas, fake pepperoni, etc!  plus, if you're only vegetarian and now vegan, you can still have cheeses and whatnot!  the possibilities are endless, try hitting up a bookstore and looking at some vegetarian cookbooks, or even looking some websites up.|`|TKbYavhzaa	Veggies are over-rated.  Try some rice & bean dishes, you can do a lot of different stuff with those (a lot of creative options for spicing).|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	you need vegetables whether or not you are a meat eater or Veg|`|PxJXJKCpaa	You'll get sick if you only eat fruit and not a well balanced diet.  Humans need protein, whether it's meat or tofu.  If you have a limited diet, don't try it.|`|Npi4QR7Maa	Just don't eat meat.  Vegetarian just means you don't eat meat. If you ate only veggies than you would be a vegan or a herbivore|`|A5gfxSyzaa	The "veg" in vegetarian does not stand for vegetables.  It stands for vegetation, as in growing things.  It means that you rely on foods that are grown, as opposed to those that are born and raised to be eaten.  Can you be a vegetarian and not eat vegetables?  Sure, as much as you can be an omivore and not eat your veggies.  You need to make sure you are getting everything you need from other sources, though.    You need iron, so make sure to eat bean, nuts and whole grain foods like wheat bread and oatmeal.  Eat at least 5 servings of fruits a day, in differant colors (different colors have different vitamins for the most part)    You say you don't eat veggies, but is that completely true?  Do you eat salad?  If so try making it with spinach or a darker lettuce, as opposed to iceberg.  Spaghetti sauce or pizza sauce is a veggie (tomato).  Add some shreaded carrot to your spaghetti - you won't even notice it, but you'll get the nutrients.  Find the veggies you do like and make sure to include those in your diet.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	It's a myth that vegetarians replace meat with vegetables.  The word vegetarian was invented from the Latin word vegetus which means whole, lively or vitality.  Vegetarians replace meat with legumes+grains which together make complete protein.  Its perfectly possible to be health on a vegetarian diet without eating veg.  Lots of meateaters never eat veg, lots of vegetarians never eat veg.  Of course, vegetables are good for you, but if you eat a lot of fruit every day then you don't need to worry.  Try butternut squash though - its botanically a fruit, but has similar nutrition to veg.  It tastes really nice.  Boil and mash it, eat as mash potato substitute or fry the mash to make a sort of pancake.  Or bake or roast it....it's delicious.      Legumes = lentils, beans, chickpeas,   Grains = wheat, oats, rice, millet, quinoa, buckwheat  Put the two together to make complete protein.  Or  Soya beans contain complete protein all by themselves.  They can be made into many products - soya milk/cheese/yogurt/cream/icecream, tofu, soya meat, most fake meats are made from soya....so you could replace your meat with fake meats and eat exactly the same way you do now.|`|Ixb3nCIDaa	I don't understand why you would want to be a vegetarian if you don't like vegetables?  Why do you want to be vegetarian?|`|hAFDi7qBaa	Well, from the little that I know about Vegetarianism, it's not so much about eating vegetables, it's more of a practice of a diet that excludes meat (including game and slaughter by-products), fish (including shellfish and other sea animals) and poultry.  I have had friends that are strict Vegetarians and not only would they not eat meat, but wouldn't eat items that came from animals.  Example of what I mean is nothing dairy...comes from cows.  A good friend of mine would eat meals that were out of this world, but totally meat and dairy free.  She also drank alot of V8 type drinks and ate alot of beans and stuff like that.    So it's not just about eating veggies, it's a little more involved than that.    Take a look @ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian for more information    Good luck 2 ya.|`|Jch127Uuaa	Please do more research.  And not at any of those site that say you should become a vegetarian to save the earth or animals because you won't be doing either.   A lot of people are becoming vegetarians because they think it's fashionable or they bought some line from PETA or PCRM. Forget them, they are one in the same.     Look for experts in the field of nutrition. Talk to a competent dietician or a doctor. It would be a most excellent idea to have a complete medical checkup while your at it as well. Many people have become vegetarians only to find out that their bodies cannot handle that kind of a diet. I have heard of vegetarians who simply collapsed from malnutrition.     And please eat your vegetables. Those things are good for you.   Especially when they are served with butter!|`|nyBXPUBcaa	I'm sure there are some kinds of veggies that you like.  You could eat foods like rice, beans, Tofu, peanuts etc. When you just think of individual vegetables it is easy to think of everything that you don't like.  But when you put all of the vegetables together to make a meal like vegetarian lasagna or chili then you are able to see that this is something that you could do over a long period of time.|`|3SY0ObRQaa	Yes, there is loads of food that you can eat that isnt just vegetables!  Check out health food stores (with fridge/freezers too) and many supermarkets sell good vegetarian food too.  If you live in the UK, go to Holland and Barrett, its a health food shop with loads of great vegetarian food.    Check out these brands:    Frys  Redwoods  Vegi Deli  Cheesly  Cheatin'  Tofutti  Vegetarians Choice  Linda McCartney  Swedish Glace  B'nice    I hope this helps :]    (Don't buy Quorn, they use eggs unecessarily in all their products, which is unethical)    You can order from goodness direct =]
nyBXPUBcaa	The seasons or sauces have time to soak up into the food.  For example spaghetti, chillie and lasagna.|`|nI6V2Q9xaa	so that the sugars etc. can soak it up. a good example is a homemade swiss roll. u can taaste the little balls of sugar if you eat it right away. ghowever, if u eat it a day after. everything will have melted together. mmmmmm yum^^|`|FwJLD1uDaa	i wonder that too.. maybe the ingredients maranaid (its spelled wrong, but i dont know how to spell it sorry), and they mix better when reheated or something. i dont know but its good :)|`|DFXS4SB4aa	Some foods need time for flavors to meld, or soak up water. But dishes like stem, the reason is actually the collagen in the meat.It melts the first time it cooks, and then solidifies in the fridge into gelatin. When you reheat it, the gelatin takes longer to melt than it did with the first time, and gives you that delicious flavor and mouth feel.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Because the flavor melds together over night.  I always take a few days to perfect my soups or sauces for that very reason.|`|a7w97D43aa	Depending on the recipe, the flavours seem to incorporate overnight, e.g. a good old stew, casserole, soup, even leftovers gather taste, as long as it is refridgerated  straight away.|`|AA10466359	The flavors have time to permeate and mingle with the other flavors. If you allow your cooked food to set 30 min. to an hour after they are cooked it usually sets the flavors too. I call it sweating..|`|AA10683083	Because the flavors have time to blend. When I make chili, I let it set for at least 2 days. Lasagna sits over night, anything marinated sits over night, stews sit over night.

But to answer ur question  here, It knda sounds like it may not work but who knows.|`|Npi4QR7Maa	Heard that when I was a kid.  Its actually one of the only true Wives's tales.  Apples have a natural antioxidant that keeps your immune system up and active, therefore you don't get sick and it keeps the doctor away.|`|PClyMS0xaa	Well, to some extent.  It's not like if you eat an apple every day, you'll never need to see a doctor.  Especially when you consider physicals, checkups, and other exams which an apple could have absolutely effect on.
9z5NASypaa	I think this is the best recipe, thai style so good.    * 400 grams of Cleaned Prawns   * 1 tablespoon minced coriander root or fresh corriander  * 3 cloves garlic, crushed   * 2 1/2 teaspoons fish sauce   * 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper   * 2 teaspoons brown sugar   * 2 tablespoons oil for frying    1. Mix together, garlic, fish sauce, sugar, pepper, coriander root and cleaned prawn, then leave to marinate for 15-25 minutes.     2. Heat oil in a wok over medium heat. Add prawns and their marinade, then stir-fry for 2-4 minutes or until the color turns to white. (Tip : to get the best taste of prawns, it must not be over cooked.)     3. Transfer to a serving dish.   -----  You can even add lime juice and a bit of chilli to make it extra tasty|`|PxJXJKCpaa	This is called shrimp scampi where I'm from.

The egg must not be in the fridge so you need a room temperature egg, and drop it carefully into the water, boil for 3 minutes.  As for the soldiers, depending on whether you like your toast crispy or soggy, you put the butter on after its cooled down for crispy and whilst its still hot for soggy. Hmmmm! I think I fancy a boiled egg now :)|`|ISKM1z8iaa	3 minutes. If you put the egg in from cold and start timing when it is boiling. That way the egg doesn't crack.|`|1wNsBNmxaa	no more than 3 to 4 minutes tops any longer than that your yoke will get hard    D?mon~~?|`|5f0ad33d9668eff665c2e087d8f3dc2caa	No longer than 3hrs :)|`|HAiGuKIeaa	3-4 mins is enough..|`|1nMkURyPaa	u hot the water in for 15 mins     and live the eggs in for 10 to 15 mins|`|f5wTQblsaa	Make sure your egg is at room temperature before putting it into boiling water for 3 minutes. If you try and cook your egg straight from the fridge the shell will crack and you will loose a lot of the albumen (egg white),   TIP remove the egg from the water after 3 mins. and if  it starts to dry immediately it will be perfectly cooked
vNamrhDZaa	I wish they showed this here in the states, because it's absolutely amazing.  I saw it online and couldn't resist showing it to all my friends.      It's definitely real.  It's entirely possible to move ones face that way, it's just a matter of isolating each muscle.  As such, spending money on CGI would just be a waste.  However, it's very unlikely that anyone can move facial muscles so quickly, so some parts have been sped up using a computer.    And as for the aforementioned "twitching," that's just silly.  These kids are not going to develop some odd sort of twitch because of their ability to control their faces.  I've been raising my eyebrows for years, and I'm not having any facial spasms.  Seriously, just enjoy the ad!  It's creative and entertaining.|`|cqzZjRVwaa	Sorry to let you down but it is computerised. It's literally impossible to do that, let alone 2 young children.|`|iFCBEZW7aa	Computerised, you can tell because when they look up at the ceiling, their eyebrows move to fast, plus they shake around too much. Its not real, there is no chance. And that is fact, but it's still pretty cool and you can't help giving it a go.  (:|`|V4eh2yfcaa	Most of it is real...

And I asked for peoples points of View about it, just to see if they saw it the same way I see it. And no one has.               The way I see it ,it's not at all funny to see young children   doing this . In fact this is very wrong of Cadbury's to do such a irresponsible thing.                 Children copy every thing they see that's the way they learn   and this twitching thing should be stopped .The face, as Im told has more mussel's than any other part of the body. And once it is switched   on as you would say, it could be hard to stop it. And the end result   it this is the child develops a twitch thing.               Now some see this as very funny, but think about your own     children doing this thing, (and thy will), will you see it as a funny  thing then,                    It's one of those thing when only time will tell, and to leave it at that is very wrong and down right stupid .|`|2dJIJr6uaa	oh it is so funny! i'm guessing it's computerised.....it's very clever|`|xDdmnf80aa	I think it's real but it's sooo annoying. eyebrows + music = annoying|`|LepOqaN4aa	that proper makes me piss myself.

KeevlZnTaa	Balance is the key to any healthy diet, weather it includes meat or not. There is nothing in meat that cannot be found in a vegetarian alternative. A appropriate vegetarian diet includes, whole grains, vegetables, fruits, seeds, nuts, etc.    The American dietetic association, which is the world's largest organization of food and nutrition professional states that a vegetarian diet is healthy for all stages of life.    There are many resources that can help you properly plan a vegetarian diet.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	If you eat a balanced, healthy vegetarian diet, then yes, it is healthy, just as healthy or more healthy than a meat-eating diet. If you eat unhealthy vegetarian food you'll be unhealthy. It's what you make of it.|`|Npi4QR7Maa	Well, yeah its healthy, have you ever seen a unhealthy vegetarian?!  I'm vegetarian but I'm completely healthy. In fact I can't remember the last time I was sick|`|MAAxboH7aa	It is if you know how to make it a balanced diet. Tofu and other soy products might take a while to get used to, so I advise you to wean yourself off the non-vegetarian stuff slowly. There are also so many mock meats in the market nowadays, though I don't suppose they're very healthy, so fresh foods are definitely the best. Make sure you take in enough calories, and don't introduce too much fibre too quickly because you'll feel lethargic and get IBS. Good luck..|`|J54q2aVtaa	It's extremely healthy.  What is the main thing you see all middle-aged people worrying about and going to doctors about?    Cholesterol?  Correct!  You can eliminate an entire portion of doctor visits by going vegetarian.  Middle aged people who aren't vegetarian have to now watch what they eat, and take medicine for cholesterol.     Does it seem normal that you have to take medicine to make up for problems that your diet has caused?|`|C8AgEq3Aaa	Several Studies have shown that vegetarians are healtheir and live longer.    Why did you think that vegetarians are not healthy?    Here are some facts:    Vegetarians have much lower cholesterol levels than people that eat meat. Heart disease is found much less in vegetarians. Studies have also shown that vegetarians have up to half the cancer rate than those of non-vegetarians.     Vegetarians eat more antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotenes and phytochemicals. Phyotochemicals are components in plants that help to prevent disease. Antioxidants decrease the chance of getting heart disease, cancer and other diseases.    Eating red meat increases the chance of dying from cancer of the breast and colon, heart disease and strokes. Cancer and cardiovascular diseases are linked to diets with a high amount of saturated fat (meat) and with a low amount of fiber (meat).     Animal products are high in sodium, which causes the blood to retain water and also causes plaque to build up in the arteries, lowering the flow of blood, which are major causes of high blood pressure.    Meat is deficient in carbohydrates, particularly the starches which are so essential to proper health. Vitamin deficient. Except for the b-complex, meat is largely deficient in vitamins.    I know this would sound gross, but its the truth:   Body wastes. Food from animals contain their waste, including adrenaline, uric and lactic acid, etc., Before adding ketchup, the biggest contributors to the "flavor profile" of a hamburger are the leftover blood and urine.    So next time you eat non-veg, make sure what are you eating.    Plus there are so many ethical reasons to go vegetarian    God has given everyone the right to live. As human we are superior beings, but unfortunately we misuse this superiority and don't respect lives of other living beings.    Imagine what that poor animal goes through when he is killed just to satisfy your taste buds. As human we have the ability to understand the right and the wrong and have compassion. But we don't use it.    If someone just pokes a needle on you it hurts so badly, so imagine what that poor animal goes through when it is slaughtered for your sensous pleasure.    There are so many other good things that you can eat , so many varieites of fruits and vegetables, that there is no need to kill those animals.    Shame people dont even give it a thought and don't even want to understand.    I HOPE the info was useful|`|Qe1lSunUaa	yes it can be very healthy but you need take vitamins for protein|`|rog4GDgaaa	It can be, but you have to be more mindful of what you eat because you won't have the easy ready sources of complete proteins, vitamin B12, and iron like you would if you ate animal products.  However, those can be obtained from eating a well balanced meal containing soy, legumes, dark green leafies like spinach, etc.  A supplement not a bad idea. If you can dedicate the time to balancing your diet, ensuring you get the proteins, vitamins, minerals you need then you will skip the parts that make animal products unhealthy- namely the high sat fat content ( and all the chemical crap we put in them now).  So yes- it can be.  I don't think it's better than a omnivorous diet, but like any omnivorous diet- needs to be balanced to get any true health benefit.    Julian- I see unhealthy vegetarians ALL THE TIME. Most of them because they aren't watching their diet well enough and end up terribly anemic. Nothing healthy about that.|`|tVI01jJMaa	it is somewhat healthy, but not REALLY healthy, of course, you still need proteins from meat..vegetables cannot fully substitute the nutrients that meat can give. meat has its own characteristics that any other food cannot supply, specially protein.|`|zD8GmnHxaa	That depends on your own unique body.  Vegetarianism is perfect for some people, but others really do need to consume meat (though most Western diets consume too much meat).  Try it out and see how you feel - make sure you learn about how to build complete proteins.  I do know that for people who were vegetarians and it wasn't right, their health and energy levels deteriorated over a few years until they started being omnivores again.  'Vegetarian' is also just a label - if you're interested in making a healthier/ less meaty diet, you can always just eat more vegetarian meals without going completely 'vegetarian'.|`|dsu0mvOOaa	of course , u r oso saving the earth by saving the animals,|`|fzjFi7q4aa	it can be healthy, yes.  Although, i know a fair few quite overweight vegetarians.  i think this is down to the fact that because they can't eat meat, and meat substitutes are very light, they still feel hungry after a sufficient meal so they pig out on snacks etc.  however, this doesnt apply to everyone! but  i am just saying :)|`|3SY0ObRQaa	Yes.

But, as a result, a lot of planning comes with it. Vegetables, though seemingly amazing gifts of nutrition, are full of vitamins, minerals, macro nutrients and other very useful chemicals, they contain, for the most part, little if no protein. Protein is a topic of much debate it seems. People argue that some are not getting enough, and others argue that some are getting too much. But a rough rule of thumb is you need to consume 0.8g of protein per 1kg of your weight.   Strictly speaking, being a vegetarian is both very rewarding and very delicious, but please be careful about getting enough of the following nutrients:    Protein  Vitamin B12  Iron  Zinc  Vitamin D    Protein is abundant in many nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and of course soy beans. Your primary source of protein should be from beans, nuts and legumes. Tofu for example, contains very good amounts and high quality of protein, and should be very much involved in your weekly diet.     Vitamin B12 can only be found in sufficient amounts in animal products and byproduct. So, you should take a supplement for this or find fortified foods containing it. Soymilk and vegetarian-meat are fortified with B12.    Iron - Is actually found in large amounts in plant matter. Unfortunately, the form it's found in is very hard for our bodies to absorb. Leafy greens, and almost most nuts and vegetable contain good amounts of iron - just also take in a large amount of Vitamin C in the same meal - this will aid in the digestion and uptake of Iron. Again, fortified foods, supplements and dark leafy greens.    Zinc - Is found in most nuts in good supply. It's also found in some fruits and vegetables, so do you a little research into which ones in particular. Again, most cereals are fortified with zinc. Better take a multivitamin to be safe.    Vitamin D - Isn't found much in vegetable matter, but for most people, direct sunlight exposure for 15-20mins gives ample amounts of Vitamin D. Be careful though, too much sunlight is dangerous. Try supplementing too! :)    Hope this help. Please just watch your protein and your b12 mainly. Eat fortified cereals and dairy for protein and all the ones above.    I'm vegan, so I didn't include dairy in my list (and eggs are very good too!)...|`|A5gfxSyzaa	The hardest thing about being vegetarian, I think, is learning about what to eat in the beginning.  Once you have it all sorted out you are good.    What to eat :    1- At least 5 servings of fruits and veggies a day.  You want to eat a selection of different colors to make sure you are getting all you vitamins and minerals (everyone should, no matter is they are omnivore or vegetarian)  Different colors have different vitamins (for example dark green veggies are high in iron and calcium)    2- Beans, nuts, eggs, soy, lentils, and dairy products will give you protein.  You only need about 45 grams a day, and as long as you eat three balanced meals you are fine.  You do NOT need to take a protein suppliment - your body doesn't process it as well, you don't need it, and too much protein is bad for your kidneys and depletes your vitamin B levels.    3- Whole grains.  Try and avoid white breads and rice, as many of the nutrients have been removed.  Look for whole wheat breads and brown rices.  You need to make sure to get enough fiber every day, and this is a great way.  Whole grains also contain protein (as do veggies)    4- Good fats.  You need some fat every day, both for your brain and your digestive system.  Cooking with virgin olive oil is great.  Avacados are great.      Be careful :    Don't rely on fake meats to replace meat.  Some is fine, but it's better to go with natural foods.  Soy is great too, but in moderation.  Also don't fill up on dairy or carbs when you are hungry.  You may be more hungry in the beginning until your body adjusts, but nuts, seeds and veggies are better to curb the hunger and not add on weight.    Hidden non-vegetarian foods:    Gelatin is made from boiling the skin, bones, tendons, and cartalidge of dead animals.  It's in MANY processed foods like Jello, candy (Skittles, Stabursts, marshmallows, gummy bears, Junior Mints, etc) many yogurts, some soups, most poptarts.    Beef: Beef fat is everywhere - vegetable soups, McDonald's fries, Hostess desserts, top raman and cup of noodles (only the Oriental flavor is safe)  Many prepared beans have beef or pig added to them.    Enzymes: Used to make cheese, sour cream, etc they may or may not be from animals.    Lard: In many mexican foods.
DFXS4SB4aa	Aspartame is known to cause serious problems. That's why I don't use any artificial sweeteners.     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartame_c...|`|464cd149b8bc7f1afebea410c89ca583aa	Although aspartame can be safely consumed by most healthy individuals, it has long been recognized that excessive intake of phenylalanine, one of the constituent amino acids of aspartame, can pose a hazard to individuals suffering from an inherited metabolic disorder called phenylketonuria. For this reason, all foods containing aspartame must indicate on the label the presence of phenylalanine.    An acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 40 milligrams/kilogram of body weight/day was established by scientists in the Food Directorate of Health Canada. This ADI is recognized internationally and is the same as that established by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) of the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO).|`|o65klEwWaa	The adults of today, did not have ready access to this additive when we were kids. Certainly not in large quantities. We may have drank a lot of soda, but it did not have artificial sweeteners in them. Therefore we do not know the long term effects of aspartame. It is thought that this will especially be of concern in our children's future reproductive ability and potentially faulty DNA passing down the generations.
I7Ee17s0aa	You might want to visit Chef Rubber and take a look at their variety of colorants for fondant.  Black and silver are great "non colors" to work with, but can be a pain in the butt to get just right.  If you haven't used fondant before, you might want to get started.  Also, for decorations, you might take a look at what you can make with royal icing as well as gum paste/fondant decorations.  Combining gum paste with fondant is an easy way to create a stronger substance.  Let dry for several days before you use them.  You can also purchase powdered luster or pearl dusts that, when mixed with lemon extract, can be used to "paint" decorations.  Good luck!|`|sDAnuaBYaa	From what i understand silver is very hard to do properly, and to get it to look metallic, and not dull and grey is especially hard.     My advice would be to do black fondant, and use silver dragees and do a polka-dot cake like that. Not only would it be simple, but it would look really nice.|`|2kl0vQjVaa	You can A) airbrush it on or B) paint it on.

doz7RIoeaa	There are two reasons that I can give you:    I don't have to be a vegetarian and I choose not to be a vegetarian.|`|kQSSz2X2aa	1. Hunting maintains the balance of nature. People are just as much a part of the food chain as anything else, and removing any part of it throws the whole thing off. Think of the honeybee argument.    2. Meat provides a lot of nutrition. It is full of many nutrients that are harder to find in plant material. It's a lot easier to develop a deficiency if you are vegetarian and even easier if you are vegan.    3. Eating meat makes traveling and social eating situations a lot easier. You don't have to ask for a special meal prepared for you, and you are not restricted to certain foods.    4.  It tastes good. I like ice cream, spaghetti, and a medium rare fillet mignon. Yummy.    5. Being a vegetarian means that you have to spend more time planning meals to make sure that you get all of the required vitamins/minerals. As a meat eater I don't have to make sure that I eat x amount of flax seeds to get my omega 3 and 6. I get it from the salmon I had last night.|`|EXisORX2aa	I am a vegetarian. I decided when I was very young... I was 4. If I had a reason NOT to be one though, I would say convenience.|`|0bff81ed3d62dee95cf8cc2a3daa55a4aa	Human beings were "designed" (either by evolution or creation) to be omniverous, i.e., to eat both animal and plant matter as a source of nutrients.  Our dental structure (i.e., teeth) and our digestive systems support this fact.  Animal muscle tissue provides a complete complement of amino acids required by humans.  To get this from plants requires careful selection, and it is unlikely that many habitable locations on Earth have a variety of plants that can provide a complete balance, so it's natural to include meat in the diet.  Humans naturally enjoy the texture and flavor of animal protein, be it meat, poultry, or fish, and those that become vegetarians have to convince themselves - or be convinced by others - to adapt to its absence.|`|ac86122c9cb91e07cd8a4065a32fff67aa	I grew up eating meat and I love it. My diet of meat includes poultry, beef, pork, and seafood. I love seafood. I like the textures of different kinds of meat. I like vegetables too. I'm not saying I don't like vegetables when I say I love meat. I like vegetables too such as salads. I think it's perfect to eat a little of everything. Eating meat is also a survival strategy. Complete herbivores or complete carnivores are the ones to die first compared to omnivores in a food shortage crisis. If I were to be a vegetarian and a PETA maniac and I was lost in the wild, I'd probably die because I'd past up the chance of catching myself a fish and living to see another day.|`|b916f6962d68b4ccca7c451250580511aa	I think your project is very sad. Being a vegetarian is a great feeling and has many benefits no matter what the reason for becoming one. Being a vegetarian is one of the best things you can do to help combat global warming especially right now. This type of lifestyle is better for everyone - the animals, your health and the environment. And, being a vegetarian is much more than just salads and vegetables. Check out the increase in "mock" foods at the grocery store and online. There are so many options. I have a lot of these listed on my 'health' page at my website. Also, may not be healthy but vegetarians can also consume starches such as pasta, potatoes, french fries, etc. Everything except the meat! I think you should focus your time on a project that is more positive. If anything, you should be helping to promote this type of diet. Why not do something helpful and worthwhile??|`|VkAu2KDdaa	the taste  that's pretty much all I can think of|`|9d05a9e8cab99cbbfbfef03b51aa22bfaa	umm...  -meat tastes good  -being a vegetarian can hurt ur health cuz not get enough protein, cuz not many ways to get protien wen ur a vegetarian  - some ppl dont like veggies  and thats all i have...............|`|RTLaLMRIaa	Some people like the taste of meat.

I eat one of the above about once a month.  Rest of the time, low-fat high-fiber diet, lots of whole grains, vegetables, fruits.  I really look forward to my once-a-month treats!  What's life without a few rewards now and then?  2) You need to know what you are doing to get complete nutrition from a vegetarian diet.  It's not rocket science, but takes some work and effort.  Some people are too lazy.  I know a couple of overweight vegetarians.  They eat salads swimming in dressing, veggie sandwiches with huge slices of cheese, deep-fried vegetables, and piles of chips and candy.  Going meatless doesn't automatically mean a healthy diet.  Any healthy diet needs variety and balance.  A good vegetarian diet will have a variety of whole grains, legumes and pulses, vegetables, soy, and fruits.  A good omnivore diet will have the same things, but with a little meat and dairy thrown in.  A bad vegetarian diet or a bad omnivore diet will have lots of fat, very little fiber, and lots of processed food.  And not matter what your diet is, almost any doctor will tell you exercise is equally important.    Hmm, I can only think of two reasons.  A proper vegetarian diet is very healthy.  But a low-fat high-fiber omnivore diet wth very moderate amounts of meat (less than 4 oz per day) is probably just as good statistically.    The common argument that vegetarians lack protein is not true in a properly designed vegetarian diet.  I try to have two or three vegetarian days per week, and I tend to favor dishes made with a combination of whole wheats, legumes, and nuts.  Far example, this week I had a sweet potato bell pepper stew that included red beans and peanuts, seasoned with ginger, cumin, and green chiles, served with brown rice and lentils on the side.  This meal had protein that was just as complete as any meat.  But I must admit a rack of bbq ribs would have been more satisfying!  Maybe next week.....|`|XuP0QwFtaa	I like the taste of meat.  I would love to be a vegetarian but veggies do not taste as good as meat.  I also get sick if I eat too much salad.|`|hAFDi7qBaa	I gotta have my meat.  I like vegetables and fruits, but I can't imagine a lifestyle totally devoted to one style of foods.  I have tried some awesome vegan dishes and they were good, but all the while I was eating them, I kept on thinking "man this would be great with some bacon, or steak or whatever.." you know?  I have to agree with some of the others..Taste has a lot to do with it.    Hope this info helped.

83831eff7bb85ad47ec2595377972d60aa	Let me start by saying that this time of the year is difficult on a humidor. Your indoor heat system will rapidly dry the wood of the humidor making it ineffective. The quality of the humidor is never more important than the winter months.     That being said, two days is way too fast to lose humidity. I would recommend reseason the humidor. Instead of using a shot glass, use a damp (not soaked) sponge in a bowl in the humidor. Dampen with fairly warm water. Leave in the humidor overnite. The dry walls really need to digest some humidity.    Also, take a good look at the humidor. Are all the corners connected properly. Does the seal around the lid and the box have a groove that 'interlocks' when closed. If the lid is flat around the the seal, it will not seal effectively. Do you have one hing on the lid that runs the length of the lid or two hinges with one at each end. One long hinge is preferred but not always necessary.    From my experience, there have only been two companys that build quality humidors. Everyone else builds boxes and calls them humidors. One of these companys, Humidor Supreme, recently went out of business. You can still find some of their humidors for sell in different places. The other, which in my opinion, is the very best is Cuban Crafters. I have sold their humidors in my store for years and never had a single complaint. I would recommend you look into these brands, especially the Cuban Crafters.     I would recommend my friends at Cigar Tycoon USA. They have a nice site where you can look at the humidors and read about their features. I'm sure they would answer any questions that you may have about your current humidor as well. They are real nice people there.    Good Luck!!!!|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	Buy a small humidity meter and stick it in there.|`|umhjqZwLaa	buy the cheapest cigars you can find. slightly wet them but don't soak.keep one dry to smoke . put the wet ones in the humidor for 3 days. smoke the dry one and one from the humidor. the one from the humidor should burn smoother and slower than the dry one. if you can't tell a difference you have a bad box.

tVI01jJMaa	fruits are better, because fruits contain more fibers, more vitamins than those fruit juices. more over, fruits are fresh, while fruit juices had already undergone processing, which most of the times contains preservatives.|`|THbIes2Baa	What's missing in fruit juice.    Whole fruit provides you with a whole lot more nutrition that fruit juice. Focusing upon two components of fruit - the skin and the pulp - will help to clarify why there is such a difference between the two.     The edible skins of many of the World's Healthiest Fruits - including apples, apricots, blueberries, figs, grapes, pears, plums, prunes, raisins, raspberries, and strawberries - are all sites of important biological activity in the life of the fruit. The skin is one of the places where the fruit interacts with sunlight, and forms a variety of colored pigments that absorb different wavelengths of light. These pigments, including carotenoids and flavonoids, are well researched as nutrients that protect our health and nourishment. The skins of whole fruits like grapes have actually been studied for their ability to help lower risk of cancer and help provide protection from ultraviolet light.     Unfortunately, when fruits are juiced, we don't always get to enjoy the fruit's skin. That is because many juicing processes remove the skin, and do not allow for its full benefits to get into the juice.     In addition to the skin, which is an important source of fiber in most fruits, the pulpy part of the fruit is also a source of fiber (and other nutrients). Orange juice makes a good example of the health difference when you focus on the issue of its pulp. The white pulpy part of the orange is the primary source of its flavonoids. The juicy orange-colored sections of the orange contain most of its vitamin C. In the body, flavonoids and vitamin C often work together, and support health through their interaction. When the pulpy white part of the orange is removed in the processing of orange juice, the flavonoids in the orange are lost in the process. This loss of flavonoids is one of the many reasons for eating the orange in its whole food form (even if you only end up eating a little bit of the white pulpy part). Although many commercial products will say "pulp added" on their labels, the "pulp added" many not even be the original pulp found in the whole fruit, and it is highly unlikely to be added back in the amount removed.     Juicing reduces the fiber content  Fiber is lost in the conversion from whole fruit to fruit juice, for an apple for example     A cup of apple juice that you can see straight through (pulp removed) contains no measurable amount of fiber. To create this 8-ounce glass of juice, approximately 3-4 apples are needed (depending, of course, on the size and density of the apples). Each of these 3-4 apples contains about 3.75 grams of dietary fiber, for a total of about 12-15 grams of dietary fiber. Virtually all of these 12-15 grams are lost in the production of clear apple juice! These 12-15 grams of lost fiber, if added back into the juice, would fully double our average daily fiber intake.|`|zrUbBiFdaa	fruits are always better thean the fruit juice unless you juice it yourself.|`|HAiGuKIeaa	Both are good..|`|C8AgEq3Aaa	Fruits is better because they contain roughage which helps in digestion and no nutrients are filtered.    But you can have fruits as well as juices, because it is easier, say, to have a glass of carrot juice containing 7 carrots rather than eating 7 carrots raw.    Thus you should eat more of fruits, but can have one or two glasses of fruit juice also.|`|EsVjwKPAaa	i would say,  fruit! coz it has a juice in it already. unless you juice it yourself.. coz the juice that we buy in grocery stores has already an artificial flavors. so it's not good.|`|W86sginbaa	whole fruits are the best. there is no substitute for them.|`|28vDdNLWaa	Personal question.

Firstly it is a process in it's self, the ingredients have to be right, the method has to be spot on. I have an Italian butcher here that makes the catchitori, the soppressati, cappicoli and pancetta. He makes mine and all I do is pick it up and hang it in my cellar, its cool, dry, and there is a little hint of a draft, helps with drying and curing. I also have my own commercial slicer, I buy whole Prosciutto Di Parma and slice all my cold cuts.    Chris|`|PHjwD5g3aa	Your Answer:  If you are not familiar with sausage making I would strongly recommend getting the book Charcuterie: The Craft of Salting, Smoking, and Curing by Michael Ruhlman and Brian Polcyn. It has a number of recipes, but it also teaches you proper technique.     One of the best recipe resources I have found is Len Poli's website: http://lpoli.50webs.com/Sausage%20recipe... There are a couple recipes for Soppressata. There is also a recipe for capocollo cotto under Cooked Peppered Butt    Good Luck!

d41bd2987be2bbb3bb7086e0162c5b82aa	For a normal cake batter recipe (not commercial- for wedding cakes), I would add 1 cup or less of sultanas. You want to make sure it doesn't overpower the cake batter. But yeah, you can add nuts or dried fruits and it won't badly affect the end result. What you don't want to do is tamper with the formula for the batter itself ie. the amount of eggs, the amount flour, nor the amount of sugar. That is when you start to run into problems. It sounds delish! Have fun!    You CAN add or eliminate:  essence  salt  dried fruit  nuts|`|o65klEwWaa	What about apples. You lightly fry slices of apple in butter.

4bedkpvLaa	Time Required: 30 minutes   Here's How:  Rinse the rice in water to get rid of excess starch.  For every cup of rice, add 1 1/2 cups water.  Bring the rice to boil, uncovered, at medium heat.  When boiling, turn the heat down to medium low.   Place the lid on the pot, keeping it tilted to allow steam to escape.  When you can see holes or "craters" in the rice, put the lid on tight.  Turn the heat to low.  Simmer for another 15 minutes.  Fluff up rice and serve.  Tips:  For best results, use long grain rice.  For a bit of variety, try one of the scented rices, such as jasmine. The amount of the water required and the cooking time will be less than for other types of long grain rice.

Hy8kivLoaa	Something REALLY easy that my boyfriend LOVES (and he's a picky little American-Italian who's used to amazing food) is stuffed chicken breast (I think it's a Campbell's soup recipe actually): You need chicken breast, condensed cream of chicken OR cream of mushroom soup, milk, stuffing mix, and 1 egg.      1.) Mix stuffing package w/ 1 egg and 1 cup hot water    2.) Put chicken breast one at a time between waxed paper and pound w/ a rolling pin to make thinner/flat (not too thin)    3.) spoon stuffing onto chicken and wrap chicken around (I like lots of stuffing in mine)    4.) put chicken/stuffing rolls open side down in a sprayed dish (with sides-I normally use a pie plate or a casserole pan    5.) mix condensed soup w/ half a can of milk and pour over chicken.    6.) Bake at 375 until chicken is cooked through (like 30 min.)  You can spoon soup over chicken when you check it to keep it from drying out.      You can serve it with a salad and bread...most guys I know don't really appreciate a nice salad on it's own though.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	try to make a yummy salad with a homemade vinagrette dressing. you could also buy soft breadsticks and warm them up in your oven. have fun :)|`|HEf129Hvaa	Just cook him a simple meal.  I'm sure he'll like it because he'll know you cooked it just for him.  Not, all Italian girls know who to cook.  Actually, I'd have to say that very few know how to cook, so he probably doesn't expect you to be a gourmet chef because he isn't used to seeing that.  Why don't you try cooking a simple dish from your country or maybe your favorite mom/grandma recipe?      I live in Italy, and trust me the majority of Italian girls aren't very good in the kitchen.  The moms and grandmas yes, but the younger generation no.|`|1MGXHYq9aa	Go and buy him an excellent Pizza. If he is like most guys.

Get one more than you need.   (Filet mignon).  Wrap them with bacon and hold it on with a wooden tooth pick.    Throw a little salt, pepper, and a small glob of real butter on top, and stick them on the barbecue grill, if you have one.  Get it nice and hot (several minutes empty, on high) before   you put them on, so the grill surface will sear the meat quickly.  As soon as you put them on there,  then turn it to low and close the cover.  Check them every few minutes, but let them go for a little while before turning them.      Once you turn, use the extra filet as a test dummy, so you can cut it open and see how it's progressing inside.   Depending on how he likes his cooked, you will see a lot of pink (rare)  a fair amount of pink with grey inching toward the center (medium rare)  a bit of pink (medium/medium well) or no pink (well)    Chop an onion and a green pepper, roll them in a foil packet with butter.  Put that on a top shelf or corner of the grill and let it saute itself.      If you have no grill, you can use your oven broiler on low.  Be very careful with the broiler.  Too high, or too close, and you can burn the outside, while not cooking the inside.      Pick up some asparagus or another favorite fresh vegetable.  Asparagus is good, because it can also be cooked on the grill/broiler in foil, with a bit of butter and/or olive oil.  (butter is your friend for rare-occasion cooking)    Peel, wash, cut, and boil some potatoes (2 -3 large potatoes is fine) until they are soft enough to smash with a fork against the side of the pan.  Drain well and mash with a hand masher or cake mixer, with about 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 stick of butter, as well as salt and pepper to taste.  Once you get going, if it's too stiff, add some milk until it's right.  I always keep a couple of cooked potato chunks off to the side, in case I screw up and make it too soupy.  Use your  milk in small portions, though, and you shouldn't have a problem.    Once you're almost ready, drain the filet juices from the broiler pan into a small sauce pan.  Put 2 heaping tbsp flour in a jar with cold water and shake until mixed well and no lumps.  Add the flour mixture to the juices, about half at a time and stir over medium/low heat until it starts to thicken.  If it begins to boil and hasn't thickened enough, add a bit more and keep stirring until thick.  Remove from heat and serve dinner.    ** if you're using a grill, you won't have juices to use from the filets.  Drop about 2 bullion cubes into hot water and stir them in well, before adding the flour mixture, and then add a bit of salt and pepper it, as there won't be any without the juices.        With the potatoes and gravy, it's important to taste as you cook.  Use a new spoon each time, but taste while you're flavoring with spices.  If it tastes bland, add a little more.  If it tastes too strong, use your few extra cooked potato chunks, or with gravy add a bit more water or milk.  For gravy, aside from salt and pepper, and steak juice, you can also do garlic powder, onion powder, and possibly a tiny bit of crushed red or cayenne for a bit of zing, as well as parsley, oregano, basil or other favorite green spice.  When in doubt, leave it out, though.  If you do use it, use a very very minute amount to avoid overspicing...like pinch a little between two fingers.     ***  If you've got a week, do a trial run asap, so you'll know what to expect.         :D    ** edit **    Mmmmm, s. kelley, that sounds good.  I might try that.

It should be in all the regular grocery stores.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Try a health food store, or perhaps a restaurant supply store if these exist where you live.|`|9z5NASypaa	Usually you find it with the other baking product with the other stocks. maybe they ran out.  If you want to make your own got to allrecipes.com, they have a recipe on there.|`|pxdEpIZAaa	no you don't have to make it. If you can't find it at your local grocery store, just ask someone there. and if they really don't have it, try a fresh market or natural food store... they always have vegetarian and vegan foods.|`|889bdf746f8db41a658d481702371e15aa	Tey must have run out, normally it's there right next to the beef and chicken stock/broth.|`|D4NsV3P9aa	just use beer instead....OZZIE OZZIE OZZIE OI OI OI|`|V58rYfEsaa	Our supermarkets have them next to the tins and packets of soups...on the top shelf.

Anyway, it'll take about 2.5 hours for the alcohol to clear your system if it was wine, probably a little more if there was vodka. Either way, you're fine. The remaining effects (hangover, etc) are due to your liver and brain biochemistry and won't affect your son.|`|Bo2sxnqtaa	Depends on how much you drank and how many times u took a piss...usually no more then like a day...well thats me and i dont drink sangria...and if you were drunk for real your urine would be clear so once it turns back yellow your good to go.....
fZnuyKSZaa	Basically you just need three ingredients, so they must be of finest quality.  The proportions are 1:2:3..sugar, butter, flour, so for example 2 oz sugar, 4 oz butter, 6 oz flour. As long as you stick to these proportions you can make any amount    Mix flour with the sugar and grate the cold butter in.  Get your hands cold and dry them and the work the butter it. It should be oily or greasy, if it does you took too much time, so work quickly.    Put it in a mould or tin ( I use the small brownie tray) and flatten the dough out with your hands ( you cant roll it). Try to smooth it as much as possible ( I use cling film)  Put it in the fridge and then preheat the oven Gas 3 160C  Bang it in for 30-40 minutes. The last ten minutes watch it like a hawk, it should be ever so slightly golden.    Take out and prick it with a fork. When nearly cold cut it in fingers.      As to the flour. Just normal plain flour, but I sometimes use 1 third of it with either semolina or rice flour.    Edit: Salted butter is fine, its more traditional|`|l9biq5kVaa	Youve got some recipes so I shant bother repeating them..lol..but I'll give you some  tips.  1. NEVER blend or whisk together, you need to rub the butter into the mix with your fingertips, when you're finished it should resemble a crumble mix, and thats how it should go into the baking tin, dont try and get a smooth doughy like mix.  2. Cold Butter  3  Cold Hands  4. The most important one of all..dont overwork the mix, for some reason shortbread mix hates being handled too much|`|qbwX28Myaa	My recepie:    Ingredients:    100g plain flour  50g caster sugar  100g Butter  50g Semolina    1. Set the oven to 160C/gas 2.     2. Place all the ingredients together in a food processor and whizz until the mixture forms a smooth dough (if preferred this can be done by hand in a bowl using soft butter).     3. Roll the shortbread out to form a circle with a 20cm diameter and flute the edge (alternatively, press into a 20cm loose bottomed cake tin).     4. Prick gently over the top with a fork and score the surface of the round into 8 even wedges. Sprinkle with caster sugar. Bake for 20-25 minutes until firm and golden.      5. Set aside to cool a little, but cut into wedges while still slightly warm. Store in an airtight tin.    Hope this helps.  XXX|`|gOm09Bqsaa	i loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee scottish shortbread    http://www.rampantscotland.com/recipes/b...|`|vvg1iwQ1aa	Ingredients:   6oz Plain flour   4oz Soft butter   2oz caster (granulated) sugar   1 oz cornflour (cornstarch)     Method:   Mix the butter and sugar together (preferably with a wooden spoon) until it is pale and creamy. Sieve both the flour and the cornflour into the bowl and mix well. Put a small amount of flour on your working surface and place the dough on this. Shake a little flour on top and roll out about quarter inch thick. Prick with a fork and cut into rounds with a cutter or, if you want one large shortbread round, pinch the edges with thumb and finger all round.     Use a palette knife to lift the shortbread onto an oiled baking tray and bake for 25 minutes in a pre-heated oven at 325F/170C/Gas Mark 3. If the biscuits are ready, they will be pale brown and crisp; if not, return to the oven for 5 or 10 minutes. Shake a small amount of caster/granulated sugar on the top of the shortbread immediately after they have been removed from the oven. Use a palette knife to move them to a cooling rack and store in an airtight tin once they are cold.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	190 g all-purpose flour   65 g white sugar   170 g butter       DIRECTIONS  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).   Blend all ingredients well. Dough will be stiff.   Press into a 9 x 9 inch buttered dish. Prick top with a fork.   Bake until pale golden brown on the edges. Cool and cut into squares.|`|H1d50MsEaa	buy em from the shop they will taste better lol and they will be pure Scottish like me!!!! goodluck if ur tryin to bake them tho it will be hard|`|G1cM6oxDaa	I may be too late...you may have already baked....    If not or if you're not happy with the results try mine!!       250g plain flour   175g unsalted butter    (allow to soften for a bit)   75g caster sugar      Sift the flour and sugar into a bowl. Mix them together with a wooden spoon, making sure you mix both ingredients together properly, or bits of the shortbread will taste far too sweet and others will taste of cardboard.    Cut up the butter into small pieces and rub into the flour.  You should end up with a doughy texture, which will squish into shortbread dough.     Now you can cut out shapes, flatten into a 1cm deep circle and mark into sections like a petticoat tale, press into a shortbread mould or    Form into a sausage shape, and roll in Demerara sugar. Then slice 1cm rounds.    They will spread a little on the tray so spread out.    Cook the shortbread at 160 C for at least 30 minutes and up to 40/45 minutes, depending on its colour.     If it looks pale, it's not cooked properly. Try for a light golden colour. Too dark WON'T BE NICE    Remove from tray.    If you've not chosen the sausage and demerara route, sprinkle caster sugar over the biscuits before they cool    Or while hot from the oven hold a chunk of chocolate against the top, it will melt and you can slide it around to coat the top of the biscuit.

Tests vary from company to company depending on the product they produce. For the most part, what they are trying to avoid are lawsuits and negative publicity/negative public perception of the quality of their products. If people did not sue large companies all the time for just about anything, many of these tests would not be necesary.     By the way, there is a loophole to all of this. Some companies who claim no animal testing may have contracted all product testing to another independent lab. This lab may have done some animal testing. But the manufacturer can claim that they do not test on animals as indeed they don't. They contracted another to do it. These are businesses and one thing they are always good at it "deniability"|`|OSbgWcx8aa	Basically just things like that.

You can also mix a little corn meal if you like to the final flour mix  Yes You can use a deep pan or wok and  test it first  like adding a drop of water ,makes sure it sizzles first can even drop a bit of moistened flour to it and see if it begins to fry ..

Cut your fish into 3oz portions.Whisk together the flour, salt, pepper, and beer in a large bowl. Set aside for 10 minutes. Fold in the eggs. Batter should be thin.

9b5dac1be3e7de64e01e390eba1a9013aa	Wish i knew the answer to this one! lol    The cold weather might have started it (body wanting to lay down fat for warmth), I've been craving chocolate, biscuits, crisps... But if i eat a lot of chocolate i know i'll crave more and more.    So i'm afraid it is down to will power. Make sure there's none in your house and if you're tempted to buy some think about whether you really do want it or whether you're just giving in. Be strong and walk right past the shop/chocolate section. Soon, you won't crave it anymore and just be back to just fancying some every now and then.|`|gTITuA7taa	Whenever I'm having a craving I quickly down a full glass of water. It usually fills my stomach enough to settle the craving. Also, it has been proven that many people's bodies confuse hunger and thirst; you may be thirsty and literally not even realize it. This trick has been a great way to stay trim and hydrated and is a healthy alternative to giving in to the cravings or taking pills/supplements. Of course, I am a serious dark chocolate lover, so now and then I indulge. Doing so in moderation (and again, with a full glass of water) helps make sure that I don't go overboard.|`|Bs5ZpibBaa	go shopping and try to get some sport.u are stresed .like every one in this world .|`|URHkLqeKaa	Chocolate is the food equivalent of crack.

There is no such thing as a physiological addiction to chocolate. It is just being weak-willed and making excuses. Sorry to sound harsh, but it's like people who say they are addicted to shopping - addictive it isn't.    Usually it is a sign things may not be right or you are miserable and having it as comfort food - check your life at the minute, see if there isn't a deeper problem.

(4  across and 6 the long ways)  Sprinkle the `dry' pudding mix over rolls & nuts.  Combine the melted butter, brown sugar & cinnamon and drizzle  over buns.  Place waxed paper (that has been lightly sprayed with cooking  spray & excess wiped away with paper towel) over top. Let rise  overnight.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, until browned.  (Second time I made these, I doubled sugar, butter, & cinnamon!) CHILLI DOG CASSEROLE   1 pkg. (8) hot dog buns   1 pkg. (8) hot dogs (use more if you like)   1 can Chilli (15 oz. without beans, use more if you want)   1 small onion (chopped)   2 cups shredded cheese   mustard       DIRECTIONS: Pre-heat oven 350 degrees   In a 9" x 13" baking pan, break up hot dog buns (bite size) and spread in pan.   Cut up hot dogs (about 1/2" size) spread over buns.   Spoon/spred chilli over hot dog/buns.   Sprinkle onions over all.   Squirt mustard over entire mixture (don't spread...just make a few lines both ways across mixture)   Cover with shredded cheese.   Bake until cheese is melted and bubbly.   (Hint: If using extra hot dogs & chilli, don't add extra buns.)            COLA CHICKEN  (And more variations of recipe)  (My favorite: Wings or Ribs)    4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts  1 cup catsup  1 12oz. can cola (pepsi, coke, etc.)    Put chicken in a non-stick pan.  Mix together catsup and cola, pour over chicken.  Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat and cook 45 minutes.  (turning chicken a few times, while cooking...to prevent from  sticking to pan)  Uncover, turn up the heat and continue to cook until the sauce  becomes thick and adheres to the chicken.  It turns into the most incredible BBQ sauce. Yummmm!    You can double the recipe and use more pieces of  chicken....wings...would be ideal...add some hot  sauce....presto "Hot  Wings"!   I have used Ribs, just as good.     I tried this recipe with 'meatballs'....was equally  as good...served over rice.    I found another variation.....omit the catsup and add a small  jar of Salsa (any variety).     I have tried using Salsa (omitting the catsup....not).  You'd think a recipe with only '3' ingredients couldn't be  messed up....wouldn't you??  Well...while I was preparing to fix the 'Cola Chicken' recipe  using Salsa.....I was also trying to carry on a conversation with my  husband...(just proves...I can't do two things at once)....mixed  Salsa & Catsup (before I realized I was supposed to leave out  the catsup) & Cola........still turned out really tasty (to me)...might  be a little sweeter than some of you like.    I fixed chicken wings, (using the above recipe)  but...I added the spices from a MILD (I don't care for "HOT") Buffalo Wings packet...(the kind you get to bake in the oven).....I thought it was really good.....(but you/I can't find a 'bad' way to fix chicken).    Finally....!! I fixed the 'SALSA' chicken......that's good , too.    Another (bright)idea.....I thought of trying......replace the  catsup with a bottle of Shrimp Cocktail Sauce...and add a bag of (pop corn) shrimp.....!   Fixed the shrimp with cocktail sauce......eh...wasn't all that  great...was OK...probably won't be fixing it again.    Also tried beef stew cuts......that was pretty good.....I can see  myself making this again.  Served both over rice.....think the stew cuts would have been just as  good over noodles.    How about using the little cocktail wieners/sausages?  Gonna try some butterfly cut pork chops.boneless pork chops..pork steak.  How about Vienna Sausages ?? Ummm!  POT ROAST  Your choice of beef or pork (to fit crock-pot)  1 pkg. dry Ranch dressing mix  1 pkg. dry Italian dressing mix  1 pkg. dry Brown Gravy mix  1 cup water  Put beef in pot.  Mix together all the dry mixes.then add water pour over meat and cover & cook on high 4-6 hours.  Until meat is tender.  The first time I mad it I didnt have the Italian Dressing mix.so I added a pkg. of Onion Soup Mix.I have to say I liked that better.  If you use more water you might want to add more Brown Gravy mix.            MARINATED VEGGIE SALAD   1 lb. can French style green beans   1 lb. can small peas   1 lb. can white corn   1 - 4oz. jar pimento (chopped)   1 cup shopped onion   1 cup chopped celery   1 cup chopped green pepper   1 cup sugar (I used artificial sweetener)   2/3 cup vinegar (I used red wine vinegar)   1/2 cup cooking oil   1 tsp. salt   1 tsp. pepper     1.)Pour green beans, peas, corn & pimento in a colander to drain over a   large bowl. Discard 1 1/2 cups of liquid.   2.)Put veggies in a large bowl and fold in

gTITuA7taa	Modern research laboratories came up with chemical products that are intensely sweet but have few or no calories - artificial sweeteners. Health experts say that artificial sweeteners let diabetics enjoy pop, candy, and even ice cream, without consuming sugar. This is a plus, according to experts, but not a necessity, since most diabetics are allowed some sugar in their diets. Even for weight control, sugar substitutes do not work magic; although their use has increased in the past 20 years, studies show that Americans are becoming increasingly obese. Most studies also show that dieters experience no greater weight loss with the use of artificial sweeteners, possibly because artificially sweetened foods may still be high in fat.|`|bnJPvsVWaa	It seems to benefit Oncologists the most.|`|EsVjwKPAaa	go to googles.    coz what i know artificial sugars are not healthy.. there is such thing they call that here in philippines.. now, it is banned coz it's harmful.|`|YnHYhCnlaa	You must look at the effects on the human body first:    a) an assault on the nervous system, destroying nerve endings, very high chance of increasing nerve degenerating diseases in later age  b) the body's energy receptors activate when the liver ingests artificial sweeteners, making the body believe it is about to receive energy, instead it receives no energy and therefore the person remains in a suspended state of hunger for up to 2 hours. usually people will eat something to satisfy this hightened sence of hunger, hence obese people drinking diet drinks.    So the benefits:  1) the new sweetener 'neotame' produces about 13000 times the taste of sugar, therefore in can be put in products and in such small amounts that you don't have to included in the consumer label as this is less than 1% of the product (benefits the producers of neotame)  2) unlike aspartame, neotame does not break down at high temperatures therefore it can be put in all sorts of products aspartame could not be used, such as cookies, bread, children's foods, to name a few.  3) a range of companies stand to Benefit as the population gets sicker, fatter, more neurotic. The usual suspects, chemical companies, pharmaceutical companies. People that work for these companies would never ingest the stuff.  4) for the general population the benefit is a shorter life therefore they will pay less taxes in whole. In other words, NO BENEFITS    I can only imagine who is behind this doublespeak thesis.

AA10970943	No, not necessarily an idiot.    It's Pica    Pica is the intentional and compulsive consumption of non-food substances. It occurs worldwide and is common among people of either sex and of all ages and races. Pica is often associated with nutritional deficiencies or toxicities, and is of special concern among young children and pregnant women.    Geophagia is the consumption of earth and clay. Amylophagia is the consumption of starch and paste, and pagophagia is the eating of ice. The fourth category includes the consumption of ash, chalk, antacids, paint chips, plaster, wax, and other substances.    People appear to be driven to consume these substances by nutritional deficiencies, but pica is not necessarily correlated with poor nutritional status. The nutritional hazards most frequently associated with pica are lead poisoning and iron deficiency anemia.|`|URHkLqeKaa	You probably have a medical condition named Pica which causes people to eat unusual things.

There are many references to it in any Google search, as well as in Wikipedia. It is typically described as a craving, and sometimes actually supplies trace minerals that the person otherwise would not get in their diet.   Sometimes that behavior is learned, if someone is raised in an area or culture where the practice is common. From the first link in the source list below: "http://geography.about.com/cs/culturalg...    ====  People around the world eat clay, dirt or other pieces of the lithosphere for a variety of reasons. Commonly, it is a traditional cultural activity which takes place during pregnancy, religious ceremonies, or as a remedy for disease. Most people who eat dirt live in Central Africa and the Southern United States. While it is a cultural practice, it also fills a physiological need for nutrients.  ===    However, the clay itself can cause problems, and this is made worse if the material has been contaminated with any toxin. From the second link below: "http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/...    ===  Many of the women who engage in kaolin-specific pica complain of constipation. Some even suffer ruptured colons. Low blood-hemoglobin levels, a sign of anemia, are common, because the ingestion of kaolin inhibits absorption of iron from foods. Those who eat clay at the expense of healthier foods often develop malnutrition. Since kaolin-specific pica typically begins during pregnancy, there may be consequences for the unborn child. Women should be discouraged from engaging in pica, especially during pregnancy.  ===    If you can, look at the third link posted in the Source section below (from emedicine), it has quite a good discussion about this.|`|doz7RIoeaa	Go see a psychiatrist|`|WvqRJow1aa	It's a genuine medical disorder and you should undergo therapy for it.

Tut1ZZU1aa	Yes, you can make them a couple of days in advance. Just cover them with cling-film and keep them in the fridge - they should be fine.     Also, if you're planning on having a sauce or something with them, I would wait until just before serving to pour it over.    Here's a lovely recipe from Rachel Allen for panna cotta with raspberries:    Serves: 4-6  Prep: 10 min, Plus 2 hrs setting  Cook: 5 min    Ingredients:  300ml Cream  30g caster sugar  1 vanilla pod, split lengthways  1 gelatine leaf  Raspberries, to serve    Method:     1. Put the cream, sugar and vanilla pod in a saucepan and slowly bring up to a simmer. Turn off the heat and leave to infuse.    2. Meanwhile put the gelatine leaf into a bowl of water. After 3-4 minutes it will have softened completely. At that point, take it out of the water and put into the saucepan with the hot cream.    3. Whisk gently until the gelatine dissolves, if the cream has cooled down too much you might need to reheat it slightly with the gelatine.    4. Pour into little ramekins, pretty glasses, little cups or whatever you fancy. Leave for 2 hours in the fridge to set. Serve with raspberries or some gorgeous sweet strawberries.    Cook's notes: panna cotta should be quite soft and wobbly in consistency, but if you like you can turn it out - just oil the ramekin before you fill it with the mixture.    If you want a slightly lighter panna cotta, use half milk : half cream or ? cream : ? milk.

Good vodka is notoriously pure alcohol and is the spirit least likely to give you a hangover, compared with wine, rum or whiskey for example. maybe you got a worse hangover because you mixed drinks?

KWhKwgsSaa	How to Make Margarine    Introduction  Originally made by churning ox fat and cream, margarine has come a long way since its introduction in 1870. Margarine is easy to spread and can be used in numerous recipes. Making margarine at home is an easy, cost-effective alternative to store-bought varieties.    Instructions  Difficulty: Easy  Things You'll Need        * Blender or food processor      * Airtight container or jar      * 1/2 cup milk or soy milk      * 1 cup oil      * 1 tsp. liquid lecithin      * Lemon juice      * Dash of turmeric      * 1/2 tsp. salt, or to taste      * Additional flavorings (optional)    Steps    Step One  Place the milk in blender or food processor first to aerate it and make it creamy. Blend on the highest setting for about 1 minute.    Step Two  Pour in oil and continue to blend until the mixture is emulsified. It takes a minute or two to mix the milk and oil together in order to reach the consistency you need for smooth margarine.    Step Three  Drop in liquid lecithin. Lecithin is an emulsifying agent which helps keep the milk and oil from separating, eliminating the need to remix the margarine before each use.    Step Four  Add lemon juice. The acidity in the lemon juice helps maintain the freshness of the margarine.    Step Five  Put in a dash of turmeric for coloring. Turmeric is concentrated, so it only takes a small amount.    Step Six  Sprinkle in the salt and blend on low for a few more seconds to thoroughly mix all ingredients.    Step Seven  Put the margarine in an air tight container or jar. Store in the refrigerator for up to three weeks.    Tips & Warnings        * Any type of oil may be used; however avoid ones that have an overpowering flavor. Good choices are olive, canola or sunflower oils.      * Once you prepare it, you can flavor the margarine with garlic, cinnamon or any other herb or spice you desire. Add to the mixture and continue to blend until dispersed.      * If margarine becomes too soft, place it in the refrigerator to firm back up.      * You can make another variation of homemade margarine by combining 1 cup of oil with 1 cup of softened butter. Blend together until creamy. Be sure not to melt the butter before using. Instead let it soften at room temperature.|`|AA10120901	Here are some sites to look at.Very informative    Happy cooking
