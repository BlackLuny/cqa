I have been paying them for a year with 10 months to go. I moved to Virginia a few months ago and had been mailing my payments...(they were cashing) I called them up to find out my Payoff amount because I want to pay it in full and the phone # is disconnected.

20090205192114AA3wxIo	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My 1995 Ford Ranger is getting terttible gas mileage. Why is this?	1995 Ford Ranger    2WD Automatic regular cab      I bought it used with 183,000 miles and I originally never got any less than 25-26 MPG with a combination of 50/50 city and highway driving. The Ranger currently has 224,000 miles and now I'm lucky if I see 18-20 MPG highway. Why is this? It can't be due to high mileage because again I bought it with high mileage in the first place.       I've replaced the EGR valve, water pump, heater control valve, timing belt, serpentine belt, fuel filter and nothing helps. My tires are all properly inflated as well. Could it possibly be the o2 sensor? I've never had that changed before. Any ideas? 18-20 MPG is V6 territory for crying out loud.      BTW, my "check engine" light died out on me last Fall and now my truck won't let me get the codes when I take it to Advance or Pep Boys.

20090205161848AAxS9XE	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	I recently had my car repo'ed.?	So I recently had my car repo'ed because the lady I had talked to on the phone about my car straight up lied to me. I was behind a payment on my car loan ($214), and it was getting really hard to pay because I had to pay bi-weekly and I was really ripped off becuse I was paying $365 a month for a 2003 Dodge Neon. Anyways, she said that when a loan is 28 days late, then they come to repo the car. And I basically asked her what it would take to not repo it. This was last Tuesday when I had talked to her. I owed $214 plus another 182 to bring me current. I asked her if I made my car payment (182) plus $100 on the 3rd if they would not repo it and then I would just pay the remaining $100 or so the following week. She said if I paid $182 plus $114, then they would more than likely accept that. So I said, okay. So I figured everything would be fine and dandy. I got a letter on Saturday stating that if I didn't bring my account current they would terminate my loan, sue me or a combination. I figured it was just a standard letter since I had spoke to her the same day the letter was printed off.       Well, I leave to go pay my car payment on Tuesday and my car is gone! She straight up lied to me! So I go in there and talk to her about it and she said that she told me that I had to bring my account current before the 31st because they couldn't allow a deliquent account to carry over into the next month. Which, my step dad was sitting RIGHT there when I asked her, because he told me to ask her if they'd accept $100 on top of my regular car payment. She wouldn't even accept the payment I was going to bring her. She said I would have to pay $396.50 plus the $100 repo fee. And if I don't pay that in 10 days, then they sell my car to an auction and if the price sold at the auction doesn't cover the amount of my loan (6600), they're going to sue me for the rest (yeah, good luck with that. I'm a recent college grad. I don't have ANYTHING. That car was my only posession).      Anyways, I desperately need a car. My credit isn't absolutely horrendous. What are the chances of me being able to go to another buy here/pay here place, explain to them my situation and try to get another car that is cheap? I just need a car to get me around. I mean, I held up my end up the bargain, Auto Credit USA did not do the same. Its not like I was refusing to give them money. I tried to go in there and pay them, and she said it was out of her hands now.       There's still a small chance my dad might be able to come through and help me get my car out of repo so I can at least have a car to use as a trade in and get a different car and get out of that loan. I don't want to be a customer of a company that's going to lie to me.

I've opted for purchasing a CB Radio instead of Cell Phones to use during our trip from California to Montana in a few months.   But I don't know anything about them except you can use them to communicate with other people.   Do you have to pay a monthly fee in order to use them like you would with a cell phone?   And do they get good reception?   My credit is shot so we would have to go with Metro PCS if we bought Cell Phones and their reception isn't all that great especially in the mountains from what I hear.

20090205194905AAwQYZx	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Go out of state for a IS300 or stay in the state for Supra?	moneys not the problem... it's the distance.....      My favorite car is the 2001-2005 Lexus IS300 and have always wanted one and with Manual Transmission.      The only thing that sucks is that theres not a lot of IS300 in my state with Manual Gear... Most of them are over mileage and the owners are asking way to much for the car! Like lets say the car has 100,000 miles on it or more and the owner still wants like $13,000 or more for the car... it's not worth it!      So my other option is fly out of the state and get myself one in Cali or Florida! Most that I can only have 40,000 or less mileage on them and the price on them are only around $12,000.      The only thing is, my parents wont let me go out of state to buy my car. So whats my second option? A Toyota Supra!       Should I buy it? I found 4 Twinturbos around 40-80 mileages and asking for $23,000 or less....      Should I convince my parents to go out of state and spend a extra $2000 on flying there and shipping the car back... or should I just get the Toyota Supra???

20090205192256AAl0bXC	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Ford	My 4 cyl 1995 Ford Ranger is getting terrible gas mileage. Why is this?	1995 Ford Ranger    2WD Automatic regular cab      I bought it used with 183,000 miles and I originally never got any less than 25-26 MPG with a combination of 50/50 city and highway driving. The Ranger currently has 224,000 miles and now I'm lucky if I see 18-20 MPG highway. Why is this? It can't be due to high mileage because again I bought it with high mileage in the first place.       I've replaced the EGR valve, water pump, heater control valve, timing belt, serpentine belt, fuel filter and nothing helps. My tires are all properly inflated as well. Could it possibly be the o2 sensor? I've never had that changed before. Any ideas? 18-20 MPG is V6 territory for crying out loud.      BTW, my "check engine" light died out on me last Fall and now my truck won't let me get the codes when I take it to Advance or Pep Boys.

20090205182844AApiPqj	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Power steering and wheels locked up in my 2001 Lexus RX300?	Early yesterday icy roads sent me into a telephone pole, totaling my Lexus RX. Before I hit the pole, the car's abs malfunctioned, and the steering wheel locked, making it impossible for me to try and steer the car. are the brakes and steering wheel supposed to lock up? I thought abs stood for ANTI lock braking system? So why did my brakes lock? And the steering wheel? Had the steering wheel not been locked, I would have been able to avoid the pole, maybe even maintain control and stay on the road. I get that the brakes might have been a malfunction, but do you know if the steering is supposed to lock? If not, is the Lexus corporation liable for the damages? The wheel locking was the main reason I hit the pole.

I notice that the automatic car automatically short shifts into 5th gear. Yes I noticed the braking time is worse just because it stays in 5th until you press the gas or your at a complete stop.     Stick I always shift at the proper times and stay in the gear that I feel it should be in for example 5th to 3rd blah blah blah    But if I am always around 3000rpm in the Stick and 2000rpm in the automatic, wouldn't I be saving more gas in the automatic, just by a tad bit?

I was riding it a couple days ago and it fired up on it's third kick. Then the throttle cable broke, so I parked it. I had to take the carb off the bike because the people at the shop wanted to see if it was set up for two throttle cables. After I got the cables I put the bike back together and I couldn't get it started. I put a new plug in it before I rode it the last time, but I replaced it with a new one anyway. Still couldn't get it started. If it wasn't pouring down rain, I would try to push start it. Does anyone know the problem or have an idea of what it might be? Any suggestions would help.

So I got caught driving without a license back in october. went to court judge told me license would be suspended for 6 months now.    as far as i know suspension does not start until i get  my license.      now when the suspension is over im going/need to drive to get to school/work.      So my question is About how much would my car insurance be? I know most of u guys don't know but if you can give me a good estimate? and if this has happen to anyone or any friends of yours would greatly appreciate it if you can tell me about how much do they pay for insurance!      As far as i know you pay it every 6 months so how much would it be? ABOUT?      I also have heard that whatever the price is for my insurance, it would stay around the same for about 3 years until my ticket expires which then my insurance would go down in price thats if i don't get into any accidents and drive safely, Is that true?      Thanks!

20090203065758AAq0wt1	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	How can my car still be leaking oil?	I am not a mechanic, but I have always been able to do minor repairs to all my vehicles.  I have a 96 Toyota Camry that developed an oil leak back before Christmas.  About a week ago, I decided to correct the problem myself.  After inspection under the car, I found that the oil was leaking from the oil pan, where it bolts up to the block.  I went to the parts store and inquired about this, so they sold me a cork gasket and a tube of sealant.  I removed the oil pan, cleaned everything off as required and re-installed the oil pan....waited about 3 hours, cranked up the car and it still leaked.        I called Toyota, and they said on this particular car, there was NO gasket required.  I went to Toyota and bought a tube of their sealant, took the oil pan back off again, followed all instructions and it still leaks.        The oil pan is not bent, damaged etc.  The block is not damaged where the oil pan bolts to....  I just cannot figure out how it can still be leaking.  Is there any "trade" secret as to how to stop the leak.....shy of welding the oil pan to the block.  LOL

20090205202147AAc3C8M	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	Financing & Loan for new Motorcycle?	I'll try to make this as short as I can, so its not tedious to read.      I've been riding a trail bike, Honda CRF230F for around a year now at a nearby Motocross track. The bike for one isn't built for motocross, and it is about time for me to move up. I'm looking at getting a 250F from Yamaha, or Honda, ok, now onto the dilemma.      I'm 19 years old, currently enrolled in college, so I dont have a full-time job. I'm still under my parents, so they take care of mostly everything, my father is the one who bought the 230F. He's gone and unavaliable for awhile now, so I'm unable to ask for his help on this subject, so I am posting in yah.answers.       I'm inexperienced in purchasing a new bike, or automobile for that matter (yes, i've decided new, over used). The bike I'm looking at getting is around $6,500.00. I make less than that a year with my weekend job.       How do I go about buying this bike from a dealer? Set up financing for 24 months, or 60 months? How much per month?       Also, would I need a loan? How do I go about getting pre-approved for a motorcycle loan? I'm not even sure how loans work... would i have to pay that off every month along with the bike payments?      sorry for the long post. I'd like to see what you guys think, then talk to my dad when i get a chance, any help/tips will help,      Thanks      (PS if your wondering why he just doesnt buy the 250F for me, he has already let me know that he will not be buying another bike for me, i'll have to do it myself)

My 96 Chevy 1500 with the Vortec 5.0 has been giving me S%^# in the cold mornings. Sometimes, it will start one morning, the next day not so lucky. It sounds like it's getting fuel because I can feel the engine want to start. When it does start in the cold, it sputters to life. The fuel pressure is in the recommended pressure range.  I recently gave it a standard tune-up with new plugs, plug wires, air filter, fuel filter, all that jazz. This engine has no distributor. I don't get it because it starts on a dime after 10 minutes of being warmed up. There are no codes on the system because I did a scan at my school shop.      Please fellow auto mechanics, what is your opinion on why this engine loves to be garbage in the morning?

20090205212051AADeN1y	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Problems with Car Mechanic – should I consult with a lawyer?	I purchased a car on a public auto action in August 18th 2008. The car was totaled from the driver’s side and need some serious reconstruction work.  I talked to the shop owner and he said that I made a poor choice buying a car with such a serious damage and it looked like someone else already tempered with the car.  I told him that, I’m willing to put it back on action but he said that he would talk to his mechanics to see if it was fixable.  Few days later, the owner of the shop told me that he can fix the problem and that he need 4.5K to do it because of the extent of the damage.  He delayed working on my car.  A month later the car was not even half complete. Then he told me that he needs more money because it will cost much more to fix it.  I refused to pay it because he still had some money left over from my fist payment (I was able to tell this because he showed me his recites).  He asked for 1.6K more to complete this job.  I was really disappointed and didn’t know what to do.  I decided to pay him this fee so he could finish my car.  He started fixing it...       When I was in the shop, I noticed that the front of the car was pulled too far into one direction and there was a gap of half an inch.  Then when I looked inside, I noticed that top cover (styrofoam / cushion), of the driver side had, was cracked and it happened when they were fixing it.   I asked him what did you guys do and he said that it was like that when they got it.  I was the one who took out the fragile parts from the inside when I prepared the car for repair and I didn’t see that damage. He insisted that it was like that.  Two more weeks went by and the car was pulled into the right direction and the gap in the front was fixed however when they pulled the pumper into one direction they disturbed the inside plastic covering so my car is all tilted inside.  He still didn’t find me my driver’s side airbag.   The car had more scratches on the front when he took it trough a car wash and it scratched the car completely.  The shop owner denies this and says that its just oil/grease from the brushed.  The rear bumper has deep scratches that are very obvious.        This car is a totally a mess.  The car was not fixed and instead I have all these problems (large scratches at the front, the inside front plastic is all out of alignment that the left compartment at the front cannot be opened, the airbag is missing, the back bumper had deep scratches, the top Styrofoam on the drivers side has a large crack).  If you do a quick glance, you will not notice anything but if you take a closer look this car is totally a mess.  I even my rear set was painted blue when they were painting the exterior of the car.        I don’t know what to do.  I played the guy to fix my car.  He agreed to it but he did a very poor job.  In the beginning he did admit that the car was totaled very bad and need a lot of work but then I told him that I’m willing to take a lose and sell it back on auto action.  He assured me that he can fix it but he didn’t.  He didn’t even use new part or replayed his damage that his workers did to my car.  He denies all of the damage.  I would like to just give him my car and have my 9.2K back (3.5K price of the car and 5.7K to fix it).        Unfortunately, I’m a full time college student and I don’t have lots money to pay for a lawyers.  What should I do?  Should I still take this person to court and ask the court to make the shop owner cover my layer fees?  Or should I just try to fix this car all buy my self and hope I can sell it for anything that I can?  All I wanted was some good and affordable car but this turned into a mess.  I didn’t argue much with the owner, there was no point because he speaks from “experience” and always finds a excuse for everything that I talk about him.  It’s been in a shop of almost three months and the car is just a mess.        Any advice will help.   Thank you!

20060711160712AAgWyd5	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Pneus Pretos?!?	Olá!                        Li uma pergunta sobre o motivo dos pneus de "carros" serem pretos. Como n?o é possível adicionar resposta à uma pergunta já fechada, gostaria de acrescentar um detalhe sobre este assunto. Por falar nisso, os pneus de motos, bicicletas, tratores, caminh?es, etc, também s?o pretos. O motivo da cor preta é que durante a fabrica??o os pneus recebem carbono para aumentar sua resistência ao atrito com o piso em que rodam, principalmente o asfalto. Daí sua cor ser preta.              Valeu?!      Abra?os.
