They're not too flashy or anything, plus their insurance rates are generally pretty low.  Just like any other car, the steering and breaks may take a couple of drives to get used too.  Overall, it's a pretty good car, and the price isn't that bad.

56a572fde5f78c1444702e92a41b54faaa	I would start with a visit to the dealer---yeah, it might be a little pricier than asking on Yahoo! Answers, but at least you will find out exactly what the error is.   And once you know what the error is, it is usually much easier to get it fixed somewhere more---how to say this---reasonably.  <br>  <br>  I found this on the web, by another owner, about the climate control light:<br>  <br>  All you need to do is start your van. (if you are unsure what knob or lever is which I am looking in the manual for proper terms) Then slide your temp lever all the way to the left (full cold). Then turn the Mode Control to 'panel' (the one that sends air to your face only). Then turn the 'blower switch' to all the way to full. Now go to the leftmost three buttons. Press the top one (rear wiper on constant) and the bottom one (rear wiper washer fluid). Hold these two for a few seconds. Once the lights come on solid then begin to flash you can let go. The AC will now calibrate. You will feel the air blow out of all the different zones at different intervals and see lights come on and go off. Then after a minute or two the top bottn you pressed will be slowly flashing. This means it has been completed (I actually let it run for 5 more minutes just in case something else started blinking).

They too are powered by a V12 bi-turbo engine but the displacement on those is 6.0 L<br>  <br>  The AMG 55 ( actually a 5.4 L unit enlarged from the older M113 5.0 L engine is not only found in the SLK55 but also in the G55.  In the SLK, it is naturally aspirated.  In the G, it is helped along by a supercharger ( or "kompressor" in German.  That is why you'll see that word on the side of the fenders ).<br>  <br>  Good catch on the AMG 63 being a 6.2 L engine and the historical reference on calling it the 63, not many people know that.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  The AMG 55 engine's actual displacement is 5439 cc.  Rounded off, it's closer to 5.4 L
2MII9HuKaa	when building a box often the factory specifications are absolutely design specific to the sub but the most important part is the cubic volume of air the enclosure takes up more then the dimensions so when you see boxes on youtube that look bigger sometime this is because certain trunks can't fit boxes of exact specs and the builder needs to sacrifice height for width to allow the sub to perform in his/her car other times it is because some people think bigger boxes = better and this is silly cause a box that is too big will make the driver preform poorly if there is too much air to displace same thing with a box that is too small... but a perfect example of boxes that don't use exact factory specs but change dimensions to allow certain drivers to fit in tight spaces are the JL audio stealth boxes check them out at www.jlaudio.com anyways i hope this helped you cheers! (P.S. BUILDING AN AMP RACK ON THE SIDE OF YOUR BOX SHOULDN'T IMPACT YOUR DRIVER/ENCLOSURE BUT BE CAREFUL NOT TO SUFFOCATE YOUR AMP COULD LEAD TO AMP OVERHEATING)|`|9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	As long as your sub is isolated from the outside (apart from the port) then having an extension on the enclosure is fine.  So if your internal volume is correct and the enclosure is tuned properly the extension won't effect the sound at all as long as it is not sharing the same airspace.<br>  <br>  Alpine's recommended enclosure will give you decent performance but you can do better in most situations.  In my opinion using a larger internal volume can have some extra benefits.  How much larger you should make it depends on what you are looking for.<br>  <br>  What type of sound are you looking for from your sub?  That greatly determines what I would recommend for your enclosure.  If you let me know what sound you are looking for I may be able to help you determine the best internal volume/tuning frequency for your enclosure.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!

They can repair it and re balance it for about $15.00, a lot cheaper than another tire. Good luck.|`|0TiCSGKtaa	go to a local tire shop and get the tire plugged
MdydZP8Kaa	Hell yeah! I absolutely hate BMW. Our family has a CL65 AMG, and I despise anyone that has a BMW. Mercedes is faster, more fancy and has alot more class!|`|Yv2HVP5saa	Of course. You see the mercedes-benz resembles a good person, aristocratic and succesful person. Whereas for the BMW, it resembles more like badass rich dude with a style. So in short the good guys drives the mercedes and the bad guys drives a bmw|`|d9b785d26fc737c5c76ef50b92493ea8aa	Disagree, I currently own 3 Benz', and have own a total of 5 in my life.  Great car, but I also have owned a 5 series and an X5 and they are great too.  The Benz has a bit more of polish to it, but overall they are both great engineering marvels. Benz = a great opera BMW = a great concert (symphonic).|`|JtPu0KBXaa	Yes. I don't know who you are or where you're from, but if you drive a Benz I'm gonna torch a bush in your lawn!!!|`|AA10980692	I suppose some people do. I prefer Mercedes and have had a better experience with them, but that doesn't mean I hate BMW or don't respect their products for what they are. The M5 is a happening car. An E55 AMG is, too. It's a matter of personal taste.|`|3W43J3rWaa	No, only BMW lovers hate us because we have better cars, LOL|`|Nt4fU89Naa	I think it is, its more of a competition thing.|`|gOQ5mZ7Xaa	Well I don't own a Mercedes-Benz but I am a Merc lover and I'm not particularly fond of Beemers. Mercs provide class that only a car that is three times the price of a Beemer can provide...|`|RQzsmvfiaa	Yeah. It's like the Ford/Chevy argument- people with too much time on their hands that need to get a life. Old Mercedes were the pinnacle of everything grand. Newer ones suck. The reliability on them is horrible. BMW is actually a better car at this time. One of my buddies is a MB Tech at an MB dealer. He told me " If I hate you, I'll tell you to buy a new Mercedes." The AMGs seem to be a bit better than the others in durability but that's quite a premium on an already expensive car. BMWs tend to be sportier overall, but for luxury, you can't deny it's truly there in a Mercedes. Still, a breakdown is a breakdown and I've seen more than a handful of newer Benzes in my neighborhood alone being towed to the dealer.
g5RS83paaa	I don't think it's true, I think people that appreciate well-made cars love both|`|avvFb7Ddaa	Mercedes, Audi and BMW all have one thing in COMMON.<br>  <br>  They are all German engineered and are ALL great cars.<br>  <br>  If anything Audi is in the same Class as Mercedes and BMW. And don't say it isn't true, have you looked at the prices lately and what these cars offer.<br>  <br>  Not to mention Audi's, in my opinion look far more stylish than any BMW M3 or M5. Audi's have more of a design and curve to their models today.|`|8oG11Mq4aa	My family has owned both and I honestly prefer BMW hands down to Mercedes. <br>  <br>  But, I don't hate Mercedes - that's immature & silly to hate a car company! Their AMG models are very nice but I can honestly said I do not prefer them to any M BMW engine. <br>  <br>  I am just more attracted to Bimmer's, I like the way their engines handle/sound and their steering is far superior.  BMW's are for more driving pleasure. Mercedes are nice for a smooth ride. <br>  <br>  But I do see some Mercedes I am attracted to from time to time. <br>  <br>  They've always been rival companies. At least both BMW & Mercedes are mature enough companies and don't knock other companies down ... i.e. like Audi and Lexus do. (Which, they both don't compare to the top Dogs BMW & Mercedes!)|`|a0565811de871e19a5c2a7b27aeadf50aa	This question is so moronic.  Ask another question when your brain has fully developed.|`|Lrw0Chojaa	NO I dont think that is true <br>  my brother likes bmw though more then mercedes and he has owned both brands of vechiles|`|zsanVrOEaa	lol. definitely not. i own a bmw, and my boyfriend has a mercedes. i love them both. great cars.|`|NeAMuXZSaa	as an (old) BMW, I love the styling of some current and many old Mercedes.

Ci1tD7Fbaa	You should be alright. Start out with a small turbo. See how the block holds up. Whats the compression ration on the motor now?  <br>  <br>  <br>  Do you have performance piston rings as well?<br>  You should look at the edelbrock performer x series turbo kits. They are around 3700.00. But its the whole package. Comes with a bunch of crap.
9wItgN6Taa	Car batteries can lose their top-charge and die with just the radio on if the car is in A/C because car batteries have charge sent to them from the alternator while the car is running and when the car is off your just feeding off the battery alone and killing its top-charge, its best just to not leave your car on A/C for long periods of time or you will find you go through batteries quite fast and about $50 for some car batteries its just not worth it|`|54wgMlSFaa	does the battery die or does the radio shut off.and it sounds like either a GPS power cord or a iPOD hook up.it wouldnt be draining the battery.so it must be something else.
gstBWswfaa	1 you defeat the purpose of the type X by putting it into a ported enclosure.<br>  It is a EXTREEEMLY high sound quality woofer<br>  its not meant to be a loud woofer the type R is actually a bit louder.... <br>  It needs to be put into a sealed box...<br>  i have my type X in a 1.196 cub ft box<br>  "those specifications were given to me from my buddy that builds subs"|`|9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	I would say that enclosure you listed wouldn't be too bad.  Again, it depends on the overall sound you are looking for.<br>  <br>  The Type-X is meant to be more of a SQ woofer that is powerful.  It will give you the best SQ in a sealed enclosure.  However, it also works well in a ported enclosure.  If you want a little more output then a ported enclosure is the way to go.  You can still get a very smooth response but with a little extra low end output.  <br>  <br>  Bigger does not always equal better for a subwoofer enclosure.  2 cubes is a little larger then I typically go for the Type-X but that enclosure you listed would definitely work for giving you good output and good overall quality bass.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|70ayLPi9aa	if you want a good box check out the audioenhancers  they make boxes specifically for those subs and there deep ported i think you you get 1 1.5 cubic of extra space
b4751c132f82aabe6e11b8e5a37225b5aa	There are many factors involved on an exhaust's sound<br>  Muffler being the most prominent <br>  size of the pipe diameter and then length<br>  headers or manifolds<br>  camshaft<br>  catalytic converter<br>  number of cylinders<br>  engine size ; smaller engines tend to whine while large engines tend to rumble|`|ppM3JxgWaa	The biggest contributing factors are the size of your car's engine and the muffler/s on your car.  With the right combination of muffler/s, tailpipe/s, and exhaust tip/s you can improve your car's Vrrrrrr.  However, your 4 cylinder Honda Civic will never Vrrrrrrr the same as a Dodge Viper, no matter what exhaust you buy.|`|9SgD78JIaa	Mostly the muffler, but a nice set of headers help, too. Sometimes exhaust tips help, too.<br>  <br>  If you want it to really sound "Vrrrrrrrrr", then don't put an exhaust system on it at all, run straight motor:-D|`|68vcS4mqaa	the size of the can, the headers alwasy help. the brand, id get a "cat back" perfomanrcew exsaut. it sounds sooo mean.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	The muffler, or lack of one.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	Tail pipe with a baffle insertion makes it sound tough without the possibility of getting a ticket for not having a tail pipe.  Sounds like glass packs!
5xxuKzXPaa	i hate to say it but the wires to the fuel pump do not come from the inside directly. i would look for a relay that controls the pump it self.
pZvJpuJTaa	That depends on the contractual language of the policy you bought.  Read it, it's boring but at times can be informative, especially since you agreed to it.|`|Dmx94wJBaa	Actually, I have called my insurance and asked if I give some one permission to drive my car and it gets wrecked, will they be covered? They said yes. I also wrecked my mom's car about a year ago and I was not on her insurance but since she gave me permission, they did pay for it after the deductible. But is also depends on what kind of insurance you have on the car. And since it would be a DUI issue...I'm not really sure they would go for that. The best thing to do is call and ask your insurance.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	Not in the slightest.<br>  <br>  In fact, don't be surprised if they cancel your insurance right out.<br>  <br>  But beyond that, no, they are liable for your vehicle if it gets damaged by you, or by someone else hitting it.<br>  <br>  They will not cover another driver getting into an accident, and definitely not when there's a dui involved in it.<br>  <br>  Say goodbye to the car.
333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	If you don't change it now, the car will start to run poorly and eventually if it gets bad enough it won't run at all.  Air filters are under $20.00 for most cars, they usually sit on top or to either side inside of the front fenders in a box. <br>  <br>  Look in your owners manual for it's location or put the type of vehicle into a search engine to find it.  <br>  <br>  If you really can't afford a new one, then take the old one out and bang it on the ground and try to vacuum or blow some of the dirt out of it, it should last you a little longer.|`|gGBPPjLeaa	Gas milage will suffer 10% or more if it is really dirty, nothing else too bad will happen you will end up spending the money on gas probably so change it now, you will notice a performance decrease as well but other than that nothing serious.|`|pXtkhCkRaa	The air filter takes dust out of the air that is drawn into the motor to mix with petrol (or diesel,gas). The air & petrol is mixed together, goes into the cylinder, then the sparkplug fires, & this is how the motor works. If the filter gets too clogged less air can get in which results in the motor running (rich). In short, you are using more petrol than you should, & it is not good for the motor. Filters are not expensive, get one of your friends to buy one & put it in for you..|`|54wgMlSFaa	well it can prolly stretch.but it can suck a hole thru it and all the **** will go thru the filter.it happend on our trucks at work.cost 15000 for a new engine.but 4-5000 miles shouldnt hurt it.|`|2PIRaPDraa	The air filter filters air. It is a part.

3vt7GhVYaa	You say at high speeds.  If it is a warped rotor it will do at any speed and even feel like it is loping at slow speeds.  A tire being out of balance normally will vibrate at certain speeds whether braking or not.<br>  <br>  The only thing I can think of that will cause this is loose or worn wheel bearings.   If the wheel bearings are loose the rotor may be at a slight slant and when you brake the calipers will try to straighten it up to where it should be.  It will do this at any speed but not so noticeable at slower speeds.|`|XWoaAEGVaa	the shaking is a result of the tires being out of balance.any tire shop can balance and rotate all four tires for around $50.<br>  this is normal maintance that should be done at the same time as oil changes.<br>  <br>  IT WILL NOT KILL YOU !!!<br>  but it can crate more damage to the car over time due to vibration.|`|ZoAEoHl9aa	one of two thangs cause this<br>  <br>  1 warped rotors<br>  2 wheels need to be balanced<br>  <br>  warped rotors has to do with the brakes<br>  and wheels being needed to be balanced is something your local tire shop can do in about a hour for about 50 bucks|`|33l1SqrRaa	Time for new brakes and or rotars, they get warped over time from braking at high speeds.|`|3WL9AgwGaa	Your husband is right, it is serious, and you should get it checked. Its not necessarily a breakdown, could be that one of the wheels is a bit flat, or off balance. If it shakes when you brake hard it could just be ABS.<br>  These are just common once, but you should get it checked.|`|xqdRycvtaa	the rotors on the wheels are warped. This is caused by heavy braking, i.e going up fast to a stop light and braking hard to stop numerous times. The rotor builds up excessive heat and will make the rotor cool down too fast. I'd get it done a s soon as you can. It is serious but not life threatening. It does get annoying though.|`|AA11766020	There's two reasons that I know of that the steering wheels shakes. If it's just during braking I would say your front rotors are warped.

SP23 is the best all-around model of the range, whereas if you're looking for power and sportiness the MazdaSpeed 3 would certainly fulfill those criteria.|`|wra8Q7O3aa	I own 2008 Lancer myself and I give my own car a 6.5/10. Just three major things I don't like about the new lancers. One, the gas. The gas overall is average but could've been better. 29 mpg is not really good for a sedan 2.0L 4 cylinder car. The Corolla can get 34 mpg and its a 4 cylinder. My dad's 99' Honda Accord Coupe V6 is a 6 cylinder car that has 200 bhp and I can get 26-27 mpg with it. Two, the warranty. Mitsubishi's warranty sucks and they tend to not care about warranties as much and make excuses every second. Last, the paint. The paint purely sucks throughout the entire universe, seriously. You can scratch the paint off with your fingernails like my wife did to mine by accident. And the worst part of all, warranty doesn't work on it.<br>  <br>  The car itself is good, but Mitsubishi isn't any good. I can live with it as long as it doesn't break down or anything. But so far so good with 30000 miles on it without a problem. But eventually I am going to mod it later in the future. So its OK for me. Just make sure you can live with chipped paints all over your car.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, The Corolla is nice car. My cousin owns one and I test drove it. It was pretty quick and he had the XRS trim which is the 162 bhp one I think. I was sure that the gas was slightly better than the Lancer and handling as almost the same but the Lancer is still better with handling. The paint wasn't so cheap either and interior quality was pretty good. The look just didn't get to me though. The Lancer still had the upper hand on better looks. But you can't go wrong with a Corolla. Once you hop in and drive it, you probably won't get out.<br>  <br>  The Mazda 3, I really don't know of but I been hearing pretty much bad things about it not being reliable. But its a good car from what I am seeing. Just make sure you do your maintenance and you should be fine though. Its pretty common car as well. It can save gas pretty well as well. Out of three, I would put this one in the middle.|`|nLXKmcnBaa	depends on ur intentions.<br>  the lancer definitely if your going to mod it.<br>  then the mazda 3 if your keeping it stock<br>  and the corolla if you have no self estem|`|YTG3bCeDaa	Bah! All poor choices. Put down that Consumer Reports magazine and get a real car!|`|XG75rhKvaa	No matter how highly intelligent a monkey is, it's still a monkey! Now having said that, the more intelligent choice will be the Mazda 3. It is well built, comfortable with upgraded interior amenities. For the hard core "buy American" peeps, Ford has a large stake in Mazda. The Corolla is good but very plebian. The Lancer looks menacing and a little different which can be a good thing. You don't want to look like everyone else.|`|3WL9AgwGaa	Well, it depends how old are they. But if you are buying brand new I would personally go for the Lancer(much better looking). But if you consider price, quality, speed, economy I would still go for the Lancer :P<br>  <br>  As i said it is the best looking, if you get the basic one its not very expensive, has good choice of engines, and its Mitsubishi which means is superbly put together.

If its a manual transmission your clutch may have gone out in which if that's the case it won't turn over or anything.  <br>  <br>  If its an automatic and you aren't even getting a clicking noise then you may either have a bad starter, bad battery or its discharged enough that it won't turn over the starter.

AA11264416	well i have a 98 K1500 silverado with the K&N air intake kit, its the tube style that goes from the throttle body which sits where a carb would right on top of the intake manifold, and it goes to where the stock box would be, i love it, gives a better deeper sound when hauling a** but same sound when idling or just cruising, also it gave it better acceleration but also that could have been the true dual flowmaster exhaust working with it, if you have stock exhaust your acceleration might not feel much different unless you have a lot better exhaust, also just to point out, i had the exhaust on my truck before i installed the intake kit so it was the intake kit by itself that helped on acceleration, just my point is if it has stock exhaust then an air intake kit probably won't help to much for acceleration, think of an engine like a person, it has to breath in and out, if you breath in more air you have to get the air out just as fast, if you breath in a lot more ait but still slow you won't breath to good, thats like an engine with an air intake kit but with stock exhaust, hope that makes sense, also a tube style intake kit will help the hot air from the engine compartment go in the engine, the box around the fitler helps that, the open type that just screws on top of the carb will let the hot air from the exhaust get in the engine which isn't as good, i know on hot days its still going to be hot air going into the engine but it won't be as hot of air, so either way the air going into the engine on a tube intake kit won't be as hot, might not affect it enough to notice though on a hot day|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	I would go with the tube style, or just flip the air cleaner lid over, it will give you about the same sound.|`|x7yKGaEDaa	Most of the customers at my chevy dealership run the K&N ones that sit on the carb on the older silverados.Not only do these sound better they also give quicker throttle response.Best of luck with your choice.  <a href="http://www.autopartswarehouse.com/search/?N=9925+1588+4294965414+9194" rel="nofollow">http://www.autopartswarehouse.com/search...</a>|`|7HDWtqhOaa	See if AFE offers a kit for your truck, price is usually lower than K&N and works just as well|`|dDPFWyPjaa	K&N intakes are industry standard, I'd say tube style.|`|PzLcyrYoaa	tube style

jBIotay5aa	According to the spec on the Lanzar Vibe 286 you should get full power output at 4 ohms bridged across the two channels. Your safest configuration for this amplifier with the six coils you have would be to have 2 pairs of 3 coils in series(2x12ohm) and then to parallel these two sets of pairs. This will give you a resultant 6 ohm load across the bridged channels, a comfortable load for the amplifier and driving the speaker coils at approximately rated power of 500W/Coil.<br>  <br>  A better option would be the Optidrive 6000W monoblock, then to have 3 sets of 2 coils in series(3x8ohms), if you parallel these three sets you'll end up with a resultant impedance of 2ohms. This will result in a rated power of approximately 666W/Coil and have the benefit of the extra headroom due to the amplifier being 1ohm stable.|`|AA10906914	Match a mono amp with the total RMS watts of ALL subs @ 2 ohm and wire them like this -  <a href="http://i81.photobucket.com/albums/j230/sparky3489/TRI-SERIES-DUAL.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i81.photobucket.com/albums/j230/s...</a><br>  <br>  More info here <a href="http://spkrbox1.spaces.live.com" rel="nofollow">http://spkrbox1.spaces.live.com</a>|`|v5fEfmO8aa	Get yourself a Visonik V1004PB 1000 Watt 4 3 2 Channel Car Amp. t will definitely rock those speakers!

XQvWjkrSaa	DO NOT DRIVE ITuntil you fix this!  You can get hydralock and completely screw your motor up.  Take the air filter off, and dry it out as well as the intake tubing.  No water is supposed to be past the filter element.  Make sure you respray some oil on the outside of the filter after you clean it.  This keeps water from getting inside.  And be careful!

AA11766020	As to what Colonel Corn said, I wouldn't recommend retightening those head bolts for two reasons; They are torque-to-yield bolt, which means they are only meant for one time use. If you loosen these bolts up, there's a very good chance you'll completely blow the head gaskets and warp the heads/cams even more. The sweet smell you're smelling is anti-freeze. This may be caused by two conditions; Cracked heads or blown head gaskets. I just did head gaskets in a 2000 F-250 with 5.4 and it sucked dick right down to the last step. Good luck.

9SgD78JIaa	To be honest, an alternator that is going doesn't always just die. It definitely can stumble back and forth between working and not working. It appears you got it tested when it was working okay.  I'd bank on an alternator and don't get a re-manufactured one, either.<br>  <br>  If you decide to try and  replace the alternator, make sure your battery is fully charged, or it can burn a new alternator out.|`|OF64jyPSaa	change batt cables they might be corroded|`|3vt7GhVYaa	Have you checked to make sure the cables are indeed tight on both ends?  ie.. if the negative cable is loose where it bolts to the engine block the battery will not charge.

Do the tests that Tim said, but test for 13-15 volts with your lights, ac, and radio all on! A "sick" alternator will test good and charge enough to put out the alt light, but not enough to keep the battery fully charged. You will need to run the engine faster than idle speed for this test. The alternator will not give a maximum charge at idle speed. So, if you use all of this power while idling, and you do it often, the battery will finally fail!|`|6RuuSkDkaa	is the alt belt tight  if it is loose it could be slipping and not turning alt at proper speed  i believe that car has a spring loaded belt tensioner  is it putting proper tension on belt  is the voltage regulator working right  with car off take volt meter reading on your battery and it should be 12 volts  then start car and the reading should be 13.8 volts  if its not then the problem is in your charging system  if the reading is much over 13.8 volts then it could be overcharging your battery and ruining it  a cheap multi meter at wa-mart etc costs about 10 dollars and will help you track down the problem  anyway check belts and voltage and if that doesnt help repost with what you have found out and we will go from there  could be a broken charge wire or a fusable link thats bad  but those are places to start

d0I6zJpLaa	Try and persuade her into letting you drive with her in an area that is not that populated and is very open. A school parking lot is perfect if it is empty. Tell her that you want to practice your parking as well as turning. Tell her that this would help you a lot seeing as how you aren't going to be driving very fast. If you explain this to her, she should come around. If all else fails, just wait until you are 18 and then go take the test for your license at the DMV by yourself. As far as how long it takes to get your license, you just have to hold your permit for 6 months to be eligible to take the License test. 6 months or the age of 18, which ever comes first. In you case, you are already eligible for the test seeing as how you have had your permit for over a year now. But since you are under 18, you have to have a guardian with you.

LjTvdl3raa	It's a good deal if you have $3000 to put down! Hopefully you're only paying $200 a month for about 6 months, because anyhting more than that is just ridiculous. The Focus isn't too expensive of a car, even the brand new ones. I'd think that your monthly payments would be less per month if you're putting $3000 down though....Think your options through carefully. And keep in mind that as soon as you drive your brand new car off the lot, it's worth thousands of dollars less than what you'll be paying for it.|`|ULI9BZPIaa	I am not sure how a 2009 car is not worth anymore than $4200.  I just bought a 2009 Focus SES, which is the best model of the Focus line up.

Also, the Ford Focus has "mood lighting", which as much as the sales guy said it was corny, I think it's SWEET!  It depends what your interest rate is to know if you're getting a good deal or not really.
daw140ceaa	I'm guessing that you have two 4-ohm speakers and you're wiring them in parallel to get a 2-ohm load.<br>  <br>  The answer to your question is that the amplifier's power output will be split evenly between the two speakers (assuming they're identical).|`|exYJISb3aa	if it's parallel wired and it's 2 ohms its running at 1 ohm.  If it's 4 ohms and its parallel wired it's at 2 ohms.<br>  It will split the power up between the two speakers.|`|AA10132007	It depends.  2 2ohm speakers in parallel will be 1 ohm or if the speakers are 4 ohm then it will be  a 2 ohm load on the amp if you wire them in parallel.  The power will be split equally  between the speakers and if you amp is rated at 500watts @ 2 ohms the 4 ohm speakers wired in parallel will be getting 250w each.  But if it is 2 2ohm speakers in parallel and the amp is rated to be stable at 1 ohm it will mostly likely be putting out more than the 250w each it depends on the amp. If it isn't rated to be stable at 1 ohm then it will probably overheat the amp.|`|TAVJ8PsDaa	Ohms law say that two things wired in Parallel will result in on half of the sum of their impedance's in average resistance. Your 2-Ohm speakers will be treated as 1 Ohm total and will most likely not be stable and overload your 500 watt amp. They will both receive 500 watts. My advice is wire them in series to add more stability to your system or if you do want to wire them in parallel add a 1-2 Ohm resister and take the lower wattage. Good luck with your system!

TEJoVBnOaa	Synthetic oil is better than petroleum based oil.  Motor oil is a by product of making gasoline.  Synthetic oil is made specifically for it purpose.  Petroleum based oil has particles of varying sizes and shapes as well has a tendency to solidify at low temperatures.  Some synthetic manufacturers use what is called hyper-cracking.  This is basically where they filter the petroleum based oil, the result is smaller more uniform particles, but it is still petroleum.  (Some judge decided filtering = synthetic).  Synthetics typically do not break down even in harsh environments whereas petroleum based oils will.  This is one reason petroleum based oils are not used in jet engines. <br>  <br>  Mobile 1 was not the originator of synthetic oil and it is used in some cars by default.  This is only because it is not 100% synthetic it is "Fully Synthetic" which means hyper-cracked.  100% synthetic oils cannot be used on a new engine as the rings must have time to seat and they will not with true synthetic.<br>  <br>  AMSOIL is the original synthetic oil that was API certified and Mobile was second a few months afterwards.  AMSOIL guarantees their 100% synthetic oil for 25,000 miles.|`|ZoAEoHl9aa	royal purple oil is great oil to use <br>  pricey but very good<br>  i use castrol synthetic oil and i change it every 7000 miles <br>  <br>  i just don't like the fact of going 10000 miles between oil changes but if you du it every 7000 with synthetic oil you will be find too <br>  but don't go cheap on the oil filter <br>  <br>  its really just a personal choose with what brand what type and how long before you change your oil really|`|56l26dvCaa	Dang, believe it or not , with synthetic oil you can go over 20,000 mi between complete changes. It was developed as heat resistant  to 'breakdown" and with fuel injection instead of carburated engines ya don't have gas flooding down the cylinder walls diluting the oil also. Mobil One invented it and sent Car manufactures a memo with recommended oil change intervals . You can go say, 5,000-7,500 mi with just changing the filter and topping off the oil . Synthetic oil's viscosity remains the same at -45 deg as it does at 100 deg. You are just wasting money changing out the entire oil at 3,00-7,500 mi intervals|`|324b3f4848cd87a162532046683c0c35aa	As long as there are NO oil leaks Synths are the way to go! They don't break down as fast, and you can go longer between oil changes! <br>  <br>  It is my opinion that the recommended synths are lighter weight than the designers intended! If your Man. recommends a 5W30, I feel that it is too light! They always talk about winter starting! Well I ran my 30W30 and 50W50 through the Winter months without starting problems. Then there is the cold flow. With the heavier oils, the flow is slower during the winter, but think of this, idle warm up time is what used to keep the engines from self destruct mode! So my rule of thumb is if you climate is above freezing (32* F) more than 50% of the time add 5W, So here in NE Ohio I prefer to run a straight weight over the recommended! Since my Climate is 75 % above freezing 5+(3X5)= 5+(15)= 20. So I need to run a 20W30 oil, or a straight 30W!<br>  <br>  AS far as Royal Purple, or any other high priced racing oil synth or not, unless your racing on a track, the advantage over the cost is not that great! There are polymers in racing oil and anti foam agents, viscosity stabilizers, and a bunch of additives to protect the engine from racing applications! Do they help in a daily driver? Not really over a regular synth. You don't run your engine to the max RPM from every stop light! If you did your MPH would decrease! Even then your engine would NEVER be ran like a racing engine! In my opinion Racing Oils just aren't worth the added cost!|`|miNNL3aoaa	Traditional oil costs half as much, so use it and change twice as often. Why? New oil filters each time. Synthetics won't keep a filter from getting clogged, and they get dirty just as fast as traditional oils.<br>  <br>  With a high mileage car, frequent changes are the best option, even if it means an extra hour a year sitting in the waiting room at the oil change place :)

UvIuhFBXaa	short answer is DONT DO IT. Here is why. Yes you can turbo just about anything and everything out there but its not very cost efficient. You can go out and buy a camaro with an lt1 or ls1 motor. The 3.8 camaro was not performance minded. It has a smalled transmission and a very weak rear end. Put enough horsepower in the motor and your transmission and rear end will strip the gears in the first week. Unless you want to have your tranny skipping and picking up your differental then dont do it. If you have some higher sentimental value in the car, start from the rear end. Do it in this order. Upgrade the suspension, swap out the rear end for higher posi gears, go with a bigger transmission willing to hold the power and only then go with a bigger motor or turbo your current one. Your motor can held bigger rear end/trans but not the other way around. I really hope you reconsider or at least do some major research|`|56l26dvCaa	Dog Man, ever heard of the Buick Grand National?

hPqzysVYaa	First of all, check to see if you can feel the scratch using your fingernail. If you can't actually feel it, then this could be buffed out using a heavy compound at first, as this will essentially sand out the first few mils of the clear coat and penetrate far enough to sand out the scratch.  Then you will have to gradually work your way from the heavy cut compound up to a medium, then light and finally a  final glaze in order to acheive the original gloss of the clearcoat.  It sounds like a lot of work, but if done right, you can make it look like it never happened. <br>  <br>  If you can feel the scratch, it is probably (not always) past the clear coat and either down to the paint, or the primer.  Depending on how nice you want it to look or can afford, you could use touch-up paint provided by a body shop or a body shop supplier in your area.  However, no matter how close they match the color, a simple touch-up job will in fact look like a touch-up job and will be visible.  But this will protect the scratch from rusting and UV damage.

fPLv0QrSaa	It sounds like your brake pedal is a lot stiffer than before the brake job. When you had your brakes done, they would have bled the air out of the braking system. Air can cause the pedal to feel spongy. Now the pedal probably feels very solid. You may need to adjust the amount of force you use to push the brake pedal. Metallic brake pads have a tendency to squeal. Brakes aren't oiled, they are greased and lack of grease can cause squealing too. Grease is applied to the back of the brake pads and sometimes to the caliper pins/sliders. If you feel something is definitely wrong, take your car back to where you had the worn done and tell them your concerns.|`|pSpnjRsDaa	First, you don't put oil on brakes.  As for the squealing and jerking motion, that indicates a severe problem. Bring it back to where you had the work done and make them fix it.|`|c30d739ad4c894663f00807c27c1ac6caa	You can check the air pressure in your tires.<br>  Same thing happened to me few days ago.

2cb3153c313f04e3810e6bc6151a9494aa	While the Michelin Sport Cups are good tires, the obvious question in return is why you are looking at an R-Compound tire?  If you are looking at this for street use, the Pilot Sport Cups will last in terms of wear, but they will heat cycle out as quickly as most R-Comps and spend most of their life in an underperforming and unpredictable state (and potentially dangerous if you were to ever drive at the limit as they will be prone to letting go once they heat up).  The Bridgestone RE01R, The Michelin PS2, or similar maximum performance street tires would make a much better match to the car.<br>  <br>  And if you are looking for a track tire,  while the Sport Cups are a decent and long lasting choice, I don't think their performance can compare to the Hoosiers or some of it's competitors (Avon, Kumho V710, etc) except when looked at in heavy cars (like the basic GT3) running over long sessions.  And for overall wear, they do last well, but face the same issue as when used as a street tire, the older Toyo Proxes would be a better bet here with their compound being much more resistent to many heat cycles (the newer R888 isn't bad in this area, but it gains it's higher overall limit at the cost of the longevity of the older RA1).<br>  <br>  As for sizing... for performance purposes you want to run as much rubber as you can, keeping in mind that changes to the overall diameter can have negitive impact on overall gearing, and that tire weight (being that it's unspring rotating mass) can also have a negitive effect (though probably not much of an issue in a car with as much power as the GT3).  So the widest rubber you can fit on your rims while keeping roughing the same overall diameter is best... with a couple things to keep in mind.  You don't want your back tires to be TOO much wider than your fronts, or you will start to unbalance the car's handling with too much rear grip, and you have to keep an eye on how wide the front tires are or you will begin to impact the range of slip angle at which the front tires will work, creating an unmanagable amount of understeer (and limited by what you can physically fit in your fenders).  You can probably go wider, though if you get much beyond the 255-265 range in front, you will most likely need to look at some fairly major suspension changes in order to maintain drivability.<br>  <br>  What tire compound and size will be best will depend alot on how you drive and your ability as a driver to get the potential from the tire as well as evaluate where your current setup is lacking.  If you are not pushing the car to it's limits or are not at a point as a driver to do that, you are probably best served looking at staying with the factory sizes.

JwUHCwcJaa	The only price drop will be happening when the older versions are outgoing and dealerships will be giving incentives just to get rid of them to make way for the incoming newer versions. At this point, the price drop that you've seen is good. The incoming Evo's are basically unchanged from the older ones except for some minor accessories.

Good luck|`|crhJLuw5aa	You'll need a transmission, drive shaft, and probably a rear-end to go with it. They probably make an adapter kit for your car, so the amount of cutting and welding should be rather minimal. You might also need a custom heavy duty radiator. You'll also need a custom exhaust system built. As you can see, this is a MAJOR undertaking. This job is probably going to cost you upwards of $8,000 to $10,000 dollars or more. If you still decide to go ahead with this, make SURE you pick a shop that's done this sort of thing before. Otherwise, you'll end up with nothing but trouble for as long as you own the car.|`|hOnmrQKNaa	sell enggine and buy a nissan

Here's the real deal, allot of people make the mistake of thinking the amp has some magical switch or configuration that makes the amp become a 2 ohm amp instead of a 4 ohm... that simply is not the case. the different wattage ratings on a amp specifications are there to show what it does given a certain situation, or configuration. it does not create the configuration, it interacts with it. the ohms in a system are controlled by speaker configuration, nothing else. something to keep in mind, that many amp specs conveniently  seam to not mention is that along with Higher power is also a higher distortion rating. now this is certainly not always the case, some really high end amps have very good ratings for both 4 and 2 ohm loads. but generally speaking doubling power will double distortion ratings as well. <br>  <br>  Also for some related facts, don't get hung up on wattage ratings that is just one small part of a systems overall volume level. in fact doubling power will only gain you 3db. that is fact of physics, Google SPL for yourself. so understand a well made sub enclosure with a good sub can make more difference than doubling power (98db system over say 91db = 7db gain), and the electrical system will thank you as well.
xMvt8KhEaa	if the light is on steady and not blinking it most likely isnt that serious but should still get checked at your earliest availability as it could later cause more serious problems depending on what it is . DO NOT disconnect the battery like one person answer , though it may work for some vehicles it does not for all and may cause other problems . some auto part stores do offer to plug in and diagnose your problem and seel you the part but if you can not install it yourself your out of luck because most shops are not likely to install parts you bring with you . the best bet is to just go to a mechanic and have it check and most shops will not charge a diagnostic fee if you have the work done there .|`|Ihfj1lRmaa	If it still drives fine, and you seem to be getting decent gas mileage you can let it go.

JJsJaQjxaa	Is your coolant level topped up before each ride? Any leaks in the hoses or engine that may cause the bike to over heat? What is your style of riding? Do you use the clutch hard while climbing up steep hills or creep through the woods at a slow pace? Any of these could cause your bike to steam coolant out once it hits a high enough temp. You might have to alter your riding style slightly. Doesn't that bike already come equipped with a coolant overflow tank to begin with? If you're seeing the coolant go into the overflow tank, that's normal. It'll return to the radiators once the temps go down again. If none of this is helping you, it might be time to actually drain the coolant and have a look at the waterpump and impeller.

P8osE8nRaa	It is both in a sense that you can let the car shift for you, or you can choose to shift in full manual mode with your shifter or the steering wheel pedals.<br>  <br>  This is what Mitsubishi had to say about the ST-SSC<br>  <br>  The structure of TC-SST is less complex than that of a conventional automatic transmission because it uses clutches instead of a torque converter to transmit power. The key to the system's operation is in the advanced and precise electronic and hydraulic controls. TC-SST can select two gears at the same time by putting odd (1st, 3rd, 5th) and even (2nd, 4th and 6th) gears on separate input shafts, each connected to an individual clutch. While one gear is engaged by one of the two electro-hydraulically operated wet multi-plate clutches, the other is pre-selected, awaiting to be engaged by the second wet multi-plate clutch. The TC-SST, in principle, behaves like two three-speed manual transmissions operating on the same output shaft. With both clutches under precise system control, the gear change is made when the clutches are "swapped" simultaneously, allowing extremely fast, smooth and lag-free gear changes with no interruption in power delivery.<br>  <br>  The odd and even gear shafts are linked via a transfer gear, resulting in a shorter overall transmission length. The transmission ECU, sensors and solenoids are all housed within the transmission valve body. The TC-SST is equipped with a transmission oil cooler and uses automatic transmission fluid<br>  <br>  With all the details aside, having actually own an Evo X MR, I can tell you that on day to day driving, the car shifts much more efficiently than I could ever hope for, and the traditional semi-manual shifter does not even come close to this system.  On Sport or Super Sport Mode, the car shifts at a much higher RPM range and still smoother than how most people with high performance car driving experiences would shift.  I have owned other 5 speed cars and people would argue that ST-SSC or DSG (Double Shift Gearbox ) is restrictive and not responsive enough.  They have obviously never driven any ST-SSC or DSG type of cars before, especially an Evo X MR or the Skyline GTR35.  I have had many 5 speed cars that were at 4000RPM on highway speeds, which can get annoying if you have a long commute.  Evo X MR runs at 2000RPM on Normal mode on highway speeds.  Evo X MR is simply amazing.|`|bSTK2Wd2aa	You can do both! The system works where you can have it in D for normal day to day driving but if you want complete control of your gears then there's a manual shift mode where you can use the paddel shifters or gear select lever

Driving habits and road conditions have a lot to do with any engine/transmission leak. The older the car without any gaskets changed, the more likely to leak.  Clogged PCV valves/vent tubes will accelerate this problem.

It's a phrase started on the RX8Club.com forums.<br>  <br>   It was noticed that far more silvers were involved in auto accidents than any other color.  There's 2 reasons for this. First, silver is a very popular color, so there are more of them. Second, silver is harder to see at dawn and dusk as it blends in more so there is a higher chance of it not being seen as early.  <br>  <br>  If you own a silver learn defensive driving techniques and use your lights to be seen... or get a Canadian daytime running light module installed.|`|gOQ5mZ7Xaa	Never heard of it.

Case in point-if the Check engine light is on-THERE HAS TO BE A CODE. PERIOD.<br>  And the most common faults when replacing head gaskets are failure to re-install aground wires, incorrect valve lash(if adjustable) and the one that sounds like your problem-vacuum leaks. Ask the shop you are taking it to to tell you the long and short term fuel trim numbers at idle and at 2500 rpm. If the trim number at idle indicates the addition of fuel(a positive number in excess of 10) and a number closer to zero(may even be a minus number, like -2 or minus 3)at 2500 rpm, then start checking for a vacuum leak. If they don't have a smoke machine for leak detection-find another shop.Also, check the BARO reading. This reading does not have a sensor to get the parameter from, but infers baro from several things, including wide open throttle acceleration, coastdowns,to name a few. If it is significantly lower than the actual baro reading for your area, suspect a contaminated MAF sensor-they can be removed and cleaned. Close inspection of the sensor wire may even show a black residue on one side.<br>  To put it in a nutshell, it sounds like you really need to find another shop. go to iATN.com, then go to Find A Shop<br>  Good luck

It's unlikely to be head gasket as others have said as this normally shows up with poor running, losing water, radiator pressurising and oil changing colour.|`|6Zflv6cpaa	this is normal .oil,when it becomes hot will smoke and if there is an opening into the crankcase, that's where the smoke will escape the pcv valve takes care of this by routing the smoke back into the intake ,thus mixing it with the gas to be burned|`|UuGOHHG5aa	that  is probably  water VAPOR .

Actually I think your best bet would be to buy a GM crate 383. You will still have to make improvements to the cooling system and some minor ones to the trans.

Big blocks take up a lot of room in the Vette's engine compartment.
akkZoPdnaa	It represents the amount of lift on a camshaft profile. It basically means how much higher the camshaft lobe is pushing the rocker arms up. this usually allows for more air to enter the engine's combustion chamber, and how much time the exhaust gases will have to escape the chamber. Since you're posting this under Mitsubishi, I'm guessing you're driving a Lancer Evolution, Eclipse, 3000GT, or a DSM. <br>  <br>  I might be going out on a tangent, but if you're looking to upgrade to a better set of cams, do some research on how it will affect your motor, and remember that camshafts work best with supporting mods such as intake, fuel pump, MAYBE injectors. and also keep in mind that the higher the profile lift, the weaker your low end power will become. 272s are intermediate level cams, so you'll need a professional tune to go with them.|`|umhjqZwLaa	it is pretty technical but basically the 272 represents the amount of lift in your camshaft [.272]|`|PAceoX2oaa	As mentioned, a 272 cam is a pretty aggressive cam for the street. A popular combination for DSM's used to be the 264/272 combination, which gave near-stock idle, but increased breathing at the top end of the tach. Most people with 272's will notice lopey idle, sometimes to the point of stalling. If you have an EMS that allows you to adjust idle, bump it up to 1000rpms to keep things happy. I had to with FP2x cams (very similar to a 272, but faster ramp-up). Depending on what cam maker you go with, you MAY be advised to use dual valve springs.

1abfb731e43be3f575bbec1c8d9df367aa	1 way means, only mid-base, mid range, or tweeter.. two way speaker means a mid range and a tweeter or a mid-base and a tweeter and so on.. three way speaker means a tweeter, a mid-base, and a mid range,.. a good sound system in car audio include all those speakers, most important is if you want a good sound quality, the design is important, good placement of speakers, and proper matching of speakers to the power amplifier, you can add any watts you want as long as you can power all those speakers,. when designing car audio systems, mid ranges and tweeters in front, mid-bases at the rear, and subs at the rear also. installing those speaker will be more difficult, you have to work for it a lot to maximize its sound quality, just fix it properly, add flash bands or dynamat if necessary. Matching those speakers to your power amp is as easy as how you think of it, just look at the specs and see the rms power of those speakers, if you have a two way rated 50watts rms, and a midbase also rated 50watts rms, your amp should be a four channel rated at 50watts rms per channel.. if you had questions and need a troubleshooter in you system, just visit my site at multiply, nihhonautosounds.multiyply.com, or just email me..|`|fTDrzAiMaa	1 way is one speaker, 2 way is a woofer and a tweeter, 3 way is woofer, tweeter, and mid range. the 2 and 3 way are practically the same but they are both like night and day compared to the 1 way.

sw6L0vnyaa	By higher wall tires I imagine you mean the aspect ratio of the tire which is the middle number. ex: 205-65-15   with the 65 being the ratio. If you want a higher wall you may be able to go to a 70 or 75 ratio. It all depends on how much clearance you have for the tire. What kind of van? Year? Make? Model? Whats the full tire size you have?

This will give you the added dynamic headroom for punchier bass and increased ability to play sustained notes. Also realize subs don't blow when overpowered nearly as often as when underpowered. Clipping is what causes voice coil failure.<br>  And make sure you properly match ohm output. If you have a DVC 2ohm sub you can either run 1ohm or 4ohm into 1 channel.

mWZ9BXIdaa	Before you start condemning the whole thing you need to find out exactly what has gone wrong and what other parts it has damaged.

You would want a denser material mainly for sound reasons not just for construction.  <br>  <br>  If you are worried about it falling apart just add some bracing to the inside.  It will strengthen the enclosure as well as prevent any flexing of the material.  This will help the overall performance of the enclosure.<br>  <br>  If you can, I would coat the inside of the enclosure with some fiberglass.  That will also strengthen the enclosure, seal it, and just make it sound better overall.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|bADgVLswaa	As long as your assembly procedures are sound, you shouldn't have a problem. Just realize your margin of error has been reduced so be very careful to cut carefully for speaker holes to maximize the amount of material around the mounting screws. Also, in my experience, the best assembly comes from liquid nails or some other construction adhesive and as few screws as possible (just enough to hold the box together until the glue dries (24-48 hours for full strength). So be careful and go for it. You should be thumping in no time. One last thought, carpet the box. It will look nicer and no one will be able to tell what you made the box of that way. Also make sure each sub has its own air space.|`|qO5xm5BSaa	yes, it can be done, ive seen it but, the disadvantage is the box will probably flex, causing a loss in sound, if i had to use ldf, id definitely reinforce the sides and drill the ldf to 2 x 4s on the inside.

XMOwmWM0aa	Im pretty sure it would depend on how aggressive the new cams are|`|QpP1xJ4Naa	It should work, but maybe not ideal.<br>  If you use an aftermarket cam, it may need a little fine tuning. Some cam makers recommend a different cam timing point then stock. Even stock cams shift a little and for a spec racer more accurate cam timing set up is needed.<br>  In short, done right with after market cam gears, you might gain a few more horses over the stock cam gear set up.

If it photographed only the fire engine, and not your car, then you will not be charged.  The fire engine driver will also not be charged if this was an actual fire call (or false alarm) and not a personal errand in a fire engine.<br>  <br>  If the photograph shows your vehicle and you were speeding, then you can be charged, even if another vehicle was overtaken you.<br>  <br>  Additionally, since the fire engine was in the outside lane, you must have been in the inside lane.

Things like fire engines coming up behind you are exactly the distraction that inexperienced drivers have problems dealing with and I guarantee your attention was fully on the engine and not on the road ahead, and if kids were near by or anything. Speed limits aren't just for passing tests. As for your speed, yes you were speeding, so yes you could get a ticket (which could seriously affect the insurance of a new driver) and yes the fire engine would also be investigated, and as someone else has said needs to have been on a real emergency call to avoid a fine.|`|URZNtrxsaa	In some jurisdictions here in the US, the law reads that you must not only yield to an emergency vehicle, but pull over and come to a complete STOP. <br>  <br>  The answer to the first part of your question depends on the state, but in Arizona, the answer is Yes. All emergency vehicles are flashed when they either trigger a red light camera or a speed enforcement camera. Departments will check their internal logs to determine what the vehicle/driver was doing at the time flashed (going to a police or fire call) when the violation is forwarded to the respective department. <br>  <br>  Departments here in my state have written procedures for officers and fire fighters dealing with this issue and may require them to right an internal report describing the activities when flashed.<br>  <br>  As for the possible citation you may receive, it depends on where the violation threshold is set on the camera radar (what Km or mph over the speed limit triggers the citation).<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|24kFbAdsaa	You are given 10 mph in the US, probably about the same in the UK.  So a 30 mph would not trigger until 40 mph.  By the way, emergency vehicles are not supposed too much over the posted speed limit (maybe 10 mph).  Why?  The roads are designed for a certain maximum speed plus a little more.  Taking a curve at too high a speed could cause problems.  Traveling too fast makes it too hard for other drivers and emergency vehicle drivers to react to each other if one of them makes a sudden lane change or other unanticipated movement.<br>  <br>  Speed cameras are not selective.

I have their car insurance and, as I know, they can provide such a service.|`|mKVFIklaaa	Lots of conflicting answers - some right, some not.<br>  Basically, it's down to your insurer: Many will only insure the registered keeper of a vehicle, so you'll have to ring around & check.<br>  Your son could still insure the car against fire or theft, despite having a ban, but I assume you now know that as the car's on finance, you must hold fully comprehensive cover on it.<br>  The simplest thing is to transfer the car into your name & insure it. The owner will stay the same, it will just be a change of keeper, so the finance company won't mind.<br>  <br>  This is a good lesson in why not to buy a car on finance - personally, I'd either ask the finance company to take it back, or sell it & pay the balance off. There's nowt more sickening than paying for something you don't have the use of: Just ask anyone who's paying for their shite DFS furniture three years after it's fallen apart!|`|1lsvWj6zaa	why don't he just insure it i know this sounds silly and i know he is banned but yes can still insure a car if you are banned it just says on the certificate that the banned driver is not allowed to drive the car he could put your name on it as a named driver i know this because i was once a naughty boy lol and also was banned and needed to insure the car as it was parked on the road not sure if he can still build up a no-claims bonus doing it this way hope this helps|`|p6o0LoY6aa	No its not.

Bfh6VRPxaa	Short: 1411kbps<br>  Longer:<br>  CD audio has sample rate of 44.1 kHz with 16 bit resolution times 2 channels. <br>  This means each of the two stereo channels is sampled 44100 times per second (according to Nyquist theorem, the maximum audio frequency that can be reproduced is 22kHz). The resolution of each sample is 16bits, which means the amplitude (or level) of each sample can have 65536 (2^16) different values - this yields dynamic range of 96dB (20*log65536).<br>  Bit rate comes to:<br>  2 channels x 44100 samples per second per channel × 16 bits per sample = 1,411,200 bit/s = 1411.2 kbps<br>  <br>  Of course CD audio (unlike mp3) is uncompressed, so comparable quality compressed audio is subjective.

The fact those that do these things should be prosecuted accordingly and made a spectacle for those that feel the need to disturb the well being of passengers and pilots.

hqbt98QIaa	Sure, dealers from anywhere will sell you a car and ship it to you. The problem with this idea is that you will have to pay import tax to bring the vehicle into the country (which can be a lot! Sometimes doubling the price.) and also may need to make certain modifications to meet your local specifications. After the shipping, import tax and upgrades, the cost will probably be only a bit less than if you bought a vehicle there, otherwise everyone would do it.<br>  <br>  The reason cars cost what they do where you live is because all of those things have already been factored in and you can't really get around them.|`|muvFK6oXaa	You may want to check:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dealsonwheels.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dealsonwheels.com</a><br>  <br>  Hundreds of Auto transport and shipping companies advertise there.
