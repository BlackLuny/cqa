If a Dr puts you out of work on disability because of stress in NY State, can your employer deny your disability pay? I realize in NY State does not start until day 8 of your absence from work.

Is it against the law to shoot a dog if u think it is in so much pain that it would be more humane to kill it on the spot?   What if its not? What if you did not take it to the vet to get it checked out and all it had was arthrits?   Could you be charged with murder, or animal cruelty?      It wasn't me but I know a person that did that. I am not sure if they brought him to the vet at all, because their lie made no sence, but they shot him. And I think they should not have shot him at all. But the lie they told me was that they brought it to the vet and all he could tell them was bad news. So what they brought it home and shot it????      Besides there is like 10 different veterinary clinic in about walking distance. Also it was within city limits.

20070523110948AAW6iDK	Politics & Government;Politics	Es democratico  un presidente que cierra un canal de tv porque piensa distinto? carta a Chaves de  RCTV?	"Ciudadano Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías   Presidente de la República Bolivariana de Venezuela".       "Las muestras de fortaleza, dignidad y entereza que   han dado los trabajadores de RCTV y sus familias en   estos difíciles momentos, solo me llenan de admiración   y estima.       Es por ellos y por Venezuela, Ciudadano Presidente,   que seguimos firmes en nuestra decisión de hacer que   se respete nuestro derecho a seguir operando.      En RCTV hay casi 3000 personas que tienen el derecho a   seguir trabajando en la misma empresa donde han   escogido trabajar durante tantos a?os.      Hay más de 5000 trabajadores indirectos que tienen   derecho a continuar en sus trabajos y en sus negocios.      Nadie, ni siquiera usted, puede decidir arbitraria e   ilegalmente que el producto de su trabajo ahora deba   ser sustituido por el producto del trabajo de otros,   por mas respetable que sea.       En un país donde cada vez se crea más desempleo, mi   compromiso y el de los otros accionistas de RCTV, es   luchar para que esta empresa de trabajadores   venezolanos siga operando bajo las mismas condiciones   que hasta ahora lo ha hecho, pues es la única que   asegura la estabilidad de la empresa y, por   consiguiente, la de los trabajadores.       En esta defensa, lo único que no se negocia es la   libertad de expresión. No podemos hacerlo aunque   quisiéramos, porque pertenece a los venezolanos y no   podemos ponerla en una mesa de discusión.   Afectar ese derecho es inaceptable, como lo es afectar   los derechos de los trabajadores.    Por eso yo le pido Ciudadano Presidente que   recapacite, porque los verdaderos gobernantes ni dejan   sin empleo al pueblo al que deben proteger, ni   silencian a sus críticos.    Si observamos a nuestro alrededor, a los gobernantes   de América Latina, incluso a quienes como usted,   siguen una línea política de izquierda -me refiero a   los presidentes Lula, Bachelet, Torrijos, Vasquez o   Kirchner- todos gobiernan tolerando a sus opositores.   A ninguno de ellos se le ha ocurrido cerrar un medio   de comunicación porque le de cabida a quienes piensan   distinto.   Esa es la verdadera fortaleza de un líder democrático.   La de convencer a los ciudadanos con su visión, pero a   la vez la de escuchar opiniones diferentes.    La de resistir la fiscalización de los gobernados y de   los medios. La de respetar la libertad de pensamiento,   información y expresión.    Ello forma parte esencial de la Democracia. Lo que   Usted pretende en la Venezuela de hoy, en contra del   mandato que recibió en las urnas, es algo para lo que   no se requiere valor.    Pretende una Venezuela en la que nadie opine o exprese   una idea distinta al discurso oficial. Tiene usted ya   el control total de la Asamblea Nacional. No contento   con ello, logró que ese organismo le otorgara poderes   ilimitados para legislar y reformar la Constitución.    El Poder Judicial está sometido constantemente a la   intimidación y la presión de su Gobierno. Algunos   medios, como usted mismo lo ha dicho y lo sabe ya todo   el mundo, han modificado su línea editorial para   garantizar su supervivencia, "por ahora".    Hoy se busca el cierre del Canal más antiguo de la   televisión venezolana. El Canal que le llega al   corazón de todos; un Canal que resume buena parte de   la historia de nuestro país y que hace posible que el   pueblo le diga lo que sus asesores jamás le dirán.   Yo no sé y me lo he preguntado mucho en estos tiempos,   quién le ofreció semejante recomendación política tan   desacertada.    Esta pretensión de cerrar el Canal de todos los   venezolanos para iniciar otro canal oficial más, que   repita sin descanso el mensaje del gobierno, lo ha   enfrentado a mas del 80% de los venezolanos, a buena   parte de los seguidores chavistas, a gremios   periodísticos de todo el mundo, a organizaciones de   defensa de los derechos humanos reconocidas   mundialmente, a organismos multilaterales de diverso   tipo, a Congresos de varios países, incluyendo el   Senado y la Cámara de Diputados de Chile, a   presidentes, a profesores y académicos y, por   supuesto, a las más de ocho mil familias que dependen   de RCTV.    ?Quien se beneficia con esta decisión, Ciudadano   Presidente?   Yo le pido Presidente, que escuche a la gente y que   asuma la responsabilidad de gobernar conviviendo con   quienes no piensan como usted. Permita que en la   Venezuela de hoy existan otras opiniones.    Nuestro país es una mezcla de razas, identidades,   voces, culturas y nadie puede encerrarlas todas dentro   de un modelo único.   Un buen estadista sabe que la verdadera fuerza no   reside en aplastar al adversario, ni en ocultar las   verdades o silenciar a los críticos.    La verdadera fuerza descansa en la conciliación, en el   pluralismo y la tolerancia. Todos sus asesores   comunicacionales a pesar de una campa?a desmedida,   abusiva y violatoria de los derechos humanos, no han   podido convencer al pueblo de que esta es una decisión   legal.    Todo el mundo sabe, puesto que usted lo ha dicho   reiteradamente, que es su decisión personal y que se   debe a la línea editorial de este canal, por lo tanto   es arbitraria e ilegal.   En este tema tiene usted en sus manos una decisión   histórica.    ?Es un dirigente de la nueva izquierda latinoamericana   o es un populista totalitario más? ?Es fuerte porque   sus convicciones también lo son o es débil y necesita   anular a todo el que le lleve la contraria?    ?Gobierna usted Presidente o gobiernan los asesores   que ven en la supresión de los contrarios   oportunidades de negocios?   Son preguntas que hoy no me hago solamente yo; o los   trabajadores del Canal; o los millones de televidentes   que quieren a Radio Caracas Televisión. Son preguntas   que se hacen muchos en el mundo entero, pero sobre   todo los venezolanos. Y son preguntas que merecen una   respuesta de su gobernante, si este tiene el coraje de   responderlas".    Respetuosamente,Marcel Granier    Director General RCTV

Se hubiera ganado Chavez como lo hizo la oposicion, habriamos visto un enfrentamiento en las calles seguramente. Se reivindico la democracia venezolana, chavez como el bien dijo, tendra que hacer un analisis de la voz del pueblo. Yo, desde mi lean forma de ver las cosas, Chavez se equiboco con esta reforma, no completamente, por que tiene buenas leyes, pero hay aspectos muy negativos. Personalmente defiendo el socialismo, auque este encontra de ciertos cambios o consecuencias.

20070420123149AA3qxcz	Politics & Government;Immigration	ESPA?OLES: acaso en Espa?a no hay problemas?	1o. Espa?a carece de una auténtica política de estado en cuatro áreas vitales. Se trata de la Unión Europea, la política exterior, la defensa y, la inmigración. Hay concepciones de partido, líneas del PSOE y del PP muy enfrentadas, pero no una concepción de estado, que exige para serlo la estabilidad por encima de la coyuntura electoral y la política de partido.   2o.La falta de un pacto de estado y de un acuerdo social sobre la ense?anza. Nuestra crisis ahí es grave y vital. De poco servirá a medio plazo una mayor inversión en I+D+i, si la base de la pirámide, la primaria y sobre todo la ense?anza secundaria, no supera su dramática insuficiencia. Con un fracaso escolar que supera el 30 por ciento, sin parangón en la Unión Europea, y que bordea el 50 por ciento si les a?adimos los aprobados ?pedagógicos?, las notas con asterisco, urge una respuesta real y sólida. El gasto público no es la clave del problema, pero resulta rotundamente insuficiente con parámetros europeos. En educación no universitaria era del 3 por ciento (2002) en Espa?a y, del 3,6 por ciento en la UE-15 pero cuatro a?os antes solo nos diferenciaba una décima de PIB de la media europea. La respuesta a todo esto no es una ley de partido como la LOE, portadora de conflictos y no de soluciones, como lo acredita la manifestación convocada el 12 de noviembre por buena parte de la comunidad educativa.   3o. El deterioro de la sanidad. Mientras las administraciones se dedican a las células embrionarias y al condón, la sanidad cruje por sus costuras. Debe hacer frente a un millón y medio de habitantes adicionales que el INE ha hecho aflorar, a unas listas de espera interminables, a una población cada vez más envejecida, con un gasto público muy inferior al europeo. Sólo un 5,9 por ciento del PIB contra el 7,5 por ciento de la UE-15.   4o. La crisis de la natalidad y su otra cara el hiperenvejecimiento. Me sorprende que tanta preocupación por Espa?a, no aborde el hecho que para el 2050 éste será un país inviable con un tercio de la población de ancianos y solo una persona en edad de trabajar por cada inactivo (inmigración incluida).   5o. La insuficiente competitividad, un concepto amplio que engloba cuestiones decisivas, como la productividad del empleo, un diferencial de inflación que sin el recurso a la devaluación se traduce a medio plazo en más paro; un déficit exterior que el a?o próximo superará en términos de PIB al de Estados Unidos, considerado como una brutal anomalía, pero que tiene a su favor una economía brillante y los bono-refugio y, especialmente -gran paradoja- unas administraciones públicas penosas, excesivamente ineficaces, que son según el World Economic Fórum, uno de los problemas básicos para mejorar nuestra capacidad de competir.   6o. Una excesiva dependencia energética del petróleo y, un consumo por unidad producida comparativamente elevado en una época donde solo puede subir y subir de precio. Tampoco ahí hay política grande, solo achique de agua.   7o. Un crecimiento económico que envía se?ales falsas. Todo va bien, pero en realidad nuestra situación es tan frágil que la bonanza se cuenta por meses, 12,15,..., con el dato adicional que nuestra brillante trayectoria obedece, en parte, a que entre medio y un punto de crecimiento del PIB espa?ol se debe a los fondos estructurales, un flujo económico que se acaba. ?Qué planteamiento económico hay para el fin de esta época, para 2007 y los a?os posteriores, cuando además resulta impensable que el consumo interior y la construcción sigan tirando del crecimiento? Demasiado silencio del Gobierno, pero también escasa presión de la oposición y la propia sociedad civil.

I have been upset about all the government intervention and bailouts etc, from top to bottom that is and then the UAW came into the pic with a lavish retreat and that got my goat too (not that I think it is anyone’s business to tell anyone how to spend their money, that is not the problem or the issue) but with the economy as it is and the Bailouts and putting things in perspective.       I just wonder why they don’t cancel it all (though it is good for the economy)       as the Left has gotten on all the other CEO’s etc… with other lavish stuff (which is all valid as this is) the convention  Down at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami, and       I mean hey again that is fine with me personally I am just wondering about the hypocrisy of it?       when the United Auto Workers, who are every bit as affected by this downturn as anybody else, are having a giant convention at a brand-new five-star super-duper resort down in Miami, the Fontainebleau, and the left defending this and yet nothing else so I mean do you think       We have the right to interfere it's our money? Our Bailout/Stimulus/Recovery Package 1.2 Trillion Dollars in total that we don’t even have and hey corporate jets, corporate sponsorships and Lavish conventions all on our dime (sure you can say due money etc… but that is what the CEO’s said too and still the left was barking at the moon) Which money is which ya know?           If we can tell Citibank how they are and aren't allowed to advertise, and other businesses that their CEO's have a pay cap; I think we can certainly ban the UAW brass that they aren't allowed to take vacations on our dime, right?       Now I don't think we should be involved on any of these levels, but since we are we may as well be honest about our policies and skip the hypocrisy right?          oh ps thanks reason enforcer

UK Prime Minister Gordan Brown presented a rare gift to Obama made from wood of a very old ship.  A true treasure.  Obama's team gave what can probably be considered the most lame gift ever given to another nation, let alone one of our best allies, in the history of our country.  He gave him a DVD set of movies.  Naturally the British are perplexed.      When questioned, Obama's team now admits it was a dumb gift. They claim they were just too tired.  Heck, you cannot even play US DVDs in the UK, they use a different standard.  Clearly this is exactly an indication of what many people said, that Obama would have to learn on the job, since he has no executive experience and no foreign relations experience.

From what I understand, there is a legal commitment to pay Sir Fred Goodwin of RBS a (final salary) pension of ￡693,000-a-year for life. While the pension terms-and-conditions no doubt specify that he receives his benefits in Pounds Sterling, I wouldn't be at all surprised if the T&C don't specify what kind of "Pounds Sterling". As well as "Bank of England" pounds sterling, there is also "Monopoly" pounds sterling!   If I am right and "Bank of England" pounds sterling is not specified in the pension T&C, is there a law, statute or case, that would make the "Monopoly" interpretation unlawful, or is it ambiguous in law and down to the goodwill of the pension providers to interpret the Pounds Sterling as "Bank of England" Pounds Sterling?

"I have serious concerns with this budget, which demands hardworking American families and job creators turn over more of their hard-earned money to the government to pay for unprecedented spending increases," said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the Senate Republican leader.   Even Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad of North Dakota, had misgivings. Conrad said he worried about the budget's long-term outlook, which sees deficits fall until 2013 and then begin to rise again. "I think that requires additional work," he said Friday on CNBC. And he predicted trouble for Obama's plan to limit itemized deductions for individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000. "I would put that high on the list of things that will be given a thorough scrubbing and may well not survive," he said.

Granted, it's small - but it IS the opportunity to prove a point.  I'm going to put mine in a money market account for now, and then invest when the market finally settles down.

In his speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday, February 28, 2009, Mr. Limbaugh made the following statement:       "Do you know that President Obama, in six weeks of his administration, has proposed more spending than from the founding of the country to his inauguration?"      This is patently, obviously, and even laughably false, yet little or nothing has been said about it.  Worse, I have seen it repeated by his followers as if it were true.      For those of you who deny its falsehood, please support your position with real numbers.  Bear in mind that George Bush's budgets alone totalled $19.103 trillion, and Reagan's totalled $7.086 trillion.      Sources:        http://www.gpoaccess.gov/USbudget/fy02/p...     http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0104753.h...       If Obama has proposed spending over $26 trillion (and this is just for two previous administrations), I must have missed it.      So how about it?  Are there any conservatives out there willing to admit that Rush was wildly incorrect?
20090309101549AAr3WuO	Politics & Government;Politics	Do democrats know the difference between success and failure?	So much of an issue has been made by Rush's Limbaugh's comment at CPAC and on his show.  In 2006 Democrats said that they did not want Bush to succeed.        So my question is, do you know what the difference in the definition:      Failure:   1. an act or instance of failing or proving unsuccessful; lack of success: His effort ended in failure. The campaign was a failure.        Success:   1. the favorable or prosperous termination of attempts or endeavors.    2. the attainment of wealth, position, honors, or the like.    3. a successful performance or achievement: The play was an instant success.         Here is the 2006 poll question:      10. Regardless of how you voted in the presidential election, would you say you want President Bush to succeed or not?   SCALE: 1. Yes, want him to succeed 2. No, do not want him to succeed 3. (Don’t know)      Yes No (Don’t know)   8-9 Aug 06 63% 32 5   Democrats 40% 51 9   Republicans 90% 7 2   Independents 63% 34 3      see the poll:    http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/FOX_...       So if 63% of democrats didn't want the president to be successful, did they basically say they wanted him to fail?   Look at the definitions.
20090309095605AAIbyzs	Politics & Government;Politics	Why are dems so critical of Rush, when in 2006 they said they wanted "Bush to Fail"?	An August 2006 poll conducted by FOX News/Opinion Dynamics showed 51 percent of Democrats did not want Bush to succeed. Thirty-four percent of independents also did not want Bush to succeed.      By comparison, 90 percent of Republicans said at the time that they wanted Bush to succeed, and 40 percent of Democrats said the same.      Democrats will brush this off as a fox news article.  But the facts are facts.  If it came from AP, would it be more credible?
20090309113148AAiUQsY	Politics & Government;Politics	In America, is 'Socialism' a term that the Right uses to show disapproval?	Shortly after 9/11, the prior admin took steps to prevent gasoline price gouging. Now, considering the mood of the country, and the high patriotism felt by most Americans, why didn't a conservative pundit have nerve enough to stand up and call that socialism? A few week ago, R. Limbaugh rallied his base of rabid fans by saying that Americans MUST get back to the solid principles of Capitalism. I call it a demand for increased exploitation of workers. But why is socialism OK just some of the time. And can you draw a line between govt intervention of the economy/free market and the new 'S' word? btw. I'm a Socialist Party USA member.

In the meantime, North Korean officials described the drills between the United States and South Korea as a disguised events the goal of which was to prepare for an aggression. North Korea is currently working on the launch of its Kwangmyungsung-2 satellite, although experts say that the nation is going to test a ballistic missile that could be capable of reaching the US territory.      A chief military official of the Korean People’s Army warned the United States, South Korea and Japan that any attempts to intercept the launch of the NKorean satellite would immediately result in a counterstrikeThe North Korean army has been set on full alert in connection with the above-mentioned military drills. In addition, North Korea said that they could no longer guarantee the safety of South Korean passenger flights over their territory. "We don't know what kind of military clashes may occur due to the joint war exercise (between South Korea and the U.S. military)," an official said.       http://english.pravda.ru/hotspots/confli...

Should we be lucky enough to get  a single payer system, it will be absolutely imperative that we control health care cost.   Consider the nightmare of everyone in the country having access to quality health care at the criminally high prices charged by hospitals and drug companies.  Government subsidy of a single payer system with the greedy bean counters bending us over the hood of their Mercedes Limo will result in the worst asset bubble and the worst financial f'ing in history, even worse than the housing bubble.  The % of GDP they extract from us will be overwhelming and they will wreck our economy. (providing the economy recovers from the last good banging we have taken from the bankers)   So how will we proceed in our free Society to control the greed of the insurance and hospital operators?   Vlad Lenin pulled  a 38 caliber pistol from his coat pocket and pointed it at the head of a train conductor refusing to let the trains run. Mr. Conductor changed his mind and yelled, "All Aboard!"   Will we have to resort to such tactics to control them or will we be able to regulate them in a more peaceful manner?   The insurance companies, drug companies, American Medical Assoc. and other  related  parasites will not give up easily.  What are your thoughts on how we can break the backs and the stranglehold they have on us?

I was about to walk down the stairs and he called me back to speak (no one was around) he started and argument and then basically pushed me down the stairs. He claimed to everyone i was drunk and fell but i only had a glass of wine. I went to hospital and had a fractured wrist and fingers. Cuts and bruises on my face and body, Ive now decided i want to report him to the police. Is it too late? What do i say?

20090309104519AAtL2Bw	Politics & Government;Politics	Who here supports temporarily nationalizing the banks and doubling the stimulus bill?	The reality is that in most countries where banks fail, the government has to step in and clean the books and then sell it back. We are pouring billions of dollars into institutions which we have no voice in and the credit crisis is getting worse every day. On top of that the stimulus plan won't be enough to save the economy. 3.5 million jobs created as a result of the current stimulus will not be enough to replace the potential millions more we will lose in the next year and the 4 million we have already lost.

Psalm 15 says, "Yahweh, who can find a home in your tent, who can dwell on your holy mountain?

'Tens of thousands of jobs created by the economic stimulus law could end up filled by illegal immigrants, particularly in big states such as California where undocumented workers are heavily represented in construction, experts on both sides of the issue say.   Studies by two conservative think tanks estimate immigrants in the United States illegally could take 300,000 construction jobs, or 15% of the 2 million jobs that new taxpayer-financed projects are predicted to create.      They fault Congress for failing to require that employers certify legal immigration status of workers before hiring by using a Department of Homeland Security program called E-Verify. The program allows employers to check the validity of Social Security numbers provided by new hires. It is available to employers on a voluntary basis.'

20090309102909AAgqW2c	Politics & Government;Politics	Question about the ideology of conservatism and if it makes sense?	If I get conservatism, it basically says:   Less gov't interference and low taxes should spur the most growth in the economy and benefit the most people in theory.  People are free to work or not work and experience the natural consequences of their own actions.      But it is claimed (by conservatives) that the financial crisis was sparked by dems trying to help the huge numbers of poor Americans own homes. How could a system be that stable if the gov't trying to help the huge numbers of existing poor people simply cause the whole house of cards to come falling down?      I guess it seems a conservative would say that if one does not wish to work hard enough to afford a certain level of success, then that's his/her failure (not the gov'ts).  But that means conservatism virtually guarantees that there will be a sizable number of people who cannot or will not do what is necessary to achieve a desired or comparable level of success.  In other words, conservatism guarantees some degree of inequality among the population depending upon who can and/or will achieve more or less success.      Won't this inequality breed instability.  In other words, won't the people who can't or won't work hard enough to achieve as much success as others vote for any other politician who promises them more success?       Put simply: if a system (like conservatism) guarantees that there will always be haves and have-nots, won't the have-nots look for other ways to become part of the haves such as resorting to committing crimes, forming unions, demanding welfare, taking bogus loans and not them back, vote for competing political parties or systems, which will intern adversely effect the haves? How does conservatism account for all of this?

Flashback: 2006 Poll Showed Most Democrats Wanted Bush to Fail      An August 2006 poll conducted by FOX News/Opinion Dynamics showed 51 percent of Democrats did not want Bush to succeed.       Rush Limbaugh took a lot of heat for saying he wants President Obama to fail -- but a lot of Democrats felt the same way about former President George W. Bush during his second term.      An August 2006 poll conducted by FOX News/Opinion Dynamics showed 51 percent of Democrats did not want Bush to succeed. Thirty-four percent of independents also did not want Bush to succeed.      By comparison, 90 percent of Republicans said at the time that they wanted Bush to succeed, and 40 percent of Democrats said the same.       http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100...

Should I go ahead and apply now or wait until I actually get my bachelor's degree? I heard you get paid more, and you have a better chance of getting hired if you have a bachelor's, but I figure I would have it by the time I get into the whole process. I was also considering other police officer positions with other cities. I'm also female and asian if that might help my chances? Any advice would be great. Thank You.

What happened to Radar, Laser, etc. Why can this cop fly down the road at 85 mph, no one to follow, no responder lights, I call it abuse of authority, why can this cop get away with feeling above the law, why wasn't he just cruising at 70, of course I wasted just as much of his time reading his printouts, as I understand he was not responding to any calls, because dropping behind the car that wasn't afraid to follow him was obviously more important.

If you're Jewish or Muslim and female, you must stay away from Kassel University's Global Political Economy program. Sexual harassment and racism are common there. The university refuses to respond to their professors' misbehavior, and the students are so dull that no good university in the world would accept them; thus they watch whatever happens open-mouthed and thoughtlessly. Professor Dr. Christoph Scherrer, heading the GPE program there, is responsible for this Nazism against the Jews and Muslims. The German govt., as you may be aware, even destroys anti-Nazi symbols. The professor has repeatedly received warnings, but refuses to stop sexually harassing women and making racist remarks. Would Germany never become clean of racism?

I dont want to waste another $250 trying to change her name and be denied again. Her father (whom she feels rejected and unloved by) will contest the name change out of spite for me. He left when she was 2 months and chose to see her very rarely up untill she was 8.5 years. she goes every other wknd now for the last 4 years because he has a wife that includes her but she still feels a major disconnect from him and his family. I havent urged her to or even brought the name change up. She wants it done and uses my last name for everything at school except for legal things. She deserves to have the name she feels the connection with. Will we be denied again? I am so hesitant to forge ahead because I always end up screwed when matters concern him, horrible luck.

But I live in the suburban area of it where crime is low and its actually a nice community.   Unfortunately, I share a street ( I live in a house ) with a middle age couple who has been harboring some hatred against my family.   It all started when they accused us of breaking in their garage. Which was not possible because I was in the Philippines attending to my dying mother.   From 2007-2009 They have      1. Trespassed to our yard when we are not home   2. Littered our front lawn with branch clippings   3. Called us out as we walk out of our home, trying to provoke a fight   4. Took pictures of us when we had to trim down a weed and a bush that was scratching our cars.   5. used their trash bins as  street markers in our sidewalk so they park their car ( they have 4) at our side of the driveway.   We called community services on this one because what they did is illegal.   6. They have spoken to our other street neighbors spreading fabricated lies about us.      We called the police advice on issues 2-3 but since they never said any specific " I'm gonna get you" threat. They cannot do anything.   We also tried to cordially reason with them, by asking them to file a case against us but they refused due to lack of physical evidence on their own accusations. Stating they are basing it or circumstantial theory.      The last draw was this Saturday, as I was going out to do my laundry and was loading our things in the car. The unruly neighbors husband was asking if we were moving out. When we said no, he responded back by saying   " too bad, we don't like your kind here " And continued to provoke a fight with us.   When the husband came back to me with a broom as he was continuing to provoke us, that’s when I screamed because the broom was very near to my face. The wife who was all that time just watching, decided to stop the fight after I screamed.   We called the police, they came over but the best thing only they can do is ask us to file a restraining order against them.      This is my home, I love where I live. I can’t leave my pets. It’s hard to find a place that allows a pet or is affordable with a yard. And why should I move out of my own house?   I am fearing for my safety. I am in the process of filing a restraining order and a blotter report against them. But why is it there is no law that will protect us until some one gets hurt?

I have 2 children under 16 years old (can't apply for immigration without parental consent) and live in the UK. We first came here in 2004 with their american passport and I did not request a Visa because I was waiting for their French birth certificate (Proof of EU citizenship). I now have those and felt that nothing needed to be done since I have this proof they are EU. Recently someone told me that because of their American passport versus a French one I still need to apply for immigration. I am scared to go in person to the office of immigration and to find out that they are here illegally!! I tried to call the Home Office but they told me to call EU immigration and gave me the wrong number. Anyone knows where and whom I should call to get this information verified? (and if this is correct of course)

I was reading something on one of the senators from South Carolina, Jim DeMint.  The article said that senator DeMint does not believe single mothers or openly gay individuals, should be able to teach in public schools.  What kind of position is that?  How would either of those situations effect education?  Im in high school and never in my life have i ever asked a teacher if they were a single mother or if they are gay, so why would that even matter, they never told us if they were because it is not a relevant issue.  Basically the senator is saying to either live your Life and don't fulfill your passion to teach or hide your life and continue your job.  I realize that there are many other issues that go into choosing your candidate, but come on, this is absurd.  I'm glad i don't live in SC..nothing against anyone from there lol - just saying
20090309152259AABS12j	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Would this be considered murder?	When I was younger, I saw a news article about a Mexican actress in Mexico that died out of sheer terror when a robber armed with a gun ran up to her SUV and tried robbing her. The report said that she died instantly because of the tremendous scare she was put through, and the criminal that provoked her death was never caught. I actually have two questions about this. Suppose this were to happen here in the USA. If the criminal were to get caught, aside from being convicted of armed robbery, would he also be convicted of murder? Also, suppose the victim were pregnant when she died. Would the criminal also be convicted of murdering the victim's baby? Why or why not?

20090309140404AAIwcKy	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	City council public meetings?	I have been to a City council meeting tonight as a member of the public. An important decision was made by the committee without asking for any participation from the floor. As this meeting was open to the public, do the public then become part of the meeting, by that I mean do they or should they have a say.      I was most annoyed at the fact that one member of the committee used incorrect figures and the moans from several members of the public were not enough for the corrections to be entered as minutes to the meeting.      Personally I thought that the committee were cowards in not allowing the public to speak and had already made up their minds before the meeting started especially when one member of the committee was called forward by the chairman before the meeting began for a chat. Surely each member should just take their seats in order to show a fair and unbiased meeting.      I would welcome comments from anyone who deals with council politics and any people in the law who know what the etiquette should be at a public meeting.      People will now lose their jobs because of this decision and they have a lot and I mean a lot of public support with over a 700 person petition and at least a 1000 hits on a face book page. I would like be able to direct those affected to matters of law or examples where directives have been overturned because of misconduct by elected council members.

Is there anyone that has gone recently that would be comfortable sharing a round about figure how much a typical pay check was while in boot camp as an E3,2,1 etc?

I will be in the reserves and i know my full time job more than covered all my bills.  So needless to say going through boot camp will be a pay cut but i still need to plan. thanks guys

When  a customer pays with a credit card, the machine gives out their copy and a store copy. I was told to keep Visa, Mastercard, and Discover card in separate piles.   I did so most of the time but a few times I did forget and I always straighted it out when reminded. Still everything seemed fine.    Well today I went in for my shift and he totally fired me for the reason that I was not separating the receipts. I was completely speechless because I almost always separated the receipts and even so .... what a dumb reason. I called another girl that worked there who was a nice girl I became friends with. I guess this had been the mangers plan, to fire me.....  replace me with her and then higher someone else in his family and fire her!!!!   I defiantly don't need unemployment but I want some action taken against him, since that manager was hired   (2 months ago) he fired 7 people and 1 quit. He admits to doing so because he didn't like someone in his employees family,   on many occasions he would tell my friend  to put a hamster or ferrite that was still alive in the freezer and kill it  because it had a scratch and she refused... so he killed the ferrets himself by putting them in the freezer while they were still alive. Customers are complaining and he has been herd calling a costumer and  mother of an employee foul names. He has denied military their discount because he simply didn't like that person   I'm not sure whats up with the owner, he must be blind but me and my friend want something to be done!!! I was told you have to be written up a couple times before they can fire you that they must have a legitimate reason why they let you go.  What is the law in the state of Georgia

I asked this question before but only got reamed by the high and mighty here on y/a who never misspell anything at anytime here. Right.  I misspelled borders and few answered the question. So I'll try again.      The VAST majority of people in this country are against illegal immigration and want immigration in general to slow down. Our elected officials do not see it that way. I think they are dragging their feet on this because they want the US and Mexico to become ONE and by allowing this flood on Mexicans into this country, it WILL become one whether we like it or not. It's like slowly raising the heat on a pan with a frog in it. The frog is cooked before he knows what hit him and never jumps out of the pot.

I just would like to get a legal opinion. I got caught for a shoplifting $10 item at Sears, Chicago, IL, but I didn't mean it, I put it in my jacket pocket while I was looking at other things and I just forgot about it and left. I know the reason of thefting doesn't mean anythinng but It was an accident which I never had in my life and never will. But I got a lesson don't loose my memory never again at lease in the store. The security personal took my ID info, picture of me and my signature on a document which I don't even remember exactly what it was, but I think it was the document that I am not coming back to that store. They said I will receive papers by mail and the decision from their lawyer. Police was never called. They let me out of the store through a back door.

20090309140538AArIzRK	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Genuine mistake in claiming JSA, am about to be interviewed for fraud, what will happen to me?	I started signing on about a year ago because I was made redundant. I am constantly searching and applying for jobs and am heavily in debt with other personal problems I am having to deal with at the moment also. Last august I took a part time job at my local football club, where I work just about on average less than one shift of  about five hours every fortnight for minimum wage. Normally I wouldn't have taken it, but being so badly in debt, every single penny counts.    I always genuinely believed that I could still claim JSA because I work under 16 hours a week (In my case a LOT less), but after receiving a letter from the fraud department and doing a lot of research I am now aware that I was supposed to declare this.    I am fully aware I am in the wrong and I will make sure I rectify what I have done, but this is a genuine mistake. I am not very clued up on claiming benefits and I just do what my adviser tells me to do (and they change every week). I am still constantly applying for jobs, I feel desperate and I am even applying for jobs I once would have thought to be below me, and I would never continue to sign on with a full time job. I am not a malicious person and I would never in a million years deliberately commit fraud. I was hoping someone might be able to offer some advice on how to handle this matter?   I am scared because the last thing I need is a criminal offence added to my record, as I have two driving offences from a a couple of years ago. Since then I have made every effort to turn my life around and become a better person and I am finding it so difficult at the moment to find a job it is deeply getting me down and this will only hinder my chances (even though it is my fault for not being more aware).

In any case, my question is this. I have documented many times that she has abused my stepson but have always been afraid to report it as we lived together and I thought they may take him away. We live separately now and he stays with her (which was another underhanded thing she did, not a court order). I am wondering if I should report her now for all the things she did to him while living with us and continues to do at her mother's home or if this will still somehow hurt us? Everything is entirely true but I am still afraid to report it, especially while we are in court.

20090309120338AA3zvPs	Politics & Government;Military	Funny things for a loved one to (NOT) say/ask the DI while your man is in Marine Boot Camp? (AGAIN)?	My fiance is at USMC Boot Camp right now. & I've been putting together newsletters for him while he's at there. Included in this newsletter, are funny "Top Ten" lists. I need help to add to my latest topic, "Top 10 things to say when we call your DI on his cell phone."       *PLEASE NOTE I ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT CONTACT HIS DI FOR ANY REASON, THIS IS A JOKE ONLY TO MAKE MY FIANCE LAUGH.*      This is what I have so far, thanks to some help in my previous post.      10. My fiancé really misses his cats. Do you think we could schedule a visitation?   9. Please let the cooking staff know that he likes his pancakes stacked in two, and cut four ways (two horizontal & two vertical).   8. His muscles are too big already. Could you please not make him do any more pushups?   7. My fiancé says that when you scream and bang on the shitters, it is very hard for him to concentrate. I would appreciate it if you would leave him alone when he is trying to do private things such as using the head and rain room.   6. The DVR thingy got unplugged & Family Guy will be on in an hour. Please ask him where the red cord plugs into & call me back ASAP.   5. Ran into some trouble & had to sell his car. Couldn’t find the Power of Attorney, so I forged his name. Tell him not to worry, but if he still has that $20 to send it in his next letter.   4.   3.   2.   1. As his cavities are now fixed, please be sure that he is served slightly more cookies      Any funny ideas to add to my list will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!!! :)

I really dont wanna go as far as sueing but...today at lunch i had a pizza lunchable.  and opening it...my friend cristina noticed green fluid and large grey/brown chunks in the pizza slot and all inside the cheese.  I described it as bird poop.  lol.  I am poor and these lunchables are like red lobster to me.  My guess is there are birds in that factory and i happened to be the lucky winner.
