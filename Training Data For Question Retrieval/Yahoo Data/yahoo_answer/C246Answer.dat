BKrqlGz4aa	The first Star Wars movie made was what is now known as Star Wars:  Episode IV:  A New Hope.  It was released in 1977.  Others have mentioned a "name change" for this movie.  That's true but most of them don't know that there was actually two name changes.  The movie was in theaters briefly (2 weeks) in 1976 and the title was "The Star Wars".  When it came back out in 1977 the title was "Star Wars".  When it became clear that the movie was a smash hit Lucas changed the name to what it is now ... Episode IV:  A New Hope.  This change became legal Jan 1 1979.    Order of the movies is as follows:    Order in which they were made:    1977 - Star Wars Episode IV:  A New Hope  1980 - Star Wars Episode V :  The Empire Strikes Back  1983 - Star Wars Episode VI:  Return Of The Jedi    1997 - SE (Special Edition) Versions of ep IV - ep VI    1999 - Star Wars Episode I   :  The Phantom Menace  2002 - Star Wars Episode II  :  Attack Of The Clones    2003 - The Clone Wars Micro Series Chapters 1 - 20  2004 - The Clone Wars Micro Series Chapters 21 - 25    2004 - DVD Versions of ep IV - ep VI    2005 - Star Wars Episode III:  Revenge Of The Sith    2008 - Star Wars The Clone Wars (Animated Movie)  2008 - ????

The last three made were 1, 2 and then 3. I can't remember the names of the last ones, but the third one they made was Return of the Jedi.

dYyiG90caa	I am going to say "Mean Streets" for One Reason, Only.    It does not get the Attention of the Oscar Nominated and Brilliant "Taxi Driver."    Other than that -- They are equally Brilliant.    Scorsese -- So Ahead of His Time !!  .|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	Taxi Driver-DeNiro plays crazy good|`|wXv50mNEaa	I have to say Mean Streets. Taxi Driver was the first Scorsese I saw, and it turned me on to him completely. Still, I think Mean Streets is superior, because instead of exploring only one character (i.e. Travis Bickle), and exploring themes mainly from his point-of-view, it's got two incredibly interesting, thought-provoking characters, whose personalities play off each other brilliantly,  not to mention one of the best movie endings ever.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	Taxi Driver, It's a movie that made me look at life a little differently.  take care  dave|`|bFdqlM6oaa	Taxi Driver.    I've never seen Mean Streets so Taxi Driver wins by default.|`|ACiTb0c0aa	Taxi Driver is one of my favorite thrillers ever!

I would like to just snap and turn vigilante sometimes.|`|u70TaWI5aa	Taxi Driver De Niro takes it.|`|l6JN3cPqaa	I love both films, but I actually prefer "Mean Streets".    I love DeNiro's character. His "I owe everybody money and I don't care" street wise guy attitude is so much fun to watch. Plus it's cool to know that it's this film that made future DeNiro/Scorsese team ups (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Casino) so great.     "You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets".    Classic!|`|hZegT1raaa	taxi driver...one of de niro's best movies|`|qh9Pa1tVaa	Taxi Driver.   Why?

Rmy8bWnsaa	It's one of my top 10 favorite films. It has been called the Citizen Kane of horror films and I would definitely agree with that statement. It really is one of the most unique movies I've ever seen. I like how it combines several different genres together, it was just way ahead of it's time I think. It's too bad that most people have probably only seen the hilarious Nicholas Cage remake.    I don't know if you've seen this video on youtube, but it's hilarious..  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_mW8mBzm...|`|ONWCXzUMaa	I thought it was much better than the remake  take care   dave|`|iFb7BJydaa	I must agree with Lori. Nick my man...what were you thinking sweetie?!|`|l6JN3cPqaa	Its a very chilling film.     The ending is deeply disturbing.          PS... dont bother with the 2006 version. Its terrible.|`|dYyiG90caa	I'm not sure that I've seen it ??    II keep thinking of Sam Peckinpah -- but that would be "Straw Dogs"    It's about a Coven, right ??  .|`|VR9Yjvt8aa	Loved it.     @ Lori, et al...Yeah, Nick Cage really took a dump on his career with that one.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	I liked it ok it was kind of strange but the remake was terrible-Nicholas Cage should be embarrassed for that one|`|TY21iw5taa	I thought it was a freaking fantastic film.Very dark,and very sad in a way(the end did disturb me as well).Heh,the power and irrationality of faith...  It's been a while since I've seen it though; I'd like to watch it again at some point.    Too bad that that recent remake with Nicholas Cage was absolute rubbish-or so I thought(oh well; it's a film that,like so many others,didn't need to be remade).

DUGZa0Zgaa	All I have to say about that is YEAH RIGHT!  Sammy Hagar just plain sucks.  Joe Satriani is a self-indulgent masturbatory guitar player.  Also, in my opinion, there is nothing notable about Chad Smith or Michael Anthony.      Like you said--the band is extremely hyped.  Probably nothing more.

Also, this is more of a character song than a 'relationship' one, but this reminds me of Jasper, both in New Moon and Breaking Dawn- http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=lEgvzmyafk...   not reading too much into the lyrics, but the song in general reminded me of when he was telling his back story.     I very much apologise if any of that spoiled the story in any way, i try not to as somebody spoiled Breaking Dawn for me and i was furious.

KdCzS5Q4aa	Why do kids like you seem to think that Disney stars are "perfect"?  And 14 years old IS still a kid.  However,14 is old enough to know good music.|`|z8NdIIfqaa	shes not  her hair looks like fried road kill  and thats not good music that you just named  except the beatles and breaking benjamin  the other people suck|`|hCI6HFEnaa	She can't be perfect.    Although she's certainly better than Miley - yeah, she's SERIOUSLY messed up.|`|Y29OiWJbaa	Neither of them are even cute. Maybe you should have your mommy take you to an eye doctor.|`|biheycXqaa	"Nobody is perfect. Anyone who thinks they are are simply better at hiding their imperfections than the rest of us" (Quote by ME!)  So Selena Gomez is not perfect - she knows this - but because she is a "Disney Darling" she has to be sure not to make anything that would besmirch her spotless appearance.   Demi isn't perfect either. And neither is Miley.  And I'm gonna wager the guys aren't perfect either..... Zac, the Jonas Brothers.... none of them!!!!  NOBODY IS PERFECT!!|`|Fyt9JxTqaa	That's dumb. She can't be perfect. She's Disney. eurrg!    By the way, you are a kid if you're 14.|`|IpFgrkJAaa	WHY??? demi isnt or miley...|`|NDhC2PNGaa	NO one is perfect.. fact|`|kdmhuVTEaa	I don't care at all for the new Disney stars, but indeed she is pretty.

Ir6TLlGfaa	DEFINITELY read the books first then see the movie.  i was in love with the books. they are SO much better then the movie.  in my opinion, the movie was horrible in comparison to the books.  the books are really good.  the movie is only good for people who have never read the books.  Good Luck with your choice!|`|xzTZ2aHxaa	book definately.  but robert pattinson is hot.|`|BCu8rER4aa	TWILIGHT BOOKS  no question about it,..  but sorta like the movie though!,..  TWILIGHT SAGA RULES!|`|Z2sv5jJ6aa	i think the book is way better than the movie because the movie leaves out good stuff  from the book like were bella asked edward if someone dares you to eat food and edward took a bite of pizza|`|Txm6l89haa	anything has to be better than the book|`|JzYlcuXzaa	The book blows the movie away by far, usually the case though.  Books are always better because it's your own imagination calling the shots.|`|ivqfhzHXaa	i havne't read the books, but everybody tells me that they are much better than the movie.|`|M0598bvzaa	read the book then watch the movie|`|D2WLPK0gaa	I personally hate reading and love watching movies...  So, not just Twilight, but watching any movie based on a novel I would enjoy way more than reading the book =]|`|BKybwvF5aa	I'm getting tired of answering this question. Lol! But I love the books way more! I read the books first and was a little disappointed with the movie. I love the movie too of course, just because it's Twilight, but the books are the best.|`|S4W7FojCaa	I saw the movie first and I loved it and that's what got me into the series. Currently I am reading Twilight and I am on page 111 and I have to say that the book is better. Some things in the book that Edward and Bella say are funny in the book. But in the movie there isn't any humor just romance and some action. I'm not saying romance is bad, I love it. But I think they could have put some humor in the movie too. The book is so much better and makes me laugh and wonder what's going to happen even though I already know what's going to happen. Reading the book is just so much more exciting in my opinion. In my opinion, watch the movie first and then read Twilight and the rest of the series. I like to picture Robert Pattinson as Edward in the book. If I had read the book first (when the movie wasn't even made yet) I would have pictured Edward completely different. Overall, I'm glad to have watched the movie first and then read the book. The books are much, much better.|`|YGKEvC3Eaa	BOTH =D|`|8FOvqcXVaa	both read first|`|7tyRW6oIaa	i believe the books are better.  i've read all the books and i've seen the movie twice. the movie doesnt really depict the books that well. it seems to be more sped up in the movie u kno? the books are the best :)|`|kaPnRKcwaa	Books definitely    movie was decent though. Except they should have done the meadow scene word for word in the movie, would have been Amazing.
B0avgIpRaa	It was the theory of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn that the will of the Force caused his birth.    "One of the interesting ideas brought up in episode iii was the idea that the sith actually created anakin by manipulating the midi-chorians. Although Palpatine does not state this explicitly in the movie, it was implied even more strongly in earlier drafts, and I recall Lucas or someone saying that he intended to leave the issue unresolved. I have also read that some belive that the sith not only created anakin, but they also created the so-called jedi prophesy to aid their long term goals."    "I'm sorry, but all this stuff about Darth Plageius creating Anakin is pure fan speculation, and nothing more. It's baseless and wild. All that we know about Anakin's origin is that his conception was the Will of the Force. The Force created him; that's the extent of our knowledge. Perhaps some things are meant to remain mystery"  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anakin...    So apparently it was the will of the Force.|`|HS7qRRiWaa	According to the story line there is  a prophacy that 1 will be born from the force. In other words, the midi-clorines will fertilize a mother to cary a child. Midi-chlorians (also spelled "midi-clorians" or "midichlorians") are a microorganism in the fictional Star Wars galaxy, first mentioned in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. They are microscopic life-forms that reside within the cells of all living things and communicate with the Force. Midi-chlorians compose a collective consciousness and intelligence, forming links between everything living and the Force. They are symbionts with all other living things; that is, without them, life could not exist. The Jedi have learned how to listen to and coordinate the midi-chlorians. In order to be a Jedi or a Sith, one must have a high enough concentration of midi-chlorians in one's cells.|`|ODTe2l77aa	I'm pretty sure Palpatine manipulated Midichlorians or some **** like that inside of Anikan's mother so that he could create the ultimate Jedi/Sith Lord or something like that.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	It is not explained but he had "no father" and first appeared as a 9 year old slave/prodigy
28ZCfGWIaa	The Believer    The Believer" explores a Jewish student's private journey to understand the meaning of Judaism in his life. Set in New York City, the Plot follows a morally confused young adult struggling with the conflict between his beliefs and his heritage. "The Believer" examines themes of religion, family, and self-loathing. It is a psychological examination into the forces of intolerance, both on the individual and society as a whole.  Written by Joe Bloggs|`|4z0Lo0qTaa	I think it might have been the movie bella. not sure|`|zetxxZWUaa	Sounds a little like American History X but the kid wasn't jewish

lpyWVR2oaa	Just a generalization but many of the serial killers I've looked up in the past have the Moon in a Fire Sign like Aries and many have afflicted Sun-Mars or Moon-Mars contacts. The Sun signs spread across the entire zodiac but some of the most notorious ones have been Scorpio or Sagittarius Suns.
MtANnIlfaa	Well if you want us to like you, I wouldn't do what the other Capricorn gal said. Who cares about you, or your life? I dont want to hear it.    You are probably messing with the wrong type of Scorpio.. the more evolved scorpps don't let emotions get in their way. They could care less.. about anything. We're emotionless, and you could see it in our faces. The only way you could get to this type of Scorpio is by hurting one of their loved ones.. that will drive us INSANE. But please beware.. as you might already know, we will strike back with no remorse. Esecially if it's a capricorn.. PIECE OF CAKE.|`|7a8ab4344d6bd224f31215730fd8e1cfaa	You will only hurt a scorpio if he/she was in Love with you & you betrayed him/her. Scorpios love intensely so if you hurt them you would have had to have done something pretty bad. Why do you want to hurt a scorp anyway? Dont you know you will get trebble the pain back? and then some!|`|pvuGArduaa	GURL SCORPIOZ HAVE NO FEELINGS U CANNOT WIN, THIS COMING FROM A SAGITTARIUS|`|RlATSbfZaa	In my experience, a Scorpio will never let you know that you've hurt them, but they will get you back. I usually get along with Scorpios, so I've never tried to "beat" one.|`|8uvb3Nroaa	I am a scorpio and from my own experiences, you have probably wounded your target. That person is just not willing to show you that you have hurt him/her. I personally am very emotional but hardly ever show it when I am hurt. Just tend to "sting" back and move on.     Also, scorpios are notorious for not forgiving once their trust has been broken.|`|zsKtANOEaa	No bc I am one (I don't know about fake though).  It depends what you 2 are fighting about. Everyone's different. Scorpio is a fixed sign though. It also co rules mars (war).  I as a scorpio do fight w ppl a lot for different reasons, but I don't think it's such a big deal. Some ppl say that I've really hurt them and I didn't realize it. All is fair when I'm fighting w someone.     You have to expend all the scorpios energy to beat them, bc it won't happen over night. We like/thrive off of dark socially wrong themes: fighting, power struggles, dominating, torture... you know. So you are kind of an outlet to your scorpios natural obsession by fighting w them. In a sense your sharpening their "skills"|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	What's your sign?  It may have something to do with why you're not hurting them.    For instance, Cancers are known for emotional manipulation.  They cry and whine to get their way.  It works with most people but for us Capricorns, Cancer's opposite, that doesn't work.  Capricorns are not moved by false tears and whining.    We can beat Scorpios (and I have) because we're very similar.  Both of us have weird senses of humor, dry wit, and use sarcasm as a defense mechanism.  We differ in that Scorpios allow their emotions get in the way, where Capricorns throw their emotions out of the window if necessary.    EDIT: You get them where it hurts.  Every sign has its weakness.  Scorpios are known for trying to be all, "I'm so mysterious".  Don't tell them ANYTHING.  Hide things from them.  When they pull their little antics, blatantly ignore them.  Don't hold back in arguments, because God knows that they don't.

I LOVEEEE THAT SHOW!!!!    =)|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	Here piece of info but others say it's not going to happen:     Friends Movie Reportedly In Development, But Does Anyone Still Care?  With the outstanding commercial success of the Sex and the City movie, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood tried to dust off another New York City TV gang. According to a report in the British tabloid The Daily Mail, a long-awaited (maybe) big-screen adaptation of the hit TV series Friends might be on the way.     The paper reports that all six cast members have agreed to reprise their roles, but did you worry that your favorite Friends would be booked solid (::cough:: Matt LeBlanc)? And after SATC raked in $300 mil earned at the box office, even the busiest of schedules have a way of loosening up.     But is a Friends film even a good idea? Sure, Sex and the City made the transition from small screen success to blockbuster hit. But the SATC series had certain elements that made it especially well-suited for the big screen  glamorous fashions, outrageous storylines and an insanely devoted following of movie-going fans.     It also spent less time in mothballs before coming to theaters (SATC made fans wait four years between the end of the series and the arrival of the film; Friends has also been off the air for four years, but considering that a Friends flick is still little more than a rumor, the wait could go on for another few years). But we are talking about one of the most successful sitcoms of all time. More than 52 million people tuned in to see how it all wrapped upwould they come back for a film?   Would you? Do you miss your Friends enough to plunk down money for a ticket? Let us know what you think.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Actually, I loved Friends, despite everyone saying they were "sick of it" it was very cleverly written and the whole "will they won't they?" thing was enticing!    I am not sure I would like to see a film, what would they do with it?  After all, Ross finally got his Rachel, Phoebe got Married, Joey is...Joey, Monica and Chandler got the Twins but, I don't know what they would do next?      Having said that, I didn't think they could do anything more with Sex and the City, but I LOVED the film.    It's hard to tell if they would, now that they have moved on to Movies, or Screenplays - but let's face it, despite my reservations, I'd probably be in the front of the cinema queue!

Hace unos meses estuve en estados unidos y cada vez que decia que era de Argentina se ponian a cantar la cancion, era uy emosionante auqnue la re desafinaban, jeje.    Si te gusta tanto te recomiendo que busques la version de Patti Lupone, una d elas mejores para mi. Y otra genial es l de Elena Rogers, una argentina que verdaderamente siente esa cancion mas alla del personaje.

vOomJtbsaa	Wow what a lovely friend *sarcasm*..... well as of recently I've been called an "idiotic *****"  for baring my sons bum!  Lol but that's besides the point ha.  I had a family member call my son an "abomination" because he was conceived out of wedlock.  Needless to say I have yet to see that family member again (a self righteous, judgmental, crazy religious cousin of mine).  I conducted a very firm letter asking her how she could be so hurtful when she called herself a "Godly woman".... What a crock!    I also explained to her that the God I know is loving, forgiving and would never judge an innocent child because of how/when/where he was conceived.   I never got a response.  I think I got my point across.  As untrue as I know it was, it was still very hurtful.  People can be so cruel without thinking before they speak.  **Edit:  Aww thanks, Isabelle is so beautiful too!  People can be ignorant and small minded.  I'm not religious either, I believe in God but not in organized religion, partially for this reason, it teaches intolerance for certain people.  It's really sad.  I never took ti to heart, he's amazing and perfect and NOT even close to being an abomination, I was just so upset that a family member of mine would say such a thing.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	my soon-to-be-ex bf (as you know from my other questions) he once said that when I was pregnant, "I think I'm so special and act like I'm pregnant with the baby Jesus or something". yeah he's a jerk.   I dont think it was selfish of you either. if she wanted a ride, she coudlve just asked instead of faking she didnt mind taking a cab home.|`|sAAnquoTaa	Well my stepdad said I shouldn't have had a baby b/c I'm blind. My husband's family told him he'd have to do all the work with the baby because I can't see.      An x-friend of mine said he always thought I was cold and heartless when I was one of the only people that was friends with him b/c he was a littlw weird and anoying, but I looked passed that and was nice to him and he still said that about me. Notice I said X-friend?|`|qygYwdRpaa	The most hurtful thing that has EVER in my life been said to me by a family member was after i had my miscarriage.    The hospital gave me 2 photos of my baby boy, and a family member said that she wouldn't ever want to see them because she wouldn't want to remember a Pink Blob, i will never forgive her saying that and it makes me feel sick to my stomach my baby was NOT a pink blob he was perfect.    x|`|a57c02189e8a496f061aa934ef40807baa	Sorry about your x-friend.  It's good to find out things like that early though, before she really did something horrible directly to maybe your child.  For me.....just recently my daughter and grandson moved in. She'd been pretty upset about her recent breakup with her boyfriend.  Anyway, one evening we were arguing about something ridiculous, and she screamed at me "I hate it here!"....  I still go to bed with that echoing in my head.  Here I am trying to help her out and she blurts that out. I suppose when I look at my past whenever 'any' of my kids would say "I hate you" it hurts like h*ll ! !  Ofcourse they always apologize later having said it out of anger.....but it still sticks with you!  It all came down to her being upset with her x.....not me : )  Life goes on....  God Bless|`|7rCeCVl2aa	The worst possible thing anyone ever aid to me was from my ex. Our relationship had been on the cusp of growing abusive... I found out I was pregnant (5 weeks at the most) We were engaged but he wasn't very happy about this. He looked me in the eye and said, "You take care of this or I will MAKE you have a miscarriage." When I told he could f*ck off because that wasn't an option he proceeded to beat me up. When the dust settled, I filed a police report, packed his things, changed the locks and never looked back. He's been out of our lives for 7 years now. My husband adopted my son last July and we have since then had another baby. It's like he never was even a part of my life now.      As for your ex friend... SHE said it was okay! What else were you supposed to think? If she wasn't okay with it she should have said that! Glad you are not friends with her anymore. With friends like that you don't need enemies!|`|KWHiJbhaaa	AHH I have one that still bothers me too this day...  I was in the 6th grade and had a teacher Mr. Riggie(I Still remember this A&&). He really disliked me and one day he asked the whole class to name the student they thought was the worst academically, He went around the room asking everyone individually (and in all fairness I was a bad student back then.) Anyway he got to the last person and she answered then he looked over and said "I'm surprised nobody picked Barbara". I was so embarrassed I started crying I'll never forget that it was torture.|`|AA12380746	Awesome, I don't know that I would be too qeen on keeping in contact with that friend.    Just a couple months back I was telling a friend of mine about my plan to save over the year and start College fall of next year, that I felt I am not doing what I meant to be doing right now and the next step for me was an education...    she got a little bit huffy, and then said aren't you a little old for this kind of thing? it's just that it's a bit late in life to go making changes.    I'm 26 and I feel that I can do whatever it is that I want to do when I want to do it. no one is ever too old to better themselves. I just wasn't prepared for the nasty attitude and negativity I guess.|`|Tf19RETiaa	my goodness, what a b*tch, shes not understanding at all. your child comes first and she should be able to get that through her head!   well i've had alot of hurtful things said to me, but this one i remember hurt the most, and i don't even know why. i was in 6th grade and i just started a new school, and this one boy sat next to me on the bus and he was talking to his other friend about some girl that he thought was really hott and then he turned to me and started laughing and said i was the ugliest girl hes ever seen in his life and push me out of mi seat. i remember getting off the bus in tears, =/  i mean everyone is a little geeky in middle school but that doesnt give him a right to be nasty.  i really shouldnt care what people think but that was just awful.   now that im in highschool, i see him sometimes and i just hate him for it, i never met somebody so ignorant and rude to be like that towards someone. -sigh-

(it's not like boys and girls don't dance we just don't at dances even like people who are going out don't for all but like the last slow slong) haha      AND on top of that my 3 besties arn't going to it bc of freaking doctor appointments or vacations.

Last year, me and my best bud wore the same colored clothes and she listened in to  our connvo's and wears the same thing. She tries to listen 2 what we talk about! Its so annoying. i Made this game. Someoe copied me and she gets all the credit for it.     These people have no personalities so they copy others!!|`|ebc8263f08783ad56de57d33044066e4aa	imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so i thank you  -dwight k shrute|`|73455c6a787c90036b88c6c36738f763aa	Nope. I think you should be proud of that. When the other girls copy you, they are showing you in their bloody actions that you are always their idol, that's why they always want to copy you. Wouldn't you want to be idol for so many other girls?... :)|`|vUujtivhaa	No|`|ekX3l2dYaa	totally|`|meAr7GIYaa	It flatters me at first, but it can get annoying.|`|dQ99YWeoaa	I usually just think it's funny.

You are trying to be different. Unfortunaetly, you are doing something right, so now you have a little fan club.|`|qVRmpGlEaa	Doesn't it drive you crazy whenever people copy you?  I hate it! Theres these 2 girls at my school that are so caddy and fake, and always copy me! They get the same clothes/shoes as me, dye my hair when I do (not the same color), They do all the little hairstyles I do, and they'll ask me were I bought my shirt or shoes and then the next day they have the same clothes as me!!! I'm like wtf!! I go to a very very small school of like 17 students in my grade, so its not like the 'style' or anything. And i like to be unique and different so it just bugs me so much.    Does it bug you, or am I the only one?|`|rGmhJ86kaa	Trust me - You are definitely not the only one.    Happens to me all the time.

I try to tell someone that and they're like 'you should be flattered!' but who could enjoy someone doing something that you started/do?|`|1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	I'm in my 30's and it bugs me.  I have a friend who has to try and out do me all the time.  I put up a fence, she puts up a fence.  I buy a car, she buys a car, etc etc........   I finally stopped telling her what my plans were, because she would try to do it first and make it look like I copied her.  Petty I know, but so annoying.|`|MzcqaXPqaa	Well I take it has a compliment, so yes I do.|`|4HqM5Jkpaa	hey i know what you mean u know u just read my mind gal hehehe.    yes yes buge me so much esp when they cant have their own style really,,, and believe me u not the only one ,,,    i am same like u really... i hate so much when people do this why,,,    u know sometimes take me ages to find nice shoe, shirt etc,, but u know what they just go and buy same clothes,, next yeh u rit 100%..    u know be4 i used be nice to them and tell them where i got it from and how much etc,,, but since i know they copy me ,,, no ways i tell them etc,,,|`|IYF4xSTdaa	of course..|`|3F8bCZ55aa	I have learned to enjoy it.

Even though I personally only have problems with people copying my schoolwork I know how you feel. One of my friends is trying to just be different and shes got her own unique style and this other girl, who is a total wannabe is like copying her every move right down to the music she likes. Doesn't it almost feel like stalking?
aLyJe1b3aa	...Britney Spears|`|1620f8acd8e6a1bab16fb6d4bd625f7baa	Lindsay Lohan    I love Britney (although I miss the old songs like "Baby One More Time") |`|MK5Ddtiiaa	Lindsay Lohan, because she has really become awful. She always drinks and rehabs don't work for her. She is always getting into fights at clubs, airports, and other places.     She used to be a good actor. I admired her acting, but she is not as good as she used to. The child actor got into drugs and drinking. She has fallen apart and I believe she is in much much worse shape than Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, and Nicole Richie.    She is on a road to death. If she keeps it up she might die at a young age because of her actions. It is a horrible cause in every way and the parents are not there to support her even though she is an adult. The parents never really supported her and the way her father and mother defend themselves is sickening. They are idiots. However, most of Lindsay Lohan's problems are because of her.|`|yw3Jze2naa	lindsay lohan.    britney spears is actually pretty talented, i cant say i like her but she does have talent.|`|7c4a5e9Caa	Lindsay Lohan|`|AA10100701	britt she almost dropped her son body gard caught him she held her son hostage in her home she cheated on justin timberlake who is to good for her anyhow but that's not the point|`|XP36zr63aa	is both an answer? :/|`|5NBV7i5Gaa	Lindsay Lohan|`|hnwMC1XQaa	Britney Spears.|`|KWl605JTaa	lindsey lohan|`|wyRJofXJaa	goerge w. bosh|`|vOPlkCRAaa	lindsey i thinkk. she let hollywood get to her.  britney just went crazy.  they were both sane at one point though|`|XSa8fgNIaa	Lindsay Lohan|`|km1vuLUzaa	they both are pretty bad  but if i have to pick the worst- Britney|`|LRYKlzkpaa	Brittnay is definately worse!|`|ERVib5gYaa	They are both pretty crap but I'll go with Lindsay because she just does nothing with herself anymore, she's becoming a socialite.|`|j7l9gavRaa	lohan|`|x7JpsVm6aa	I feel like Britney suffered.

She got a big kick out of it and rethought her being "deformed". She told me that I was "deformed" and she was "rearranged." Sometimes the dumbest things can be used for something good.

I kind of thought it would count as surgery, because they had to put me to sleep before the procedure began and then I woke up with the circle things on my chest with wires and all that jazz (I admit, saying "Jazz" was a bit cheesy :D).    That was a long time ago and I still have a scar. I'm pretty sure it's permanent.

I guess it's because I did no revision at all for them!|`|3F8bCZ55aa	I always do well on exams so I will say Yes, I am clever at reading and passing exams.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	pretty clever|`|dDDAbqqhaa	Yes.|`|df078ac8fd8225dafd12204f9bf294dfaa	I'm always clever...but being dyslexic and having a touch of ADHD ...makes it a little harder.....but i do OK ....|`|AA11530601	somewhere in between|`|HsrCk2J1aa	im actually pretty good at exams.  i got all As on mine.|`|2ab0f4f84a201bc39a3fb4a1b64db222aa	clever.|`|K8zo9FWhaa	stupid|`|23DiWU58aa	clepid|`|7214c656b98a7065cd3fcd7c6f3e5659aa	i would say i'm smart, not clever...|`|BBVfRheyaa	Extremely stupid:}*|`|UgNHBJ3Jaa	clever ...|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	i enjoy both so i never worry about them .  enjoy|`|tOIhNyCJaa	SHUT THE **** UP|`|qvdZIMlwaa	stupid|`|TQuSnnlVaa	i am fabulous when it comes to reading and test taking|`|NqxDBO2Xaa	stupid|`|EelcKF0Vaa	Clever-I am a straight-A student.

I think it gives guys that butterfly feeling, even though they wont admit it!|`|ba46a3ce2e28f5140e36ee11c824ec41aa	about a hug is all I sure dont respect anone who gives much more than that|`|iddMxOroaa	If she goes for more than a kiss then I see no future with her, just some quick and easy fun you know, but if she doesn't even give me a kiss and keeps me wanting for more, then I respect her and think that I could possibly have a future with her, so you're a cool girl keeping us men wanting more, you keep on doing that, good for you, take care.|`|2DNpd4BLaa	a hug ;)    a kiss if im extremely impressed|`|m6jE5KVUaa	Great Question, be even better if I kissed and told!!!LOL|`|FiPuVuS7aa	evil!    me too, i tend to keep respect boundaries and wont push for any thing.    but i will want to hold hands once in a while, lol|`|77WkLOwPaa	With me the way I look, I do whatever the girl wants. I can't take any chance of losing her.|`|AA11530601	I would definitely kiss (in 23 after all) and although I would probably want to have sex with them would wait. Having sex on 1st date would reduce the chance of them wanting to see me again I believe, theyd just see me as a one night thing, which I wouldnt want. It took me ages to figure this one out by myself as no one told me and I went to an all girls school. Its sad but a lot of girls are cheating themselves cause they think it will make a guy like them more if they have sex on a 1st date.|`|f5oZRD6faa	Well on the first date you'd want to be moving on to full sex=)      Nah a little kiss should do the trick=)|`|BZ1uvtsKaa	I try to stay limited.|`|BZuy7Rrmaa	talk a kiss on the cheek at the end of the night brief embrace|`|BBVfRheyaa	Hugs & kisses.|`|AA10833587	Well since I don't date anymore because I married my date.When I was dating the first date was with respect,without that you won't get any respect,so I go as far she will let me,if I try to kiss and turns her head or says not on the first date then I respect that.Second date do the same thing ,but after the 3rd date if it happens again then it's time to move on.3 strikes and  your out.    I've been with my wife for 10  years the 17th of Feb total time together 13 same day,just because I respected the first date.Been happy since.|`|14gi4aTvaa	On my first I kissed :P|`|u3xDS7i8aa	no further than marriage|`|vRmsvSb6aa	I fck.

Cheers =)|`|st2zmU88aa	Depends on him and how its going...  nothing is really off limits.|`|u2wR9XFwaa	Hmm, depends on the person. But everyone I've gone on actual dates with, I've known forever, so it's different.. kind of :P   Normally the farthest I'd go is kissing.|`|hfE8eCktaa	Probaly a Hug... Or they will want a kiss and want more and may rape me if I say no....|`|3YJbVYaHaa	As far as she takes me!!!! ha ha, what's his face.....nice man nice!!!! lol|`|yl6kfpzpaa	as far as she wants i don't like to make things difficult
QQdOpG2xaa	succh a diva! haha|`|KLpCUF9Qaa	He's got some issues, but he's a phenomenal actor.|`|djuRlggeaa	I think he's pretty hot.      Would anyone mind to answer any of my latest 2 questions? I really need help.|`|ERVib5gYaa	He is a REALLY angry guy but I would still marry him.  He got stressed, then they told him to calm down and then he was like No lets just do the scene.. shows he's very dedicated.. but has serious anger issues. He allegedly attacked his own mother & sister too.|`|Zo6TQY6haa	I think he has anger problems. He would benefit from some anger management sessions. I respect him as an actor, but it's certainly not good for -his- health to be getting that angry about anything. It spikes your blood pressure. So he needs to relax for his own sake.|`|NQumSrA3aa	Well, I know *I'VE* yelled really horrible things at people before and then apologized later on.  Yelling at someone doesn't make you a horrible human being.  You have to realize you are hearing four minutes of someone in a very very bad mood and we also have no way of knowing if his reaction was provoked in some way.    I'm not saying he was right to do it, but I am saying he's human and we all make mistakes.  I don't know him personally, but I really admire his dedication to acting without being a publicity whore like everyone else in Hollywood.  He's a really wonderful actor and that's what I care about.
RnFpjFODaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGPi0NPzv...    feel better hun :)|`|N2rntAqvaa	BBBBBBBB........  Bwell....   Sowy...   I memt Sowy..  I meam, waif..       WHAT THE **** IS WRONG WITH MY MOUSE!!!  I MEAM MOUS!  I MEEM!      Okay enough Gibberish tolk...  I mean talk...  Hey I got it right...!        So umm...   Want some speed?  I will give you some speed...    Don't give me that puppy face...  Stop it!  Stop the face!! I mean it!    *throws an apple at you*    Now will you stop?      OKAY!   Speed?  *pushes you on a cart*    When I go fast on a cart I giggle.  Did you know gigling is fun?    You just giggle..  And it is fun!    *giggles*      Oh...  how fun...    Doesn't it annoy you when Yahoo always tells you that you have a big number of misspelling?  It makes me think that I am a low class guy...    I am a high class guy....       For example: On the plane, (that cost me 5 bucks a ticket), I was sittting in 100th class seats, when other people with suits, cool phones, and expensive glasses are sitting in a 1st class seat!    1st class is lower than 100.  The 100th class seats are much higher...    Enough with class stalk...  I mean talk...  *thinks to himself*    Thinking:'omg..  I said stalk...  Hope she doesn't find out I am stalking her..  Maybe she did?!!?!  Is that why she is upset?'    Haha..  ha..  Umm...   I meant talk...  you know that...    *closes stalking instruction book*    Wanna laugh?  *tickles*    O wait, this is a website, and tickling through a website is clearly impossible...  DUH!    So umm..  Why do you call yourself Mehh?    Do you mean "me"?  Or, do you mean "may"?    No no...  I am pretty sure it is Mehhhh... Like a sheep does mehhh....   Not like a cow though.  A cow does "Mooo"    See the difference?  A cow does MOOOO  and a sheep does MEhhhh    Are you a sheep?  Or do you have bad grammar and you meant moo?  Because if you mean moo, then you are a cow.  If you mean me, then you are a human.      If you just say it cause you can't talk, then you are an alian.  If you are an alian, I can teach you something!  Say:"MOOOOOOOOOOOO".    Now, say "HAHAHAHAHAHA".    See?  You laughed.    Haha.|`|U047ZtGnaa	http://brycemckenney.blogspot.com/2008/0...      that made me say cheese|`|kUryFgB0aa	well, i ran out of cake pans for my bday so i wound up making a doll cake.  you know, the kind that 3 year olds get with the cake skirt then the barbie doll in the middle.  i was turning 15.    this happened yesterday; i made her into hermione ;D    would you like me to dress up like fictional character?|`|yGQgdYNwaa	What brown and rhymes with snoop?

m4yyCDNCaa	I'm a very happy drunk & that can be good or bad. Good because I get pretty outgoing, bad because you might be able to talk me into anything! lol Which is why I don't drink a whole lot often.|`|st2zmU88aa	Better  i'm way more outgoing.. and funny.|`|r8s5j6zOaa	the better, I love everyone when I'm drunk except for jerks|`|9kLiiDzVaa	i stay the same|`|KQJPWWjeaa	It doesn't really change at all.|`|AA11749193	Not sure, but I feel better!|`|PTXzRjtkaa	nope the same|`|1fFn1UhEaa	I'm already outgoing..when i drink i'm friends with everyone!  So all my friends say that they like to go drinking with me, since i always end up getting invited to some after hours party.|`|C9djEwkfaa	better .. i get goofy not stupid just goofy and i think i am more outgoing when drinking ....|`|6tGYe5roaa	It depends. I get very outgoing when I am drunk. I am incredibly loud and usually all over the place. The only bad thing is that I will admit I can get annoying at times. Sometimes I'm a little too loud and I tend to ramble a lot.|`|dqxW1W0eaa	No,I just caint walk straight no more....hic-cup|`|UxSF3Doaaa	Pretty much the same. Except I would come down with the worse case of the giggles.    I don't get mean or obnoxious with people when I was drunk, I promise.    There were a few times I got drunk, but it was not intentional. I like to stay ABOVE the table!     However, I'm not really the drinking type most the time.|`|f5oZRD6faa	The worse: heres what happens...    Vodka...i go crazy!  Whiskey...i get really aggresive and start fights!  Wine...i get emotional and cry!  Rum...i pass out or am all over people!    I say and do thing i shouldnt and wake up embarrassed=(
nRSjUKJZaa	No thanks I'll take a cremation and a pretty blue and orange urn.|`|tAD171Uiaa	I think they froze Walt Disney, like chryogenically.    Like in that movie Demolition Man.    And no, i would'nt like it!|`|exOOXAkBaa	I believe in reincarnation.|`|m4yyCDNCaa	No...but then again shoved in the dirt, frozen, I'm still dead either way and my body is of no use to me.|`|AA11749193	Nothing wrong with this picture....Don't think it will freak my kids out, as I plan on having my frozen remains parked in their house. A lot cheaper than a funeral.|`|41ca4048434b582d86fd5aed978234e2aa	they can just burn me and give my ashes to research|`|YsH4NjUhaa	I want the opposite.  I'm going to be cremated|`|nVQGpvuoaa	No. Maybe later.

8oUIx5Uzaa	I LOVE Twilight!!!!!!!  its my third favorite out of ALL of them!!!  because:  1.) Edward Cullen (duh)  2.) The adventure and suspense  3.) Like when you start it you just cant put it down its like you cant wait to see what happens next!  4.) Edward Cullen is *ahem* the perfect guy!  any girl that reads it, just falls in love with him (me being one of them)  it's almost like a alternate reality that's well...........indescribable!  wbu?  do you like it?  If you do....you should read Midnight Sun (Edwards perspective of Twilight)  it's utterly amazing (to bad that person had to illegally leak it onto the internet! ugh ) {now there's only 12 chapters! }  go here to read it :  http://www.stepheniemeyer.com  good luck!  TEAM EDWARD!  =]|`|xUKLUSL5aa	i like it. i dont really know why. but i like romance.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	I do. I don't know when I started reading it I just got caught up in the book.  And most people who don't like it haven't even read a page and they just say they hate it.  Oh well?      But I like it|`|LRLu1ofNaa	I don't. It sucks.|`|cw7Ubhh5aa	Not me.|`|HLf1QYd1aa	ANOTHER Twilight question?

It interests me.  I like suspenseful love stories.|`|kUryFgB0aa	i like the book because of the storyline.  not the writing- stephen king was correct on that.      when a book sucks me into a plot like that, it's an undescribable force|`|AawnVShdaa	I do. But it's just my opinion. Not everyone likes it, and not everyone hates it. It is just a book not like rocket science. There is not "Right" answer, you can say anything. It is just an opinion.  I like it cause I can kind of relate to the characters, and I think it is different and unique. Really you can't judge a cover for twilight.
wSYhEREjaa	go look for her in places where you think she would be. Just drive around in a car and look for her, call her other friends and ask them if they've seen her or you can ask your other friends. Maybe call her other family like an uncle, aunt, grandma, grandpa and ask if they've seen  her, Maybe she'll show up for school. Good luck    ?|`|FgHwxPeGaa	You tell the cops to find her|`|5IsOgX8jaa	Look where she was last time.

Getting it there would be such a hassle, and it wouldn't be something anyone could see (except perhaps a radiologist) and the bit it's on might have to come out sometime. So that makes it the most pointless extravagance I have imagined.    Face tattoos are part of traditional Maori culture here in New  Zealand. It takes a while to get used to them but eventually you can learn to look a person in the eye, and to see the face beneath the 'mask'. (I have worked a lot with clowns who wear makeup that covers their faces. You get used to it, but it can freak out small kids.)|`|fHxpycJSaa	The face and neck. I can't wait to see some of these people when they get to be middle aged and older. It's going to be hilarious.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	Face.    I like tattoos anywhere other than that. I think they say a lot about a person.|`|RwNVHqWnaa	on your face!|`|uKpi4I5Oaa	right over your eyelid or the back of your ear would probably the most weird place to put one|`|W3gpfzj2aa	On your face! Some people actually do that I never would. eww... But if I ever did I'd get one on my ankle! :D|`|HQ1t2ayLaa	I agree with anne that is the worst place for a tattoo on your face. That is so silly.|`|JS1iubeGaa	On your tongue and yes people really do get tongue tattoos|`|UL4gkPgyaa	on the neck is the dumbest place to get one unless its on the back part of your neck. but a nice place to get one is on your torso. Or on your lower back but on to the side.|`|yD152y92aa	Worst place is on the face.|`|RugUki9qaa	It doesn't matter what you think. Tattoos should only matter to the individual who gets them. I have 5 tattoos, including a lower back tattoo which I LOVE.|`|PqmmyV6baa	Your face
gTqSEncHaa	to matthew weaver    i am pretty sure you mixed up white and black|`|4BppP7Mkaa	Kinda noticed ages ago.|`|i2SiEsU0aa	They say black and white are not colors|`|CGPhWIfEaa	Black and white aren't colours, they're shades.|`|YG4VMafEaa	Black and white aren't colors. They're shades.|`|OEngots7aa	Black is all colors, white is absence of color.  I think they're generally excluded from the color wheel, but hey. I find it funny that they occasionally have to tell you what the color of something is.

i0ZHQRVfaa	as sick as it sounds, i believe they have a cure for cancer too. Chemo patients are paying so much money for their medication, so what's a better  way to make money? As long as they keep their cure secretive, the payroll will just keep adding on.|`|rnH9NnZRaa	I think they have a cure for certain types of cancer but not all of them.    Cancer like everything else in this world evolves so it will be a never ending battle.|`|a4fddaf6a1e7cc689b0611f98a1c96acaa	No, I do not believe that.|`|vVfH8yBYaa	You crazy conspiracy theory folks!!    If you happened to be the person that found the cure to cancer, would you allow someone to pay you off in order to keep it a secret? No.    Scientists don't labor over things like curing cancer for fun (or profit). They do it because they are intelligent, driven individuals who know they can contribute something to this world. If they found a cure, there would be no way to shut them up. The personal accomplishment would far outweigh any possible pay off.

Z2isnS2Raa	20 years older please|`|vED4iORiaa	I would rather marry someone older...Harley likes her men properly aged|`|AAgX0SDcaa	how about both??? no problem|`|tLVZXLRSaa	I don't think I'd marry someone 20 years older than me unless he was a certain famous celebrity I have a crush on.    But I'd definitely marry someone who is from a different culture than me. There's nothing wrong with that.|`|JEnGz5I4aa	younger|`|TzHsjqcIaa	*I would rather marry someone 80 years my senior...sexy|`|isxJ57beaa	someone with a very different culture who speaks my language   preferably chinese! (they're smart and cook yummy food!)|`|xYLnLCVVaa	it depends on the people. I would not want to date someone 20 years younger than me, that is for sure. Maybe 20 years older, but not at this point in my life, considering i am only 17. It really does depend on the people. I don't see anything wrong with dating outside of my culture.|`|1t9tJHSsaa	I'm American, and for me it would depend on his familial background, what he believes in, the way his family and I got along, and how his family and my family got along, and all that good stuff.    8 years is my limit. D: I don't go for the old men, or the younger men. It's just too nasty/awkward.|`|FS9ibKB5aa	ehhhh...20 years older.|`|aBBYWL65aa	20 years older...only I wouldn't mind someone of a different culture either.|`|ViNFT9RQaa	hmm older or from a diff culture... who cares as long as he's a hottie!|`|9pmpr0Eyaa	love baby its all about the love|`|tFGMfDthaa	I did marry someone who is 10 years younger than me. We met when he was 31 and I was 41. We got married when he was 41 and I was 51. That was in 2005.  Age is just a number as long as you both feel the same way.|`|tDU347knaa	I'm from the United States, and I'd rather marry someone with a very different culture/background who speaks my language.

Like a middle eastern girl. Belly dancer possibly or gypsy|`|jAAWM3Kyaa	another culture|`|zRlDQ9JJaa	Younger|`|AA12278670	Well, I wouldn't marry someone younger because I would always feel insecure as I aged. Not to mention I'm tired of dealing with immaturity as is. 20 yrs older...yeah, I probably would. Seeing as how the last oldest guy I dated was 15 yrs older, 5 more years wouldn't matter much. I don't think I'd marry a Middle-Eastern, just because I'm very independent and strong-willed and like my tattoos too much...and wouldn't take well to the male-superiority way of thinking most of their family members would try to impose/instill...|`|YL0DypySaa	I'd date someone from a different culture. =) Different cultures are fascinating.

OK, most of the time.    All right, full disclosure here.  I keep my hands to myself all the time, with these 2 exceptions...    1--When I'm playing deck hockey...I'm a goalie, and the crease is my turf.  If you're old enough to remember Billy Smith of the Islanders, and Tom Barrasso (of several teams, most notably the Penguins), then you know what happens to any unfortunate soul who ventures into my crease...and I do like to "push the envelope."    2--When Angelface and I are alone.

You may find it more hilarious than watching clowns perform or may find yourself gouging your eyes out.  Who knows as it is up the the seer's perception of beauty.  If it were me?  I most likely gouge my eyes out every time I see myself nude, but the DMV has issues with blind people driving!|`|mSt1LGfjaa	it have to be a lot,,i am to shy..besides my hubby wouldn't let me,,its not worth the money to get a divorce over that,,lol..

Klb4ZYcVaa	Never saw it, think it's about a mother who lost her son, & relies on the police to find him. When they do, she realizes it's not her child. Well, that's all i know, haha.|`|GOj7KdfWaa	Inspired by actual events that occurred in 1920s-era Los Angeles, Clint Eastwood's "Changeling" tells the story of a woman driven to confront a corrupted LAPD after her abducted son is retrieved and she begins to suspect that the boy returned to her is not the same boy she gave birth to. The year was 1928, and the setting a working-class suburb of Los Angeles. As Christine (Angelina Jolie) said goodbye to her son, Walter, and departed for work, she never anticipated that this was the day her life would be forever changed. Upon returning home, Christine was distressed to discover that Walter was nowhere to be found. Over the course of the following months, the desperate mother would launch a search that would ultimately prove fruitless. Yet just when it seemed that all hope was lost, a nine-year-old boy claiming to be Christine's son seemed to appear out of thin air. Overcome with emotions and uncertain how to face the authorities or the press, Christine invites the child to stay in her home despite knowing without a doubt that he is not her son. As much as Christine would like to accept the fact that her son has been returned to her, she cannot accept the injustice being pushed upon her and continues to challenge the Prohibition-era Los Angeles police force at every turn. As a result, Christine is slandered by the powers that be, and painted as an unfit mother. In this town, a woman who challenges the system is putting her life on the line, and as the situation grows desperate, the only person willing to aid her in her search is benevolent local activist Reverend Briegleb...

zRmwEFAwaa	Yes, Here, in the 2000's, me liking The Beatles is politically incorrect. If I were to be born in the 60's (beatles era!!) I would be able to talk to hundreds of people about the Beatles.. Not a Mile or Jonas lover in sight! But, I guess it's better here, because I am known as a Beatles lover, and acknowledge as an individual!|`|2mU1bbAZaa	I do feel as if I was born in the wrong era but not because of the music I listen to. I love the 1900's or late 1800's I love how people talked to each other and neighbors were friends. People helped one another to survive. I love how ladies wore those dresses with hoops and how men respected them because they were ladies. (Dont get me wrong I love my jeans and t-shirts) . I am drawn to that era, when I rent a movie or put together a puzzle. Seeing those 1800 scenes made me love putting together puzzles as I imagined myself living in that era.   thanks for asking...didn't know I had all that in me.  : ]|`|8mr0Yy8Caa	ya.. i should have been born in the 50's so i could enjoy the 60's|`|PtACBQNgaa	yess!  i reallllllllly wanted to be a teen in the late 70s - 80s! (in the UK!!)    im a teen now :D|`|gvF5HldOaa	yeah the 90's blow for music but I do like the Beatles.....But then I would probably have dentures...hmmm its a toss up|`|BrKzZB2Vaa	no because...the way i dress.......anyone from befrore the 60's woulve thought i was just beyond creepy...or a Wich...and they wouldve tried to drown me or burn meh..................no im happy in the era im in!!|`|3GHXk05saa	Yes, I should have been my mother's sister instead of her daughter, I was born 40 years too late. Not just the music, but the whole era.|`|XNs9SSg8aa	I looooove 50's music. The lyrics are so simple and it's so upbeat.|`|aeiP74PLaa	ya i think a my gf should be at home not out with her friends or at college...or even working she is to be a mother first i think..|`|CZkOgzNiaa	Oh, yeah....|`|YPA3YWDUaa	yes i do, im an old soul .|`|AhO0Uoppaa	nopes i was born and grew up listening to the best music, oasis, stone roses, britpop!|`|355e7824f276b6c691ef34823338dea3aa	i enjoy older stuff, i was born in the 80's but my school music was 90's stuff i reminisce on you tube looking up old tunes  long gone are my raving days- i was miss happy hardcore lol|`|HgRYP3cJaa	No, i think i should've been born in the future.|`|AA11370204	No, I listened to music of the 50s, 60s and 70s!|`|Kbgc6x5raa	um... nope|`|AA11530601	i used to - i used to wish I was 17 or 18 by the time 1990 came round so that I could have enjoyed acid house and gone to raves and free parties the 1st time round.. But I realised that I was wasting my life wishing for that, despite still loving the music, Think I have a tendancy towards nostalgia though,  but its not healthy if its all the time. was actually born in 85.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well yes.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgNWisEri...|`|nEZNf91saa	no|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Nope|`|hUYaaXBvaa	i like this era.  i like the 60s as a decade.  i thought it would be fun to live through the sixties, but the 70's were sure ugly and not that great music wise as much.   the 20's and 40's were amazing times in the history of our country and stylish as well, but if i was born then i'd be about 70 so i'd rather be born when i was.  i loved being a kid of the nineties, that was a fun era.  i listen to alot of music, my favorite musical decade being the 60s, and i even listen to music that is not in english.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Sometimes|`|ZKZxe1v5aa	i think id would have been cool if i was born right after WWII, so i could live through the 50's|`|2wpPrmibaa	youre right i like things before i was born|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	Yes.

Whoo hoo!!!|`|XP36zr63aa	yeahh i was born on 1992 but i love oldies/soft rock/80's|`|dd6rgtL7aa	Nah...my interests just transcend the times! If I weren't born in the 80's, I wouldnt have the same appreciation for 70's classic rock and 60's mod house decor. People are never happy with what they've got. So, I figure if I were born then, I wouldn't think its cool anyway....|`|320b2762f5cd39e51c805fc8b1bb91bbaa	BORN IN THE 70.. I LOVE THE 70  AND 80 MUSIC|`|4r0Cyih5aa	I've been alive for a few of them.

I should just be coming into being now!!    Nothing to do with the music mate.  The genius of Bach endures...|`|Mx11gL67aa	YES.  I listen to The Beatles, mostly.  I'd give anything to be born in the 1950-ish so I could be a teenager during that time.   I'd be a hippie, I just know it.  My grandparents were actually hippies, haha|`|0P5qBxiZaa	yeah sometimes:]|`|b6jt2eOtaa	same here.|`|RzhbINzeaa	I'm like that too...  I like old school rap and 80's clothes.|`|oVRA1ze2aa	nope.I was born in the right one the 70's .|`|oP8blO9Paa	I feel like i was posed to be a teenager in the 1970s|`|QBFjMRfuaa	yea 91 so boring|`|GB858dS0aa	me too.|`|YP2xuZdtaa	Nope|`|cPbrL1WGaa	yes i f*cking hate rap and hip hop..      i was meant to live through the 70s and 80s|`|NXrYtxFmaa	oh my god.....No.|`|jMOhEUjaaa	actually i enjoy all kinds of music.   what era would I be put in?|`|3Y6xb4YCaa	i enjoy music full stop   and for those who like rap it aint music|`|UVViEAkTaa	most definitely.  i wish i could of been alive during the sixties/eighties.     :(|`|XuXl7MFoaa	NO|`|vVZLY82Iaa	Yea I get that feeling all the time|`|Jh83QYVjaa	um.... nah, i think im pretty good with that    i feel like i was born in the wrong country though... *sigh*|`|yGQgdYNwaa	Nope! I was born in the late 70's, but grew up and had fond memories in the 80's and 90's when music was best. I love old school R+B from the 90's. Easy Listening music from the 70's and rock and roll from the 80's. The 70's ,80's and 90's had the best music, so I absolutely grew up the best era ever! ;)|`|ajwG9s7paa	I do.  I hardly ever listen to anything but what my dad listens to. Steve Miller, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, The Doors, The Allman Brothers..I could go on and on. I feel like a flower child, and I was born in '89.|`|zi06yiu1aa	i enjoyed the 90's. i wanna go back to spice girls, backstreet boys, young britney spears, and nsync. |`|YVNsRhAkaa	ya..im always wishing i lived like in the 1400's and stuff....it just seems so much cooler|`|vED4iORiaa	Yea i love old music...but then i remember how much i love my computer...|`|4U459LXpaa	Nope.|`|Ed2DGWkeaa	i love 80's hip hop and i was born in 85 but way too young to even be involved..... i wish i coulda seen it all. now i just read about it or hear about it... lame...|`|Jm6mkvlWaa	Yes. But not just because of music. Fashion, politics, beliefs.... I think I could have thrived a lot better if I grew up anywhere between 1950-1975.|`|QKOavFEwaa	Occasionallyly, i think it would be nice to live in the 20's or 30's but i feel that you wanna live with what your adjusted to.|`|lpeOwnGRaa	I feel like I was born into the right era!     But I also feel like I would've done well living in the 40's too (in the U.S., that is). It's just because people tended to be more conservative back then. :/|`|ZuEbNOUeaa	Yes. I have an appreication for classical music.|`|aPaPlEiCaa	i wish i was born in the 80's :(|`|AA12257580	I wish I could've been born in 1950 (as opposed to 1990) so I could've been a teenager during The Beatles' era.|`|csEcVPBYaa	I like the music now but thats just me, it'd just be weird if i  was born in the wrong era lol|`|VsamHLPOaa	As far as music, no I like most of the music that's out. But as for mannerism and clothes yes. Like how guys would court a girl not just try to hook-up with her.

Mais non, tu doit appris un peut d'un autre langue dans l'cole. Comme moi, j'appris le fran?ais dpuis que j'avias 6 ans. Je suis certain que tu n'est pas seriouse.     Yeah, that's my sad french speaking (mind you, i didn't edit that, and I'm not very good at french)    In translation..  Really? Then what did you do in school? No, you must have had to learn some of another language in school. Like I've been learning french since I was 6. I'm sure you're not serious.|`|OezPz0ymaa	I learned something as well!|`|yIdwMPsoaa	Wow you must be joking.|`|INf502UUaa	I hope you're being sarcastic.|`|E98jJXzKaa	wow, who would have thought someone could be so stupid, and still have BFF at 20yrs. old????|`|WK7Ynx9kaa	I met a girl speaking that Spanish thing once.

u7vrul2Faa	Sometimes security guards seem to follow me about in shops, I hate it. My brothers always get treated like crooks just because they wear casual jeans and trainers, have shaven hair and carry rucksacks on their backs (they are both cyclists). People   wrongly assume that all people that wear hoodies or tracksuits are up to no good.|`|W3gpfzj2aa	i don't think it's because of skin color I think it's because people steal stuff and the workers sometimes don't notice it. So they want to be careful.|`|bBHlGs5waa	Yes, it does.|`|y6406A92aa	Yeah, all the time..that's why I don't go to stores anymore..|`|AA12201622	It happens to me to, Skin color has nothing to do with it,|`|Z5eaybI0aa	IT does bother me. it has happened to me before. i could be dressed nicely and still get followed.im sure they are thinking that  i probably dont have the type of money to buy their product so i must be stealing. IDIOTS they dont know how much money they are really losing. AND YES!!, they do follow because of color|`|D13h2HVSaa	Never happens to me.|`|Pf1oo36Xaa	stop wearing the balaclava then|`|b2F8e4R3aa	That has to be annoying. Never happens to me though.|`|XhzFcN7Kaa	No that's only happened like once to me. But what is your ethnicity?  Like you said, maybe that's why. I hate people like that.|`|92n42vksaa	It does when they stare at me in a hostile manner, so I turn round and walk out again, so in their heads that probably proves me to be a thief. But the reason I walk out without buying anything is because I think they're rude. Anyway, have you experienced being followed round the supermarket then?! This happens to some people everytime they go in (based on what they look like??). So we have it easy just being stared at.|`|Z4VGYaUWaa	I've traveled all around the states and I can honestly say I think it has to do with the area you are in. Some store people will treat you like that if its an old school, narrow minded prejudice type area for instance I encountered that a lot in MS. I am a 27 white female. But now I live in Las Vegas and eveyone is nicer here. I think its because here anyone..man woman or child could be a millionaire so they don't judge as much...here they never know when they will get the tip of a lifetime.  Out west they are also very open minded and it is more accepted here to express yourself. The most sad thing in life is that people judge way too much!
uuK5lYsjaa	Pine tree, but it has to smell like actual pine that you'd smell while walking in the woods, none of that pseudo-pine shite.  Either that or orange peel mmm|`|vVLwrzGbaa	NONE!  Ive had some BAD experience with air freshener....  Dont ask.

But not on the face.|`|uKpi4I5Oaa	ew...don't every do that!|`|REugdDwdaa	I think it's a pretty bad idea. You shouldn't get one.|`|KFpEaY3raa	Love tats and have many myself.. not a fan of putting them on face or privates.|`|dkEUJPhnaa	No... because if it goes wrong and you don't like it then everyone will be able to see it.|`|G1lSbvAQaa	Mitch, DON'T DO IT!  Tattoos are soo awesome, but not on ur face!! Think 20 years from now.  Eff it, think about now!!  Don't put a tattoo on your face.  Tattoos are for your body.  Not your face.   D=  no, okay?|`|lVxhiMopaa	Eh I would never get it, Some people can pull it off, Some can't.  It would take a hell of a person to pull of a tattoo on the face though.|`|yD152y92aa	Just awful.|`|gIitANOkaa	uh...?|`|oWHplAzwaa	I think it is a bad idea.|`|YOGPspsgaa	I think it would look kinda dumb.|`|JD3yWKNGaa	Yeah, that's just gross. Anywhere else is ok, but not the face.|`|xreWOKBYaa	Love tattoos, but not on the face.|`|hHElzTSJaa	no no no no no no bad idea|`|NmrzCrSJaa	if you dont like them dont   get them geniuses..|`|LMJVHOWLaa	there definately not for your prettyboy face...|`|ijCLcCl6aa	no no no no no no no no no dont do it blegh not on your face|`|7SHsRWjoaa	No, way......Under your foot would be pretty cool =)|`|tnCGV1XGaa	well i'm all for tattoos, i have two of them myself. but don't you think facial tattoos are a bit far? i mean i'm not stopping you whatever floats your boat. but one: don't you think it would hurt just a little bit, and two: it would be really hard for you to get a job, most jobs won't even hire you if there is a tattoo showing on your arm, you would have to wear like a mask to work. what were you planning on getting?|`|AA10690306	Before you do look at your grandmother if you are a girl or grandfather if you are a boy and ask your self how they would look with the tattoo you want.  Because when you get old that is what you will look like.  If you like what it will look like in 50 years go right ahead.|`|MZB5dDYPaa	tattoos..... on your face... they're regrettable|`|SqPVrEaCaa	i disaprove of tattoos on ANY part of the body   they are disgusting|`|b9MbC3Uraa	Hate them! What happens when you get old and wrinkly?  Your face could get infected! It would ruin your beautiful face!:(  I know this has nothing to do with this but, have you seen older people with a fat, giggly neck? Lol, when They have tattoo's it makes it look like it's all wrinkly and dancing. Any who, don't get one you'll hate it!   P.S I really do think your face is beautiful.^_^|`|miTmZrH1aa	Don't do it!!|`|K6KIfZb7aa	uhhhh makes me barf blahhhhhhhh|`|CEwV9Kf2aa	Disturbing.    I like tatts and have a few myself.    But facial tattoos are just scary.|`|y02eBH2waa	I personally think tattoos in general are HOT. But on your face, I guess it depends on what you're getting. (:|`|ASsciJ4Faa	don't like it|`|ZWp23ujeaa	Big commitment!|`|5LWq12epaa	I HATE THEM!|`|AA10572359	I personally wouldnt do it. The only time that I would  even consider doing it is if I was a millionaire and   didnt need to worry about what society thought of me  because id have so much money it wouldnt even matter!  Otherwise if your just a regular guy considering to do this  I wouldnt suggest it because it will definatly hold back   certain opportunities!|`|1eiPSIydaa	No matter how much someone may want one at the time  - they can never predict what they'll feel about it in the future.  It's best to leave it rather than make a massive mistake.|`|OezPz0ymaa	I do not mind them but I would not get one.|`|eiEdUWNbaa	Bad call.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	No way. It ruins all your chances of getting a good job and people taking you seriously.    I like other tattoos though. Ones you can cover up.|`|6uga0JvQaa	Ok....as long as you can live with having it on your face for the rest of your life.
wSYhEREjaa	awww that's cute, i guess they like them some beyonce, lol    ?|`|qsuYKa3naa	Because he is a cutey, patootey|`|AA12348190	I do that too!|`|gipfVShsaa	Because it is a dumb video with poor choreography, and very unflattering clothing.|`|r8s5j6zOaa	that's cute but I turn it off|`|ijpU8jSCaa	he likes vag .|`|4oQs4lJ3aa	AW! Thats so cute! I gues it's just an awesome song and you have a happy baby!    Its normal. My 58 year old dad does the same thing!
MSEyXHFWaa	Each bathroom is tailored to meet that gender's fecal needs. Your bathroom should be chosen by what set of genitals you have.    Guys can pee standing up, so they get urinals.  Girls can't so they get stalls.    If, gonadically speaking, you are a man, you go to the man's room.    That said, I think that there should be some leeway for "men" who look like women and vice versa. They should be able to use the opposite gender's room just because it would be weird trying to explain why a "woman" was in the men's room. It would be kind of awkward.  "No, no, no. You see, I'm actually a MAN"  *shows manhood*    The bathroom is a private place. No one sees any genitailia (at least I haven't. Maybe I'm not trying hard enough?) so people with the opposite gender's privates, but their own gender's looks should go the restroom that people would think they would go to. Just to avoid confusion.     I don't feel like anyone's watching in the bathroom.    This issue could get a lot more complicated if it were a locker-room, though.    @Holy Crap!  You can't delete someone else's answer; only your own question. They deleted it themselves or were reported for misuse. Denizenofevil didn't have any say in the matter.|`|AA12201622	Yes if that person got the sex change but If he still has his man hood   Then no way in Should he be allowed in the Woman's room.|`|PyDH3aHgaa	I never use public bathrooms. They are almost as smelly as my feet.|`|MDYZIgwCaa	1. Do you think they should be able to use the women's bathroom?  Yes.    2. What if they didn't have a sex change but they consider themselves female?  No. Physically, they are still the gender that they were born under.|`|bmo2aGbdaa	And where do you propose that we go when we need to use a restroom and we are out in public?    I am MtF, currently living part time as a female.  This one is a no-brainer, I use the facilities for the gender that I am presenting as.  If I am presenting as female and go into the men's room, it is humiliating and I am risking my safety.  Men have been known to react violently when they realize that a transsexual person is in their midst.    As Paula stated, people go into the restroom to use the toilet, wash hands, maybe check them self in the mirror, and leave.  I have never had a problem using the women's room when I am out in public as a female.    Being transsexual is not about the clothes, is not about the makeup, and is not about sexual arousal or pleasure.  Being transsexual is about gender identity.  It is about who that person looking back at me from the mirror is. It is about being treated as a member of the gender that I identify as.|`|DdWhSod3aa	Trans people should be able to go into the bathroom of their target gender.......no questions asked.|`|NZO3Nr0Baa	That is a weird question.... I would say no...|`|JsYoVxckaa	I would tell them not to use a public bathroom...

In fact, it is an unfair assessment to even call this a horror movie. Maybe psychological thriller or drama would be more appropriate. There is some gore, but it's harsh, non stylized, unflinching violence. I have to admit that I was squirming a bit in a few of the torture sequences. The tooth pulling scene between the title character and non affection returning would be boyfriend, ranks right up there with Marathon Man. Only this time we are treated to every graphic detail. The sound design here made me cringe (in a good way). The performances, especially from Katiebird herself and Lee Perkins playing her father, are very strong. No over the top campy fun here. These are very thoughtful, tightly wound performances.  This was a very unconventional movie and i dig that. But I wish it had been presented in a slightly more conventional manner.    Either way, this is definitely a must see.

The fact that you don't think you have a problem means that you probably have a problem but can't admit it.   Freud would say that this condition started in your early childhood. Or not.
hs9Mibf5aa	Well I love the T.V. Show Survivor, so when I bought this, Survivor China was on at the time.

I moved to The U.S. about 3 years ago, excited to see if I really could speak with their accent. It turned out I was different enough with my own dialect that I didn't have to put on an accent anymore. I could talk normally and be different. I love having a differen't 'accent' (though it is really the Americans with an accent ^_~). Sometimes for fun I will slather on a French accent or German accent. Sometimes I even go British. I love different accents and I am constantly trying to broaden my speaking range. The only American accent I haven't been able to conquer is the Brooklyn accent.

f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	At one point - given as 1933 - Braddock reports a dream of dining at the Ritz with Mickey Rooney. Then only 13, Mickey Rooney was in the film business but not a name to recognize in Braddock's slum. He starred in a series of comedy shorts at the time, but going by the name of Mickey McGuire. Only from the late 1930s through the 1940s would Mickey Rooney become a top star and household name.    While the Braddocks were entering the fancy restaurant, the band was playing an ebullient version of Opus One. Opus One wasn't out until 1944.    The credits list Benny Goodman's version of "Don't Be That Way" as the song playing in the club when Braddock meets Baer. That version of the song was first performed/recorded several years later, in 1938, at Carnegie Hall.    At the end of the final fight scene, when Braddock is celebrating with his corner, one of his trainers, the man who Braddock kisses on top of his head, is wearing modern spectacles.    Braddock goes to Central Park in March, 1935 and walks through a Hooverville in search of his friend Mike Wilson. New York's primary Depression Hooverville in 1935 was located on 10th Avenue near the East River (as portrayed in MY MAN GODFREY). There was a small Hooverville in Central Park located in the drained reservoir, not on the grass as portrayed in the film. When adequate fill could be found for it, the homeless were evicted, and the area was transformed into the park's Great Lawn. Landscaping work was completed by April, 1933, so Central Park's Hooverville had been gone a full two years when Braddock visits it in CINDERELLA MAN.    In the dock yard working scene, a modern-day crane delivers the sacks that Braddock loads.    During the press conference before the Baer fight, one reporter identifies himself as being from the New York Herald. In fact, the paper had been known as the Herald Tribune since 1924, when the Herald and the Tribune merged.     Baer is shown wearing a robe with his name on the back. In reality, the robe that Baer wore to both of his title fits was a prop from the movie The Prizefighter and the Lady (1933). Baer played a character named "Steve Morgan", and that was the name on the back of the robe.    Opening scene is set in late November on East Coast, but despite undoubtedly chilly temperatures, characters sit outside on patio at night without coats; trees and grass are still green.    When Jim receives the $19 in assistance, the teller gives him two 2-dollar bills. The 2-dollar bill, as shown, was not minted until 1976 and thus was not in existence during the Great Depression.

It was 4 am and I was sound asleep. All of a sudden I feel myself being pushed up out of the bed. He kept saying to me that the things for the mirror are on top of the radio. I have no idea what the hell that was all about..lol.     He'll also just shout out random things during the night such as:  "Ugh! I should have ordered another cheese pizza!"    Oh, and a few weeks ago he took the lampshade off the lamp and placed it on the nightstand. There was no way he accidentally knocked it off because it's on of those that you really have to pull hard to get it to come off.|`|d23F89ECaa	I sleep talk allot.

I only sleep walk when I'm stressed out and really tired.  Once on a course I was taking, while again in the military, I got up, got dressed and walked to my car.  Woke up with the keys in my hand, sitting in the drivers seat.  Scared the hell out of me.

qXpxILnRaa	Everybody has their alter egos. But, I think that some people can influence on how you carry yourself. Though, I do not think Jay-Z is behind Sasha Fierce because Beyonce or "Sasha" has been performing before she even met Jay-Z. She came up with Sasha because she was and still kind of is a very shy person, but once you see her on the stage, its a whole different person "Sasha"!|`|0dc236d8b840bb8b7d2aed819c8a01c6aa	could be....but Beyonce has always been versatile which makes her a great artiste. She's got talent....Rihanna can't top that.

L6jKwlyXaa	This song seems to be about change hence, "it's all over now, baby blue".  I especially like his mention of the "vagabond who's rapping at your door, is standing in the clothes that you once wore." It suggests a change of status, and implies that you should never judge people for their status (vagabond), because at some point you may have been the same, or at some point in the future, you may be faced with the same status. Strong social message here too.

Now, there is no objective or durable "point" in anything. Entropy is the lord of all worlds, and it is eternally committed to inducing erosion in all things.    If you want a better answer, the best thing you could do is indulge in the history of philosophy, where myriad treatise have tackled and probed issues of metaphysics and teleology in order to solve this eternal riddle.     For convenience, you may find the Aristotelian assertion to be most pragmatic--a life of action and balance is a life of meaning: work hard, have healthy relationships, etc. Death has no bearing on action. Action will keep you from being bored. That's it-- "purpose" is whatever keeps you from being bored. We all die; we'll all be forgotten. What does it matter? Don't take life too seriously. Nothing is so important that is should consume you from the inside out. It's so silly how hard some exert themselves, always in expectation of some future destination, never enjoying the present moment. The flare of ambition is doomed to extinguish itself.    As Schopenhauer puts it (German philosopher 1788-1860): "Of how many men may it be said, 'Hope made a fool of him until he danced into the arms of death'.."     Some people are depressed by this--depressed that life doesn't have some epic, cosmic purpose where we are all heroes in our own way, involved in some Odyssey wherein our roles are orchestrated by destiny. Such is the result of grandiosity and self-delusion.     Take comfort in the simple things and you won't be disappointed

I would also make sure that you feel comfortable in what you are wearing, there is nothing worse then wearing an outfit which digs in somewhere or rides up etc.  Forget trying to look sexy because what is sexy to you might not be sexy to him. Definitely go for something classy though, always works with men, too tarty and you have lost him.  Next stop being nervous he knows you are a fan is so that should make things easier, if you are too nervous you will spoil your evening.

465cce724067d5007b625eca9d410563aa	Heyyy. You're totally right and I agree with you 100%..because that's how it is in my school too. I'm in the same situation as you also.     To answer your question, I'm actually not that sure. But maybe they do it because they are possibly jealous of your smartness.. and they kinda wish they were as smart as you. Or, they think your whole life is made up of school, no friends, no parties or anything fun ((which is definately NOT true)). But the real reason I think they do it is because the can't achieve as much as a super smart person ((like you and me and the rest of the smarrtieess)) can.     Don't forget, everybody is smart. But, the only thing that differentiates students is if they "want" to try. If you want to try and you do try, and you do your best, and you study for your own benefit, then you will achieve higher and be one of the "smart kids". If you don't, you'll follow the crowd and be a follower, not a leader.    Also, most of the people that would tease "smart kids" are the ones who don't act or try to be as smart as they can. They are the ones who don't try their best and don't care much about their education.    I'm glad theres other people out there who understand what it may feel like. It's really a stupid thing to make fun of "smart people" if you ask me. It's nonsense, just let them say what they want and know that you will be better off in the future.    Good Luck, and Cheeeeeeeeeeeers! =)|`|3005d3b9180d1ef915398a770d0e19f2aa	No, I agree with you.  I completely remember that feeling - that being smart was incompatible with being cool.  And I know it really doesn't help much, but just wait until your high school reunion - when you see what happened to many of the "cool" kids who did not get good grades and slacked off and what happened to the smart kids who studied and valued education.  I am not in any way saying that brains and social skills do not go hand in hand - those people are the best off.  Besides, I would much rather have a few true, good, honest friends over many social acquaintances.|`|9561bfcf1a05d328055061d4b26e8f40aa	Your school really sucks then , in my school being smart is cool .|`|y3KzYforaa	thats like in my school. it doesnt matter though even though im the smartest of all my best friends ive never gotten deans list. which doesnt bother me. besides, my grades are  s   l    i     p       p        i         n           g  but i dont really care for that either. well.|`|EEBofYFhaa	idk, but screw what they think u came to skool 2 get ur education and thats what ur going to do!!|`|3F8bCZ55aa	I believe it's called hatin'. But in the reality smart must be better cause everybody talks about dumb people.|`|JbRTKDFmaa	I had the same problem in high school.  I'm now 26, have a good paying job, and own my own home. I went back to my hometown to visit with friends a few weeks ago. On my way there I stopped for gas. One of the people who made fun of me the most was working there as a gas attendant. I know I shouldn't get pleasure out of someone elses misery, but to be perfectly honest there was some satisfaction there.|`|LDSL0DUiaa	Cuz people think smart people are "nerds"|`|14gi4aTvaa	Because these kind of people are immature retards. Forget that crap. Be successful in life and be smart in school, or be a dumbass in school and fail in life.|`|wSYhEREjaa	i've kinda noticed that too. But i can't put myself in your situation because I try my hardest and care about school but i think i really am stupid. I can't get an A in not even one class! It's really hard and i'm in the lowest level of classes. I try really hard but i just can't understand things in class like the other students can. Some people may just be jealous that your smarter than them. But I congratulate people and give them compliments when they get good grades but i don't hate them or make fun of them    ?|`|TQuSnnlVaa	idk   in my school the smart ones are the "cool" ones  we all, no matter what we are like, we get along (us smart ones and everyone else)  then again i live in a small town|`|Jos1uZ3Baa	Because they're jealous.|`|5IsOgX8jaa	Kids pick on others smarter than them because they are jealous.    Also, some smarties are annoying.|`|xLllDu18aa	lol mine is like that too. and idk why.   i agree with you ...is stupid.|`|mulc1go2aa	Cause then your considered a nerd & nerds are lame.  Its stupid to me.|`|4adEwhkZaa	The idea of highschool is to have fun and being smart is ofcouse not cool. There are more people that aren't on the honor roll thats cool and a normal highschool student. Nerds still have that label as nerdy and unsocailable. I think you should accept that nerd and make it cool. Prove others that your smart and when your smart your cool. You can say, I'm smart so what. You should not worry about those labels on you because they don't matter. Like you said, your smart and that's what matters. Your going to be that one who succeeds in the real world where being smart matters. Kids can be cruel. Be smart but you can still be a normal highschool student so show it to your other school students. Your not that nerdy person that wears overalls and large glasses. Your a normal highschool student that is smart.|`|AA12069415	That's how it is in my school too. I'm guessing some of the kids who don't do as well like to find excuses for why they don't do well. To make themselves feel better, they say, "Why would I want to be such an overachiever? How I'm doing's fine already" or "I don't even care. I just don't try."  If that's not enough (which is usually the case), they act condescendingly towards those that do well in order to make themselves feel superior. They probably think, "Why not make fun of them for their achievements before I get recognized badly for my inferior academic standing."
Bdgza4G2aa	Try origami activities, calligraphy, restaurant/sushi bar visits, and teaching some conversational Japanese.   Remember: if it is a Japanese club as well as an anime club, don't just focus solely on anime. Spread Japanese culture as well! After all, anime and manga are not the only interesting aspects of the culture.  That would be fun!|`|jQvC9xPuaa	that is totally adorable :D!!!  i think you guys should definitely bring beto boxes :D  also cosplaying sounds like alot of fun. for your first meeting you should give each other japanese names [make sure you know the meanings^^]    have fun :]|`|9rXXU2kdaa	in the anime club im in we basically wacth any anime the student brings in and sometimes the teacher lets us play some anime based games|`|7rzWFt91aa	do you read shojo beat? sometimes they suggest good do it yourself type stuff, my club liked making mini panda plushies, ad it was fairly cheap!  also we are kind thinking of doing like paper mache anime characters!  you should also check http://www.animecons.com/events/ this site to see if there are any anime/manga conventions you guys could attend as a group, it's really fun!  and there's always "bring a manga to share reading day"  or if you have access to a kitchen, you could do a cooking day  and field trips to places that are japanese (in my city we have a japanese garden and things like sushi shops and even a japanese grocery/bookstore, so check those types of things out)

I hate the Beta and my computer hates it too.|`|p03Jc7eHaa	classic|`|1hiImyBdaa	Yahoo Mail Classic.|`|crnjv96Faa	classic. i dont like the new one|`|YTQGKzuqaa	I prefer to use Yahoo Mail Beta :)|`|AA10026476	Classic  it's faster|`|QEqGukjZaa	Classic|`|mlGm0UDTaa	yeah i saw  that last  Question  I thought not  to get involved.   too much  "back and  forth" going on  It looked like a (Yahoo interpretation of "Chatting")  and  it  almost looked like the   answer  already  was  resolved but  I hope  all is  well  with your "Beta Mail"  I would   ask  yahoo directly about the  email of  your   choice and thanks  for   re posting I hope  your  experience was  solved    I use  both I like "classic" more|`|57elaG5faa	Yahoo Mail Classic|`|a2b8641f3900ff3887ba8bb3aa67fb65aa	*I'm kindda old fashioned !!  So ...... its classic for me !!~?|`|cdfab17577ad8962b270c540b0b46e98aa	I like classic|`|WGzb3Fhaaa	Yahoo Mail Beta, because it loads the mail faster, and is more convenient. You can look at the mail at the bottom while browsing it at the top, which makes it less work. While Yahoo Mail classic is good, it looks like Outdated and does not classify as a Web 2.0 product.|`|RiXZ4WRnaa	BETA!!! :DD::DD:|`|TMnJJgS8aa	Yahoo Mail Classic. =]|`|AA12069415	Beta, but that might be because I became used to it. Anyway, the thing I like most about Beta is that you can view your messages and your inbox all on one page.|`|Q3KnqbZ2aa	beta is better.  lol|`|LdzTP5VXaa	Classic! My computer doesn't like Beta lol|`|sYyNyjwuaa	Classic, beta blows.|`|OOyVDDDXaa	Yahoo Mail Beta|`|cxNLOPHNaa	I tried both. I like Classic best. The Beta version is slow to load. Also, when I try to type on the Beta version, sometimes I find that I'm typing two or three words ahead, of the words showing up on my screen. It's definitely not more convenient for me.|`|xBOQMqU0aa	YM beta|`|gwEubXRjaa	YM Beta....i feel more convenient...because there are more windows and one can simultaneously chat while sending or checking mails....|`|ybtOvNs7aa	Yahoo Mail Beta|`|boFXdcGxaa	I like Yahoo Beta only because I can chat and read mail at the same time... but I do think the interface is a little messy and a little intimidating for the first time user...     I still prefer Yahoo Mail Classic for its simple look and, hey, isn't the only purpose of Yahoo Mail originally was just to manage e-mails? So I'd still go for Yahoo Mai Classic.|`|89FgPZ9Waa	Yahoo Mail Beta|`|PRJfZAWBaa	I like the Classic one only.  The Beta version looks too messed up and the inbox window is also too small.  Y! mail classic is more spacious and looks good.|`|And9dyrwaa	i think we have to use y!mail beta becoz it was created to the younger generation so we're not a old person to choose y!classic,,we are youngsters so better use y!mail beta,,|`|DDCKVEyyaa	**sorry, but I go for the classic..  Beta's not for me..|`|I13rHn1Waa	i like the classic version more.... :-)|`|bDSfIbfXaa	Classic    Beta is just too slow!  :'[

AA11172871	Dawn of the Dead - I love horror movies with lot's of gore and this movie hits the spot.    National Lampoons Vacation - This movie makes me laugh everytime I see it.  I can never seem to get tired of it.    Memento - Amazing movie with an amazing editing concept.    Revolutionary Road - The acting in this movie was beyond amazing.    Pulp Fiction - I love Tarantino movies and this one was one of his bests.  Amazing dialogue.    Underworld - I love the idea of Vampires and Werewolves in the same movie and it  also had good action scenes.    Resident Evil - I thougt this was pretty good for a modern day zombie flick.      Office Space - So funny especially when they gang up and beat down a fax machine.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	can't begin to tell you...  ok ok. my most favorited genre is Drama. all kinds of it.     Scent of a Woman--playing a blind military man is hard, Al Pacino just killed it. Movie was incredible.    Rain Man, I Am Sam, Forrest Gump--what do they have in common? That's why i love these 3 movies.    Any Tom Hanks movie.     Any Philip Seymour Hoffman movie.    All comic book movies, except The Hulk. i loved Superman Returns, all Xmen movies, Spiderman movies, & of course, Batman.     For science fiction--all Lord of the Rings, The Matrix, all Star Wars, all Harry Potter.    Animated--all Disney films from the 90s, the old ones too like Pinocchio, Alice in Wonderland, Snow White, & Peter Pan. all Pixar movies, especially Toy Story which is why im in college right now.|`|lorq6MKmaa	Gran Torino was funny and sad at the same time. First movie to hit the spot...ever...|`|QkMyhHkaaa	One of my favorites has always been a movie called   Racing with the moon (1984)  It stars Sean Penn (which I have always liked as an actor) and of course Nicolas Cage. Elizabeth McGovern is also in the movie.  I hasn't been out for that many years on DVD but I did find it about two years ago. I don't think alot of people have seen it ...but it's worth it.

Which means if you stepped outside and called for Missy, she would hear you calling her from father away than if you called her Eva. =)|`|H9D4TR53aa	OMG! They're both so cute!!

The one paying is just getting a bargain.  Unless he was actually shopping around for a cheapr price.|`|YJAS7kbHaa	The girl.    And what does he plan to do with $5? Buy condoms?|`|qPIKmhzaaa	the girl|`|pl2SocVKaa	the girl who acepted|`|48f16lTJaa	Girl.|`|7fGgQ88Qaa	Obviously the girl.|`|oWHplAzwaa	The girl~she should know better!|`|vKCS3AVLaa	the girl should charge more, what is 5 dollars gonna get u?  LOL|`|vED4iORiaa	the girl...|`|URo3Ee4oaa	That's a really good question, hahahaha|`|cYFAo75Yaa	it wasn't 5... it was 5 and a pack of gum...|`|CkEFndJnaa	the girl who excepted the offer|`|BqO5xKLkaa	The girl. She could've told him to raise the price.  Cheap who*e.  lol|`|9Y1j0hY0aa	the girl.|`|mns5yLmRaa	The girl!!!|`|u1BX2aw0aa	The girl. The guy got a sweet deal man.|`|uttbqGB9aa	Well Both are "cheap" financially but none are actually cheap by means of degrading.    Everyone has their reasons for everything be it bad or good.    Its only bad or good by definition of the person who judges..|`|SqPVrEaCaa	girl|`|TT0rCi8kaa	You are, for finger pointing, and rabble rousing, with your fake indignation, and Judgemental attitude. Try walking a couple miles in someone else's shoes before you spout your false morality for everyone to hear. It just makes you look supershallow, and ignorant.    Hope this Helps|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	They are both pretty cheap.  The girl is giving up more.|`|f49NiNrdaa	definitely,the girl !!|`|CEwV9Kf2aa	I don't know, but I do know that treatment for AIDS isn't cheap.|`|jQ0KXt6Aaa	The girl.|`|BDaw3ORJaa	Neither has any value.|`|YoS8BWApaa	the girl|`|cgyTWMw1aa	the guy.  i just thought id be different and say that.    i mean, with the economy as it is today, the girls not THAT cheap anymore....|`|PQcelb2Oaa	the girl.    *yells*  CHEEPPPPPPP|`|14ZGrmZcaa	I think both are equal, the guy for spending 5 dollars, and the girl for free loading. haha|`|8tcTb0Ioaa	The girl... She must be a dumbass.|`|PfXuyIT1aa	I don't think there's a black and white answer for this one.Initially I would of said both are cheap in this little sordid deal but why would the girl sell herself for $5,is she starving,is sexual abuse all she knows? Is her self-esteem so low or non-existent that she subjects herself to this abuse? Is she forced to sell herself by a parent or sibling or pimp? What's his go? Does he engage in this kind of deal because he's sexually inadequate,socially inadequate,or just has no respect for women? Why does he have to buy it?|`|Vhq3GURQaa	don't know this story yet. I feel I can safely assume a girl sold herself for 5 bucks. She needed to get a Subway foot long|`|PpWosZsIaa	The Girl.. I Wouldn't touch her with a 100 mile pole.|`|zpRZjyAQaa	OOOOOOH  BIZ-ZURN  The girl, of course.  c'mon 5 bucks is SUPER cheap|`|yB3Jek85aa	the guy cause he sounds more creepy and  his wife is obviously is not giving it up so why blame the guy|`|lz26T6A6aa	Psssh, girl by far.|`|mggll8dRaa	The Girl, for sure....!!

fC5X8swbaa	Yeah its really cool, you should just color the letters in with really bright and noticeable colors like lime green, electric blue, bright orange, yellow, and maybe a hot pink? If it was the right shade of hot pink, not like a total Barbie girl color. Ugh. Lol. :)|`|WodlreGLaa	Thats cool :)|`|zpRZjyAQaa	s'ok...bring the "P" in a little closer and that would be a cool tattoo|`|INf502UUaa	Awesome!

Heres some advice!    First, Space the letters out a small bit. I would suggest using your pinky and spacing them out that far.    Second, color them in. Maybe fire since thats the font?     Anyways, keep it up! Keep us informed of your drawings if you get depressed of them.    ~~~~~~~~~~Edited~~~~~~~~~~~  I see your other drawings! Your  marvelous! You could sell those  on eBay! Try selling them in big 'lots'  if your really going to do it.|`|5NsgLFPRaa	It's okay    The question is do you like what I drew?    http://i352.photobucket.com/albums/r342/...    I HATE it!  it's crappy and gross  but It's the first drawing I drew after I was hit by a car and had major surgery on my right shoulder~  so I guess it isn't that bad?|`|cmlomNUxaa	Yeah sure, but it's so lifeless. Seriously you need too add color. It's good, i could never do that, but the letters scrunch up at the the C and last E.|`|FRijwKBDaa	Great linework but read up on some typography, your "P" and "C" look weird and your letterspacing is all funky|`|FrWhdRL1aa	It's pretty pimped out!|`|xUKLUSL5aa	yea its interesting.
uttbqGB9aa	To wake up and know that everyone out there is smiling, not just me.    To know that everyone has a good life and will never starve or go hungry.    To turn on the tv and not have to hear about peopler dying in a war, or killing each other, or hear about a child being molested or killed.    To know that when I have children they will be safe. To not be scared to send them to school.    I want to go to sleep and not have to dream, because being awake is far better than my dreams.    That's my dream life.|`|LF5z6JdRaa	Here is one part of my dream life:    Owning lots of nice cars:  1) Nissan GTR - starting @ 56k  2) Lamborghini Murcielago LP640  3) BMW M5 Touring|`|h8497njCaa	i want to be the prettiest surrounded by cool tecks...4 ex. hoverboards and closets that make u clothes u wish it 2 be and to hav my boy friend to be EDWARD CULLEN|`|lGSUToFQaa	i have it, i stay at home with the kids, and puppy|`|czHD5tPwaa	I'd live in California, In a reasonably big house that would make my neighbors jealous which would be along the coast, I'd be a (I don't know yet!!), I'd have a Lamborghini, and I'd have tons of friends.|`|mQgoqrC9aa	MY LIFE:   I would live in NYC with a husband or one of my friends, in a beautiful condo overlooking the Empire State Building.

AA11609168	No      I think a joint a day is better than 100mg of Zoloft a day    Pot doesnt kill anyone and its just as much of a 'gateway drug' as cigarettes and alcohol.      IMO---People just like looking down their noses at other people and the law allows them to feel like they have the right to look down on pot smokers.    I love how people like to claim that it ruins peoples lives....there are over 20 million pot smokers in the US - are all of them homeless and strung out trying to get the next bowl?  No.   They got to work everyday and contribute to society just like you and me|`|URo3Ee4oaa	Not one bit.. =)|`|eb38abe11698b46fde324034db87a709aa	Well, if my arm had gang green I would have to cut it off, so my answer is no.|`|3BX15PwBaa	only when its not used for medical reasons.|`|jAAWM3Kyaa	yes|`|5NsgLFPRaa	I've never smoked it  so I have no clue|`|szkrumAJaa	That's up to the individual.|`|zRlDQ9JJaa	kinda|`|eZCCSMykaa	no.|`|OCrkd2hCaa	No. People should be able to choose what they put in their bodies.

I find it so hypocritical that smoking weed is illegal and smoking "regular" cigarettes is not..|`|d67ULZQ6aa	No, I don't think its wrong to smoke weed. I believe that weed can lead to more serious things that I think are harmful, but not bad. Smoking weed gives you a good feeling, and gives you a good time. Theres nothing wrong with that, hell I would say weed is a whole hell of alot better than alcohol, no one smokes weed then goes out and beats there wife, unless they are just crazy to begin with. In my opinion theres nothing wrong with smoking weed. It's alot better for you then cigarettes, so I really don't know what the big fuss is about it anyway. Although, once you smoke weed for a long while you get immune to it, but still want a high, so you move on to bigger and better things, I think thats the only downfall. But like I've said, theres nothing wrong with weed. The only reason it's illegal is because the dumbass government hasn't found a way to tax it yet because it's so easy to make yourself.    MMFWCL!|`|6gMldg8Aaa	Only God Can Judge Me...i think ppl should b able 2 do wateva they want, as long as they dont harm others.

I think everyone should have to smoke it. Maybe then everyone would slow down and chill out|`|aqLDMy2Maa	no, it is better then alcohol.|`|BqO5xKLkaa	No, it's really not that bad.

He and his brothers' earlier song "ABC" or " I want you Back" took the no.1 spot from the Beatles "Let it Be" in the top 10 back in the 70's. Pop and modern music got revolutionized with his hits. He holds the Guinness for most successful artist. His superbowl performance got the highest ratings on TV for a half time show back in "93.  He established a lot of charities and foundations. He gives aid to seriously ill children. He brought the rights to the Beatle's songs, being the only person at that time willing and able to do it.|`|v73tKmLGaa	he was cited as one of the worlds most famous men  he performed at a super bowl    BUT..  according to wikipedia,  the only thing he was really famous for was his singing, for example, my favorite songs of his are thriller and beat it.

If you know anything about genetics, I'd compare it to dominant and recessive traits, depression being dominant, and happiness being recessive.  If I have any depression, then that's what I experience, even if there is some reason to be happy.  To actually have happiness to full extent, I must have next to no depression whatsoever, or else it will be overridden.  Yet oddly, I do have random bursts of euphoria, though they do not last very long, along with moments of extreme confidence, which is very strange for me.  Also, I often do feel apathetic.  Like I just don't have any emotion.  I tend to flip between this, depression, and random happy bursts.|`|yxVqJfZcaa	*sigh.. i do everything wrong..    i love you!! :D :D :D|`|S2uAq7i4aa	Almost always - happiness.

(:  i try to think of the good things in life instead  of the negative.|`|ixHwF4apaa	not on all the days. more days happiness persists and other days depression will be there. we should come out from these two things. should take things in a easier way. happy or sad should be treated equally|`|6y5wgdmHaa	Happyness, now that I have Selexa and my computer {and of course, my doggie}|`|chlGzFQlaa	I think I would classify myself as neither, I'm quite apathetic really. But if I had to pick one, I'm more happy than depressed, I'm never really down, but I'm just void of emotions most of the time, not exactly content, but not depressed either. To quote a fellow yahoo answers answerer: "Happiness is like that FedEx bus that comes around the corner. It comes, and it goes just as quickly."   I think happiness and depression are merely temporary states, however we can always be either content with the quality of our lives or quite the opposite.|`|VAVJlSykaa	sadly.... Depression|`|CEEQDSCFaa	depression, but i always try to be happier    i think theres always something to learn out of it, i think im deeper than anyone else i know, and i dont take things for granted    love your eyes :]|`|dQ99YWeoaa	Happiness, most days. :)|`|ur68myedaa	happpppyyy :]

Steve|`|456d68efa2a1d62c7af67d47f76d8bf0aa	I like what you wrote because it's so true. I have never heard that phrase though. You cannot fully appreciate what you have until you know how good you have it.  That is why so many people don't realise how much they liked/loved something until it's gone.  It applies to all things in life.  You cannot fully appreciate the value of money for instance unless you have been poor.  I think most of us would also appreciate things more if we experienced and saw the negatives - for instance how billions of people (third world countries) don't have very much in the world at all.    Another simple example would be when you are desperately wanting some water on a hot day or after a good workout - we appreciate it more.  Or when you are down with a flu/fever you realise how much you take being well for granted. =]|`|D3hLhqR7aa	That's true, I like that saying about stars :)

So yes.|`|7hrOjPwjaa	I wear glasses and contacts myself so it'd be a touch hypocritical of me to not date someone who wears them too.|`|AA11518036	Yes l would.|`|oKyimeaMaa	ya, glasses can make a girl look hot.......|`|ivlOxlG6aa	don't see y not    shouldn't judge people on something unimportant like glasses|`|NnMzREtNaa	Yeah but not if I was a girl dating Steve Urkel - now that'd be scary!|`|ba46a3ce2e28f5140e36ee11c824ec41aa	seeing as iam in my 30's thats not even an issue    and I wear them|`|Jy69Dn9Maa	Of course I acutally think glasses are kind of sexy, but people have different view on it.|`|kOo9KgZ5aa	yes|`|M8MlviOFaa	yes, its a bookworm girl fantasy|`|ebGBynujaa	yea y not?|`|aVbLngqmaa	definitely. I would never not date someone based on something that unimportant|`|URo3Ee4oaa	Glasses are cute if the guy can pull them off =)|`|FPnp2opzaa	in fact some people look nicer in glasses.. so y not|`|JV0i77uiaa	Why not, most people wear glasses.|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	of course!    i met this girl the other day with slim rectangular glasses with black frames and wearing a peacoat and a scarf.. and yeah.. she did it for me :)|`|6y5wgdmHaa	As long as they aren't the black Army "birth-control" style glasses!|`|qlcY8aKFaa	yeah!  I would.  Let me know when you get yours.|`|Vuj9VFdmaa	yes...if they were nice...and cute...and funny|`|4UXJoMbKaa	I wear glasses, so yeah :)|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	probably, its never been brought up though but i dont see why not since i wear them..|`|21f607e2a108c7e5f56649beeb4de243aa	I would...I agree with you, some guys with glasses look adorable. (I realize that's a word that guys don't want to be called, but it's so true). I don't care if a guy had glasses, I have glasses, and a couple of guy-friends who wear glasses. None of them are "unattractive" because of them, and I think that they actually look really cute with them on.|`|7XweQxIUaa	yeah, i would as long as they looked good in them, some ppl can pull them off and some can't    kudos to those who can, i dont think its easy|`|DJLz6o8Iaa	yes! why not!|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Yes.|`|F9UToz4aaa	Sure. I think its cute, I wear glasses myself. Plus, it'd be really rude and preppy to turn down a guy just because they wear glasses. How do you think they feel? I know I'd feel like crap. But, I'm glad that you would date a person for who they are.|`|ErHoyWvZaa	you with glasses ohh yes  most girls nope|`|8e6b9b58f8e85cdcf07dfe577a5b0edfaa	I don't discriminate when it comes to dating.  Yes, I would.|`|AA11749193	Sure- absolutely I would! For those who are 'too good' to date someone with glasses, must be pretty vain....Some people HAVE to wear glasses in order to see, after all. Some ppl buy frames just to look like they have to wear them.....    You'd look fine with glasses- You can always keep your contacts, also. Wear them once in a while. It's fun to switch around.    Good luck and take care!|`|8uIfskigaa	Wouldn't be a problem at all once I don't need a magnifying glass pmsl :)|`|Nngdk0izaa	I wear glasses! Besides, I don't really care if a guy wore glasses or not; what I really look for is a great personality or someone who shares the same interests as me. Neat question, though.|`|AA11196136	Sure|`|73455c6a787c90036b88c6c36738f763aa	Yeah! Definitely. Dating girls with glasses does not bother me at all!... :)|`|fKqH9k6Yaa	yes|`|aPaPlEiCaa	yes|`|AA11119892	Yes.|`|SRlzo5yXaa	i wouldn't.|`|W5ITQuqFaa	Sure,that way her eyes are protected from the spray..|`|vkeuaEHiaa	Guys with glasses are so hot. I'm not even joking. They remind me of Clark Kent with the Superman underneath lol|`|NGk5IrWWaa	its just glasses, how shallow are teh people you associate with lol|`|u603FdFsaa	Yeah, sure|`|UCGpCA9haa	heck yes!|`|27e8621704a7c55b0a61c68c284ec23eaa	i had contacts for over 20 years and then started wearing glasses over the last couple of years.  i wear them, and yes, i'd date someone who wore them as well.|`|1MWPKTLoaa	i would if they were at least nice glasses|`|uAzToWC7aa	of curse, galsses are so in style nowadays|`|0a59340d21076bfa762517c79658d908aa	Some. The glasses have to look good on his face though.|`|3BhPab1Oaa	my gf has both glasses and contacts and i always tell her to wear her glasses i think they make her look adorable and if she goes out with me i insist on her wearing her glasses|`|76255ecc584cd1006f1116e750d7ba6eaa	I would. But then again,I wear glasses. lol|`|QQ65X3kNaa	sure why not|`|ZCT2mKmaaa	i wear glasses|`|OYITN4S2aa	Nope, I don't care. As long as the girl has a good personality and nice eyes.|`|1RzQ3lK8aa	It matters on what kind of glasses .....if theyre rainbow/grandma glasses then hell no!!!!!|`|AA10742567	I have dated someone with glasses.  No reason not to.|`|T8G0wOXQaa	Yes. Most people look good with their pair of glasses and especially for guys it makes them look handsome. (No homo) Also girls you too no reason to be ashamed glasses are a positive never a negative.|`|ttfTGmmeaa	yes because there many beautiful people who were glasses|`|0db5faa7f74addd4a881c564a626715eaa	I wear glasses and I'd sure as heck be mad if someone didn't want to date for because of it!    Get the glasses if you feel more comfortable that way. Try out different styles and find some that suit you well.    NO, they do not make you look nerdy (unless of course you get Steve Urkle style frames)!|`|2OHn6OA1aa	I really dig guys who look cute with glasses!|`|PZT4wyGoaa	Yes, why not?|`|FO2Dks2jaa	of course!  ...even that trevor guy who was the first one to respond to this question wears glasses and he looks good doing it in his picture!  so, most definately.|`|XnrQmi5Uaa	sure .. i wear glasses ..i'm short sighted so i only really need it for driving or things like that.|`|KEbn0z4uaa	i would date|`|9eouWphjaa	Honestly does it really matter? Its about who the person is not glasses|`|mZn41jJ4aa	yeah considering i have to wear glasses when i read or i am at school cause i have asigmatism and besides glasses don't mean anything at all.|`|EOptJgsEaa	I used to have a huge crush on a boy who had glasses & i really wanted to date him.So yea i would.|`|I2HgAwvsaa	yeah, some guys look really good with glasses.|`|azIA2rmRaa	If you need them, you need them.  For me, it's not a turn on, but not a turn off.  It can be pretty cute, though.|`|PzHplogSaa	I do wear eyeglasses and its okay. Definitely I will date someone who wear eye glasses, nothing wrong with that as long as he is nice and respectful. Why not?|`|OQF1HlwRaa	this is random.  glasses can enhance a person's look.|`|Ti476VHkaa	Yes. I would date them with or without glasses.|`|puWWIA9Uaa	suree why not?|`|2SNBvCOMaa	yes u shouldd|`|7yBnUyVgaa	yes that does not stop me...as long as im attracted to the girl... Some girls look hot in classes too|`|zE4WGYgfaa	Heckyess I would!|`|w4LKvr0daa	... uh, I wear glasses.      They're glasses. People need them. It's not like a pocket protector or something you can function without.|`|ZpQ9XrXJaa	Well it depends if they look good in them to you and not what your friends think and if they have a good personality|`|9Uoisz1laa	Absolutely. I find that adorable and cute. If you get the right ones.  There's no particular face shape for glasses anyone can wear them but you just have to make sure you get the right ones! That's the trick =]|`|slgYd4sEaa	i would date a girl with glasses|`|WW5Xp6ofaa	I don't care either way.  If I like a guy, glasses or not, I'm gonna date em!|`|lf4RDGDAaa	yah i wear glasses and a lot off ppl ask me out|`|3T8JwJoHaa	There are so many types of glasses nowadays, just choose the one that is right for you and will fit the shape of your face.  I also wear glasses and I'm round faced.  Just have confidence when you wear it and you'll be alright.|`|5snRxMS5aa	why wouldn't i???? yes yes yes i don't care if they have glasses i like boys lol|`|6mfKfmHBaa	Ya. Nothing is wrong with glasses. They r cool!|`|HdXLstebaa	I like nerdy guys..like,the onesi  know,the "smart" kids...Not the oens on the cartoons with the chest high pants,and the buck teeth and nanoying voices.    And some guys look sexy w/ glasses   lol  I just had to say that ;)|`|oIY2Dgafaa	i would date a guy who wears glasses.  and some guys really like it, for example in my case, i wear contacts most of the time but my boyfriend always tells me he likes it when i wear glasses.  and i have many friends who wear glasses and they have boyfriends.  i also know many guys with glasses who got girlfriends.  and trust me, glasses can make u look fabulous if you pick the right pair.|`|W1d1O6Yxaa	well does it matter? if you're pretty on the inside then it doesn't matter if you're ugly on the outside! but some people don't look at it like that so it all depends on finding the right person!|`|PfXuyIT1aa	I married someone with glasses, I don't see the glasses only the beautiful guy underneath!|`|jQKbodxZaa	yes i would|`|QevBVANtaa	I would. It doesn't matter to me.|`|3be771fea0839c0df754012804a57dedaa	Yes of course.

I bet|`|NZjnMKXAaa	I try, but then i'll end up drinking soda because we don't have any bottled water.    tap water where i live is gross|`|AA11518036	No  Drink soda, coffee and beer.|`|4zuTkXW2aa	No.  I have broadened my beverage horizons.|`|w1HbcbZuaa	nope i hate water   i drink soda and juice  but good job ur making a heathly choice unlike me i know its bad but idk|`|et9gdoDKaa	water and coffee =)|`|jeZmqhNcaa	Nope, but its my second favorite drink :)|`|mMcrqP6caa	everyone has been drinking water since they were young, you kinda can't live without it!|`|bTXDb5YIaa	nope|`|om0zcFigaa	Yeah. Most of the time.|`|qzfkEgKgaa	that or iced tea|`|WTf0caplaa	Me too.    I drink soda sometimes, but I always feel like crap afterwards.|`|6mXZKX7maa	yea|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	Pretty much.  I'lll have grape juice or something like that every once in a while, but I primarily drink water/soy milk.  I hate soda, gatorade...that kind of stuff, though orange soda is my favorite out of the bunch. Oh, and I like herbal tea and black tea sometimes, too, but that's pretty much water, too...|`|KhPJIyXhaa	No. In addition to water, I drink cocoa for breakfast, juice at lunch time, and sweet iced tea at dinner.|`|AA11369490	i drink a lot of water but i need it to be ice cold  i also drink iced tea, and sometimes coffee.  once in awhile i will have a coke|`|Id1ypViXaa	no,that and many other things|`|ZPOGg2FIaa	Lately, I only drink Propel water or Arizona iced tea.  But yeah, I love Propel. I drink a bottle a day. Haha.|`|juraRlbkaa	Nope|`|2vUOqAikaa	I do a majority of the time.

Thats all I drink.|`|V1bsgGP0aa	no, not as much H2O as i need. Coffee, way too much. I did stop the ETOH!|`|EgSjZByCaa	I can't drink water. Water tastes horrible and gives me a sore throat. Weird huh?|`|nDvrN6Qgaa	God, so personal a question here.  Well I guess a really honest answer is called for so here it is.  I never drink only water.  Truth is I can't stand plain water whether it comes from the tap or from an expensive bottle.  As a young soldier of my generation the plain water was almost undrinkable with all the chemicals the Army laced it with.  My Mom sent me a dozen envelopes of pre sweetened Kool Aid each week.  Ruined many a plastic canteen in my three years in Nam.  And then after I married it was ice tea all the way.  I drink from two to three quarts a day and you can always count on seeing a jug out on the porch brewing at any given time.  Of course I spice up the tea with an occasional beer.  Less monotonous that way.  Good luck to you and mix that water with something.

I stayed TC there too, until after the election. Since I was supporting the McCain side, I lost interest somewhat in politics...but i am slowly getting sucked into it again....  During the summer, some of the lovely ladies of P and S joined the election fight, generally on my side, so I returned the favour, and drifted into P and S.  Now most of my Answers are for P and S. It is much more pleasant here.  Like your fun questions, for instance, sweetheart!|`|IKCfT9tnaa	my first question was about an adult toy...needless to say that was several accounts ago...gotta love it!!|`|uirKZIylaa	when I've stumbled across other sections, I thought it was interesting.|`|3TTvqfbZaa	im addicted to your questions!|`|6eEkxZKZaa	i was trying to ask how to cure my constipation|`|sorb72tMaa	I ?ed It From The Get Go!|`|0Df8DrEfaa	i started in P&S 3 yrs ago and my first reaction was, Holy Sh*t, these people are crazy....and I've been here since|`|OxaonF5aaa	I came to yahoo answers when i needed some info on google.

When I first came across it I thought it was the dumbest of people congregating together to provide dumb answers for equally dumb questions...    I came across a lot of crap....

I was in the shower when I heard my daughter yelling "FIRE" I ran out of the shower, grabbed my daughter around her waist (she was 4) and carried her outside to our "meet me" spot.

P6D8VzqKaa	Bram Stoker's Dracula. Reason: Gary Oldman and pretty much all the actors are phenomenal.  It's a classic to me.    The Lost Boys was good too, one you should definitely watch.

The costumes were phat!|`|29d696b2b163821f5d4e2854064c4a2faa	Let The Right One In.

The frosting has stuff in it!"), though I like it okay.    I don't care who baked it, as long as it tastes good.|`|3mJiPveSaa	Never. Not a big fan of German Chocolate cake (don't like coconut frosting), but bring on the Red Velvet, Black Forest or Better Than Sex Chocolate cakes!!!    Baked with love.

URGnGp3naa	Wikipedia says its a unsigned artist named Kesha.. But Im convinced its Katy Perry for one it sounds like her, and secondly I saw somewhere flo ride ft. KAty but i cant remeber the song title.|`|I0G597aAaa	Google it :]
nvR4h7Q1aa	I'm like Boo.  I try and give an honest response, if just because I don't want to give a jerk response to someone who seriously asked a question and I don't like to encourage for people who ask stupid questions because I don't really see this as the place for that.  So I love to get thumbs up and best answers because it's a recognition for taking time to answer a question, and I don't understand why I get thumbs downs sometimes because I usually think of those for someone who is totally off the wall in rudeness or something when it's uncalled for.|`|xbISxnmfaa	Advice giver and to get points, I just want to get 20,000 points.|`|PpWosZsIaa	True Advise    Humorous    Smart Alec|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	A mix of all of them.|`|9GDBpl8Faa	I give good answers on every other category except for Polls and Surveys.|`|TuyFcb5qaa	true advice giver for the most part. :)|`|slHUNl58aa	That honestly depends on the question..is it serious or just seriously deranged. I usually base my answers on that.  helpful when needed, but twisted otherwise because I just can't help myself.|`|INf502UUaa	I have moods, I'm the true advice giver some moments or the obnoxious person.|`|YW1DXceqaa	i like giving a clever answer that makes people laugh...but also to get a lot of thumbs up|`|fSlCE0jBaa	i try my best to answer, but sometimes... i add a little sarcasm.|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	Mostly true advice giver, sometimes tincy bit jacka$$, mostly just want points.|`|F9UToz4aaa	I'm the depressing non conformist pessimist that always tries to help.|`|Ii7vzF65aa	I'm competitive. lol I do try to give good answers, but it's about the points too. .|`|EblQojpEaa	I'm all over the place. Im mostly perverted. But I do like to give a good and honest answer at times. I have answered a question or two with a question, I could care less about points or best answers(well since i got to level 2 cause level one really sucks and its really limited). I really just here for my own amusement, whether that includes serious or hilarious answers depends on my mood.|`|TiUkZEUiaa	if i know all out i give my best if not tough luck|`|qAfnWKQCaa	the obnoxious person that never answers the question... *****!|`|mRix9QKQaa	I love to help people whenever I can.

I do love getting best answer and points though. ?|`|2vUOqAikaa	A true advice giver. Though I do like the points.|`|lcj1AKt1aa	A true advice giver but also to get best answers. I hat it when someone is rude answering. I love my best answers for my country ' Barbados".|`|AA10916001	I try to be a serious answerer but sometimes the stupidity of the questions makes me a bit of a "B".....    I try to avoid giving actual advice and just give factual answers....I stay away from the areas that I call 'lonely hearts" and stick to the areas that are fun or need answers that have to do with facts I know.|`|7dedb1d505bc774b219a42c84ed2ca4caa	I give advice when I can    But if I see a silly question by these kids, I try my best not to say anything because the best policy is if we don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything    and believe me I had to refrain myself a lot each time I come here    especially the celebrities section|`|43JgLpkKaa	a little of each , depending on my mood and the question asked. i am a  .. grumpy but honest .. answerer !!|`|7y7t04Vsaa	I try to help people but mostly I am here for passing the time. I do not come here to upset anyone or be nasty though. But I won't keep it to myself if I think someone else is a asshole! There are a lot of people who need to go find something else to do instead of being nasty for kicks.|`|PIUzpnVkaa	i'm a lazy one. hence, i stick to p&s.|`|WyjRm10jaa	Human right..  fun,sentimental,sad,anger,smart & dumb Answers..|`|8jxoTBWIaa	I honestly try to give a really detailed helpful answer. I hate when people write stuff like "2 points for me!" Its only two points calm down.     I spend most of my time in Polls and Surveys, Beauty, Music, and Yahoo Answers. But Ive been almost everywhere on here =]     I dont care if im the first answerer or anything like that I just want to help out the person because thats the point. I especially like helping out my contacts.|`|ynVelZ6zaa	A mix of everything I guess, but right now I'm a tired and hungry Y/A answerer :(|`|KDrztUEpaa	a true advice giver.     I really appreciate yahoo answers because you can tell the complete truth and don't have to care since you will most likely never meet them|`|YxXBrRq4aa	i try to give advise to those i feel i can help, but i'm here to have fun. that is why i pretty much stay in p&s where i can be the smart a$$ i truly am.  i don't mean to offend people tho, like i said i'm here to hav fun.  also in p&s you can be funny without getting violated as easily.  like someone asked how much it would cost for a home in bora bora, i got a violation for answering mora, mora.  stupid huh?  i like getting points and best answer too, but i'm here to have fun.|`|SZPZ40QAaa	A jackass when I use a cartoon, when I have my real face on i'm nice as can be.|`|FzQBUSwVaa	ahahahahahahah  I don't know   XP|`|wY4PmhHFaa	a clown|`|et9gdoDKaa	a smarta** when i'm in P&S...but ask a serious question in education or something and i'll give you life-changing advice =)|`|0304a9315d03f03b7f77f4ea1ff12144aa	Sometimes true advice giver. Sometimes obnoxious, sarcastic guy. Depends on my mood.|`|SLZAF61daa	I'm a nice person but some people get annoyed at me because I manage to mention lotion in every answer.|`|AA12036375	I try to give good advice. I like to answer a lot of questions and try to help people a little if I can.|`|93l6zA0Haa	Just here killing time,  but I always answer honestly.|`|Fs5gfuWHaa	the obnoxious person that never answers the question|`|2XV8U9emaa	advice giver and try to get best answers at the same time.|`|SJDVqxyIaa	True advice giver but IM SO TEMPTED to obnoxious...    Just the other day someone asked if was okay to ask a girl if she had an STD ( a one night stand) before he has sex with them. Why would someone you just met in the moment tell you they have an STD?...  I was nice and told him to use a condom wether they yes or no.    But I wanted to say something else...|`|5fKnal6Haa	I m a true advice giver. I love being a Yahoo answerer. Its a lot fun. I answer many kinds of interesting questions and I love answering then asking because asking costs 5 points. But answering doesn't. It gives us points. So I prefer answering.|`|OeCZCIbzaa	i like to talk about my girlfriend all the time. i answer any question i can about her. she has a YA account too and looks at my answers. when i say sweet things about her it gets me brownie points. she will probabaly read this one to, lol. Love you Em!|`|yixKb0ocaa	I'm a total goof-ball, but I answer the questions in a humorous way=]  When it come to serious questions though, I answer seriously and intelligently

1vCoaf08aa	I'll name a few    Rock - John Fogerty and Bob Seger  Grunge - Layne Staley and Kurt Cobain  Punk - Glenn Danzig  Metal - James Hetfield|`|TuyFcb5qaa	Nirvana has that blend of what you're saying.... they r awesome!|`|aV4jyyl2aa	umm lemme think, theres tons of good bands,   all time low  paramore  all american rejects  finger elevan  for singers... kanye west...uuhh ..rihanna|`|aajzynKsaa	Johnny Rotten or Iggy Pop.|`|4z0Lo0qTaa	Flo Bots   paramore   falloutboy  30 seconds to mars .  Three days Grace.  My Chemical Romance   Panic at the Disco  AFI  Braking Benjerman   Flyleaf   Sick Puppies  Blink182    I think these bands are so far the best because they have what it takes to be singers and as we've all sceen the flo bots have made recient changes when it comes to music they inspired people all over , old young ect . to speak out for what they belive in . Music isn't about being afraid it gives you a sense of feeling , you can cry , laugh , sing , dance , music brings your emotions out . It brings out the best in people and sometimes it can bring out the worst in people . This is just my thought so don't fall back on what i said its just how i feel about music. =)|`|9hFexadLaa	Kurt Cobain|`|VJAYmZQIaa	Chris Cornell|`|yKYIgTvYaa	Bradley Nowell (RIP); Sublime|`|2BCOBBW3aa	Man... Sonny moore is so awesome. whether it was when he was in from first to last or as a solo singer he is amazing...    him or the lead singer of saosin, or the lead singer of chiodos? or Alexisonfire ... or My American Heart>    or aaron from underoath in The Almost.

The temperature was so high that day I couldn't sleep where I was camping beside the river. I was camping alone in a deserted campsite.

944e834948591e9af24fa28ac5ecb873aa	They say time heals all wounds & broken hearts  but It sometimes seems to take forever. My Uncle was killed in a truck accident 1yr 6mths ago. It seems impossible that it was that long ago. It feels just like yesterday. He was  like a Dad to me (he was my hero) I miss him more than I could say. It still hurts like some1 actually reached in my chest & pulled out my heart. I heard people use the phrase b4 but now know exactly what they meant  :(  I think about him every second my mind is not on a particular task. He's the 1st thing that comes to mind when I wake up & the last thinig I think of when going to sleep. It's so unfair. He was the funniest guy u could ever meet. He made every1 laugh. His nasty A** x-wife which he was "almost" finished divorcing moved in w/her boyfriend before he was even buried. She made us give her his car in exchange for the rights to his body to bury him w/his family. She even sued his employer (who was a wonderful guy!) for his last paycheck! Why do people like that get to stay around & he is gone? I'm sorry to write a book here but I don't talk alot about it & when I do I can't stop. Good luck w/u  :)|`|j6SUkE4Raa	by mending the pieces, trust me i was shattered once.............|`|379833cdc0fd6cb60406f36faec52d3aaa	sew it back together|`|XDfrSfrvaa	to go a cardiologist|`|dL4x119gaa	sex, weed, cigarettes, and booze|`|W28ALDEmaa	Ice Cream.

I have always said that you should regret what you did, not what you didn't do.

I guess it just depends on the lighting and everything.   Cameras are defiantly not more accurate than mirrors. I would say mirrors are way more. ;D|`|hB7no5bPaa	yeah i'm really photogenic :)    mirrors are more accurate in my opinion|`|f7Rf3JiHaa	I look better in real life, I take horrible pictures.|`|KITovxGvaa	It honestly depends on the lighting, the camera itself, whether or not I have manageable hair that day.  Usually I look good though (:|`|K0jBt9umaa	definitely in real life. i can look in the mirror and think i look good and take a picture right then and the pic looks like crap. a mirror is definitely more accurate. also in pictures the lighting and all that stuff has effects on how it turns out.|`|0a59340d21076bfa762517c79658d908aa	I look terrible in all pictures unless I take them myself.

I am exactly the same way. Everyone tells me how gorgeous I am...but I can't stand how I look in pics. My eyes always look weird and my nose looks huge and wide. You probably are a beautiful person. You have to learn to just accept things and move on and love life!!|`|yTIi4leQaa	Idk when ever i look in a mirror it cracks and i don't show up on cameras|`|8c38618f9b49a2489851db7951238de0aa	I hate camera's, and I hate pictures of myself. Some people say that I look good and I don't really believe that. Even if I did think so in one way or another I wouldn't boost about it, because I really don't like to have a big head about things like that.  I'd rather make the guy I like feel good, because I think he's super HOT! He may not think so but I do.|`|0gLec1VPaa	I'm pretty sure I look better in photos (laughs) Mostly because the fact that I have to do some picture-posing and stuff and they just photoshop my face into perfection. :0  But I'd have to admit, a mirror is more truthful and shows the real you. Besides, most of the time a camera shot is just terribly bad posing.|`|rtcubrgtaa	it all really depends on what kind of camera it is and the mega pixels. Usually, you would look better in real life. in my school, there are a lot of bright lights that make me look really crappy, but in other parts of the school i dont look bad. It just depends on what you look like tho. what i do is i just try to make me like myself in every way i look. If you think to yourself that you look pretty and awesome, then you will have better self esteem and who cares if people look at you and you "look bad"? Just live your life(:|`|ePYR5RpLaa	I look bad in pictures...So, better in real life.  I think mirrors are more accurate. :)|`|eW1poAp0aa	omg, it sounds like your kind-of full of yourself, lol.    but, yeah i think everyone thinks they look better in real life.

10905d3e6a69ab853493844937b33437aa	Although I have never personally used Fruity Loops, it is held in high regard for making techno and electronic dance music. Fruity Loops is free. Once you have the technology, the next step is to study techno songs and learn how they are structured. Techno and most dance music consists of 8, 16, and 32 bar phrases. An understanding of basic harmony, voice leading and music theory will also be very helpful. I would personally recommend the Dance Music Manual by Rick Snoman as it is quite comprehensive:  http://www.amazon.com/Dance-Music-Manual...|`|Ak9ialJmaa	You can download free programs here:  http://www.download.com/windows/mp3-audi...    ive downloaded a couple. I didnt have enough patience, so i just deleted them, But if you do, then you can figure out how to make beats and stuff. Just look for the programs that sound cool to you.    :)

I would be worried that switching to Vista would screw up my computer. I read something the other day about MS saying a bunch of computers were "Vista capable" even though they really weren't.|`|zkCH7PN5aa	I embarassingly say Vista. We have 2 GB ram now and it works a whole lot better than when it had one. Its a lot better looking visually and there are some small things that are really useful and that i like.    Yeah XP is more stable and probably better overall, when Vista works properly, i like it.    For your Vista machine, may i suggest downloading the windows 7 beta? Has to be done before the 10th and go to Cnet TV for how to install and do it all.     If you try it on your own you could loose everything. in cnet tv go to how to videos and insider secrets and quick tips and look at the videos for windows 7. I suggest dual boot with it.     And back up your files!    Windows 7 looks promising.|`|OegheALwaa	i dont really care as long as i can get on myspace and check my email.     but i have vista right now so i guess vista.|`|PwVrqyIGaa	Vista is better for security and you have the sidebar.

Mac's r da best!|`|JpQsD5gWaa	XP... Vista is crap. My laptop is compatible to both.|`|0db5faa7f74addd4a881c564a626715eaa	I use XP on my home PC's, but my sister's laptop runs on Vista and it's OKAY. It seems to be trying hard to incorporate cool gadgets and features, i.e. clock, notes, news scrolling at the side. I don't know-maybe I'm just saying that because I"ve used XP for so long. It has a good amount of features without trying to be a snazzy, trying too hard OS.     I do want to try Ubuntu however. But that's another story.

1fFn1UhEaa	A good friend of mine lives in one....      The trailer was $5000 and he pays something like $500 a month.    If i had to make a choice between an apartment and a park...i would pick the park.  He has no loud neighbors above him, can park right his car right as his place, a little yard thats his, has his own privacy somewhat, has a little shed where he can store is belongings and the rent is about half of what it would be to rent an apartment of the same size.      Apartments are a complete waste of money.  If he wants to fix up his place and make it look nice he can sell it and have cash in hand when he moves someplace else.  Versus an apartment of the same size where you pay $1000-1500mo. and when you leave you have nothing to show for it.  Just a wasted expense.  And people are always looking for low income living...aka: trailer/mobile parks.    just my two cents|`|FNwxcBPpaa	I live in a town of 500 people. We don't have a trailer park.|`|u8HczDCRaa	it cost about the same in georgia, but you cant pee out the back door of an apartment as easily.|`|V7EJdsF1aa	i heard round these part you can buy the land for 8000 in an actual trailer park and the trailer is about 3000. LOL i dont know y i know this!|`|fJPc6Iayaa	We don't have any trailer parks here. It's against zoning laws.

But what's MORE annoying is when people post their questions with "10 points best answer!"    Well, OBVIOUSLY if someone gets best answer, they'll get 10 points, no matter what you rate it.   Gah.|`|B8GOW6Nzaa	give me the best answer .  if you deserve it well then thats okay, but it sounds demanding sort of .|`|5CbddiWJaa	Thanks for the two points. i dunno why it just bugs me|`|Gznvci2baa	"Give me best answer"  'cos it's sort of like begging where as "thanks for the 2 pts" is a given as soon as you answer.|`|OXleDYVQaa	YES to both.    Another that annoys me is source: My Brain.    Dallas|`|AA11809775	Ohhh geez....  Well, they're both annoying and they're both greedy.  But "give me best answer" is greedier.

If anything, they should be offering him some more.  The way I see it, the U.S. NEEDS Michael Phelps, he shouldn't be saying sorry to them.  He's 20 something, it's normal.

I don't care if he wants to get high on his time or get crazy-drunk - he obviously didn't have his head on straight to allow paparazzi to actually take that controversial photo.

He's going to lose ad money though.|`|st2zmU88aa	i don't care...i see nothin wrong with it.    ain't nothin wrong with smokin weed.|`|t05KNjvraa	no the guy needs a vacation, he won like 8 gold medals and spends all his time in the water,  he probably just felt lke he need some time off|`|PzmLYUe6aa	who gives a f**k if he smokes weed or not!|`|AA11041009	I'll put it this way:     Mike, I'll smoke you out anytime, brah.  I got you.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	no not really.  The media is acting like he was smokin crack or shooting up herion.  I wonder who the scumbag, dirtbag, peice of s hit who released those pics is?  He is the 1 that should be shamed|`|LZKT6kGkaa	He can do whatever he likes...|`|9Y1j0hY0aa	no it like who cares, i hate how everyone is acting all shocked. that a single 23 yr old jock was caught somking pot at college dorm party. and it like get over it.  he gave his apology, or should i say "stonerish" apology?|`|miI17WJ5aa	i do not care if he smokes weed.   he should just keep it private, since he's a role model.|`|f7Rf3JiHaa	Nah, not really.

Ask me after that!   LOL...    In all honesty, I try not to think about that kind of thing.  I have a young family and prefer to concentrate on the here and now.  It's far more important to live in the moment than to live in fear of the future and all its possibilities.  I have learned this in the last year - and I find it far easier to trust in God - whatever happens, happens.|`|31CnwlwHaa	Isn't the world ending before that anyway?

I would have never thought Liam Neeson would be an effective action star, but his turn as the retired CIA (?) agent was brilliant.

Back in the good ol' days, I'd put Hurricane Smith's "Oh Babe, What Would You Say?" on the turntable for my now-ex-gf (or is that XGF?).  She'd get a gleam in her eye -- she only had one -- and say, "Oh babe, let's caulk,"  which was, I'm sure, what Mr. Smith had in mind.  We caulked in the kitchen, we caulked in the bathroom, we caulked in the porte-cochere, much to the amazement and, I often surmised, the envy of the neighbors.      A good caulking may make you woozy, but never a floozy.|`|YmrUXQBcaa	If you mean a whore, then yes. Nobody except old people call anybody a floozy. Get wid da program ******. You whore. And why did you stop caulking to ask this question? Get back to work. You're lazy too.|`|9IvcV7tiaa	that would depend on whose crack, i mean what crack you're caulking. i'm pretty sure it does.|`|lC5NLsZZaa	I think it gets a good rhythm going.

Latex or silicone|`|FkhFIIsjaa	Here in Catmandu, cats who are caught caulking can be catheterized and cauterized with a cathrode-ray caulking contraption or contained in a creepy cell for catapulting and caterwauling cantankerously.  It's very cut-throat.  *cries*|`|2iuZdBXraa	Like in caulksucker?|`|EbaA2lfwaa	Jesus, you're just asking me to eat you out.    *cries*|`|991409e2f8815e4e8a645dd82791db41aa	no way in hell..|`|4FHHuD0daa	That depends -- is it white caulk or black caulk?    ok, before I catch hell---> it was a skit on Crank Yankers where this guy called up a hardware store and asked what types of caulk they had, etc.. etc.|`|VSRyCQyVaa	No, it just means you're gonna have to clean the caulk out of your vertical smile.|`|oDGttkmLaa	I've never wanted you more than I want you right now.|`|dE5m2Krmaa	Did you know that I'm qualified to make a citizen's arrest?

eO4y3m1maa	Cops aren't a worry unless you like skateboarding in a shopping center at 3 am on a school night...    I used to sneak out all the time, such a rush!! Totally worth it, I finally got caught so my parents moved me to the bedroom next to them so it bacame a real hard to do it..but by then i didnt really need to sneak out anymore I started crashing at friends houses...or friends who had their own place. (I was 16/17 at this point)|`|rUMGPXqwaa	i used to do it all the time. like basically every night and i only got caught under 5 times. now i just leave cause i dont care anymore and im over 18 so it doesnt really matter    i just walked out my back door|`|F0q3gi5Gaa	just a couple times, its fun, just cause its something to do. We and my friend used to do it,|`|lMeoMz8Aaa	hahaha well.  my window has a fly screen on it so i cant jump out of it, plus we have a really niosy door.  so i waited till everyone was asleep and jumped out the bathroom window above the toilet. i nearly broke my ankle on the other side but it was alright!  then i went and met my friend and we just hung about close to home so it wasnt dangerous, just fun.  i did this last weekend actually.  dont worry its not difficult!

Now-a-days with all of the stereotypes, cliques, and just plain drama, it's hard to stay yourself without being considered anti-social, outcast, or just plain goofy. I've been picked on, pushed; i've had tongue's stuck out and me, and i've been teased (right in my face), and i've never gotten into one fight. Now people have decided to back off of me, and I have friends in just about every "clique" (and quite a lot of them too) and i have no enemies. (just some people i don't enjoy holding up a conversation with lol) but yea, that pretty much covers it...

Couldn't help it.  I had a thing for Teila.|`|Z2EzfQFvaa	Uh..I don't know about your list but I do remember tings like the Transformers..TMNT,He-Man and others.I also remember the good old video games,the good old tv shows and the good old music.Man it truly sucks for kids today.|`|raUjKchLaa	I watched the Flintstones and by that I mean New episodes not reruns.|`|w1HbcbZuaa	yess i miss the good old days|`|AA10460376	AAH MAN!....The Road Runner...Did you forget?..That was the best of them all!    OOPS!...I forgot BUGZ BUNNY!|`|KgTTX2Nyaa	Doug|`|gAOAdOHraa	The Flinstones or The Smurfs|`|PRDZmeiEaa	Yes I do....

dcMq7juHaa	A panel of Judges decided that Gerald (Little Milton) Bostock's mind was seriously unbalanced and that his work was a product of an "extremely unwholesome attitude towards life, his God and Country."    The real question is, has anyone seen a non-rabbit? One appears to be missing.|`|jUEoujN2aa	*looks to see if you're talking to the person behind me* idk, good i guess|`|Rs3ITS1Iaa	good day sir                I SAID GOOD DAY!|`|55G0BNCzaa	fantastic!|`|wgYMHW9Naa	EXCUSE ME????

I DO know what it's like to feel as though I'm TALKING to a brick wall, though.
HypqcnJaaa	No, but I would probably like sugarcoat it. Like if they were always calling themselves ugly I'd be like "Aww, don't say that you're not ugly. Don't be so rude to yourself." And if they were asking "Am I pretty", I'd be like "Well you have nice hair, eyes, etc" (pick one lol). :)|`|K4GiKOhPaa	True beauty exceeds mere physicality. I've know physically beautiful women who were among the ugliest people I've ever known. On the other hand, I've known many physically unappealing people who were among the most beautiful I've ever met.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well no.|`|9f3784bdf3bdc20b62d4d53dedacfdfeaa	no - i dont lie|`|6Uohf1h1aa	probably not..because there is always something beautiful about someone.|`|r8s5j6zOaa	no I am straight with them|`|HHe3lT1saa	sure|`|wEKfQdHfaa	i would like to syano. but i have|`|YxMh2aAOaa	yes   btw your good looking|`|hLnMkzpkaa	Yes      "Your good looking" there see i would do it|`|OIcn7keJaa	Everyone's different, who's to say who is good looking or not.|`|up363TZyaa	If they asked me, yes. i don't like hurting anyone's feelings.  if they didn't ask me, then i just wouldn't say anything.|`|PzbRJrTKaa	no, i just wouldn't say anything.'.!|`|3ME7sBxjaa	I guess if it was the end of the night, and I was getting desperate, and I was drunk enough.|`|2iuZdBXraa	You're pretty.|`|DekGIOImaa	Yes, pretty much. Everyone wants to be good looking. I can't just be rude and say, "you're butt ugly!!!|`|tA9xFG5oaa	depends on how well I know the person.|`|hKP5sQewaa	Yes, i don't like hurting peoples feelings. :]|`|FPnp2opzaa	no.. i will just answer average|`|zHwSyDNfaa	maybe|`|pbRW5YFGaa	yeah|`|jeZmqhNcaa	I would prolly find something good about them and compliment them on that|`|vED4iORiaa	nope|`|AA10653329	looks are a matter of opinion|`|vUypopU8aa	yes, why hurt someone  i mean if someone gives you a compliment you keep it forever  same goes to an insult|`|lue3QssOaa	yes|`|9gVPOsrhaa	depends..|`|rmAX5dteaa	Ya i would!|`|qzfkEgKgaa	depends|`|e5CCBZ2Raa	to make them feel good.|`|Gz6HNuOVaa	no|`|lIXxTXKgaa	yes because theres always something thats good on them|`|vLzLk4m0aa	to make sure to brighten their day...  or to make fun of them (if you are mean)  or maybe they thought they were looking good...|`|sWkrfbGOaa	nope.|`|6m2C1HuIaa	i wouldnt  im not mean im just honest|`|6bqL4BmCaa	Depends if someone has something in their teeth yeah i'm gonna tell them. If it's a bad outfit I just let them keep to their own style.|`|sJNoTGQVaa	no because then they go for you if they're ugly and you don't want to be mean so you're stuck in a sexual relationship with an ugly girl|`|3H0DSXfuaa	You are good looking.|`|11a1ca6e5344b05fcc0a1be08c886a49aa	its always best to b truthful unless its one of ur friends thats a girl then its ALWAYS yes.. ALWAYS lol|`|3XKUUf1paa	of course, you don't want to her their feelings... how would you feel if they said the same thing about you? If it's your best friend, then it's a different story.|`|7nRom97Daa	no|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	Yes.  What's the point of hurting someone's feelings, especially over something so subjective as beauty?|`|7yBnUyVgaa	well some people as and make it awkward and out of courtesy i have to say it, trying not to be rue.|`|r5Psh5Doaa	I would stay for example .. yeah you are good looking but your eyes are too big .. you know.|`|1uxhfh6naa	I tell that to everyone because everyone is beautiful.|`|5mIhU9KAaa	i wouldn't go out of my way to say it to a stranger. and i wouldn't say it to my friends out of the blue either. but if they asked me straight up if they are good looking when there not i would probably lie and say they are|`|puWWIA9Uaa	would you tell a friend a haircut looked nice when it didn't?  so that they get it aging?  i wouldn't :p|`|mDU2J8VKaa	If they were a friend, I would just not say anything unless they asked. Then I would say they were pretty. If it was my boyfriend or girlfriend, then I probably would. Now if they were my mortal enemy, I would tell them what I actually thought of them. So it all depends on how much you like the person. They say that love is blind. So if you really liked this person, you would think s/he is pretty/handsome.|`|q6ogfhnMaa	no, i would rather not say anything, than to have to lie to my friend, or anyone for that matter!IMO!|`|2KsZZMEAaa	sadly, yes|`|AA10289152	In fact good looking can be a disguise..so it may not real..but nothing wrong saying that to avoid confrontation..|`|vWRfEoGnaa	No. I would tell them the truth. I can't face lying to ANY of my friends.|`|0oqpgJAbaa	not if it is a hygeine problem  but dont put them down because you can|`|0utxr5C0aa	yeah.  unless they were a "biotch" and i didn't like them.  i wouldn't be like "YOU'RE SO PRETTY! I WISH I LOOKED LIKE YOU!"  but like if they asked if they looked like crap that day id be like "no you look fine"|`|DkwgogXZaa	of course...why hurt anyones feelings?|`|FUFD3MhQaa	Tell them their fat and ugly, but only if its true.|`|OezPz0ymaa	Everyone looks good.|`|UKtZS3Wraa	yea its good to make someone feel nice|`|EzrdyxAiaa	no way!!!|`|YrHuv1g3aa	id tell em that there ugly f**kers, and i wouldn't befriend an ugly person anyway|`|BKTx9IsZaa	Yes|`|De8z6qH4aa	Nah, ugly people can go hug another ugly person for some love, I tell them straight out what I think, or I don't say anything at all.    As long as they don't reproduce, I'm good.|`|p03Jc7eHaa	nope|`|B4y9w6Braa	I believe everyone is good looking. I don't believe in uggos. =]]]|`|8Zcu55Braa	yes , can't stand to hurt their feelings
Rzfn2pSqaa	no. i'd steal it and then go sit in a cave screaming "my precious." then return it to you saying "no i did not sit in a cave screaming 'my precious.'"|`|F54wr11Caa	Yes!|`|JP4u9EAoaa	why not|`|MVap2Zo0aa	yes.|`|hT02niDRaa	yes that be mean not to!|`|mEX2JUidaa	yeah|`|AXBKimG7aa	would take it and put it on, ohhhh yeah free scarf lol|`|5rb05H3xaa	YUP|`|oC1A7x6Oaa	hell ya if you were hot........ lo|`|N82omPDdaa	Only if you didn't turn out to be some random hallucination due to old age or dehydration.|`|PGMeHgwmaa	No my neck was cold anyway|`|OHo9fELLaa	definaly because i would want you to tell me|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Yes and I'd pick it up for you. Me giving you my phone number is purely optional.|`|2yRZSTF1aa	Yes i would tell you. I would probably pick it up and say some corny line like "you made me drop my jaw to" just to try to make you laugh. Then I would babble about myself trying to impress you but ask what you like to try to seem interested and then if were compatible I'd ask you out on the spot.....is that indepth enough for you?|`|ur68myedaa	unless it was ugly then i would do u a favor by hideing it. jk jk yes i would give it back|`|PfXuyIT1aa	I'd pick it up and give it to you!|`|97eFBAS7aa	yeah even if u dropped 20 dollars I'd tell u even if I didn't know u I would tell u|`|VczgQUETaa	yes, that'd be rude not to!|`|QmWzBERjaa	Mhmm I sure would.|`|UpvzJGAYaa	totally. unless it was a pretty scarf that i wanted i might keep it.|`|WGKvm8xxaa	yes|`|U0XK6v2Jaa	um... yes?    is this a trick question?|`|AA12237215	Yes,And,I would pick it up and hand  it back to you.....ok?|`|H9iKvwM6aa	yupp :)|`|w6tQEuKCaa	yeh..if i like you|`|mdHfNKcTaa	if I liked you ...|`|FXe5Lv9eaa	I would unless you seemed rude.|`|c7yGxJgQaa	yep|`|RAiBtbMLaa	haha.. you know it!! :p|`|028xaZCeaa	absolutely not, i love a good scarf and i want to have to all to myself!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Uq9qPZ75aa	Keep it, and use it during happy hour.|`|44fe68ac48e4256fe9ab6ffbd1ee8375aa	I would make a lasso out of it and capture you and reel you in to make you notice.|`|oJTxk2cDaa	I would pick it up and say, I think you dropped this scarf.|`|OgpQdem2aa	No, i would probably steal it, sell it on ebay, and whatever profit i make i would buy a sandwhich with it.  =D|`|967a4775c02dc2dd40b45608b213d540aa	yeah.  why not?|`|kb6rLhzPaa	I definitely would, I hate it when I get home and realize I've lost something I left the house with.|`|vj2pOgT7aa	Sure.    =0)|`|t7yXHMnAaa	omg yes! who wouldn't????? .....unless it was a nice scarf...... no i'm just messing i'd feel bad.|`|b5V9CnVuaa	yes!deff.yuu need yuur scarf!:]|`|eipShf2Paa	Yes, i would pick it up and catch up to you and hand over to you.......|`|8k05aNSMaa	if i hated you, no, id give it to the nastiest person i knew. other than that, sure.|`|SsGLm3Xvaa	Yeah, I probably would.

I know that sounds cliche, but it is so rare to find someone who isn't out there purely trying to show off or fit in with the herd mentality or just acting like a complete faker and charlatan to try and get something they want.    I've only met a few people in my life who have been completely open and honest about themselves and their opinions.

I work with someone who will greet you with a big "Hi!" and smile.  Most of what he says seems to require an exclamation point.  And it's not the whole, "You don't have to be enthusiastic, you just have to act it".  He's actually happy to see you and help you out.    I know the question say one thing, but here's another: a genuine smile.  On a college campus, or anywhere there's a lot of interaction, a lot of people give that generic "I see you, I'm acknowledging" smile.

Most people have a core of 1-3 BEST friends (known since kids, could tell everything to, tell that you love).    After that they tend to have 3-5 good friends.    Anything after that is kinda gravy, possibly another group of 3-7 just friends, then a few dozen orbiters.    You could call the 'just friends' or 'orbiters' fake friends.

The crud of it was that I wasn't skipping, I was at the orthodontist getting braces put on. The dill-hole assistant principal didn't believe me, even when I showed him my bleeding gums and the note from my mother. Turned out that almost all of my class skipped that day and went to the lake to get drunk. The next day he got a not so pleasant visit from my mother. He left that meeting missing about 20 pounds of butt. Don't mess with the kids of a B.A.M.!!! In case you've never heard that term before it stands for Broad Assed Marine...and they have the attitude to go with it.   By the way, I was back in school that day...with an apology from the dill-hole.          Oh, you meant suspended from here on YA! didn't you?  No, I never have been. I've had questions and answers deleted for violating community standards. But haven't been suspended.|`|HIMwyeZqaa	5.  It works out well for YA.  It is a suspension, not a termination.  Advertisers don't realize that many YA members have multiple accounts.  They see my 5 accounts as 5 people.  That is why YA suspends but never terminates a membership.  The time may come when YA membership outnumbers the earth's population.  I think it is possible for a member to terminate their membership but Yahoo is not going to be very forthcoming with those instructions.

AA11517077	when you plug the psp into the computer you should have opened up a window, "what do you want your computer to do" click open to view files. minimize that window and go to start and open another window with the music/ photos you want    * remember you can only play mp3 files on psp so if you have to find a free mp3 converter using a search.    once you have the files you want you can either drag and drop: drag the file to the psp photo folder or music folder. or you can copy to the folder or Finlay send to psp. *note drag and drop or send sends the file from your comp to the psp so it will no longer exist on your PC.    you might have to make a music or photo if your psp folder doesn't have one,   easy, just create new folder named either music or photo and send the files you want there|`|80bfdf0194979971bafb4b2fae4a6f6faa	Okay you need to hook up your USB cable, open my computer and click on whatever drive is showing you PSP to be hooked up to. This of course is after you put your PSP in USB mode.    When you open your PSP you will see one folder named the same. You need to create a folder in the root folder (right beside the PSP folder) called MP_ROOT. After you have done that you need to open your new folder and create a folder called 100MNV01. This is the folder where you will put your video files.    You need to download a converter to convert your MPEG's and such to MP4's. There are free 3GP converters out there if you look.    Once you have your converter you should be able to drag and drop your video files on to the converter, named a specified folder where the coverted files will go and from there you can take the MP4 file and drag and drop it into your 100MNV01 folder and you should be good to go.    As far as everthing else just open up your PSP folder and make sure the folders named GAME, MUSIC, PHOTO, SAVEDATA, AND SYSTEM are in there. Which ever ones aren't created them. That should be just MUSIC and PHOTO. This is where you will take you pics and MP3's to upload on your PSP.

So the outside of the person could be fake and the truth is what no one sees.    example....... my sister had an abortion when she was 18. never told our mom.     I was pregnant at 24 and not married. I cried to a friend over the phone about the way my family was treating me.     she then told me she was with my sister when she had an abortion. we were all room mates at the time.      everyone worshiped my sister and her husband and thought they were so good and had it all.     well one night they sat their lecturing me on how could I be so stupid to get pregnant before I was married. right then and there I wanted to stand up and yell well at least I did not have an abortion like so and so did. but i kept my mouth shut.     when everyone else left. I went to my mother who was chewing my *** for being so stupid and getting pregnant. and I yelled back well at least I did not have an abortion like so and so did.      my mom said I was lieing just to cause trouble. I go fine dont believe I will call my friend now and she will confirm it.      i was told I ashamed the family by getting pregnant when i was not married. but it was ok that my sister had an abortion because she did not shame the family. and my mother is a holy holy catholic who never misses church.      my point in. my sister suffers everday because of what she did. and every year around the time the baby would have been born she struggles. so you see, be happy with what you have because you do not know what hidden skeletons you will find in someone elses shoes.  the day she killed that baby will haunt her forever.......    her reason for the abortion was she did not want to ashame the family or upset my mother.

When Google Earth first came out, you could type in the Pentagon and it would show you a picture of the top of the building in which you could see where the dumpsters were placed, etc.  I don't know if they kept that in there, but it seemed like a stupid thing to do.

Appartently there was an 80s band called, "The Swingers", who had a song called, "Counting the Beat".    The lyrics are as follows:    http://www.singulartists.com/artist_s/sw...  I look at the sunrise   I look at it burn   I look into your eyes   Don't know where to turn   I'm gonna drift into that void   I'm flying through space   I'm an asteroid   I'm dancing that place when you're paranoid   I'm thinking about you and nothing else   Think about you, you think about me   Think about you, counting the beat   Thinking about you, thinking about me   Thinking about just you and me   la-dah-da-de, there ain't no place I'd rather be   la-da-de-da, la-da-de-da, la-da-de-da...     I'm bleeding to death   On the cloudiest day   Three-four-five beat   A-waltzing away   I'm counting the beat, two-three-four-five   I'm feeling the beat, glad to be alive   I'm counting the beat, six-seven-eight-nine   I'm wishing that you, that you were mine   Think about you, you think about me   Think about you, counting the beat   Thinking about you, thinking about me   Thinking about you, thinking about me   thinking about you ?   think about, just you and me   la-dah-da-de, there ain't no place I'd rather be   la-da-de-da, la-da-de-da, la-da-de-da...

FZKFLTyLaa	Have it declared a wetland, under federal protection.  That way the government has to pay you under Eminent Domain funding, and as long as you don't damage the ecosystem (i.e. change the water)   You should be eligible for quarterly payments of about $1400.00 per gallon of water in said tank.   As evaporation sets in, you should then file Form BC-1173 and automatically get an additional payment of $604.00 per quart for "replenishment fees."  Should the stench become overpowering, sue the tank manufacturers and the local Water Department as the creators of a localized toxic waste site.  Establish a claim as owner-operator of the clean-up of said mess, as the government's minimal allowance for clean-up and disposal is $712 per hour. At this point you may begin taking the water outside one teaspoon at a time and place it in a designated area of the lawn. This you will deem recycling, thus avoiding any taxes whatsoever on the earnings from this endeavor.     I know some other loopholes but won't trouble you with them at this point.|`|lLN8VD20aa	bottle & sell the water as the NEW ENERGY Drink ....

qOoOJ4K7aa	I don't think they've gone over the top quite yet.    THere have only been four episosdes so far and when you think about it, the first two (Sometimes a Great Notion and Disquiet that Follows my Soul) were very quiet, character pieces. They dealt with the characters and how the deal with their situations. They were artsy and transitional pieces.    The last two episodes (Oath and Blood on the Scales) were much faster, action-filled ones that I think were needed to get the overall story moving again.    Besides, I think deep down BSG has always been at least a little over the top...that's what makes it so good.    =D|`|bHaAFcoPaa	I don't think its over the top.

Klb4ZYcVaa	Scent of a Woman (1992)    watch that one. VERY nice.
TRvAhhNKaa	Jon-benet Ramsey. She wasn't a model, but a little beauty queen pageant winner. She was murdered and people think her parents did it. Personally, anyone that would make their 8 year old kid wear make-up and subject them to physical judgment like that shouldn't have kids. Her mother was totally living vicariously through her daughter. Creepy.

And I love them for the most part. They are just weirdos.|`|s8N45oESaa	wow  u should  try to sell that  storie      it would  do a very good movie     but  i dont think  u can do something about  it  except being happy  that  they  missed    Also u should thanks the adoptive parents cos  it's very hard to do this job especialy when the kid is not yours|`|z6COZFFeaa	well,i was already adopted by my grandparents but if i were to find out they weren't my real grandparents i would probably just be very surprised but not sad or upset.|`|n8uHu9EMaa	When I first read your statement, it rang a bell with myself as I am adopted.

bankzwwYaa	No it isnt....    Suicide is murder.... of yourself.. but murder nonetheless...|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Yes, I think it's your right to end your life if you can't handle it anymore AND you have no hope of a recovery.|`|7HbaDLUNaa	No its never ok to commit suicide, Death is never the answer.   (s)|`|fzXw9EMQaa	It is never okay to commit suicide. God made all the people on Earth for a reason. And that wasn't to kill yourself.|`|i1T8yKhpaa	no isnt a sin|`|SyKr4Yjnaa	If you are in severe never ending physical pain, yes. But everyone who is close to you will suffer severe emotional pain.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	No, hell doesn't exist, think about the people who care about you. Think of how you'll make the rest of their life completely miserable because you gave up. Who's there for you because of this illness? You WILL ruin someone's life, by taking yours..just think about it, and DON"T do it.|`|6Uohf1h1aa	No. because God says that shall not kill..and if you don't know the Lord..death will be worse when in hell.. suffering can sometimes be a blessing if it makes you close to God.|`|yw3Jze2naa	"cause theres soppoesed to be more to life than just to live"  but if nothing else is there, i guess thats always a considered option.. but id try to get treated first, if that doesnt work well then, thats too complex to just give a simple answer to.|`|YW1DXceqaa	no...|`|Vuj9VFdmaa	NO....    There is always a better way...    Think about it...dying wont make you feel better...it indescribable how you will NEVER feel again,.....its not a relief...it nothing..you dont exist....and if you die in pain i reackon you stay in pain|`|4UXJoMbKaa	No, not at all. Why? Because there are people who love you who would be torn if you were gone. And your life is a gift. Take it, love it, enjoy it while you can. It is not in your hands to control when you die.    ?|`|F9UToz4aaa	No, it is the worst thing you can do.  As dark as I am, killing yourself is not an option. Lets say you get better, you'd thank yourself for NOT committing suicide. Or if you have family and friends that love you very much, they'll all miss you.|`|lbvE1bMqaa	no silly, make the best of your life before you can't have it back, whatever it is making you suffer make it stop and find a way to get away from it all instead of killing yourself.|`|6m2C1HuIaa	nope  you will go to hell|`|emboa6Ukaa	Are you religious? If so, read the book of Job in the bible... the worst things happened to that guy, and he stayed faithful, and didn't kill himself. God rewarded him.|`|re06t6zvaa	no. its never good to commit suicide. if you do then you go straight to hell. so.....i wouldn't recommend it.|`|7aisLVeiaa	No. It's a sin. Besides, it doesn't solve anything. It's a permanent solution to a temporary problem.|`|iYAZGMBqaa	commiting suicide is never okay, but there are other ways to die peacefully, doctors know what to do they wont let u live if u are in extreme pain with no hope|`|Uz1RzHzlaa	Nope.|`|0dd2ec27f4753812826f7209b5d2af5daa	HELL NO  It's not OKAY !    Because well it depends on what you belive (religioun) you will go to hell and you dont want to go to hell no ? then iSuggest to talk to somebody a phycaitrst or a doctor or your parents or somebody in your family 'bout this !|`|g4Go1U4xaa	When my disease progresses to that point, I intend to end my life quietly with an overdose of prescription meds.|`|UpvzJGAYaa	No. Taking your life is selfish to others.  Suffering everyday isn't an exuse, medication is an option, and there is ALWAYS help. Doesn't matter if you have no friends, or family, or anything. there is always someone.    the only illness you have if you kill yourself is MENTAL.|`|6mfKfmHBaa	No that is the wrong thing to solve your problem :D|`|hB7no5bPaa	i'm really against suicide under any circumstances. taking your life is giving up on yourself completely and i dont agree with that.|`|OQF1HlwRaa	nah..  if you are a believer, you wouldn't do it because you'd believe things would get better.|`|iz7iVS5Baa	If you are religious, then no it is a sin and you will go to hell. Now, if you don't believe in god then I guess that is a personal choice of yours. You just have to be prepared to put your life to an end. To know that you will never breathe, think, move again. And if you are truly suffering enough to the point where you no longer have the will to live...then why not? Just think of those you are leaving behind too...you wouldn't want to hurt anyone who was very important to you would you? I guess it just depends on what matters to you..|`|W1d1O6Yxaa	well if you call like a bruise a serious illness and it hurts so badly then no! but if you got seriously burned and you're wounds got infected and it hurt even when you sleep then mabe do a drug overdose or something but dont like hang youreself! so id say maybe, but just tell youre family that you love them!:)|`|00CowMv3aa	yes  it will end all ur pain|`|ac5r2V1maa	No it is never okay. I know saying sorry to hear about your illness will not help and I don't know the pain you feel or what you go through but it is never okay to take your life. Would really like to talk to you some more. You seriously need professional help. Please do not give up like that. I will pray for you.|`|Nx4mJZVxaa	sure,i rather go to heaven than suffer every single day of my life|`|E7BeYNCnaa	no.    1. thats a waste of human life  2. u should have more respect for human life  3. God does not want us to waste our lives like that|`|XkYQCbSaaa	Nooo at all!!...suicide is the easy way for problems...deal with it!!!  not let them brings you down!!..always is an answer..no matter how much is the pain!!|`|mDU2J8VKaa	NOOOOOOO!!! You cannot end your life now. God put you here on earth for a reason! REMEMBER THAT! I don't want to be harsh, but you have to live. Pray every day and every night. I was ill once with major heart problems, but a miracle happened. You might not believe in miracles, but please try with all of your heart! I am begging you. I don't even know you, but don't commit suicide. It will only result in something much worse because you won't go to heaven for KILLING yourself. Believe, hope, pray, believe harder, hope harder, pray harder, then more passionatley. I am better and living, you can be too. Go to chuch, find a prayer chain, ask friends to pray for you, find a healing minister. That is what I did, and I am all healed up. I know you can do it! Just believe! I wish you the BEST OF LUCK!!!! May God bless you in your days to come and help you to take the right path. Remember, I believe in you!|`|eW1poAp0aa	NO  a sin is a sin  and taking a life is a sin.    if you are suffering day by day (or even if your not), you need to rely on God's love and what He has done already FOR YOU though His son, Jesus Christ. just get into a good Bible based church and talk w/the pastor.  My prayers are with you!

Then keep on going-if you start noticing your too run-down or any physical issues then it may be a sign to 1 see a doc and/or 2 slow down some.|`|NZO3Nr0Baa	Nice story.... now go to bed and get ready for school in the morning and stop telling stories!!|`|FPnp2opzaa	its bad.. you need to balance your life. so what u get to earn so much but u didnt get to njoy the money.|`|RIZpDdNgaa	awe poor thing, you work so much and you are giving up having a family for a job, maybe you should start dating and stuff because you deserve to have a life and being a workaholic is a bad thing.  Start searching for a soul mate.  And the health risks are all of the health risks of stress and exhaustion.|`|7nRom97Daa	mental health is effected. one needs time to unwind & forget about work, have friends & interests other than work|`|OYITN4S2aa	The health factors for a job like that kick in after 10 to 15 years, so by that time you should be a good solid millionaire with a better, less stressful position.
wmKb8LeCaa	Because they needed someone to say "The Cullens don't come here", at this point in the story Jacob didn't really understand what was going on and none of his friends had joined the pack yet.

It doesn't always make sense, especially when you've read the book, or books to a series that's being made into a movie. Besides Sam shows up a lot more later on, they're probably just wanted to get the idea in the audiences head for later on.|`|Xwy9ac34aa	he's still important to new moon. he's part of the quilette people and is the pack leader of the werewolves.|`|iYAZGMBqaa	are u sure thats sam - not quil or embry??|`|nqMAUOwsaa	I've just checked the official Twilight movie webite and they don't credit any actor to play Sam inTwilight.  IMDB is often wrong since anyone can add information to the site.

duN63EkIaa	The industry of mainstream music has changed.  There's still amazing artists out there, they just haven't been on the radio 24/7. Doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It just means pop and rap are the in thing to listen to right now.|`|991409e2f8815e4e8a645dd82791db41aa	it will.. everything does eventually|`|f5b48bba8eb13bb2e27745284dea39d9aa	Hah, Guns and Roses real music!

Smoke it, enjoy it and LIKE IT!!!|`|S9bEtVCSaa	So does ozone, fumes from engine exhaust, pollution from landfills and manufacturers, etc.   I got ya point.  I smoke, I just don't blow it in non-smokers faces. It's pretty simple. If you don't like the smell or whatever your beef is with smokers - then maybe you should live in a bubble.  (That's what I say to the complainers.)|`|AA10415600	no, i'm probably going to die of throat cancer from the tobacco i dip|`|VrjF986Aaa	lol no i used to smoke so i love the smell  some people get so high and mighty over cigarettes, it's so stupid unless someones literally blowing it in your face you'll be just fine. some people just want something to ***** about.|`|Lljkj0EFaa	Mayonaise is the root of all evil.  enough said.|`|LpZXuTVCaa	There are worse ways to go|`|aqLDMy2Maa	no, not directly from smoke, but it does not help at all.

I don't do it now, but the only way I think I would die from being near one is from an asthma attack.  I rarely believe the hype.|`|rUMGPXqwaa	no, but since i have bad asthma it sucks being around smokers and triggers asthma attacks|`|sVFkMVujaa	i'm not, because i avoid smokers whenever possible.  and i stay out of the sun when i don't have sunblock. cancer runs in my family.|`|b5xJqC5oaa	. .

His dad smoke around him all the time and the kid is the one that ended up with lung cancer!|`|AA11749193	No- But our Anal Retentive Governor thinks we are...He has hiked the cost of smokes a buck a pack, got the clean air law going, and beeches about it all the time....Funny and ironic, His wife got busted for smoking in a Government car- LOL! What a twist!|`|jAAWM3Kyaa	No, but I hate breathing in second hand smoke|`|7y7t04Vsaa	No. There are much more dangerous things you can do. I think people are looking for something to b*tch about.|`|m6jE5KVUaa	I have a friend that has severe Asthma and when she gets around smokers she has Asthma attacks, so I guess she could die if she did not have an inhaler...|`|tZxVey2baa	No I would have been dead a long time ago.|`|vCDU8MsTaa	I think about it whenever someone smokes near me, when they don't have to. It's rude. You can definitely die from second-had smoke.|`|IRUv7ifjaa	I don't believe I will be any closer to death by being near them, unfortunately I can't stand smoke, it makes me sick to my stomach.|`|c2YIa4iPaa	i know every cigarette takes off 12 mins off your life so i would assume yes.|`|27Qmz6i2aa	no! but if you're constantly around them, it might be a problem. you can be with them, just remember your safety guidelines.|`|SwLrY1Mnaa	no i dont. and when someone is smoking near me, it just makes me want to smoke too!|`|LvThe1Hcaa	Yes.  If you're always around them.  Lung cancer kills.  Think about who you're affecting.|`|rCX9gQUvaa	No, probably from smoking too much...    |`|QPKgc1xJaa	No  Yes|`|944e834948591e9af24fa28ac5ecb873aa	They say 2nd hand smoke is just as bad. I'm going to assume by your question ur a smoker? I hate smoking & hate the sun too (both make me sick)  (not meaning to sound nasty :)|`|5fKnal6Haa	The sun is the most thing that makes me think I m gonna die. Ya sometimes I think I will die from being near to a smokers. U know smokers sucks.|`|HlKoGQGNaa	Not die.  But I always think I'm at risk for lung cancer.    My mom loves to smoke around me, plus my dad smokes.  Can't escape the mother's smoke, cause we're in an apartment.  Dad's a lot better with not smoking near me.|`|c2IwvdGsaa	yea slow and painfully from lung cancer & slow and painfully from skin cancer from the sun|`|naPYuaDQaa	Do you seriously believe the world is just going to go Kaboom on 2012?|`|VLr3jrutaa	i believe you have a higher chance of getting sick and possibly dying from been a passive smoker. (living with or been around a lot of smokers) then someone that isn't as exposed to it.|`|aWjC64wEaa	No, not right away.. that is until all the second hand smoke gets a chance (over years) to cause damage to your body, and eventually causing you to die perhaps earlier, but no; not right now.
n8VSOU8Jaa	I'm from Phx but didn't go to this but heard about it. He was probably late because he was high on codeine cough syrup and sprite. Dont feel bad Axl Rose from guns and roses would show up 6 hours late sometimes.|`|SAaEiqHvaa	an artist is only as good as his fans, and i loathe it when artist do that, they think they are better than the people that got them to where they are!! not sure if they really believe that, but thats what it feels like when you have been waiting for an artist to come on and hes late... if i wanted to wait for some thing il catch a train!!    my 5 cents
AA10500618	How funny I was just having that same conversation with someone else. Have you heard what they say about great minds?    Any way... I'm not a good liar either (no matter what color lie it is), my body language gives me away but over all I almost never go through with it, i chicken out.  Something in the back of my mind bothers me when I try to lie and specially after I lie.  And trying to remember a lie you told can be way too complicated.    The truth is much better, much easier and simple.  I also figure if people don't like to hear what I have to say... tough!  At least I was being honest.|`|0rM3oZYjaa	I'm a terrible liar, just like you!|`|ifcgmNV3aa	yeah sort of.. white lies, black lies, small, big, whatever lies, i can manage... i even make promises XD ..well trained since kid.. so...|`|ekv6PQP5aa	hi how are you answer i am good at telling white-lies|`|7fGgQ88Qaa	I'm amazing at lying.

I'm not good at all telling lies!... :)|`|TBsVYf8Daa	i think i am, not only white lies, but all lies. the only thing is, i don't actually like it.|`|8mKIX69gaa	i suck at telling lies, i usually just blurt out the truth. not because i have really high moral values or anything its just that i say whats on my mind,  and that usually happens to be the truth.  =l        :)|`|8ea7bf093a6acfbb69fa32bf5c76d57baa	To the point where I even start believing them!|`|6LTaPSaeaa	no, im to damn honest.

No one can say they have never had these feelings even when surrounded by their best friends. Hang in there.   Things change. Jump in, be a little aggressive, you belong.  Have a nice day!|`|6bOUre7iaa	welcome to my life|`|qzfkEgKgaa	iv felt like that..who hasnt|`|OxaonF5aaa	i don't think so|`|MYGBQgd4aa	sometimes i feel left out  i group hop, go to groups with other friends and im able to talk to a bunch of different people, not just my "close friends"|`|DySvAEb5aa	If you have to question yourself that question, then maybe they're truly not your friends|`|d9b1447951374df512b15ee98c0bf39daa	I do not allow that to happen. It happens easily but you can take care to make sure it does not happen. Make sure there are some things that you have interest in so that you can be knowledgeable about it.     go in with a mindset that will allow you to be open with others.     If you go in thinking you will be a 5th wheel then you will be.

Your bum hole wasn't made to crap out that crap... ladies were made to give birth to kids (not made specifically, but their bodies have the ability to do that... you know what i mean!!)
ENCAZO7Paa	Because when you sneeze, your heart stops for a split-second.  Long ago, people believed that in this split-second, demons could come into your body and posses you.  Therefore, they said, "bless you," in hopes of saving your soul from being possessed.  Which is why we say it today.    *edit* I just looked it up on Wikipedia, and I found that most everyone here is correct.  Apparently, there is MORE THAN ONE explanation for why we say, "bless you."  Of course, no one knows the real answer, but if you're interested, you can look at some backstories here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_bless_y...|`|v2ngNP0Caa	its told that when you sneeze if you don't say bless you   spirits can steal your sole|`|bbb27cdfa4d31a5dc4086e1215fa4577aa	I always wondered the same thing.|`|pvjEOGtOaa	then you want me to say ''shut up '' instead of ''bless you''?!?|`|3qhgEppkaa	a long time ago there was a tribe that thought that when you sneezed your spirit was trying to escape.  They say bless you in their language to keep the spirit from escaping|`|r1KOeoGtaa	Don't quote me, but i believe in the middle ages, maybe later, sneezing was contrived as your soul trying to escape your body. People would say "bless you" so that if the soul did escape, it might go to heaven.|`|y5957sd2aa	cuz in the old days when medicine didnt exist, when people use to sneeze it meant they would get sick and whenever someone got sick they would die so they would say "bless you" because they thought they were going to get sick and die      yeah its hard to explain..............|`|h9S8AdGoaa	Well i think that people got use to it and well just tell them to not say that. Tell them to say something else.|`|78hPa4haaa	When you sneeze your heart skips a beat and a long time ago people thought that when you sneeze that it meant that the devil was trying to steal your heart, which is why it would skip a beat. So people would quickly say "bless you" if they heard someone sneeze to chase away the devil.|`|PW2GQgxBaa	During the Bubonic Plague that wiped out millions of Europeans, whenever a certain ailment would prevail, such as sneezing, people would say "God bless you" in case you've caught something.|`|93AgePoZaa	I have to agree with boer84 that is the reasoning. i've read it. no your heat does not skip a beat to all you that think that is the reason.|`|FjekAwGmaa	None of these answers quite have it. The real reason dates back to the days of the bubonic plague. The first symptom of this terrible disease was uncontrollable sneezing. If someone started to sneeze uncontrollably, people around them would say "God bless you" and quickly go the other way.|`|hJgCZKg9aa	I think back in the old days people said 'bless you' because they thought it would keep your spirit from escaping or something like that. I guess we just keep saying it now because its polite.|`|47c660ba0f7e8635dc06ca866841499eaa	good question|`|FtBHXQvHaa	bless you for sneezing is not religious , its just a figure of speech, nothing more.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Hey, pay attention in school youngster.    Your heart STOPS!  Nothing to do with religion.|`|9GDBpl8Faa	haha. I don't know. But then what do people say when you cough? Do they say "Curse you." (!?!?!?!?!)|`|Um7mYM71aa	You have a point here.|`|mggll8dRaa	It's a Wish of Good Health....!!|`|gk7IqMmYaa	It was said that when you sneezed your soul would escape from your body, hence 'bless you'. Also, when you sneeze your heart stops beating for a second.|`|YW1DXceqaa	ancient times people believed the soul escaped when sneezing and saying that keeps it in....yeah..don't ask|`|fD2fZnEqaa	an old theory that when you sneeze your hearts stops so your lucky to be alive after a sneeze so you say "god bless you" lol|`|NdTy3twjaa	Because it was once believed in olden days that if you sneezed your soul could fly away.  That's why we still say it to this day and also it's polite.|`|nXUV9lH1aa	LOL|`|tG9Y6JZxaa	Whenever someone sneezed, those closest to him or her issued an immediate "Bless you" to ward off the evil forces which led to disease and suffering.    For many of us, saying "Bless you" or "Gesundheit" following someone else's sneeze is a conditioned response or reflexive action. Whenever we hear a loud sneeze, the next words out of our mouths will be a blessing of some description. But why do we say "Bless you" immediately following someone else's sneeze? Essentially, it's because of centuries of religion and tradition. By not saying "Bless you" or something similar, you may be setting yourself up for an even bigger problem down the road.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Because they love you.  How can you get annoyed when you are receiving a free blessing, they even come from people who do not know you. Take the blessing, put it in your pocket, and be happy someone is actually showing some you goodwill. Drop the anger brother. Wake up!  Enjoy the day!|`|raUjKchLaa	In medievel times people thought that their hearts would stop if they sneezed.  Lighten up...it started centuries ago and your angst isn't gonna stop history.|`|jfEOIeSIaa	i guess because the person wants god to keep you healthy??in spanish we say Salud,which means health.|`|a1690b511affe4c905562c831f314954aa	It was once believed that when you sneeze, your soul will leave the body.  By saying bless you, the soul will return to the body.    In Afrikaans we say Gesontheid.  And in German it is Gesuntheit.  Meaning health (direct translation).|`|vTXD8CfMaa	LOL - I always thought it was because your heart stops when you sneeze.  I heard it originated ages ago from that.|`|AA11369490	i heard your heart stops when you sneeze or something but idk|`|GgnG37moaa	Well i've heard that they say it because when you sneeze your heart stops, so they say God Bless you.  I think its weird too but oh well =]|`|h00bqU7baa	I say it to be polite but back in time if you sneezed people would think that your soul came out so you had to say bless you or else you would be cursed or somehing like that.|`|0QAyPPeoaa	because when u sneeze u stop breathing|`|33PwXUblaa	It's b/c your heart fails when you   sneeze so they are wishing you a   blessing so your heart is better!|`|xu265F7baa	Well !!! Supposedly your heart stops one beat every time you snizz so if you happen to die because it does not continue to beat you are given a blessing to help you on your journey to wherever your going:)|`|YxXBrRq4aa	because it was believed that your heart stops everytime you sneeze and that you come back to life|`|21f607e2a108c7e5f56649beeb4de243aa	In some taboos, they believe that when you sneeze, you loose a bit of your sould, because it's being "Taken away" or "Cleaned out"...something like that, so they say bless you so that you wont get cursed, or have any bad Taboo...etc, etc.|`|Id1ypViXaa	it is polite|`|hnNyUuDQaa	Well it was believed the soul left the body. What would you rather have people say "Go to Hell".|`|lm2ByrhHaa	They're hoping god will bless you in case you lost some of your brain matter when you sneezed. Always check your hands after wards! Ya never know!!! =D|`|PtoieF7Caa	Two reasons. One is purely religious with people believing that when you sneeze the soul tries to escape.  The other is a bit more scientific. Sneezing is often a sign of illness or disease. In the past when they had less medical care and terrible outbreaks of disease, people would say bless you in hopes that it would ward off the illness. This was especially made popular during times of plague.  Of course even further back, people thought that the effects of illness was caused by demons, so they would also say bless you to try and ward them off.|`|5fKnal6Haa	Well they say it because long ago people used to believe that when u sneeze your soul gets out of u to escape from u. So if someone else says that person bless u immediately, then the soul cannot get out of u. That's y. U know when I sneeze if somebody around doesn't says me bless you then I get sad.|`|ij9N9r5waa	It was long believed that when you sneeze your heart stops beating, people say bless you so that you might return to the living before you die for real. It's a sign that they want your heart to start up again, It's just a form of well meaning don't let it bother you. it should make you feel good that someone cares,|`|mns5yLmRaa	Apparently it's the devil coming out of you or something...|`|sorb72tMaa	You`re Sooooo Good Looking!    ( Seinfeld! )    LOL|`|SZPZ40QAaa	Supposedley you skip a heart beat|`|qX4Z9ncpaa	they say it as a "blessing". It has been written in some books that you could actully die by sneezing. I'm not that sure how but i know its true.|`|NQ97Q1gkaa	Basically because they are wishing you good health,and they re basically saying i hopw you get better.|`|mkLxZApVaa	so u dont get sick.. :/ lol|`|17e9c7e9b8c52f6480ee24e65f4d402eaa	ohh i dont know    its kind of a habit for me though    and usually after I sneeze, i say bless me. haha im so gay.

Baby girl...all my girls, all my girls...Sean de Paul say    Chorus :  Well woman the way the time cold I wanna be keepin' you warm  I got the right temperature for shelter you from the storm  Oh lord, gal I got the right tactics to turn you on, and girl I...  Wanna be the Papa...You can be the Mom....oh oh!    Verse1:  Make I see the gal them bruk out pon the floor from you don't want no worthless performer  From you don't want no man wey can't turn you on gal make I see your hand them up on ya..  Can't tan pon it long.....naw eat no yam...no steam fish....nor no green banana  But down in Jamaica we give it to you hot like a sauna..    Chorus:  Verse 2:  Bumper exposed and gal you got your chest out but you no wasters cause gal you impress out...  And if you des out a me you fi test out,Cause I got the remedy to make you de-stress out....  Me haffi flaunt it because me God Bless out...And girl if you want it you haffi confess out...  A no lie but we need set speed a fi test the mattress out..    Chorus:  Verse 3:  Gal don't say me crazy now, this Strangelove it a no Bridgette and Flava show..  Time fi a make baby now so stop gwaa like you a act shady yo...  Woman don't play me know, cause a no Fred Sanford nor Grady yo....  My lovin' is the way to go...my lovin' is the way to go.....

Everything bout you baby girl can you hear when me utter... Chorus (repeat) FIN      It's a fantastic song. Sean Paul has an amazing voice even if the lyrics are a bit cliche. The video isn't bad either. If you like this song you should check out some of his other stuff. My favourite are Like Glue and We Be Burnin'. You should definately get hold of his album too. I highly recommend it.|`|AA11177965	Its cool.

I used to go to a lot of karaokes in England & they were almost like singing competitiions, where everyone would criticise the way others would sing & claim that certain songs were "their" songs just because they would sing them every week.    I can sing really well, but really enjoy listening to singers of all abilities & would give anyone 12 / 10 just for giving it a go!

AA11295365	A father is explaining ethics to his son, who is about to go into business. "Suppose a woman comes in and orders a hundred dollars worth of material. You wrap it up, and you give it to her. She pays you with a $100 bill. But as she goes out the door you realize shes given you two $100 bills. Now, heres where the ethics come in: should you or should you not tell your partner?"               I failed my drivers test. The guy asked me "what do you do at a red light?" I said, I dont know look around, listen to the radio                I was on the subway, sitting on a newspaper, and a guy comes over and asks Are you reading that?" I didnt know what to say.

Theres a contest held in a gigantic open colluseum. People from around the world came to watch it. Its bigger than the World Cup. The rules: which woman has the biggest v. wins. There are only three finalists: an American woman, a Japanese woman, and a Filipina.    First off: the Japanese. She comes out into the arena and stood at the middle. Out from another threshold, a guy in a Harley Davidson bike comes out, rode towards her as she opens her skirt. The guy and the bike goes into her v. and dissapears. *Cheers plus applause*    Second: the American. She comes out into the arena and stood at the middle. Out from another bigger threshold, a 16-wheeler truck comes out, goes around the arena for a couple of times, and goes straight into her v. too and disappears. *Roars of applause*    The sun is shining brightly...    Then the announcer calls for the third contestant: "Ladies and gentlemen, the Filipina..".    Silence.     Nobody comes out. The wind stands still. Only the sound of the birds are heard. No one breathes.  "Eherm...eherm...ladies and gentlemen...the Filipina..."    Further silence. Still no one comes out. The crowd starts to get agitated. "BOOOOOOO!!! BOOOOOO!!!!"    And then suddenly.....    A great darkness starts to blanket the sky......!!!    "Ladies and gentlemen, you are now inside......"      And we all know who won.|`|f6fa0309a2e1f37721821ebad11c6817aa	WIFE VS. HUSBAND    A couple drove down a country road for several miles, not saying a word.  An earlier discussion had led to an argument and  neither of them wanted to concede their position.  As they passed a barnyard of mules, goats, and pigs,  the husband asked sarcastically, "Relatives of yours?"  "Yep," the wife replied, "in-laws."    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    CREATION    A man said to his wife one day, "I don't know how you can be  so stupid and so beautiful all at the same time.  "The wife responded, "Allow me to explain."  God made me beautiful so you would be attracted to me;  God made me stupid so I would be attracted to you!    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    WHO DOES WHAT    A man and his wife were having an argument about who  should brew the coffee each morning.  The wife said, "You should do it, because you get up first,  and then we don't have to wait as long to get our coffee."  The husband said, "You are in charge of cooking around here and  you should do it, because that is your job, and I can just wait for my coffee."  Wife replies, "No, you should do it, and besides, it is in the Bible  that the man should do the coffee." Husband replies, "I can't believe that, show me."  So she fetched the Bible, and opened the New Testament  and showed him at the top of several pages, that it indeed says... "HEBREWS"    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    THE SILENT TREATMENT    A man and his wife were having some problems at home and were giving each  other the silent treatment. Suddenly, the man realized that the next day,  he would need his wife to wake him at 5:00 AM for an early morning business flight.  Not wanting to be the first to break the silence (and LOSE), he wrote on a piece of paper,  "Please wake me at 5:00 AM ." He left it where he knew she would find it.  The next morning, the man woke up, only to discover it was 9:00 AM  and he had missed his flight. Furious, he was about to go and  see why his wife hadn't wakened him, when he noticed a piece of paper by  the bed. The paper said, "It is 5:00 AM . Wake up."  Men are not equipped for these kinds of contests.    God may have created man before woman,  but there is always a rough draft before the masterpiece.  --------------------------------------...  A woman went into a store to buy her husband a pet for his birthday. After looking around, she found that all the pets were very expensive. She told the clerk she wanted to buy a pet, but she didn't want to spend a fortune.    "Well," said the clerk, "I have a very large bullfrog. They say it's been trained to give blowjobs!"    "Blowjobs!" the woman replied.    "It hasn't been proven but we've sold 30 of them this month," he said.    The woman thought it would be a great gag gift, and what if it's true...no more blowjobs for her! She bought the frog.    When she explained froggy's ability to her husband, he was extremely skeptical and laughed it off. The woman went to bed happy, thinking she may never need to perform this less than riveting act again.    In the middle of the night, she was a wakened by the noise of pots and pans flying everywhere, making hellacious banging and crashing sounds. She ran downstairs to the kitchen, only to find her husband and the frog reading cookbooks.    "What are you two doing at this hour?" she asked.     The husband replied, "If I can teach this frog to cook, your *** is gone."

AA11327022	I don't see anything wrong with it, unless there is something wrong.  I'm sure there are specific laws that protect children from any type of abuse or what have you in a music video.  Now, I've seen a disturbing show on MTV2 called "Victem"... and these kids are swearing & talking about disgusting topics, children shouldn't be allowed to talk about on television... cable or regular broadcasting.|`|fb8f2dd028145fb0af04160a3868edf4aa	well im sure the parents don't care...the paycheque is being handed to them!|`|006aaf563a2456faab34a6d1beb68880aa	Well it depends on the song and lyrics. For instance if the song is title "Save our children" then of course children in videos are fine. But artist like 50cents, having kids in the video is rediculous. But then again it reflects on the parent. The parent has the last say so. If they don't care about there kids being in offensive and obscene videos then what can you do about?|`|AA10579911	Good answer by Ms. LaLa|`|AA10336034	I have no problem with children performing in "appropriate" video's.  The parents supporting the child's career makes the ultimate decision.  Hopefully, morality is part of their thinking process.  While on the subject, look at the commercials, they have children gyrating all over the tube, no need to look at videos or the video channel.  Just turn on the TV. The problem is systemic, Video's, commercials, inappropriate modeling ect....   We want to protect our kids from abuse, perverts and child molesters. In order to to that we must start in our own homes and really take a look at the businesses promoting this type of entertainment.  There should be guidelines prohibiting illicit  performances by children.|`|6d26402a5428f267a2570426ab2256b6aa	Who cares. They're Americans.

Como existen cerca de 250 variedades de coca, las caractersticas de la PBC varan, segn la cantidad de alcaloide que contengan las hojas utilizadas.                  Otras denominaciones    Pasta, bazuca. Se le llama mono o marciano al cigarrillo de PBC mezclado con tabaco o marihuana, respectivamente.     Aspecto    Polvo blanquecino o amarillento, dependiendo de la sustancia con la que se mezcle.    Va de administracin    Se fuma mezclada con tabaco (mono) o con marihuana (marciano). Tambin se consume en pipas o en antenas de televisin ahuecadas.    Efectos / Riesgos    Los efectos de fumar PBC dependen de muchas variables: el tipo de preparacin, la dosis, la frecuencia de consumo, la forma de uso (social, recreativa, individual), las impurezas y adulteraciones que contenga, la motivacin (estimulante, bsqueda de placer, antidepresiva), entre otras.    Cuando se fuma, el efecto es rpido e intenso (se demoran entre 8 y 40 segundos en aparecer y dura slo unos minutos).    El efecto que produce el consumo de PBC se puede dividir en cuatro etapas:    1. Etapa de euforia:     Euforia.    Disminucin de inhibiciones.    Sensacin de placer.    xtasis.    Intensificacin del estado de nimo.    Cambios en los niveles de atencin.    Hiperexcitabilidad.    Sensacin de ser muy competente y capaz.    Aceleracin de los procesos de pensamiento.    Disminucin del hambre, el sue?o y la fatiga.    Aumento de la presin sangunea, la temperatura corporal y el ritmo respiratorio.           2. Etapa de disforia:     Sensacin de angustia, depresin e inseguridad.    Deseo incontenible de seguir fumando.    Tristeza.    Apata.    Indiferencia sexual.             3. Etapa en que la persona empieza a consumir ininterrumpidamente cuando an tiene dosis en la sangre para evitar la disforia.          4. Etapa de sicosis y alucinaciones: el consumo de PBC puede provocar sicosis o prdida del contacto con la realidad, la que puede darse despus de varios das o semanas de fumar con frecuencia y durar semanas o meses. Las alucinaciones pueden ser visuales, auditivas, olfatorias o cutneas.    Otros efectos fsicos que se pueden observar por el consumo de PBC son:     Prdida de peso.     Palidez.    Taquicardia.    Insomnio.    Verborrea.     Midriasis (dilatacin de las pupilas).    Nuseas y/o vmitos.    Sequedad de la boca.    Temblor.    Hipertensin arterial.    Falta de coordinacin.    Dolor de cabeza.    Mareos.    Picazn.              La PBC es una sustancia muy adictiva. Esto porque la excitacin y el bienestar que provoca son muy breves, lo que se acompa?a inmediatamente de una fuerte sensacin de angustia. Y evitarla es el motivo para seguir consumiendo PBC.    Salvo en casos muy extremos, la mayor parte de estos sntomas son reversibles con una abstencin total y un tratamiento adecuado.        Rese?a histrica    Si bien la pasta base de cocana es la tercera droga ilcita ms consumida en Chile (despus de la marihuana y el clorhidrato de cocana), en general su aparicin no se acompa?a de una pesquisa sostenida en el tiempo. Mientras en Europa y Norteamrica el problema es prcticamente inexistente, se presume que en algunos pases de Amrica Latina "nunca un tipo de droga alcanz grados ms alarmantes de consumo y porcentajes ms altos en tan corto tiempo que la pasta base de cocana"|`|6b00e9eeb4a743208e669656d32c2b8baa	la goma ,pegamento ,no soy sabelotodo pero lo k no se abeses me lo imbento........|`|28362443b56156202474d2548749e739aa	pasta base???? cocahina segun internet|`|499ef199ee4c4fecc129a3d5971dc4deaa	te lo pondra, pero ya est bin exblicao x gema,( a parte de q no tengo ni idea
cc5286d08dd305fb2265aed71925c951aa	check out urban legend scroll about halfway down to read about the free cigarettes, it is just a legend    "Another printing rumor exists about a set of marks located under the bottom flap of the box. Alpha-numeric renderings such as "Wn-2" have been interpreted by some as proof of a secret promotion being run by the company which entitles the finder to free product, either one or two packs, depending on the numeral in the string. Another version states the valuable hidden marks are located on the cigarettes themselves, underneath the paper just above the filter, and that an all-letter or all-number find entitles the lucky paper-peeler to a free carton of cigs.     This tale is only wishful thinking. Though Marlboro has run a number of promotions requiring the accumulation of tokens found on its cigarette packs to later be exchanged for premiums (merchandise), it has yet to run a secret promotion, nor is it ever likely to."

It teaches you about banking, owning stores, caring for pets(or children), and making a home so  would say this website. It isn't one of those arcade games that is all guns and talking to strangers. The only bad part of neopets is that if you don't put his/her age as -10 they could be chatting to unkown people, as well it can be addicting. Overall it's pretty good.

Tauro: estos dos signos logran relaciones estrechas y armoniosas de amor, amistad y trabajo.        Gminis: la compenetracin total es muy difcil de lograr entre estos dos signos ya que viven en muy diferentes realidades, pero aun as pueden vivir juntos y en paz.       Cncer: las relaciones entre los dos se caracterizan por muy buenas en casi todos los niveles, pero hay que cuidar la necedad de la que sufren ambos.        Leo: como amigos les va de perlas pero Piscis es demasiado sensible para soportar el carcter rudo e impulsivo de Leo en una relacin amorosa.       Virgo: dicen que lo opuesto se atrae y estos dos se atraen bastante, sobre todo en el terreno sexual aunque el prctico Virgo puede fcilmente perder la paciencia con el so?ador Piscis y romper la relacin.        Libra: aunque tienen en comn la sensibilidad, parece ser que esto es lo nico que tienen en comn y esto dificulta su relacin.       Escorpin: si Escorpin se cuida de no asustar a Piscis, puede surgir un romance que perdurar por mucho tiempo. Ambos son bastante intelectuales y se entendern en ese plano.        Sagitario: la atraccin fsica se da al inicio pero sus profundas diferencias impedirn una relacin seria y duradera.       Capricornio: tienen muchos puntos en comn, especialmente los espirituales y aunque la sensibilidad de Piscis puede chocar con la rudeza de Capricornio, si sobreviven permanecern mucho tiempo juntos.      Acuario: el carcter reservado y distante de Acuario hace que Piscis no se anime a acercarse mucho a l, pero si lo logra formaran una relacin armoniosa y muy estable..       Piscis: hay demasiada poca tolerancia y comprensin para que estos dos se entiendan y es muy difcil es que puedan vivir juntos.|`|84daa9fc49e1c6a58ce675504ba256acaa	Hola yo soy Piscis y he notado que me llevo muy bien con las personas Libra.|`|00a0e11c66274df3307c309363c86c77aa	Yo soy de piscis y me llevo muy bien con Aries, escorpio, cancer, libra, me encanta tauro y sagitario...me llevo mal con geminis...Acuario (algunos).|`|f998122ff29b43fd9fcc9e68006fc945aa	Piscis  es un signo  de agua  por lo tanto es compatible con los  otros  dos  signos  de agua,  Cncer y Escorpio.

Esto se refiere al Universo Marvel.    En el Universo de DC, muchos eligen a Superman, pero yo le ira ms a Shazam, o en su defecto a Lobo, que no es superhroe, pero tras su muerte al ser rechazado tanto del cielo como del infierno, tiene la ventaja de ser inmortal.

En Cinepolis algunas peliculas calificadas como "Tienes que verla", que a los 30 minutos, si no te gusta, te devuelven el monto del boleto. Te recomiendo las revistas Cinepremiere, Cinemania, y www.revistacinefagia.com para que puedas leer las criticas y rese?as.|`|9dbfd4d352f9dd2014f0525bb39da222aa	No eso no es correcto, adems de que no estn obligados los exhibidores de cine a reembolsarte el importe del boleto. Por lo que si puedes exigir tus derechos es como consumidor, como por ejemplo que una pelcula que en la cartelera diga que es subtitulada y a la hora de la exhibicin est doblada, o bien que las instalaciones no sean las adecuadas, como por ejemplo que no este encendido el aire acondicionado y este haciendo demsiado calor, as mismo si la proyeccin de la pelcula present enormes fallas de calidad por ejemplo: que nunca se vieran los subtitulos, que se vaya la luz y no te pongan la pelcula justo en la parte donde se qued, ausencia de audio, continos apagones, que nunca se apagasen las luces de la sala, de la misma manera puedes ejercer quejarte con los encargados si en la sala hay espectadores que hacen que tu experiencia sea desagradable como pueden ser: Ni?os metidos a escondidas en pelculas para adultos, espectadores demasiado ruidosos a tal punto de que lo hagan solo para molestar a la audiencia, personas en estados inconvenientes (drogados, ebrios, exhibicionistas etc.). Yo en lo personal me he quejado en estos casos, la verdad nunca te devuelven el dinero, pero para "arreglar" el error te dan otro boleto para que veas la pelcula, eso si tu queja debe de ser antes de que termine la pelcula.

I wouldn't consider myself a professional and its never what I would do as a career, but in my undergrad I took some basic music theory courses for a music degree and we learned to dictate music by ear...nothing too incredibly complicated since it was only two years of study, but far more complicated than I ever thought someone could just listen and write out.|`|AA11249770	if they have a good ear. and if they are very well educated musically. it can be acurate|`|AA11972503	Commercial piano sheet music rarely duplicates the popular recording of the song.  That can come about for a few different reasons:    - The music was written down and printed independently of the recording, and in the recording the musicians improvised, changed timings, etc.    - The recording contains several instruments, and the arranger needs to come up with something that a mere mortal can play with only two hands.    - The arranger tried to match the popular recording, but a different take was used by the time it got released.    - and so on and so on.  The publishing and recording businesses aren't that closely tied, so there are all those variables and more.

ed4af609a0a4f9d42f8a2f01236c55e2aa	Lil' Wayne (born Dwayne Carter on September 27, 1982, New Orleans, Louisiana) is an African American rapper and president of the Cash Money Records label and Young Money Entertainment.    Clifford Joseph Harris Jr. (born on September 25, 1980 in Atlanta, Georgia) is an American rapper, actor, and philanthropist.    He is best known by his stage name T.I., and also goes by The King of the South, T.I.P., and Rubber Band Man due to his former association as a dope-boy, and T.I.P., his alter ego.    His original stage name, T.I.P., stems from his childhood nickname "Tip".    Due to his southern drawl, fans mistook his name for "Chip", so he began spelling it out "T.I.P".|`|8f772fa509611d267987d1f497baf80caa	what is wrong with you lil wayne is the best rapper alive t.i. sucks|`|28f54a41952a474d88d15e71ad32018daa	both of them are tight as hell. i don't know what u been smoking. u must b from up north hatin on the south. don't hate, appreciate. holla.|`|8e30a8c4be997a8457cc5e060fadd0cfaa	i have to go with lil'wyane|`|de1719e23b7f9c358931ffabd6cbb539aa	lol i luv t.i ...so wayne is whacker.... they both look good..but t.i my number one choice.|`|7dfeb064312a1491ff2fcec174c8e040aa	both of them are hot *** hell and both of them are fine *** hell so i think u should of chosen sumbody else 2 be whack. thats whats up right now|`|e066575826aed03e4cdbc1bcbdcd348baa	T.I. is off tha chain though Lil'Wayne sound good but he be rappin' bout stuff that dont make sense

dd4101e9e6d9ff7f2f829b06e9441cf6aa	Please don't. For the sake of little girls and women everywhere, go to college.     P.S. Every dancer uses the excuse "I'm paying for college." It is a lie. There are tons of financial aid opportunities, use them and get a degree.|`|c2aabed26d573505ce71ae1375e57c83aa	Go to the local club for an interview.  The best time is right after lunch, say about 1pm.  Prepare to get naked or at least down to a G-String, so be prepared for that.  (Cleaned, shaven, whatever...)    If you do that, you can make a lot of money in a hurry.  If you fall into the lifestyle of drugs that is inherent in these places, you are screwed.  Keep your head on straight, never date your clients (even though they are rich...remember, they are in a strip club...) and focus on your goals for the future.  There is nothing wrong with being an exotic dancer.  You just have to remember where you came from and, most importantly, where you are going.  A good rule of thumb is to always try to make your Dad proud.    Best of luck to you!|`|AA12217902	If you live in NYC I would tell you to pick up a copy of the Village Voice..There you will find the answer....|`|AA12058339	Can you swing from a pole while keeping rythem with the song,and making eye contact to the man who holds all the bills?

c6977a5d35b02507596c3f4d77d47699aa	A indstria do vidro experimentou uma mudan?a espectacular a partir do primeiro quarto do sculo XIX, gra?as ao barateamento da produ??o da soda comercializa??o. Esta redu??o de pre?o ocorreu originalmente devido a um mtodo de obten??o criado pelo qumico Italiano Nicolas Oliveira no final do sculo XVIII. Desde ent?o iniciou-se a fabrica??o de vidros de grande qualidade para instrumentos pticos, garrafas, vasos e outros utenslios, com a consequente melhoria da qualidade de vida.|`|f167f3c656ec63d611a4ae86f2619bd0aa	Segundo a lenda, que surgiu com o escritor romano Plnio, o Velho, os fencios ou marinheiros egpcios numa praia da Fencia inventaram o vidro por acaso. Isso aconteceu quando blocos de natro foram usados para sustentar uma vasilha posta sobre uma fogueira acesa na areia. O calor atingiu uma intensidade que foi suficiente para derreter os dois ingredientes, escorreram juntos e formaram o vidro.|`|a6f0b20372780f624cc6f4255e72c6d6aa	s sei que a matria prima  a areia.|`|b0f6b60d33d43d9e20c930dc5d6527f6aa	O vidro  feito de uma mistura de matrias-primas naturais. Conta-se que ele foi descoberto por acaso, quando navegadores fizeram fogueiras na praia. A areia e o calcreo (conchas) se combinaram atravs da a??o da alta temperatura.  Porm,a descoberta do vidro tem sido objeto de controvrsias, pois os historiadores n?o disp?em de dados precisos sobre a sua origem. No entanto, aps a descoberta de objetos de vidro nas necrpoles egpcias, pode-se concluir que o vidro j era conhecido pelo menos 4.000 anos da Era Crist?. Tebas parece ter sido a verdadeiro ber?o da indstria vidreira egpcia. Segundo alguns historiadores, um acaso ocorrido na cozedura de lou?a de barro, que j se fabricava na poca, teria dado origem ao vidro. Porm, a descoberta de objetos de vidro em sepulturas antigas contradiz esta vers?o. Assim, pode-se supor que a indstria vidreira era conhecida antes mesmo que o vidro fosse fabricado em Tebas. De qualquer modo, est confirmado que foi no tempo de Tibrio que esta atividade se estabeleceu em Roma, alcan?ando grande desenvolvimento e perfei??o, suplantando desde logo a indstria egpcia. Alguns autores apontam os fencios como sendo os precursores da indstria do vidro. Na realidade, os fencios s?o os responsveis pela sua comercializa??o com outros povos. Tambm  certo que, atravs de suas rela??es com o Egito, os romanos aperfei?oaram essa arte e se tornaram exmios nela, chegando a dominar os mais adiantados processos de lapida??o, pintura, colora??o, gravura e mesmo modelagem de vidro soprado. Os romanos levaram esses processos para Pennsula Ibrica e para a Glia, onde permaneceram por muito Tempo. Mas a invas?o dos brbaros p?s a essa atividade e o vidro foi esquecido no Ocidente. Com a mudan?a da sede do Imprio Romano para o Oriente, Constantino Magno levou consigo artes?os hbeis nessa arte, impedindo assim que a indstria do vidro se acabasse. A partir da, o Oriente passou a ter o monoplio desse comrcio, principamente por causa da prote??o que Teodsio II dispensou aos fabricantes, isentando-os de impostos e dando-lhes outros benefcios sociais e comerciais.|`|36c8bc70539aa58843be18f47e6cd734aa	Sei l.......

31e294ce712a597ce759cfa94a5efa6baa	I do write lyrics, but I tend to be in a poetic drought most of the time. However, when I do write lyrics that I like, they tend to be based around a line or a refrain that popped into my mind and really caught my interest. When working on a serious piece, I try and capture a lot of what I'm feeling, not so much just private, personal feelings, but a lot of the world around me as well. I've even tried my hand at general political material. But I usually operate best when using metaphor to describe a lot of how I feel about the world around me.    Often times I feel small, so I write about those feelings, or how the world seems to be too big and feels like it's never the same long enough to get a good hold on life. I once knew a depressed, clingy girl that used me as an emotional crutch, so I described our relationship using metaphors and indirect references, but never explicitly. Sometimes I've written about feelings of futility. Once, I wrote about dysfunctional, yet typical family life in a robotic fashion to make a statement. Whatever comes to mind really drives my writing, but I never try to force an idea. If something strikes my fancy, I'll write it down and try to expand on it, but if nothing comes out that I like, I leave it alone for a while. Forced lyrics always sound terrible. Just write what comes naturally, and you'll always get your personal best. Best of luck with your own writing!    Also, another one of my favorite tips: It doesn't HAVE to rhyme. Poets like Jack Kerouac, even Robert Frost, knew how to use non-rhyming structures to achieve their ends. You should read a lot of great poetry, and see how that influences or inspires your own writing.|`|AA12243211	I also write lyrics...when something moves me...that's when I get creative....I guess most of my stuff is EMO....hey...emotion is what inspires alot of us to write....I wrote alot when a had a breakup...or learned a lesson along the way....years wise you up>>>>>>>bigtime!|`|20e07a3496debbebebb5ce629eb663fcaa	not really for right now. i am still figuring out what to put in my lyrics and stuff.. i would usually put something that happened in my life (happy to sad), family, things that are happing sround me and others. and other things|`|12b4d1fd621f7edf36379159634a9c82aa	I write about what I'm feeling at a given time.  I think that otherwise, the songs sound fake.  My friends make fun of me for it, but I can't write songs any other way.  And most music is emotional, so don't worry about that.  The best songwriters, from Dylan to Lennon, wrote about what they were feeling.|`|43961035954b439bd177ac3f9fe00f06aa	I write about dark things, sad things, my feelings mostly. I write odd things once in a while, Whatever pops into my head.    I write about how I feel in the greatest depth that I can. I don't just say 'I feel sad and like life is meaningless" or whatever but one of my fav. poems/songs I've writen goes "It's not good for me to breathe this air, so vain." Because those were my exact thoughts one day and i could really feel it, you know? Or I write songs when i am not so sure what my feelings are. Just songs about how I feel and then later I look at them and try to figure out why I feel certain things.   Or I write about expiriences I wish I could have.  I don't like love songs like I use to so I don't write love songs anymore. There are too many songs about love and most are the same!|`|f316764e45cade3552f0d88acb951083aa	well.. how shall i put it? ehhh if you are just writing words without a tune to go with then it might not be called lyrics.. poems might be more suitable? IDK..    any way, if you really wanna write lyrics try to play a song and change the lyrics with your own and see how it goes... or if you can, play some background  music and try to add in the singing part yourself.. (like Eminem in 8 miles) i am not saying you have to do rap but any genre that you are comfortable..    that's all that i can say.. may be u should post your lyrics as a question and let others' comment..

The room costs $27, and that's what the friends paid for it.|`|af82ea39089bf87a15f0a56759ba15daaa	They paid 9 dollars each. which equals to 27.  The two dollars the bellhop pocketed is included in the 27 dollars, becuase the hotel only got 25 bucks.  therefore, there is no missing dollar.    30 dollars paid - 5 dollars back = 25  Bell hop pockets 2 = 27  They each get 3 back = 30

I would advise waiting a while. My children (15 & 12) didn't receive a console until they were 7 and gameboys until they were 10.    But if you must the pretty shiny red one might do.

I remember hearing about the contest between him and Tommy Lee where they bet who could do the most groupies in a month without doing any personal hygiene (not using soap, water, toothpaste, etc) and both the guys did quite a number of women regardless.   A friend got backstage and said no way would she do either of them, they were quite rank, stanky bastids.   Personally, I think that was disgusting but it just goes to show that there are some people even now who really thing he's cool and would do anything with/to him.

Mais profundamente, mostra a "fragilidade" que existe nas rela??es, j que para para quebrar um "teto de vidro" de outra pessoa, tem-se que ter muita certeza da sua perfei??o, o que  quase impossvel.

I used to jump on the outside of my dads truck on the bar things they use to step up in them and ride and she would run by me barking and growling and not letting go of my shoe or pants and then growl at my dad for being the one driving when he got out of the car! lol, cracks me up!|`|71426c90338c6daa00b5005f598c343aaa	I personally don't, my little terrier would roll over and show her tummy to them - lol!  I took her off the streets, she was abandoned and had been treated badly, and she's scared of everything.  (Even the cat)    My mum's 2 dogs are another matter.  The German shepherd (Guinness) stays tied up - I think he would swallow in one gulp anyone who tried to harm any of our family!!!  He is the biggest shepherd I've ever seen!  And the Podenco (spanish hunting dog) is calmer, but puts people off going too close to the house!  She's very loud, and I'm sure she'd do a bit of damage if my son was in danger!!  She is a hunter, after all!|`|c977fc0c2d0200077bc63648813bf096aa	He wouldn't kill them, but he'd definately bark and make me aware that someone was trying to steal them.

Ele estava preso porque j havia cometido crimes no passado, foi julgado por isso e enfrentaria a pena de morte no dia seguinte... Mas como queriam provar que ele era somente um "doente perigoso", transferiram-no para outro local. Entretanto, os crimes estavam acontecendo realmente e s no ltimo instante  que foi revelado o seu instrumento assassino, que era o prprio garotinho, que matava desde o incio - a gente v isso no "flashback" que aparece quando ele surge no final para a jovem no campo de laranjas. As personalidades que ele mais usava, fora o garoto, era a do Ed Dakota, o ex-policial (John Cusack) e da referida mo?a, sendo que esses dois n?o matavam ningum. Agora, como  que tudo acontecia? No momento em que eram praticados os crimes, o psicopata manipulava o garoto atravs da TELEPATIA. Alis, lembra do momento em que o prisioneiro que estava algemado no banheiro conseguiu se soltar  e fugir? Percebeu como ele corrria, corria e foi parar no mesmo lugar de forma estranha, que nem ele entendeu? Ent?o, o vil?o da estria controlava as pessoas de longe atravs da mente!!!!   Se voc assistir de novo, ver isso com bastante clareza.|`|8258dc6f6d49f96b494b150d361370d5aa	nada aconteceu por q ele fantasiava as coisas...personagens, e cometia crimes com suas outras personalidades...ali foi um meio dos psiquiatras reunirem todas as indentidades dentro da cabe?a dele e destruilas(resumindo um filme confuso e uma porcaria)

Assim, meu nmero de amigos sempre aumenta,  j que sempre ganho amigos dos meus amigos.    Foi assim sempre.  Uns ganhei h tempos.  Outros s?o mais recentes.    E quem os deu n?o ficou sem eles,  pois amizade pode ser sempre dividida  sem nunca diminuir ou enfraquecer.    Pelo contrrio,  Quanto mais dividida mais aumenta.    E h mais vantagens na amizade:   uma das poucas coisas  que n?o custam nada mas valem muito,  embora n?o sejam vendveis!    Entretanto,   preciso que se cuide um pouco das amizades...    As mais recentes, por exemplo,  precisam de alguns cuidados.  Poucos,  verdade, mas indispensveis.     preciso mant-los com um certo calor,  cuidar, falar com eles.  Com o tempo eles crescem,  ficam fortes e suportam alguns trancos.    Os mais antigos, j slidos, n?o exigem muito n?o!  S?o como as mudas de plantas que,  depois de enraizadas, parecem viver sem cuidados,  porm n?o podem jamais ser esquecidas.  Algo  preciso para mant-las vivas.

You can go for a hike/mountain biking in the foothills.  Drive up to Bogus Basin and go mountain biking.  Go wander around downtown or Hyde Park.  Go fishing on the Boise River or the Snake River.  Bungie jump of the bridge on the way to Lucky Peak.  Go fishing/boating/water sking at Lucky Peak.  Go rock climbing on the small cliffs near Lucky Peak.  Drive up to the mountains...go for a hike and soak in the hot springs...  I could go on all day.|`|d13e28ec0f8488f329d563f0d92c0860aa	Sure!  Go outside the city and watch the potatoes grow.|`|AA11944625	Yeah.  I haven't lived in Boise for awhile.  So I can't think of much.  But I do remember that Edwards Cinema Complex was always crowded on the weekends.  If you don't like crowds, that's something good to know.  A popular place to go is Roaring Springs Waterpark or Boondocks (bumper boats, arcade, mini-golf, go karts, etc.).  Those places are near Meridian.  Also, here are a few websites you can browse.  Hope this helps.    http://www.boisechamber.org/ - Boise chamber of commerce (has a list of businesses)    http://www.boise.org/ - Boise convention & visitors website    http://www.downtownboise.org/ - downtown website    http://www.chamberhub.com/cgi/foxweb.dll... - calendar of events     http://www.boise.org/Calendar/ - calendar of events

One day he appeared to be very sad and depressed. Nurse Tracy  asked if there was anything wrong. Yes, Nurse Tracy," said Mr.   Goldstein, "My Private Part died today, and I am very sad." Knowing her   patients were forgetful and sometimes a little  crazy, she replied, "Oh,   I'm so sorry, Mr. Goldstein, please accept my condolences. The following   day, Mr Goldstein was walking down the hall with his Private Part hanging   out his pajamas, when he met Nurse Tracy. Mr. Goldstein," she said, "You   shouldn't be walking down the hall like that.. Please put your Private Part   back inside your pajamas." But, Nurse Tracy," replied Mr. Goldstein, " I   told you yesterday that my Private Part died." Yes, you did tell me that,   but why is it hanging out of your pajamas?"      You gotta love this!!!!!!!!!!!                Well, he replied, "Today's the viewing."|`|d5d6663721944ca7a75abccf6459b39eaa	Father Murphy walks into a pub in Donegal, and says to the first man he meets, "Do you want to go to heaven?"     The man said, "I do Father."     The priest said, "Then stand over there against the wall."     Then the priest asked the second man, "Do you want to got to heaven?"     "Certainly, Father," was the man's reply.     "Then stand over there against the wall," said the priest.     Then Father Murphy walked up to O'Toole and said, "Do you want to go to heaven?"     O'Toole said, "No, I don't Father."     The priest said, "I don't believe this. You mean to tell me that when you die you don't want to go to heaven?"     O'Toole said, "Oh, when I die, yes. I thought you were getting a group together to go right now."    Three blondes died and found themselves standing before St. Peter. He told them that before they could enter the Kingdom, they had to tell him what Easter represented.     The first blonde said, "Easter is a holiday where they have a big feast and we give thanks and eat turkey." St. Peter said, "Noooooo," and he banished her to Hell.     The second blonde said, "Easter is when we celebrate Jesus' birth and exchange gifts." Once again St. Peter said, "Noooooo," and banished her to Hell.     The third blonde said she knew what Easter was, and St. Peter said, "So, tell me." She said," Easter is a Christian holiday that coincides with the Jewish festival of Passover. Jesus was having Passover feast with his disciples when He was betrayed by Judas, and the Romans arrested him and hung him on the cross and eventually He died. Then they buried Him in a tomb behind a very large boulder...     St. Peter said, "Verrrrrry good." But the blonde continued, "Now, every year the Jews roll away the boulder and Jesus comes out. If he sees his shadow, we have six more weeks of basketball."     St. Peter fainted.    THE CLOCKS  A man dies and goes to heaven. He is greeted by St. Peter, who offers to give him a tour of heaven. As the man walks around, he notices many clocks. Some go very fast, while others move very slowly. When the tour is done, the man asks St. Peter why some clocks move at varied speeds. St. Peter replies, "Each clock represents a person. Every time you lie, your clock speeds up. As you can see, people's clocks are separated by career. Over here are teachers, and over there are doctors, for example." The man nods. "Where the politicians' clocks?" he asks. St. Peter replies, "We're using them in the back as air conditioners."|`|2f5bf75448f3e58be715392dcd0c9e28aa	Butt Bomber    UPI International  April 25, 2002  Kansas City    An American Airlines flight enroute from Los Angeles to JFK airport in New York City was diverted to Kansas City yesterday when a passenger was noticed attempting to light a fuse protruding from his rectum. Flight Attendant Bunny Haggarty said she noticed the man seated in an aisle seat leaning forward and holding a cigarette lighter behind his legs. I though he was just trying to light a fart, said Haggarty, like our pilots are always doing on layovers. Then I saw this string-like thing hanging from his ***, and I got scared. Haggarty immediately called for assistance.Several male passengers subdued the man before he was able to light the fuse.    After landing in Kansas City, authorities found the man's intestines were stuffed with military grade C4 explosive. FBI agents stated that it would have been a complete catastrophe if the passenger had succeeded in lighting the fuse.  The passenger, Mohammed Bin Ali El Batout Nabeel Sin Abba Rahim Mansour Ali Baba, Age 25, was carrying fourteen passports from various countries throughout the middle east. Asked why he had stuffed himself full of plastic explosives, Ali Baba stated, "I was planning to blow the **** out of the plane. I wanted to kill all the Americans and Jews to show that we are a peace loving people."    Airport security agents in Los Angeles remembered seeing Ali Baba as he boarded American flight 90. They were a bit concerned because his name would not fit on the front of the ticket, he was wearing a checkered  tablecloth as a hat, looked like he was ready to kill someone, was reading an Al Quaeda training manual and had on a "**** America" tee-shirt. According to Federal Airport Security standards, however, individuals cannot be profiled for additional security simply because they are young, middle-eastern men.    The security supervisor, Leroy Jackson, said he was somewhat concerned with the way Ali Baba walked. "Hell, man, the guy waddled like he had a stick of dynamite up his ***! Had I not been on the phone with my probation officer, I might have checked this guy out some more. But, we want and need complete diversity in our passenger screening," stated Jackson. "Plus, we think the flight crews on those planes pose more of a threat to safety than one raghead with an exploding ***."    "That1s why you can always find one of them pilots in bare feet waiting for his shoes to be x-rayed. I love seeing the look on their faces when we make them do that," he guffawed, adding, "I just hope they don1t give those guys guns, because they might want to even the score."     Federal officials are now referring to this latest terrorist attempt as a Obutt bomb. Security experts believe this could be even more difficult to detect than the primitive Oshoe bomb used by terrorist Richard Reid. I'm not sure how were going to check for Obutt bombs, stated Jackson. We don1t have technology to do it, but we1ve got to check somehow in the interest of safety, adding, I think we should start with Flight Crews first.|`|349c2929c91beef4f69f2abe1b03b565aa	when james died he went to heaven and st peter gave him a tour. on the tour james saw that heaven was full of daises tons of them. at least 5 every sq foot there were a lot. at the end of the tour james ask st peter what the daises were for.st peter replied here in heaven we have one rule dont step on a daise if you stepp on a daise then youll be forever connected to the ugliest grossest most disgusting member of the opposite sex. so james went around haeven for years without stepping on a daise but then one day st peter called on him and he was then connected to a beautiful woman he was very confused he sed i didnt do anything wrong what did you do she sed i stepped on a daise|`|78ca2671ee8a089d9e52eca0d68c4223aa	There's these four friends and each have different education levels.

AA10065620	Even though you already said you are going to pick a "Best," I am going to answer anyway because I like the question!    I think I am most like a strawberry.  Sometimes I am sweet and sometimes I can be wild.  I am a romantic at heart.  I like sun all the time!!  I am very independent and I don't need a lot of nurturing to get through the day, but I could never go through life alone.  I have a very short attention span, so once you pick me if you don't interest me right away chances are by the time you come back I'm not going to be as sweet... Oh, and I go very well with chocolate ;)    Cute question!!|`|3f33b216ece5ed7b1cc0346d9c6a69d8aa	APPLE  >>>>red as my lips  >>>>same facial shape  >>>>juicy like me|`|AA10705298	a tomato!!!

The pear is also very sturdy at the bottom; well grounded, etc. At the top, it tapers off, it's got its head in the clouds a bit.

You can also find practically any other series by doing this, as well.  Manga can more easily be accessed through mIRC, but are also available in .torrent files or direct downloads.  Here's what you have to do; it shouldn't take long to get the hang of.      First, download a Bittorrent client such as BitComet or Azureus.    Then go to a torrent tracker such as mininova.org or torrentspy.com and run a search on what you want. An anime specific torrent database such as Boxtorrents.com should have the Naruto episodes in "bundles" by season, and that will save you the time and trouble of having to click each individual link.    Once you find the .torrent file you want, click the link and the program you have just downloaded should automatically open up the file. Select which file directory you would like it to be downloaded to, and then click "Okay." The download should start immediately and resume as long as you have an internet connection and the program is open.    However, you must be patient, as these files are around 140 MB an episode. The torrents are generally very active though, with a good seeder to leecher ratio, so you should be okay.      Good luck!

d0c25bc7eaec9354a574689b839cdf8baa	From the beginning, the whole concept of these movies is that they fell into another dimention, (what if  the world was ruled by apes and not humans?) so just like he fell into another dimention in ther first place and then tried to get back, he escapes one world (dimention) and ends up into another.  There is no giong back to the real world.  The world he knew before no longer exists.  He will forever travel dimention to dimention, hence the sequels that bored us to death in the 80's.

Mas como tudo que a Globo mostra, o concurso de dan?a dos famosos  mais uma cpia muito mal-feita de um original americano.    A vers?o daqui, o original, se chama "Dancing With The Stars," ou seja, Dan?ando Com As Estrelas. Eu PRECISO te dizer que a vers?o americana  MIL VEZES melhor? Olha, americano pode ser tudo, pode achar que  dono do mundo e tal, mas na hora de produzir um show eles s?o nmero um. Sim, gastam rios de dinheiro com essas produ??es. Isso n?o se discute. Mas que sai uma coisinha melhor, ah isso sai.    Quer minha opini?o? Eles deveriam retirar esse quadro por completo do programa do Faust?o e fazer como aqui, um concurso em um local apropriado para dan?as de sal?o e mostr-lo como um show independente. Independente fisicamente da figura inoportuna e irritante do apresentador Faust?o! Eu acredito que os artistas iriam agradecer muito essa mudan?a!    Se eu acho que isso pode ou vai acontecer? Claro que n?o. O Faust?o  muito mais importante para os "bolsos globais" do que fazer algo que preste de verdade e presentear ao pblico.

Picking between the alto and the tenor isn't easy but it's gotta come down to your preference.  As someone else mentioned, the alto is smaller, lighter, cheaper and has cheaper reeds so if price is your main criteria - go for the alto. But if a lower more mellow and less piercing sound I prefer the tenor. The hardest part is getting your mouth-position (ombechure) right and sorting out the right fingering for the notes but once you get that down pat, you will have to trouble switching between alto and tenor because they are really similar. If you want to be really different you could even try a soprano, baritone or sopranino when you feel confident.  You might want to shop around a few music stores, they will let you try the instruments before you buy them so get a feel for which one YOU feel more comfortable with.  Yamaha is a fantastic brand for beginners, their student models are affordable and reliable. And as a rule of thumb, don't buy any brand that has feathers or swims! ; )  Good luck!    edit: I've never had a problem with Rico Royal reeds but Vandoren's are the best (unfortunately expensive too) A cheap reed will give you a horrible sound so don't be stingy or you will find it hard to get going :)|`|AA11481691	technique wise they are identical. learn to play one learn to play them all.    All of the really great famous jazz saxophonist played the tenor. (I am talking about greats like coltrane, not kenny G)|`|a3d08f9b4634faf5267008cc16f472bdaa	Alto is better... though I'm biased, because I play one.    But if you're beginning a wind instrument, alto is the way to go... thinner and cheaper reeds, less air required to play, smaller mouthpiece (so it's easier to control sound) and it's lighter in weight... and also cheaper to buy, if that's the case.    If you want to move to tenor, go ahead, but I recommend you start with alto and move up if you're not used to playing wind instruments and having them hang from your neck.    And I would also recommend a Yamaha if you're willing to not go for the cheapest ones like Bundys.    And stay away from Rico reeds!    Good luck, hope I helped a lil. :)|`|fa1f0ff34840916f6609e8b56cee92ecaa	I am in my last year of middle school I am qutting band now to try some new thing but in the 6th grade I played the trumpet and bartione and in the 7th I played the tenor saxphone I wanted to play the alto sax but they had to many players so I would pick the alto sax because it is smaller but it depends on what you like but the reeds cost less on alto sax to save some bucks

39712e1a01845d9d87ed4652829c33d2aa	I don't think  that most of the answers you got were about that you offended people.  I know that most people my age remember  what it was like trying to get to know yourself and like who that person is.  It takes a while, and it can be very emotionally stressful.  Calm down, take a deep breath, and really look at yourself.  What do you like about yourself?  What don't you like about yourself?  Who are you really?  Not the person you are when you are around your friends, your family, or anyone else.  The person you are when you're all alone?  What is it about that person that you would like to change?  What is it  about that person that you like?  You see, in one way or another, most people have had some point in their lives when they had to find the answers to these questions.  If you have started to ask them, then it's about time that you started to answer them.  Just remember that everyone was  young once.  It wasn't easy for anyone and it won't be for you.  It should be fun some of the time, though, and you should try to never forget that.|`|AA10849700	Hey not everyone is perfect. You'd be surprised what kind of flaws some people actually have. Everyone has weaknesses as hard as that is to seem. Sometimes beautiful people have the worse qualities and are just as unhappy as everyone else. I know this one girl whos pretty and thinks shes perfect and that everyone loves her when people actually call her brick behind her back (because shes stupid/ditzy). Try doing something for yourself and do things that make you happy. If people are bringing down then they arent the right people to be around. Smile and be happy as hard as that is right now. Things will always get better.|`|AA11015519	just try to think positive about yourself, be with positive family and friends, maybe go see a therapist and talk with them.|`|44fde7161b03d265135a97896632d0d6aa	The moment you quit worrying about what other people think is the moment in which you will finally feel good about yourself.

AA10026790	Trenji TRENJI.....Sorry when I first heard that I thought they said Tranny.  Any way they danced to the song Gyrate here is a little extra info for you also.    Benji and Travis get to dance together to a Shane Sparks hip hop. As they are calling themselves "Trenji," Shane notes that the guys either have different abilities, and he wants to highlight that. They dance to Gyrate by Da Muzicianz feat. Mr. Collipark. This dance features the two guys as "geeks" with backpacks and dorky clothes, but once they're done bumping into each other, they start gyrating their bodies, then move into a really cool backwards flip going over each other. It's a cute dance, and seems to do just what Shane wanted.|`|AA12321703	I dont know but their dance was awsome!!! it was totally hip hop/ nerdy!!

O engra?ado era que nesta fase, que foram poucas, o personagem passava quase que o desenho inteiro de sunga.   Mas as famosas cal?as roxas voltaram e contrariando certa lgica, permanecem at hoje.Talvez o bom Doutor tenha desenvolvido uma cal?a com o mesmo material da sunga, ou talvez, tenha pedido ajuda ao Dr. Reed Richards.

AA10084738	Music has been a rich source of entertainment since the ages. It still continues to throb the hearts of many. In todays advanced technological world there are many gadgets which are kept by the users with them always like I-pod, walkman etc. There was time of Cassettes, CDs, DVDs and now is the time of recording music in USB drives and listening to it at ur leisure time. Sometimes we need to buy music chores and sometimes we get it free from our friends or relatives. Internet is gaining ground everyday in everybodys life. Life is, slowly, becoming incomplete without Internet. Internet is a rich source of music too. It provides music, paid and free, both.

The story of the wall was written by Roger Waters and it describes a really dark point that i think a lot of ppl have been to, it's about building a wall around yourself to protect yourself from ppl who only love you and you end up losing yourself behind it...forgetting about the reality of living and Comfortably Numb describes a really dark point in that.

Ah! n?o ligue para as pessoas que n?o acreditam em horscopo, Ns acreditamos, e, da?|`|d2e479db68397b5b33f0eccfb9306503aa	O Geminiano    Jamais procure por ele at o vir chegar- e n?o tente imped-lo quando ele quiser partir. Uma vez que tenha aprendido a aceitar seu temperamento agitado e imprevisvel, h probabilidade de que tudo corra bem. Nunca sabers quando e onde ele vai estar num determinado momento.    Voc ter sempre duas ou mais pessoas a acompanha-l (lo), e todas ser?o ele mesmo.  O nativo de Gmeos  um conversador maravilhoso e agradvel. Tem um gosto delicado,  cheio de observa??es inteligentes. Mestre impecvel em maneiras e desembara?o social, ele mantm a "festa" animada em todos os sentidos.    Quando o vir pela primeira vez, exibindo sua mltipla e fascinante personalidade, ficar convencida (o) de que  o homem ou a mulher mais excitante, interessante e inteligente que cruzou seu caminho. Nele contm multid?es.    Voc ser totalmente hipnotizado (a) por seus conhecimentos e interesses variados. O Geminiano  terno, cheio de sonhos e esperan?as e pedir voc em casamento. Assim, como um relampago. E a voc estar junto a um enigma.    Ele tem uma necessidade consciente de disfar?ar suas verdadeiras inten??es, de se esquivar dos outros e ocultar suas raz?es com atitudes duplas, pois tem medo de se magoar. Ent?o, com sua consistente caracterstica, se torna t?o direto que deixa voc pasma com sua franqueza e impetuosidade.    Am-la (lo)  fcil e divertido, desde que n?o se queira aprofundar muito nela (e). Existe uma essncia interior que pertence apenas a ela (e), e que jamais partilhar com algum.    O Geminiano se apega a lembran?as antigas, lugares e pessoas. Magoa-se com muita facilidade, tamanho  o medo de sofrer que chegam a usar uma prote??o que ningum consegue ultrapassar enquanto n?o deixarem,  n?o ser que estejam amando uma pessoa, ent?o esta sim ter permiss?o, mas ainda que desconfiados. Durante um longo perodo de solid?o, ele pode derramar algumas lgrimas, mas isto  decorrncia da solid?o e n?o da saudade.    Normalmente, a generosidade vence sem esfor?o. O Geminiano tem pouco desejo de acumular, quer dinheiro ou outras coisas, exceto conhecimentos. Em cada caso ele preferir absorv-los, separ-los, e devolv-los melhorados. Gmeos  o comunicador cuja fun??o consiste em ter idias sempre novas e originais e servir aos outros atravs da versatilidade de seus processos mentais rpidos e brilhantes.    Ser lhe a fiel? At debaixo d'gua.  tambm estranhamente atraente para os homens ou mulheres, de modo que s vezes pode dar ensejo a comentrios e suspeitas. Para ele, a comunica??o  uma coisa natural, que independe do sexo do interlocutor. Se for mentalmente harmonizada com um geminiano, jamais precisar temer uma infidelidade emocional ou fsica.    E isto  absolutamente verdadeiro. Agora, esperar que ele n?o retribua um sorriso quando algum ri para ele, seja uma crian?a ou um adulto, um homem ou uma mulher,  o mesmo que esperar que o sol n?o brilhe. N?o tente sufoc-lo (a). Quando algum procura confinar o esprito de um geminiano ele pode se tornar t?o enganoso e imprevisvel quanto o prprio vento.    Ser um grande companheiro para os filhos. Ele sabe como amar sem oprimir. Afetuoso e jovial com os filhos, n?o os obrigar a seguir uma rotina, j que ele prprio detesta isso. O cime  algo com que voc jamais ter de se preocupar, pois o exclusivismo n?o  um de seus tra?os tpicos.  claro que um certo grau de cimes  natural em todo mundo, porm n?o ser exagerado nele. O amor com ele n?o  um relacionamento estritamente fsico. Ele ouve, v e sente mais atravs dos seus sentidos do que qualquer outro, e registra vividamente as mais delicadas impress?es.    Seu amor  t?o areo e indefinvel que parece carecer da paix?o terrena. Falar de suas emo??es com frases romanticas e imaginosas, e saciar a fome de seu cora??o com a estranha beleza de seu idealismo. Lembre-se de que a tpica frieza emocional dele pode ser aquecida se vocs dois ouvirem a mesma msica e sonharem os mesmos sonhos. O Geminiano deve experimentar um total entrosamento da mente e do esprito, antes das emo??es se tornarem intensas.    Muitas vezes voc ler ou ouvir que o homem ou a mulher de Gmeos precisa ter dois amores ao mesmo tempo. Mas preste bastante aten??o: ele precisa de dois amores, n?o de dois homens ou duas mulheres.  uma charada. Se voc a decifrar, ser imensamente feliz ao lado desta mulher ou deste homem.|`|026ff1f2c50e2460dce0c42b044f3914aa	OS homens desse signo prezam a comunica??o em primeiro lugar,p por isso use um bom papo, e demonstre ser uma garota culta e inteligente.

815a909e1b0bb5bbe17e9bb6f00d4b20aa	El significado de los numeros aun no se ha revelado y creo que no lo sabremos por un tiempo ya que es uno de los misterios ejes de la serie.  Lo que si sabemos es que:  1) Hurley se los escuch repetir a un interno del psiquitrico y los jug a la lotera y desde ese momento todo le fue mal, por lo que el cree que esos numeros estn malditos.  2) Es la secuencia numerica que debe tipearse (o que deba) antes que el contador de la escotilla llegue a cero (la secuencia sumada es = a 108, como los minutos del contador) para soltar la carga electromagnetica acumulada en la isla.  3) son las coordenadas seguidas por Russeau (la francesa) por la cual se estrey con su barco en la isla.  4) aparecen en todos lados: en el suero que se inyecta Desmond, en la puerta de la escotilla y los numeros sueltos en cada detalle en los que aparecen numeros (el vuelo 8 15, el salmo 23, 42 sobrevivientes, etc).    De todas formas existen  teoras (en diferentes foros) donde a mucha gente se le ocurrieron cosas muy creativas y que algunas podrian llegar a ser la definitiva, la que usen en LOST para explicar el significado.    Algunas teorias:   1)La constelacion M42: una constelacion que forma un dibujoa partir de una tabla numerica y esta al proyectarse en el mapa de la isala indica algo.  2)La teoria de que todos tenemos u ndoble en el mundo y como juegan los numeros en esto. Esta teoria es muy rara pero no esta mal.  3) que son una direcion IP.  4) que son letras codificadas.  5) que es una formula quimica.  6) que son coordenadas.  7) que traducidos a letras es un anagrama de Alvar Hanso.    Hay muchisima info pero no toda es coherente.  Ojala lo sepamos pronto.|`|a599a782ac2a53e6607cca703b5c0806aa	Creo que es la combinacin de la Lotera Primitiva que quiero que me toque ya para tener el BMW YA!|`|04cc79fb81cf60a5ce026b03953db062aa	ni idea    yo creo que la temporada 1 fue la mejor  la temporada 2 mas o menos    pero sospecho que la tercera va a decaer mucho  no se porque tengo esa idea|`|383aa04f8ad808039ed001529855e1dfaa	que numeros??? los de la cuenta regresiva, los de la computadora, que tenia hurley en la mente o ...|`|5b5015725df8111afa65443a258c0d64aa	lo que yo entendi es que esos numeros son esotericos y al usarlos atrae la mala suerte, aunque no han dicho nada mas de ellos tambien tiene que ver con el bunquer que encontro lot, aunque personalmente yo creo que en la tercera temporada van a salir con alguna jalada ya que se les fue la idea de los numeros|`|14409995978a0f26d9a8bf1dce9c7700aa	te recomiendo las siguientes paginas para esto y mas    www.lostpedia.org  www.4815162342.com  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)    y una de las teoras mas interesantes es la siguiente de lo que significan     googlesightseeing.com/2005/11/05/4-8-1...    aunque en realidad nadie sabe|`|72643a9e202829bfd200fe7b32a05e1faa	Mira yo soy uno de tantos seguidores de la seria Lost y la verdad eso de los numeros me tiene intrigado.

Los numeros estan en las botellas que Desmond se inyecta.  Los numeros estaban fuera de la escotilla antes de dinamitarla.  Los numeros correspondes a los pasajeros del avion.

Lo que si han dicho los creadores es que el tiempo transcurre a diferente velocidad en la isla y que veremos mas del mundo externo en el presente durante las proximas dos temporadas (ya que JJ Abrams dice que est planeada para 4 temporadas y cuando mucho 5)  http://www.lostpedia.org|`|2f6ac15d06528980e1a10ce40c3a8af3aa	pues como que me suena a extraterrestres o algo asi|`|572cb9ab860cbc7a31c8046b3d7ad6e4aa	No se puede saber por que todavia faltan mas temporadas apenas van en la 2.

81340f533010be5c5cbe492b7757007daa	Oh Georgie Boy, siempre con tus preguntas ingenuas,   no ves que los homicidas, fanaticos, depravados, enfermos mentales, estan entre nosotros, son personas simples, comunes y corrientes, quienes menos te esperas, eso, combinado con una sociedad que impone un cierto tipo de reglas y un estilo de juego, el que piensa no encaja, es un desadaptado, Alex era muy inteligente, pero no sabia como expresarlo, usus padres aunque lo amaban no hacien auna familia, no hablaban , no se comunicaban por eso creo que paso todo eso|`|0a17275393c09ab06951a5ae3677c7b2aa	pues coincido con lo que dicen los demas  pero en el libro...has de cuenta que empieza de nuevo- pero con otros amigos. por k sus ex amigos pues uno se murio el otro sigue siendo policia.  entonces salen a una noche de "ultraviolencia" y el entra a un bar cuando ve a una mujer hermosa.!!!!!y se da cuenta que el hombre con quien esta es Pete su ex amigo....y este le platico que trabaja y bla bla bla que tiene una vida normal y que esta casado, hay alex se da cuenta que no todo es violencia...y decide cambiar a ser alguien como Pete...que trabaja y pensar en casarse-.---  saca tus conclusiones|`|14409995978a0f26d9a8bf1dce9c7700aa	Ese es el punto de la pelcula y la tesis del director en esta pelicula, demostrar que la sociedad en si nos hace, si no quieres que te aplasten tienes que ser fuerte y aplastar a los dems, muestra de ello es el final, como despus de la terapia de aversin a la violencia la misma sociedad lo arrastra a la violencia|`|6ec2c591ef9a4182cb1d69e5768f2060aa	Yo creo que la tesis principal de la pelicula es la idea del "LIBRE ALBEDRIO", si te fijas el personaje de Alex nunca muestra arrepentimiento hasta que por medio del tratamiento de adversin a la violencia le hacen ver y sentir lo mal que actuaba.  Y finalmente termina siendo una victima del sistema, y nos plantea la duda de hasta donde se tiene el derecho de decidir lo que se quiere hacer, que es lo que esta bien y lo que esta mal.  Es una excelente pelicula, en la que puedes o no estar de acuerdo con el personaje principal, el lo personal NO estoy de acuerdo con Alex, pero no puedo negar su derecho a elegir.|`|0bdc46da1ab634f716e4c64f590f9051aa	NO LA ESCOGE;  ESTA EN CADA UNO DE NOSOTROS.

44b0764220f7482974b43cc84767845faa	El reguetn o reggaeton es una variante del raggamuffin, que a su vez desciende del reggae, influido por el hip hop. Las particularidades del reggaeton son sus letras en los hablas locales del espa?ol y su influencia de otros estilos latinos, como la bomba y la salsa.    El reggaetn pas de ser gnero clandestino, a la nica msica que se escuchaba en sistemas de audio con gran bajo, dando a su vez un auge en "equipos de msica" en todo tipo de autos. La comercializacin dio paso a las tiraeras; Dj's enemigos con su bando de cantantes o corillos comenzaran una guerra lrica, donde se fue escalando la enemistad y la rencilla    Se sigui escuchando el ritmo, ya popular entre la juventud, que lleg a calar en los sentidos rtmicos del resto de Amrica latina y los Estados Unidos, lo que le ha dado una posicin no esperada para un gnero que en el a?o 2000 se consider en penumbra.    A partir de ese a?o entr en su momento de apogeo, conocindose el estilo en mltiples pases, como por ejemplo: Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, Espa?a, Repblica Dominicana, Estados Unidos, Puerto Rico, entre otros. El grupo peruano Los Kalibres ha conseguido xito en Japn.    El reggaetn es un estilo de msica popular entre los jvenes de muchos pases de Amrica Latina, en especial de los pases caribe?os, siendo fcil de bailar y provocando movimientos muy sensuales. Lneas de bajo y un ritmo repetitivo (casi clnico en todas sus canciones) es caracterstico en el reggaetn.    Tiene una sincronizacin caracterstica por la cual se guan la mayora de las canciones, dando una referencia fcil para el baile.    Las lricas del reggaetn se caracterizan por apoyarse en la rima para lograr que la cancin sea pegadiza y de fcil identificacin para el pblico.    Otra caracterstica del reggaetn son las voces estridentes, que son distorsionadas con equipos electrnicos, agregando un suave eco que le da ms poder a cada palabra pronunciada (tipo dub, por ejemplo).    Las voces cumplen una funcin importante, inclusive a veces tomando el rol de la msica. Sus letras no estn muy elaboradas pero cumplen con su funcin. Los temas de las letras en un origen eran de denuncia social, pero con el paso del tiempo ha ido derivando en un tipo de letras mucho ms comerciales.    Tan importante es la voz del cantante como el disc jockey (DJ) que mezcla la msica. El xito de una cancin de reggaeton depender de una armona entre ambos (dj y cantante) y de una letra pegadiza. As de importante es el DJ que por lo general al inicio de las canciones, los cantantes nombran al o a los DJ's que mezclan la msica en la cancin.    Las letras del reggaetn, suelen ser muy simples, abundando sobre todo las que aluden al sexo.    En ocasiones este tema es manejado de forma discreta y en otras la letra es sexualmente explcita. El lxico que se emplea est lleno de modismos populares que le dan jocosidad o melancola segn sea el caso. Tambin, algunas de sus letras son calificadas por sus crticos como machistas y simples. Sin embargo, algunas canciones tienen contenido amoroso y sentimental, como por ejemplo, "Aunque te fuiste" de Don Omar, o "Tu prncipe" de Daddy Yankee feat. Zion y Lenox, o "Dile Mar" de Divino dndole as un toque romntico al reggaetn.    El reggaetn se suele asociar a una forma de bailar muy "sensual", con los cuerpos muy pegados, llamada a veces perreo (doggy style)    Algunos sectores consideran de mal gusto el llegar a emular posturas sexuales; pero por otro lado, muchos opinan que el reggaetn es, en cierto modo, un estilo musical descarado, como hacer el amor con ropa sobre una pista de baile (cosa que es un objeto risible para sus crticos).    El ritmo del reggeton es criticado por ser simple y repetitivo, de fcil consumo para los jvenes. La letras del regueton son criticadas, tambin, por ser sexualmente explcitas y denigrar a la mujer, convirtindola en un objeto sexual    Espero q aclare tus dudas ;)  Mil besos :***|`|4b73ccd7935d99a1b9fe87c8e7c0c544aa	Del basureo, jejejejejejejeje, es la peor combinacion de sonidos (eso no es musica) que he oido, wacala.|`|4fdff79adb376e27b0a25aa18898e04daa	Para algunos es original de Puerto Rico mientras otros defienden que lo es de Panam.

Actually, the entire NFC North is looking very weak.  I'm a life-long Packers fan, but I think the Vikings are looking better, or at least less bad.  In the pre-season, the Packer secondary hasn't been able to stop long passes, and the offensive line has been absolutely awful, not being able to pass protect or establish holes to get a running game going.  The Vikings have a mediocre offense without any stars, but that's probably better than the Packer offense, which an o-line that can't protect it's aging stars, Farve & Green.|`|af7ea9c87d0b412740d8d4e7552940b6aa	greenbay packers|`|fcd5587612716d4b7fb10885ab74902baa	Go Green Day Packers!

I had to do a list of 10, sorry \m/    Scar Symmetry - Pitch Black Progress (2006)  Communic - Conspiracy In Mind (2005)  Spastic Ink - Ink Compatible (2004)  Orphaned Land - Mabool (2004)  Haggard - Eppur Si Muove (2004)  Zero Hour - Metamorphosis (2003)  Edge of Sanity - Crimson II (2003)  Pain of Salvation - Remedy Lane (2002)  King Diamond - Abigail II, The Revenge (2002)  Sentenced - Crimson (2000)    Tried to name some lesser-known bands.  I repeat, I really think it's impossible to name a Top 5 (or 10) of the millennium.  Ask about a specific year, and I might be able to narrow it down!

It's a little closer to the "straightman/dumb guy" comedy that Abbot and Costello done.  Here's a link about it:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzai|`|4d3c8995491041f5125a3e89314692acaa	Elwin's probably got a point there. I'll just add that I think that every culture does have its physical comedians and its low-brow comedians. Sometimes people don't necessarily appreciate them as much as their higher-brow cohorts. Maybe it's because it might not seem to take as much effort to watch someone get hit in the groin with a baseball bat or fart during church. But those types of things are still funny to Western culture.  Think about the popularity of TV shows like Jackass and movies like Dumb and Dumber. Many of those shows contained completely low-brow comedy routines. It might be a throw back to watching the old silent movie comedians slipping on a banana peel.     As sad and twisted as it might be, there's just something a little funny about somebody else getting hurt (but not permanently disfigured--that would fall into dark humor).|`|516b5e9ab7dc5eaf4c46a55ba738b9c5aa	I think you're referring to slapstick...     Slapstick is a type of comedy involving exaggerated physical violence. (E.g., A character being hit in the face with a frying pan or pie, getting matches lit between the toes, or running full-speed into a wall.) The style is common to those genres of entertainment in which the audience is supposed to understand the very hyperbolic nature of such violence to exceed the boundaries of common sense and thus license non-cruel laughter. Its greatest modern representations thus lie in cartoons and the simple, amplified film comedies aimed at younger audiences. Though the term is often used pejoratively, the performance of slapstick comedy, based on exquisite timing and unerring calculation of execution, character reaction and audience laughter, is considered among the more difficult tasks facing a live performer.    There lots of coemedians who use it... not only japanese people...|`|e24869809705d10114e329e649ff61deaa	wc

Just enter the band name of the band you like, and it will show you the most popular songs, and other artists that people listening to Muse listen to. Searching there, it seems Radiohead and Coldplay are the most popular.     You can also look at Amazon.com, which keeps track of what albums people who bought a Muse album bought.

Devono solo avere un bel fisico perch il loro unico ruolo e di tenere i maschietti attaccati allo schermo e lo fanno,no? l'importante e che poi non si lamentano di essere trattate come donne oggetto|`|6009c3a025ebb508e280029ec6778686aa	Non  richiesto per essere veline.  Se una ha fatto danza sul serio non credo che faccia la velina.  Poi quello che fanno, anche se sapessero ballare bene, glielo impongono.  Una ex velina di striscia, gi fidanzata con Vieri sta diventando una signora attrice.

E' un serial coinvolgente, ha una trama semplice, ma intrigante, e in ogni puntata aggiungono un tassello di ogni personaggio. Sono tutti fantastici, ottimi attori, a partire da Hugh Laurie, che ha dimostrato di essere un ottimo attore passando dalla commedia inglese a una serie come questa. Inoltre, credo che nel suo genere, sia il telefilm pi accurato, cio, le malattie diagnosticate sono rarissime, ma purtroppo vere, ed  pi che giustificabile il fatto che le trovano tutte loro perch si tratta di un centro specifico di ricerca. Ormai in tv vedo solo quello, e non vedo l'ora che sia domenica per gustarmelo in santa pace. W house! ciao!

Vou procurar e volto pra te dizer t.    ... [depois de ter pesquisado um pouco]    Olha o que eu encontrei, super interessante:      The History of Visa ( A Histria do Visa)    A histria do Visa  a mesma histria da indstria de pagamentos eletr?nicos. A Compania Visa sempre reconheceu que pagamentos eletr?nicos tiveram e tem uma profunda e positiva influncia na vida de indivduos, companias e economias.    De Inspira??o a Organiza??o: As Origens do Visa  A era de pagamentos eletr?nicos se iniciou em 1958 quando o Bank of America lan?ou um programa pioneiro, o BankAmericard, em Fresno no estado americano da Califrnia. Uma dcada mais tarde, Dee Hock, um dos lderes de um dos grupos de bancos que retinham licen?as para operar com o BankAmericard, prop?s que esses bancos formassem uma associa??o, um negcio em conjunto que proporcionaria membros o direito de participar dos benefcios de um sistema centralizado de pagamentos, enquanto competindo dentro das regras estipuladas pelos seus interesses individuais.    Hock se tornou o primeiro presidente dessa nova entidade financeira. Em 1970 o Bank of America transferiu o controle e a posse do BankAmericard para a recm-formada NBI (National BankAmericard, Inc.)    Em 1976, a NBI substituiu o nome BankAmericard pelo nome VISA, um nome simples, fcil de ser lembrado e pronunciado exatamente da mesma forma em todas as lnguas do mundo.    _________________    Traduzi isso do site abaixo. Agora imagine que golpe de MESTRE! Eles colocaram um nome na compania e no cart?o que TODOS os pases do mundo pronunciam exatamente da mesma maneira! Muito bom!

Afinal os Judeus n?o aceitam Jesus como filho de Deus, e Moiss  a figura mais conhecida na comunidade Judaica.

Conforme foi crescendo, ele descobriu que tinha poderes diferentes dos humanos normais. Quando n?o est lutando contra o mal, ele vive como Clark Kent, reprter do Planeta Dirio. Jesus Cristo nasceu de Maria e foi adotado por Jos (q antes disso foi avisado pelo anjo Gabriel do q iria acontecer, at mesmo pq Jos iria repudiar Maria, gra?as ao anjo n?o o fez). Clark Kent tem duas faces: Jesus Cristo uma s. N?o tinha outro tipo de vida, primeiro cresceu como carpinteiro e depois abandonou para pregar o evangelho, n?o fez as duas coisas ao mesmo tempo nem escondeu sua identidade!    4) Superman n?o foi morto! Seu pai antes do planeta explodir enviou ele pra Terra pra n?o acontecer tal coisa. Portanto Superman n?o ressucitou! E Deus n?o enviou seu Filho Jesus pra escapar da morte no seu planeta, mas sim, pra salvar a humanidade.

A esposa do falecido Jerry Siegel, diz que ela tem repetidamente ouvido a respeito da rela??o judaica ao Super-Homem. O Jornal "Jerusalem Post" cita Daniel Schifrin da Federa??o Nacional para Cultura Judaca nos EUA, em sua frase: "Quanto mais velho eu fico, mais eu vejo que existe algo profundamente judeu no Super-Homem, que ele  um de ns". Ele completa dizendo: "Como Clark Kent ns temos sido Judeus diasporados por muito tempo, sendo visto como tmidos e estudiosos, quando muito guerreiros hebreus brbaros fazendo a obra de Deus".  Se h ou n?o alguma tentativa de mensagem subliminar, escusa, nessa cria??o do Superman, eu n?o sei. Creio que n?o.   Concordo com quem disse que n?o se pode comparar Superman com Jesus. Mas, quem est comparando? Voc est apenas levantando fatos que a est?o para quem quiser ver. Coincidncias? Claro que n?o, como o incio de minha resposta esclarece. Mas, sua observa??o nos mostra como temos que estar atentos a possiveis mensagens subliminares, venham estas de onde virem, e para estarmos atentos a isto, temos que estar despidos de preconceitos.

Eles se inspiraram na verdade em MOISS, e n?o em Jesus. Moiss  o profeta mais adorado pelo povo judeu, por isso faz mais sentido se referir a ele que a Cristo.    Amigo de Deus se faz mais lgico pra Moiss que pro filho de dele, estou certo?    A histria do foguete  pra assemelhar ao fato do profeta ser enviado em um cesto pelo Nilo (cesto no nilo, foguete no espa?o - e nenhum dos 'pais' era divino, apenas queria livrar o filho de uma praga maior).  Beleza?

Fiz faculdade com o Tato e sei que esse comportamento pblico n?o condiz com ele. Alm do mais, a qualidade das imagens  pssima, n?o d para identificar nem a Cicarelli, nem o Tato ali. Outros detalhes da farsa:  1. O Tato tem uma tatuagem no bra?o esquerdo. O "Tato" do vdeo n?o tem.  2. A Cicarelli  mais alta que a "Cicarelli" do vdeo.  3. O Tato usa um colar estilo africano que n?o tira de jeito nenhum e que no vdeo foi substitudo por um dourado.  4. Certos detalhes do vdeo s poderiam ser captados se o cinegrafista estivesse com a camera bem prxima ou acima do casal, como algumas cenas no mar.  5. De onde surgiu o tecido com o qual o "Tato" cobre-se ao sair do mar?  6. O Tato e a Cicarelli foram, sim, para Cdiz, na Espanha, sendo, inclusive fotografados em cenas de carinho, o que  normal entre casais. Comparando essas fotos com o vdeo percebe-se claramente que as roupas que eles usam s?o diferentes.

Se perfil el protagonismo de dos ciudades, Esparta y Atenas, con modelos de organizacin poltica extremos entre el rgimen aristocrtico y la democracia.    En la antigua Grecia los edificios estaban financiados por el estado y este se preocupaba por embellecer la ciudad. En Atenas la capital de la antigua Grecia, destacan varios edificios por su arquitectura, estos son el Partenn, el Erecteion y el templo de Atenea.    Cabe destacar las artes, aquitectura... En fin, Todo!    De Roma tenemos el idioma y los acueductos, aparte estoy enojado con los romanos, pues cuando hicieron la conquista de Alejandra quemaron muchos libros con contenido mdico, algunos, muy pocos, fueron rescatados por los musulmanes quienes se encargaron de traducirlo al rabe, como la Anatoma de Galeno.    Seguramente entre esos libros haban avances de lo que era la Anatoma pero los romanos se dedicaron a hacerlo pedazos.|`|0265c2c10aef4cffe2e197ba09431ecaaa	Evidentemente, que ambas culturas nos influenciaron; de Grecia, nos vino los juegos, s, la medicina la astronomia, la poltica..., y de Roma, evidentemente, las lenguas que derivan de su raz, los juegos de ocio, la tipologia de la vivienda alrededor de un patio -como los claustros de los monasterios-, la iconografa religosa: el cristianismo a la romana -hered el uso de las imagenes paganas convirtiendolas en cristianas-, el divorcio...;   pero creo que hay ms culturas que pasaron por Hispania, fueron las que dieron forma a la actualidad. Los impuestos y su recaudacin al erario pblico, o sea, la Declaracin de la Renta, sali de los rabes. Cuando ocupaban un territorio para islamizarlo, imponan unos impuestos a pagar a los no-rabes. Esos impuestos servian para la caridad de su comunidad y para la construccin de edificios.  De los Godos -visigodos- salieron las leyes de uso comn.   Se cree que de los Etruscos, la cuadrcula de las calles;y para ir ms all, de los mesopotamios, el ritual de "la primera piedra".|`|17fa724e91ce5f675e7e5157cda1a86eaa	los romanos, al invadir grecia, asimilaron todo su arte, religion y ciencia, se podria decir que fuimos influenciados directamente por roma e indirectamente por grecia|`|0ca9f711f08b0b6fdd3a622155428f3aaa	La respuesta nunca podra ser clara ni sencilla  La verdad, es que a Roma la influencio muchisimo Grecia, en especial entre el a?o 100 AC y el 300 DC incluso Neron compitio en los juegos olimpicos porque admiraba a esta cultura  La influencia se da especialmente en la filosofia y las bellas artes  Como roma es la principal influencia que encuentran las culturas Hispanicas (es roma quien bautiza a la peninsula como HISPANIA) De roma encuentra influencia en el idioma, la cultura social, las leyes y las artes en menor medida  De mas esta decir que al colonizar la America, los Espa?oles legan a las tierras nuevas su cultura|`|ea09bf964296dd87cf5a2532e784d90daa	Yo creo que Roma.... porque conquistaron Espa?a y llevaron muchas cosas alli... y los espa?oles vinieros aqui a conquistarnos...|`|0652599018e75ae9eb8252f61e1cb8a2aa	PARA MI  LOS  ROMANOS   PORQUE  ERAN  Y SON  MUY   ORGANIZADOS......Y  SI  NO  FIJATE  QUE  PARA  ESTUDIAR  DERECHO.......ME  REFIERO A  ABOGACIA.......TENES    DERECHO  ROMANO I ...II...III...IV......ES  LA  CUNA  CULTURAL Y CENTRO EUROPEO  POR EXCELENCIA......?

Ellos sentaron las bases de toda la civilizacin occidental y fueron precursores de todas las leyes y teoras habidas y por haber.|`|50af8543c3eaf03fd3c0688e99ddbaa3aa	En realidad, no es una opcin. Porque para cuando el imperio romano estaba en su apogeo, haba absorbido lo fundamnetal de la cultura griega, la que a su vez haba bebido de fuentes egipcias anteriores. Derrotados los griegos por los romanos, no tenan en Roma status alguno, y sin embargo, los preceptores de los aristcratas romanos eran todos de origen griego. De esta manera, si bien an la base de nuestras leyes es el Derecho Romano, por ejemplo, casi imposible sera discriminar la mayor o menor influencia de una u otra cultura, tan imbrincadas estn ambas en el origen de la actual civilizacin occidental.|`|6ffcf4580bc35b4df04eded3da9058eaaa	A mi modesto modo de ver ROMA, nuestro idioma tiene raices latinas, los sistemas de justicia modernos toman al derecho romano como base  y fundamento, de los griegos se podria decir que se tomo el sistema democratico y la filosofia que tampoco es poco, pero me parece que nos identificamos mas con los romanos|`|6189dbc334df68d4dbf04ec5f283b582aa	Grecia tiene la mayor cantidad de pensadores en diversas ramas de las ciencias humanas (filosofa, religin, poltica, matemticas, fsica, etc.), con las cuales la civilizacin Romana se beneficio. Quizs recordemos ms a Roma ya que absorbi tanto la Griega como otras (La Egipcia) y de ah fue personalizando todo el legado de las dems. Si no hubieran existido los Griegos quizs fueran los Romanos un grupo de brbaros y no hubieran logrado gran cosa como civilizacin.|`|cc41e38c961173c1103ba7f498b050d9aa	Si te refieres a las mal llamadas naciones 'occidentales' (segn la visin eurocentrista), Grecia influye determinantemente en Roma, por supuesto. Pero el legado del Imperio Romano es evidente, tomando en cuenta que a travs del Imperio (en una etapa pos clsica) impone al cristianismo como religin oficial (Constantino y el Concilio de Nicea); incluso, la cuenta de los das es a partir del calendario que impone el Papa Gregorio, que inicia con el nacimiento de Jess, El Cristo. Del idioma ya se ha hablado (voces latinas).|`|83a9a15a580a315895811f5da0cbb7e3aa	La respuesta es Grecia dado que esta a aportado un inigualable cumulo de conocimintos a todas las culturas por ende es en parte responsable de lo que se conoce hoy en dia partiendo de la idea de que el conocimiento solo sirve para crear mas conocimiento y Roma simplemente mostro las consecuencias de un gobierno hostil talvez democratico pero si muy hostil e inculto es por ello que sin importar el gran poder que tubo no se pudo mantener.|`|a136e9456f80109a8ed2f76587dcaccbaa	para el buen sexo, los griegos.|`|5228125066085c8a348e6f64751dbfcdaa	lo corrupto de Roma, y los conocimientos de los griegos, ?tu dices?|`|420df79a98e9d361845b7087e54e3535aa	Roma.|`|888e19369a93d8bea034192dc49c0aafaa	En la edad media Grecia influyo sobre todo el mundo, principalmente sobre los romanos, de hecho los dioses romanos eran dioses griegos, solo que a algunos les modificaban el nombre, pues entonces Roma se convirti en Imperio y esparci por todo el mundo (excepto Egypto) sus costumbres que habian sido aprendidas de los griegos.|`|9e1fae6d31dc91d26fe89ba7f6f28d97aa	roma, ahi inicio la politica moderna, ya haba senadores, ademas hablan latn  y de ah sale el castellano|`|578af5d66a8ae9bfd389a1b6d1a87aa9aa	la mayor influencia ha sido de roma, nada mas mirar que la mayoria del los vocablos que usamos actualmente provienen del latin, que era el idioma de los romanos, los sistemas politicos actuales son similares a los romanos, la discriminacion y las locuras tambien las heredamos de ellos. en fin....

I'd suggest comparing Aeon Flux with Ultraviolet and The Inside Man with Lucky Number Slevin.    That being said, I think The Inside Man was an outstanding movie.

Por supuesto en aquel momento no comprenda la profundidad de sus letras, pero gracias a eso nunca dej de escucharlo, y cuando crec pude fascinarme entendiendo los mensajes que este maestro transmite a la sociedad. Cuando voy a sus shows, o lo veo en la tele, termino siempre llorando, porque me da una profunda emocin, ya que se junta la excelencia de sus canciones con su calidez humana. Tuve la suerte de poder saludarlo y charlar con el hace unos a?os, luego de un show en Mar del Plata. De casualidad el fue a cenar con sus musicos al mismo restaurant al que fui yo despues de ver su show. A penas se acerc a mi mesa (ya que mis padres estaban conmigo y no pudieron resistirse a llamarlo), se me caian las lagrimas, porque la energia y la simpleza que transmite es una cosa increible.

His voice sounds like tuneless gravelly feces. Toby has more talent in one flaxen hair of his scrotum than Lukas has in his entire body. I wouldn't of minded Dilana as her extreme pierced tattooed look was right for the band and her voice was cool. I knew Magni was going to lose even though he was alright. Compare encores.... Toby did THREE encores and Lukas had just one. I hated Lukas since the first night. This is almost as bad as when George Junior was elected. Idiots....

fa8598e6c878641d916182873c6dc810aa	Saludos.... Espero que PEPITO te regale algunas sonrisas. Bye...          PEPITO:          La profesora interviene en una discusin entre   dos alumnos:     - "Pepito, ?cul es el problema?"   - "Es que soy demasiado inteligente para estar   en el primer grado. Mi hermana est en tercero y yo soy ms   inteligente que ella. Yo quiero ir a tercero tambin!"     La profesora ve que no puede resolver el problema   y lo manda para la direccin. Mientras Pepito espera   en la antesala, la profesora le explica la situacin al director.     Este promete hacerle un test al muchacho, del que seguro no   conseguir responder a todas las preguntas, y as   acceder a continuar en primero.     Ya de acuerdo ambos, hacen pasar al alumno y le hacen la   propuesta del test que l acepta. Inicia entonces las preguntas el   Director:   - "A ver Pepito, ?Cunto es 3 por 3?"   -"9"   -"?Y cunto es 6 veces 6?"   - "36"   El director contina casi una hora, con la batera de   preguntas que slo un excelente alumno de tercero   debe conocer y Pepito no comete ningn error. Ante la evidente   inteligencia del menor, el Director dice a la profesora:    - "Creo que tendremos que pasarlo a tercero."     La profesora no muy segura, sugiere:   - "?Puedo hacerle yo unas preguntas tambin?"     El director y Pepito asienten. Comienza entonces la profesora:   - "?Qu tiene la vaca 4 y yo slo dos?"   - "Las piernas," responde Pepito sin dudar...     - "?Qu tienes en tus pantalones, que no hay en los mos?"   El director se ajusta las gafas , y se prepara   para interrumpir...   - "Los bolsillos," responde el ni?o.     - "?Qu entra al centro de las mujeres y slo   detrs en el hombre?"   Estupefacto, el director contiene la respiracin...   -"La letra "E", responde el alumno.     - "?Y dnde tienen las mujeres el pelo ms encaracolado?"   El director hace una mueca de asombro.   -En el Africa .responde Pepito sin dudar.     -"?Qu es blando, y en las manos de una mujer se torna duro?"   Al director se le cruzan los ojos.   - "El esmalte de u?as," contesta Pepito.     - "?Qu tienen las mujeres en medio de las piernas?"   El Director no lo puede creer...   - "Las rodillas," responde Pepito al instante.     - "?Y qu tiene una mujer casada ms ancha que una soltera?"   - "La cama."     - "?Qu palabra comienza con la letra C, termina con la   letra O, es arrugado y todos lo tenemos atrs?"   El director empieza a sudar fro...   - "El codo, profesora."     - "?Y qu empieza con C tiene un hueco y yo se lo di a   varias personas para que lo disfrutaran?"     El director se tapa la cara...   - "Un CD."

Zwar sagen die, dass das die Kundenwnsche sind, aber im Grunde wollen die, so denke ich, mehr Geld. Immer mehr kaufen zwar Musiktitel online, aber ich denke das gute CD-Angebote so bald nicht aussterben werden. Die Gesch?fte m?gen aus anderen Grnden die CD-Angebote reduzieren.

In the late 1960's, the United States saw its first large-scale exposure to anime in the Speed Racer TV series, a dubbed version of a Japanese series.    During the 1970s, anime developed further, separating itself from its roots. This occurred as a result of the growing popularity of manga comicswhich were often later animatedespecially those of Osamu Tezuka, who has been called a "legend"[1] and the "god of manga"[2][3]. As a result of his work and that of other pioneers in the field, anime developed characteristics and genres that are fundamental elements of the art today. The giant robot genre (known as "mecha" outside Japan), for instance, took shape under Tezuka, developed under Go Nagai and others, and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by Yoshiyuki Tomino. Robot anime like Gundam and Macross became instant classics in the 80s, and the robot genre of anime is still one of the most popular in Japan and worldwide today. In the 1980s, anime was accepted in the mainstream in Japan, and experienced a boom in production. The mid-to-late '90s, on into the 2000s, saw an increased acceptance of anime in overseas markets.      ASTRO BOY & GIGANTOR would have been the best known in the late 60's early  '70's

Mi hermana est en tercero y yo soy ms inteligente que ella.   -?Yo quiero ir para el tercero tambin! La profesora ve que no puede resolver el problema y lo manda para la direccin.   Mientras pepito esperaba en la antesala, la profesora le explica la situacin al director. ste le promete hacerle un test al muchacho, que seguro no conseguir responder a todas las preguntas, y as acceder a continuar en el primer grado.   Ya de acuerdo ambos, hacen pasar al alumno y le hacen la propuesta del test que l acepta. inicia entonces las preguntas el director:   -A ver pepito, ?cunto es 3 por 3?   -"9"-.   -?Y cunto es 6 veces 6?   -"36"-.   El director contina por casi una hora, con la batera de preguntas que slo un excelente alumno de tercer grado debe conocer y pepito no comete ningn error. Ante la evidente inteligencia del menor, el director dice a la profesora:   -Creo que tendremos que pasarlo al tercer grado. la profesora no muy segura, pregunta:   -?Puedo hacerle yo unas preguntas tambin? el director y Pepito asienten.   Inicia entonces la profesora:   -?Qu tiene la vaca 4 y yo slo dos?   -Las piernas, responde pepito sin dudar...   -?Qu tienes en tus pantalones, que no hay en los mos?

Estupefacto, el director contiene la respiracin...   -La letra "e", responde el alumno.   -?Y dnde las mujeres tienen el pelo ms encaracolado?   El director hace una mueca de asombro   En frica, responde Pepito sin dudar.   -?Qu es blando, y en las manos de una mujer se torna duro?   Al director se le cruzan los ojos.   El esmalte de u?as, profe... contesta Pepito.   -?Qu tienen las mujeres en medio de las piernas?

Also, various recordings of these sounds can be found on www.youtube.com|`|AA11556965	uhh...what's the question again? In movies, guns usually make all kinds of noises. The noise when the actors "cock" the gun, and especially when they shoot it. I'm not too sure about any clicking noise.....maybe when the empty shell falls out of the gun onto the ground??? or the clip clicking into place......maybe thats it.|`|AA12274729	Yeah, just watch the trailer for Miami Vice. Great 'clicking' sync with the music.  So, er...what's your question?|`|cb441ab6f12753e38a45df285d258e03aa	isnt that the pulling of the trigger?|`|c80b97749801c0c42e8e52f3f9aa2e2eaa	Yes, and when an automatic pistol runs out of bullets the top slide stays back, but in "Deep Rising" some guy gets caught by the monster and shoots someone else in the ****, then goes to shoot himself in the head before he is slowly digested only to discover he has fired his final bullet.  So why didn't the slide stay back?  They could have written that into the movie with the guy he shot in the **** laughing at him whilst he hobbled off and the other guy begging him to kill him.    But what exactly was your question?    And why do people with pump action shotguns repeatedly pump a round into the chamber without firing any shots? Bad editting?|`|ffb52e8443821c1360601c71550888f9aa	folio technicians add all those little extra sounds. Saw a thing on PBS about a husband/wife team. Alot of it was pretty ingenious in a lowtech way.

815deb0dcc69970bda2452dbafec36d2aa	Ozzy Osbourne's song "Suicide Solution". This song caused alot of controversy when a teenaged boy killed himself after hearing that song numerous times.     Alot of people, radio stations & other artists had banned this song from playing on the radio waves. The song has a different meaning to what people think and actually says that "suicide is not the answer" to many peolples problems.|`|e7726b9cda5ea8c9c53653d6143b2388aa	Nothing good ever happens anymore coz the artists r so lame, and are too much slaves to the musis industry.

Like any contravery at all, or music that comes from somewhere else that might be viewed as wrong somewhere else? Cause there are many conspiracies involving music, bands etc. Such as the whole "Paul is dead" beatles conspiracy...there's too many "clues" to name but just type it in google. Hmmm what else?  Hotel California being about devil worshipping, songs by chicago, micheal jackson and others having sexual/violent/satanic "backwards messaging"...  whether this kind of music is bad for society there's too many lol|`|aba6a6669325833b885c421936cd7fe4aa	How about did Kurt Cobain kill himself?  Is Elvis Dead?  Was Jimi Hendrix silenced by "The Man"?|`|e64ced8d4b441c7ba2e92a54f52694c8aa	I'm not sure what you mean by this question...music has always brought along controversy.      It seems that every generation has to go through something with the generation before, as music changes, the older generation fights it, the younger generation rebels.      I think the biggest thing now is the use of so much "bling" and scantily clad females in video, which causes women to be viewed in what I feel is an unhealthy light.      It seems lately there has been a lot of Indian influence in pop music, too.  I'm not sure if that's contraversial though, just worth noting.

3c5f2316d7b180d5f45a6448d9b9def0aa	I understand Rupert owns homes in a couple  of cities.    Lives in London, New York, Paris & Miami.    He works out at Crunch Fitness in New York City so his NY home is probably fairly close to there.    Bought his home in Los Angeles for his dog's sake. His black Lab, Moise, was suffering from painful arthritis, so the actor relocated to the city in order for his beloved pet to heal.     Here is some other interesting trivia:    Attended the prestigious English Roman Catholic school, Ampleforth, in York, which he enjoyed, although he left school at 15.    Turned down the Daniel Day-Lewis role in "A Room with a View" (1985).    1999 VH1 Vogue Fashion Award for most fashionable male celebrity.    At his suggestion, Madonna re-recorded Don McLean's classic "American Pie".    Was expelled from London's Central School of Speech and Drama for insubordination.    Plays the piano.

Then record the tape (in real time) to your computer using a program like Music Match Jukebox.  There are probably better programs than that though.    Then burn the new music files to a CD.    I know, it takes a long time.  I did this with vinyl and it works well.|`|61eecb8fb87303dac494001ef4a08a7daa	I presume you already have a cassette deck.     All you need now is the right cables (See the tutorial links below. It's stuff readily available at most good electronics stores.)    The basic process is the same: you play the tape, and your PC converts it (in real time) into an AIFF or WAV file (a pretty big file). Then you drag this into e.g. iTunes, and convert it into an mp3 (if you're an iPod person) OR burn the AIFF/WAV straight to disc with, e.g. Toast or Nero, to make a playable CD. (See the links below for more details on this process.)    And you need the right software, of course.    There are many software options for Windows or Mac - at least 6-7 acceptable programs out there. I have given you some links below for the free stuff. There are also modestly-priced alternatives at zdnet.com or download.com under 'mp3 utilities'.      TIPS FROM MY EXPERIENCE:    a. Your first few attempts may be disappointing. There may be audible hissing in the background; or the recording, even after being EQed, may still sound 'tinny'. Just play around with various threshold settings in the software - the more you experiment, the better the results get.    b. If there is significant warping to the tape, it's almost a lost cause to generate 'clear' mp3s. Save yourself the hassle and just buy the album on CD. The software filters can reduce the problem, but they can do only so much. However, I once rescued a tape that was 21 years old, without a hitch. If they've been well-stored, you should have no problems.    I'm not sure where you live. If you don't want the hassle of doing it yourself, do some Google work with key words: 'cassette conversion to digital', 'old cassettes to mp3', etc. This will turn up a lot of commercial services (if you are UK / US-based) which will do this for you, for a small fee.    I think, however, for just a handful of tapes, it's not worth it - have a go at doing it yourself; the most you need to buy is the cable and the jack, and download the software.    Best of luck!    The basic process is explained at:    http://www.blazeaudio.com/howto/lp-overv...    A variety of software options for the job are discussed at:    http://www.soundabout.net/transfer_tape_...

Use of the term sheet is intended to differentiate music on paper from a recording, broadcast, or live performance, and more specifically usually refers to the print publication of commercial music alongside the release of a new film, show, record album, or other special event which involves music.

AA10673599	I have to agree with you. I don't like Bow Wow's obnoxious and cocky attitude. I used to like Bow Wow but it seems like money and dating Cierra has really blew his head up! I would like to see Romeo sell more copies than Bow Wow. Let's be realistic. Unlike Bow Wow, Romeo was in the money before he ever dropped an album and is still humble.|`|AA11711195	I know romeo will make more out of buisness , but bow will sell more if u get what I'm sayin'|`|AA10057011	Bow Wow will most likely sell more.

487bfbd662f1c360274418bbda97e82eaa	The OC is going to be coming back on soon. Channel 10 have made the very smart move of airing the series 4 at the same time as America. Why can't all the other stations do this too? Unfortunately Lost comes back on in February next year which in my opinion is too far away. Desperate Housewives has already began season 3 in America so that might be a little earlier. Hope this helps|`|AA11317014	Lost returns in February. That is usually when we get all our standard stuff back. Lucky its warm and we don't have to stay inside for reality tv.|`|e7272712180fbae68b247e8c9538786aaa	Can't answer your question, but I can say that Desperate Housewives came back to the US last Sunday.

It featured stories by each of the Image founders that stayed with the company and featured stories with some major revelations for the creators' original creations (a new Shadowhawk, Savage Dragon's origin, the regrouping of Cyberforce, etc.).    Like most comics, the value depends on the buyer.  A huge Image fan might buy it for thirty dollars or more, someone just slightly interested in seeing it might offer you ten bucks.

496210ba9b559f312bfbf939da2754b7aa	I do it all the time!    The secret - believe it or not - lies in the model of your CD-Rom/ CD-RW drive.    No amount of software or voodoo can help you if your drive belongs to a brand that doesn't want to rip Copy Control CDs.    I use a Sony. Don't use TEAC (TEAC drives cannot even recognize CC CDs).    For the price of two CDs, your problem would be solved. Good luck.    P.s. the best software Ive ever used is Winamp. The best sound quality. And its free!|`|AA10925518	Google : "How do I rip a Copy Control CD"  to find more answers.  If you can listen to the CD on your computer, you can always record it again with the right software.  If you can not even play it on your computer, return the defective disc and boycot artists that release stuff you can not listen to.|`|6c639000f56de50685ef8ff81089353aaa	u can try going to www.download.com to look for the software.|`|87b580e3647690b50bbb99d7559c7807aa	Huh? Do you mean there are Digital Rights Managment built in to the CD and it's purpose, to keep you from illegally copying it and sharing it, is working... and you feel "ripped off"?    You can't rip it if DRM won't allow it to be ripped. Would you like to copy a track from an audio CD into your computer as an .MP3?

Also there is the  chance that the brain could enlarge as their doing it. Other than medical stuff they would have to be attached to certain sections of the brain.

But I agree with you.  If I were you, I would try to take pics with my cameraphone...if you have one or if they let you.  I wonder if they can come up with ways to take pictures for you, like they do in amusement parks.  That way  you can pay for the pictures.|`|78fe6dc35e11bf043461d2380c58c2a1aa	Well most concerts cameras are allowed so if Pink's management has told this venue not to let in people with cameras its time to throw out her cds and start listening to artists who care more about their fans than their money. I have been to many concerts this last year but in a very different genre, heavy metal, this genre is the most fan-friendly one there is and I have never be told I cant take pictures. I have so many pics of bands on stage and with me I cant count them all. Call venue and ask or even go to a fansite and find out if this rule is in her history of past concerts.

I actually enjoyed reading it, even though it was pretty horrific.   It's the kind of book that makes you pray to God it's a work of fiction, even though you know that somewhere out there, there is bound to be at least one similar story.

Es un perro de caractersticas antropomrficas y es uno de los mejores amigos de Mickey Mouse. Padre de Maximiliano "Max" Goof, en lugar de los sobrinos que tiene la mayora de los personajes (Mickey, Minnie, Donald..)    Su primera aparicin fue el 25 de mayo de 1932 en Mickey Revue. Este corto de animacin dirigido por Wilfred Jackson muestra a Mickey Mouse, el caballo Horacio y a la vaca Clarabella cantando y haciendo un espectculo de baile. En esta poca, los cortos de Mickey y su pandilla animada hacan canciones y nmeros bailados casi rutinariamente. Lo que le dara a esta animacin un carcter distintivo fue el debut de un nuevo personaje, cuya forma de actuar servira como fuente de chiste.    Al igual que en las animaciones, las tiras cmicas lo llamaron primeramente Dippy Dawg, pero su nombre cambi en el a?o 1939.    El dibujante Floyd Gottfredson generalmente se basaba en lo que suceda en los cortos de Mickey de ese tiempo. Cuando el Pato Donald gan la suficiente popularidad como para tener su propia historieta, no se permiti que siga apareciendo en las tiras cmicas de Gottfredson. De acuerdo a esto, Goofy qued como nico compa?ero de Mickey.

Azureus (http://azureus.sourceforge.net/) is a good Torrent program, but you will have to find your files on sites, for example:    thepiratebay.com  torrentspy.com  demonoid.com  mininova.org     Hope this helps.

f367808cc261372899a25e69e508880baa	This is one of THE best tricks I know! First you put Saran Wrap or any other clear plastic wrap over the toilet, between the bowl and the seat.

4f0cd81d2ec75d84539080d16c5944b7aa	Allah Rakha Rahman (Tamil: ?.???.???????); born on January 6, 1966 as A. S. Dileep Kumar in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India) is an acclaimed film composer, best known for composing film scores and soundtracks.    Rahman is the only son of R. K. Sekhar, who was a composer, arranger and conductor for Malayalam films. His father died when Rahman was nine years old, and his family used to rent out musical equipment to make ends meet, something they found very difficult. During those hard times, a Sufi (Muslim) saint helped them spiritually. This led Dileep to convert to Islam, changing his name to Allah Rakha Rahman.    At the age of 11, Rahman joined the troupe of Indian composer Ilaiyaraaja as a keyboardist. He later played on the orchestra of M. S. Viswanathan and Ramesh Naidu, and accompanied Zakir Hussain and Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan on world tours. The experience allowed him to obtain a scholarship to Trinity College at Oxford University, where he received a degree in Western classical music.  Rahman arrived on the Indian music scene with his first film Roja, the music industry in India in general was going through a crisis with the retirement of older music composers and the lack of innovation in Indian film music. Tamil Cinema music was going through a transformation and Ilaiyaraaja was at his peak in the Tamil Cinema industry.[citation needed] Roja was a massive hit, and Rahman followed it up with a number of other extremely popular films, including Bombay, Rangeela, Dil Se and Taal. Rangeela, directed by Ram Gopal Varma, marked Rahman's debut in Hindi films. The huge sales of these albums prompted movie producers to take film music more seriously.     Lord Lloyd-Webber with A. R. RahmanRahman's work is also unique in the fact that his collaborations with a few film directors have always resulted in hugely successful albums. In particular, he has worked with Mani Ratnam on eight movies (until 2004) (see list of movies by Mani Ratnam featuring A R Rahman), all of which have been musical superhits. Also notable is his collaboration with the director S. Shankar (Gentleman, Kadhalan, Indian, Jeans, Mudhalvan, Nayak, Boys and Sivaji).    He made an album Vande Mataram (1996) on India's national song, singing the title song on the album. He followed it up with an album called Jana gana mana, a huge conglomeration of performances by all the leading exponents/artists of Indian classical music.    Andrew Lloyd Webber, a well known composer of musicals, was impressed with Rahman's unique style and therefore hired him to compose his maiden stage production Bombay Dreams (2002). This play was well received in England and opened him up to new vistas in Hollywood. Furthermore, Rahman, along with the Finnish folk music band V?rttin?, composed the music for The Lord of the Rings theatre production, which opened in Toronto on March 23, 2006.    In addition to influencing western audiences, Rahman also impressed eastern audiences with his music so much that he was tapped by Chinese director He Ping to compose the score and soundtrack for the Chinese film Warriors of Heaven and Earth in 2003. The music of this film was very much appreciated in Asia and in India.    On May 23rd 2006, a two-disc album soundtrack, titled Introducing A.R. Rahman, was released by Times Square Records, featuring 25 songs he composed from Tamil film soundtracks spanning 1993-2001. The compillation soundtrack was well received. In addition to this, Rahman performed at the Hollywood Bowl amphitheatre in July of 2006, with Indian singers Sukhwinder Singh, Hariharan and Sadhana Sargam, as well as American performing groups Raagapella and Global Rhythms, to a sell out crowd.    His latest work includes Yuva, Bose - The Forgotten Hero, Swades, Mangal Pandey - The Rising, Rang De Basanti and Sillunu Oru Kaadhal. He is currently working on Mani Ratnam's next venture Guru, and on one of Shyam Benegal's next ventures, Chamki Chameli, which is set for release in 2007.    Rahman is a recipient of the Padma Shri.|`|68a1a876775e77b047d17f32f3e784a2aa	A.R. Rehman    He is one of India's leading music directors....'

80253dca33aae43c51f7eb19cb701f29aa	Birth  23 July 1989    Birthplace  London, England    Daniel Radcliffe is the young actor who starred as Harry Potter in the 2001 film Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (U. K. title: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) and its sequels, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005). The films were based on the popular series of novels by British author J.K. Rowling. Radcliffe's first film role was as David in the BBC TV adaptation of David Copperfield (1999). He also had a part in The Tailor of Panama (2001, starring Pierce Brosnan). Although he had wanted to be an actor for as long as he could remember, November had to convince his parents to allow him to pursue his dream. The schoolboy had been encouraged to try out for a 1999 British TV version of Charles Dickens' "Oliver Twist" but his mother and father opposed the idea. When the opportunity to audition for another of Dickens' young heroes, this time "David Copperfield" (BBC, 1999), they relented. Surviving five callbacks, Radcliffe landed the role and earned glowing notices for his work. He also displayed a poise and screen charisma and more than held his own opposite such veterans as Bob Hoskins and Maggie Smith. Still, that was a mere warm-up for his first major film role. Radcliffe landed the highly coveted part of Harry Potter, the bespectacled young wizard of the popular series of books by author J K Rowling. The young actor beat out numerous other performers (including the much rumored Gabriel Thomson, who ironically had played another Dickens hero, Pip in 1999's "Great Expectations", and Liam Aiken, who had co-starred in director Chris Columbus' "Stepmom" 1998). Radcliffe received the imprimatur of author Rowling and was expected to be a breakout when "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" opened in theaters in November 2001. Indeed, the film was recieved warmly by audiences and Radcliffe became one of the best known adolescent actors of the day. Following the success of the film, Radcliffe found himself with little time to explore other roles, as he was set to reprise the bespectacled young wizard in the sequel "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" (2002) as well a subsequent films in the series.|`|9d20ff01bef2cb06655b3cefa7f00d4baa	he plays harry potter in all the movies...|`|95a57cea88cc75a8872f29a597524ee4aa	www.danielradclifferocks.com|`|AA11329479	he's an underage hottie...........long live harry potter|`|e88ad2902740948fc74e02edf156da42aa	He's hot.|`|e1cbfc94c0463c8b2a9c5bfd437b8779aa	he has dating troubles ...cant get a girl!!! not even kidding..

For Writing, The Exorcist won in 1973, that's amazing. Midnight Express (1978) fits your bill as well. Quite a ground breaker and a fantastic movie!

John Hiatt - Cry Love        A moment of steel  A dry-eyed house  Did he say goodbye to you  Or did you kick him out  I know you're not afraid  To go alone  But this was a marriage of spirit, flesh, and bone     Now whatcha gonna do  When the planet shifts  Whatcha gonna do  Gonna slit your wrists  Bleed all over the milky way  The stars in your eyes look red today     CHORUS:  Cry love, Cry love  The tears of an angel  The tears of a dove  Spilling all over, your heart from above  Cry Love, Cry Love     The trust of a woman in his hand  But he was a little boy, not a man  You loved him stronger than he could feel  Yeah he was wrapped up in himself like an orange peel  Now whatcha gonna do  With the booze and the blush  Whatcha gonna do  When there's no rush  Cop a little misery  At the corner store  Well' one day that train of pain won't stop no more     CHORUS     Throwning up ashes on the floor  If this is a lesson in love  Well what's it for?  The heart will remember  The burning fire  The next time you feel the flame  Of desire     CHORUS  CHORUS     Cry love, cry love, cry love

Yo no viva en aqul tiempo como para poder ser objetivo al respecto. Como argentino, de Pedro Infante, se poco  nada. De Carlos Gardel, se que viaj por Europa, trabaj en Francia, divulg el tango por aquellos lados y luego film un par de pelculas para la Paramount en EEUU. Adems de haber hecho giras internacionales por toda Amrica, en las que, en una de ellas, termin su vida, incendiandose el avin que acababa de tomar, con slo, creo, que 33 a?os de vida.

Answers who love the site but as the marvel it might be, not the unholy nightmare of a cesspool it currently is.     I would ask as well why it is that Yahoo! fails to enforce its own Terms of Service (TOS) and Community Guidelines for Yahoo! Answers. That perhaps is the ultimate irony and would be a colossal joke were it not such a blatant and dangerous tragedy.     I would try to tell them once again - - - hoping against hope that THIS time it would not fall on deaf ears - - - that what is needed to effectively, efficiently and fairly enforce those rules and regulations is dedicated human moderators specially trained for the purpose and working around the clock 24/7/365 just as the hatemongers do, the very same hatemongers who have found in Yahoo! Answers the best, most effective and efficient tool for spreading their gospel of hate instantaneously - - - and free of cost to them - - -  throughout the entire world.     I would tell them to stop wasting their time, energy and money on the hopeless quest for a technological solution to a human problem, a problem which requires human arbitrators, a problem which, in the end, only moral reasoning humans can address and solve. I would tell them to stop expecting moral solutions from what after all is only a machine. I would tell them that it is shortsighted to think that Yahoo! can save money by replacing human employees with computer hardware and software, that in the long run such a fatally flawed approach will cost them dearly.     Yahoo! Answers could be the premier answer site on the Internet ...... it could be but seems more destined to go up in flames. 'Tis a pity and a shame.

The last three episodes showed that Billie was finally convinced (brainwashed, rather) by Christie to vanquish the Charmed Ones. When the sisters were banished to the underworld because of Christie's doing, the Charmed Ones were left no choice but to fight back against the Ultimate Power --Billie. They summoned the "Hollow" because that's the only thing that amplifies their powers enough to kill Billie and Christie. However, Billie and Christie summoned the Hollow, too, the same time the Charmed Ones did. In result, the Hollow was divided to the five of them. They faced the Ultimate Battle, blowing up the manor and killing Christie, Paige and Phoebe. Piper wanted to reverse what has happened by borrowing Coop's (the Cupid, Phoebe's love interest) ring to return to the time before the battle so as to warn her sisters about the would-be ending if they would summon the hollow. In the process of time-traveling, she went back to past and even the future picking up family *passengers* to help her save her sisters. Billie had realized she was used by a demon and ended killing her own sister to protect the greater good.     It was a very cool but sad episode finale with all the Halliwells are present -- except Prue, but she was at least mentioned -- from Victor, Patty, Penny, older Chris and Wyatt, Leo and of course the Charmed Ones. The finale also showed what happened to each sister after the battle and how the next generation of Halliwell witches continued to their children.     You can watch these episodes on YouTube. Just type in the episode title and you'll get to watch it. Better, you'll get to watch all your missed episodes of Charmed in this site. They've got a (near) complete episodes...    Isn't Charmed a fantastic show? :)|`|a8decb83f59b0e4c727291f0f8261b47aa	umm didnt they all fake their own deaths and change their apperances?

I was the WTF generation..other wise known as generation X ..i think..who knows but my friends and i were the hard to define..they didn't know what to call us...we came at the azz end of the original punk wave really..and were to early for goth(thank God)..we were pizzed at the world for reasons we thought sincere enough..actually the very same reasons that most teens are and were and will be! lol That's just it...adults looked at us like what the h*** do you have to be mad about...the same as people looking at you wondering what you have to be so upset about...your just a kid right.what do you know about real life yet plus..not everyone is on your wave length suger. We got mad..and tore s**t up and graffitied anarchy signs and held stupid rant parties filled w' drunken glee and told everyone to leave us alone!...you guys get emotional. write poetry, cut yourself, cry and whine about your problems and expect everyone to cry along with you and feel just as bad about your situation as you do....You see that is why a lot of people come down on emos...if you want to go have a pity party..he11, have at it..saw your whole freakin arm off if you think that's what's really and truly gonna solve all your problems..(but you may want to give that a couple years thought) but if i just can't and don't identify with you or your problems or feel like sitting around pissing and moaning constantly w' you or feeling over whelmingly sorry for you......don't call me insensitive. Basically, people just don't like really self absorbed .."please feel just as bad for me as i do"..kind of people..it's not just "emos"..it's just that a lot of you young ones decided to band together ..behave that way and give it a name. Sorry..but it's just the truth and yes..Virginia, sometimes the truth hurts,,that is called life dear. I had to learn this a long time ago..and you will hopefully learn this too..my suggestion. If you are sick of people getting you down and feeling so crappy about your life that you are forced to self mutilation...stop! Listen to some good old school and maybe even some new school Punk...throw out the "no one loves me and the world is just a cruel and lonely place so i'm gonna cut myself" crap and adopt more of a "Sometimes life sucks so i'm gonna raise some he11 and have some fun!" philosophy..nothing to lose...but it's just a suggestion.

CAssie and her music sux!!!|`|42e4a79b60661d3fd89f6496b97595a1aa	None of them deserve their success and no I am not hatin', but seriously they are riding of the successes of the greats that came before them with high pitched voices and expensive beats. They can make music but it is not of the lasting variety, rather it is the song of the week and the forgotten. I prefer r&b with a little more substance and a little more originality, talent is not a bad thing either.|`|1b1c68f80785982bdb5f503c27d403f6aa	well i enjoy cassie's music better so id prefer her|`|NkN4HoFpaa	Ciara has more natural talent.Cassie is pre packaged to P Diddys liking.|`|AA10099290	both|`|77ba76c74ecc97b9bcff76bc99baaee0aa	Definetly Ciara.

Some things beautiful and some things frightening...I take a   dream as a warm warning on life to change and get right with God.  God gives dreams to next moves or correction temptation and where your standing is with him.  To share psycho...I guess I would make a frightening dream real bad and make lots of money...But Would God be pleased and if I tell my dream a lot of bad things can come in and put my ideas or die dreary wanrning on others the bigger the problem becomes the more you let the right or wrong people get in...  Look at JK Rollings and the Harry Potter  the more people get in and beleave in this Potter the greater His strong story draws the youth and fills her bank account bringing her some bad dreams or omens that this will be her last book...She cant handle the things she tapped in on innocently next the more you get people to believe in a thing the stronger it becomes until it controlls you an takes you over and you loose your control.  I feel sorry for her.  She said she was flat broke and the Harry Potter started talking to here and she wrote his story down...When she saw the movie characters brought to life from her descriptions they said it frighten her and the fact that the characters have grown up in the rroles ...Some one else might pick up the tale for her...Pick up the tale or tail...Think   What may make men world worship and believe in the more it begins to be real...What you put out comes with a price ...They said be careful what you put out there...  Om  in time and history and space Outer Space with the internet and with satelite...to the Universe...Just a book Just a movie...The Power to influence man to God or ....Don't give the Devil Power|`|c4f04976690c145caa1b3b6ec1690d75aa	Wow that is an awesome idea.

AHHH!!! and then i was watching E! today, and there was a program on about the makeovers or something, and then all of a sudden it said "BREAKING NEWS!!" and then they went on for 10 minutes about anna nicoles funeral, and how many people there were, and followed limos.    this is all that the media has been talking about for a looooooong time, and hopefully, it will soon be over.|`|CXuitaj8aa	yeah,all i see on tv is her,her,her! even thought she's dead,they still onsess about her. it's annoying! why can't people in hollywood stop broadcastingevry trouble in thier life?|`|6112fce921c5789ff47b05c280e49bffaa	I is.

Ware, Donald H. Naftulin und Frank A. Donnelly erdacht hatten. Stundenlang bten sie mit dem Schauspieler: "Das gr??te Problem war, Fox davon abzuhalten, etwas Sinnvolles zu sagen. Fox war sich sicher, dass der Schwindel auffliegen wrde. Doch das Publikum hing an seinen Lippen und begann nach dem einstndigen Vortrag, flei?ig Fragen zu stellen, die er so virtuos nicht beantwortete, dass niemand es merkte.

Professoren sollten, anstatt Vorlesungen zu halten, Schauspieler dafr trainieren  so ein Vorschlag von John E. Ware, eines der Initiatoren des Versuchs.

La cultura se adquiere de diversas formas, estudios o simplemente ideologias que te llevan a estudiar el tema o los temas o las circunstancias o los tiempos de vida he historia.  No todo el estudioso es culto tampoco, porque la gama de la cultura en un ser humano es muy amplia, no significa que si sabes de arte sos culto o si te recibiste de medico sos culto.  Es todo un tema para analizar, el porque o cuando una persona es culta que no tiene nada que ver con buenos modales o conocer cada pagina de la biblia.  saluditos|`|AA11411121	Una persona que goce aprendiendo.....|`|2f4b8b44289523d1ae112ec942665800aa	Hola, culta es la manera de calificar a una persona que conoce bastante de muchas cosas.

AA10460778	Yeah, it's kind of weird.  I remember when both Heather O'Rourke and Dominique Dunne (or murdered in Dominique's case) died.  *I also thinks it's rather horrific that the "man" that strangled Dominique served less than three years in prison and is at this very moment walking around free like he didn't abuse and murder this woman*  When you factor in all of the problems that arose on the set and the illnesses that have plagued some of the people who were involved in the movies, it makes you think.|`|285a2ddcb1cac81180fd72ccf0a75df3aa	I remember seeing that.

ZeRgwcYhaa	I'm 22 and am very excited about the last book coming out. Can take or leave the next movie though. Order of the Phoenix, to me, was just OK. The halfblood prince will make an awesome movie though.    As for the last book... I think both Voldemort & Harry will die. Snape & Draco will both help Harry in the end (or at least Draco will... Rowling made a point of how Draco wouldn't kill Dumbledore).    Dumbledore may be alive or dead... I don't know. I'm sure there will be a big action scene at the end with Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Longbottom & Harry battling to the death with deatheaters. I don't think any of them will die though (with exception to Harry & Voldemort that is).    I think Draco may die deciding to help Harry at the last minute. Or Snape will.|`|9967594839d12474d7e6179f274e379faa	grow up|`|AA10739385	35 here and  cant wait!!!|`|4dd3d0f032cf40520fc8a112cf9d35d1aa	I' looking forward to it! (36 & biggest Potter fan I know!) I'll take my kids & be sure to buy the movies when release to watch over & over.     I love seeing the scenery & the stories come to life. It is somewhat dissapointing that so much of the story is left out, but it's understandable. The movies are already 3 hours long & the books are so detailed theres no way to cram it all in. If someone did love the movies enough to want more, it should prompt them to read the books if they haven't already.     I really liked the way the last one was filmed & hope the cinematography is similar in the Order of Phoenix. I am worried that the actors are getting rather old to portray the ages they should be.|`|AA12351713	I'm almost 30 and way excited. I have the mugglenet countdown clock on my MySpace and everything. I can't imagine how they are going to get all the important info from OOTP across in the movie but I'm looking forward to seeing how the scenes play out.    As far as Deathly Hallows goes I just hope all the loose ends get taken care of and I hope Harry doesn't die!!|`|yuI7OXKyaa	I'm excited!  And I'm 21!  I love the books and the movies.  I think that Dumbledore won't really be dead and that Harry will die.|`|71637feea148963d76aaebc741d3b2aeaa	It would be awesome but there are so many films out that when there is a new one people just dont want to see it because they're afraid that it'll be the same thing. But I'm sure Harry Potter's fans would be very excited to get their hands on the book and watch the movie also. :)

bddb79f4ae5df0a49730d5f6e1cbf402aa	Well, during the movie Purple Rain, Prince's charachter's father is dying (I believe) in the hospital while this song is playing, so that could patially be it.    Or he was just inspired by a break-up with someone to write it.|`|AA11834543	SEX|`|6GaVyoR7aa	A PURPLE SHOWER....LOL.. p.s.i LOVE this song by the way!!|`|29078bc7eaad7e29128f41a4191071e8aa	I have no idea what the purple rain part is about but the woman is trying to choose between Prince and another man.    I never wanted to be your weekend  lover  I only wanted to be some kind of friend  baby I  could never steal you from another  it's such a shame  our friendship had to end    I know, I know, I know times are changing  it's time we  all reach out for something new, that means you too  you say  you want a leader,  but you can't seem to make up your  mind      Below is a link to the lyrics.  Also Prince was going out with a girl named Vanity at the time and broke up shortly before the song was written. It is thought the song is about their breakup but has not been confirmed by Prince himself.
