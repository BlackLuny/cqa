20090220134110AAdcIyP	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of my poem- style and content wise?	I'm a teen poet really just testing her abilities in the realm of poetry right now... I want to know what people think of one of my more recent pieces because I've been told it's very emotive and that it's good, but i really want more comments on it.        What do you think of the style and the word choice?  Is the portrayal of the topic interesting?  Does it need to be more straightforward or more metaphorical and symbolic?  Or do you just flat-out hate it?  I'm NOT one of those people who get mad at criticism and i would love for someone to just absolutely pick it apart.  Say anything you want about it basically.        It looks long but honestly it only takes like three minutes to read because the lines are so short.  Thanks in advance.      The Memory Lark      Time has flown from me    Like some archaic lark    Whose mourning song recalls    The memories that I've forgotten.    It climbs above the spindly skeletons    As winter's days toll on,    Counted like the nickels strewn over the backseat    And lost to the very breaths of all the world.       She writes what she sees    And what she sees is what things are.    She's the funhouse mirror,    He's the waterfall,    She's the rain    And he's the thunder,    But together they are Cinderella    And Sleeping Beauty,    Mr. White horse and Mrs. Damsel.    She writes everything    Especially what she sees.       My thoughts run circles,    My thoughts run knots.    Tangled masses that can never be undone.    I've lost the one thing that ever mattered    To a ravaged soul that couldn't define anything,    Not even itself.    That this is what she writes is one thing,    That this is how I am is another.       The lines were blurred,    The borders broken by a thousand years of turmoil,    Never to be reinstated.    The cheeks are turned without knowledge of what they are turned to,    And my jaw clenches,    Wired shut by all things that I'll never say.       Sickness is a burden,    But illness is a plague.    Drag one foot in front of the other    Trudging the caked grains of million year old memories.    They known mine are missing    And they offer theirs.   But I cannot read them,    Cannot comprehend them.      Walk until I lose the road,    Falling at the edge.       On my knees I've knelt since it all left,    With an engulfing, enflaming, desire...    And the question of origin.    Does she write that it was founded?    Self destruction amplified by desperation?    Or martyr with a flare for the dramatic?       The lines were grains pushed back in depression's flood,    And now that I need them they are gone.    My time, my patience, my vision, my hope, my faith, my belief.    They are gone.    They drift in someone else's mind,    Someone I long to be again.    They hum to her, tell her everything's going to be alright,    Hold her tighter than glue, not wavering,    Not a single thought of my misfortune.       The mirror cracks into diamonds    That rain over the rough surface of the asphalt    And what used to be fizzles to nothing more than a memory,    Flown away on the wings of my memory lark,    Mourning everything I was,    Regretting everything I am,    And knowing,    That as I kneel here,    Lost to the world and isolated by an invisible wall,    I will never hear it again.       This is the end:    Dust-caked knees,    Tear-streaked cheeks,    Spinning consciousness,    Desolation,    Desperation,    And an acid-white needle    Just inches from the fingertips    As the head hits the ground.       Overhead,    As it flies,    The lark never looks back.    It knows better.

So I finished the book this week while we were away and really liked it, but there are 2 things I'm unclear about:      1) Did the townspeople actually get what was going on before they all got picked off and turned into vampires? and      2) At one point in the book where King describes secrets of the town, it says that Hubert Marstons wife begged him to kill her. Its obvious that he committed suicide because he couldn't live with the fact that he pulled the trigger, but why did she beg him to kill her?      Cheers

20090220135731AABJnTC	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Help with Jazz Band piano auditions?	On Tuesday I will be auditioning for my High school Jazz band. The music director asked me to play piano for the band next year because the current pianist will be graduating at the end of this year. I have never played Jazz before, I've been strictly classical. I'm late intermediate to early advanced in classical music, I can play things like Chopin prelude number 4, 15, 20, etc. moonlight sonata, Mendelssohn's gondola songs, and the Rachmaninoff prelude in C.      I am currently working on the scales for jazz piano. I need to audition with F major Blues and B flat major Blues along with a selection from a piece and improvisation in B flat major.      I'm fine with the first two, scales are no problem and the piece is easy. Improvisation is a problem. I have never done any sort of improv before, let alone in a certain key. I'm not very familiar with keys and stuff like that, I just have always played to play.      Any pointers and tips or links to tutorial websites would be so helpful! I'll be practicing on my keyboard unfortunately for the next week, as my piano is being repaired. Figures. :)      Thanks very much!

20090220135806AALlUA7	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I'm writing a book and I'm stuck, HELP! (for writers and authors please)?	Ok here is my story so far-          Pain. I felt sharp needle like feelings run through my body. I wondered if it was possible to survive such circumstances. My heart pounded in my chest as if it was going to explode. It was strenuous to breathe.    I looked around the room, dark, cold, a place where a rat might want to live. I had no intention of living. My life was done, or so I thought. Shadows shifted along the walls, the white window panes the only color in the dark room.  Voice was all I could hear, they were low murmurs.     As I tried to support my weak body the pain came again, worse. I saw a new figure. He had dark shaggy hair and unforgettable deep sea blue eyes. He hurried over to me ignoring the other figures in the room. My heart pounded as loud as an alarm clock. My breathing became abrupt, inhale exhale inhale exhale! It was so quick that I instantly stopped breathing. My eyes closed and everything blackened.    I knew I was still alive. I could hear the talking in the room.  I could hear but not comprehend. I heard my name once or twice but I thought I was hallucinating. A soft, warm hand touched my cheek. I opened my eyes again, still not breathing. It was the boy with the dark hair. I had to breathe, for him. Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. I slowly restarted my system.     More talking that I did not understand. I heard my name. Several times actually. In a row. I guessed someone was calling my name. Who? I had no time to answer questions; I didn’t even know where I was. A new figure stepped in the dark murky room, his stance angry. More talking. More hearing my name.     I took a deep breath and tried to make out the words, “She has to go! Emrys you can’t change her! She’s human and that’s what she’s meant to be!” an angry voice yelled. I saw something fly at me. “I’m sorry,” was the last thing I heard.         I want to know what I should write to make it still interesting and I don't know what to write about after this. I'm stuck. Please help.      Thanks.

20090220140538AAudW2P	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Could you please rate this poem...?	Okay, this is a little poem I wrote really quickly.  I was listening to Taylor Swift's 'Love Story' and then thought a lot about Romeo and Juliet.  It's just a poem about the star-crossed lovers who ended both their lives tragically.  Not too mean.      Star-Crossed Lovers      Upon a night two people   Met and fell in love   It was written in their destiny   In the stars that glow above      Though people tried to stop them   They refused to let love go   They thought that they could escape   From the worlds tormented show      They escaped into the night   But did not get that far   For she was taken home   And he, locked behind bars      She was so weary from weeping   And he was a dead man   This caused he great pain   That she could not stand      She tricked her wicked father   And the man to whom she was betrothed   For she had made a deal with God   And kept her powerful oath      She was not dead, but sleeping   In a coffin, where she lay   Until her love could come for her   She slept for two whole days      He found her lying lifelessly   And his heart stopped in his chest   With a sip of deadly poison,   He was lay to rest      She awoke to find him dead   And she cried a thousand tears   She looked at him with envy   ‘Why did you leave me here?’      Her heart was shattered quickly   She would never be his wife   Unless she took her chance   And took her own sweet life      She grabbed his knife swiftly   And stabbed it through her heart   He life was ended suddenly   Before it had a chance to start      So they will lie in the heavens   For now and ever more   They will only be remembered   In literature and lore

20090220142831AATGOdx	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is my life over? Do I even have a future?	I have no life. I'm stuck in this neighborhood that might as well be a ghetto. I envy the hooligan across the street and his drug addict mother because they at least have a life.      I can't drive because of my anxiety. I have Asperger's Syndrome and OCD which I had to take medication for.   I also have acid reflux now and have to take Zantac twice a day. I am not taking my Zoloft and Risperdal because I do not want to take four medications a day. The only time when it is okay and normal to take four pills a day is when you're old or dying. I'm 20 years old despite living the life of an overprotected 12-year-old and feeling as jaded as a middle aged person. It's pathetic how the average 12-year-old could run circles around me socially.      I have a feeling that I'm going to be alone, unemployed and living with my parents for the rest of their lives. My parents will think that I'm a bigger failure and disappointment than they already do. I can't even keep a minimum wage job as I'm socially dense and my anxiety shakes me up to the point where I can't even concentrate on the simplest things.      I can't transfer to a school in a stimulating city because I have a crappy 2.8 GPA and my parents are too busy paying for the tuition of my sister's prestigious college. I'm not good at anything that will help me make money and have a lucrative career. I fail at math and science. Nothing I'm good at counts for anything.      I can't talk to my school counselor because they are only watchdogs who make sure that everyone that visits them is not the next Cho Seung Hui from Virginia Tech. When I told them about my intrusive, disturbing thoughts last summer, they shipped me off to the mental hospital where I ended up for over six hours. I was too scared to call my parents. I feared that they would either get mad at me or cry. I've never seen my mom cry before and I did not want this to be the first time.      My parents found out and all hell broke lose. After an agonizing search for a professional, we found a psychiatrist because the psychiatrist was the first person to take our insurance AND be able to write a letter to the school saying that I'm fine.      I'm tired of this crap. When is the next time I'm going to get hospitalized? I remember being forced to see a psychiatrist when I got into a fight in high school. What am I going to get diagnosed with next? Even my mother said I have caused problems since day one because I stopped talking at 18-months-old and did not speak again because of autism, how I was forced to go to a special ed.school throughout elementary school.      My mind is garbage and hell. I'm stuck in this bland, stifling town where the only stimulation is the fist fights that happen sometimes and how the thugs are so professional and advanced that they could dodge the cops minutes before they show up and never get arrested for their drugs and mini-riots when they do.   Sometimes I feel I'm too good for this, yet I feel that I deserve this and this is my place in the world. Is there anyway I can escape my situation?

20090220141917AAAtTiP	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is my prologue good writing?	*Prologue*   As I sat in the darkness, I could hear screams above me. One after another they pierced the air, making me shake every time. I knew it wasn't even close to being over, and I awaited a largely built creature to find me. Any moment, I though, I'll be discovered. Not only will I die, for seeing too much, but Caolan will die, for helping me. The sight of him, pain going through his body, because of me, broke me down. I knew I was making too much noise, but at the same time, I couldn't stop the tears. Before I knew it, light streamed into my face, and a large figure strode towards me.

20090220150743AAXvhd5	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Would you please comment?	With searching eyes I looked for her, lost somewhere among the crowd, where one face is the replica of the next. Not hers though; she wears the mask of exoticism and delicacy that was given to her by fortune; she wears it with dignity and sometimes even with a touch of vanity. She could easily be mistaken by a Renaissance masterpiece of sculptural beauty.      After a moment of uncertainty and almost despair I could finally see her walking elegantly toward me and smiling radiantly at the world. I was briefly blinded by the apparition. My heart was galloping on the pleasant turf of happiness. A moment of silence followed while our eyes kissed and caressed and desired. I could no longer see or hear the crowd. I felt alone but also terribly happy, overwhelmed by her presence.      Then her lips touched mine, softly and sensually, and I greedily kissed life. A wet and dry and most delicious kiss. I could feed on her kisses forever, as nourishment to my soul. We kissed long and untiringly and when I finally opened my eyes she had vanished. Perplexed and with searching eyes I looked for her, lost somewhere among the crowd, when I finally saw her again, waving me goodbye and saying with her eyes, "I loved you".            Thanks a lot for your comment.

20090203042226AAtNGeQ	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Ok, i NEED a crreative title. any ideas?	it is currently called "Pirate Gypsy" and is about a gypsy girl who abandons her gypsy heritage and blood to become a pirate.   i know this sounds odd, but i would like it if the title did not involve the word "soul, black, death, rose etc..." i was thinking of "bow to the decks" but that only includes her being a pirate.      The gypsy girl threw back her neck,   With a damp head of blackened hair.   She fell onto her knees, before the deck,   To down the passing ocean air.      Her blood she bore was in pirate's veins,   She drank through her coal black eyes.   Her swarthy arms were draped in chains,   As they reached  for the weeping skies.      Her blood red bodice, bound in sash   That held three belts of golden swords.   A traitor child- with heart of ash,   “My home,” she screamed “are of these boards!”      Her father's eyes, beneath coarse brows,   Thinned to pass his swollen rage.   His blinded daughter who tore her vows,   To set alight the gypsy's cage.      A fool she knew, slumbered in her mind,   Her drug was of the roaring sea.   The sweet, merry yarn, of a pirate's find,   'Twas the open fields that she did flee.

20090220150316AAW1vBl	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Writing a book part 3 (Excerpt)?	I posted the other two parts sorry it had to be broken up its because its too long but anyway here you go:         Suddenly the wall started to turn. The wall stopped turning halfway, allowing Anggie to squeeze through the opening it had made. Anggie found herself in a room she had never been in before.  It was brightly lit and there was a window on one end of it. Walking over toward the window Anggie peered through it expecting to see the grounds outside.  Instead Anggie saw a different room.  One that looked very familiar.  Anggie gasped, she suddenly recognized what she was looking at.      She was looking at her sleeping chamber. “But how….” Anggie wondered aloud. “I’ve got it” She realized what she was looking through.  Anggie was looking through the portrait of the knight! This explained the other pair of eyes she had seen earlier.  Someone had been in this secret passageway.     Anggie heard voices and then she saw Madeline and a blonde haired girl named Clarece walk in to the chamber.  Madeline went to her bunk and took out a battery pack. Anggie guessed that was what Anggie had seen under Madeline’s shirt.  Anggie strained her ears and managed to hear “She caught me coming in with the battery pack under my shirt after I changed the light last night.” could they possibly be talking about her? Just then Clarece started talking rather loudly,    “I knew as soon as you found that passageway it would be trouble.” Slowly the pieces all started to fall into place. Madeline had found this secret passageway and told Clarece.  Clarece had been in here this morning when Madeline had come to change the battery pack in the light.  Anggie had seen Madeline when she was coming back to bed.      Anggie gasped it made sense now. Obviously gasping was the wrong thing to do. Just then Madeline and Clarece both turned around and stared right at Anggie, their eyes shooting daggers.
20090220150049AAO2Fvp	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Writing a book part 2 (Excerpt)?	Thank you to those who read the first part it got cut off so here is the rest:      Realizing that she had never really paid attention to what the common room looked like she surveyed the room.  It was pretty big with lots of oversized chairs on one end of the room near the fireplace.  On the opposite side of the room there were four ladders leading to different wooden trap doors.  Behind those trap doors were four sleeping chambers, two for girls and two for the boys.  Anggie had to admit that this was the strangest school she had ever been to. Not just this room but the whole school itself.  Set in a castle with turrets, towers, tunnels, stairways and narrow passageways, Anggie felt like this school belonged in Harry Potter. Still, she thought going to school in a castle was very cool.    “I better get to my classes” Anggie thought out loud.  Anggie had only been at boarding school for about a week so she still got lost going to her classes. “Hmm let’s see, today is Tuesday, so I don’t have a class right now. Perfect! Now I have time to study for my test.”  Anggie walked through the secret passageway that led to the rest of the school. She paused outside the entrance to the common room. “Now if only I could remember my way to the basement” Anggie said aloud, “I could go to the library annex and study for that test I have coming up.”     “Need some help?” Anggie whirled around and came face to face with the redhead boy she had nearly collided with in the common room. “Haven’t I seen you somewhere before?” the redhead asked.    “O-O-Oh yes I almost knocked you down in the common room.” Anggie stammered, “I’m so sorry about that” Anggie could feel herself blushing.    “No problem” the redhead said, “I’m Jake.”    “Nice to meet you Jake, I’m Anggie.” She replied. ‘Gosh why did she always have to say the stupidest things’ Anggie thought silently hoping her face didn’t match his hair.    “So” Jake said, “Do you need help finding a class?”    “Actually, I was just on my way to the library annex.” Anggie responded.    “Ok, so take a left, go down two flights of stairs, walk straight past the grand hall where we eat, take a right, then go down eight more flights of stairs, take another right, go down twelve more flights of stairs.” Jake said, “Once you get there walk all the way to the end of that corridor and the library annex should be on your left.”    “Wow thanks!” Anggie exclaimed, “I never would have found it.”    “You’re welcome, glad I could be of assistance.” With that Jake tipped an imaginary hat and sauntered away.      Anggie skipped down all twenty-two flights of stairs with a smile on her  face.  When she got to the corridor, Anggie started skipping a little too fast around a corner.  She crashed into the wall, then she heard slidding followed by another crash.  All of a sudden there was blast of cold air from behind, Anggie wobbled on her feet. Anggie fell backwards expecting to hit the wall again but all she felt was air.  With a swoosh Anggie fell back, back, back, hit something hard and blacked out.    There was a pain that she’d never felt before.  It was so excruciating Anggie thought that she might pass out.  Everything was fuzzy.  Where was she? Anggie couldn’t remember what had happened, she couldn’t even remember what day it was.  Sitting up Anggie tried to figure out where she was, but it was near impossible considering there was no light. Grabbing onto the wall for support Anggie slowly stood up.  Feeling around Anggie found a switch and flipped it. Immediately Anggie let out a bloodcurdling scream.  Standing in front of her was the ugliest, creepiest man she had ever seen.  He walked toward her, grabbed her by the shirt, then drip.     Drip, Drip.  Anggie awoke scared out of her skin. Whew! It was just water. Anggie looked up, she was suddenly blinded by a fluorescent glow coming from a light bulb.  Looking around Anggie saw that she was lying in a puddle of water.  Anggie felt her forehead, it was sweaty and hot. Her forehead always got this way when she had a nightmare.  Standing up Anggie drank in her surroundings. It seemed as if she was in a passageway of some sort. Anggie glanced behind her and saw a steep staircase. Anggie guessed that the stairs were what she had fallen down.  Anggie started up the stairs.  When she got to the top she reached a door. It had no handle. How odd, Anggie thought to herself.  She turned around and went back down the stairs.  Having nothing else to do Anggie  decided to follow the passageway and see where it went.      The passageway went on and on without any sign of an end. The passage twisted left and right and Anggie guessed she had been walking for about fifteen minutes. Finally she saw what looked like an end. However when she arrived at the “end” it was just a wall. No door or anything. “I wonder” Anggie mused.  She pushed on the wall with all her weight.      Suddenly the wall started to turn. The wall stopped turning halfway, allowing Anggie to squeeze through
20090220145841AAJyBs2	Arts & Humanities;History	What are some horrific things that have happened to Jews throughout history other than the holocaust...?	I'm doing a research presentation on Jewish History: Trials and Tribulations. I'm trying to focus on major horrific, atrocious events that happened before or after the holocaust. I want to focus on other events that have happened because lots of people always immediately think of the holocaust when they think of Jewish hardships....I'm taking two Hebrew Studies courses this semester and it's becoming apparent that the Jews have been suffering for hundreds of years prior to the holocaust. I'm already thinking of bringing up the story of Masada. I know it's still a debatable topic...Anyways so I'm looking for just major atrocious pieces in their history. Also if anyone can give me references...Books, websites, articles,  anything that would be useful to me. Thanks!

Im deleting it all but the short intro and i was wondering if this was good.Oh and its called "Lying amongst Lavender". 1-10      Golden brown leaves fell thickly from a great oak tree, gracefully swaying downwards carried lightly on the soft breeze. A pale hand reached up and caught one gently, stroking the edges, inspecting every tiny detail. The hand released the leaf and it fell swiftly to the ground, only to be battered by a small dirty paw. Autumn was finally here.

20090220144010AAqJ0hr	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Drawing & Illustration	Bachelors vs. Associates in Graphic Design?	I'm currently a full-time student at The Art Institute of Colorado going for my Bachelors degree.    I have been thinking of lowering it to just finishing up with my Associates degree instead for a couple different reasons.      1. I'm going to be getting married to an army soldier and if I move to be stationed with him getting stationed somewhere where I'm not around a campus.      2. I've been told by multiple people that their isn't a difference as long as you can prove your skills.      3. The difference between getting my associates versus my bachelors at my college is about $30,000 - $50,000 dollars more.      4. the last 5 quarter required to get my BA are mostly electives and senior projects. Why would I want to pay thousands of dollars to take classes not directed towards my field.      5. only downside between the 2 programs is with the BA they'll put you in an internship, where as with the AS they will not. But if I'm moving from being stationed places with the army an internship wouldn't really help me.         So experienced people in the field, which is better and why?      &      how easy would it be for me to find a job (and what would I mostly be doing) if I just do it from the computer at home/online since I don't know where I'll be stationed or for how long?         ps. if I do AS I'll graduate this December. If I do BA I'd graduate in March of 2011.

20090203050028AAwsKTz	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How is the beginning of my story?	I’m finding it hard to sleep tonight; I can’t seem to settle. All I can think about is blood, I close my eyes and I picture a razor gashing across someone’s wrist, and I watch as the cut gets so deep a vein bursts. And all that beautiful shimmering blood pours out, down her arm. It begins to slow down, and then it stops, the arm falls and it doesn’t move. It’s like an overwhelmingly beautiful piece of music being played to you, all these little emotions that you savour. I knew it was time, I had to kill again.    I had already buried about four people in their unmarked graves in the past two months. I normally only kill when I feel a dire need. It’s a precious thing, taking away someone’s life and so I don’t like to do it too often, I don’t want my favourite hobby getting boring on me. Tonight I was having one of those urges; it’s only so long that I can function in society slightly normal before I have the need to kill again.    I reached out under my bed and pulled out my tool bag. Where I keep most of the instruments I use when I head off to do my work. All those little knives I carry are so pretty, they can really create true art, and the body of my poor defenceless victims is my canvas. Just splash that crimson blood around a bit and a masterpiece is born. My favourite is the pen knife, so simple, easy to hide; your victim won’t even see it as you crawl up behind them and slit their throats. Oh so dark, rich, and delightful.

20090220153400AAKyrsF	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Is sight-reading something which improves with experience?	I've been playing the flute for 1 year, and I'm grade 5, and have been playing piano for a month and am grade 2.       I love music, and love learning pieces. I just have a real problem with sight reading. Reading the notes are fine, but the rhythm is a real problemo. And with the piano, trying to get both hands to work together is a nightmare.      What also gets me is how my friends can do it so easily. I've got a friend who has been playing the flute for 5 years and is grade 6. She can sight read really easily, she just plays something perfectly, perfect rhythm and everything.       I've got another friend who has been playing the piano for 5 years. She hasn't had lessons all that time, but practises. I was singing a disney piece with her and she just played the piece! As if it was so simple.       How can I improve sigh reading? Is it something which comes with experience, or will I never be able to do it?

And what about the flakes that fell in days gone by? The number of flakes that have existed is ridiculously high, I cannot even begin to get my head around it.  There is no way that there are 2 not the same, more likely there are thousands the same, we just haven't come across them yet. A snowflake is essentially a 6 sided shape, there just aren't enough variations to uphold the questions statement.

20090220153956AA3h9ZX	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Using Magic Late In Life: Who Is (Or Was) It?	OK, so when JK Rowling said "someone will use magic late in life", I know there were a lot of theories about Petunia Dursley, Arabella Figg, and even Argus Filch! My vote was always for Argus, since he was taking that Kwikspell Course back in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.      Now that all the books are out, I'm hearing a lot of talk that the person to use magic late in life was Molly Weasley when she said, "NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU *****!" and then killed Bellatrix Lestrange.      But we have seen Molly use magic before: her Accio charms to find all the twins' Ton-Tongue Toffees in Goblet Of Fire, her waving her wand at the potatoes and making them shoot out of their skins, and her making a creamy sauce come out of her wand when she was cooking. Plus, we are told by Ron in Chamber of Secrets that his parents can Apparate.      Now, I HAVE heard that these things were not classified as 'real magic'. But if nothing else, the Accio charm and Apparating were. So I don't think the person to use magic late in life was Molly.       We are told by Mrs. Figg that she is a Squib. And Argus is also obviously a Squib, or he wouldn't have been taking that course.      I've got no clue who it is (or was). Maybe Neville Longbottom? We didn't really see his magic skills kick in until Order of the Phoenix.      What does everyone else think?

20090220161540AAL2VAh	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Would you rather be rich or poor?	I just watched slumdog millionare last night. it was a great movie and i hope it wins every oscar it possibly can.      but back to my question. as i was watching the pitiful lives of these people and watching the the terrible ordeals they went through such as watching their own mother die, watch a little boy being blinded, having your own brother betray i still couldn't suppress the feeling of wanting to have their lives. despite the downsides of living in the slums like starvation, and death their lives still seem so much more fulfilling than the life of the average american. Maybe the reason i believe that is because i watched American Beauty just a couple of weeks ago and that was a satire on the life of the average suburban family.      anyway what do you think?

For a month or two, I've been skipping class so much that it's pretty much been me going every other week, or sometimes less than that. Usually each week I dread going. It's on Thursdays from 8-9 pm, and this week, I skipped again. I'm just not as into it as I used to be. I have, however, wanted to try ballroom since 8th grade or earlier, and I still really want to. My mom has been calling places to check them out, and so far she's found one that might have junior classes by summer (right now they only have private which is $40 an hour, and we can't afford that. I've been taking jazz at the same place for 3 years, and I'm afraid I'll regret it or make my teacher feel bad (like make her feel she wasn't a good teacher or something). And I have a friend there and don't know what she'd think. I'm afraid that if I quit, I won't find a place to do ballroom and won't have a dance class at all. I don't want to be seen as a quitter or someone who just gives up. I'm pretty sure I've only been to class once this month. What should I do??

My school is having spirit week next week and Monday is "disney character day" or something like that.      I'm thirteen, grade 8.       I'm trying to be someone people will know of when I tell them her name {I'm a girl and usually gender wouldn't matter but you'll see why I'm being specific in a little bit].   I want to try to work with a black dress i have and a black decorated headband. My hair is black and hangs a little bit lower than my shoulder blades {it's straight right now].       The thing is, I'm opposite of prep. I would like a dark character, maybe demented or evil. Anything it doesn't matter as long as I can work the mentioned articles of clothing in.      More information: The character doesn't have to be from disney or even a children's book. Just someone known. If this isn't possible, an unknown character will work. I'll just do the research to find out who they are.      Could you help? Thank you so much in advance!
20090220154320AAv9Zhu	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is God an emotional personality or just simply a unifying energy force?	I have read a vast amount of religious and spiritual text, that corroborates the concept that God is subject to the same level of emotional experience as mankind. I personally find it incredibly difficult to fully acknowledge and accept a God who's provision is dictated by the way he feels. My understanding is that our antecedents have interpreted God through various emotional states, and the same emotional connection to divine source is supported by millions today.   Many try to encapsulate God to a form that is understood through varying sentiments of warmth to induce an inward sense of his closeness, and if one does not follow his divine instruction, one will experience judgements and punishments.       I have also spent time in various communities where I have observed those who were happy, clapping in praise, in an emotional high when they felt Gods presence, and when these same individuals did not feel emotionally close they would quickly slip into a cloud of mild depression. Surely, A God built on emotion is certain to cause inward disharmony. I think many try to encapsulate the whole concept of God through an emotional connection, and so, render themselves to experience an emotional commotion of dejected states.  I do believe In creative force energy, but I cannot reduce my understanding to a limitation such as personality and Gender. I do respect others thoughts on this area, and I dont play my God is better than your God.   There are many things I do not fully understand and I simply wish harvest truths.
20090220152918AAcJxjP	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Advice on Piano lessons?	I'm 19 and starting my very first piano lesson on Tuesday. I'm very excited because I've always begged my parents to take me for lessons, but they could never afford it. Now, I have a steady job of my own and can do it.      I've played piano self taught for about two years, I can read treble clef somewhat well, due to a few years of playing the clarinet. That's about all of the music reading ability I have. I know some theory, but not a lot. I just found out that the teacher they have is a university student. I think she's in her third or final year, but it still has me a bit worried. I'm looking for serious learning, not just 'here, play this!' I want to know theory, the scales, chords in all of their variations, etc Also, my fingering and other bad habits that I've most likely picked up will need to be worked on.       I'm a bit worried that a university student may not have the ability to really expand on that. Then again, when I inquired, she has apparently been playing for quite a long while and the university is quite well known in my city for producing good music majors. Plus, living in a small town, it's difficult to find university educated teachers.      I have not spoken to her directly as of yet, but I will when I go in on Tuesday. How can I gauge her ability to see if it is in line with my needs? What sort of questions can I ask and how can I do so in a polite, non condescending manner?         I think it'll be great if she can live up to those expectations, because she's most likely near my age (which'll make it more interesting.) and maybe she can get me in to the university practice rooms. Even though I have a piano at home, the ones at the university are great!

20090220152907AAPnZCv	Arts & Humanities;Other - Arts & Humanities	How do you stop acting crazy in school?!?	Well I'm like a whole different person in home if you see how I act in school. In school I act  like I'm all fine and be really hyper and all and sometimes scream even... But in home I'm a totally different person. when I listen to my iPod whenever a sensitive lyric comes out or a sensitive song come out then I cry and can't stop... And I cry about everything that's going on in my life. I feel like committing suicide everyday, and so I tried to talk to my best friend who is really sweet. I told her at first I felt sick, she moved away from me a little and flinched. Then I told her that I was emotionally sick she said "oh." .  I told her I felt so alone and left out and wanted to commit suicide and she said " you go to hell if you do that. You don't wanna go there do you?" but that wasn't the answer I was looking for.  I needed help desperately... So I told her over and over again but when she said " I can't help you with that anymore. I told you what would happen when you commit suicide." and she went right back to talking to her other friend. So I went home and cried myself to sleep.... Like, if life was a big party then it feels like the party's over now. I don't want anyone to see my sensitive side so I act hyper and act like I'm the happiest person in the world. Then I come home and weep and cry. I feel safe and relieved when I'm around my "friends"... It looks like nothing can harm me. Then I come home. I lay down on my bed and tears ust roll down my cheeks and then the same thing happens again. I really wanna stop acting crazy in school as an excuse but I don't wanna let them see my true side. I don't wanna talk to anyone about my tre side and don't wanna let them know. The counselors repeat the same thing over and over again- be happy and stay positive. But how do you say positive when there's nothing to be happy about? so acting crazy in school became a habit- I actually begin to feel happy for bout a month. But then again I grew tired of everything and was so sick of everything... It's like I'm an atres that has to play a psycho when she just bsted out of rehab or whatever. So I decided that I need to stop right now. But I can't stop acting like that! When I just shut my mouth and be quiet my best friend didn't even notice that I was even there and kept talking with her friends. So I sent my aother best friend a message- and the next morning she came to me and hugged me and said it's alright. But it wasn't. Now I feel like I can't even control my life.    I'm always stressed about everything. I got bunch of hideous zit scars and small bump on my face that some people tease me about. Well only once in a while. And probably because of that I don't have a boyfriend. So how do you stop acting crazy? I need to stop it before the depression and the insanity takes my life over.

OK, who is extremely upset (or disappointed anyway) that Severus Snape AND Lord Voldemort died in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows?       I mean, I always figured the Dark Lord was toast from the word go, since he's the real villain in the story and in 9 out of 10 stories, fairy tales, etc, the bad guy dies and the good guy wins. That just the way it goes. It sucks. Just once, I'd like to see the bad guys win.      But why Severus Snape? Sure, he was playing both sides of the fence (and doing it better than Peter Pettigrew did), but he was a good guy in the end! Why did JK Rowling have to kill him off? He was one of my favorite characters, along with Draco Malfoy, Lucius Malfoy, Lord Voldemort, and Albus Dumbledore.      Geez, all that time and effort on Severus' part for nothing. I am just glad she didn't kill off Draco, or I'd never read anything Harry Potter-related again!       Oh, by the way, does anyone know if Lucius died or not?

I would love feedback)      I looked at him and smiled   The kinda smile where you bite your lip a little bit.   Emphasizing I wanted more.    I wanted him.    He caught on, but didn’t speak much.   We didn’t speak.    Loose and wild   We kissed.    So soft and sweet.   Summer sweat.    Smiled and bit my lip.      It was rough and gross   Real gross.    His goodnight kisses stuck onto me until the A.M   And he always wanted more more more.    Tried to keep myself occupied, but he always looked at me as vacant.   Lips would climb all over my face, in the middle of talking to my girls.    So I ran   To a new pair of summer chapped lips.       We were wild.    A kiss every night   Laugh it off and told to keep a secret.   We were both a big fat secret.   We would spill our hearts and    Give ourselves to someone else   During the day.   But at night…you couldn’t stop us   Palms clung to backs, lips brushed chests.   Hands gone where they shouldn’t.    Laughed and whispered   It’s a secret.      He said I was cute, as I told him   Not to bad yourself.   Interlocked my fingertips and held the back of my neck.    Like a newborn.   He knew what he was doing, so I went along.   And he taught me a lot.    It was rowdy and new,    Becoming intoxicating.   Those eighty-degree nights witnessed our bodies   Rocking in unisons.   And it was good   Oh so good.

20090203063737AAbDj6J	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this any good? Suggestions for improvement...?	I'm 15 and I'm writing a novel set about 100 years ago. This is the very beginning, and it's the first draft which is yet to be edited. Do you have any suggestions for improvement?      Btw, you will not gain much information from it, I just want to know what you think of my writing itself. I welcome constructive criticism, so please be generous!      One step higher was all it took, just one step, and I was flying. I stretched my arms out just a little wider as a healthy breeze blew through my hair, through my fingertips. The effect worked best when ones eyes were firmly closed. The air was moist with fresh, salty vapour and I breathed deeply, tasting it on tongue. Laughing in sheer delight at this newly found freedom, I was thrilled to hear it echoed back to me; the very skies calling back, sharing my joy and willing me to fly higher, to accompany them in what was the beginning of forever.      “Elizabeth, whatever are you doing?” Like a bird, which had found his destination, I came crashing back down to earth, to reality. Unlike him though, this bird’s journey was not yet complete.      “Mother! What are you doing out here? You gave me a terrible fright.” I exclaimed timidly. I jumped off hastily out of the small dingy that resided along the quay near many other, much larger ships.      “Your father is running late this evening.” Her eyes, faded grey throughout her many years, tightened as she mentioned Papa. Perhaps she was worried that the very reason he was out late was the very same reason half the docking workers were out late this evening – because the beer was cheaper on Sundays.      I let mother take me by the hand and lead me away from the harbour, towards a more sheltered, but far less intriguing area, that was home. She barely uttered a word but trudged us up the sloping paths in near silence.
20090203063107AAge6XQ	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Under construction ... a poem in the making I hope?	I'm trying really hard here to get back into the writing mood.   I came up with this today.      ALL ANY EVERY criticism welcome, needed.      It's a hot fire poker    being removed from my chest   or a dagger    from the pit of my stomach   It's years of restraints    upon my soul finally released.   Fear leaves me,    but slowly because fear    fears it's own return.   My memories can't leave,    they can only be covered by transparencies.   I won't hide my true self.    I'm an open book.   The truth is -    what you want to discover    is up to you.   What you want to save,    salvage, toss, rummage is up to you.   Later on - if you see things    you don't want to see   my hope is you will stay    and search what lies beneath   the poker, the dagger, the restraints, the fear and the transparencies.   I won't lie to you.   You're smart enough   to read between the lines.

20090203062821AAKoF0a	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Do you like my poem; or is it too petulant?	(On First Looking in to Penrose's `The Road to Reality')      A ffine translation all encompasses   To map the fixed points of geometry,   Whose one point here compactifies a sea   Which drowned a myriad Ulyssesses.   Much I have travelled twixt those fell passes'   Euclidean domains, and brewed my tea,   Like a stout tourist factoring infinity;   Penrose's royal `Road' is very nice!   Then felt I like some ruler of the skies   When a geodesic bends into his ken,   The sun and moon disrobed of their disguise   And relativity uniting men;   Not warring, nor strung up in wild surmise,   Caught playing Twister with a baryon.
