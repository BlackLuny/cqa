99kYSEp0aa	Getting Rid of Bed Bugs-<br>  Once an infestation has occurred, patience and persistence is the key to ridding the area of bed bugs. It isn't enough to clean the mattresses and launder the sheets. Furniture should be overturned and cleaned. Carpeting, wood molding, door jambs, picture frames, and closets should be inspected as well. Bed bugs can hide behind loose wallpaper, in the crevices between carpets and walls, behind outlet covers, and inside light fixtures, smoke detectors, and even clocks. Removable, washable items can be laundered in very hot water. For those areas or items which can not be laundered, smaller items can be wrapped in plastic and set in a hot place or in direct sunlight. The key is to raise the temperature to at least 120 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours to kill the eggs and the bugs. Vacuuming and steam cleaning may also be done, but any bags or canisters should be thrown away or emptied outside of the area immediately to prevent another infestation. The best method of removing bed bugs, however, is through a professionally handled treatment.|`|944iJNAdaa	You don't need to replace mattresses, mattress covers work just fine.  Heat kills bedbugs, too (like putting things in the dryer).  The most thorough information I've seen on bedbugs (with color photos) is from the U.S. Department of Defense - they must have problems with them too.  Read this to know everything about bedbugs:<br>  <a href="http://www.afpmb.org/pubs/tims/TG44/TG44.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.afpmb.org/pubs/tims/TG44/TG44...</a>|`|frUYhmuYaa	if there are blood spots on your sheets, you have them. the only way to get rid of them is to clean your room thoroughly, get carpet cleaned professionally, and -unfortunately- get a new bed(only way to make sure all of them are out as they live in side the mattresses) ALSO its a good idea to call a exterminator to spray for bedbugs to prevent them from coming back

5CYn53zSaa	They should first be sprayed in the autumn-after the leaves have fallen, and you've raked up all the debris (because the moth larvae and insects overwinter then crawl back up into the tree in spring).  This should be done when rain is not imminent.  You should do it again in early spring and just before the tree buds out.  I use copper and neem oil.  Be sure to read the ingredients to make sure whatever you use is safe for fruit trees--stone fruit.|`|d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	Most likely it's Plum Curculio.  Spray with insecticide starting when 3/4 of the flowers petals have fallen off the tree. (If you spray while the tree is in full flower - you risk killing the pollinating insects, which will result in not much fruit setting.)<br>  <br>  So, start at petal fall, and continue for 4-6 weeks at 7 to 10 day intervals.

c3gWInITaa	should say what c.f.m. is some where on box or on compressor. Thats what you really want to know with compressors.|`|aEeCCHVlaa	Being new, there should be an owner's manual/ pamphlet in the box.  If you can't find it, look on the data plate, usually mounted either on the motor or on the tank.  It will give you all the information.  The psi is of two settings: one for turning the compressor on (if in automatic) and the other for shut off.  The shut off psi is also the maximum amount of pressure produced by that compressor.  CFM is cubic feet/ minute and is the amount of air discharged by the compressor.  The motor hp is the size of the motor needed to run the computer efficiently.|`|L8zmQS8Jaa	First by "the the recovery time" I am assuming that the questioner is wondering how long it will take for the compressor to pump the tank up to full pressure after a pressure drop.  It is non standard question as it is dependent up both the power of the compressor and the amount of the drop.  The regulator on a compressor has a cut in pressure and a cut out pressure.  In this case the cut out is about 125 psi.  But the cut in pressure will vary according to manufacturer and the recovery time will be dependent upon both the power of the compressor and if tools are being used while the compressor is recovering it's full pressure.1  My 18 gage tacker takes a lot less air than a jack hammer.  If I was trying to use a jack hammer it could probably not recover enough to keep using the tool, but the 18 gage tacker makes almost no difference.   On the other hand CFM (cubic feet per minute) at a uniform PSI is a measure of the capacity of the compressor separate from the motor's power rating.  <br>  <br>  The capacity of the compressor's motor may be listed on the required label in watts, amps or hp.  Often watts or hp is omitted.  Watts divided by the required voltage equals the amps (or V x A = Watts.)2  So a 1500 watt compressor running at 120 volts will be approx 12.5 amps.  The same 1500 watt compressor if it required 240 volts will require 1/2 the amps or 6.25 approx.  <br>  <br>  Hp requires another conversion.  1 hp = 746 watts so the conversion would be in the same example 1500 watts/746 watts = about 2hp.  But this is the input HP and output HP would be less due to an efficiency rating.  The formula is (Output) Horsepower = 1.73 x I x E x Eff x pf/746   Fewer people know this off the top of their heads.*  You shouldn't be required to be one of them.  It may be listed on the motor or in the spec page in the manual.3<br>  <br>  So much for information.  But looking at your perspective as a seller, you are not required to make conversions like this for a second hand unit.  You only have to say what the label on the motor says.  If it is rated in volts and amps then that is what you should give.  If you know the make and model (should also be on the label of the motor) than that is what you should give.   If you have a CFM or a PSI rating then give that.  It should be possible to look these things up on the web knowing the manufacturer and model number.  If you have the owner's manual it should be on the spec. page.  Trying to give information you don't know or deriving through calculations you are not familiar with is a formula for problems.  A potential buyer has to be responsible for what this means.  "Caveat emptor",  "let the buyer beware" (4) is a rule of law that is only modified by implied warranties in the UCC (uniform commercial code.)  So be concerned that you are not impling something that you don't mean.  (Like an amount of expertise you don't intend to suggest.)|`|0h9aD7Toaa	What ever it say's for horse power is probably not a real number, and recovery, how big is the tank?? if it's in a box it's probably a pretty small one, 4 gallons at 125, maybe 6 cfm at 60 psi, look for something like that, once you start to get bigger you see 25 gallons per minute at 175 psi, that is my small one, look in the book, if it doesn't state it it might be one of the Chinese ones that pump about 6 cfm at 20 psi that people bring back|`|frUYhmuYaa	PSI has nothing to do with horsepower. Google horsepower motor calculations to calculate total horsepower(math formulas). OR you could look on the nameplate attached to the air compressor. look for amount of SCFM on nameplate for recovery time. example, 9.9 SCFM -----   OR  -----         CFM @125 PSI----17|`|YqBOf1Yraa	The horse power rating should be on the motor. The recovery time is how many cubic feet per minute ( cfm ) it can pump and should be on the compressor part listed something like 7.2,-5.3, cfm etc.

Plants that need to be planted out later than that date will do poorly if you put them in too soon.<br>  <br>  If you are in Northern Ohio, that would be May 15th.  If you are in Southern Ohio, it would be roughly  a week or two earlier. <br>  <br>  What you can plant out now depends on WHAT you are planting.<br>  <br>  Onions and peas you can plant in the ground near the end of March.  Peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes don't go into the ground until after the last frost date.<br>  <br>  Strawberries you can get at local nurseries or garden centers, several roots per pot or bag.  Separate them out, and plant them leaves up, roots down, with the "crown" (the place where the leaves and roots meet) right at ground level.  You can plant them now, or as soon as you find them available in your area.<br>  <br>  Best advice I can give a beginner gardener is to start small.  There is always more to learn, and planting a big garden, and then being overwhelmed, is a recipe for frustration and failure.<br>  <br>  Go to your local garden store or nursery, and see what they have.  Start with live plants, rather than seeds.  You can add seeds to your repertoire as you gain experience.  Seeds are a lot harder than plants, especially if you have to start them inside.<br>  <br>  In Ohio, you'll find primrose and pansies and violas (flowers) right now.

pWXEdbZFaa	Step 1- Gathering The Necessary Items <br>  <br>  You will need some common household items on hand when it comes time to clean your barbeque grill. <br>  <br>  Brass wire grill brush Steel wool pads, preferably that contains soap already. Mild dish soap Sponge or dishcloth Spray cooking oil Dry baking soda Aluminum foil <br>  <br>  Step 2- Brushing Your Grill Off <br>  <br>  The first thing that should always be done to your grill is a routine brushing. Using your brass wire grill brush (or other brush suitable to your type of grill) you should brush off all the surfaces. By routinely brushing your barbeque grill, you will prevent any type of buildup. If buildup from food is left to long, it can become increasingly difficult to remove, and can end up causing problems such as rust. <br>  <br>  Step 3- Spray Cooking Oil <br>  <br>  Once you are sure that your grill is free of all buildup and debris, and that your grill is completely cooled off, you will want to spray it down with a light layer of cooking oil. Spraying it down with cooking oil will prevent your barbeque grill from rusting. It is especially important to make sure you barbeque grill is completely cold, as spraying cooking oil on a hot surface may cause the oil to heat up and ignite, which could be potentially dangerous to you and your barbeque grill. <br>  <br>  Step 4- Use Baking Soda and Aluminum Foil on Your Grill Baking soda is a very nice cleaning and polishing agent. Once you have removed any extra debris and buildup, lightly scrubbing your barbeque grill with baking soda will give it that extra shine, similar to the day that you brought it home from the store. This can also be used on handles and knobs to remove any extra buildup tat cannot be taken off with a wire brush. <br>  <br>  Aluminum foil can also be used to keep your grill looking nice. Gently rub the aluminum foil on your grill, and you will notice that it removes grim and buildup. This is a cheap and inexpensive way to clean your grill. <br>  <br>  Step 5- Clean Your Racks <br>  <br>  The racks in your grill are especially important as this is where the food touches when it is cooking. You will have to use the wire brush to remove as much buildup as possible. Once you remove as much as possible, start washing the racks with dish soap. If the racks are really dirty, you may also want to use the steel wool pads. Be sure to completely rinse off all soap and residue before cooking on these racks again.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Diluted water with muriatic acid.|`|c07v7O80aa	Stay away from acids if you can. Try Nevr-Dull.

D6Noxxz1aa	more information would be needed to acurately give you an average cost.  for example, stainless steel appliances cost more than basic white/bone.  white would cost $1000-2000, depending on model and brand, where stainless would cost anywhere from $2000-5000+.  without knowing counter sizes, i couldn't give an estimate.  formica counters are cheaper than granite.  flooring depends on cost of material, size of floor, and any specialties for labor--preparation, designs, etc.  total cost for a small floor would start at about $300-500.<br>  good luck!|`|19b7bd1dd32149738cfd8fca874ffda8aa	$9000.00|`|6N5U9Fy2aa	Call or go to your local LOWES store and check out the prices and have an employee help you out !|`|qzDTOE3Maa	The answer depends on what features you're looking for, as appliances and counter tops vary widely in price.  <br>  <br>  In general, though, you should keep your kitchen remodel priced in line with your home's value.

UYaWH7a0aa	Mine continually bleed even though I was them inside out in cold water - I aboslutely LOVE the shout color catchers - you will notice a HUGE difference in your clothes and any dye that bleeds out goes into that little piece of paper/cloth (whatever it is) instead of on your other clothes - you will notice that piece will be SO dark from dyes even on older clothes that you didn't realize still gave off dyes. The Color Catchers are worth their cost, I truly swear by them!|`|Fpvauewkaa	Wash them in cold water, inside out.  That should help.  No matter what though, they will bleed for a while.|`|QsVMeaPXaa	Step1.Turn all of your jeans inside out before washing them. Washing them this way reduces friction on the outside of the jeans, where the color matters. <br>  Step2Pile all of the dirty jeans into the washing machine. Set the water temperature dial to the coldest water possible, and add the smallest amount of detergent that will get the load reasonably clean. If possible, use a liquid detergent specially formulated for dark fabrics. <br>  Step3Pour one cup of salt into the load of laundry and start the wash cycle. The salt helps set the color and slows fading. <br>  Step4Allow jeans to hang dry rather than put them in the dryer. Dry them inside-out over a clothesline or shower curtain rod. <br>  Step5Turn dry jeans right side out and hang properly. If you must iron them, turn them inside out again first. Ironing fades fabrics very quickly, but if you iron from the inside, you minimize the damage.

E5gaKzCsaa	I suppose it depends on exactly how well sealed you need it to be. If you need it totally leakproof in every way, you probably will have to pay for that service. Most cities have places that sell packaging, and/or places that will package things for you. Look in the phone book under "packaging" or "shipping supplies", or even "mailing". Use the paper copy of the phone book since this kind of inquiry can make a sane person crazy when they try doing it with the on line phone book, at least the one where I live.<br>  <br>  If you only need this package very well wrapped, I'd use some heavy plastic and a tape gun and lots of tape.|`|675390202407ced9223dcc6b917599d2aa	It won't help dude, the dogs can still detect it.|`|fTDrzAiMaa	get someone at a grocery store to cry-o-vac it

tPGxPDvBaa	Unfortunately none will do well.  I have tried fescue, bermuda, zoysis - none can stand up to foot(paw) traffic.  Putting down a path & hoping the dogs will mostly use it rather than the grass might help.  I would suggest centipede or one of the zoysis grasses that grow slow but thicker than most as the better ones.|`|YY24gmRpaa	Artificial turf.|`|hd8z7eNRaa	This is a tough question no turf will take constant traffic without eventually giving up. If you are meaning a well traveled pathway you would like to seed with grass your efforts may be dissappointing.In this case it would be better to make the pathway permanent.Use stones, bark or whatever material is suitable for your landscape design.<br>  <br>  If you simply mean that you have dogs and children that are always outside romping around it depends on the size of the grassy area. If the area is very small it may be very hard to keep it green. <br>  Also if you are planning a new lawn it will take time to establish itself before it is able to withstand the pressures of high traffic.There are a lot of variables to take into consideration. It also depends on your climate as to what grasses will do best.<br>  Ryegrass is a turfgrass used for sports fields. A mix of bluegrass and ryegrass maybe.

Wherever you decide to increase you simply put the same type of stitch that you have been using, in the same hole as the last stitch you put there.  If your directions say to increase two then you put an extra stitch in the last two stitches of the row you are working on or in the next two stitches of the row you are working on-whichever the case may be.  Not all increases are done at the end of a row, you put them in when the directions tell you to.

Ofcourse that would begin with shelter under a bush and move on to twig or log homes and caves.  Then later in different climates some homes were built of mud brick, some were wood and stood on stilts above the water, while others were built of ice (igloos), made from animal skins (wigwams), adobe clay or logs.  Today, many of the same old techniques persist in other parts of the world, while in America many  people are turning to the non traditional home that is built of adobe, centers in a cave, hallow volcano, or is made of logs.  Still others have sought out places like former churches, stores, banks and lighthouses to adapt into a unique style of home. However, most commonly in America the traditional home may be a used one like the ones built in the victorian era or later, one composed of stucco on the outside, etc-or it may be an entirely new construction. <br>   New material bulworks which are common include frame which means wood, with or without stone facades or details or they may be constructed outside with brick or some other stone.  Over the years lannen stone has shown some popularity.  Another trend worth mentioning is the prefab home which is precut and later fitted together.  Additionally there has also been an increased interest in mobile home living which has come to include the manufactured double wide home trends.  Whatever you are looking for in a home today you can usually find it, and if you can't, then you can build it.|`|AA12161775	well talk about the different styles and time piodes of house the tell how different houses look in different states... why houses are better them apartments ( no one under or above u) tell what kind of house u live in.....ummm and the types of houses( like bungalo, trallor's ....)

yAP1cDMXaa	Los arbustos que puedes elegir son muchísimos pero tiene que tener en cuenta que cantidad de sol  tienes durante el día para que la planta crezca en plenitud y elegiría una de dé muchas flores. Yo recurriría a un vivero. En cuanto a otro tipo de decoración; eligiría una fuente. Las hay de piedra sintética y de muchos tama?os: son muy decorativas y atractivas y si es posible iluminada con una fuente de luz dicroica además un juego de jardín de forja y a mí me gustan las estatuas en cemento blanco de figuras humanas.

Otra opción a parte de un arbusto, y si no quieres  pasto puedes conbinar la alfombrilla con  arboles miniatura para exterior , obien  cactaceas, puedes hacer peque?os circulos con panalillo y hacer figuras ( lo único que me tiene con duda es  el clima y la posición del jardín, muchas veces el sol  da todo el día o solo por unas horas eso en ocaciones afecta el desarrollo de las plantas) hay hermosas placas para jardin o lamparas con figuras de insectos o estacas, te recomiendo sobretodo que siempre este limpio y cuidado, no lo recargues de adornos,  esto para que cuando lo observes siempre te de una sensación de bienestar, y no de un comedero de pollos o una especie de pantano sin ton ni son.|`|4y9cy3c3aa	cactus quedan bien en un jardin chico y les salen flores de vivos colores en verano y aguantan mucho tiempo sin regar|`|71ea9c40e6b35909b7543ed10531883caa	sino quieres cesped, y colocas piedritas, queda muy lindo poner gramineas como pennisetum rubra o villosum, la 1o tiene hojas acintadas color bordó y la 2o color verde.Ambas tienen como flor unos delgados penachos.Yo tengo en mi jardin ambas, no dan trabajo.<br>  Tambien queda muy linda la Bouganvillea glabra (Santa Rita) , yo la tengo podada en redondo como un miniarbolito.<br>  Aqui las puedes ver:<br>  <a href="http://www.construir.com/econsult/Construr/Nro62/document/plantas.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.construir.com/econsult/Constr...</a><br>  Además puedes poner crisantemos enanos, los hay dobles y de muchos colores, dan flores durante todo el invierno<br>  <a href="http://www.plantasyhogar.com/jardin/flores/flor/?pagina=jardin_flores_flor_011_011" rel="nofollow">http://www.plantasyhogar.com/jardin/flor...</a><br>  <br>  Suerte!!!|`|ZTqxR3F2aa	un hada o una fuente decorativa tambien plantitas|`|evwPnVzTaa	po rosales , o quizas un arbol grande como un manzano.-

AA11065180	I didn't touch main one and it's flowering nearly all the time|`|3xw5mE9Laa	both good answers, nothing more to add|`|jgP51MlRaa	Flowers of the Phalaenopsis Orchid have superb longevity. You can often urge a second flowering from each spike with a timely pruning. <br>  <br>  When the last flower of the spike fades, you should examine the spike, looking for small fleshy bumps or nodes. From the base of the spike count out 3 nodes (count only the green fleshy nodes - ignore any that are dried out). Cut the spike one inch above the third node. <br>  <br>  If your plant is healthy and the season is not too late, this process will wake up one or two of the nodes and in a few short weeks it may produce a new spray of fresh blooms. By trying this you could enjoy flowers for nearly 6 months of the year on the same plant.

If the bulbs have been allowed to dry out BEFORE you planted them, there is a fair chance that the bulbs will recover, but not this year! Plant them now in a good soil/potting compost mix 4-6 inches deep, water moderately and ignore! It is possible to produce new Lilies from `scales`(segments of the Lily bulb),but unless you are an avid gardener, buying new bulbs is quicker.

BTJN4AFbaa	Instead of trying the hay thing...which harbors fleas! If you have any left over fencing from previous repairs, where the dogs are digging lay that fencing actually on the ground and cover it with the dirt. You may also try connecting the fencing to what is already installed, and laying it down on the ground. You have to kind of bury the fencing so the dogs can't dig. The dogs won't be able to dig through the fencing. My brother uses this technique with his hunting dogs.<br>  <br>   I would not suggest the hay though, unless you are prepared to spend a lot of money on pest control, rats and mice are also attracted to the hay as well.

So, you could really have a Victorian room that used feng shui when deciding the layout. If this room is very open to the rest of the house, the colors and styles should flow from one to to the other. If it is a private retreat or den type of room, you can have a very different style. And it should be something you find very pleasing and relaxing since you are likely the one who will be spending the most time there.|`|NiwVWi7Haa	If you r going according to the Asian way, then it must be Fengshui way.

f4Nn0W1xaa	If you like hostas you should plant them because nothing is easier care or hardier than a hosta, unless it's a daylily.  You really don't have to feed them. In fact you don't really have to do anything to them, even the really fancy looking ones.  They like a nice drink on a hot dry day as much as any plant but they will cheerfully thrive with no attention at all.  They come in all sizes and many colors and textures. They spread rapidly so that you can soon divide them for more plants or just have whopping great specimens.They are hardy to zone 3 and most rodents don't care for them, though deer do. If your pansies are happy where you have them then the odds are that hosta will be too.  You really can't go wrong with this plant.<br>  <br>  Just for fun here's a link to page after page of images so that you can see the range of appearance available:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images?_adv_prop=image&fr=slv8-hptb5&va=hosta+lily&sz=all">http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...</a><br>  <br>  I guess I've made it clear that I'm a hosta fan!

Basically, what you are looking for is a tightly woven fabric with some weight and drapiness. You can use velvets or microsuedes for luxurious drapes.

If you are into saving furnace fuel (gas, heating oil, or whatever you heat with) then you want to enjoy your fireplace before you start using the furnace for the winter. <br>  <br>  You see when you use a wood fireplace or gas log fireplace it tends to drag air out of the home and cast it out the chimney, this is referred to as your homes "stack effect". While the air in your home, that your furnace worked hard to heat up, is making a mass exodus out of your chimney, the home starts breathing in through the windows and doors jambs and other weak points in the homes envelope. So essentially when you use the fireplace you are swapping your warm interior air for cold outside air without knowing it. This in turn makes your furnace work harder to heat the inside air. It also is the reason your house feels so cold when you step away from the fireplace heat.<br>  <br>  So, If you wait too long and use your fireplace after the weather is colder you will in fact make your heating bills go up.<br>  <br>  Here is what I do to enjoy the fireplace as much as I can. In the fall I burn wood in the fireplace occasionally, but when the weather gets cold enough that I start using the furnace, then I plug the fireplace nice and tight with a chimney balloon and use it as a pleasant place to burn candles for the winter. that way i still get flickery ambiance without the energy loss. When Spring comes again and I stop using the furnace, then i know I am ok to use the fireplace to burn wood again.|`|bce80d39eb52f5b2d6cb88d831eb8b8eaa	Just put the bin out and it feels cold outside now.  Its been a clear sunny day and as dusk approaches there are no clouds so will assume it will be a chilly night.  Have your fire and enjoy it, a cheerful fire also lifts your spirits if you are feeling a bit low.  If you feel you need to save money because you are having an early fire then have toast for tea - toasted on a long fork in front of the fire with some wonderful cheddar or strawberry jam.|`|KTeztymJaa	Save the firewood till winter when you really need it...55 is not bad just put on a sweater and nightcap.|`|mAU1ph7Xaa	no its cold a great temp. for one. not too cold not to hot.

AA10622511	I would treat the stain by itself first.  Can you use a little bit of bleach on the stain?  Peroxide or color safe bleach is best for blood.  Oxi Clean is really good on blood too.  Either way, run the water in the washer (warm or hot) and add detergent and whatever else you're using (baking soda or Borax are also good choices).

Use only half of the recommended dosage.<br>  <br>  Use only high end brand, like Clorox.<br>  <br>  <br>  :-)|`|dXQurEZGaa	Peroxide works best if the stain hasn't been set.  (washed and dried)  Otherwise, I bleach my whites always, including sheets.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  (and remember accidents happen)|`|PACRNVuFaa	put them in a tub or bucket with one cup of salt, and fill up with cold water. It may have been to late now as you have to do it straight away plus if you use bleach or hot water it will leave a stain behind as it sets the stain in.<br>  I would stick it in the washing machine on cold water with the salt in it and wash straight away, then wash it again through another cycle it may remove most of it just give it a go hope you get the stain out<br>  |`|lObEjUh1aa	Bleach is always worth a try; put a half a capfull into the washing machine with the sheets.  There is probably a "liquid bleach" dispenser built into the washing machine, but if not, just wait for the water to rise at least a few inches, then pour the bleach in.  Put the sheets in last.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps; good luck!|`|AA11021965	peroxide gets blood of wonderfully then wash regularly|`|D2BbZ8Fkaa	do not bleach until you read washing info. on label, you could have them dry cleaned.
