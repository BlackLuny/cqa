unpkAJR1aa	yes you can you just have to buy a s-video cable or vga cable or hdmi cable or dvi cable depends what kind of port your pc has.|`|YESUhp8gaa	Ya sure, I hear people doing that here every day.<br>  <br>  You would need an adapter or special cable if nether the tv or laptop can use HDMI<br>  <br>  You would need to see what video out ports you have on your coputer and what video in ports you tv has.<br>  For example My laptop has a 7 pin s-video port and my tv has a 4-pin s-video port with compost. I would just need a 7-pin s-video port to 4-pin s-video port with comppost port to connect my laptop to the tv.<br>  <br>  Not to long ago I answered some ones question about how to connect her laptop to an older tv model. She decribe that she had an vga video port and the old analog RCA ports on her tv. I showed her a link for an VGA to the yellow analog RCA port for video and showed her a line out to red/white anlong RCA port for sound. SO she could view her laptop on the tv.|`|XngNaB7kaa	it pretty much depends on if your computers video card allows you to do it. the ones that support that kind of connection usually come with a cable that has a yellow end, like the ones on the dvd players, etc...|`|GOKf9Upnaa	most of new graphic cards has a tv-out so you need a new graphic card.

Could be the magnet going in your speaker, like you suggested. Sometimes they lose their shielding. Could be another source of magnetic interference near your computer. Try moving the speakers further away from the monitor. If that doesn't work, try moving your computer to a different location. If that doesn't work, maybe you have to get a new monitor.

They should have wiped it clean and left it with only the OS.<br>  <br>  You bought a computer, not the software on it.  If you want the software you'll need to purchase licenses for it.  A "get around" would be the same as software piracy and that is illegal.<br>  <br>  What you should do is contact the school where you purchased it and ask them to clean up the harddrive for you and then you can add your own programs - after you legally purchase and register them.<br>  <br>  Do it the legal way.

0ceb2737cec553fe943f36ed0cc63d61aa	First question - you should have given this info in your question.  Are you using any type of online service to access this or the earlier account?<br>  <br>  IF yes, then you should suspect that there is a hijacker or trojan on your computer that is stealing your passwords.   Stop using the internet to access any account until you solve that issue.<br>  <br>  Second question - are you running any kind of anti-virus AND anti-spyware software?  If not, you should have been.<br>  <br>  If the answer is no to the second question, then download these two program, and install them.  Use each to scan your machine to remove any possible mal-ware that could be stealing your info.<br>  <br>  AVG Free  anti-virus   (do not install two anti-virus programs at once - remove any old program, even if you do not use it, before installing AVG.)<br>  <a href="http://free.avg.com/download?prd=afe" rel="nofollow">http://free.avg.com/download?prd=afe</a><br>  ( NOTE: Use only the link in very small type at the lower left of the page, not any other one on the page.  )<br>  <br>  Spybot: Search & Destroy  anti-spyware anti-malware.<br>  <a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/mirrors/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.safer-networking.org/en/mirro...</a><br>  (Use any of the links in the center of the page from safer-networking.  They ask for a donation, your option.)<br>  <br>  When asked about using active scanning, say yes.  Once installed and updated, run a scan with each program on your entire system.  Then you should boot into safe mode and run the scans again to make sure you have cleaned out any offending programs.  <br>  <br>  (Safe Mode - reboot the machine and hit the F8 key once every second until the boot menu loads - text menu.  Select the option of Safe Mode with networking.   Wait for windows to load in safe mode.  This will take a very long time and will look very different from anything you are used to seeing.  Once in safe mode, and you have acknowledged the warning that you are in safe mode. You should open AVG and run a full scan, then open Spybot and again run a full scan.   Once finished, reboot your machine and allow it to go into normal windows mode.)<br>  <br>  Now that you have a clean machine, open Spybot and run the Immunizer program you will see listed on the main menu.  This will protect you from thousands of bad programs, by preventing them from ever loading onto your machine.<br>  <br>  Now comes the hard part.<br>  <br>  You should go to every account you use that has a password, and change that password to something new.  This in absolutely needed for any financial institution.  <br>  <br>  Then go to PayPal and setup an account.   Link it to your email, so that your email can not be linked to a fake you set up by someone else.  Use as long and complex a password as PayPal will allow.  <br>  <br>  Also know that most people get scammed by people who send fake emails, that look like they are from your bank or PayPal or others, but which have bogus links that take you to sites that are designed to steal your identity.  NEVER open a link in such an email, even if it looks legitimate.   <br>  Go to the web site you would normally use to access the account and look for alerts or warnings inside the site.  If they had really sent an email to you about an issue, it will be on the site as well, in case you were to log onto the site before you had checked your email.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that your financial institutions do not need to know anything about your info, it is already on file.  If they are trying to make sure it is you, they would be giving you info and asking you to verify it, not asking you to type it in first.|`|jPwbOFnAaa	Sounds like somehow they opened a paypal account with your personal info how they got that is another story but is really the only thing I could think of maybe youve got a trojan that can get all your personal info in your computer if you do online banking dont want to scare you but there are many ways theives can steal|`|tOCESHLYaa	If you use your computer to access your account.

Just make sure you write down all of your extensions that you've added so you can go back and download them again.<br>  <br>  I'm using 3.0.6 right now.<br>  <br>  EDIT: WOW!

Maybe you need to uninstall FF altogether, use something like CCleaner to get all the files FF leaves behind and start with a "clean" install of your previous version that worked if you saved and backed up the exe file.

pUzJiMUcaa	Perl will give you some insight into some of the finer workings of things...but man, alive...I would never wish it on a newbie. Perl is one of those languages that takes a lot of heat from other programmers, because using it means your life revolves around Regular Expressions. RegEx is hard stuff. If I had to categorize the hardest things to get down in Programming, they'd be OOP, Memory Management, and RegEx (no particular order, I got OOP like a pro but struggled with memory management, some of my peers are the exact opposite).<br>  <br>  All that said, I'd start with something that introduces you to PROGRAMMING. Not a language, per se (but you will use one), but learn the basics of how to program. Learn what a variable REALLY is. Learn the basics of boolean logic/algebra. Learn how a program actually works, and what it is at the lowest common denominator (instructions).<br>  <br>  Maybe it's because I'm looking back, but the best reference I've seen is MIT's Open Courseware. It's free, and it comes from one of the best places you can learn programming. Check out some of the basics here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Eng...</a><br>  <br>  Don't concern yourself too much with a language. It takes years to be a PRO with a language (even though people constantly pop in and say "I learned Java today! What should I learn next?" These people know jack).<br>  <br>  Concern yourself with learning how to program. This is the first mistake that sets a lot of programmers down the wrong path, they focus on a language. They never learn how to THINK like a programmer.<br>  <br>  It's hard, don't ever kid yourself. That's what makes it awesome.

It can often cure the problem of lost connections after the removal of Adware components or improper uninstall of firewall applications or other tools that modify the XP network and Winsock settings. If you encounter connection problems after removing network related software, Adware or after registry clean-up; and all other ways fail, then give WinSock XP Fix a try. It can create a registry backup of your current settings, so it is fairly safe to use. I actually tested it on a test machine* that was having a Winsock problem due to some Adware removal, and after running the utility and rebooting, the connectivity was restored. <br>  <br>  Download this and keep it handy<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/winsockxpfix.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/winsockxpfi...</a><br>  <br>  Finally, once you have Windows re-installed with all of the above security software, go to control panel and look for user accounts. Click on your account and add a password. Make it a tough to guess one.<br>  <br>  Then, create a new account, make it a limited account, and give it a hard to guess password as well. Use this limited account to surf the net and check emails, IM and that sort of thing. never use the administrator account for network things, only use the administrator account to install software.<br>  <br>  Any malware you get on your PC using the limited account is almost harmless, with the above tools installed, you should have fairly good protection.<br>  <br>  Now, one last thing you should do. Get a router if you don't already have one. It doesn't have to be expensive, but one that gives you a built in firewall w/NAT.<br>  <br>  Another good anti-spyware is Spybot search and destroy. you can get it here.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/download/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.safer-networking.org/en/downl...</a>|`|O8yEuX3zaa	McAfee Total Protection or McAfee Internet Security you should be able to find it at a Staples store.|`|FEgJH3Ajaa	Well avg is ok,but you may also need anti-spyware and ad ware programs also a fire wall.Go to sites like nonags.com and cnet.com,for reviews on these programs.You can buy programs from Mfgr via a phone call if not over the internet.Check AVG site for latest updates,and what types of virus are around also.

WeZcSZvKaa	Quite easy to work out. A Gb is 8,388.608 Megabits. A 20 Mb connection downloads at around about 20,000 Kbps, so it will take you the grand total of 0.419 seconds! But that also depends where your downloading it from and the time!<br>  <br>  Presuming the 20 Mb connection is Virgin's fibre optic cable broadband you will near enough get the 20 Mb connection.<br>  <br>  I'm on the 10 Mb cable and my download is around 9980 Kbps.|`|IbxhRebgaa	It's impossible to calculate without the upstream of the remote server. <br>  <br>  Relatively speaking, however, 20Mbps is ridiculously fast. Most residential users will never be able to saturate that line.|`|O9nVXpS6aa	Well, just because your broadband company says you get 20mbps, that is most likely not the case. Most of the time it is not... that is pretty much the 'highest point' it can go to. But really, unless the webserver you are connecting to is really close by you and has a really fast connection, you are not going to get nearly these speeds. With that being said, you can check out how fast you are actually getting with this cool free website that tests it out for you: <a href="http://speedtest.net/" rel="nofollow">http://speedtest.net/</a><br>  <br>  But based on that though it won't take too too long. If you get a 5mbps connection to the server it will take about 3-4 min.

What is your system ram?<br>  <br>  If so, its not 512 Ram, it shares that with your system ram.  And onboard graphics are horrible for gaming.|`|QUQY3HQYaa	Yeah. Its because memory isn't the only part of a graphics card that makes a game run. There are shaders and processors and a whole lot of stuff. Just because your graphics card has ram that doesn't make it fast. It helps but its just not enough. Your best bet is to update your graphics card and buy a new one. Also a 2.2 ghz processor isn't very fast even if its dual core. You can not expect to get a good gaming experience when you have sub par hardware.|`|043b8e6dd8b85857994ec289d993a150aa	Onboard graphics are slow. The card is using your RAM for Video RAM.

RCZhENqAaa	Why bring trouble to yourself because of DDR3? The motherboards for AMD/AM3 are a tad priceier than AM2+ but both can run AM3 processors with the latter running it with DDR2 rather than DDR3. Your options for Intel are even worse with i7 because their prices are downright obscene! There are no boards to house DDR2 and DDR3 so you have to choose either.

67a03774b3647b0531fb9965b58ec6d6aa	There are a few reasons that your speeds are slower than you expect.<br>  1) Your ISP may be choking torrent traffic all the time or a certain times of the day which they class as peak times. Try downloading at night when you go to bed and see if this makes a difference. <br>  2) The seeders are limiting their upload speeds<br>  3) If you haven't made exceptions in your firewall you will need to.<br>  4) You may have to manually forward the ports on your router.

If no green light then visit <a href="http://portforward.com" rel="nofollow">http://portforward.com</a> for instructions on how to port forward.<br>  5) General settings and tweaks for μtorrent may improve things, Google 'utorrent tweaks' or 'utorrent guides' for a slection.

I have two lap tops and they stay plugged in 24/7 except for once or twice a month, one is two plus yrs. old the other one 7 yrs.old and I have yet to have to replace a battery. Batteries do fail or go bad just like with a flash light or car battery and no way to tell when.<br>  Hope this helps|`|YnsG3pXraa	There is a lot of debate about this and most of it is 'splitting hairs'  True it is a good practice to every once and awhile unplug your power from your laptop and run on your battery until it quits, then recharge.  Normally your laptop can tell the power source and bypass your battery if it knows it's plugged in.  Some suggest you take the battery out when you know you're going to be using it (laptop) plugged in for an extended (days&days) period.  Also use your power manager to set optimum power control settings.|`|94b08a847f33718a4958a9e47861100daa	That rule applies, as far as I know, to every rechargeable battery in the entire universe. My laptop currently holds a charge for about 10 minutes after being continuously plugged in for like 4 years.|`|c28Fdz8Naa	you can but i have ended up breaking a lot of the cords doing that|`|hLSIRDtZaa	I do.

The battery "rule" applies to old NiCad batteries. Lithium batteries used now do not have memory. If you are still worried about the battery, which you should not, if you have a Lithium one, take it out when the laptop is plugged in.

You would need to install a 64-bit OS.  I would recommend Vista as 64-bit XP has too many issues.|`|bUWe5jT8aa	32 bit operating systems typically recognise around 3.2-3.5GB of RAM. Less if you have large amounts of video ram.
wRytd4dPaa	There is no CHEAP way to upgrade xp to another version of xp (be it 32 or 64 bit). You will need to buy the version that you want a install that one. However if have vista, microsoft will be offering cheaper upgrades to Windows 7 when it comes out. They did the same thing for upgrades from xp to vista.|`|bUWe5jT8aa	You have to buy a new operating system. You cannot just upgrade to x64 in Vista, and I'm not sure if Microsoft is still manufacturing XP. <br>  <br>  If you have wireless internet, I suggest you stay away from x64 operating systems until you're sure you have the proper drivers. <br>  <br>  If you have 4GB of RAM, it is more logical to keep a 32 bit operating system. A 64 bit operating system roughly doubles the amount of core system memory being used, so you typically end up having LESS available RAM than you did before. 64 bit is a must if you plan on going BEYOND 4GB though.

If you are open to non Intel options though why not hit a cheapo Phenom 2 X3 720 Black Edition, a 790GX and slap on a HD 4850X2? With price drops and superior driver support when it 1st came out it is now generally known to give the best frames for the $$!

a0vcfZsaaa	Ya, you can extend the internet connection through another router. All you have to do is you have to run your laptop as server and set all the necessary default gateways. ip address, etc. I have also tried that one once, from wireless broadband to wired network.|`|w09AOQ4Baa	If I understand you correctly,  you don't need to use a second PC and another router to do that.<br>  <br>  All you have to do is get a wireless access point, and set it up to pick up your WiFi signal. <br>  <br>  Personally, I like the linksys WAP54G, and use it as my repeater. <br>  <br>  You can set up the access point so that the network is available through its ethernet port.  Just connect that port to a switch, and then you can hard wire whatever you need in that location.
SJM0rzHtaa	You are talking about non-express PCI, not PCIExpress, right?<br>  <br>  If you are talking about non-express PCI, an AGP card will kick its butt, and hard.<br>  <br>  Non-express PCI transfers data at a molasses-slow 33mHz.  No matter how fast the GPU is or how much memory is on that non-express PCI card, the 33mHz PCI bus just cannot keep the card fed with data fast enough.  That 33mHz bus speed is a terrible bottleneck.<br>  <br>  AGP on the other hand transfers data at 66mHz, with up to 8x data pumping.  That's up to 16 times faster than non-express PCI.<br>  <br>  All the memory in Christendom will not make a molasses-slow non-express PCI card any faster.|`|TYlpguYvaa	AGP is an old socket which isn't sold anymore (you can find a few cards here and there, but it's slow and outdated).

THere is no guarantee that this will work properly but if suse doesn't have stepmania in its repository it is you only choice.<br>  Since you say you don't know much about linux it is very important that you read the documentation for suse.

RyvKws7Laa	Apple is the manufacturing company not the operating system.  Its OS X that you should be comparing to XP.  Apple would be comparable to an IBM Clone PC for a hardware comparison.<br>  <br>  As for the actual question, if the hardware fairly equal, then no.  They aren't going to be vastly different.  Neither OS is a particular resource hog.  As long as you have ample hardware power to run the OS and your applications you'll get respectable performance from your computer.<br>  <br>  I would consider OS X more efficient than Vista.  Vista right now seems to be a solid resource hog and why it won't work well on Netbooks for example (most will use XP or Linux).  But OS X hacked has been put onto Netbooks and performed well.  But Windows 7 seems to be quite efficiency and should do some valuable catching up once it comes out.  But then OS X is about to get another large upgrade too (and the upgrade is apparently all around improving efficiencies).|`|0ed48a5e0bda094ada9c3a81b4586a92aa	From most of what I've read, Mac's are faster!<br>  <br>  I've also read that Mac's run XP faster than PC's! Intel Mac's of course.|`|nQuq0Iw2aa	It depends on what processor you have, but it is typically easier to upgrade your processor on a mac than a PC. However, since you can put XP onto a Mac (you can't put Mac on a PC without risking the integrity of your computer), that negates the answer. What you should worry about more than speed is reliability, ease of use, and security. In all three of these categories, Mac beats XP hands down.

I work mostly in VB.NET and Java because, well, that's my job. VB.NET lacks a few features that C# has which would be nice.

You will see bitrates ranging from 56k (poor) to 320Mbps (the best).<br>  When you're done, select the track(s) you wish to compress, and click on Export as mp3. The exporting will compress and save the result as an mp3 file.<br>  Because mp3 is a proprietary format, you need an additional free program to do the conversion from wav to mp3.

FBQZ06vraa	In binary, you're setting a to 101.  The b=~a flips all the bits in a, setting b to (disregarding lots of high-order bits)   11111010.  Since the highest-order bit, the sign bit, was also flipped to a 1, this is a negative number,  -6 to be exact.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|AA10446546	~ is bitwise negation.<br>  <br>  To understand why it gives -6, you need to understand the concept of "binary number", "bitwise negation", and "two's complement"<br>  <br>  In the memory, the integer 5 is represented as:<br>  <br>  0000 0101<br>  <br>  bitwise negation of that is:<br>  <br>  1111 1010<br>  <br>  which is the binary for 250, or -6 using two's complement system.<br>  <br>  What is two's complement?<br>  <br>  Basically, it's a system of keeping negative numbers using binary. The first (most significant) bit denotes the sign, 0 for positive, and 1 for negative.<br>  <br>  Further reading on two's complement: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_com...</a>|`|xTqZiiZUaa	there is no such thing as a negative number in binary, it is just the left-most bit (X000000 for an 8 bit integer).

IZbHynvbaa	Basic is not a standardized language. IMHO it is out of date anyway. Visual BASIC is a Microsoft product with continued development, afaik. The "Visual" came into the name, when they added a drawing program for the graphical user interface.<br>  <br>  Nowadays there are many more programming languages suited for beginners. For example Python. (You can use e.g. Glade to design the graphical user interface for a python program.)<br>  <br>  With Python you are not restricted to a platform: you can write Programs that run on Windows, Mac-OS, and Linux. (Possibly more)|`|CGJTKFLKaa	I'm pretty sure that BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose symbolic instruction code) is the programming language, and Visual Basic is a compiler for BASIC.|`|eb2b878790abd15dff4def750af794b8aa	the difference is quite clear from the names themselves...<br>  BASIC was a language to develop simple applications<br>  and VISUAL BASIC allow you the developer to build applications rapidly as it gives you IDE (integrated development environment).<br>  <br>  it is the new and the better approach

0m1PMsHaaa	In the first case, why not just connected with a VGA cable?  It is exactly the same.<br>  <br>  DVI has options for analog signals - DVI-A - that are the same signals that are in a VGA cable, or for digital signals - DVI-D.   Most video cards use a connector that has all these signals in a single connector, called DVI-I.<br>  <br>  So the DVI to VGA adapter plugs into a DVI-A or a DVI-I connector and reroutes the signals into a VGA connector.   It does not convert or change the signals in any way.    Plugging a VGA cable in to a VGA to DVI-A adapter and then attaching that to a DVI-D connector will result in a blank screen.<br>  <br>  HDMI is signal channel DVI-D + HDCP encryption.<br>  <br>  So, again a DVI-D to HDMI adapter does not alter the signals in any way.  It just routes them from a DVI connector to a HDMI connector.    Whether this works depends on whether your monitor supports HDCP encryption and whether the source (cable box, etc.) requires it.<br>  <br>  Whichever has the HDMI connector on it will support HDCP.   If a monitor has DVI maybe it will support it, maybe it will not.  Most new monitors do.  Older ones do not.    If the cable box has DVI then it become irrelevant.  If it doss require HDCP then the HDMI on the monitor supports it.  If it does not, then the monitor will still be happy.

AA11159096	Ok, Get the second sony Vaio with 64bit Vista.<br>  32bit software (aka the usual software for 32bit xp and vista) will still run.<br>  The reason is simple. see that 4GB ram? in 32bit os it will show only 3gig and use only 3gig. 64bit OS can use the full 4GB and more importantly use both processor cores more effectively and it will make you feel like the OS is solid and more stable. <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  The only problem is. None of those are great machines. If you are going to buy a good machine at $1500. it has to be more than just "style". its like a girl who dresses well and look good but has no brain.<br>  If you want a good machine you may want to look at these two.<br>  HP HDX16t<br>  HP DV7t<br>  Both are slightly over $1000 and are complete V8 Muscle. And even has a decent graphics card. This would be shelby GT500 compared to sony which would be mazda miata.|`|6yqReVEZaa	without any doubt choose sony vaio.|`|Qbi8WbtCaa	The first one is plenty.

qVrjjkWlaa	There are a few things that can be said. Since Acer bought Gateway, you might be able to call their tech support and oder a restore cd. They used to cost 20.00 from gateway. The chances of you getting the pc to work could be slim. Why? first of all if the computer has a bootleg copy of windows it will never work.  Don't buy one off of the net or from anyone else, as it will show up as a copy that has been installed on a previous pc(hence, bootleg). I am not saying you did it so don't get me wrong. You will only waste your money.  Microsoft has it set up so that if the cd has been used on more than 1 pc, and this is due to the fact you have to put in a product code, It just will not work. Can you get your money back from garage sale ?<br>  I am a previous gateway tech support person, at least untill Acer lied and said we would not loose our jobs!

AA10464818	If you get enough traffic, put the ads well on your site, you may be able to make some money from your site. <br>  <br>  Remember that in terms of earning money on Adsense, your mileage varies. One website with 10,000 uniques a day can earn $50 a month while another may earn $5,000. It is not easy to predict how much you will earn from Adsense. The only way you can learn about how your site will perform with Adsense is through trying it.<br>  <br>  The amount you can earn will depend on the <br>  <br>  1. Responsiveness of audience to the ads = A travel website that provides information on travel to Spain will attract visitors looking for ways to arrange their travel and spend money on their vacation to Spain. Your site provides the info, but the ads will provide hotels, travel agencies, tourist destinations, car rentals -- ads that are likely to get the attention of the users of your site. This is a site that will most likely do well with Adsense.  However, if you are a gaming website where the main purpose of the user is to play games on your site, then Adsense will not perform as well.<br>  <br>  2. Ad format = some types of ads do better than others depending on your content and layout. In our case, large rectangles in the middle of the content is the best, while leaderboards do not generate as much as income. Skys are the worst for us. Experiment and measure the results via channels and see which formats work best for you.<br>  <br>  3. Ad placement - check Google's heat map as they have tested where the best placements are <a href="https://www.google.com/support/adsense/bin/answer.py?answer=17954&ctx=en:search&query=adsense+heat+map&topic=0&type=f" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/support/adsense/b...</a> <br>  <br>  4. Ad colors - sometimes ads blended into the content works wonders, but sometimes ads that contrast your site colors work best<br>  <br>  5. Number of ad units on a page = we are allowed maximum of 3 ads + 1 ad links + 1 search box on a page. Maximize the allowed number based on the resulting look of your page (you don't want an overkill of ads). Users going to your page and reading your content may ignore the banner or rectangle at the top of the page, but may click on the ad at the bottom of the article<br>  <br>  6. Smartpricing - the big unknown in Adsense. No one knows how this actually works. But it can affect the pricing of the ads on your site. If the advertiser paid for $0.50/click - but your site is smartpriced - then the cost may be discounted lower (e.g. $0.25). So you may try to develop a site based on high paying keywords but if smartpricing gets to you, then you may not get as much per click as what you are expecting from your keywords.<br>  <br>  Here is Google's explanation of smart pricing <a href="https://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=9562&query=smart+pricing&topic=0&type=f" rel="nofollow">https://adwords.google.com/support/bin/a...</a><br>  <br>  Google's smart pricing feature automatically adjusts the cost of a keyword-targeted content click based on its effectiveness compared to a search click. So if our data shows that a click from a content page is less likely to turn into actionable business results -- such as online sales, registrations, phone calls, or newsletter signups -- we reduce the price you pay for that click.<br>  <br>  Experiment with the factors above (except smartpricing, which you can't control), and see which combination works best. Remember though that not all sites do well with Adsense - even if you get gazillions of traffic but your visitors are not interested in looking for ways to spend their money, they won't be interested in your ads and won't click.

If you were a virus writer, wouldn't the first thing you do be to test it against all the major antivirus applications to make sure it can get by those? And when you release your virus at 1:35 PM, how would the antivirus definitions have a definition for your virus at 1:35 PM exactly? Or even at 2:00 PM? There's no way.<br>  <br>  Apart from having outdated virus definitions, antivirus applications also try to guess what are viruses based on file attributes, and that just leads to a lot of false positives that get people into a panic over nothing ("I have tracking cookies? Oh no!") while also not getting all viruses either.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, antivirus is a waste of resources and even money if you spent money on it.<br>  <br>  If you want to protect your computer, here's what you should do, in this order:<br>  <br>  1. Back up your personal files.<br>  <br>  2. Reinstall Windows. It's the only way to know the malware is completely gone.<br>  <br>  3. Set up and use almost exclusively a limited user account. Very few viruses target a limited user account, since they want to get their hooks into Windows' system files and registry, but even if they did somehow manage to compromise the limited user account, you could simply delete that account and start a new account instead of having to reinstall Windows to get rid of the infection.<br>  <br>  4. Google the term "social engineering" and read the first five results. Almost all malware infections rely on tricking the user, as opposed to exploiting security holes in the operating system.<br>  <br>  5. Do not download pirated software, music, or movies.<br>  <br>  6. Install Windows updates automatically.<br>  <br>  7. Use Firefox with the NoScript extension installed.<br>  <br>  8. Use strong passwords (no dictionary words, no numbers associated with you).|`|Ev6WQRmzaa	A lot of people think Antivirus software = security<br>  It doesn't, there is no way the definitions are going to be updated fast enough to protect you from new viruses.<br>  <br>  Antivirus software (IMO) is a waste of resources<br>  <br>  Some tips:<br>  -Avoiding going on untrusted sites/clicking random ads and e-mail attachments <br>  -Browse the web on a user account with limited privileges to prevent malware from automatically installing itself <br>  - Install all security updates<br>  -Use Firefox with noscript addon instead of IE<br>  -Thunderbird instead of Windows Mail<br>  -Make sure software is safe before installing it. (Search it on Google)<br>  -Don't install pirated software|`|1NO10YfPaa	Sometimes they can give false positives and flag things that are not really viruses.

Hackers will use this critical security oversight to trick victims into allowing their garbage to be installed, with innocent looking (often mimmicing legit window notices) 'click to view' or 'you must allow Active X to view this content' or 'install the latest Java here' to that end.<br>  <br>  2)  Requesting files from Peer-2-Peer servers<br>       Because they use multiple 'peer contributors' to feed bits & parts of a requested file (music, movies, etc.) back to you, there can never be any kind of certainty about the status of the sender's file.<br>  Whatever they have =  you get: malevolent or not.<br>    <br>  Once downloaded to your machine, all bets are off about it's safety to open, transfer, use or re-send; and size of a file has little bearing on what it may or may not contain; scanned or otherwise.<br>  Use @ your own peril...<br>  <br>  Securing Windows operating systems from Internet assault & increasing predation, is not a single application, or a suite: and it's not a "one step- 10 second fix" that we all would love.<br>  It's layers of protection, user habits, system configuration, real time protection; and most important, threat landscape awareness (because the internet is so fluid and dynamic, it changes almost hourly).<br>  <br>  Look through some of the suggested freeware here, <br>  <a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/Freeware/security/fwsecuritytools.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/Freeware/securi...</a><br>  study up, and pick some of the frontline, real-time defenses.

Take the image in and use the eyedropper(Hit I) to grab the tone.<br>  <br>  Then click the foreground color that was just picked.<br>  <br>  In the window that comes up it will have a series of numbers, in the left column at the top it will have H(Hue), S(Saturation) and B(Brightness). Look at the percentage of brightness next to B and note it. Brightness denotes purely the change from black to white.<br>  <br>  Edit: In the way I just explained white is 100%, while black is 0%. I'm sure other Photoshop clones have a similar ability.  If you do not have Photoshop tho, try www.getpaint.net or GIMP, they are free.

8ZTuFrE9aa	To improve the security of a Wi-Fi network, you should change the administrative password on your wireless access point or router immediately when installing the unit. The default passwords for popular models of wireless network gear are well-known to hackers and often posted on the Internet. Most devices do not allow the administrative user name to be changed, but if yours does, seriously consider changing this name as well.<br>  <br>  Finally, to maintain home network security in the future, continue changing this administrative password regularly, not just one time. Many experts recommend changing passwords every 30 to 90 days. Use words that would be very difficult for others to guess<br>  <br>  then  u  have to  change the Wi-Fi password with  something difficult  to guess  <br>  to  know how to  change the Wi-Fi password go  to  the link|`|AA10501811	you should be able to find out the mac address of his laptop and block that - also if you use WPA2 and on the DHCP section only allow so many wifi devices that will help as well as making your routers ip address different to what it used to be.<br>  <br>  Also set your routers password to a strong password that has numbers, capital ( uppercase ) characters, symbols etc.<br>  <br>  Also if you change the SSID ( which is basically your wireless networks name ) and also make your wireless network name aka SSID hidden so that it does not broadcast the name of your network that way only you know what it is and when you go back to your computer / laptop you can add a new network and enter in the networks name and password.
6GB5P7ojaa	I hope you're using a Windows computer 'cause I don't know how to do this in a Mac. So anyway, here's how you do it with Windows:<br>  <br>  1.Right click on a file that has the Nero Essentials StartSmart icon next to it.<br>  <br>  2.Click properties.<br>  <br>  3.Go to the General tab.<br>  <br>  4.Look at the "Opens with:" and click "Change. . ." near it (on the right side)<br>  <br>  5.A list of programs will pop up. Select the iTunes icon then click "Apply" and then "OK."

6YufKn6Faa	Hi. <br>  <br>  Geforce GTX 250?  Is that even out yet? (It is a rebranded 9800 GTX+ with a higher clock) <br>  <br>  Then you mention GTX 260 in your specs.. <br>  <br>  The Answer to your question is, yes (it seems) your processor is bottlenecking.. which is very damn interesting considering it was just off the market last year. More memory can help you (DDR2 800 is pretty cheap nowadays), and your computer can last another two years, enough for Intel to come out with their 6 core processors, etc. <br>  <br>  But Yes, the score you got was mainly because of the Processor. If you really want, you can see if your motherboard supports AM2+, and get any AM2+ processors that your motherboard supports. But you are fine with that PC for another 2 years. <br>  <br>  Most people with an 8800GT (From what I remember) get a score around the 8000s, and you got high 9000s which is also pretty interesting. <br>  <br>  I also think you should have gotten at least another thousand in the scoring range. <br>  Your processor is old (Reason is that the memory frequency is at 800mhz and the L2 cache is at 512mhz, at least you go tthe black edition for more Overclocking but it seems that is as far as you can push it, at 3.1ghz) (Been old since last year) but again, keep it for another two years, then Switch to Intel's Fast i7's (Prices will fall) or get an Phenom II X4. <br>  <br>  Make sure you have the latest drivers for everything. (including video cards) There also might be a BIOS update for your motherboard which may help your processor perform better. <br>  <br>  Are you running your Games/etc at high settings and higher res? If you are using a monitor that only has.. maybe 1280X1024 or lower res, there isn't going to be much of a gaming difference. (Other than Games, like Crysis, FarCry2 (Not a great game..), or GTA IV for example).<br>  But your PC should be fine<br>  <br>  Hope that Helps|`|AA11294101	This may be cheesy and the most obvious thing.  Almost like "you should always lock your screen when you walk away from your computer at work."  <br>  <br>  Anyway, since I don't know your machine, but I have found that there are dozens of things that slow computers down.  The primary killer of computer performance in computers that have been running for a while is what I call "windows creep".  Meaning a lot of abandoned files and a ton of stuff that is in your system tray.  People have no idea why it takes their comp so long to boot up.   <br>  <br>  You can temporarily test this by going to a run box, type "msconfig" and temporarily disable all the crap that you either don't need all the time or don't want.  You might be shock how much junk is running in the background.  A simple right click on the toolbar on the bottom and run task manager will allow you, in on of the several panes to see if you have maxed out memory, or maxed out cpu, but you can also look at the list of processes and sort by memory usage, cpu usage, and kill individual processes.  <br>  <br>  Bottom line, I'm saying  you may have extra stuff running that is bogging down your system.  remember to run msconfig and turn it back to normal when you are done debugging.  I can't recommend a good program to fix all this, because the one I like everyone hates.  I used to love Norton Systemworks but most people I talk to hate it.  It had a lot of cool features that would help diagnose orphaned files and fix registry errors ... all that stuff.  But there will be a lot of people who answer this question that will tell you that it sucks and you should never use it.  Its a religious war .. basically preference.  A good place to look for reviews is www.cnet.com.  <br>  <br>  *1 - <a href="http://tinyurl.com/d66pnp" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/d66pnp</a>    (URL goest to a CNET review)<br>  <br>  They always rate norton / symantec higher than the users do.  The users are brutal against it.  They have many other manufacturers.  I made the switch to Norton 360 and am still suffering. So the users aren't always wrong.  I've heard goot things about   That software slowed my computer down massively.  If you've got virus scanners running to protect your system from an instant threat, that will consume CPU.<br>  <br>  PriceGrabber is offering software reviews as well.  You can get user reviews on software basically anywhere, even amazon.  I like pricegrabber for their lowest price technology.<br>  <br>  *2 - <a href="http://tinyurl.com/b5cpjq" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/b5cpjq</a>  (URL goes to pricegrabber software reviews)<br>  <br>  Bottom line, you're gonna have to pull the hood open and start looking at your applications and what might be putting glue in your gas tank. <br>  <br>  If you have already done all this, then I apologize.  Like I said, you may know every bit of this already.  Here is one example of how the users hated it, but CNET liked it.  Maybe CNET needs an overhaul.<br>  <br>  This self proclaimed nerd god recommends XP Medic or Registry Patrol.  He apparently likes XP medic better for registry cleaning.  <br>  <br>  *3 - <a href="http://tinyurl.com/dnyp3y" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/dnyp3y</a>   (URL goes to www.asknerd.net)<br>  <br>  Anyway, I am no expert on this topic.  I am a UNIX wonk and prefer any distro of Linux or FreeBSD to Windows anyway.  However, I admit, I have a couple of Vista 64bit machines.  Boy, that  OS is hard to please!<br>  <br>  (UPDATED x 2: The reviewer "JournaL" recommends Tom's Hardware as a good site.  I guess we were typing at the same time with my original post.

sSEy6KYiaa	Sir Tim Berners Lee created the http protocols that are used on the internet at Cern laboratories in Switzerland. He was given a Knighthood for his achievements.<br>  <br>  "While an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980, Berners-Lee proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers.[4] While there, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE. After leaving CERN, in 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems Ltd in Bournemouth but returned to CERN in 1984 as a fellow. In 1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe, and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the Internet: "I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the Transmission Control Protocol and domain name system ideas and — ta-da! — the World Wide Web."[5] He wrote his initial proposal in March 1989, and in 1990, with the help of Robert Cailliau, produced a revision which was accepted by his manager, Mike Sendall. He used similar ideas to those underlying the Enquire system to create the World Wide Web, for which he designed and built the first web browser and editor (WorldWideWeb, running on the NeXTSTEP operating system) and the first Web server, CERN HTTPd (short for HyperText Transfer Protocol daemon).<br>  <br>  The first Web site built was at CERN[6][7][8][9] and was first put online on 6 August 1991. It provided an explanation about what the World Wide Web was, how one could own a browser and how to set up a Web server. It was also the world's first Web directory, since Berners-Lee maintained a list of other Web sites apart from his own."<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners...</a>|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Tim Berners-Lee, working for CERN, so that physicists had a easy way to share technical information.

So if you are just interested in computers, but think that somewhere along the line that may change and you dont wanna be stuck with a computer science degree, you can take engineering or math (or something related).|`|fecUjSr1aa	IT (that's Information Technology, correct?) it would be an excellent major to go through college. if you're good with computers, go for it. but as every college grad would have to encounter, is trying to get the necessary exposure and experience like the other guys are talking about. don't worry, you're not alone in this venture.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|PRE6MIBcaa	In IT experience is far more important than qualification

Now, you should insert a new first row into your DataSet2 with a default "Florida" value. <br>  <br>  Now, (for each of next row in DataSet2), you should read from each row from DataSet and assign it to a new row in your DataSet2 by using a For Loop. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that when you are looping through DataSet, you would skip (bypass) a row of "Florida". In another word, you are already insert a value "Florida" to your DataSet2; therefore you will not insert Florida twice in the DataSet2.<br>  <br>  Hope that would help!

If one of the sticks is lower speed than the other then the computer will only run at the lower speed.<br>  <br>  Most new laptops will accept and fully use different sizes of RAM but not speed. <br>  <br>  I advise to have the same brand and speed of RAM to get the most out of it.|`|a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	No.<br>  <br>  Whoever told you that has no clue what they are talking about.<br>  <br>  Most likely they are regurgitating something they read a long time ago about RDRAM which is not even used in system memory anymore.  That type of ram required the data to travel through all the sticks in the system before it reached the CPU. This increase latency and reduced perceived performance. It is one of the major reasons why RDRAM or RAMBUS was a huge flop.<br>  <br>  Why would they put multiple ram slots on a computer if it caused "stress"?<br>  <br>  For instance, I have 2 x 512 and 2x 1gb installed in my computer right now. That is a total of 4 sticks.|`|ffqsWfZtaa	If you have a dual or quad core processor and your system can support dual porting then you want matching RAM.<br>  <br>  Unless your 1GB stick is slower than the 2 GB then the extra ram will give more performance than the speed mismatc will loose.<br>  <br>  If the 1GB is slower, then you may just be faster taking it out, but its a try it and see situation.<br>  <br>  In no way will the mismatch in size or speed cause stress on the system.|`|7xALh7k1aa	I thought that too at one time, but if you really look at it the RAM actually helps store memory so when it comes time for the computer to fulfill a task, it doesn't have to go very far it can access like a bookmark on the stick of RAM.<br>  <br>  now, if you have a very fast CPU, it's still not recommended that you have no RAM, but if your CPU chip was fast enough, it would perform the tasks at hand and yes, it would benifit, or be faster... but I highly doubt you have that kind of CPU, becuas if you did, you wouldn't be asking a question about RAM, now would you...<br>  <br>  There is no logic in having less, unless your CPU is super fast. like QUAD fast...<br>  <br>  Come to think of it, if there's no RAM in the computer, there's no computer, nor will the computer work, or load, or start...|`|5rP0zBudaa	No. It is far better to have more ram than less.

1wzSq4OJaa	Many of the HP scanners have issues with the Mac OS if you are using Leopard.  I have an All-in_one as well and it did everything but scan when I installed Leopard.  I believe that Apple has since updated the software and so had HP so that you can reinstall the HP drivers.<br>  <br>  You first have to remove the HP folder from your printer drivers folder.  Then go back and d/l the drivers from HP to reinstall.|`|2LbTrlQnaa	Check the HP website.  It seems you have installed a basic printer driver rather than the software package.  The software available on a printer manufacturer's website is often more up to date than the CD anyway|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	Just write to them & ask for another disc.

tOCESHLYaa	You will get more for your money buying a Windows pc. What I mean by that is you can get more Ram a faster processor. That does not mean the Windows pc will be faster. Mac's run good but are different than a windows based pc, so you may have to get use to it. The video and picture software on the Mac is very nice. Mac are easier to set up than a windows pc but neither are hard to set up. The one downfall to the windows pc is security. You really have to spend a little time learning how to protect your computer. Mac can get infected, it happens everyday. But it's harder to get infected with a Mac, in fact it is much harder. On a Mac just remember don't download from untrusted sites and you'll be ok. Don't click and install from a pop up. Your Mac will stay clean. You'll hear users say Mac's can get infected to. There just isn't much malware written that attacks Mac's that why they don't get infected. That may be true but who cares, they still don't get infected and that all that matters. So if getting infected is your biggest worry, get a Mac.|`|DWJOMWQ8aa	Windows.

Get a PC.|`|ZyR8ezBwaa	Mac doesn't get any viruses, but it is really expensive. You won't be able to get one for less than a thousand dollars. With a Mac, you won't be able to install Microsoft products, like Word or Powerpoint. You're going to have to get some other type of Apple program, and they don't have good programs. With a Windows PC, you won't have to worry about any programs not working or something. Also, you can get a PC for an affordable price. Macs will be expensive, and the programs will be even more expensive. A PC is better.|`|v2hqvUpRaa	It all depends on what you need it for. Yes, it's true that its very rare for a mac to get a virus. If you have more money to spend, then I think a mac is definitely worth it!<br>  <br>  PS: You can run windows on a mac, so why bother getting a PC when you can have both in a mac?<br>  <br>  PSS: Mac's version of Microsoft Office suite is pretty much exactly the same, and all the files are fully transferable. It was also cheaper than Microsoft Office when I bought it.|`|5sTPhPGiaa	Mac if you want a hassle-free, safe computer. Windows if you don't mind other people having access to your passwords, photos, etc.<br>  <br>  Most people view infections, pop-ups, etc. as a necessary inconvenience in Windows without realizing that it is actually someone else controlling your computer!<br>  <br>  P.S. Mac viruses are theoretical at this point. There have been a few trojans, but they require your active help to install them.<br>  <br>  P.P.S. For those who say it's one or the other, that's untrue. I have a MacBook Pro with Mac OSX Leopard * AS WELL AS * Windows XP Professional (via Parallels). I can run both concurrently. I never use Windows for anything, though.|`|car4UyLFaa	Whether it's Mac, Dell, or Gateway, you're paying more for branding than the computer is actually worth. The only thing Mac really does better is that it has more intuitive, easier to learn keystrokes. I have had nothing but problems running a powerful music program on my friend's mac - the program (Ableton Live - a reputable program) crashed and had to be reinstalled yet again, whereas my other friend's obsolete PC runs a similar program without any problems.<br>  <br>  If all you need are the basics, internet and word processing, you don't need a very powerful computer, and you can get a nice HP or comparable windows pc for around $500. Windows still has more software support, although more games and internet freeware are now available on mac as well, many mac users still need to basically run a virtual copy of windows within mac to use certain windows programs. This is mostly why viruses are more common on PC than mac, more people use PC, but that doesn't make mac any more protected. Anyone who downloads anything from the internet is at risk of getting a virus, especially if they don't know what they're doing.<br>  <br>  The Linux operating system is way better than both mac and windows, but most people aren't ready to move to that one, feel free to check out linux though.<br>  <br>  P.S. Someone said that on mac, you have to actively install a program to get a trojan. Guess what, that's how trojans work! That's how a lot of viruses work, they just sit there until you install or open the file.<br>  <br>  P.S.S. Microsoft Office is pretty much unnecessary at this point. Unless you need it for powerpoint, Open Office will do the exact same thing for free, and its powerpoint clone comes pretty close.<br>  <br>  P.S.S.S. In a March 2008 hacking contest, the MacBook was hacked in 30 seconds, Windows after the third day, and the contest was over before anyone could obtain the planted credit card number from Linux.|`|YESUhp8gaa	Not really true about the mac not getting viruses, they have gotten viruses before. Although it is rare, but you are more likely to get Trojans that often fool the user into installing them.<br>  <br>  Personally mac is better for day-to-day needs and video/music editing.<br>  <br>  windows is more compatibility with thrid-party programs and often better for entertainment, such as games.|`|EA9WpTacaa	MAC<br>  MAC<br>  MAC<br>  MAC<br>  MAC<br>  okay im sorry but mac is awesomeee!|`|P3Mt18Usaa	Mac for laptops|`|Sd3kXRgGaa	Linux.|`|yCviSNsiaa	It really depends on what you want one for.<br>  <br>  If you like games, go Windows. Macs don't get as many games and sometimes features are not carried over (for instance, Neverwinter Nights lost its toolset for making your own levels when ported to Mac)<br>  <br>  If you are not a game person, Macs are probably better. They have a lot of cool built-in features and are great for work.<br>  <br>  So, if for play, get a Windows, but if for work, get a Mac.<br>  <br>  Mr N.|`|7e43ea21aa9ca2a99528b1fb466cbc37aa	It depends what you want to do with it, or more of what your experience in computers is.<br>  <br>  A mac will usually run for about 4-5 years and break because of a hardware malfunction<br>  <br>  A PC computer will run for 3-4 even 5 with good care, but the length depends on what brand you buy. Sony will run much longer then Acers. Windows has much more of a chance of getting a virus. <br>  <br>  An important fact.<br>  Mac's do get virus's, just very very very rarely, and they are usually pretty destructive one's only. People say that is not true, but go to a Mac store and ask the tech.<br>  <br>  A Mac PC is overall better for someone with little to no computer experience<br>  <br>  If you have a few years of experience in the computer industry, I suggest buying a PC around $500 dollars.|`|dxNhe76uaa	There are a lot of ways that you could look at it. yeah mac doesnt get viruses but windows doesnt either and the chance of any computer getting a virus and then not being able to fix or get rid of it is like 3 out of 10. also there are a lot more public places that you go that have windows computers for a lot of reasons. 1. they are a lot cheaper 2.they  have easier and better acces to the internet. and 3. most of the time there is a better chance of being able to get high speed internet with windws. So basically what i am saying is you should get windows. I hope i helped.|`|cA3PAgetaa	Windows is better ;)<br>  <br>  the reason macs don't get viruses is because a lot less people use them, so the majority of viruses are made to attack windows systems, but if you have antivirus, and aren't stupid about downloading stuff, then you don't have to worry about viruses anyhow|`|KbbL1Wemaa	Macbook, hands down.  I've had a mac my entire life and have never had a virus.  It's quick, efficient, and easy once you get the hang of it.

Start up your pc and make sure the OS CD is in, just treat it like you would install an OS on a normal HD.

be55f04b8c79c46e08a6dcc1d71b8bd5aa	Considering that your Mac is Intel-based, I suggest that you just hold off a few months until OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard arrives. Apple's been devoting all their effort to overhauling OS X's guts to make the OS faster, lighter, cleaner and more future-proof, instead of adding more and more user-facing features like they have with every release up until now. Buying Leopard (10.5) now would be a waste of upgrade money because it has relatively little time left before it's replaced, having been originally released back in 2007.|`|K7kPSgs4aa	defiantly|`|55c1d74ea3f28f36e0572a05769f11d3aa	I used to do video editing on a 386 computer, with 128 meg of ram and 10 gig hard drive. with no problems. <br>  <br>  I don't know if you know this or not, but you can run Linux on your Mac like you can run OS/x on a normal intel pc. all this bull about how good the Mac is, It's a load of brainwashing, <br>  <br>  Linux is a far superior operating system, Mac and Microsoft can only dream about the things that Linux can do.<br>  <br>  With Linux you get everything free Operating system, and application software including Video and Audio editing software, Movie studios like Disney Hollywood studios don't use Mac, Microsoft, or Adobe for their movie production they use Linux.<br>  <br>  so do yourself a favor don't wast money on proprietary operating systems and software when you can have better for FREE..<br>  <br>  another place to check out what I am telling you is youtube, go there and in the search bar type in<br>  linux on a mac<br>  os/x on a dell.<br>  linux vs os/x<br>  sabayon<br>  ubuntu<br>  and you will see just what linux is all about<br>  Mac systems are not all they are made out to be|`|AA11705909	You could do if you wanted to, I don't see why not.

Do you hear a beep?<br>  <br>  Does this happen while or after Windows is loading?<br>  <br>  If theres no beep and nothing at all on the screen when you turn it on check that the fan on the back of the power supply is running, if not, try flipping the switch on the back (NOT The Voltage Switch 120-240V), it might have been turned off.<br>  <br>  If you do hear a beep, and fans are running, lights ect... but nothing on screen, check that the Monitor cable is plugged in all the way on the back of the computer, and that the monitor's power cable is attached all the way on the back of the monitor, or plugged in to the wall/strip all the way.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

SJM0rzHtaa	If your computer has either a DVI or HDMI output, you can connect that to the HDTV's HDMI port.  For DVI, use a DVI-to-HDMI cable.  For HDMI, use a standard HDMI cable.  This is a digital connection and is the best way.<br>  <br>  If your computer only has a VGA port, then hopefully your HDTV will have a VGA port too.  If it does, use a standard VGA monitor cable.  Not as good as DVI/HDMI because VGA is analog, but it's the next best option.<br>  <br>  Once you have the TV connected to your computer with one of the above means, it should be detected by your computer as a monitor.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|HYedOEbnaa	you should just be able to plug your monitor cable into the back of the tv.

ySKsOfIMaa	The best thing to use to clean your laptop screen is just a damp paper towel or soft cloth (like a tshirt). Wet it down a bit, and wipe the screen off. The reason I say water and not something like Windex is because sometimes Windex and other cleaning products can contain ammonia, alcohol, oils, or other chemicals that could destroy your screen.<br>  <br>  If you wanted, you could still use SOME household products. Take some isopropyl alcohol (should be readily available at any drug store, just make sure it's not rubbing alcohol) and mix it with at least as much purified/deionized water (bottled water works fine), preferably more water than alcohol. 2 parts water to 1 part alcohol should be fine, but don't go higher than 50-50. Put the solution in a spray bottle, and spray a soft cloth (not the screen itself!). Wipe the cloth over the screen, taking care to use even pressure (but at the same time, try not to press your fingers into the cloth or screen).<br>  <br>  There are also commercial cleaners designed for the purpose of cleaning laptop screens and LCDs. Water tends to work well enough though, and as a bonus it's free.

These files tell the computer or laptop how to operate the software installed on the system. If any of these files get messed up, the computer is not sure what to do and this will really slow down the computer. The other scenario is where you download other software, screensavers, pictures, videos, or even music, and this will somehow change the settings on a registry file. When this happens, the original program that needs that file now has the wrong instructions in it. So, it will cause the computer to run slow, or in a worse case, crash.<br>  <br>  You can speed up your computer with a thorough analysis and repair of your registry.

(The heatsink)<br>  3) Close and enjoy.<br>  <br>  You might try getting a better insulation system for your computer or getting a new one. Overheating isn't a major threat so it'll be all good. :D|`|lAIWFB8faa	Check for viruses. Check your power management.|`|38ccd2e4feadc84ad07166662a2e5338aa	That's usually a sign of overheating. Try opening up your computer and blowing out the dust with some compressed air. Specifically, the heatsink (this large fan coming out the of the motherboard which radiates the heat from the processor) can get clogged up with dust pretty easily, which can cause slowness, the beeping (which is an alarm from your bios indicating that the temperature is too high) and the shut down (a measure for preventing your cpu from being damaged).
gfmTgLDKaa	Get the duo.<br>  <br>  Most games have not yet adapted the usage of quad cores, and it is not necessary unless you are planning to play 4 games at once. Therefore, the better one to use is the duo core, it'll be cheaper and would run faster for games. You can buy the quad if you want to run many programs at once and not have a problem.<br>  <br>  :D|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Use the Duo.<br>  <br>  The total processing power of the Quad is greater (4x 2.33 GHz = 9.32 GHz), but the processing power of an individual core is greater for the Duo (3.0 GHz as opposed to 2.33 GHz).  In order to profit from the total processing power of the Quad, you'd need games that can use three cores at once, minimum, and most games don't run that many threads at one time. In fact, many games run just one thread. If the number of threads in the game is less than three (and usually it is), then the individually faster cores of the Duo will give you better performance than the slower but more numerous cores of the Quad.<br>  <br>  A Quad can be useful if you are running multiple applications at once, because each can have its own core (up to four applications or threads). In this case, you get more horsepower overall.  But if you are running just one or two applications on the computer at one time, such as just one game, the Duo will provide better bang for the buck, because of the higher clock speed (and thus better performance) of each core.|`|QUQY3HQYaa	Well i would personaly go for the E8400. Most games aren't yet optimized for four cores yet and the 3ghz 2 cores will proform better. The other thing is that by the time that games are optimized for 4 cores it will be time for an upgrade|`|38ccd2e4feadc84ad07166662a2e5338aa	The dual core would probably be better for gaming, because most games are not heavily threaded and would not benefit from the extra cores. On the other hand, the quad core would be great for multitasking and for other computational tasks. If you buy a decent cooling system and case, you should be able to overclock the Q8200 higher to achieve better performance.|`|3QpMwKyiaa	The quad core would be great for gaming :D

By deinstalling stuff you don't need, you can reduce the number of processes (and possibly gain some performance, although that's not a guarantee).<br>  <br>  On a clean install of Windows XP alone, I typically see around 31 processes running, depending on the exact configuration.  On some pre-installed brand-name machines, I might see 70 processes running, meaning that about 29 of them are junk.<br>  <br>  If your machine is infected with malware or spyware, or contains lots of things that linger, such as instant-messaging clients, that can crank up the number of processes as well.|`|zxyevbRgaa	The processes sit in memory most of the time they are idle.Until they are needed.The number of processes won't affect your system performance.

Make your decision based on screen size and operating system (Linux or Windows XP).|`|JTZ8rlVUaa	I'd suggest the Acer Aspire One. My dad got one for work (XP home, 120GB HDD, 1GB RAM), and when I've used it I've had no problems with it. Just make sure if you get it that you get the 6 cell/6 hour battery. One complaint I have is the placement of the mouse buttons (on the sides of the touch pad). It's not really a complaint, just that I'm not used to it.|`|eTDQDcqLaa	Notebook Buying Tips<br>  <br>  Why notebook became so popular? It has been estimated that notebook sales has increased an average of 20% per year in the United States alone. Among the many advantages it offers, portability is one of the main reason people end up making a purchase of it. However before any purchase is made, other features should be considered as well.<br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  Notebook was first made available in the early eighties. Although much heavier and bulkier than today's notebooks, it had the unique portability feature that put this innovative product in a class by itself. Although not much of a commercial success then, it gave the computer industry a goal to pursue in manufacturing this item with better weight, size and performance ratio and making one of today's most wanted computer hardware.<br>  <br>  Notebook size has got much smaller, however big enough to make one feel very comfortable in handling and operating computer related tasks. One can find it in sizes best categorized as: 1 - Tablet Pc has the size of paper tablet and weighs no more than 4 pounds; 2 - Ultra Portable is a little bigger than Tablet Pc and weighs around 4 pounds, no internal CD or DVD drive, display of 12 inches or smaller; 3 - Thin and Light is a mid-size notebook, 10-14" x 10", 1 to 1.5 thick, and weighs around 7 pounds, wireless network capability, 14-inch displays, combo CD-RW/DVD; 4 - Desktop replacement is the largest category of notebooks, more than 12 x 10" and weighs more than 7 pounds, 15-17 inches displays or larger, wireless network capability, combo CD-RW/DV.<br>  <br>   <br>   More:<a href="http://www.seekinusa.com/computers/notebook_buying_tips.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.seekinusa.com/computers/noteb...</a>|`|W7urpHioaa	Trust me on this one... go with the ASUS Eee PC 1000HE (make sure you get the "HE" model).<br>  <br>  Best features:<br>  <br>  - Inexpensive<br>  - Well made<br>  - Great chicklet style keyboard<br>  - Quick boot<br>  - Nice styling<br>  - 10 inch display<br>  <br>  And best of all.... it's battery lasts WAAAYYYY longer than any other netbook battery.

The main ATX power connector for the motherboard needs to match the socket on the motherboard (usually it will, but if the PSU is expensive and the motherboard cheap, or vice versa, be sure to check).  Bigger power supplies often have extra connectors for things like fancy video cards, and some video cards require these connectors or they won't work properly, so beware.|`|QUQY3HQYaa	Yep they will come with a power cord|`|8b60Ntacaa	hey there chris, yeah all psu come with a power supply adapter, although this is NOT a good psu too buy, it may be cheap but it will supply dodgy power too your components, not last very long and not made from quality parts, pc power and cooling,corsair, antec etc make good psu, cheap psu are not worth buying, get one for about 70 pounds, also 650w is unnesasery, i have a gtx 295 and a q9550 and run with a corsair 650w, if you have not that much of a high end system then just get around 400w|`|b301fdd2f7f0f686b01337263980d14baa	Yes, they all do.<br>  <br>  regards,<br>  Philip T

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!|`|I84cekfHaa	Ignore the threats from the alerts as they are fakes and trying to make you to purchase the rogue software.  You need to download Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware for this job.  You can see that it has the definition to remove this rogue software.  It will remove the rogue and the icon from your computer.  It would be ideal to keep Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware on your desktop for further uses.<br>  <br>  Go to 'Download free trial version' to get the program.  Close the running programs first and then install the program.  Make sure that both ticks are present for 'Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware' and  'Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware' and then run in quick scan.

You should not have to turn this on from devise manager. If the lap top is not WiFi certified you can add WiFi by buying a USB or card WiFi adapter and it will come with the software Cd for installing the program to set up your connection, they are not expensive I use a AirLink101 on an older lap top and works great. My newer lap top has WiFi built in. <br>  You will also need to install a router for the wireless WiFi if you do not have this already.<br>  After a quick research of your lap top you connect the WiFi wireless by: F11 lets you cycle through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enable and disable options.

gyv0fMQZaa	Hey Grisham. Your processor could easily last 2 months or 2 years, depending on how much stress it goes through during its lifetime. If you are going to be going online and playing low-detail games like WoW, then your processor can last several more years; however, if you decide to download and play a game such as EverQuest 2 you will find that your processor will break down very quickly due to the stress levels you will be putting it through.<br>  If you don't wish to worry about your processor, but wish to have it last a few more years here is a solution: If you are using Windows Vista, you can go into the power settings and select the maximum processor load that the computer will use. Setting this to 80% will allow your processor to last longer than usual because it keeps the computer from overloading your processor with instructions.|`|GbK3bldGaa	It depends. <br>  Is it working fine at the moment?<br>  As long as you dont try running vista/crysis on it it should be fine. <br>  <br>  Most new software won't run great on it but it should be fine for another few years.|`|07a3a81cd7674cf375916a05deb556f2aa	Processor is good for next few years, but its only based on processor (not videocard or ram)|`|o1r3A3Fiaa	It all depends on your real needs and wants. Can you play what you want? Can you play what media you want? Can you do what you want(browse internet, write letters, use the programs you need for work/leisure time)? You are a judge. <br>  <br>  Note: by today games' standards it is not much. By today Vista/7  standards and HD Video, so so.

aenuw3dnaa	If you mean format your HDD then yea, if you're talking about factory restore then no, heres why-<br>  <br>  Formating your HDD gives you back any unallocated space, and is also a good idea if you know you're infected with spyware, malware or any kind of virus big or small. <br>  If you reformat you need a copy of windows vista, xp, or whatever operating system you use. Backup all importiant data to an external HDD or a bunch of DVDS.<br>  <br>  factory restore is not a good idea  becuase it takes alot of time and does not really do anything but delete all your data. <br>  good luck.|`|x7OeeOKkaa	Hardly 'good'.  You only restore to factory settings if you absolutely have to, and have tried everything else.  All you data would be erased, so you'd need a complete back-up of everything which you wanted to restore were you to go down that route.|`|dJyR1p2faa	Make sure you have copies of all your old files first. I have restored back to factory setttings, usually used only if you are experiencing problems.|`|XPjNJ6gkaa	no becuse it wil clear all ur private data and u will end up re installing evrything again|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	Make sure you store everything on discs first BEFORE you Restore. Alternatively, if things like music, films & emails can be stored on a website, then you can safely Restore without losing any data. But only Restore if there's no other way to get to what you need to, or your PC has problems.|`|8YVo2Wogaa	First you must backup all the important data on your PC; music, videos, letters etc. Also Export your Favorites if want them.<br>  <br>  Then you need to make sure you have all the program CDs you need to reinstall all your bought programs. (You can download again any that you downloaded before.)<br>  <br>  Then you need several hours to install and sort everything out.<br>  <br>  At the end of it all your PC will go as fast as when you first got it!

zorYTX59aa	It's not that easy becoming a YouTube "partner". Almost all of them are either<br>  a film / video creator or producer, an artist (musician, singer, comedian, actor),<br>  a media company, an advertiser, a broadcaster, a person of great significance <br>  (like President Barack Obama) or somebody with a special project or mission <br>  (like Shawn Ahmed and his Uncultured Project for the children of Bangladesh).<br>  <a href="http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject</a><br>  <br>  But that is not enough to become a "partner". YouTube has even more criteria:<br>  -- You create your own original videos (meaning videos nobody else has done)<br>  -- The content is 100% yours (there aren't any elements that belong to others)<br>  -- You own all of the implied copyrights<br>  -- Your videos are viewed by thousands<br>  -- You upload videos on a regular basis<br>  -- The videos are suitable for all viewers<br>  -- You are a resident in one of the 19 countries where YouTube has local sites<br>  -- You can prove you are 18+ years old.<br>  <br>  Generally, YouTube will not consider you unless you've got some combination <br>  of "subscribers" and "videos" that when multiplied together can easily surpass<br>  10,000 channel views. Thus, you would need, for example, something like 800 <br>  subscribers and 20 videos or maybe 500 subs and 30 vids -- as well as a total <br>  view count close to the 1,000,000 mark.<br>  <br>  1. Using or stealing other people's copyrighted material is a no-no.<br>  Absolutely get rid of those videos and anything else that even has <br>  a hint of somebody else's material. The most important criteria for<br>  YouTube is "originality" and "uniqueness", which means "content"<br>  and "style" which nobody else does. Your videos seem to be just <br>  home movies that anybody can do.<br>  <br>  2. Even your oldest videos which date several months, aren't even<br>  close to 1000 views, nevermind thousands.<br>  <br>  3. You've got the number of subscribers, you've got the number of <br>  videos, and you've got the number of channel views. Those figures<br>  are more than enough. But have you got the "originality"?|`|JfJnCfiFaa	Youtube's Partner policy is that you have to own all content in your videos.<br>  <br>  That's really the only rule. After that, it's up to Youtube to decide if your amount of views are sufficient. Applying for partnership can't hurt, so go right ahead. Good luck!<br>  <br>  --Chris (Hey, we have the same name :D)

If the school tech will do it for less then $10 bucks then go for it, if not just stick the CD in, restart the computer and it should start the process.<br>  <br>  When you start the computer it might ask you if you want to boot from disk or press any key to boot CD<br>  <br>  Say yes or press any key|`|R3UVYaHtaa	formatting your pc needs some experience, so i do prefer to send it a specialist... good luck.|`|xdlsGvldaa	The recovery CD set has all that is needed to install the original operating system including all driver for your lap top if you ordered it for your lap top by model and serial number. Just put the CD one in the CD/DVD tray and follow the install procedures and instructions.<br>  Hope this helps|`|oAa3eBITaa	If you are restoring the system to factory condition, you should be able to do it yourself in just a few clicks.  It will restore the computer to the condition it was in when purchased.  All of the programs and data will be erased and Windows will be installed.  I have done this with my Acer desktop and it was very easy.
Z0lEv4Dzaa	No its not. The R in CD-R only means that its is only recordable, meaning that you can only write to it once and you cannot remove any files to its memory, once stored or written. Some programs allows formatting to some CD-r's but results to the lost of data if you have written some before formatting it. But you can add more files to it.<br>  <br>  I agree to the other answerer. You can rip files from it. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ULw1777caa	No.  But you can add more to a CD RW.|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	You can rip files from a CD to your hard drive, but adding additional recording is impossible since the disc is finalized. You would have to rip all the files to your hard drive and burn a new disc with the additional files added. That's what I do when I copy a music disc. I sometimes add songs to fill up the 80 minutes.
hPdEZ4Ypaa	See if you can use a lower bit rate. For instance, you can put more MP3 files on your player at 128 mbs than if they are 160 or 256. That's precisely how some cheap DVD's have 6 or 7 hours of time on them.

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.
