It sounds like you would be a great asset for the incoming freshmen, but you are already outstanding as you are, and wouldn't benefit much more than getting to know new people.  I could be way off key here, but it almost sounds like a complement in your case.|`|hYZIYla0aa	Everything does happen for a reason my dear,not that it seems fair but that is the way God Intended it.You need to know that unanswered prayers are sometimes the best gifts.better things will come along.As long as you are doing things right in your life,good things will come your way!

The selection criteria may be set to select people who represent a cross section of the student population and I'm sure there are shy juniors coming in.

Trust me there will be other disappointments but there will be more opportunities as well.|`|yPsbcrkkaa	Life does not always hand out the thing you deserve when you most deserve it! Sometimes there is a long wait from the moment you do something great and the moment the return flow comes back on that. The important thing to keep in mind is that it DOES flow back. If you can really BELIEVE in and TRUST that it does, then you will be able to get through the long wait. <br>  Just keep putting out good things so that eventually there is so much good coming back your way that you will daily collect something good! <br>  There is always a temptation to look back at yourself and say "I have failed." Resist the temptation, be humble but strong and you will prosper and get everything you most know you deserve.<br>  welcome to message me.|`|p4l5sPlUaa	Stop trying to figure out why things happen!

You sound like you are very sociable and out-going, and mean well.  Not everyone is like that, some people are more withdrawn and shy.  Perhaps the selectors wanted a variety of personalities to do the job because some of the juniors will be confident and outgoing, while others will be shy and quiet.  <br>  Just because you don't get to wear the blazer doesn't mean you can't still help out the juniors, be friendly and if someone looks a bit lost offer then help.|`|OEhH9hcvaa	yes is God will !!!<br>  <br>  and it doesn't matter if you believe in God or not <br>  because still God will...!!!<br>  <br>  PS is normal you are upset because nobody like to lose<br>  especially when the winner is less qualified and there is not the option take or leave you just need to take in the way it is|`|fCvbIrzgaa	I do believe most things happen for a reason, though it might not  be obvious what those reasons are.<br>  About why you didn't get selected... there can be many reasons. One of the things you should remember, is that people are different from one another, so when you ask how someone shy can help anyone to settle in... I know I wouldn't feel comfortable around someone really outgoing and such, because I'm not, and we wouldn't have that much in common (I might even find it intimidating to talk to them). So for tasks like this, you need different kind of people.<br>  It can also be possible that you don't know these people very well, and that they are different than you think. (:<br>  <br>  It seems like there were many people who applied for this "job" or whatever I'm supposed to call it and when there's only 15 who gets a blazer, the chances are that you won't get picked, even if you are a lovely person. You should try not taking it so personal, because even if you didn't get it, it doesn't mean your not a nice person. It just means you didn't get the job this time.

It does not feel good when other don't see your potential, just remember, it doesn't matter what others think of you, it matters what you think of yourself and judging by your question you should be very proud of the accomplishments you have already achieved.

For a task like this, you need several different personalities to accommodate other people's personalities.  <br>  <br>  You should ask the people who made the decision why you weren't selected.  Be prepared to accept criticism and understand their critique is how people perceive you ... how you think you are and how you are perceived are two different things.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|AA10478980	There are many sensible things you can do that will make a tremendous difference over the long term if you need to lose weight. It can be done in a healthy way. This is what has worked for me.<br>  <br>  Keeping a food journal really does help. It will give you a much better sense of how much you are eating, and when, and why.<br>  <br>  Make a few additional small changes - walk everywhere, always use stairs instead of elevators, walk on escalators, get up and move around at least once an hour if your work or your life in general is sedentary, walk every day, use a pedometer. Walking 10,000 steps a day is a really good idea. Build up to a long brisk walk everyday, or most days. Be more active and watch less TV and spend less time on the computer. Buy one piece of exercise equipment to have at home and be strict with yourself about using it. Sometimes you can find mini-steppers or exercise bikes at second hand stores and thrift stores for just a few dollars.<br>  <br>  Start a weight lifting routine.  Join a gym. Possibly you can find one that has someone who specializes in weight lifting programs for beginners. Weight lifting will increase your metabolism as well as improve posture and appearance overall. Even if you can't get to the gym you can work out at home using things around the house.  Invest in a good weight training book.  The Dummies series actually has a good one.   <br>  <br>  In terms of diet, cut out or reduce things like junk food, pop, fat, fast food. Eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meat, fish. Particularly if you choose a vegetarian lifestyle include natural peanut butter, hummus, dried fruit and nuts. Pay close attention to getting the nutrients your body needs to be healthy. <br>  <br>  Make your portion sizes smaller. Use a smaller plate - in our society we have become accustomed to thinking that we need a large plate of food at every meal, and we don't. About quarter of your plate of food should be protein and at least half of it should be veggies. <br>  <br>  Learn to count calories. At your current weight and activity level, you may possibly need about 2000 calories or more to maintain your current weight. So you will lose weight at a reasonable and healthy rate if you cut back to about 1600 or 1700 calories a day. <br>  <br>  Eat small amounts frequently, rather than three large meals. Never skip breakfast. Include some protein in your breakfast. It will help get you through the day.<br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water, at least 8 big glasses of water a day, and more if it is very hot, if you sweat a lot, or if you are exercising intensely, and eliminate fruit juices. Fruit juices have too many calories, so get your vitamins from fresh fruit, not the juice. You will begin to see changes in your body. <br>  <br>  Check out websites about nutrition, exercise, weight training, etc. Here are a few helpful links.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nutrawatch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nutrawatch.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.caloriesperhour.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.caloriesperhour.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.helpguide.org/life/healthy_eating_diet.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.helpguide.org/life/healthy_ea...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Lose-Weight-the-Healthy-Way" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Lose-Weight-the-H...</a><br>  <a href="http://weightloss.about.com/cs/fitness/a/aa011503a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://weightloss.about.com/cs/fitness/a...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/no-weight-workout?page=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/fe...</a>|`|SteCkEuxaa	Dont go over board on dieting.  <br>  -Small healthy snacks all day are really good because it keeps your metabolism up.<br>  -Dont eat past 7pm<br>  -You can eat what you want but everything in moderation and if you think you shouldnt be eating it, dont!<br>  -Dont not eat and think you will lose weight, you will gain it all back in fat when you eventually do eat because your body is freaked out.<br>  -Chew gum, the phenylalanine in it is an appetite suppressor<br>  -Drink cold water, your body actaully burns calories heating itself back up!<br>  -Be careful and keep an eye on yourself.

AsDMUcciaa	In both cases you start supine on the floor, feet on the floor, knees bent to about 90*, hands behind your head/touching shoulders/w/e.<br>  <br>  In a crunch, you only go up enough to get your shoulder blades off the ground; your lower back should still be nearly touching the ground. Hold, then let yourself down. This is a very good exercise for your rectus abdominis ('abs').<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/RectusAbdominis/WtCrunch.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Rect...</a><br>  <br>  In a situp, you essentially sit all the way up, until your elbows can touch, or nearly touch, your knees.

PMyo0QuSaa	Malaria is a disease caused by a protozoan, which is a parasite. Parasites live off other organisms, called hosts. In the case of malaria, humans are the hosts. Malaria parasites can be sucked up from a human bloodstream by mosquitoes. Once inside the mosquito, they move from the gut to the salivary glands. When the mosquito bites into a person, the malaria parasites are passed into their bloodstream. Then they head straight into the liver, where they reproduce meaning that the new generation of malaria then goes into the blood and replicates in the red blood cells causing them to burst. This damage leads to characteristics malaria fever and can sometimes lead to death. <br>  <br>  People with Sickle Cell Anaemia have Sickle haemoglobin (HbS). When sickle haemoglobin gives up its oxygen to the tissues, it sticks together to form long rods inside the red blood cells making these cells rigid and sickle-shaped. Normal red blood cells can bend and flex easily.<br>  Because of their shape, sickled red blood cells can't squeeze through small blood vessels as easily as the almost donut-shaped normal cells. This can lead to these small blood vessels getting blocked which then stops the oxygen from getting through to where it is needed. This in turn can lead to severe pain and damage to organs.|`|X6rFPI2laa	Malaria is an infectious disease.  Sickle cell is genetic.  If there is a connection I certainly don't see one.  Have you contacted a physician?|`|7QtY1cSmaa	Sickle cell anaemia is a genetic condition that affects red blood cells.<br>  <br>  Malaria is a parasitic condition, spread in the saliva of mosquitoes, in which the parasite enters the blood stream and multiplies within red blood cells.<br>  <br>  People with sickle cell anaemia, which is more common in people of African descent, have a degree of protection against infection by the malarial parasite because of the abnormal red blood cells.<br>  <br>  Edit: sorry, Patrick and Jonathan L are correct, it is not necessary to have the disease to gain immunity, the trait is sufficient.|`|mOXEAC3Eaa	Sickle Cell is a genetic condition. More common is Sickle Cell trait which is where someone has half of the recessive genes, so they will not get the full disease, but they can pass on the disease to their children if they have children with someone who also has the Sickle cell gene.<br>  <br>  Anyone who has either the trait or the full-blown condition (which causes Sickle cell anaemia) will be immune to the Malaria parasite. This is because the parasite cannot be carried by their blood cells, so can not cause damage or infect that individual.<br>  <br>  The more technical details you will have to look up, but that is the basis of it.|`|1305765249b53f290c467decdedb9e3aaa	if you have (I think) heterozygous genes for sickle cell anemia then you can live comfortably in a malaria environment. because the malaria needs the blood cells to be more 'normal' for their life cycle so basically it has some immunological advantages.|`|yTYLayLtaa	there should  not be one
3QIWdvG1aa	There's no cure for the common cold. Antibiotics are of no use against cold viruses. Over-the-counter cold preparations won't cure a common cold or make it go away any sooner, and most have side effects. Here's a look at the pros and cons of some common cold remedies.<br>  <br>      * Pain relievers. For fever, sore throat and headache, many people turn to acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or other mild pain relievers. Keep in mind that acetaminophen can cause liver damage, especially if taken frequently or in larger than recommended doses. Be especially careful when giving acetaminophen to children because the dosing guidelines can be confusing. For instance, the infant-drop formulation is much more concentrated than the syrup commonly used in older children. Never give aspirin to children. It has been associated with Reye's syndrome — a rare but potentially fatal illness.<br>      * Decongestant nasal sprays. Adults shouldn't use decongestant drops or sprays for more than a few days because prolonged use can cause chronic inflammation of mucous membranes. And children shouldn't use decongestant drops or sprays at all. There's little evidence that they work in young children, and they may cause side effects.<br>      * Cough syrups. In winter, nonprescription cough syrups practically fly off the drugstore shelves. But the American College of Chest Physicians strongly discourages the use of these medications because they're not effective at treating the underlying cause of cough due to colds. Some contain ingredients that may alleviate coughing, but the amounts are too small to do much good and may actually be harmful for children. In fact, the college recommends against using OTC cough syrups or cold medicines for anyone younger than age 14. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strongly recommends against giving OTC cough and cold medicines to children younger than age 2. Meantime, under an agreement announced by manufacturers in late 2008, several brands of OTC cold and cough medications began carrying a warning that these products should not be used in children under 4. For young children, an accidental overdose could be fatal. Coughs associated with a cold usually last less than two to three weeks. If a cough lingers longer than that, see your doctor.<br>  <br>  Lifestyle and home remedies<br>  <br>  You may not be able to cure your common cold, but you can make yourself as comfortable as possible. These tips may help:<br>  <br>      * Drink lots of fluids. Water, juice, tea and warm soup are all good choices. They help replace fluids lost during mucus production or fever. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, which can cause dehydration, and cigarette smoke, which can aggravate your symptoms.<br>      * Try chicken soup. Generations of parents have spooned chicken soup into their sick children. Now scientists have put chicken soup to the test, discovering that it does seem to help relieve cold and flu symptoms in two ways. First, it acts as an anti-inflammatory by inhibiting the movement of neutrophils — immune system cells that help the body's response to inflammation. Second, it temporarily speeds up the movement of mucus through the nose, helping relieve congestion and limiting the time viruses are in contact with the nasal lining.<br>      * Get some rest. If possible, stay home from work if you have a fever or a bad cough, or are drowsy from medications. This will give you a chance to rest as well as reduce the chances that you'll infect others. Wear a mask when you have a cold if you live or work with someone with a chronic disease or compromised immune system.<br>      * Adjust your room's temperature and humidity. Keep your room warm, but not overheated. If the air is dry, a cool-mist humidifier or vaporizer can moisten the air and help ease congestion and coughing. Be sure to keep the humidifier clean to prevent the growth of bacteria and molds.<br>      * Soothe your throat. Gargling with warm salt water several times a day or drinking warm lemon water with honey may help soothe a sore throat and relieve a cough.<br>      * Use saline nasal drops. To help relieve nasal congestion, try saline nasal drops. You can buy these drops over-the-counter, and they're effective, safe and nonirritating, even for children. To use in babies, put several drops into one nostril, then immediately bulb suction that nostril. Repeat the process in the opposite nostril. Doing this before feeding your baby can improve your child's ability to nurse or take a bottle, and before bedtime it may improve sleep.<br>  <br>  Alternative medicine<br>  <br>  Alternative therapies probably won't cure your cold, but they may help make you more comfortable by easing your symptoms.<br>  <br>  Echinacea. Whether taking preparations of the herb echinacea protects you from getting a cold or relieves cold symptoms continues to be debated. While no studies have shown that taking echinacea can prevent you from getting a cold, there is some evidence that it can modestly relieve cold symptoms or shorten the duration of a cold.

AA10047212	yes, viral loads above 2000 are worrisome.  The higher the viral load, the more likely you are to get liver cancer, for example.  Also, viral load can correlate with liver damage.  This is in contrast to hepatitis C where it does not correlate.  This person needs evaluation by a hepatologist (liver specialist).  I would start by looking at <a href="http://www.hepb.org/resources/liver_specialist_directory.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hepb.org/resources/liver_spec...</a>
xnZi0i8saa	Go see a therapist. They would be the most likely to help you figure out what is going on and how to treat it. It may be nothing more than a reaction to stress but who knows..... go see a psychologist.|`|YJZ8W4QBaa	if you feel paranoid in a way in which it is effecting your jobs and relationships you do need professional help,<br>  smoking cannabis can cause paranoia but you would want to be smoking it a long time for this to happen..
XzV4bUeFaa	He probably has a bad infection in the intestines.  This will cause the obnoxious odor.  The infection can be either viral or bacterial.  It is hard to tell.  Doctor would have to have stool sample sent to lab to see if there is any bacterial cause.  Give him clear fluids to drink as he needs to stay hydrated.  Let him rest and then call the doctor for further instructions.

PROBLEM SOLVED|`|zQB0kEmcaa	You are young and your body needs food everyday.  As long as you stay withing the calories recommended for your age and height you should not get fat.  Please worry about something else ..... food is what keeps us alive ...... there are other things to worry about.  This obsession should not be taking up your time ... concentrate on school and doing well there.  Eat food .... you will look healthier, feel better and have a more positive attitude.  Depriving yourself of this basic necessity will only cause you harm and heartache.  Find out what calories you should be intaking every day and work out some kind of routine that does not include throwing up or overeating or undereating .... please !!!|`|RXI8ImdIaa	You do have an eating disorder.<br>  <br>  Your current weight is dangerously low.

Especially not THAT skinny!!!! don't feel guilty. food=life. if you wanna live, eat something! whoever is telling you to lose weight is an idiot.***|`|afX9FlaEaa	yes...thats dumb skinny skinny girls are not attractive to guys...and this will mess up the way you develop...99 lbs is very gross...please stop your only hurting yourself|`|cn04Dmzeaa	You definitely have bulimia and should seek help, being under 100 pounds means you're underweight (in accordance to the BMI scale).<br>  <br>  Guys don't like girls that skinny, I think it's gross when a girl is that skinny, and you're not fat either, far from it, I think people are just saying that there are healthier ways then jamming something down your throat and throwing it back up, you kill your esophagus doing that from the stomach acid that comes up with it.<br>  <br>  The fact that you not only withhold eating but also purge and bring food back up is a major sign of warning, I urge you to seek council as this is a serious problem,<br>  <br>  P.S being 5'4 and 140 pounds is not obese.|`|0575e658d68f60d2399b062f93a12a41aa	i agree. you do have bulimia. it is a condition whereby you will tend to eat a lot of high calorie food and feel guilty and make yourself vomit.<br>  speak to someone pls. a school counsellor or something if you do not wat to speak to your parents. if you really dont want to get advise from anyone, AT LEAST try not to make yourself vomit. and you are really underweight! you are not fat. even if you really want to lose weight, try doing it the healthy way! like cutting down on oily or fatty food! and exercise regularly! <br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|kGxvT3AXaa	You have bulemia. at 5'4 you should be around 140lbs. You're seriously underweight. You should go to a counselling group or something.
nF0Eaa2Gaa	What's the full name of the antibiotic? But it sounds like Amox-Clav or Amoxicilllin. In this case, yes.|`|pha427Puaa	As long as its not methicillin-resistant (MRSA). If it is a MRSA, any penicillin will be ineffective.
aa673f8d0b3f8397baf3af4288720b12aa	If the doctor can't answer the question about your daughter needing tubes, no one on here can answer either. I know you'll be concerned about her as she is only young but the folks on here aren't the answer. We can't look into your little ones ears and even if we could we wouldn't understand what we were seeing. They obviously don't know and are keeping their options open. I wish I could answer your question and allay your fears but I can't.
Kq4usVUTaa	Yes, provided that the person with COPD is not sick with an infection.  COPD is a condition that affects the lungs, and therefore, they are more susceptible to infections like pneumonia.  A child with leukemia will most likely be receiving chemotherapy, which suppresses the immune system and therefore makes them more susceptible to infection.  Since the child's immune system is already suppressed, it will be very difficult for them to get rid of the infection.  But, like I said if the COPD person is "healthy" (meaning non-infectious) there's no reason why they can't be around a leukemia patient.|`|GcWRPLd6aa	both COPD and leukemia are non-infectious, so yes|`|2GRfYDSpaa	do you mean obsessive compulsive disorder? ofcourse they can!|`|UPgLy0Ahaa	Neither are contagious.<br>  <br>  COPD is a build of fluid in the lungs, it's not like bronchitis or anything.<br>  <br>  I feel for you hon' if you're dealing with this situation, IRL.<br>  <br>  Is.33:24 Rev.21:4|`|sw2R5A9iaa	of course
aa673f8d0b3f8397baf3af4288720b12aa	Because it is the easy way out  You don't have to deny yourself food or do anything that will make you sweat.  Its the lazy way to weight loss.
uFadRgjsaa	Well, just be ready. Make sure you have all your supplies with you in a little bag. I would just check before, during a couple of times and after. You never know! Or even just wear one in case!!<br>  x|`|DaXu6JMDaa	stay worried...it works. when women and young ladies are worried about being pregnant, something in school, work related their period is late. I dont know why but, it happens....also just keep going to the restroom and check if you see the spots you can catch it before it's too late and wear a tampon or pad..|`|13ca5bfa28957cf9a08b2131fa62965faa	I'd wear a pad and check every two hours or so depending on your flow.|`|3WcCeOqdaa	Definitely do not use scented menstrual products. In fact, non-organic cotton is one of the most pesticide laden crops there is in the world so unless you use organic cotton tampons, you still risk TSS (Toxic Shock Syndrome) if you leave a tampon in too long. Using them anyway exposes you to the pesticides in the cotton.<br>  <br>  In any case, I have used organic cotton tampons but the best thing since sliced bread for periods is a menstrual cup! You need nothing else and it's so easy and versatile and very cost efficient.<br>  <br>  Check out either the Diva Cup or The Keeper. The Keeper is no longer sold in Canada (that's what I used for 2+ years, the same one even!) because it's made in the USA and the company didn't get a renewed license with Health Canada or something but now I've ordered the Diva Cup which is similar.<br>  <br>  Basically the cup holds about 6 oz of menstrual fluid. It's easy to insert and extract to empty. On your heaviest days you may want to check it a few times throughout the day to see how often you may need to empty it. It too can overflow and leak but once you're used to it in conjunction with your flow, you will never use pads or tampons again!<br>  <br>  Different companies will sell these. I got mine from <a href="http://www.grassrootsstore.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.grassrootsstore.com/</a> but they each have their own sites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.divacup.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.divacup.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.keeper.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.keeper.com/</a><br>  <br>  You can probably get them cheaper but I paid around $50 for The Keeper. That's about 4 or 5 boxes of tampons; so how long would that last you? The "cup" will last several months. They recommend changing it every year but mine literally lasted longer than 2 years. Not only do you not have to carry around tampons but you're not filling landfills with menstrual products! You don't have to worry about properly disposing of anything.<br>  <br>  Cleaning is easy. Anti-bacterial soap and warm/hot water.<br>  <br>  They generally come in 2 sizes: regular and "have had a baby" (since you stretch so the size would have to be a bit bigger).<br>  <br>  PS: I am a black belt in karate and have found this product absolutely fabulous! In karate, I wear a WHITE uniform for several hours and there's been NO accidents. :)|`|AA11303574	wear a pad  incase and keep checking|`|uJU7jGtHaa	be ready for it lol. just use a sanitary towel incase x|`|c8lBbWtQaa	Wear your protection anyway then you can relax & enjoy.|`|CpevWaQ7aa	Just be prepared wear a pad and have some more to spear|`|2UNBPcxTaa	wear a pad or tampon.check throughout the party.good luck!|`|OBjW71zIaa	wear a tampon or pad just in case, so you don't leak everywhere.
uJKTR4d2aa	Treadmil by far. Bike burns a lot of calories, but treadmill burns WAY more because you have to hold your body up instead of sitting down. Less than 3 months i lost about 38 pounds|`|g2h6qUUXaa	i prefer doing the bike|`|CjKY2oinaa	A treadmill will give you a better work out because running burns more calories than cycling. It won't be long before you feel the benefits.
LsHkgexvaa	Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchi in your lungs. If you went to the doctor he probably gave you a inhaler and some antibiotics. It will only last a few days in most cases. Since you have asthma it may take a little longer to overcome.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	viral illnesses can last 3-21 days.  follow up with your pulmonologist.  use your inhalers & nebulizer as needed.|`|ZNEta0jMaa	Usually once on antibiotics you feel much better in two to three days.  With asthma it may take longer.  When I have had it by the time the 10 days of antibiotics are gone I am over it.|`|5fdTiI5baa	girl you will have trouble all your life the winter is bad so is spring so take every and try to enjoy life so to be complete
rRVzWFYZaa	Are you trying to lose weight? Because at 5'8" 120 lbs, you're underweight, which could be bad for your baby.
N956bVxhaa	1.  Lower heart rate<br>  2.  Deeper, better sleep patterns<br>  3.  Stronger immune system|`|M1PYqC3qaa	- Exercise releases endorphins, which make you feel happier and energetic all the time :)<br>  - You are more likely to be slimmer, which is great for the self-esteem. You feel happier with yourself. <br>  - Healthy foods tend to be more exciting than just a burger. You can experiment with different recipes and new kinds of food which make life more interesting.
wwTFw0faaa	Higher chance of lung cancer, taste buds do not perceive tastes as well, secondary smoke can affect children and others with allergies or other health issues|`|OBT3C4zHaa	Not being able to run or exercise as well/ Having to stop what your doing to go have a cigarette|`|5fdTiI5baa	breathing / taste/go bad
N5fPygmPaa	As far as I know, Africans aren't immune to any diseases. People who have the sickle-cell gene are resistant to malaria, but they can still get it. Also, many Africans get diseases (like parasites, various fevers) as children & build up immunity that way, but they aren't born immune.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for some info on King Leopold and how bad he was for Africa, a good book is "King Leopold's Ghost"|`|b20a242c48ebd2517a022a7a237bb8f9aa	I don't see what diseases has to do with Leopold II.<br>  <br>  If you want to make a case against Leopold II skip the slavery which there wasn't technically speaking and concentrate on forced labor.<br>  The system was not slavery but obligation to deliver a certain quantity of ivory and rubber as "taxes".<br>  As long as a village payed the "taxes" they were free to do what they wanted, so this is not slavery.   The result was almost the same but if you do a project do it right with the correct definitions.
54fb3ea85549743b677d80a7f77b2b37aa	yeah you should be but it depends on how long it takes for your body to react to the laxative.|`|GcWRPLd6aa	Are you constipated? if you are not there's really no reason to be using laxatives<br>  <br>  if you are, I would recommend any type of bulk-laxatives or fiber supplements. Those are first line, the safest and least amount of side effects|`|sFLP5d5Faa	You'll most probably crap yourself.
L8zZ3eZKaa	Oven chips and potato wedges are much healthier than normal chips.|`|X5C5UhPFaa	I found some air popped chips at sam's that are made of vegetables.<br>  Not salty. not oily.  they have a fresh vegetable taste. They are chips, but are made of potato, spinach and tomato. they are yellow, green and red. the taste is very good. different than you expect. It is a huge bag and I have never seen them except at sam's club.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	Have you tried Terra Chips? They are made from different kinds of vegetables-parsnips, taro, sweet potato, batata.  Also you can't beat pork rinds if you are low carbing, plantain chips are also a good choice.|`|SK5wHr5zaa	Baked potato.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Well they're crackers, small, but 27 crackers for 120 calories and very healthy. Special k crackers. Again though, they are small. haha.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	potato wedges cooked in the oven
6wW7iLrbaa	I don't think so, but they do not work and the only thing that will become lighter will be your purse. They do not work they are targetted at lazy people- people to lazy to exercise, people to lazy to eat healthily, people to lazy research whether theis junk works.|`|AA12238474	Its unsafe for anyone to take dieting pills|`|0cr9lCzhaa	All your answers below are correct, Diet pills ARE unsafe at any age. It is American way, think easiest answer is in the pill, no easy way , then to sweat, good nutrition, exercise is key , in order to lose weight. don't diet either, for your body will think you are starving it, hold on to the calories it has ..very bad for you.. I yo-yo diets , years ago, I now Only eat right, exercise 6 days a wk...weight training, cardio, circuit training, (which is strength, endurance, fat loss )  Great!!!<br>  Good luck, with it, if you don't know, ask someone who is a nutritionist, or trainer-certified in your area.|`|cku5S9WLaa	Its unsafe for anyone to take those and by the way they don't work. They are a scam.

QsbB6vkoaa	my son was born with a heart murmur. and he's alright, he got better.<br>  there are a few things that you have to be more careful with, like when you go to the dentist you have to mention that to them, but other than that i don't thing it's a huge thing to worry about.<br>  you should get a second opinion, with a different doctor, and in case you do have one, then you can go to a heart doctor, and he'll tell you the risks, and what you have to be careful with.<br>  good luck
LcOPL8gCaa	Hun i hate to break it to you, but your not gonna grow faster... All i can say is get lots of sleep, drink lots of milk, eat veggies, and exercise daily. Maybe take some vitamins? I think there is nothing you really can do, but it might help? Most people grow in summer, so do all that and wait until summer you should grow some more.<br>  Your still young! Good Luck & Best Wishes<br>  P.s Don't drink coffee|`|68PBA0wKaa	lol. I'm short too, I'm only 5 feet and I'm 22. Don't feel bad about it, some people are tall and some are short. Embrace your shortness and don't let it stop you from being all you want to be.|`|6BSmZKQ0aa	Just keep getting sleep thats what helps the most and if you havnt really gotten your growth spurt dont worry 5 ft is average for a girl unless your a boy but im 5 ft 3 and im 13 so|`|LssMoEwQaa	i feel your pain.<br>  <br>  <br>  im 13 and 4ft 10!<br>  <br>  but i have a friend grace who is short too an we are cool wit it. do not be ashamed. its cool being short:) it makes you different(:|`|SZXJvaIoaa	You are just 13, probably you'll grow taller if you stop worrying right now. So relax, better if you grow taller else as the other answerer said no worries|`|sQu3LLqtaa	You will probably peak at 5'2 at 15 when girls usually stop growing.  With a further growth spurt you could peak at a taller height.|`|QLopvWKDaa	Good nutrition and exercise (do not do weight lifting) could maybe eek another 1/2- 1 inch of height for you, but once you have completed puberty, your bones round off and you can not get any taller.<br>  <br>  I have known a few women that continued to grow very slowly until their early twenties gaining an additional inch- but again, nutrition was the key.<br>  <br>  BTW I am 4'11 and absolutely love it!  Good luck!
UU1YR1Kaaa	Suggestion, explain to her your dilema, and ask her to smoke outside as much as possible if she will not quit, show her pictures of someone's lungs after smoking for a time period. Next, take with you to school a bounce sheet every day and rub it on your clothes before you have class, also get some cologne and spritz yourself.  Next, get hair spritzer that smells good. Avon makes a tropical fresh hair spritzer that will help to.  Keep bounce sheets in your purse.  That should help with the smells, or you can also use febreeze bottles Good luck.|`|epgMbc4Vaa	This happens to a lot of kids unfortunately.Did you try talking to your mom about smoking outside? tell her that your embarrassed that you smell like smoke.I actually love the smell of smoke, I guess your friends don't.If your mom won't stop smoking, and your under aged to move out you'll have to deal with it.|`|cyprIPVOaa	I am a mom and a smoker my son harped on me so bad that i finally did go outside and smoke it is alot better now with the smell on my sons clothes as for the pcture of lungs after smoking not going to work if she wants to quit she will dont force her its the one thing she has that she enjoys b4 she passes on the dryer sheet idea also works too <br>  GOOD LUCK
LpuNaEYoaa	You need to make sure you eat enough to keep your metabolism high. Also, you may want to consider changing your routine a little bit, because, if you have been doing it for a long time, your body will get used to it and will settle without you seeing any results.|`|84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	You need to understand that the vegan diet is contrary to good health and leads to disease.  Primitive man proved this and in fact, their is NO culture in the entire world that lives on a vegan diet that is healthy.  Pavlov Areola was a very well respected author and nutritionist that promoted vegetarianism and bordered on veganism.  He wrote many books on the subject and died at 62 with a stroke.  <br>  <br>  Eating NO meat will leave you vitamin B-12 deficient and the plant substitute used to supplement this is not true B-12 and you will suffer the consequences of this.  Your diet is way to heavy in carbs and this is telling your fat tissue you are starving and the Leptin hormone is telling your body you are starving.  This will lead to plateauing because the body is trying to survive and your metabolism is slowing down to compensate.  You are basically starving to death slowly by eating this way.<br>  <br>  I know this is not a popular view point, but the facts are what they are.  <br>  <br>  Fat is very necessary for good endocrine hormone production and you are most likely deriving your energy from cortisol production that is exhausting your adrenal glands.  All this will eventually cause you to head toward being less healthy, not more healthy.  Veganism is the ultimate indoctrination by so called "health food fanatics," that are not really fanatics at all, just well meaning people that have bought into the myth that we should be eating no meat, etc.  <br>  <br>  The real problem is not the meat, but how it is process and grown.  The same goes for dairy, etc.  You are right not to want to eat that garbage you find in the Mausoleums where dead food is held in state (super markets that are NOT super at all).<br>  <br>  It's very important to become educated on real health and eliminate the lies you have come to believe.  <br>  <br>  good luck to you|`|yQdA5rHnaa	short of not eating i don't think there is anything else you can do.|`|Ry77jN0qaa	if your doing all that and still overwieght you should try Meth. its a proven fat burner. but be carfull taking it because it will cause you teeth to fall out, several years in prison, and loss of friends and family. not to mention it will make you really ugly.|`|g2h6qUUXaa	you need to eat some meat lack of protein is not good!
IxoBFCpTaa	? Yes it can. Acne has several causes.
psX9K1rgaa	if it has been a week, it should be out of your system already.  no they do not during a physical and you can choose to keep the results to yourself under law.  NO BLEACH!!!!!!! that will only hurt your system!|`|pqqKLCmwaa	Please don't drink bleach.You will end up ijn the ER as an attempted suicide. That will really open up a can of worms.There is some herbal stuff called "The Fix" sometimes available at Health food stores,or head shops if you can find one. <br>      But, they are not going to test for drugs unless suspected or asked. Routine urinalysis will not show it up . Best idea, don't smoke . Its expensive.You could get busted. It will eventually make you dumb.|`|4kM6ei3haa	you have a few days, so plenty of time. Just drink allot of water and go the bathroom as many times as possible, before your physical. I know everyone is saying that they do not test, but... better safe than sorry. And don't ever drink bleach....!!!!   And stay away from what ever pill your bro is talking about. The show up in a drug test. There is a drink out that works well too.  It works well.  But you won't be needing it. JUST SAY "NO" from here on out....|`|AA10825581	They do not test for marijuana during a physical unless they are asked to do so.|`|cMFvCVGoaa	um, only that drinking bleach is probably a bad idea.

OBT3C4zHaa	Tachycardia simply means your pulse is above 100 BPM. Being in a stressful situation is enough to cause this. Theres also 2 types of tachycardia. There's Sinus tachycardia. which Im betting includes what you went through. It isn't anything dangerous really but it's something good to be aware of. Then there's Ventricular Tachycardia which you DON"T want to have but I'll skip the details on those.<br>  <br>  You can go into your doctors and talk to him about having a high pulse and if they see it as something to worry about they may prescribe you a beta-blocker or other medication that works by slowing the heart down. I used to suffer from anxiety and my pulse would always shoot up from it so they prescribed me a beta-blocker and it has definitely helped.<br>  <br>  The hospital staff seem to love to say "tachycardic" but don't let it bother you, I personally think they're just saying it to look cool.<br>  <br>  I don't know your age and your whole medical history but If your in decent shape and aren't older you have no reason to worry about being in a tachycardic state after excercising. It's good for us to get your heart rates up during exercise, but there are limits. So there's no reason to worry if your pulse has skyrocketed after an intense exercise, as long as it goes down soon afterwards.<br>  <br>  Asking about chest pain is a standard question that is asked to anyone that comes into the ER so I wouldn't worry about that.<br>  <br>  Get an appointment with your doctor just to be on the safe side, but I'm betting you have nothing to worry about.
fwWO14fIaa	Eating a nutritious breakfast is essential for a healthy diet. Studies show that eating breakfast prepares you for the day ahead both mentally and physically.<br>  Research shows that eating first thing in the morning helps to stabilise blood sugar levels, which control appetite and energy.<br>  Skipping breakfast can lead to tiredness, lack of concentration and poor performance at work or school.  It also means that you are more likely to snack on unhealthy foods such as chocolate or crisps before lunch.<br>  If you are trying to lose weight, skipping breakfast doesn't actually help. This is because of your metabolism. Your metabolic rate is the amount of energy your body uses when you are resting. Breakfast gives your metabolism a kick start. Not eating breakfast will cause your metabolism to be sluggish and you will store more fat.<br>  Eating breakfast also has long term health benefits. It can reduce the risk of obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes.|`|ON7F1YRsaa	It starts up your digestive system/ gets your metabolism going. When you sleep, your metabolism slows, so eating when you wake up helps get things going, and if you eat right, can actually help you lose weight. Also, it gives you energy to start the day!
bQisGgSsaa	About 1 pound, because diet and exercise is not enough. You need strength training. Strength training adds muscle, and muscle burns FAT.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Not much unless you are exercising.

Along with exercise , eating right, but diets are worst for you. you wanna eat protein, complex carbs , I snack all day, along with exercise, i weight train, circuit training, & cardio is a must , in order to lose weight. If you are determined, look into Women's  Health & Fitness, join local gym or ask someone who does know. Good luck, Don't diet. Eating  less only hinders you, Body will think you aren't feeding enough , hold on to all the weight , thinking you are starving it..|`|dEfq3UJgaa	Hardly any . You need to eat 5 or 6 smaller meals a day, and take up some kinda exericse. Bike riding is always a lot of fun. You dont have to go to a fitness center or anything. Walking is good too.<br>  <br>  But if you cut back severely enough, you will not lose weight. Your body will think it is starving and hold in anything it gets.|`|jRYyfez3aa	diet isn't the only thing involved with weight loss.<br>  you also need to incorporate exercise and you'll start to see more results that way.<br>  <br>  hope i helped.

You may have come in here and slaved at the keyboard almost every night for years hoping to make a tangible difference to the whole community, and you have, you're quite revered here and many people are better informed for your being here but, it can be incredibly frustrating when you give an answer that is correct and they're just looking for an answer they want to hear and either ask the question again or go with the next most apparently plausible spammy scam; because they have this image in there head of themselves as they'd like to be and feel a sense of entitlement to it and want to have a 6 pack by the time summer camp starts next week or fit into a dress for prom etc and as unrealistic as these goals sound these people are desperate for a miracle and you cannot feel personally responsible for their desperate ignorane or overwhelmed and exhausted by how devoutly they cling onto it - they'll either get it eventually or go through their whole lives fat, even if you give them the ideal diet, weight loss is a discipline and you can tell them the facts and they might accept them, but they won't necessarily go by anything you say.|`|oK9WhUkiaa	i don't know why people keep bombarding us so much with those questions, the answer is obvious.. eat healthy food and exercise a lot. they could easily google it too or look for a resolved question on here instead of posting a new one. <br>  although there are some circumstances where people gain weight due to something different than eating the wrong foods and being lazy. like a condition or genetics. so its not always so easy. <br>  <br>  i think its pointless seeing soooo many 'am i pretty' 'rate me out of 10' questions. so pointless and shallow. whats going on with the world !?... i blame the media. lol. <br>  <br>  x|`|xqQO81Omaa	Eat less and take more exercise is a pretty broad statement. To reduce body fat levels it's about replacing fat with muscle.

I've always been very slim and in good shape and put that down to eating a balanced diet and having the right amount of exercise, 30 minute walk per day does wonders for my health and it's always a case of eating less and doing more exercise as I've told countless people who've asked me what me secret is to being slim. Many of those diets must be nothing more than fads, which prey on peoples weakness and determination to have quick weight loss.<br>  <br>  Thank you and best wishes :)|`|n9Oq6Xigaa	You are right Dr. Frank.<br>  I think it is the fault of the current climate of size zero celebrities and advertisements for supposed wonder drugs.<br>  In our hearts, we know that the only way to lose weight is to eat less calories than our bodies need, and take a reasonable amount of exercise to tone up our bodies. Both in sensible amounts.<br>  Cut down the amount of exposure these celebs get, promote curvier women, and prosecute the companies who make dishonest claims about their so-called slimming products.|`|74732313f2bc588e109ce9b8e7b4e8f6aa	Hello Frank, <br>  I was once one of those to ask this question.....<br>  I go to weight watchers now,  where there is no dieting these just educate you about sensible eating, i am now almost at the weight i should be, ive lost 1 and 1/2 stones since January 1st <br>  <br>  The reason i think it works for me is you can still have absolutly anything you want to eat as long as you count it within your points for the day.

Its little wonder then that you no longer practise.|`|7zKz0LT3aa	It's beyond pointless, however we've become a society of entitlement whores where many people seem to expect something of nothing and weight loss is no exception.<br>  <br>  I salute your efforts. :)|`|cku5S9WLaa	Thanks Dr. Frank. Unfortunately, those questions will keep coming. lol And it seems as though most of them are from young teens.|`|SAUrYW0Daa	Why not give this category a rest for awhile?|`|BtgNH2Yaaa	Well I have to agree with you.  I am not a Doctor.  But now I know how to lose weight in a sensible way and keep the weight off.<br>  <br>  I too had tried many, many times to lose weight by trying different quick-fix diets.  Of course, I did manage to lose some weight.  But unfortunately, as soon as I resumed to back to normal eating habits and activity levels.  I did once again, put all the weight back on.  This just became a vicious circle.   This is the problem with quick-fix diets, they don't help you to make changes that you can maintain in the long-term.<br>  <br>  So I set out to change my eating habits and embarked on regular exercise.  The results were amazing.  I managed to lose 48lbs in just over 6 months.  This was over 2 years ago.  I have since then been able to maintain my weight with ease.<br>  <br>  I now run on a regular basis.  I am training for my first marathon in April.  It's never too late you know.  I am 47.<br>  <br>  Many slim people who stay that way show flexible restaint.  Rather than following rigid all-or-nothing rules.  <br>  <br>  I now make healthy choices most of the time, but no foods are forbidden.  And to me this means enjoying small amounts of my favourite foods without feeling guilty.  But if I do over-indulge, or have a big meal out.  I then cut back or do a bit more exercise the next day to balance things out.<br>  <br>  I now know what to do in order to say slim.  Yes, I will continue to eat a healthy, balanced diet and take regular exercise.    I have never felt so great.<br>  <br>  The two work perfectly together.<br>  <br>  There is no magic formula when it comes to quick weight loss.  Many people imagine that weight loss can happen over night.  But it can't.  It takes a while to pile the weight on so it won't come off over night.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, that's my bit said now.|`|TbiMwJSoaa	Dr Frank, you've got it in a nutshell!<br>  <br>  I stupidly thought I could use my hyperthyroidism as a 'weight loss program' (as you will know) thus endangering my health.<br>  <br>  I started to put weight on whilst taking my anti thyroid medication because I ate the same and didn't do much exercise.<br>  <br>  Now that I have my sensible head screwed tightly back on and doing as the doctors tell me with my medication - I am losing weight - simply because I take long walks with my husband or my friends and I am eating sensibly.<br>  <br>  The weight might be coming off slowly but that's the way it should be done - it will stay off as I have made a lifestyle change that I will stick to - not tried some fad diet.<br>  <br>  I seem to feel less tired and sluggish as well - must be all the fresh air and exercise.<br>  <br>  For people who can't afford swimming or gyms - walking is free and makes you feel good as well.<br>  <br>  Can't the people who post the weight loss questions not just read the one posted a few minutes before them.<br>  <br>  Ps thanks for all your advice when I was being a bit silly over my thyroid issues.|`|aea91089c610a2cbd1a2d5f443c3fa78aa	I do find the media obsession with diets to be extremely annoying.  So it's no wonder that people can think of nothing else when they are constantly bombarded with it.<br>  But I have to point out that the exercise and calorie reduction route you suggested may not work.  I used to eat to excess and never felt full.  I still don't!  I was never interested in exercising either... Yet (apart from the huge mammaries) I always remained fairly slim and had a constant weight.  <br>  However, I suddenly started putting on huge amounts of weight - even though I substantially reduced my food intake to try to counteract it.  I was going up a dress size a month at one stage.  <br>  I realised that I had symptoms of Thyroid deficiency and took myself off to the doctors to be tested.  I was informed that the results were normal.  But after 4 years my weight was still increasing and I couldnt stay awake.  I returned to the doctor and explained that although I had been tested there must be something wrong with me to be this way. At this point the medical notes showed I had been tested for 'Iron' deficiency and not 'thyroid' deficiency!  <br>  Even though I have to take replacement therapy for the rest of my life the tablets do not put my weight back to how I was.  My weight has levelled off but I remain huge.  (Exercise is not an option). Incredibly, my weight even INCREASED when the doctor tried me on a calorie controlled diet with anti fat absorbtion tablets!!!<br>  So the answer to being fat may be genetic or hormonal too - and obesity may not be just a case of "Who ate all the pies?..." <br>  I urge you all: Please don't make snap judgements of us fatties.|`|LwywrSRkaa	I completely agree! I do have to say I find it quite funny how easily people are led by the media and stuff. =D<br>  <br>  Thumbs down?! Why? Seriously how many times has it been scientifically proven that some things just don't work like silly diets from TV, or random stuff you put round your waist that's supposed to make you skinny with no exercise?

qQxRDl59aa	There are many different reasons for a late period, not just pregnancy. If your period continues to be late, talk to your doctor. If you think your pregnant, get a pregnancy test. Other factors that may apply: medications your taking, hormonal imbalance, exercise and diet, and stress.

xZG0q6vXaa	Yes, it is normal.  Just starting, your body has yet to get used to this new cycle of things happening to your body.  I never did have a regular cycle until I was almost 18 & got on the pill when my best friend did after having a baby before we graduated.  I went with her to get on it, & I was given the option too (so why not take the chance to get my cycle straightened out; it took a few months, but once it was used to things, I always knew second Tuesday of the month around 11:30 a.m  - noon it was starting & by Thursday near 6 or 7 p.m. it was finished.  Then when I had my tubes tied & no longer needed the pill, my cycle is messed up like crazy again.  I was told 10 yrs was wayyy tooo long to be on the pill; but with previous injuries to my insides having children was deleted from my plans before I lost my virginity any way (which was not until; I was over 18! by my choice).|`|z3Oed98laa	periods dont come every month they come in a cycle form 26-28 days.

EwmHsEoiaa	No it has virtually no energy (calories).  So eat as much of it as you like - it won't make a difference.  It is good for you though - it contains lots of vitamins and minerals.<br>  <br>  You should cut out the pepsi though.  it contains about 10 teaspoons of sugar.  I know it is not as nice but drink water instead.  Your body will convert excess sugar into fat.<br>  <br>  Fizzy drinks are also very bad for your teeth because they contain acid and sugar.|`|AA11314258	It's a wonderful snack! Healthy and it will keep you full.|`|7sPa32GSaa	Broccoli is GREAT for you!  You should also consider adding other veggies such as celery, carrots, salads, etc.  so your body is getting enough nutrients and a nice mix.<br>  <br>  Since you're young, I don't think eating less than 1000 calories is good for you but it may be within your range; I'm not sure.  For a grown woman that needs 2000 calories, eating less than 1200 is harmful and it can actually make you gain weight since your body isn't getting enough calories and converts all the calories it does get into fat.  Assuming you need around 2000 calories a day, your body may be going into "starvation mode."   I would recommend not eating under 1200 calories, but again it may be different since you're not an "adult" yet and your body is still growing.<br>  <br>  I would definitely suggest going to a doctor or nutritionist to see what they think will help you lose weight.  You need to find out how many calories you NEED to figure out how many you should eat.  <br>  <br>  Also, make sure you get enough exercise too!  <br>  <br>  Consider signing up for a free online website where you can track your food such as www.sparkpeople.com (my favorite) or www.mypyramidtracker.gov .  They keep track of your protein, carbs, fat, and calorie intake and you can track calories burned too!<br>  <br>  So, to answer your main question YES broccoli is a great snack and it won't make you gain weight.|`|P8dIznazaa	No, it sounds like you've got a great strategy!  (At least, for as long as you can keep it up.)  Broccoli is *very* low in fat and carbs, and is high in nutrients.  It's good for you and not fattening.  Remember, Weight Watchers gives plain veggies zero points, meaning they're free because you won't gain weight by eating them.|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	no totally awesome.. it is full of antioxidants

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|S77O1w4daa	FYI working out makes you healthier but doesn't necessarily make you lose fat.

cHkH7ESuaa	First question, how much do you weigh??<br>  <br>  Ok - here's the equation for someone that weighes 130 pounds and runs at a 10-minute mile pace: you burn 100 calories for every 10 minutes of running.  (For example, 1 hour = running 6 miles and burning 600 calories).<br>  <br>  AT A 10-MIN MILE PACE: to burn one pound of fat (3,600 calories) you'll need to run for 6 hours which is the equivalent of 36 miles.<br>  <br>  If you only run one mile you'll burn 100 calories.

To loose weight you have to consumer fewer calories and burn more.  It doesn't matter in the long run if those calories are all protein, fat or carbs, what does matter is the number of calories consumed.<br>  <br>  About 3,500 calories adds up to about 1 pound. This applies whether they are food calories coming in, or calories (burned by exercise) going out.<br>  <br>  If you eat 3,500 calories more than your body needs, you will put on about 1 pound. If you use up 3,500 calories more than you eat, you will lose about 1 pound in weight.|`|DgCsBWk9aa	Heres what you have to do:<br>  <br>  <br>  Eat healthier foods.<br>  Eat smaller portions.<br>  Go to the gym and choose more vigorous activities.<br>  Dont ead more than you need to.<br>  <br>  <br>  And thats it.<br>  Simple, huh?<br>  <br>  Diets dont work.<br>  Losing weight is simple.

Many times, people confuse thirst for hunger and end up snacking throughout the day.  Stay hydrated; it's crucial!<br>  Also, be sure to eat a balanced diet.  For most, it works to eat as the food pyramid suggests.  I would start the morning off with some yoghurt mixed with a cereal containing fiber.  Both dairy and fiber are healthy and excellent to keep off pounds.  <br>  When you work out, be sure to change your routine from time to time so that your workout doesn't plateau, because then you'll be doing all that work for nothing!  Try increasing your goal, too!  Be sure to work out at least 20 minutes a day, even if that includes walking to work or taking the stairs instead of the elevator.  <br>  It really is all the little stuff that makes for losing weight a little easier.  <br>  Good luck!|`|jL0Y27g2aa	don't go on a diet, their so bad for you and you don't keep off the weight.<br>  My suggestion is having a healthy diet and lots of excersize.

You need to vary exercises and not 'diet' because once you see yourself at your happy weight you'll stop the diet. You just need to keep to a healthy eating plan.

For example, never eat more than 300 calories at one meal. This will give you a total of 1200 - 1500 calories per day. Weight loss is more about portion size and eating often than anything else.<br>  <br>  Jenny Craig and the others make frozen meals with less than 300 calories.  However, you can find many other cheaper brands like Healthy Choice at the grocery store.<br>  <br>  NEVER drink anything other than water, tea, or coffee.  No added sugar or milk.<br>  <br>  Also, eat fresh fruit and vegetables instead of processed/canned foods.<br>  Try not cooking the fruits and vegetables. They are much better for you RAW.

Research shows that slow, rhythmic movement exercise, such as walking, resets your body’s weight set point and creates a thin, lean body. A one-hour walk everyday will change your body dramatically in as little as one month.<br>  <br>  Eat a big breakfast<br>  It is interesting to note that 80 percent of the people who are overweight eat a small breakfast or none at all. Eighty percent of thin people eat a large breakfast. Your breakfast should consist of as much as you want of the following items. Everything listed should be organic. Eat a huge salad at lunch & dinner<br>  <br>  I don’t care if your lunch is a cheeseburger, French fries, and a pint of ice cream, add to it a big, huge salad and eat that first. You’ll be amazed that you lose weight. The salad can contain anything you like as long as it is only vegetables and they are organic.

cI7CmNGyaa	First you want to ask yourself 'why do I want to lose weight?'<br>  <br>  Is it because you don't like the way you look?<br>  <br>                              or<br>  <br>  Is it because you want to turn on a new leaf into a healthy lifestyle?<br>  <br>  If you're determined into turning in a new and healthy lifestyle, you must remember a few things:<br>  <br>  1. Eat healthy<br>  Don't take junk food or eat betwween meals. have regular meals     and eat more vegetables and fruits. Avoid all oily and fatty food. Eat less red meat and have more fish. Regulate your sugar intake as well like sweets and chocolate.<br>  <br>  2. Exercise<br>  If you don't want to continue being fat, you're gonna have to maintain a healthy lifestyle as well. You can't sit infront of the TV all day. Get UP and go for a walk or a light jog. it won't kill you. This helps digestion and prevents fat from building in your tmmy area or clog your veins. You could also try some sports like tennis or basketball with friends.<br>  <br>  3. Sleep well<br>  Get regular 8hours of sleep daily. Don't take naps in the afternoon or you'll stay up late at night. Sleep early and sleep well so you have enough energy to perform the next day without excess energy from your extra food.<br>  <br>  4. Keep a routined life<br>  Maintain your life in a routined fashion. Don;'t do stuff out of the ordinary lets say going to a restaurant which offers all you can eat out of the blue and you can't resist. Try to control yourself. A routined life makes you more familiar with it and in the long run makes you feel better.<br>  <br>  5 Be determined<br>  You must be determined and concentrate on losing weight. You must set yourself a goal or a small target and do your best to achieve it! Don't get side-tracked or give up halfway through!<br>  <br>  My last words:<br>  I wish you all the best in getting all your want! Good luck and all the best!

If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).

Although they may include success stories, you have to consider the source of these stories.  Are these stories found by the Removyl company or by unbiased researchers?  If Removyl is a herbal supplement sort of thing, it also could be more of a placebo effect.<br>  <br>  Diets that don't include healthy eating and exercise can be more dangerous than beneficial to your health (i.e. certain "diet pills"), I'm not sure about this specific method, but I would beware of some of the scams out there.

GliFw6eWaa	It should be okay to do this although I'm not sure why you would.  Anytime my son has an allergic reaction I have been told to give him benadryl.  This will make the blothches on your skin go away.  If an oatmeal bath will make you feel better that I would do just that, but I think the benadryl would help as long as you are not on any similar medicines.  In that case, it is always best to ask a doctor.
BRXg8Mcpaa	I would wait another couple of days before you go outside or put in too much physical effort.  Your body is still fighting whatever you had, and it needs all the help it can get.

cb2NxPERaa	Natural dieting, it's much better, no side effects, better results and you learn that if you work hard you can achieve something.|`|AA10247648	Losing weight naturally is always the best way.  Taking supplements can damage your health and it is not worth taking chances.  You can accomplish everything you need to do by exercising 30 to 40 minutes each day.<br>  <br>  You have to omit 3500 calories to lose one pound of body weight.  You can cut calories and exercise to do this.  Cutting or burning of 500 calories a day will allow you to lose one pound each weight and do it very easily.|`|RP2QQXbjaa	I think you should try eating healthy and exercising like you had originally planned.  Diet pills often carry adverse side effects and can be dangerous.  I don't know much specifically about Hydroxycut, but you should definitely try natural dieting first.  If that doesn't work, you should speak to your doctor or dietitian to see what they recommend for you.

Do ab exercises to make that area look lean.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	that is classed as your core<br>  to lose fat you will need to do some cardio and strenghten your core with a range of exercises|`|JXw0U77aaa	It's neither; that's your core - your abdominals.  The only way you can lose fat in that area is to lose weight overall, and the only way you can do that is to exercise.  Crunches will help build the muscle underneath the fat, but it won't get rid of the fat.  Cardio, cardio, cardio is the only thing you can do.  And you'll lose fat all over, there's no way to target the fat loss to a specific area.|`|vqdNEtYPaa	There is no way to target fat in specific area's.  That sucks, I know.  Best you can do is exercise until your body starts to use the stored fat from that area.  <br>  I would consider that upper body.<br>  <br>  Edit:  To those stating this is the core, our core goes all the way down into our legs.  Core means the area of our bodies used to lift and balance.
gYDIL3Ipaa	i dont want to be a bad influence but okay il give you some good tips.<br>  eat a filling breakfast every morning, like cereal and then for lunch try not to eat anything or if you do, a really light salad or plain wholemeal bread. for dinner have a soup most have under a 100 calories and this is your main meal so its perfect. throughout the day drink water only when you need it or itll make your stomach bloat like mad. if someone offers you just one treat, like a square of chocolate RESIST, once youve tasted it youll feel bad and want more. keep this up for 2-3 weeks without weighing yourself, have maybe one day you can indulge slightly like sunday but dont go over the top. try this for 2 months, youll get through it and itll be so worth it! :P ohhh and also try 1 hours exercise a night.|`|56a29aa6d5f539c6666e4143f5c5b6cbaa	How tall are you?  Unless you are under 4ft 11 then 7 stone would make you underweight which is very unhealthy.....<br>  <br>  Edit:  Gabriela - cereal for breakfast, no lunch and 100 cal soup for dinner is a seriously unhealthy diet, this would only be 300-400 calories a day (if that) and it will make you ill.  Plus drinking plenty of water, whilst following a HEALTHY diet, will encourage weight loss.

Excessive vomiting causes acid from the stomach to rise up the esophagus, which can lead to infection and even a ruptured esophagus. Acid in the stomach can produce severe ulcers.

yxRGDjs2aa	Hi, ok firstly as a Personal Trainer, I am going to suggest you forget all about this calorie counting stuff, relax a bit hey.  Tell me what it is you are trying to achieve?<br>  In general what I am going to say is this.  Try to eat a balanced intake of healthy food every day.  But don't worry about calories, it will as it is starting to drive you crazy!  Breakfast V. important! cereal or eggs wholegrain stuff.  During the day eat little and often to include fruit, raw carrot sticks wholemeal bread sandwiches.  Drink lots of water as well, then have an evening meal.<br>  But this is just as important.  Don't exclude your little "treats" maybe you like chocolate or a burger? have them, but not everyday.<br>  Get back to me if you want any more advice.<br>  Check out my web site www.srpersonaltraining.co.uk<br>  Good luck and have fun!
aw5BGkmLaa	what you are doing is extremely hazardous to your body. Stop it now. Increase your intake to about 1700 cal. and start cardio excercies.|`|ciz0qYwnaa	Any tips on extreme diets?<br>  Don't do them. <br>  <br>  They're bad for your health. No matter how much weight you lose, when you start eating normally again you will gain ALL the weight back. <br>  <br>  You should eat 5 small meals a day to give you energy, and exercise more than you eat, which might seem a lot - but if you focus on doing things you love it's easy. Take up dance, it's a great way to exercise as it targets all the body parts and you can lose up to 240 calories during a 30-minute dance session. <br>  <br>  Eat around 1800 to 2000 calories a day. You are eating way to little with your 500 calories. You can faint, have a panic attack or heart failure because you're making your heart work too hard (it's trying to work with as little as 500 calories... since you obviously are too tired to even exercise, how do you think your heart feels?).<br>  <br>  Portion control is key to losing weight. Have a SMALL plate of something, not something huge. Eat slowly and eat ONLY until you are satisfied. Satisfied does not mean until you feel like throwing up from the food, it means the point where your stomach does not need anything more. Drink a lot of water and green tea also.|`|ad6YgqZlaa	no offense but I think you're taking your health for granted<br>  I did the same thing about a year ago only slightly more extreme and I genuinely think I ruined a part of my life. <br>  If you continue this less than 500 calorie thing, you will not only lack the energy to exercise, but to produce new cells, keep yourself warm and even pump the blood around your body.<br>  and 18 pounds in 6 weeks is enough to get you externally hospitalised|`|9hTPsTvFaa	look up anorexia on wikipedia.. you are damaging your brain. infact enlarged ventricles which anorexia causes is the same brain abnormality found in schizophrenics.<br>  the brain shrinks and the ventricles get larger<br>  it is possible to lose weight on 1200 cals with exercise.<br>  so by your laziness you will damage brain, body and skin. grow up and get healthy!|`|7evhfqQsaa	dont do them...they'll kill u faster
i8XR3Mfnaa	Crash diets will only work in the short term as even if you were somehow able to stay on the diet, your body would adjust and you would start gaining weight again. I do not condone this behavior, but I did have to loose weight for my wedding, so I can tell you that the Special K diet works pretty well for quick weight loss, and it isn't incredibly bad for compared to other crash diets. You just eat special K for 2 meals a day and then eat sensibly for the 3rd meal. Make sure you take a multi vitamin so you don't make yourself sick :)|`|4A7Codk5aa	You don't need to go on a diet.

Don't focus on the weight, focus on your health and fitness.
Qdw3uPFYaa	Here it is wild man  First off you need to eat!! and don't say "Well I eat too much now" you need to ****** EAT!!! not garbage either, you don't have to eat like a body builder grilled chicken and rice but good non fried foods.   Try this for building your bench do 3 sets of 5 reps with two warm up sets, so you bench 165-175 start out your warm up with 115 for ten reps for your 3x5 set put whatever you know you can do for 5 reps ok, keep the same weight on the bar for all three sets, bench only once a week!!!!!!!  every week add 5lbs and no more!!! take two to three minutes rest between your sets, do your reps at a low-med pace don't slam the bar off you chest like a goof ball, I'm sure you've seen morons doing that.. there is also other muscles that work when benching since it is a compound exercise, so working other supportive muscles is critical to a big bench, try dips, close grip bench , military press. good luck|`|vxMJwivPaa	I don't know how much help I can give you since I'm only a freshman and I girl. haha. So i'll try my best. :]<br>  <br>  Your squat is pretty good. I was squatting about 210 when I was training for tennis. And my bench got stuck at 155. <br>  <br>  You've just gotta keep pushing yourself. Don't do bench first or last, do it in the middle when your adrenaline is pumping but you're not too tired yet.<br>  <br>  If you're stuck in a rut maybe talk to a coach or trainer or something of the sort and inquire as to why you in the rut you're in.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :]

Challenge yourself!<br>  <br>  If you do not see the results you desire, step it up a bit and take advantage of the post-yoga energy surge and go for a run or do some other sort of cardio.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|3b43628da17fa39fdf0695aa42cc5afdaa	To lose weight (fat), include more fibrous slow digesting carbs, as opp. to the fast digesting ones. <br>  <br>  No white breads, fast foods, sodas (not even diet) no ketchups, sugar, only skim milk, not 2%, skim and whole grain non sweet (sugary) cereal, whole wheat bread, maybe buy some soy or whey protein.<br>  <br>  Include lean meats like ham, and other sources of protein. Avoid red meats. Take a multivitamin, calcium and vitamin d every 2 days, one or two V8s a day (or every other day). <br>  <br>  Don't starve, eat small healthy meals. A lot of small meals opposed to a few bigger ones-- make sure is has at least 8-10 or more g of protein, not too much protein because the body can only digest a certain amount at a time; and avoid too many fruits, carbs and sugars. Fibrous veggies, greens (no starches or potatoes) are good, and no BBQ sauce (unless used sparingly) and not too much (if any) salad dressing. <br>  <br>  Before bed (2 hrs), eat something with protein, don't<br>  eat many carbs before bed. Eat some of that good cereal in the morning, you need quality carbs, just not too much, and the slow digesting ones.<br>  <br>  Do slow crunches until you can not do anymore, jog stairs (be safe though), warm up first and do sprints, short bursts of intense activity is very effective compared to long weak activity, just don't over do it. Also include some slow but long endurance jogging. Be active!<br>  <br>  Jog stairs ;and also do some lunges until it burns, do this every day or 2 days, keep going and don't give up, same with eating, you need some fat, so one or two fish oils daily.<br>  <br>  Eat fish (not fried, be careful, very careful for bones) Peanut butter on whole wheat (no jelly), which has protein, and don’t worry about the fat in that. Avocados, has fat, good fat; eat it when your hunger cravings get you. <br>  <br>  When you do crunches, also twist on some to work your sides, keep tension on your abs. <br>  <br>  <br>  Need more info, go to bodybuilding.com|`|oRaYQNXxaa	50 pounds? Thats a good bit of weight. <br>  First of all you need to eat healthy foods. No junking around either. <br>  Drink lots of water. Sodas are just empty calories. And are good at helping you put on weight when you don't want it! <br>  Exercise is very important. You don't have to be a member of a gym in order to do this. Plus its good for you in more ways than one. And in the end you'll be healthier. <br>  Look on google for easy home workouts and good ideas to do to help tone the areas you are concerned about. <br>  Just NEVER pick up an eating disorder. This is terrible and you cause yourself way more harm than good. <br>  Also never skip meals. This makes your body start to run off of the stored fat you have and then it starts conserving more fat which in turn doesn't make you lose any weight.|`|AUsvrW8faa	Cut the calories and increase the activity.  10,000 steps is a pound. Cut portion sizes (look at the suggested serving size-this will help).<br>  Walk 30 minutes a day or more to get to the 10,000 steps a week which equals a pound lost.|`|RmR7Hli9aa	just do simple exercises daily and eat right|`|BSqDYs1eaa	go on a diet|`|xDom6mr3aa	become bulimic,<br>  <br>  however thats a STUPID idea.

Burn more than you consume. Eat whole grains, lean proteins, fresh fruits and vegetables, plenty of water, and exercise. Skip the cake and ice cream. Stick to it. Weight will fall off and you will feel great! I promise.|`|O26WPM7iaa	1) AT LEAST 20 mins of exercising a day (dancing, running, cardio...)<br>  2) 1200 calories every day.<br>  3) Raw foods!!!<br>  4) extremely limited sugar and fat.<br>  It will work. Losing weight is so simple logically, it's just hard mentally. YOU CAN DO IT!!!
v4vQSzu4aa	Dearest Elle, <br>       I know how hard this is for you to hear, it tears the very fabric of your heart into shreds but he is obviously a fighter, having survived the first diagnosis 2 years and 9 months longer than expected, The human spirit and will to live and God knows what other factors attribute to those thousands of people who live long past their "life lines", it is heartwarming to hear that. My Mother was diagnosed with Thymic Carcinoma, Stage IV, 1 1/2 years ago and she is still here today, with the latest CAT scan for a 3 month Chemo break.  She honestly, should be gone by now, because everybody else who was sadly diagnosed with this RARE Cancer has passed away. So, with that, I send you hope, strength, a positive attitude to pass on to your loved one and prayers (don't mean to offend here) but Cancer is like DNA, it's all so different with every single person and who knows how long we all have, with or without Cancer? You already now how to make each day, moment and second count.........so just love him like you always have and be there as much as you can, through anything. And, don't forget to be kind to yourself as well.  May you be blessed with peace, strength, love and FIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!  Have a great weekend!|`|yjDAg8v7aa	My sister in law's father has been treated for cancer 3 times (different areas) and each time he's been told he has at most 6 months to live with chemo, but with encouragement from his friends and family and fantastic medical staffs, he's pulled it through every time :) He just beat his last cancer blow and is in 100 percent remission again. It's been over a decade since the first time he heard, "6 months to live." Best of  luck. Just remember to love on them every chance you get. It does more than you realize!|`|A63YNOTjaa	My brother's best friend has cancer. He's had it since he was 4. When he turned 6, they told him he had around 1 year to live. He is now 13. <br>  My aunt had cancer, and has survived 10 years past the amount of time she was supposed to live.<br>  Just pray that they'll live for longer than expected, and cherish every moment you have with them.<br>  <br>  <br>  (a great story involving cancer is called "My Sister's Keeper" by Jodi Picoult. It's one of my favorite books.)<br>  <br>  God bless you and your loved one.|`|YG288fG4aa	I have no experience with this, but i can say that you should not always feed into what your doctors say, sometimes your doctors doesnt even know their self, the only person that knows when you are going to die is God.
b1NMh5K2aa	Yes if everything matches then im sure you can donate your bone marrow. The hospital is not going to make your friend wait if they already have someone who matches =)|`|P544Sbmqaa	Yes you can.  You would have to be tested first to make sure you are a match.  You will also go through testing to make sure you are healthy enough to donate, and that includes an extensive history.  Make sure you are completly honest about your medical history, even if you think it may disqualify you as a donor.  They ask those questions for a reason.  What you lie about, could be what kills the patient, so you MUST be completly truthful about your medical history.  You DO have doc-patient confidentiality in this, so you should feel comfortable being honest.<br>  <br>  You can be tested privately by a sep doc if you want, Or you can just ask the patient's doc to test you. The girst initial tests are just blood draws that any family doc can do, but if done by a sep doc, they need to cooridinate with the patient's doc for results. You will have to pay for the tests to see if you are a match out of pocket.  If you are infact a match, the patient's insurance pays for everything else and may reimburse typing costs to you.  <br>  <br>  A cheeper route is for you to sign up for the registry.  In the US, it costs 52$ to sign up, but it will cost several hundred for you to pay for typing out of pocket.  After you are in the registry, you are searchable by docs and your friend's doc would be able to find you.  BUT, so can other doctor's of other patients.  It is always your choice to donate, and you can remove yourself from the registry if you want to or decline to donate when contacted, but that route DOES put you on the registry searchable by other docs.<br>  <br>  However, unless you are the sibling, parent, or child of this person, chances are slim you would be a match.  Matching is done by HLA (human leukocyte antigen) tissue typing, and that is basically getting into dna testing.|`|7FGsxx4Qaa	Look,if your friend is being treated or in hospital,you can offer to be tested for compatibility..It shouldn't be that difficult ..............<br>  <br>  Edit...On looking at a similar question on here,apparently a sibling donor would be a more likely match.......

U2FBDStxaa	If you want you could be my contact so you can say you have a friend. <br>    There is a point for you to be here on earth, sometimes you haven't realized it yet. Some kids are real jerks... ignore them and instead of revolving your life around the negative, revolve it around the positive. I will even give you a star as a confidence booster.<br>    And you do have fans on your profile so that must mean something!|`|ParFJxnSaa	Ask yourself: "Why do I feel depressed, and when did I first start to feel this way: can I associate this with any recent change in my life?" (if so, it is probably reactive [situational] depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may be indicated, but most of life's adverse situations are resolved within 16 weeks, yet the medical criteria for depression, and the prescription of antidepressants is only 2 weeks!). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment). <br>  <br>  It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor. <br>  <br>  (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, don’t follow the typical “normal” reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements. <br>  <br>  (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes minutes of exercise, daily, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.|`|XG48COcKaa	two rules<br>  <br>  you are not important as you think<br>  <br>   you are more important than you think|`|m7JM1ntbaa	that is not depression.<br>  how about living through your dad being violent torwards your mum for 16 years?<br>  and yes hardly anyone likes me at school...<br>  im only a year older than you.<br>  you dont see me bursting into tears and caring...<br>  you just need to stand up to all those dickheads and not care what they think of you.<br>  its a simple as that.<br>  and if you want to die but are afraid to. your certainly not depressed.<br>  depressed people are NOT afraid to die.<br>  so yeah, what do you need to die for?<br>  their just immature kids that will grow out of it eventually and realise their pricks.<br>  so yeah just stand up to them.<br>  if that doesnt work.<br>  tell someone.|`|TqS3vGXFaa	Wow, those stupid bullies!  I wish I could punch them in the face!<br>  <br>  I know you won't believe me when I say this, but in about 3 to 4 years, those people won't pick on you anymore and they will probably be embarassed when they look back at themselves.

Thats something immature children do.  <br>  <br>  Don't worry...there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

I am so sorry you have to go through this.  Have you talked to your Mom and told her what is going on or your school guidance counselor?  I think if you get some counseling and just realize these are just mean people that see you as a scapegoat and someone easy to harass, they will leave you alone.  Don't let these people intimidate you honey, they are usually the biggest cowards on earth.  Please do not ever consider taking your life, these people are just people passing through your life and you are young enough that the best is yet to come. Talk to your parents and guidance counselor and have some self esteem.  Good Luck to you and enjoy.|`|8Raw4M1naa	Depression is more than just simply feeling sad. I am acctually enrolled in a college level course about Metal Health and depression is catagorized as a clinical condition, just like diabetes, cancer etc... Its nothing you can just will away, or ignore and hope it gets better. Seek professional counselling, either through your school, or talk to your mom and see if she can set you up an appointment somewhere.<br>  <br>  Not everyone has the same solution. For some, they just need the tools to cope with everyday troubles, while others have chemical imbalances and need medication.

cku5S9WLaa	Yes. Not eating at McDonalds helps too.|`|OIRI5Ok7aa	Yes, and eating lots of fiber helps as well.

I have heard about the light thingies, it would probably be the best idea. though its better to check with a real doc. =\|`|AA10771601	prozac is known to cause anxiety as is every other anti depressant.|`|0RBiVF20aa	Prozac is not necessarily shown to cause anxiety, however it's extremely important that you discuss this situation with your prescribing doctor, because if you are suffering an increase in depression and anxiety on your medication it could be an adverse effect, or a sign that you are being treated with the wrong type of medication (anti-depressant vs mood stabilizer etc). If your doctor didn't have you come back for a follow up 2-3 weeks after initially prescribing the Prozac, as recommended by the American Board of Psychiatry, you definitely need to talk to another doctor.<br>  <br>  If the Prozac was prescribed by a family practice doctor you should request a referral (free) to a licensed psychiatrist, who is much better equipped to monitor and help you eliminate your anxiety. <br>  <br>  Also, it's important to note that the reason the lights are recommended in SAD therapy is due to vitamin D deficiency especially caused in the winter months when skin exposure to direct sunlight is minimal. Tanning bed lights present a similar effect to SAD lights. If you are vitamin -D deficient, you can just take a supplement and it will have the same effect. Walmart even carries them (look for D-3 supplements in the vitamin aisle). Vitamin D is also relatively safe to take and almost impossible to overdose on. <br>  <br>  In short, TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR, RIGHT AWAY. Don't wait. If you can, see a psychiatrist. They charge on a sliding scale, so even if you don't have insurance it will be affordable. And, if you're dead set on the SAD thing, try tanning once, or take vitamin D for a month, and see how you feel. I should note, my sister tans in the winter (not the summer) to prevent SAD.
aNlT1NRqaa	It's difficult, there's no simple answer. I've had friends and family members get cancer, a few didn't make it.<br>  <br>  Talking and understanding what they're going through and what the future holds is the best thing to help you handle it. Many people don't understand that even though you don't have the cancer, you can be going through the same emotions as those who do. The stress can cause you to become ill as well.<br>  <br>  Talk to your friend with the cancer, as well as your best friend. You can support each other. If needed, go see a counselor. Don't be ashamed of the crying, everyone handles this differently, but crying seems to be a universal constant.

aumpC6TQaa	If you want to lose 2 pounds over the weekend, then yes only eat at most 200 calories. And under 8 grams of fat. Watch the carbs too. When you go to eat your 200 calories, make sure its something that contains a lot of fiber. That way, you will digest it quicker. Try wheat pancakes, wheat bagels with lowfat cream cheese, wheat spaghetti, raisin brand, etc. Also do a lot of exercise. Try running/jogging 20-40 min. a day as well. Then do at least 15 push ups, 25 curl ups, and 30 squats daily. If you want to lose more weight also try walking a fast pace 20-30 min. daily.|`|cMu38qfTaa	that is really unhealthy!!! honestly it will be REALLY hard and really UNHEALTHY to lose two pounds in 2-3 days. but, if your trying to lose weight DONT starve yourself. basically just stop eating fatty foods and exercise more and if u dont exercise at all you will not see a difference.|`|k7PrrAlgaa	ur gna get alot of negative answers<br>  but i starve my self as well<br>  i only drink coffee with milk and sweetner during the day, coffee always makes my hunger pains go away<br>  <br>  at dinner i eat a salad<br>  <br>  when i first start i was huge, i list like 6 pounds in just over 2 days, give a try. good luck|`|uiGx0rPVaa	1. eat organic wheat-free, dairy-free, gluten-free foods<br>  2. no soda nor sweets<br>  3. 40-50 oz of water a day<br>  4 cardio 1 hr for 5x a week<br>  5. eat every 3-4 hrs small portion of food (Like small salad with slice of turkey.)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|85KL0eUUaa	yep<br>  the 200cals and excersise should do it<br>  so would only eating fruit<br>  or eating 600cals and excersise<br>  <br>  if you are a little overweight that could even get rid of 5lb x|`|bM3nTH5Faa	dont eat at all. i lost 10 in three days and we all know its not healthy. its super hard though.. u have to have a lot of willpower..|`|RSUYs8Mzaa	You didn't mention your current weight, which affects things. Don't cut way back on your calories - aim for a thousand, I guess, but make sure it's all healthy stuff, lots of fruits and veggies and maybe a peanut butter sandwich or a little (skinless) chicken for protein. Then workout like CRAZY. 2 pounds means that you have to run a 7000 calorie deficit, so if you rely on a 2000 calorie diet and cut down to 1000 calories (note that starving yourself makes your body less willing to lose weight and to keep off weight you've managed to lose) then you still need 2000 or 3000 calories of workout each day.<br>  <br>  That's a lot of working out.|`|cIFXxcqPaa	DONT LISTEN TO ANYONE ELSE! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I HAVE THE PERFECT ANSWER!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  wrap yourself in saran wrap or just a garbage bag.  put on a few t -shirts and a few long sleeve shirts. then put on about 2 pairs of sweat pants and sweat shirts. go take a jog down your street.<br>  <br>  this will make you sweat ALOT. its easy weight to lose.<br>  <br>  i would know i wrestle and have to be the correct weight every weekend and if im over weight i just put on sweats and go run.|`|yxRGDjs2aa	Hi this sounds crazy!<br>  As this is school doing this, ask yourself, "what is the worst thing that will happen, if I am over the required weight"?

That's very unhealthy! Also stay away from burgers, bacon, etc. Eat more pork and steak.

But that will simply lead you to over-eating, and if you have an inefficient metabolism you will burn it off as you put it on.<br>  <br>  You could try staying away from foods that have negative calories (Carrots, Celery, Apples, etc)  Eat foods that are high in protien, sugars, calories and carbohydrates in hopes that your body will store it as fats and not burn it immediately.<br>  <br>  Optimally you can begin (don't dismiss this, you would have to work extremely hard and very very long, possibly 6hrs a day to turn into an overly muscular person) a weight training routine.  High weight low reps in combination with a high calorie, protien, carb diet will allow you to add thickness to your body without adding fat.  As I stated you can add muscle without looking "disgusting" fairly easily.  If you want to compete in the IBFF you have to work quite hard at building muscle mass.  An hour a day will not turn you into the she-hulk, 6 hours a day every day with the proper diet will.|`|B4nujMnlaa	I'm 14 and am 90 pounds! And I'm really short! OMG! We're alike.

Throwing up is no fun, it really is a horrible feeling. Just keep doing what you do and you wont have to worry about throwing up.
sQe7osBraa	drink lots of water, it will help regulate your system, and improve your skin, hair, and overall level of health. a lot of the time people confuse hunger with thirst, so by drinking lots in addition to maintaining your healthy diet, you ensure that your body is getting what it truly needs. water will help keep you from bloating as well, since it counteracts the salt you eat, which can be a cause of bloating. pilates and yoga are exercise forms you might enjoy. pilates focuses on lengthening and toning the muscles in your body, and yoga has some specific exercises to rid your body of gas that contributes to bloating. good luck!|`|QvDOyPjBaa	that's pretty good.

If its on the inside of your vagina it could be a swollen bartholins gland. I had one and it hurt! it will dissapear in a week or so.<br>  <br>  Bartholin's glands are a pair of small glands that are just next to the lower part of the entrance to the vagina. Each gland is about the size of a pea. Unless diseased or infected, you cannot normally see or feel these glands as they are within the soft tissues (labia) next to the entrance to the vagina.<br>  <br>  Bartholins cyst :<br>  Each gland makes a small amount of mucus-like fluid. The fluid from each gland drains down a short duct (tube) called the Bartholin's gland duct. Each duct is about 2 cm long and comes out towards the lower part of the entrance to the vagina. The fluid helps to keep the entrance to the vagina moist. <br>  If the duct that drains the fluid becomes blocked then a fluid-filled swelling develops (a cyst). The size of a cyst can vary from small and pea-like to the size of a golf ball, or even bigger in some cases. The cyst may remain the same size or may slowly become bigger. The reason why a Bartholin's duct may become blocked and lead to a cyst is not clear.<br>  <br>  Bartholin's abscess<br>  An abscess is a collection of pus (a thick fluid) that can occur with an infection. An abscess can occur in any part of the body, and sometimes occurs in a Bartholin's gland. Sometimes an abscess develops from a Bartholin's cyst that becomes infected. Sometimes the gland itself becomes infected which gets worse and forms into an abscess. Within a few days, the abscess can become the size of a hens egg, sometimes larger, and is usually very painful.<br>  <br>  Many types of bacteria (germs) can infect a Bartholin's cyst or gland to cause an abscess. Most are the common germs that cause skin or urine infections such as Staphylococcus and E. coli. So, any woman can develop a Bartholin's abscess. Some cases are due to sexually transmitted germs such as gonorrhoea or chlamydia.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps =)|`|wN3oFbRpaa	you may have an ovarian cyst, or another type of cyst.

M2XQMPNNaa	It is possible you are having  miscarriage of a very early pregnancy, Other possibilities include fibroids. Try taking the Advil on a cycle, meaning 600mg every 6 hours (if you are able to safely take ibuprofen) and use a heating pad on your belly and/or on your lower back.  If the bleeding increases and/or the pain increases, then you may want to get checked by a Dr. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Ibuprofen helps to block prostaglandins that are the major cause of cramps, back pain and nausea.

ixJB9jZnaa	My doctor says yes.  They can contain 80% of the active/effective ingredients instead of the full 100%.  If you switch, make sure you use a back up source for the first 30-60 days.  I took Seasonale for 4 years, and then my pharmacist gave me Jolessa.  I became pregnant, and did not find out until the 3 month mark!  I would highly recommend staying with name brand, or start off at generic.  Do not switch.|`|Cq5JM8KTaa	The only difference is the price, just like with any medication that has a generic.  When a company comes up with a new drug, they put a patent on it. The patent is good for seven years, after which any company can produce the drug. That is the difference between a name brand and generic. If it were any differently made, it wouldn't be able to be called the same thing.|`|MvXTY3N7aa	no they are no different at all.  They all prevent pregnancy using the same level of hormones.  The shot prevents your period and pregnancy but can cause worse periods after the shot wears off.
0l88fiUTaa	That is so unrealistic.......and unhealthy<br>  It might work on a tv show but that is because they have personal trainer working with them and pushing them to work out, work out and then work out some more.....and keep them on strict diets.  It's a boot camp environment and they are taken out of their everyday life routine so that their only focus during that time is losing weight. In real life, committing all your time only on losing weight is obsessive and not healthy.  Do it naturally by changing your diet: Eat loads of vegetables/fruits, less carbohydrates, no artificial/refined sugar, cut down on the dairy products, drink a lot of water(no artificial sodas, or processed juice with tons of sugar), and exercise at least three times a day for 30min-1hr.....<br>  -take a multivitamin<br>  -drink kefir/ eat yogurt<br>  -eat extra virgin coconut oil <br>  -you can try water with lemon juice in the morning before a meal<br>  -apple cider vinegar(don't overdue it~more is not better!)<br>  Please don't set such an impractical goal for yourself, don't speed up the weight loss process by turning to unhealthy options.......because you'll just end up harming your body and doing irreversible damage to your metabolism.<br>  Stay healthy, be happy and best of luck!<br>  <br>  EDIT: You said that you exercise everyday and consume under 3500 calories a day(hopefully you eat only healthy food~cause it matters and also have you been doing this for a long time? or did you just start and expect fast results?) if you've been at this routine for a while then maybe the problem is that you're not doing the right exercises for your body......also you added that you're depressed about this(hopefully you are not on a daily bases and don't have an overall depression problem, but if you do this can also affect your weight.....also a thyroid problem can make losing/gaining weight very difficult especially if it runs in your family)~ I doubt you have any medical problems especially since I don't think you are that over weight(sorry for bringing this up~ just if you have given all the natural options a try for a long time without any change(ANY change at all) and you feel that your weight is a big problem then be aware that there might be other reasons why you're having trouble losing weight.|`|M2XQMPNNaa	Sorry, that is not a realistic goal. the participants on the show you are referring to have considerably more weight to lose than you do, and they do not lose 15 pounds in a week! You would be best served by increasing fiber, fruits and vegetables and lean proteins and eating portion controlled amounts of complex carbohydrates (whole grains, brown rice) while increasing your exercise. If you are uncertain of how to effectively exercise and build your routine over time, it will be well worth your while to pay a personal fitness trainer to help you set up a routine and as your budget allows have at least once monthly follow up appointments to gauge your progress and make adjustments as needed. By practicing healthier eating and learning how to exercise properly and set and meet goals you will be learning habits that will benefit you for life, and that is a worthwhile obtainable goal.|`|24bdcdc34da2c3f37a8684801cf27971aa	well to tell you the truth. that isn't healthy at all.<br>  i lost 6 pounds in 11  days. but that's because i lost my apetite due to a major surgery. it isn't healthy at all.<br>  try just loosing a few pounds a week|`|POL813fYaa	go on the biggest looser.|`|rtrdOcTcaa	Unless you're morbidly obese - which by your height and weight you're not - it's a BAD idea to lose that much weight in a single week.  Very bad.  As to why you can't lose that much in a week, it has to do with the ratio between the number of pounds you are and the number you are trying to lose - on the Biggest Loser they're all pretty fat, and can afford to drop that many pounds quickly because their body can quickly do without it with no trouble.  You might have a few extra pounds, but because you're not very overweight, your body would go into shock or something just as bad if you lost that much in such a short amount of time.<br>  <br>  Take about two months and try to lose weight that way.  It's better for you, and you'd feel better, too.  Good luck!|`|a9jMOJeHaa	in 1 week is impossible,on the tv show they may eat just salad.<br>  im 24 and 5'5 and right now im 120 pounds,i was 140 and lose 20 pound in 1 month eating healthy such italian food and drink lot of water(i was 140 in USA eating fast food)and workout such walk or play outside with my dog that is the best exercises|`|MvXTY3N7aa	It is dangerous to lose more than 3 pounds in one week, however my father, who is doing a biggest loser Competition, has lost 18 pounds in 3 weeks by documenting calories intake and doing intense workouts.

Why?  Because I did not eat ANYTHING for 8 days and exercised all those days for one hour and I barely saw a difference.  It takes hard work and time to lose weight.

They start at like 300 pounds and you are half of that, once they start losing weight it will get much more difficult. From my experience i know. The most you should lose a week is 1-4 pounds. Any more then that is not healthy and will give you a greater chance of gaining it back later on. Your best bet is to run, everyday. Start by doing what you can, but you should aim for a mile without stopping. Once your body starts getting into shape you can start adding more miles and losing weight faster.

You need variety and other vitamins which comes in other foods . . . that's why.<br>  <br>  It's healthy, but you also need other things . . . more calcium. Do you do this once a day only? The body requires protein, and many other vitamins that, sometimes, only food can provide. The body was meant to be fed, not starved . . . we pee out water and poo out food; after our body absorbs what it need to thrive, survive.<br>  <br>  If you do not provide the vitamins and stuff it needs, regularly . . . it starts seeking the needed minerals, vitamins in your muscles or cells or organs -- this can lead to death of the organs, cells and, of course, physical body.<br>  <br>  I know, I nearly died of anorexia and was diagnosed as "malnourished" and at the age of 20 years old, had a partial stroke and nearly a heart attack!!! This if often why old people get strokes and such . . . lack of the right vitamins.<br>  <br>  So, that's why. Three square meals a day or six small ones, to let your body know you're not starving it too death. Veggies and fruits, pectin is noy in veggies; and there's more pectin in bananas and other fruits then just apples.<br>  <br>  Depending on you age, height and natural weight, that is not enough food to SUSTAIN life. The taller you are, the older, the more vitamins you need. And some multiple vitamins DO NOT provide enough.

What they don't tell you is that the procedure will cost considerably more if you have a strong prescription.<br>  <br>  I'm not considered to be a good candidate for it because my eyes are too dry. Even if I were, I still wouldn't have it done. That's because at my age, I would still have to wear glasses no matter what I decide to do.

It has been perfect for me. I have had no changes. Of course, as I age, I expect changes. I also co-manage refractive surgery and have seen hundreds of successful patients. It doesn't hurt, generally. There is a bit of pressure, but no real pain if you have LASIK. The PRK version (where no flap is cut) is a little more uncomfortable for the first few days following the procedure. I've seen several people who said they were in some pain, but healed just fine. I used to wear both glasses and contact lenses. I had LASIK done and it's the best decision I've ever made. I can see clearly, no squinting, no driving with glasses anymore. I can read road signs, see the individual leaves in the trees (they're not just a blurry mess anymore). It's also nice to be able to see what time it is when I wake up. The procedure is painless (although a bit uncomfortable) but takes less than 15 minutes.

KOYC3XkJaa	It sounds like your nail is growing back. It's not bone, that much I'm sure of. Ingrown nails happen when the sides of the nail curve into the skin and can be caused by pressure on the sides of the nail (such as caused by ill-fitting shoes). I have never heard of an amputated nail growing back ingrown. In fact, the treatment for ingrown nails is removal of the ingrown portion or even the entire nail.

The word "stammering" is usually preferred in the United Kingdom, Eire, India and most other Commonwealth countries. Try deliberately slowing your speech. You could try several different talking speeds: 85%, 90%, 95%, and 100% Consider your current rate of speech as being 105%, a rate at which you stutter frequently. Go back to 85%, then slowly increase, in stages, until you begin to stutter noticeably: then go back to 85%, and work your way up to the rate before you began stuttering at a rate that you find unacceptable. Keep at that rate, for a good while, maybe later, risking stepping it up one more notch; confident that you can always work your way back up from 85% again.     <br>  <br>             Think of it in terms of modem speeds on your computer: if that speed is set too high for the connection to the ISP, there will be problems. You may well be currently "overclocking" your speech modem: the difference between your brain speed, and the rate at which you are able to speak clearly and distinctly, without stuttering markedly, is the issue. A different suggestion is putting some marbles in your mouth.  STAMMERING:  I am informed that if you start to breath out just before you begin vibrating your vocal cords to make sound, it establishes momentum that helps reduce stammering. Good luck!

And I have panic disorder....which is a more severe type of anxiety disorder where I have panic attacks and I have to take medication for it.  But soon after I started my medication, the panic attacks have pretty much went away.  But I still have "social anxiety."<br>  <br>  You can talk to a doctor or mental health professional about it to get a proper diagnosis and medication, if you would like.

AA11185479	First, write about how you feel that day.  Is the migraine on the left or right side, forward or back?  Is it stabbing or pulsing?  How would you describe it?  What time did it start?  When did it get worse and when did it end?  What other symptoms are you feeling - nausea, light sensitivity, irritability, constipation, etc.<br>  <br>  Then write about what you did to treat it.  Did you nap?  Take medication?  Cold compress?  What happened to make it worse - work stress, physical exertion, etc.<br>  <br>  Then write about anything that might be a trigger - foods you ate, the amount and quality of sleep you had last night, the activities you did and their duration, your exposure to weather or animals or stressors.<br>  <br>  You can create a shorthand for these terms - just make sure to write out an explanation of these codes so you know what you are talking about when the doctor reads "10am stabbing right rear, 2 advil good, spicy lunch, 1pm vmt" you can translate to "at 10am I felt a stabbing migraine in the right rear portion of my skull; I felt better after 2 advil tablets, but after a spicy lunch I vomited."|`|nqkXE1cUaa	Just write how the migrane is making you feel, what the pain feels like, and if there was anything you did to try(or did work) to stop it.|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	Plan out what you need to know and taylor the dairy to fit.

If they're open, they've been tampered with.<br>  <br>  Secondly, the chances are pretty slim. They would have to have the virus, first of all. And have had the virus make contact with the lipgloss (through a sore or some other open skin/abrasion). Also, viruses are quite limited in the time they can survive outside a host (since they're technically not a living organism they lack the ability to reproduce and live for long periods of time outside a host).<br>  <br>  Overall I would guess you're pretty safe, but in the future, stick to sealed/unopened packages when it comes to makeup.

cm4oW9lZaa	The changes within your body which lead to water retention are intimately linked to what you eat. They can be set off by any of the following<br>  <br>      * Regularly eating too much salt and/or sugar<br>      * Not eating enough fresh fruit and vegetables<br>      * High levels of wastes or toxins in your body<br>      * Taking certain commonly-prescribed medications<br>      * Long-term use of very low-calorie diets, which tend to be deficient in protein and other nutrients<br>      * Food intolerances (similar to allergies)<br>      * Lack of exercise<br>  <br>  Salt and Sugar<br>  Salt affects your kidneys and blood pressure. The sodium in salt makes your kidneys hold on to water instead of excreting it.<br>  Eating too much sugar raises levels of the hormone insulin. High insulin levels make it hard for you to excrete sodium, so people who indulge a sweet tooth can also be prone to water retention.<br>  <br>  Fruit and vegetables<br>  Certain fruits and vegetables contain special ingredients which help to prevent your blood vessels from leaking fluid into your tissue spaces. To treat or prevent water retention, it is vital to include them in your diet.<br>  There are also herbal products which have a similar strengthening effect. These herbs are not the same as the herbal diuretics which make your kidneys work harder.<br>  <br>  Wastes and toxins<br>  Cellulite is a form of fat complexed with retained water. Sometimes it holds so much water that it is painful to the touch. Metabolic wastes and toxins such as pesticides which the body cannot easily release tend to be stored in this fat and water. The only way to get rid of them is to use foods and herbs which support your body's detox mechanisms.<br>  <br>  Prescribed medicines<br>  Water retention is a little-known side effect of some of the most commonly prescribed medicines. They make you retain water because they affect your body's handling of sodium and insulin. The contraceptive pill is a well-known example.<br>  <br>  Low-Calorie Diets<br>  If you have water retention you are very likely to be overweight. But overweight people tend to go on a low-calorie diet. A low-calorie diet will unfortunately not get rid of water retention - it can actually make it worse, especially if you eat less than 1,200 Calories a day for months or years.<br>  One of the most important nutrients to prevent water retention is protein. Protein is in short supply in very low-calorie diets. The most suitable diet for people with water retention is the Waterfall Diet.<br>  <br>  Food Intolerances<br>  Overloading the stomach, drinking alcohol, taking medications and antibiotics, consuming too much sugar, not getting enough dietary fibre - all these modern-day habits can affect your digestive ability. Undigested particles can get into your blood system and stimulate your immune cells to produce histamine. This histamine is a very big cause of water retention.<br>  <br>  Lack of exercise<br>  People who spend a lot of time immobile, e.g. those in hospital beds, wheelchairs, or on long-haul flights, even "couch potatoes" can develop water retention because without regular movement to help it, your lymphatic system cannot drain excess fluid out of your tissue spaces.
dFHsAXDMaa	Could be many things... scabies... body lice.... just winter dry itchy skin... although that is usually not a sudden thing... I would recommend a quick trip to the ER to find out. they have a special light and simple skin tests they can do and you will be send home with a cream or medicine to help you. do not itch .... tell mom and dad it is really driving you crazy and go to ER. that is why they are there. you especially want to go because if you aught something like scabies or body lice from someone at school you want to catch it before everyone in house gets it.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	It sounds like it could be a prickly heat rash.  Did you get too warm today?|`|tpEuG38saa	well put on some lotion and maybe some of that stuff that u put on bug bites, and if that doesnt help you should most likely tell your parents to take u to the doctor.

x7duxnBLaa	This isn't normal to feel the way that you're feeling.  You need to see your doctor and they may want to run a few tests on you.  Probably the first thing they'll ask you is how long you've been feeling this way.  But definitely see your doctor.  Good luck.|`|CoxTzgHlaa	Please don't be offended, but you could be pregnant.  If that's not the case, you could have an inner ear infection.  Are you dizzy sometimes, do your ears hurt, or do your ears pop?  Ears popping could be a sign of fluid in the ears.  I was sick over the holidays and when I got better I wanted to vomit a lot too.  My ears were popping.  I took an antihistimine for about three or four days and I felt a lot better.  Good luck.|`|a0MgkDk0aa	I thought I was the only person who had this problem! I went to my doctor and he said "oh, its an ulcer" but its not!!|`|lWhWqUSnaa	I dunno but I think you need to see a doctor.  That's not normal.
1pbTmda6aa	My doctor did tell me that migraines can be a side affect of stress.  I know that when I don't have caffeine at some point in the day (gotta have my morning coffee), then I will suffer with one.  It might help too if you make sure to stay hydrated with plenty of water.  I remember when I was in boot camp, I didn't have a single headache the whole time and I always assumed it was from the constant intake of water since we were obviously under tons of stress and didn't have any caffeine.<br>  <br>  My only problem is that the only medication that ever seemed to help me, and I don't know if they make it anymore was Percogesic by Vicks.  So, I have to lay very still, with no noise, and my face covered with a dark, wet rag until I fall asleep for an hour or so.    <br>  <br>  Don't know if that helped at all.|`|xTb8u783aa	if i had a migraines i would be in bed sleep, no computer i have pain all the time can over move it that bad so could not do anything just lay down and sleep. <br>  sleep i get pain headach before hand then the migraines<br>  <br>  1. headach<br>  2. migraines<br>  3. sickness<br>  4. tiyness plus pain. <br>  <br>  all i can say is sleep and get on the pc <br>  and sleep and keep yourslef cool, sleep wil help you loads <br>  <br>  take care if it carrys on for over a week speak to your doctor <br>  take care|`|wyUhx5b6aa	I suffer from migraines too. For instant relief, get a wash cloth and wet it and put in microwave for 1 min. go to a dark quiet room and lay down put the towel right over your face. It will be hot so be careful but take it as hot as you can stand it.  do that a few times. that should help you; if you have ib profin that is the only med that helps me. Also, I get in the shower and let the hot water just pour down the top of my head.<br>  <br>  I lost my job recently; I'm highly stressed and this really relaxes me and eases my mind......take care.
L6ZEQxvLaa	yep, the fiber will give you that fullness feeling.  however it doesn't last forever.  eventually the fiber does its job - cleansing the colon and well now that you're probably feeling more relieved you're probably be wanting to replace it with food.<br>  <br>  ♂<br>  ♀|`|66a13bf9fc4f5831c5a727b2e71e3db9aa	The fiber fills your gut up. Don't worry about it. You'll get used to it and your appetite will return-- by then your cleanse will be over anyway. If you're concerned about energy levels, mix your cleanse, if it's a powder, with a nutritious juice.

rtrdOcTcaa	It could be a stye, which itch a bit, but are not harmful.  Don't touch it; you could give it to other people, too.  Most often they hit the bottom eyelids, but I've had a few on the top ones, too.  I'd wait a few days to a week, and if it doesn't go away by the end of the week, see a doctor.  But I wouldn't worry too much - it's probably a stye, nothing to get alarmed about.|`|PFzqpxQ7aa	I would say that is a "stye"  Google "stye" to see images.

It is important to get it checked as soon as possible.|`|dFHsAXDMaa	As a nurse I am going to tell you to get off the computer and go to the emergency room immediately... Your eyes are not something to mess with and if it is staph that has spread there it could be very dangerous and travel into your system. turn off computer and do get seen immediately worst case scenario staph and they give you antibiotics  or it could be something as simple as a sty. but this is your eye sight we are talking about. keep your fingers out of eye and go to ER right away.
tGEMwgyBaa	I work in a dental office and what I have see is that the mini implants tend to fail. Whether its because of not enough bone support or just not being strong enough to hold the denture in place. I would get a second opinion on the mini implants. You can call around to offices that do both and ask the dentist what he thinks about them. That would probably be your best bet. I hope this helped.. Good Luck
6uQh4VSpaa	That's a pretty common symptom, actually.  Most depressed people stop experiencing pleasure in some or every aspect of their lives (it's called 'anhedonia').  And sometimes, the only thing left to do is sleep.  If you're experiencing that, you should really see a doctor -- life doesn't have to be like that!|`|B1GjfOUdaa	My x does that but not me. Im lucky that ive never suffered from depression just have good days and bad days.|`|ouzrDPaSaa	I've suffered from depression for many years and there's been lots of times where I would have loved to have just "slept the days away" because my negative feelings were just too intense and unbearable.  But Im not the kind of person who can sleep all day, so I knew if I slept earlier I'd only be awake all night which would be worse and more frustrating.  Luckily Im now on a combination of meds that has really improved my depression.  Hope things for you get better soon too :)|`|b418f2cdb879b4a8266bb262f2fee70daa	When I was depressed (I am much better now) I went through phases of either sleeping around the clock (I had to have forced wake ups as I am a type 1 diabetic and need to have food & insulin) or not sleeping for 40 hours at a time.<br>  That is what depression can do to you.<br>  It is also possible to fight depression once you get control of yourself - I still love to lie in - but within reason now!|`|QnJvJ67uaa	After my first baby I spent @ 7 months sleeping on the sofa in the day, I just had no will to do anything, looking back I was suffering from PND but at the time I felt terrible about myself and thought I was just being lazy, I seriously lost whole days to dozing, its almost like a shut down switch when your brain can;t cope anymore.<br>  Good luck x|`|67NqWxuGaa	This sounds like more than depression and you shoulld be checked for adrenal deficiency, thyroid, hormonal imbalances....  take care|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	have a check up ,there are a lot of things that can affect your sleep pattern<br>  hope all is well|`|dEDicypqaa	Gee just went to doc today about this, cannot stay awake at all. sleep hours and hours. i have lost interest in everything. cannot even bear talking to people because i'm so tired to even think!<br>  It's so scary as i never used to be like this, quite the opposite!<br>  have been taking 150mg effoxer xl tabs, now doc has increased dose to 290mg. they work but only for short while :(|`|c9cda9c50df093c9b23661336424b8c3aa	I'm going through exactly what you have described right now and it is hell.

b418f2cdb879b4a8266bb262f2fee70daa	Your hair will be healthy and break less.<br>  Your skin should be clearer than it might be.<br>  Your health will be better - less prone to catching infections, less prone to cramps, less problems with period pains, you will be building a better bone structure for the future and your blood will be able to produce red and white blood cells freely.<br>  All good diets should be able to provide all of these (along with some help from the sun for some of them!) though.
BAJgK3xoaa	you are going through withdrawals, they will pass|`|19QSiNqgaa	the symptoms, especially the headache are symptoms of caffeine withdrawal. expect them to last about three or four days depending on how much caffeine you usually have a day.|`|lAZWTLtRaa	Your body becomes dependent on caffeine. I still remember one of my teachers last year always said how she couldn't live without her caffeine, and I can understand why. It gives you an energy boost, and when it wears off, you just drink more and more, which is what makes your body dependent on it. It's like a drug. <br>  My advice to you: have a cup of coffee in the morning. Limit yourself to that one cup. If you have the urge to drink something hot, have some tea or soup, or just plain boiling water (my friends do this, apparently it helps clear out your system).<br>  If you want to stop completely, drink less and less coffee each day. Avoid drinks with caffeine in them like Coke (and theres many more). I think chocolate has caffeine in it too...anyways keep this stuff in moderation.<br>  If you're feeling tired, move around. Don't sit still in one spot cuz you'll get that lazy feeling and never move. Go to bed earlier and get more sleep. Take your mp3 and go for a walk. If you're on the phone, try to use a portable one to walk around. Don't depend on sugar to get your energy up either. You'll only crash and feel even worse afterwards.<br>  Avoid cat naps because you;ll have a harder time falling asleep at night, thus not getting enough sleep and you'll still feel like crap the next day. If you still feel the same way after about a week or so, go consult your doctor because they can help you out. It's kind of like quitting smoking or stopping drug use. Your body has become dependent on it and used to it, so it has to adjust itself to living without it, which is going to take time. Stay active, don't get lazy, but try to keep your heart rate normal. If it's speeding up or you're getting dizzy, sit down, keep your back straight, and take deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth (purse your lips a little, like you're about to kiss someone on the cheek).<br>  Hope this helps and I hope you start feeling better!<br>  **ps if you're concerned about the palpitations you should go talk to your doctor.|`|BlA60kDVaa	I cannot drink any caffeinated beverages.  I used to drink a lot of coffee in my younger days, but now I find it makes me feel paranoid, shaky and including heart palpitations.<br>  <br>  Caffeine is a drug.<br>  <br>  I have also heard that the so called "energy drinks" like Red Bull etc, can cause your blood to become sticky and can damage your heart.<br>  <br>  There are articles in many past newspapers about this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/red-bull-it-promises-energy-but--doesnt-mention-sticky-blood-899614.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/...</a>|`|Udrr7hTsaa	Yes it is normal to feel that way. Not every one does though. Caffeine is A drug. An addicting drug. The symptoms you feel are from with drawls. Give it time. Your body just needs to adjust. Your brain in essence is rewiring itself. Your body is trying to cope as well. If your still worried try talking to your doctor. Hope this helps!|`|xKnCfHe2aa	prob;y cos of coffee|`|Z7Lq05q2aa	caffine is actually considered a drug(listed under stimulants) and although you need it in super large doses for it to be harmful--its addicting just the same<br>  <br>  you are going thru withdrawal--symptoms suck but stick with it and you'll be ok in a few days!|`|URZeQfQCaa	I give up caffiene all the time, sounds like the usual come down. I take off the edge with a lucozade in the morning instead of the usual 10 cups of brew, works like a charm!|`|oAZOKMpdaa	if you can make it 3 days then you'll be fine. this kind of stuff always happens whne you give up someting|`|6bMBwaosaa	if you were in the habit of drinking a lot of caffeine then yes - you are having withdrawls. It is an addictive substance so your body will be feeling the effects of it. Drink plenty of water and fresh fruit to detox your body and you will soon feel a lot better!
wZYs1Nz6aa	It definitely sounds like migraine. I suffer from them too and your symptoms are almost identical to mine. It may not actually be the caffeine that causing the migraines, it could be the sugar or some other chemical in the drink, or it may not be the drink at all and it's just a coincidence that you get the headaches at the same time. The best thing would be to stop drinking them and see your doctor to et a proper diagnosis.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Well, Bubba!  It's not rocket science.  Get off the soda's & start drinking more water, fruit juices & fat free milk.  If you took time to read all the chemicals in soft drinks - & you keep drinking that stuff - it will build up in your system & cause all kinds of problems.  Common sense should tell you not to keep drinking it.|`|AA10350894	Along with what others have suggested, you also need to bear in mind that energy drinks have more then just caffeine in them!<br>  Read the ingredients sometime, you'd be amazed by all the crap they put in there!|`|SltEwVX7aa	there's a ton more caffeine in those drinks than in coffee.<br>  <br>  yeah, get to a doctor.|`|QSF6FF2Yaa	all those glucose drinks have pure suger and glucose in them which is causing the headaches<br>  try water:)|`|515520c752f4133ee59ea7409ab8e61caa	Hell YEAH!|`|c7YVksUlaa	doesn't sound like a caffeine headache, sounds like a migraine!<br>  <br>  but if you know those drinks are causing it, then it could be your body saying NO to energy drinks.

You can always call your best friend and talk things out. <br>  School counselor might be a good idea, if you get no help from your Mom.|`|QvcJVoE2aa	girl chill life will get better and look at your self you have a life in front of you places to go people to meet. you will find new friends|`|NxKjrz7xaa	do u have yahoo messenger, msg me at basketballbest23 we need to talk|`|YCUJMvWQaa	awww cheer up there buddy I know how you feel trust me I'm going thru bad things myself but we just gotta be strong and we can't give up<br>  ..god gave us all<br>  A<br>  Purpose in life and we have to commit to<br>  It and be strong tour future is going to<br>  Be a bright one but only if your<br>  Positive so cheer.

This one's impossible, but do your best to remember that a drunk dad is not the same man as Sober Dad. Don't let his slurred insults get to you.<br>  Step2<br>  If you need to tell him something important, don't do it when he's been drinking. You'll get frustrated when you have to repeat it, or when something that should have been done, doesn't get done. And depending on your dad's type...he might get angry that you didn't tell him at a more appropriate time.<br>  Step3<br>  Follow Dad's rules when he's at his worst. Intentionally firing your dad up is useless and hazardous when he's been drinking.<br>  Step4<br>  If you're capable...run his "Daddy Errands" You may think that it is stupid and lazy for him to ask you to do petty things for him, especially when he could stop drinking and do them himself....but again, firing a drunk dad up should be avoided when possible.<br>  Step5<br>  Don't be ashamed. It is in no way your fault that your dad drinks. It is no one's fault, so don't be ashamed.<br>  Step6<br>  Talk with your friends or someone close to you about it. Keep them as updated as you're comfortable with. That way, when something HUGE happens that really really stresses you out. You can just go to that friend without having to catch them up with the entire story line leading up to the event.<br>  Tips & Warnings<br>  <br>      * Talking with other people really is the best thing you can do. Even if they havn't been through it at all, you'll feel so much better knowing that someone understands what you're going through.<br>      * No two alcoholics are the same! If this information sounds like it would cause issues, or that it wouldn't help you, disregard it and I am sorry.<br>      * If you are dealing with any abuse physical, emotional, or other, it should be handled by professionals. Never be afraid to let people know. They're on your side.|`|24bdcdc34da2c3f37a8684801cf27971aa	IM me.<br>  i'll do the best i can to help you<br>  <br>  csjeffrey|`|4qiiuv6Xaa	As bad as life might be you can't kill yourself. You can make new friends and you're probably just in a fight with your best friend not done being friends. I have to tell you that I have heard stories that are worse from people at my church and they said that when they started going to church life became bearable and made dozens of friends. Your dad is probably just stressed out by what is happening with the economy and just is getting drunk as an escape. Start going to church and maybe your dad will follow and stop getting drunk. I think you're just going through some high school drama. You should feel better tomorrow.|`|DLuDg2vyaa	I know how stupid this sounds, but i really know how you are feeling.<br>  <br>  Im 15 aswell, and my friends left me 6 months ago, well they scarred me for life so to speak.

Its truly amazing what she did for me, and i owe her my life.<br>  <br>  All i can offer is my ears, i will listen to you. You may feel like no one knows what you are going through, and youre right, they dont, but my situation is similar to yours, so i guess i can relate to you, and i wont be totally naive to it.<br>  <br>  I really feel for you, just please look on the bright side, you'll be able to see it soon.<br>  <br>  XX <br>  <br>  oh and making a journal might help you let out things that have been bubbling in your head.|`|qTRbXleUaa	I am right with you.

I almost killed myself when I was smaller, and now, I have just learned one thing. Be postive. If you keep saying that you're life sucks, it will more. Trust me, I've had experience. If you keep your head up and say 'WHO CARES ABOUT THEM? I CAN BE MY OWN PERSON! ' it helps so much!!!!!! try writing things about people who you are mad at on a peice of paper, and get it as mean as you want. But, never give it to the perosn. That gets your madness out, but noone knows. Just make new friends, and don't worry. iDont gnore your parents, talk to them and tell them how important it is for you to have a healthy life with family love until they learn how to be good parents. Call kids help phone, they will give you advice. It helped me. Also, just sleep in your bed when you have nothing else to do. Pray, just pray for a new day tomorrow.

Even though things might seem really terrible now, there will always be a time when they will get better. I like to think of things in this way when I feel like giving up, this week has been hard, but will tomorrow be? I don't know... or will it be in 5 years? Who knows! The only way to find out is to live through it. And you might be really surprised to find that tomorrow might be completely better. Or maybe it will only be like 2 percent better, but it will be better. Try to take your mind away from things that upset you and try to make yourself laugh. Look up funny things on youtube or watch your favorite movie or TV show. Try to find the things you like that will up lift you and motive you to be a better person. Leave all those things that push you down out of your mind! I hope this helps!|`|NPMKqJlMaa	im same as you... learn to let go these issues ..thats what made me happy.. and about my friends all happy and parties i do get a lil sad but deep in my heart i also get happy for them... but i'm also happy for myself too.. that im wont b drunk at the parties doing all nasty things ...and im happy cos i dont care about anything|`|FNdsPNrJaa	Sweetheart the best thing I can say to you is: It wont last forever. I promise. I know it seems like it will but it won't. If you have to just leave and go outside somewhere. Find a walmart or something and just stay there a few hours and forget about everything thats going on. I know life can be hard but I dont think you can honestly say you know you will feel this way forever. Also you really need to talk to someone. Please find someone to help you. Even if its only the suicide hotline...I know it will make you feel better. Please dont do anything drastic. Take some time to make plans about what you want to do in life. That always helped me.|`|HNPQDETeaa	Hey don't get so down. There's a lot of people in much worse situations and most of them get through it :) myself included. But I've found that these scenarios have made me understand myself much more and I've done a lot of soul searching. My father was a drunk too. Everyday he'd abuse my mother or start arguments with me. I realized that I was losing all my friends and that I had to act fake to even try and fit in (which didn't work out too well). Things always get better, its honestly true. Just have a talk with whichever friends you feel you can confide yourself to. I'm sure it would be a great way of rekindling your friendship. It worked for me. As for your father, don't expect him to just get better. I kept telling myself that what people say isn't true, that he can get better if I just keep telling him to stop or how I feel. Yes, it is true that it is important, however you should tell your mother to tell your family physician to see your father and set up a rehab plan. Its very simple and it should take a load of both you and your mother. For about a week physicians have been coming home for about two hours to treat my father, after that he had began going to anger management classes. Don't ever lose hope and I'm sure telling a friend will not jsut rekindle your friendship but make you feel a lot better. Just have faith :)<br>  <br>  PS. something I like to always tell myself (which through experience I've found to be very true) No rain, No rainbow|`|67NqWxuGaa	Oh man, you are just going thru a rough period that will change if you wait it out......<br>  while you wait seriously, go to a free site at www.emofree.com and learn and apply the technique... it works...<br>  I hope you feel better soon,   find people you trust to talk to, or talk to a trustworthy therapist, school counselor, or someone at church....<br>  You are loved,|`|P6qKmhihaa	hey sweetie take time for a minute, i understand about your dad mine was the same but it took me a life time to learn to love myself there are support groups for family  and  friends of the alcholic  go to your family doctor and tell him or her what is happening it is a horrible feeling for you and i would suggest you take these steps it is going to be very hard but you will come through   al-anon for alateens the doctor will give you the number you can not  do this without support try and look at what you have is good today and not on what is not so good stay   in  touch and have a good day|`|bInF0Rhqaa	Slamming doors and being angry is not the answer.  I bet your Dad is just as much in need of a big hug as you are.  Instead of being upset all the time, do things that create happiness.  Smile, be nice, go give Dad a hug.  <br>  <br>  It is possible you feel like you're losing everyone because you're upset all the time.  It's not necessarily that they don't like you, but that they want to have fun instead of be around drama.  They probably don't even realize how bad you feel.  <br>  <br>  For tonight, just remember that in life, the bad times do not last forever.  Sure, sometimes it feels like it...but you will get through it.  If you can teach yourself how to be happy when everything around you is falling apart, you will find yourself a very happy and successful adult one day.<br>  A good place for you to start would be your school guidance counselor.  They live for moments when they are able to help people like you.|`|oDLdqrJfaa	You want to go to parties???..............man if i ever become a Politician im going to try to get a society that rewards good parenting.

I think you have ever right and reason to feel and think the way you do right now and what your dealing with sucks and it's a freaking lot to deal with. Stop and take some times to think about what all is going on with you and tie those things into how you feel like you did above only this time parent yourself, coach yourself, be a friend to you and say, F ya! who wouldn't want to slam door and scream at dad and who would want to get the F out of here and woudl the H would be in their room crying and feeling the way I do, alone, lonely...

cfChW4fKaa	As someone who works for a major pharmaceutical company researching the effects of cocaine and other illegal drugs on the body and brain. I believe the answer has much to do with the molecular structure of the cold virus and that of cocaine. Although they are similar they are differing enough to produce different effects normally. However, when the brains opiate (cocaine) receptors have been exposed to the drug in a small percentage of cases they respond to the cold virus in a manner resembling their response to cocaine. It usually takes 4 -5 years for the cocaine receptors to re-adjust. The best idea is to simply be calm.<br>  <br>  However, recent studies have shown that nasal inhalation of pixie stick powder (yes, pixie stick powder) tricks your brain into "re-booting" itself, much like a computer after experiencing a trojan horse virus. However, this has only been shown to work in 37% of cases.|`|wPnKSXhlaa	It might just be the normal flu.

SqQ2FD7Gaa	It can for several reasons. <br>  <br>  The first is that sugar can affect people differently. Personally it makes me so tired I have trouble getting out of bed. There are high levels if caffeine in chocolate and you could be having a withdrawal once you stopped or perhaps it is more caffeine that your body can handle in large hits. Caffeine is also a diuretic and so can leave you dehydrated without you realising it. There isn't much you can do without taking some form of painkiller but it should stop after a couple of days at the most. Drinking plenty of water will help your kidneys flush any toxins from your body. Lastly it could be that you are allergic to chocolate. I was allergic to chocolate all my life until the last 18 months and it suddenly stopped, so you never know what your body might suddenly develop an allergic reaction to.<br>  <br>  My allergy lasted for over 35 yrs so it suddenly disappearing was unusual. If none of these things are the problem and the headaches persist you must see a doctor to rule out other causes. Also take into consideration other circumstances such as stress that might be adding to the problem, thus it may just be temporary.|`|KhmiBbBVaa	i don't really know but i heard can have a with draw from it|`|xZG0q6vXaa	Its called a sugar rush<br>  <br>  stop the sugar, relax, turn down noises of tv / music / even phone <br>  <br>  you'll survive it|`|QI1LasIUaa	Sugar and Sugar induced products when ingested do eat Oxygen and produce CO2 which goes into the blood stream.  <br>  The Human brain, when it lacks Oxygen and has CO2 blood stream induced to it, will cause a headache.<br>  It is the human body of chem.<br>  To relieve a headache, the best method is ICE Packs on the forehead and eyes, laying down, and Deep Breathe's.

In this case, try an antibacterial surgical scrub, sold over the counter in most pharmacies. Ask your pharmacist where to find them.<br>  <br>  Scrub-a-dub-dub. The most basic way to hold body odor at bay is to scrub yourself with soap and water, particularly in those areas of the body that are most likely to smell, such as the armpits and groin<br>  <br>  Body odor is most often caused by a combination of perspiration and bacteria, he says. Scrubbing with soap and water will wash both culprits away.<br>  <br>  The best type of soap for a body odor problem is a deodorant soap because it will hinder the return of bacteria. How often you need to scrub will depend on your individual body chemistry, your activities, your mood, and the time of year. If you're not sure if you're washing enough—ask a friend. Remember that perspiration glands and bacteria both work night as well as day shifts, which could mean you need to shower both morning and night.<br>  <br>  OR Try the old dog trick.

Your brain is nearly exposed to the air right behind your nose.  The amygdala of the brain, associated with very strong emotional memories is connected directly to the olfactory cortex.  So it is not only abnormal.. it is true of every human being on earth who has a sense of smell.

iAv9P3HTaa	A "quick" way to get abs is in the combination of diet and exercises.<br>  It depends on body fat with males it starts showing under 10%.<br>  These exercises much more effective then push ups or sit ups:<br>  <br>  <br>  Ball Crunch<br>  Lie with the ball resting under the mid/lower back and place hands behind the head or across the chest. Contract your abs to lift your the torso off the ball, pulling the bottom of your ribcage down toward your hips. As you curl up, keep the ball stable.<br>  <br>  <br>  Crunch & Reach<br>  Begin with body straight over the ball, light weight extended behind you (not shown). Contract the abs to lift and bring the weight over the head, crunching up and twisting to the right, contracting the right side of waist. Repeat for all reps and then switch sides.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Modified Plank<br>  Begin by placing elbows on the floor and resting body on the knees. Pull the abs tight to hold your body in a straight line from head to knees without sagging in the middle, eyes looking naturally forward. Hold this position for as long as you can, relax and repeat 3 or more times.<br>  <br>  <br>  Knee Tucks<br>  Start in plank position on the ball, with the ball under the shins/ankles. Roll the ball towards you with your feet, tightening the abs into a crunch.<br>  <br>  <br>  Woodchops<br>  Attach one end of a resistance band to something sturdy and wrap the band around your hand a few times for the right tension. Grasp the band in both hands and begin in a lunge position, reaching down with the arms Keeping the arms straight the entire time, rotate and lift the body towards the other side while sweeping the arms on a diagonal. Return to start and repeat before moving onto the other side.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hip Extension on the Ball<br>  Lie on the floor with feet heels propped on ball. Keeping abs tight, slowly lift your hips off the floor (squeezing the buttocks) until body is in a straight line. Hold for a few seconds and lower<br>  <br>  <br>  Ball Taps<br>  Sit on the ball with strong abs and straight spine, hands behind the head. Contract your abs and lift the right foot, tapping it on a medicine ball in front of you. Lower and repeat with the other foot, alternating sides. Use your abs to keep your balance.<br>  <br>  How to Work Your Abs<br>  <br>  * You can effectively work your abs with 3 non-consecutive workouts a week<br>  * Do 1-3 sets of 12-16 reps of each exercise. If that's too easy, make sure you're doing each exercise correctly and using perfect form. You can add a dumbbell or plate to crunches to add difficulty.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|RSUYs8Mzaa	Something I found is that holding your legs differently while you do crunches affects where you'll feel the burn. Try doing crunches with your legs flat on the floor and with them bent like this: <> with your feet kind of touching. You'll find what you're looking for.

bInF0Rhqaa	Did you tell your doctor?  Drugs can change how your body acts, and many have effects that last well after you are off the drug.  I had a doctor give me a prescription for Zoloft.  It was like a living hell, and I had odd symptoms for months after I stopped taking it.  For most people, any symptoms go away after a few weeks but can certainly last longer.  Many times, it is because these drugs cause mild (usually temporary) liver damage, and you will not feel 100% better until your liver repairs itself.  The best thing for you to do is talk to your doctor.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Did you quit the Paxil correctly? You know you can't just stop taking that cold turkey. You have to come of it gradually by reducing the dose, under the supervision of the doctor.<br>  <br>  I tried quitting it that way even though I knew I wasn't supposed to. I started having the feeling of electrical shocks going through my brain, and I was really really confused. I had to start taking it again, and then wean off it the correct way.<br>  <br>  If you didn't do it correctly, you need to go back to the doctor. Even if you did quit it correctly, with these symptoms you are having you should probably go back.|`|XG48COcKaa	what is paxi|`|cku5S9WLaa	I used to take Paxil several years ago. When I got on them I had side effects which lasted for at least 3 weeks. Then they went away. But I noticed that every morning before I took the pills everything looked shaky. I can't explain it. I came off them after 6 months on my own as I hated them. I know this was the wrong way to do it. And I too had withdrawal symptoms such as shivering. It lasted for a few weeks and trust me it will go away!! I am never going on any anti-depressant again. Try St Johns Wort. Its herbal and the side effects are barely noticable.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	Wow I am glad that you said this because I took Paxil for years and I came off of it COLD TURKEY and the not knowing what you are doing like you are there but not there, yes it is terrible.  Actually it only took me about two weeks to start feeling better though.  You might want to talk to your doctor.|`|67NqWxuGaa	What in the world?????   You should not feel this way, there is something wrong and you should see a doctor right away....  <br>  also , have them check your thyroid, adrenals, hormones....|`|KExssBP4aa	hummm paxil worked okay for me but i guess everyone is differenet, i suggest seeing your doctor and trying something else
jIk2ttH1aa	Did she really say that, because that is a very irresponsible statement, especially coming from a doctor!<br>  <br>  Your sex drive, is what it is.  There is no "one formula" , as everybody's body chemistry is different.  <br>  <br>  With 2 kids you are probably exhausted or feel more Mommyish than get down with my man-ish.<br>  What men need to understand that sex starts for woman waaaaaaaay before they get into the bedroom.  So your man needs to seduce your mind and spirit before your body is going to follow.  Have him help out with daily stuff, lighten y our load.  Tell him to TELL YOU when he is thinking nice things about you (and not talking with his unit)  Try ROMANCE and COMMUNICATION and slower foreplay.  Maybe get a babysitter for the night and go to a hotel.  Do something that will get you out of your Mom role and into the sex goddess you are!<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|xyrSl2nSaa	i think you need to see a different doctor... if you force yourself into having sex then you will never want to do it. Tell your man to try harder to get you in the mood and/or buy some toys!|`|Fgz5xWxOaa	its not right<br>  <br>  you do have a very low sex drive, but "forcing" sex will just make you hate it and want it less.  Maybe you just need to try new techniques to bring back the excitement.  Also if you are on any meds, it could be the issues.  And for some moms, they are just too tired to want sex.  Maybe find a sitter foir the kids for a weekend and go do something romantic.|`|1BbnyTfBaa	Spend  time having sexual fantasies about your significant other.  Imagine things you could do together in graphic detail.  When you get the chance, act out your fantasies.  I think if you do this for a while, you will  begin to look  forward  to having  sex.|`|9XjtEdEqaa	tell your husband that you love him but dont want to do it as often. women dont reach their sexual peak until their 30's so you are fine. guys get theirs in their 20's so thats why he's like that.|`|brSfRLspaa	get one of your horny single girlfriends to stand in as surrogate
Mumfvpuzaa	i had a breast reduction in oct 2008 which was 100% covered by my insruance.  however it took me 5 years and 3 insurances to finally be covered because the first 2 told me i wasn't big enough to qualify.  every insurance have different criteria.  the only way to know for sure if to make a consulation with a plastic surgeon and have the paperwork and pictures submitted to the insurance.  i went from a 32DDD/E to a 32C and this was the best decision i ever made.

The only danger would be if the mother's MS was so progressive that she might not be able to properly care for a child.|`|w6VwKcusaa	Yes they can have children. however one thing the mother needs to realize is that they have to monitor her medications during pregnancy, and she will most likely not b allowed to breastfeed due to the meds.

cm4oW9lZaa	*  Brings blood to the capillaries, therefore increasing circulation throughout the body.<br>      * Cleans the circulatory system.<br>      * Reduces blood pressure on internal organs.<br>      * Provides flushing for the organs and provides a new supply of blood.<br>      * Strengthens the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems.<br>      * Contracts the muscles to eliminate toxins and poisonous wastes.<br>      * Strengthens the mucous membranes, which help resist hay fever, allergies, colds, coughs.<br>  <br>  And here are 4 reasons you need to take a cold bath:<br>  <br>  1- Better Circulation<br>  Warm water makes the blood rush to your skin, and cool water makes the blood rush to your organs. This switching between hot and cold triggers better circulation in your blood by forcing the blood to move. The ideal practice would be to switch numerous times between hot and cold water, but merely ending the shower with cold water does help with circulation. Why should you worry about having good circulation? Well, it prevents such problems as hypertension, hardening of the arteries, and the appearance of varicose veins. Good circulation improves the performance of your system and thus help looking and feeling better.<br>  <br>  2- Better looking skin<br>  When you shower with warm water, it opens up your pores. Then you wash and this cleans up your pores. That’s all good. When you end, it would be best to close your pores and cold water does just that. It’s good to close your pores after you are all cleaned up because it will prevent the pores from being easily clogged by dirt and oil, which causes skin imperfections such as acne for example. Another benefit is that cold water makes your blood vessels constrict which reduces swelling and the appearance of dark circles under your eyes (where skin is at its thinnest). This provides you with a young, healthy glow.<br>  <br>  3- Healthier hair<br>  Cold water makes your hair look healthier and shinier. As a matter of fact, cool air makes your hair shinier too (that’s why there is a cool air button on your hair dryer). What the cold water does is that it closes the cuticle which makes the hair stronger and prevents dirt from easily accumulating within your scalp. Basically, the same principle with how it closes the pores of your skin as mentioned above. Stronger hair, of course, prevents hair from being easily pulled out when you are combing, and it helps in slowing down overall hair loss.<br>  <br>  4- Mental benefits<br>  There are plenty of mental benefits to ending your shower with cold water. The ancient samurai warriors used to pour buckets of cold river water on their heads every morning in a Shinto practice called Misogi. This was a purification ritual on a spiritual level. They believe that it cleansed their spirit and helped start a new day & new adventure fresh. Cold water obviously helps waking you up, which is what you want in the morning. Also, it energizes you and invigorates your entire being with the essence of life. Give it a try, you will definitely feel more alive! It can also lift you up if you are feeling a little down or unmotivated.|`|CYuSyL3vaa	Cold water makes your hair really shiny.|`|C3UqDW1Faa	When im really sore i take a shower.<br>  it relaxes your muscles and it magicaly makes them not be sore O:<br>  weird..|`|165absrmaa	I'm sure it'd be refreshing, but the steam from the hot water OPENS your pores, fyi.<br>  :P|`|61Z4RuSRaa	If your a girl it keeps your breasts firm as the hot water can apparently make them sag after hot baths and showers.

Lots of folks who look very young for thier age attribute it to a cold splash every morning, and there is some scientific evidence for it. <br>  <br>  If you want them to be refreshing, take your shower, then make the water cool for 30 seconds or so....thats all it takes.|`|e44b5ee6cee3f3f6ca0a4ca6d4ecfba3aa	Only on really hot days, when you've been outside for a long amount of time and you're all sweaty and sticky and gross.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, no.

RvddYKqjaa	You had the asparagus only one time? That wouldn't last longer than a day. I suppose you will have to consider a UTI. It's odd though, since you drink so much water. Keep drinking, no matter what it ends up being.|`|cm4oW9lZaa	If you're drinking sport water I would guess you exercise some to a lot. Ture? If so, you could still be concentrating your urine despite thinking you are drinking enough.<br>  <br>  Many foods and medications — such as asparagus or certain vitamins — also can affect the odor of urine.<br>  <br>  If your urine doesn't return to normal (less oderous) within a week or after stopping vigerous exercise, you might consider seeing a doctor.<br>  <br>  I think if you drink more water, the problem will resolve itself.|`|ptTZMe0Oaa	it's probably the UTI.. but you might also have a yeast infection or bladder infection|`|bur1SgLSaa	Are you a coffee drinker?

AA10554882	I'm not too sure why you needed to ask this question, it sounds like you are really on top of your body and your health.<br>  <br>  The fact that the twinges switched sides and are often paired with cm are a good indicator that you are experiencing ovulation pain.<br>  <br>  Changes in your lifestyle can easily change your ovulation timing, though stress would normally cause it to happen later than earlier I think. Who knows, it's so difficult to exactly pinpoint it, so unless you're trying to get pregnant I wouldn't worry too much if I were you.<br>  Remember, however, that there is always the possibility that you will ovulate twice this month. <br>  <br>  All the best.

PRzmwFfgaa	The thing with eating seafood and allergies is that you have to find out exactly where the seafood came from.  I found this out because I too occasionally enjoy seafood but sometimes it makes my tongue, lips, and throat itch after eating it while other times I am perfectly fine.  Things like crab, lobsters, and certain fish are bottom feeders.  That means they could really literally be eating anything.  A lot of people have allergies to seafood, not because of the seafood that they are eating, but because of what that seafood ate.  I found that I do not have allergic reactions to farm raised seafood but do sometimes have reactions to wild seafood.  This is because when it is farm raised, they have control over what the seafood is eating.  Hope this helps some.|`|qO2slhk4aa	I am allergic to clams and that's how my body reacts.|`|aKvxy3xBaa	My husband and I just went to Red Lobster today for lunch and I had the flounder and had the same thing happen to me.

Try something different next time.Good Luck !!|`|uKyfRzxIaa	I think you're probably allergic. At our school, All A's people get to go off campus for lunch and it is all paid for, but we can't go to seafood places because this one girl is allergic and gets cramps. (coincidence?!) I don't really understand how you can be allergic to seafood, because it's all different.

nYJEWLAlaa	there are a lot of factors that can lead to you not being able to sleep well. since your problem recently started, u should consider the reasons that might be affecting you. <br>  are you stressed?  do you have any problems that you are currently dealing with? what type of food are you eating or drinking just before going to bed? is your bed comfortable? <br>  then again it may just be a phase.<br>  you should think about the factors i mentioned.<br>  and go to the doctor if ur still having this problem.|`|pS3lVOUyaa	Are you stressed about anything, because if so, your mind could be buzzing around the clock and this could be a cause of your insomnia. If so, you should speak to somebody you trust about the problem and get it sorted out. There are many herbal remedies that are available without a prescription. I used one when I was stressed, called 'Nodoff' and it comes in a yellow and blue bottle. It smells, but it relaxes you and sends you to sleep easily. You should cut out caffeine and sugar before bed, and try bathing in essential oils, as these again relax you. You should also check whether it is your bed that is the problem. If it is uncomfortable you should get it sorted out. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and that you find a cure!! :D|`|cm4oW9lZaa	Don't have too much caffeine, and it can be because you don't sleep how your suppose to. I am guessing you sometimes sleep out of zone, by that I mean in the day, that doesn't give you the ability to go to sleep at night.<br>  <br>  Turn off your lights and T.V, that is just a recommendation, usually they attract attention.<br>  <br>  Just close your eyes and pretend your day dreaming and in no time you'll fall asleep.|`|xDH6yjiMaa	you should just close your eyes and face the wall intill you are asleep it works for me and you should tell your parnets thes a chance you might have sleep apneia its a sleeping diorder i had that when i was like 11 and i had my tonsils removed and now i can sleep better! remeber :TELL YOUR PARNETS!!|`|95Hw7cHKaa	Try drinking warm milk before you go to bed. Don't drink caffeine; Whether it be tea OR coffee. When you do go to bed you have to let go of everything in your mind. By thinking you're making your brain work and that stops you fromm falling asleep. Try to tire yourself out through the day by walking home from schoo or something. Good luck!|`|sQu3LLqtaa	Besides warm milk you can find other remedies in web searches for "natural sleep aids" and "natural sleep remedies".
naPq2mbtaa	Zit Prevention Plan<br>  <br>  Preventing zits...Steps to stop the eruptions<br>  <br>  Here are some tips on reducing and preventing zits. But remember, even if you practice good hygiene and have healthy eating habits, chances are you'll break out at some point. It's normal.<br>  <br>  1. Wash<br>  <br>  Wash your skin morning and night with a gentle cleanser that cleans your pores without drying your skin (don't use grainy, harsh scrubs since these can actually cause acne). i recommend you use neutragena pink grape fruit oil free acne wash.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. T-zone<br>  <br>  Some areas of your face, like your forehead, nose, and chin (often called the T-zone because it's shaped like the letter T) might be oilier than the rest of your face. So treat it differently: wash it with a non-oily cleanser.<br>  3. Water<br>  <br>  Drink a lot of water. It helps flush away impurities.<br>  4. Foods<br>  <br>  Although foods cannot cause zits, some people find that what they eat affects their skin. So say hello to healthy food, like fresh fruit and veggie snacks and see-you-later to chocolate and greasy foods like french fries and buttered popcorn. If you think you get zits after eating certain foods, keep a list and avoid eating too much of them or eating them at all.<br>  5. Relax!<br>  Anxiety and stress can cause the adrenal glands to make more hormones, which can cause zits to suddenly pop up. You have a lot going on in your life, but try to take time out for a walk or yoga or whatever works for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ********* PRODUCT FOR ACNE GOING AWAY FAST***********<br>  also i recommend you buy a bottle of tea tree oil [it works trust me there was a big improvement in my acne the the first time i used it. you can buy it at CVS or Wal Mart or Walgreens. you put it on a cotton ball or cotton pad and put a thin layer of it on your face. (you may feel a tingling sensation on your face for up to a minute or half a minute [first couple times] ) and it's cheaper than spending $30.00 plus shipping and handling on proactive<br>  TRUST ME IT WORKS!!!<br>  Good Luck I Hoped This Helped!!!!!!!|`|5M0FBU89aa	My wife is 48 and still breaks out-  so getting older may not help (I guess depending on the person).|`|OIRI5Ok7aa	Me, too!  I have the same problem.  It has to do with hormone changes during that time.  I take extra good care of my skin around that time and avoid greasy foods.  Also, if it's really bad, you could look into birth control.  There are types of birth control that are supposed to control acne, too.|`|hce2FY9Waa	There really isn't a whole lot you can do since it is hormonal related.

RvddYKqjaa	I don't know national statistics, but a mother we know had eight kids in her family, and four or them ended up being diabetic. That would seem to be 50 percent, but that might not be the case based on all people. People are learning how to avoid diabetes now, by exercising more and eating better foods.<br>  EDIT: In this case I am talking about Type 1 which the parent had, and Type 2 which the kids have. I assumed that genetic meant it was carried within a family. Sorry if I gave you unnecessary information. In general, I do think many people are caring for their diabetes with exercise and better eating, which in all honesty, can't hurt anyone.|`|MtzDCkgFaa	Since you're talking about genetic diabetes, I know you're talking about type 1. Which CAN'T be prevented with exercise and a healthy diet, that would be type 2. I'm not sure what the % is of the parent passing on this type to their offspring, but I do know that my father is a diabetic and my mother is not. And I got type 1 diabetes at the age of 2, and my brother who is 14 does not have it.
Qu7GIg6Haa	no, teeth do not knit back together like bone does. the filling will have to be replaced or the tooth reconstructed with a cap or other artificial filler.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	i dont think so<br>  usually they have to be redone i think|`|AA12034666	Nope. Enamel can't grow back. You have to have another filling put in place.|`|ziZQWxi3aa	god how I wish that were true, if that was the case, than why would we need fillings? if the bone was just going to grow back by itself.  If you don't get it refilled asap, you will probably end up getting a root canal and a crown!  So get er done!|`|5I01tsgYaa	I don't believe so.

NhF9sM5jaa	I agree with Jupiter. It definetly sounds allergy related. Your best advice would be to see a dermatologist or allergist<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  try avoided her bathing in scented soaps and use fragrance free laundry detergent in the meantime|`|rtrdOcTcaa	It sounds exactly like the eczema rashes I get, the bright red rashes at least.  They'll get worse if she scratches them.<br>  <br>  As for the cause, I'm not exactly sure.  Mine were caused by gluten and dairy sensitivities - I could eat some, but if I ate too much, I'd get eczema on the insides of my elbows and the backs of my knees.  You could try reducing the amount of gluten (wheat, rye, barley, spelt, kamut) and dairy in her diet; see if that helps.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your daughter's rashes!  If she forgets about them they'll fade more quickly because her mind won't constantly be telling her that they itch, so she won't scratch them.  I know it's hard for an eight-year-old - sometimes I scratched so much that they stretched from the middles of my upper arms almost to my wrists - but it's worth a try.|`|hfodUPg9aa	She could be allergic to something.

dsBCGbWpaa	Yes, your dreams can represent your secret hopes and desires that are stored in your subconcious. You should look into Jungian psychology because it will help explain the archetypes you have in your dreams. If you post a detailed description of your dream in the "Dream Interpretation" category on here you will get many responses and help about interpretting what your dream really means. Just because you have a repetitive dream of someone dying doesn't mean that person will be dying anytime soon, it could represent an archetype as yourself.<br>  <br>  You also have two different types of conciousness. One of them is your subconcious which is hidden and it is where the real you is stored (your persona is just your mask that you show to the world) and then there is something else (I don't remember the name, sorry) that will sometimes make you dream about whatever happened in the day. Sometimes dreams can be your subconcious trying to tell you a message, and other times it's just a replay of what went on in your day. Best of luck!|`|U2FBDStxaa	Some people believe so. I have no clue how to interpret dreams but i do know that movies and books can affect your dreams. When i read the Twilight series, i had dreams about Jacob Black.|`|51Pem1ozaa	i had a few dreams about dying myself ,but obviously I'm still alive. When i dreamed death it wasn't me it was others that i knew.|`|UXytkRNfaa	some people believe so|`|AA11054116	I think that dreams sort out recent events in your days.<br>  For example:  Last night I dreamt  (dreamed?) that I saw a big wave with a head bobbing on the top of it.  Guess what?  That day I had had a walk by the Mersey where there are Iron Men positioned on the beach. The sea was rough with huge waves crashing on the shore.  One of the waves was almost covering one of the men, just the head showing.<br>  So, my dream was just an interpretation of what I had seen that day.<br>  (In case you live in America, the statues on the beach are by Anthony Gormley.)|`|cGnIZ7kfaa	um i think it depends on each person.<br>  reading and watching tv gets into dreams cos the brain spends lots of time on it.<br>  i dream about what i read. i dreamt about my book i have to read for school!<br>  it depends how you interpret your dream, its really up to you. i had a recurring dream my teeth kept falling out, and when i went to the dentist for a checkup, there were lots of issues i now need fixed that i couldnt see before!<br>  and i once had a dream that one of my friends was following me around crying and upset all the time, and then i realised in waking life that i wasnt giving them the attention a friend should<br>  the subconcious picks up on things that the rest of the brain chooses to ignore.<br>  dont freak out about death dreams. death has so much emotion and romance put into it by all cultures around the globe.<br>  its all images and perceptions, we have painted it too many colours we dont even know what it is anymore!<br>  try control your dreams, its fun!|`|Voj4DPIaaa	well it happens to people like they predict stuff in the future trew dreams day dreams and even trew out the day sum people start writing out of no where and predict stuff its like maybe an ability u can look up on alot of people have it but its a gift dont worry i have the thing when im out in the day and i get like little flash memories of people its weird stopped happening for a week now dont worry

b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	Sleep aid tablets are bad for you because your body comes to rely upon them like a crutch, your body doesn't know it's time to sleep until it feels those chemicals creep into your system. Tolerance builds rapidly and you have to take more and more of them for the chemical to take effect so yes that would be very bad for you to take two or three.<br>  <br>  Check out melatonin, it's what the body naturally uses to do what you're using chemicals for, it's called the hormone of darkness because it begins to be released when no light comes in your eyes. It also is a potent anti-oxidant, so if you get some of it then it will be more effective, better for you and cost less since it can't be patented (because it's all natural). Airline pilots use it to reset their body's clock naturally after changing time zones.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Source-Naturals-Melatonin-Release-Tablets/dp/B000GFPCRU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=hpc&qid=1235779635&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Source-Naturals-Me...</a><br>  <br>  13.99 for 240 tablets, and since you use one a night that is enough for 2/3 of a year and some of the companies are cheaper than this even, but this is the best because it's sustained release.

No need to go to the doctor unless the bleeding doesn't stop.|`|ggkpHpW0aa	i had this problem with an ex-boyfriend. turns out, he was hitting my cervix, causing irritation, bruising, and bleeding. if you weren't wet enough, it may be that your vagina wasn't prepared for him to enter, or it could have been the position. the next time you have a pelvic exam, ask the doctor to check for any abrasions. if so, the medical term for it is cervix-itis. to avoid it happening again, make sure the foreplay is enough for you to be self-lubricated and your cervix to contract for more room. if the problem is consistent, i suggest seeing a gynecologist. they will actually suggest better positions to use that will work for you.|`|EnYKNyPxaa	was proberly just abit of "after shock" from your period, or possibly a tear, nothing to worry about so just ignor it, it will go within a day. if it doesnt though go docs|`|hAy1Kehkaa	HE POPPED UR CHERRY DONT WORRY ABOUT IT AND DONT DO IT DURING UR PERIOD THAT WASNT THE SMARTEST THING TO DO U MUST OF HAD TO REALLY WANT TO DO IT|`|xH6PQRrmaa	you might want to get that checked out|`|4NiRJZkAaa	Go to the doctors !
wwRbkCMraa	Usually losing weight is simple numbers. You need to know your basic metabolic rate (BMR). Once you know your BMR then you can design a diet lower in calories than your BMR.<br>  <br>  But.... it is not always that simple. You could also have metabolic anomalies or even hormone irregularities that can make losing weight virtually impossible. <br>  <br>  Start with the simple stuff. Calculate your BMR right here <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calcul...</a>  then alter your diet if necessary.<br>  <br>  Now, if you don't see results after that you may look into the hormonal or metabolic areas. Also make sure you are being realistic, and that you do have weight to use. Don't forget... celebrities use tons of drugs and have personal trainers! We should all be so lucky 8)<br>  <br>  II have been doing the crossfit workouts and they have shredded my body big time (removed my body fat). They are pretty tough, but the results are quick!<br>  <br>  give them a try and see what you think. I usually do the WOD's<br>  <br>  <a href="http://crossfit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://crossfit.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/excercise.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/excercis...</a><br>  <br>  Also to tone muscle (obviously you want a little muscle tone which is very sexy when done right) make sure you are getting plenty of protein to aid in recovery and building of new muscle tissue<br>  <br>  Here is a link for protein<br>  <a href="http://www.buybulkwhey.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.buybulkwhey.com/</a>|`|IhGdhL3maa	probably not, protein shakes are usually high in carbs in sugar (not gnc types) and their for bulking up the muscle.<br>  <br>  if you want to loose fat and gain muscle then definetely protein shakes will help you.<br>  <br>  because while you lift weights, and do strength training you have to burn off energy in your system. Am i not right? you end up burning fat to make muscle, not turn fat into muscle.<br>  <br>  So if you wanna loose weight and build a little toned muscle then drink a little protein shakes otherwise just eat protein rich foods to help you|`|9y6KtgDraa	Im actually on atkins diet.. im loosing weight but and i drink 100% whey protein ON and yes im losing weight, but hey, just use it ifyou exercise otherwise the protein will not have effect on you.<br>  <br>  PD: The whey protein that i drink has only 3g of carbs and 1g of sugar, there are certain protein shake which has lots of sugars and carbs DONT TAKE THOSE.
DWIXEcalaa	Hi there, I had the same question....and I finally found the answer to it....<br>  <br>  If the atkins advantage Bar says  that it has only 3 net grams on top of the wrapper....and in the nutrition facts, if it says that it has 22 grams of carbs...then subtract the 22 grams of carb to the dietary fiber (10g), Sugar Alcohol (8g) and Glycerin (1g), which all have minimal impact on blood sugar...it will give you the answer..that means, you CAN have these..cuz it has a total of 3 carbs in it....so have fun eating those atkin bars!
dFHsAXDMaa	Most likely a boil ...which is a pimple with a deep core. uf you go to your family doctor they can get rid of it for you making sure the core is out so it does not grow back. if you leave it alone it will just grow bigger and become more painful take a quick trip to doctors painless they will squeeze it the right way and remove the core which is like a root.

fAFXkikAaa	No.  Herpes is not caused by the number of people you kiss.  Having herpes doesn't mean that you are promiscuious, or dirty, or sexually liberal.<br>  <br>  Regarding oral herpes, most people have it (50% to 80% of adults) and most people catch it in childhood from kissing relatives.  It is not an STD.  In fact, statistically, it is likely that both you and your friend have oral herpes.<br>  <br>  Genital herpes can be caught through oral sex with someone who has oral herpes, or through genital-to-genital contact with someone with genital herpes.   Most people with genital herpes don't realize that they have it, since most people don't have symptoms - even though they can go on to infect other people.   You can not catch genital herpes just by kissing someone on the lips.<br>  <br>  There is this myth that only people who "sleep around" get STDs, and that just isn't true.   It only takes one.<br>  <br>  Sorry to disappoint you.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	she can get herpes simplex 1 which is cold sores on her mouth, but not down below in her private unless she has sex with the guy and he has herpes simplex 2 on his privates<br>  <br>  edit:  dont share any of her lipsticks/glosses, don't drink from her sodas etc etc or you can get it, if you have done this already, go to vitamin store or cvs and buy the amino acid lysine, and take 1 or 2 a day for a month, it prevents outbreaks.|`|nF0Eaa2Gaa	Yes.

W4whHKmxaa	There are three different tests the doctors do<br>  to check the liver:<br>  (1) the liver enzymes (known as the ALT, AST,<br>  GGT, and Alkaline Phosphatase) usually show<br>  if the liver cells have become damaged.<br>  (2) the liver function tests (known as the <br>  bilirubin, INR, albumin) will show how the<br>  cells of the liver are functioning to keep the<br>  body well<br>  (3) Then there is the viral testing to see<br>  if you developed a virus like Hepatitis A,B,C,etc.<br>  <br>  There are many different causes of a liver<br>  problem: alcohol consumption, medication<br>  toxification, chemical exposure, hereditary<br>  disease, auto immune disease, biliary <br>  obstruction or mal formation, fatty liver disease,<br>  viral infections, metabolic disorders, and<br>  others.  <br>  <br>  Liver enzymes do tend to go into very high<br>  range if someone has contacted a virus.<br>  However, no one blood test is 100% accurate.<br>  More are usually done to be sure of the results.<br>  Also, blood tests are really just a hint that<br>  something is not right...a doctor cannot give<br>  a true diagnosis unless other testing is done.<br>  Some of the liver enzymes are not specific<br>  to the liver...some of these enzymes are found<br>  in other organs also...they just call them the<br>  liver enzymes because they use them the<br>  most to check the liver. <br>  <br>  Let me explain what happens in the liver:<br>  The cells can become stressed and even<br>  damaged because of any of the above causes.<br>  When this happens, the immune system <br>  responds to this and causes inflammation to<br>  develop in the liver.  The inflammation causes<br>  then the liver to enlarge in size.  At this point,<br>  if the cause can be removed and the <br>  inflammation is treated, the liver cells can<br>  heal and it can be reversed.  However, if<br>  this doesn't take place...it will proceed to<br>  the death of the liver cells and then this is<br>  a progressive disease known as Cirrhosis.<br>  <br>  The doctors usually start out with blood testing.<br>  They may check the right upper quadrant of<br>  your abdominal area, under the ribs, by placing their hand there and seeing if they can tell if the liver is enlarged in size. It it is enlarged, then<br>  they will either do a ultrasound, CT scan, or<br>  MRI to look at the liver.  Once they get the<br>  results of all the testing back...they may<br>  then decide if a liver biopsy is needed.  This<br>  checks the liver cells directly instead of just<br>  seeing on film.  They usually only do this<br>  as a last resort because it is an invasive procedure. <br>  <br>  Only the doctor can give you a true estimate<br>  of how fast the disease is progressing, what<br>  is the real cause, how much of the liver<br>  is involved and taking into account your<br>  other medical conditions...he would then<br>  inform you of how serious nature it is. <br>  <br>  I hope this information has helped you.|`|RTY5VahLaa	There are many reasons for liver enzymes to be elevated, so there is no telling anything.

GgClh7dbaa	I'm assuming from your story that you have no unexplained wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath or mucus production, and no history of childhood asthma or other respiratory diseases. If you do, you should have said so. Even if you do, you don't necessarily have asthma.<br>  <br>  Saying that you don't have the alllergic kind of asthma is strange. That's something that you would say to somebody who has asthma after you ruled out that it was not provoked by inhalants such as dust, spores, pollens, danders (fur), any of various chemicals such as medications, perfumes, smoke or choline. In such cases, the doctor would be suggesting that the trigger is exposure to cold, exercise, aspiration of gastric contents during sleep, or emotional stress. But I can't think of a reason to tell a healthy person who didn't have any respiratory history that they don't have the allergic kind of asthma, or why I would even know that but not know that the patient didn't have any kind of asthma.<br>  <br>  You definitely don't have exercise induced asthma if you did all that exercise without pre-medicating and without respiratory symptoms.<br>  <br>  If exposure to the cold, especially with exertion, causes you to wheeze or cough, you might have cold-induced asthma. But you would know this by now and mentioned it here if that were true, wouldn't you?<br>  <br>  There is no reason to think that you have asthma of any kind based on the information you have provided. Still, I am curious about a few things:<br>  <br>  [a] Was the inhaler an oral or nasal inhaler, does "gave me an inhaler" mean he/she named something that he/she wanted you to buy over the counter (if so, what?), or did he/she either hand you a sample of something or write you a prescription (if so, what)<br>  <br>  [b] Do you know why he/she did that? That would be unusual and improper if you had not given him/her a reason to think that you needed treatment based on something that you said, something that he heard or found examining you, or the abnormal results of some diagnostic test. We don't just prescribe inhalers to normal people in case they need them.<br>  <br>  [c] Did your doctor do a spirogram (ask you to take a deep inhalation and exhalation into a tube) or ask you to blow very hard into a tube (peak expiratory flow)? If so, do you know why, or what the results were?|`|VUqzx0zoaa	did you do the methacholine challenge test, if they see a 20% drop in lung funtion or more its asthma|`|AA12074512	if the doctor said you do no have asthma... how can people on the internet tell you that.. go see another doctor....
8asG4WCwaa	Since your hormone levels are off, an endocrinologist is the right doctor to see. They do not just treat diabetes, and many fertility clinics have endocrinologists who specialize in reproductive issues.  The endocrine system is very complex, and problems in one area can be caused by disorders in another one (for example, elevated androgen levels in women can be caused by problems with the ovaries, adrenal glands, thyroid, or even the pituitary).<br>  <br>  Once they determine a cause of the problem and/or supplement your hormone levels, they will discuss any potential fertility issues with you.  <br>  <br>  I know it doesn't help to tell you to relax until then, but stress definately doesn't help.|`|dJ2shbJIaa	What do endocrinologists do?<br>  Endocrinologists are trained to diagnose and treat hormone imbalances and problems by helping to restore the normal balance of hormones in your system.

AA11558459	Yes, I'm sure you bruised it.  You might have also bruised the bone.  Bones can be bruised, it's when the very tiny top layer of the bone gets chipped.  Its not actually a break or fracture in the bone, but it can hurt just as bad.  I had a bone bruise last summer and I had to take prescription pain killers and I missed a week of work.  My leg remains blue and sore where it happened to this day.  Athletes are often benched for bone bruises.  But, there is actually nothing you can do for them, they heal on their own.  So take some ibuprofen and if it doesn't start to feel better in a week or so, then see a doctor.|`|xZG0q6vXaa	You have not given enough time for the hurting to go away.  Keep ice on it for several more hours.  If by Monday you are still in pain go see a doctor or dentist; one will just send you to the other if he can't find out what the problem is.  The jaw may have gotten shifted slightly out of line, like what happens when you grind your teeth while sleeping; so make sure your teeth are separated when you go to sleep.|`|wyUhx5b6aa	Well, ya!

nqkXE1cUaa	1<br>  Choose your battles wisely. Breaking an obsession or ritual is like running a war campaign. If not planned wisely or if you attempt to fight on many fronts, you're guaranteed to fail. Not only is it time consuming and tiring, it means you can't devote 100% to each particular area. So, if you have a child with a game obsession, a phobia of baths and bedtime troubles, choose only one to deal with. Personally, and I have had that choice, I dealt with the bedtime troubles. Using logic, a sleep deprived child certainly isn't going to deal with behavioural modification in other areas well. Plus, it was having an effect on his overall health. Deal with the worst first!<br>  Step2<br>  When tackling any problem with any child, Aspergers or not, it's always best to remain calm at all times. Children can feed off your anger, frustration and anxiety, so keeping a level head at all times is essential. If you feel a situation is escalating and elevating your blood pressure, take a step back and collect yourself.<br>  Step3<br>  When breaking an obsession or ritual, examine the ways that you may have fed into this. With my son's bedtime activities, I found I was too tired to fight his waking up at 2am. While dealing with this ritual, I ensured I was in bed early myself so I had enough sleep in me to knock his night owl tendencies on the head.<br>  Step4<br>  Communicate with your child to explain the effect that his or her ritual is having on your family as a whole. My son's 2am wakeup calls were affecting me mentally, emotionally and physically, and I told him so. I pulled some research off the internet about sleep needs and discussed this with him.<br>  Step5<br>  Be prepared for resistance by arming yourself with suggestions and alternatives to your child's behaviour. A great way of doing this is by creating a "social story". Carol Gray's Social Stories site is a great resource for parents and educators alike to create books which will modify behaviour in children with autistic spectrum disorders.<br>  Step6<br>  Speak to professionals for advice. Contact your paediatrician for recommendations for behaviour therapists.

This is a difficult decision for parents and schools to make, because the child may be able to keep up with everyone in school, they can't seem to keep up emotionally. Autism is a malfunction of the brain where social interactions are warped for the child. A low functioning child wouldn't even react to you, they would remain in their own little world. This child apparently has been put in with your class with the hopes that she will gradually learn to adapt to the situations she will confront in life. Sadly, I believe she should be in a special class with other autistic children, because socially, she becomes violent. That would be the only concern. Now, if she doesn't actually incite violence, then the other things are just a hurdle for the other children to try and adapt to. Try to be nice, but not overly close to her if you don't like her actions. Be nice and ignore her own stories of herself. She hasn't got control over many of her actions. Try to remember that. Talk with the teacher if you want to understand more of her actions. Read up on her particular mental illness. Try not to make her stand out more than she already does. Good luck.|`|qKGbvKe6aa	Until you get to really know and "be in her shoes" its not good to "blame" her for something that can't be controlled by her. that's why she is mentally handicapped because she cant control it.<br>  I personally know how frustrating and annoying it may be for you and others but really you shouls TRY to have some compassion and DONT take it personal. If possible stay away and keep away.<br>  Just so you know, is someone were to "snap" and hurt her, that would be the worst mistake ever because like i said she CANT control it.<br>  as long as she is not hurting herself or others physically, she is there to stay.<br>  as far as her being in a "specail" school, she has every right and the same rights as you and I do.

If you keep to a good, healthy plan it's pretty straightforward to lose 5-10 pounds a month. Do cardio workouts (running or jogging, or just aerobics like jumping jacks, etc.) for at least 30 minutes a day and including weight training every other day or so.<br>  <br>  Keep your diet balanced with lots of fruits and veggies and meat or peanut butter sandwiches for protein. Don't cut way back on calories because that'll only hurt yourself and your weight loss. If you keep to a healthy diet and exercise plan, you might make your goal by the end of May.

Limit "worrying time" to around 45 mns, daily, possibly when you get home, or after your evening meal, but not too close to bedtime) after which, resolve firmly to refuse to worry again on that day: realise and accept that to do otherwise would be counterproductive to your mental health, and enjoyment of life. You will have had your "worry time" for the day, and can just write down any more thoughts that come to mind, and say to yourself: "Well, I'll just have to worry about that tomorrow, won't I?". It's important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately. Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I can't do this/ am never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that it is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. <br>  <br>  Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Try replacing a negative thought with a positive affirmation of your choice, like: "I am a unique individual, with my own set of skills, and good points", or "I may not be perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, right now". Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Tai Chi, or yoga suits others better. Give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is a version for use in public places, (you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> refers: "Even though I sometimes suffer from anxiety, I deeply and completely accept myself." Or Google: "neurofeedback; therapists" Herbal remedies, such as chamomile, passionflower, or St. John's wort, are often effective, but the idea is (as with anxiolytic medication) to use them like water wings, or training wheels on a bicycle, providing initial support, and giving time for other treatments, such as therapy, and relaxation techniques, to take effect. .|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	It could be anxiety.

eQCsKq4jaa	Don't take this first part out of context but in Switzerland they added to their euthanasia laws the right for people with psychiatric illness to be legally euthanized. BUT in order for anything like that to be considered one would have to have been through all available treatments. And there are a great many of them. My point with this is that even in a highly progressive and liberal nation suicide is not acceptable and ONLY after the full due course of medicine could it be allowed. <br>  <br>  There have also been studies using Ketamine (an anesthetic) where after the patient received the drug the feeling of having been depressed was gone. It was not just the depression in the moment but those people could not really remember that feeling of pain. That is not to say go get some ketamine but that when people are in a very low mood it can be impossible to see or imagine or remember happiness. <br>  <br>  And how do you know you can not be happy? There are so many things as treatment. And even if you have been treated I am willing to bet you have not run the gauntlet to get to a suitable treatment. <br>  <br>  And those messages people are constantly bombarded with about not committing suicide are because people can and do get better. They become productive members of society- doctors, lawyers, scientists, teachers, CEO's anything. <br>  <br>  And even if you are deathly afraid of seeing people and any social activity dozens of treatments come to my mind.<br>  <br>  When you feel debilitated by fear depression can often set in. <br>  <br>  See a psychiatrist and if you do now and it is not helping find another and another if you need to.|`|9ZvHsIFfaa	You should be grateful what would you prefer your life that ur not liking which u have every power to change, like i say if u dont like anything change everything, or that you do that thing and you don't have a life at all i know which most people would pick, grow up|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	Listen, I've walked in those confused shoes.

uXbl1Zbhaa	Some liquors have medicinal qualities.  Depending on how old you are,  if you are underage (drinking age) ask your parents.  We used to use whiskey on my daughter when she was learning to walk.  She would grab hold of our coffee table to walk around that.  Whenever she would lose her balance and fall against the table she would bust her lip.  You can't put rubbing alcohol or other medicines on that because they are supposed to go on the outside of your body.  Whiskey (or other liquors) is made to go on the inside of your body.  Whatever little bit would get into your system won't hurt you.  Get a qtip or cotton ball and soak it in the whiskey.  Then rub the qtip or cotton ball on your lip.   It will taste awful but you will heal as good as new.|`|AA12217110	Time!

I8lFqyyFaa	thrush is a yeast infection of the mouth and throat...  Do you have a vaginal yeast infection you're concerned about spreading?  Yeast is normally found in small amount on the body and on mucus membranes - like your mouth.  There isn't any reason transferring some from your vagina should cause it to suddenly grow out of control.  There are other things that can cause unchecked growth in your mouth, like taking antibiotics, having dry mouth, or immune problems.  But you could lick your own vagina - if you could - and receive nothing new.  That's all stuff you're already colonized with.|`|zHS1hm6Yaa	What<br>  ??? that makes like no sense at all

This is also a trick that is used as a Chinese remedy (maybe other places as well, but to my knowledge China).  Well, the point is GINGER works!  Infuse it into tea/water (a really "adventurous" way to prepare it is with cola) and drink while it's still hot (warm works too but hot really soothes the throat).  Another use could be consuming a VERY small piece without anything else.

TODzjTczaa	Chris, I don't know how to tell you this, but you're not ever going to succeed like that.<br>  <br>  Fat on your body does not come from fat in your food.  This is a scientifically-proven fact.  Fat on your body comes from CARBS in your food.  This is because your body only has two kinds of metabolism that goes through.  In the "fat-burning" type of metabolism, the fat you eat is kept in your bloodstream and burned for energy, and the carbs you eat, which are unnecessary, are excreted in your sweat and urine.<br>  <br>  In the "carb-burning" mode, which you are forcing your body into with your diet, your body burns carbohydrates for 'quick' energy, and then stores any excess carbs by turning them into fat.  (For evidence, think about this: blood sugar is in a form called "glycerol" -- and the fat that's on your gut is in a form called a "triglyceride" -- because it's made of 3 sugar molecules stuck together!)<br>  <br>  If you want to lose weight and build muscle, the answer is simple, but hard to get started on: cut out ALL flour and sugar from your diet, eat huge quantities of rare red meat, and don't skimp on the fats!<br>  <br>  Here's why: your body needs 7 things to operate at peak strength: vitamins, minerals, water, cofactors (minor elements that your body has to have to properly use vitamins and minerals), essential fatty acids, essential amino acids (proteins), and calories (whicih are made from fat or carbs, depending on the type of metabolism your body is using at the time.<br>  <br>  If you're not getting enough of any of those seven things, your body cannot build and use muscle at peak efficiency.  Many Americans that are trying to build muscle cannot because they lack the essential fatty acids necessary to do so.  <br>  <br>  On a side note, if any of those protein shakes are soy-based, STOP DRINKING THEM IMMEDIATELY!  100g of soy protein has as much estrogen in it as a birth control pill -- so those shakes are filling you with hormones that are sabotaging your muscle-building efforts, not to mention your future fertility.

tqvApK7Xaa	it sounds like a broken bone, but you still should get an x-ray to make sure because if you guess what you have, and it's something serious, it can cause you a bigger problem.  <br>  <br>  a good way to find out what you have is to go on the webmd symptom checker.  you can put in your symptoms at where your problem is and it can give you a good estimate on what your problem is.  it is usually accurate and can help you solve your problem.  I had the same issue as you did when I twisted my foot.

EMNwWAuvaa	Some epidurals take immediate effect while others can take up to 3 days to really work.  Most successful epidurals reproduce the complaint thereby letting the doctor know that they are in the correct spot.  They are usually given in a series of three and done every six months.  I am not a big fan of them and would advice you to seek treatment with a physical therapist that does backs.  There are many techniques that can help the lower back with a herniated disc.  The epidurals or the cortisone injections only temporarily mask the symptoms.|`|IKakoOfyaa	An epidural is a nerve block and should have provided immediate pain relief.  A cortisone shot is an anti-inflammatory and used to reduce swelling and inflammation around the herniation and provide more long term relief, however pain relief won't be immediate.  Also, cortisone shots are often referred to as epidural cortisone, so it would depend on if you got two different injections or just one.|`|bssOhC9jaa	Epidural is basically a catheter so they can eject medication (drugs) and will block pain right away. Cortisone (steroid) shot will help with pain and or inflammation for awhile, but the pain will come back. The epidural will go between the epidural space in your spine. I get cortisone shots in my wrist and it helps with the pain. You said you just had an epidural, but didn't mention what they did or what drug they used. If you go to wikipedia, you can read about epidurals. Have fun and good luck
aduuj6W3aa	If possible, cut your fingernail. Then put some ointment (some type of antiseptic) daily on your finger and sleep with a bandaid on it. you may possibly get an infection. You will know because it will get all crusty and sort of turn yellow. If so you will need to go to a doctor and get a shot. As far as making it less painful, try putting a tight bandaid on it as the pressure will relieve some of the pain.
ZYOJQdjyaa	If you think you're getting better on your own, don't take them. If your symptoms worsen then you might want to get a second opinion from a different doctor.<br>  <br>  Drink your fluids, eat lots of fruit, don't strain yourself, if you are tired, sleep.

HcS8vzNCaa	Fastin is a drug similar to amphetamine used for appetite suppression, with the generic name phentermine.  The scientific term for this kind of drug is sympathomimetic amine.  Brand names include Fastin, Adipex-P, Ionamin, Obenix, Oby-Cap, Teramine and Zantryl.<br>  <br>  Taking Fastin along with other diet medications can lead to a fatal lung disease called pulmonary hypertension.  Do not take it along with other diet pills without your doctor's approval.  <br>  <br>  Side effects can include depression and extreme tiredness, dangerously high blood pressure, severe headaches, blurred vision, buzzing in your ears, anxiety, confusion, chest pain, shortness of breath, uneven heartbeats, seizure.<br>  <br>  Fastin has not been produced since December 1998, when the American medical authorities made SK-Beecham withdraw Fastin from the market. Fastin is no longer produced and sold since Ionamin and Adipex diet pills were launched.  Hi-Tech Pharmeceuticals acquired the rights to the formula and modified it to make it safe for over-the-counter sales. <br>  <br>  Adipex falls unde the same category, another sympathomimetic amine.  It is simply another name for the same kind of drug, and you will find there is really no difference.  Phentermine is available with a prescription under the brand name Adipex and was previously available under the brand name Fastin.<br>  <br>  Don't be fooled by the name change.  Pharmaceutical companies like to play the shell game to fool consumers.  You should be aware that the side effects of taking these kinds of drugs can be very risky, although it is still approved by the FDA for obesity.  Make sure to follow your doctor's advice when dealing with these risky drugs.|`|PmeeNinuaa	actually fastin is in the market, i work in gnc and its on sale for 69.99<br>  but like you am wondering is there a difference.

If you exercise every day and keep your food consumption the same you'll lose weight. However skipping breakfast and half a sandwich for lunch sounds pretty small. You're better off having a larger breakfast and lunch then a smaller dinner, that way your body is getting the calories when it needs them. Exercise means sometimes you put on weight because muscle weighs more than fat but your body will look better and be more toned. Do not rely on scales or weigh yourself too often.|`|DFXdzDslaa	Well I don't think you should skip breakfast. It's like the most important meal of the day and if you go to school it will pain you to be hungry in the morning. Your stomach could growl too!

There's no way you'd get the nutrients you need. No breakfast? That will make you want to eat more at lunch. Even if you do control the urge, you'll end up overeating at dinner. And let's say you control THAT urge. You'll end up malnourished because there is NO way you are getting all the vitamins/minerals you need!<br>  <br>  And it doesn't just last four months. You'd have to eat like that for the rest of your [short] life to keep the weight off. Please don't do this, you'll hurt yourself! Just eat healthy, allow yourself a 100 calorie splurge a day, and get out there and walk! I recommend you adopt a dog from the shelter. It will force you to exercise!|`|cKSbZBt8aa	You need to eat healthy, breakfast, lunch and dinner with protein snacks between.   If you eat what you are suggesting you will put your body in to hardship mode and give yourself problems.  Your metabolism will slow causing an increase in stored fat.  You will also starve your body of necessary fuel for exercise.  Stay away from sugar foods and sugar drinks - these add fat tissue.  Chicken, fish are good protein source.  Vegetables for fibre to fight fat tissue.  Exercise like walking 30 minutes a day or more.  Do it healthily.

wLWgCRFcaa	That is high low density lipoprotein (LDL), not low cholesterol.  You have high LDL ("bad cholesterol").<br>  Too much LDL in the blood can cause cholesterol deposits to build up in the arteries, making it harder for the blood to flow through these blood vessels. High levels of LDL in the blood are associated with an increased risk of heart disease. That is why LDL is referred to as " bad cholesterol".<br>  Here is a website that talks about cholesterol and diet.  Exercise is important too, as your doctor has informed you.  Try to walk at least 20 minutes a day at a pace that raises your heart rate.<br>  Good luck.|`|AA11443469	are you talking about LDLP? that means low density of lipoproteins. Yea exercising can help, maybe 20 mins a day of sweating but you really need to watch your diet. You need to eat more fiber (like fruits and salads) and to raise your cholesterol, put hard boiled eggs on your salad. it tastes good too<br>  and fyi, cholesterol means fat that comes from an animal, any animal product will have some amount of cholesterol, just look at the back of food packages.|`|bvUqWLJOaa	eggs w/ salt or pepper<br>  <br>  shrimp<br>  <br>  i dk try<br>  <br>  www.foods with cholesteral .com

Lo que hay es ignorancia. y tabus. <br>  como el que los antidepresivos son drogas adictivas, desconocer la diferencia entre un antidepresivo, un ansiolitico, un anti-epileptico,<br>  entre depresivo y deprimido, entre psicosomatico y endogeno. <br>  <br>  Como ya dijeron no es nada nuevo esto de las depresiones, lo que pasa es que antes se ignoraba del tema y en lugar de ir con el psiquiatra, iban con brujos, curanderos, sacerdotes, psicologos, o con fugas con el alcohol principalmente, drogas, cigarro, neurosis y Muchas fugas materiales.<br>  <br>  Ahora que se comienza a orientar a la gente sobre esta "Enfermedad" no simple estado de animo, pues la gente piensa que es la enfermedad de moda.<br>  <br>  Una cosa es estar cargado de stress, o tener alguna situacion que genere miedo o inseguridad, como problemas de salud, legales, etc... que pueden generar estados de stress, pero no son depresiones aunque las gentes las confunda.<br>  o situaciones que depriman a la persona como perdida de un miembro de la familia (duelo), perdida de trabajo, perdida de la novia, pareja o divorcio.... que generan autoconmiseracion! y esta genera que la persona este deprimida! no Depresiva.<br>  <br>  En la depresion hay una paradoja! por que contrario a lo que se piensa, puede haber estabilidad tanto en lo economico, salud, afeccion con la pareja, estabilidad en la familia etc...<br>  Y aun a si sufrir de depresion!

Try to do 200 minutes of cardio a week. Remember fat does not turn into muscle, so you need to lose your fat while putting on muscle. Work hard, but don't over 60 minutes at a time. Do planks and other abs exercises on alternate days.<br>  <br>  On training days, do 5-10 minutes of cardio to warm up, then do your weight training. Do 30 to 60 minutes more of cardio, then go home.<br>  <br>  The best time to eat is just after your workout within an hour when your metabolism is raging. For your muscles, incorporate some isolated soy protein or whey protein. Whey is more potent but the soy tastes better!<br>  <br>  Don't look at your scale as the be all and end all, but get a measuring tape to check your progress, and that will show more tangible results.<br>  <br>  Read magazines like Shape, Womens Fitness, Fitness, etc to get tips and to stay motivated.<br>  <br>  Good luck and stick at it.

NplgEqG4aa	Preexisting health issues only come up if you go uninsured for a while and have a gap in your coverage. I believe you can go up to 68 days without insurance before you are labeled as previously uninsured or having a gap in insurance. If that happens, you are in trouble. Every time you go see a doctor you will be scrutinized. May have to prove that even a new problem is not preexisting.  Major head ache.  If your husband gets laid off he should purchase COBRA insurance from the employer until he finds a new job with insurance. Call your husbands human resource people and they will explain all this to you.  Do not go uninsured even for a day.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ci0FcFpyaa	healthplans.bebto.com - try this one.

It is normal to be natural, or intact.  Uncircumcised is not the proper term.<br>  To answer the question, yes, it is normal for guys not to be circumcised.<br>  Boys are born with a foreskin, and it belongs where it is grown.|`|AA10350894	Yes, it is very normal.|`|qicRLHMLaa	It is more common these days.|`|rFUqIakAaa	I'm not, and I consider myself normal so I'm going to have to say YES. :)<br>  <br>  Some boys are circumcised, others are not. Being uncircumcised is more common in Europe, Australia and Canada and being circumcised is more common in America and the middle east, so they are both or common depending on where you are from. But since every boy (not to mention every male animal) is born with a foreskin on his penis, and every female is born with a foreskin over the clitoris, it's technically more "normal" not to be circumcised. Circumcision is an alteration and therefore technically it's abnormal.|`|513a27e4679ce8c76c10d99baa79e5dfaa	in the US no cause some girls do not like guys who are circumsized in other countries like the UK or england places like that it is but now its starting to become normal in the US i am one of the many males who where circumsized but we didnt have a choice our parents made us when we where new borns but many of those who where circumsized are now doing foreskin restoration|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Of course it is!

dpgXzMenaa	I don't suppose you've ever been permitted to learn the truth about all the people that masturbate... but it might interest you to know that infants masturbate (often to orgasm if they do it at all and - rarely - even during the last week or two before they're born)... that by the age of 12, almost 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that at age 15 it's 2/3 of them who are doing it regularly (many of those are doing it more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse. Even very old people do it.<br>  <br>  Everyone can (and everyone deserves to) enjoy the pleasure of orgasm, including everyone who chooses to enjoy it alone instead of (or in addition to) having sex with someone else.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you every step there is to have an orgasm... every girl and woman is different, and it would take way longer for me to type it all out than it would for you to give yourself one... but one thing you can do to find out is check out these webpages:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-basics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-techniques.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <br>  Read the pages all the way through, and try some of the things suggested. Take your time (it might take a whole afternoon the first time), and just enjoy learning what feels best for you. Sooner or later, you'll have an orgasm, and they get better each time if you're one of those lucky girls who can have them again and again.<br>  <br>  An orgasm is all the things you feel and all the things that happen with your body at the peak of sexual arousal and pleasure. It's a reflex we're all born with (just like knee jerks and sneezes) that our bodies have in response to sexual stimulation. You will *definitely* know when you have one. There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  It can take a girl or woman anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm. Both of these are pretty unusual but perfectly normal, and anything in between is just fine... and most can get there in much less than 10 minutes when they masturbate.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee). The physical and emotional pleasure that you'll feel everywhere at the same time is just about the best feeling a human body can have.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it *can* happen sometimes that there'll be no interruption at all between several orgasms in a row, and it can feel like one single orgasm... intense physical pleasure and whole-body tension and release that can last anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it and don't worry. Masturbating is normal and healthy, and learning what pleases you sexually is good for you... especially because you'll know what to tell (better yet, to show) your man about how to please you when you eventually decide you're ready to have sex.|`|CuwgNBlyaa	figure it out kiddo.|`|kknSPYxKaa	Google it.|`|1BbnyTfBaa	<a href="http://www.MyMasturbation.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.MyMasturbation.com</a>|`|iQU2j6quaa	tab A into slot B. its not that hard just figure out what you like best and keep doing it but make sure you are in private good luck|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Are you a girl?

(it really helped me :))|`|TQWUQKgBaa	Consult with your parents, or the people you feel closest to you|`|qKGbvKe6aa	well what is causing you to want to kill yourself?<br>  you need to talk to someone you are comfortable with not with whoever they "assign" to you.<br>  you have the right to request other therapists and counselors. <br>  if you have a hard time speaking your mind, write a letter! draw a picture! something/ anything that will get them to understand.<br>  i see you did good in expressing yourself through here maybe you can show this question to someone you trust
AQmcmW6paa	I have a big group of friends that I'm always with, but there is this one girl that used to be everyones best friend but she's just SO annoying so now nobody, I mean NOBODY likes her anymore. The bad part is that no one bothers to tell her we don't like her so she still kind of hangs with us. In a way it sucks and it makes me feel bad, but most of the time when she talks to us we ignore her and don't hang out with her. We don't even bother talking to her when it can be avoided. <br>  Seriously, you sound like this girl. No offense but honestly, if you told me to come sit with you, and I said I would be leaving another friend alone, and then you told me that you we're more important than her. I would be seriously pi$$ed. I give her great reason not to talk to you.<br>  <br>  Just leave her alone for a bit, if she comes back and talks to you again, she is worth being friends with. But if she just keeps ignoring you like she is now, don't even both trying to be friends again.|`|bssOhC9jaa	The problem is you. You think its you you you only. Its not! Stop being telling her what to do and maybe she will be friends with you again.|`|PmjeWyn2aa	Life aint so bad.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZAQC6Hx3aA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZAQC6Hx3...</a>|`|BL2DqmNkaa	Talk to Esty(?) about how you feel. Tell her that you want to be friends with her, and that sometimes she needs to think of you too, not just her other friends. If Esty's not the best friend for you, find a new one! Try and be friends, but don't depend on her to be your only friend. Branch out in your art class: it's full of great people, you just have to make the first move.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	oh for ****s sake.... I am so glad I'm not a girl so I never had to deal with the kind of bullpoop that goes on - like what you are doing to this "friend"<br>  <br>  why does she have to do what you say? and if you are all friends, why are you fighting over who's going to be the one who is alone? <br>  <br>  it sounds like YOU are the one starting trouble and being unreasonable. it sounds like you have control issues.<br>  <br>  I have an idea. while you are at school, why don't you focus on LEARNING STUFF, and stop paying attention to what everybody else is doing. Pay attention to YOURSELF and remember why you are at school in the first place.
gI81PtOUaa	There are many over-the-counter alternatives to Pantolac for treating your stomach ulcer, including Maalox, Mylanta, Gaviscon, Pepcid or Zantac, which do not contain the high calcium content of Tums. <br>  <br>  That said, I would strongly recommend you talk to your doctor before abandoning the Pantolac and beginning an alternative course of treatment. Good luck and be well. :)
iAv9P3HTaa	A "quick" way to get abs is in the combination of diet and exercises.<br>  It depends on body fat with males it starts showing under 10%.<br>  These exercises much more effective then push ups or sit ups:<br>  <br>  <br>  Ball Crunch<br>  Lie with the ball resting under the mid/lower back and place hands behind the head or across the chest. Contract your abs to lift your the torso off the ball, pulling the bottom of your ribcage down toward your hips. As you curl up, keep the ball stable.<br>  <br>  <br>  Crunch & Reach<br>  Begin with body straight over the ball, light weight extended behind you (not shown). Contract the abs to lift and bring the weight over the head, crunching up and twisting to the right, contracting the right side of waist. Repeat for all reps and then switch sides.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Modified Plank<br>  Begin by placing elbows on the floor and resting body on the knees. Pull the abs tight to hold your body in a straight line from head to knees without sagging in the middle, eyes looking naturally forward. Hold this position for as long as you can, relax and repeat 3 or more times.<br>  <br>  <br>  Knee Tucks<br>  Start in plank position on the ball, with the ball under the shins/ankles. Roll the ball towards you with your feet, tightening the abs into a crunch.<br>  <br>  <br>  Woodchops<br>  Attach one end of a resistance band to something sturdy and wrap the band around your hand a few times for the right tension. Grasp the band in both hands and begin in a lunge position, reaching down with the arms Keeping the arms straight the entire time, rotate and lift the body towards the other side while sweeping the arms on a diagonal. Return to start and repeat before moving onto the other side.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hip Extension on the Ball<br>  Lie on the floor with feet heels propped on ball. Keeping abs tight, slowly lift your hips off the floor (squeezing the buttocks) until body is in a straight line. Hold for a few seconds and lower<br>  <br>  <br>  Ball Taps<br>  Sit on the ball with strong abs and straight spine, hands behind the head. Contract your abs and lift the right foot, tapping it on a medicine ball in front of you. Lower and repeat with the other foot, alternating sides. Use your abs to keep your balance.<br>  <br>  How to Work Your Abs<br>  <br>  * You can effectively work your abs with 3 non-consecutive workouts a week<br>  * Do 1-3 sets of 12-16 reps of each exercise. If that's too easy, make sure you're doing each exercise correctly and using perfect form. You can add a dumbbell or plate to crunches to add difficulty.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|AA10350894	The short quick answer is, sit ups, push ups, crunches and maybe pull ups.|`|nyylb6qUaa	Brother, stay strong to the faith.

rP1GRQjuaa	I'm so sorry that you have it so rough, sweetie.  Your parents are obviously exposing you to behavior that they shouldn't.  Seeing a therapist would definitely be a good idea for you, and if your mom will not find one for you, talk to your school counselor.  Whatever comes around, remember that your parents are the adults and you are not.  Whatever they do, remember that it is on THEM, not you.  You cannot drive them to drink or walk out, or anything of the kind.  Your mom was 100% wrong to blame you for his behavior, and 100% wrong to walk out and leave you with him.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Ask yourself: "Why do I feel depressed, and when did I first start to feel this way: can I associate this with any recent change in my life?" (if so, it is probably reactive [situational] depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may be indicated, but most of life's adverse situations are resolved within 16 weeks, yet the medical criteria for depression, and the prescription of antidepressants is only 2 weeks!). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment). <br>  <br>  It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor. <br>  <br>  (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, don’t follow the typical “normal” reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements. <br>  <br>  (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes minutes of exercise, daily, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.|`|uKmNYqGgaa	If your Mom won't let you get therapy or counseling, tell your school counselor, or someone you trust, what you wrote here.

I don't know how old you are but I am probably around your age. Don't worry, its normal. Even though you haven't had you period, you reproductive system is becoming active through puberty. The discharge you see is a natural lubricant that your body produces. It natural, but sometimes annoying. But, the are defiantely things you can do. You can use moist cleasning wipes made especially for women to keep you feeling fresh during the day, or wear a panty liner that will absorbs and lock away any moisture the occurs. And last, one thing I learned is to use a very mild sop when you wash, try baby wash. It will cause less irritation down there and it wil help with your discomfort. Hope this helps.|`|SbvIluMMaa	Dont' worry.. I get this too.<br>  <br>  You get this when you have your period.. that's how you know when you are gonna SOON NOT NOW have it.

TlHwwnmBaa	There are many types of ovarian cysts. I have PCOS. polycystic Ovarian Cysts. It is kinda like having Diabetes. Your sugar levels a slightly high. This causes a build up of fatty deposits around the ovaries which in turn makes it hard for the eggs to leave the ovary. The egg then opens in the ovary causing cysts. I beleive these are called follicles. The body then starts changing the homone production to try to force the eggs out. And then you get side effects like excess hair, loss of hair, acne...etc. The good news is there are treatments and ways to stop it getting worse.|`|89m2Uitxaa	ok i have had MANY ovarian cysts and they are nothing to worry about but they do hurt a lot and they bust on there on but it hurts real bad ok and the blood building up i have no clue about but may u could look it up like on google ar ask.com but the cysts thing u have nothing to worry about just u will be in some pain and alot of pain when it bust

If you receive regional anesthesia (either spinal or epidural), medication will block sensation in the affected area, but you will remain aware of your surroundings.

P8dIznazaa	No!  Breathing through your mouth is perfectly fine.  In fact it's desirable when doing heavy exercise because it lets you take in air more quickly than the nose allows.  Breathing through the nose is better when you need a little extra filtering, though it doesn't in fact do all that much filtering.

Since you're cooking with it, it can't contain any harmful chemicals, otherwise you would get sick.<br>  How does one spray oneself in the face? Anyways, now you know to be more careful next time =)<br>  My advice to you: rinse out your eyes. You have to rinse A LOT. First wash the oil off of your face, to make sure no more can go in your eyes. Wash your hands with soap and rinse thoroughly to make sure no soap goes in your eyes. Then cup your hands under lukewarm running water and keep your eyes open. Splash the water into your eyes. It will sting a little, but you have to rinse your eyes out. The amount of rinsing time depends on how much you sprayed in. Once you think you've rinsed enough, dry off your face and look to see how red your eyes are. If they are very red and stinging, try to get to a doctor of go to the hospital if your vision is getting blurry.<br>  If you got a little mist in your eyes (idk how far your can sprays), then you should be ok, but I'm no expert.<br>  Hope I helped and good luck with everything!|`|ZGFjteGRaa	13 11 26

AA12140689	School psychologists can be wrong. It might be a good idea to seek a second opinion, perhaps from someone who specializes in autism spectrum disorders.<br>  <br>  Every individual with Asperger's syndrome is different and the symptoms and severity vary a lot between individuals. Some people with Asperger's syndrome are able to function well, despite some difficulties, while others can't function as well and encounter a lot of difficulties and need some help. Because the spectrum is so wide, it's hard to confirm or reject a diagnosis by just reading a bit online.<br>  <br>  I'm an adult with Asperger's syndrome. I didn't fit any "dysfunctional" profile as a kid either. I did well in school, usually behaved well etc. but I was always a social outcast. My parents thought I was just shy and didn't give it much thought. They didn't know that I avoided social situations because I had no idea how to act and was unable to read other people's body language, which sometimes lead to clashes. They didn't know about my sensory issues. When I had meltdowns they just thought I was sensitive etc. They didn't understand what was really going on and because they couldn't see any major issues (behavioral problems or learning difficulties) they never looked into it. I went undiagnosed into adulthood and always had to deal with my problems alone, without any help, support or understanding.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying your son has it. I just don't think you'd be able to tell by reading a couple of websites. I think that if the school psychologist suspects something, it's worth looking better into it and getting a second opinion. If there's nothing wrong, then you'll get that confirmed and can put the school staff and yourself at ease. If he does have it then it's good to know about it now so that you can deal with it early, support him and provide help if he needs it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Psychologists need to make quick assessments, on limited data, erring occasionally. View the information and weblinks for social anxiety/shyness, and self confidence, in sections 9, and 38, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> (Asperger's; section 21). Here is an exercise that can help you. It is called "Act as If." When you are in a social situation, act as if you are outgoing. Talk more, smile at everyone, ask questions, speak in a normal or excited tone, not a meek tone. Watch some of your outgoing peers, and imitate the style of their social behavior. (I PRETEND that I'm an ACTOR, PLAYING a PART).<br>  Research shows that when you "act as if" continually, your image of yourself begins to conform to your new behavior. In this case, you will gain self-esteem and self-confidence, and begin to see yourself as socially normal, not shy. You will become more socially successful, and this will motivate you to continue your new social behavior until it becomes a habit. Try this for a month, in every situation you can. I am confident that you will become much more comfortable and outgoing.<br>  <br>  One form of therapy is to go somewhere that nobody knows you, and deliberately make an utter fool of yourself: put on a paper hat, and yell out: "I'm queen/king of America!", or something else ridiculous, (make up your own - have some fun, safely) then get back in the taxi, (warn the driver of your intentions, first) or car, and leave. People will point, and say: "Look at that idiot". But, you may not be up to the stage where you can do that, yet (I can, and I used to be shy). Or, preferably in the company of a friend, or family member, on a different train, or bus route to your regular one, call out the names, or numbers of all the stops. It will teach you that, although it isn't actually pleasant, (EXPECT MODERATE DISCOMFORT) you will survive; be stronger for the experience, and the next time (should you need to repeat this type of therapy) will be considerably easier. Remember: "A fear avoided is a fear strengthened; a fear faced is a fear reduced." Regard it as your final test: once you have accomplished it, the barrier will be broken; just don't go too far, the other way! Learn to laugh at yourself, and give a big, cheesy grin when others see you do something foolish, as we all do, occasionally.<br>  <br>  It is endearing, if you don't do it too often. Use positive affirmations: for example: "I am very likable and other people feel comfortable around me". Write down all of your self limiting beliefs; then write down the positive counter of them, (exact opposite) and repeat them and imprint them into your mind. Most importantly: Force yourself to approach somebody and initiate some sort of communication. Start out small by asking the time and directions and gradually go bigger. Although there are anti-anxiety medications (anxiolytics) available, these come with risks, and the possibility of side effects, habituation, even addiction, and withdrawal problems, and are unsuitable for young people. <br>  <br>  Try having a cup of "Tension Tamer", herbal tea, by Celestial Seasonings, (from supermarket tea, or health food aisles) or make some at home, and cool, then bottle, and drink as needed (I find it so strong tasting, that I need to drink it quickly, followed by something like fruit juice, to take away the taste, but others may find it more tolerable). C(h)amomile tea is a more palatable option. As with all herbal/green teas, use lemon/lime, and/or a little sweetener (NOT ARTIFICIAL!!!) but no cream, or milk. Xylitol, or Stevia is preferable, (health food stores) or fruit sugar (fructose, such as "Fruisana", from supermarket sugar aisles).|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	if your son can communicate normally with anyone i seriously doubt he will have AD either. School psychologist isn't always legit. You should take your son to a real psychologist.|`|YdHAaTdnaa	There is a high chance that he lacks interest in gym classes, and indeed, that is personality related. If you find he likes to be by himself and tunes out often, then there is need to worry. Chances are, the psychologist is fearing the worst for your son. Keep in mind Asperger's syndrome can be very mild-general signs are anxiety and irritation to clothing.|`|VJcypcIhaa	I think you know your son better than a school psychologist. <br>  <br>  Take it with a grain of salt. Don't treat your son any different or let anyone else treat him any different, but keep an eye on him.|`|VjkDIvezaa	First of all it is not a *Disease* because you can not catch it and it doesn't kill you. Intelligence has nothing to do with it besides the fact Aspergers syndrome people tend to have an above average iq.  A main way to tell, though, if he is preoccupied with one topic. does he like to learn information about one topic  and collect items of it? He might think that this topic is stupid and feel weird talking about it because he doesn't want to look stupid knowing so much about one thingCan he understand facial expressions and body language. not like happy and sad but can he tell when people are bored with him or does he keep talking anyway?  I think you should get a second opinion or ask the school psychologist why she thinks that and what symptoms has she seen in your son that made her come to this conclusion. Online stuff is mostly wrong. And if he does have aspergers syndrome that party aspect you said he does not have might be because you have never seen him at a party where you were not with him. Aspergers kids tend to be more "normal" when they are around the people they are comfortable with. But you know your son more then anyone else so if you think that there is no way your son could have this syndrome then you should question the psychologist as to why she thinks that. And Aspergers is not the same as autism. I act nothing like rainman. it is just on the high end of the spectrum. it is not *high functioning autism*|`|zFsTSrOcaa	The SCHOOL psychologist said this?  Was this after extended observation, testing, or just a quick visit?  You need a true professional opinion if there's any question at all.<br>  <br>  Avoidant personality disorder is a common misdiagnosis and codiagnosis (secondary effect) of Asperger's.  Also, remember that Asperger's isn't an "either/or" diagnosis.  My son has definite Asperger's traits but is far more socially adept than I ever was in school.<br>  <br>  You sound like you're learning everything you can about your son's options.  Just remember that Asperger's is a lot more complex than most people think.|`|sBc14a8Naa	Yes, it's not uncommon for a school psychologist to make that kind of mistake. They're not even supposed to diagnose students- that's a psychiatrists job.

Always get a second opinion from a psychologist of your choosing.  The schools get a lot of money if he is labeled asperger's and takes special ed classes.  Asperger's is controversial and all your son will need is help developing his social skills.  Watch for anxiety, depression, and school avoidence.  Have the school pay for a round of psychological tests and have the results looked at by a psychologist of your choosing.  If he does have asperger's he has special rights and it is up to you to fight for them.|`|7jxbpo0Qaa	As the Coordinator of an Autistic GH for adults it would seem unwise for anyone but a trained professional to make a call such as this one.  Unfortunately Autism is the new disability of 2000, along with Fibromyalgia and Bipolar.<br>  <br>  I worked with this population for 20 years and each and every person was different.  Not every one with autism is mr (mentally retarded), live in their own world, self stims, etc...  Normally the diagnosis of Asperger's is determined by many many variables...eye contact, true communications skills, appropriate empathy, etc....<br>  <br>  My nephew has Asperger's (diagnosed 2 yrs ago), and he is an A student, overly friendly, shy at other times, uses schedule to follow through and stay on task, etc....  I thought he showed signs as early as 2 but his mother was in denial.  IF u disagree, then have him retested by TEACCH.  (Why was he tested in the first place...what signs of a disability were evident?)<br>  <br>  I truly believe that there are 1,000's of ppl in the world that have some type of unrecognized disability thus are not receiving services that could enhance their lives.  btw, u obviously know he is in the high risk group...white male...(I apologize for assuming the race, but am probably right.  80% of all person's with Autism are white males.)<br>  <br>  If he does have it, it is NOT a death sentence and he can go on to live a happy, fulfilling life with minimal assistance.

GL and I hope u find the answers that u seek.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	This is my experience with school psychologist (ones who are supposed to diagnosis learning disabilities) They don't usually give specific diagnosis because that would require the school to provide specific modifications to met your child's needs.  I don't know where you live but I live in NY and NO school psychologist that I dealt with while my daughter was in the general educations system would give me a specific diagnosis. So I'm surprised that you got one.  You might ask them what they would intended to do with that information. It would require by law that they come up with an IEP (individualized education plan) set up for your child listing his learning disabilities and what steps were to be taken to make it easier for him to learn. The first thing that I would ask the psychologist is what is his/her specialty??? Are they trained to test children for learning disabilities? Are they a neuro-psychologist ( some one trained to deal with learning disabilities and brain disorders/damage and the different ways that brains learn)  That is who I had test my daughters when I knew that they had learning disabilites and it's something that the parent usually picks up first.  You would have known before now if something was seriously wrong with your child.  But you want to be proactive before they can stick an inappropriate label on your son.  Talk to his doctor and get their opinion, ask for a referral to a neuro-<br>  psychologist/psychiatrist and let them know what the school said.  IF the school decides to push the issue you'll have to be able to push back and that means getting your own group of professionals who say different.  Legally the school can initate the process to have your child evaluated for LD's if they feel the parent is in denial. ( Belive me there are plenty of those) so you should be prepared to back up your contention that there is nothing wrong with him.  You might also think about changing his school after the evaluation if the school doesn't back down.  But to be honest with you, 1 out of 5 children has an undiagnosed LD. So there might be an issue there just not the one that the psychologist says it is.  IF you need help email me, that's what I do help children with learning disabilites get the services that they need.  I work with in the NYC school system. I was able to get my daughter into a school for kids with LD's with out having to use the services of an attorney. My daughter's do have LD's they run in my family so I know how to work the system and since it's federal law to provide for the kids you need to do the same basic things no matter where you live.

yE2vM76naa	1) The difference between fish oil and cod liver oil can be broken down like so....<br>  Fish oil has higher amounts of EPA and DHA per milliliter than Cod Liver oil as a general rule because Cod Liver Oil has more Vitamin A and D - and you can only squeeze so much in a milliliter so to speak.<br>  <br>  2) Take them with food (and NOT with coffee) and they are much less likely to give you fish burps. <br>  <br>  3) as far as mercury levels - both come from the same sort of critter, from the same ocean - look for a product that has been distilled by molecular weight and you'll be fine as far as the mercury content (in other words, none)<br>  <br>  4) The EPA is good for skin, but so is the vitamin A - so if you are more concerned with your skin, I would suggest Cod Liver Oil.<br>  <br>  5) If you take Cod Liver Oil, make sure that you take a dose that has less than 5,000 IU of vitamin A in it, and make sure that if you take a multi vitamin with retinyl palmitate, make sure that you dont go too far over that amount between the two combined.|`|66a13bf9fc4f5831c5a727b2e71e3db9aa	The mercury is a problem with ALL fish products. The safest fish w/ lowest levels comes from the most remote seas and you will pay a premium for it. In theory, there would be more mercury in a fish liver than in its body, because the liver cleans toxins out of the body. I don't know if anyone has ever studied that, though. <br>  <br>  Cod liver oil is way more plentiful and cheaper than fish oil. Two reasons, maybe 3--there is more oil there, it has been around for several generations and fish oil is all the latest health food rage.<br>  <br>  There are more omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil than in cod liver oil. Fish liver oil is a better source of vitamin A and possibly more effective at relieving arthritis.<br>  <br>  The least refluxing oil is one that also has a digestive enzyme in it called lipase. Lemon just covers the taste a bit. I like mint myself. I don't take the pills, just the liquid. Tastes pretty good going down and digests more quickly than gelatin coated pills.

Xuw8v8bPaa	When you were younger if you slept with your mom, like if you were scared of the dark or more comfortable or felt "safer" with her there, you could have developed this pattern. You could have became so use to sleeping in that bed that you prefer it over your own.<br>  <br>  I would suggest taking sleeping pills but not many like them because, if you do not take them early enough at night time, in the morning you won't or rather can't get up lol! Or just try forcing yourself to sleep. I had to do this at one point because, for a short period of time I could not sleep properly. Best of luck to you!
jLa1oC2Kaa	You can keep on top of it but with age comes life changes.  You get married, or you have a child, or you begin a career, you get a house, or all of the above.  Its all going to affect your eating habits, sleeping habits, and exercise routine.  These will cause weight gain if you aren't careful.  I recommend staying on a softball team or tennis or anything that will keep you active.  Avoid fast foods, caffeine, and soda in general.  Ever see the sugar content of a 20 oz Mountain Dew?  Not trying to scare you, just trying to answer your question.<br>  <br>  5'11" - All I know is I was 135 in high school, 150 in college, 170 when I got a house/kid/wife, and 180 when I realized I was getting fat.

Tuna, salads, lots of protein stuff (chicken, eggs).|`|MPX0f5jzaa	If you're living healthy, then no, it's not inevitable.<br>  <br>  Getting to 180 lbs at age 22 is not normal.

EWvzQ4Syaa	don't drink redbull!<br>  it will ruin your life!|`|aEpPt9koaa	1.  The best fastest way to whiten your teeth without getting them professionally done would be by using Crest Whitestrips.  I have used them several times and I have gotten a lot of comments about how white my teeth are.  They work really well and I believe they have some fast acting ones that whiten your teeth in three days.<br>  <br>  2. When you say arent aligned what exactly do you mean?   Your top teeth should sit right over your bottom teeth but you should not have an overbite or underbite.  If your concerned you should ask your orthodontist.<br>  <br>  3. It is normal for your teeth to feel big but they arent any bigger than before.  They feel big because you got use to feeling the braces on them taking up space and now they are not there.<br>  <br>  4. Its odd that you wont get a retainer until next week.  When I got my braces taken off they had taken a mold of my teeth a few weeks earlier so when I came back to get my braces removed they had my retainer there for me to wear when I walked out of the office.  A week seems like a long time to wait for a retainer but maybe times have changed since I went through the braces process.  You really wont be able to tell that your teeth are shifting but after a while you will see it in the mirror.  You might notice your teeth might have gaps in between or they seem overlapping each other.  Try to get that retainer as soon as possible because you dont want your teeth to shift and make sure you wear it at all times.  <br>  <br>  5. You should avoid colas, coffee, tea, and cigarettes.  All of these things cause teeth to turn yellow.|`|TgIMUmZPaa	Awesome! :) <br>  <br>  There are many products that are OTC that work.

The retainers do feel tight at first. <br>  <br>  Just eat healthy and you'll be okay.|`|sxsb78Kzaa	Well in the morning you should eat before you brush, and use mouthwash, its ok that your teeth feel big its because your braces that you're once used to is no longer there. Because you had braces your teeth should be aligned. Drink less soda and other acidic foods and if you are going to drink or eat them rinse your mouth with water to prevent acid erosion on you teeth. (transparency of the tooth) Don't drink coffee or smoke. Hope This Helps =]|`|4b7598fb11241e3ead2dd43bfb020adcaa	Yes. It's normal to have your teeth feel big. When I first got my braces off it felt so weird and looked weird. The retainer is gonna feel weird and should feel tight because your teeth are moving. If you don't wear it for a couple weeks, it may get tighter because your teeth will move ban again,so you'd might need a new one.well I know if you drink alot of coffee your teeth may turn yellow but I just brush my teeth 2 or 3 times a day and they stay white. I hope this helped you!|`|GJERjRBWaa	Crest whitening strips, yes, yes due to removal of braces that obscured them, they won't move noticeably, stay away from coffee/cigarettes/soda.

Try to get your heart rate up (you can ask your doctor for what a healthy exercising heart rate would be, or find a site online that can help you figure it out). Most colleges have on-campus rec centers that'll have workout areas and sometimes even personal trainers to help you. I also advise weight training as part of a good exercise regimen, especially as women especially tend to overlook or ignore it.|`|TODzjTczaa	The answer depends largely on your diet.  If you eat white flour- and white sugar-based foods, you won't be able to exercise like you would if you ate a low-carb, whole-food diet. <br>  <br>  If you do the whole bread/sweets routine, you need short workouts that come within a half-hour of eating -- say, a 15 minute aerobic routine like a brief bout of Tae Bo. <br>  <br>  If you don't, you can hit up a longer, much more effective exercise routine like jogging a couple of miles without feeling bushwhacked by the time you get home. <br>  <br>  Really, though, the best bet is to find something you remember enjoying, and do it again.

I would try to naturally resolve your insomnia.<br>  <br>  Are you getting enough calcium and magnesium in your diet?? Without sufficient calcium you will suffer insomnia, headaches and migraines, irritability and moodiness, achy bones, digestive upsets such as bloating and cramping and constipation, terrible terrible mood swings ......... calcium is essential for healthy bones, teeth and heart health and works in tandem with magnesium (known as the antistress mineral)...... lack of magnesium will give you migraines and headaches, nervous and twitching and muscular issues and will also cause lower back aches and bad digestion ....... increasing your daily intake of foods rich in both such as leafy and green vegies, brocolli, kale, spinach, fresh fish such as tuna and salmon and organic nuts and seeds such as almonds, brazil nuts and sunflower seeds will dramatically improve sleep patterns and help to reduce any irritability and moodiness and stress levels.<br>  <br>  Eat more green vegies mate, another thing they'll do is encourage the production of hydrochloric acid in your tummy and help resolve any issues you may have with constipation and bloating.<br>  <br>  Sodas, pop and soft drinks will rob you of your precious calcium supplies and dehydrate you terribly..... you'd be amazed at how being a little dehydrated can affect your mood and energy levels.<br>  <br>  Sodas and pop contain an awful lot of phosphorus and overload your body with it thus upsetting the precious calcium phosphorus balance... in an effort to rebalance the equation your body will simply leach calcium right out of your bones.... icky, that means calcium deficiency and all the side affects that go with it........ excessive processed sugar and saturated fat and animal protein and caffeine will also do a fine job of robbing you of your calcium supplies.<br>  <br>  don't drink caffeinated beverages 2 - 3 hours before bedtime either.<br>  <br>  A little extra effort sure but anything worth having is worth the extra effort ..... i reckon calmness and peace of mind is worth a few bowls of green vegies a day.<br>  <br>  sweet dreams hey<br>  <br>  peace baby<br>  ?

It is a "RULE" because the Fed's make it a Rule!  It is well known that many cell phone calls are made from planes in the air against all the rules.  The most notable are the ones made by people in 911 airplanes to loved ones just before they died.  <br>  <br>  Cell phone calls from airplanes DO cause havoc on the ground because the signal is being passed from cell tower to cell tower so fast (the speed of the plane) that it dominates the tower usage.  <br>  <br>  If you silence it, they will never know.  Just don't tell anyone that their rule is not for safety, but for their convenience, and maybe to convince you to pay exorbitant rates for the phones installed in the backs of the seats.|`|kStxd7Foaa	putting your plane in airplane mode cuts off all cellular service from it.

368407779143c4323ffd3fb0244979b0aa	Que bueno que haces esta pregunta por que hay mucha mala informacion al respecto. <br>  Para comenzar te dire que es mentira que exista algun medicamento que sea especial para la Memoria.<br>  no hay ningun medicamento o hierba, nada que afecte directamente tu memoria a corto plazo!<br>  <br>  Te explico. la memoria a corto plazo es aquella donde solamente se memorizan cosas, como si te presentan a una persona, te dicen su nombre y no lo vuelves a ver en meses no se quedara en tu memoria, solo precisamente a corto plazo, o como donde dejaste tu carro estacionado, el dia de hoy eso es a corto plazo.<br>  <br>  Esta memoria a corto plazo es la que se ve afectada, cuando uno no ha dormido bien, o cuando se esta pasando una etapa depresiva. pero en cuanto se normaliza el sue?o, se trata la depresion o se oxigena la sangre. esta memoria a corto plazo regresa a la normalidad. no se ve afectada. <br>  <br>  Y la memoria a largo plazo esa nunca se ve afectada. <br>  ejemplos a de la memoria a largo plazo. es por ejemplo el nombre de tus padres, de tus hijos, hermanos, fecha y lugar de nacimiento, etc...<br>  Cosas que nunca se te olvidaran a menos de que de verdad haya algun transtorno mental o alzhaimer. <br>  <br>  Y bueno cuando se nos olvidan muy seguido las cosas <br>  es por las razones que aqui te puse. <br>  1.- por que puede estar uno sufriendo una depresion con ansiedad generalizada. <br>  2.- Por que No se esta durmiendo minimo 6 horas al dia, ademas de poco ejercicio y no tomar por lo menos 6 vasos de agua al dia que lo recomendado es de 6 a 8 vasos al dia. <br>  <br>  Ahora te explico las causas y soluciones. Cuando estamos en estados depresivos, (OJO No deprimidos) ansiedad, o con algun problema muy fuerte! como enfermedad grave de los padres o algun hijo, algun problema legal u economico grave. <br>  Cuando pasa esto inconcientemente el 70 al 80 por ciento de tu concentracion  esta fijado en el problema o en la depresion.<br>  <br>  Una vez que se soluciona el problema o se trata la depresion de manera correcta. entonces la memoria regresa a la normalidad. <br>  <br>  Ahora cuando se trata de no dormir bien, el sistema nervioso a si como todas nuestras celulas, no se descansan de manera debida y entonces el sistema nervioso central no trabaja como deberia cuando se duerme poco no solo se afecta la memoria o concentracion si no tan bien la vista. <br>  <br>  El ejercicio y el agua son vitales para la memoria o concentracion. <br>  por que para comenzar el 50 & de nuestra sangre es plasma (agua) entonces al no tomar agua como es debido, la sangre se vuelve muy espesa! haciendo que el corazon bombe mas fuerte para que la sangre pueda llegar con oxigeno a todos nuestros rincones de nuestro organismo. <br>  El sistema nervioso central comenzando por el cerebro, necesitan de agua! es su gasolina para lubricarse y hacer sus funciones correctamente. <br>  Ademas de el agua se combina, el ejercicio! por que el ejercicio estimula la circulacion ! que es esto! que oxigena la sangre y estimula a la sangre a correr de buena manera sin sobre cargar el corazon (hipertension)<br>  <br>  La mala memoria u olvidar cosas muy faciles, no es otra cosa que falta de concentracion, debido a depresion, mucho stress en el trabajo, familia o a una mala oxigenacion de la sangre. <br>  <br>  Nuestra sangre pasa por el higado para ser desintoxicada y limpiada de toxinas y venenos, y a si llegar limpia y oxigenada a nuestro cerebro! (buena memoria o normal)<br>  <br>  Entonces combina esto:<br>  Tomar de 8 a 10 vasos de agua al dia<br>  hacer por lo menos 10 minutos de ejercicio al dia aunque sea caminar o trotar. <br>  Tratar de dormir por lo menos 6 horas a 8 al dia para que nuestro organismo pueda trabajar de manera normal. <br>  <br>  Si crees tener problemas de insomnio seguidos de depresion, ansiedad, o miedo, te sugiero que vayas con un buen psiquiatra para que normalize tu sistema hormonal<br>  <br>  Y de medicamentos pues nada lo unico que puedes tomar es. <br>  <br>  Complejo B que es un compuesto de vitaminas B1, B2 B6 Y B12. Que sirven para proteger y restaurar todas nuestras fibras nerviosas. <br>  Si notas que tienes tics nerviosos que regularmente no tienes, como que te tiemble un parpado, algun musculo de la cara o las lineas de tus manos muy marcadas y rojas. esto es sintoma inequivoco de que hay deficiencia de vitamina B, especificamente de Tiamina (b1) y tambien esto te afecta el sue?o y tu memoria.<br>  <br>  y  Ginko biloba. (OJO) algunas personas dicen que este es el medicamente para mejorar la memoria! <br>  pero no es a si! el Ginko Biloba es un oxigenador de la sangre!<br>  La sangre al oxigenarse adecuadamente,  va limpia y con mas oxigena al cerebro y entonces nuestro sistema nerviosa se regulariza. y es que regresa a su normalidad la memoria a corto plazo, o concetracion!<br>  <br>  Pero esto es un oxigenador no un medicamento para la memoria!<br>  <br>  ufff algo largo espero no hacerte bolas y si tienes alguna duda dejame saber con gusto te ayudo|`|09a40f775db4fdbcf7564a3137bc9a12aa	Utiliza una agenda.

STd3geMxaa	if you dance a lot you may just have muscular legs. there are a couple of butt excercises you can do, but usually leg excercises like running only make them stronger, not skinnier, so the only thing you could do for that is lose weight. go to mypyramid.gov and plan out wat ur gonna eat for each day, and make sure ur max is 800 calories. also, junk food'll hurt you. the best thing to do is to really seriously not eat it, because if you eat one you'll want more. if ur thing is salty foods, my thing is sweet foods, and i reallly had to stop eating them- it's like withdrawl; at first it sux and then you get used to it. protein like chicken, fish etc. is a good healthy alternative to salty junk food, and fruits are a good alternative to sweet junk foods. so the next time u want junk food, try eating that instead. <br>  <br>  ok so for your butt:<br>  <br>  1. get in crawling position. raise your right leg 10 times like youre peeing on a fire hydrant. then switch. then kick your right leg straight out to the side 10 times, then switch. do that about 4 or 5 times. <br>  <br>  2. lie down on your back and stick your feet straight up in the air. then raise your legs higher up using your butt and NOT your arms. work to the point where you can do 100 in a row. it'll hurt like a mother at first.|`|qy7C8Ybvaa	do NOT listen to whoever told you to throw up. that will do nothing<br>  but ruin you and possibly make you gain weight.<br>  i think i have noticed jumping jacks really tone you calves<br>  to make them thin yet muscular. to get more muscular, do some<br>  squats for your thighs. for cardio, try running or skipping all in all.<br>  hope it helps, but by the way, you are probably not even<br>  that fat at all, so don't worry about it. <br>  there is nothing wrong with allowing youself junk food sometimes.|`|H66RHumIaa	Exercise <br>  Eat Healthy<br>  <br>  Try reading this article: <a href="http://shine.yahoo.com/channel/health/3-reasons-your-workouts-arent-working-376716/">http://shine.yahoo.com/channel/health/3-...</a><br>  <br>  It is about workouts that don't really work...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|BRnYseFKaa	ok they are fat because they are both musle and fat.<br>  <br>  obviously youd have a lot of muscle from all your dancing.<br>  <br>  get an exercise bike they are good|`|W7uP1ty4aa	This is easy.

Many ice skaters and gymnasts (I was both) have what we call "thunder thighs". Muscle weighs more than fat and you need the strength to do those things (i.e. dance and gymnastics).<br>  <br>  Everyone is shaped the way they are . . . usually by genetics. Your calves and butt are your area's. This may never change in your lifetime -- even if you were anorexic.<br>  <br>  I was fully anorexic and emaciated at the age of 20 (and it's bad), I still thought I had fat thighs!!! And I was 5'9" and weighed about 95 lbs!!!<br>  <br>  So, the secret to weight loss and keeping it off, if, indeed, you need to lose weight. If your height and weight are good for your age, etc., you would become sick if you become underweight.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the secret to health . . . is making a "lifetime change". Diets DO NOT WORK . . . it is changing your lifestyle!<br>  <br>  Eat healthy more often than not . . . <br>  Drink water more often than not . . .<br>  Exercise regularly . . . <br>  Do activities you enjoy . . . in short, live a full life that you like.<br>  <br>  The junk food, try to stop and if you do eat it . . .do not beat yourself up! Next time, just do better. If you mostly follow a healthy three square or six small square meals a day, exercise regularly and aim for better foods; and do this as a lifestyle -- the pounds will fall off (if you are overweight) or you will sustain the good weight you're at.<br>  <br>  Exercise can also trim the muscles and make you look better! Even if you're heavier (muscle weighs more than fat) -- you will appear more trim in good shape!<br>  <br>  Check with a doctor and the charts for the right weight for you height and type (small bone, big bone) at your age.<br>  <br>  Learn to love yourself as you are . . . calves and butt and all. You are you and fabulous exactly as you are at any time!!!<br>  <br>  Self-esteem is really the secret to life, weight, love, etc.<br>  <br>  Your need for "filler" foods (junk food) and such is because you are bored or lonely or down on yourself and you're trying to fill the void with sugar or salt or whatever you're missing.<br>  <br>  If you work on YOU, accepting and loving you (self-esteem), your need for junk food will subside, too.|`|ed91a955117a1d0b0075b73234b04531aa	I know it sucks but try eating less everyday and riding a bike or the elyptical machine at the gym bc it specializes in tightening up the calves and booty. Try limiting for fat to less then 50 grams a day and then lower once you get into it. It's not easy but you can do it!

xmWBzvNSaa	i used zovirax. it is an over the counter topical cream. just apply it 5 times for 4 days or until all the blisters have dried up. sometimes the cream could cause dryness on your lips, so to avoid any discomfort, always apply lip balm on your lips. i'd recommend burt's bees beeswax lip balm. if you can't stand the pain, take ibuprofen like nurofen. it really helps to relief the pain and itchiness. lysine 1000 mg might help in the process of recovery. i noticed i recovered faster when i take lysine. and don't forget, always wash your hands too especially after touching or accidentally touching the blisters.<br>  <br>  to prevent from getting frequent fever blisters, i recommend you to take a flu shot because fever blisters only come on when you're not feeling well. don't stress too much too. hope this helps.|`|QM0Ezfvnaa	You can get a medication called "L-Lysine" in 500 mg tablets. At the very first indication of an outbreak, take one daily till it is not there - it is a simple essential amino acid that can not hurt you. It will stop the thing or reduce the pain/appearance. Additionally, you can use Blistex ointment on the outbreak to reduce inflammation and aid healing. It is a form of Herpes that you will enjoy for life, get comfortable with a solution and keep it handy.|`|a3ce5dcedd3e461806ec66bb0ac57aa3aa	I know exactly what you feel like.

There's really nothing that can be done to fully get rid of fever blisters. You can get an ointment from your doctor, but always try to stay hydrated and whatever you do don't pick it. Make sure you keep it moist and don't let your lips get dry and cracked!!

Or just experiment since it's your first time.<br>  <br>  And the condoms depend on what you guys want.<br>  Flavored, or her pleasure. <br>  <br>  Good luck (:<br>  <br>  Also I'm being supportive cause I know if you're ready you don't want to hear BS from people. <br>  <br>  Once again Good luck.|`|speJXeIhaa	You sorted out a time and date? woah that's real romantic.So what is it? 7pm on tuesday ? lol sorry but you really need more than that,sounds like your just a kid who's gonna 'do it' while yr parents are out.Grow up a little first then you wont need to ask questions like this =)|`|dpgXzMenaa	For some girls, it hurts a lot... for others, only a little... for still others, it doesn't hurt at all. Same with bleeding... and there's no way to really know which it's going to be for you until it happens.<br>  <br>  You're ready for sex as soon as you want to do it *and* are comfortable and happy with the following... and if you're not comfortable with *all* of it - every word - you're probably not ready, no matter what age you are:<br>  <br>  First... really be *sure* you wanna "do it" with the guy you've chosen.<br>  <br>  You're a virgin, and your first full-on sex should be with someone you're really gonna want to *be* that intimate with for a while, and I don't just mean the physical intimacy of openly sharing your bodies and their reactions without shame... because there's a lot of mental and emotional stuff that comes with the hormones and hangups that fill the sexual territory between partners. You'll be MUCH better and happier for choosing such a person, even if that "while" only turns out to be a few weeks... trust me on this point, OK? <br>  <br>  First-timing can be pretty disappointing for girls, not just because it's often painful (at least at first), but also because nervousness and awkwardness for both of you can make it very difficult for *you* to concentrate on your own pleasure. You don't have to worry too much about *his* pleasure: except for some possible emotional stuff, he's going to enjoy it a *lot* - even his first time. Young men are lucky that way, sure, but it's also a very rare man indeed (but not at all a rare woman) who can have several orgasms in less than half an hour. :-)<br>  <br>  Advice? Tips? Good things to plan for and think about?<br>  <br>  Make sure you have lots of total privacy for quite a long time (three hours or more is a good idea) because not only might there be some uncomfortable, embarrassing or painful moments along the way, and maybe you'll want to try many different positions to make it as comfortable and pleasurable as you can, but there's also more to the first time than just "doing it", and you'll have a lot of stuff to talk about afterwards - you do *not* want any of this to be interrupted.<br>  <br>  When it comes to intercourse, tell your guy that *you* will be the one to say "stop" if anything's wrong (like pain, or even if you just chicken out) and that it's up to him to remember that when you tell him "stop".<br>  <br>  If it should happen that your first time *will* be painful, bracing yourself against pain will only make it worse. RELAX... as he enters you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to pee - this will relax your pelvic muscles and *greatly* diminish any discomfort or pain.<br>  <br>  Don't even *try* unless you're very turned on and very slippery... a couple of orgasms first by masturbating/oral (*before* intercourse!) will also help your vagina to be more relaxed, stretchier and more insistent on having something inside - and if you don't get very wet no matter how horny you are, have some water-based lube (KY, Astroglide, Wet or similar) handy and no matter what, go SLOW until you're comfortable.<br>  <br>  That lube will also help prevent breakage of the condom. Yes, the condom. Any good quality condom will do, and it must fit properly and be properly worn.  There's a name for people who rely on "pulling out" as a method of avoiding pregnancy: "parents"... or sometimes "parents with STDs".<br>  <br>  Any pain you may feel will go away in a few minutes to a couple of days (sometimes there's a little bruising), and after it's over with, each time will be *much* better if you stick to everything above.<br>  <br>  Oral sex is also fine any time at all for either person, at least if both of them are comfortable with it and enjoy it. Doing it until the person receiving has an orgasm is nicest, but that isn't necessary unless you both want it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  I'm a guy, and I'm almost 50 years old, but I would have benefited hugely from most of this advice myself the first time *I* had sex - at age 13. No regrets, but I know now that we both would have fared a lot better if we'd thought about these things even for a few days.<br>  <br>  Since then, I've raised 4 kids who've grown up to be fairly responsible and (more important) sexually healthy people. I'd *like* to think that their mothers and I were the ones who helped them to become that way.|`|WBJrzwKuaa	Let me ask you this...at 15, if the condom breaks, are you ready for a baby?  <br>  <br>  My honest opinion...wait.  I know that's not what you want to hear, and I know you think you're ready, but really, you're not.  Do yourself, your boyfriend, and your family a favor and wait.  You have your entire life ahead of you...and trust me...it will be so much better if you wait until you know you're with the person you're going to spend the rest of your life with (your husband).<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|yZSjGytpaa	Stick to the age of consent set by the government in your country.|`|YQu5byWVaa	Lie on the bed and kiss eachother.  him on top/ you on top/ side by side... whatever, just KISS.<br>  <br>  If after 5 or 10 mins this is driving you crazy (your kissing just seems to get faster and more intense, you cant stop runnin your hands over his body) then you sound like your ready.  Being ready is not just something mental (thinkin yeah im ready for sex) but also something physical, like an urge.<br>  <br>  If after 10 minutes the kissing seems a bit forced and you dont feel at all excited... if you kinda feel stiff...  then your not ready.<br>  <br>  Anyways..... if you are totally driven crazy after 10 mins, then just keep kissing, perhaps take eachothers clothes off so your hands can move around easier,  DONT RUSH  just kiss and explore eachothers bodies for a good half an hour / 40 mins.<br>  <br>  If after this time you cant bear it any longer, then suggest he puts a condom on!!  Also i'd suggest lube, especially for your first time.  (if your too embarresd to suggest this to your boyfriend then your not ready)<br>  <br>  If you do feel a bit embarsed about it, get some 2 in one massage gel and lubricant.  suggest you give him a massage with it, it will make it easier for you to explore his body this way aswell.<br>  <br>  As its you first time id suggest plain old missionary.  HIm on top.  It may hurt abit, which is why the lube will help.  Tell him to go slow at first etc.<br>  <br>  Put a pillow under your bum once you start gettin into it! it should make it feel better.

It will take time to build muscle and lose the small amount of fat you do have. It would be best to consult a personal fitness trainer, pe teacher, coach or trainer at a gym to have an evaluation and set up a fitness routine. Then you can check back in at least once a month to evaluate your progress and adjust your routine to maximize your results! Your hard work will show great results! Good luck!|`|NAwzuLayaa	It should take you about a month, a month in a half. <br>  <br>  Work on innercore muscles by doing crunches daily.

Cheese is derived from milk- after churning the milk for a while- so I guess it contains lactose as well.<br>  <br>  I have found with me, that by increasing the fibre in my diet, it has helped me with the IBS symptoms a lot. I can now tolerate all dairy products.
AA12066269	To the untrained eye, it is hard to read an ultrasound.  The technician doing the exam cannot tell you the results as they are not physicians.  They can explain that they are taking measurements or looking a different angles of the same feature.<br>  <br>  A polyp may or may not be serious and an ultrasound is not always a good diagnostic tool to determine ovarian cancer.  It can determine if you have cysts or other growths but not confirm cancer.
CciXZNYraa	Try these exercises;<br>  <br>  Sit ups: Please note that sit-ups can be a strenuous activity on the lower back. Understanding how to get a six pack and not damage yourself in the process is critical. Do not strain yourself; build up this type of exercise slowly. Twisting during this exercise (left elbow to right knee) is NOT effective and put the lower back under tremendous stress. If you feel even the slightest twinge, then stop. <br>  In order to strengthen your abs, care and technique are necessary. Effective sit-ups need to pull the torso towards the knees from a lying position only using the abdominal group of muscles. If you have your legs straight on the floor then more powerful muscles in the legs will do most of the work.<br>  To counteract this you should bend your knees while sitting up and so make the abdominal muscles feel the burn. If you gather a momentum you will not be working the muscles effectively. Only by slowly raising and lowering will you achieve the best results. <br>  <br>  Leg lifts: The challenge with this exercise is to keep your legs straight and not to let your feet touch the floor. <br>  Lie of the floor with your hands by your sides. Keeping your legs straight lift them to 90 Degree and back down but to do allow then to touch the ground, repeat back to the 90 degrees position. <br>  <br>  Jacknife Sit-ups: Discover how to get a six pack the hard way with this intense workout.<br>  Start as you would in the position to do sit-ups with your hands at your sides. <br>  Without bending your knees, simultaneously lift you legs in the air and your head and shoulder so that your whole body makes a V-shape. If you can manage it the try to touch your toes. <br>  Then relax and go back to the starting position. <br>  <br>  V-ups: This exercise requires good balance and strong core muscles. It can be performed on a bench but can also be carried out on a mat on the floor(but don't let those legs touch the floor).<br>  Bending your knees, simultaneously lift your legs and your torso so they form a V as you can see from the photo. Then go back to the relax position, during this exercise you arms should remain horizontal. <br>  <br>  The Static hold: Get into the push-up position but with your forearms touching the ground. Make sure your body is a straight line from your shoulders down to your toes and hold that position for a minimum of 1 minute. <br>  This exercise strengthen your core abdominal muscles. Repeat this exercise more and more as you strengthen the core muscles. <br>  <br>  Understanding how to get a six pack through strengthening your core muscles is key to achieving great abs!|`|iAv9P3HTaa	A "quick" way to get abs is in the combination of diet and exercises.<br>  It depends on body fat with males it starts showing under 10%.<br>  These exercises much more effective then push ups or sit ups:<br>  <br>  <br>  Ball Crunch<br>  Lie with the ball resting under the mid/lower back and place hands behind the head or across the chest. Contract your abs to lift your the torso off the ball, pulling the bottom of your ribcage down toward your hips. As you curl up, keep the ball stable.<br>  <br>  <br>  Crunch & Reach<br>  Begin with body straight over the ball, light weight extended behind you (not shown). Contract the abs to lift and bring the weight over the head, crunching up and twisting to the right, contracting the right side of waist. Repeat for all reps and then switch sides.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Modified Plank<br>  Begin by placing elbows on the floor and resting body on the knees. Pull the abs tight to hold your body in a straight line from head to knees without sagging in the middle, eyes looking naturally forward. Hold this position for as long as you can, relax and repeat 3 or more times.<br>  <br>  <br>  Knee Tucks<br>  Start in plank position on the ball, with the ball under the shins/ankles. Roll the ball towards you with your feet, tightening the abs into a crunch.<br>  <br>  <br>  Woodchops<br>  Attach one end of a resistance band to something sturdy and wrap the band around your hand a few times for the right tension. Grasp the band in both hands and begin in a lunge position, reaching down with the arms Keeping the arms straight the entire time, rotate and lift the body towards the other side while sweeping the arms on a diagonal. Return to start and repeat before moving onto the other side.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hip Extension on the Ball<br>  Lie on the floor with feet heels propped on ball. Keeping abs tight, slowly lift your hips off the floor (squeezing the buttocks) until body is in a straight line. Hold for a few seconds and lower<br>  <br>  <br>  Ball Taps<br>  Sit on the ball with strong abs and straight spine, hands behind the head. Contract your abs and lift the right foot, tapping it on a medicine ball in front of you. Lower and repeat with the other foot, alternating sides. Use your abs to keep your balance.<br>  <br>  How to Work Your Abs<br>  <br>  * You can effectively work your abs with 3 non-consecutive workouts a week<br>  * Do 1-3 sets of 12-16 reps of each exercise. If that's too easy, make sure you're doing each exercise correctly and using perfect form. You can add a dumbbell or plate to crunches to add difficulty.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|cKSbZBt8aa	Eat more vegetables for fibre to fight fat tissue.

uSGEKuL9aa	This is something that is dangerous in and of it self . <br>  One thing you may wish to do is to seek medical care to rule out any facial injuries that may have been incurred . A lot of the removal depends on the type of paint he was using .Generally you can use soap and water and a loofah sponge to remove it .  You can use baby oil or even cooking oils . But use caution around the eyes, nose and mouth . In a worse case scenario you can use paint remover but be sure to have some one help him and also to have set up a wash station to prevent chemical burns ... This is a last resort and should not be used unless it is absolutely needed and not recommend at all ..

Don't do it super fast or super slow.  You can turn your legs a little if you need to.  Also, bicycle crunches are supposed to be good.  (Lay on your back with your hands locked behind your head, then lean forward like a crunch.  Move your legs like you're riding a bicycle and have one elbow point towards the opposite knee.  So as your left knee comes up, your right elbow show be almost touching it.  Don't focus so much on the crunch motion as just twisting your upper body.

vpya9hhOaa	well it will stretch and distort if your body changes, but there are places on your body that are less likely to fluctuate much in size such as your lower back or calf.  I got a tatoo at 18 on my lower hip and have since lost a bit of weight.  It has changed in shape slightly but the tatoo is simple so it doesn't interfere much with its overall affect.  I am aware, however, that pregnancy will drastically change my tatoo, I have come to terms with that.  I'd say when you go in for your tat, discuss your concerns with the artist, they know what they're doing and can best advise you.  Be aware that you will need a parents consent to get a tatoo until you are 18 years old.

STzBQYu4aa	well i am kinda in a situation like that just a few steps behind. I have gotten to the point that i have held a knife in one hand and cried, aching inside. But i am doing a little better now...but this isn't about me. <br>   you need to sit her down and just say it to her face. don;t pamper her or beat around the bush. The way she reacts you can't control. but you need to make a plan for every senario. For example-  <br>  <br>  you sit her down and say mom, i need help. I have been depressed since dad left and i cut. i can't help it and i am coming to you for help....<br>  <br>  she may-freak out and call you dad and if that happens be patient(since you are a daddy's girl this may be a good thing)<br>  <br>  she may freak out and scream at you.... this will be hard but just bite your lip and let her finish. don't interupt her because this will get her fired up and yell more.... make sure she knows that you NEED her help, this will make her feel important and like she is part of your life<br>  <br>  she may began to cry and blame herself... this is the awkward reaction... you might feel really guilty and if that is the case then just let her cry it out a bit. if you don't then explain to her that no matter what happened in the past i need you know and i want you to help me.<br>  <br>  <br>  with all of these constantly are emphasizing your need for her. which is really important, she is your mom and wants to help her. sometimes she just needs you hand to reach out to her.<br>  <br>  i hope i helped :)|`|4yrqRS4qaa	tell your mom that you need some help. from what you are saying she knows. if she starts freaking out, tell your mom that you need her to stop and calm down cause you really need her right now.<br>  <br>  write it down and let her process the info and then when she is ready to talk calm with you....maybe?<br>  <br>  knowing you need help is a good thing<br>  good luck|`|3ziavvdvaa	just have a little chat with your mum saying that you miss your dad and all those problems then if she dont do nothing then get on the phone call the doctor and he can give you some depresson tablets .<br>  just keep your head high girl xxxxxxx|`|CAAglUKzaa	Wow. It sounds like you are in a really depressed. I'm really sorry about what happened. Well, considering she's your mom,and you want to tell her, set her down and let her know what has been going on.

Anything that makes your nose run and loosens mucus in chest does this...such as hot and sour soup, very spicy tacos, etc!<br>  But, as I say, it is probably too late for you now.

You may want to take a test just to make sure, but like I said it's probably just spotting and nothing to worry about.  You could start charting your cycle though.

In nature you only have one purpose...to impregnate as many females of the species as your body will allow.  Your body is reacting to the hormones you are now manufacturing in bountiful amounts.  You are READY to procreate as far survival of the species is concerned.  You are NOT gay!  You are just READY!  You probably can't do much to tone it down, though many will suggest that more frequent masturbation discharges some of the hormones which are raging.  I also suggest tighter underwear.  I know you find it difficult to be proud of your erections, but you should be.  They mark a significant maturation of your body...girls get periods, boys get spontaneous erections, go figure!|`|AA10350894	It's just all part of being a dude, get used to it.|`|dfJ8yM4Qaa	welcome to the wonders and mysteries of puberty.It's normal dude.|`|3DmwSkdnaa	It's normal|`|lvBXds5Baa	Why is your name beth?|`|rc52fIZQaa	It is very common while you're a teen.

MS is a disease that causes emotional, cognitive as well as physical problems and there is a large arsenal of pharmaceuticals that doctors employ to treat symptoms. I use a drug called low dose naltrexone which is currently used as an off label therapeutic treatment for MS. It is very inexpensive yet effective. It is currently in drug trials around the world. I get a three month supply of LDN for $52.00 a month. It works wonders for my MS. I took Copaxone for a number of years, but LDN works far better for me as well as for other MS patients. The interferons are well known for magnifying depression. They also are ridiculously expensive at over a thousand dollars a month. Copaxone now costs two thousand dollars a month. While the drug companies claim these treatments  are effective in treatment 50% of the time in reality they help 30% of the time which is a pretty horrible return on a patient's investment in my opinion. You could try asking if his doctor will try prescribing LDN. I doubt that it is available in Cuba, though.

You need to find out if there is anything that you are using that is causing an allergic reaction. When you do find out what is causing it, stop using it.  When you do, you will notice that that will solve the problem.  Your breakout will stop and you will get better.  I know someone who loved to eat peanut butter as well as like to use butter or margarine, but did not realize that he was allergic to both of them.  I began to notice that after he ate those food, he began to break out all over his face.  Then I realized he must be allergic to peanut butter and margarine.  So I told him to stop eating them and see if his face would clear up.  He did not eat peanut butter again and then his face started to clear up and got better.  But when he went back and started eating the peanut butter again after a few days, his face broke out again.  And that was when we both realized that he truly was allergic to peanut butter and from then on he stopped using peanut butter and that solved his break out problem.  Best Wishes.|`|dBg1smAKaa	I had a serious pimple problem a while back and went to a doctor who prescribed me some cream.

If the person refuses to keep their eyes closed, then they tape them.|`|TsjqzanQaa	I'm not sure what the criteria are about taping eyes shut, but if they are open, they can remain open for extended periods without blinking, due to the nature of the anaesthetics, and this would dry the eyes out.|`|YXpmzeVqaa	The length of surgical time is usually the deciding factor. Under some forms of anesthesia you will automatically "sleep" if it is a long surgery and your eyes do not remain shut the surgical team will tape them to maintain natural wetness.

They won't call and tell you that you DON'T have HIV but if you do get a call then just prepare for them to test you again becuse if it's positive they will certainly test you twice if not more.

I know you're asking about friends, not dates, but the same rule applies.  Do you friends act nice to some people's faces but talk bad about them when they aren't around?  They may not be truthful generally.<br>  <br>  For specific incedences, ask for particular details.  If what they say doesn't add up or they contradict themselves, or if they change the subject without answering you they may be lying.<br>  <br>  I say they MAY be lying because there are other reasons for people acting secretive.  They may be hiding something in thier lives they are ashamed of or simpley want to keep private.<br>  <br>  If you think these people are just being deceptive and mean, then they are not really your friends.|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	Get right in their face and look them straight in the eye.

b95d3948683c7afd43c89eba8e412306aa	I think more than what you are explaining is going on. We sometimes have things from the past we can not let go of because we have punished or set ourselves up for failure. A lot of things from the past we may not be the blame for we were children. <br>  <br>        If we have had experiences of abuse no matter if it was verbal, physical, sexual. we must be survivor's not victims. We can be overwhelmed from little mistakes to serious ones. We have to close the door of the past either from family or friends not completely so we don't make the same mistakes twice because we are to busy making new ones.<br>  <br>       We are own worst critic and harder on ourselves then anyone else in the world. You need a lot of healing from the past and present with the help of someone you can trust in your family, friend, therapist, a religious person that you trust but you have to talk to someone to get it all out in the open and out of your head, believe me it won't happen overnight.<br>  <br>       I am one of the people who ran away from my life looking for happiness and moved place to place to start over, but happiness is with-in. I did not believe in God because I blame him or her and others for my problems.

Pray at night to a Higher Power grater then yourself about everything so you can let some of the pain come out.<br>     You are a great person and heal and get your self together by what ever means even going to a counselor. You may have what we call P.T.S.D. post traumatic stress disorder things from the past can be triggered by a person's comment, T.V. music , seeing someone that reminds you of the past.

Not eating properly can lead to dehydration, fatigue, black-outs, and feeling ill when hungry. <br>  <br>  Eating a lot does no good unless you're eating RIGHT. <br>  <br>  Try to eat at least three good sized meals a day, if not many smaller meals to keep your body energized. Don't skip any meals. Make sure the foods that you are eating are high in nutrients and low in things that are bad for you. Go for more natural products rather than processed foods. And drink plenty of water.<br>  <br>  Not gaining weight when you eat a lot could simply mean you have a strong metabolism. <br>  <br>  If you're seriously concerned with your symptoms, I'd suggest seeing a physician.

e37266640e6a59a1eb9c2f61b716f284aa	I bought the book EAT RIGHT FOR YOUR BLOOD TYPE, by PETER D'ADAMO..<br>  <br>  I am having a great succes and was weighing 220lbs..now 195lbs without all the exercising and starvation.<br>  <br>  It works as food is good but not all foods are good for our blood type and will cause fat to accumulate as the body fights to kill the lectines that cause us fat and diseases and allergies etc.<br>  <br>  Of course adding exercise, like just walking does work. People are amazed at how I am losing and you don't have hanging skin. Plus people are asking me if I got a face lift because I look so much younger.  <br>  <br>  Now try this and you won't regret it plus it is a real adventure trying new foods that are suitable to you.  Of course if there is a food that is good for your blood type but doesnt agree with your stomach because you have stomach problems, you don't eat it.  <br>  <br>  It works for me and many others I have reccommended it because I hate diets, I can't stick to them and have bad knees to exercise.|`|AA10851402	Yes, I did. I lost 28 lbs.  Only the first 3 days were difficult. That was because my body was craving all the sweets and carbs it was used to digesting.<br>  It works best if you do your shopping first. That way you have the acceptable foods in the cupboard, and you won't be tempted to eat the other stuff.<br>  If you keep your effective carbs (total carbs, minus fiber carbs, and minus alcohol sugar carbs) to 20 or less a day, and drink 8 glasses of water a day, you will notice the weight comes off nice and quick.<br>  I stuck to salads and meat, eggs and bacon (yes, you can eat bacon), and it came off at about 5-7 lbs a week.<br>  People say that once you stop the diet the weight comes right back. In my opinion, this only happens if you go right back to your old eating habits of carbs and sweets. You don't have to totally eliminate them from your diet from now on, just keep them at a minimum.<br>  Healthy eating is a lifestyle, and a choice. Make your decision, then stick to it.  It's up to you. Good luck.|`|AA11401988	I couldn't stick to Atkins but I am having pretty good success as sticking to the concept of eating low-glycemic carbs (not sure what diet that is--South Beach?).<br>  <br>  From what I've learned from years of dieting, sugar and high-glycemic carbs are the worst thing you can eat for a number of reasons (can increase chances of becoming diabetic, induces hunger and thus is counter-productive for diets, etc.). <br>  <br>  By low-glycemic, I mean whole-grains and not white and not sugars but more like sugar substitutes or proteins.|`|8286e13ae3bb48ad0e25f0f05d80b2d2aa	Yes, I lost about 8-10lbs in two weeks on the South Beach Diet (which is the point of the first 2 weeks). It really reduces belly fat. It was kind of hard at first because you crave that bread and sugar but after day 3 you are less dependent on it. You really have to stick to it though because the minute you start eating bread again you gain the weight you lost back plus a little more.  It's a gradual thing. You can't go hard on it, ease yourself into the diet and if you decide you want to eat carbs again, ease yourself back onto them so you don't gain the weight back. Try cardio also with the low carb diet, you'll see results in no time.
f7d33c04a72a7226a9f74dd65f7f929faa	The following healthy living recommendations will help you if you’re trying to lose weight, tone up your muscles, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:<br>  <br>  *1) Burn more calories then you're consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity minus the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF). A website that explains this formula in more detail and will help you determine how many calories you need to reach or maintain a certain weight is at <a href="http://www.primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/library/weight/calsburned.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/...</a><br>  <br>  Get a diet and fitness calculator that you can put on your computer or cell phone.

If you burn through exercise 500 more calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. <br>  <br>  *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement. <br>  <br>  Avoid “High Glycemic Load Carbs” (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as potatoes) and drink lots of water.

There are hundreds of household products on the market today that can be misused as inhalants. <br>  <br>  <br>  What do they look like? <br>  Examples of products kids abuse to get high include model airplane glue, nail polish remover, cleaning fluids, hair spray, gasoline, the propellant in aerosol whipped cream, spray paint, fabric protector, air conditioner fluid (freon), cooking spray and correction fluid. <br>  How are they used? <br>  These products are sniffed, snorted, bagged (fumes inhaled from a plastic bag), or "huffed" (inhalant-soaked rag, sock, or roll of toilet paper in the mouth) to achieve a high. Inhalants are also sniffed directly from the container. <br>  What are their short-term effects? <br>  Within seconds of inhalation, the user experiences intoxication along with other effects similar to those produced by alcohol. Alcohol-like effects may include slurred speech, an inability to coordinate movements, dizziness, confusion and delirium. Nausea and vomiting are other common side effects. In addition, users may experience lightheadedness, hallucinations, and delusions. <br>  <br>  What are their long-term effects? <br>  Compulsive use and a mild withdrawal syndrome can occur with long-term inhalant abuse. Additional symptoms exhibited by long-term inhalant abusers include weight loss, muscle weakness, disorientation, inattentiveness, lack of coordination, irritability, and depression. <br>  <br>  After heavy use of inhalants, abusers may feel drowsy for several hours and experience a lingering headache. Because intoxication lasts only a few minutes, abusers frequently seek to prolong their high by continuing to inhale repeatedly over the course of several hours. By doing this, abusers can suffer loss of consciousness and death. <br>  <br>  What is their federal classification? <br>  Schedule I <br>  <br>  STORY ONE - Megan Hakeman's Huffing addiction<br>  <br>  I never thought it could happen to me. Becoming addicted to inhalants was not a plan that I had. I had a pretty good childhood, playing sports and hanging out with my brother and neighborhood friends. My mom and I were close, and we would spend quite a bit of time together. <br>  <br>  My family lives in a fairly small, close-knit community where there were always fun activities planned for the kids. When I was 12 years old and entering seventh grade, when most kids anticipate new and exciting adventures, my life went down hill. I, Megan - you know, the girl next door - had many problems. Although a lot of teens probably feel as though they have problems, mine were rooted in something that wasn't my fault: sexual abuse. Dealing with something such as this, alone, is virtually an impossible task, and at the time, it felt impossible to overcome. Therefore, I needed to cope. Life was becoming too much for me, and when I was offered help to begin a healing process, I refused it. I felt nothing at that time would help, until I encountered drugs. <br>  <br>  Shortly after my 13th birthday, an older kid in the neighborhood who knew I was struggling offered me some weed. He thought it would help. So did I. It really seemed as though getting high was helping me forget my problems. Although, without even noticing, soon, I needed more drugs to get high. That's when I began huffing - you know, inhaling various household products to get high. I inhaled almost anything I could get my hands on - computer cleaner, air freshener, various spray bottles, etc - so that I could get high. <br>  <br>  My parents knew something wasn't right, and they would drag me to counseling. I learned though that when one starts inhaling, he or she can be very sneaky so that they don't lose an opportunity to get high. Honestly, I was a great manipulator. I even had the counselors fooled. I would sit there with my arms crossed for an hour - not listening to a word they had to say. I just wanted to continue my huffing. <br>  <br>  I enjoyed huffing because it was cheap, an easy high to obtain, and in 20 minutes my high would be gone so no one would know. Inhalants took up so much of my time, thoughts and energy that I didn't realize my life was getting totally out of control. Huffing was becoming a big problem, and an everyday occurrence. I did it alone, I did it with friends, I did it when I felt sad, lonely or scared - even when I was happy. It was my escape. I did it anytime - I didn't care about family, friends, life or anything. <br>  <br>  It was inevitable that my family would learn of my abuse. I couldn't hide it anymore. That's when my parents sent me to treatment for my huffing addiction. For the first month, I hated treatment and I hated my parents. It wasn't until I completed the initial month that I realized this is what I needed if I wanted to stay alive. <br>  <br>  When I entered treatment at age 14, I definitely wasn't the same girl, Megan, who lived next door. In treatment I learned how to communicate my feelings instead of hiding from them through drugs. That was a major problem for me - any time there was a problem, I thought if I got high it would go away. Even though I hated treatment for the first month, it was the best thing that could have happened, because I changed in so many ways. Now, I am able to talk about my thoughts and feelings, instead of covering them up. I was in treatment for three months, and actually, I feel lucky. In fact, I know I am lucky. Huffing could have killed me. I started to huff when I was 13 years old...that's too young to do a lot of things, including becoming an addict, or dying. <br>  <br>  I recently celebrated my 15th birthday, as a sober, healthy high school student and to be honest, staying sober can be challenging at times. Kids in school definitely huff to get high, and some even ask me to participate even though they know what I've been through. Trust me, I have no plans to ever get high again. I never want to go through that nightmare again. <br>  <br>  An important lesson I learned when I got out of treatment was that my supposed friends who I used to get high with only liked me when I was high. I also realized that I didn't like me when I was high. <br>  <br>  --Megan Hakeman<br>  <a href="http://www.drugfree.org/portal/stories/t..." rel="nofollow">http://www.drugfree.org/portal/stories/t...</a><br>  <br>  STORY TWO - Jeny's Story<br>  <br>  A Common Cleaning Product Killed My Daughter<br>  <br>  If I could just take a few minutes of your time and hopefully spare another family the nightmare that my family will now live for the rest of our lives. My name is Kelli and my daughter's name was Jeny. <br>  <br>  On March 25, at 10:30 p.m., we received a call from the hospital telling us that Jeny had been in an accident. They wouldn't tell me she was okay, just to get to the hospital. After driving 15 miles to get there, we weren't allowed to see her and couldn't find out if she was okay. We waited two hours before a police officer took us to another room. He showed us a cleaning product. He said the driver of the car had "huffed" it. <br>  <br>  We had no idea of what he was talking about - never heard of huffing. The driver of the car had inhaled the cleaner and immediately passed out. The car went down an embankment, across interstate 75 and hit the cement divider in the medium. The driver and the two passengers in the backseat walked away. Jeny's head went through the windshield and hit the divider. She died immediately. <br>  <br>  Jeny was an A-B student, popular in her school, loved life - and I know she would have never tried inhalants had she known the danger and especially riding with someone who was driving and inhaling. They were just "having fun". We never got to say goodbye to Jeny. In a matter of minutes, her life was cruelly taken away. So, for the parents reading this, please, know what your child is doing, and educate yourself about inhalants. It's a drug and it's dangerous. For the kids out there reading this, please, don't be stupid. <br>  <br>  Don't think inhalants can't hurt you, because they can and they kill. Don't allow your parents to go through the nightmare that we are now living. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cnoa.org/N-07.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnoa.org/N-07.pdf</a> <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.drugfree.org/portal/drug_guid..." rel="nofollow">http://www.drugfree.org/portal/drug_guid...</a>|`|964f8cb90ab06692ed3ba46b64d2364baa	cough syrup, specifically Robotussion has stuff in it that effects you like LSD.

Si tomas antibióticos, mermas tu capacidad defensiva frente a la nueva enfermedad para la que eres más vulnerable.<br>  El tiempo dice que algunos medicamentos, que incluso te curaron una vez, van a ser prohibidos.<br>  Los médicos en Estados Unidos, por ejemplo, (donde se pagan indemnizaciones atroces por errores médicos) jamás te recetan un antibiótico, casi casi, salvo que estés hospitalizado y bajo vigilancia 24 horas. Por algo será.<br>  Los médicos espa?oles, sin embargo, no se les cae la mano por firmar la receta de lo que el paciente pide (Eso, yo creo que es automedicación). Por cierto, alguno (más de uno, vaya que más de uno) conozco que se ha ido las navidades enteras al Caribe (A Japón, a Canadá, a Estados Unidos, a Grecia, a Argentina...)con toda la familia a cargo de un laboratorio con la excusa de un congreso. Alguna razón (económica) habrá.<br>  Y esa razón económica es la última observación. Curarte, casi seguro que te curas. Muy pocas veces una enfermedad es incurable sin medicinas. Si no las tomas, en general te curas igual. Pero ni el médico te receta, ni los laboratorios ganan, ni el farmacéutico interviene.<br>  Y tras lo dicho, recordad que "consulte a su farmacéutico" es una gran atrocidad. ?Cómo es que un se?or que está en una tienda, sin tus antecedentes clínicos, es capaz de instigarte a que le compres a EL, lo que te vende y que te puede afectar tu salud?<br>  Yo prefería el "consulte a su médico", pese a que la consulta no era gratis.|`|91b4fdf7692dc69c17731c3f5fecc23baa	Todo en exceso es malo, los antibióticos en exceso pueden provocar que el los virus se hagan resistentes a la composición del antibiótico, por otra parte el organismo tiene que disolver los componentes del antibiótico pudiendo provocar en el peor de los casos reflujo gastroesofágico, en el organismo puede provocar alergias a alguno de sus componentes e intoxicación si tienes intolerancia a ellos ,los medicamentos tienen una peque?a parte que se queda siempre en el cuerpo unos días, por ello pueden hacer reacción con otros medicamentos que te estes tomando así que nunca debes automedicarte y debes consultar a tu médico.<br>  Tienes que saber que un exceso de antibióticos se puede considerar el tomarlos todos los días, tal y como tú los tomas que es dos veces al a?o no son perjudiciales en absoluto, no hay que ser reacio a la toma de medicación aunque creamos que "no nos pasa nada" y "ya se nos pasará".

Digamos que los antibióticos son realmente eficaces frente a infecciones bacterianas (por ejemplo, pneumonia). Si cierta gente se automedica con antibiótico en una gripe (que es una enfermedad de origen viral) no solamente no estará combatiendo eficazmente esa gripe, sino que estará atacando con esos antibioticos a las bacterias de su organismo (muchas de ellas son benignas, incluso sin ellas no podríamos digerir multitud de alimentos). Y cuando se ataca repetidas veces con antibioticos a las bacterias (se ataca a las benignas y a las malignas, no hay discriminacion en ese sentido), y partiendo de la base de que se reproducen con mucha rapidez, puede que desarrollen algunas de ellas resistencia a ese antibiotico. Es un hecho practicamente imposible si te ci?es al tratamiento indicado por tu medico. Pero si te automedicas, corres ese riesgo, y si la bacteria que se hace resistente es causante de enfermedades, ya tendrías un antibiótico menos para usar de la bateria de los existentes para atacar esa enfermedad.<br>  <br>  La verdad es que me he enrollado a saco, pero espero que entiendas lo que quiero expresar|`|caa851de37bbacccb82310c5206257b3aa	Son varios, pero el primero y mas peligroso es que el tomar un exceso del mismo sin un control adecuado puede tener efectos contrarios, a sus principios activos.<br>  <br>  Consejo consulta siempre con tu medico de cabecera cuando te notes algo extra?o, o creas que estas tomando un exceso pues los antibióticos no son simples aspirinas hay que controlarlos mucho.|`|4185698a0e5d98b5d574225456cdf9a1aa	Los antibióticos, como todo medicamento, pueden presentar efectos secundarios indeseables, pero uno de los principales peligros del uso abusivo de antibióticos es la aparición de cepas de microbios resistentes a ellos.

También existe el examen llamado el Test de Elisa la cual diagnostica el sida rápidamente. Por eso amigo debemos de ser menos promiscuos, saber con que tipo de persona estamos y sobre todo CUIDARNOS NUESTRA SALUD SEXUAL. Como? poniéndonos protección en las relaciones sexuales con PROFILáCTICOS, CONDONES O PRESERVATIVOS. Saber con que tipo de personas estamos, tener pareja fija. Y así evitaríamos tantos sufrimientos. Aunque en cuanto a tu tío y novia, si le detectaron el sida a tiempo, ahora hay tratamientos que los ayudan como el coctel o coktail de varios tipos de píldoras que le recetan y muchos han mejorado su calidad de vida.

GAea2ZACaa	Headaches are a common side effect of sulfasalazine. <br>  <br>  Sulfasalazine is broken down by bacteria in the colon into 5-ASA (the active ingredient) and sulfapyridine, which is inactive. However, it is the sulfapyridine which is thought to be responsible for many of the common side effects of sulfasalazine. Some people develop true allergic reactions to the sulfapyridine portion of sulfasalazine and these can be quite serious.<br>  <br>  You basically have two options:<br>  1) temporarily lower the dose and then gradually increase it back to your current dose; this seems to help with headaches in some people.<br>  2) there are a number of newer medications that contain 5-ASA but not the sulfapyridine portion. Although you may still have a headache with another 5-ASA product, there is a good chance that your headaches are caused by the sulfapyridine portion.<br>  <br>  If you have a bad headache to sulfasalazine I would speak to your gastroenterologist about which of these two options is better for you. There is no need to suffer with these headaches!|`|6cc21c291d322fb70d7ae1e0e240cb56aa	Yes, Sulfasalazine does causes you headaches.   Well, try this. Slice some fresh ginger (rounded like coins), put them on a piece of cloth. (The cloth should be long enough to be tied around your head). Tie this cloth around your head tightly, as tight as you can. It does help. <br>  <br>  Or try visualization, close your eyes and imagine you're somewhere nice and relaxing, try breathing slowly and imagine your pain fly away.  <br>  <br>  Been there, done that.

AA11103615	My daughter has Lupus and  takes prescribed aspirin every day to thin her blood<br>   Aspirin has been proven to prevent a first and second heart attack in people who have coronary artery disease.<br>  <br>   1 When taken during and after a heart attack, aspirin can reduce your chances of dying. <br>  2 It also reduces the risk of having a stroke in those who have had a previous stroke or a transient ischemic attack (a temporary interruption of blood flow to the brain), which is often a warning sign of an impending stroke. <br>  <br>  <br>  Some experts recommend an aspirin a day to prevent heart problems for: <br>  <br>  Men older than 40 years. <br>  Postmenopausal women, which begins 1 year after the last menstrual period. <br>  Men younger than 40 or premenopausal women who have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, or a history of smoking. <br>  Also, if you have had a clot-related stroke or transient ischemic attack, your health professional will probably recommend that you take an aspirin daily. Aspirin protects you from having a clot-related stroke in the same way it protects you from having a heart attack. <br>  <br>  Aspirin slows the blood's clotting action by reducing the clumping of platelets. Platelets are cells that clump together and help to form blood clots. Aspirin keeps platelets from clumping together, thus helping to prevent or reduce blood clots.<br>  <br>  During a heart attack, blood clots form in an already-narrowed artery and block the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle (or to part of the brain, in the case of stroke). When taken during a heart attack, aspirin slows clotting and decreases the size of the forming blood clot. Taken daily, aspirin's anti-clotting action helps prevent a first or second heart attack.<br>  <br>  Aspirin should not be taken if you think you are having a stroke, because not all strokes are caused by clots. Aspirin could make some strokes worse. <br>  <br>  Daily aspirin is not right for everyone. Don't start taking aspirin regularly without talking to your health professional first. Aspirin's anti-clotting action can cause unwanted side effects such as stomach bleeding and bleeding in the brain. People who have stomach ulcers, a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, blood-clotting disorders, uncontrolled high blood pressure, and liver or kidney disease may need to avoid aspirin.<br>  <br>  Aspirin should not be taken by people who are at risk for or who have had a hemorrhagic stroke, which is a type of stroke that is not caused by a blood clot but rather by bleeding into and around the brain.<br>  <br>  Aspirin can trigger asthma attacks in some people who have a sensitivity to it.<br>  <br>  Also, don't take aspirin without first talking to your health professional if you're already taking prescribed blood thinners, such as Coumadin. The combined effect could cause bleeding problems.<br>  <br>  Drinking 3 or more alcoholic drinks every day while taking daily aspirin increases your risk for liver damage and stomach bleeding. If your health professional recommends aspirin, limit or stop alcohol usage.<br>  <br>  Aspirin should not be taken with many prescription and over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, herbal remedies, and supplements. Talk to your health professional about all the drugs and other remedies you take before starting aspirin therapy.<br>  <br>  Because aspirin reduces your blood's ability to clot, your health professional may want you to stop taking aspirin at least 5 days before any surgery or dental procedure that may cause bleeding. Don't suddenly stop taking aspirin without talking to your health professional first.<br>  <br>  Early studies suggest that aspirin may reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. However, more research is needed before doctors begin recommending aspirin to prevent Alzheimer's disease.|`|90b2e1cf6f3afb97a6c305416724aee2aa	Aspirin all the time is only taken by people with heart problems and clogged arteries. and if you take it all the time you could put a hole in your stomach lining.

Your friend needs help but will be embarrassed and almost certainly resist. depending on her age i would suggest talking to her parents and asking them for advice. you must remember self harming is an immensely personal thing and rarely seems to be done for attention. The pills my friend was on took a while to kick in and then they have to tailor the dosage so the sooner your Friend gets to the docs the better. once she's on the right happy pills it's fairly simply a matter of managing the illness. <br>  I wish you the best of luck getting through to her.<br>  My god i had a time of it!

b959c1bacc75d8acf50a00e99fc88981aa	The idea that your body burns stored fat as fuel, when it can't get enough energy from your food, IS A MYTH.<br>  <br>  Fat is not stored in a burnable form (it's more like soap), and energy is needed to release it from storage. So if you are short of energy, you will not be able to work as hard, or keep the intensity up for as long.<br>  <br>  Eating lightly about half an hour before working out is ideal. You should include all of the 'food groups', chew the food very thoroughly (whether it seems to need chewing or not), and keep sipping water while you eat. These techniques ensure that maximum nutritional value is available from the food, and that its energy will be available while you work out.<br>  <br>  If you eat/drink too much before a workout, or chew it too little, you can start to feel like puking as the effort increases. This can also happen if you are working out too hard. Gentle gymwork can often be better for you than exercising very vigorously.|`|UJj3VvGQaa	No do not work out on an empty stomach. You can cause serious damage to your body. <br>  <br>  Best thing to do is eat something in high protein fibre and energy about an hour before working out.

0vcbKlLMaa	Try milk... chocolate or white.  It tastes bad anyways so you got to chug it fast.  May I recommend Whey Protein for best results.  Avoid the weight gainer shakes because thats an unnecessary calorie intake which can make you fat.  Whey Protein is natural protein that will build muscle weight with exercise...  Take the shake after a workout.|`|7qG34Hv5aa	Try a Big Mac....|`|RByy94nuaa	This depends on your brand of protein and your purpose of having it.<br>  <br>  There are many brands in the market. Some of them have good taste. <br>  <br>  Mix with high calorie stuff may not be a good idea if you have that for losing weight.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|bxn7q0Zwaa	Since I started to work out I was looking for a good weight loss product. I was on a diet but I felt that I needed a little "help" so I decided to try this great product and I had fantastic results. You can check their website at <br>  <a href="http://www.greathealthyes.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.greathealthyes.info</a> , they give you a free trial and you only pay 6.95$ shipping and handling.|`|nRg7Rl7Daa	Dude, forget mixing stuff, just get a weight gainer shake. They have a lot of calories.<br>  <br>  If you dont want to do that, you can always mix it with a fruit and/or milk. I used to throw in a banana into my chocolate shake and blend it with ice, but thats not a lot of extra calories.|`|fvorSS7Naa	really depends on the supplement u take dude..if its purely a protein shake I suggest u add a table spoon of peanut butter,1 cup of yorhurt and some ice cream and blend them all up..if ur taking a  weight gainer supplement I suggest u dont take anything else other than that as ull end up getting a pot and get fat..Cheers BRA...PEace

6e895a264f5d4975fefaad52ce09d57baa	The only way a TRUE diet can work is if you TRULY want it to.  You have to change your thinking.  Stop with the junk food, and eat more fresh fruit and vegetables.  Stop drinking sodas.  Replace them with water.  Get at LEAST 7 hours of sleep a day, and before you start an exercise program, see your doctor.  Remember.....you are what you eat.  If you feel like crap all the time, perhaps a diet change is just what you need.<br>    I am not a doctor, but I am living proof of what a true diet and exercise program can do for you.  I weighed over 290lbs., and ate nothing but fast food, plus my sleep patterns were very irregular.  My doctor put me on blood pressure medication, and my weight was causing Sleep Apnea.  That was 6 months ago.<br>  <br>    Today I am proud to say that I have lost over 75 lbs. and my diet now consists of Fish, Chicken, and fresh fruits.  I have stopped the Dr. Pepper habit, and now drink over 80 ounces of water daily.  Plus, I now run over 4 miles a day.  Take it from an old washed up 42 year old guy......If I can change, then anybody can.  It is all in the mind!!!  <br>    You have to want to change first.  The rest just falls into place.|`|AA12390721	good plan,<br>  to boost your esteem, just look in the mirror and find something you love about yourself, and then find something someone else has complimented you on<br>  i used to be insanely self concious, but now i'm in love with my body.|`|8fb9d98c6d80fafbf9c4639d675c3af9aa	I think it sounds like a great plan........<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|lTgaK7rhaa	Just try to get more sleep and your attitude will improve.  Since you burn calories when  you sleep, extra can do nothing but good for you.<br>  Keep It Real<br>  ~maddy~
9OyIL8P9aa	Cervical cancer is normally in her cervix area. I know that it is scary. Her best bet for that is to get a pap done. And if she has had them done in the last year and nothing was said about her test being abnormal , then she has nothing to worry about regarding it being cervical cancer.<br>  If what you are taking about the "mole" being by her clit, yes it could be genetic, if it has been there since she was born or a younger age.<br>  But if it has appeared say within the last few years, then I would be getting it looked at. Because it could be genital warts. And if so , there are treatments for it. And to answer your question about it being transmitted though sex, yes. It is also know as HVP. Which anyone who has sex will get and fight it off before you even know that you have it,But some women's body can not fight it off. HVP has 114 different strands of warts. 1 strain is cervical cancer. <br>  So with that all being said, her best bet, is to get to the doctors to get checked out for her own health.<br>  I hope that this helps.|`|bJnLmvkqaa	Just like every little mole on the rest of your body doesn't indicate cancer, every little mole "down there" doesn't indicate cervical cancer. Your friend should lighten up then ask a doctor at the next visit.
QrSFskUpaa	The way he grabbed your arm and just staring at you shows that he is controlling you. The staring eyes meant as you knew what is going to happen to you later. <br>  <br>  You are right you don't need to be scared of someone especially the ones who love you.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Your mother's advice is terrible.  Your boyfriend was threatening you when he grabbed you by the arm and stared at you.  Please get as far away from him as possible, and change your phone number too.  You are absolutely going to get hurt.|`|AA10500537	get away from him while you can because  he may hurt you bad someday|`|7oF2o4q5aa	Get out, get out right now!  Get out before it goes any further and he does hurt you!  Remember all the times you heard about domestic violence and thought, "Why didn't she just leave?"  Well, this is your chance.  If you are afraid of him that means that little voice inside your head is telling you something is wrong.  LISTEN TO IT!!! This is the beginning.  If he is violent toward others, he WILL be violent with you.  He did that to intimidate you and make you think that you should not go.  NO ONE DESERVES THAT TREATMENT.  If you think that is love, you should seek help immediately.|`|KyocDVuZaa	Its obvious hes just trying to impress you if he beat someone up because he bumped into you it shows how much he cares about you. Yeah its a different approach but if you dont show love back he will think your cheating or afraid of him, he probably doesnt want you to be afraid of him just show love and instead of saying something like 'why did you beat that guy up you psycho' say 'thanks'|`|FKR45WLPaa	This sounds like a dead end relationship to me.  I think that it will get worse, and maybe dangerous.  You hear about all of these women on the news that terrible things happen to, they probably thought that they could change their men too.  Please seek help in leaving this person.  I wouldn't confront him alone.|`|KLZGmyL4aa	girl u have to run away from that guy, he is scary, i would be scared to, u should probably end the relationship before he does something to u :/|`|nyq0gqpOaa	Sounds like a catch to me. Sounds like a catch to me.|`|VLg5Hd43aa	get out girl i have been there done that and he like to have killed me.. be smart leave him no reason of being scared and if your that scared u know your going to get hurt|`|AaknZ1RHaa	Doesn't sound good at all. I relationship is supposed to be a loving one not one that terrifies you.<br>  <br>  If it was me I would leave him and fast. Sounds like trouble too me.|`|tGEMwgyBaa	Dear Lauren,<br>  You might not like what you are about to read but it must be said; You are a very confused person who needs guidance. It sounds like your mother is not doing a very good job at guiding you at all. But you are not completely lost, your gut is telling you this is not right, you said yourself that you are terrified! It is not normal to be terrified of someone that is supposed to love you. He is slowly hacking away at your self confidence and one day you will end up in the Hospital or the Morgue. Look back at your description of the person you describe as being the person you love. Now ask yourself if you want to live or die.. you need to find your self confidence and your self worth and kick this guy to the curb. As for your mother, my God it's one thing to be wild and have fun, it's another to be self destructive and pass it on to your child. I hope you can find the strength within and make a better life for yourself. Good Luck....|`|vWIoJn7Saa	I have seen all of these signs before and seen where they lead, and someone I loved and cared about is dead because I or anyone else in my family couldn't get through to her and give her enough strenght and support to get out, which is what you should be doing right now. These are text book signs of a controlling and abusive partner. It sounds like he's already trying to control you and alienate you by preventing you from going out without him. You shouldn't have to reassure him that "you're just going out with friends" and remember that abusive comes in many forms, it's not only punches. It's emotional, psychological, verbal, and believe me I know that in between the incidents of abusive the person is the most charming, loving, charismatic partner you've ever seen, why else do you think all these people throughout history stays in these abusive relationships? It's not because they're too afraid to get out, not at first. It takes time and manipulation to get a person to that place and that frame of mind. It's a whole, deliberate process and it's already begun. Please, get out while you still have the strenght.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Sounds like you need to dump him fast!!!<br>  Your mom may be right about having a good ride, but bad boys are NEVER keepers and I doubt he fears you like she said.  Can you beat the tar out of him, win against him in a knife fight, or pull a gun faster than he can?<br>  Women tend to have this misperception that they can change men.  Usually those women end up dead, or beaten and terrified in a battered women's shelter somewhere.  I'd hate for that to happen to you (or anyone).<br>  He will always be a bad boy.<br>  He will always have anger issues.<br>  He will always be violent.<br>  He will always hang with a bad crowd.<br>  He will always scare you.<br>  And he will get arrested again.<br>  <br>  You want nothing to do with a guy like that.  Even if it's true that he loves you, even if you love him, you HAVE to leave.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Read your entire question objectively as if someone else had asked it. What advice would you give her? Would you tell her to stay that things will get better? Would you tell her to just ignore the signs of domestic violence and not to worry about them escalating? Would you tell her that some people show love in different ways and his behavior is just his way of showing love? If the answer you would give to these questions is yes, then I guess you should stay. If you advised her to get out of a relationship where the only love from the partner was in words and whose deeds were the opposite of a loving person?  Would you tell her  the real violence is lurking and waiting to be released and doesn't she want to be long gone when it happens?   If your answer was yes to these questions, then get out of this dangerous situation before it deteriorates further. If someone asked me to describe a toxic relationship I would use your answer.....except for the part about him being your dream man.

Il secondo tipo (Lasik, è quello che ho fatto io) consiste in un'incisione della cornea, che viene sollevata. L'intervento viene fatto sotto la parte sollevata,che poi viene riappoggiata al suo posto. Tra i due interventi c'è la differenza che c'è tra un taglio e un'abrasione. Il taglio guarisce prima.<br>  Sono soddisfatta. Mi è rimasta una minima quantità di astigmatismo, ma niente in confronto a prima, e la miopia è praticamente sparita. Per esempio, ora guido senza occhiali.<br>  E' un intervento ambulatoriale. Dopo, te ne vai a casa e passi un giorno tranquilla. Per un mese devi curarti con dei colliri, e badare soprattutto che l'occhio non venga urtato o infettato. Quindi: non bisogna bagnarsi gli occhi quando si fa la doccia o ci si lava la faccia (usi salviette detergenti) e dormi con una piccola conchiglia di protezione per non strofinarti inavvertitamente sul cuscino.<br>  Se decidi per il sì, la cosa più importante è che tu lo faccia presso una struttura affidabile e specializzata. Informati molto bene. Controlla anche se c'è una possibilità di rimborso da parte della mutua o della tua assicurazione. Ciao, e in bocca al lupo.|`|d7012bff1196760e402481041afb673aaa	Io mi sono fatto operare nel 1999 e gia' allora la tecnologia assicurava risultati ottimi al 99%. Oggi e' praticamente perfetto. Io ho optato per la prk che, al contrario del lasik, effettua un'abrasione della superficie oculare;praticamente dà una limatina alle parti piu' spesse (parliamo di centesimi di millimetro) dell'occhio. L'operazione in se dura al massimo 5 minuti. Dopodiche' porti una lente protettiva per qualche giorno, per dare modo all'occhio di cicatrizzare ed evitare infezioni. Tolta la lente devi seguire una terapia a base di colliri per qualche tempo. Non c'e' nulla di cui avere paura ed il recupero delle diottrie e' praticamente immediato. Io avevo -6 diottrie per occhio ed ora sono quasi ipermetrope. L'operazione l'ho effettuata a Siena presso il Policlinico Le Scotte ( se ti puo' interessare) e all'epoca lo passava quasi interamente la mutua. Se non e' cambiato nulla e' addirittura gratuito oltre le -6 diottrie. E comunque, anche se dovesse costare un po', ne vale assolutamente la pena.|`|p8gY4J5eaa	strega dimmi quanti anni hai e quale é il tuo difetto visivo<br>  sono un oculista e ho effettuato centinaia di interventi da quando si facevano i "taglietti" alla russa di Fiodorov<br>  Se da un paio di anni il tuo difetto é stabile puoi farlo con tranquillità<br>  Fai un avisita completa e trovati una giusta motivazione<br>  Gli interveti fin' ora effettuati al mondo sono nell' ordine dei milioni<br>  per la paura devi pensarci tu ! se vuoi saper qualcos'altro contattami alla mail brunello.trojano@yahoo.it

7oF2o4q5aa	The color of the urine is dependent on how much water you drink.  You may have a UTI but I would drink at least 100 ounces (five regular bottles) of water for a few days and see if it doesn't clear up.  Otherwise, if you have any fever, back pain, and abdominal pain you probably have a UTI but you should still push the fluids.|`|tGcNmDUZaa	You are dehydrated. Keep your body working well by drinking 8-10glasses a day. If youe pee is still bright yellow after a week, see your doctor. Good luck!|`|SteCkEuxaa	It could just be what you are putting in your body.  Are you drinking more water than usual?  The lighter the urine, the more hydrated your body is.  Also, did you start any new medications?  That can have some weird effects on urine.

AA11298831	A physical addiction must meet the following criteria:<br>  <br>  1.) Physical withdrawal symptoms when stop reduce/use of the substance<br>  2.) Needed in ever-increasing doses to achieve the same physiological effects<br>  <br>  This is true of ALCOHOL. In fact, alcohol withdrawal may result in DT's (delerium tremens), which if VERY often fatal. For an addict, it is the most dangerous drug to stop!<br>  <br>  TOBACCO and CAFFEINE and HEROIN also meet these criteria, although withdrawal almost never results in death.<br>  <br>  MARIJUANA does NOT meet these criteria and is absolutely NOT physically addictive. It does NOT require ever-increasing doses and has absolutely NO physical withdrawal symptoms.|`|LsHkgexvaa	I agree, psychological addiction is possible. Hell, in this world everybody seems to be looking for a little feel good!|`|YJZ8W4QBaa	yes there DEFINATLY IS  such thing as marijauna addiction,<br>  <br>  not everyone will get addicted to it,but some of my friends crack up if they dont have a smoke they shake and cant cope without it.!|`|AA10500537	yes and thats bad for you|`|KyocDVuZaa	If you already have psychological problems like depression, it will make it worse, one day i didn't get it and i went crazy i was seriously my hands were shaking i felt like cutting myself again and that i wanted to get into a fight but after i had it i was o.k. maybe its just me but all i know is weed is the greatest thing in the world|`|VkzmH1GKaa	Ask Sir Paul...|`|R9KvEhMxaa	I'm not sure what Jack49 is talking about. As he certainly isn't using a medical definition of addiction. In the context of marijuana, it's absolutely critical to discriminate between addiction, dependence and withdrawal. A very succinct explanation can be found here, written by several major medical associations: <a href="http://www.painmed.org/pdf/definition.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.painmed.org/pdf/definition.pd...</a><br>  <br>  It is commonly assumed that in order for a substance to be addictive that dependence needs to be present. This is absolutely not the case. While issues of physiological and psychological dependence relating to marijuana are certainly open to debate, there is no doubt that there is a withdrawal associated with ceasing heavy use of it, typically characterized by several months of profound depression with notable irritability and frequently suicidal ideation - though this is restricted primarily to heavy use.<br>  <br>  As for addiction, and in the context of addiction, discriminating between psychological and physiological is pointless - addiction encompasses both, it is absolutely without question that this occurs with marijuana. There are regions of the country where addiction treatment for marijuana abuse now exceeds that of alcohol - and when I say treatment, I'm discussing primarily such things as sober living environment, in-patient treatment and other medically driven rehabilation.<br>  <br>  It is generally assumed that it is purely a product of what a chemical dose to the body that produces addiction - which is also not the case. It's the conjunction of the action of the chemical in the body with numerous other genetic, environmental and psychological factors that lead to the development of addiction.

AA12242211	Diabetes isn't exactly fun either.  Sometimes it's not as easy as simply taking an injection. Theres more to diabetes than just taking an insulin injection.<br>  <br>  I'll use myself as an example (and I know I'm not the only one that this happens to).  I'm a type 1 diabetic, I take injections with every meal, and check my blood sugar.  Sounds easy, right?  Well, the shot and blood sugar check is the easy part.  I've got no problem with that.  Its everything else that makes it hard.  I figure my insulin dose based on carb content.  If I dont count carbs exactly right, then I end up taking a little too much, or too little of insulin, which causes a low/high blood sugar a few hours later.  Sometimes theres days where my diabetes seems to do whatever it wants.  My routine doesnt change, diet doesnt change, amount of exercise doesnt change, but the diabetes does.  <br>  <br>  any kind of stress affect blood sugar levels.<br>  illness affects sugar levels.<br>  exercise does to.  You got to think about how anything you do during the day will affect your sugar levels.<br>  <br>  Also, different foods affect blood sugar differently even though they have carbs.  <br>  <br>  I'd much rather be hypoglycemic than diabetic.|`|e8Sgp92naa	The top specialists at the University hospital think it's a bad idea, and you are looking for some people on the internet to tell you how to do this?  Doesn't make too much sense to me.  <br>  <br>  I think you may find "the grass is always greener."  Having diabetes isn't really a walk in the park, and I really feel for you and your son.  <br>  <br>  Keep going to specialists, and if possible go to specialists in big cities.  And keep the high protein / low carb diet.  My thoughts are with you both.
AA10979361	You didn't mention drinking anything?<br>  <br>  You would lose all your weight because you would die.<br>  <br>  Dehydration, starvaton ringing any bells???|`|uJKTR4d2aa	If you didnt eat anything, you'd maybe lose 1 pound. possibly 2. Im against this but im not going to lie and say you start gaining 50 million pounds from not eating because thats not true either. So about 1-2 pounds.<br>  <br>  If you eat bites of something or sugar free mints, you wont lose any.<br>  <br>  Although you lose weight from not eating, you'll have to go up in clothes as your muscle is burned first and your fat will stick out more|`|jBVtNmeQaa	Well... It would be difficult to go through with that in general, and you may end up pigging out in the evening which because you didn't eat in the morning means that your body would be storing all the fat which means you wouldn't lose much weight at all.<br>  <br>  If you could go through with it, you may lose some weight but surely when you begin to eat again your body again would be storing all the fat and you would possibly treat yourself to more food seeing as though you went without for some time, and therefore not only would you put all the weight back on you could easily add a little extra on too.<br>  <br>  Sugar free mints are no good at all as they are full of chemicals, and would cause your stomach alot of pain. Water and tea is good. <br>  <br>  But in general you're better rather than cutting out all foods just cut out the bad foods or the wheat and dairy for a couple of weeks and it's equally important to do exercise also, to keep the body strong and to help shift the fat.<br>  <br>  :-)|`|uOkfuPGqaa	You should eat a normal amount of food. In most cases, eating will make you lose weight. Once you start eating again, your body takes in the food more than it would normally. Although you lose weight towards the end of the week, you would gain it back after you start eating again. Just occasionally exercise and cut back on things that aren't necessary (soda, boxed mac & cheese.)|`|8Yjmc1z3aa	i think you'd lose your life rather than any weight. your body would lose a lot of weight but depends on your activity and climate.|`|1EBn5A6daa	not much, when you skip meals, your body holds onto the fat, it's a survival thing|`|bdf94e69ef9a8a2eab5d69449fc5f74eaa	You won't lose alot because you aren't taking in anything, and when you do eat again your body will hold onto it because you will have slowed your metabolism way down. You will also probably lack energy because of not eating.

kznrM1ntaa	Carissima, anche io da un anno vivo con questo maledetto disturbo alimentare e credo quindi che il mio possa essere un appoggio ma, purtroppo, non un valido aiuto.<br>  Capisco perfettamente ciò che stai passando... il disagio, la frustrazione, la rabbia, il nervosismo, il senso di inadeguatezza, gli sbalzi umorali, la sensazione di non sapersi controllare, la voglia di uscirne, le infinite promesse infrante in un solo istante... <br>  Poco fa ho avuto l'ennesima crisi post-abbuffata. Sola in casa e con il desiderio di divorare qualsiasi cosa, anche quella che prima di questo periodo nero mai avrei pensato che sarei arrivata ad ingoiare. La sfrenata brama di farmi male, di sentirmi sazia fino a non reggermi in piedi e la corsa in bagno. Perchè dopo aver assunto così tante calorie l'unica soddisfazione sta nel cercare di eliminare tutto, e lesionarmi ulteriormente. Ed infine il disagio e la contraddizione sfogati in un interminabile pianto... e la speranza di cambiare le cose, di riuscire a cancellare l'accaduto. Penso tu viva situazioni analoghe e mi dispiace moltissimo.<br>  Ho visto mia sorella in lacrime, preoccupata per il mio atteggiamento... il mio ragazzo abbandonare momentaneamente il lavoro per portarmi un supporto di persona, per poi correre di nuovo in officina e subire i rimproveri del titolare... le loro suppliche di non farlo più e di andare da un medico... eppure, lo sai, in certe circostanze si è terribilmente deboli, si diventa schiavi del cibo e a nulla serve pensare alla sofferenza che si provoca a se stessi e a chi ci vuole bene.<br>  Io per il momento sto rifiutando di andare da uno specialista però consiglio a te di provare a cambiare psicologa se ancora, purtroppo, non sei riuscita a guarire.<br>  Facciamoci forza. Ce la faremo. Ti abbraccio e ti auguro tutto il bene possibile cara "amica"... Così come esiste un'entrata questo tunnel avrà sicuramente anche una via d'uscita... In bocca al lupo...|`|zdLSI1HFaa	Ciao stellina. Io ci sono passata e ora ne sono fuori. So come ti senti. Scrivimi all'e-mail ke ti do' un valido indirizzo e, se ti va, un po' di supporto!<br>  Tieni duro ke quando sei arrivata in fondo puoi solo risalire. E ce la farai. Prima regola: CREDERCI!<br>  Bacio.|`|299cdd25631b5967266d748dfbdec75daa	Non so se credi, ma prova a ripensare la tua vita alla luce di Gesù Cristo: vedrai tutto con occhi nuovi, compresa la psicologa.<br>  Stai su.|`|2VWYNNAAaa	Ciao stellina ho letto la tua richiesta di aiuto, non sono certo esperta e non credo esista una ricetta pronta per risolvere il problema. credo che la cura migliore sia quella di parlare, sfogarti e avere qualcuno che sia disposto all'ascolto senza giudizio. Se vuoi io sono qui e mi puoi contattare quando vuoi!se hai ancora il ragazzo e tanti amici rivolgiti a loro se credi possano capirti! Puoi uscire da questa situazione, non è facile ma credo che tu possa farcela perchè lo desideri davvero. Buona fortuna e sappi che il mio invito è sempre aperto ma in caso cercami sulla mia mail esteramore@hotmail.it|`|6nlZ1ov4aa	mi spiace sapere che tu stia così male..<br>  nn credo che la tua psicologa sia in malafede..mi sembra di capire piuttosto che tu non ti fidi di lei, altrimenti nn penseresti che lo fa solo per soldi. hai parlato con leidel disagio che provi quando scava a fondo? purtroppo guarire da un disturbo alimentare implica un percorso lungo e tortuoso, e devi trovarne la causa, altrimenti non ne uscirai mai..abbi fiducia nella tua terapeuta e cerca pian piano di volerti bene, nn è facile e ci vuole del tempo.<br>  se proprio nn ti trovi bene cambiala, ma credo proprio che il problema nn sia lei..ma le tue resistenze a ricordare e analizzare il problema a fondo. mi spiace, nn voglio essere dura perchè so che è molto dura. hai tante persone che ti vogliono bene, è una grande fortuna.vai avanti con la terapia e pian piano sono sicura che ne uscirai.è tanto sapere che sei stanca di questa situazione, è un grosso passo avanti. <br>  sii forte, e nn aver  paura delle ricadute, cerca di sconfiggerle.quando ti trovi in difficoltà chiedi aiuto alle amiche, alla famiglia, in modo da non trovarti troppo spesso sola e con le tentazioni a portata di mano. e vai da un medico, rimettere sangue non è un buon segno..<br>  in bocca a lupo.<br>  ti abbraccio<br>  se vuoi contattami|`|FrUIIubWaa	è positivo che tu sia stanca e ne voglia venie fuori..gli ingredienti sono volontà e forza.....niente è perduto...hai tanta forza dentro di te, solo che questo problema ti ha portata a sopprimerla...la prima cosa che ti consiglio è parlarne con persone che ti vogliono bene e ti conoscono meglio di chiunque altro e sai che farebbero il meglio per te e no cn psicologi che come dici tu vogliono solo i soldi....in seguito devi avere fiducia in te e tirare fuori tutta quella forza che hai soppresso perché se hai avuto la forza di chiedere aiuto è un segno che hai la forza per venirne fuori..<br>  poi soffermati un attimo: questa strada nn ti porterà mai al bene..hai solo 18anni e una vita davanti con un futuro tutto da scoprire perché buttare via tutte le gioie che ti aspettano in futuro?guardati bene e vedrai che cela puoi fare...anche per una mia amica sembrava tutto perduto ma poi grazie alle persone che le vogliono bene, ha ritrovato la forza in sè e ha scoperto che la vita nonostante tutto era piena di oro da goderselo..ha scoperto che anche in lei cera oro...la rpima cosa che devi fare però è parlarne con le pesone giuste e poi solo con la tua forza e volontà cela farai...mi raccomando nn cadere rimani su e goditi questa vita....spero di esserti stata d'aiuto....|`|JvZxLUomaa	esistono dei centri appositi, la psicologia non aiuta in questi casi. sono cose serie rivolgiti a uno specializzato nel settore costerà un po' ma è meglio la tua salute no??|`|KxIFxg7Uaa	Io non credo che la tua psicologa sia in malafede,io credo che voglia risolvere il tuo problema risalendo alla sua origine.Sicuramente è scaturito da qualcosa che ti porti dentro inconsciamente. Capire l'origine o la causa che lo ha provocato significa risolverlo.Solo così potrai uscirci, fai si che la tua psicologa capisca il motivo ,anzi aiutala a capire da dove "nasce" la tua bulimia.Aiutala ad aiutarti io le credo!!!Bisogna toccare il fondo per poter risalire.Ti vogliamo bene e siamo tutti con te,facci sapere.|`|N0rRQqaFaa	Mi dispiace molto per quello ke stai passando e per prima cosa ti consiglio di provare un'altra psicologa.Credi in te stessa e ce la farai.Un mondo di auguri.

L'accesso ad un numero così elevato di informazioni (associate a luci, colori, scritte ad intermittenza) in tempi così veloci non è nella natura umana. Lo studio delle informazioni necessita di tempo, ed esso è variabile da persoan a persana. C'è chi è più svelto e chi no, ed è per quello che alcuni hanno facilità ad apprendere dal pc (intendo internet e varie enc. in cd) mentre altri rimangono sul libro tutto il tempo a loro necessario. Io per esempio se leggo un giornale on-line tempo poco e mi dimentico dove ho letto quelle notizie mentre se lo compro in edicola e me lo gusto al bar allora mi sembra di ricordarle meglio. Possibile? mah!|`|zCunHfXwaa	Che stare al pc faccia male alla vista siamo d'accordo.. ma sinceramente non penso che sia addirittura deleterio per la memoria: io ci passo putroppo parecchie ore ma la mia memoria sta benissimo!!

giCUEYsJaa	Since you didn't say how old you are - or if you male or female, it's pretty hard to tell.<br>  <br>  But I'm assuming you are female (by your avatar) and perhaps may have endometriosis.<br>  <br>  Endometriosis (from endo, "inside", and metra, "womb") is a common medical condition in women in which endometrial cells are deposited in areas outside the uterine cavity. The uterine cavity is lined by endometrial cells, which are under the influence of female hormones. Endometrial cells deposited in areas outside the uterus (endometriosis) continue to be influenced by these hormonal changes and respond similarly as do those cells found inside the uterus. Symptoms often exacerbate in time with the menstrual cycle.<br>  <br>  Endometriosis is typically seen during the reproductive years; it has been estimated that it occurs in roughly 5% to 10% of women.[1] Symptoms depend on the site of implantation. Its main but not universal symptom is pelvic pain in various manifestations. Endometriosis is a common finding in women with infertility.<br>  <br>  As for your fear of it being cancer - that wouldn't be my first guess.  Because cancer usually isn't accompanied by pain.  <br>  <br>  It could however be Colitis or Chrons Disease, which can be extremely painful and often times life threatening.<br>  <br>  I personally would call the doctor.

I think with the procedure you need done, the hospital would be the place and you won't have to pay upfront. You go to the financial services office and discuss the bill with them. You'll get the discount and a payment plan set up. Good luck. I believe those 2 procedures you need will cost way more than 160, but I'm not 100% on that.<br>  <br>  Actually, searched and found colonoscopy runs a grand or more in many states.

I think you mainly look that way because of your genes .<br>  <br>  Anyways, if you want to incorporate some physical activities in your daily life, i recommend:<br>  <br>  jogging / stretching / body weight squats / lunges / push ups / seated dips; which can all be done at home (except for jogging) in as little as 15-30 mins. <br>  Jogging + stretching would be best overall for anyone i think.|`|AVAdgxKWaa	No need to.

R3DUfhT2aa	Pushups are a great way to gain definition in your chest, but if your looking to gain mass, bench pressing is the way to go. <br>  <br>  To get results you should either, try benchpressing, as much as you can for  3 sets of 3-5 reps for about 2-3 times a week(with rest days in between, they are just as important as working out). If you don't have access to gym equipment, try slowing down your reps of the 100 pushups, this will work your muscles harder and fatigue them harder/quicker. As far as dieting goes, engage in a high-protein diet, eat such foods as chicken breast, ground beef, and other lean meat products.

RXI8ImdIaa	I do this too. If I have nowhere to be, I can easily sleep 12 hours a day. Then I feel like crap all day because I slept too much.<br>  <br>  The only solution I've found is to make sure I go to bed on time and get up on time, just as if it was a work/school day. No staying up late, no sleeping in late. Allow for about 8 hours of sleep.<br>  <br>  I set my clock radio next to my bed, and I also have a second loud alarm (it's a ninentdo DS) way across the room. The clock radio starts about 18 minutes before I really need to be awake, and the DS is set for when I actually should get out of bed. I have a personal rule that when I get up to turn off that far alarm, I cannot go back to bed, I must stay up no matter what. No snooze button. I'm never happy at that point, but after a couple minutes on my feet I wake up more and I'm fine.<br>  <br>  One more tip that I've found works for me. If you are one of those people that sets your alarm like an hour early because you know you're going to push the snooze button, you need to stop setting it early. You have to teach your body that when the alarm goes off, it is time to get up. Pushing the snooze button just trains you to ignore the alarm, and eventually you won't even have to wake up to push that button. <br>  <br>  My 2-alarm-clock strategy is a combination, kind of. I allow enough time to push snooze once or twice on the bedside alarm, but no more than that. The alarm across the room forces me to stand up, and I'm trained to stay up at that point. Not coincidentally, the bedside alarm does not rouse me from sleep, but the sound of the DS snaps me out of a dream instantly.|`|CFFuFof1aa	I think you should see your doctor.

dLFpdOndaa	have you been doing exercises for your triceps.  That is what the back of your arms are called and need to be worked.  Do the following exercises:<br>  <br>  Use a 2 or 5 lb weight and bend over, with your arms at your side, bend your arms below the elbow and then straighten them holding the weights. these are called tricep kickbacks. Another exercise you can do with the dumbells are to lay flat and hold your arms straight up and bend your arms at the elbow and straighten them out. These are called tricep skullcrushers.|`|BblZdoKzaa	You can't turn fat into muscle. This means that while you may be gaining a great deal of strength by doing resistance training, that doesn't mean you're losing any of the "flab" on you arms. The way to lose fat is by acheiving a negative calorie balance - that means you burn more calories/day than you consume through your dietary intake. To be exact - a 3500 negative calorie balance is equivalent to one lb of fat. You can acheive this by eating less, and healthier food, and by exercising. Keep in mind that when you lose fat, you can't control which area of your body you lose it from. This is called "Spot Reduction" and is a myth. (ex. No matter how many crunches you do it will not burn the fat on you tummy, it will only make your abdominal muscles stronger.)You lose it everywhere. Everyone is a little different and different people store fat in different places. Your body might "choose" to store a lot of fat in your arms, and you can't help that.|`|VjJJSvxnaa	without knowing how often and for what duration you are spending doing cardio, it's hard to say. Women have a much harder time defining their tricep area. the best thing to do would be cardio 4+ days a week for at least 30 min (not too intense). In addition, tricep extensions with a mustache bar can help. If you can do pushups, make sure to do at least 4 sets of close grip pushups, as this will definitely help. remember, you want to push yourself!|`|SfR9apzjaa	Well, by "back of the arms" you must mean the triceps a muscle. The first thing to consider is rather you are performing the exercises correctly or not and also if you are doing the right exercises for the triceps. I would expect that you are correct in technique and type. <br>  <br>  However, if you have built up your triceps they will still be "flabby" because the muscle hangs of the humerus bone. The best way to tell if the exercise is working is to flex the triceps muscle and do a skin fold test. The more muscle and less fat, the les skin you will be able to grab via a pinching technique.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Eat at least 1200 but no over 1600 calories. Run, jog, or other cardio for an hour 3 times a week. Try for 5 times a week eventually. You could lose it in a month n a half|`|AA11447210	You LOSE weight (loose is what you want your pants to be), and the faster you lose it, the higher chance you'll regain it.<br>  <br>  Eat right and exercise regularly. That's the key! No pills no gimmicks!|`|350cc6173ffb629f134cb3e382d77470aa	Impossible.<br>  Unless you have extreme willpower to starve urself and exercise
v2qZFS7maa	the problem is...you could be losing alot of blood. And that will cause more of a problem. the only thing you can do is see a Doc. <br>  Take a preggo test. Some times you do bleed during a pregnancy. But Constant bleeding isn't normal. try going on birth control to regulate it, if you really dont wanna go to the doc. <br>  but this sounds serious. no one bleeds for three months straight...try going to a free clinic.<br>  <br>  <br>  ugh. also it really irrates me that health care is so damn expensive. I wish we were like canada or other countries that doesn't cost a arm and a leg for better health!|`|BRDqfAy3aa	I am sorry you cannot go to the doctor - most probably you need curettage - read below - Very Heavy Menstrual Flow|`|BGcSbdFNaa	Quit cutting yourself.|`|nvUdanmEaa	That sounds really dangerous.

Q4D5T5vwaa	first of all, sorry for yor loss. i get bouts of depression and have thought of suicide in the back of my mind, but i have never gone through with actually doing it to myself. i'm quite thankful that i haven't, because the next day is a gift to just be alive and get better one step at a time. don't kill yourself, seriously. you will get better with time if you don't think about it. i know how much it hurts to lose someone close to you. a girl i went to high school with killed herself just last month and her friends and family were just appalled to help myself, i just told myself that nothing ever lasts forever and that we all live and then do die eventually, but when it's our time. life throws us all curveballs and i see it as a test to see how strong we actually are when dealing with these events. it happens to all of us. don't rush something to yourself when it's gonna happen to you naturally.<br>  once again, don't kill yourself. it's not worth it. just keep having a positive outlook on your life and tell yourself over and over that this will pass.|`|hYZIYla0aa	If you are going through a bad depression,please seek help.There are doctors out there who can help you learn how to deal with this.Depression is a disease,it controls your thoughts,feelings and your way of handling things.There is help,and medications that will help you get through this sad time in your life.|`|N4zrixMraa	ur a clown and man the **** up

Y4s4Om38aa	It may not be physicly dangerous....with some anti depressants it is though...check with your dr on that.<br>  <br>  However alcohol is a depressant.  It completely counteracts the antidepressant.  Iwill drink a few times a year on mine, but even then, i feel noticably off for almost a week.......definitly would not drink every week....even if just one drink.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	You risk the medicine from doing what it is intended to do, even with a beer. Alcohol is a depressant, why drink if you are already depressed and want to feel better. It's just not worth it, is it?|`|WXExyAlWaa	Technically no, it's not alright. You have to be pretty aware of exactly what your body can handle to risk it - luckily I am because I also have insomnia which is symptomatic of my depression and I find a little bit of alcohol helps me sleep a bit better, but I have to be careful not to have too much because I'm small and haven't had alcohol in a decent amount in several years.<br>  <br>  But then I would advise people who drink to know their limits even if they're not on any other medication.|`|MMQ7SdvDaa	If you are on an antidepressant drinking any amount of alcohol is not recommended. Alcohol is a CNS depressant. Your psychiatrist would not be able to determine the treatment effectiveness if you lay the depressant alcohol on top of it.|`|HGRBtDIiaa	my boyfriend is on antidepressants and whenever he drinks it makes him crazy. he gets really depressed. i would stay away from it. one beer might not be that bad, but i'd just play it safe and drink a soda.|`|AA10500537	alcohol is bad when taking any pres , drugs <br>  check with dr,|`|ivB4glmWaa	wot amount of prozac you on ?<br>  i was on 20mg prozac ,  i drank beer sometimes on them i was totaly fine but im not encoraging it !!!!<br>  best ask your doctor or chemist  they will prob say no ! but best ask them
9okusH1kaa	Sounds fine to me, as long as you aren't engaging in too much exercise. <br>  <br>  Also, you shouldn't eat the same thing everyday for too long as your body require variance. It will become less efficient at getting nutrition from a food source if you use it exclusively for too long. So every so often you should eat different foods. <br>  <br>  Try to make sure you are eating a minimum of 1800 calories a day and that you have a cheat day with a high caloric intake once a month. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|of049X1waa	no, not an eating disorder you seem to have too much coffee though that is bad for you!|`|PaKCWpGSaa	i have no idea, sounds tasty though!|`|44209bed877d82f066bd0e61b8c60fa0aa	If you are obese and trying to lose weight, then it sounds good.  Otherwise it is not enough calories.  Look for a website that tells you how many calories you should eat for your body height & weight.  Normal woman, say 5' 5" 145 should eat around 1400 calories to maintain a healthy weight.  Looks like you are only eating around 400 - 500 calories, which is low.  Try mayoclinic.com|`|AA10979361	No eating disorder. Maybe an obsessive disorder? <br>  <br>  Maybe you are just really disciplined? <br>  <br>  I'll bet you are very thin.<br>  <br>  Do you take any hunger suppressants? I like your diet. It sounds yummy!|`|NFyQWFoGaa	Talk to your doctor, that's why they are there.|`|1JbWMSataa	No, you don't. That's about how much I eat a day. However, I'm on a diet, so unless you're trying to lose weight, maybe eat more for lunch. It sounds really good though. I want shrimp now.

87pV5lvZaa	My husband actually loves to have sex with me when I'm on my period, not because of the blood (yuck!) but rather because of the slippery feeling.  I normally feel super self-conscious about the way it looks, so sex when I'm menstruating is either (a) in the dark or (b) in the shower.|`|cyFqjkolaa	No just need to take some precautions and some clean up after.  Not a big deal especially if she is really in the mood.|`|RKLFYS2Naa	Many men and women worry that having sexual intercourse during a woman's period is unhealthy. Though frowned upon in many cultures and faiths, sexual intercourse during menstruation is entirely normal and completely healthy.<br>  <br>  Worries about this act generally stem from societal misconceptions about menstrual blood: most girls are taught from a young age that their menstrual blood is unclean and "dirty," and therefore should be hidden and contained at all times. However, menstrual blood is an entirely natural bodily fluid, and does not in anyway affect a man's penis or a woman's reproductive tract. As long as you are engaging in safe and protected sexual intercourse, it is entirely alright for you and your partner to have sex during your period.|`|Gxdcevjgaa	I'm a girl, but I'd like to throw my 2 cents in the mix.

W44F4Kamaa	Your goals are a little incongruent and here's why:<br>  Maximizing muscle growth requires a caloric surplus. How much of a surplus depends on factors such as your body type, metabolism and current condition, but the fact remains that you must consume more calories than you expend. On the other hand, losing fat requires the opposite: a caloric deficit. You must expend more energy than you consume. <br>  <br>  Bottom Line: Pursuing two conflicting goals at the same time is not effective. <br>  <br>  Focus on one goal first, tackle it, then move on to the other.<br>  <br>  Secondly there is no way that you can put on 40 lbs. of muscle with the plan you currently have, nor would it be enough to lose 80 lbs. of Fat.<br>   <br>  Here's the fat loss basics:<br>  <br>     1. You need to create a caloric deficit - no two ways about it - you must burn more than you consume.<br>  <br>     2. The most effective way to create that deficit is to use a combination of diet and exercise<br>  <br>     3. Your diet should consist of lean proteins, vegetables healthy fats, and perhaps a little fruit. Keep starches and refined carbs to a minimum. Keep your fluid intake high (water only), and try to eat at least 4-5 (if not 6) small meals per day. This will help maintain blood sugar levels and keep you from blowing your diet.<br>  <br>     4. Exercise - interval training and metabolic resistance training will provide the most bang-for-your buck. Steady state aerobic training just doesn't burn enough calories for your goals right now, and a body-part training split will be less effective than total body training for fat loss.<br>  <br>     5. If your schedule allows try to exercise six days per week - three days of interval based cardio and three days of metabolic resistance training. If not make sure your day has metabolic resistance training followed by interval cardio. Shoot for 3x a week.<br>  <br>     6. Supplements: there is almost nothing that will make a difference. Sorry! Certain supplements can boost metabolism, or increase your energy somewhat and these may be useful - but in terms of real world "pounds of fat lost" There's really not much that really makes a difference. A multivitamin and a fish oil supplement are vital though - but more for your overall health. a protein shake or meal replacement powder can be useful for convenience but are nothing more than high quality food.<br>  <br>  Let me know if you have any other questions; Good luck!|`|P1p50SONaa	yes i think your goal is achievable as long as you are disciplined and stick to it. but i would also recommend making it harder such as by forming a diamond with your hand and doing a push up and make your nose touch in th middle of it. or have your feet elevated like on yoru bed or somehting because doing this will work oout different muscles better. for the push ups i would recommend finding as many different ones on the internet and switch each week and keep cycling through all the different ones.<br>  <br>  and for the sit ups you can sit on a big ball like the ones they use for some weight loss things cus it will give yoru abs a better work out. <br>  <br>  and for the crunches raise your legs up in the air so your knees are bent at a 90 degree angle and then put your hands behind your ears and bring your knees and your elbows together so they touch. this is better than keeping your feet on the ground cus it keeps your abs flexed the whole time cus they have to be on the air and it works out your upper as well as your lower ags becaus you lift yrou tailbone off the ground so it works yoru lower which is usually a place people have trouble working. and for the jogging part you could try running outside such as like on the beach or when it is winter run through the snow and stuff like that cus you will have to have great balance to stay on yoru feet so it works yoru muscles harder cus your gonna be slipping around in the snow and sand and you can try other surfaces to see what gives you a really good work out don't be afraid to change it up so it isn't so boring|`|ami0GWqUaa	I couldn't tell you exactly if you'll reach your particular goal but it sounds like a good routine.<br>  <br>  Diet is an important part of keeping in shape too.<br>  <br>  Eat alot of fresh greens & lean meats, drink plenty of water too.<br>  <br>  You'll definatley lose weight if you stay dedicated.<br>  <br>  How much muscle you put on will determine how well you eat as well as working out with weights regularly.|`|AA12006368	Swim!!!!<br>  less stress on your body too|`|bVgFCPBAaa	It's really hard to put on muscle and lose fat at the same time.  But your routine looks good, for losing the fat - as long as you get your heart-rate up for a sustained period - and make sure you restrict your calorie intake. I'd say about 3 pounds a week is as much as you can lose in a healthy way.  Any more than that - and the chances are very good that you're losing muscle too.

I jsut actually went to my obgyn this monday because of problems I am having that are similar.  She recomended that if I was sleeping around at all to have a STD check it could cause it, fi the fluid has a bad odor it could be an infection.  It coudl be the fact that you jsut started this birthcontrol and your body is adjusting to it.  Also this is what was causing mine, STRESS!

R3DUfhT2aa	The idea of veins showing through your arms is the result of an increased heart rate for an extended amount of time, which in theory speeds up your blood flow to the active area. Veins are most commonly seen on the forehead and fore-arms. Vein's in the forehead are a result of stress, more specifically the nervous system. Vein's on forearms are also thee result of stress, but it is physical stress, applied with weights, cardio, or other physical exercise. The best way to achieve the buldging veins, is to lower your body fat(Cardio, i.e. walking, running, biking), and lift moderately light weights for long lengths of time(I go for an hour). The weight lifting exercises best fitted for this are; standing barbell curls, barbell wrist curls, reverse curls, dumbell curls. If you don't know what exercises im talking about, google them.

W44F4Kamaa	You've just stumbled onto the secret of every weight loss infomercial ever. Beyond using the product you also have to modify your eating habits and perhaps even exercise in addition to the use of the "miracle product". <br>  <br>  If you really want to buy it and think you'll enjoy the tapes/DVD and also stick to the eating plan that the program talks about then you should see results.

dpKN6kyraa	Vitamin B6, through its involvement in protein metabolism and cellular growth, is important to the immune system. It helps maintain the health of lymphoid organs (thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes) that make your white blood cells. Animal studies show that a vitamin B6 deficiency can decrease your antibody production and suppress your immune response .<br>  <br>  Vitamin B6 also helps maintain your blood glucose (sugar) within a normal range. When caloric intake is low your body needs vitamin B6 to help convert stored carbohydrate or other nutrients to glucose to maintain normal blood sugar levels. While a shortage of vitamin B6 will limit these functions, supplements of this vitamin do not enhance them in well-nourished individuals|`|qg8GOlEqaa	Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin. PLP is a cofactor in many reactions of amino acid metabolism. PLP also is necessary for the enzymatic reaction governing the release of glucose from glycogen<br>  <br>  Seven forms of this vitamin are known:<br>  <br>  pyridoxine (PN). PN is the form that is given as vitamin B6 supplement. <br>  pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP). <br>  pyridoxal (PL). <br>  pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). PLP is the metabolically active form. <br>  pyridoxamine (PM). <br>  pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP). <br>  4-pyridoxic acid (PA). PA is the catabolite which is excreted in the urine. <br>  All forms except PA can be interconverted.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] History<br>  Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble compound that was discovered in the 1930s during nutrition studies on rats. The vitamin was named pyridoxine to indicate its structural homology to pyridine. Later it was shown that vitamin B6 could exist in two other, slightly different, chemical forms, termed pyridoxal and pyridoxamine. All three forms of vitamin B6 are precursors of an activated compound known as pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), which plays a vital role as the cofactor of a large number of essential enzymes in the human body.<br>  <br>  Enzymes dependent on PLP focus a wide variety of chemical reactions mainly involving amino acids. The reactions carried out by the PLP-dependent enzymes that act on amino acids include transfer of the amino group, decarboxylation, racemization, and beta- or gamma-elimination or replacement. Such versatility arises from the ability of PLP to covalently bind the substrate, and then to act as an electrophilic catalyst, thereby stabilizing different types of carbanionic reaction intermediates.|`|woJr9TJpaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6</a>

If you recently started working out that could effect your cycle, a change in diet or stress can also effect it. I would suggest that if you don't start your period in the next few days to make an appointment with your GYN. And maybe just to be on the safe side take a pregnancy test.

AJq0VTzlaa	It's a man's world and they're chauvinistic pigs.  I have seen more than my share of adult porn, all versions, and trip out, get mad, get upset,  when a man wants the woman to do him but he doesn't reciprocate.  <br>  <br>  As a gay man, I usually don't get involved in a relationship if there's no reciprocation, if you know what I mean.   Hey don't ask of me to do something that you would not do yourself.|`|52uPz6WCaa	Guys are very visual, and the more we see the more we like. I have yet to have a woman ask me to take a shot of Two-ball-tonic to get her ramped up. Woman also produce juices throughout sex where as when a guys drops, it's a done deal. Thats why guys love Bi's and lesbians so much. My wife has no problem with doing any of what you described and even says that "no self respecting woman spits" It's a total homophobe thing, I personally have not and do not intend to take a mouthfull of baby batter, and yes it is hypocritical, as I have no problem letting her take one down and yes letting her swallow it down after directly pulling out with her "flavor" all over it. Guess women like the taste of their own juices and guys like the smell or their own farts. As the line in Austin Powers went; "Oooh! Heh heh heh. Let's have a smell, all right? Oh, everyone likes their own brand, don't they? Oh, this is magic! Hmmm, wafting, wafting. Ok, analysis. Ooh, smells like carrots in throw-up! Oh that could gag a maggot! I smell like hot sick... *** in a dead carcass! Even stink would say that stinks!" Guess I would rather smell my own farts and watch her lick her fingers than watch her sniff her farts while I chug chode.|`|H2gJgWG9aa	it's gross eewwwwwwwwwwww..|`|OqbIqTPbaa	Well, you may consider me a little werid, but I don't have problem with it.

I will go down on a girl and stay there all day, but if she is eating my tube steak and let's the juices run, there is no way I will kiss her after that.  It is just funny that way.  I have no interest in knowing what my come tastes like.  I love the way my girl tastes and I have no problem doing that, but I gag when I see that stuff spilling out of their mouths in real life or even in porn.|`|AA11697065	Honey, you're hubby is a bum you shouldn't give it to him any more, I usually kiss my girl after she swallows and I love it, if he's so close minded about it don't give it him...he don't deserve what he don't appreciate!!!

The best product I found on the market is made with pure hoodia and it works great! You can go to <br>  <a href="http://www.officiall2you.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.officiall2you.info</a> and order you free trial, also you only pay 6.95$ shipping and handling. Good luck!
jvHy5NCTaa	There is no such thing as a diet that works. Any time you go "on" a diet, you will go "off" the diet. When you go "off" you will basically gain all the weight lost - and than some - back! The best way to achieve successful weight loss over a long period of time is to make lifestyle changes. Eat healthier and exercise more than you do now. Do not entirely cut out all "bad" food because if you deprive yourself of these you'll find yourself having a huge binge. So in moderation it is fine. Adjusting eating behaviors and physical activity will help you to lose weight and maximize your results over a longer period of time. There is no "quick fix" to losing weight. Also be careful with portion sizes, use smaller plates and cutlery when eating a meal. Usually if we have a big plate we fill it all up and halfway through eating we feel full, but because there is still food on our plate we continue to unnecessarily eat until the plate is empty, This is where many people add many calories to their daily intake, in turn making them gain weight or not lose any. Fad diets do NOT work -Good luck|`|IzEXJ0Leaa	When you go on a diet eventially you go off the diet. What you need is to eat right and do some exercising. Being in shape is a lifestyle not something you do for a month.

Don't starve yourself, Eat LESS! <br>  *Eat 5 small meals a day. Stay away from junk food, no late night snacking either because you're body puts on weight after 6/7 pm at night. Try not to eat after this, and if you do it should be fruits, low fat yogurt etc. <br>  *Run, do sit ups as well. <br>  You will see results if you keep this up.|`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	Maintaining a healthy diet and an active lifestyle are the best way to lose weight.  One trick I use to try to achieve a healthier lifestyle is to cut out all drinks that are useless for your body.  For example cut out all soft drinks, even the diet ones because they don't give your body anything you need.  Limit juice because of it's high sugar content and try to only consume juice that contains all natural real juice in it.  Drink tons of water, low fat milk and vegetable juice if you can.  Doing this will make a big difference over the long run and it's fairly easy to change.  I figure why get tons of extra useless calories from a drink.|`|AA10357342	at home? well diet, but you need to get outside & work out!! do some running @ a local park, do your push ups, sit ups, buy some dumbells, pull ups, dips, etc.|`|AA10727179	running.|`|lgR41aCaaa	First of all don't think too far ahead about getting ripped.

If you do that regularly after a few months you should see some serious results.

Run a couple of laps, perhaps at a nearby park or around your neighborhood. <br>  <br>  If running isn't really the best thing you like to do, play sports. Get together with some friends, play soccer, basketball, football, etc. Every bit of exercises does the body well. <br>  <br>  Above all, try to keep a steady routine. For example, you might want to work out every two days, or every so so day of the week. Stick to your routine. Don't give up so easily and just say "Oh, tommorrow I'll work out." If you don't keep on a steady routine, it is going to break apart and your going to end up doing little to nothing.<br>  <br>  Having a steady diet is VERY important. Cut out the small things, like chips, high sugar drinks, sweets, fried food, etc. Obviously, eat healthy.<br>  <br>  And finally, rest. Get your 8-10 hours of sleep each night. You will be suprised as to how rest can really help you get in shape. <br>  <br>  Follow all of this, be determined and if you work hard enough, you WILL lose weight.

It sounds like you just need to gain some muscle. Check out www.bodybuilding.com and visit their forum.<br>  <br>  Puberty also helps, haha.|`|blpEpI6raa	First of all, get a subscription to Men'sHealth, one of the best...need I explain? They have many tips for a healthier body.<br>  <br>  For your situation, I suggest you eat high protein and high fat foods, such as salmon and tuna. During those times, workout all of your major muscles with squats, pushups, and situps, coupled with bench presses and curls at the gym about once every other day, 3 to 4 times a week. This will help you lose all of the weight you gain from the protein and fat while toning the extra body mass you gain; meaning you will have a healthier looking body. Trust me, this will make your body look much manlier. (Did I spell that right? o.o)

AA12266052	A carbuncle is a skin infection that often involves a group of hair follicles. The infected material forms a lump, called mass, which occurs deep in the skin. Most carbuncles are caused by the bacteria staphylococcus aureus. The infection is contagious and may spread to other areas of the body or other people.<br>  Staph aureus food poisoning is an illness that results from eating food contaminated with a toxin produced by the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning is often caused when a food handler contaminates food products that are served or stored at room- or refrigerator temperature. Common examples of such foods are desserts (especially custards and cream filled- or topped desserts), salads (especially those containing mayonnaise), or baked goods.<br>  Staphylococcal meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meninges), caused by Staphylococcus bacteria.<br>  Scalded skin syndrome is a skin infection in which the skin becomes damaged and sheds.Scalded skin syndrome is caused by infection with certain strains of bacteria in the Staphylococcus family. During the infection, the staphylococci produce a poison that causes the skin damage. Scalded skin syndrome is found most commonly in infants and children under the age of 5.<br>  Toxic shock syndrome is a severe disease that involves fever, shock, and problems with the function of several body organs. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is caused by a toxin produced by certain types of Staphylococcus bacteria.

WXExyAlWaa	Yes, it's possible. Someone with dissociative identity disorder can have any number of other mental disorders. I suspect it wouldn't often be diagnosed as two separate conditions though because most psychiatrists would be reluctant to assume/believe/consider that the symptoms weren't simply caused by the pre-existing diagnosis.|`|O71xlcG3aa	I think it would be more likely that they have symptoms of schizophrenia and maybe are diagnosed with it before the full onset of the dissociative identity disorder shows itself.  Many mental disorders share similar symptoms and it is very common and easy for someone to be misdiagnosed.  Plus the treatment for dissociative identity disorder is long term and most are never cured but will stay in treatment for the remainder of their lives.  Sadly many with this disorder will committ suicide.  I don't however feel that it is likely that a person could be cured of dissociative identity disorder and then develop schizophrenia. More likely to happen the other way around.|`|hYZIYla0aa	Schizophrenia is caused by  a combination of environmental and genetics in a person,while Dissociative disorder I believe can be caused by environmental problems.I believe you have a good theory there,Great question.It does make a lot of sense.I hope you get someone who really knows what they are talking about with this question.I would like to know this also! Interesting !|`|q1YDp1y3aa	I also agree, its possible to have both. The other poster brought up a good point though- DID is often misdiagnosed as Schizophrenia, so the possibility that someone would be diagnosed with both, even if they actually had both disorders, is highly unlikely. I think once the schizophrenia became symptomatic, most practitioners would dismiss the idea that some of the persons behaviors could be caused by DID, while others come from the schizophrenia. -Neb|`|xnZi0i8saa	Sure, it's entirely possible. I have had Depersonalization Disorder (related to Dissociative Identity Disorder) since I was a young child and developed Bipolar in my teens. Many Disorders are "concomittant", many people have more than one disorder.

sDwN4XuIaa	It depends on how healed the bone is that is for sure.  I broke my 5th metatarsol in my foot dancing 2 years ago and it was broken all the way through.  It took a bit but I was in a walking cast in about 4 weeks.  My guess at least from my personal experience, if they see you can weight bare on it some that you will probably get a walking boot, maybe.  I am no doctor so I cant tell you for sure but enjoy the crutches whiel you can, they really do work on your upper body strength.  I remember my big challenge on those things was going around costco.  my famiyl took me there about 6 times in that 4 weeks in my hard cast.  Also they may tell you to continue with the crutches and not full weight bare on it, but that will help you out and put less strain on your upper body and arms
AA10478980	If you are only 4 stone, you are not fat!!!  Eat a sensible diet, lots of good food, and stop obsessing about weight.  You don't need to lose weight.|`|OItPJZjBaa	I not sure what you mean by 4 stone but, I do have advice for you. First off you don't need any kind of diet pill or drink, trust me I did it without any of that crap. Now, 3,500 calories is = to 1 pound of fat. You want to eat lots of fruits and veggies, whole grains, and foods that are high in fiber, but low in sugar, fat, carbs, and sodium. You will want to stay away from all "white stuff". Drink plenty of water.  Of course exercise. You going to need to do cardio, weight training, and resistance training.  For the weights, just start with anywhere between 2lb. and 8lb. weights. Overtime you should be able to move on to heavier weights. I would recommend keeping a food journal. What you do is you write down everything you eat at what time and how many calories did it contain.  You should be eating every 4 hours. For your snack cravings chew a piece of Extra sugar free gum, it has helped me to get through some of the toughest times. Just remember, Nothing tastes as good as thin feels :) Best of Luck to You :)|`|Sbx0h0eSaa	EAT BREAKFAST.

AA10478980	You don't need to go to a gym.  There are many sensible things you can do that will make a tremendous difference over the long term if you need to lose weight. It can be done in a healthy way. This is what has worked for me.<br>  <br>  Keeping a food journal really does help. It will give you a much better sense of how much you are eating, and when, and why.<br>  <br>  Make a few additional small changes - walk everywhere, always use stairs instead of elevators, walk on escalators, get up and move around at least once an hour if your work or your life in general is sedentary, walk every day, use a pedometer. Walking 10,000 steps a day is a really good idea. Build up to a long brisk walk everyday, or most days. Be more active and watch less TV and spend less time on the computer. Buy one piece of exercise equipment to have at home and be strict with yourself about using it. Sometimes you can find mini-steppers or exercise bikes at second hand stores and thrift stores for just a few dollars.<br>  <br>  Start a weight lifting routine.  Weight lifting will increase your metabolism as well as improve posture and appearance overall. Even if you can't go to a gym you can work out at home using things around the house.  Invest in a good weight training book.  The Dummies series actually has a good one.   <br>  <br>  In terms of diet, cut out or reduce things like junk food, pop, fat, fast food. Eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meat, fish. Particularly if you choose a vegetarian lifestyle include natural peanut butter, hummus, dried fruit and nuts. Pay close attention to getting the nutrients your body needs to be healthy. <br>  <br>  Make your portion sizes smaller. Use a smaller plate - in our society we have become accustomed to thinking that we need a large plate of food at every meal, and we don't. About quarter of your plate of food should be protein and at least half of it should be veggies. <br>  <br>  Learn to count calories. At your current weight and activity level, you may possibly need about 2000 calories or more to maintain your current weight. So you will lose weight at a reasonable and healthy rate if you cut back to about 1600 or 1700 calories a day. <br>  <br>  Eat small amounts frequently, rather than three large meals. Never skip breakfast. Include some protein in your breakfast. It will help get you through the day.<br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water, at least 8 big glasses of water a day, and more if it is very hot, if you sweat a lot, or if you are exercising intensely, and eliminate fruit juices. Fruit juices have too many calories, so get your vitamins from fresh fruit, not the juice. You will begin to see changes in your body. <br>  <br>  Check out websites about nutrition, exercise, weight training, etc. Here are a few helpful links.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nutrawatch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nutrawatch.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.caloriesperhour.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.caloriesperhour.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.helpguide.org/life/healthy_eating_diet.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.helpguide.org/life/healthy_ea...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Lose-Weight-the-Healthy-Way" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Lose-Weight-the-H...</a><br>  <a href="http://weightloss.about.com/cs/fitness/a/aa011503a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://weightloss.about.com/cs/fitness/a...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/no-weight-workout?page=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/fe...</a>|`|tIldpr7vaa	just go jogging, no ID required, and its really good for fat loss|`|u2ZKtLY0aa	a gym?<br>  i'd get a fake i.d. card to get beer, but going to the GYM?<br>  just join 24 fitness. duh ;/

Those spots could be something else, though, like an allergy, or...bug bites?  <br>  <br>  I used to get bitten at an old GF's house because the carpet had fleas!  She wasn't sensitive to the bites, so she didn't believe me until she caught me putting "OFF" on before going inside!

517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Hi Jay, <br>  <br>  Don't feel bad about feeling bad sometimes. For lots of people ongoing stress is the root of feeling depressed, - teens are no exception. <br>  <br>  Your teen age years can be really stressful! You have the pressure of school; trying to grow up and become more independent, while your parents still see you as a kid; trying to "fit in" with other kids; figuring out dating and relationships; finding your own identity, etc., etc. And it doesn't help if people, especially parents are yelling things at you that seem to put you down. <br>  <br>  So it's not uncommon that lots of teens feel stressed, helpless, and depressed. And keeping things bottled up only has them come out in tears and angry outbursts.<br>  <br>  The only thing I can advise on QA is that maybe you and your parents try to work out issues with a counselor. This will slow down your conversations and help you talk in helpful ways, while focusing on the issue. <br>  <br>  You're also under a lot of subtle pressure from friends and TV to look and act a certain way to fit in, etc. It's hard to know what to do if you're not really clear on what's important to you and who you are. Maybe you can even work with a counselor to clarify your values and what's important to you in your life regarding: school, career, sex, dating/relationships, and pressure from your friends, etc. If you do this, you'll know and accept yourself better than your friends probably know and accept themselves, and you can influence them. <br>  <br>  Your teen years are important, though sometimes bitter/sweet years. What you're going through is normal and you WILL work it through. Be patient. Focus on what's important, hang out with friends who want the best for you, and try to get some counseling support.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|UVdviQMPaa	Depression is all about how they treat you and how you respond.

My friend also has a counselor that she talks to. It seems to be working. I think you should talk to one or both of your parents. If you don't feel comfortable talking with them, you can talk to the guidance counselor at school. They help a lot.

As far as the anger issue. it could be hormones or something else. one thing that took away my anger rage was lecithin, but then it stopped, So i tried lithium oritate otc lithium (i have bp) with stopped it. %htp says it makes for a better mood so you might try that.
rRFiSOxuaa	Maybe you're just over doing it, or maybe trying to breath properly while exercising is actually making you hyperventilate a bit.  That would make you dizzy.  But if you're working out and getting your heart rate to the rate suggested by your age and fitness level, you should get a stress test and a second opinion.  Some doctors keep up with new conditions and treatments better than others.<br>  <br>  Nemo has a point...if you're not carb loading before working out, your blood sugar could be getting too low.|`|hz6D5qHUaa	This may seem like stupid thing to say but I used to get the same thing. I tried loads of solutions and then I struck gold. Try drinking high sugar and energy drinks while you work out and see if that helps. Make sure that you drink enough water as well. Try eating slow energy release, starchy carbohydrates as well to power you through.

That means no candy or chips or soda, but also no sausage, low fat posion or microwave Healthioptions dinners. Just eat fruit, veg, dairy and lean meat. <br>  <br>  You have to exercise hard. That means sprints and weight lifting, followed by cardio, 3-5 times a week. Thats a 2 hour exercise session 3-5 times a week. I'm a fulltime student with a part time job and I tutor and I volunteer and I manage to work it in so "I don't have time" is a lie. <br>  <br>  For the sprints - run as fast as you can for 10 yards. Then increase to 20, 50 and finally 100. Don't time yourself, just go as fast as possible. For weight - lift the heaviest weight you possibly can 3 reps, 5 sets on day, the next day lift 75% of that 8-12 times for 3-5 sets and then the next day 40-50% of that 12-20 times for 3-5 sets. Have a one minute break between sets. You should do squats, deadlifts, bench presses, overhead presses and lat pulldowns. Also, do as many pushups as you can when you wake up in the morning and several times throughout the day. <br>  <br>  You may have one cheat day a week where you eat a junk food item of your choice and an unhealthy meal. The occasional calory excess helps your body respond to training better. <br>  <br>  I guarantee you will lose weight if you stick to this without cheating too often. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|QvDOyPjBaa	okay, not eating is not the way to go.  try walking for 20 minutes outdoors.  limit your caloric intake to 2,000.  count calories!  do no, I REPEAT, do not starve yourself!

gRdIvdFJaa	I'm 15 also and i can do about 70 push-ups in a row. I have been doing about 40 everyday for over a year and i recently started doing 50 a day. As far as noticeable muscle goes, i would say you wouldn't gain that much, but you will improve on the number of push-ups you can do. i improved greatly over the past year, plus i feel good about myself. I also work out with weights and if you want to build muscle for your chest i can only recommend benching and eating right (lots of protein).<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|3fsOJXzkaa	idk, but the most i can do at once is 26... but i'm a girl and i don't really work out that much. do them until it gets harder,  and do 2 more. i think that's how many sets  you should do in each rep.|`|d424b0b14aadd5770cf6b69ea71d1fa8aa	Bodyweight exercises!

Therefore, the best and fastest way to rid the THC from your body is by drinking alcohol. The THC is dissovable in the alcohol and of course the next step is for you to do a lot of exercising (sweating) to sweat it out of your pores. However, to keep from getting dehydrated, after a night of drinking, you should drink LOTS of water to flush your entire system and take lots of Vitamin C (you can't overdose on Vitamin C). Keep the drinking of alcohol, water, and Vitamin C treatments up for about 5-6 days. After that, just stick with the water and Vitamin C.<br>  For the normal person who doesn't drink, and didn't drink lots of water or take vitamin C it usually takes 10-12 days for THC to be undetectable in your body.|`|n4TAQj88aa	I think you must drink alot of liquid.

When I went back to the dentist, he put cloves in the sockets and it helped a lot. Not really sure why cloves helped with the pain. Also, I would suggest buying a plastic syringe to flush out any food.|`|BIFzkMVQaa	usually you get the dry socket a couple off days afterward have you gone back to the dentist to have it packed with somthing and put on anti biotics . and it depends what symtoms you have you can have the hole the for a long time as long as there is no jaw pain fever smell dull ache but the dentist you be seeing you on a regular basis so go back to where this was done maybe you might have an ear infection you dont just get one after one month see what happens when the tooth is extracted from the bone the blood clots over the bine with in hrs if the healing process is interupted with the first 48 hrs and the clot is removed but the straw or smoking or sometimes by nature the one is exposed and is so painful because of this so if this did not hapen not likely a dry socket.hope this helps|`|f2e2f494a7ae4b2faab00138d16e7e38aa	Of course it is.

(Associazione Netturbini di Orifizio) è una setta segretissima alla quale è illegale aderire: vi partecipano tutti coloro che utilizzano la carta igienica per pulirsi l'ano (Bleah!). Questa setta fu fondata nel 1833 da Tommasino il Merovingio, un anticonformista francese, celebre anche per il suo trattato "De Anali Cavitas". Dopo alcuni mesi dalla sua fondazione la setta contava già 2 partecipanti ed entro la fine del secolo il numerò aumentò incredibilmente del 75%. <br>  Oggi la setta ha ben 11 12 13 iscritti tesserati che continuano a credere nelle loro insulse convinzioni e continuano a profetizzare l'abitudine blasfema nonchè ripugnante di utilizzare un artefatto nobile come la carta igienica per pulire il proprio orifizio anale. Per la loro eresia i membri di questa setta furono emarginati sin dagli albori della loro fondazione. Con il nazismo ebbe inizio una vera e propria persecuzione degli ANI, che ridusse drasticamente il loro numero da 8 a 7. Dopo che la Seconda Guerra Mondiale fu sedata da McGyver con un elastico, una graffetta e un cesto di vimini, tutti i superstiti della setta sparsi per il mondo si riunirono e fondarono un loro stato autonomo, l'Anatolia, con l'appoggio militare degli americani. Questo stato però ebbe forti conflitti con i popoli confinanti, che non volevano che quella terra fosse inquinata dall'abitudine disgustosa degli ANI. <br>  <br>  Rito d'iniziazione <br>  <br>  La setta dell'A.N.O. è molto ristretta proprio perchè è estremamente difficile entrare a farne parte. Infatti la cerimonia d'iniziazione dei neofiti è tra le più segrete e temute esistenti. Il rituale consiste in una serie di prove estreme, tese a verificare il coraggio, la fedeltà e il tasso alcolico dell'aspirante A.N.O. Il rito è contraddistinto da un'interminabile sequenza di prove dalla difficoltà inimmaginabile e alle quali solo in pochi sono sopravvissuti. Il rituale è diviso nelle seguenti fasi: <br>  <br>  Inserire Nome e Cognome sul foglio di adesione (anche i più tenaci scordano le maiuscole). <br>  Pulirsi l'ano con una speciale varietà di carta igienica detta a ragione "Ahia". <br>  Sapere a memoria la tabellina del 7. <br>   <br>  Curiosita'<br>  In molti casi, e' possibile osservare un rotolo di carta igienica rotolare per strada, immediatamente inseguito da un cucciolo di labrador con seri problemi mentali, a sua volta inseguito da alcune stupide palline rosse chiamate Babybel. <br>  <br>  XD XD XD ....!!!|`|HDB6c0SZaa	Domanda interessante.<br>  Se li appiattisci ad una estremità e li chiudi con del nastro adesivo,potresti usarli come coni per gelati,diverrebbero gelati igienici.<br>  Oppure unendoli con una cordicella passante farne delle collane che colorerai vivacemente con  tocco etnico.<br>  Oppure unirne un centinaio e portarli a spasso col guinzaglio....vedi tu...basta solo un po' di fantasia.|`|VgT2Q7bmaa	fanne dei porta tovaglioli.... lo insegnano ai bambini dell'asilo... non ti sarà difficile realizzarli...|`|pyrqxSB2aa	Inserisci i rotoli negli appositi scomparti più vicini a casa tua.

dOpKsNYcaa	First of all, all of these guys telling you you have phimosis have no idea what they are talking about. Unless a "doctor" has actually seen your penis and diagnoses you with phimosis, don't listen to what people on the internet say when they have never seen it. Your problem may have nothing to do with phimosis (which is an extremely tight opening at the end of the foreskin). <br>  <br>  Some guys have long foreskins and others have shorter ones. You may simply have a longer foreskin which doesn't retract on it's own when you get an erection. A lot of guys are like that. Also how far you can retract your foreskin has to do with how long your frenulum is (the little flap of skin underneath the head, which attaches to the foreskin). If it's long and loose you can retract the skin back farther than if it's short and tight. Either way, you are probably normal. As long as you can manually pull the foreskin back far enough to clean underneath it every day, you are fine. Later!|`|BIU8XLVfaa	You have phimosis.|`|MjRXKchvaa	You have phimosis and you should get circumcised! Don't let anyone tell you it reduces anything they are full of BS! I was cut at 18 and would never go back!

Oddly enough that's how it was promoted in the USA since masturbation was bad, haha. There's a reason why the USA is the last remaining advanced nation still doing it, and even so, it's getting a lot less popular (it's now as low as 14% in some states). Save that as a last resort, as you're doing. That's only one of the few risks, there's more listed here, in addition to the studies and statistics:<br>  <a href="http://forums.govteen.com/showpost.php?p=3069995&postcount=2" rel="nofollow">http://forums.govteen.com/showpost.php?p...</a><br>  <br>  I was the same when I was younger, and now it slides fine with no problems whatsoever. Just pull back your foreskin when you shower the most you can without forcing it, and rub the head. That should encourage it to separate from the head. This is probably all you have to do, since this is common especially with teens. You just haven't 'used' it enough, as in masturbation and washing it. The same goes for sensitivity; the more your rub it the less sensitive it'll get (start using water when you shower then rub a little more each day).<br>  <br>  And if its rather tight, you can get a cream that works in almost 95% of cases. It's 0.05% betamethasone or betamethasone dipropionate. And unlike circumcision it is very cheap ($12 in the USA), painless, and you don't risk decreasing sensitivity/pleasure and making masturbation more difficult.<br>  <a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1677-55382005000400012&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en" rel="nofollow">http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S167...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/pharmacy/prices/drugprice.asp?ndc=00168005546&trx=1Z5006" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugstore.com/pharmacy/prices...</a><br>  <br>  Try that cream.

S7yHKYYjaa	Hola, contestando a tu pregunta, el rivotril y lorazepam son ambos excelentes para controlar la ansiedad, obviamente no es normal que sigas o continúes con los sintomas de ansiedad para los que te fueron recetado, ésto probablemente porque además tengas ya agregado un sindrome de depresion. Lo mas probable es que el nuevo medicamento (lorazepam) que estas tomando no sea la dosis efectiva para ti, pues como mencionas hasta ahora no te ha funcionado, habra que ajustar la dosis y probablemente a?adir tambien un antidepresivo que tambien te complementa y refuerza la accion del loracepam, pues tambien tiene efecto contra la ansiedad ademas de la depresion. Es importante también no satanizar a éstos medicamentos, las medicinas no son buenas ni malas, mientras las tomes en la dosis y tiempo QUE SEAN NECESARIOS PARA TI, la dosis es siempre individualizada para cada paciente dependiendo de su padecimiento y la mayoria son muy seguros y su dependencia es muy relativa (y en el caso de los antidepresivos nula). Como mencionan tambien los otros compa?eros, es importante que complementes la terapia medicamentosa con una terapia psicologica (preferentemente del tipo conductiva conductual), pues esta demostrado que la TERAPIA COMBINADA (psicologica y medicamentosa) es con la que se obtienen mejores resultados en este tipo de padecimientos. De todas maneras es importante que este tipo de dudas siempre la consultes con tu medico para que juntos evalúen el tratamiento y en caso necesario se realicen ajustes al mismo.  ánimo y espero mi comentario te haya servido de algo.|`|7abb0855bccfa3d942c74d0b0a5386f6aa	no lo es, haz psicoterapia|`|dyLeZEvzaa	No, no es normal.<br>  ?Porqué no pruebas el aceite de lino o linaza?<br>  Tarda unos dos meses en hacer el efecto pero no falla.|`|23f08b8af03500107c663dda48830852aa	Necesitas ayuda.-<br>  Contactame.-<br>  Alessdrt765@hotmail.com|`|EKgBeJiSaa	hola<br>  todos los fármacos como química que son se vueven adicción, pero no cura ninguna enfermedad, porque lo que tu presentas es un bloqueo energético en tus chakras ( centros de la recepción de la energía), y lo que te aconsejo son sesiones de REIKI porque te armonizará y equilibrará todos los chakras, porque tienes bloqueo en el tercer chakra, donde reside el ego, controla la emociones y sentimientos, este chakra es muy poderoso por ser el más grande, su <br>  color es el amarillo, de una gran energía como el color del sol<br>  con curación REIKI vas a conseguir, que elimines esa ansiedad, depresión, desbloqueando emociones reprimidas, como el llanto, la bajo estima, etc.<br>  espero haberte ayudado.<br>  mucha luz divina para tí<br>  reikimass terapeuta|`|f6bbbf8db9c819b1b3e7a6b914d4af23aa	No, no es normal.

P1p50SONaa	well you can do it either way. when you switch between a few machines it is called circuit training and it has many benefits and you can learn more about it on the internet if you want. but you can also stay at the same machine. but when you stay at the same machine make sure you rest for no more than a minute between reps|`|WrDGhduxaa	If you are doing reps and sets, do all of the sets on the same exercise before moving to another exercise. Do not move around and then come back to finish the set. If you are doing enough weight you will need more rest between sets than a few seconds. Do one set then rest, then do the next set, rest and finish. If you are trying to tone and not gain strength then use moderate to light weights. If you are trying to gain mass and strength do heavy enough weights that you can not finish all of the reps in your last set, and you should be doing 3x8 or 10, not 15. If you are doing the heavier weights you will need at least 1 minute between sets.|`|AA10357035	do 15 reps then a breather then another set a breather and then the last set|`|e50Q1Ea5aa	stay at the same machine. the 3 sets are to push you to the max.

The weight should be heavy enough that your muscle is tired and thoroughly worked out, but not so heavy that it will strain the muscle.<br>  <br>  Dont workout the same area every day, because then your muscles dont have time to grow.  <br>  <br>  Also, every two weeks or so, change the workout your doing so that your muscles dont get used to the exercise and stop growing.<br>  <br>  You should see some results within two weeks. . . at least I did.|`|P1p50SONaa	ya using heavier weights with less reps will help you build bigger muscles but you will never know how long it will take becuase each person is different and they build muslce quicker or slower. and if you have already been wroking out for months it might take longer cus your muscles have adapted to weight lifting. and also if you are younger like 13 or 14 your muscle won't be fully developed yet so once yoru older they will develop better and get bigger and stronger.<br>  <br>  a good thing that i heard works good for the biceps is called 21s. what you do is you lift the weight half of the ful motion for lifting it and you do that 7 times and then you do thesecond half of the motion 7times and then you do the full motion 7 times. i got this infromation from a very good weight lifting book and it is supposed to work very good for the biceps. though i have never tried it but i plan on doing it once i start working out in the off season again.<br>  <br>  hope this helped|`|fb88a9e61af561380001f8cfb1bbc97daa	increase the weight youre using every few weeks if possible, use perfect form, and make sure you include shoulder and back exercises...I've found that working my shoulders hard seems to help the growth in my biceps...in order to gain mass you have to feed your muscles so I'd recommend increasing your caloric intake by 200- 300 calories a day....I hope this helps!|`|WrDGhduxaa	To gain size and strength you need to do heavy weights and fewer reps. If you can do 3x10 and finish the third set each time add more weight. Since you are doing heavy lifting you need to increase your protein in your diet. Rest at least one day between lifting.

Make sure you are doing preacher curls, chin-ups, hammer curls, and standing barbell curls, I have found these to all be great lifts for size.

Irregolarità dei capi articolari, cioè della superficie delle ossa che fanno parte dell'articolazione, che muovendosi una sull'altra in determinate direzioni fanno attrito e producono il classico 'croc';<br>  2. Il fenomeno della cavitazione intraarticolare: una bolla di gas (probabilmente anidride carbonica, un gas che, disciolto, e' contenuto in tutti i liquidi corporei perche' entra nella complessa rete di sistemi che tamponano il pH dei liquidi organici) si forma all'interno di un liquido (il liquido sinoviale, presente in certi tipi di articolazioni), si espandende per effetto di una depressione locale (creata dal movimento articolare estremo), e poi implode di colpo causando onde sonore e di pressione (e quindi, il 'croc').<br>  Nel mio modesto parere, le due ipotesi non si escludono a vicenda per forza; anzi, ritengo più probabile che ci sia una combinazione di entrambi i fattori all'origine del fenomeno.<br>  Non ci sono evidenze che lo scroccare le dita (o altro) sia causa di degenerazione articolare (artrosi), anche se non c'è molto accordo nemmeno su questo punto.<br>  Ciao!|`|kzK3pSdOaa	hihihi dai marconex ke esagerato!! io lo faccio sempre, non fa male....cioè io mi diverto^^|`|bGMJ1M6oaa	No, non fa male...anzi non appena scrocchiate le dita puoi constatare ke si muovono meglio!<br>  P.S: Cmq questa domanda era già stata fatta, consulta l'elenco prima di fare le stesse domande... :)|`|hnGrL2Heaa	Rovina le articolazioni
Y3EUTUwLaa	It's all about calories in & out.  Stay thin.|`|bVgFCPBAaa	It's my understanding that simple sugars are one of the main reasons for fat gain (with a calorie surplus, obviously) - since they effect the release of insulin; which in turn makes fat storage more likely.  So if you stay away from blood-sugar spikes, and eat a source of protein with every meal - you're chances of fat gain diminish somewhat.  Fats don't make you fat.  Just like any other nutrient, you should try to make sure you are getting your daily allowance.  Nuts are a source of good fats.<br>  <br>  Go here to see an article about fat:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.healthcastle.com/goodfats-badfats.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthcastle.com/goodfats-bad...</a>|`|33ec9786b25a758e90fd4d11ffa1e7e6aa	girl, you shouldn't even be worrying about stuff like this at your age but since you are confused, I will help to clear your confusion. First of all, walnuts and almonds contain oil. Oil is a fat but not an animal fat. Of the 2 fats (animal fat and oil), oil is the better choice. For example, it's healthier for you to eat a big green salad with tonnes of veggies, walnuts or almonds and a healthy salad dressing (about 20g fat) than it is for you to eat a hamburger(25g fat). Look at it this way: walnuts and almonds are the earth's source of protein and fat. <br>  Second of all, stay away from protein shakes and bars. They just add unneeded calories, fat, and protein. If you're eating a healthy and balanced diet (check out Canada's Food Guide for more info) then you'll be fine unless you're an olympic athlete. <br>  Thirdly, don't worry about counting calories. When you make your lunch for school or buy your lunch for school, you know what is healthy and what isn't. Who REALLY wants to be carrying around a calculater or notepad to keep track of all the calories they consume? The other thing is, not all nutrition info for food is accurate. Take an apple for example. You may decide to have this huge apple becasue you're really hungry and figure that it has 60 calories like the tiny apple you ate yesterday. When in reality, it may have 100 calories. Who knows! The coool thing about eating that huge 100-calorie-apple? It's healthy!!!<br>  Fourthly, it is extremely important for you to be consuming a certain amount of fat, sodium, and calories, so please, eat!<br>  Another thing, if you research info online, please be sure it is from a creditted source (like the Heart & Stroke Foundation) and not from some bogus "weightless wonder" manufacturer.<br>  Good luck!
9QtMS91Gaa	Toma unas pastillas que se llaman Streptomagma, Lomotil o Loperán ya que son antidiarreicos.<br>  Si es por algún virus de gripe de esos que dan con diarrea y malestares estomacales.<br>  Tambien las mayeras que son esos malestares de estomago y colón que dan en  Mayo con diarrea y vomitos.

dd060cdd8cbb95273e6536f82ae522e4aa	Sweetie, go to your mom/older sister/aunt/school nurse for help and support.  They can best advise you on things.  As for how often to change a pad, it all depends on how heavy your flow is.  If it's really heavy, you may need to change it every two or so hours.  Congratulations!  You've just started the transition into womanhood.|`|aV0QmAOtaa	Since you barely started your period you might<br>  not get it "as strong" but keep changing your pad<br>  every 1-3 hours so you'll feel more comfortable.<br>  You can also buy the pads that come with little<br>  wet cleaning towels, those help keep you feeling<br>  clean and keep most of the odor away.<br>  <br>  About the pain: you might start getting cramps.<br>  If they hurt you, just take some painkillers/midol.<br>  If you're uncomfortable taking pills and whatnot<br>  drink some hot tea: i recommend chamomile.|`|9z6WBH1Kaa	Put a new pad on when the old one is soaked, or starts to get blood on your clothes, or gets smelly, or is uncomfortable.  Sometimes it's every 2 hours, sometimes only twice a day.<br>  <br>  Roll up the pad in toilet paper & put it in the trash can.  Don't flush it down the toilet!!<br>  <br>  Wipe your self with a little wet wipe or water on toilet paper to feel better.<br>  <br>  You might like a nice warm bath every night with bubbles, while it's going on.<br>  <br>  Be sure to go to the bathroom (especially #2) so you don't get constipated.  Get good diet & plenty of sleep & exercise.  You'll be fine!<br>  <br>  Congratulations! Now you're big!|`|7F9Mzhn0aa	Ask your mom about this.|`|9pRe7vx4aa	well relax for one, your not going to die.<br>  every two to four hours, change your pad.<br>  i wouldnt suggest using a tampon, but if you do dont leave it in for more than 8 hours. change your pad before you go to bed and again in the morning.<br>  just keep changing your pad for the next week or so, and when you done youll notice theres no blood in the pad.<br>  you should keep track of your period on a calendar.<br>  and next month, you could be early, or late. so watch out. :]|`|CornFNw6aa	Okay, well don't use tampons until you're older.. like 20. They aren't for girls/teens.<br>  <br>  Anyways, with a pad, change everytime the pad is full.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it gushes out, like REALLY bad.. And then it gets all over..<br>  <br>  Don't wear white bottoms, and don't wear good clothes. Cause when I gushed out really badly it got all over the back of my pj bottoms.<br>  <br>  Anyways...yeah you either have a light flow, or heavy flow. Light flow is not bleeding so much.<br>  <br>  Also your period should last 2-5 days. If it's 7 or more you should go see a doctor.<br>  <br>  I started my period in Feb and I've only had it three times so far. <br>  <br>  But it is normal to skip periods since you just first started for 1-2 years.. So don't freak out if you missed a couple periods. Some people only get them one every four months.<br>  <br>  Welcome to woman hood.  !! :)
ociWhQdCaa	Nothing eases a broken heart better than spending time with friends and moving on. Go on a few dates and you'll soon forget about it. Just realize that some guys don't have the maturity to be in a relationship nor be able to end one on good terms.|`|AA11440107	It would seem you have a pure heart and have been hurt a lot. If he is on meds his sex drive is poor but he also may not be managing his own life. Others tell him what he likes. A marriage failure can be repaired months later but not a love affair. Timing is everything in love. You will have a hard time proving to another how caring you are. Try to get back in the dating game before deciding on the next one to love . You need a balanced outlook on men and the length of most love affairs. Beyond that time there is usually an arrangement for life styles as time passes and new habits are formed. If you are in a mental health support group you can meet many guys in a short time. Just start dating them in a rotation to protect your  heart for a while. The closure will come as your heart gets the new patches .|`|de5d3718d3b1aa4355cf744569ed18b8aa	You need to go talk to a counselor.

EJg5hXcSaa	protein powder is a very valuable asset in the weight lifter's arsenal. i suggest taking it an hour before lifting and directly after your workout. i also advise you to take some kind of simple carb (glucose, jelly sandwich on white bread, etc) with your protein powder after your workout to create an insulin rush to force that protein into your muscles faster. you might want to also consider protein powder (just protein no carbs) right before bed to give your muscles something to work with while they are healing as you sleep.|`|3eJimW7Faa	The best time to take it is when you are done working out....but you can also take it before you go to bed, and when you wake up..(have it with your breakfast)....those are the best times to take it|`|NwHLU2oJaa	Right after is the best time, since you're probably taking whey protein, which is quickly metabolized--perfect for rebuilding tissue right after a workout.<br>  <br>  Unless you're blessed with the genetics to get big easily, the best way is to eat a lot and lift HEAVY.|`|ORLEzOUcaa	THE BEST TIMES TO TAKE IT IS ABOUT 15 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE YOU WORKOUT, AND RIGHT AFTER YOUR WORKOUT.  THIS ENSURES YOUR MUSCLES HAVE ENOUGH PROTEIN TO WORKOUT (PRE-WORKOUT), AND FEEDS THE MUSCLES THE PROTEIN IT NEEDS RIGHT AFTER THE WORKOUT (POST-WORKOUT), YOU CAN ALSO TAKE IT BEFORE BED, SO YOU WILL HAVE ENOUGH PROTEIN DURING THE NIGHT.
95357efc3ba8d7fb66c1e91e89a10e05aa	you will need a doctor at your size.<br>  <br>  Okay...Here we go!<br>  <br>  This is my theory and this is what works for me. Everyone is different so it may need to be adjusted to your own personal needs.<br>  <br>  Energy In/Energy Out<br>  <br>  Food Intake: 1,200 Per Day<br>  <br>  One Pound equals 3,500 Calories<br>  <br>  To loose one pound per day, You need to burn your food intake plus your one pound of fat<br>  <br>  1,200 (intake) + 3,500 (Outtake) = 4,700 Calories Burn<br>  <br>  You must burn at least 4,700 Calories everyday to loose one pound at least. It is very easy to go up and beyond 4,700 calories each day.<br>  <br>  Best way to do this is to track your progress on a calorie counter monitor watch. If you do it by the numbers you can loose the weight. It is just a matter of changing the way you think about weight loss.<br>  <br>  Once you start wearing your calorie counter you can see the numbers increase and you fill find yourself doing extra things in your day, like tapping your foot while waiting at the light in your car, chewing gum, singing out loud and so on onto of your workout routines. You begin to see that everything you do in your day contributes to the overall numbers needed to loose that pound.<br>  <br>  I, myself, have done this recently. Two weeks later, I lost one pant size and 10 pounds. And that is just my current progress. I have used this method previously after childbirth and have gone from 168 to 127 pounds with in two months.<br>  <br>  I personally burn 1,000 calories by Walking in my community for one hour in the morning and I also burn 1,000 calories by simply using a stationary bike while playing xbox. I get so involved in playing xbox that I completely forget I am pedaling or working out. Think about it..How many hours have you spent playing video games..why not burn calories while you are doing it.<br>  <br>  ___<br>  <br>  Water Intake/Less Storage<br>  <br>  Most people do not get enough water in their system. Water is your body's principal chemical component, comprising, on average, 60 to 80 percent of your weight. Every system in your body depends on water. For example, water flushes toxins out of vital organs, carries nutrients to your cells and provides a moist environment for ear, nose and throat tissues.<br>  <br>  Lack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry out normal functions. To determine if you are getting enough water use this simple formula.. Take your weight, for example 150 pounds and divide by 2. Take your answer which is 75 lbs and change it to ounces, in this case 75 ounces. That is how many ounces of water you need a day. Your body performs mostly on water. If you make sure you get enough water everyday your body will perform at top notch and your body will no longer have the cravings of junk food. You will have a better performing body system to help you work out and feel better thru out your day.<br>  <br>  ____<br>  <br>  Good Food<br>  <br>  My favorite things to eat:<br>  <br>  Avocado Wraps<br>  <br>  Simple: Low Carb Tortilla, Half Avocado sliced, alpha sprouts, lettuce, soy bacon...Just wrap it up and eat. You can vary the things you put inside so long as you keep it to approx 4 or 5 items. You want to make sure they are fresh, low calorie and filling. Avocado and mushrooms can replace meats in your meal and still have great taste.<br>  <br>  Special K Cereals are fantastic. They have that sweetness that one craves and is so good for you. Calories are low. Great for even just dinner.<br>  <br>  First thing in the morning...A Glass of Chocolate Milk. Yup!! Chocolate Milk. We all crave that "got to have" item in the morning. Milk is the best thing you can have for yourself while working out. The chocolate (and you can use Carnation Instant Milk for this but I simply use Nestle dry mix) will give you that sweet "snack" that you need. If you give your body a little bit of it and its in a control way, you will not crave sweets and junk the rest of the day.<br>  <br>  Lean Cuisines<br>  <br>  Fantastic food! Each meal is approx 180 t0 380 calories per box. So think about your calories. 1,200...You can still have several of these meals a day and still be under your intake requirements. <br>  <br>  It’s all about the numbers and watching what you take in and what you burn out. And you know what..If you go over your 1,200 mark for food intake...that’s okay...you simple up your total calories burned for the day by what you took it. So long as you burn off the over all calories to be more than your food intake. Just make sure you stick too it so you can reach your weight loss goals.<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  All you want on the schedule listed below. <br>  Bananas are my favorite. They are very filling and can make a meal all on their own.<br>  <br>  ____<br>  <br>  Vitamins<br>  <br>  My favorite is ONE A DAY WITH ENERGY...I am in love with this vitamin because I am just like everyone else who loves those quick fix energy drinks. But what people do not realize is that energy drinks can contain 120 to 440 calories in just ONE Can. If you think about it..That is HALF of your allowed calories for food intake. The best alternative I have found is One a day with energy vitamin. Easy to spot, it is packaged in a green label bottle. Just One vitamin a day will give you as much energy as approx. 1 1/2 cans of red bull...WITHOUT the calorie intake. <br>  WoW..now your making progress already because you have made more room in your intake calories for actual healthy food.<br>  <br>  _____<br>  <br>  Soda/Carbonation<br>  <br>  Carbonation is terrible for your system because it bloats your stomach. And when your stomach bloats, your jeans just don't fit. You can drop one pant size simply by NOT drinking any carbonated drinks all together..Take away the bloat and you have instantly just made it one pant size lower. Besides, Sodas dehydrate you and with that One a Day Vitamin, you won't need the Caffeine in the soda and it will also cut out those extra calories that you don't need.<br>  So remove that soda and the energy drinks and just think how much calories you just instantly removed from your daily intake. I normally consume what...four sodas and two energy drinks in one day...that is a total of .... 900 calories. Of what??? Nothing...Those are horrible calories and calories that can be replaced by food which will fuel your body for your day and your workouts.<br>  <br>  ____<br>  <br>  Your Body<br>  <br>  Your body is like a computer. You must program your body to do what it is suppose to do so it won't crash and leave you with a virus. Your stomach is only the size of your fist. So think about it right now, Look at your hand and close your fist. Not very big is it. That is how much food you actually ONLY need to eat, each time you eat for every meal. If you eat anything more than that, you will stretch out your stomach which causes overeating and overweight.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is eat every three hours, approx 5 to 7 times everyday around the same time. If you are always giving your body healthy and better food choices (the size of your fist) every three hours, your body will know you are giving it food. It will use that food properly. It will not go into starvation mode or store food away for later because it knows...it will get more in three hours. So what does your body do...it flushes everything out of your system because it doesn't need it..  Now it knows...you wont' forget about it and that food is on its way.<br>  <br>  ____<br>  <br>  Walking Buddy<br>  <br>  This is the best thing especially for woman. Get a walking buddy. One hour everyday. Just think about how much talking, venting and laughing two woman can do together while walking and yup, you guessed it...it just burns more calories and reduces your stress. You now are more relaxed because you can talk and free yourself of whatever is frustrating you while getting into shape.<br>  <br>  :<br>  By: My own experience/Joyceeleann|`|1r9czdD3aa	Stop eating|`|EJg5hXcSaa	you need to start changing your diet and fitness plans. i would be than happy to help you. you can post your workout plans and diet on my forum <a href="http://fitnation.board4u.biz" rel="nofollow">http://fitnation.board4u.biz</a> and i will critique it and make suggestions for you.|`|75c9d97d71594a1bc8d2298756e21d76aa	making fun of people with serious weight problems is not funny..cut the crap...if u were serious you'd be in hospital by now.

DfYnA7Ikaa	There are generally three sizes, regular size, large and x-tra large.  Most condoms you buy will not say the size on them.  If they are just regular size they won't say.  The only sized ones I know of are Trojan magnum large and x-tra large.  The regular sized condoms can accomodate all men.  But some men who are larger feel that the regular sized ones are tight and uncomfortable.   I never knew this until I dated a guy who explained it to me.  .|`|X5jgpHqRaa	There are only two sizes but the regular sized can fit ALL men.

HoITUIFvaa	Hola corazón, sabes, no es fácil, pero si, por lo q dejas entrever, es de seguro q por dolores y tratamientos se ingrese en una anorexia fàcilmente, por lo cual, siguiendo la pregunta anterior a la q te referías a tu amiga, su estado la está sumergiendo en una anorexia, consulta urgente con su médico quien le dará un soporte alimenticio, así como come poco, bien sabes q lo poco q ingiera deberá tener todos los nutrientes necesarios, en mi caso en especial me indicaron ENSURE PLUS, siendo el único alimento ingerido por mi (una latita peque?a) por día, eso hizo q pudiera llegar apenas a mi segunda quimioterapia padeciendo de por medio una severa neutropenia. No olviden avisar urgente al médico, es importante q su alimento sea ya puesto en ella, será la única manera de ayudarla a padecer esto, no son faltas de ella de no querer comer, se siente como q el estomago está repleto y apenas podemos pasar agua. Por eso es muy importante q use ese u otro alimento q le aportará todo lo q necesita, pero q si sea recetado por su medico, no por cualquiera de nosotros, yo solo te comento el nombre del q a mi me dieron nada más, seguramente habrán muchos, pero q sean de laboratorios medicinales y sugeridos por sus médicos òncologos. Que Dios los siga iluminando y brindando amor hacia ella, mientras aquí también en la lucha les acompa?a.

En algunos casos, el sobrepeso es real, pero en otros es sólo imaginario.<br>     Esta enfermedad puede empezar con una inocente dieta, e incluso a corta edad, pues afecta tanto a jovenes como a viejos, y a mujeres y a hombres por igual.<br>     Una vez que baja el peso deseado, el anoréxico pierde el control y quiere seguir bajando de peso, pues habrá una parte de su cuerpo que para él todavía no está delgada<br>     En general, una persona con anorexia pesa un 15% menos de lo que debería pesar, y aún así querrá continuar sin comer para bajar de peso, por lo que restringirá cada vez más la cantidad de comida que ingiere.<br>     Si el enfermo llega a perder de 20 a 25% de su peso, la hospitalizacón se hace necesaria pues ya habrá alcanzado niveles serios de desnutrición.<br>     Algunos de los síntomas físicos presentes en un anoréxico son una constante fatiga, mucho frío, y colitis. También, el cabello se volverá más fino y puede aparecer cierto vello casi imperceptible en la espalda.<br>     En los estados más avanzados, se presenta osteoporosis por la desnutrición y en las mujeres ocurre pérdida de la menstruación.<br>  <br>  espero haberte  ayudado<br>  suerte

vw7AluMoaa	Our skin has tiny pores which are connected to oil glands. Once these oil glands are blocked, either by dirt or obstructed by abrasions and infections, the oily substance (called sebum) they excrete then block the growth of hair follicles, causing pimple outbreaks. Most importantly, elevation of hormones produced during puberty or the menstrual cycle in women result in the hormone by-product called DHT. This hormone by product overstimulates the oil gland resulting in plugging of the pore and acne production. To address this, there are creams and acne products / ointments available over the counter which you can use topically. However, if they seem to be getting worse, it is recommended that you go see a dermatologist or skin expert immediately.<br>  <br>  You must keep in mind, though, that pimples are not deadly. Cures definitely exist. However, it can be a real nuisance to your social life.|`|2ae940be22ef0bbab77b4ad5e7741c21aa	there r too many reasons for which u r getting pimples...first one is the puberty....second is the sun....do u stay outside too long? my sis, friend n me, we all r in our 20s...n because of too much sun exposure we r having this acne problem....n it is i think mainly because of the sweat. other than that, the junk food can also give u bad acne problem. washing face might not help u if you r eating the wrong food. so try to avoid oily junk food. n also as soon as u come from school wash your face...school environment is always full of dust. n yes, thats why even i ended up with pimples many times! buy a nature's cure kit. use it as instructed on the box. n maybe then u will be able to see some differences. but i must let u know that this product has sylicic acid in it which can or cant work on your skin....some ppl get instant result from benzoyl....so u basically have to experiment with the two n see which one works best for u.<br>  n remember one thing, your skin is extremely sensitive. so dont try to experiment with lime or carrot juice since it can contain germs in it that can give u additional breakouts. n also if u want to try some kind store bought protein shake look in the ingredients for argine.....if u find it then dont drink it. most ppl complain that it can give u horrible breakouts.<br>  <br>  well, there is another thing u can use....its a chinese skin care product called qiora....i was sceptic about its strength. but it worked overnight on me...the huge pimple suddenly became tiny. it is expensive though...the whole kit is $150. u can still check it out.<br>  www.qiora.com|`|62192443d82aca4c3fcb0e6cc6c9308caa	I personally use Tea Tree Oil types because it is well-known for its drawing properties, meaning it draws the infection (the pimple) out. I also use it on my acne regularly because it reduces the redness within hours of putting it on, and it works amazingly on my pimples to keep them away. It's very safe and doesn't hurt at all.. It is 100% natural with no "fake" additives in it or anything like that... Best of all it is cheap and easy to find, such as at Walgreens (if you have one around), or at stores that sell health-foods and natural medicines. It is a very common home remedy and is very handy in medicine cabinets or First Aid Kits because it is a "cure-all" meaning it is not just for one thing in particular, it can help with many things. <br>  <br>  I use it, and I love it. ProActiv didn't work for me, and nothing else really has either.. but this stuff has pretty much done the trick.<br>  <br>  Goodluck :)|`|FhLvxXFZaa	ah man, if it gets pretty tough go to a doctors get some medication that will stub the pimples before they get any worse. i wouldn't worry, growing up is pretty tough but your class mates sound like jerks.|`|YzGeCd7laa	Puberty doesn't go away for years dude.|`|toIKOgckaa	It's called puberty. Lol, I'm newly 14, I should know. Wash your face with face-cleanser - I know this might sound "gay" or whatever, but it'll get rid of your pimples. Tea-tree oil is also a good remedy for acne (I had a tube of it, it worked wonders!) Don't touch your face and make sure that it isn't dried out, but it isn't oily, either. You need to wash your face about twice a day or more. If it gets dry you can use moisturizer, I'm sure you could find some in a drug store. There are lots of remedies for acne, and sometimes a damp face cloth just won't do the trick (make sure the cloth is clean of course!). Sometimes there's no way to COMPLETELY get rid of acne but there are ways to have less of it.

You lose weight because of the minimal amount of calories you take in, but as soon as you come off the diet you put all the weight back on anyway. It's not really a long term solution and isn't particulary healthy either because you miss out on important vitamins and minerals from solid food

Por eso se dice cuerpo sano, mente sana. Ya verás que haciendo esto que te recomiendo te sentiras mucho mejor. Y sobre todo no te tomes para ti todos los problemas, aprende a desecharlos y no te ensucies tu mentecita con cosas sin importancia.

Pero si puedes tu hacerlo solito seria mejor. Pero es recomendable que si ya llevamos mucho tiempo nerviosos, seria bueno que te consultaras con el médico. Y algo que ellos recomiendan mucho a parte de comer sano es hacer ejercicios, no ver noticias feas y leer libros de auto ayuda personal, como los libros de Louis Hay entre otros y acuerdate de eso siempre.<br>  <br>  Bye|`|5V1xL3BVaa	mmhhmm...trata con un te de tila, o uno de siete azahares,no olvides tomar complejo B para que ayude a relajar tu sistema nervioso, es lo que yo tomo para poder sobrevivir a la escuela, es duro, pero se tiene que hacer :S|`|J2yenhMFaa	Dios es  Nuestro  U n i c o   y   S u f i c i e n t e   S a l v a d  o r<br>  <br>  Filipenses 4,7 <br>  Dios nos da esa        p a z        sobrenatural q sobrepasa todo entendimiento humano<br>  <br>  Dios es tu medico<br>  <br>  Dios es tu psicologo<br>  <br>  Dios es tu sanador<br>  <br>  Asiste a una Iglesia Cristiana , aquí hay servicio de consejería, es Dios quien habla a través de consejería<br>  Busca el consejo de Dios<br>  <br>  Dios tiene la respuesta a todas las preguntas<br>  Dios tiene la respuesta a todos los problemas<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Esta es una pagina de  un programa Crisitiano : <br>  es Dios hablando para nosotros: en vivo y en directo:<br>  canal cmb: <br>  canal de la iglesia Cristiana : Centro Misionero Bethesda<br>  <a href="http://www.cmb.org.co/inicio.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cmb.org.co/inicio.htm</a><br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Esta es una pagina de  un programa Crisitiano : <br>  es Dios hablando para nosotros: en vivo y en directo:<br>  canal abn: <br>  canal de la iglesia Cristiana : Avivamiento :<br>  en vivo y en directo:<br>  <a href="http://www.avivamiento.com/abn_2007/Html/Franjaprime.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.avivamiento.com/abn_2007/Html...</a><br>  <br>  Bendiciones !!!|`|b90701ec6645974d5016c641bb20e69faa	El te de tila con gordolobo es muy buen calmante, el te o agua de lechuga tranquiliza y ayuda a dormir relajado.|`|q4nIEB0Jaa	Hola!! pues como han dicho la valeriana en pastillas o en gotas, a mi me han resltado mejor las pastillas, tila en infusion, si la compras en un herbolario y haces tu mucho mejor.

AA11765949	You need to see a doctor. Dont try to fix it yourself.
igZc4uEnaa	First, you have to stop measuring yourself by how much you weigh. You see yourself the same as you have always seen yourself. It is called "residual self image" and it can sabotage you if you let it. For example, while I was losing weight, I kept checking the scale and it never changed more than a pound or two a week. I didn't realize I was losing the weight until I noticed my pants fit looser than they used to. When I started, I weighed 165 lbs. and wore a size 14. Now I weigh 155 lbs. but I wear a size 6-8. You must remember that as you exercise the fat away, you are making you body stronger and muscle weighs more than fat. So measure yourself in inches, not by pounds.<br>  Sit-up and crunches will affect your body with good controlled diet and fasting.<br>  Good Exercise and maintained diet will always affect the body structure, if you are living your life with diminishing resentments and stresses.<br>  Thanx.|`|3oS7z0v2aa	Great post!

6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	No soy médico pero por los sintomas que padeces, parecería que tienes un problema serio CEREBROVASCULAR y sería bueno que te viera un NEUROCIRUJANO y no deberías de esperar más, así como también con un cardiólogo por lo del dolor del seno y el malestar que presentas en esa zona.<br>  <br>  No te escribo esto para asustarte, pero mi madre tenia todos esos sintomas que tu describes y por no prestarle atención le dio un ACV es decir un ACCIDENTE CEREBRO VASCULAR lo cual es grave y a Dios gracias y a los médicos se salvo.<br>  <br>  Asi amiga que no esperes más, pide cita con una NEUROCIRUJANO quien es especialista del cerebro y de todos esos sintomas que padeces. A mi madre le quedó problemas del lado derecho, camina ahora con un bastón,y necesitó terapia para mejorar su lado derecho ya que los labios los tenia un poco torcidos. No con esto quiero decir que tu padezcas lo mismo, ya que no somos médicos, pero por lo poco que se de ese tipo de sintomas pareciera que es algo CEREBRO VASCULAR y sería bueno que te hicieran una radiografia cráneal, etc. ya el médico sabrá que hacer en tu caso particular.<br>  <br>  Sabes, también pudiera ser que te golpeaste la cabeza hace tiempo y te pudo salir un hematoma interno, por eso amigo, no esperes más....visita al NEUROCIRUJANO quien sabra que hacer contigo....<br>  <br>  No comas grasas, ni mucha azúcar ok. toma mucha agua  y si puedes tomate todas las ma?anas una aspirina para ni?os, ya que es recomendable y eso hace que tu sangre se vuelva más liviana y secen esos malestares lo que viene de la sangre...yo la tomo sin padecer nada de eso, pero me la recomendaro y lo hago PERO PEDIATRICA ok.<br>  <br>  PERO VE AL NEUROCIRUJANO Y DILE TODOS ESOS SINTOMAS QUE TIENES NO ESPERES MAS, mira que las cosas a tiempo si tienen solución.<br>  <br>  Besitos y que te mejores...<br>  <br>  P.D. Acuerdate que si no das con el médico adecuado, tienes que buscar una segunda opinión...y verte con el expecialista indicado...en este caso no sería un INTERNISTA ni médico en medicina general sino un NEUROCIRUJANO OK. ya que he investigado bastante a raiz de lo que le dio a mi madre y por eso te aconsejo esto...<br>  <br>  De todas maneras entra en <a href="http://www.neurocirugia.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.neurocirugia.com</a> y busca ahí informacion. o en <a href="http://www.atusalud.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.atusalud.com</a>|`|MT89L855aa	............................ con plena incertidumbre me pregunto x q piensas q soy doctor??<br>  <br>  creeo q no he hecho nada para demostrar esas cualidades, mas yo creeo q si te duele algo es por que algo esta mal, yo creeo q deberias ir con otro medico a ver lo de ese dolor de ahi en mas no se nada<br>  <br>  espero q te recuperes
