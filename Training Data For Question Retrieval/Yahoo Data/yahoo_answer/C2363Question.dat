I submitted the first one, but wat about the 2nd one? Its not the way I feel, my dad is not dead, and i do love him. just fyi!      Life's Like That      Cold and grey,   your hair blown astray.   Flustered lost,a windswept sunhat.   It may be confusing, but life's like that.      Nervous with jitters,   heart's butterflies flitter.   perhaps your shy, oh what a drat.   Left in the shadows, life's like that.      Crazy with worry, feeling insane,   riding around, on a destinationless train.   Not sure of where you're going,or even where you're at,   spun like a spinner, life's like that.      Not feeling well, full of regret.   your feelings are obvious, by your brow full of sweat,   full of remorse, you feel small as a gnat.   It's merely human nature, because life's like that.      Now you're happy and elated,   aren't you glad that you waited?   A tire lacking air, my poem's gone flat.   So here's the happy ending,    because life's sometimes like that.      Love's Lacking Cry      I never thought I'd have to push and shove,    just for a bit of my father's love.   He never called me 'Daddy's little girl",   Never spun me in a childish twirl.   He never read me a tale from my favorite story book,   Never helped me make a clubhouse in a small corner nook.   He never danced with me in the rain,   Never kissed away the pain.   He never took me to the rink to skate,   But now its too late.       He never crossed the street, and held my hand tight,   never chased away the monsters in the middle of the night.   He never looked at me in awe with pride,   never came to comfort me when I cried.   So how come I feel his arms around me,   after he's died?

20090309070034AAoFO8H	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Anyone up for editing my speech on racism?	Hi everyone, the topic i have chosen is on racism.      Well firstly, racism is a public act which is done because of the race, colour, national or ethnic origin of a person or a group, which are likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate that person or group.         People are racist and believe it is ok to treat people such as aboriginals with contempt, especially all the jokes going around and name calling such as coons. However it is not ok to do this.         They misinterpret that it hurts peoples feeling. many people are judgemental when it comes to racism and couldnt care less about their age, gender, colour or nationality and this needs to change, so i hope this speech changes your thoughts towards other nationalities.         People think that just because someone has dark skin, that means they are not allowed in this country. This is incorrect.         People often misunderstand their rights in this country and often fail to consider they are human and all humans should be treated equally. All races have the right to be here just like anyother person does.         Another reason why people are racist is because they do not understand the other persons culture, beliefs etc.. So by making fun of them, they think its ok and it helps them to understand the person better in thier opinion.         I am worried about those being abused by racism.   I am worried about those who think it is right to discriminate one of a different race.   I am worried about how kids today are using violence as an answer to racism.         My opinion it that people who discriminate others are the ones who should not be in this country because Australia should be a country where all races are welcome.    So, although this helps people in Australia, it dosen't help the world.. So, although this way might hurt, i believe the best solution would be just to ignore it. After a while they'll know that being racist, has no effect on people, therefore why would they want to waste their time, meaning less racism in the world.

20090227145838AAbTAvY	Education & Reference;Teaching	How do I get a math teacher fired?	I have a Algebra 2 Honors teacher who cannot teach a class. Unlike most math teachers in our school, she does not even have a degree in math and does not know how to teach. Almost everyday is a free day in her class, because she said she had other stuff to do and doesn't want to teach class and she would often be absent. She isn't motivated and often rushes through the lesson so she can do other things.      The way she teaches is by copying out of the book and showing examples from the book (understandable) but her tests and quizzes are from another teacher, a Pre-Calculus teacher. All her tests are made by a PreCalc teacher, since she can't make her own tests. And most of the stuff on the test isn't even in the book and she won't teach it to us until AFTER the test.      Is there anything I can do? Talk to her? Get her fired? Report her?

Public Speech      Dear Mrs Yeo and my fellow classmates. It is a great pleasure to give my speech today! For my speech today, I would like to give my opinion about the statement, ‚ÄúShould studying be student‚Äôs first priority in life?‚Äù       first of all, what is studying mean to me? Well to me, studying applies to us students, who are studying in schools and institutions. You can call it mugging, rensing, but the point of doing so is to enable us to get good education, knowledge and for us to secure a good job. This may change the quality of your life to the best! Thus, you can see that studying is very important, no matter how stressful it may be. That is why it is a priority.      Why is it that when we have higher education, and then get a job to change the quality of life? Well, it is, I believe, is because the more education you have, you can be employed into any job easily, get higher salary so that wee can enjoy a comfortable life, then being a bagger on the streets.      So its true that studying is important, but don‚Äôt forget that social life is as important as studying too! This is so that we have a well balanced life and not making life more miserable. We tend to get really bored easily while we are studying for long time, and that is why, sometimes nothing goes into your brain! So what you were studying for so long, were wasted! And imagine you, studying everyday, without caring about your social life. For me, it will not be too late to go see a psychologist?. To get ride of this problem, We should hang out with our friends and family, or spend time together with your family just to refresh your memory, before your minds blows up!      So lastly, I would like to say that studying is not the only student‚Äôs priority in life, but their social life too!      I will end my speech here; I thank you for your kind attention!

In the late1780‚Äôs, the thought of change and freedom sparked in the minds of people. Those views were greatly influenced by terror, hate, and hunger. The French Revolution changed the history of Europe irrevocably, and caused much destruction throughout France. The man behind that turmoil was Maximilien Robespierre, a man with an infested black heart that used to be a pleasant red. In his youth, he was a kindhearted boy that faced many deaths of family and friends. However, through the years when he was given heaps of authority, his behavior changed, as well as did his beliefs. In the course of a rough time of the French Revolution known as the Reign of Terror, France was in diplomacy due to Robespierre himself. His ideas on expressing justice through terror and virtue were horrifying. Thus, he alleged that terror and virtue were extraordinarily alike. Therefore, Robespierre was a brilliant lawyer that had good intentions, but by receiving ultimate power, he became a vile dictator that led to his own downfall.

The Great Flood of '93   In all of recent American history, there has been no worse river flooding than what occurred on the Mississippi River between late June and the middle of August in 1993. Record flooding affected communities from Minnesota to Missouri. Iowa and Illinois joined those states as the hardest hammered by the floods. At St. Louis, Missouri, the river crested at 49.6 feet‚Äîmore than nineteen feet above "flood stage." It was six feet higher than any level that had been recorded before.       Of the 1,300 levees that had been built to contain Mississippi River floods, more than 1,000 failed. Almost 50,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, and more than 70,000 people had to move because of the floods. Damage was estimated to be between 15 and 20 billion dollars. Worst of all, 52 people lost their lives in the great flood of 1993.      1.) what kind of writing is "the great flood of '93" ?      a) drama   b) expository   c) poetry   d) short story      2.) which scentence from "The great flood of '93" conains an example of figurative language?      a) Iowa and Illinois joined those states as the hardest hammered by the floods.   b) Record flooding affected communities from Minnesota to Missouri.   c) Damage was estimated to be between 15 and 20 billion dollars.   d) Worst of all, 52 people lost their lives in the great flood of 1993.         3.) in '93 how deep were the flood waters of the Mississippi river at St. Louis, Missouri?      a) as deep as a basket ball net   b) deeper than a 1 story building   c) deeper than a 40 story building   d) as deep as a coal mine      4.) Which BEST paraphases the 1st scentence of "the great flood of '93" ?      a) The Mississippi River flood in 1993 was the worst river flood in American history.   b) The flood of 1993 was the worst river flood ever.   c) The Mississippi River flood was destructive, costing both money and human lives.   d) It is hard to imagine a flood worse than the one that happened in 1993.

20090309091211AAzDgZj	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Help with English paper possibilities?	I am going to write a paper proposing a new law. My professor suggested that I stay away from just amending new laws like lowering the drinking age to 18. He wants us to think completely outside the box. My initial thought was having a law that required every citizen to turn in their fingerprints at 18. This would help in missing people cases, and most importantly with criminal cases which was my main source for this proposal. But we had a debate in class and people were saying that DNA finger printing is faulty and how sometimes cops only get partial prints from crime scenes which could lead to possible suspects.  I was wondering if you guys can give me some proposals for new laws that you might wish to see happen. If all else fails I will still stick with my old topic. Thanks for the help, most helpful answer gets best answer. AND please only serious thinkers.

Can anyone read it and tell my the mistakes?   Thank you and a big ciao (hello) from italy!      Today I have decided to talk about the Haida population, because two summers ago I had the opportunity to go to their land and meet some of them.    Haidas are native population of North America who live in the archipelago of the Queen Charlotte Islands, known in the Haida language as Haida Gwaii (that is land of Haida).   Those islands are in front of the British Columbia cost, in the west Canada.   To go there it‚Äôs necessary to drive along a long beautiful wild road to Prince Rupert and then to catch a ferry.   The navigation takes about six hours, but in my opinion it‚Äôs very exciting.   In fact I was in the bow of the ferry, where the cold wind messed up my hair, and I could see some whales jumping and the islands coming closer, little by little, waves by waves.   The Queen Charlotte Islands were covered with fog, this is normal for most of the year, I could see only some part of the green land, which appeared and disappeared.   The atmosphere was very strange, unreal and I felt as I was catapulted in a movie of the ‚ÄúPirates of Caribbean‚Äù.   In the island don‚Äôt live a lot of people because it is difficult have contacts with mainland, especially when the sea is rough, so a large part of the islands are covered by the rainforest.   In the northern part of the main island there is the village of Masset, where the most part of natives lives.   When I went there I was very lucky because I had the honor to be invite to a traditional Haida ceremony, which is called a potchlac.    Today Haidas usually wear European clothes but in that situation the most important people of the clans wore the traditional ones, singing their songs and eating all together.    That was a strange situation for a European man who is used to be the majority, in fact that time we were ‚Äúthe others‚Äù, the different people. We didn‚Äôt know le languages, the customs, the foods and we didn‚Äôt know exactly how and what we have to do.   At the beginning of the ceremony everybody began singing songs and the bosses went into the big room wearing traditional dresses. Everybody in the room set up and after a little procession the bosses set down and the dinner began.   The song with which the procession came in was this one.   In that time there were the Haidas of both clans. In fact the Haida belong in one of two clans, the raven or eagle. The choice of clan was done maternally at birth and the marriage among the Haida has to consist of a person from each clan. Their tradition is matrilinear, and women are very important and respected in their society.   Every family has her totem pole with the symbol of her clan and their own story, in fact totem poles rappresented family lineages and privileges.   In the south islands there are two ancient Haida villages where the population lived a lot century ago. One of those is the village of Skedans where we went by seaplane. There are the relics of the ancient village and very old totem poles.   Haidas believe that everything must return to the nature, so they aren‚Äôt restoring the totem poles. Because of that the old totem poles are going to disappear.   Another symbol of the Indian culture is the Dream Catcher like this one.   Indians believe that dreams, both good and bed, descended from the night sky. Bad dreams were captured in a web and held there until the rays of the morning sun evaporated them. Good dreams slipped through the web on to the dreamer.    I like that thought so I put one of them over my bed.

I know there is a word for a verb used as a noun (gerund/gerund phrase), but is there a word for when you use a noun as a verb.  Perhaps because it isn't legitimately accepted in grammar, there isn't actually a word.        For instance, "We should go coffee together."  While it is obvious it doesn't sound right, we do hear it every once in a while.        I was just wondering if there was a specific word for it.

20090309110149AA7KGCe	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Does this sound good? Any incorrect info. 9/11 Conspiracy.?	my essay on 9/11 Conspiracy         September 11th Conspiracy Theories      Most people believe that on September 11 2001, Middle Eastern terrorists attacked America‚Äôs very freedom, while others believe that it was a day of deception, betrayal, and treason by the American government. In a survey of 1100 Americans, an exceptional 36% people believe in this cabal (Scripps NP). It is reputed, by believers that federal officials either participated in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon or took no action to stop them "because they wanted the United States to go to war in the Middle East." It is also speculated that 16 percent of Americans believe that the fall of the World Trade Centers ( including WTC 7) were caused by the aid of secretly planted explosives in the buildings, not burning passenger jets.   In over 100 years, fires have never caused the collapse of steel- framed buildings. In only one day, three steel- framed buildings collapsed. FEMA's Building Performance Assessment Team (BPAT) blamed the collapse of World Trade Center 7 on fires, but admitted to being clueless on as to how the fires had actually caused the collapse (WTC7.net NP). The implosions of any other building could closely be related to collapse of WTC 7. The debris was located around the center axis of the former building. The size of the pile from the 47- story building was no more than two stories high. Also, the pile was almost entirely within the footprint of the former building.    How could WTC 7 possibly fall from raging fires, when in 1991, One Meridian Plaza, Philadelphia, (another common steel- structured building) had burned for 18 hours and only lost eight of the 38 floors? Many reasons could have led to the supposed controlled demolition of WTC 7. The motive argued is that there was a secret command bunker in building seven from where the attacks were coordinated, so it had to be demolished to hide the evidence. The Secret Service, CIA, and the Pentagon all had offices there and there was a New York City command center there on the 23rd floor, which was closed for civil emergencies.    Beside the occurrences at World Trade Center 7, it was also seen that WTC 1 & 2 could have been controlled demolitions as well. When the North and South towers fell, they seemed to fall straight down, popping out each floor one by one, almost as if explosives were being used. In the case of a controlled demolition, miniature explosions, generally called squibs, happen about every ten stories. Squibs were commonly seen. Another interesting incident was firefighters and police officers even proposed explosives could have brought down the buildings.     According to a seismic report the Flight 93 in Shanksville, PA was recorded to have crashed at 10:06 am, but the 9/11 Commission reported the crash at 10:03 am. Police Officers stated that debris was scattered on a trail of up to 6 ‚Äì 8 miles. Some think that it was possible that in the 3-minute difference the plane was shot down.    A Boeing 757 is 155 ft. long, 44ft. high, and has 124 ft. wingspan, weighing at almost 100 tons. At its narrowest point, the hole in the wall of the Pentagon measures 18 ‚Äì 20 ft. wide. Conspiracy theorists wonder how a plane of that size made a hole so small and left no outside wreckage to walls. It is argued that a pilotless drone, 1/3 the size of the average Boeing 757 could have crashed into the Pentagon. All windows surrounding the hole were still intact: books, desks, and chairs had no burn marks. Normally the estimated 5300 gallons of fuel in the plane would have smoldered for days with devastating black smoke, burning all surrounding objects. The Freedom of Information Act required that the CCTV time-lapse video be released to the public; the FBI confiscated all other videos immediately. The Sheraton National Hotel has a rooftop camera; hotel employees watched the video in awe several times before the FBI confiscated it for ‚Äúinvestigation.‚Äù the film has never been released. The Virginia Department of Transportation has cameras that would have filmed the aircraft as it flew over Route 27; again, the films have never been released. As the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense has every inside and outside inch of the Pentagon is under constant video surveillance, yet the FBI refused to say if any other videos were recorded.    The FBI claimed that Hani Hanjour was the responsible hijacker for flight 77, piloting and crashing it into the Pentagon. Although Hanjour had taken four months of flight school in Arizona, he was denied the request to rent a plane in August of 2001, for not completing his coursework at school and for failing the three required tests to rent a plane. It was obvious Hani Hanjour was not a skillful flyer.     ‚Ä¶It is doubtful that the best-trained fighter pilots could have executed the maneuver that supposedly crashed a 757 into the Pentagon. It required making a tight 320-degree turn while descending seven thousand fe

I wanted her to start school because i thought i would be a wonderful experience for her. She has a baby brother who is 1 and i thought it would be good for  her to be around children her age. The preschool teaches them there body parts, helps with potty training, teaches them to share and to identify people and object by there names it also helps them learn colors. When i heard this i thought great and was really excited. She has been doing really good so far she is identifying object by names and saying short sentences. When i call to check on her they say she is doing fine no fits etc. My question is how do i make drop off easier for me and her. She cries hysterically and when we get there she doesn't want me to put her down. Also the drive to school is about 45 minutes and we have to go through curves she throws up at least twice a week any suggestions on how to help her with this problem? thanks.

20090309115829AAmxpKx	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Are there any grammatical/spelling errors in this essay?	I'm doing a report for this thing called MARSS (Math, Art, Religion, Science, Social Studies) fair at my school, and I had to do it on St. Albertus Magnus. I wrote a five paragraph essay on him, and I was wondering if some of you wonderful people will read the essay enclosed and tell me any grammatical errors I made. Oh, and don't say anything about the paragraphs not being indented; they are in the Word Document I have of it.      St. Albertus Magnus was the patron saint of scientists. He lived from 1206 to 1280 A.D. During his lifetime, he made many notable accomplishments. He was an educated and religious man. Albertus Magnus is also called ‚ÄúSt. Albert the Great‚Äù for his many great accomplishments.                          Albertus Magnus was born in 1206 in Lauingen, Swabia. He was the eldest son of the Count of Bollstadt. St. Albert the Great was a scientist, philosopher, and theologian. He went to the University of Padua and went on to teach theology at Hildesheim, Freiburg, Ratisbon, Strasburg, and Cologne. He died on November 15, 1280 at Cologne of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Albertus Magnus lived a long and logical life.      St. Albert made many great accomplishments during his lifetime. His writings filled 38 volumes in print. He was an authority on many subjects including physics, geography, astronomy, mineralogy, alchemy (i.e. chemistry), and biology. He re-wrote the works of the philosopher Aristotle to make them acceptable to Christian critics. He was the bishop of Rome for about two years and was the only scholar of his age to be called ‚ÄúThe Great‚Äù. His many accomplishments sometimes inspire people to become scientists.     St. Albert the Great was a very educated and religious man. He became a Dominican in 1222, even though his parents opposed it. At one point, he considered leaving the Dominicans, but the Virgin Mary came to him in a dream and told him that she‚Äôd intercede for him and that he could gain divine wisdom if he stayed with the Dominicans. He wrote books on botany, astronomy, physics, mineralogy, geography and chemistry. In one of his geography books, he stated that latitude affects the climate.     St. Albertus Magnus lived a very long life for someone of his time (even now it would be considered a long life). He made many superb accomplishments during his lifetime. He was an intelligent man who was very dedicated to his religion. St. Albert can sensibly be called ‚ÄúThe Great‚Äù for many different reasons.

Unfortunately I do not know the first thing about how to apply to do a PhD. What do I need to tell the university that I am applying to and how much roughly does this type of Academic course cost?  I am interested in researching the live performing Arts in the UK but specifically Audience Development practises and methods  - I felt too embarrassed to ask my tutor any questions - even though he is doing his PhD. I was afraid that people will turn around and tell me that am too thick or dumb.   I graduate this summer with a PG Cert in Arts Management but I am willing to re-try to do a Masters degree again in a years time, when I have raised the funding. I do really want to do the doctorate but am at a loss as to how I even need to begin. I am grateful for all the advice that I get but even more so if anybody either studying their research degree or have already achieved their research degree could get back to me.

I saw how bout if I clear the memory. he said no. so i went back. then some kids asked me if I wanted to borrow the calculator and i said no, cuz he'll be a dick about it. what pisses me off is this fat kid whose on the baseball team, (my teacher is the baseball coach ) borrowed a calculator from another kid after he did his work on it and the teacher didn't notice. but the teacher knows the kid doesn't have a calculator (he jokes about it and never has it) and last time we had a quiz the teacher lent him a calculator.
