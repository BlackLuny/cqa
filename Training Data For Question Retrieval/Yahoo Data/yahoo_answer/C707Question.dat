20090129083335AAHPKoj	Family & Relationships;Friends	What did I say that was so wrong?	My friend and I went on a trip to Los Angeles.    The first night we were there, she got "sick."  She said she had a sore throat and felt listless.  The reason I put sick in quotes is because on our first night there, she said, "What sucks is I know this is the best I'm going to feel for the next 5 days."  I was like, "What?!"  She said, "I'm getting a cold.  Tomorrow, I'll probably get congested."  I'm sorry, but NO ONE can determine with that kind of accuracy what's going on with them.      Anyway, we've been back from the trip for a few weeks.  Last night, we went to dinner and I teased her a little bit about getting "sick."  She got mad at me and I told her, "Maybe if you had kept a positive attitude, you would have felt better.  You got convinced that you were going to get sick, so you did.  It's like a placebo effect."  Now she's furious with me.        What exactly did I say that was so bad?  I mean, isn't it absolutely true that it's impossible to determine how you're going to feel the next day?  If she had kept a positive attitude, she might have woke up feelling great the next day.      What am I missing here?

20090129083419AADuaUB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm not in love with him anymore, what can i do?	I've been with my boyfriend 1yr and 10 months, we already have a baby boy of 5 months, the reason i'm still with him is because of our son. My boyfriend is really obsessed with me, he has beat me up already (yes i made police reports) he beat me up on 08 new years because i didnt want to drink alcohol (he says i'm boring) but thats because i was pregnant and under age. I feel that he is very irresponsible i left him when my son was 2 months because we got into another arguement of me not drinking so he was about to spray me with pepper spray, and told me he would take my son away, i wish he would leave me with out the abuse, i dont want my son to see all the things that happen with his mother and father. Everytime i tell him i dont want to be with him, he becomes very histterical and starts breaking things, so i just pretend i was just playing so he would stop.

20090129083656AAc90jA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I go out with this guy as a friend without my boyfriend?	A friend of mine asked me to a comedy show this coming week. We had gone to prom together in highschool like 8 years ago and I recently got back in touch with him and had him over for new years. My current boyfriend and I were not officially dating yet at the time but we were on the verge. Well my friend ended up asking me out, but I said no I just wanted to be friends because I was pursuing my current boyfriend. My boyfriend got really jealous because my friend was showing me attention, and my friend thought that my boyfriend was immature and controlling because he was jealous. So needless to say the two did not get on well. So my friend asked me to this comedy show and I want to go, but I don’t want to go without my boyfriend because I don’t want my boyfriend to think it's anything more than it is, but I know my boyfriend and my friend wont get along and it will be weird if my boyfriend goes. I really want to stay friends with this guy, but how do I do that and not upset my boyfriend?

If you hooked up with a girl and that was all you wanted from her, would you call her 3 days later just to see how she was doing? I hooked up with this guy and he called me 3 days later and said he just wanted to see how I was doing, we text so I'm thinking that he could of just texted him a hello rather than call.       We've hung out a couple of times before we hooked up and he's 22 and I'm 24, don't know if that might play a role.

20090129083812AAfrY3U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are virgin men a turnoff?	This is especially targeted to women that are no longer virgins. Would it be a turnoff to date a guy that is still a virgin. I'm a 20 year old college sophomore and have never had sex. I'm 6'7" 240 lbs pretty good looking with a muscular/athletic body, I'm really smart, nice and shy until I get to know people. Sometimes I feel like a girl wouldn't want to date me because she's had sex and wouldn't want to wait for me to be ready. I've had chances with drunk girls, but I want my first time to be when I'm in a very serious relationship. So would it be a turn off or not to date a guy like me?
20090129083754AAMqIR8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is he doing this to me?	my ex and I started talking again we talked for nearly a week and he was so happy I had called him and we decided one night we were going to get back together.  Next day he tells me that he is "kinda dating someone", and he is confused, I ask him if he loves me he says "yes" family says new girl will not last, have caught him lying about her to make me jealous, and is hyper concerned with were I am dating.  Also this new girl is NOT his type whatsoever, she works at a very trashy bar, and has been described by his friends as "fat" and "skanky" He is a preppy, Abercrombie style guy, who normally wouldn't be caught dead in a dive like where she works.  I think he is punishing me for breaking up with him, and I am so sorry I don't know what to do.  How can I prove that I am sorry and will never hurt him so badly again and to come back home?

20090129083740AAcrXwd	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do British men like to call "ring" women?	Having a long distance "getting to know you" with some flirty undertones with a nice gentleman from England (sorry that is the best way to describe it). I'm an American girl (smart and attractive). He is over 40 and single and has a very good job that keeps him busy. We met here in the US and stayed in touch (nothing romantic happened). He calls when he says he will, but not often. I"ll call him or he'll call me (or we'll text) once a week or so. But when we talk it is over an hour.     Someone told me that British men tend to be less "chatty" and won't call as often as American men. I know all men are different but perhaps there is some truth to this. Or maybe he just isn't that into me? Do British men tend to want the girl to do the calling?

20090129084014AAgNWUQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do u think this guy sounds like an idiot or am i being too harsh?	caught this guy at my uni look at me quite a lot- like stares quite intensley, it has been going on like this for 2 months.i noticed him first look when he saw that i was coming out of the entrance from quite a distance, as he was walking past with his friend he stopped to watch and would not look away until i turned my back and walked off in the opposite direction. After that time i've noticed if i look at him he looks away, but when he thinks i don't know he stares and somehow always spots me in a crowd. When i'm talking to other guys i've caught him turning around every few seconds to look at me and looks like he's saying something to his friends about me as they also look at me. i've also caught him staring when he's sitting behind me in a lecture. I thought he would not bother to stare after we had a months holiday and thought he would have forgotten about it all, but he still stared the first day back and also when i was at the photocopier machine, he walked past me really close and then stopped to stare with a grin on his face and then just walked off with his friend. do you think he's just another loser from his behaviour who just likes to stare now and again?

I need to think of items to include on the tray.     PS. Everyone will be able to take 1 item home with them, so they can't be too too expensive but be good enough that people would want to take something home.

Like for example this one girl just looked at him and I totally flipped out. And I flip out even when he just talks to another girl. I know I'm going way overboard here,  but I can't help it. I don't know what to do. I love my boyfriend and I seriously want him to be the right one, and I know I'm holding on too tight. I keep telling myself to stop, but I just CAN"T. I've been through a lot of abuse and rape by boyfriends and people. And I know that me still trying to get over my past is playing a role of why I'm so protective over him. And its not just girls either. I don't mind him having guy friends, but I still get a little jealous because they take his attention away from me. And I'm very very protective of myself too. I hate other people looking at me, I hate guys, I just think there disqusting. And I notice I look at girls more than I do guys. But I'm inlove with my boyfriend, and i won't even but just look at girls, that's as far as I go with them. But I just flip out when somebody even tries to flirt with me (Sometimes even girls) or try anything with me at all. And I'm thinking maybe me being so protectvie of myself too could be the reason I'm so protective and jealous over him. Because I care about him just as much as I do myself. I don't know what to do. Can ya'll please give me some advice??

20090129084350AAeMHlR	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	If you're a father who lives far from child how often do u see him and how do u keep a good relationship?	My son is 4 years old and his father and I just split up in May 2008. We both moved to different cities. He moved to a city 5 hours from his son and I. Seven months later he is engaged. The problem is, he has only seen his son three times in 7 months. Our son is so young but he is taking it really hard because he doesn't understand. He went having his dad around 24/7 when he wasn't in school to seeing him once every couple of months. His dad will say he's coming and then back out the day before he's supposed to come. He said money is an issue (even though he makes three times more money than I do and doesn't financially support his child) so I offered to pay for his trip. He said okay then today (the day before he's scheduled to come) he backs out. He just keeps saying he can't come. No other explanation. My son cries for him and when he talks to him on the phone he asks him to come see him and his father tells him he's coming so he goes to the door and looks for him. My son is in special education at school because his progress has reverted since the move. I really see that my son needs his father but his father is not doing everything he can do to be a part of his life. If you're a father who lives far away from your child, how often do you see your child? How do you keep a good relationship with your child? How do you be there for your child?      Anyone with any other insight will help.

20090129085154AAkGCeH	Family & Relationships;Family	My 10 year old brother is getting bullied verbally pretty bad, what can I do to help?	He was so upset yesterday and my mom asked him so many times whats wrong but he wouldnt tell her but then last night around 10 I woke up and went to him room and sat down with him and talked about it and he told me everything. I mean I broke down crying myself. The kids at his school tease him, talk behind his back and don't let him join in games. They call him Lice Mike just because they assume that when the gell in his hair dries and flakes, thats lice -.- idiots. I talked to him and told him not to think he's baby talking to the teacher about it. I told him i'm very very very sorry for saying anything hurtful in the past and I never mean it by heart. Its always my anger talking and I will control it in the future. What else can I do? BTW I told my mom about it.. He's 10 and i'm 14.. So I don't go to his school to do anything about it...   I told him to talk to the teacher, maybe hang at the library and find kids there who usually hang there and maybe play outside with them or try making friends with people in other classes or grades. (he's in gr 5) I have never seen my brother so depressed and sad in my life..
20090129085353AAZlM3k	Family & Relationships;Friends	Was I right to cut ties with my friend?	on the Tuesday just gone, my girlfriend came up to visit me. My friend, (or former friend now) although he wasn't invited, came out for a drink and a meal with us. He also imposed himself on our trip to Liverpool, and throughout the entire visit to Liverpool, consistently flirted with my girlfriend. My now former friend said that is was just a bit of lighthearted fun, but neither myself or my girlfriend saw it that way, in fact, it didn't just really annoy me, it also seriously upset my girlfriend. This morning after work, I told him that I didn't want to have him as a friend. He told me to lighten up about what had happened.      Because of his stupid and inconsiderate behaviour, and despite him igorning constat requests to stop what he was doing, was I right to cut ties with him?

We've discussed marriage but he used to always be the one to bring it up and say how he can't wait to marry me one day. Recently he hasn't been bringing up our future or anything relative to marriage.      I was telling him about a dream I had the other night and that he proposed to me in the dream and when I woke up and was kind of depressed because it wasn't real and he didn't say anything.      Why do you think he didn't respond to what I said about my dream?

Ok, so I have 1 kid and my sister is pregnant with her first. Like 6 months ago we were talking about what we are going to name our future kids. (Because I want more and at the time she wanted some too.)    And I told her if I have another boy I want to name him Jayden, and she said if she has a son she will name him Brandon. She's four months pregnant now and she don't know if it's a boy or a girl yet. But she just told my mom that if it's a boy she's gonna name him Jayden.     So, she stole my name. But she's got one on the way and I don't. Should I let it go, or should I confront her about it?    Do you think it would be messed up if she named him Jayden and then I have another son and name him Jayden too?

As soon as everyone found out she keeps trying to break us up and ruin our relationship. she writes emails to everyone including my boyfriend regarding how much of a "****" i apparently am. which i'm not. and how scene boys shouldn't date scene girls because they're all sluts? she also wrote my boyfriend a loong email about all the bad things i'd "supposivley" done when we were younger and friends. which none of these things ever happened. A lot of times she also walks right up to my boyfriend and flirts with him, literally in front of my face. i tell her off all the time, but it really hurts to have to go through this. my boyfriend also tells her to just stop being so immature and etc but she will not stop !? she's pretty much ruining my reputation everywhere. my boyfriend doesn't like her but says eventually she'll find a different guy and move on. it's not that i don't believe him but as much as i tell her off, she starts another stupid email, or makes a huge scene.   can someone please help me with what i should do ?   thankyouuuuu !

He recently took a major pay cut (45%) in order to keep a job with a company that his company merged with.  He is desperately working to get promoted with his company.  Additionally,  he is working on finding different housing that isn't so expensive.  He also taking his ex back to court to either A) have is child support eliminated or B) have her pay him child support (they have the kids on a 50/50 basis).  He is also working to get assistance with health insurance and whatever he can.  He really has a lot going on.      I have noticed a change in him in the last week.

20090129091148AADO7ax	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need to know if I should just talk to her...?	ok.  I have asked a similiar question before, but I'm not sure people quite understood, so I'll give it one more try..    so my fiance' and I have been together for over 4 years and we will be getting married in june.  We are moving back to thetown where we met in may, and it is a small town.  When we met I was very insecure with myself and believed that all men cheat.  He has broken down my walls and showed me he is a good man.    That said, when we met he was friends with one of his exes, and she was an aquaintance to me (we were friendly) and I asked him to stop talking to her cold turkey.  He did just to prove to me that nothing would get in the way of us.  Now that we're going back there, I know at some point we will run into each other, or they may,, when I'm not there.  I know this girl is on myspace, and I am contemplatingmaking small talk with her and letting her know we're coming back.    Should I talk to her before things would be awkward for any of us...or should we just be friendly if we do happen to run into each other.  She was very nice and never once did she do anything wrong to me or act in any inapproriate manner towards my fiance'.  She was crushed when we just stopped speaking to her.      The last time My fiance' saw her,, he was in a checkout stand at the store, and she yelled to him, and he ignored her and walked the other way.  And she just called after him "what did I do?  Why won't you talk to me?" And that was the end of it.  I feel like I was being childish and I should let her know it was me.   I don't plan on eingbest friends with the girls, but would being civil hurt??

20090129092741AA4zyP1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Sister-in-law problem?	Yesterday two of my six sister-in-laws stopped by my house when I wasn't home.. I was at work.. my husband had given them his key to get in as he was running late from work and they wanted to use our house to change clothes for a funeral.  He was about 30 minutes behind them.  I don't mind them there and would have welcomed them if I had been there so really them being in the house wasn't a problem.  When my husband got there he discovered them going through my stuff..   I am of a very different religion than they are.. I am wiccan and they are catholic.  They were going through my religious items... messing with my altar that is set up in the spare bedroom, looking at my books on my craft and wiccan beliefs and going through my clothes closet.  These women aren't teenagers... one is in her thirties and the other is 46.         He was shocked and had quite a fight with them.  I am upset but not nearly as upset as he is.  I have been married to him for over 30 years and have dealt with these sisters of his being the way that they usually are.  They most times do not act like this in front of him but sometimes they slip  up and he catches them like yesterday.  I must say this is the most serious slip up they have ever done.        I do not want this to make a rift in this family.  I love my husband too much to want to make an issue out of this.  He loves his family very much and needs his sisters despite their problems with me and my religion.  He has no problem with who I am and I don't have a problem with his beliefs being different than my own.      How do I defuse this but at the same time make my sister-in-laws know that they went beyond the line here by invading my personal space... something they had no right to do?      My husband is considering not talking to or see them again.  That breaks my heart for him.  Any ideas?

She has post natal depression it has been confirmed.   But she is intent on me not seeing my child.   If all that is ordered is the above, will i ever get to see my child outside of this centre.

20090129095633AAYWDuY	Family & Relationships;Family	My grandparents hate me because I'm not full blooded Asian but half Jamaican, they called me a mutt!?	I haven't seen nor spoken to my grandparents since I was 8 (that's 7 yrs) but a couple days ago they suddenly showed up at our front door with 5 suitcases and gave us this lame *** story bout how my grandfather had a 'business meeting' to attend to in the u.s. so they would be staying in our apartment for a few weeks. My mother and her father don't get along, it's a long story but he kicked her out when she was 18 and pregnant with me. It had nothing to do with the fact that she was 18/pregnant/unemployed/un wed but the fact that my father wasn't Asian. I have two twin sisters (one lives with my father) and my grandparents love them because they look 'Asian' they could pass easily for full blooded Asians while me on the other hand......couldn't pass for anything other then black. Ever since they got here they have been praising my little sister, bragging about her 'perfect' grades, her 'perfect' smile, her 'perfect' hair, her 'perfect' friends, her 'perfect' attitude, her 'perfect' religious beliefs. They have been treating her like a goddess, they even bought her a $300 ipod and a $60 pair of shoes. I don't get great grades but I try my hardest for what grades I do get, my sister doesn't even have to try. She get's good grades anyway. Everyone spoils her, I know life's not fair but I should at least a "you did a good job" or something! They hardly even said hi to me! After not seeing your grandson for 7 yrs I think the least they could have done is say hi to me. They act like I'm not even here and when they do say something to me it's always negative. Yesterday my grandfather called me a mutt and told my mother I looked like my father (normally I would take that as a complement but not the way he said it....) he basically said my face was ugly because I was black. I was right next to him when he said it! The least he could do is say it behind my back rather then to my face. I don't want them here, they should go back to were ever they came from! The last few days have been hell, it's been an all out war between me, my mother and my grandparents. I can't wear the clothes I usually wear because they say it doesn't look 'proper' they threw away all my rasta books and I'm now I'm being forced to go to church with them. I don't understand how they can think it's okay to barge into someones home force them to change their beliefs for no reason other then they don't believe in it themselves. My mother has done NOTHING to help this situation! She can't even stand up to them, I'm starting to hate her as much as I hate them. She lets them cut me down all day, she doesn't even correct them when they say something rude. She ignores it like she didn't hear it. I can't stand it, I never cry NEVER! But in the last 3 days I've broken down 5 times crying. To make everything worse, today my mother announced that we're gonna be moving for the second time this yr because of my sisters school 'situation'. First we moved from oakland, ca to were we're living now. I loved it in ca, all my friends were there and it's were I grew up! I lost all my friends when we moved, I'm just starting to fit in here. I can't handle going to another school in another state and having to try to fit in all over again :(( I don't know what to do anymore!        Is there anything I can do to make them like me? (my grandparents and the kids at my new school) I need advice!
20090129090509AAkV8c7	Family & Relationships;Friends	Would you get caught for lying about your age on ebay?	Okay so here's the deal, im 17 years old and im in my second year of college. I've tried to get a part time job but because of recession my application just keeps getting rejected, and as you know money's pretty tight for college/university students. As much as I hate cheaters and liars im a popular guy and I got party's to go to and things to buy. So be honest and tell me what you think if I lied about my age to sell things on ebay, and most importantly would I get caught?  Oh yeah before you say wait till your 18, I'll have to wait 8 months and I can't do that.
20090129092008AAKUAg3	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend has come to me with a problem and I have no clue how to help?!?	Among my friends Im the one that they come to for advice for anything thats going on in their life, and I dont mind. But this instance, I dont know what to say to her.      My friend has a good friend from high school whom she thinks of a part of her family, and both of them would do anything for each other. Well recently my friend has developed a strong sense of love to her other friend who is a woman, if you havent already guessed. My friend isnt a lesiban or bi and neither is her love interest. She doesnt know if she should tell her friend the truth about her love for her or just to supress it and move on. Her love interest is open minded but Im not sure how open minded when it comes to something like this.      What would you say if you were in my position? Throw all caution to the wind and go for it? Or just remains good friends and drop it altogether? Thanks!

20090129090353AAB63Uw	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is this Valentine's Day gift childish for a 29 year old?	I have been with my boyfriend almost 2 years. I am 29. Last year I was 28 and it was our first Valentine's Day together. We were together about a year when V-Day came. Well, I got him a ton of nice gifts and he was going to send me flowers at work, but got really mad at me for something stupid and never sent me flowers. I think that was wrong and mean. Especially for him to come out and tell me that. So anyways, all he got me was a medium sized bear and a heart box of chocolates. Now, I am not greedy or anything, but is that a bit childish to give a 28 year old girl? No dinner or anything? Im worried about this Valentines day now. I dont think he knows any better and I want to tell him not to get me chocolates or a bear this year. I bet he won't know what to get then. If I dont say anything, I am sure thats what he will get again. I am 29 and I dont want more bears or chocolate. I would like a nice dinner and something else. Does he not care about me enough since he doesnt make an effort to plan anything or do something nice?      I said to him a while ago that I would like a nice piece of jewelry from him so I will always feel like he is with me. Nothing expensive of course. Just something small. He agreed, but never got it. Also, he will never ask me to go out to dinner on his own. I always have to ask him and then we go. I dont get it.      I also have been asking for 2 years telling him that I would like to go to Atlantic City and he just wont go and wont take me because HE has no interest in that. Thats fine, but if its something I asked for really bad as a birthday or Christmas gift, then why wont he do it? I think so many things arent fair. I cant get him to do anything I like to do. It's always what he wants to do or what he says. What can I do here?
20090129091049AAOtnUB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What age range should i be looking to date?	I am 25 and looking for a nice gentleman to settle down with. i know no man is perfect but i find that the guys that come my way tend to have one thing on their minds. I havehad people ask for marriage but they just did not know how to treat a woman and i refuse to be treated like a piece of meat. Now the men that really seem to understand me are in their 40s right and never had kids or something like that. when i do date them they look so much older and people say oh he could be your daddy or some thing like that. i guess my question is within what age range should i be looking at. Thanks.

20090129091238AAXyuJl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Did cunnilingus improve our relationship?	I'm divorced and found a girl I like. She very intelligent, nice, and a good person. She tells me she hasn't had that many sexual partners and it has been a long time since she has had sex. When we finally made love I performed oral sex on her. Since then our relationship seems to have become much deeper and richer. She calls more often, buys me gifts, and says she can't wait to see me again. I think the way she feels in genuine and not infatuation. But can oral sex make a relationship more exciting and fun? BTW my ex hated oral sex. Thanks for any advice.

20090129090034AAesRC9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Please Help! I had sex with another man. I've never, ever cheated before in any relationship but I'm married!?	I don't know how this could have happened. I have always been faithful in relationships. Now I've done a stupid thing and I don't know whether I should tell my husband. I'm not excusing my actions AT ALL. However he has been so cold to me and I've been telling him for months that I was unhappy, that something was wrong, and that we needed to fix our marriage and he kept denying there was a problem. I thought I could make myself be happy, or pretend everything was okay, and it just hasn't worked.  I know I'm low- I should have never cheated, but the other night I found myself giving into feelings I've had for our (yes his friend too) close friend for a very long time, and I guess he felt the same way. I don't even know how it happened because I'm really not a bad person (well, at least I wasn't) and this friend is a really good guy too, except for this. I'm so confused! I don't want to hurt my husband, and I want to make the marriage work because it is the right thing to do, I guess. That's what i was taught growing up, but I don't think I love him anymore. I mean, if I did I would have never allowed myself to cheat, right? I really need some advice or if anyone has been through this please help. We do have a very young child together. I don't know what I should do. And I don't know if I should tell him, or if I should even stay married. I know- I'm fucked up, you don't have to tell me.
20090129090646AAm0se2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Issues with husband! (sex, porn, masturbating, etc,etc)?	ok so my sex life with my husband isn't so great and i need some perspective on what's going on with him. i'll start with the porn. i have never had a problem with porn in a relationship till now. he watches porn occasionally (found that out on my own) so suggested we watch it together. since we have been married he has only watched porn with me twice and each time he seemed uncomfortable and like he wasn't enjoying himself. i feel if he can't enjoy something with me that he shouldn't be doing it on his own. same thing with strip clubs. he loves them but would never take me to one....wtf? he also like to "get off" by himself in the morning before he goes to work. i have asked why he doesn't wake me up so i can have a little fun with him and he says because he doesn't want to wake me, i need my sleep. yet he wakes me up 20 mins before he leaves so we can have coffee together. none of this would be a problem i guess if i was happy with how much sex we were having, which i'm not. i feel like he doesn't want to involve me in so much, it's killing me. i have tried talking to him about all of this but nothing has changed. so....what do i do? what's going on with him? what am i doing wrong???

How long in terms of time elapsed from meeting them; time in terms of the amount of dates you've been on; etc.  I know most will say, "when it just feels right."  But certainly I don't think anyone should be asked out within the first week of meeting a person.  So, IN GENERAL, how long would you think is average?  Just a thought.  Thanks.

He is a thoughtful man, great cook, romantic, great communicator, and patient, not to mention the sex is mind blowing.  It is all really sweet, but it freaks me out, and I want to run.

20090129095319AAeMVCt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he REALLY going to marry me?	We've been together for 2 1/2 years. Lived together for 1 1/2 of that. We have pets together and get along great, until I bring up marriage.       He says that he's in love with me and we have looked at rings, but every time we talk about it he has another excuse. For instance at first it was because he wasn't ready, then it was because he didn't know what kind of ring to get, now it's because he doesn't have the money to get me my "dream ring." But to me that doesn't matter, I just want him to commit.      My concern is that he is just happy with the relationship the way it is and has no intention of making me an honest woman. He says things like, why can't you just be happy being in a loving relationship the way it is. But the truth is that I want more, I want to marry him and I don't want to wait forever.      So do I just wait it out, for how long... or move on??

20090129100207AA7yvoH	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does Scorpio man like me as more then friend?	OK here goes. I am helping my neighbor out with his girls because he is going through a nasty divorce. I am married but in the process of trying to get a full time job and leave my alcoholic husband of 20 years... I have 2 kids and he has 3. He knows my situation. His divorce it similar to my relationship, his soon to be ex is also an alcoholic and liar and he also has stayed in his 11 year marriage for the kids. Here goes I went into this relationship just helping and being kind because that is how I am. well about 3 months into it I could feel my self  falling in Love. He talks to me a lot and comes over and sits on my front porch and sometimes we talk about his crazy soon to be ex and everything that is going on or we talk about other things even sex. He once told me he was very sexual.    He comes to me for just about everything about the relationship with his ex and children he ask my advice and listens to what I have to say. When He looks at me with those eyes of his and just smiles and stares I feel as if I could have an orgasim. We do a lot of cutting up together and flirting. He asked us to go places with him like to a Christmas get together at his work and When the girls and I go out to eat sometimes he gets one of his girls to ask where we are going because he might meet us and he usually does and he asked us to visit his church that he is a member of. When I say us I mean me and my girls. His kids love me and my kids love him and we all enjoy spending time together. The only problem is I am still living with my hubby and cant leave right now. So i don't know if I should ask Scorpio if he has feelings for me or just likes me as a friend. When we are together I feel as if we connect on a  level I can not even explain..

20090129102741AAge9W1	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it a good thing to be known as 'nice'?	I know your probably thinking well obviously ! but I mean there are so many ways to describe a person. I started a new job and Ive heard a few of the old people there saying 'shes nice' .I probably should take it as a compliment but when you try your best to make the old people laugh and get them stuff and listen to everything they have to say and then they just think of you as 'nice'  you kinda dont really take it as a compliment? its hard to explain!      And another thing. How could I get people to think of me as older? Everytime I help someone they always say 'good girleen' or 'good girl' Im 17 , 18 in a few months and I think they just see me as a child. One woman (who works there) asked me my age and when I said 17 she said ''really?, I thought the most you would be is 15!''

20090129121942AAguXze	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I Love My Fiance But is this healthy?	So here is the deal. I am in Texas at Sheppard AFB about to PCS to Nellis in Las Vegas. He is on a 2 year tour in Japan at Misawa AFB that he just started in December 2008. We were planning on getting married in June 2009 but he decided that he wanted to have a longer engagement so we've agreed to wait a little bit longer than expected. Yes we met in tech school and havent known each other too awfully long. But we click. Problem with waiting is we most likely wont be stationed together for quite some time after we get married because he will have to complete his tour and i will already have my assignments somewhere else. But other than that, Its hard only being able to talk to him only 4-6hours a week and not seeing him is even harder. And although I love him, certain sexual needs are not being met with him being gone and its really hard to fight off my past thats trying to come back to me. I want he and I to work out because he is amazing and he still wants to make us work and spend his life with me. We are both young 20 and 18 but we feel like this is it for us and we want it to work. We wont be able to even see each other again until June 2009 and then maybe Christmas 2009 after that. I just want some reassurance that its gonna work cuz i'm going insane without him here. Its hard. But life is hard. So should we keep fighting? Or is the distance to great to hold a healthy relationship/engagement? Please help!
20090129101758AAb4oRt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does your husband/SO try to get you to make phone calls for him?	I am so sick of this!!!  He finds something on craigslist, e-mails the person, yada yada, gets their number to set up a firm price or meet-up.  Then he says to me, "Can you call them?"        It is usually something I know nothing about like tires or a lawn mower.  Most times, he tells me questions to ask them that make no sense to me.      We have gotten into several arguments because I have refused to call, this morning being the most recent.      He says he's shy.  Painfully shy.  Okay.... He's a musician!!!  He's on stage at least twice a week!!!  He meets new people all the time.  I remind him of this and he says that he's shy on the phone with strangers.  That's an awfully specific brand of shy.      If I refuse, he gets all mad and then acts like I'm a horrible person.  He gives up on getting whatever it is and it's usually something we need that he's getting at a really good deal.      I have gotten roped into dealing with so many things for him and I am tired of it.  I have so many responsibilities of my own (I'm in school, we have a 6 month old, I pay all the utilities, etc.).  Now, I deal with his ex-wife because he wasn't returning her calls.  I had to deal with a lemon car that he got from a shady dealer and it was only my perserverance (after I told him not to buy it, I might add) that got our money back.      I am tired of calling people on his behalf.  I have talked to friends and they say that their husbands are like that too, so I know I'm not alone.      No matter what I say, I'm the b!tch for not taking two seconds and calling whoever he wants me to call.       How can I get him to make his own phone calls?  What the hell?      I'm not scared of the phone, but I'm not his mother and I'm not going to coddle him!  He's an adult, he needs to make his own calls like a big boy.

20090129092610AAKpWtr	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Did/Will anyone be skipping over the white dress tradition? ?	We have been thinking a lot about our wedding and it finally seems to be coming together nicely. I have tried on a couple of gowns in store and am pleased with them but I have a lilac ball gown in my closet, that is almost silver because it reflects light so well it has silver embroidery and crystal beadwork, it truly makes me feel like a princess, has only been worn once and is absolutely gorgeous. I know 'tradition' is white, but my mother wore a pink dress to her wedding and my mother in law wore a red dress to hers. I think they were kind of hoping I would go with white because they didn't but I think its kind of cute to carry on a non tradition. I see a lot of brides looking at alternatives and just wondering what thoughts/personal experiences are

20090129100152AAgc2Cg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband being stingy? ?	my best friend is a convert to islam as well as myself. she married a muslim man and they now have a baby together. he makes about $600 a week ,they have their bills as we all do. she has requested for him to buy a car because she wants to be able to grocery shop,do laundry and possibly find a job. she currently with the baby takes public transportation and walks everywhere with her baby. making it impossible to pull a laundry cart and a stroller. he works from 8 am until 8 pm 6 days a week and will not change jobs though he hates it. he complains he doesnt make enough money to buy a car. though me and my husband have 2 kids,he has a less paying job and we are buying a car very soon to help us with the shopping ect. he flat out refuses to buy a car saying you need to make $60k a year to have a car. in islam you must spend on your wife what she needs. you must not be stingy and you must also not force your wife to get a job if it is not a nessissity. (she wants to raise her child and be at home with her) he makes the money but wont spend on her. he also said he refuses to pay her school debts and so she must get a job to pay for it herself. she has studied in her religion and knows it is best for her to raise her children and take care of her home is more important. he refuses to agree and says she needs a job to buy these things because he doesnt want to. yet she finds new clothing of his ,and he pays for trips to places that he went alone while she was going to have her baby any day. it seems to spend on himself is no problem, but if something she really needs he says no. any advice?

20090129111624AAi8uXl	Family & Relationships;Family	Ex is consulting surgery for our son?	A HUGE PROBLEM HERE and need opinions or advice:      My soon to be ex-husband has scheduled a surgical consultation for our son while our son is in his care.      His parents (a rehab doctor, and a stay at home mom) told me 2 years ago that they thought our son was herniated. I had it checked out by my son's Pediatrician at that time who said that it was normal for the testicles to retract for my son at this age and he wasn't herniated --- as suggested by my in laws. Our son never acted out of sorts in regards to his privates. Now my ex went to his Pediatrician in another state (where he is now living) who diagnosed him with Inguinal Hernia. They have a surgical consultation the Wednesday before the Sunday my son is set to be returned to me.      I'm frantic, and alarmed. I want a 3rd opinion. I don't trust this. Two Pediatricians used by two parents who are separating have conflicting diagnosis. All these questions come up: Would my ex actually have our child undergo a surgery just to keep him longer? Would he jeopardize his health in this way? We were bickering back and forth about our son having cereal for dinner. But this is serious! I'm stopped in my tracks and left a message with my lawyer. I'm very worried. Would he actually allow our son to go through surgery without consulting me? We have a temporary shared custody order set up until something permanent is resolved. I'm very worried about this. This is not bullshit. This is serious.      Somebody please give me advice!
20090129095718AAlRdOi	Family & Relationships;Friends	Really dont have any idea what is going on with him. any ideas?	Ok so my ex and i somehow i ended up talking sex a few days back, then yesterday i msgd him asking ''will you be horny tonight?'', to which he didnt reply and then i again asked him that if you dont wanna talk just tell me, to which he again he didnt reply, then i called him to ask what is up with him and he said ''i have not paid my bill so i cant reply and i also dont feel like'' and hung up. i felt a little angry and msgd him "i was just looking to pass my time with you, and i have no interest in having sex with you, i already lost my virginity to a guy i like"      The next day he replies back ''go and have sex with your guy''      I said ''as if that bothers you''      He says ''why did u talk sex with me?go and have sex with your new guy''       I said ''i dont want to''      He says ''then you wanna sex with who?''      I said ''no one''       He says ''tell me are you attracted to me?like me?have feelings for me? or just wanna talk sex?'''      I said 'i feel sexually close to you, that is all" and he gets angry and calls me names.      Can anyone tell me what is going on with him? He always knew that i was into other guys so our sex talk was just casual. but why did he get angry the next day and ask me all those questions the next day any idea? Is he just not interested in me anymore or does he still have feelings for me?

20090129100036AAyLM3t	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me back?	I thought I'd ask this question mainly for guys because they obviously know how they go on when they like a girl. But girls are welcome to answer too.      Being Jehovah's Witnesses we don't just go up to one another and say, 'Hey I like you, wanna go out with me?' it has to be more subtle, like over a longer period of time.      But anyway, this guy is about 6 years older than me (but I don't think that's something bad because my grandparents have 10 years between them, my aunt is about 5 years younger than her husband and my best friend's sister is about 6 years older than her husband). I've had a crush on this guy for about 4 years.      Last night I went to a congregation meeting, and he had a 10-minute item on the platform about the latest editions of the Watchtower and Awake. I was looking at him almost all the time, even while other brothers and sisters were answering. During the whole of the talk he kept looking over at me almost every, like, 10 seconds or something, and while a few were answering he actually looked over at me instead of the one answering.      Recently he's also been talking to me a little more. It's kinda hard for him to talk to me and vice versa because I'm with the girls and he's with the lads, but when we are like alone looking at the noticeboard or whatever he'll talk to me.
20090129121131AAdJVBR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you like this type of a girl?	A decent, very attractive, professional,stable, tall, soft spoken girl, who is very selective about finding a partner, but, only wants long term.      Would you find her rather high headed?
20090129113050AAKoqHi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies: Who has a better chance? ?	When it comes to dating... there will always be competition. I'm curious as to know what types of men have a better chance of landing a date (because of how women are initially attracted to them)?      Would some of you agree the tall and handsome (as well as dark) usually get a woman's attention over someone who is short and unattractive?       How about men who are financially wealthy as opposed to those earning median to below salaries?       Now there are the men with hair and those without and those losing a few. Who fares better?       Thoughts ladies? Be honest with yourself and everyone. We won't judge you (no matter how shallow you think you are). So there's really no point in apologizing. It shows you're being honest and that's a good thing!

20090129114245AA3pud4	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do I have a voice on the abortion issue as a man - please read below?	I have asked questions about it and there is always some rationally bankrupt chick who gives some simplistic dismissal to my valid arguments. And many of you are this chick. It goes like this: "You are a man; that is reason enough for me not to care what you think. You never have been pregnant. You never will be pregnant. You dont have the right to tell a woman anything in regards to it, end of discussion."      To that I would reply "I'm not a doctor either, I guess I have no right to discuss the ethics of health-care either. I'm not a policeman or lawyer so I suppose my opinion about justice in society is worthless. But why stop there? I don't have children an don't want them so I guess I shouldn't tell a parent to stop abusing their kid."      Are there any rational libs who see the glaring error in the mindless chick answer? I'm not trying to be facetious here. There's always an intelligent lib in every crop, but I don't want to make that hasty assumption.

I tried to talk to him but he genuinely doesn't see where I'm coming from! He tried to make me take out one of my friends out of my bridal party so I could have one of sisters be a part of it. Mind you, his best man and I have really bad blood between us, but I still won't tell him to take him out because of this. He had the final word with the color... ok fine. Then I showed him my idea of having different dresses for the bridesmaids and he said that it's tacky and he said no. I showed him a bunch of dresses that I like (wedding gowns) and he picked one and said I should wear that one! Now I can't even pick my own gown? He asked his mother to pick the DJ and to find flowers. I don't have a say in my bouquet! Now I suggested having our twin daughters be flower girls and he said no his sister is asking his cousin to do it! I'm so frustrated I tried talking to him but he said I got to pick my bridesmaids and the color. I did in a way but had to fight a lot for it. How do I make him see that I don't even want to be a part of this because he's completely taking over every aspect of this wedding! I understand he's paying, but that shouldn't mean I don't have a say!

20090129094948AA5ZEvq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Nrrrrrrrrggggghhhhhhhhhhh...?	I had a great friendship with a 26 year old guy (I'm 17, though..) and in a point of vulnerability, I convinced myself I liked him more than a friend. So, in aggravation, I typed a somewhat inconspicous blog about it and he found out anyway so he sent me hate mail. I called him a lot and he never answered, but later called me back to apologize and tell me that he thinks I'm an "amazing and creative person." but it sounded sort of like he didn't want to hang out anymore, even though he told me we would. My parents won't let me, though. So he told me I could call him whenever. So I did, and I was still confuzzled about our friendship. So I told him I was confused...but not what about. He told me he'd call me back later because he had to go eat...then he never did and he deleted me as a friend on myspace without saying anything to me. He's in Clevland at the moment...until Monday....rar I don't know what to dooooo.

20090129115307AA0T9YE	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you think i owe my friend an apology? and would it even matter now if i did apologize?	my friend got jumped by some guys and winded up in intensive care for 4 days. he almost died. i was in a meeting that i couldn't pickup the tel when he called.this girl said i should play hard to get so to SPeaK an not call him bk rt away. i called him bk 4 days later. i wanted so bad to pick up the tel that day or at least call bk the next day. i didn't .when we finally did SPeaK, i didn't apologize for not calling and i guess i didn't seemed that concerned. that's because i was afraid to be myself since i'm only a friend and want to be more. i can't hide my feelings. he hasn't spoke to me since and i guess i can't blame him. i tried text ing him on 12/25, but got no response. he doesn't want to talk to me anymore. i guess i should just leave it alone ha? i need help, this haunts me alot, almost everyday
20090129105046AAZmP6n	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I Call Him Or Not?	It's been a week, he was acting really strange last time I saw him. He was quiet, barely looked me in the eye and was upset when I questioned him about whether or not he had a job. Nonetheless, we had really good sex, he was very affectionate afterwards. Took me into the washroom and rubbed water across my eyelids and his. We kissed and he told me that he'd call me.      I changed my phone number the next day, because I was getting crazy messages from a guy I had dated before him. I sent out a text message to everyone letting them know that my number had changed, but I have a very popular name & some people were confusing me for someone else. So should I call him just to make sure that he got the text message and has my new number also just to call and see how he's doing?      I know there's all these rules about women calling men, let them chase you, let them call you first, but should I call him or not?

20090129100149AAdKhiP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I've been so angry lately and not myself?	The past two weeks or so I've been so irratable and short tempered. It's not like me at all, everything just sends me off the edge. I got into a fight with my boyfriend earlier, through his shoes in the snow, then cried uncontrollably for about an hour afterwards. I'm 17, could it just be hormonal? I feel like I'm going crazy. My emotions have been up and down, I'll be so upset and then just start laughing and get over it quickly.
20090129102048AAInvQr	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should I stay with my boyfriend who has tons of baggage?	Here's the situation...I have been with my boyfriend for about two years. He was separated from his wife when we met and they never had a normal marriage. (resided with each other for any amount of time) He told me that he had 4 children with this woman bit was skeptical of actually how many children belonged to him. He informed me that his wife has major psychological problems. Early in our relationship, she accused him of molesting their children. Her children were indeed molested but by their half sibling. I didn't give much thought to all this drama but about 6 months after we met, I became pregnant with his child. So the relationship of course became more serious. Anyway, I have a son from a previous marriage and the daughter that we have together. He attempted to divorce his wife once but didn't pursue his petition. He had petitioned for divorce again because I informed him that I would not be his mistress eternally. His soon-to-be ex-wife says that the first kid is indeed not his and he was aware of that when they started dating. He thinks that 2 children are his and that the last one does not belong to him. I am not sure whose story to believe. He is awaiting paternity testing on the last but is not concerned with expediting the process due to lack of financial resources. He ran his own business until his mother sold the building he was using for his used car business. I also feel like I am supporting him as well, as if he is one of my children. I do know that I don't have really don't have any issues other than finishing college while raising my two children the best I can. Am I wrong for thinking this guy has way too much baggage for me and is really only weighing me down. I know that as you get older (i am 29) it is hard to find people without baggage but does anyone else think this is ridiculous? I want him to be a part of his daughter's life but all his issues exhaust me!

20090129103524AAcJUDK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I get him to sleep by himself now, after I tried for so long for his to sleep by himself?	My Husband and I are getting a divorce and I have moved in with my Mother for the time being.  My Husband and I NEVER let my son sleep in our room and especially in our bed. Since I have moved in with my Mother, I have laid down with our son (20 months old) in his toddler bed while he falls asleep. He does not do this at Dad's and when I go to my own bed (about 2 hours later) he wakes up and comes into my bed. We are sharing a room right now, I know it's not the best situation but it's all I can do right now as my Husband left me and I am pregnant with our second! So, now he will not fall asleep without me and once, I come in there he comes and lays with me.  He isn't really old enough to understand a rewards program (i.e. get a toy for sleeping by himself).  When I try tough love and let him just cry it out, he just gets out of the toddler bed and comes out to find me. Trust me, my goal is to get out of the living situation as soon as possible but that's kind of hard b/c I will be having baby #2 in May. Do you have any suggestions?

20090129092158AAQXBeL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would you help your ex wife in this case?	My wife and I divorced in 2007 after 12 years of marriage.  I must say it was not the best of marriages but I  do not hold anything against my wife. She made some really immature decisions while we were married that caused a great deal of problems between us. Her son also came in between us especially after he became a teenager.  After the divorce she wanted to keep our house which I agreed to but even then I was wondering how in the world she would pay the high mortgage. Long story short, they foreclosed on the house several weeks ago and she is going to lose everything. I feel so badly about it and would like to help but not sure if I should interfere.  I thought about giving her a little cash(can't give her a lot) but didn't want to send the wrong message, like I wanted to get back with her. What do you guys think?

My husband was previously married and they resided in Minnesota but she filed for divorce in the state of Kentucky.  We currently live in Wisconsin.

My husband is currently laid off and they are seeking my income information to base the payments on.  The ex-wife is employed full time, so how am I more responsible for this payment than she is.

20090225125853AAH1vH2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like black guys but my mum hates them. What do I do?	Today I went to the bank with my mum. She is Indian. We were in the queue together and he was in front of us in the queue. He kept turning around and staring at me. It seemed as if his neck would break. My mum made a comment about him in Punjabi. It was something like "black idiot!"   I told her that she should not say that. He got his phone out and tried to ring someone. Eventually, he turned around and spoke to me in French. He addressed me by name and he said hello.   My mum went apes**t in front of the whole queue, asking him why he was speaking to me. The poor man just said hello to my mum but he was not rude to her. I was incredibly embarrassed. I think he knows me through another friend and I do not know how to apologise to him and explain my mum's behaviour as I do not have his number.   She has decided that she hates black men because I went out with a Jamaican guy for 9 months who treated me very, very badly. She found out after the 9 months and when she found out that he had insulted my entire family, including my disabled father, she decided that she hates black men and that they are all good-for-nothing visa seekers, looking to marry me and leave me.   She wants me to marry a nice Indian man with a good family background and lots of money. I am 27 and attractive. I have had 3 relationships with two black men and one Arabic guy. I did not fancy the guy in the bank today (hence he didn't have my number) but I find myself more attracted to black men.   I do not live with my parents but I feel I would really upset them if I go with a black man. Her face went red today in the bank and she looked like she was going to burst into tears. I was actually concerned that she may have a heart attack or kill him. I just wanted him to shut up.   I know I am 27 and this is a free country but what can I do. That's my mum. She has turned racist because of a bad experience that I had. She is even going on about arranging my marriage because I am 27. She would rather that I date a white guy than black.    But how can I help who Iam attracted to?   She said that she will disown me if I ever go with a black guy.
20090225130732AAf6n1O	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, two quickies! positives/negatives and this girl?!!!!?	Alright first question.   Im about 5'6" (6 foot when im done growing, yay), everyone says i look kinda lik tom cruise at school (like not joking, i sorta do, they say) and im muscular (like really a lot). Are these good things? or good attributes? im fifteen btw.      The second is about a girl, well duh, who i like a lot.   We havent talked at all since i told her i like her, and her friends keep saying go talk to her. Its been like a month and half, and nothing. Although, the past few days shes been randomly taking looks at me. Like today, i just saw her pass in front of me at lunch, and when i was about to exit the lunch room, i saw her turn and look at me as i left form the corner of my eye, like turn her head completely. Do you think she likes me at all? Shes perfect in my eyes, an heart, but i dont even know how she feels about me...???? What do i do or think about this?      Thanks a bunch.

20090129115757AAY1L61	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How was your marriage during the first few years?	I know each couple is different. I currently live with my boyfriend who I have a son with. I just gave birth last month but the baby's with my parents in a place 12 hours from where we live. We stay here because of work. I just want to know how things were with your partner during the first few years. We've been living together for a year but things can be very bad sometimes because we fight a lot. Sometimes he even hits me although not above the shoulders.. Just the arms and legs.. Some of our friends say that it's still the adjustment period and they also went through the same thing. I just want to know what you think. Please share your opinions and advice. Thanks.

20090128093033AA9sYEv	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you like my story so far?	sorry this isnt really in the correct topic but i want as much feedback as possible!! im writing a teen/murder/mystery and i havent gotten to the good part yet bc i just started but can u please tell me what u think of the intro? thanks! && any advice on names/plot would be fantastic!!!    I put on an act. There, I said it. I, Bradley Louise Turner put on an act. Everyone thinks Im so wild and crazy but really Im just the opposite. Its not like Im fake or anything. I do say the truth and nothing but. Its justsometimes I wish I was different. The reason I act the way I do is because I want to be liked and I guess my act worked. I am liked but this isnt the real me. The real me doesnt like love-stories or staying out until three in the morning partying. The real me would rather stay inside and watch a horror movie with a close group of friends and then play truth or dare and go to bed. The real me doesnt like wearing designer jeans every day and having to go to the bathroom three times a day in school just to make sure my makeup looks flawless. The real me doesnt mind wearing sweatpants and baggy t-shirts. Of course I would never tell them. Whos them? Oh, just the Aphrodite girls. Yep, the Aphrodite girls. Thats what their group is called and I am part of them. Now even I am not even quite sure how I became apart of them. When I first arrived at Baycrest high I was a loner. I arrived just the way I really am. Baggy sweat pants, oversized t-shirts and all. My long chestnut brown hair was tied in a loose bun and I wore no makeup whatsoever. The first day of school was hell.
20090129113810AApYUEP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What is the rationale behind killing your children, spouse and yourself due to financial problems?	Now that i've got your attention..      Murder/suicides of people who have recently loss their jobs or suffered some other form of relative trauma seems to be happening more and more recently, and well above anything i've heard growing up.  Taking out your whole family and then yourself was just not an option for my family, nor anyone else I knew. We all struggled, some lost their jobs but they bit the bullet and made it the best way they could.      What the heck is going on now?

20090225115923AAVxQ60	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS! GIRLS! I need opinions?!?	So, I could go on and on about this guy...But I won't.Basically,I've known him a year,and I used to reaaaaaally like him,but now idk anymore.Anyways,I get the vibe now that he likes me now.   Sunday,I saw him at church,and he wouldn't really talk to me,but while he was talking to my brother he kept looking at me.So,they were talking bout engines and he was telling my brother how to do something,but he kept looking at me like he was telling me how to do it?Even though he was talking to my bro..and not me?   Then a group of ppl we know went ice skating Sunday afternoon,and I got my camera out to take some pics,and everyone else just kinda went by or smiled, but he was like, "Oh,ur taking pictures...Don't take a picture of me!" and yet tried to skate up to the wall where I was taking pics and he ended up crashing into it full force...LOL. I was like "Wow.That was graceful."   While I skated he would occasionally come up,but didn't like skate w/ me or anything. I was taking a video and he showed up, and I said to him, "Okay...now crash into the wall again for me. So I can put it on Youtube…" and....he actually did (you know, all dramatic,but still hit pretty hard).LOL. Like on purpose.   I don't know if you can kinda have a clue of if he likes me or not from those minute details, but what are your thoughts? We're both 17,btw.

I get so mad, seriously I probably cry my self to sleep atleast once a week. He acts so stupid when hes drunk. Our relationship is crap right now. I cant stand looking at him, or being in the same room as him. He knows that i do it. Do you think its bad of me? CAUSE I DONT.

20090225120226AApnBsa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me?  Yes?  No?  Maybe?	Sorry this is so long, and I've asked this before, but some lunatic kept typing every single word strangely so I didn't understand it.      There's an annoying kid at my friend's youth group, but he's cute.      When I saw him the first time, we went ice skating. He would always do this annoying thing with his skates to people, but he never did it to me. When I fell, he just kinda looked at me with a sad little pouty face, but I didn't need his help so I got up on my own.      Yesterday when I saw him, he kept looking at me. When I left to go to the bathroom, he asked ms where I was going for some reason. Obviously I wouldn't tell him "I'm gonna go pee" so I just said nothing. He talked to me a bit but still kinda did his own thing. When we moved around the room he would sit in the spots that I sat at and looked at me a lot. Just glanced. I saw his eye contact and looked away because I didn't want a staring contest.       He seems interested, but not in a way that most boys are...       I can't figure it out... does he like me, does he want to be friends, or is  he just weird?
20090129113901AAI1zcJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What is up with my ex? I don't get him.....?	When we split up I was going to help pay off the credit card debt and keep possession of the car and continue making the payments. He said that he just wanted the diamond ring back and to forget about the credit card, he would take care of it. I took the car and continued to make the payments and they were all paid a couple of weeks early. Despite that fact, he continued to harass me for money to the point that I just gave him the car back. (It's in his name) So time goes by and we have no reason to communicate, yet he still sends me messages about the credit card and the car payment. I only did what he asked me to do and gave him back everything, I have nothing from that relationship whatsoever.       I have since gotten married and I am very happy. Since my marriage, the communication from the ex has only increased and its still about the same things, the credit card and the car payment. He feels as if I should be paying for something and I disagree. He got the ring and the car. I got nothing. What do you think his problem is? I have repeatedly asked him to leave me alone.

20090225115027AAlE89W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Me and this new guy.?	i recently started speaking to this new lad online.   He goes to my college, and i've seen him around a couple of times so i decided to add him. We spoke on facebook for a while before moving onto msn, then he gave me his number. We have spoken lots, and since then i've even sat with him on my free's at college. Things seem to be going well.   He has hinted he likes me with things such as 'your pretty and amazing' and 'im only online still because i get to talk to you'.   and he smiles at me when walking around, and asks if im okay.   i even joked about once saying argh lads do my head in i might turn into a lesbian and he said    'ill punch myself in the crotch so i can look like a girl'   which showed he obviously liked me a bit.      He can be quite hot and cold sometimes.   Most times he will always say hey first on msn. and apologise if he's been moody/narky that night.      We both came out of long relationships so i know we would never rush anything :)   He also invited me round in April whilst his parents are away.      The thing is. He was going to poland this monday just gone (a college trip) and kept asking for a suprise before he went.   I ended up walking him to his coach and hugging him, and ended up kissing him - not a full on snog kiss, but like a kiss on the lips, just three times.   Its not like me to get butterflies - but i did it was really weird.      he wouldnt let go of my hand but eventually did and i said id see him when he gets back and he just smiled.   i never got the chance to talk to him about the kiss.      i havent spoken to him whilst hes been away   he hasnt text me or attemped to chat, but nor has he to his best mate.      im slightly paranoid he will go back to square one once back   and i dont want that i want things to get better      what do you think?      will it be a good/bad return?

20090129113021AAXSMZI	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What is the best thing to say to a person in this situation?	I was talking on the phone to my boyfriend when he said he had to call his mother really quickly to ask her something. We hung up and when he called back he was extremely sad/almost crying sounding. He said that when he called his mother she was crying. His aunt has cancer and she hasn't been doing well lately. Apparently when he called his mother, she told him that the aunt was not going to make it. What can I say to him later that will actually make a difference ...? I can't even really say I know what he's going through honestly because I have no family except for two parents and a brother..so really I have no experience with this type of thing but...I am very sad for him and want to be there for him with anything that I can say or do to make him feel better.  What can I say to him later ?

(im told i look like a lesbian vegetarian. lol). is this really necessary, because i love my piercings and style? does my weight look likes it's an issue? what should i do with my hair? im 20 and im tiered of being single all the time.         sorry, ignore all my art crap    http://s194.photobucket.com/albums/z201/...

The other day i was thinking how my ex girlfriends where not the prettiest ladies and not the most fit. And this girl i liked told me i could do much better than that. It got me thinking that why im not doing better with women?  Then when i talk to some of the girls who are beautiful and have things going for them, they just want to be friends, best friends, not girlfriends. Or if something happens it only happens once. Does anybody have advice on how i can change that? How can i have better looking girlfriends instead of best friends. Im not 18 people im 30 years old. So all the you have time, it sure doesn't feel like it. The only thing i have going for me is my friends think i look like im 22 and i always feel young. And where im at, as far as dating i cant find anybody my age to date, who takes care of themselves and their body. What do i do, where do i start?

20090128093921AAEwiLI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Older man has taken possession of me?	At New Year my parents had a big party and invited a lot of people over. I am 19, so had had a few drinks which made me feel sexy and flirty. I had noticed a friend of my fathers who is single and 45 checking me out, he is not very handsome so I thought I would give him a thrill and decided to tease him with my body by sitting on his lap and showing him little flashes of my body. I was enjoying the effect I was having on him when he suddenly turned the tables on me. He started whispering really filthy things in my ears and began touching my p*ssy, and to my shame he had very quickly fondled me to orgasm. Since that night I have been meeting him secretly for sex several times a week and I worry that I have become addicted to him. He is very rough and dominating with me but I find myself doing whatever he asks with pleasure. I don't understand what is happening to me or between us but I am totally in his thrall and the sex we share is all consuming for me. Outside the bedroom he is very sweet to me but still very much in control. I have only had one other sexual relationship prior to this one and would never have imagined I could act in this way.

20090128094245AAamU95	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need help with girlfriend?	I've been with my girlfriend since 5th grade. I am in my sophomore year in high school and have been dating her for 7 yrs already. I'm madly in love with her. Her parents already knows that I'm in love with her. She's also a sophomore. I want to make love with her but I'm afraid of the law seeing me as statutory rape. I think she want to make love with me too. My girlfriend is getting really depressed that I didn't make love with her. I want to show how special she is to me. I told her that if I was to have children, she'll be the one that I will have them with. I'm going to marry her in couple of years for sure.

20090128090155AAzTwJz	Family & Relationships;Family	Can a mother drain the father's expenses out of revenge?	My daughter was born when I was 14. I was cut off from the mother and my child by the time she was 2 months along for the simple reason that she "didn't love me anymore". I know now that this was complete bull... but I was young and naive. I worked for years to see my little girl. I sent gifts and money. I offered to baby sit and sent letters, emails, called, I did everything I could and pestered the crap out of her and her family to be with my daughter. Now that I am 18 I have filed for parental rights and a paternity test. The mother has never filed for child support, and didn't put me on the birth certificate. She is threatening me with "back child support" because all the things I sent are only seen as gifts, not support. I don't think that she can do that because I was a minor, I am not on the certificate, she has never filed, and there has never been a paternity test. She is only threatening this to get me to back off because I don't make a lot of money. I don't care if I have to pay a million dollars I WILL see my daughter and be the father she deserves. I just don't want to be put into poverty over it because I just can't pay all of that at once. Is it legal to order a minor to pay back child support? I was under the impression that child support didn't even start until the mother filed. What are the rules here? I can't seem to find information on minors paying support.

20090225131138AA0wR76	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's this FINE girl think, and how will she react when I ask her out?!?	RE-POST! I need more opinions so I can figure out what do to do! Also added some details!          I was in the gym today. There is this girl I was checking out. She was with a guy, I assume he is her boyfriend. Okay, I know she saw me checking her out. So a few minutes later they both come and start working out on the machine next to me. I gave her some eye contact and a quick smile. After that, when they were both looking at me, I lifted my shirt slowly and flashed my chiseled abs for her. She sort of just stared for a second until she came to. Then just looked away really fast. Her boyfriend was just standing there like "wtf..." I want both male and female perspectives. I'd prefer female perspective though. She'd also give me quick glances. You know, like i'd be walking and her eyes would follow me briefly. Also, what happens if I ask her out in front of her boyfriend? I've never tried that before, but how do you think it'll play out? How do you think this scenario will work out?

20090128093047AA9J4S6	Family & Relationships;Friends	I have a crush on my friend.  How do I stop it?	I've developed this horrible crush on a female friend of mine.  She knows I like girls and is totally okay with that.  But the thing is I don't think my crush would be this bad if I didn't think she might feel the same way.  We've been hanging out a lot lately and she's been spending the night at my house quite often...in my bed...despite the fact that she's kinda allergic to cats and I have 3 of them.  Maybe I'm reading too much into it.  She says she's straight, but I think she may be questioning that.     My crush seemed to get worse on New Years when she was completely intoxicated and asked if we should "just make out and get it over with."  I was completely surprised by that and exclaimed "what?!" and she quickly changed the subject.  I'm pretty sure she doesn't remember that though and I'm afraid she might have just said that because she was drunk.  But the truth is I really wanted to.  And I still do.  But I'm afraid of the consequences of her not feeling the same or it not working out.  I value our friendship and I don't want to lose it.  But I can't help thinking about what it would be like to kiss her.  How do I stop that?  I think I just want it to stop.  It'll hurt less if I just let it go and accept that we can only be friends.  Right?   I need help.  There's so much more to it, but I'm not sure I feel comfortable mentioning it here.  So I'm hoping this is sufficient enough to get some helpful answers.  Just help me end the crush while still keeping out friendship strong and intact. Is getting over this even possible?
20090225130401AADuWkQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My best guy friend likes me, and it's became ackward.?	There's this boy in my grade that happens to be my best guy friend. About a month ago, he started acting different, hinting that he liked me.      Now it's obvious and everyone is aware that he likes me.      Every day at school he makes an effort to compliment me and sit next to me. Everyone knows he likes me, and he always is around.      It's started to be that our conversations revolve around me, and it's awkward. I miss talking to him about everything we used to talk about. (music, pretty much everything)       I don't know how to act or how to respond to all of this.      Please Help!   Thanks

20090128092231AAZUw5q	Family & Relationships;Family	What the hell is my mother in laws problem. ?	Ok so me and my husband have been married for a month now, so were still newly weds :) When we got engaged, we flew down to ga so i could meet his mother. I was nervous. i had never meet or talked to the women in life, and now i was staying with her for a week.       6 months passed and me and my husband found out we were expecting a baby! We were so happy :)        So now im 6 months pregnant and trying to plan the baptism for our child, because alot of my husbands family lives out of town.    My husbands mother offered to help, we wanted to get the adresses soon and she said she would help right away. 2 weeks went by without a word from her. So we said that we would just do it ourselves.    Then she turns around and starts emailing nasty things to me and my husband, saying how i ruined their realshonship, im controlling, im insecrue(all because i wasnt the most outgoing at her house) and im imature. All these problem with me came up after six months?? All because we told her we would do the invites ourselves. SHe always pushed things off, and has never been close to him( she left him when he was a baby) and has only seen him a couple times since, after he lived there for a couple months).    Now she is calling me all these names, saying i dont make him happy, he doesnt need me, we have a bad realshonship( she has been married and divorced 2 times over, married a third). I just dont understand were all this anger came from!   She is also telling my husband he is whipped, excuse me but were married and not 14 anymore, he doesnt need his mother to push him around.   We decided not to talk to her till she apoalgizes(this isnt the first time we have a had a problem with her) and even after not to much,    I just dont understand where all this anger came from! Any suggestions?

20090225124347AAOYZKn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dating question: Am I wrong?	This guy I've been seeing for a few months texted me last nite at about 10:30 asking, "Are you sleeping?" I wasn't ,of course, and just ignored the text b/c I was tired and didn't want to talk.  He then called my home # 5 minutes later and I didn't answer. He waits about 20 minutes and then calls my cell.  I answer because I think maybe something's wrong because he keeps calling.  He says he was just calling to talk and see what I was doing. In my opinion, common sense would have told him that if I didn't answer the text AND the phone call that I must be sleeping!  I lied and said I was sleeping and wanted to get off the phone. He then proceeds to tell me that I'm lying and not really sleeping and that he hears the tv in the background.  I usually sleep with the tv on and I said that, but I felt like I should not have to even explain all that to him.  I then told him that to keep calling me was uneccessary if I don't answer the phone.  He just got upset and said "whatever" and hung up.  I don't feel like I did anything wrong and don't know why he got mad.
20090128092104AAVyeKH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can i trust my husband?	my husband and I have been arguing alot and I think the main reason is trust. We have been togather for 5 years and married for only 4 months, we have a son togather. When we got to gather we were still young and we partied and did alot of childish thing. For the first 2 years of our relatioship i was told he was cheating on me, I was told he was having conversations with ex's about stuff he shouldnt be talking about with them. He was beat up by one of he ex's boyfriends cause he was believd they were sleeping togather, I have had people call my cell phone and tell me that he was cheating on me with more then one person. This all went on for about 2 years then it finally stopped. He denied he was ever cheating on me and I sorta beleived him and sorta let it go but it has always been in the back of my mind. Every now in then he does something that makes me suspicious and untrusting, he has been talking to a girl online that is friends with one of his ex's. They mostly talk about kids so it doesn't bother me but he has talked about a fight we had and it really made me mad and now he deletes there chat history so I can't see. I think I am probably totaly overreacting but I can't seem to let things go, I have been cheated on in a previous relationship so I guess I am really cautous and can't let my guard down. But he also doesn't like it when I go out or get hit on radomly at work or when out with my friends, I can't help that I am pretty, I always say I am married, and I always tell him and he never lets it go. What should we do to fix the trust in out relatioship.

20090225121843AAKYxxb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I get so angry with the men I know flirt with me or bluntly hit on me?	I'm thirty with a middle school aged son whose father is deceased for the last decade.  I've had a few relationships, but have chosen to be single for the past year and a half.        Lately, I loose my temper and get depressed when someone expresses interest in doing anything sexual with me.  I've terminated a number of friendships, some many years old, over this.  I've said many things I regret.        A few guys have called me crazy, and it really hurts.  My friends and family seem to have the impression that I'm a very sexual person and that I like attention.  I don't feel that way.      I just don't want to feel used.  I don't know if I'm encouraging people without knowing it (I've been accused of that many times).  I want real friendships and normal work relations.        I feel like sex is the only thing most people are interested in and once someone flirts with me, I tend to flirt back a little-so they don't feel rejected and get mad at me, then I avoid them and go cold inside.  If they persist, I explain how I feel.  Usually, they continue to persist and I either loose my temper or get really depressed.  Then, I avoid all contact.  This is making me a lonely and frightened individual.  Many of these men are married or in relationships, too.        The idea of having a sexual relationship again really terrifies me and I absolutely don't want casual sex.  I remember a long time ago when I thought it was nice and enjoyed it, but any and all attention I get anymore seems malicious.  I don't understand what is wrong with me, but it's seriously affecting my life and I don't know how to cope.

20090225122445AAm2yie	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do I do when I have no one to talk to?	For the past few months I haven't had anything to do at all every week. I live about an hour away from almost all my friends, and the ones who live close are usually at work every day. So I have no one to talk to at all or anything to do. and since I'm home schooled, I have tons of free time on my hands. What can I do? I have no one to talk to, and I pretty much NEED someone to talk to because I've been going through a lot lately. What do I do? I'm starting to get really depressed  and I don't want that happening AGAIN.

20090128094529AAJKEFp	Family & Relationships;Family	I wanna move out but my parents are dead against this!!!?	So, I got a job offer in another city, well it's actually cooperative education for 8 months and it's great for my program of study because it's directly related, so anyways this might come as a shock to anyone reading but I'm 20. I know what many of you are gonna say now...You're a whuss or lame and yadiyada...but for those of you who didn't say that, please read on.   I come from a culture where girls live with their parents until they get married and then get a house of their own. Now in my case, I've been trying to convince my parents that it's not that bad and I will be responsible and I won't let them down BUT the location being 6 hours away...doesn't really help the cause. Anyways, how do you think I should explain myself (I mean how should I convince them because I'd hate to leave everything in a state of disagreement and fighting) so give me reasons, and please, no "wtf, you're 20!! you're so lame!" or anything like that.

20090128092844AA1zbcm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Get more custody/visitation because mother can barely afford daughter?	My daughter's mother and I have a set visitation schedule and child support agreement through the courts. However, I'm noticing that she and her new husband are barely able to get by financially.  They can't afford a car and they live in low income housing and they're welfare.  She tends to leave her kids in her parent's house due to this.   My question is would that be enough to ask for more visitation time and/or decision making rights? Anyone in the same situation? Thanks      P.S. Would it be possible to get more visitation/rights when she starts school as I would like to play a more integral role in her schooling and extra cirricular activities. thanks again

20090225130914AAWAX3j	Family & Relationships;Friends	What would you do? Please help :)?	Just wondered what you'd do in this position..       One of my really good friends has this boyfriend (who i'm also good friends with.) We all hang around together at college a lot and meet up and everything. Just recently things have started to change, he keeps talking to me everyday nearly and telling me he doesn't feel the same way (or hes not sure if he loves her anymore.) And he keeps dropping subtle hints to me that he likes me basically. The problem is.. i feel so guilty but i've always had a few feelings for him :S and its really awkward because obviously i wouldn't betray my friend. But everyday they are both telling me stuff about each other and i don't really know what to say :S. Should i tell her? But then i may loose friendships.. or just let the land lie for a while :\

20090225125519AAQtGHx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm afraid to ask this but....?	Here is an excerpt from my book. I'm 13. Be as harsh as you want to. Lille clutched at the wall with her sweaty, clammy hands, trying not to pass out. She didn't know where she was. "I must be hallucinating," she though. But she wasn't. This was real. Her mom was walking toward her, her arms open and tears streaming down her face. Except, except this wasn't the mom she remembered. Her mom had a warm demeanor like a crackling fire on a chilly day. This woman was cold and awful. She was whiter than a snowflake falling on the ground. Lille started shouting, except no words came out. She had gone deaf and mute at the same time. All she could hear was a familiar sound, so distant that it was barely recognizable. It would have been all for the better if this song was indistinguishable.

20090225131232AAgC7sT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm really torn on what to do i don't want to make things worse?	i went out with this guy i work next to once and the night went pretty smoothly i even got a few kisses. its obvious we have great chemistry. for the record i have known him for almost a year so we are pretty good friends. well that weekend i kind of jumped the gun. i didnt mean to i was nervous and when i get nervous nothing comes out right. i think i scared him when i said "what is the status of our relationship"  when i meant are we were still just friends or dating. he truthfully responded that these things take time. since then i have been a nervous wreck because i really like the guy and things obviously havent been the same since then between us and its been 3 weeks. we havent been talking as much and i have a witness who says she can tell things are awkward. in the last week though i think things have started getting better. he randomly took a picture of me then of other things, to be less obvious i think. i asked him if he wanted to hang out but he said he was busy with work then he had to do something else but to get back at him later about it. i'm worried that hes not interested anymore but my friend says that he still does we just have to start from the beginning.      i have been wanting to ask him if i scared him off, you know just to talk about it but i'm afraid it will make things worse. i'm really torn i want to know.
20090225121615AAwNKGz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do about my girlfriend's anxiety?	Ok here's the situation, this may get lengthy.    Me and this girl have been going out for 2 months, we're really enamored with one another. She has been diagnosed with PTSD and GAD and takes meds for it. She has also tried to quit smoking upon my request b/c I can't stand the stuff, and she also has wanted to quit for years as well so she's said I am a good reason for her to. We have had to address the smoking issue numerous times when I she slipped up. I was supportive and encouraging, told her I wouldn't leave her b/c it was hard for her to quit, and i never yelled or shouted in ANY of the situations.    Recently I was changing out the air freshener in her car and found a pack of smokes halfway gone; not 10 minutes prior to this she was singing her praises for how well she was doing. I confronted her about it and she initially lied about it, then owned up to it and said she didn't want to disappoint me.    Now i'm frustrated with the sneaking around, and the lying; so i cut the filters off. I used a regular kitchen cutting board and a chopping knife which was about 4.5 inches long. She flips out! I understand and admitted later on that what I did was immature. But she isn't mad, her anxiety has taken over and she is now convinced I am this terrible monster who's going to start hitting her when i get upset. We decided to take a break. We talked on the phone last week and she's still scared. I've been understanding, humbled myself, admitted my wrongs, but it seems none of this is getting through to her. She's been in abusive relationships before and i know this is probably contributing to her fears, but i have absolutely no idea what to do at this point. I feel completely helpless. What do you do when you are the source of your partner's anxiety?

20090225130152AAig3Ky	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I feel bad?  Adults only please?	My best friend...who I also sleep with (I add that cause I think if he was my man I may do more for him), has a court date coming up for a major offense. I know he is innocent but of course he still has to go thru the motions as would anybody else. I work for a police department so  I know how the police saw the situation and I know how he saw it. In the end he was wrong. Well it seems like everytime he gets in trouble he calls me. I don't know if he thinks I can get him out of the situation or if he wants me to bail him out. I'm not going to do either.       Okay if he were to get locked up in the joint where I work, I would pull strings for him but not for other jurisdictions. I think it looks bad if I work for the police and I'm calling another municipality to help you get out when I dont know what you did to get in there. The most I will do is get his bond info/court date etc. and thats without giving my title and relay it to his sister and parents.      We are grown so I'm being honest. He is a really great guy but he smokes weed which I dont condone. I think after a certain age that should get old. Especially when you are trying to better yourself and you have this major case coming up! He's gotten his degree, his own place, he's a good father to his son, but keeps getting into dumb stuffand its like "dude all this stupid stuff is for the birds wake up" I dont know how to tell him. I felt really bad that I didnt take his collect calls but I'm like what am I supposed to do? Part of me was like well we sleep together but that doesnt mean I'm supposed to fix what you should have together in the first place.  How do I go about asking what the hell is wrong with him without being condescending.       Wanting my grown friend to stop acting like a young idiot.

20090225122055AA8uzks	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How will I know that I am over my first love?	It has been four years since my first love and I have been together. It took me almost 2 years to get out of the state that I was in when I was still in love with him. He went off to college. The following year I went off to college. I met other guys and it took my mind off of him for a while. He and I never really had closure.  I have not seen him in about two years. In the summer he left a voice mail on my cell about a birthday card I sent him over a year before that time and was thanking me for that. Why was that necessary? I didn't want to call back because hearing his voice will be nothing but destruction for my life so I decided to text back instead. Well, this past October I started talking to a guy at school. I ended up getting my mind off of him once again. Over the Christmas break I was at work at Aeropostale. I was working the cash register. He walked in my store and I almost fell out. I started to hallucinate and was dropping money and shaking badly. He was talking to a friend and shopping for his girlfriend until he looked up and caught me staring with my mouth open wide. Its like he lost his train of thought until his friend snapped him out of it. While dropping money and picking it up, I looked back up and he was long gone. My manager made me go to the back and the only thing I could do is cry. Why after all this time? A few days later my twin said she saw him and he said hi and said he saw me at work but I acted like I could not speak. How will I know I am over him? I been thinking about him TOO much lately. Our connection was soooo deep back then. He used to call at 4 in the morning and could not sleep because he was thinking about me. I wonder if he ever thinks about me now. But I always rush the feelings out of my head. But now it is time to face reality and admit that I still have feelings for him. I do not know what to do!

20090225115904AAhUzfX	Family & Relationships;Friends	One of my best friends started being nasty behind my back and I don't know why?	One of my best friends from school started b itching about me behind my back a few months ago. Initially saying things that I was selfish for going to a place I wanted to go on my birthday. I forgave him but it recently transpired that he never actually stopped saying stuff about me. He even insulted my mother who has always thought he was a nice person. He has completely latched onto the rest of my friends and came out to a birthday party last week and ignored me. It angers and upsets me as we have been friends for years and have done a lot for each other, as friends do. I don't want to be friends with him anymore but I do want to know why he started saying such nasty things about me but don't know how to go about it. I don't want to start sending b itchy texts but when I asked him civilly what was going on he didn't reply.   Any suggestions welcome.
20090225130632AAAcWUv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I tell him that I have feeling s for him?	I'm a junior in high school and there is this guy I like and well I want to tell him how I feel but I'm not sure how to do it. We are friends and I don't want to make it uncomfortable. I really care for him and we talk like everyday on the computer and/or at school. So I guess I have two questions one being how can I tell if he likes me back? and two how do I tell him how I feel?

20090225122443AApsFCa	Family & Relationships;Family	I HATE my dad!! I need advice please!!?	I am a preteen and today when I got home from school my dad was on the phone. We have a dog and last night he was biting me soo i said NO BITE to my dog. My dad said he didnt want me to yell at the dog anymore and also he told me I have to be ready for bed at eight. He isnt even home at night because he has to work nights. That really got me upset. He told me im keeping mom up because Im on the computer. But her doesnt even know because he isnt even home and the reason my mom is up is because the dog wont go to sleep. He is a puppy so he sleeps in his pen. I dont know what to do. I called my mom and told her everything im telling you. So she tells my dad and of course calls me telling my he is sorry, love me and verything, but im still very upset. I dont really feel coftorble around me, but i dont know why I shouldnt feel comterble, he has never abused me in any way. Im just upset and need advice. My house has a spirit in it and so the pastor comes over everyweek to help get rid of it. So im very stressed out. I got scratched, pushed down the stairs,harrased... I need help!!      please!!!!
20090225123046AAzU9oY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I tell him I like him?	There's this guy and I like him, but I'm not sure if I should tell him. He's liked me on and off for a very long time, and I never really had any interest in him. Now I like him and I'm fairly sure he likes me too, but I'm not sure if I should tell him because I don't really want a relationship?
20090225111840AAp5gSM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I know he's cheating what do I do?	After he worked 6 days straight and was home on those nights mostly because he was tired on his first off day, he dipped out.  And my gut, my gut strongly told me he was going to see another woman.  So I called his phone a few times and he didn't answer.  He went to call me back but I missed the call and when I called him back a few more times he still didn't answer and didn't call me back until hours later.        He claims he spends all this time with his friends but I know there's another woman.  I just can't prove it.  I can tell he's emotionally off balance right now.  He says I don't treat him right because I don't give him his space, I act crazy, possessive and nag him.  He smokes a lot of cigarettes, and he's been drinking alot.  He has also been experiencing some erectile disfunction and I can tell he's mentally and emotionally all over the place.  He's not happy with me.  He's mad all the time, he says I'm not loving him right because I'm not allowing him to be a man.  He has friends I've never met, he doesn't take me anywhere and he acts paranoid.  He gets phone calls and text messages that he doesn't answer around me and I know it's probably another woman but I don't want to snoop through his stuff.  I can tell that either he's pulling away or I'm pushing him away and it's making me more nervous, more insecure because I know, I just know in my heart of hearts that someday he'll be gone.  After all we've been through and all this time we've spent together.      So what do I do.  I know he's cheating and I'm emotionally all over the place to the point where I can't control myself anymore.

Well I have been dating my boyfriend for 3 years and 4 months and he still won't say (I love you) back to me.

20090225125613AAAqTFf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she just busy this week?	Ive known this girl over a year... we've been dating for 2 months and things were going great. We had a nice V-day weekend together, but ever since then we haven't communicated as much and it just feels like she's distant. Despite this, around the middle of last week I asked her if she was doing okay with regards to me. She said she liked the way things are going and she's doing good, and shes just busy but stuff just feels differently.       She texted me monday and said she wants to hang out this week. We're going to hang out Friday, but I'm afraid she's going to break things off with me or something. I dont want to ask her or bug her about it because I don't want to seem too needy. Does it seem like she might want to get together to tell me she's lost interest in me? How would someone lose interest when nothings happened really since the last time I saw her? Does it seem like she's lost interest or is she probably just busy?      For more info... just a week or two ago she said she really likes how things are going, that she's lucky i never gave up on her a long time ago, and that she thinks i have the best sense of humor ever and that she finds that really attractive.

20090225124423AAt5iT7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you answer his calls?	I'm not trying to play games, but my BF told me a big lie. He booked a trip which includes females to mexico without telling me. I told him to have fun in mexico, and hung up on monday. He also refuse to tell me who are the guys going. So this is rediculous and I really don't have a relationship. We seem like almost the perfect couple b/c he do much wonderful things with/for me. Sayed he wanted one more boytrip, found out it included the female friends he use to go on trips with. Now he keeps calling and texting. At this point I don't even want to talk to him but I want him to understand this is crap and I will not tolerate it and he needs to talk. How can I effectively but silently relay this message. He just text and ask please let me know if you alive.
20090225123212AA7qIxA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Advice on how to break up with someone?	So...I've been casually dating this guy for a few months now and I'm really now feeling it.  I've given it a chance but I've decided that it's not working.  I usually am the one who gets dumped, so I've never had to do this before.      Also, quick side note.  He asked me to a formal dinner at the end of March a few weeks ago and I said yes..however, I don't want to wait it out with him just for that.  Should I offer to still go with him?      What is the best way to go about this?  Where? When? How?  I'm clueless!

20090225130233AAlugrH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	You don't have to read the whole thing, just skim. Cause idk what to do?	My boyfriend, he is very protective of me. He gets jealous very easily. When I speak to another boy he asks what we were talking about.       My boyfriend is very good looking; with an even better body. Now as I said before he gets very jealous.       F/e: He got upset of how a guy was all over me and didn't want me to say the guys name. Kidding around, I said the name three times over. He than said, because I am very insecure about myself and he insists I am hot, that maybe he should go back to his old gf. He started saying how hot she was and other stuff about her and him. I got upset, and he than tried to make it right by saying it was just a joke.      We tell each other everything. Although we've only been together about 3 weeks. We know everything about each other. Now, yesterday I called another guy hot and many people heard me. What if they tell him? They would do that. Should I tell him before they do? Because I called many other people hot yesterday.       I'm just afraid he'll take it the wrong way. What should I do?         *He's Hispanic, and you know how they get/are with their women.      *I'm Hispanic too.      *He keeps thinking I'm going to leave him for this other boy.

20090225121842AAgrKfv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are there any intelligent people that can answer this without a stupid comment?	I'm in college and b/f class today, the teacher was late so we had to wait outside the door. One guy in my class kept looking at me as we waited, or so I think, it seemed like he looked away quickly a split second b/f i could catch him. In class I sat by him (which he seemed suprised when I did) and he asked to see my sheet since he forgot his and scooted his desk closer to mine. He joked about some stuff I had written on my paper. He never talked to me b/f, so am I just reading too much into this? oh and later i saw him when having lunch with friends and he just stares witha shocked look on his face and when i smile (slightly, i'm shy) he just looks away and then seems upset!

20090225122502AAjM7ki	Family & Relationships;Family	Why is my little sister like this?	i have this 10 year old sister. she's fine when talking to her friends, but whenever she is at home she's in a bad mood. take just and hour ago for instance. i was in the kitchen looking for something to eat, and she gets home and starts looking for something too. she cant find anything so she goes "UGH! Theres nothing to eat in this house!!!" then she finds some cereal. well she gets a bowl and puts it next to the cabinet. i go over to the cabinet next to where she is standing, and she moves maybe a centimeter so i can get in. then she just stands there. i go, "what?" and she says in a snotty voice "your in my way and i cant pour my cereal so im just gonna wait until you move." im in a pretty good mood so i say poitely "well why dont you just move your bowl over a little bit? im really not even in your way at all." so she says "The sun is too bright and it hurts my eyes!!!" (mind you theres like 5 different counters in the kitchen, she's just lazy.) so then i start to get mad. (im 14). i say, just move your bowl, and i move it less than 10 inches away from me. she goes. "your so mean your such a *****!" i ignore her and go to the fridge. she comes next to me to get a spoon and then says "CAN YOU GET OUT OF MY WAY!?" at this point im so mad that i slam the fridge door and start walking upstairs. she says "Oh my god jazzmyn why are you being such a *****!?" then we start screaming and she runs upstairs.       Stuff like this happens EVERY SINGLE DAY. she doesn't have her period yet, and she's fine when she's with friends. she talks back to our parents, calls me the worst sister ever, cries when she doesnt get her way, cries when people are "Mean to her", she's SUPER lazy, and she hates taking showers. Every day she gets hom from school and starts yelling, calling me a ***** and saying she wishes i was never born, that im the worst sister in the whole world, she hates me, etc. Why is she like this?

I actually doubt there even is a bright side to be looking for.    One of my friends, Someone I thought I could really trust, told other people my biggest secret. It's not like she told them I fancy some boy she told them a secret about my sexuality. But then she said she didn't and I'm not sure she did. We had a long talk and either way I just can't trust any of my friends anymore. Especially the one I love sooo much. She doesn't actually know I love her though. At least I do not think she knows. I want to tell her and be with her but I doubt she will like me back. I have liked a teacher at my school for one year exactly now but he just about knows I exist. I am not smart AT ALL. I thought I was but it is obvious that I am not. I am not pretty either. I am quite ugly actually. I keep hearing voices in my head and seeing things/people that are not actually there. My weak bones are preventing me from doing everything. I just want to die. I just want to sleep for ever. I just want to slit my wrists and my throat pop a few pills and go to sleep. I;m so tired. I think my mum and dad are gonna break up and im gonna have to go live in some tiny flat with my mum and her new boyfriend and his three 6 year olds or whatever, I do not see my dad much anyway. Like twice a week, And he does live with us. I'm so lonely. My brother is engaged and trying for a baby. My sister has a baby. No one even wants to look at me. No boys or girls out there like me, so that's everyone in the world.. basically, I'm better off dead. I can't speak German.
20090129115606AAy9aLX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, would you tell us what does?	this morning i saw a friend of mine, and tho i don't know what he said to her to piss her off, she slapped him. she got him by planting her left hand on top of her hip and staring for a second, then slapping him good with her right hand. he couldn't avoid it. i don't think he could anyway. anyway, the reason i'm asking is cuz this exact smae slap move by girls was used on me too! she did the exact same thing to me, standing with her hip propped out, left hand on it, then *slap*< nailed me too. she gave me a look after doing it like she knew very well that would get me. i dunno how she knew, but i DO KNOW that i don't have a flipping idea how to block that move! It's too confusing, when a girl stands like that, it throws us off, so it's like we can't do anything. i've never hit a girl, and i won't. but tell me HOW do we block that move? just in case. cuz it damn sure works!

20090128090652AAqVGDr	Family & Relationships;Family	When your to-be sister in law has the same...?	exact songs playing on her ipod stereo that you did just 20 mins before?      i visit my to-be sister in law who is just 20 mins away, I notice she is playing the same song I just played before leaving my house. this happened 5 times in a row. these are songs that most people DO NOT listen to. aka not main stream and i find it odd because she doesnt like talking about music and her favorite band is a mainstream band, coldplay... so how is this possible? shes a preppy blonde 20 year old the type who doesnt even know anything other than mainstream...how is this possible??

It's everyday, every week of every year since I was about 6. First, let me explain WHY...      My parents, are getting a divorce. Actually, they're at the courthouse as I'm writing this. My mom just left, and we had an argument before she even left about how I picked up the phone when my dad calls. She absolutely hates his guts, but she told me she still loves him last night. (Sigh) She never stops complaining: And I really mean never. About 6 hours of my 13 hour day she complains. Sometimes I get tired of hearing it, so I try to say "I have to go" or something. She gets mad at me and says I'm taking sides with my dad against her...just because I get sick of hearing it so much.      Anyway, now she refuses to drive me over to an audition tonight at 5:00. And if I don't go, well, there goes my whole @$%^ing career.       I know it's getting personal now, but I really can't handle this anymore. The divorce, the constant complaining about my own dad whom I love, she even hits me and slaps me, leaving bruises and cuts. I think about suicide every 10 minutes. I even attempted it once, then I realized theres so much to live for...but when I'm REALLY upset, I don't think about that.       Is there anyone out there that can help me with this? I don't know, I'm really scared next time I try to commit suicide, I'll actually do it. What can I say to her?! What can I do?! I need help!!!!!!

20090128094901AAbYgSX	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think people divorce too easy?	I will be the first to say that my marriage hasn’t been perfect. But I also don’t expect it to be perfect. My husband and I have had more than a few obstacles since our relationship and many people probably would have walked the other way. But we decided to stick it out because we knew we have something special. Something we’d both probably regret walking away from a few years down the road.       My husband is currently in a BAD place. I’m doing my very best to be supportive and help him get through this. And we are both just taking this one day at a time.       Now I’ve had a few of my friends, who aren’t married, who do not have children, tell me that they would have left a long time ago. And I just have to ask, why get married if you plan on walking away when things get tough? When you get married, you take a vow. Through good times and bad, In sickness and in health, for richer and for poorer. If I walked away every time things got bad, well, why bother?       Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying sit here in pure hell if you’re TRULY that miserable and see no other way to make amends. But I also don’t think you should be so quick to walk the other way.       Do you think people divorce too easy? What is your opinion on this?
20090128111646AAxgrJk	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Just so confused as to what to do next.?	My wife and I have been married for almost 14 years. We have two children, a 10-year-old and a 3-year-old. Over the past several months, it just seems that we've grown further and further apart.      We were having a discussion today and she tells me that, as a woman, she needs more communication from me to feel secure in our relationship. I thought I had been doing better at communicating but obviously I was wrong.      I tell her that I don't feel love like we used to have because we never seem to have any time where it's just us. We have no love life, to speak of and we're always on the go.      Then, the moment that struck me like a brick between the eyes came. She said she feels no intimate feelings for me. She says that having sex with me would make her feel no different than having sex with a male friend. I didn't know what to say.      I guess I just don't understand females very well, because I feel like I can never do enough to meet her standards of feelings and intimacy. I really don't know where to go or what to do. Anyone that has any advice...I'm listening.
20090128113454AAHCfIn	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I get through this?	I'm in my last year at my school before I leave but the thing is, I have a truly awful class.    I don't get these girls, there's two of them and they are so bad it's ridiculous. They spoil our lessons everyday by screaming and shouting at the teacher for no reason, and slamming their fists on the table, or answering back. The other day they called the teacher fat and made her cry by being rude about her father who has just passed away.   The rest of us can't get on with our work because they scream and stuff in the lessons. They don't get detention because it does not difference. The school won't suspend them either because they are actually paid to go to school so that the school doesn't look bad.   This is probably why they think they can do what they like.      I'm in my GCSE second year and I am behind enough in this lesson as it is. What can I possibly do?

" OK babe , wait until I get home then we can talk" ...seeing that I wasn't getting out of the car they each decided too make their move..from all directions they rushed my vehicle .........."Sir , sir ....have you seen the new 09'  blah De blah ?!!" screeches the sales man at my door..I immediately reached over and locked the door as another started pounding on the passenger side window...."Sir , you can't get  better mileage than this"  he bellowed  as he desperately pointed to a car off in the distance.       "what's going on " ? ask the wife as she could sense the fear in my voice and heard the commotion in the back ground " honey !...... I gotta go !! " I stammered .      "are you being robbed ?   what............" I hung up as the biggest one ( and probably the office retard....based on the amount of balloons tangled around his neck) jumped on the hood  while trying to unravel a brochure of the newest hot rod , in my rear view mirror I saw the entire service department running my way pushing jacks and rolling new tires ...one yelling out their 20 point inspection plan .      In a panic I started my car.............*SLOW RIDE.............TAKE IT EASY .. blared from my speakers......they all stopped and for a moment they looked at one another confused  ..... It was at this point I should have floored it , but instead I watched as they started bumping and grinding around my car  while stripping off their clothing .........* I'M IN THE MOOD, WE CAN ROLL ALL NIGHT *      I desperately search my wallet for 1's and 5's  any thing to hold them at bay........nothing !   *HOLD ME, ROLL ME , SLOW RIDEN' WOMAN ' YOUR SO FINE* I was trapped with no way out ..no way too escape with my life.............so  I ended up buying the hot rod.( from the office retard of coarse.....:)       As I head home ( looking totally cool by the way )  I have to ask .....how am  going to explain this to my wife.....      * SLOW RIDE, TAKE IT EASY - SLOW RIDE, TAKE IT EASY..................WOO ! *      *
20090128115647AAnyd73	Family & Relationships;Friends	A friend of mine is jealous...?	...that even though I am older than she, all the men go for me and not her, as everyone knows full well that a mature woman has 'come into sync' with her body, and is much more enjoyable in bed than a younger woman is.      I tell her to be patient, that what afflicts me now shall also afflict her some day...this curse of being sought after for being so marvelous for my age, regardless of the slight 'imperfections', such as stretch marks.      Any other suggestions?      Poll: Older or younger?
20090128113603AA4WW7s	Family & Relationships;Friends	I grew out of a good friendship?	This girl and I used to be really good friends. We did a lot of things together, and I was able to tell her anything, until two and a half years ago. We weren't in the same classes, and she got so much more prettier and popular. Now she's one of the most prettiest and popular girls in school. But the thing is, she's still nice. Not one of those bratty popular girls. I miss being friends with her, but I'm very shy and it's really awkward around her. There's nothing to talk about. How can I become friends with her again if possible?

20090128121552AADPH2T	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Bad boyfriend? MATURE ANSWERS! I REALLY NEED SOME HELP WITH THIS!?	-i know i posted this a while ago but my computer wouldnt let me read the replies-      I was in a 4 year relationship with my ex boyfriend until he got arrested 5 years ago. Im 25 & he is 27. He was my first love & when he got locked up i couldn't stop crying. He in a dangerous gang, We have some mutual friends(not the gang ones) and whenever some of my friends go for a night out and he's there with friends i try keep my distance from him but i keep getting the feelings i had for him come back to me. When i leave he follows me out to talk. although i still love him i think i did the right thing. Anyway whenever im dancing he never takes his eyes off me,He gets into my face a lot if i dance with other guys, he grabs my arm if i walk away, he has never once hit me though. My friends are under the impression he knows he screwed up badly and he doesn't want anyone else to have me, that he is obsessed with me and that can be a major problem when i am dancing or with other guys would that be true?. He keeps telling me he wants me back and will never let me go again. If im at a bar or something he will sometimes come over a put his arms around me & try kiss me or whisper in my ear, but i walk away then he will try to make me look him in the eyes and tell him i dont love him, which i cant do.He even now has my name tattooed on the side of his neck. I think im attracted to these kind of men because my father is in jail & he is one of the head men in a Latino Blood Gang. Im starting counseling soon so maybe that will help?!   Please give me some advice if you can, thank you so much      -i know a lot of you are going to attack me but all im looking for is some advice-

20090128114449AAaWSQa	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why are some women so manipulative...?	Why are some girls so manipulative, conniving, and overall heifers? Well, my friend boyfriend has this friend that says things to him that is very inappropriate such as he was about to graduate from college and she told him that, “I want you to break up with your girlfriend and get with me.” I couldn't believe this when I heard it because he has been with my friend for years. This girl knows this and she still plays these games with him. I don't get why he want stop being friends with her. The girl also did other things such as saying "I have been thinking about you" and "I want to do you." My friend and her boyfriend have gotten into countless arguments and told her boyfriend if one more incident with this girl goes down again that their relationship is over. My friend and her boyfriend do have a great relationship that much is obvious, but this girl has got to go. I do believe this friend only wants my friend’s boyfriend because she never had an opportunity with him. When they were in high school he was with someone else and he was with my friend in college and still is now. Lately, the girl has been cooling down and staying way. My friend did do something do the girl online and want get into that, but I do believe that it helped because this girl got to see that my friend is not going anywhere. What would you do?

He switchs his mobile phone off whenever he steps to the house and the reason is unknown to be but my sixth sense tells me that he might be with that woman and he is having me on the sideline (that is just my gut feeling and nothing sure).

20090128121717AAVI4N9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Curious feelings towards an older man...?	I am a 30 year old woman and about a year ago I moved to London from Scotland to study art.    I met a lot of new people and have had a wonderful time in the city.   One of the most interesting people I have met is a man who is 16 years older than me. He is very much an independent thinker who is very intelligent and well read. I fine him a joy to be with and he seems to very much enjoy my company also.   Some of his friends are very surprised by how well we get on as previously he has had very little time for women and some have asked me what is going on between us.   I tell them the truth, nothing but although that is true it's also not quite the whole truth. The thing is is that something deep within me just responds to him and recognizes him in a way that I've never experienced before. I am quite a different person around him. I have always been shy and fairly reserved and never a touchy person but with him I am so open and affectionate and feel very at ease showing that affection physically. He has responded to this in kind and is very affectionate towards me.   I really don't know what it is just a sort of connection. If I believe in this sort of thing I would say that I had been his mother in a former life. Thats kind of the feeling I get which is strange as he is so much older.   I think I love him and I feel he is keen to make love to me and be my partner.      Do you think I should take a risk and see what happens?

Me and my daughter are struggling with the immense snow fall this year.  My one arm literally won't even bend at the moment from all the snow shoveling.  We live in Northern Ontario and the snow banks are over my head.    I think my ex husband should still have to come back and take care of this job.    Fine and dandy I get child support.  But their are so many household jobs that I have to carry his weight now.     Because he chooses to go off to a new better life or whatever.    I AM SICK OF THE SNOW!

20090128114824AAOnjBu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it weird that I don't want.....?	a close relationship with my stepdaughter? It's a really bad situation between us(my husband and I) and her mom. We don't get along, and haven't for the last nine years. I've been in her life since she was three months old, and this is affecting my relationship with my husband. He gets angry when I don't do things for her, or if someone ask me about my kids, I always just tell them about our two kids.  Her mother has constantly put me down, harrassed me, and even threatened me physically. Not only her, but her whole family. It's always drama when she calls, and it's upsetting to my kids to see their dad angry.  So I just deal with it by removing myself completely from the situation. I know it sounds bad on my part, but it's just how I feel.  My husband has never really defended me when his ex is on her rants, so I think this is best. He says that I should want a relationship with her. I don't want anyone to misinterpret me, I would NEVER mistreat her, I just don't try to bond with her. Example, my husband had to work a few weeks ago and it was his weekend visitation. I ask him to find a babysitter for her, and someone to transport her to her ballgame. I simply didn't want to. Am I a horrible person? When the child was younger, I tried, and her mother always interfered. So now, I just don't even try.

20090128121232AADPvZS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Female co-worker...what do I do?	Ok, so there's this woman at work who is quite a looker.  And she has one of those perfect bodies, thick curves in the right places and thin everywhere else.  Well, she dresses in a way that leaves nothing up to the imagination, though I do plenty of imagining anyway.  She wears tops that she's spilling out of.  And she's always giving me that up from under look and paralyzing smile.  And she's always saying flirting remarks like, "It's too bad you have a girlfriend."      It's torture.  It's brutal.  Here's the rub.  I don't think she really likes me in that way.  I'm not sure, but I'm think she's just doing it as a power trip, and taking pleasure in knowing her effect.      My question is "how do I deal with this".  I can't even concentrate for like a half hour after she comes around.  And I don't want to do anything, because I don't want to cheat on my girlfriend.  I just don't know what to do.  She's merciless.

20090128121458AA3qX7a	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Women: How would you handle this situation with your hubby?	This happened to me a few months ago and I am still not over it. I will try to make this as short as possible. My hubby's ex-girlfriend (who I absolutely loathe) will not go away. I do not like her because at one point in our relationship she came between us. Things ended between me and hubby for awhile (this is before we got married), and he decided that he still loved me, pursued me, and eventually down the road we got back together. I told him that in order for me to trust him he cannot talk to his ex. I don't him exactly how I felt about her, why I felt that way, and how I didn't trust him around her and I definately don't trust her intentions of being a "friend"... So to my knowledge he stopped talking to her because he wanted to prove his love and loyalty to me. Fast forward to a year or so later... She starts to email him again (I check his email every so often, and I could care less if people get upset about me snooping that is not part of the issue). I read them and they were not so bad but I was still upset. I just don't get why this chick would not get the f*** out of our lives and go away. I never did say anything, mostly because I didn't want him to know that I read his email. Eventually we got engaged. This is when the text messages started.   ***side note: I have my husbands old cell phone and phone number because he uses his work phone. He has had this cell phone number for years, and it is also the number that this girl would know   Anyways, I started to get text messages from her with stupid things like "oh I miss you" and "I want you to know that I'm not angry with you and I'm so happy for you and your engagement". I eventually texted her back telling her to leave us alone. This brought upon suspicions again so I started to check his email. I noticed that he signed up for the facebook, which he never told me about but he knows that I had an account in college that I rarely use anymore. He made a fake screenname using a fake name. I got onto my account and looked him up by email and clicked on his friends. The only friend that he had on his account was the ex.      So my question is, ladies, how would you react? I will update my question after I receive a few answers.

I also have a part time job and always keep up with my work and school. I have a boyfriend who I am crazy about and he takes very good care of me and makes me happy etc.       My parents are being overly strict. I don't understand why they act so ridiculous.

20090128120203AAVQrYS	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I wouldn't even call this a story, but it's about love and it's short...please read and enjoy:):)?	She always dreamt of a handsome, presentable, respectable, sweet, loyal and amiable man to come, perfect as a prince charming, to whisk her away to the life of no troubles. He had to be perfect, in order for her to fall in love with him...perfect. And then, a transition, a change happened in her deepest thoughts and she ended up falling in love with a man, who was flawed even more than a regular human; she never realized how...   Her whole life she hated men like him, egoistic, selfish, cynical, proud and rude. But he had a certain edge to him, a certain craziness that attracted her; something she’d never experienced before. Though rebellious, he was outstandingly intelligent, and goal-oriented. Most important of all though, he was mysterious, with a sarcastic smile frozen on his face as if to hide his real feelings, his real self.   Real feelings...ah, yes! That’s what intrigued her the most. With her wild imagination, she always knew what his real thoughts were. She always believed that his heart was good, that his soul was pure, as that of a child’s...yet he had to mask it all because of his fear of life and his fear of love. At least that’s what she thought, until he did...fall in love.    He fell in love reasonably, though not with her; reasonably meaning, with a girl that was of good looks, fortune and intelligence and. However, she played him like a fool, took his heart and butchered it...it was the first time anyone ever saw him cry. He never realized the one who really loved him, was right in front of him; the girl who was ready to take his flaws and make them her epitome of perfection; the girl for whom he meant the world. He pushed her away, thus making himself even more perfect than before...staying mysterious, unattainable and wild.

20090128115156AAURN8j	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Has anyone been on the show Say Yes to the Dress?	Say Yes to the dress is a show on TLC that documents a bride's search for he r wedding dress at Kleinfeld's in Manhattan. I got a call for casting and then was told that I would have to pay for my own airfare, hotel, food, and then I wouldn't even get a discount on the dress! I just think this is ridiculous. Why would I pay to put myself on TV? I just want to know if anyone else did this.
20090128115155AACaFQ9	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Help me decide on a wedding dress!?	I am having a Chinese wedding and have to have my dress custom made in China. I have narrowed down to 3 dresses but can't decide. I am in very close contact back and forth with the dressmaker, so please I don't need advising against getting my dress made in China, just help deciding. The following sample pictures are on 4 ft dolls and come with all accessories. My bridesmaids will be wearing red.       http://www.hexmediadesign.com/dress1.jpg    Dress 1: Is white, so it would have a western element to it, but I feel the ornate decoration would get lost because it is all one color. I like it a lot though.       http://www.hexmediadesign.com/dress2.jpg    Dress 2: All my bridesmaids like the best and say it would look best with my skin color, but I am not sure about the orange, as it is not a traditional wedding color and the beading is a bit excessive. ( I could probably ask them not to put the hanging beads on)       http://www.hexmediadesign.com/dress3.jpg    Dress 3: I like the head dressing the best in this set and I feel this one would make the most impression. I love the colors, but there may be too much black in it for a wedding.      I would love your opinions - I love them all so it's hard to decide!
20090128115851AAPdaYf	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How to handle a renewal of vows (4 year marriage)?	Our Background:  Got married before he left for the military. meanwhile, I went to school full time so I could support us if I needed to when he got out. We were states, and countries apart for the full 4 years, except for my summer and winter/holiday breaks. We knew we would get married eventually, but had a civil ceremony at the courthouse when we were 18 so we could take advantage of the military benefits.    Well, it's finally been 4 years! We live together. I have my Bachelor degree, He's served his full 4 years, and is now in the Reserves, with a promising position on the horizon.     So...I want my ceremony that every girl dreams of. How do I handle this? Do I handle it the same as a normal marriage ceremony? Would it be tacky to have a registry even though we've been married for 4 years? Do I wear a white dress? Obviously the vows may be different...What should the invites say?  We were married on March 15th '05, well I wanted to have the ceremony on March 15th, 2010 (our 5th anniv), but that falls on a monday...would it be odd to have it on the Sunday beforehand?    Just trying to plan ahead...  Thanks!

20090128095745AAIzg7s	Family & Relationships;Weddings	She thinks I want to marry her for sex?	I am a virgin and I have met the woman of my dreams. We met online and developed a long distance relationship. However, when we met, she had recently got out of an engagement where her partner was physically and emotionally abusive to her. Starting out, I was a friend to her for months and it began developing into something more. But one day she abruptly cut it off and left me devastated. She called a few months later and explained that she had been abused again and she felt terrible and thought she was messed up and wasn't worthy of me, but finally had the strength to call me again. I felt terrible that it happened, but I was thankful she was alright. She said she liked me a lot and thought about me all the time.       Our relationship progressed from there and our love for each other grew stronger. Then I visited her, and it was like magic! We fell in love with each other. All we did was hug. Since then, we talked more and more, and we expressed our love for each other so many times.      The next time around, I traveled 1500 miles by bus to propose to the love of my life. I met her parents and church parents and they all fell i love with me. I proposed to her in our special place and she said yes! This time we hugged, kissed, and were feeling each other, but we never had sex. She showed her parents and church family the ring and everyone was so excited.       When I arrived back home, we started talking about wedding plans and how we can get to spend more time with each other. Then she started calling me less and less over the next few days. Finally I called her to see what was going on and she said that she doesn't think that I am the one for her and that I shouldn't call her or see her anymore. She also said that she thinks I just want to marry her for sex and that she doesn't trust me. I said that if she doesn't want me to call her, I'll respect that, but please believe that i love her with all my heart and i've told the truth to her and I was open and honest every time. She was getting emotional and hung up in my face and i was so hurt. She texted me back the next day and said that she likes me a lot, she just needs time to herself. She hasn't called me for 3 weeks and it hurts me so much.      What am I to make of all this? Does she not love me anymore? What have I done to make her lose trust in me? I told the truth and was honest. Did our feeling each other that night push one of her buttons and make her want to pull away? If she just needs time to herself, why would she say such hurtful things like she doesn't think i'm the one for her? I want to show her that I am there for her, but how can I do that if she doesn't want to hear from me or see me? Please help me.
20090128095837AA5whpI	Family & Relationships;Friends	OMG...can somebody please read this and be angry at my friend with me?	Okay,so basically me and my friend ordered dresses for ourselves off asos.com,but asos.com got the address mixed up and the dresses wernt delivered.         So I made a big effort,emailing royal mail,asos and my local post office to see were the dresses were.      It turns out that they have been returned to asos.com      My friend didn't once say thanks for all the effort I went into to try and get the dresses,and when I informed her about the dresses getting returned she just complained to me about not having the dress in time for her sister's wedding.         We can't get the dresses delivered to my house,as my mother and father are both teachers and are away all day. Her father is unemployed,and her mother is a nurse and works loads of nights,however my friend lied to me and said that nobody at her house during the day and to get them delievered to mine,which I can't and when I explained the just said 'whatever.'         I think the reason why she doesn't want them to be delivered to her house is becuase her mother doesn't want to pay customs, but of course I'll give her money for that.         GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.         We have school all day and don't be at home during the day to get the dresses.

20090128103706AAPJEzL	Family & Relationships;Friends	I got caught smoking weed for the first time and got suspended?	So im in gr 10. I got suspended yesterday because I was high during class and the teacher noticed it right away.      Basically this guy from my gym class, everyone respects him and everyone likes him, he's reall cool has nice clothes and he's real strong and powerful for his age, so many girls like him too. So during gym class yesterday he asked me if I wanted to hang with him next class (which was his lunch and my lunch break) and of course I said yeah, so he told me this cool place to chill and we sat on a log and he pulled out a joint and I knew it was weed right away, and he started smoking it and then he told me to have a toke its awesome and you'll love it.       He knew I never smoked weed before, so I took a toke and he was all giving me props and at the time I was "in the moment" so I kept smoking it and passed it back to him and he passed it back to me and then he rolled another joint, and I smoked that one too. I felt so weird and was so high I didn't know where I was or what I was doing and everything was real tippy and wavey and made me real dizzy, i couldnt walk straight either but he seemed to be totally fine and was able to walk perfectly. I had class after lunch block (my lunch block is the second last class) so I had to go to my last class high. turns out he didn't have a last class and the lunch block was his last one, he had another class in the morning. He told me "peace man" and he left me near the school and he took the bus and went off.      when i got in class I was compeltely studdering and like 5 minutes after the teacher looked at me and took me to the principles office and phoned my parents and they said it was unacceptable that I did that. my parents are completely choked and I'm suspended for 3 and a half days.       I dont' really think it was my fault, (the guys name is Jake) he never got in trouble or anything and just went home. I don't really think it was fair and wasn't my fault, i didn't expect that to happen. I was real scared going into school too because there is over 2000 people. my mom thinks I'm turning into a rebel bad kid and I don't really know how to handle it. I totally regret it...Was it actually fair, I got suspended for 3 days like that. really.

20090128112315AAoW9uX	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Let me know what you think?	My husband comes home every night and talks about one particular co-worker (female) then the other night we were talking about a certain neighborhood and he said oh guess who lives there! I feel as if he is attracted to this person and I have talked to him about it but he just denies it he says that she is ugly and not his type at all. But at the christmas party she never even bothered to introduce herself to me but yet her and my husband talk all the time and then she gave me dirty looks the whole time. Am I crazy or does it sound like he is cheating. Also he flirts constantly with all of the female co-workers. He doesn't think it is flirting but what he says could get him fired for sexual harassment. He doesn't show me any attention at home at night and I feel like he cares more for other women than me. What should I do?       Please don't leave any smart*** comments I want honest answers!

20090128115046AAAZKEu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Divorce guides for PARENTS, but hardly any for TEENS?	Okay, so I've noticed that there are hardly any divorce guides for teens.  I, myself, am a teenage daughter of divorce and have been looking for books on it.  There are hardly any!  I'm actually considering writing my own book on it.  If there are books, then they are about getting closer to your Heavenly Father rather than your Earthly Father.  I'm a Christian, and I'm all for God, but sometimes religion can't solve your emotional problems.  I, personally, believe there should be more books on divorce out there to help teens through it.  Not just the parents of the teens.  Some kids' parents can't afford a therapist for the teen, and most teens don't want to talk about it.  Reading helps.  What are your thoughts on this?

20090128115828AAfNpjj	Family & Relationships;Friends	Question about teachers?	My band director and I are able to talk to each other in a different way than other teachers. He's himself around me and a few other kids; he'll tell me what he thinks about another student, even if it's bad, he'll complain about his personal life, he'll use curse words, even tell me a racist joke that he heard on television or YouTube. He has a Facebook, and we occasionally message each other to see what's new. On certain days, I'll go to the band room for lunch to talk to him. One day, neither of the two guys that normally join me came, so I went down the the band room alone. He was sitting in the middle of the room, watching "The Mummy" on DVD and at the same time, doing the budget for the music department. We watched the movie, just him and I in the room, while he did the budget, with some general conversation throughout.   I know that you're all thinking he's a rapist. But I know he's not like that. My question is, do you think it's inappropriate for a relationship like this between a teacher and a student, or is it possible that you can be friends?    By the way, I'm a girl.

20090128121044AAKYC9f	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I feel trapped, how do I make my marraige work?	I'm in a situation that just keeps getting worse. I'm married and a stay at home mom of three small kids. My husband can be controlling and it seems like he has no respect for me and how I feel. This has been going on for sometime now. I rarely get any time to be away by myself. My husband is always critisizing me over everything. From the way I dress, to how I handle the kids, how I cook meals, etc. He makes it seem like everything that goes wrong is my fault. He comes home from work and will police the house to see if anything is out of place. We don't go out anywhere but to the grocery store and then its straight back home. It is hard to find a sitter that will watch our kids so that we can have some alone time. Then I get comments from people all the time out in public at a store. They see me by myself with the kids and they say "oh my you have your hands full don't you" or "how do you handle three kids". I totally ignore them and keep walking. It's none of their business. I'm to a point where I am so tired of my husbands constant comments and belittleing. I have tried talking to him and it just makes everything worse. After ten years of marraige, I'm to the point where I wish I never got married at all.

20090128121614AAAd3zg	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friendship trouble! What should I do about my problem friend?	Okay, well, I'm in eighth grade, and I'm having my share of friendship problems. There's this girl....      Well, she came to our school starting last year, and I guess she assumed that she'd have a lot of friends. She'd previously gone to a different school in town and so she vaguely knew a lot of the people in my school--only, she seemed under the impression that they all really like her a lot. She joined our clique, assuming that a lot of my friends were her "bffl"s. And I hang out with a polite lot, so they tolerated her, even though she was a little.... well....      I want to say she's weird, but that's inaccurate. She's just.... mean. She thinks it's funny when she puts people down, and she's a huge suck-up to people higher on the popularity totem poll (I'll get to that in a sec). Plus there's the way that she spreads mean rumors and talks down to people she doesn't like, and--this is what ticks me off the most--she cries, almost daily, to get attention! My friend called her out on a mean rumor she started, and she burst into tears, trying to make my friend look like a terrible person, and melodramatically ran away, trying to get people to follow her. Whenever someone compliments her, they'll imediately regret it, because she'll snap "No! I suck!" just so that you can insist it and say it to her over and over again until you've fed her ego enough. I actually called her out on it once, the pity-begging, and this was her defence, honestly quoted: "But... I really do think I suck!" Ugh.....      As for the popularity totem poll.... Well, she tries not to be such a brat to people who she thinks will earn her prestige if she befriends them. It's really pathetic, actually. I was new to the crew that I'm currently a part of when she tried to get in, but I'd known her vaguely long before I started hanging out with my now good friends. Over the summer we got along okay, but we did NOT see eye to eye.      It became apparent to me that I was her "back-up friend" when my REAL friends decided that they didn't feel like hanging with her. For instance, we hung out all this summer, and she was just peachy, but when we came back for a new school year, she pretended she didn't know me, unless we were alone! It was so pathetic, especially in light of the current situaltion.      Well, as you know, I've taken a lot of crap from her, probably more than most of my classmates. And my friends are a very decent lot (as are most girls in our advanced classes), so they tried to tolerate as much as they could--but, eventually, as of the last month, they've all pretty much stopped pretending to be her friend, and ignored her (they even moved to a different table at lunch).      Of course, she's very upset about that. My good friend and I were the last people to stay with her at our old table, just so she wouldn't be completely alone, before we booked it. It ticks me off that I'm trying to be nice to her, after all the crap I've taken! Anyway, she didn't really appreciate my good friend's trying to be nice, because she hates my good friend (ironically the same one I mentioned earlier about calling her out on a nasty rumor).      So anyway, now she's clinging to ME. She's realized that she's driven everyone away (well, actually she's trying to convince herself that it was all my good friends fault, haha), and now that I'm the only one she has left, she's super sugary-sweet to me, always telling me how I'm her best friend ever, and wanting to hang out with me whenever she can. The only problem is.....      I DO NOT LIKE HER. At all. After everything I've taken from her? After how she used to treat me? I would just love to abandon her like all of my friends did. By the way, don't judge them too harshly. They feel really bad about it, and they go to the guidance counselor every day to try and clear this up. Anyway, I'd love to join them and not be stuck being friends with her.      But I can't. I've tried, and it really upsets her, and I know that she's the kind of person that will not allow a clean, easy break. And how could I, anyway? How could I possibly justify myself? "I don't like you. Leave me alone, I'm not your friend." I can't do that. She's already completely alone with no support, sucking up to me, and hinting about how things are really hard for her at home. She started crying just because she thought I might be mad at her! But how can I liberate myself? All of my friends say that its not worth it, and that she wouldn't want a friend that didn't like her anyway. That's true, but seriously, morally, shouldn't I just bare with her? I'm trying to be nice to her, and it makes me feel sick to see someone abandon someone else that's so vulnerable.      What can I do, though? I really don't want to be her friend, but I think she needs to support..... so should I be her friend?
20090128121913AAdyxud	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I have said what I have said?	I have a friend and i didn't know if I said thee right thing when we were on the phone.   last summer she had sex with a guy and then he moved far away to live with his dad   today he sent her a message on myspace and said he loved her but I didn't think he really does I think he just wants to get in her pants.   She told me he said that and I told her that she might want to think about things before she devotes her life to him.   He only comes up about three times a year and last time he came up he didn't even call her or ask her if she wants to hang out.   She has plenty of people that she could see way more and that like her where we live.   It concerns me because I think she likes him because he has sex with her. and vise versa   Now that I told her that I think she should think about everything before she devotes her life to him she wont talk to me.      Should I have said that. Was it right for me to say.   Help me please..

20090128130724AA9qZTA	Family & Relationships;Friends	ARE MY FRIENDS RIGHT ABOUT HIM? PLEASE HELP, MATURE ANSWERS!?	-i know i posted this a while ago but my computer wouldnt let me read the replies-      I was in a 4 year relationship with my ex boyfriend until he got arrested 5 years ago. Im 25 & he is 27. He was my first love & when he got locked up i couldn't stop crying. He in a dangerous gang, We have some mutual friends(not the gang ones) and whenever some of my friends go for a night out and he's there with friends i try keep my distance from him but i keep getting the feelings i had for him come back to me. When i leave he follows me out to talk. although i still love him i think i did the right thing. Anyway whenever im dancing he never takes his eyes off me,He gets into my face a lot if i dance with other guys, he grabs my arm if i walk away, he has never once hit me though. My friends are under the impression he knows he screwed up badly and he doesn't want anyone else to have me, that he is obsessed with me and that can be a major problem when i am dancing or with other guys would that be true?. He keeps telling me he wants me back and will never let me go again. If im at a bar or something he will sometimes come over a put his arms around me & try kiss me or whisper in my ear, but i walk away then he will try to make me look him in the eyes and tell him i dont love him, which i cant do.He even now has my name tattooed on the side of his neck. I think im attracted to these kind of men because my father is in jail & he is one of the head men in a Latino Blood Gang. Im starting counseling soon so maybe that will help?!   Please give me some advice if you can, thank you so much      -i know a lot of you are going to attack me but all im looking for is some advice-
20090128125941AAOiImj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Wife started period week early, whats wrong, more to the story?	I was told that my wife was seen out with another man on two occasions acting "like a couple".  I've suspected she was having an affair but had no real evidence bcuz i was always left at home with the kids. I confronted her on New Years Day and told her she needed to decide if she wanted to be with me or not. She stayed and our home life has been great, but we havent had sex in 30 days, use to be once a week. She started her period a week earlier, the day after she went out with friends till 3:45am. Normally her periods last 5 days but this one lasted 8-9 days. Did she sleep with the guy the night before and have rough sex to cause her period to start early or is it just from no sex and stress? She's never been that enthusiastic about sex until i turn her on.

20090128123141AAxA61S	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I wrong to be depressed when i feel like my husband doesn't listen to me? ?	I have had some serious disagreements with my new husband and it has made me totally depressed. When we met, he loved to ride motorcycles and had two. I said they made me nervous and I would always worry about him, and I made it clear that I didn't see myself in a motorcycle household. He argued that he was a safe rider and that if he ever had kids he would get rid of them. Before we got engaged, he said as soon as i said "yes" to his proposal, he would sell the motorcycles because he didn't want to do something that would make me worry. Then 3 days before our wedding, and right after a family holiday, he got down on his knees with tears in his eyes, and said he needed to ask me a really difficult question. He said he really loved the motorcycles and didn't want to sell them and was that okay with me. I was really furious but I didn't feel that I could say "no" and I was afraid it would jeopardize our wedding, and also at this time I had cut back my working hours and was already financially dependent and I felt trapped. So I said "Fine." and I didn't feel comfortable at that moment to confirm whether he would sell them if we had kids. That was a few weeks ago, and now I feel that I was manipulated into making that concession, and that it was a mistake, and that I should have secured the part about selling them if we had kids.       Last weekend, we were out to a special, romantic dinner and I was sure he was not paying attention to me because he was watching a young attractive waitress make up tables for what seemed like a long time, more than a passing glance. I had experienced this on 4 occasions and had never said anything. Not a passing glance but staring at waitresses from afar, staring at them for about 30 seconds when waitresses were at the table, and even turning his head to follow them around the room as they walk past. I told him in what he acknowledges was a nice voice that I felt like he was looking at other women when we went out, that it hurt my feelings, and made me not enjoy going out to dinner anymore. He got all mad, raised his voice, did some cursing, said I ruined the dinner, and claimed he didn't even know there were any waitresses and that he was looking in the direction of the door to see if our food was coming. I said ok maybe that time it was possible it was a coincidence, except that I had specific examples of when it happened other times. I tried to explain, but he said he didn't remember, and that he was sure he never would have done something  so awful. I said maybe he just didn't realize, but he said I was just imagining and exaggerating what I saw because I was insecure, but I let it go, because I didn't want to "ruin the dinner."      Also, he is very overweight. He won't tell me how much but he has a hard time fitting into XXL clothes even and his pants size is 46-50. I don't mind how he looks, he's great on the inside, but I am very concerned about his health, his life span, and how that will affect his fertility, and if we have kids, i don't want them to get teased because their dad is so big. When we first met, he started going to the gym about 4 times a week and lost 22lbs. I was praises all the way, never criticized his weight, just made it about wanting him to be healthy so we coudl have a long life together, and made lots of fun positive changes into our eating to make it easy for him. Then for a few months he stopped going and it looks like he gained a lot of the weight back, from his sedentary job and probably eating things off our diet at work and when he goes out. Before our wedding, we decided to both try and lose weight to look better for it. Over four months, our goal was 20 lbs for him and 10 for me. I lost eight and he lost zero. He only went to the gym when I went with him, and his workouts were on the short side. I feel like now that he has me for sure, he's not worried about trying to impress me or stay in shape or healthy for me. I'd always like to be thinner and I watch my weight like a hawk, but I do go to a lot of trouble and sacrifice to fit into the skimpy lingerie outfits that he loves. It's upsetting that he has stopped  entirely. I asked gently about it, and he says oh its just something that he has to make himself do, and that I've been really supportive, but that's not making him do anything. i feel like he is ignoring something that is very important for me.       Now a couple days later we had an argument and I was feeling very very depressed in the evening. He wanted to talk about what was wrong, but I said I didn't feel comfortable sharing my feelings, because I feel like it doesn't matter what I think unless I agree with him, and that what I want is secondary, and that he's really going to make the decisions, even when he makes a big promise. He started acting all outraged and how could i even think that about him when he's so great to me, and demanded examples. I gave him the examples of that I felt that he took it back about the motorcycles and

Well my fiancee would not qualify w/me to get a loan for a house we wanted to buy so my sister agreed to sign w/me b/c she did qualify & she did.  She didn't put any money into the house. She's recently had problems w/my fiancee so she's moving out and now she wants us to give her back the "rent money" she had been paying for 8% of what the house cost us when we finish paying it.  She had agreed that rent would be rent and there would be no refunds on that and she agreed.  Well now she says that she didn't "sign" anything and now we feel obligated to agree to one of her options.  I do not agree w/any of it b/c she did not invest in it.  What should I do? Should I even be mad at her b/c I feel like she's back stabbing me.  I didn't think she needed to "sign" a contract b/c I trusted her enough b/c she's my sister.  Help!
