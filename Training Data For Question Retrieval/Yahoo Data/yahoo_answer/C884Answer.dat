qBCGH52haa	Unluckily, I ran your numbers on a number of "affordability" calculators, and you have hit the nail on the head - your debt-to-income ratio is well over the usual guidelines.  Since you are in banking, have you talked to a mortgage loan officer at your bank (I assume you are in retail banking as opposed to investment banking).<br>  <br>  Also, have your wife check with the board of education - a lot of Boards provide some interest/down payment/cash assistance to teachers to entice them to live in and stay with the county.<br>  <br>  Other options might be an FHA loan - shop around for a bank in your area that participates in the program.|`|VELnLnIKaa	go for a pre approval from a lender they will tell you|`|5gG2OfHIaa	O.K.  You have to make your first home purchase between April 9, 2008 to July 1, 2009.   The credit (not just a deduction) is $7,500 and your family qualifies for the "full biscuit"  if your joint adjusted gross income remains under 150K.   I have not been a home buyer for a number of years; but, I did read a condensed version of the The American Recovery and Investment Act of 2009 which I assume has not been amended since February 12, 2009.  My only actionable advice is that you are in the 6th inning of this tax credit plan.  So, I hope you will move fast to benefit from this buyer's market and the tax credit.|`|QAsT4EKFaa	If you make $120,000 a year, the monthly income is $10,000 per month.  FHA will typically not go above 45% on your debt to income ratios, but since your credit is so high, I've qualified clients up to as high as 55% in debt to income ratios.  Believe it or not, it still pays to have good credit.  In FHA's eyes, your excellent credit is a compensating factor.  So let's multiply $10,000 X .55 = $5,500 minus $3,800 (current debts) = $1,700 left over to use as a monthly housing payment.  Even if you can't qualify up to 55%, at 50%, you are still qualifying for a monthly housing payment of $1,200, which is still the amount you are looking for.  I would go to your lender that knows how to do FHA, and I'm positive you will qualify for a monthly amount between $1,200 and $1,700 per month.<br>  <br>  Please keep in mind that FHA will require you to put 3.50% into the purchase, so in your case, if you are purchasing a $160,000 home, you will be required to put $5,600 into the transaction.  I would also recommend that you ask the seller to pay between 3 and 4 percent for your closing costs so you are only bringing the 3.50% .<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!!!

Thefts and burned out cars usually get investigated by Special Investigative Units in insurance companies.<br>  <br>  There is a lot of fraud and that is why they get investigated.   You can ask them to provide you with a rental car while they are investigating the claim.    After everything checks out o.k. they will pay you the value of the car.  Check the Kelly Blue Book value on it.   Even though they do not only use that value anymore either.   But you can get a rough idea there.

As long as you are providing a free sight test to anyone using DSE equipment, and are prepared to pay towards glasses if needed for DSE use only (most employers will pay approx ￡45), then you are meeting your obligations under Health and Safety law.  Most opticians are open on Saturdays and many of the larger chains open late nights and Sundays as well.<br>  <br>  You could offer unpaid time off for eye tests if you really wanted to (or allow people to make the time up later) - but you will then have to consider allowing time off for other medical appointments.|`|811921e95b3795dad10075b3f9e12029aa	Not clear if your providing the free eye tests is because of the nature of their work, or if this is a convenient gift from your business- say if you are in the eye-testing business.

Save the paper from teh postal that stated it was returned, offer to scan or take a picture and send to ebay and pay pal. Use the front page of ebay, look for the live chat now little icon in the top right corner and use live chat to help, they will most likely give you links to contact. Contact every link they send and any others they find. Contact Pay pal by phone and by emails right away, its a hassell but save your feedback. Learn how to not get them able to give you a non mailed bad feedback too. its not your fault, in the end you may have to refund their money, but find out how to keep your postage, find out how to charge them more money for new postage if they do want it, but be quick on contacting everyone. There are shaddy people that do try to decide not to want the item and do this to the seller. There are also people who have life situations where they were unable to get to the post office because of big family problems. Sorry this happened, good deal to always do the recorded, here in the US I do the confimed, meaning someone has to sign for it when I send gifts, Ive not sold on Ebay, Im too afriad of issues such as your going through. So go get it all taken care of and it should work out in your favor, I hope it does. Contact the seller with email nicely explaining what happend, and then put I contacted Ebay and Pay Pal to find out  how to resolve this issue best, looking forward to hearing from you what you would like to do.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S., Canada and Europe which you can create to generate income:<br>  <br>  1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding.

They'll teach you everything you need to know about being a chef, and the foodservice industry in general.|`|TNXr0DKMaa	Since a kid I've always watned to become a culinary chef. It wasn't until high school when i was enrolled in  a few culinary classes,hospitality etc then i was recommended by my high school culinary teachers to compete in heat competitions, and was able to be a intern as a chef at the 5 star crown plaza hotel.<br>  And it wasn't until after this was all done (about my junior year) i realized how much hard work and sweat, sleepless nights, go into being a proffesional chef. I realized after this wasn't for me. dnt get me wrong I never quit. not once while in the kitchen for what seemed to be forever. I did what I had to do, even if it was for 100 people at a time, with my leader. it was tough, but it had to be done.<br>  im trying to show you from my point of view. I was a real person, with a real dream, with a real talent for something I enjoyed doing, and I though I had a future in. this wasn't just a "im gna wake up today and wanna be a chef" its so much more.  but things change(even me when I dreamt it as a child.) and you seem to view things in 20/20. <br>   I enjoyed it all, really. I'll never ever forget any of it. the teachers, the chefs, the experience in the kitchen. But it truly wasn't for me. I got lucky. I had a talent that should be used and I wanted it out there, and not show people what I could do at the age of 16! .but my main passion is acting 1 in reality, 1 in my heart.<br>  not trying to sound cocky at all, but you should really try and go for it. do it first, get a hands on experience to see if its what you want to do for the rest of your life..!<br>  <br>  once you start thinking "..is this what I wanna do forever?" you'll knw if its for you or not.<br>  and ask yourself  " do you really have a talent and what it takes to be a chef? or do you just like the idea of being a chef?"<br>  <br>  you must start at the bottom(unless you are just amazing by nature) enroll at ur local community college in culinary courses. (to see how its going to be) if you like it after 2 years..go onto a university in where you'll major in it. don't expect to not go to college and have ur career handed to u on a silver platter. there are plenty chefs who made it without school.(the naturals) but ask them how long it took to get there. lol you go to school to learn how to do things a certain way...but when you leave you should be able to put your own spin on things.<br>  <br>  I hope you tke my advice and let it soak! god bless--|`|eyrCiP1Daa	1st definetly get ur ged, then atten d culinary school if possible , or you could apply for a job as an assistant cook at your local restaurants and get as much information regarding the road to professionalism in being a chef,and u could also cook a few samples for people who are looking to host parties and events, and allow them to preview your talent and give cheap prices and get booked with that comes gainful experience and opportunity.

4Jy8Hioiaa	Py off all your debt first. Credit cards, Car, student loans, everything. Then make sure you have at least 6 months of living expenses saved in an emergency account. If you lose your job when you move out and you have a 12 month lease, if you don't have this money you will be screwed. I would recommend that for the first couple of months after you decide to take the plunge in the real world that you take it easy on spending. If this is your first time out of the nest, you probably don't realize just how expensive it is to be independent. Don't go out and buy a new furniture set on a credit card. Pick up some used stuff. It may be ugly and not the best in the world but you can and will survive on it. Trust me, we all did. Just don't go into debt. Good luck dude.|`|0Mj9b0Aoaa	You generally need to pay first and last months rent when renting a place for the first time.  If you have a decent paying job and can afford the rent from that point then you should be fine with just the first and last months rent.  Do you have furniture?  Consider that you need to buy some.  <br>  <br>  The most important thing is looking at the monthly costs and determining if you can afford them.  You can save up as much as you want, if you are constantly overspending on car insurance, rent, utilities etc. you will eventually run out.|`|7UNxSYhaaa	Who is making the payments ?

MWSPSBMFaa	Why another Bachelor's degree? Why not go for your Master's? I graduated in May of 2008 with my BA and for 6 long months I struggled hard to find a job. I finally found one this past November, thank God and got really lucky. However, it is very rough right now as jobs are so scarce. I would definitely encourage looking into jobs now and especially internships. That was my one regret. I waited to long to look thinking that it would be easy to find one. It's really not so if the working route is the way you want to go then I would suggest starting to look now. Also, go to your campus' career center. They can offer you great tips on how to interview, search and apply for jobs and if you're CC is anything like mine, they can help find you an internship.<br>  <br>  As for your loans, payback usually does not start until about 6 months after graduation so you have some time but when they come boy do they come! You can try to defer them if you're state gives you that option. At least in NC, as long as you're in school you do not have to pay on them until you are finished.<br>  <br>  Anyway good luck with whatever you decide to do. :)

Many of them also have on-line sites.<br> <br> Additionally, do not, never ever, borrow from more than one payday lender at a time.

EzrdyxAiaa	first of all i hope you did notified them in writing when you have a "changed conditions" that you will be submitted a claim - and since this first notification you have submitted a claim!!!  and yes under the clause you referenced  you can remove the material but remember any material removed will have to be replaced at a later date and you will get stuck for the additional labor -- without having the complete terms and conditions of the contract i really hate to give out advise!!! most contracts also have a clause where by if the contractor fails to perform the owner can take that work away and sub it out to a different contractor and bill the original contractor for any additional costs!!! strongly suggest you have a set down with the owner and try to work out your differences!!!

dRj9FoHzaa	The lease has very little to do with GM.  Basically, you borrowed money from a financial institution, a bank for example.  This relationship is between you and this financial institution.  The GM has already collected the money, so its bankruptcy does not impact you except perhaps when your car needs an oil change.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Your lease contract remains valid.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Nothing changes for your lease. The money you owe to GM is considered an asset. Somebody will buy that asset (ie buy the right to collect your payments) but they will still be obligated to the original contract. Other than possibly sending your payments to a different address, nothing will change for you.|`|4Jy8Hioiaa	Nothing for the time being. If GM goes into bankruptcy, they will still be operating, but under government oversight or debtor in possession situation. Nothing will happen to your lease. It will continue on as is.

f714ef26ad8f0b92d25c68a6b4041d5daa	Use a mortgage calculator (I put a link to Bankrate's calculator below).  It allows you to try different mortgage amounts, interest rates, and time periods to see what the payments would be.  You should do your own budget to see what payment you can afford each month.  When doing your budget remember that the interest portion of your payments is tax deductible if you itemize (which allows you to afford a higher mortgage payment than rent payment).  But don't forget to add property taxes and insurance.  Also, unless you put down 20% or get 80-20 financing, you'll need to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI).<br>  <br>  It's always a good idea to do all this figuring before you go to a lender.  It's important for you to know what you can afford before someone tries to tell you what they think you can afford.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uoEflSISaa	Lenders go by your debt to income ratio, but YOU know how much you can afford.

E1ztfbg8aa	<a href="http://goodsurveysites.com" rel="nofollow">http://goodsurveysites.com</a> Its what I do and it's worked out pretty well. What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time.

But if it pays more, you could take it for now but try to get a better job soon!|`|TCctLAPCaa	No! This will only set you back. It will not impress future employers and will not make your resume look any better. Stay at your current job and look for a part time job for some extra income. I waitress 2 nights a week for extra money and make really good money. So try getting a second job. You should also look for a better full time job then your current one. $8 AN HOUR IS REALLY LOW. GOOD LUCK!|`|VPQLoSYFaa	you have a better chance at a factory at making more money than at fast food. i have been doing factory work since 2004 after high school and i made a lot more doing that than at fast food.
WGSuDLcZaa	You need more confidence in yourself.  From what you have written, I believe you are doing your best.  That's all anyone can do at work.  <br>  <br>  If you make a huge mistake at work, the boss would call you into his office and speak to you himself. Usually they want to help you do your best job.  If he sent one of his secretaries, he probably thought that they could help you correct the problem without getting involved. He should deal with serious problems. <br>  <br>  Do you have a friend that you confide in?  Someone you can trust to keep your discussions secret.  Not that you are saying anything bad, but you need someone to vent to that isn't going to sabotage you in the future.  All jobs have good and bad days. <br>  <br>  Keep a positive attitude.  Each day you will gain knowledge in your abilities. Don't forget to ask your co-workers for advice if needed (this will cut down on mistakes if you have never done the task before). Believe me, each of them has had a bad day at work before. And they each have attitudes positive and negative about their co-workers.<br>  <br>  Smile as you complete your tasks and you'll feel better when it's time to go home.|`|56MmKc5caa	u will not always like everyone u work with and not everyone will like you u just need to deal with it. i am sure they are watching u but everyone makes mistakes.relax|`|OPHt95Vfaa	well like the others said no one is perfect im sure there had done mistake maybe far worse than you did.and they dont  want anyone to know about it.just relax all will forget soon
mwkfirjRaa	If you plan to stay in the house for at least seven years, and you are well able to afford the expenses of home ownership, including maintenance, repairs, and taxes, then this is a good time to buy.  Interest rates are at historic lows, prices are considerably lower than in the recent past, and there is a new tax credit up to $8,000 for first-time homebuyers that does not have to be repaid.<br>  <br>  If you cannot stay in the house for seven or more years, then you might be better off renting.  Real estate prices may well decline another 20-30% in 2009.  If you are in it for the long term, this won't be a concern, but over the short term, prices are not expected to rise and you won't be able to recoup your costs if you have to sell.<br>  <br>  Also, consider how stable your job and income are.

vEsSIGfYaa	You don't say where you live, but the laws and codes at the apartment location govern what can and cannot be done.  If I understand the situation as you describe it, this situation is an unconscionable travesty of justice.<br>  <br>  From what you state in your question, it sounds like the vandalism occurred AFTER y'all had officially moved out.  Normally, most apartment complexes do a "final" inspection WITH the tenant[s] on final move-out.  This "establishes" the condition at that moment when the possession is transferred back to management.  If this was not done, then there will be a battle regarding WHEN it happened.<br>  <br>  I suspect that the apartment ownership and management are too "cheap" to have insurance to cover this loss, and are looking for a "scapegoat" to pass the costs onto, and those costs may well be inflated to gain a little profit at someone else's expense.<br>  <br>  ANYTHING that occurs AFTER possession by the complex is THEIR responsibility, unless your brother or mother later broke in and caused the damage.  Of course your mother is still not considered legally responsible until she is found guilty in a court of law for the vandalism damage.<br>  <br>  This is a very SERIOUS issue, and regardless of fianancial considerations IS a situation where legal counsel is an ABSOLUTE NECESSITY.<br>  <br>  Not knowing where the apartment is located, I cannot provide a name of the local governmental agency that would handle this, so the following suggestions for possible action [s] on your mother's part are generic in nature.<br>  <br>  1.  Your mother ought to report this to her local law enforcement authorities as a criminal EXTORTION attempt.  The THREAT of damaging her credit rating is CRIMINAL EXTORTION.  <br>  <br>  Naturally to avoid doing any work that they can get out of, the Police will try to discourage your mom making  this report, claiming it is a "civil matter," BUT remind her to continually EMPHASIZE that the crux of this issue is not the vandalism allegation by the apartment management, BUT is an out and out EXORTION ATTEMPT.<br>  <br>  The ONLY negative about involving the Police is that your brother MUST NOT have been involved in the vandalism.<br>  <br>  <br>  2.  Most communities have legal aid societies or organizations which help people unable to afford an attorney.  They are usually listed in the Yellow Pages of your local telephone book.<br>  <br>  3.  Contact local Priests or Ministers for guidance in finding help in resolving this issue.  They may have attorneys in their congregations who do Pro Bono [free] legal work for people in need.<br>  <br>  4.  I think you are correct regarding the apartment providing an ITEMIZED inventory of the damages, and for the costs of materials and labor.<br>  <br>  5.  A POSSIBLE "good" point is this is that IF you mom signed an agreement to pay the damages for which she is alledged to be responsible, then it's possible she may be able to find an law firm [be sure it's the BEST experienced in this type of case] to file a civil lawsuit against the ownership AND manager for FRAUD [a FALSE claim against your mom is fraud], and in many of this type of cases they charge no fee unless they win and thus your mom prevails.<br>  <br>  Not only that, but in some locals [such as Texas] IF they are proved guilty of fraud, they could be required to pay "treble" [3 times] the legitimate damages she suffered.  Of course your mom will have to share that with the lawfirm, but that's the cost of them gambling on outlaying their time and money if your mom's case fails to be won.|`|fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	Your mother needs to deal with the landlord directly.  Send a letter...certified...demanding proof of damages and receipts.  By law, the landlord must provide them.|`|RQvLrKMXaa	Your mother needs to notify the owners of the vacated apartment that they have to show proof that the vandalism was done prior to them turning in the keys.  They, your mother and brother, should have insisted on a walk-through inspection with the owners of the apartment.  An itemized bill is an absolute necessity.  BTW, the owner of the apt. doesn't have to speak with you, even if you have written permission from your mother.  If your mother wishes you to be involved in these negotiations, then your mother needs to schedule a date and time for a meeting and inform the owner that you will be present for counseling.|`|pNy8lakjaa	First off, your mother should not be held liable for this, especially after they moved out. The owners should have done a quick walk through, to verify everything is in pristine condition, and you can attest to that. They cannot put anything on your mom's credit, unless they got a court order with a judgment against her. I would have her tell them that they have to give her a detailed list of what is wrong with pictures to back up their claims if they want any money out of her.<br>  <br>  Edit: It sounds like they are scamming your mother. Did they return the security deposit?|`|kifwyOgKaa	So, the apartment was vandalized AFTER your mother/brother turned in the keys?  <br>  <br>  I don't understand how the owner can even put any of the blame on your mother.  <br>  <br>  If I were your mother, I would contact the owner and ask for proof of when the vandalism took place, and proof of when she turned in the keys.  Then I would take them to the police department and file a harrassment charge.|`|eV6MHADQaa	stop making payments when you turned in the key you gave up responsibility for the property If it was vandalized after that you are not responsible at all.they tell you now that when you foreclose a prop the last owner is responsible for removal of all appl. before leaving still people still will find the prop. vandalized before the work crew can winterize it.|`|LpVwWJVsaa	Some states have a provision where landlords must return or provide an itemized list of damages within a certain amount of time, otherwise the residents are required to double the security deposit.  If the resident disagrees with the findings, they have a set amount of time to dispute the damages otherwise the notice of damages is considered correct.|`|NcFWcO3Laa	Before the landlord could harm your mother's credit she would have to go to court and get a judgment.   That would take at least a month or two.  By then your mom should be in her new home.<br>  <br>  It has taken 3+ months to notify you that there is a problem?  What happened to the security deposit?  Most states require the security deposit to be either returned or a written accounting of why the deposit is not being returned within a month after the property has been vacated.<br>  <br>  Tell the landlord to sue you in small claims court and that you will be filing a counter-suit for her unlawfully withholding the security deposit.  In my state if a landlord withholds either the security deposit or the written accounting of damages the owner can be liable for up to triple damages of the amount withheld.<br>  <br>  IS THERE AN ECHO IN HERE?|`|AA11173563	did they do a final exit walk through with you and mom? If not they have no way of knowing what the condition was. Now if you can prove that they came over and looked before it was vandalized then you have a case. If not they can place it on there if they want to do so.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Did your brother do a walk through with the landlord prior to moving out?  It sounds like the vandalism took place after your brother moved out but before the landlord inspected the unit.  What would have happened if the unit were vandalize while your brother was still living there?  My point is the landlord has insurance and it sounds like they are looking to your mother as it's a quicker way to get the repair money or for some reason they don't want to notify their insurance company.  The big three credit reporting agencies don't accept credit reports from landlords (I've tried), but don't rock the boat at this time.  Continue the damage payments until your mother closes on her new home, then stop and tell the landlord to take her to court.  Albiet family, there are witnesses to the condition of the unit when your brother vacated.  <br>  <br>  realtor.sailor

cajRMa3Faa	Well, first you need to decide if you are ready for that responsibility. Ask yourself if you are really going to stay in the area, and more importantly, the neighborhood for a longtime. Do you have a job that is secure enough in these troubled times to have a steady flow of money to pay for the home. And most importantly, do you have a good enough credit score to get a loan. Banks are tanking, and housing is dead, so even good credit won't be good enough in some cases. Cash speaks louder than credit now.<br>  Other than that, there are great deals out there to be had, and you can get yourself a great great deal. So if you think you can do it, hit the real estate agents in your area to start looking, and remember, its like burger king now, have it your way. So everything is negotiable.<br>  Secondly I would talk to banks in my area. Tell them exactly what you want to do, they will be more than happy to have someone discuss it with you. They will also be more than happy to tell you if they would even consider you for a loan. Hope I helped a bit.|`|FPqO2ef3aa	you have to go to your bank and set up an appointment.

No one knows what the real estate market is going to do, but I think prices will keep coming down for at least another year, so you don't want to buy now, and then be paying a mortgage for a house that is going down in value. <br>  Also, it gives you more time to save for the down payment, and the more you put down, obviously, the less your mortgage payment will be.<br>  Some people who bought last year used a $7500. incentive for first time home-buyers. I have just read that this was a LOAN, and has to be paid back, which, I don't think was very clearly explained last year. <br>  This year, and maybe in the future, there will be better incentives and grants to first timers, so you should wait. <br>  Good Luck, <br>  and the best advice I can give you is, hire an experienced and reliable Home Inspector , when you find your house you want to buy, and use a Real Estate Lawyer you can trust.

djSrh5iwaa	I haven't used this particular agency in the past but I know that the majority of agencies that offer 'commercial' work (office admin/call centre etc) will test you. This will be a typing test where you copy out a small text and it times you to give your typing speed.<br>  <br>  They will interview you to find out what sort of work you are interested in and how that aligns with what clients they have and any vacancies that they have at the time. Don't expect to walk into a job straight away and if you have little experience to offer in a sector it may be an idea to temp for a little while as this will give you a flavour of how different companies work. <br>  <br>  Be yourself, be talkative but listen to their questions, be precise in your answers. Smile and make a lot of eye contact without staring at the interviewer. Don't be threatened by them - they are there to help you but importantly remember that you are their 'product' and they make money from you working so it is a two way relationship. <br>  <br>  For this type of interview it is unnecessary to learn about office angels, but make sure that you always research any company thoroughly when they send you for interviews. Importantly, even though this is the agency, make sure you wear appropriate dress, ie... if you want to work in an office environment then wear a suit, or shirt/skirt/trousers and smart shoes. Make your appearance as clean and as smart as possible - light make up, clean hair etc. This is especially important as this will be how the Consultant will remember you when looking through their clients - present yourself as a good product and sell yourself!

d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	No, it's not fraud.<br>  <br>  Tax withheld does not go to your employer - it goes to the taxing entity - like the IRS.<br>  <br>  Your tax is withheld according to how you fill out your W-4 form.  If you are finding yourself owing at tax time, you need to go fill out a new one, and make sure you claim fewer dependents, or select the box for an extra amount  to be withheld from each paycheck.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	What are you talking about?

Look at your paystubs, is there an amount that was withheld?  If you don't have paystub details then calculate your income and then look at what was deposited into your account.  Keep in mind that you may have to pay other taxes such as state income, L&I, FICA (Social Security and Medicare).|`|cd901a6dbadffbf7df11c70f207b4ab4aa	Your boss does not get that money. The US Department of Treasury gets that money. Your boss has nothing to gain by increasing your withholdings. However, I'm sure he is required to comply with whatever you put down on the W4 you filled out.<br>  <br>  There is no guarantee that you will receive a refund check from the IRS. If your tax liability matches what you paid in taxes for the year, then you are in the clear. If your tax liability is more than what you paid in taxes, then you will have to pay the IRS more money by April 15th, 2009. If you paid more taxes over the year than you were supposed to, then you will get a refund.<br>  <br>  Generally, it is best to owe the IRS a small amount of money at the end of the year and owe nothing and get no refund. If you are getting a refund from the IRS, that just means that you overpaid and are essentially giving the government an interest-free loan of your money. It is better to put that money in YOUR pocket throughout the year.|`|OWAjcD4Daa	yes it is and all you have to do is call unemployment and they can give you a record of your earnings and then you can also call the labor board on him so he will have to fix any mistakes

Similar to a corporation, an LLC offers limited liability to its members. However, taxation for an LLC is passed to the individual owners of the LLC and corporate income tax is not paid. <br>  <br>  Sole Proprietorship<br>  A sole proprietorship is a type business that is owned by one person, called the Sole Proprietor.  It is a legal business structure that establishes the business' owner and the business as being the same entity. In other words, everything the business owns belongs to the owner of the business. And, all debts and liabilities of the business are the personal responsibility of the sole proprietor. <br>  <br>  The sole proprietor pays taxes for the business with their own personal tax return. This form of business is also called “proprietorship” but is always owned by only one person.|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	A limited company is a company owned by shareholders you will see them as Ltd or PLC. The first are known as Private Limited Companies the second as Public Limited Companies the latter list and sell shares publicly on the stock market, Private Limited Companies can only sell shares to those approved by the other shareholders. Limited companies are registered  with Companies House and must publish their accounts. Investors in Limited companies have limited liability, this means that the only liability is for the value of the shares, if the company was to go bust therefore shareholders would lose their shares and therefore any money used to buy them would be lost. Sole Traders on the other hand is as the name suggests a business with a single owner, they have no seperate legal identity between business and owner, therefore the debts of the business are also those of the owner, Sole traders have unlimited liability therefore the individual can be sued for the full value of any debts of the business.

If you're going to need the money within the next 5 years, I'd stick with conservative investments like money markets or cd's. However, for long-term investments, now is the best time. Prices are low and the market will eventually recover. be cautious though. Not all companies are going to come out of this recession intact. The gamble is investing in companies that can make it through the recession.  In terms of picking a specific stock, you're better off going with a mutual fund that allows you to diversify your risk.  You can still be invested in GM or any stock you're interested in.

fPLv0QrSaa	I think a savings account would be the best in your situation. It won't earn you much interest but in the course of a year, neither will a CD. It is easier to put money into a savings account. For a CD, you would have to get a new CD every time you wanted to deposit some money. You might tell the bank of your situation.

DisdrG4Taa	Students are expected to verify their actions with their instructor or preceptor.  Nursing students in most cases carry liability insurance to cover their errors.  However, since they are expected to be observed during their actions, they are not exclusively liable.

Also, the hospital usually gets a major share of the responsibility or the university depending on the employer of the instructor or preceptor.|`|Sozc3MyFaa	Yes, to a certain extent; in that you could be possibly dropped from the nursing program.  Would you be sued? Probably not; lawsuits usually go after the big pockets--in this case the hospital (possibly the school program).

Just being a student does not exempt one from all liability.|`|1FqJyyjaaa	Liable, no.  As a nursing student you're under direct supervision of the patient's actual nurse when you're administering medication.

In the end, the actual nurse is responsible for you and that means any errors made by you as the student.<br>  <br>  There is a possibility of getting removed from the nursing program, but that may depend on the severity of the error.

MttTiUrIaa	Law is a competitive field.  If you want the good jobs, you'll need to work hard to get into a good law school.  In the law, ranking is very important.  So before you take the plunge, think very carefully about the amount of debt you'll take on during your 3 years at law school.  I graduated law school last year and the job prospects weren't great.  A lot of my classmates have a huge amount of debt, and some of them still haven't found a job yet.  In fact, at the moment, many law firms are laying off lawyers.  You need to do some research.  See what the bottom 25% of lawyers are doing.  If you know for sure that you'll be ok with ending up there, then go for it.|`|4eGoLRskaa	In this day and age, yes. The deeper we go in recession the more need there will be for lawyers, attorneys, public defenders and prosecutors.

Preferred stock has a set liquidation value, common stock does not.  That does not mean that if the company is liquidated, that the preferred holder will actually receive the full liquidation value though.  Common stock holders share equally in the earnings of the company and may be subject to dividend increases.  Preferred share holder never receive dividend increases and they do not share in the earnings of the company. Preferred stock is more or less a very subordinate form of debt and in some cases preferred dividends are actually treated as interest payments for tax purposes instead of as dividend payments.

I don't think you'll find any employer to say they didn't hire someone because they smoke.  <br>  <br>  BUT, as a nonsmoker, I can tell you, all those smokers abandon their desks, for all those 15 minute smoke breaks.  AND, some of them even smoke in the bathroom, which is very annoying to some of us nonsmokers.  <br>  <br>  Nonsmokers tend to be more productive.   And they don't smell funny, either.  Smokers don't even REALIZE, that they smell funny, because their noses have acclimated.
4MypYVHYaa	Yes it is possible to refinance your two loans into a single mortgage loan.<br>  <br>  You should contact a local mortgage banker/broker to see if you are qualified and can get approved for such a mortgage and if your home would appraise for the amount you think.<br>  <br>  Remember that there is a cost for this refinance so once you have contacted the mortgage banker or broker make sure you go over any possible cost for the refinance.<br>  <br>  No one works for free so asking for a no fee no points loan will cost you an extra point or so that you will have to pay out over the life of the loan. <br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.<br>  <br>  'FIGHT ON"|`|yrBSkJKGaa	As a mortgage loan specialist, I would say there are a few factors.  First, it all depends on your appraisal.  Don't just go by what your neighbor's house sold for.  You would have to get a full appraisal done on your home.  Second, I think you may have difficulty getting a loan on 100% of your home's equity.  So you shouldn't count on taking out 80k if you re-fi.  But you should certainly be able to pay off the second lien.  Give Wells Fargo Home Mortgage a call!

Generally in a high IV environment and you expect IV to drop, its not wise to buy a call or put because the decrease in IV will reduce premium price. Using a credit spread is a great way to capture the falling IV. <br>  Earnings is a big factor in IV changes. The weeks leading up to earnings the IV will increase (sometimes over 50%) and then fail dramatically after the announcement. <br>  For expected IV increase, I like calendar spreads.<br>  <br>  The sites below has great IV charts.<br>  <a href="http://www.ivolatility.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ivolatility.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cboe.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cboe.com</a>

In many states, unemployed workers can apply for unemployment benefits online or over the phone. In New York, for example, can visit Unemployment Services web site to file a new unemployment claim, claim weekly benefits, or check on the status of an existing unemployment compensation claim. Filing by phone is also an option.<br>  <br>  California unemployed workers, as another example, can also file an Unemployment Insurance claim by completing an online form.

Where you want to reside will determine on how cheap the land is.<br>  <br>  I plan to move to Mississippi and have found 80 acres up to over a hundred acres for less than $100,000. So keep this in mind when you are looking for cheap land. Land in California is not so cheap.<br>  <br>  You should google cheap land in whatever state you want to buy the land in. Of course you can also google cheap land in the United States and find land sellers all over the United States.<br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.<br>  <br>  "FIGHT ON"
nmozvlGPaa	The area you live in doesn't change what you can afford.  Your race shouldn't affect how you are treated.  <br>  <br>  The rule of thumb is to not have a mortgage exceed 2x to 3x your annual income which is between $160,000 and $240,000.  Pretty wide range, so you need to delve one layer deeper.  The general guideline is to not exceed 28% of your gross monthly income on a housing payment and to not exceed 36% of your gross monthly income on all debt payments.  Since you owe nothing, the 28% limit should cap your purchase.  <br>  <br>  28% of your gross montly income is:  $1866 (does this payment 'feel' affordable to you?).  You will need a minimum downpayment of ~3.5% (for an FHA loan), but the higher the better on the downpayment.  Let's run the numbers on the high end of affordability.  $240,000 loan at 5% fixed over 30 years gives you a principal and interest payment of $1289 per month.  Add in insurance of ~$75 per month and taxes of $300 per month (assume tax rate is 1.5% of value per year - could be very high or very low) and another $125 for PMI. You are now at $1789 per month which is getting close to the upper end for you...<br>  <br>  I'd a house price of $250,000 would be pushing the envelope.  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|eZAbBCXuaa	You sound like an excellent candidate for an FHA loan. With an FHA mortgage, you can purchase a home with only 3.5% down. Based on your income, you could qualify for a house in the $250,000 range, but the payment would be significantly higher that what you're paying now. I always tell my clients to pick a payment/loan amount that will be comfortable for them, not necessarily the max that they can qualify for.<br>  Race plays no part whatsoever in the approval process.

However, if your are not paid and it is part of education, you should be able collect if the unemployment office approved it as a work training program.

Other states have similar programs.|`|tI9Eb7V2aa	I think ones you start an internship you will no longer be qualified to collect the unemployment benefites.
Gun3UGzaaa	When you trade on option, you are in effect borrowing and risking money you don't have.  That's because there are some cases with options where you can lose more than you originally bet.  For example, you short bank ABC thinking that it will fall from it's current price of $4 a share to $3 a share.  Someone contracts your short, and you agree to provide them 1,000 shares of the bank within 90 days.  If the price doesn't fall, and instead goes up to $5 a share, you have to come up with $5,000 to settle the trade and purchase the shares from the counterparty to the trade.<br>  <br>  They want to be sure you can come up with that $5,000.<br>  <br>  Most margin accounts require a minimum reserve - such as 65% of the total trade value.  So, for a $4/share initial trade, your reserve would be $2,600 for $1,000 shares.  If the price increases to $5 a share, you have to come up with an additional guarantee to bring the balance to 65% of $5,000 (or $3,2350).<br>  <br>  Spreads where you simultaneously do both puts and calls to try to limit your losses are easier to get approved, but many online brokers only recognize them as separate and riskier transactions.<br>  <br>  Go with a full service broker, such as fidelity or schwab and see if they give you a different answer.  Also, check your credit report at www.annualcreditreport.com and make sure there is nothing there that indicates you are a credit risk.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

wyAtVqbOaa	They have to do credit checks on the people whose names are on the lease, therefore, if your boyfriend and your names are on the lease, then they will have to do two checks.  If, however, only your boyfriend's name is on the lease, then they will only do one check - him.  <br>  <br>  They do this so that they can decide if you are a "payment risk" eg if you have ccj's against your name then you are more likely to withhold rent and then run.  <br>  <br>  Decide what you want to do and inform them but be warned, if you and your boyfriend separate then he has the right to refuse you entry to the flat as technically he is the only one living there.|`|d89416ed0e27a36978e0ba1cb1b5608eaa	From my previous experience, the agency would only need to run a credit check on you, obtain a previous landlord and personal reference. This will definitely not cost them ￡170. When I was 19, and living in the UK, I worked at a lettings agency, and it cost ￡10 to credit check someone - basically, you are paying their wages. Even if your partner is earning more than you, the agency will still need to check that you were a good previous tenant, you didn't wreck the place etc etc. I would challenge this if you can, as most agencies should charge a "couples" fee, say ￡150 for both of you. I would suggest consulting ARLA as well. <br>  <br>  Good luck, <br>  <br>  Riley.<br>  <br>  EDIT: See if the agency will let you on the tenancy as a Licensee. This means that your boyfriend will be liable for the entire rent, and you have no legal rights to the tenancy/property, but you will be allowed to live there without being referenced. Just a thought.|`|Hae8acnpaa	It is not really down to legal or illegal it is necessary.

I'm in the opposite situation as you.  I earn the money to pay the rent and bills so why we had to pay again for my wife (a stay at home mother) to get her references is beyond me.  It's one of those lovely money making scams that you have to go along with or you can't get the place.<br>  <br>  Partly (at least they'll claim it is) it's to make sure there'll be no criminals or illegal immigrants living in the house as well as no bankrupt or poor paying people.<br>  <br>  If your boyfriend just puts it all in his name and they find you're living there, that would probably be in breach of his tenancy agreement and he could be kicked out.|`|ebae2bb97120c05a8385c8a1fc06cefbaa	Seeing you are not employed, they could do a credit check on you, this will show any ccj's. There is really not a lot of point in them doing anything else as you are not working, and he has passed the references to rent the property alone. You would then go on the agreement as a "permitted occupier". This should cost fare less.|`|HP1pToMOaa	Sounds fair enough to me. If one of you moves out they will want to make sure the other one will pay.<br>  It's neither legal or illegal.|`|RWIuJ0Uoaa	Normally they need references from all parties that are going to be letting the apartment, if you are not sure get in touch with your letting agent and ask them.

pNy8lakjaa	You can wait for the condemned department to take over, or you can sue for harassment. Document everything, I mean everything that they do that has been insulting. They also illegally changed the locks, which is grounds for eviction too. Have they paid rent at all this month? If not, yet again breaching the lease and grounds for eviction. I would serve them a 3 days notice to get out of there. If they don't then take them to small claims and explain everything to a judge. Hopefully by getting a judgment against them will make them wake up and realize that what they are doing is inappropriate. If anything it will make it more difficult for them to get an apartment anywhere in the future.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	If the property has been condemned, the condemning authority will remove them as it's now a health and safety issue however, that could take some time.  Check with the condemning authority and ascertain their policies and law.  If they can't assist you with immediate action you'll have to take the tenant to court.  Google landlord tenant laws in your state.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor

What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that.

They also see if the buyer is qualified to purchase the property and if not then they find a mortgage professional to accomplish this and get a mortgage loan for the buyer.<br>  <br>  They then ensure that the proper services are provided for you to complete you sale by using an escrow closing agent, a local title company.<br>  <br>  Once the sale is complete what else would you want them to do for you?<br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.<br>  <br>  "FIGHT ON"|`|EIINtnIpaa	Dont Know|`|jT2Gix01aa	It depends which agent that you choose to go with.  If you are thinking about putting your property on the market, ask them.  Usually the Agent will act as the "middleman" between the  solicitors and the buyers / sellers.

EXJfoGtAaa	Whomever is servicing your mortgage has nothing to do with the lease.  Google landlord tenant laws in your state.  If the cure of a breached is not specifically mention in the lease, then it will be determined by law and/or the court.  First send them a certified letter putting them on notice they were not authorized to order the window.  If the new window hasn't been installed then immediately notify the window company to cancel the order.  Just because lease terms may have been ignored or violated in the past that doesn't grant the tenant authority to make decisions that you or both parties must make.  I suspect you will end of evicting them.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor|`|912184e16e910db90a6979b2d6ebeeb9aa	Write up a new lease. Leasing companies update leases all the time.

Explain to them they need to either a). start following the contract or face eviction or b). give them 3 weeks (written notice) to evict.

sQsl1r5Yaa	Start by reading a "golden oldie" in management, the book,<br>  In Search of Excellence, by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman.  They helped American firms deal with a crushing competitive challenge to their primacy by getting them away from strategies based on just the numbers, and re-focused on the basic drivers of all successful businesses throughout time: people, customers, values-"culture" ("the way we do things around here"), action-execution, a perpetual self-renewing entrepreneurial spirit.<br>  <br>  Management by fear is not a productive management style.  You need to learn your stuff and gain the respect of the workers by your knowledge.  Read works by noted motivators like Tom Landry and Vince Lombardi.  Never stop learning.|`|JKQKG3tQaa	Do your employees know that there is a Recession going on right now?<br>  If they won't listen to you then i would suggest replacing them with people who will<br>  <br>  You only realy have to do it to one of them and the others will fall in line

The irs did say that unless it's a big error, the will automatically fix it and send your refund through...  Good Luck to you, I've waited so long now that i'm not holding my breath, already been disapointed for weeks now as it is....|`|CwkgNO7Faa	It just means that they have received your return and that the anticipated date for DD that they gave you has passed.

ae282ad4a748f8c85406e4649235ff16aa	Quite complex as you were contracted to work 8 hours then did overtime. The overtime appears not to be contractual, but additional to your basic contract. If, by agreement, your contract was amended to allow you to work 20 hours, by mutual contract, those are your new hours. If your employer has cut your contracted hours from 20 to 8, they are in breach of contract. You could resign and then claim to have been constructively dismissed. Because your contract was varied you would be well advised to consult a specialist employment solicitor before taking any drastic action. It would be better to negotiate with your employer, if you can.

The best thing to do is put as much free money as you can towards your smallest to pay that off then take the amount that you paid towards it and roll it into your next smallest until you are out of debt.|`|yHl7RIuOaa	No. Do not borrow money on a credit card to pay the bills.  Pay them in a systematic fashion from your cash.<br>  <br>  Most of those bills you are referring to do not carry interest rates or finance charges.|`|AA12065007	Only if you can afford to pay off the credit card in full before the due date or if you have a interest free offer that will allow you to actually save money.|`|4Jy8Hioiaa	NO,NO,NO.

I don't know what your situation is but if you are desperate this may be one of only a few options. <br>  <br>  If you do to this you will pay more money due to interest but it will buy you some breathing time (Not Much). Immediately try to alter your lifestyle so that you have enough coming in to make your bills and pay off this new credit card as you can. If not you will end up in a worst situation.
qBCGH52haa	There are extremely few (almost zero) no money down mortgages anymore (for pretty obvious reasons).  However, if you can find a lender and the house qualifies, you can possibly get an FHA loan which only requires about 3 - 3.5% down (but don't forget cash for closing costs).  Figuring 6 -9 % cash (closing and down payment) puts you in the needed cash area of $4,500 ($50K max house x 9%).<br>  <br>  Having said that, a $50K house entitles you to only $5,000 first time buyers credit.  The credit is the lesser of $8,000 or 10% of the cost of the house.<br>  <br>  Some states do or did have programs to help first-time buyers into homes.  Check with your state to see if there is any money available.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	It's a hard call what w/state of the banks, country and economy altogether.  However, if after they figure out your debt to income ratio and what the mortgage will actually be, (just make sure you get a fixed rate mortgage) if it appears to be doable you probably will get one.  Pls. make sure you can afford the payments along w/insurance, utilities, food, etc.  That's why there are all those foreclosures, as people were given lower monthly payments to start and w/adustable rate mortgages, suddently the interest went up and the monthly payment ballooned so high, no one could afford it.  Ask around at different banks, look over what they come up with, if they say yes, make sure to compare figures.  You know what you have coming in and you know what expenses you have.  Remember, anything that happens in a house you own, you will have to have repaired and it also can be expensive.  Just make sure you can afford all of the necessities and the emergency things that may come along.  I wish you lots of luck in obtaining what you really want!|`|4MypYVHYaa	There are a few mortgage companies that are still doing 100% mortgages, but with such a credit score you have it might not be possible.<br>  <br>  If you are veteran you might try a VA mortgage loan for your purchase, they have a 100% mortgage loan program.  If not then you might consider a FHA mortgage loan.FHA has a mortgage loan that call for 3% down. Under both these programs the qualification might not be as stringent as a conventional mortgage loan and your credit score might be ok with these programs. <br>  <br>  When you make your offer on any possible property you might ask the seller to carry the down payment for you.<br>  <br>  Remember that doing it this way you would have to get permission of the lender that will be your first mortgage. They would have to approve a second mortgage with their mortgage loan program. <br>  <br>  Of course you can look in your local newspaper and see if there are any For Sale By Owners (FSBO) that would be willing to carry the entire mortgage for you without too much qualifying on your part.<br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.<br>  <br>  "FIGHT ON"|`|e5f04ca3c3014e50e1934956f32f941faa	Hmmm, well, an FHA loan requires at least 3%.  Conventional loans require 3%-20%.  You can look into VA loans, owner financing, lease/purchase, house trading, job-related federal programs, or state & local government programs.  It's a good time and a bad time to buy.  Better sales prices and lower interest rates, but fewer bank deals.
pVzwvoGXaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  It sound like your talking about a Temporary Event Notice (TEN), I assume these events are outside your normal licence?<br>  <br>  Should you wish to hold a special event i.e. band etc then you can apply for a TEN, this must be done at least 10 working days before the event and can last no longer than 4 days, if you are a Personal licence holder you can apply for up to 50 of these licences (although they cannot be back to back) in one calendar year.  However if you do not hold a Personal licence you can apply for up to 5 per annum.  A TEN costs around ￡20 per application.<br>  <br>  A club premises licence does not require the presence of a personal licence holder but if you plan to have a number of these events I would recommend that you put a steward through the course or someone who will be present when these events are on.<br>  <br>  A premises licence is for a premises who intends to sell alcohol by retail which would only need if you were selling to non members however there is an annual charge based on your rateable value.  You will also NEED a personally licence holder to be on the licence, if you go down this route it is recommended that you have two personal licence holder (1 as a backup)<br>  <br>  It would depend on how many events you plan to hold, a TEN is a short term or an 'every now or then' solution where a premises licence is a more permanent measure.
BjHywpaRaa	I received one of these emails within the last week and am very suspicious. Nothing about it seems legit to me - I would give this one a thumbs down.|`|MM6uZZstaa	Hey, I got the same email.  There are a few things that caught my eye.  (1) There are a few grammatical errors in the email itself.  (2) They mention "paying back any debt" That alone sounds fishy.  (3) They don't list anything about the company itself in the email.  (4) My email says its from a Dennis Lockhart, but when I look at the email the email addy says hroxey122589@aol.com, which doesn't sound like anything professional.  (5) I checked on the Better Business Bureau, and there are companies with similar but not exact names, and none of them are accredited.  ..... I'm putting this one at a thumbs down.  30-60 minutes of work per day? If it sounds too good to be true, it typically is.  Also, the websites .com is actually a .cc, which I looked up and is some crazy island off of Austrailia.  This is totally bogus.  If you ever have any questions about a company, check www.bbb.org.  They can typically tell you if it is a legit company or not, and if they aren't listed, I'd stay away.
VttT9C5Vaa	This recruiter is taking advantage of you and you need to say something to your manager about it. I would approach it maturely by saying something like, "while I am enjoying my work experience here, I feel like my responsibilities are increasing significantly and the work I am doing is above an beyond what duties are supposed to be involved with my job title, as I was originally hired for." I am ready an willing to increase my work load but there have to be some boundaries and I must have the ability to prioritize, and if that means telling so and so that I cannot help, so be it." I will gladly accept added responsibility if it comes along with a pay increase and a deserving job title." I feel for you. My title is office manager although I am more like a personal assistant / slave. You will keep getting pushed around until you stand up for yourself. I am slowly learning that after 8 years at my freakin job.|`|djSrh5iwaa	You need to speak to your Manager, but there are ways to do this. Be calm and collected and preferably write down your argument and how you want to present it before going in. If you have a trusted friend there, speak to them and run it by them first. Calmly ask for half an hour/ hour with your manager and if they ask why, tell them that you need guidance on your workload and how to approach this project. By the sounds of it, this Lead Recruiter is taking advantage of you. If your manager does not agree with you, then I would discuss the possibility of promotion etc should the project be successful and what they are looking for. Unfortunately, all those working in an administration role will have dealt with something like this at some time and it will happen again.. but stay calm and present yourself well and you should be fine.|`|9p9DDRSnaa	Write down on a sheet of paper your agenda for your typical day.  Take it in to your supervisor and have him explain the priority of everything he has you doing..example:  200 packets going out or his work...he should be able to get the bigger picture here.  I would also ask for a copy of my work description/duties.  Every company should have one of these so you know their expected work results.  If you are doing above and beyond, I would be asking for a raise or different title (that comes with more pay).  If your supervisor still tells you to deal with it, then I would make sure I have all my stuff done first before worrying about getting his work done.  If his stuff isn't done, it is his fault.  Make sure you document (or if done in email, keep the copy) as a log the communication you have with him about this - just for the record.  He would have no grounds to fire you.  If he tries to fire you over this, (you not doing his work and overloading you) then his firing would be unjustified.  Keep a log of everything just in case.

There are a lot of stocks which you can buy directly with the company or the underwriting bank. And they don't charge you commission or maintenance fee and you usually get an automatic drip (dividend reinvesment plan) if they give dividends.  The down side if you are a market timer it takes a week or so to liquidate. But if you are a buy and holder it is an excellent way to purchase stocks in big blue chip type companies.<br>  <br>  Do some research around the company's website and you usually can find where to buy direct. Sometimes they have a $250 minimum.

The estimate is that a short sale decreases your score between 150 and 200 points.  The sale stays on your record for 7 years (as is normal for negative reports).
mUdeM1Dqaa	Its very important to follow up with a call back exactly one week later. When you do call back, stress that you are very interested in the position and you are free to set up an interview at any time. Be formal and professional like you already own it.

1HLIKuTvaa	A.  <br>  <br>  Best degrees:<br>  <br>  I have 3 ideas, first...become a mechanical, electrical, or chemical engineer.  Engineers have more "plush" offices than any other group because they comprise the largest group of CEOs in the world.<br>  <br>  Second, consider financial planning...as the baby boomers retire, the largest wealth transfer in world history will begin.  You might as well get a commission off of that...  I would think the degree would either be an JD specializing in estate planning law or a CPA.<br>  <br>  Third, the majority of millionaires own and operate a business they love.  Most have degrees that taught them about a subject they love (business is common).  You may consider applying the cliche' "Do what you love and you won't work a day in your life".<br>  <br>  B.<br>  <br>  Get your degree in the field that you are passionate about.  That will likely open doors to you previously closed.<br>  <br>  C.<br>  <br>  A club that helps people overcome public speaking fears is ToastMasters.  They have helped many many successful speakers overcome their fears.|`|mUdeM1Dqaa	You didn't state what it is you do.

RNs are licensed through their state board. Not by the school. To renew your license you need to pass that state board exam again. You should be able to get the exam information from the school you graduated from. You might need to take some classes to prepare for the exam or you can try winging it. <br>  <br>  Not sure what you mean by hands on. RNs can work in doctor's offices, corporations and clinics rather than hospitals. To get less hands on than that would probably mean a job that doesn't require a licensed RN.

I'm not sure if it's an HR issue but a management issue. He's using company time for personal business. As a manager it's up to you to talk to this employee, let him or her know that they should no be using so much company time for personal calls and business.

1HLIKuTvaa	You cannot stop an employee from looking for work on their time, but you can if s/he is looking on your time.  The expectation of an employee that is being paid to accomplish their work is that they work toward the goal, not spend time on the phone, internet, etc.<br>  <br>  I would have a performance discussion with the employee, and respectfully require compliance with the rules.  If it continued, I would dismiss the employee (assuming at-will) and wish them well in their search.|`|AHCelSY1aa	Well the biggest mistake many I know have made is terminate them.  We have a few cases like that at the firm I am employed at.  However, the fact these employees are actually doing it during company time you can begin the disciplinary and warning process.  Only need to do this 3 times to CYA (cover your a**)  Make sure to document each meeting and have the employee sign off on the warning.  If the behavior continues after these warnings you can terminate them without fear of legal repercussions.  This was the huge mistake a small handful of our clients employers made. It is now he said/she said and considering some of the work conditions the former employee looks pretty believable.  This is not to say we believe them, but that's not the issue.  The question is who is more credible.  With you keeping a record of reprimands and obviously giving the employee 3 opportunities to shape up or ship out and look for another place of employment on your own time also would allow you grounds to contest any unemployment claim they may file and you will win.

IReCK2hFaa	Sounds like your broker wants you to do what's called a "mutual fund switch". Basically what this means is that you are selling a certain fund family (in this case I would guess it is Oppenheimer because many of their bond funds got in trouble with derivatives, correct me if I'm wrong). Doing this in the financial advisor world is generally shunned upon because the client will likely get hit with more fees to do the change. I would do this: <br>  <br>  Ask your broker if there is a suitable fund to do a "free exchange" to. A free exchange means that you keep your mutual fund family (Oppenheimer) and change to a mutual fund that invests in something more stable (I.E. Gov't Bonds or higher quality bonds.). This costs absolutely nothing to you, but will trigger a taxable event if it is held in a non-retirement account. <br>  <br>  Whatever you do don't transfer to the money market. If you are too aggressive you can cut down on your risk but taking money out of the market now means you just ate about a 40% loss on all stock market based funds. <br>  <br>  Also, being that you say you have a lot of money invested but you are in two funds scares me. If I were you I would consult with another advisor for a second opinion, someone who will sit down and look at your statement and see if this really makes sense. It's the reason you're asking this question in the first place.<br>  <br>  I can't believe he just now told you about how bad Oppenheimer funds ate it with derivatives. I had been telling my clients to get out of their bond funds since Feb. 2008 because they were badly underperforming their peers. <br>  <br>  My blog site may be beneficial to you. It doesn't have much content yet but my goal is to educate people like yourself but make everything as simple as possible.

Is the fund much different from the one you're in? Why does he think it will be better?<br>  <br>  Also, there are so many funds these days that to pay a fee (whether load or other) almost makes no economic sense for the investor. I'm not saying your broker or firm is guilty of this but many do put tremendous pressure on their brokers to sell, sell, sell. In today's environment, it doesn't surprise me that many are receiving similar phone calls. <br>  <br>  I would also check with morningstar (www.morningstar.com) and check the past history of the fund compared to the one you're in. It might turn out to be a good move but investors typically feel the "grass is greener" with another fund and are easily swayed into switching. It's a big money maker for brokers.<br>  <br>  Do some research (morningstar) and then make a decision based on what you feel.|`|286158035f0bdbcd6406fc818ecc200faa	Unless you have a lot of financial products in your portfolio (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, banks, mortgage companies, etc.), you're better off not to move anything.  Just sit it out and let it ride if it's performed well in the past; and if it's performing better than the Dow or OTC as a whole.<br>  <br>  I retired in October, and my firm's retirement plan financial advisor agreed with my gut feeling to just ride it out until the market recovers or I reach mandatory age 69-1/2 for withdrawing from retirement funds.  Any time you move funds or individual stocks, you're going to be paying commissions.  You really do Not want to spend more money when you're losing it.  If the stocks were in solid companies, they will bounce back.<br>  <br>  A broker Always has a conflict of interest.  He/she receives commissions for every single transaction.  If those transactions are done without the customer's permission, it's called "churning" and the broker is legally liable.<br>  <br>  My firm's advisor reviewed my two mutual funds and found very few financial products plus lots of solid companies and agreed with my assessment to sit it out and draw from my CDs for the time being.  I personally have a Fidelity OTC Index fund and a Fidelity Blue Chip Growth fund.  While both are losing money, their losses are much lower than the losses shown daily for the Dow and OTC markets.  The OTC index fund is losing less than the OTC market.<br>  <br>  If you have good companies in your portfolio and have other emergency funds to draw upon if necessary, just sit it out.  You won't be out as much as you would be with less invested - and that is what would be the end result after deduction of commissions.  If anything, you should perhaps consider buying more shares of solid companies while their stock prices are low - not divesting yourself of other previously solid companies of good repute and track record.<br>  <br>  When it comes to money, everyone looks out for himself/herself first - and that includes your broker.|`|Bf8PVFSSaa	Eat Funyuns.

tIao8lJ1aa	As part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, the federal government is offering up to a $7,500 tax credit for eligible first-time home buyers. The credit was signed into law in July 2008, and is intended to help spur a rebound in the fast-falling housing market.<br>  <br>  This plan was signed into law by Bush not Obama.<br>  <br>  The economic recovery bill signed into law by President Obama offers the $8000 tax credit and is available for qualifying home purchases made from Jan. 1, 2009, until Dec. 1, 2009.  The $8,000 is a true credit, that is, if you don't plan on moving within three years. A tax credit is much more valuable than a deduction. A credit reduces dollar for dollar the amount of tax you owe. A deduction merely reduces the amount of your income that is taxable.<br>  <br>  I didnt appreciate "MY MONEY" being used to kill innocent civilians in far off lands but we dont get to pick and choose how our tax dollars are used.

Absurd?  Yeah, I agree too.<br>  I had heard rumors that the $7500 repayment obligation would be forgiven... but for now, it's not true.<br>  I have already contacted my congressmen to get clarification on this issue once and for all, and I am awaiting response.

nmozvlGPaa	You need to know your interest rate to figure out your exact payment.  Saying credit report is fine doesn't give us enough insight to predict an interest rate.  Let's say your credit is outstanding > 750 and you qualify for the lowest rate because your DTI (debt-to-income) ratios are conservative and you are putting more than 20% down.  <br>  <br>  Assume you get an interest rate of 5% on a 30 year fixed rate loan.  Any amortization calculator will tell you that your principal and interest payment are $939.44 per month.  Taxes of 5k/yr mean another $416.66 per month (taxes are a full third of the payment - getting kinda high).  Homeowner's insurance is quite variable, depending on where the house is.  On a coast and insurance will be over $2000 a year.  Let's assume you aren't right on a coast and that your insurance will be $600/yr or another $50 per month.  You have no PMI because you put down a high enough down payment.  Your total is now $1406.11 per month.<br>  <br>  The guideline is to not exceed 28% of your GROSS monthly income on a housing payment, so that would mean your gross monthly income would have to be at least $5021.81 or a yearly gross of $60262.  This figure would be an absolute minimum.  <br>  <br>  You might still be able to find a lender who is a little more liberal than 28/36 (I think even the FHA guideline is 31/36 or 31/38), but I wouldn't go so high.  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|ZCrIKWlQaa	They say your monthly payment should be between 28-33% of your net monthly income, so $175,000 for a 30 year mortgage would mean you should earn between $55,000-$65,000 after taxes.<br>  <br>  The link below is a mortgage calculator.|`|uRqlSq6caa	Your mortgage payments shouldn't be more than 30% of your net income (take home pay).  If you go more than 30% you will have a hard time keeping up with lifestyle and save.<br>  <br>  Hard to calculate without knowing what your interest rate would be, you'll have to get a quote, because your rate will be based on your credit report.  If you have over 700 you'll get some of the better rates.  <br>  <br>  Another part of your mortgage payment is your insurance.  Though this is a small portion of your payment it helps to know.  It'll be around $20-30 a month.

75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	while i heartly agree with the sentiment, i don't think we can in many cases.<br>  clearly the original seller should not be at fault.<br>  the bank and appraiser said that's what the property was worth, and the bank, as the offerer of the loan, bought it at that price.<br>  however, there were thousands of "loan originators" that are now all gone.<br>  they were the problem.<br>  they, and the regulating agency that allowed them to run their business.<br>  <br>  if i was the seller of that house, it's likely that either (A) i'm a construction company, and built houses because people were buying, or (B) homeowner, who has bought another house, and likely cannot afford 2 houses at this point.  in fact, i've probably lost money on the house that i bought.  (ie, i've taken a loss, but on a different house.)<br>  <br>  in general, i think that the loan originator should be held responsible.<br>  unfortunately, i think that half of 'em are gone.<br>  and the half that are still around may not be able to absorb the loss.<br>  the question then becomes, "What's best for the country?"<br>  and the answer probably is that banks should be allowed to stay in business.<br>  "Should the stock holders pay?"<br>  a fair question, and i don't know.<br>  part of me says yes, for major stock holders.<br>  part of me says no, for employees, who had nothing to do with the problem, and that stock is most of their 401k savings.<br>  <br>  in truth it's the world's biggest burning blivet, and we only get to decide who gets to stamp it out.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	You may be forgetting that many of the "original vendors" are out of business. The lenders mostly are. And if you mean an individual who sold a property 2 or 3 years ago...you now want to force them to buy back the property...that's a non-starter. First, they probably used the money to buy something else. They wouldn't qualify to "repurchase" the property they sold a couple of years ago.<br>  <br>  Second, what would they do with the properties?<br>  <br>  On top of that, of course, what you're proposing is illegal. It violates all sorts of contract law. <br>  <br>  Finally, you refer to "real estate speculators." Quick scenario: Mr. A bought a house in 1990 for $100,000. He had a 30-year fully amortized mortgage at 7%, and he made all the payments on time. In 2006, with all the run-up in prices, he decides to sell. He puts it on the market for $400,000, and within a day receives multiple offers. He accepts one at $425,000.<br>  <br>  The person who bought, Mr. B, did a no-doc loan, misrepresenting his income. He used 100% financing, and in fact received $15,000 back at settlement. Mr. B planned on riding the appreciation wave for a few months, then selling at a profit. He knew that he really couldn't afford the property, but he'd sell quick enough.<br>  <br>  Except, of course, Mr. B bought at the top of the market. Prices declined. He couldn't sell. And it was foreclosed upon.<br>  <br>  Now, who's the speculator? Mr. A, who told the truth about his income, who owned the property for 16 years, who always paid on time? Or Mr. B, who lied about his income, who only planned on owning the property for 6 months, and never made a mortgage payment? You tell me: Who is the speculator?<br>  <br>  And now you want Mr. A to repurchase the property from the lender who foreclosed for $400,000? I don't think so.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Good thought, but it won't happen.  It's a combination of irresponsbile lending policies (no doc loans) and greeding speculators.  What would be helpful if was a way to seperate the speculators from investors.  True investors weren't getting on the band wagon to flip their purchase in a month or two.  They were buying for long term appreciation, but they're now underwater.  True investors need help too.

Most companies will reimburse you the pro-rated amount of your premium which has not been used upon cancellation.<br>  <br>  IE:  If you paid $300 for a period of 6 months and you cancel 2 months into the period, then they should reimburse you $200.<br>  <br>  Just make sure to get the new policy before you cancel the old one otherwise your new insurance company will charge you a higher rate for being "uninsured" at the time the contract was signed. <br>  <br>  Also, watch out for "hidden" fees... sometimes insurance companies low-ball their quotes to get you to sign with them only to find your payment to be much higher once you are a customer.  Here's some common tricks they use:<br>  <br>  -"Finance Fee" if you want to pay month-to-month instead of a lump-sum for the year.  Everyone expects to make payments, but a lot of the quotes are based on paying in full up front.  Many companies add on as much as 20% if you want to pay monthly.<br>  <br>  -Fee for paper billing.  Many companies want you to setup automatic payment plans.  Electronic payments reduce their overhead sicne they don't need actual people to open letters, take checks to the bank for deposit, etc, etc.  Many of the insurance quotes are based on an electronic payment plan.

I1VivZxfaa	ToS is the platform of choice for options (in my opinion at least).  Commissions will be greater than others, but I like their platform.  I honestly do not know the commissions off hand, but I seem to remember 2 choices : 1. fixed pricing and 2. variable pricing.  Option 1 is better if you have larger volumes.  In any case the pricing is on their website.<br>  <br>  The reason why you need approval is because in order to enter into vertical positions, one of your legs is a naked write of a call or put.  Thus, in theory, you are exposed with unlimited risk if you don't pair that leg.  <br>  <br>  Since there are so many strategies related to option spreads, no broker will check to see if your option spreads are paired correctly to limit your risk. The only thing they can do is calculate your exposure and estimate the risk as well as give you pre-approval.<br>  <br>  In order to get approval you need to have a number of years of stock trading and I assume basic options trading experience.<br>  <br>  Wish You Luck.<br>  <br>  ps.

7RpTaV7Xaa	Ok look simply put........ you design and put together a working site on your pc ..... but now the only person who can see it is you unless you turn your computer into a server and leave it connected to the web 24/7 (whole other story) so now how do you allow for people to access the site you have made 24/7 without leaving your pc on? simple.<br>  <br>  you use a web hosting service, a company that has dedicated serveres that you can put your site on allowing people access to your page via a url address (i.e www.yoursite.com).... now i suggest trying out a free web hosting service by visiting a registering (best one i have found is freezoka.com)<br>  <br>  you can upload and manage your site (and its many files) via the web-hosting sites ftp panel (ftp = file transfer panel) <br>  <br>  now with the free hosting site you are safe, but although it is completely free and YOU CAN choose your domain name you will get an extension to your url (example = www.yoursite.freezoka.com) and a very small link will be placed at the bottom of your site.<br>  <br>  or you could pay every month and get a straight www.yoursite.com url..... as for advertising, that is on your shoulders to find people that wanna advertise on your site and its your job to work their banners and ads into your site (people tend to advertise on your site if you can prove your site gets alot of traffic)<br>  <br>  finally no server is hack proof but because the server is external to your pc your files at home are completely safe if your site gets attacked, so as long as you back up your site as you update it you are fine....... feel free to ask me more specific questions, hope this helps.|`|RjS66IIFaa	When you build a website, it cannot live on your computer because you want people to visit it.<br>  <br>  A web hosting service is just a server that is on all the time where you can transfer [upload] your site to so people can access it.<br>  <br>  You still have full control of the content of your site.

What were you doing before you started this job (from 6th April last, the start of the tax year) and what code number was previously used?<br>  If your code number has increased, you will get a refund.

3tuwWidiaa	First, I'm a bit surprised that you've already received an audit notice for a 2008 filing.  However, given that you have received an audit notice, you should definitely go back to your preparer and ask for audit support.<br>  <br>  Some things to note.  First, you are responsible for reviewing what your preparer prepared before signing it.  The IRS will not have sympathy for a situation where you failed to review your return before signing it.<br>  <br>  However, the preparer has also signed the return, and therefore bears some seriously liability.  As a professional, he can get in significant trouble for this.<br>  <br>  If your preparer didn't sign the review as such, then you've got a problem.  Not only did you fail to read and understand your own return, but you took on full responsibility for it by not having the preparing sign it.<br>  <br>  In any case, as to your question: if you were married at the end of the year, you need to both file as married.  As for the kids: if you were responsible for them all year, then they at least need to show up on your return -- regardless of the single/married status.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing you have a dishonest preparer that was trying to help you by optimizing the return to your benefit.  In doing so, they put you in jeopardy.  I'd suggest that, if the preparer does not work for a company (in which case you need to immediately speak to a supervisor), that you contact a lawyer.  The IRS will most likely just make you redo the returns, plus pay some penalties.  However, in extreme cases, you could be charged with fraud and, because you had a preparer, conspiracy.  This is HIGHLY doubtful, but do you want to take any chances?|`|FncktQ4gaa	That depends on who has the right to claim them. If you are being audited then bring proof of your ability to claim them and the person who did your taxes if someone else did them and you paid him then you will only be responsible for any difference it taxes.

Also, The property is usually assessed  as of January 1st each year. When you closed in August the closing agent had to use the assessment for the prior year and based on today's market the $90k was probably correct. Trust me, buying a house and buying discounted jeans is not at all alike. If the appraiser that looked over your new house feels that it is at market value for this current economy than that is what you will pay taxes on. In california if the house is assessed above market value you can get a temporary reduction that will show your assessed value lower until market prices go back up and then your home will be put back to market value. (check with your county/city and see if they have something like this.) If you feel that they apraised you over market value, call and talk to the appraiser that assessed your home and ask him these questions. I hope this was helpful.

If the tenant is month to month it shouldn't be a problem, but if they're on a annual lease there could be some other issues to address.  If it's determined the lease is illegal due to the zoning, you will have to ascertain if the tenant was aware or did the tenant enter into the lease unaware of the zoning.  Google landlord tenant laws in your state.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor

If you do qualify, medicaid could cover most, if not all your medications and doctor visits as long as you use drugs (usually generic) that are in the formulary and doctors that accept medicaid.<br>  <br>  If you do not qualify for medicaid, county health clinics and hospitals will provide care on a sliding fee scale based on your income.<br>  <br>  What about the hospital bill? Did you ask about that? You need to contact the hospital and other providers to see about financial assistance.|`|FDBfro7Zaa	in my state we can go to our hospital and go to the financing department or in some cases the billing department and if you are under the income guidelines you can fill out a appliction for assistance with medical bills and prescriptions.

This provision will stand for the 2009 credit as well. <br>  <br>  I realize you are not trying to abuse the system but you have to understand why that provision is in place. If they did not have that exception, then families everywhere would start selling houses from parent to child or from brother to sister on paper so they could claim the tax credits. <br>  <br>  You should consider buying a different home instead of this one from your parents. Although, if you buy from your parents you can probably save at least $8,000 on closing costs and real estate agent fees so it might be just as good to forget the tax credit and proceed with the purchase.

They are even a few gov ones where Uncle Sam pays your interest while you are still in school but qualifying for them is based on income (look up "subsidized").  Most any others will accrue interest that becomes tacked onto the base amount just before you start paying (typ 6mos after grad).  To get 12k in a single year you may need to apply to several options, I think all of them will allow you to decline before it is actually disbursed, but definitely check that before you apply.  But that way you can apply to several, and based on what gets approved, keep the best ones and decline what you don't need.  Can't hurt to try for a few scholarships too while your at it.

AA11966821	No.  That's your right.  You do not have to have students, interns, etc, examine you, take your medical history, etc.  If you made an appt with Dr. X, see Dr X.  Many people do not want to discuss personal medical issues with someone other than their doctor.<br>  <br>  Thank you for being polite.  Students have to learn, and it's not their fault, they did nothing wrong.  You just wanted to talk to your doc & that's OK.|`|6fiYhtACaa	No, that is absolutley your right. However, usually they'll introduce themselves and let you know that the doctor will be in shortly. They are not there to augment or replace the doctor but to gain medical experience. If you're short on time or are very modest I would probably do the same thing, but really letting them evaluate you helps them to become better doctors. And who knows - with fresh minds maybe they'll consider something the doctor didn't. For that reason alone, I always let the students and training docs in as well.|`|eyrCiP1Daa	look u are not wrong for your choice u have that right to accept it or not but what u could have done was tell the doctor u wanted to see him and ask him questions but it would be okay for the interns to accompany him w/your appt. think about this those interns are there to learn and become great professionals just like the dr. x u wanted to see, it is best for interns to learn first hand w/ or w/out the professionals. u may have just felt comfortable w/the dr u knew but what would u have done if dr x was out?|`|lP2qYUIpaa	It's ALWAYS your right to see a doctor.  After all, it's your health, your body, and your money.  I had a friend who got an epidural from a resident at the hospital and he had to try 3 times to get it right.  You can better bet that the next time she went in to have a baby, she made sure that a doctor put in her epidural.  If you aren't comfortable with it, don't wait until they make a mistake before you ask to see Dr. X instead of his interns.
coXB7vf1aa	I don't mean to be harsh, but there's not enough content in your blog for the search engines to index.  <br>  <br>  Now, as for your main website, which has a lot of content, I recommend you submit your website to DMOZ.  It will take about 3 weeks to index on Google unless you upgrade to a paid service. <br>  <br>  You can also submit your site to 300subs.com which is a reputable site submitter to 300 directories (like a big internet phone book) across the net if you're willing to pay $250.  You'll get targeted traffic, but it can also take a few weeks.  It's still not a guarantee that all of the directories will accept your stuff. <br>  <br>  Be careful of submitting to just any old submitter site.  Some offer junk, untargeted traffic, and you'll be wasting your money.<br>  <br>  You can go on to You Tube, which is very effective, and talk about your website.  If you own a PC, download the screen capture program called Camtasia Studio.  It's free for about 30 days.  People use it to do video demos of a site or a demonstrate a skill.  <br>  <br>  So you can explain what your site is for, demo how to submit an ad to your site, what it can do for the customer, etc.  Record all that and upload it on You Tube to your channel.  Use tags to attract people to view your channel.  That's a free way of gaining traffic.  <br>  <br>  With your blog, since it's Wordpress, you may want to upload a nice template so it doesn't look so raw.  Give it a little bit of a professional look. The blog should really just be updates on what's going on with your site in particular, not just random information like "Today's topic is website traffic."  That doesn't really do your visitor a lot of good. <br>  <br>  If your updates are like, "I changed the look of my site  based on inputs from you guys about it being too hard to navigate.  So leave comments and tell me how you like the new look and feel of the site."  Then that's okay, even though it's a small post, because it leaves information for your visitors, and you're engaging in an interactive relationship with your customers.  <br>  <br>  Don't get so caught up in the traffic stuff and the SEO and the PPC and the this's and the that's of marketing and forget the main purpose of your website to begin with.  Serve your customers first.  Getting traffic to your site comes second. It's simply a matter of implementing various techniques.  Nothing more.|`|nu65nyxEaa	Honestly, there is not one answer to that question. Theres a ton of things you can do to get traffic to your blog. There are also 2 routes you can take, free, or paid.

Just kidding. But really they make very little for the type of work they do. I did it in the late 90s while going to nursing school and made a little over $7.00/hr.

I did that for a while and it was nothing but hoisting many obese old people in and out of bed and off the toilet all day. It was like digging trenches. Hospital work is more technical and while there is still heavy lifting involved, not nearly to the degree as a nursing home. Go ahead and try it, just be prepared to work very hard.

However, the collection agency credit check may also be used by an agency to get an idea of your current financial situation.<br>  <br>  If you haven't paid a debt because you claim that you have no money, the agency may check to see if you have established new accounts and whether or not you have paid these debts.

Why not be grateful that he didn't cut you completely and that you still have your base pay.|`|4627db3161084bce021d06067966d9f0aa	unless you have a signed employment contract, then the only legal thing you can do is quit.  Without a contract, and most of us don't have one, you are at the mercy of the employer, as long as they don't ask you to do something illegal.|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	Not sure what DeeDee is on if you don't have a contract of employment then your employer is already in breach of the law as you must be provided with the basic details of your employment in writing within 30 days of starting employment, this includes your hours of work. I suspect you will find a term along the lines of 'the business operates 24 hours a day and you will be required to work according to the needs of the business having being given x days notice' If however you were employed specifically to work only nights and your contract states this then your employer cannot change your hours without consulting you.You however need to think carefully why your hours have been changed, many businesses are struggling at the moment and if you could find yourself redundant if they no longer require night staff and you refuse this alternative offer.|`|HP1pToMOaa	If in the UK you could phone ACAS, but in todays economic climate employers are doing anything they can to keep in business.<br>  Have a look in your contract, but it will most probably say anything can be changed due to needs of the business.|`|dee0a38a3e3de19888ff6398150a975faa	Sadly, the employer can pretty much do whatever he wants unless it's illegal.  Union representation or a contract between the employee and employer is about the only protection you have.  Sorry.

Once the leave has been granted or the employee provides approval notice, the employer cannot alter the leave.<br>  <br>  good luck
4ZNl4V3Oaa	If that was your only income for the whole year then there is no need to file.  However if you are already required to file then you MUST include this income on your tax return.  <br>  <br>  If you still don't have your W-2 for it, contact the employer and make sure that they have your current mailing address and ask them to send a duplicate copy.  If they don't or won't comply, call the IRS at 1-800-TAX-1040 and file a formal missing W-2 complaint.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	Yes, you should get a W-2 for it.

4ZNl4V3Oaa	Obviously the State was not included in the 2004 audits.  Had it been that door would now be closed.<br>  <br>  CA generally has 4 years to audit you unless there is a significant misstatement of income or expenses (20% or more) in which case they can go back 7 years.  If they suspect fraud there's no SOL at all.<br>  <br>  The only thing that you can do is review your records and returns from 2004 and compare that to the proposed assessment.  If they are correct, just pay the assessment.  If they are not, you'll have to decide if the cost of fighting it is less than the cost of just paying it to make it go away.  Also bear in mind that if you fight it they can continue to dig into that year but if you agree and pay the assessment then that door closes for good.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	If IRS audits you they will provide the state with a copy of the audit report.  The state can take all the time it wants to piggyback on the feds.
vXFpzKRaaa	I did a lot of electrical work while I was in the military and I have little to no experience with plumbing but I've seen the guys on my ship work on the plumbing and my advice is this.  Electricians won't have to get too dirty but as a plumber, you will get much dirtier.  Also I personally think an electrician will have more work since you can rewire or troubleshoot a lot more things since almost everything now has some sort of electrical wiring.  Even if you don't have a diagram of the item you're trying to fix, you'll at least no how to fix the little things and know what is beyond you.  I personally would go for the electrical program.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Go to salary.com.  Enter job and zip code.  It will give you the average salary for the job in your area.|`|SaCMyfHPaa	I am a plumber.  Steven T was right electricians have a much cleaner job than plumbers but my suggestion is to do what i did.  Find a good local contractor who doesn'tt do much sub work.  You will be able to explore all the trades.  Personally i found that there are some things I justdon'tt care for.  Do it for a year and that should help you make up your mind.  Maybe you will find that youdon'tt want to be in the trades at all or you may find concrete to be your calling.  Good luck

X6rFPI2laa	Student loans are generally not dischargeable, and each request is considered by the bankruptcy judge.  Should a debtor be totally and permanently disabled and have no reasonable expectation of earning income for the remainder of the debtor's life, that might be discharged --- unless the judge found an expectation of inheritance, etc.  (and believe me, they will investigate!)  Terminal illness may also be considered to constitute undue hardship.  Mere poverty, other obligations, and inconvenience are not considered undue hardship in bankruptcy court when tax dollars are up for discharge.  It's really tough to meet!  Your attorney can give you advice on this issue, and will be able to research the cases for any applicable precedents.  I trust you have an attorney.  If not, you need one!  (If a bankfuptcy is filed and then thrown out, which can happen by errors and omissions in the filing as well as anything the court considers fraud, all discharged obligations are immediately in full force, and the debtor is barred from re-filing for bankruptcy for quite some time.)|`|BZMPax7Naa	Typically you can't declare bankruptcy on student loans but as for declaring it undue hardship that is for the Judge to decide.|`|mwkfirjRaa	Mary has the best answer; however, it applies to federal student loans.

ujAzSfCzaa	We don't know enough details about Citi's plan, and more importantly, we don't know what details the government will adopt.  However, it shouldn't dilute your value because Citi isn't giving up equity.  Instead the citi is recommending the transfer of preferred capital to common stock capital.  <br>  <br>  In essence it is worse for the government than the citibank stockholder, and here is why:  Now the government gets paid 5 percent on the $45 billion they have purchased in preferred stock, even if Citi loses money, which they have done for almost two years.  <br>  <br>  After the plan, Citi won't have to pay the government any preferred premiums.  The government would get premiums paid equal to the other stockholders. <br>  <br>  There is some talk that the government would receive only about $16-20 billion in common stock for the $45 billion spent.  That would prevent any dilution.

Btw get shampoo for normal hair and add rosemary essence, shampoo every other day like the other answer said.<br>  <br>  On the maths, your best bet is to ask to take the Key skills maths exams - school will offer this for someone who is really poor at maths and at least you will have something.

EBqFpZbjaa	The plain truth is that the market will charge what the people will pay.  Thus, while some traders will cut their prices by anything upt 70% others will not.  All any of us can do in these lean and hard times, is shop around.<br>  <br>  I'v noticed that my local Sainsbury supermarket is still charging sky high prices for fruit and vegetables, of which there is always a worldwide abundance and waste.  So, I now buy all the fruit and veg at my local street market where prices are often less than half the price of Sainsbury's.  Got 15 bananas today for ￡1, cannot argue with that.  Only problem is we're now eating bananas for the next few days. Likewise mushrooms, got a whole basket of these for ￡1 - so it's mushrooms with everything until they're gone.  There's only the two of us but you can see that the above would be ideal for a family of 4 or more.<br>  <br>  Shop around and don't accept the first offer.<br>  <br>  Second car dealers are just a bunch of crooks.  What they mostly do is make everything look shiny and new, they even paint the tyres to look good.  Just check everything out first before you buy.  If you want, you can join the AA or RAC and they will check out a car for you for a small fee.  Believe me they will find something wrong if it's wrong.<br>  <br>  Good luck. . .one final, this crash may last for quite a long time, so take full advantage of anything which you think might pull you a profit.

cTA9kWWfaa	The purpose of 401(K)'s are to defer taxes till your low income earning years, aka retirement. It would hurt you to transfer it into an account that will take out taxes or penalize you  in one lump sum. I am helping Circuit City Employees transfer their 401(k) and pensions into IRA's that are tax deferred just like they were when employed. Let me know if you need help rolling/transferring it over. We have accounts with guaranteed rates that you will earn over a specified number of years followed by a minimum floor which will consistently earn you money unlike these others which can lose you a big chunk of change. Not to mention the withdrawl option that allows you to remove 10% or the gain each year. Just remember this. Every year you wait to save money for retirement, costs you. Ex. saving 3,000 a year now can get you the same place 10,000 a year 7 years from now will. I would STRONGLY suggest holding off dipping into retirement accounts, I have met far too many people with nothing at retirement looking for miracles. As for starting the process, you can shubmit all the paperwork to transfer, but the funds will just not be received untill the new company gets that letter. It usually takes 3 weeks to finalize so it most likely wont delay the process any how.<br>  <br>  P.S. Look into the paperwork, many companies give you a window to transfer your money, after that you may receive a check whether you want it or not.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	you could just roll it directly to an IRA - no taxes or penalties to do that, but you will have easier access to it (at the cost of taxes and penalty) if you really, really need the money|`|0yqQg9CXaa	This is what I would do.<br>  I would call Charles Schwab or Fidelity Investments.<br>  I would do a free IRA roolover.<br>  They will do all teh work for you and tell you what to do.<br>  <br>  IF in the future you need the money,<br>  you can close the rollover account with the same penalties as closing the IRA.<br>  If you close the IRA (whether 401K or rollover), make sure to keep extra money for tax time - you will be charged up to 40% in penalties.<br>  <br>  If you are in a company that is in financial trouble and could go bankrupt,<br>  you do not want to keep your 401K money with them.<br>  /

30t2TL52aa	A - ROA<br>  Total investment implies a "total cost of capital" approach that brings financing decisions into the equation.  For example, leveraging the balance sheet through increased debt may increase the ROE (or decrease it even more if operating at a loss), effectively leveraging risk.  ROA addresses how well the assets purchased are yielding profit, regardless of how their purchase was financed.  In calculating total cost of capital, each item on the balance sheet has an implicit cost of capital either directly stated or implied in alternatives for the item.

ODGWM7vUaa	You as a tenant have several rights. Your rights also depend on were you live.<br>  <br>  You cannot be evicted without a proper eviction notice raging from 30-90 days. And since foreclosure procedures could take a long time you could potentially be able to stay in the property for 6-12 months.<br>  <br>  In some counties you may be entitled to receive compensation in order to move out. For example in Los Angeles a bank foreclosing on a property is required to pay tenants to move out.(usually two months rent)<br>  <br>  There is a down side of your situation. You might be renting a home your landlords might be claiming as their primary residence. If this is the case the bank could give all the adequate eviction notices to your landlords without you even knowing.<br>  <br>  To protect yourself collect all your paperwork such as your Lease and learn your rights in your county. AND consult with a lawyer in your city.<br>  <br>  Remember as a potential renter you have a position to haggle for a better price if you do eventually move out.|`|VpjQpAOYaa	When ownership changed hands from the previous owner (your landlord) to the lender, your lease terminated.  Basically, you have no tenant rights.

Technically, you signed the contract agreeing to their repayment terms, so if you paid  late you are liable for any fees that incurred. They don't have to tell you, it's in the fine print.

Its not an actual credit report check till you submit the application, it just takes a glance and sees that you have some qualifications to hold a credit card but that doesnt taken into account your DTI (debt to income ratio) credit score or history.  <br>  <br>  Now when you submit the application your score is not affected until a decision is made. If you are approved it does not hurt your score at all, however, if you are declined it takes 5 points off your credit score.<br>  <br>  Now the score probably wont be changed till next month because the credit bureaus only update once every 30 days.
