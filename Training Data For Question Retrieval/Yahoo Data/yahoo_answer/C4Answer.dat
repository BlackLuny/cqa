i0vcEyJtaa	Yes. If we used diplomacy to avoid a nuclear confrontation with the Soviets, what makes the US government think we can't with "terrorists"? We just need to listen closely, what motivates them to attack us. So far, the CIA stated this resulted in foreign military intervention of the 80s. It's time to change foreign polcy before we jeopardize our people, and national security.|`|e19ukSO0aa	It won't hurt to talk.

Iran and Hamas do not want to compromise in anyway. Their governments want Islam to take over the world. They want the destruction of an entire country. These aren't random statements - they're leaders preach this.    And even if let's say somehow Iranian leaders decide they want peace and to all of a sudden be freindly and work everything out - their people have such hate and venom against the US  - that it won't make a difference. They were raised on this since children. They won't change all of a sudden because Obama had applie pie with Ahmadinejad.|`|5ZfcMc34aa	Half of Hamas is calling for a truce, while the head dude vacations in Iran and the rest is still firing rockets.    I don't think that talking would help.|`|E1gKL2fSaa	But first you have to apologize to Iran for western oppression over the last 60 years.    That's what they wanted, after Obama said let's talk.|`|6JXrlnYsaa	I agree.  I've always believed that talking is highly underestimated and underutilized.    LISTENING is even more so.    Perhaps we should start with listening.  That's one reason why other countries are so angry with the US.  We spend way too much time talking and not enough time listening.    That's one of the reasons Obama gave his first TV interview to Al-Arabiya.|`|AA10542692	Sure, it's the democratic way isn't it?

Hamas exists solely for the purpose of destroying Israel.  To talk with them would have the same result as talking to a brick wall.  Iran and Syria both have ignored the UN and other countries in their attempts to make peace with them.  To talk with them would not only be a waste of time but would be considered a sign of weakness on our part by them.|`|RnLbJpvTaa	seriously i cant believe theres people who still think bombs first questions never is working. talks is the only option. what does it matter if peace talks are held. if they fail at least theres the moral high ground of saying we tried|`|eIhD4y8Waa	Avoid all foreign entanglements.|`|3vjgBDu4aa	Bush's problem he would never talk to anyone. Diplomacy always should be the 1st tactic to use, Fighting has proved nothing after 8 years in Afghanistan, the Taliban control 70% of that country.    After 6 years in Iraq ,we the greatest military power in the world have been unable to defeat, a guerrilla militia.    Israel attacked a basically unarmed country and besides bombing the country completely failed to secure their announced goal of stopping the rocket attacks or to gain the release of their captured soldier!    The US government, replaced the government of Iran, and put in the dictator ,the Shah of Iran, he was overthrown and The Islamic Republic replaced him.    Israel created Hamas, to counter the Palestinian authority and its leader Mr Arafat.    Hamas son of Israel.  https://israel.indymedia.org/newswire/di...

It is impossible to rise in power without some political blood on your hands. Chicago/Illinois has the most historically corrupt political system in the US.     So No i think there is something not right with him. I not entirely sure on who he actually his. Whether he is a Liberal leaning some to the middle to get the support of the people, or a Moderate leaning to the left to gain political support.

My favorite definition of a "Conservative" is that they follow yesteryear's "Liberals." Similar wise, a "liberal" is yesteryear's "conservative."

D81XrnY9aa	Yes, you will be eligible for the GI Bill Kicker and your Active Duty GI Bill at the same time once you are in traditional(part-time) status in the ANG. You will also get tuition assistance from the State you join in as well as monthly drill pay and the ability to pull your AT days whenever you want(summer when no college is going on). It is awesome when you can combine AD and ANG benefits and go to school without another job. It was a good 4 years at college doing this and graduating with zero loans to my name was nice as well.  You can also go into IRR once you AD commitment is up instead of palace chace and get a $15,000 bonus as well for joining the ANG as prior-service. Then you are good to go for college. Good luck. Email for more ANG info, glad to help.
KMASS2Gmaa	Does your town have the radar trailers that show oncoming traffic how fast they are going. My town does and the radar units check number of speeders/day and when high numbers are so a legal radar trap can be set. Ask for police to put one on this street. Also ask your Dad to call local DA's office for paperwork to file on city if nothing is done. A complaint of criminal neglect for the town council is a last resort way to get something done. Usually the question being asked of DA will get politicos off fundamentals.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Unfortunately, yes, you could be held responsible if there was crash because of something you did.      I would get together with my neighbors.  Do they have children? These idiots racing is going to end badly one of these days.  Someone is going to get hurt or killed.  The cops and city gov't may not listen to you but they will listen to a whole neighborhood.  Insist that they do something. Put cops in this area to catch these guys.  A strong police presence is needed.  The city will absolutely love it because it will raise revenue with all the speeding tickets.      Get together with your neighbors and keep pushing until they do something.|`|QONFn7vXaa	To answer your question, yes you could get charged with something if your actions caused them to wreck.  At least Civilly you could be held responsible.  So other things you can do are...  Video tape them, if you have a camera and then show it to the police with the License plates of the cars.  You could just pretend your video-taping the dog.   The other option is talk to the local PD, in my town if I can ID the driver and the car (license plate) then the PD will help me serve them with a Citation. I have to sign it, because I'm the one that witness the crime. So I also have to be willing to go to court and explain it to the Judge, it's really not as hard as it sounds.  Third Option, if it's the same time a day then ask the PD for extra patrol in your neighbor hood around 7pm (or whatever time) good chance that the PD can catch them their-selves.  Hope this helps, I know that bratty teens can be quite frustrating.|`|E8dtScq9aa	The best thing to do is ask an attorney. http://www.prepaidlegal.com/hub/jasondic... has a great way to get to talk to one.

His wife was a Lobbyist for years while he was IN Congress and she has all kinds of rules to comply with.     This was not overlooked in my opinion, it was ignored and then excused when he got caught.     Watch how the Democrats support him while they put Tom Delay on public trial without any evidence, and forced him out of Congress.

I would do like one thousand crunches through out the day but I would look online on ways to spruce up my work outs. I cut soda out of my diet COMPLETELY. If I ever had a crave for chocolate, I would eat carrots. No matter what do some sort of work out. We had the best work out ever in soccer.  Sunday-Off  Monday- 10 100 yard sprints  Tuesday- Run a mile  Wednesday- Lungs, stretching, basically working on your legs. A nice idea is to get leg weights and do super mans with them on. (Lay on your stomach, life your legs and arms ups,  no other part of your body can touch the ground.)  Thursday- Run a mile  Friday- Upper arms get five or ten pound weights and do various things with them. One thing you could do is get one ten pound weight and hold it in front of you, arms straight, both arms holding the weight, and hold it for thirty seconds. Promise you, it will tone your body.

SO MANY CALORIES   2 become concious of your eating habits, write everything you eat down in a journal for a week, try planning meals far ahead of time so you will not have to settle for food that is not good for you   3 start an exercise plan. Start out by walking a few miles a day and gradually increase to jogging and running, also, doing push ups and lifting weights will help to define your arms, do the push ups on your knees if you have to, it will still help. do some crunches or leg lifts for your stomach. you should walk every day if you can and do the push ups and sit ups like every other day or so. just make sure you stretch everything out before and after.    4 don't eat after like 7 at night, your body is not as active at night because of sleep, obviously, so it wont be able to burn the calories it needs to from the food you ate so near to bed time.    5 DO NOT STARVE YOURSELF.

However he is trying to decriminalize marijuana which is a positive step in the misguided "war on drugs."|`|QP7VyPV6aa	http://www.CopsSayLegalizeDrugs.com     that is an interesting, set of views on why drugs should not be illegal.      i have heard many rumors about obama legalizing pot.  i am not certain that he will, but if it could be done i htink no w would be the time.  he is the leader of the democrat controlled government.  i also think of any president he would be most likely. just because he has admitted to his own drugs use.  i also thought Clinton may have been likely. but he didnt inhale. so i guess "technically" he never did drugs. (sarcasm)    i also think that obama is a little more open minded and will be consider more of a man of the times than other presidents.    no offense, but it hink right now he has a lot of other things to consider, like how to salvage our economy, maybe how to get home soldiers from war, and maybe healthcare crisis. so i get the feeling it isnt going to be one of the things he attemps in his first hundred days.    sorry man|`|uiiodqtuaa	Turning over a law that has been in place for so long will be difficult. You can't simply walk outside as a president and say "I president  Declare marijuana legal" It's not that simple. There are too many americans who think Drugs are Bad, and should be destroyed.     Sure maybe Obama Wants it legal, That simply means he will Approve any bills sent his way involving it's legalization. although chances are Marijuana wont be legal anytime in the near future.|`|Qdvme9VYaa	I don't think so.

jHUAfrojaa	It all depends on if you have graduated high school already and when the next available time for you to go is. My boyfriend wanted to go to boot camp like three months after he graduated, but no can do. He went to boot nine days after his graduation. My boyfriend's friend was sworn into the Army in December, January 7th, he was gone to basic training. So like I said, it depends on the next available opening for you. As for the drug test, they do it like right before you go to basic training if I am correct. They do have pills to clean your system. I think they sell them at GNC it's like sixty dollars. But if you knew you are going to the Army, why smoke weed? It only jeopardizes your chances in the Army. They could possible not want you.|`|iHpknoLwaa	Well before they ship you off to basic, you're going to sign a lot of papers.  Then they are going to take you to MEPS, where they will process you in so that you can get a ship date, which can be very soon or very far away, depending mostly on you.  It is at MEPS where they first drug test you (don't be an idiot, STOP SMOKING POT), and if you pop then you're SOL.|`|AA10344136	It'd be smart of you to do three things:    1) Wait out at least two months so the weed is out your system.    2) Don't do weed or any other illegal drugs.    3) Spare getting killed in Iraq and join the Air Force or Navy.    Generally, it takes some recruiter paperwork processing to receive instructions to take the ASVAB test, which determines job qualifications to choose from.  Then, more paperwork is churned out before you are told to report to MEPS; between the two steps--you're looking at maybe three months tops.  If all goes well after that---you'll won't wait long till you're sworn in and off to basic training boot camp.|`|jumISG9laa	maybe u should wait 3 weeks when the weed is out of ur system|`|6LTaPSaeaa	The recruiter will have you do a piss test in his office before you go to meps.  You will go to meps whenever is available for your recruiter.|`|cHBcR0Chaa	you could go to meps just a few days after you see the recruiter. could take like 2 weeks pending how much paperwork the recruiter has to do. then at meps you will take a drug test. so you might just want to wait atleast 3-4 weeks before going to meps. just tell your recruiter you want to wait a month before going. just ask him questions about the army for a week and string them along. whatever you do, don't test positive at meps.

JDltTREfaa	Absolutely yeah - but the "right" people often seem to evade the DP, and I don't support the DP in circumstantial cases.      For example:  I think Scott Peterson is guilty of killing his wife and unborn son but all of the evidence was circumstantial so I wouldn't have support the DP in that case.  In contrast, the Spokane serial killer Robert Lee Yates ABSOLUTELY deserved and earned the death penalty for killing more than 12 girls and women.  (And the evidence against him was overwhelming.)  This guy got life in prison.  Outrageous!|`|yAsLhdp2aa	I think it should be up to the victims families...some families are able to extend forgiveness and the execution would only hender their situation and grief. some feel that life in prison is worse than death...some families feel that death is the only punishment suitable for the violence and the crime that took place..it should be left to them to decide..and not me.|`|AA12349214	For it.  All trolls should be sentenced without trial.  Let that be the end of them.    Seriously, its a contentious subject isnt it?  There is always that thought that there might be a miscarriage of justice and its not like you can bring them back to life is it?  However - there is no deterrent either that makes those that murder, rape, terrorise or any other serious crime, stand back and think 'hang on, I dont want that'.  Our prison terms have become such a joke, they earn a wage, can retrain into a trade, have three good meals, colour television, heating and lighting - none of which I am saying they should go without - but there are law abiding folks on the outside who would love all that but are earning on the poverty line and simply couldnt afford to retrain into a trade, or have colour TV's and computer games etc.    So on the one hand I think that there is a place for it - although there should be a minimum amount of time that a prisoner is kept on death row, and on the other hand is it the answer - and was it ever the answer?    I think I am more inclined to harsher prison environments where creature comforts are earned and not the norm.    Its a hard one.|`|fFqzD3aMaa	The victims families should not have a say in the prosecution. Justice is not for vindication or revenge, justice is about justice. Justice is cold and methodical and relies purely on logic, no emotion, ideally. I do not believe that the death penalty is a valid means of punishment because we have not perfected a method of assuring ones guilt. I would rather let 1,000 guilty men go free than execute one innocent one. You also have to question whether or not it is ever acceptable to kill a human being. I believe that unless danger is imminent and you need to take someones life to prevent them from killing another, there is no excuse to kill.|`|Sb93dIXbaa	I am for it.

I supported capital punishment for a long time, but the more I learned about it, the more I came to oppose it. In the end, several factors changed my mind:    1. By far the most compelling is this: Sometimes the legal system gets it wrong. In the last 35 years in the U.S., 130 people have been released from death row because they were exonerated by DNA evidence. These are ALL people who were found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Unfortunately, DNA evidence is not available in most cases. So, as long as the death penalty is in place, you are pretty much GUARANTEED to occasionally execute an innocent person.    Really, that should be reason enough for most people to oppose it. If you need more, read on:    2. Because of higher pre-trial expenses, longer trials, jury sequestration, expert witnesses, and other extra expenses associated with prosecuting & defending a DP case, plus the appeals process (which is necessary - see reason  1), it costs taxpayers MUCH more to execute prisoners than to imprison them for life.    3. The deterrent effect is questionable at best. Violent crime rates are actually HIGHER in death penalty jurisdictions. This may seem counterintuitive, and there are many theories about why this is (Ted Bundy saw it as a challenge, so he chose Florida  the most active execution state at the time  to carry out his final murder spree). It is probably due, at least in part, to the high cost (see  2), which drains resources from police departments, drug treatment programs, education, and other government services that help prevent crime. Personally, I think it also has to do with the hypocrisy of taking a stand against murderby killing people. The government fosters a culture of violence by saying, do as I say, not as I do.    4. Theres also an argument to be made that death is too good for the worst criminals. Let them wake up and go to bed every day of their lives in a prison cell, and think about the freedom they DONT have, until they rot of old age. When Ted Bundy was finally arrested in 1978, he told the police officer, I wish you had killed me. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (the architect of the 9/11 attacks) would love nothing better than to be put to death. In his words, "I have been looking to be a martyr [for a] long time."    5. Most governments are supposed to be secular, but for those who invoke Christian law in this debate, you can find arguments both for AND against the death penalty in the Bible. The New Testament (starring Jesus) is primarily ANTI-death penalty. For example, in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus praises mercy (Matthew 5:7) and rejects an eye for an eye (Matthew 5:38-39). James 4:12 says that GOD is the only one who can take a life in the name of justice. In John 8:7, Jesus himself says, "let he who is without sin cast the first stone."

5zBEU99kaa	Naa it means there are safe levels of toxins in your food.      Other neat things the FDA has done is determine how many rodent hairs and rodent droppings were OK in hot dogs.      How much radiator fluid is Ok to sweeten soda pop (A lot cheaper to put it in soad and other drinks than dispose of it in a hazardous materials dump).     Think about it, eating and drinking FDA approved stuff is really helping the economy, once Chemical companies started selling their hazardous waste to food companies as additives they turned a disposal expense into a new source of revenue!    Added NOTE: I actually prefer there be no toxins in my food! Thanks FDA but No thanks!|`|cRDbeUDvaa	Most people don't know your history with this issue, DD, so they don't get your point.  No, the FDA is not perfect.  Not even close.  They can be slow and bureaucratic, like any government agency.  But I'm not sure what the alternative is.  Dismantling the FDA is not a reasonable alternative.  Self-regulation by the food and pharma industries is far scarier than the FDA.  Suggest what you think should happen.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	usually FDA approved means the product has not been proven to be bad for your health, and hopefully the product does what it claims.|`|UsojaTuuaa	no things that are FDA approved have been reviewed and deemed okay by the food and drug administration|`|UkRjx6wNaa	Not at all, in theory -- the Food and Drug Administration is a government-run organization designed to set health standards for, well, food and drugs. If they approve something, that means they deem it healthy enough for consumption. They are also responsible for product recalls. They're there to protect you!|`|rdQAOXJ7aa	well over 100,000 people a year die from over the counter FDA approved drugs... so yeah stay they hell away from those things!    if you really want to look into medicine that actually works you should look up alternative medicine *whispers* just don't let the government know that ;)|`|Y8TS6Do0aa	It doesn't matter. You can't buy drugs not approved by the FDA in the United States.    And if the you can buy drugs "Not approved by the FDA" it means the "active ingredient" is either nearly harmless or has no effect.|`|mIYpMEfTaa	Kind of , sort of, maybe yeah ? ?|`|OFA2LAM5aa	Most medication approved by the FDA have not gone through stringent trials.

Only use chinese approved toys, toothpaste and Baby formula.|`|564611842b49f5e66f48b5de01e3b249aa	If an herb makes anyone person ill They will have it taken off the market, now drugs are a different thing, as several hundred thousand people have to die before it is removed. Then it is back very shortly with a ever so slight a change in the formulation and a new name. So it is much safer to take herbs.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	ha, it sure seems that way sometimes, doesn't it?  I don't know if you are old enough to remember the prescription drug Seldane.  Naturally it was approved by the FDA before it went on the market.  When I was 12 or 13 years old, I took the stuff for sinusitis, and a little while later, I had to be rushed to the emergency room when my heart went out of whack.  It ended up doing a bit of damage to my heart.  I nearly died from that ****.  It took them a few years after my incident to take the stuff off the market...and unfortunately many people had to DIE before they said "Oh, maybe we shouldn't have approved it.  Maybe we should take back what we said...."    Idiots...|`|62d39e62fb5d002657b2c8a11e5d5cf5aa	No, if  "something" is FDA approved does not mean that you should avoid it.    Obviously, your question is antagonistic, please explain your question and espouse your intent for an intelligent response.|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Usually it's the opposite; it supposed to mean that it's been tested and is considered safer for you to use.

0P69xP6naa	i have called many recruiters, and academys  as i too am just finishing up with a bachelors in Criminal Justice. i also was enlisted for the army and all ready  threw with my physical. i  just recieved a dui... i can not leave for the military for two years now and i will tell you that alot of recruiters will not hire you at all. i have contacted numeral and they say its state policey they do not hire dui convictions. all the recruiters that do are in cali and new york where they are hurting for officers. im not gonna move to a city or state where i have no clue of the surroundings (streets etc.) to be a cop. chances are you will not pass your 2 chance ride along because the call will come out and you wont be able to find the street due to not knowing your way around and it not showing on ur cpu navigator. most cops that are cops in other cities than thier hometown were already cops and transfered. this being said good luck if i were you i would just go ahead and bachelors in computer forensics or something that is sub-contracted by law enforcement that you can have a dui and do. to all these yuppys saying give it five years im curious what state you patrol in?????????|`|emNCaAq7aa	Can eliminate? Yes  Will eliminate? it depends. In is not an automatic knock out in a lot of departments. it is in some.  When you are about to get out of the military ask recruiters at the departments you want to try out for. Stay flexible with where you want to work and you will find a good department that will accept you if that is your only problem.|`|neWbgaHCaa	Stay clean for 4 years and you will be fine|`|1XqmVsgwaa	Nope, one DUI won't kill your chances.    Especially if you have a good tour in the military and have an otherwise clean record.    Though expect to have to answer some tough questions. It will be harder for you than for people with clean records, but not impossible.|`|3BhXf5MYaa	It depends upon the agency/department.  Check with some of the departments/agencies that you are interested in applying for.  They will usually have a recruiter who can answer most of your questions.

There are many definitions of what technically a recession is. The recession in Indian economy is posing challenge to our present GDP growth rate. We are affected due to recession in US and Western countries. A lack of demand is there, mainly in garments, jewellery, engineering goods, auto industries and IT sector. Since our economy is related to the global economy, it is really difficult to predict when we may overcome the situation. But locally up to some extent, it depends on the policies of the government by creating demand in domestic sector to compensate the loss in export demand by provide economic packages for various sectors. In the present situation, we cant expect much from export market. This may help to generate the employment opportunities in India. All the countries are trying to fight with the situation at various levels but, as indicated by the experts, we may get some sign of recovery by the end of 2010.

Think of how much that would do for him!    Seriously, think before you ask questions.. Why would Obama WANT to bankrupt the economy? What could he gain from that? Ppl usually have motives, what would his motive in doing that be?? Why would he want to implement socialism? Does everyone even understand what that would mean?|`|2YyQAmufaa	well he wants people to think the only answer is government.  The more private citizens and businesses look to government to solve it's problems the more control the federal government has over our lives.  Since Democrats are for big government this also sets them up to keep their seats. That's how democrats run for office, it's the old "see how I can fix you lives" method.  Now he's trying to "give" more money to state governments, one has to wonder what strings will be attached.|`|8rvXwx7Qaa	The American People will tolerate decline for just so long, then they look for new faces and ideas. Obama promised his ideas for all known problems, then some. He has set himself up for great expectations and little room for failure.

He's the best guy on THEIR side.|`|hYJELPedaa	I have thought a lot about Obama intentions and they appear unclear. He is as flip flopping as a child and lies about everything.

This Obama socialist program, planned for after the total collapse of the banking system and the Capitalist economy, has been tried before.

They will all be so hated in 2 years hopefully they will have to move out of the country.. Maybe Obama can find them a home in Ethiopia or wherever the hell he is from...|`|gK7kuyQqaa	If we survived spending in Iraq we can survive this. And minus the 4000 American lives. And guess what? Those trillions will be spent on HOME land. Not on other some foreign country.    So Bush spend couple of trillions on other country with regime change, its GREAT AMERICAN deal but Obama spends trillions spending actually on our country and its just crime.    Trillions for Iraq OR trillions for the USA. Wonder which is worth more?    This is about stupider than someone saying Bush is war criminal. Way way down there. Forget socialism, more like plain non-sense.     This is typical democrats are socialist stereotype. Same with streotypical war mongering GOP.|`|YTgw2VQjaa	Well you need a LOT of money to be socialist because many programs are then offered by the government.  So it would be really hard to be Socialist while being in huge debt.  He wants to get the economy stimulated... although I support Obama, I don't think that the exact stimulus plan will work since there is too much pork and not enough going towards things that will promote economic growth.  And no I don't think every private citizen getting a check because that isn't the way to do it.  Build job growth, that will make it happen a bit better.|`|DramWx7Qaa	Obama is not smart enough, and lacks the experience to intentionally do anything.    As an indirect effect of his actions, I can see bad things on the horizon.|`|3785eeef30e9bd9c24c59001fddabeb6aa	They need to stop printing money and allow the liquidation of debt to occur.  We are reaching the point where we can print our way out of this.  The Federal Reserve has expanded the money supply by 70% since October.  We cannot go any farther.|`|08ecd8b76e95de5e722d935f06309747aa	No, Obama is not seeking to intentionally destroy & bankrupt the American Capitalist Economy by imposing the most massive & most expensive 1.3 Trillion Dollar Government Spending Programs in U.S. History so Obama can then replace Capitalism with Socialism|`|7K5JzAWxaa	Yes, he is.  But so is the entire government, this has been the plan for a long time by the "government behind the government".  The economic crisis is not real, we are being lied to.  Well, it is real, but it's created, and it's controlled to scare the hell out of us into giving up our power.  Yes, to become a socialized world.  They WANT an us (poor) and them (affluent).  And, it'll work for them, for a while.  Then there will be social wars to overthrow governments... and a lot of lives will be lost.  A lot.|`|uxu8qJUYaa	Intentionally? Well he is taking advantage of our recent history with spend crazed lefties and righties and also taking advantage of our economic situation in order to live out his leftist view of how the nation should be.      So, well, yes.|`|caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	It is hard to say for sure.     One thing is for certain, when you need a fistful of hundred dollar bills to buy a loaf of bread, you will see that the U.S. dollar can be easily replaced.
yAsLhdp2aa	I am sure that some do..and I am sure that some do not and would repeat the crimes if let out.      the best a person can do if they feel regret is to take advantage of the prison library and education system..attempting to try and make ammends with the victim or their surviving family members would not be a wise choice, unless the victim or family members themselves initiated.    I have watched a documentary on how some prison systems will introduce a dog training facility.  those inmates who show such regret can be rewarded by bonding to that k9 and that eventually will help repair the hatred they feel towards humans..good system.|`|l2MjVVpRaa	Most do not regret what they've done, they regret being caught.|`|yJq1uqZ6aa	if you're a Christian, you have to believe they might    but a lot of people say they are, when they really aren't|`|rUNlmQG5aa	3 to 4% of the population are sociopaths. That being said, I would doubt it. The ones that somehow disturb me most are those, through native ability or shear cunning have remained to fly below the radar and, indeed may have even ingrained themselves within the most honored position within our society- how else can one explain the most recent debacles within our most trusted institutions? Or, try and explain away the ease with which a corporate embezzler may be allowed to spend only a few years in a white collar/ country club prison for a crime that may have been several million times as severe in nature as some poor, idiot, bastard that managed to fail robbing a local 7-11 of its' last 200 bucks? Not to excuse either, by the way. It is simply the disproportionality of the crimes that need addressing , post haste. Why, for instance is that Madoff human waste material still residing in his palace in New York City verses being housed in a cold and dark cage? I'll tell you why- because people worship these bastards.|`|86dbf689c9539acccd15feefb8b8f2a7aa	In many cases, I dont think so.  I think they regret getting caught, but no actually commiting the crime.|`|5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	Most just feel bad ... about getting caught and having to pay for their crimes.    Most criminals have no feelings (other than contempt) for law abiding citizens.    If you could poll violent criminals, most of them would tell you that they didn't "victimize" anyone ... the people they might have hurt deserved everything they got.|`|elnPX4FNaa	Some do nd some dnt.|`|KZZsVLT5aa	depends on the person some dont give a @ $% some are really sorry and it eats them up to the point of succide|`|68HSmMgXaa	I not only don't regret it, I would do it again if I was absolutely 100% sure of not getting caught.|`|AA11130699	Depends on whether or not you're sociopath.

As for the recession being G.W. Bush's fault that's B*****it. It is due to the collapse of the financial market from the bad loans made to people that didn't qualify (Thanks again Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton and democratic led congress-Community Reinvestment Act) Why do you liberals forget about the 52 months of the strongest job growth in history under President Bush.

Only the welfare bribes keep them at bay. Otherwise, vast riots would be popping up from coast to coast.    As things stand, it is just around the corner. And if it begins, it will spread, accelerate and gain momentum. If this erupts, it will make riots and strikes in UK and the whole EU look very tame. It would likely lead to the partitioning of the nation into several independent nations, like happened to the USSR. Only the Zionists and the far left wing of the population will attempt to block this natural solution.    If this movement of millions of outraged Americans gains sufficient momentum, it is going to happen. If the Zionist banksters, liberal press and puppet politicians fail to quickly turn things around and "make whole" those who were robbed (the collosal drop in property value) because of insane stewardship, all hell will bust loose. It is later than those criminals think. Millions are ready to fight. Locked and loaded. Zionists? They know who they are even if they are not as famous as Chuck Schumer, Barney Frank and Bernie Madoff. The think they have a special license to steal. WRONG!

Please try to hit the core issue if you want to prevent it happen in USA,      As your founding fathers predicted,    "There is a great danger for the United States of America. That great danger is the Jew. Gentlemen , in whichever land the Jews have settled, they have depressed the moral level and lowered the degree of commercial honesty. They have created a State within a State, and when they are opposed, they attempted to strangle the nation financially as in the case of Portugal and Spain."      "If they are not excluded from the United States by the Constitution, within less than a hundred years they will stream into our country in such numbers that they will rule and destroy us, and change our form of government for which Americans have shed their blood and sacrificed life, property and personal freedom. If the Jews are not excluded, within 200 years our children will be working in the fields to feed the Jews, while they remain in the Counting House gleefully rubbing their hands."       "I warn you, gentlemen, if you do not exclude the Jew forever, your children`s children will curse you in your grave."      "Their ideas are not those of Americans. The leopard cannot change his spots. The Jews are a danger to this land, and if they are allowed to enter, they will imperil its institutions."      "They should be excluded by the Constitution."|`|L0Dp5uYWaa	Well, generally speaking, the majority of people who riot and protest lean more toward the left politically, and being their president is now in office and they are all in awe, it would take a while, but if it ever would get to that point....it would be nasty.

I read a report of the GAO recently which reminds us that in those costs are the normal cost of maintaining the military manpower, also, the impact on our National economy for the acquisition of material assets such as weaponry, ammunitions, rations, support services in the US and the fact that military payroll for Iraqi servicepeople is deposited in US accounts to family and dependents. So, the War has had a big impact on the American economy. No way is this to suggest the deaths and injuries of our Warriors and innocent Iraqi casualties is to be discounted. War is hell.|`|L0Dp5uYWaa	City of the blind, huh? I take it you're the mayor....

For instance, we spend far more money on Africa than we do on Iraq, and Africa has nothing to do with our national security.    Why don't people call for us to stop wasting money there?
dVQdswtTaa	Benedict Arnold was an accomplished General in the Continental Army. He had been passed over for promotion, and decided to become a traitor because of a wounded ego.         The idea that he was ever accepted after that by the US is false. A captured American officer was asked by Arnold what would happen if the Americans captured him. He told Arnold, "We would cut off your right leg and bury it with full military honors, and hang the rest of you from a gibbet."       Arnold was severely wounded in the right leg at the battle of Saratoga, there is a monumant there to the "Most brilliant" commander, but does not mention him by name because of his treason.        He was opposed by the parliment for promotion in the British Army, because they felt that it would be an insult to put a disloyal man in charge of the Army, he eventually settled in Canada where he died.        The British officer hanged was Major John Andre|`|ChuhyvEaaa	Benedict Arnold|`|AA12087731	Benedict Arnold. Initially assumed a traitor. However, in later life he earned the respect of many and became accepted in the UK, USA & France.    The man who protected him (a Brit) thus allowing BA to escape was subsequently arrested, found guilty and executed by Hanging.     Today a memorial stone can be found in Westminster Cathedral (UK) commissioned and placed there by the ruling English of that period -  commemorating his gallantry!     The name of the Brit - I cannot recall!
5qQPdUnhaa	TO ANYONE who thinks casey is guilty    HOW in the world is the state going to explain why they haven't turned over evidence to the defense that they were ordered to turn over MONTHS AGO!!!..     And NOW . they were ordered to hand over MORE within 14 days.. and FAILED TO DO THAT AS WELL!. and are trying to rectify it.. in court.      WHAT THE HELL was a meter man doing 45 feet into the woods when THERE AINT NO DAMN METERS THERE..    Taking a piss?? Bul***** he can take a piss behind anyone of the 100+ trees, shrubs and other various foliage surrounding the entire area..      Someone planted it there.. and someone knows more than they are saying and it ain't casey.. theres more to this story that neither YOU nor I know.. so everyone. SHUT THE HE*L UP like your thought really matters.. your just giving people tht DO end up on the jury reasons to feel sorry for her..     and dont spout off about dominic casey, if your really gonna listen to that bullshit story then you must realize that during their search they were where the body was found, and there was nothing there. NOTHING WAS THERE!! NO BODY. So tell me how it got there in august, dissapeared when 3 different groups searched because IT WASNT THERE THEN EITHER, and suddenly reappeared for the meter man that so far is the only one that was in those woods that "found" something in august..     seems kinda funny how 3 groups of searches say there wasnt a body there huh?? odd. i know.  its called SHADY!!     ohh and ALSO...  Dont say "her body was under water they wont hit"     Commonly known FACT about cadaver dogs and underwater decomposition. The scent rises to the surface of the water, if there was a body under the water, the dogs would hit not only on the water but anywhere the water had touched before receeding..       Face it ppl too much evidence points that casey didnt put taht body there. she was in jail.. and that body wasnt there when the cops searched, when TE searched, or when the other two crews searched..       Its sad that someone would do this, intentionally frame someoen else..|`|rXTufSRRaa	I would say guilty|`|AA10344136	"Deranged baby killer"??  Don't have to guess your verdict on the Casey Anthony case....LOL.    I don't think Casey Anthony is some monstrous murderer as much as she IS a severely dysfunctional woman---whose negligence killed Caylee and she dove deeper into trouble covering ( burying ) up Caylee's death.    My take on the case?  Casey used sedative drugs to put Caylee to sleep so she could be left alone while Casey went clubbing.  Casey overdosed Caylee, killing her.      Want to know the creepy thing about THIS case?  There's thousands of early 20-someting year old moms who do the same thing to get their kids to sleep and sleep well enough---so the moms can slip off, leaving their kids unattended---so they can club and party on for hours on end.    Casey Anthony is NOT the first dysfunctional mother to do this to her child; Casey's case simply got CNN attention.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	"What does everyone else think about the deranged baby killer?"    LOL. Gee, what do you REALLY think about her?|`|WSmniFUPaa	I think she should be tried in a court, not Yahoo Answers.  People who hear evidence for months will decide her guilt or innocence.

AA11593134	Yes, I was stationed in Republic of Panama, and married a Colombian there. And it is recognized both in USA and Colombia and Panama. So it should be recognized anywhere...|`|0P4rYT8Qaa	It may vary on the country. For example, if you were living on a base in a country that doesn't necessarily have good relations with other countries, it may not count. I don't know what the laws regulating a marriage between a Muslim and Christian would be in certain Middle Eastern country's, but I imagine that would vary on country. Some not necessarily recognizing that.    As long as the country has an open policy towards dual citizenship, marrying the citizen of another country tends to allow that process to go more smoothly. Especially if you have a child there. There's U.S. military bases all over the world, so this is actually pretty common. Soldiers and American civilians do socially venture off into the countries. So if a French women married an American man, it'd pretty much be two citizens of different country's being legally recognized in marriage. The marriage would be recognized in the states, assuming that it's a heterosexual couple, or if it's a homosexual couple, only in Massachussets and possibly California (which that whole Proposition situation has turned into a mess).|`|GFOdY3nBaa	once you marry you are married everywhere as long as the marriage is legally registered according to the laws of that country. it is still recognizable everywhere else too.|`|CpTQagJOaa	I'm not sure, the marriage may or may not be reconized (I think it is), but the person would still not be a legal citizen. Many citizens end up with their illegal spouses deported. So whatever you do as for the marriage, just make sure the person will be here legally.|`|a57f3452d9ef1f62cbcc55c95fd107c3aa	Yes, marriage is marriage, as long as it is legal in that country, US will respect that.

NCO's are supervisors and they have people who have to answer to them. Also you will be required to attend certain training specifically for that rank.

It is more pay but quite a few changes come with the job.|`|AA11593134	yes, it is possible. If someone just wanted more money, they'd just get out the military and get a civilian or contractor job! First, it looks like if he is promoted, he'd be moving to another office or base. That could be a big reason if he has a girl there (since he cannot take his girlfriend to his new base unless he married her). Also, looks like he doesn't want more responsibility...|`|CmauBtVYaa	You can not turn down being a NCO in the Marines. Once he hits their cutting score for promotion, you will get promoted.

Go to http://www.prepaidlegal.com/hub/jasondic... and you will find info on that.|`|JDltTREfaa	Yikes.  I don't know that you can or that you should.  If I remember my banking-related law correctly a due bill is a statement of a liability by one party to another party following a transaction.  So, if I understand your story, you signed a due bill that claimed that you borrowed $20k from your boyfriend so you could get a home loan, right?    Even though you are now claiming that the due bill was false, I think you would have a difficult if not an impossible time getting the money back.  Have you heard of the "unclean hands doctrine?"  Essentially it means that where one person has done something bad, the court won't step in to help them if someone else does something bad to them within the same situation.  In this situation it looks as though you might have perpetrated a fraud against the mortgage lender to get the bank loan for the house by signing a false due bill.  You have unclean hands and probably couldn't prevail against him.    I'm sorry I didn't have more optimistic information for you.
JDltTREfaa	Yup.  Police officers are allowed to lie or otherwise use deception to do their jobs.  In this situation, telling the music playing neighbor to keep the music down or he would get a citation probably wouldn't have been much of a deterrent.  (Plus it would be a pain in the rear and a waste of time for the police to have to come back over another noise complaint.)  If telling the inconsiderate neighbor that coming back would result in the loss of the music player resulted in the neighbor keeping the volume down, then mission accomplished!|`|AA11622716	To "say" it?

But the platform will change slightly - most likely becoming even more intertwined with Christianity - or at least, one particular spin on Christianity.|`|VKee6ARRaa	hope not|`|q4EXFhV7aa	That largely depends on what they do with their party. There are so many divisions these days that they don't seem to know what they believe in or represent any longer. If they stuck with fiscal conservatism and limited government, they would ABSOLUTELY have a strong base. Unfortunately, those people--moderates-- are over run (or shouted down) by both the radical religious right AND the neocons.....leaving those in the middle without a voice. They have elected their first black RNC Chair, which should be momentous, but runs on the heels of numerous slurs and racial epithets concerning Obama's candidacy. Even some Republicans are attacking Steele...see: David Duke. Then, the religious right is out there trying to be personally involved in people's lives, denying civil rights, making demands on women's uterus'. NONE of that represents the majority of Republicans or the moderate, fiscally conservative, limited government Republicans.   It will be for them to decide where they will go. Based on this board alone, they want MORE right wing, religious/moral based policies....which fly in the face of limited government interference. Hopefully, this board doesn't represent all Republicans.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	Yes, Democrats will always need someone to wash our BMW's|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	Yes.|`|V7JVKApkaa	No. The Republican party is done for. Everything is stacked against them. They have no money, organization, power or destiny.    Yeah, you keep believing that. Most liberals without any historic perspective think they'll rule for a thousand years.|`|eIhD4y8Waa	Sooner or later,hopefully sooner, we will learn that both party's suck.Both party's are hypocritical and elitist.|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	As more and more people who voted for President Obama get pissed at him, (and it's happening by the hundreds per day,) the Republicans will be back stronger than they were before.    And by the way, I know many people of many different colors who vote Republican alongside me, you racist, stereotyping fool.|`|1j19zyeYaa	As long as this guy is in the public eye !|`|BIQrsl4paa	Yes, there will be, many of them becoming Republicans after they finally see the Democratic party for the house of cards it actually is.

All Americans have a future|`|lo3T01BOaa	If Republicans (and not just the politicians, but also the Republican voters) start acknowledging that minorities are also humans who live in our country, then yes, the Republicans have a future. They need to kick the right wing extremists out of their party and tone down the "we know what's right for you and your family" moral values b/s. If not, they will begin heading down the road towards party destruction, and Americans will begin looking for another second option.    A lot of minorities in this country are very religious, so the Republicans could also try and exploit their religious beliefs to get their vote like what they've already done with white southerners, but the problem is that the type of Republicans who would do that aren't too fond of minorities.|`|BQdXnCcHaa	Today, the only people having babies are Republicans, while Democrats are either not having kids or having abortions. So, in 40 years, there might be more non-whites but they'll be conservatives. Witness how blacks, Latinos and Asians voted as social conservatives in California on Prop 8.    What do you think?|`|VKFDL4sraa	Hopefully the liberal / socialist tendencies of the current democratic party / administration + congress will cause a deliberate uprising of conservatives to reclaim their republican party.  If the Republicans don't have a future, I greatly fear the socialist country we would become.  In a way, it may be a good thing Obama's in DC.  I hope he and the other democratic leaders spark a Revolution, but probably won't be the one they thought they'd see.|`|WSmniFUPaa	Political parties tend to run in cycles.  Perhaps in 20 or 30 years Republicans will evolve to become more centrist and inclusive.  And Republicans are very strong in demographics that vote--old, rich and white.|`|7BdOMd7Iaa	Liberalism is obviously the progressive answer to our problems, but i think as long as they ignore their ignorant buddy Rush and pay more attention to what is important to swing voters and more moderate Republicans. They haven't even been paying attention to the more moderate people in their own party. Unless they can do that then I don't see how they can survive, but they seem to be doing better.|`|7K5JzAWxaa	The left pendulum is swinging too high, too far, and will cause such a catastrophe that this country hasn't yet seen.  When it all comes crashing, the pendulum will swing again the other way with a fierce force, because people won't be happy with what they'll get from Obama.  If reps name a strong leader (a Regan type), then of course there's a future, and a good one because in the end, it is free trade and private business that is the backbone of this country and that built it, and it's only that which can do it again, and only Reps understand this.... apparently.|`|Wcjc8Au1aa	People asked the same things about the Republicans in 1964, and four years later they won the White House (with Nixon).  They asked it about the Republicans in 1974 after Watergate, and in 1980 Ronald Reagan won a landslide.  They asked it about the Democrats after the 1984 elections in which Reagan won an even bigger landslide - and eight years later Bill Clinton won the White House.    The country has a long history of swinging back and forth politically (as most other democracies do as well), so the Republicans will be back.  Don't know when, don't know who the candidate will be, but they'll be back.|`|AA10317675	The Dems do not have the Latino vote in their back pocket like the do with the black vote.      And the Republican Party is doing a good job of making it known that racists are not welcome in thier party.      And in two years, if the economy isn't recovering, you will find many people voting Republicans into the house & senate.    So don't count them out yet.|`|31edb7797d765f1300c12d8242a8f21caa	I am concerned that 1) the govt will make a large part of the population completely dependent on them for their livelihood, and 2) huge numbers of illegal immigrants will be encouraged to come here and will be registered and allowed to vote in our elections. This will give the Dems a huge majority in all state govts and the Federal govt which will be almost impossible to root out of office once established. This will go on until the complete collapse of the dollar and the economy occurs after which chaos and anarchy will result in the balkanization of the USA into several independent countries.|`|3vjgBDu4aa	They need a major change in their political philosophy  !

LwHPgAXgaa	YES! There is the real deal for Government Grants! They actually start at the City Level.  It all depends on what kind of grant you are looking for.  The official site for the State of California, www.ca.gov    . Look on this page for business, or even put it in there search engine for there web site.  The Small Business Association also has grant info on this site.  From there you can choose if you need/look at possibly the Federal Site for the grant your looking for.  Grants are designed for specific areas and objections/goals that the government needs to accomplish. so don't give up on looking for grants there are thousands of them and I'm sure there is one just for you.

SkWzsnuxaa	My son enlisted in the Army with eczema. He not only had it on his medical records but these were Army medical records as he was always an Army family member. You won't have any trouble.    I just read the answer given by "Curt" the former recruiter. Better take that to heart! It is very possible that MEPS simply didn't notice my son's eczema even though it was all in his records.|`|1E7gqGBGaa	I don't really know for sure, but I doubt that you would get denied for something like eczema.|`|K9kKgrtUaa	possess as much information as you could maybe is one of the options,however it is quite time consuming,here http://www.insuranceidea.info/free-insur...  is the resource i have ever had good experience.|`|BIQrsl4paa	Mepcom uses the strictures of AR 40-501, which is the Army's regulation governing enlistment, reenlistment and commissioning and Eczema is a permanent, non-waiverable disqualification.

DRNFdhdCaa	hello    south africa has a long and turbulent history, suffering from racism , unrest and obviously apartheid    in 1994 south africa had democratic elections, ushering a new age of democary    a commission was formed , to highlite the crimes of the past , committed by both the whites and the black , and allow closure     "The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was a court-like body assembled in South Africa after the abolition of apartheid. Anyone who felt that he or she was a victim of its violence was invited to come forward and be heard. Perpetrators of violence could also give testimony and request amnesty from prosecution."    it was an effective way .... both "terrorist" and security force members could admit to their crimes, and request forgiveness ... and in the event it was proven that the crime was politically motivated ... amnesty was granted    without great men such as nelson mandela, and to a lesser extent fw de klerk , civil war was definetly going to occur in sa,  and thanks to reconciliation ... South Africa has proven herself to be a leading african power    (admittedly we have high crime etc, but we are a success story)    notes  ====  im a white south african , and i pity those who think apartheid was beneficial    a system that discriminated on skin colour ... we should be ashamed of ourselves    and crime is a socio economic factor ... ie. apartheid created a huge lower class group without access to education or bank loans etc ... obviously the "have nots" will steal from the "haves"    - the only way to fix that is through education, affirmative action etc ... a long process that will take generations|`|FYjf7hkEaa	Screw that. Bring back aparteid. Globally.|`|ynlft41Uaa	All I know is that South Africa is a craphole from what it used to be.|`|2DICrKNraa	Look up Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela on the creation of the TRCs.  The TRCs were formed as part of ending apartheid.    I don't understand the second part of your question - the migration was largely a result of the fact that SA was better off economically than its neighbors plus there have been conflicts ongoing in its neighboring areas.    SA is now facing major problems with crime, HIV and tremendous inequality.  The country essentially negotiated away its economic future to private interests at the end of apartheid.
2wyDALHgaa	Yes, as others have noted, he most likely will change.  I know I did after both of my deployments.  Thats not to say that the changes will be bad.  As others have noted he will most likely seem more alert and be watching things around him more when he gets back.  Thats only natural after being in a place where people may be trying to kill you at every turn.  He may also seem more quiet and appear to be brooding a bit but again, he's used to being on alert and thinking about what is going on around him while he was away.    The best way that you can help him through this, and bring the two of you closer together, would be to encourage him to share his feelings more and just allow him the time to work through the reintegration when he returns.  Till then, support him without question.  Write often, be available when he calls, sent him pieces of home in any parcels you send and just never let him forget that what he is doing over there is appreciated.      Speak with someone at your local deployment support center or what ever it is called in your area, to learn more about how you can support your husband while he is away and when he returns.  It may not be easy but if you approach it the right way you will only end up stronger as a couple and him, stronger as a soldier and husband.|`|koXcq0l1aa	I read this and although I am not in your situation, may I just say God bless you, your husband and our troops.|`|bITTzzcVaa	He will change, but that doesnt mean it will be in a negative way. He will probably be on high alert most of the time, act a little more agressive, and show signs of OCD but these are things the military taught him to do.    My husband was only in Iraq for 3 months before he was blown up. He changed completely. I opened up to him and told him he wasnt in such a horrible place anymore, that he was home, sweet home, and he started to lighten up.    Things will be different the first month or so but he will fall back into the swing of things.    Im sure you know this but their are all kinds of support groups for military wives on the internet. There are SO MANY stories and experiences to learn from.    Good Luck and Stay Strong!  Something you love is always worth fighting for.|`|jHUAfrojaa	Okay, I'm not a Marine Wife, my boyfriend and I have decided to hold off the marriage until after his first deployment and after I get my degree.    BUT, I talk with plenty of women who are going through deployments right now, one of those women being my cousin who has gone through five deployments. He might change, he will most likely be on high alert. It all depends on the things he saw during his deployment. If it was a good deployment, then he shouldn't change all that much, if he had a bad deployment, such as near-death experience, there is a high chance he will change. Being paranoid. When he gets home, don't try and push him to go out and everything. Take it slow, have a nice little night home, let him adjust back to his life. Try and make his adjustment as easy as possible|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	everyone is different...  my bf is deployed for the second time, saw a lot his first tour but  this second tour, he is just fine..we had a baby recently..my bf is the sweetest guy i know and so far he's still the same..  everyone deals w/ stress and tragedies differently..just be strong yourself and take it each day at a time... when he gets home your questions will be answered...in the meantime, just be there for each other...    btw, the changes may just be being alert all the time, being protective and feeling anxious but that's only in the beginning after he gets back..he should get back to normal after a couple of wks... if not, he may have post traumatic stress.... watch out for signs , just read up on it.  My bf came back for leave had all the signs above..but went back to being normal after a week.|`|AA11593134	I am deployed, and am in the Air Force but deployed in a "nice" place (Qatar). So depending on where he was deployed (Iraq?) and what service he is in, those changes might not be significant. If he is in Army that deals with a lot of shooting, etc., then maybe he changes a lot. For us, we work in an air conditioned building in front of a computer fixing computer problems, so not much of a change for us -- and our tour here is only for 4 months.|`|Cx8EKcemaa	Well I won't beat a dead horse. Honestly though to help me after my deployments my wife would always ask me about it. I know wives have the "don't ask them what they did over there rule." It's a dumb rule, talking to my wife about it helped me a lot. I didn't expect her to understand, but it just helped getting out to someone I trusted and would listen.|`|AA10441085	My husband has been to Iraq 3 times 03, 05, and 07 and each time he came back he had changed especially the first time in 03 he was there during the invasion.  He was on high alert for a few months after getting back, he also was a little bit paranoid, and very protective (almost to the point that it was annoying but I never told him that).  I remember waking up one night and he was talking in his sleep about what he had done over there.  I also finally got him to start talking about what he did while over there.      I have also seen my brothers-in-law come back too and 1 was different, he was more aggressive, had a much shorter temper and was just kind stand offish around some family members.  The other tried to say he had PTSD and honestly I laughed at him because I know what he did and where he was, and he never saw anything while he was there, and he never changed he was the same as he was when he left.    So really it will depend on a lot of factors like: Where he was, what he saw, what he did, and the biggest one is who he is.|`|zGVVxuFLaa	Everyone has a different experience, and each deployment will probably be different.  There are several books that you could probably get from the library:    http://www.amazon.com/Surviving-Deployme...  http://www.amazon.com/Life-After-Deploym...    You might also want to click over to SpouseBUZZ http://www.spousebuzz.com to read other people's reintegration stories.  It will help you to see that there can be all types of reactions, but they're all normal.    Good luck to you!|`|014NXPfFaa	Everyone reacts different.  Before our son was born, when my husband came home he'd want a week or two for us to do whatever he wanted.  His tolerance for alcohol was way down, so I stayed sober when we went out just to keep an eye on things.  He'll be closer with his work ppl.  He'll be stinky when you pick him up.  It depends on a lot of factors how he will react.  Just be there for him and do your best to be accommodating when he first gets back.  He's been in a literal helI so try to spoil him, at least for a little bit.  And btw some guys have no problem talking about their experience, others wont want to be asked.  Just leave it how he wants it.  Mine has deployed 6 times, on his 7th.  He's still the same guy I fell in love with a long time ago, just with more muscles and a very interesting gunshot scar on his thigh.
wg78UkxFaa	Yes, it was sexual assault since he grabbed you and was touching you.  Because the attack was against your will, it was an assault.      He should be turned in for doing what he did to you.  Next time he may rape/hurt some one even worse.  He obviously has a big problem and it may only get worse with time, especially if he gets away with what he did to you.    You have no reason to feel bad, since it wasn't your fault at all.      Most likely when it happened it stunned you, you may have been so shocked that it was happening to you that it caused you to freeze.  That can some times happen to people when some thing bad or scary happens to them, it can paralyze a person to make them unable to react as they need to do.    Some thing that you can do is play a sort of a game with your self.  Think of situations where you may become afraid, then plan in your mind what would I do if this were to happen again.  Plan out how you will react, think the situation through to the out come that you want to have happen.  By doing this it will help you to learn to be able to react differently should any thing ever happen to you again.      Obviously this is a totally different type of situation but I'm only attempting to use it as an example.  Its like when we practice fire drills, by doing them the right way each and every time  we learn to react in a certain way should there ever be a real fire.  Only you will be practicing in your mind, by thinking things through to the end to the best possible out come.      It is always good to have a plan in your mind as to how you will  react to certain situations if it were to happen to you.  By doing so it may help you to react differently should some thing such as this or any thing else ever happen to you again.      Do not be so hard on your self.  You didn't expect such a thing to happen to you.  Do give your self credit for what you did do, you didn't give up and kept fighting against him and what he was attempting to do to you.  That takes courage to do.    Report him so that won't happen to another girl.  This way he may be able to get the help that he most certainly needs, so that he won't have a chance to that again or worse next time.  He needs help and he needs it now, he has bad problems to think that he can do some thing such as that.    God bless you!  Stay safe and do report him.|`|AA11130699	It is sexual assault and you can prosecute but it will be hard.|`|0aGTgxONaa	that is sexual assault. Plain and simple. Just as you called it. I would be reporting it to someone as he will most likely do it to someone else, and it will probably be worse the next time he does it.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Yes it was and he should be reported. You were in shock, thats why you did nothing. He knew what he was doing and after you did not respond to him, he panicked and let you go. Report him before he really hurts someone. You did nothing wrong.|`|GuTUQpSpaa	Yes, it's technically sexual assault, although I don't think you would be successful in bring charges against him, to be frank.|`|FJ6960c8aa	yes! or attempted sexual assault|`|z88IMXNFaa	It's sexual assault.|`|R5LuKSUXaa	yes it was.  i would report it.  get that little digesting bastard in jail!|`|AA11327241	I agree with what cindy said. Report him before he assaults someone else.|`|Wcjc8Au1aa	It certainly is sexual assault.  Whether you have enough evidence to get him charged and convicted, however, is a very different question.  From reading your question, I think the most important thing to be said is that IT WAS NOT YOUR FAULT.|`|2lFRYr8Eaa	Yes it was.  As soon as you tried to get free, that was a no.  He did not quit.  Call the police and ask to make a report.|`|KncPJwIaaa	yes it is he groped you and held you captive so if you gonna do something do now cause the longer you wait the worst time you have to prove his wrong doing|`|p8YC9n2Raa	maybe you gave him an idea that made him think that you liked him but in the book of law that is sexual assault|`|AA12034021	Yes, it was a sexual assault.    Don't beat yourself up over not being able to speak.  You were in shock, I am sure.  You may not be able to pursue legal action, but you probably should try, or maybe at least discuss this with his parents.  After all, if he gets away with it with you, he will probably try again (perhaps with someone else), and next time he may be more successful.  I know, it is a lot to ask of you, but do seriously consider it.  Think of the girl who may be his next victim.  If you have to courage to act, she may not have to suffer what you are going through, or worse.    Even if you try to press charges and the DA does not feel there is a strong enough case, the police will at least know about it, and can be more watchful of him.  Likewise with his parents - and with them, even if the DA can't do anything about it, they can certainly send him for some therapy (having said that, it's rare that sexual preditors are cured through therapy, however, the therapist can evaluate how much of a danger this guy is to the community, etc. - it is at least worth a try).|`|YHeTQNpFaa	You better run away from ol' boy..couz next time he ain't gon let u go nowhere!!

Additional Information: Thanks so much for the nice e-mails, If you really have the balls come on down!    I left off that in 1987 Israel publically announced Israeli plans to ban new military sales contracts with South Africa.

4IoFLqGmaa	There not     Liberalism is a broad class of political philosophies that considers individual liberty and equality to be the most important political goals.[1]    Liberalism emphasizes individual rights and equality of opportunity. Within liberalism, there are various streams of thought which compete over the use of the term "liberal" and may propose very different policies, but they are generally united by their support for constitutional liberalism, which encompasses support for: freedom of thought and speech, limitations on the power of governments, the rule of law, an individual's right to private property,[2] and a transparent system of government.[3][4][5] All liberals, as well as some adherents of other political ideologies, support some variant of the form of government known as liberal democracy, with open and fair elections, where all citizens have equal rights by law.[6]    Those who identify themselves as classical liberals, to distinguish themselves from social liberals, oppose all government regulation of business and the economy, with the exception of laws against force and fraud, and support free market laissez-faire capitalism. In Europe, the term "liberalism" is closer to the economic outlook of American economic conservatives.[7] In the United States, "liberalism" is most often used in the sense of modern liberalism, which supports some regulation of business and other economic interventionism which they believe to be in the public interest. They tend to support a welfare state[5], a government-imposed minimum wage, laws against discrimination in hiring, and affirmative action.[8][5]    Modern liberalism has its roots in the Age of Enlightenment and rejects many foundational assumptions that dominated most earlier theories of government, such as the Divine Right of Kings, hereditary status, established religion, and economic protectionism.[9][10][11] Liberals argued that economic systems based on free markets are more efficient and generate more prosperity.[12]    The first liberal state was the United States of America[13], founded on the principle that "all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to insure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."[14] This said, much of early liberal thought originated in and influenced the politics of The Netherlands, the United Kingdom and France.    Nationalism refers to an ideology, a sentiment, a form of culture, or a social movement that focuses on the nation.[1] While there is significant debate over the historical origins of nations, nearly all specialists accept that nationalism, at least as an ideology and social movement, is a modern phenomenon originating in Europe.[2] Precisely where and when it emerged is difficult to determine, but its development is closely related to that of the modern state and the push for popular sovereignty that came to a head with the French Revolution in the late 18th century. Since that time, nationalism has become one of the most significant political and social forces in history, perhaps most notably as a cause of both the First and Second World Wars.    As an ideology, nationalism holds that 'the people' in the doctrine of popular sovereignty is the nation, and that as a result only nation-states founded on the principle of national self-determination are legitimate. Since most states are multinational, or at least home to more than one group claiming national status,[3] the pursuit of this principle has often led to conflict, and nationalism is commonly associated with war[4] (both external and domestic), secession, and even genocide in contexts ranging from imperial conquest to struggles for national liberation.    Nationalism does not always lead to violence, however, and it plays an integral role in the daily lives of most people around the world. Flags on buildings, the singing of national anthems in schools and at public events, and cheering for national sports teams are all examples of everyday, 'banal' nationalism that is often unselfconscious.[5] Moreover, some scholars argue that nationalism as a sentiment or form of culture, sometimes described as 'nationality' to avoid the ideology's tarnished reputation, is the social foundation of modern society. Industrialization, democratization, and support for economic redistribution have all been at least partly attributed to the shared social context and solidarity that nationalism provides.[6][7][8]    Nevertheless, nationalism remains a hotly contested subject on which there is little general consensus. The clearest example of opposition to nationalism is cosmopolitanism, with adherents as diverse as liberals, Marxists, and anarchists, but even nationalism's defenders often disagree on its virtues, and it is common for nationalists of one persuasion to disparag|`|TfpeYyuwaa	I don't really see any similarity.|`|BQdXnCcHaa	Both end in "alism".

oRMJcPoTaa	The Governor makes the call for federal assistance when it becomes clear that the need is at least $45M.  That is the "threshhold" for a state to be declared a federal disaster zone.  Meanwhile, 4600 National Guard are in Kentucky, providing relief and working to clear roads, restore power and deliver supplies.    But Obama already signed some emergency declarations last week, speeding up the process, even before Kentucky's Governor finally made the formal request today.    I don't see how turning down the heat in the Oval office will do much to thaw out Kentucky.    EDIT - I didn't claim that Obama called out the National Guard.  The first paragraph of my answer refers to what the Governor is overseeing during the period before requesting federal aid.  The feds don't send additional resources until they are asked, because each state has the right, and responsibility to manage its own affairs without federal intervention.    I understand your sarcasm.  Your entire question is rhetorical.  I get that.  Even though the two disasters are not "an equal comparison", you want to compare them anyway to support your thesis that Obama doesn't care about Americans.  You don't have to go to such great lengths.

Then many people that experienced Hurricane Katrina wouldn't have to suffer.    Obama is dealing with a recession. He became president in the middle of a recession. So therefore he cannot prevent it if its already happening. There is no one solution to this problem. He is using his knowledge and leadership to keep this country from falling apart.

AA12020119	Yes. There are all types of illegals in this country. One of the main types are those who come over here to go to a university and never return home!    "Visa overstays contribute to illegal alien numbers  Many individuals from foreign countries are issued temporary work and student visas. Those who fail to return home after the visa expires become illegal aliens. Visa overstays account for a sizeable number of illegal aliens in the United States. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) reported in 1997 that:     There were 170,000 new overstayers each year between 1982-1992 and 181,000 between 1992-1996.   The number of new illegals who joined the illegal population by Entering Without Inspection (EWI) was 250,000 from 1982 to 1988 and 242,000 from 1988 to 1996.   41 percent of the illegal population are overstayers.    About 8% come from Europe and a larger number from Canada!   http://www.usimmigrationsupport.org/ille...      "What makes you think the government really doesn't want them though?"

Apparently you've never seen or heard of those who drive while under the influence of marijuana and kill people.  Though alcohol is definitely the most common DUI offense, marijuana is also fairly prevalent.  My first day interning at the prosecutor's office, I saw the video of a woman who was arrested for DUI.  The only thing she had in her system was marijuana and she was more impaired than virtually any drunk driver I had ever seen before or since.

Half my friends there were Jewish, so were a few of my girlfriends.  Then I moved to LA, and there were a good number... but if you went out fifty miles to Riverside county, there were none.    There are a good number of Jewish people in a few major urban areas, but after you get outside those, there aren't many.    PS how do you "see" Jews?  They generally look white or middle eastern... a lot like Italians, Portugese, Lebanese, Greek, etc.|`|OFGE01tRaa	Much more than your estimate.

noo8vpvzaa	Maybe your 'question' was as racist as your avatar...    EDIT: Black people have accomplished many things that have benefitted our society and way of life...Here are a few:    Otis Boykin invented 28 electronic devices. His devices control such things as computers, guided missiles, and pace makers.    George Washington Carver invented over 400 products with peanuts. Carver's work literally saved the south by providing an alternative cash crop when the boll weevil moved in and destroyed cotton crops. Carver developed hundreds of applications for farm products important to the economy of the south, including peanuts, sweet potatoes, soybeans and pecans.    Dr. Charles Richard Drew contributed to the study of blood plasma and set up the first blood bank.    Lewis Latimer invented the carbon filament common in light bulbs. Latimer worked in the shops of both Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell.    Jan Ernst Matzeliger, a relative unknown to most Americans, invented a shoe making machine that increased shoe production rates by 900%.     Garrett Morgan invented the gas mask and the first traffic light.     John P. Moon helped create the devices that store and retrieve data generated by computers. He is Apple Computer's v.p. for peripherals engineering.     Bessie Blount is a forensic scientist and physical therapist. She invented a device called the portable receptacle support, which allows amputees to feed themselves by biting a tube that delivered one mouthful of food at a time.     Michael Croslin received more than 40 patents for inventions including a computerized blood pressure machine and an intravenous pump used to dispense exact dosages of medication.    Cesar, an 18th-century slave, was granted his freedom and a pension by the South Carolina General Assembly for his discovery of a cure for rattlesnake bites.    Benjamin Carson is a pediatric neurosurgeon renowned for successfully performing the intricate surgery that separated twins conjoined at the head.    "Ozzie" Williams developed small rocket engines that would steer the lunar landing modules on Project Apollo missions.     Lawnie Taylor plans and directs programs for the Department of Energy that promote/support commercialization of newly developed solar techniques.|`|AA11327241	If you don't like the way they do business why don't you and "the handkerchief" log on elsewhere.

"It is nice to be important but more important to be nice."|`|oRMJcPoTaa	Because your question and your avatar make you appear to be racist.    Black American Contributions to America and the World:    From their earliest presence in North America, Africans and African Americans have contributed literature, art, agricultural skills, foods, clothing styles, music, language, social and technological innovation to American culture. The cultivation and use of many agricultural products in the U.S., such as yams, peanuts, rice, okra, sorghum, grits, watermelon, indigo dyes, and cotton, can be traced to African and African American influences.    African American music is one of the most pervasive cultural influences in the United States today. Blues, jazz, gospel, hip-hop, R&B, funk, rock-and-roll, soul, techno and many other contemporary American musical forms originated in black communities and have been incorporated into the popular music of almost every culture in the world. The names of famous and influential African American musicians are too numerous to mention.    African Americans have also had an important role in the world of dance, including art dancers Alvin Ailey and Bill T. Jones, tap dancers Bojangles, Sammy Davis, Savion Glover and the Nicholas Brothers, the "steppers" of black fraternities and sororities, and pop culture dance phenomenon Michael Jackson.    Famous African American writers and poets include Langston Hughes, James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Zora Neale Hurston, Ralph Ellison, Toni Morrison, and Maya Angelou.    Famous black artists include Romare Bearden and Aminah Robinson.    Black medical pioneers include Dr. Daniel Hale Williams, an early pioneer of heart surgery, and Dr. Charles Drew, who developed the modern blood bank.    Famous black inventors include George Washington Carver, who created nearly 500 agricultural products, Jan Matzeliger, who developed the first machine to mass-produce shoes, Granville Woods, who had 35 patents to improve electric railway systems, Garrett Morgan, who developed the first automatic traffic signal and gas mask, Norbert Rilleux, who created the technique for converting sugar cane juice into white sugar crystals, Lewis Latimer, who created the inexpensive cotton-thread filament that made electric light bulbs practical, Frederick Jones, who patented the air conditioner, and Lloyd Quarterman, who worked on the creation of the atomic bomb.    In 1967, civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall became the first black Supreme Court Justice. In 1989, Douglas Wilder became the nation's first black Governor. In 2001, General Colin Powell became the first black Secretary of State, and his successor, Condoleezza Rice, became the first black woman Secretary of State in 2005.    In 2008 Barack Obama became the first (self-identified) black American to be elected to the office of President of the United States of America.|`|j7lg7IXBaa	Because it was offensive and bigoted.

8tQ8JLO5aa	The House session is similar to a grand jury where evidence is presented and indictments are handed out.    The Senate session is similar to an actual trial.    It is done so because the House is thought of as the lesser body of the legislature.    Edit: excellent, Barry W...|`|IUXriZQJaa	The US House of Representatives is the most representative body politic in the Federal Government -- it has the most members, they face election the most often, and they have the smallest constituencies -- and the Senate is considered to be populated by seasoned, veteran statesmen. They are more carefully and widely chosen. It has to be the legislature, the FULL legislature, which handles an impeachment and removal attempt, and it must be led by the Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, because it is one of the most serious affairs we can encounter.    This is why the House was chosen to indict/impeach and the Senate was chosen to try it under the moderation and direction of the Chief Justice to determine if removal is warranted.    Congress also defines, tries and punishes treason and insurrection. The US Congress is considered the nation's highest magistrate, unlike judicial supremacist version of politics we see emerging today.      --------      "because its in the state . not federal plus the LAW was not uphheld  the impeachment of the Governor was wrong the law in the USA.is everyone  gets a CHANCE TO DEFENDE HIM OR HER SELF and judged by  a company of their peers        * 9 hours ago    Source(s):  cnbc"    Excuse me?

"The awful discretion which a court of impeachments must necessarily have, to doom to honor or to infamy the most confidential and the most distinguished characters of the community, forbids the commitment of the trust to a small number of persons."     "The convention, it appears, thought the Senate the most fit depositary of this important trust. Those who can best discern the intrinsic difficulty of the thing, will be least hasty in condemning that opinion, and will be most inclined to allow due weight to the arguments which may be supposed to have produced it."    http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/...

The Guard can be called out instantly, by the governor of their state.  They are charged with being ready to assemble at a moments notice.      The Navy also keeps ships and their weapons ready enough for rapid response.  There are now also rapid response teams in all the services.  A call from the President (or his Constitutional substitute), I believe, is all that's needed to send those on their way.  Confirmation from key congressional members is probably all that's needed for them to engage the enemy and complete the mission.    All able bodied males (now females also) have the Constitutional responsibility to keep minimal military arms for aiding the National Guard at such times, or fighting them if they are used to abuse us.  Read Federalist Paper No. 29 titled:  "Concerning the Militia."  Pay particular attention to the concerns of the "republicans."  Those were the anti-Federalists, the opponents of Alexander Hamilton's Federalist Party.    Paper No. 29, as are all the Federalist Papers, was a propaganda article promoting the acceptance of the new constitution (what we have today) as a replacement for the original one, The Articles of Confederation.  Hamilton, the Federalist party leader, codified those into the volume of Federalist Papers.  There are also Anti-Federalist propaganda articles, I believe weren't codified, against accepting the constitution because of perceived dangers in it.  Some of those dangers were relieved by the Bill of Rights the anti-Federalists authored and demanded or they would not accept the new constitution.    The Federalist Party ultimately lost favor and disintegrated, because of some abuses feared by the anti-Federalists and eventually realized. The Republican Party was formed decades later and re-instituted some Federalist policies which caused our Civil War (abusive tariffs was the primary cause).  The Republicans were the first "progressives" here.    The anti-Federalists formed the Democratic-Republican Party that became known, after 1830, as the Democratic Party.  It was truly liberal then but became more socialist early in the 20th century.|`|2DkSBY2qaa	The U.S. is currently 17th in health and longevity   44th in literacy  37th in Freedom of the Press  32nd in education (overall)  16th in Freedom (Denmark and Ireland tie for first)  18th in Civil Liberties    Lowest Foreign Aids budget among developed counties by GDP per capita.

If you are in the Marines and are in MCT or MOS, they will not let you leave to walk.    I'm not sure about the Army. Pretty sure it's the same thing though.

If you are looking for more discipline and a bigger challenge join the Marines.  My boyfriend left for boot camp June 15th and graduated September 12th.  He later had a 28 day training ten days after boot camp, and then after all of that, he finally started schooling for his MOS.  My friend who joined the Navy went to basic in July, graduated early September. He finished like a three week training in September, and now is almost done with his schooling.  When I compare the Navy to the Marines, the Marines are more discipline and a lot of people hold the Marines in a higher level than any other military branch.    My father and cousin-in-law both said that the Marines ARE the best military branch. My father is a retired Staff Sergent in the Army and my cousin-in-law is currently a Staff Sergent in the Army, and he has gone through about five tours in Iraq, so I think they know what they are talking about.

If OCONUS, then forget about it.    If you decide to get married, then it would be best for you to go Active Duty.  The same rules apply.  Before you can go Active Duty, you must get a letter of release and some other documentation from your unit before you can get the Army recruiter to process you into Active Duty.  If you get married and then do this, then the recruiter can guarantee your duty assignment to wherever she is stationed.  It's called the Married Army Couples Program and can only be done while on Active Duty.  That way, you can go where she goes and vice versa.

So therefore, he has very questionable stats and is counting on people (like you) to shut your eyes and defend him.
m1HVh5YUaa	Oh my god I'm exhausted just thinking of how to make people understand what you are talking about. So many defense mechanisms and conditioning to muddle through! No examples to show them. Many people think the banking situation is due to too little government intervention and that the "free market" caused it. How can you reason with this chosen denial of simple easy provable facts?    It is a worthy endeavor but what else can be done besides just to continue stating the facts? One thing that must first be established is DO the people you would like to convince even want individual freedom, much less began the debate as to how to achieve and protect it? The concept of liberty would have to be understood, and not this corruption of the concept such as "freedom from want".     I'm sorry, I can't be of much help. There will always be people that come to the conclusions that you came to, and the number will grow ever so slowly, and since I consider this true, I find them to be the only ones that matter. The solution is with them and the next step is what are THEY going to do? They must find a way to manifest this system even if on a very small scale.

u6ALw1gAaa	You will need to apply to and be hired by an agency in the State you want to work in.  I was living in NC, decided to apply for a job in Mississippi so I applied for it and was hired.  Once I went to work in MS they sent me off to the academy down there.  I later moved back to North Carolina and took a job here.  It can be done.  I have done it twice.

Also, dont be too disappointed if they wont take you right away.  Many departments will hire at 21 but wont actually hire a 21 year old.  This is because they want their officers to have a little more life experience.  Sometimes military experience helps in that reguard.  But dont give up...you may just have to apply a few times.|`|DPTj4VP6aa	I have a Friend that moved from Utah to Texas,  and he said to tell you that you need to contact the government office for the police in the state you are moving to an see what the requirements that that state requires.|`|GYuGjDrvaa	My best answer to you would be to try to download an application for Nevada Police (on Google), get their address, mail it to them along with a copy of your Driver's license, social security card, high school diploma, resume, and at least ten (10) years of job history and see what hapens fro there.
a9lPZxBmaa	It is at the very least trespassing, and by jumping a locked fence very possibly Breaking & Entering since it involves the defeat of a security apparatus.    Contact the property owner, expalin what you did, apologize, and assure them it will not happen again and they will probably drop any charges. Failing that you will have a better chance of achieving leniency with the court.    If you were in Texas & it was my pool, I could just shoot you and be within my rights.

JDltTREfaa	You hope and pray that the guy who sold you the property isn't telling the police that he told you the stuff was stolen before you bought it.    You also lose the property (which goes back to the rightful owner) and you lose whatever money you paid for the property.|`|eulMjLtPaa	If it was discovered you'd forfeit it (without a refund).|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	It's only a crime if you knowingly receive stolen property. However, you asked what can happen and you can certainly be convicted of a crime you didn't commit. It's a misdemeanor or felony depending on the value of the property and the particular circumstances. If you weren't criminally charged you might have the property seized or lose the money you paid anyways.|`|zFsTSrOcaa	It can be taken from you and returned to the rightful owner.

Kh4p4gPXaa	Yes,   they can ask you for ID at any time.    And you must present it upon request.    As far as can they enter your home,  there's circumstances.   If they are looking for someone,   they can enter if they have probable cause to assume they are there (as in,  they followed her and watched her enter the front door).    If it is simply a fishing "mind if we take a look around" then you are free to tell them no,  unless they have a warrant.    Don't be surprised if they hang around for awhile on the street though.      They will,  however,  ask you if "so and so" is home.   If you answer no,   and they find out you were lying,  then you have committed a crime yourself and will be arrested for it.   If you say "yes",   they have the right to enter your home and arrest the suspect without a warrant.|`|BQdXnCcHaa	Yes, they can boss you around. If you're smart, you'll comply. They have a tough enough job without having to worry about you.|`|3shqoZ5Oaa	they have to have a warrant to enter your house. if they do not then you have the right to deny them entry :}|`|PFLFEhVRaa	No.    They can't.    They need a warrant to enter your house.    Illegal entry.|`|GYuGjDrvaa	The law has this term called exigent circumstance(s) which means that unless the cop is running after this person and chases them into your house then it's okay for them to do that.|`|AA11130699	You have the right to refuse entry to the police unless they have a warrant to search and seize. The exception would be if they are in hot pursuit and saw the person they were after enter your home in an attempt to flee then they can kick your door in and treat you like any other suspect,|`|GEydJTyyaa	Here they can if they have chased the person into the house, otherwise they need a warrant.You do have the right to stand there and read the entire warrant before allowing entry.|`|T5p5EBIhaa	you guys should keep video camera with you all the times and when the ***** as cops stops you record everything and see how they act **** them they stop me for no reason and telling me go back to your country can you belive that **** ***** *** ****** cop stops me and says go back to your country and cuss at me and ****  ****** ****** go back to africa that why i always keep camera with me so when they say or do **** i have my lawyer look what he can do this days cops dont even respect basic rights|`|m3q6CIQMaa	There seems to be more to this than what you described.  I am going to give you an answer based on two different case scenarios.      If a police officer comes to your door and wants to search your premises, the only way the office can is if you give consent for them to search.  If you refuse the right to search then the only way they can enter is with a search warrant.  Now, here comes the part that you have to be careful with.  If the officer specifically asks you is so & so here with you, if you answer no and the police later found out that you lied then you have committed a crime.  You can be charged with obstructing a police investigation and be charged with a misdemeanor.  It is best not to lie and let them in.    Now, if the police officer is in pursuit of a vehicle and the pursuit comes to an end in front of your house, his house, or someone elses house, the police officer can enter the home.  For example, if a cop is chasing you, and he runs into his house and locks himself in his room or whatever, the police can follow and chase you right to your room. No warrant needed.
mOTCr8Pxaa	First off big buisness and government are basically sex partners. Second, the situation is so bad it the banks would need antoher trillion to stay afloat this year and thats on top of the heavily flawed spending bill I hope the republican senators kill. Of the 825 billion only 90 goes to actual infrastructure and aid. The other goes to various government agencies to make them bigger, not in any way to the economy. Most of the spending of that money won't be done until lat 2010 and after. I hope the "bailout" get killed in the senate. It's throwing gas on the fire.    My advice: Invest in firearms.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Why did the Gov't give them the money?|`|d3a0051575f0ca9e98fa14121e4cf6e8aa	It's the American way, line their pockets and screw the taxpayer.|`|jFHZo7pGaa	I don't know. But the government is lashing out at them. THe whole "golden parachute" thing that has happened has po'd every one!  I really question this myself.

So they don't think that they are getting that much.|`|gkFOTg4Yaa	Start voting for third party candidates and end the monopoly that the two parties have had for ever. That or a coup is the only way "change" will ever happen.|`|FdZtCnwhaa	It is still relying on the trickle down effect, the CEO's and board members getting the most and every one else getting crumbs. Like most people would think the big guys would take a pay cut since they make millions in stock options, bonuses, business expenses that are claimed on corporate taxes..etc.etc. just to keep more employees.    If workers haven't noticed by now they are how a company is built not the guys that sit on their butts getting paid to talk %$*!
GEydJTyyaa	you were convicted 15 years ago, you're in your early 30's.  so you were what around 15-17 years old, unless you were tried as an adult it's not on your record, you were a juvenile.if you haven't been back in jail since then it doesn't matter to most, unless they have a policy not hire anyone with a felony record.    might be best to go to an employment agency they would know who will hire people with a criminal record, but even some of those require a no felony record.|`|Ao3Fl3iSaa	Take any job to survive.

If you are in a position where you have a big negative going against you in terms of jobs, find alternative ways to make money that don't depend on whether you have a criminal record in the first place.     By that I'm not suggesting you go back to crime, don't. What I'm suggesting is that either you find a freelance job or go into business yourself. Possibly use the underground economy if you must, go back to school if you can, but don't expect different results by repeating the same tactics that have already met with failure. Just realize that there is lots of different ways to making money, and having a 9-5 job is just one possible solution.|`|a993fdffebb5d1eb64fe6baba1499d98aa	Go to Goodwill Industries.

As an ex-convict and more than one conviction in my criminal history I can tell you that it is hard to maintain. Take assessment of yourself: do you have marketable skills? If you do then pursue those avenues. One thing that I have found is never tell a prospective employer you have a felony conviction because 99% of the time you will not get the job. Now days there are still a lot of employers that would hire felons but their insurance companies won't allow them to. I have had some good jobs and made good money for a lot of years without telling an employer of my criminal history. I have also lost some good jobs because the employer found out later. Fortunately I am retired and don't have to worry about it anymore. But man, you have get up every day and pound the pavement, send out resumes, bug friends to let you know about opportunities, searching for a job is a full time job in itself.  When you do get a job never ever tell people you work with about your conviction, because the little piss-ants will use it against you if they think they can advance their own position.|`|68HSmMgXaa	Can you get a pardon?

SQKSJ6Uyaa	the conditional release of a person from prison prior to the end of the maximum sentence imposed.|`|E3tWPVEqaa	All of the meanings originated from the French parole, meaning "(spoken) word." Following its use in late-medieval Anglo-French chivalric practice, the term became associated with the release of prisoners based on prisoners giving their word of honor to abide by certain restrictions.|`|Vrc13ExVaa	After an initial sentence, it's an agreement to be let out of prison given you have some restrictions, such as not partaking in certain behaviors, seeing a parole officer, etc. And violating parole or breaking the law results in the loss of parole privilege and being sent back to prison to fill out the rest of your sentence.

Now you go in a desert with plenty of money but the people living there does not know any thing about currecny and exchange system of modern man, you give the currency and ask them for some water? Will they give water for you?. Every religion have on certain context forbidden or ban something. Now compare the example of water with religious beliefs. You will get the answer. If a mother afraid of snakes will ask his child not to go outside.but with curiosity child will go out and look. But if he is afraid of superstition and devils the mother can tell him there is a devil outside not to go out side. Now what the mother want is the well being of her child. Can we blame the mother for telling lie to her child. On a similar way can we blame religions for forcing some beliefs. Thats all. if you are sure the doing of something does not harm anybody or any creature you can do the act.

You can still be arrested and convicted for DUI.|`|eMFRN0HCaa	I don't know what the rule is, but LOL i tried to drive home once, and I passed out next to my truck for like five hours. Someone called the police to report someone dead. When the cops showed up, they woke me up and I couldn't walk or drive, so they let me sleep in my truck till i sobered up.|`|d60812b54bd94ed9b890bbc6003e6400aa	You may be able to avoid being charged if you clearly show no intent to drive:    If you can open the trunk from inside the car, or you have two separate keys, lock the ignition key in the trunk.  Don't warm the car, don't turn on the radio, and set the parking brake.    Sleep lying down in the backseat, or recline the passenger's seat if that's not possible.    Most importantly, though, you have to be parked where you were drinking.  If you're sleeping in the bar parking lot, it's pretty obvious you didn't drive anywhere.  If you're pulled off the side of the highway, it's pretty obvious you did. :)    But, if an officer does decide to arrest you, it's doubtful you could fight the charge, since the standard is only "care and control" of the vehicle in the vast majority of states, including California.|`|v4GLpEBqaa	You'll be fine if you park in an area where it is obvious a car would be parked, like a semi-busy parking lot or somewhere not so obvious where a car wouldn't be normally parked (ie. side of the road). I wouldn't keep the keys in the ignition, cause that is a chargeable offense, and just to be safe I wouldn't keep them on yourself. Toss them in the glove box or in the arm rest. State and local laws vary.|`|f7fe854f34875855e7bddc879f7c8ff9aa	Check with your local law enforcement.  I would bet they could arrest you for some reason if they found you doing it.  Try not to drink up your cab fare.|`|e93659642a9147aad2a89d7b0a52ebddaa	the laws are very vague and obscure in this case. apparently yes, as long as the keys are no where near you. like they are in the trunk or in the house or far away. becuase if they are near you like in your pocket/lap they can say u had "intent" to drive and give u a DUI.|`|AA11130699	In most states no. You can still be arrested for dwi because you are in physical possesion of the vehicle.

As to how to end it, simple:     The party/media machine has an Achilles Heel. While it can unleash heII on one office (president), doing so takes all its muscle. It can not possibly assail all 465 to 470 Lower House and Senate seats open in 2010.     If we last two more years, we simply must prepare - beginning now! - to unseat as many of these incumbents as possible.     So, everybody get ready. Find a school, church, club, co-op or whatever in each of the 435 districts, earn their attention, encourage them to select a capable, reliable person to run, have them sign a sworn affidavit to do whatever is necessary to end the fed once in office and vote them in in 2010!    ...|`|NktvqJhlaa	I hear ya Brutha, we'd have a better chance of coming out ahead at a Vegas casino and at least we might get a few free drinks out of that deal.

But this is all part of us being led to accept the China government to own us by paying off our debt. So this is ordained and been in the works to make us so financially destitude. Afterall, if Obama really cared for us he wouldn't have spent so much on his inauguation and his own political race, and if he cared about the people he wouldn't have asked for donations from the hurting financially drained people.  NO one cares in USA who is still sitting in a chair in the Senate and House.  So frankly, I get to say this, "It's all over USA. You might as well decide now we are going to be run and  purchased by the Communists period, it has been in the works for a very long time.  After Obama we will look back at Bush with a sigh and say, 'geez, what were we bitching about originally?"    Every news media hype is to sidetrack us from the real problems.    Notice the Gaza Strip war was around Obama problem with showing us his real birth certificate. No one has been putting that on the main media, cause he is a crook and no one wants to say that our USA President is a crook. So they keep the media off that, and focus it on something else, and if we said that we don't like Hamas but then our USA Council of Foreign Relations are backing them up with warheads and missiles and financial backing.. so what does that tell you, this is a drum up war to sidetrack the people from the real issues.|`|itZ0yWFuaa	I think the Fed needs a good strong enema.|`|7pfCkrCzaa	To many people are to focused on the media....brainwashed by the elite.

Interest on the money the Federal Reserve creates and loans to our government should not be charged period. This interest money should not be paid with our tax dollars. But since the Federal Reserve sets all of the rules that our monetary system runs on, and since our government has no regulatory agencies that can have any oversight, investigative or auditing powers into the workings of the Federal Reserve, and our Congress doesn't have the testicular fortitude to tell the Federal Reserve which is a private banking cartel what to do like they will do with any other private business. We the people are stuck with a fictional "air" debt that has to be paid with real tax dollars from you hard working squeamish sheeple.   Until our entire nation stands up as a nation, and creates it own strong force  and gets the backbone not only to challenge our government, but to also challenge the Federal Reserve System, and bring this system down to its knees, we will be stuck paying the "air" bills with real tax dollars.   Our Congress put the Federal Reserve in place in 1913, by secret and covert means, and it will be up to the people of this nation all acting as one large force, to bring down not only our government but the Federal Reserve System as well. Sooner or later the people will be pushed beyond the breaking point, and they will come up fighting as one strong force uniting all of us by the same economic conditions of families starving, no money for food, medicine,housing, clothing, or any of the essentials basics of life.     The people will come out fighting mad and God help and Government or Bureaucratic Agency or Department who gets in their way, because as far as the people are concerned they will be fighting for their very servival, and the people will prevail,be victorious and tiumphant. It might take time, but we the people will win.    On a side note I was especially impressed with your last paragraph (serenely soMEone). That is the same message I have been trying to express to everybody not only on here, but on every website I make a comment on. I am always suggesting to everybody all accross our nation to vote out all of the incumbents that refuse to do what the people of this nation paid them to do. I have asked that the people vote in only people that will follow and abide by our Constitution and make it a crime punishible by life in prison for any Representative to try to circumvent the law of our land, our Constitution.

Acts of Bigotry by Prominent Democrats and Leftists:   Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Franklin Roosevelt, the long time hero and standard bearer of the Democrat Party, headed up and implemented one of the most horrible racist policies of the 20th Century  the Japanese Internment Camps during World War II. Roosevelt unilaterally and knowingly enacted Japanese Internment through the use of presidential Executive Orders 9066 and 9102 during the early years of the war. These orders single-handedly led to the imprisonment of an estimated 120,000 law abiding Americans of Japanese ancestry, the overwhelming majority of them natural born second and third generation American citizens. Countless innocents lost their property, fortunes, and, in the case of an unfortunate few, even their lives as a result of Roosevelt's internment camps, camps that have been accurately described as America's concentration camps. Perhaps most telling about the racist nature of Roosevelt's order was his clearly expressed intention to apply it almost entirely to Japanese Americans, even though America was also at war with Germany and Italy. In 1943, Roosevelt wrote regarding concerns of German and Italian Americans that they t0o would share in the fate of the interned Japanese Americans, noting that "no collective evacuation of German and Italian aliens is contemplated at this time." Despite this assertion, Roosevelt did exhibit his personal fears about Italian and German Americans, and in his typical racist form he used an ethnic stereotype to make his point.  Expressing about his position on German and Italian Americans during World War II, Roosevelt stated I dont care so much about the Italians, they are a lot of opera singers, but the Germans are different. They may be dangerous.     Roosevelt also appointed two notorious segregationists to the United States Supreme Court. Roosevelt appointed South Carolina segregationist Democrat Jimmy Byrnes to the court. Roosevelt later made Byrnes a top advisor, where the segregationist earned the nickname assistant president. Byrnes was Roosevelts second choice behind Harry Truman for the VP nod in his 1944 reelection bid. Roosevelt also appointed segregationist Democrat Senator Hugo Black of Alabama to the court. Black was a former member of the Ku Klux Klan with a notorious record of racism himself.     Hugo Black: A former Democrat Senator from Alabama and liberal U.S. Supreme Court Justice appointed by FDR, Hugo Black had a lengthy history of hate group activism. Black was a member of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920's and gained his legal fame defending Klansmen under prosecution for racial murders. In one prominent case, Black provided legal representation to Klansman Edwin Stephenson for the hate-induced murder of a Catholic priest in Birmingham. A jury composed of several Klan members acquited Stephenson of the murder, reportedly after Black expressed Klan gestures to the jury during the trial. In 1926 Black sought and won election as a Democrat to the United States Senate after campaigning heavily to Klan membership. He is said to have told one Klan audience "I desire to impress upon you as representatives of the real Anglo-Saxon sentiment that must and will control the destinies of the stars and stripes, that I want your counsel." In the Senate Black became a stauch supporter of the liberal New Deal initiatives of FDR and a solid opponent of civil rights legislation, including a filibuster of an anti-lynching measure. Black led the push for several New Deal programs and was a key participant in FDR's court packing scandal. Roosevelt appointed Black, a loyal ally, to the U.S. Supreme Court. During the Senate confirmation of Black's nomination, the issue of his strong Klan affiliations caused a public controversy over his appointment. Following the confirmation Roosevelt claimed ignorance of Black's Klan past, though this claim was dubious at best. Black's first Senate election, which occurred with Klan support, had been covered nationally a decade earlier in 1926. Black's Klan affiliations were a well known part of his political background and recieved heavy coverage in the newspapers at the time of his appointment. On the court, Black became a liberal stalwart. He also continued his career of supporting racism by authoring the opinion in favor of FDR's Japanese internment program in the infamous Korematsu ruling.     Senator Robert Byrd, D-WV: Byrd is a former member of the Ku Klux Klan and is currently the only national elected official with a history in the Klan, a well known hate group. Byrd was extremely active in the Klan and rose to the rank of Kleagle, an official Klan membership recruiter. Byrd once stated that he joined the Klan because it was effective in "promoting traditional American values" (Source). Byrd's choice of words speak volumes about his bigotry considering the fact that the Klan is a notorious hate group, and the racist "values" it promotes are anything but A

He is merely a vessel for the far leftists.  He is Pelosi and Reid's puppet and they are the masters.  I don't like Obama but understand that this whole thing is bigger than he will ever be.  The far left libs pushed this wannabe celebrity into office because idots would vote for him and now they are trying to pass a bill that is to payback all of the people that helped his campaign.  After that, who knows what the hell else we will be dealing with.       But, as for the question, yes I want his policies to fail, and the people behind this whole socialist thing to be sent to Siberia, but I would like to see people as a whole succeed.  I never want anyone to fail, just the greater good triumph, which means some with other wants must fail.|`|gqJekAgjaa	here's my answer...    http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=W5YpXa-1F3...|`|AA11926471	obamas success is americas failure.|`|yZXe2XLlaa	No, I don't want Obama to fail, I want him to fail to implement socialism in America, that would make America fail...|`|3yXhtBSxaa	"Personally, of course I want obama to fail with his socialist agenda SO America can succeed."

No, you would wage a war against them too    We are still in this because GWB never learned about the Vietnam conflict, which is nearly identical to Iraq.    1)LBJ misleads the nation to think the Tonkin Gulf incident was unprovoked, when it was really induced  1) GWB lies about WMD's    2) Congress writes the "blank check" to make war  2) Congress writes the "blank check" to make war    3) War against an ideology:Communism  3) War against an ideology:Terrorism (although we caused all of the terrorism there)    4) Unwinnable  4) Unwinnable    5) Against people who were used to fighting foreign invaders (French)  5) Against people who were used to dealing with invaders also (British)    6) Loss of global respect for the US  6) Loss of global respect for the US    Bush did not learn US history    Listen to Roger Water's "leaving beirut"  "Oh, George...Oh, George!...that Texas education must have f***ed you up, when you were very small!"

gvukdlOjaa	When US and Philippine forces retreated to the Bataan peninsula after the Japanese invaded, there were approximately 80,000 military personnel and 26,000 civilians.  I'm not sure how many were there when he left.    MacArthur arrived back at the Philippines on Oct 20, '44.    Contrary to popular belief, MacArthur was an inept leader and was an egomaniac.  Many Americans and Philippinos died as a result of his poor planning and stubbornness.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Mac...    MacArthur had been the Field Marshall of the Philippine Army while still a US general and was good buddies with Philippine President Quezon when the Japanese first attacked US forces.  In fact, President Quezon had paid MacArthur half a million dollars for his role in the Philippine military.  No wonder he returned.|`|FKJaQXQLaa	MacArther didnt leave anyone behind when he left the Philipines.  When he uttered the famous line "I shall return", he was speaking to the Philipine people.  MacArther loved the Philipines and when the Japanese took control, he had to leave or face capture.  He didnt have nearly enough men or equipment to fight.  MacArther made a promise to the Philipine people that he would come back and liberate the country from Japanese control.  In October of 1944, he kept his promise and waded ashore in Leyte Gulf when we drove the Japanese from the Philipines.  I was at Leyte Gulf with my unit to mark the 50th anniversary of MacArthers return in October of 1994.  I had a lot of fun and love the country and people of the Philipines.|`|WIczM4URaa	he left behind the entire country, his entire army, and the japs tearing at his pants as he ran like a rabbit.|`|VofjJ35caa	Roughly 100,000 men were captured or surrendered. This included both Americans and Filipinos, who at that time were a part of the US Army Forces Far East and thus technically part of the US Army.    Only one third of the 150,000 American forces deployed were evacuated or otherwise escaped when Wainwright surrendered all allied forces in the Philippines. Organized resistance from Filipino guerrillas and allied agents continued, though the conventional campaign to take the Philippines back and rescue the remaining POWs only began in 1944.    Dunkirk was somewhat different - you had 400,000 British and French troops, over three quarters of that number successfully evacuated and the rest either dead or captured.|`|ubrYk78waa	MacArthur left a whole US Army in the Philippines, under General Wainwright, when he was ordered by Roosevelt to get out of there. He did not want to leave.  He returned in Oct. 1944 at Layte Gulf. Which he had to fight with Nimitz over who wanted to bypass the Philippines. It was Roosevelt that said we will go back.  In my opinion it would have shortened the war if we had bypassed the Philippines and gone on toward Japan. The Philippines were not crucial to winning the war. We could have destroyed the Japanese fleet anywhere in the Pacific because of our superiority in sea power.
367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	MA's most definitely do have the authority to make arrests. Master at Arms (MA's) are the Navy's law enforcement unit. They conduct a wide variety of missions to include patrol, anti terrorism/force protection, investigations, K-9 etc. Not only do they have authority to make arrests but are charged with upholding good order and discipline. MA's must enforce not only military law (UCMJ) but also enforce rules and regulations of the United States Navy. You can think of an MA as a Navy police officer. Depending on the base and/or billet (job) being filled at the time, an MA may patrol on foot, bike, vehicle or possibly a patrol craft. MA's are not necessarily assigned to a ship unless they are a Chief Master at Arms because non rated or low level personnell can be used to perform MA duties on ship and because of the current war on terrorism has made rated MA's (those that went to MA A School) primary role to be at shore billets. That's not to say that you won't see MA's on ship but they generally get sent to perform most missions at shore stations. MA's also operate brigs in the Navy.|`|AA10709853	no.  In fact the COAST GUARD has detachments on board for the sole purpose of boarding ships.   Navy MAs are NOT Law Enforcement and cannot arrest people at sea.  Only the Coast Guard has that authority.      Navy MAs are Force protection.   they guard the ships and sailors.|`|P4Jc76GPaa	Navy law enforcement are called Master-at-Arms MAA). They usually don;t board ships. Normally it would be other Navy personnel boarding ships. This would be Law Enforcement Operations (LEO) However a few exceptions would be for Mobile Security. They board ships to protect them when they are going through Straights like the Straights of Gibraltar for instance. They protect assets not personnel. They would also protect the ships against pirate attacks. When an MAA is attached to a ship they will conduct law enforcement on their ship. This is not part of Mobile Security. When and MAA is attached to shore they will perform patrol duties. Some are even K9 dog handlers. Hope this helps.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	LEO do deploy on ships and they perform regular LEO duties. Bigger ships even have a brig.

Excuse me, but if you discovered America sir, how is it possible that there were people already there?     There are two sorts of history in the US, the nice smooth, isn't america nice history, and then the truth.     "All men are created equal" they said in 1776. Said the slave owning, white anglo saxon men as they looked down on just about every minority going. Even today "All men are not created equal" in th eyes of many americans, gay people for instance.     How about the view that america's economic success came about due to hard work. The old, "if you work hard in america, you will be successful".   Most of the american wealth has come from messing other countries about. CUba became communist because of american interference after they gained independence from Spain. Look at the way the world bank abuses its powers to make americans rich in places like bolivia and other latin american countries.  Also look at how the mass of middle class people keep this underclass of inner city folk down, unwilling to change the way things work because they have it good, even if these others don't.     So the first president is who you want it to be, i would not doubt that some claim it was Reagan, because, oh, he took down communism (said with a little laugh) when there were so many other factors that had to take place for this to happen that no one person could, and if anyone did, it was Gorbachev.|`|azxM9SEkaa	washington|`|LgC2oA77aa	open your book and study|`|0KAJ48QVaa	Obama is the first and the last president of the USA.|`|AA10527991	George Washington|`|7959WbC2aa	John Hanson, first president under the Articles of Confederation. 6 more presidents followed before Washington became the first president under the Constituion.|`|21RH8bo8aa	John Hanson was the first president of the united states, however that was under the articles of the confederation, the pre-curser  to the constitution.

f4Yec6iNaa	Capitalism means freedom, where people are free to start business, innovate, produce and enjoy the fruits of their labor.    Socialism means the governments controls the means of productions , centrally plans the economy and control every facet of people's lives.

Case in point: above, imzadi said that it's because America was founded by people who were trying to escape socialism.  @ ! %% have you ever opened  a history book???  That's one of the most flagrantly stupid, outright incorrect things I've ever read!  MONARCHY.  CASTE SYSTEM.  ARISTOCRACY.  It's completely freakin' different!  People came here because they didn't want to be born into an inescapable social structure they'd never be able to escape!    But despite that, as of the last time I checked it, she has more thumbs up than thumbs down, which means that there are people who either believe she's right factually (a failure of education), or are willing to agree with her on principle, not because she's actually right (a failure of character).  And therein lies the problem: people here in the US - particularly on the right - fall in lockstep with people they share ideological opinions with and let that override the facts of the matter because it's easier that way.    Our capitalist society has made us into an aristocracy with what is, in effect a caste system.

ffxB7EdZaa	Report this man to the police immediately. Save your e-mails and print them out, use them as evidence in court. Take photographs of the damage to your vehicle. If you can, find the purchase receipts for the missing items to show proof that you owned them (if you have photographs, that would be helpful as well). You need other witnesses, do your friends know what's been going on? Did anyone else see him destroying your property?    Why would you let someone get away with threatening to kill you? Of course there is something you can legally do. Call the police IMMEDIATELY to report damage to your vehicle. Not doing so could forfeit your right to legal action, insurance disbursement and monetary repayment from this man to replace your stolen goods and to pay for damage to your vehicle.|`|wCZ3T5QLaa	File a restraining order is an idea for some. Personally seeing some of my female friends going through this it just pisses the person off and gives them even more motivation for retaliation. Carrying protection with you wherever you go and keeping something beside your bed for protection just in case can help (licensed gun, knife, bat, taser, etc) If your going somewhere public make sure you have someone with you and stay away from secluded areas incase he follows you. Block him on myspace and cut off all communication with him.     My personal experience with this, one of my close female friends was assaulted by someone who was doing something similar and she was too scared to file a restraining order. I decided to take things into my own hands and me and a few of my buddies suited up in skimasks and busted down his door in the middle of night and returned the favor and told him if he ever talked to her or even glanced at her again he would regret it.     After that he was so scared he never bothered her again. Sometimes its best to handle things in this manner than it would be to get law enforcement involved. I dont condone this but sometimes its your only option.|`|e7rKwI30aa	If you can give the police evidence of death and arson threats, then you can get a restraining order filed against him.

Do this even with the phone calls and the myspace page. You don't worry about the physical proof, that will be up to the Officers and believe me they can find it. If the Officers are good then they will do there own work and nail him. Any time you go some were let your parents and/or a friend know how, what, when, and where you are going. If possible have some one go with you and Trust your instincts.|`|LxfjzzM2aa	save all the letters he sent you. and go to the cops right away. try to have as much evidence as possible. goodluck. i havent had much luck with the police.    i went to report a sex offinder. that has been talking to my daughter and her friends and they told me they cant do anything untill this man touches a kid. the law these days are ridiculous!!!!!!!!!|`|E3tWPVEqaa	Gets witnesses and file a report so you can get your property examined|`|AA10893961	Considering he has vandalized your vehicle, yes, you can file a report.

Oh no...    Now let's just cut to the chase, shall we? The Obama-haters didn't then and they don't now. They are of a delusional, fantasy-based mindset of perpetual double-think; as such, they're not concerned with facts which contradict their fantasy-centered worldview.    In short, the conservative elite (Atwater, Rove, and their disciples) has constructed a populist messaging apparatus with the specified intent of appealing to the lowest common denominator in both intellect and morality, and it has been running non-stop for over 3 decades. The lowest common denominator now dominates and controls the Republican Party, and has further refined LCD pandering such that it's immensely effective with those who merely want their preconceptions reinforced, but virtually useless in persuading the ignorant (i.e., 3 weeks prior to an election, the so-called "undecideds") and others not already possessing this sort of near-pathological cognitive bias.     The LCD people then project their own moral corruption and intellectual incuriosity onto their opponents, but the hard-right, being of such a deluded mindset, are only aware of this at the subconscious level. Their contempt and, at times, even open hatred for the "others" which whom they do not identify with on ethnic, religious, and political grounds, is a necessary result of this. It is merely a sort of pressure valve; the suppressed cognitive pathologies and the obviously false nature of their worldview cause much anxiety, which is in turn dubiously directed at minorities, gays, immigrants, liberals, Democrats, Muslims - you name it, they hate it.|`|DB7UMkGCaa	"Did you know what socialism was before the election?  despite the fact most of you dont know what is after we shall ignore. but come on be honest did you really even a have clue about the word before the election?"

Leninist socialism seemed like a great idea to the citizens at the time and the USSR took a pretty serious shot at socialism but like many movements the ideal was corrupted by the power mad and greedy.    That's a danger common to most socio-economic theories.  The power mad and greedy usually find a way in somewhere.|`|TfXoVfWYaa	Yes, actually, I've known what socialism was since 7th grade.  By now I can tell you the textbook definition, and it's various applications in multilpe European countries, and explain the socialist (as opposed to 'capitalist') principles in post-communist transitional democracies like Russia and China.    I'm glad you know what it is, as shows from your comments, but I have to say how disheartening it is that we're in the minority.

JDltTREfaa	I believe it lowers inhibitions and makes people more likely to say things they wouldn't ordinarily say, but marijuana isn't a truth serum.  People can and do lie under the influence of marijuana and alcohol every minute of every day.      (i.e., "I only had a couple of beers, officer" when he had at least a six pack.  "I don't know how that weed got in my pocket, officer" is an example of dishonesty or their is a pot fairy who magically deposits drugs into pockets, purses, and vehicles.  "I wasn't with another woman, honey, I swear I was out with the guys" who are apparently lipstick and perfume wearing cross dressers!)    My husband likes to say that guys are 100% honest about their feelings in the moment they are trying to seduce a woman - no matter if they are drunk, high, or stone cold sober.  But when they aren't trying to seduce the woman . . . the truth can be different!|`|AA11327241	Being high might get someone to drop their inhibitions and seem more open with their emotions...but the thing is when they aren't high they will probably go back to whatever attitudes they have when they are not high. So then you get a sensitive guy but only when he's high. Is that the kind of relationship you want. A guy who will only Tell you loving stuff when he's high. Do your self a favor find a guy who can get in touch with his feelings with out having to smoke a blunt.|`|VMDljEFuaa	Just like anything else, depends on the person.    MJ, like alcohol, helps you chill and lowers your inhibitions.  Just as some people have problems sharing emotions without a little help from a drink or two, I'm sure there are also those who prefer the laid back sense they get from a few hits of weed.    In a perfect world, it would be nice not to have to use chemical catalysts to honestly express emotions, but this ain't a perfect world by a long shot.  I'd say that if a person looks you in the eye and tells you the truth about whatever, accept it for the good it offers.      If that person had a little shot (or a little hit) to loosen up, I'd still be happy for the communication. If they're talking nonsense, then they're drunk or ripped or both and don't pay any attention to them at all! ;o))|`|2acc3a7c0b86e1730fe9b78eddb8365baa	From Past Experience: Stoners don't care about anything but getting stoned. Stoners don't care how much it costs to get high. Stoners will sell out their own family and friends to get high. Stoners don't feel anything except being stoned...DUH ....If you don't get high...please do not hook up with a stoner. They are narcisstic people as well. I know...I have lived it. Good Luck...|`|TOIOyJ10aa	no its not like drinking liquor!!!  alcohol is bad for everyone, it never did anyone good!! it makes you aggressive, emotional, it takes away your boundaries and you feel like you can do anything. and if like that's all, it's f*cking bad for your health.  there was never recorded a direct death caused by weed. alcohol killed thousands of people, think only of all the car accidents!!    but, it is actually possible this guy got a little bit more emotional because of the drug. but you cannot see the drug as the creator of his honesty! i smoke weed everyday, i never experienced any 'extra emotional'. when i was drunk i cried a lot! weed makes me feel better, it makes me realise things about the world. it doesnt make my emotions wanna come out, i think actually it pushes your emotions away. thats why weed is a stress relieve, you just smoke and chiiiiill. dont worry... be happy!! you think about the problems you have, when im sober i panic: ow **** i still have to do this and ow f*ck i forgot that.  when im high, i think ow.. i have to do that.. okay i will do that. dont panic, there are people starving to death in africa. i can get my fat *** up of my expensive sofa, walk through my brick house, go to my kitchen.. and just choose whatever i want to eat.  so.. i hope i answered your question. maybe he's just starting to like you more and thats why is starting to open up more.  sorry for misspellings.    and i want to respond to shortydeb: i honestly dont know what kind of 'stoners' you met, probably the assholes under us. believe me honey, i really do care about other things then getting high, and i really do care ho much money i spend on my drugs, and i really never ever abused any of the people around me to get the drugs i wanted, i cannot believe how the world got to you. you think you can put all the stoners in the same catogory; ow so you're a stoner, you are a junkie. i dont think i, or any of my friends are as horrible people as you made me sound. i'm sure you'll find what you are looking for but i dont know why you gave this girl such crappy advice. i would never listen to someone who catogorizes people like you do. the media got to you, and you only think of people for how do look like, or what they represent. everyone is an individual. the world is lost if we stop realising that honey. start loving, stop hating.
lVvtaBgsaa	Why not? It's fun...|`|vWEkopBQaa	Travel and Education,  Go for it|`|KrHCy9n4aa	I dunno, should you?|`|cLrkXn6gaa	Before join the Army you should think of a variety of things.  *Emotional state: Are you doing this to get back at someone? Why are you joining? Have you been having alot of stress lately?  *Reason: Do you watch alot of movies where the Army guys gets to travel to exotic places, meet exotic people and then kill them? Does it sound like alot of fun? The Armed Forces are alot of work. They put you through alot of indignant things. It is not all fun and game. This is war time you run the risk of not coming back. Or perhaps worst yet, you run the risk of coming back missing limbs, blind, crippled...etc.  *Discipline: They tell you when to eat, where to sleep and pretty much dictate everything in your life. Be prepared to give up everything for them, because they will ask you for it.  Make sure that you are joining for the right reasons. For the wrong person the Army can be hell but for the right person it could be a chance to be able to afford college. A place to get good work experience. A place to find community, comradeship, and a career. Good luck with your choice.|`|883108753f719db568096c99c5335aadaa	it's fun.          do it.|`|8b53e713d584ea5dc9761aeed373f037aa	I personally believe that all citizens should serve at least two years in the military regardless of the branch. That being said I ask you this what is it about the Army that has drawn you to this point that you are considering it? A sense of duty? A desire to better yourself? The opportunity to use some really cool gear? To develop your character or perhaps your leadership abilities? Maybe it is that you simply want to see the world or to gain a different world view? These were just a few of the things that went through my mind before I enlisted. My time in the Army was some of the most enjoyable yet miserable experiences of my life. I say that because there are many sacrifices one must make when they join the service. you will miss family gatherings and holidays. Perhaps you will miss a child's birthday or your wedding anniversary. it maybe years between visits with your family. the comraderie you will experience wil be like nothing you have ever known.  Having given you all the advice I can think of I leave you with this; If I were to go back through and do it over I would do it exactly the same way.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	That would be a decision only you could make and only you would know if it is right for you. While you are considering joining the Army also look at the other branches. Since you are obviously not set on the Army but are considering enlisting, you never know what you might see while visiting the Navy or Air Force recruiter that might excite you.    Good luck, this is a big decision and you shouldn't take it lightly.
v0ZvjE0Iaa	it really depends on availability and when you're willing to go. I went in on a monday and was at meps that thursday, and because i was willing to do everything quickly, i got a quick-ship bonus.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	Just about as quickly as you might want, but don't be in a hurry. Take your time and consider all your options. And as much as I push the Army, go see the other recruiters. I told my son the same thing when he was preparing to enlist. The other recruiters are generally right next door and you never know what you might miss out on for lack of talking to three other guys in the same afternoon.    Once you get to MEPS, don't take no for an answer if they tell you they don't have what you want. Tell them you'll be back later and sometimes that will spur them on to find the job you really wanted.    Best of luck to you!|`|KrHCy9n4aa	It's all up to you. Some people enlist really fast, some take weeks, months, etc.|`|jOC5EwkKaa	It depends on you and your Recruiter scheduling it, it could be in 2 days or in 2 weeks.    The timing is around you and your Recruiter.      And also do not feel obligated to go to MEPs ASAP, and if your Recruiter is pressuring you, tell him/her to ease off and let you decide the time. I do not mean waste their time by playing the "IF" games.    Good Luck.

rj5FE3Klaa	Bring it up with someone from another command.   Confront her    Try to find out what actions you can take to get her to stop skating and that you are not her payed worker.|`|014NXPfFaa	First you can't solve any problems unless you address them with the people who can fix them.    Let her know you think it's unprofessional for her to behave that way at work, and that it's certainly unacceptable for you to be expected to 'cover' for her.      Perhaps she has permission to leave work to attend those things?  I know my husband is sometimes allowed to leave work for certain things that may not be 'necessary' for him to attend.      You didn't mention which branch of service you are in, or what you do . . . I know the AF is very big on "family" and they do let parents attend school things and perhaps she is having spousal issues and may be in couseling, but she might not want to tell everyone so she says she's going to 'lunch with her husband" (I've seen it happen).        You should at least address the issue with her in a respectful, professional way.|`|nYY4nE9Waa	I had the same problem with my NCOIC (rater). He was doing similar things and left me to do all the work!! I totally understand you. I would definitely try to sit down and talk with her. Maybe she doesn't realize what she is doing. Pull her aside and tell her how you feel. Also, choose your words wisely and make sure not to accuse. Give her the opportunity to change. If that doesn't work go up your chain and talk to someone you trust. Keep in mind, the first thing leadership will ask is, "did you talk to her about it?" Keep going up the chain as far as you have to. After talking to my flight NCOIC we created a daily schedule where my NCOIC can no longer bail out when he wants to. Now, he is in the spotlight! Thank God!! I wish you luck! I know how hard it could be :)|`|CKQtOusTaa	Try talking to about it. Say that your busy and you cant cover her.|`|AA11585192	Well, its a difficult situation specially when the person doesn't realize what he or she is doing. I suggest that first of all, don't take it over you. don't break your nerves. Secondly, leave office on time, don't spend extra hours for her or spend extra efforts to cover her up. Do your job and leave something for her when she gets backs. Talk to her that you have some concerns. Be open while being polite. Tell her that you feel uncomfortable when she is not around.  I dont want to suggest you that be like her and ask for same exceptions so that she may feel and realize.. but dont know if it may work........|`|SkWzsnuxaa	There are times when you can't do anything about a situation like this. If you can't show your NCOIC that she is in the wrong, you other option is to go to the IG. But even there, you know the others in the office will cover. The best thing about the Army is often that all jobs are temporary and you or her will move on soon.|`|AA11593134	you said it is tolerated from E7s and up? Including officers? You should use your chain. If doesn't work, go higher. Someone would listen to you. Are you the only one who notices this? Get someone else on your side. If it doesn't work, you can go file a complain at the IG...  And yes, you are allowed to go higher than NCOs... Some officers are better at handling these, too...
DyNomQd0aa	i think it would actually solve a lot of problems...the prisons are overcrowded with people who are charged with crimes having to do with marijuana...when there are bigger problems to deal with.  i don't think it hurts anyone besides the person choosing to do it. it is a victimless crime.   and a side note there is a BIG difference between the effects of alcohol and the effects of marijuana so "right stuff" why don't you stop talking to avoid making yourself look even more ignorant.|`|SaxjkMbSaa	Bad Move--- If someone consumes alcohol to the point of being publicly intoxicated....they have committed a crime and are subject to arrest. It is possible to consume a small amount of alcohol without being intoxicated.    HOWEVER, the entire point of smoking Marijuana IS to become intoxicated....therefore this person should be arrested the same as someone who is intoxicated on alcohol is.  You CAN"T smoke Marijuana without becoming intoxicated.    I don't want some pothead stoner schoolbus driver  driving a schoolbus full of kids  down a busy street    Please spare me the nonsense about promising to only smoke pot inside the confines of one's home.|`|Ao3Fl3iSaa	Imagine the revenue the country can benefit from this.|`|b38a792bf2cb6a7cf64e2b3989db936eaa	Decriminalize it!

And...these are times of no money...|`|gvWLgYx4aa	Marijuana should not just be decriminalized but completely legal. It is so much safer than alcohol. It can help people with different illnesses. The legal sale of marijuana would bring in a lot of extra money into the economy. It would stop some violence amongst drug dealers. It would save the government a lot of money spent on incarcerating people for using or selling marijuana. There is nothing wrong with it. It is not a drug.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	I'm fairly neutral on this.  I would like to see it legalized some day.  I'd want it taxed and regulated in the same way that alcohol is treated.  I agree that the drug war has failed and we're wasting money on it.    It IS a drug though.  It isn't physically addicting but it is psychologically addicting.  Since employers have to right to require alcohol tests even though alcohol is legal, I think they should be allowed to test for marijuana if they choose to.  I work in a field where people can get hurt if they're high.  I've seen it happen twice.  The second time the man was on his knees screaming and begging me to get his hand out of the press.  I couldn't.  He screamed for 20 minutes while maintenance tried to get the press open.  Yes, he was high.  No, I can't guarantee that was the reason why he caught his hand in the press.  A company should have the right to decide if they want their employees to be high on the job.  This is especially true for jobs that are dangerous, or where the person can endanger others (doctor, dentist, lawyer, construction worker, driver, pilot, etc.  Where do you draw the line?  If an airline allows its pilots to get high on the job, do the potential passengers have the right to be informed of that before they buy their tickets?    So, those who get high still won't be able to get good jobs (unless they're politicians).    Is the government going to grow it?  What will happen to the prices of farmland?  With a cash crop like marijuana, who will want to grow food?  How will it effect our food supplies and prices?  Ha.  Wouldn't it be a crock to give farm subsidies to pot growers?    What are we going to do with all of the people in prison with non-violent drug charges?  Our economy is in the toilet even for non-offenders.  These people will have a really tough time getting jobs.  They'll need welfare until the economy gets better.    Yes, you can be too high to drive safely.  A daily smoker usually doesn't have a problem with driving but someone not used to it definitely will.  How do we keep others safe from the person who is too high to drive?  Do we have the technology to distinguish between the person who can handle a buzz and the ditzy broad who plows into my car after a half a joint?  What about the people who can't handle mixing pot and alcohol in small amounts?  I want the public to be safe.  Not everyone can handle a buzz.    If we're going to regulate and tax it, what do we do for all of the people who will be wanting to grow their own?  If we don't regulate and tax it, how are we going to pay for the increase in chronic bronchitis and the people who want treatment because they think they're addicted to it.  Already we have people who commit violent crimes who profess that they did it because they were high on pot.  For the type of people who will always pass the blame, they'll blame the pot (just as they're doing now).    And finally, we live in a country where the general population is intent on making tobacco illegal.  I think it would be totally messed up for the government to tell me that I can't smoke a cigarette but I can smoke a joint.    Like I said in the beginning, I like the idea of decriminalization.  But I at least want some concrete ideas on how it can be done and how we're going to deal with the effects afterward.|`|oRMJcPoTaa	It's really not the top priority this week.    If you think the country is ready for decriminalization, I refer you to the Michael Phelps story.  If we were ready, there would be no story.|`|v0PY0UDAaa	At the very least get rid of prison sentences for marijuana crimes.|`|HmXViQipaa	I would love to see that day! I think crime rate may go down! There should be laws though just like drinking. We are wasting tax dollars putting people away over some marijuana!|`|R0NfdgzLaa	well, the 'drug war' has been a massive failure.  drugs are more plentiful, more potent, easier to obtain and cheaper than ever before.    marijuana is not dangerous, despite the misinformation campaign that has been waged for decades.  it is not addictive, you cannot overdose on it, you cannot die from it.  it's hypocritical of a government to say "you can't use this, it's dangerous" while enjoying massive profits from our love of alcohol and watching countless people die from it.|`|1e9d3b83ee4eab612b90db60f5cea95daa	I wish.  It'd save a lot of money in terms of prisons, the court system, the DEA, etc.    But then jobs would be lost.  So it's a catch-22 in this economy.    I can't dig into my stash right now because I'm interviewing for a better job.  Bummer.  I'd love it if I could light a doob and not worry about failing a drug test next week.  Thankfully though, since it's *not addictive* I'm just like "whatever."|`|SGwkPy62aa	God I hope not.  If it had been decriminalized prior to the election, Bob the Builder would have been elected.  As to those who claim it is a victimless crime, just look at Mexico where approximately 15 are killed daily by the drug cartels.  Not what I would consider victimless.  I am sure the liberals are still going to say it is victimless though.|`|AA11626262	I don't even care if they legalize marijuana. Lord knows that some people with medical problems could really use it. If it could be legalized in a proper way, I have no objections.    I just don't want it to become another one of those things that everyone spazzes out for a week and then we never hear about it again. It's never worth the energy you use up in that one week of argument.|`|TfXoVfWYaa	Well, it's been decriminalized for theraputic use in California, and several other states.  The biggest problem with this is regulation - after all, the people selling the marijuana can just hand it off to drug dealers and the government has no way to determine who's doing it and press charges.|`|EenbVs8Oaa	Treat it the same as alcohol, doing this would go along ways towards removing it as a 'gateway' drug.    I've always marveled at that description of marijuana.  The only reason it acts as such, is because you can only get it from criminals.  Associating with such people in of itself is the real gateway to stronger and more dangerous drugs, not to mention putting far to many people in constant contact with said criminals.    Legalize and tax it, you would get cheaper product to the consumer and raise additional revenues for the state in addition to reducing state spending for enforcement of this out dated position.
iWrOmQemaa	Read federalist 10, it is one of the most important federalist papers written by James Madison.  It might be a little difficult to understand the first time, but just read through it and you will find the answer to your question.    Basically, Madison believed the common people could not be trusted (mainly due to being uninformed) to control our government.  He also understood the need for an organized national government, but acknowledged the need early on for a sort of checks and balances principle, to keep the need for another revolution at bay.|`|LgC2oA77aa	main reason: to avoid war among the 13 colonies
oRMJcPoTaa	Just guessing from a quick Googled look at the text.  But it deals with the importance of checks and balances in our government, with balance between the judicial, executive and legislative branch.    The public fought a war to free themselves of the perceived tyranny of a King who was not kept in check or subject to any balancing of interests at all.    Diluting the power of a single source would sound appealing at that point.|`|BRwPEuzAaa	Alicia, you should read that Chapter again and do your own homework from now on.|`|Q7ovix19aa	Give us the argument.  Was it, as were all the Fed. Papers, just propaganda for the acceptance of the new constitution?    I'd be happy to comment, if you make the effort to at least present the argument.

fAZvdAqXaa	Any rate is the worst rate if you are unhappy there.  Conversely, any rate is the best rate if doing your job makes you happy and gives you a feeling of satisfaction for doing your best to serve your country.  Serving your country isn't restricted to combat arms but rather any job that contributes to the organization's successfull mission.  I was a Navy Photojournalist for 23 years and I loved my job.  I was doing something that was important for the Navy's mission and I got a lot of satisfaction from doing it.      As for learning no marketable skills as a Ship's Serviceman---that seems to be a matter of opinion as you only get out of a job what you are willing to put into it.  If you were to look deeper into what goes into the job, you might be surprised bywhat you could learn about being a leader, running a distribution network, running a business, etc.  Should you remain focused at the superficial level, you are bound to come out having learned very little but the more you work at it, the more you will learn.    Keep in mind that it was an Army general that in the easrly 20th century organized Sears, Roebuck and Co. and made them into the giant they became later after WW2.  He provided the organization framework for their later expansion in a huge company.  Many military men and women have turned skills that they did not know they had into successful careers post-military.    Kssp the glass half-full and good luck.  One never knows where the future takes you.|`|3f967fb4e6bf1bbdec2bc7592e387b6aaa	If you think being an SH is bad because of the shipboard duty, try being a Quartermaster. There are very few shore duties for someone trained in ship's navigation. I got out in 1988 because, for reenlistment, I had the choice of 3 shipboard positions, including an 18 month around -the-world shakedown on the U.S.S Wisconsin, because they were talking about recommissioning her. There were no females stationed on ships, then. So, there was no shore duty assignments open. This was after 3 1/2 years on a ship that also made a Mid East deployment in1985.|`|8636dc634018e2903b7a4658723d7a91aa	Only if you let it be no rate is perfect, Should someone be that unhappy then ether get out or change your rate. All rates have there good and bad points but like all ratings one has the opportunity to get over on the navy with off duty education, get some and take advantage of it. Remember it can always be worse, SH's do not have to deal ORSE or other engineering drills or what ever the air department has to the same effect. Seems like you appear to be bitter  for not taking advantage of the programs that are there to advance your self on and off the ship or shore duty command.   I am a Ret MM1 so remmber we all chose our rate as well as our fate. Oh yea your sea tour is no longer than any snipe.|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	No, SH is not the worst rate in the navy.

9syZOhTgaa	When we had the draft before, all boys had to register when they turned 18.  You could get a 'deferment' if you went to college, but you'd be eligible again once you got out of college.  There was an upper age limit, I think 26 (but it was a long time ago and I don't remember).    As the Vietnam War dragged on, more and more boys were being drafted so they instituted a lottery system.  You'd get a number, based on your birthday.  If it was a low number you were almost certain to get drafted, a high number you were safe. Once you had a number you kept that number forever.    I had a deferment because I was going to college.  When the first lottery was held my birthday was no. 20, meaning that if I let my deferment lapse I had 100% chance of being drafted. The second  year my number was 360!  So -then- I let my deferment lapse.  (But I stayed in school anyway).    I wouldn't think the military would take druggies, but then we are really lowering our standards to meet recruitment goals.  I'm guessing casual druggies, i.e. not addicted to anything, would not really be a problem.    I really don't think the draft is coming back.  I think that was a 'trial balloon'.  The Bush admin. 'leaked' the suggestion, and if there's a lot of outrage, Bush can say 'Well, it was -his- idea, not mine.'  The reinstatement of the draft would be VERY unpopular, and Bush knows that, or else he would have done it years ago.    At this point, we have more mercenaries fighting in Iraq than regular soldiers.  We call them 'contractors' but they are actually soldiers for pay.|`|AA10730174	I don't think it will happen and moreover I don't think it should happen!|`|khyDdbZ7aa	dont listen to the freeking stupid main stream media..

Paying volunteers with no history of combat $20,00.00 to join up goes to show you how desperate the Pentagon really is.

daF5fuZraa	Oil, of course. Bush and his accomplices can keep ranting about how there really were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, but the truth will always be that Bush wanted more, cheaper oil for the U.S., and that was more important than bringing justice to Bin Laden and his followers, or any of the thousands of Americans that have been killed and maimed in the war. And by the way, more Americans have been killed or injured in the Iraq war than in the 9/11 attacks.

If he's still alive, Bin Laden is living like a rat, just the way Sadaam did while he was on the run.  The terrain of Afghanistan is extremely inhospitable, and Bin Laden has likely received help from neighboring Pakistan.    You might also have forgotten Al Zarqawi.  You know, the man who beheaded Americans personally.  He wore no uniform, just as the rest of the insurgents wear no uniform.  He was found and eliminated.    A rudimentary understanding of how military operations are conducted, the result of having served, always helps.    Will Bin Laden be caught before Bush leaves?  I don't think it's important, but neither of us has a crystal ball.    You overlooked the fact that Clinton failed to kill him when he had been located.  Selective memory?|`|uEM1p5b2aa	Problem is that Al Queda is on the run, and OBL is probably      from weak kidneys.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Probally because, for some reason, the Democrats just aren't enlisting to go find Osama.    We read questions on here all the time, " why aren't all republicans enlisting to go to iraq"    So my question is, why aren't Democrats enlisting to go find osama ?    And I won't point out, that the terrorist who bombed the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, was still free when Bush was elected, even though he was inside the US the whole time.    Last time I checked, America has 8 times as many soldiers in Afghanistan now, than we did in March 2003, when we invaded Iraq.    That doesn't sound like not trying to find osama to me.    Just because the media doesn't report what Special Forces soldiers are doing, doesn't mean they aren't out there looking.|`|ioCiw5zlaa	Best guess, there just isn't enough money in it for the Bush admin contributors.|`|khyDdbZ7aa	I know i don't have any proof he is dead,,but where  is your proof the Camel  F----R is still alive,,Al Zuwari and that Freek who grew up on a goat farm in  Morin co.

I wish I could figure out what is going on in his head to figure out why he makes absolutely no sense.

Even though I already sent in scouts to look for these bombs and they found none I am going to wage war on them to find these non-existent weapons. Forget the people who are actually a threat to us. Lets drop that mission and do this. (A few years later) Well there were no weapons...but I don't want to leave. Let's make Iraq into a democracy! Let's kill every terrorist in the middle east! I know this is not my country but I want to force democracy on them whether they like it or not because this will benefit the U.S. and even though these people have lived under a dictatorship their entire lives.  (A few more years later) Well they are not moving fast enough, there are still thousands of terrorists, the country is a mess, there are thousands of troops dead and Al Qaeda has reformed in Pakistan and they are back to pre-9/11 strength. What do I do now? I don't WANNA leave! Let's send more troops! I can do whatever I want because I am the decider and I decide what is right. Why are those people misunderestimating me?

As for Brown, he just talks in telephone numbers about the recession, does not answer questions, he avoids them by giving us a load of political bu**sh*t. But anyone who can apologise to a Chinese leader for being late, when the guy has the WORST  human rights record going, he is no leader as far as i am concerned. The joke is that we ,the voters were not even given a chance to have an election! Some years ago i was Pro- British, but i am not so sure now.The politicians are selling this county to the Devil.|`|cMHxg372aa	Excuse me, let me just clean this up here:    "Er huh?  Jerry Brown?  Are you some drunk Californian?"    Yeah, they asker would be British, and would be discussing Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister of the UK.    "Because I'm some drunk Coloradoan saying Good Night"    Maybe a good policy is no more YA after Coors, so as to not embarrass your state and country, K?    --    On behalf of the United States, I apologize for that as well as the other brain-dead responses of the right-wing zombies parroting talking points.      Brown The Clown... Now, what do you guys do there? On the one-hand, he's awful and his financial bailout is going to bankrupt the UK by the end of the year. You guys won't be the only ones, so don't feel to bad about it. I would, however, stock up on food and petrol while Sterling can still be exchanged for goods and services.    That said, perhaps the only worse choice than he and the pushovers comprising "New Labour," is the entirety of Tory establishment and Mr. Cameron in particular. Now I thought America had leadership problems... Thankfully, sexually-repressed American women from Kansas find African intellectuals exotically attractive, so on our side of the pond, the problem is being resolved. My suggestion: Labour ought to black it up a bit, and by a bit, I mean about half way in between Margaret Thatcher and 50 Cent. For the UK - I don't know, maybe a shade or two lighter than, say, Beyonce or Usher.    And if there are any Canucks out there - Liberals, I know for a fact that there are a lot of black people in Toronto, so what's the hold up? You guys have a power-hungry fascist ideologue bankrolled by Alberta oil companies, and who furthemore, seems to have an odd obsession with making Canada into an imperial power. For you guys, I'm thinking a black Tommy Douglas... A guy who passionately appeals to your historically upstanding national conduct and shelves fossil fuel development plans in lieu of leveraging clean energy by showing the economic benefits of such a shift in national economic focus, which will soon be clear if they're not already. Man, I'm pretty good, that's a winning message and candidate if I've ever seen one...|`|RYQ3i0ZNaa	Doing a fantastic job? He's only been there two weeks - that certainly is not enough time to tell whether he is a good President or not.    And no, I'd rather not swap. At least we know what we've got with Brown, and with him in power, the Tories are likely to win the next election. With Obama in power, we don't now anything about what he's like as a leader, and if he was Labour, well, it might reduce the Conservative chance of winning, so no thanks.|`|GcCdTgrxaa	God Bless the USA and all its people. May Obama bring that ray of hope and sunshine to all US citizens. :)|`|jKZkzfNkaa	If my projection is correct - as smart as we think he is, merely rubs the surface.

Look at what the Labour party has done, they've implemented Sharia law, have censored websites and have made it so easy to obtain British citizenship. The Labour party is destroying the UK and turning it into some quasi-Islamic republic. All in the name of "political correctness". It's disgusting and they should be overthrown.    I don't support the BNP, but the BNP would be a lot better than Labour. Jeez, what has Labour even done except got Britain into its oncoming depression? The UK imports more than it exports. At least the BNP would tighten on immigration and deport the muslims who become violent, instead of making concessions like implementing Sharia law.    They like to think they're becoming more diverse and multicultural, but all they're doing is allowing mass immigration of poor peoples from 3rd world nations into their country. It does nothing but put a huge stress on the economy.    I really hope Labour never gets elected again. It's idiotic. What have they ever done for Britons?|`|m3jb9qjdaa	How about you keep Brown AND take oblama......please?|`|i5FP4Vbraa	I have always loved the Americas, but I will not go into all the reasons right now.  I even liked George W Bush, but disliked his politics.    Anyway, I'm above all that, because I'm one of those rare Brits who has actually worked for and with the Americans.    I was the senior telegrapher for abc News London Bureau for 25 years.  So, I've had plenty of contact with the Americans and my opinion of them is very high indeed - esteem is the right word I think; yes, I hold the Americans in very high esteem.    I've got nothing to gain or lose - I'm a pensioner and not worried about anything nor do I have an axe to grind etc.    POWER TO THE PEOPLE    gwb makes fun of himself  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dii3mzMQ3...|`|YT127WSkaa	no|`|dhnR4bixaa	i agree.    brown has done jack all.|`|yDctxo1paa	obama sucks|`|ynlft41Uaa	Bow down before the Great Obama!|`|noo8vpvzaa	@Kit Fang:    "With Obama in power, we don't now anything about what he's like as a leader"    Neither do WE (he has no prior experience leading anything) and I'm in America...It's not looking so great so far either.|`|JQwL50JMaa	Fantastic job?  You must have impossibly low standards if you think Obama is doing a fantastic job.    EDIT:  I assume you live in the UK since you said swap Brown for Obama...    Honey, you should thank God you don't have to live here.  I'm from one of three states that's currently being forced to pay California's debts.  If the porkulus package goes through, we are all screwed to hell.    By the time Obama's finished with us, I might not think your offer to hand Gordon Brown over to us will be such a bad idea!    London's mayor is a prick, though, for not thinking it's necessary to do something about well over 6 inches of snow on the ground and more to come.

18167e6cb8bb213b37ad670e7870b7fdaa	There is no "legitimate" definition of race to compare it to.      All definitions of race are strictly matters of popular convention, and will change over time.      Obama is black because he thinks of himself that way, and because society accepts him that way.  This is as real a definition of black as there can be.      No it's not racism.  Racism is an ideology that seeks to distribute political power based on some definition of racial division.  The definition itself generally exists prior to that and doesn't necessarily have anything to do with it.|`|fAcVndo7aa	I think this debate shows how far we have to go in racial relations, more than any barriers that have been broken.  President Obama may be the first African-American President (his parents were African and American, hence African-American), but that's not the same as "black".  He's actually rather brown.  The color of someone's skin is not important, and despite all the laws and "progress" we've made, we still can't get people to understand that.    I just would like to say, we will only see true equality when we have a new President - and nobody talks about what color he or she is, might be, or should be called.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	This is why Tiger Woods said if he did not acknowledge his Asian mother he would be disrespecting her by calling himself black~  Tiger calls himself multiracial|`|NMaCcyeKaa	It's called historical precedent.  Throughout US history, half-black people were treated just as much as second class citizens as black people.  White people never saw a difference.  The only reason conservatives are making the distinction now is to try to diminish Obama's accomplishment of becoming president.|`|0f0dac4f4bfb6a4b2d01df90fd84b3ffaa	Being that most multiracial children look more black than they do white, yes. How is it racist if most genes that add melanin to ones skin pigmentation appear to be dominantly expressed? Obama is both black and white, being one race doesn't negate the other.|`|AA11327241	Historically anyone with one drop of african blood was called "black" because white folks wanted to classify and segregate blacks and whites down to the nth degree. Ever heard of an Quadroon? An octroon? White people were so obsessed with not wanting to mistakenly fall in love with a person of color they devised classifications to label any one with an ounce of african blood. Now that's Raciest if you ask me.|`|3KXBzSzfaa	Depends on the dominant genetic factor.  If the parent has the dominant white (rare) gene then the child looks more fair.  I've seen biracial children where their ethnic race was in detectable.|`|vet4adaYaa	biracial is what I call Obama, and yes, I have been called racist for referring to him as biracial, and I still don't get it.|`|cYuGYhGmaa	The history of colorism in the US.|`|KjkOT5rfaa	That's not racist. The color of the persons skin determines whether people call him white or black.

Racist don't get a blood sample.           What does it truly mean to be black?  I'm not.  But I have a pretty sharp imagination and the power of empathy, so I can live vicariously.     Truth be told, I think the way people view black people has changed over the years, racism isn't subtle but the look has changed.       The modern racist can except that a man of any color of skin can be an intelligent, well spoken, decent human being, but there's it's all those n*stars f*starring everything.  And any one can be an n*star: white, mexicans, asians. Anyone can be a n*star but we use a word that's origin is the color black.    Getting further off topic,   This has a powerful effect, especially when it is done unknowingly.      It seems to me that the modern "racist" has redirected it's hatred at the poor and label it with a word that means black, i guess so that we  remember which color is good.    Getting back to topic.  So we have the hatred directed at the lower class, the workless stupid leeches of the ogvernment, etc.     Becoming a president, birthed out of this lower class of adversity, would be a great feat for any man.    Did Obama overcome adversity on this level?    This is not to question whether or not he has had his fair share of ups and downs....  Honestly, have he risen from the depth of poverty to become the leader of the (fwee) world?   Honest question, i have no idea, don't do my research.    To conclude  If you saw him on the street without him being "President Obama, Lord and Savior" you would think, "dark skin- black"    and i think if some black people met him; were he just some guy with dark skin they might refer to him as "whitebread" and may even question his "blackness" simply because he speaks in a scholarly way.|`|QsQnFa9Daa	Racist??

Seriously though that is pretty retarded.  What, do those companies send checks to the Israeli army?  No.  Those companies operate within Israel or use Israeli-sourced goods and thus the have money flow in and out of Israel.  Lots of companies that do so have been boycotted heavily in the arab world in the past.    If you wanted to boycott products and companies that were sold in Israel and thus had to pay taxes to the Israeli gov't to operate there thus their money eventually making their way to the army, you could also argue that the following companies fund the Israeli army:    - Ford, GM, BMW, Mercedes, VW, Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Suzuki, and nearly every other carmaker on earth  - Levi's  - Nike  - Adidas  - Puma  - Guinness  - Hershey's  - Cadbury's  - Dell  - Hewlett Packard  - Sony  - Panasonic  - etc.|`|TfXoVfWYaa	Er, this is just a rumour.

Police departments with a lot of applicants will often have tougher requirements. Like anything, it is a matter of simply and demand.    If police departments can get a lot of well qualified people with clean records and good educational back grounds, their requirements will often be stricter than departments that do not get as many applicants.    With the economy in it's current state, it is harder and harder to get police jobs. Even for cities that are well off. I work in a suburb of a larger city. Due to a casino and a large shopping district, the current slide in the economy hasn't really hurt our government that much in terms of revenue (in fact, we are will probably still run a large surplus this year).    However, we have noticed a large increase of applicants for police officer positions, due to the simple fact that the largest police department in the area is currently in the middle of a hiring freeze. So since the big dog in the area isn't hiring, all the people who want to be cops are applying elsewhere, thus increasing demand for police jobs.    Bottom line, if a police department has 1000 applicants for a few open positions, they can be very picky in terms of mistakes in the past. If PDs only have a few applicants, they may let things slide. This can vary metro area to metro area or even city to city in an area. The best thing to do would be to call recruiters in the areas you are interested in and ask them their requirements and disqualifies for police jobs.|`|364u9d9vaa	I am not sure about the misdemeanor.. if you had it expunged and it's something you can explain to your background investigator, then you might be able to get past it. The marijuana is something they will overlook. Let's face it, LOTS of people smoked pot as a teenager. My husband is a sheriff deputy with LA County.. he smoked pot as a teen.. and when his BG investigator asked him how many times he smoked.. my husband said like 5 times and his BG Investigator didn't believe him. He said "no seriously.. how many times?!" lol. So ya.. if you've done hard core drugs then you don't have a shot.. but pot is pretty common. And it's been over 5 years so you're pretty good on that.

zhmeI443aa	I believe they are the same thing, if the country does well then i do well. I want myself and others succeed. I do believe though that people should be self-reliant and not rely on the government to give them everything they need. I think the government's only responsibility is to protect the rights of the people. People have inalienable rights given from "God", and not from government. As Republicans I believe we wish for the government to leave us be to rise or fall on our on. Our failures lead us to greater successes. For example Edison failed thousands of times to create a viable light bulb filament, but he finally did and lead to the mass adoption of electricity in the country.    I cannot speak for all of course and my reasons and beliefs are too long to type here. I can answer your other questions though on my personal beliefs.    1) Yes, I want small efficient government.    2) I'm a guy, and i don't feel right telling a woman what she can or can't do with her body    3) I don't know what you mean on strict restrictions, I think you should be with whoever makes you happy

Small government, abortion and restrictions on marriage serve what self interests exactly?    I am a conservative, I believe that the bigger the government, the smaller its citizens, and this has been borne out over and over again throughout human history.    I value human life, and every biologist will tell you, life begins at conception, I don't even see how this is an issue.    I don't believe marriage of any sort should be sanctioned by the government, gay, straight or otherwise, who the heck said the state could come into my marriage? which is a bond between me, my wife and God.

But fast.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	If you're convicted of driving under restraint in Colorado and the original suspension/revocation was alcohol rated (like in your case) you get both a 30 day mandatory jail sentence and a mandatory 1 yr license suspension. Your license is basically still completely suspended until you fill out the forms and they notify you that you're reinstated so you don't have any kind of defense.     I would spend the $100 in case it the hopes that it makes you look a little better, its definitely worth it if it keeps you out of jail. I am pretty sure you aren't getting your license reinstated anytime soon though?|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Whatever the end result, that $100 is well spend.    If you didn't reinstate, it will just show your contempt, it will encourage the judge to slam you with a huge fine and real long period of restrain.    It's always good to follow the officer's advice as he is the one that will file the report for the court to use. If he filed that you promised to reinstate and you didn't, the court won't look favorably at you at all.
AA11027376	The armed conflict will end soon with the decimation of the LTTE from the last of its strongholds.    Sure, Tamils will rebel, but against the LTTE for taking them hostage and using them as shield rather than putting forth their cause.     Tamils are safer and better in a Srilanka without the LTTE than with it, if the recent incidents are any indication.

Edit: North Indians are projected very wrong picture about LTTE. It is a common sense, how can a bunch of 2000 tigers take 250000 people as hostage?

The pricing and availability of that option depends on the area you live, though. If you want to go that route, call a lawyer.

d60812b54bd94ed9b890bbc6003e6400aa	Usually, women receive sexual assault convictions for cases involving minors.    However, just last week a woman named Janice McCarl, from Colorado, was arrested for the sexual assault of man.  He claims he passed out, possibly from being drugged, and woke up to extremely uncomfortable circumstances, the details of which I can't even elude to here.  (If you're over eighteen, read the police report on thesmokinggun.com.)    Also, in 2005, a woman in Norway was convicted of the sexual assault of a man.  After he refused her advances, she held him down and performed oral sex.  Apparently, he was too drunk to put up much of a fight.    Probably rare, and even more rarely reported, for sure, but it's happened.|`|Q7ovix19aa	I've heard about it occasionally.  Most mean they were not originally willing.  The words "persistent seduction" is probably more accurate, I suspect.    They could also make him ready and start while he is sleeping.

For love, spite and several other reasons. If you induce a man, not at his will and has no choice but to have sex with you it could als be called rape.  The man feels very dissatisfied after a sexual encounter he did not willingly participate. That is some form of rape.|`|zTq0NSGUaa	Yes, but for a male to say "Rape", either that man is a puss or a wimp; or never saw it coming and willing to file a report and sue for it.      I doubt there's females lurking in dark alley or in the shadows, waiting for men to pass by and force themselves on them.    Also, "No" means no!

Racial minorities and others she labeled as "feeble-minded." Sanger's depopulation targets included Semites, Latins, Hispanics and Blacks.  In her best-selling 1922 book, "The Pivot of Civilization," she called for the elimination of "human weeds" and for the segregation of "morons, misfits and the maladjusted," and for the sterilization of the"genetically inferior races" (from page 101 of "The Pivot of Civilization"). Hitler had similar ideas for the "genetically inferior races."    "Women DO have a choice. Women can choose to keep their knees together until they are responsible enough to bring a life into this world. That is the choice. Have sex and get pregnant or abstain and don't. That's got to be about the simplest choice I have ever heard. What the baby butchers want is not freedom of choice...it is freedom from responsibility."|`|oRMJcPoTaa	If you know the answer, why did you ask?    There have been lots of racists over the years.

As a result, Sweden have a hugely successful economy and well looked after rights.    In regards to America I agree with Obama.  The Democrats demand more in tax but don't let the, average, population know exactly where the money is going to right?  Until this issue is resolved stick with lower taxes.

MrGaUKIVaa	That is false. Obama was born and raised in Hawaii and attended Punahou school and graduated from it. If Obama was born in Kenya then it would be illegal for him to be president just as Arnold swartzaneger [sp?] will not be allowed to run for president. You can also imagine the research the government does before allowing a candidate to run in the general election or primary election, whichever one is second and only allows you to vote for the top 3 voted on parties.|`|Q7ovix19aa	He can't be.

Also, unless she went out of her way to mark him as NOT being a u.s. citizen then he would be a citizen by right of birth because of his mothers citizenship (remember shes from kansas) NO MATTER WHERE he was born.  Lastly if you take somewhere between $5 and $20 (cant remember how which it was) and send it to Hawaii's Department of Health and Human Services, under state law out there anyone can request a copy of any birth certificate in their records .  look at it yourself. i would be amazed if his family, probably not having had much experience in creating fraudulent documents, had managed to squeak this through on the nation|`|mwT1Ik5Jaa	If he was born in Kenya he is not legally able to be the president. Doesn't matter if his mother is a citizen or not.    John McCain was born in the U.S. Canal Zone, Panama, at the time a U.S. Territory thus U. S. soil and he IS a natural born U. S. citizen. All persons born in the United States, territories, Overseas Military bases or embassy's are U.S. citizens.|`|VH8q5HPaaa	He was born in Honolulu Hawaii. His father was born in Kenya. His mother was American.|`|9gsR6Xxraa	It doesn't matter where he was born, he still isn't a "natural born citizen" and isn't a Constitutionally legal President.    A citizen of the US is a citizen at birth by being born on US soil (Jus soli) or by being born to one or two US citizen parents (Jus sanguinis).US citizenship can be acquired by naturalization by a non-citizen after birth.  http://www.state.gov/documents/organizat...    A US 'natural born citizen' is a person born on US soil to two US citizen parents.   See PERKINS V. ELG - http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/ge...  The Supreme Court case of PERKINS v. ELG defined a natural born citizen as a person who was born on US soil to two US citizen parents. It was also defined the same way in MINOR v. HAPPERSETT http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/ge...    There is a difference between a 'citizen' and a 'natural born citizen'.   To be eligible to serve as the President of the United States, the person must be a 'natural born citizen' (or a citizen at the time of the adoption of the constitution) per Article 2 Section 1 of the US Constitution. http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/...    Mr. Barack H. Obama II was born to a US citizen mother and a Kenyan citizen father and was reportedly born on US soil in the state of Hawaii. He is a 'citizen'. BUT - Since one of his parents was not a US citizen, Obama is not a 'natural-born citizen' and is therefore not qualified for the office of President of the United States.    BTW, McCain isn't a 'natural born citizen' either.    (IF Obama was born in Kenya, and I'm not saying he was, he wouldn't be a citizen AT ALL because his mother wasn't old enough at age 18 to automatically confer US citizenship on him at birth. http://travel.state.gov/law/info/info_60...  If he was born in Kenya, he would be the first illegal alien President.)|`|caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	There is no evidence that proves Obama was born in Hawaii.    If you look at Obama's own website, he admits that his father was born in Kenya. His father never received U.S. citizenship. Technically, Obama's father is a British subject at the time of his birth.    There are 3 requirements to be POTUS.  1. You must be a natural born citizen of the U.S.  2. You must  be at least 35 years in age  3 You must be a resident of the U.S. for 14 years.    Obama doesn't meet the natural born citizen requirement. Even If he was born on U.S. soil, he ,at best, has dual citizenship. Mc Cain doesn't fit the law either, he was born in Panama.    All of this was brought before the Supreme Court for conference at least twice. The Justices didn't have the guts to rule on it. Try looking up Leo Donofrio vs. Wells or Cort vs. Wrotinowski (sp?).    EDIT: Lawagoneer- you are ignoring the difference between "natural born citizen" and "citizen". BIG difference. In this case the word "natural" means self evident.     And, Panama is not and never has been U.S. soil.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	There is no evidence that Obama was born outside the US.  They are deliberately lying and misinterpreted what was said by Obama's relatives.  In the phone call "video" the caller asks his grandmother was her "Son" Barrack Obama born in Kenya - THAT'S BARRACK'S FATHER!  Of course she said yes, and then when the Zwahili translator figures out they're talking about the President, the radio DJ immediately hangs up!!! (Lol!)  And an Aunt says "Barrack is a son of this village" meaning they are very proud of him because he has roots there"!  Again it means nothing and is no sort of evidence at all.  But that won't stop the internet bloggers and conspiracy freaks from going on about it - has nothing to do with finding out the truth.|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	I think you are a disgruntled bushist|`|1NO10YfPaa	The radio program lied.

Orson Wells did a radio show in the 30s that we were being invaded by aliens from space. Did not make it true.   Simple explanation for you...  Phil Berg is a nut case who started a hoax. Obama was born in Hawaii, has been investigated by legal authorities, has no obligation to show any private person his birth certificate...  And is completely legal/ eligible to be President.   Find a different radio station, or learn to distinguish facts from gossip./ rumors.  edit  a number of persons seem to accept the ARGUMENT that the definition of "natural born" is limited to someone born on US soil, to TWO citizen parents. In fact.. no judge has accepted hearing this presentation, and certainly does not mean that they would apply it to Obama.   INTERPRETATION of a legal question often comes down to common or logical intent. The widely accepted definition is that someone born IN THE US is a natural born citizen, while someone who becomes a citizen AFTER birth, would not be. Then you go into the long winded explanations of his mother having to be a certain age "because" the birth cert is fake, and Obama must be lying, re the actual location. The fallacy in this argument is that it has no bearing at all, when Obama has not lied about the actual location of his birth. "There is no evidence he was born in Hawaii" is pure bull excrement. The State of Hawaii issued a statement that they DO have his birth in their files. (and had that record been a delayed record, after a fabricated return trip from Kenya... it is totally insane that Hawaii would make that effort, if they knew from looking that he was born anywhere but Honolulu).   People fall for the irrational process that because something "could have" happened, that they proceed AS IF IT IS PROVEN THAT IT DID HAPPEN.  Allowing someone on a radio show, to give their version of this hysteria.. is nothing more than giving them publicity. Courts are where facts are determined and ruled on.. not radio programs.|`|xSgGELuXaa	no. you have to be a natural born american. ie be Born in America or have an american parent. so if his mum was American he was natural born.

1a2c7977e5e8dd3ec77d37f8abf5a078aa	Let's say that hypothetically Obama will cut all ties with Israel tomorrow. Two minutes after that declaration, AIPAC, John Hagee and every bible thumping American will scream and whine because they believe in that whole "Curse those who curse you and bless those who bless you" thing about Israel. Israelis are now acting as the oppressors in that region and people need to realize that they're being the tyrants that are killing. Palestinians aren't doing much of a better job at that either. Both are stupid children for fighting over a tiny strip of land because thousands of years ago two brothers chose separate paths and god said some stuff and now they hate each other and will blow the bejesus out of each other for some golden church on a hill.    How ridiculous is it that our tax dollars are going to fund this stupid fight that has nothing to do with us.|`|T3Tpgz5Vaa	Israel can nuke and attack any middle eastern country if it wanted to, and since they have been harassed/attacked for ages (as you acknowledge), they could and easily have the ability to attack 10 times as hard to silence them (Israel has asked to attack Iran and other countries several times and we told them otherwise),our government (agree or disagree) does not want Israel to destroy their neighbors, so sanctions are placed on Israel from doing just that, but we don't want their enemies to destroy Israel either, Israel is one of the few democracies in the area, thus aid is given.    So we either give them the green light to fight and protect themselves and we stop aiding them or if we are going to limit what they can do, and then that means we obligated to help.    I'm A OK with letting Israel go off on its own (without US aid or money) and doing what they believe they need to do to protect themselves, vs putting sanctions on Israels military operations and aiding them fiscally.    Are you?|`|5zBEU99kaa	A couple good reasons Americans should be concerned:    American tax dollars are paying for what is happening in Israel. If it were not for billions of dollars in aid and loan guarantees, and loans (that are ultimately forgiven turning them into grants) Israel would not be able to afford it's occupation and would have had to make peace with it's neighbors. When a Palestinian neighborhood including woman and children is blown up, you paid for the bullets and bombs that did the killing, so any innocent blood is on your hands as well as Israels.    Americas blind support, and active use of veto to block any unfavorable UNSC resolutions is a primary reason for Anti-American feelings the Middle east and a major bullet point for recruiting terrorists for attacks against US targets - including 9/11. You care about stopping terrorism, how about stopping a primary catalyst for anti-US terrorism?|`|ogzHWAz8aa	Most Americans take the Bible too literally and believe Israel is 'Chosen'|`|fZGEVA1maa	Your ignorance is amazing.|`|SGwkPy62aa	That theory only works if you are an island with no contact or interaction with others.|`|yTjVHsriaa	I like the Israelis and I had a good time in Haifa back in 1992. But I do agree that they are not angels and some of what is visited on them is their own fault. We shouldn't give them aid when they keep on building settlements in the West Bank willy-nilly. I think the smartest thing they could do would be to tell the Palestinians that they'll give up everything and go back to basically the 1967 boundaries including giving up East Jerusalem. I would also have them give compensation to the Palestinians who lost their land in what is now Israel back in 1948. Oh, and I'd offer the Golan Heights back to Syria.      O.K.,then I would inform them that they better leave Israel alone after that. If any Arab country or group ever bothered me after that I would simply drive every Arab in front of me into the sea!!

Do you think that how our last president reacted was honest? He did no better than the strapping of bombs on little children. He lied. Then another 4000 Americans perished because of him.    There are some in the jails that deserve to be there, but where is our Crystal Ball.?

AA10321118	The United Republic of Tanzania is located in Eastern Africa between longitude 29o and 41o East, Latitude 1o and 12o South.     The United Republic of Tanzania was formed out of the union of two sovereign states namely Tanganyika and Zanzibar. Tanganyika became a sovereign state on 9th December, 1961 and became a Republic the following year.  Zanzibar became independent on 10th December, 1963 and the People's Republic of Zanzibar was established after the revolution of 12th January, 1964. The two sovereign republics formed the United Republic of Tanzania on 26th April, 1964. However, the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania is a unitary republic consisting of the Union Government and the Zanzibar Revolutionary Government.        21st Dec. 2005-       Tanzania is the biggest (land area) among the East African countries (i.e. Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania). Tanzania has a spectacular landscape of mainly three physiographic regions namely the Islands and the coastal plains to the east; the inland saucer-shaped plateau; and the highlands. The Great Rift Valley that runs from north east of Africa through central Tanzania is another landmark that adds to the scenic view of the country. The country has the largest concentration of wild animals. It also has pristine sandy beaches and Africas highest and snow-capped mountain, Mt. Kilimanjaro. Tanzania is home to the world famous National Parks and Game Reserves of: Ngorongoro Crater, Selous Game Reserve, Gombe Stream, Tarangire, Lake Manyara, Mikumi, Arusha, Ruaha, Saadani, Udzungwa Mountains, and Mkomazi Game Reserve. Other Game Reserves include: Amani, Kigosi, Lukwika-Lumesule, Maswa, Monduli Mountains, Msangesi and Ugala.     Dar es Salaam is the commercial capital and major sea port for Tanzania Mainland and it serves neighbouring land-locked countries of Malawi, Zambia, Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda, as well as Eastern DRC. Other sea ports include Zanzibar, Tanga, and Mtwara. Because of its geographical and locational advantage, Dar es Salaam Port presents itself as the gateway into East and Central Africa. Furthermore, this renders Tanzania as a logical investment destination for investors.     Year 2005 General Elections: Since attaining political independence in 1961, Tanzania has held without fail Presidential and Parliamentary Elections (general elections) after every 5 year period. Following results from the Presidential and Parliamentary Elections held on 14th December, 2005, the 4th President of Tanzania, H.E. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete was sworn into office on 21st December, 2005 for a five-year term of office. Since 1985, Tanzania has followed a two term limit for the Presidency. President Kikwetes campaign slogan was New Vigour, New Zeal, and New Speed: Promoting Better Life for all Tanzanians. The majority of Tanzanians have been inspired by this and have rallied strongly behind the President. The country enjoys political stability and all former Presidents, Vice Presidents, and Prime Ministers live in Tanzania and are accorded respect. On 25th June, 2006 President Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete was elected Chairman of the ruling political party (CCM) by its General Congress.     Economic Policy Stance: The Government of Tanzania under the leadership of HE President Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete (popularly referred to as JK) is committed to the pursuit of sound, consistent and predictable macro-economic policies with low inflation. The policy stance is one of building on the foundations and successes of the 3rd Phase Government (November 1995 - December 2005) and scaling-up implementation and policy targeting more effectively and efficiently with New Vigour, New Zeal, and New Speed. Promotion of good governance, adherence to the rule of law, promotion of private sector development and opening-up new areas with high economic potential are some of the key issues of the 4th Phase Government. Expansion of investments, job creation, export expansion, value addition chains and scaling-up on human capital development are consequent and complementary actions within the policy stance.     One of the key areas of policy focus is promotion of sustained and shared economic growth. The 4thPhase Government is committed to pursuing pro-investment and pro-growth policies. Moreover, the Government is committed to promotion of public-private sector partnership and in this regard, the public and private sectors meet under the umbrella of the Tanzania National Business Council (TNBC), a forum of policy dialogue and consultation between the public and private sectors. Academia, research institutions, NGOs, CSOs and others, are also engaged in dialogue via a number of other forums such as the Public Expenditure Review (PER) designed to promote wider participation in policy discussions. Tanzania has a vibrant national consultative process that cements national unity and social cohesiveness, which ultimately contribute to promoting peace, security and stability, attributes that are important for a conducive investment climate. With such attributes, coupled with its vast natural resurces base, geographical and locational advantage, a large domestic market and a labourforce, Tanzania is an ideal investment destination. We welcome FDIs, we welcome tourists and we also welcome joint ventures and public-private partinerships.|`|AA12276446	It is beautiful, but sadly, it is located in Africa.

9tcv3TiWaa	If he is single then he lives in barracks, that is the housing he lives in. Only if he is E5 and above or an Officer after he has finished all his schooling and training would he be possibly allowed to live off base and get what is called Basic Housing Allowance (BAH) to pay for rent & utilities.   The barracks are like apartments in which some have individual rooms and share bathroom.  But many it is 2 to 4 to a room, especially during schooling and training.    Now if he is married he automatically qualifies for BAH.  While in Basic and schooling is under 6 months then it is based on his Home of Record (where he enlisted) zip code.  It is included in his pay.    The only other chance they are paying for his rent is in which he is National Guard/Reserve and this is his initial training and when he is completed he will go home.|`|s7njWYEkaa	Every phase...

Incessantly sticking to his morals and guns, even when his morals have been proven wrong and his guns are out of ammo (metaphorically speaking).  Willing to run this country into the ground for the sake of his own interpretation of morality when moral is something subjective and liquid.    Eroding strategic alliances in spirit of posturing himself as the most powerful man in the world.  He ironically eroded his influence in the process and made himself a joke of a leader.  He put this country's debt in the hands of the communists.  If you would have told someone that in the Reagan or Clinton years, they'd have laughed your butt all the way to Vladivostok.

nYY4nE9Waa	There are no guarantees with safety. In some cases Air Force people are deploying with Army units. It happens a lot. Military personnel are deploying way more than they were 10 yrs ago. It's hard to dodge it these days. It seems that I always hear about Army people going on not just one tour, but multiple tours to Iraq. So my answer is... you are taking chances with your safety any way you choose. The Army is a great service and I admire them, but being a female I think you should enlist with the Air Force. We get treated fairly well and in my opinion are a little spoiled. I've talked to Army females and from what I'm told it could be rough. If you like constant training and physical fitness go with the Army. If you want a laid back atmosphere with training here and there... join the Air Force.  I recommend talking to a few people before you make a choice.|`|sfCnE2O4aa	Look at it like this:    If the Army and the Air Force got mad at one another and decided to fight, which side would you want to be on?

And only few Air Force. Most AF casualties are because of accidents and not from enemy fire...  And we send our officers to bomb the enemy while we stay behind in the base. The Army and Marines are just the opposite.  : )  So you tell me... I'm in the AF by the way (but not female)...|`|cHBcR0Chaa	yes the air force is a lot easier and a lot safer. because most of the people who deploy with the air force fly planes or fix them. plus they hardly ever leave a base or fob.     The army also has a lot of non combat related jobs. go check it out. at least with the army you will hold a lot more respect then you will with the air force. people look at army and marines a lot more then air force.

Unfortunately it is doubtful that you'll be able to file a police report without your parents, because you're a minor. I'm sorry, hon. A police report is definitely what's needed here to get the investigation started. Is there a cop you know and trust that you can talk to?     Also, I have to say, you're very brave and smart, and I am impressed with your self-awareness as well as your ability to communicate your problems. You will go far in life.|`|7KZMMYjQaa	You seem like a very bright young lady.

You can talk to them without your parents but you should know that they will contact your parents. In any case, you are right about this guy being a creep and he needs to be stopped before he can harm more people your age or younger.

Only if your walking down the street like anyone else.  They can't just be like "hey we want to search you"   But if it looks like your lets say selling something like pills or drugs then no they don't need one.    They can pat you down and look through your bags [if you have any on you].    Also they can tell you to shake out your shirt.    And if your in a car they can search it.  They can't look in the glove compartment or the trunk unless it's open though.If you open the trunk infront of them then they can search it but if they ask you randomly to open it they can't.    Also if they tell you like "sit down lets talk" you don't have to, its suggested you don't because its all on the record and they aren't making you do it their suggesting you talk to them.    If they arrest you or detain you and don't tell you your Miranda rights then anything you do or say can't be used against you in court, but if its like normal conversation they can use it.    Hope this helped
DTSUJe2oaa	If you have not been legally emancipated in a court of law you cannot legally enter into a contract nor can you be held liable if you do, this article will further explain.~    The age at which one is considered a legal adult in the US is typically 18. What defines a legal adult is ability to legally work, participate in contracts, vote, marry, give sexual consent, and join the military. Being a legal adult under 21 does not give one the right in most states to purchase alcohol, however.    The age one becomes a legal adult in the US is largely the age at which most children are considered adults in the world. A few countries set this age lower, but in most of the Western world, one is considered an adult at 18.    In some cases, a child under 18 is a legal adult especially for the purposes of marrying or signing contracts, prior to 18. This is rare and tends to occur if a child sues his or her parents for emancipation. An emancipated child is still a minor, however, and may not vote until he or she turns 18.~

DTSUJe2oaa	They can become citizens after a period of time if they meet all of the criteria, this article will explain the process.~    Eligibility for naturalization  To become a naturalized United States citizen, one must be at least eighteen years of age at the time of filing, a legal permanent resident of the United States, and have had a status of a legal permanent resident in the United States for five years less 90 days before they apply (this requirement is reduced to three years less 90 days if they (a) acquired legal permanent resident status, (b) have been married to and living with a citizen for the past three years and (c) the spouse has been a U.S. citizen for at least three years prior to the applicant applying for naturalization.) They must have been physically present for at least 30 months of 60 months prior to the date of filing their application. Also during those 60 months if the legal permanent resident was outside of the U.S. for a continuous period of 6 months or more they are disqualified from naturalizing (certain exceptions apply for those continuous periods of six months to 1 year). They must be a "person of good moral character", and must pass a test on United States history and government.[5][6] Most applicants must also have a working knowledge of the English language.[5] There are exceptions, introduced in 1990, for long-resident older applicants and those with mental or physical disabilities.[7][8] This requirement for an ability to read, write, and speak English is not regarded as too difficult, since the test requires that applicants read and write in English.~

gasquENMaa	Unfortunately, yes he can. A public defender is something a person qualifies for. If you have assets or a job listed, the Judge may find that you can retain your own attorney and will then deny a public defender to your case.     Considering you are not guilty ( by your statement), you are far better off with private counsel to defend you in court. I am NOT slamming PDs, but they are drastically overworked and underpaid. You will get a better defense going private.    PS....I also want to add that Miranda ONLY applies to custodial interrogation. That means you are being held ( not allowed to leave) and are being questioned. Miranda has NOTHING at all to do with a court of law. The above poster is not familiar with the law and how it is applied.    I hope this helps and you can find it useful|`|xJmDP5NGaa	If the judge decides that you CAN afford one on your own...yes....    PS...The RIGHT to a Lawyer...DOES NOT mean the State has to provide one.....|`|ec6d6526154860f9cab361f34526d848aa	Yes - you fill out an affidavit stating your assets and liabilities and the judge decides.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	Yes he can if you have the means to hire your own lawyer.  You have a right to an attorney but you have no Constitutional Right to have one provided for free.      Like the above poster stated Miranda does not apply to this situation.  Even if you are in an in custody interrogation and invoke your right to an attorney it does not mean that the State (the Officer) has to run out and find you a lawyer.  It simply means that the Officer can't ask you questions without your lawyer present.  I usually just stopping asking questions when someone invokes their right to a lawyer.

Sticking with a plan long after it is proven to be a lousy one is not the mark of a good leader.|`|SGwkPy62aa	So I guess if Obama got up every morning and repeatedly slammed his head into a wall until he passed out, you would think he is a good leader.

z7JsVzcnaa	The logic is that if your nation has enough money to be giving handouts to the poor, then the country is doing something right.  I agree with this to an extent, but every strength can be a weakness.  It's nice to have the ability to help those in need, but if the number in need becomes to great, the great nation is no longer great because there are so many people in need.  Furthermore, spending lots of money on those in need could potentially ruin a government's budget as well with too much money spent on the needy and not enough on other necessary services.|`|nXLvDjqPaa	One problem with that:    Once everyones handed everything they need and it's extremely easy to come by, they start getting arrogant, rebellious and lazy. Once they reach this stage the next one usually consists of the country falling apart and no one being able to afford anything.|`|4vLt3SqFaa	I cannot agree.  If you had said the greatest indicator of a great nation is the freedom of its people, or even the charity of it citizens towards those less fortunate then perhaps I could agree.      But your statement is exactly the opposite of a great nation.  The indications of a great nation is not welfare but a nations that need not welfare because it citizens are active and hard working and those few less fortunate are care for FAR more efficiently by private charities.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	How a country treats the most helpless of its people, determines its greatness.    For the religious out there, Jesus said it also|`|AA11086243	are you saying like "general welfare" as in "how the people are doing"... like standard of living?    or welfare as in "payments to the poor"?    as welfare can mean different things...    your quote is more in reference to "standard of living"...and I think it is a very good reference...    of course, payments to the poor can increase the standard of living... so they could go hand in hand...    as some socialist nations, like Sweden, have VERY low poverty rates.. and relatively high standards of living...    but I think I would rate a nation based on its poorest vs. its richest though, for sure...    Mexico has its moguls... some very rich... even that media mogul, I can't remember his name... is one of the richest men in the world, if I remember correctly... but that doesn't mean Mexico is a good place...|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Actually, the surest indicator of a great nation is when it allows the freedom of choice and freedom to achieve.  When you put the "general welfare" of all it's people where the Government becomes the keepers of the people you tend to lose the smartest and the brightest.  As you head to socialism and communism, you tend to bring everyone down instead of allowing the successful to succeed.|`|aGzLO9Oraa	The surest indicator of a great nation is full employment and productivity while taking into consideration the rights of the workers as well as the needs of the employer.  Only at that time can it also give a hand to those in need.  A great nation plans for its future.  It doesn't make laws in haste that could lead to its destruction and demise.

8dd6860c003f14d0b36d1ccb66ce5531aa	It's rarely babies that are aborted, but embryo's and fetuses, and at neither of these stages of the baby's life, has it attained the consciousness to even be aware of anything.     It cant think, it is NOT a baby as we know it. So as far as i'm concerned, abortion is not the murder of babies, but an alternative to having a baby that you will not be able to love and/or support.     One could argue that during conception, the sperm that get left behind are "killed" if you wanted to take it that ridiculously far.       You try having a baby at the age of fifteen, or in between jobs, or with a drug habit, or with overprotective parents ,or by someone who's raped you. (none of the above have happened to me by the way) But I bet you wouldn't be able to cope.

It can also be considered a death that is the result of the negligent operation of a motor vehicle, which includes the operation of a boat or snowmobile. In some states, the term negligent homicide replaces the terminology of manslaughter (involuntary) with similar defining. Unintentional killing(s) in which the actor(s) should have known they were creating substantial and unjustified risks of death by conduct that grossly deviated from ordinary care summarizes the relationship between the definitions of these terms (Samaha, 2002, p. 536).

iaugc41aaa	Be careful Ricardo.    The items that you mention are all things that belong to the landlord.  Under English law, that means that you are not entitled to do anything to them without the landlord's permission.  If permission is given for you to do this and to hold the cost back from the rent, then go ahead.    The legal position is that you are not entitled to hold back any part of the rent for any reason.  If you do, you have broken your tenancy and the landlord is entitled to evict you.    Getting the work done should not take that long.  If it is being left, find your nearest branch of Shelter (see link below).  This is a very helpful organisation that deals with housing issues and will give you specific advice.

Who cares what Bush does.      I would like to see him indicted for his crimes, but it won't happen, as politicians cover up for each other.    Perhaps wherever he goes, people will throw more shoes at him.|`|mkMJYIJOaa	The thieves and Liars are now in power--oh--I mean washington democrats..but more isn't better--just a matter of time before dems start turning on each other like they do...    President Bush has a full life--and he'll probably do what obama fanatics--do--nothing..|`|oRMJcPoTaa	The Democrats have the votes to push things through over the Republican objections.  But that's not really a good thing, even if you are a Democrat.  It's usually better to come up with a plan that everyone can support in some way.    Bush is resting up in Texas and doesn't seem to be in any hurry to decide what to do next.  I will guess that he won't be too big as a public speaker for hire.
gqmtPx8gaa	If I remember right abortion was one of the big ones, as well as gun control/rights. There was also some issues with the Pledge of Allegiance being said in school and Dukakis' supoorting the state prisoner furlough program.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	Dukakis looked like a pretty good candidate, but he came across too whimpy.  The country went through Iran Contra, during which Reagan, and Bush Sr. who was formerly head of the CIA and hilariously claimed not to know about it, both lied their ****s off under oath.
QFag5xCQaa	Did you file a tax return for 07/08 - if you did and your tax liability was greater than zero then you will be eligible. Or if you are on a Youth Allowance you are also eligible.     Its being rolled out in April/May - no you don't have to wait for your next tax return
cZGh5ub7aa	There WAS Bush fatigue, but the main reason the socialist won was because ex-hippies and young people thought it would be fun and cool to elect a black guy.... I think they are starting to see their mistake though...    Look at this MSNBC poll.....    http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29493093/|`|JgJFWcawaa	Oh Good Grief!!!!!!  A mind is a terrible thing to waste.|`|40a37255449a9b40b7011ed1797f9b57aa	Yes you are.  He won because Bush screwed us for eight years and Mcpain/Palin were going to do the same thing.|`|muDV4uS6aa	No - everyone knows but they're just pretending to not talk about it because it isn't PC.|`|3pPFiZx6aa	That's not true. If anything, that's more reason for him to lose. America is a racist country, and he would have had a very slim chance at winning if people did not agree with his opinions.    If you look at the polls a couple months before the election, McCain was in the lead. Obama started winning when the economy started sinking. This signifies people's beliefs that he could improve the suffering economy better than McCain could have.    97 percent of blacks voted for Obama. However, blacks are the minority. Just because you don't like him, that doesn't mean that he didn't win because of what he stood for. I think he's not a bad president. I'm just happy the "bush-isms" are gone. (EX president Bush's made up words :P)|`|IjEv7Jjuaa	I totally agree with you!!   Everyone knows it's true.   They just don't want to admit it.|`|UDZGfGxCaa	Nope|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	It sure wasn't his background of drug use, and community organizing...|`|FKN9kBvLaa	Yeah, O.K.  With us (I'm black)  only representing 13% of the population of this country, and all the racism against blacks that STILL EXISTS today, a country predominately white people elected a black man to its HIGHEST OFFICE, just "cause hes (its he's btw) black".  Did you not hear of the THOUSANDS OF racists death threats and hate mail he receive, not to mention the blatant racism on this very site by your fellow Cons?  Truth is, he would have won BY FAR MORE if he WEREN'T black. He won because he was CLEARLY the best option.  In fact, the fact that he did win despite racism proves that he was just that much better.   Do you think the majority of America would actually elect someone they didn't believe in, just to be "hip", or "pc"?  You sir, have NO CLUE!|`|eUdBD4tPaa	Many know it but few are willing to admit it.|`|eHyJ9mYFaa	We all know it but we are not allowed to say it too often, we would be call the R Word.|`|diDNl3BFaa	Hate to break it to you, but just because Hannity, Limbaugh and Savage keep trying to convince people that the US is suffering buyer's remorse. doesnt mean its true.. Obama is still hugely popular, and most people are supporting his efforts.|`|089e8d35b7463b74daf5b60e025ccdc5aa	This is an old, old myth and has been debunked a thousand times on here.  Being a black man in America has never been a privileged position nor has it ordinarily garnered much prestige.  Besides, you have no idea whatsoever what was in voters' minds when they chose him unless you are psychic.    And BTW, whenever you find you are the only one who thinks something, it's smarter to wonder if you might be wrong rather than assuming the rest of the world is wrong.    Otherwise you end up believing the earth is flat.|`|GxgZAzpQaa	hahahaha . . thats a good one !|`|0XBVbGRKaa	so what! we would be in the same situation if mccain were in office.
AA12118274	Yea, thats not true.

Realy where the hell's islamia ?|`|d994b721c758dfa2855b28b038cde0a1aa	no.not true.president bush is nut
AA11511988	Both. It's not an either-or proposition, by the way. If you look around the world, you will see that countries with poor economies also have high pollution.    Because with good economies comes high standards of living and the ability to implement clean environmental policies.    So, if you're for good economy, you'll get a cleaner environment. If you're for a cleaner environment, the best way to accomplish that is with a good economy.|`|AA11478912	The environment.  I think we have more control over that and we can actually SEE the differences we make.  We have really no control over the economy.|`|AA10950023	economy|`|AA12020119	The environment. We know what corporations are wiling to dump in our rivers and air for a buck!    "It would be helpful if we opened up ANWR (Arctic National Wildlife Refuge). I think it's a mistake not to. And I would urge you all to travel up there and take a look at it, and you can make the determination as to how beautiful that country is." -George W. Bush, at a White House Press conference, March 29, 2001    SO it's OK for us to have high polution? When you have killed the environment, you just killed yourself!
AA10656997	We need a President that won't bullsh*t, mislead, or disregard the constitutional rights of the people.  Is doesn't matter what sex or race or religion they happen to be.  I can't think of any good candidates to suggest - male or female but I added a link that might help settle the debate between your Uncles. It is the website of THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN WOMEN AND POLITICS.|`|0cb7b9747d3f3a0838e1aa2df093916caa	martha stewart. we love to hire criminals for important positions in government...|`|361a952dcaad28e1ac5974c64736f88aaa	Hillary Clinton.|`|AA11567481	I would vote for a woman for President of the United States if she was a conservative. Some good ones would be Condoleeza Rice (Secretary of State), Kay Bailey Hutchinson (US Senator from Texas).|`|AA10820923	Mother Theresa would be an ideal leader... but shes dead.|`|AA11634313	which country?|`|AA12088145	By "this country", which do you mean? There are quite a lot of them out there, you know.....and most of them are represented here. A specific question will be met with better answers.|`|AA11590464	Being an outsider, I am not certain of the current American political situation (other than that which is reported Internationally). However, all the current female presidency contenders are simply not cut out for presidency. Yes, I think a woman should be a president, just not the current contenders, especially Hilary Clinton. A president must be able to make hard choices by him/herself, without help, without emotion, needs to wield real power, not sympathatic, and must be hard enough to withstand the fact that he/she is the president.|`|AA11623639	I don`t think a woman could make any bigger of a mess than the men have lately...    Who? Hmmmm, Not Hillary, I like her, but not her.. Martha Stewert.. That was funny, I thought we already had government full of criminals. She would fit right in then.     Good question.. .. I can`t wait to see the answers..
AA11315746	It really depends upon what the felony was for.  That being said, you will be able to get financial aid to continue your education.  Wanting to be a vet, at least you will be able to set up your own practice and not have to deal with employment applications that will ask about prior felony convictions.|`|AA10232899	Do you mean a veterinarian?  Just because you made some mistakes doesn't mean you can't get an education. It won't be easy and I doubt you will qualify for government $$ to go to school, but, sure, go for it!|`|AA12005427	You felony has nothing to do with becoming a vet.|`|AA11018650	as long as you didn't sodomize an animal, it should have no effect on becomming a vet.

AA10956319	http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/    These are the US Codes, which covers all federal law as enacted by Congress.  The Constitution is our fundamental legal document, and it forms the foundation for our government and subsequent law.  But I think you're looking for standard law, so the US Codes are it.  Most legal fields have federal components and state components.  For instance, in criminal law, there are federal offenses and there are statutory offenses, and the latter of the two is dictated by the laws of the state in which the crime is committed.  But the US Codes are a great place to start for researching US law.  But it's no short read by any means, so I hope you're looking for something specific!|`|AA11257519	Go to whitehouse.gov and learn how NOT to follow the USA laws.|`|AA10783313	try the CONSTITUTION and the BILL OF RIGHTS|`|6002797ea2e538068c833c0b431dd3eaaa	You could go to government sites or any large-scale educational institution website for answers.

Wherever you live, you are subject to a number of federal laws and a greater number of state laws. The federal government derives a lot of its power from the commerce clause (Art 1  8), under the auspices of which they can regulate a lot of activities which affect commerce between states or countries. That may seem simple enough, but it's a very broad and extensive power. This is why, for example, transporting a minor accross state lines is a federal offense. It involves "interstate commerce" (Congress shall have the authority to regulate commerce between and among the several states)    If you're looking for criminal laws (which I would suspect that you are), you want to look for the laws of the state in which you live. www.findlaw.com has a nice directory; otherwise any yahoo or google search should find you what you're looking for.|`|c0c7861deadae942cc1f96c690a6b871aa	http://www.gpoaccess.gov/index.html    Provides access to the United States Code, the Code of Federal Regulations, etc.

It's a case in study of the old "Tragedy of the Commons." Of course, it's not just this administration, and a lot of the cause can just be blamed on our culture as a whole. We have a low population density compared to other environmentally similar locations in the world, so we've come to over-exploit many resources with the belief that we'll find something else to replace them when they're gone and that we can just dilute pollutants to an acceptable level.

Quite frankly, the only people it is not compatible with are the highly conservative "Christian" extremists, a la Falwell and Robertson.  Quite frankly, they merely use Christianity as an excuse for bigotry and hatred.  Ironically enough, historically, those people who you and I would really identify as acting in a Christian manner are those on the forefront of the progressive movement today.  For instance, the Christians who were anti-slavery in the 1850's, or those working for desegregation in the 1950's.  The fundamentalists were on the opposite sides back then.  If Robertson was alive in the 1850's I have no doubt whatsoever that he would be pro-slave.

There are more than a dozen organizations that use that same acronym, and I know you are not talking about the Air Force Association or the American Federation of Astrologers.     Ain't no doubt about which ACLU you're talking about and we'll go with Protestant Christianity as opposed to Roman Catholicism though there's really not a lot of difference at the basic levels.    From the AFA web page:    The American Family Association represents and stands for traditional family values, focusing primarily on the influence of television and other media  including pornography  on our society.    Traditionally, Christianity has shared those values for a lot longer than the 30 years AFA has been around. The two are very compatable.     You seem very interested in the pornography issue. Pro or con, I can't tell.    And now we come to the American Civil Liberties Union. Over the fifty years I have been aware of their existance, they have gone thru a drastic change. The U.S. Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren took a left turn in 1953 and hasn't looked back until just recently. With the final outcome almost a sure thing, every social activist, progressive humanist and left-wing kook could get the ACLU to champion their cause and if the lower courts didn't uphold their law suits, they could appeal it to the Supreme Court and get their way. The Court took to making law and inventing "rights".     In recent years, the ACLU has taken a position opposite the AFA and Christianity (any kind) and has sided with criminals, athiests and, your favorite, pornographers.

74771107cf12e5c9ddbdb3fbcec702f9aa	The 4th Amendment is the answer to your question.  There is cross-over with the 5th Amendment, as it deals with custodial interrogation (interviewing), and whether the person has been read Miranda rights, and/or asked for counsel.       The 4th Amendment deals with arrest, (and interrogation/interviewing), search, and seizure.  Seizure can be another way to say arrest, as that involves seizure of the person.  The 4th Amendment is brought to bear on the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, and guards against unreasonable search and seizure without probable cause/valid warrant.  There is MUCH more to know...follow the link below.       As stated, the 5h Amendment deals with the privilege against compelled self-incrimination, and the applicability of Miranda on statements made during custodial interrogation...type in 5th Amendment at www.findlaw.com for more information.         The 6th Amendment guarantees the right to a speedy and public trial, voir dire proceedings, and addresses other fair trial issues.

Simple enough for you, you ignorant nimrod?|`|AA10566554	Actually we don't think pro-choicers are pro-death, bu they are not pro-life either.  Support or even acceptance of abortion (or euthenasia) demonstrates a lack of value for life.  That is why child abuse rates have increased since Roe v. Wade.  That is why child molesters get off with suspended scentences and probation.|`|AA10353573	I'll give it to you plain and simple. Anti-Choicers are hypocrites. The have a hugh problem when it comes to a woman making choices about their own bodies but they have no problem ignoring the problems of the children that are alive and well in our country. They have no problem with the killing of thousands of unborn and born babies in Iraq and no problem disregarding the millions of children dying of Aids and malaria all around the world. HYPOCRITES the whole lot of them. Stay out of my uterus and I'll stay out of your gun cabinet.|`|AA12333238	You must be on dope to ask this question.

Nor with someone so narrow minded as yourself, who apparently refuses to try and understand opposing points of view.|`|c968d4ade8486172ec8850c09357edd2aa	The reason is that the choice you are talking about is the right to have an abortion on demand.  Many Conservatives believe that life begins at conception, so the choice to have an abortion is the choice to end a life.  Therefore, it is easy to equate pro-choice, with pro death, or pro abortion.|`|AA11325016	The fact that you even have to ask such a question shows that you're not the brightest bulb on the tree, but I'll make an effort to explain anyway. That's not tomato sauce that's getting sucked into that vacuum cleaner, although it may look like like it when these aborttion doctors get done. That is a human life. If a baby can live outside the womb after only five months (and as technology advances, that time will shorter and shorter), how can anybody say it's anything but a separate, living human being? Where's the sanity in saying that a woman can have her pregnancy terminated even if the baby has started down the birth canal (partial birth abortion) but if she killed it five minutes later after birth, she would be guilty of murder? And some of these old canards like "The government shouldn't be controlling our bodies" are just crap. The government controls our bodies every day of our lives. From the things we are legally allowed to put into it to mandating seat belts or helmets. All we are asking is that the states should decide the matter. Roe v. Wade wasn't just a moral abomination, it was bad law (show me where the "right to privacy", the whole foundation of Roe v. Wade appears in the constituion). But you put it best yourself in your question. "No one in their right mind is pro-death".|`|AA12140861	Don Corleone; Quack you are probably some 99 pound crack head. But you can be whoever you want in avatar world now can't you?|`|AA11536322	Pisan  We don't confuse the the issue. The premise is life begins at conception. Ending life along the way because of "Choice" as you put it, one can conclude that you support death. If you practiced being a Catholic you might even grasp that notion.  Your name sake was a papist supporter and could comprehend the notion in light of being a killer. There are Democrats that share the Neo-con position but are not heard from Much. They exist never the less. You fail to include a minority position within your own party and helps to explain the political morass liberals like yourself are currently enjoying. Ignoring factions within your tent will not make your tent bigger. Killing off constituents will not enlarge your party either. By the way In Indiana the dead are required to provide ID to vote.|`|cb7cdde937cac7e0b7edbeb4bba46834aa	What do you expect.  They cofuse their *** from their mouth everyday.  How on earth would they be able to get their head around a concept like Pro-choice.|`|AA10356572	I dont even know what "neocons" are but here is my views..  I see a lot of "pro-lifers" who support the death penalty.. I know of instances where so-called pro-lifers ATTACKED abortion clinics killing doctors and other people in their act...  I know a lot of so-called prolifers with bumper stickers saying "all life is important" but on the front of their car you see TONS of dead bugs so obviously this isnt true...    look at the facts - if a woman is raped she is very unlikely to care for the fetus (or herself) and may be filled with rage towards it.. any intelligent person would realize this will have some effect on the baby when its born regardless of if she keeps it or not...  the United Nations has warned that human overpopulation is the NUMBER 1 threat to our continued existance on this planet - many people bury their heads in the sand that at 6.5 billion and growing we are not in any danger.. look at the city where you live - is it any bigger than it was when you were a kid?? how much bigger will it be in 20 years? how much farm land will it consume for housing? how much more pollution will it generate? how much more food and products will the people there be consuming? and at what cost to the planet???  it is estimated by scientists that if we dont do something about population that with in 100 years there will be automatic death sentences for people when they reach a certain age, simply to control population...    so that said.. abortion isnt ideal but sometimes it is necessary and who are you to dictate to somebody what is wrong|`|AA11967820	I am not a "neocon" but a Conservative Republican and I believe that life begins at conception, so ending it at anytime during the pregnancy to me is murder.  I just don't understand "pro-choice" , when there is another separate individual involved that doesn't have a voice. Someone must be their advocate.

A lot of the woman that are in that situation were born into these compounds, forced to get married as girls (12-15) and incest happens in these situations as well.

Stevens, President of the National Association of Realtors for 2006, "Finally, the plain fact is that hiring a professional pays off.

Millions of homeowners know it, and thats why they will continue to call on experienced real estate professionals."    Still want to save 1% by doing it yourself?

AA11384465	WW3 started on 9/11. In Dec 2001, Bush withdrew from the anti-ballistic missile treaty and that opened the door for another Cold War to begin. Enemy nations, such as the ones he announced were on his axis of evil, watched him leave the missile treaty and began announcing their desire to develop nuclear weapons. I mean do you blame then after we left the missile treaty? We might have just said.. we plan on making long range nuclear missiles.     Soon after, N.Korea withdrew from the NPT while India and Iran announced their intent to enrich uranium.     So you see, this so-called 'war on terror' is WW3 because repercussions from our actions after 9/11 are touching every nation all over the world.|`|df2da08c56595fad19dec6529fc73bc0aa	I really hope it'll just be a hoax and on April 1st, Bush, Blair, and all the other world leaders will be on tv pointing and laughing at us for we would've been had.

Then he asked how I planned ot support myself. I said with my credit cards.    Anothr person at the border also going on vacation got stalled at the border, the guard wanted proof of employment and a letter from his employer stating he was on vacation and was to be back to work by a certain date.

The safety of all people waits in your hands.  You are the dispenser of India's destiny.  Vivtory, Victory, Victory to you.|`|AA11128590	Following is a translation of the five stanzas which glorify the King:  as this anthem was written during English rule its referred to king  but king now a days means the ruler of leader of the country    1st stanza - (Indian) People wake up remembering your good name and ask for your blessings and they sing your glories.    2nd stanza - around your throne people of all religions come and give their love and anxiously wait to hear your kind words.    3rd stanza - Praise to the King for being the charioteer, for leading the ancient travelers beyond misery.    4th stanza - Drowned in the deep ignorance and suffering, poverty stricken,unconscious country? Waiting for the wink of your eye and your mother's (the Queen's) true protection.    5th stanza - in your compassionate plans, the sleeping Bharat (India)will wake up. We bow down to your feet O' Queen, and glory to Rajeshwara (the King). This whole poem does not indicate any love for the Motherland but depicts a bleak picture. When you sing Jana Gana Mana Adhinayaka, whom are you glorifying? Certainly not the Motherland. Is it God? The poem does not indicate that. It is time now to understand the original purpose and the implication of this, rather than blindly sing as   has been done the past fifty years.

The United States controls the land on both sides of the southern part of Guantnamo Bay (Baha de Guantnamo in Spanish) under a lease set up in the wake of the 1898 Spanish-American War. The Cuban government denounces the lease on grounds that article 52 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties voids treaties procured by force or its threatened use.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_...

AA12246476	What a combo! the name ARMY BOY and you want to go into the NAVY or the COAST GUARD.  No, seriously, either branch would be good.  However, the Air Force would probably be a really good choice for you as well.  You have the ability to be around airplanes almost anywhere.  The physical exercise is not that strenuous.

You'd do the best in prep for a civilian job & like the quality of life best in the Air Force. If you get transports, bombers, tankers etc than you are essentially doing the same work as airline mechanics. If you want to focus more on smaller aircraft typical of private aviation you can check into the training commands. It's great that you've picked a good career field, and now you need to really research all the services even if you don't think you'd want to go that way. There's pros & cons to each.|`|dee9faba460b0599ceae6e285fb60b8caa	if you like to travel and see new places the navy hands down. if you wonted to stay in the states the coast guard is better|`|e12bfc965095e7ab5d8c672f97767f5daa	If you want to be around Aircraft, The Air Force is your best bet.

All the schools I attended and the training that I received set me up well for any FAA Certificate that I wanted to persue.  All it takes is an FAA approved course and test and you get certified.  I've seen people get their A&P certificate.  FAA Certificate, and FAA Radar endorsements and just about anything else you would need on the outside.  Some courses you have to pay for, and some are offered free to help you pass the tests, but all the tests have a fee before you can take them.      You have to take the FAA courses though.

Berlusconi ci ha condotti ad un regime e tu lo rimpiangi? Con Berlusconi al governo eravamo al 53 della classifica mondiale sulla libert, e figuravamo come paese "semilibero". Le reti televisive erano praticamente in mano ad uno solo: Berlusconi, appunto. I programmi venivano soppressi a suo piacimento. L'informazione era nelle mani di uno solo: Berlusconi. Non c'era contraddittorio. Molti personaggi sono stati allontanati dalle televisioni (BIagi---->il giornalista pi popolare; Santoro; Luttazzi; Guzzanti; Rossi, ecc.). TI ricordi "l'editto di Sofia" pronunciato da Berlusconi?????? O non sai neanche che cosa sia!  L'economia aveva registrato i suoi minimi storici. Il parlamento provvedeva alle leggi che servivano per risolvere le magagne di uno solo: Berlusconi.

7883d62abda44661b0ede3349f955f32aa	Avevo gi risposto ad una analoga domanda, e cercher di aggiornare i commenti gi in precedenza espressi, pregando coloro che fossero interessati a maggiori dettagli di ricercare le risposte alla domanda di VENUS (partecipazione civica): "Ma vi rendete conto di quello che sta succedendo in palestina?"    Ancora una volta, la condanna unanime delle Nazioni civili per le esagerate e sproporzionate reazioni israeliane non riesce a fermare le azioni militari in territorio libanese.  Ancora una volta l'ONU - e soprattutto la Comunit Europea - si dimostrano impotenti ed ignavi di fronte all'alleanza USA-Israele.  Tutti vari capi di governo si affannano a dichiarare che "bisogna fare qualcosa", che " necessario fermare l'escalation", e che "certi eccessi non possono essere accettati".  Ma nessuno muove concretamente un dito!  Come  ormai storia, Israele cesser le azioni militari solo quando sar riuscito a costituire una "fascia di sicurezza" in territorio libanese, nella quale, nei prossimi anni, invier nuovi coloni, che renderanno necessario costituire una ulteriore e pi avanzata "fascia di sicurezza", che sar poi occupata da altri coloni, e cos via...  La dirigenza israeliana, forte dell'appoggio USA, sembra non comprendere quanto stia cresecendo il risentimento dell'opinone pubblica mondiale nei confronti di Israele e degli Ebrei.|`|89aaa2704d74923518ffd841512fdd84aa	che se la sbrighino da soli tanto non c' rimedio... inutile  una vita che vanno avanti cos, noon  possibile alcun negoziato...nessuno vuole cedere x cui a questo punto sono cazzi loro!|`|ff7a42d14ebb7029fbddefe400648b2faa	Che  ora che lasciamo che si ammazzino tra di loro tanto loro ci odiano che c...zzo li aiutiamo a fare poi vengono di qua  ci ORDINANO di adattare la ns cultura E CI OBBLIGANO a pagare per loro tasse ecc.|`|4ea0ca9e16b8241d5b5f836cd0fc03bfaa	Io spero solo che l'Egitto,come al solito non ci si metta di mezzo,  Mubarak con tutti i casini che ha qui e meglio che pensi per se!!  io vivo qui,a Sharm e la penisola del Sinai confina proprio con Israele,quando c'era festa in Israele,gli israeliani venivano a Sharm nei negozi a comprare e al mare!!

5f6c4fc8510dc115110f23ba28314912aa	Io penso che il problema sia ben pi complesso. Un'amnistia, per i reati minori, potevo anche tollerarla... L'amnistia approvata dal governo, per, prevede la clemenza anche per i reati di corruzione e concussione commessi contro la pubblica amministrazione. In altre parole? I politici corrotti che sono stati arrestati ora son liberi... E questa, guardate,  una cosa che piace ad entrambi gli schieramenti, destra e sinistra. NOI DOBBIAMO DIRE NO A QUESTO!!! DOBBIAMO PRETENDERE UN PARLAMENTO PULITO!! Lo stesso popolo dell'Unione, chi ha votato Ds, Rifondazione, La Margherita dovrebbe insorgere contro chi ha promesso giustizia e ci propone, invece, uno scambio di favore politico!  P,S: secondo voi perch Forza Italia si  dissociata da AN e Lega e ha votato per l'amnistia!?? (Forse per salvare Previti?)  Vi vorrei far notare che lo stesso elettorato di centrosinistra, quello militante che legge e si informa,  contrario al provvedimento... Un sondaggio su repubblica.it rivela infatti che il 93% dei 100600 votanti ha giudicato negativamente l'atto di clemenza voluto dalla maggioranza! E la maggioranza che fa? Approva l'indulto! (ad eccezione dell'Italia dei Valori).   Insomma, se siete contrari, non importa che siate di destra, sinistra o centro... PROTESTIAMO!!!

d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	To those who post to use a real site. Check the congressional database. This was passed into law in Feb 2005. All states are required to create driver's licenses with RFID technology by 2008. States are not compelled to comply specifically, but it has been stated that failing to do so will prevent citizens of the given state from being able to board aircraft or trains. These chips are already being placed in US passports. I am not an Orweillian type person, nor do I have anything to hide from the government, but RFID technology is a bit disturbing. We want to believe that they are these simple little chips that retailers use to prevent theft. The technology has progressed much further than that, and it gets more advanced everyday. If Americans keep denying the danger posed by these chips, we are going to wake up one day and find a new law requiring body implants. The one thing you can be sure of with government is that they will always take things to far if left to their own devices unchecked. Whether you believe in the dangers or not, I urge everyone to get educated on what these chips can actually do.    http://www.spychips.com    flbuffalo01: It is definitely a law as it relates to placement of chips in state ID cards. The government cannot force you to take a chip, but they can make it very difficult for you if you don't. I do not fear the technology in and of itself. What I fear is the potential abuses, and trust me there is alot of room for abuse. I cannot confirm the questioner's contentions about 2010, and required implants. My thought is that people should know what they are facing in the near future. As for it reducing fraud, I have to disagree. There are already portable readers available to interogate these chips. If implants containing all your personal data (medical records, ID info, bank accounts, etc.) become a reality, anyone who gets close enough to you with one of these readers will know everything about you. In my opinion more access to personal information is not the way to protect personal information.|`|AA11313161	no 666|`|0dabe2af8f42cf5c5f47f81982643269aa	i think they have raised a what if scenario.

The problem is that nothing listed that will require the chip is a constitutional right. The majority of the population want the government to come running to their aid when something happens. For example, your bank account is insured by the government against loss due to circumstances other than your own, IE theft. So if the government is expected to protect everyone, why can they not make it easier to do so? Credit card fraud and bank fraud would be a thing of the past with the chip. What few people actually understand is that the government already knows what most people are doing or can access the information. It is how they find criminals using credit or bank cards. If you live in a city, some day this week look around and count the number of cameras that are filming you everyday. Stores, banks, traffic lights, etc., they are everywhere.   It just hit me what chip you are talking about. (though I still have not seen the law and stand by what I already wrote). If you want to know what the chip is really like ask military personnel, they already have it for identification.    bryrose:  I'm not doubting the law exists, I just have not seen it on the news or had the time to look for it yet. When I checked your link I remembered hearing about the chip the military uses, I assume this is the same one, if I remember right the company is Guardian Angel, or I may have my stories confused.  Either way, I am very aware of the potential misuse of technology. I heard an interview friday with the Attorney General of the U.S. about the terrorist plot in London, he mentioned that he does not have an e-mail account, business or personal, because of what can be done with them as far as privacy invasion. I believe that we can overreact as well as stay protected. If people really though about it, many would not even have access to the net. All technology has a place and use. We can fear it or learn about it. Personally, considering the state the world is in, I am willing to give up some privacy for protection, I know the Constitution purists would disagree, but the founding fathers never had to fight an army that does not wear a uniform.|`|9f85b7155003a4e21ac1713679974bafaa	no way|`|ccfcba65c7175788681d7351db0204f2aa	I think your sources may be little wrong on this one, then again it is an overly libertain dot com site.|`|94cc0df1b4d028e986f1e8e25a0109fbaa	what we'll they think of next?|`|AA11922146	Unbelievable!

39981cc0007a340b5124d8f5c951cd51aa	I most certainly believe this documentary.

Rispondo indirettamente a chi trova una ragione pseudo tollerante e moralista al ragazzo ucciso, ai tennisti in pantaloncini e alla ragazza sgozzata. Qualcuno si erge a a difesa e tolleranza e mi sarebbe troppo facile dire e se toccasse a suo fratello? alla sua ragazza? a suo figlio? Sarebbe cos tollerante e "aperto"? Un giorno sono stato scippato da un giovane rumeno ma siccome correvo pi forte di lui l'ho preso e attaccato al muro e fatto chiamare i Carabinieri.(Aggressione di stampo fascista la mia)  Aveva (risultato poi al processo) gi scippato nove persone. Tra la folla una cerbiatta radicale mi ha gridato di lasciarlo andare perch anche lui  un essere umano e ha diritto a vivere. Alla mia risposta "dagli il tuo di portafoglio e non il mio" si  allontanata senza una parola. Morale: quanto  facile essere tolleranti quando i soprusi toccano agli altri e si pu giudicare tenendosi a debita distanza senza subire alcunch lasciando che il lavoro "sporco" lo faccia qualcun altro! Qualcuno lo sa che in Afghanistan molte ragazze si sono date fuoco per non subire la tirannia e le imposizioni religiose/medioevali del padre e dei fratelli? 50 anni fa c'era il delitto d'onore (discuterei su questo abominio) e allora? 100.000 anni fa vivevamo nelle caverne, e allora? Accettiamo che un padre sgozzi come in un rituale la propria figlia che si  innamorata di un cristiano e la sepellisca amorevolmente nel giardino di casa con il viso rivolto alla Mecca?  Gente, ce ne vuole del coraggio a essere progressisti in questo senso. Se catturano il padre e lo mettono in galera organizziamo una fiaccolata di solidariet a favore della tolleranza e per combattere l'ottusit degli italiani che non capiscono e non accettano usi, costumi e folklore sanguinario di altre religioni e culture? Ma per favore...|`|c43abcf478c36558125ffbfc8c630fd1aa	Credo rimanga ancora un mistero.

The Japanese didn't have prox fuzes for their Triple A during that time period. The only way you get that sort of firestorm all around the aircraft is from the use of prox fuzes - which were developed by the Allies in the Second World War. The B-25s ran a low altitude bombing run; hardly any time for time delay fuzes to be set properly to duplicate the effect. It's a high-velocity rifled heavy artillery piece (think neighborhood of 75 to 88mm) that produces that sort of fire. There isn't a grenade launcher in existence with enough velocity to push a round 10,000 feet or so. That "tracer" effect you see in movies is produced by smaller calibers. The nomenclature escapes me at the moment for what the Japanese used for AAA back then. Do your own research.    The movie was total garbage, as any historian worth his salt would affirm. Hollywood screws up its depictions of war and the military on a regular basis. Just asking a question based on that movie says enough about how pointless the inquiry is to begin with. Read some books.|`|7189cf4cf0abe5e599c44a65c65376a6aa	it is called a movie. same reason when a car goes over the cliff in a movie it explodes before it hits the ground.|`|AA10836898	What's the perjorative for Swede?|`|AA10950032	It's called FLAK.

The cannon fires a charge up to where the planes are flying, then the charge explodes, sending little pieces of metal through the skin of the planes.|`|AA11840343	If in doing your research, you will find out that during the Dolittle raid, the B-24 Liberators that Dolittle flew during the attack, were stripped of everything non-essential. They also flew at such a low altitude, a handgun would have been able to hit them.    Hollywood is wrong, again, Japan had no proximity fuses in their anti aircraft weapons. But it would not have been as spectactular if you never saw or heard what hit the aircraft when they got shot down.    And Natsugusa is wrong, they weren't B-25's, but B-24's Liberators, not Flying Fortresses. A B-25 would never have been able to land or take-off of a carrier.

The laws vary by state to state and in some states, by gender.  Many states have different ages of consent for males and females.      Most states will allow a 16 year old to marry with parental consent.  Without it, you will most likely have to wait, as it is illegal for you to cross state lines to marry without your parent's knowledge.  For example, if the female is 16 and the male is 18 (or older) and they travel to a neighboring state to marry, the marriage can be invalidated and the male can be arrested and convicted of kidnapping AND for transporting a minor accross state lines.     Marriage is also a HUGE commitment.  During your late teens and twenties you change so much that relationships (particularly romantic ones) formed during these years often wind up with little or nothing in common.  the best suggestion is to wait on marriage.  If you truly do love each other and are a successful couple who will stay together, then you will still be together later when you don't have to sneak off to another state to do it.  Don't rush life.  The end comes all too soon as it is.

One of the recent studies done at the University of Georgia among convicted killers of gay men has shown that the overwhelmingly large percentage of them (more than 70%) exhibit sexual arousal when shown scenes of gay sex. The core fear, then, for the homophobe is that he himself might be gay, and might be forced to face that fact. The homophobia can be as internalized as it is externalized - bash the queer and you don't have to worry about being aroused by him.    Secondly there probably just so bored with there lives there terrified gays may be doing it better or enjoying it betterand this unfortunately is very true..we do!    WHY do gays enjoy it all more ?    1..They usually have better jobs  2..Drive newer cars   3..Work out at the gym so have better bods  4..Generally dress better and look more groomed  5..Are kind to there mothers even when there bitches  6..Do not have 4 kids in walmart destroying the joint  7..Go to the theater more and understand it.  8..Have cuter dogs,and wash them  9..Have a lot of sex   10...Seem to be happier most of the time.  11.Have higher disposable income so help the economy......    someone has to help keep the rednecks in the trailer of there dreams .....lol|`|157b173f58bb84abd1e98e2a8bfc1ac1aa	One who is against homosexuals and homosexuality.

Desde el sur de la Pennsula a Marruecos hay aproximadamente 14,4 Km de distancia.    Las aguas del Estrecho son propiedad nica de Espa?a y Marruecos.    Gibraltar es otra cosa, es una ciudad peque?a situada cerca del Estrecho que pertenece al Reino Unido.

El Pe?n, adonde se le ha ido el pensamiento a casi todo el mundo, lo ocuparon los ingleses desde el Tratado de Utrech, cuando al mismo tiempo ocuparon Menorca (Baleares), que por fortuna recuperamos ms tarde. En varias ocasiones de la historia del Pe?n hubo intentos infructuosos de los espa?oles por reconquistar Gibraltar. Abandonados estos, lo que s hicieron con xito en diversas etapas los gibraltare?os fue salirse del pe?n y tomar parte del istmo apropindoselo, donde ahora est el aeropuerto. Su condicin singular le permite burlar toda la legalidad europea, al menos de momento, actuando de refugio como si fuera isla tortuga para todo barco pirata que sera incautado por la razn que fuese si intentase atracar en Algeciras, fuese por su mal estado de conservacin o por contrabando u otros diversos actos ilegales. Esas aguas territoriales que los llanitos reclaman como propias no creo que abarquen agua del estrecho. Ah manda Espa?a, y Marruecos. Una vez, eso s, no hace mucho tiempo, los ingleses organizaron un desembarco de tropas entrenndose, y desembarcaron, curioso, en una playa espa?ola y no en Gibraltar.

E c tutto il profilo grigio di Romano Prodi: un suo consigliere economico che prepara piani industriali senza il suo consenso (almeno questa  la versione ufficiale), lui che si arrabbia perch non viene informato e,quando  tirato in causa, bolla tutto come scelte aziendali.

cca82fc927dd5ec4332216e148a255a1aa	President Signs USA PATRIOT   Improvement and Reauthorization Act    "The law allows our intelligence and law enforcement officials to continue to share information. It allows them to continue to use tools against terrorists that they used against -- that they use against drug dealers and other criminals. It will improve our nation's security while we safeguard the civil liberties of our people. The legislation strengthens the Justice Department so it can better detect and disrupt terrorist threats. And the bill gives law enforcement new tools to combat threats to our citizens from international terrorists to local drug dealers."    -- President George W. Bush  March 9, 2006    Safeguarding America:   President Bush Signs Patriot Act Reauthorization  On March 9, 2006, President Bush Signed The USA PATRIOT Improvement And Reauthorization Act Of 2005. Since its enactment in October 2001, the Patriot Act has been vital to winning the War on Terror and protecting the American people. The legislation signed today allows intelligence and law enforcement officials to continue sharing information and using the same tools against terrorists already employed against drug dealers and other criminals. While safeguarding Americans' civil liberties, this legislation also strengthens the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) so that it can better detect and disrupt terrorist threats, and it also gives law enforcement new tools to combat threats. America still faces dangerous enemies, and no priority is more important to the President than protecting the American people without delay.     The Patriot Act Closes Dangerous Law Enforcement And Intelligence Gaps  The Patriot Act Has Accomplished Exactly What It Was Designed To Do - It Has Helped Us Detect Terrorist Cells, Disrupt Terrorist Plots, And Save American Lives.     The Patriot Act has helped law enforcement break up terror cells in Ohio, New York, Oregon, and Virginia.   The Patriot Act has helped in the prosecution of terrorist operatives and supporters in California, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois Washington, and North Carolina.   The Patriot Act Authorizes Vital Information Sharing To Help Law Enforcement And Intelligence Officials Connect The Dots Before Terrorists Strike. The Patriot Act enables necessary cooperation and information sharing by helping to break down legal and bureaucratic walls separating criminal investigators from intelligence officers.    The Patriot Act Eliminates Double Standards By Allowing Agents To Pursue Terrorists With The Same Tools They Use Against Other Criminals. Before the Patriot Act, it was easier to track a drug dealer's phone contacts than a terrorist's phone contacts, and it was easier to obtain a tax cheat's credit card receipts than to trace the financial support of an al-Qaida fundraiser. The Patriot Act corrected these double standards - and America is safer as a result.    The Patriot Act Adapts The Law To Modern Technology. The Patriot Act allows Internet service providers to disclose customer records voluntarily to the government in emergencies involving an immediate risk of death or serious physical injury and permits victims of hacking crimes to request law enforcement assistance in monitoring trespassers on their computers.    The Patriot Act Preserves Our Freedoms And Upholds The Rule Of Law. The legislation signed today adds over 30 new significant civil liberties provisions.    The Patriot Act Reauthorization Safeguards Our Nation  The Patriot Act Reauthorization Creates A New Assistant Attorney General for National Security. By creating a new Assistant Attorney General for National Security, this legislation fulfills a critical recommendation of the WMD Commission. This will allow the Justice Department to bring its national security, counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and foreign intelligence surveillance operations under a single authority.    The Patriot Act Reauthorization Tackles Terrorism Financing. This bill enhances penalties for terrorism financing and closes a loophole concerning terrorist financing through "hawalas" (informal money transfer networks) rather than traditional financial institutions.    The Patriot Act Reauthorization Protects Mass Transportation. This bill provides clear standards and tough penalties for attacks on our land- and water-based mass transportation systems, as well as commercial aviation.    The Patriot Act Reauthorization Combats Methamphetamine Abuse  The Patriot Act Reauthorization Includes The Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act Of 2005. This bill introduces commonsense safeguards that will make many ingredients used in methamphetamine manufacturing more difficult to obtain in bulk and easier for law enforcement to track. For example, the bill places limits on large-scale purchases of over-the-counter drugs that are used to manufacture methamphetamines- and requires stores to keep these ingredients behind the counter or in locked display cases. It increases penalties for smuggling and selling methamphetamines.|`|e61be0617b0a1f7cca29687431130016aa	You really must go to school at least once a week.|`|AA10583426	It's a way for the authorities to detain you without court orders or legal council.

Why did gore agree to let russia give Iran nukes and kilo class subs?    By Bill Gertz    THE WASHINGTON TIMES         Vice President Al Gore, at the urging of Russian Prime Minister Viktor   Chernomyrdin, agreed to keep secret from Congress details of Russia's nuclear   cooperation with Iran beginning in late 1995.       In a classified "Dear Al" letter obtained by The Washington Times, Mr.   Chernomyrdin told Mr. Gore about Moscow's confidential nuclear deal with Iran   and stated that it was "not to be conveyed to third parties, including the U.S.   Congress."    But sources on Capitol Hill said Mr. Gore withheld the information from key   senators who normally would be told of such high-level security matters.    The Gore-Chernomyrdin deal, disclosed in a letter labeled "secret," appears to   violate a provision of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Act, which requires the   Clinton administration to keep congressional oversight committees fully informed   of all issues related to nuclear weapons proliferation.    The Chernomyrdin letter on nuclear cooperation with Iran follows a report in the   New York Times last week showing that Mr. Gore reached a secret deal with   Russia several months earlier that appears to circumvent U.S. laws requiring the   imposition of sanctions on Russia for its conventional arms sales to Iran.    That arrangement also was kept secret from Congress, raising concerns among   some lawmakers that the administration may be hiding other secret deals.    Gore spokesman Jim Kennedy said: "It's obvious that the motivation for this leak   is political."    The letter "simply appears to be part of the overall United States effort to   encourage the Russians to break off or limit their nuclear relationship with Iran,"   Mr. Kennedy said in a statement last night.    The Dec. 9, 1995, letter on Iranian nuclear cooperation states that the two leaders'   discussions as part of a special commission had resulted in "clarity and mutual   understanding" on the matter.    The letter said there were "no new trends" in Moscow's sale of nuclear equipment   to Iran since a 1992 agreement. It also states that Russia and the United States   would seek to prevent the "undermining of the nuclear arms non-proliferation   program."    Mr. Chernomyrdin said Moscow's program of building a nuclear reactor in Iran   would be limited to training technicians in Russia, and the delivery of "nuclear fuel   for the power plant for the years 2001 through 2011."    "The information that we are passing on to you is not to be conveyed to third   parties, including the U.S. Congress," Mr. Chernomyrdin said. "Open information   concerning our cooperation with Iran is obviously a different matter, and we do   no[t] object to the constructive use of such information. I am counting on your   understanding."    A classified analysis acompanying the letter stated that Russian assistance "if not   terminated, can only lead to Iran's acquisition of a nuclear weapons capability."    "Such a development would be destabilizing not only for the already volatile   Middle East, but would pose a threat to Russian and Western security interests,"   the analysis stated.    Russian promises to limit cooperation with Iran's nuclear program have been   undermined by numerous U.S. intelligence reports showing Moscow is providing   nuclear-weapons-related equipment to Tehran outside the scope of its declared   limits, according to U.S. officials.    A senior State Department official, Robert Einhorn, told a Senate subcommittee   hearing earlier this month that Russian nuclear assistance is a "persistent problem"   and that Russian companies linked to the government are providing Iran with   "laser isotope separation technology" used to enrich uranium for weapons.    Asked about the letter, congressional aides close to the issue said they knew   nothing about the details that the Russian leader gave Mr. Gore. "All this nuclear   cooperation is sanctionable," said a senior congressional aide.    The secret Gore-Chernomyrdin dealings have become an issue in the presidential   election campaign.    Texas Gov. George W. Bush stated during a campaign stop in Michigan last week   that the reported deal on Russian arms transfers to Iran was "a troubling piece of   information." He demanded an explanation from the vice president.    An earlier Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement, also obtained by The Washington   Times, reveals that the United States would not impose sanctions on Russia   required under U.S. law in exchange for Moscow's promise to end arms sales to   Iran.    That agreement, called an "aide memoire" and signed by Mr. Gore and Mr.   Chernomyrdin on June 30, 1995, required Russia to halt all arms sales to Iran by   Dec. 31, 1999.    In exchange, the United States promised "to take appropriate steps to avoid any   penalties to Russia that might otherwise arise under domestic law . . .," says the   agreement, labeled "secret."    The aide memoire also states that the United States would "pursue steps that would   lead to the removal of Russia from the proscribed list of Internati|`|8af6aedaab41dd7e2dc91c5f3d5d106daa	Most of India is Hindu.

"Every year, over 90,000 foreign workers enter Canada to work temporarily to help Canadian employers address skill shortages. Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) and Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) ensure that these workers will support economic growth in Canada and create more opportunities for all Canadian job seekers.    In almost all cases, you must have a valid work permit to work in Canada.    These steps must be followed before you apply for a work permit:    An employer must first offer you a job.   HRSDC must normally provide a labour market opinion or "confirmation" of your job offer. However, some types of work are exempt from this process.   After HRSDC confirms that a foreign national may fill the job, you apply to CIC for your work permit.   To get a work permit, you must fill out an Application for Work Permit. A work permit is issued if the application is approved."|`|07d4542a0a479357134bc1712139f2abaa	tell them canada has socialized medicine, welfare etc. then tell them not to come to canada, soon you'll be over run with em.|`|AA10848003	SEND THEM PLANE TICKETS!!

What if they decide, that you can only be allotted so much gas, and you go over the allotted amount? What if they decide you can only have so many bags of groceries, and you go over the allotted amount? What if they decide you must drive this or that car? What if they decide to come in and take away all the registered guns? If these freedoms become outlawed then you would be doing something illegal, and punishable. That would really suck. It would fail to bring safety, security, or justice.

be8fd568f3f1d72ba5d7b7ebf00bf59caa	Yes really.....    Just wait til you go to get a good job and your potential employer has viewed anything you put on the internet. Blogs, instant messages, emails, websites such as myspace.com site and all the others. Anything put on the internet is considered public domain now. Employers and some colleges are researching applicants online habits before deciding who to hire or except into some schools..    So... everytime you blast your country or fellow Americans remember that. You may have the right to Freedom of Speech, but it is going to cost ya, and big.     You ain't seen nothing yet....    *chuckles*     Sure hope you kids realize what you are doing to yourselves. .      PS  Well Catarina... First I am not a sir, I am a ma'am. That is neither here nor there though. As for trying to make people afraid to speak their minds, that couldn't be further from the truth. I want for young people to take into consideration the potential ramifications both personally and for others of what and how they voice their opinions.  What I stated above is true. What you say nd how you say it here or anywhere on the internet can be tracked. That information can and *should* be used to evaluate the persons character and motives.     "If a potential employer is going to judge me adversely, based on my political, religious, or other opinions, then I am SO SURE I do not want to work with them. It is still a 2 way street. That's called the American Spirit, sir."     What you say looks pretty in print, it may work for a select few but it won't get you very far in the real world for the vast majority though Catarina, and you know it. If you really wanted to do these girls a favor you would explain that to them, instead of taking some idealistic approach that is going to sound wonderful to them *now* only to find out later in life that the world doesn't work that way. Also, your version of the American Spirit isn't going to pay the bills nor is it going to put food on the table.    Your interpretation of the American Spirit and others may be different. My version of the American Spirit is to remain loyal to my country. To not try and attempt *In Times of War* to undermine my President, regardless of what my personal opinion of what my President is. That is the one strength that the United States always had that made us so great. We remained United above all else. We've lost that and if we don't get it back we are going to crumble from the inside out. All in the name of your version of "American Spirit".  The "spirit" of the USA is so much more than one Amendment in the Constitution. Especially when that Amendment is used in irresponsible ways. I myself would fight to the death the right of all Americans to have Freedom of Speech. I just tend to believe that Freedom of Speech isn't so free when it is used in ways to rip apart our country.   We all will eventually pay a price that none of us can afford.|`|AA11826344	nah not really|`|AA11539308	Wow.

It has to to with what you are talking about. Interesting.    PS I just have to acknowledge what proud2bamerican said. I don't say anything on Yahoo!Answers that I am ashamed of. If a potential employer is going to judge me adversely, based on my political, religious, or other opinions, then I am SO SURE I do not want to work with them. It is still a 2 way street. That's called the American Spirit, sir. Stop trying to make people afraid to speak their minds.|`|AA11798742	That is nothing they monitor everything done on computers.

AA12244965	Republicans believe in following traditions. Which does include, following the constitution and also keeping religious rights out there. A big issue with them, is they're against homosexuals and anything else that is listed as "sinful" in teh bible or whatever the *** they believe.    Democrats are a little the opposite of that and believe equal rights, freedom, and believe that Americans NEED their help.    Like you, I definately go for the Libertians, whom believe that government should back the heck off and let us handle our own problems. But yea, unfortunately, it's mostly only one of the two major parties that will ever win... D or R.

Democrates are for social systems and more freedoms.  Unfortunately they want us to pay for it.  But on the other hand if the churches and businesses did their jobs the cost of freedom would be free.
3866716cc22726c6ccb7b553020aec4daa	I came from a similar background of international human rights work, then switched to domestic civil rights legal work and am now a 1L in law school.  I've found that law schools look for a number of things -- the analytical skills, the close reading skills, and the puzzle solving skills that the LSAT tests for are absolutely helpful for studying and for the (often quite) competitive environment of law school and 1L year.      However, there's much more to the practice of law than that.  Empathy, the ability to listen and tell a clients' story, investigation, as well as the initiative, broad perspective and unique cultural skills inherent in human rights work are completely important and in line with the legal profession.  You'll find some parts of law -- perhaps the clinics with heavy client contact, perhaps finding jobs, perhaps using your law degree -- much easier than your classmates.  Don't get scared off by the test.  The profession needs compassionate, worldly people.    I'd recommend the following things:  1.  Look for law schools with a lot of practical elements and which have a good, collegial atmosphere.  (Yale has this, believe it or not, but so do a lot of schools out there.)  Really talk to current students and see if there's a "rat race" atmosphere to it.  2. Talk to the lawyers from your organizations and ask them where they went, what mattered to them.  3. Consider deferring a year and re-applying if you don't end up in a school you like.  4. Consider public service scholarship programs (Root-Tilden at NYU is amazing) that give you support and a focus that is not purely must-get-to-corporate-law academic.    Frankly, even at a good human-rights focused school there definitely still are a good proportion of fellow students who are driven by success in a way that might make you uncomfortable. That may be because it's a success in a moneyed, competitive sort of way, rather than a driven-to-good kind of way.  But stick with it. I truly believe that there is a good place in the law for people like you and me.|`|AA10178541	Being scared and insecure will cause you to score less, on any exam.  Do not give up on something that you want to do.      If you had a high GPA in college, you will in law school too.  One exam is no different then another, just different words on the page.      Go for it.|`|AA11769063	You probably shouldn't be scared, though my opinion is that law school finals should be against the Geneva Convention. As far as admissions go, find schools that weight the GPA more than the LSAT. Now to your question: law school will use skills that are useful on the LSAT, but not in the same way. Law school is different from any other school. You'll read cases from which you'll gather rules. Teachers use questions and hypotheticals in which you apply those rules to teach you how to think. That's what law school's for; it's not to learn the law itself. You can do poorly on the LSAT and still do fine in law school because the skills are applied differently. It takes hard work, long hours, and a lot of reading/preparation, but law school can be an enjoyable experience. Besides, as long as you don't flunk out, you can get a job. It may not be a great one, but after that, employers don't care about your grades--only your job performance. If you do well in your job, you'll get better jobs. Law school is a great experience, and even if you're in the bottom of your class, you're getting a great education.

cc478a76ead63d939834df89f8a19807aa	Te voy a proponer algo revolucionario que est escrito en nuestra Constitucin que nadie cumple ni siquiera el Parlamento; resulta que la Constitucin habla del trabajo digno, del derecho a una vivienda digna, del derecho a la vida digna, a la sanidad, y pone que los espa?oles tenemos derechos a esas dignidades.    ?Cierto?.- bueno, pues voy a solucionar el problema de la vivienda digna para todos los espa?oles; si me sigues lo comprenders y me dars la razn salvo que tengas miles de viviendas a tu nombre.    Las cosas bsicas que habla la Constitucin denominandolas como derechos a la dignidad de la persona, no deben ser objeto de mercantilismos, ni objeto de inversiones con nimo de lucro y menos con fines especulativos, son derechos de la dignidad humana.     Por tanto nadie puede invertir en sanidad con el objeto de lucro, nadie puede invertir en educacin o comprando hospitales con objeto de lucro, de sacar el mximo de beneficio y con fines especulativos, porque en ese momento excluiriamos de su derecho a la dignidad a millones de personas y la Carta Magna de la Constitucin declararan esas inversiones legales en cuanto que se hubieran invertido en mejorar algo que afecta a la dignidad del pueblo;  pero ilegales en cuanto que se haya hecho con nimo de lucro, de sacar beneficios desorbitados o de especulacin con intento de provocar la subida de precios fuera del alcance de los sueldos o pagas de los trabajadores espa?oles, de su nivel de renta media.    Por tanto todos los inversionistas en viviendas, como cajas y Bancos que poseen miles de viviendas a su nombre, cuando han comprado o construido esas viviendas con fines especulativos de sacar el mximo de dinero, de encarecer los precios estn contraviniendo la carta Magna de la Constitucin, y la de derechos humanos.     Pues estn haciendo algo ilegal, estn poniendo precios por encima del alcance de la renta media familiar , del derecho a la vivienda digna y estn impediendo que un derecho a la vivienda digna se convierta en algo imposible, y lo mismo rige para las personas que han invertido en pisos, viviendas su dinero para sacar el mximo de rentabilidad.     Pues la vivienda es un derecho digno que no debe estar sometido a especulacin y debe de tener un justiprecio el alcance a las familias que las necesitan.    Por tanto, tanto los que tienen miles de viviendas a su nombre como los que han comprado diez o doce viviendas con fines especulativos y comerciales de compra venta y renta, han sido vctimas de un timo del toco mocho, han comprado algo que la Constitucin dice que pertenece a la dignidad de la persona, y no debe estr sometida a especulaciones ni a obtener beneficios especulativos y el Estado debe poner el precio digno, el justiprecio al uso y propiedad de la vivienda digna.    Ya que en un sistema capitalista y con nuestra Carta Magna Constitucional los beneficios de la empresa se invierten en empresas para sacar dinero, en mercados en supermercados, en gasolineras, en la bolsa, en fbricas etc.      Pero no se deben invertir para sacar revalorizaciones y especulaciones en asuntos que afectan a la dignidad de la persona,vivienda digna, colegios dignos, hospitales dignos; a no ser que la intencin sea mejorar los servicios y sin nimo de lucro ni especulativos.    Asi pues que tiemblen si me nombran presidente los Bancos y las Cajas de Ahorro y los Empresarios que tienen miles de viviendas pes no les voy a dejar sacar miles de millones de euros de beneficios a costa de acabar con el derecho a vivienda digna de los espa?oles, a costa de acabar con el derecho al trabajo digno de espa?oles,    Hagan lo que quieran pero si me votan atengans a las consecuencias, POR VIVIENDA DIGNA, POR TRABAJO DIGNO, POR UN CUMPLIMIENTO DE LA CONSTITUCIN.

AA10515896	It varies by state. 48 States currently disenfranchise ex-felons, either temporarily (until the probation is up), indefinitely (until they jump through administrative hoops), or permanently.    The justification comes from an obscure clause in the 14th Amendment, which prohibits states from disenfranchising people based on race, except for felons. This was interpreted by the Supreme Court as authority to disenfranchise felons, since there is no constitutional punishment for doing so.|`|9ff3de46869c48c98a9f96cb9dfedfabaa	They can't, in US.

f13b44ddf2f91d1aaba20581070bd1d1aa	The Bush Administration hasn't taken responsibility for a damned thing. They blame Clinton for the present and their opposers for the future.

Hell, without 9/11 Bush might have lost the election, hmmm|`|AA12055702	no, because whatever happens in the war world ha little to do with the senate, and even the president of America. you see, its almost always done by the jews. in the case of 9/11, it was Paul Wolfowitz (and of course the assistance of Dick Cheney). Bush only supported it, not strated the war. not on his own, anywayz.    In the palestine war, it was Ariel Sharon, who i think is still a vegetable, unless i am very much mistaken.    so, in answer to your question i dont think the senate or congress are interested in a war itself. they just want to fight the Muslims and also they care about money. but its shameful to see that even Muslims dont know this and they support this so-called WAR ON TERROR, when its plain to see that the real terrorists are the jews and to a very large extent the US government.    i am not saying this merely because i am Muslim, because i know that even many non-Muslims (including Jews) that have opposed these QUESTS FOR FREEDOM and hav opposed to the americans fighting Muslims. so dont think im being biased. i am speaking the truth.|`|2e5a05139a03b737b3d41c1fc73cf990aa	If it happened tomorrow, it wouldn't be anyones 'fault'. But, you should know that even the liberal networks are reporting that the terrorists may now be 'more' emboldened by their own perception that America is now 'weaker'.

The fault ALWAYS lies with the ******* comitting the acts of terror.  It's is boobish to suggest the fault would lie with either party.  Islamofacists are Islamofacists, no matter who sits in political majority here in the states.  They are people(a term I use in it's loosest form) who want you dead because you don't believe as they do. End of story.  No peace exists, and the threat of another attack on our soils will always loom, without regard to which party controls the house.      That "you can see the Bush regime grabbing on...etc" is irrelevant.  The Cole was attacked on Clinton's watch, as well as the 1st attempt at bombing the WTC.  Only conspiracy theorists on both sides of the aisle have blamed Clinton for that, as well as blaming Bush for 9/11.  It is a waste of brain power to wag a finger and try to find fault, when that power could be better spent eliminaing America's enemies.      Your question is bogus speculation. Nothing more.|`|AA10595128	If there were a terrorist attack tomorrow, blame should be placed where it belongs, on the terrorists.

But, yeah I'm sure he would blame the democrats and convince the country to vote for Jeb in 2008!|`|517c1dbab655579531f88760dacca166aa	This is pure speculation, and if you'll allow me to speculate...my guess is that the next attack, if and when it ever happens, will have to be economically connected.      If (perhaps) all pharmaceutical companies collude, then maybe an event could be planned to keep them flourishing since it may require widespread use of their products.    This is how capitalism works.    Example:    Hershey Foods is not contented to see sales exceeding year after year, now they want you to buy 10 bars for $10.00, and grow you to be fat as a pig!    You see this pricing scheme in every super market today, and if this doesn't explain to you how capitalism works, then you'll never understand.

For most of us, that message started with our first history class, where we were told that this country was founded by upstanding, property-owning folk in New England and Virginia.  In fact, the American Revolution was begun by people who didn't own anything, people who were the ancestors of today's downsized and underemployed. It's time to tell their story because we need their fighting spirit back again.  The first battle of the American Revolution was the Boston Massacre of March 1770. At that time, Boston had been occupied by British troops for 17 long months. The poor of Boston hated that occupation every bit as much as the residents of today's inner cities hate the police occupation of their neighborhoods.  All through the long winter of 1769, soldiers and citizens had clashed in street brawls and tavern fights. March 5, 1770 began as a cold and gray day. That evening, a small crowd gathered around a British sentry, accusing him of striking a young boy with his musket. The members of the crowd began hurling insults (and any missile they could find) at grenadiers who arrived to reinforce the sentry. The soldiers started shooting. By the time they were finished, "half a pail of blood" had been spilled into the snow, according to one eyewitness.  The first man to die -- the first martyr of American Independence -- was a black man named Crispus Attucks, a native of Framingham, Massachusetts. He had escaped from slavery in 1750 and had gone to sea as a sailor.  In total, five people were killed. Samuel Gray was a ropemaker; James Caldwell was a sailor; Samuel Maverick was a 17-year-old apprentice and Patrick Carr a leather worker. Carr was an Irish immigrant.  The massacre provoked outrage. On March 8, about 10,000 of Boston's 16,000 inhabitants took part in the funeral procession of the martyrs. (At the time, this was the largest procession to ever have taken place in North America.) Attucks, Caldwell, Gray and Maverick were buried in the same grave. Nine days later, Carr's body joined theirs.  The British troops were put on trial. Their lead defense attorney was John Adams, a wealthy lawyer who later became the second president of the United States. In his closing remarks to the jury, Adams said the killings were justified and blamed the violence on the immigrant (Patrick Carr from Ireland) and the black man (Crispus Attucks). He called the crowd on King Street "a mob" and "a motley rabble of saucy boys, negroes and molattoes, Irish teagues and outlandish jack tarrs." ("Teague" is a despicable term of contempt for Irish Catholics, similar to the "n-word" for blacks. A "jack tarr" is a sailor.)  All but two of the soldiers were acquitted, in part because of Adams' demagogic speech. Adams' statements show the contempt which America's elite has always felt for the country's have-nots. In colonial times, the poor were called "the mob" or "the rabble." Today, the unemployed and underemployed are referred to as "the underclass." The names change, but the game remains the same.  In recent years, it has become fashionable for ruling-class historians to downplay the Boston Massacre. Some dismiss it as a minor "riot" (in the same way that the Los Angeles Rebellion of 1992 is trivialized by calling it a "riot.") But nothing can change the fact that the Boston Massacre started the American Revolution. "From that moment," Daniel Webster said, "we may date the severance of the British Empire."  It was not until 1887 that Boston authorized the erection of a monument to the martyrs in Boston Common. On it are the words of John Boyle O'Reilly:  "And honor to Crispus Attucks, who was leader and voice that day:  The first to defy, and the first to die, with Maverick, Carr and Gray.  Call it riot or revolution, or mob or crowd as you may,  Such deaths have been seed of nations, such lives shall be honored for ay ..."  Every year on March 5, we would do well to remember how the American Revolution began. While slaveowners and other wealthy people eventually wormed their way into the leadership of the revolution, they did not shed its first blood. The first man to die in the American Revolution was a black man. Since that man was a runaway slave compelled to use an assumed name, he was, in a sense, an "illegal." Another of the casualties in that first engagement was an immigrant. A third was a teen-ager. And all five who died were workers. They now sleep forever in the same grave in the Old Granary Burial Ground in downtown Boston, a symbol of the unity of America's poor -- black and white, immigrant and native-born, "legal" and "illegal," young and old.  When I visited Boston in 1996, I saw homeless people of different nationalities shivering in the April cold just a few feet outside that cemetery's gates. Clearly, we once again need the unity of the poor which "the rabble" displayed on King Street in 1770. Without it, we won't be able to take back the country which the martyrs of March 5, 1770 helped create.
407f2f3df56644b5cae9f978edcbb062aa	Yes, they sleep well because they have jobs, they are supporting their families, their children are benefitting from an American education... and they dream. ...The American dream.|`|AA10423545	your ancestor was prolly an illegal alien too...ooo yeah  they stole the NATIVE AMERICAN LAND  isn't that WORST than not paying tax, huh?|`|4cb5817cdac24cf071acb9badfc39bccaa	I'd say no, must not be easy to sleep 20 or 25 to a one bedroom house.|`|70f332a19eff4d0070f552c452da98dbaa	Well, probably not. If I had to share an apartment and a mini van with 8 other illegals and try to get some sleep on a floor while the babies cried all night just so I could go to my fast food job for $7/hr, I probably wouldn't sleep well. No wait!, I would be living the American dream! never mind|`|0543e8ef222f9fb1b5d11cf408e456ffaa	I would think they sleep with one eye open.. if not they should.|`|7b9c9ff92a3e23853deeab6c306d7ef9aa	i do|`|AA11539994	do you|`|8a9bcd90aef5ee99e12b2c77b3ca7155aa	Yes, because they are living in the land of America. In America, our govt. is too lazy to do anything about these people.|`|AA10077701	Sure.They are raised to believe America stole their land and Americans owe them a living.|`|AA11541574	Of couse they do. First off, they have no conscious about breaking laws, and second, they're living off of the security of our tax dollar, so I'd say they sleep pretty good knowing free money is coming in the mail every month, food stamps...|`|b180facdedcb15658b8368bdeae5b655aa	wouldn't you sleep well at night if you counted up your thousands of dollars in cash you made every week  tax free.Knowing that tomorrow you will be able to do the same thing. knowing that you have a refrigerator full of food paid for by food stamps and that if you get sick you can go to the ER and not have to pay the bill... While I on the other hand sit up all night worrying about to pay my bills and buy my food|`|fee7bc42114ef8a8f4bf5939a9893cd2aa	Yes they do. For the majority of them do not pay taxes. And don't argue with me over this. I know it for a fact.  We all would sleep well if we did not have to pay taxes.

Yahoo "first helicopter used in war" to get site entitled:  It is by the U.S. Centennial of Flight Commissiont"---the link wouldn't work right before, sorry.    Helicopters at War (Excerpt)  Helicopters played an inconsequential role in World War II. However, they did see service to a limited extent as supply craft and for rescue operations in the China-Burma-India theater, and were operated by the 1st Air Commando unit. World War II demonstrated that the helicopter could perform useful missions, but the helicopters of the day were still limited in their power, size, and hence their capabilities.     Site 2:    http://www.arikah.com/encyclopedia/Helic...    Excerpt from site:  World War II  Nazi Germany used the helicopter in combat during WWII in small numbers. Models such as the Focke-Achgelis Fa 223 which was the first helicopter to enter series production in 1941, and the Flettner FL 282 Kolibri were used in the Mediterranean Sea.    Another site:  http://asms.k12.ar.us/classes/humanities...    Sorry, had a little trouble with these links at first.  Good luck.  BTW, Blackhawks Rule!|`|AA10592411	The German Focke-Wulf FW-61 was the first production fully controllable helicopter and had its first flight in 1936. The FW-61 broke all world records in 1937. Nazi Germany used the helicopter in combat during World War II in small numbers. Models such the Flettner FL 282 Kolibri were used in the Mediterranean Sea.|`|9707f7b5556bcfc935011eb2020c80f2aa	I think the first "helicopter" was in fact an autogyro and was built in Germany in the early 30s; the first US made helicopter was the R-1, made by Russian inventor, Igor Sikorsky and made it's first debut in the late stages of WW2; the first massive use of the helicopter in war was in Korea, where the Bell 47D helicopter was used to ferry wounded to MASH hospitals, therefore the helicopter was used as an air ambulance for the first time in Korea.|`|9911a7f370fda3dbe5e3fe7c06612c9faa	I copied my Navy answer here as it answers the "first" question.    But the Americans used a truly independent helicopter!      The American R-4 did in 1942 conduct a real at sea rescue and was later deployed to the Pacific by the Army on Navy ships: Aircraft Repair ships that went to all the island airbases for our B-29's. In late 1944, in Burma Carter Hall Army Air Corps piloted the first helicopter rescue of a downed aircrew, in 1945 in the Philippines the Army conducted several medical evacuations of wounded soldiers on Luzon.    So all are correct except that the first medical was 1945 Luzon  and the first rescue was Burma.      visit:    www.Dustoff.org   for history of Army aero-medical evacuation.    Some of the WWII pilots are still around!  We lost Carter Harmon a few years back; there are some photos of some of these men. I was honored to actually speak with many.     Simple - Former Army Aero-medical Evacuation "DUSTOFF" Historian     The Spring 1945 Luzon missions were under fire and they took men from the mountains directly to Army hospitals, just like MASH in Korea.  My role was in Vietnam UH-1's, now it is the Blackhawk!|`|b59095dac6906980047fd8bd7671c777aa	indeed the R 4 was the first real helicopter in use in a war the FW 61 is for me not a real helicopter more a VSTOL ( very short take of and landing ) .  The first general use of a helicopter could be seen in the war of Korea where the helicopter was used in the dust off  role .  There he saved many lives because they wounded where brought to the MASH hospitals in the quickest way ( like the BEL 13 )|`|6990ab9e94eb39b668126d9ccf7c848daa	ww2.  the germans use it.
