20070925125721AAaw1sn	Sports;Wrestling	Save us 222?	If you seen that promo last night, you know what I'm talking about. I heard it will say next week "save us 22J" and the next week "save us Y2J". Is WWE so desprate that they will just come out and say that Jericho is the last hope before everything goes downhill. And for the record I think that Jericho is the last hope before everthing goes wrong.

Antes de empezar para los que solo entraron a la pregunta con solo ver el titulo [o por curiosidad ??], les quiero decir que es de Lucha Libre y si no saben de lo que se trata mejor no respondan =).      Ahora si... =p   Bueno.. No se si alguien ya lo habia notado [claro ahorita todos dicen que ya ??] pero si vas a  http://www.wwe.com/  y te vas hasta abajo [lo mas abajo de la pagina] te encontraras con el "Codigo" que algunos dicen que es del regreso de Chris Jericho pero.. Entren a la pagina de  http://www.wwe.com/  y se van hasta abajo, dan click en el codigo "Save_us.222 " y...         ?Que les parece?         No estoy segura de lo que sea, ya no se puede confiar en lo que vaya a pasar en esta empresa, pero ?Que piensan? ??Si es Chris Jericho?? ...                  Saludos!!   Chau..!!

20071015135820AATucTd	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (Italy)	Sicurezza Negli Stadi...?	Salve a tutti, vorrei affrontare un problema ormai noto...la sicurezza negli stadi, in particolare della prossima partita che si terra' il 21 Ottobre nella mia citta' (livorno) ovvero Livorno-Lazio...Questa partita e' stata precedentemente vittima di episodi orribili...Abbiamo avuto dimostrazione pero' che qualcosa si puo' fare...infatti prendiamo un esempio la partita Genoa-Milan è stata "proibita" ai tifosi milanesi...perchè non è cosi' pure per una delle partite più a rischio di tutta la serie A? Apriamo gli occhi, alcuni laziali volevano andare a Bergamo con delle MANNAIE e ASCE!! e cosa pensate che succederà a Livorno? Chiedo solamente una spiegazione logica a questo "fenomeno"...perchè la situazione vista da un livornese vi posso dire che e' la seguente...ovvero che episodi che ACCADRANNO se i tifosi laziali venissero a livorno causeranno la chiusura dell'impianto calcistico...quindi viene spontaneo pensare che l'importanza che viene data a parite come MILAN.GENOA sia la stessa.

20080401112149AAsLsrA	Sports;Basketball	Too LA Lakers fans.  TRUE BASKETBALL FANS ONLY ANSWER PLEASE!!!!!?	The lakers I agree at full health are a great team.  But basketball especially in the playoffs is all about. Rhythm, being healthy, and chemistry as a team.  Right now the lakers don't have that.  Gasol is questionable, Bynum has not been cleared to play yet.  they need both at 100 % to get far.  There are less then 10 games remaining.  From round 1 in the playoffs in the West every series will almost be like a western conference finals series.  Not like the east where the top seed will have an easier time.   Do you really see the Lakers going that deep this year?  Or will next year be there year?      Im not a laker hater.  I think Kobe is a GREAT athlete.  I was a BIG fan of SHOWTIME

So which defense is the best bet---Minnesota or Chicago???  Thanks!!

20090308001626AAEteTk	Sports;Basketball	Who will be Kentucky's next coach?	I am a die hard UK fan, and I love Billy Gillispie because he is the coach. But I am sick of his coaching decisions, and his lazy players that dont care and turn the ball over nonstop! He starts Porter and Harris over his own two much better players Galloway and Miller all season, he cant get his team to stop turning the ball over, CANT GET ANYONE TO SCORE BESIDES MEEKS AND PP, Liggins dont care attitude makes me sick, and this team will NOT defend to save their lives. I know a LOT better talent is coming in next season but I just dont see it doing any good. With that said, I wonder who will be the next coach? Personally, my favorite would be between John Calipari and Travis Ford. Calipari wins no matter what, and Ford was the pick in the first place to be Tubbys replacement. Ford can coach with average players and win against anyone, and at Kentucky... I think his legacy would carry over. I dont know if Calipari would pass up millions to stay at Memphis either. Thoughts?

I was reading somewhere that if you don't wear a bow in your hair, you'll get points deducted from an "appearance" score. It also said things about wearing a tatoo on your face of the school's mascot/logo and buying cheerleading shoes in advance.      Is all of that really necessary? My school said nothing about bows or tatoos, and it didn't give any specifics on sneakers. The signs just said sneakers.

Its not just because they're one of the better teams and I want Team USA to win, but the comments by manager Felipe Alou were just so disrespectful towards a team that just beat them.      Talk to any team that gets upset and usually the coach/manager might say they didn't play their best, but they'll praise the other team for playing a good game.  Not Alou.  He said "That was a team we should have trounced 9-0" and "That was a team we should have shut out"  I mean seriously, how much more disrespectful can you get towards an opponent?  Then it said that Alou wished the game had been played later to allow his players more rest?  Excuses now?  I've totally lost any respect for Alou and hope they get swept out of the WBC.

Sono un tifoso di pallavolo, e ieri sera mi sono recato a Bassano del Grappa per assistere alla seconda giornata delle Final Eight di Coppa Italia. Il match clou era Itas Diatec Trentino - Sisley Treviso. La partita è stata emozionante, ma purtroppo la festa è stata rovinata da un arbitraggio non all'altezza. In una partita così importante, in cui si combatte punto a punto, sei errori sono davvero troppi, se si considera poi che sono stati fischiati tutti a favore dei Campioni d'Italia.   Non voglio soffermarmi se la Sisley sia o no come l'Inter, o che abbia un peso maggiore in federazione, ma voglio concentrarmi solo sugli arbitri...   Potrebbe essere che la pallavolo non sia l'isola felice che tutti pensano (quelli "dentro" a questo mondo)? Forse la classe arbitrale ha gli stessi problemi del calcio? E cosa succederà agli arbitri di ieri sera? Forse proprio perché questo mondo si considera diverso, non verranno neanche richiamati...   Detto questo, la pallavolo resta lo sport più bello!

On the other hand, I am a Steelers fan so I want the Raisins to lose so they don't make the playoffs either.       Since I want both to lose, maybe I should root for a tie.

20090227133119AAD60iN	Sports;Cricket	Will you agree that most of the pitches in the subcontinent do not favour pace bowling?	Friends,      Quote from Cricinfo:      Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam says he is pleased with the pitch for the second Test between Pakistan and Sri Lanka, starting Sunday at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. "The wicket is firm and looks good to me," he said. "We want a pitch that helps fast bowlers on the first day and benefits the spinners in the second innings, with the ball coming on to the bat. Nowadays, with one-day cricket being played so often, people expect a result in five-day matches with 90 overs being played a day."              http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/pakvsl/c...       However, I think even the pitches in Pakistan do not support fast bowling. Sometimes the groundsman leaves a bit of grass on the pitch, but does that mean all fast-bowlers can utilize that kind of pitch?      Thanks      Rehman

Ash Cole himself being able to provide dual cover as fullback if and when required, esp if rob jones is injured. YES hes a post 90s prem star, but it was either him or Rod Wallace (Leeds)  hence why I chose no fullbacks in my subs.

Goalie is Peter Schemichael for obvious reasons.       My wingers need no introduction, and my central midfield offers flair and determination. Need a 30 yard howler ?

For some reason, I'm a little nervous about shooting it. Pistols are great. Fun to shoot but for some reason the shotgun seems menacing. How bad is the recoil? Will it be horribly loud?

I will be using this bike somewhat for commuting, but rarely will I be on it for more than an hour. I would say the two most important things to me are a quick acceleration and something that feels very agile. I don't really care about top speed...

20090308010316AAjtZGW	Sports;Wrestling	The Status of Tag Teams in the WWE?	It's no secret that the WWE's Tag Team Division is all but gone and only a small select number of teams left, and those that are still there have been vastly undermined, underrated, under-pushed and kept within the confines of the Lower Mid Cards. I've watched the WWF from the late 80's to the present day and during the so called "Attitude Era" I saw a rise in quality and quantity of the Tag Team Division. I grew up watching feuds between teams and stables like the       Dudley Boys   Hardy Boys   Edge & Christian    Test & Albert    Farooq and Bradshaw   D'Lo Brown and Chaz   The Oddities   The Insane Clown Posse   D-Generation X   The Brood    The Headbangers    The Brothers of Destruction   The Rock n'Sock Connection    Too Cool w/ Rikishi   The Raddicals   The Hollys (Hardcore & Crash)    The Right To Censor   The Outlaws       These teams competed week in and week out in both tag team and singles competition, bringing with them a multitude of memorable matches and feuds. These teams, numerable and skillful as they were brought high class prestige to the Tag Team Titles in the WWF in addition to the Singles Titles many of these competitors held such as the Intercontinental, European, Hardcore and Light Heavyweight Title. These teams gave many years of work and dedication and made the Tag Team titles worth a great deal, almost to the point where it was on par with the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.         So what happened? During the Invasion Angle when WCW and ECW Superstars were merged in with the WWF rosters, it resulted in 2 different sets of Tag Titles. Along with the above Superstars we were able to see a small number of parings within the Alliance such as Chris Kanyon and Chuck Palumbo, and later on Kanyon with DDP. During this time the Undertaker and Kane became the first team to hold both belts, which later led to them being unified into 1 Undisputed Title set.        But something happened after the Invasion ended. With all of the Superstars now merged in with the WWF there should of been an entire circuit of Tag Teams but instead, the Division began to go down slowly but surely. In the coming years after the WWF transitioned into the WWE the number of Tag Teams continued to go down until we're brought to the present day. Now, when you tune in to Raw, Smackdown or ECW the only existing teams are:       John Morrison & The Miz <- Compete on all 3 Shows regularly    Cryme Tyme <- Vastly under-pushed for their popularity    The Colons   Brian Kendrick & Ezekial Jackson   Jesse & Festus <- Haven't appeared on TV for months    Priceless    Hawkins and Ryder <- More then likely will be released       On 3 different brands, there are 6 Tag Teams and 2 Tag Title Sets. John Morrison and The Miz have all but squashed every team in the entire Division multiple times, as a result of the WWE's push to make them appear to be the best in the company.       The Colons are decent enough Champions though they appear weak for always struggling to overcome the opposite team. Brian Kendrick has potential as a singles wrestler but his gimmick is overdone and his partnership with Ezekial Jackson leaves many questions.        Cryme Tyme, arguably the most popular team of wrestlers in the WWE presently, are given small pushes into the Title circuit but are immediately squashed by Miz and Morrison, or they are essentially 'screwed' out of the match by underhanded tactics or outside interference.        Hawkins and Ryder had potential but were stuck with a poorly run stable and will probably be released soon after another Squash Match with The Big Show or Vladimir Kozlov        Jesse and Festus had momentum but they haven't appeared on TV in months. More then likely they will be released or re-packaged.        Priceless are the only other team aside from John Morrison and The Miz who are actually presented as a serious team. While I disagree with them even being on the active Roster much less the flag ship show, they are given a heavy push and tend to dismantle the opposing team.         So where does this leave us as the Fans? We've gone from seeing the birth of the TLC match amidst a feud between The Dudleys, The Hardys and Edge and Christian, to seeing Cody Rhodes and Ted Dibiase Jr squash randomly paired teams, the same can be said about John Morrison and The Miz.        One of the primary differences between 8-12 years ago and now is that teams used to be presented as Teams. When Scotty 2 Hotty and Grand Master Sexy came out you knew they were a Tag team from the way they interacted with one another. When you saw fireworks raining down from the rafters to the stage with a shrill whistle you knew that Tables would be brought out and D Von Dudley would "Testify" When the lights went out and you heard an echoing whisper and flames would ignite on the Stage you knew to expect Gangrel and the Brood to rise up with a chalice of "blood"        Now, you hear a car horn going off and you're not sure if John Morrison is coming out, or if he's coming to the ring with

20090308012524AA4oTgN	Sports;Martial Arts	Is Jacksons decision going to hurt UFC 100 and 98?	If he takes it, he gets what, little to no down time, and then has to fight for his title back, after us hearing a bit about how he hates some of his life up in England.  And if he loses, then who can chauk it up to his conditionings of comfort in an estranged country!?     If he doesn't take it, does UFC 98 suffer while UFC 99 or 100 gets an upgrade, or.....any thoughts?     I'm more "afraid" if he doesn't take it because he looked less hurt by the end of the fight than he could have been considering he did take some blows and some leg kicks.  To me the best scenario is letting Jackson get some more down time and making his "current lesser" Wandi. Silva suffer, making the Franklin Silva fight happen at 98 as a possible headliner, and having Jackson and Evans both be tested in unfamiliar territory at 99, and giving Mir his 100 fight.  But will White be more merciful to Mir than Jackson and/or Wandi?

My red belt helper went jodan instead of chudan during the 5 step - but sensei Ohta realised that this was not my mistake.      Question is - what can I do about the panicking?
