20090203065808AApVPqb	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	ANyone else notice how hard it is to make a straw man argument for Creationism?	For instance, Creationists make straw man arguments for evolution ALL the time. I just read someone, for instance, who said      "A big explosion did not create millions of perfectly round suns, planets, and moons....."      Of course, no scientists believe this, it is a strawman argument. Also goes for Kirk Cameron's "Crocoduck" speech, which was similarly amusing.      But think about how hard it is to make a straw man argument for Creationists!      "You believe that 8 people cared for thousands of animals for  a hundred days"   They do believe that.      "You believe an all-powerful God had take 6 days to create the universe, then ahd to take a rest"   They do believe that.      "You believe that dinosaurs and humasn co-existed"   But they DO believe that!      It's SO hard to make a logical error around creationists! Why is that?
20090203065722AAoVDsx	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Church If you have faith, why do you ask others to pray for you?	Whenever I hear someone ask someone else to pray for them, I think of a kid asking his Uncle could he go and ask his mother could she get him a bike for Christmas. Ask cousin Sue could she go and ask his mother would she buy him some clothes for Christmas and to ask other members of the family could they go and ask his mother could she go out and buy some Christmas gifts for him fearing that if he just ask her for all the things he wants for Christmas, he may not get it.    I had a guy Sunday ask me did I need praying for and I told him no. I told him, I talk to God all the time and if God is not going to answer my prayer I will be quiet disappointed if he answered yours.

20090203070719AAHkbcJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is your take on this statement?	This is part of an email I received from my own spiritual leader. I get daily emails.       Anyway, please read and give me your take on this.      Thanks to all         "The Anglican Bishop of Manchester, Nigel McCullough, wrote, “We will, unless there is a turn in the tide, be a church that gradually disappears from the land.” Those prophetic words are becoming a reality in Europe and especially England. There are in fact more practicing Muslims in England than Anglicans. And it’s getting worse for the Anglicans by the month.          Christianity in Europe is no longer the glue of society; but rather, Christianity has become the veneer and the varnish that’s quickly wearing off. Catholicism is no longer the biggest religion of Europe- Islam is. Callum Brown wrote in 2006, “It took several centuries to convert Britain to Christianity, but it has taken less than forty years for the country to forsake it.”      Don’t look now, but American Christianity is looking like those big red and or yellow stars that cave inward on themselves and explode. Amazingly the star gets brighter just before it becomes a black hole. Many say that the American mega-churches are an indication of that brightness principle before the implosion happens.       Why is this happening?      My answer is because of the incestuous nature of the church which has pulled WITHIN, told the world and all others that they’re going to hell if they don’t accept Jesus, fallen into bibliolatry, and staked out indefensible territory that makes one look like a heretic- while calling all those who don’t believe as they do- heretics! How’s that work?      There is GOOD NEWS though.      Christianity may be departing from Europe and the West; however, it is finding a home in the South (America) and in the East where Jesus is seen as a mystic and the Bible is seen as more metaphorical. As Leonard Sweet wrote, “The language of Christianity today is Spanish; the color of Christianity is not white but brown. There are more Christian churches in India today than in the United States. The West is deconstructing, and Christianity is dying in the West.”      Sad!      As I’ve said before, we need to “Go EAST, young man, go EAST” and that’s not a geographical statement but a metaphysical-philosophical one. The library of sixty six books, known as the Bible, is of Eastern, oriental origins, not occidental! We’ve rationalized that which can’t be, we’ve denied the contradictions which are glaring, and we’ve stumbled over the spiritual truths, in hopes of maintaining our false beliefs.      It’s not working!      We must get back to LIVING the LOVE and being the LIGHT! No one is transformed by religious intellectualism, nor threats of eternal hell; but, by loving and compassionate GOOD NEWS."

20090203071540AA2yAl0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, if the Catholic Church accepts Evolution?	Does it mean that the Genesis accounts are not literally true?      Conceding that not everything in scripture is literally true is the first step on a long slope that opens more and more theological and supernatural claims to questioning.       That’s a good thing - but to many believers it may seem   a very disturbing, threatening thing, and so they react defensively and aggressively.      And please don't tell me that Catholics are not Christian. The Bibles Christians use all have to be reviewed by the Catholic Church first.

20090203070824AAwMa0w	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did I do the right thing in this situation?	I work in a library as an assistant to the librarian.  The other day a local member of the JW church came in to read newspapers.  A member of the local born again Christian church was also in that area.  Soon I could hear an argument starting between them and it was getting very loud.  I went over there and quietly asked them to please keep their conversation down.  They glared at me and continued to argue but it was quieter.  In a few minutes after I left them, they began to actually holler at each other so I went over an asked them to leave.  They both turned on me!!!!   They began to holler at me.  They were arguing over some elderly person they were both trying to snag for their churches.  I was told that what they were talking about wasn't any business of "a hell bound witch" and such.  My boss came out of her office listened to them for a minute and told them to leave and not come back for a while.  They didn't turn on her and left.  She said that I did the right thing.  I warned them and then told them to leave.  That is our policy in these types of situations.  I followed policy so she says I did the right thing the right way.   Why does it feel like I should have been able to diffuse this situation better?   Any insights would be appreciated.
20090203071355AAcH2jJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Ok so I'm convinced that the world at large is an evil/unfair place.  NOW what?	I've experienced enough evil,seen alot about the world, seen how people treat each other, how businesses operate, and generally just how people are, to know that this world unfortunately at large, in many countries, is just an unfair, harsh, and pretty evil/soulless place, with lots of corruption and all sorts of injustices happening daily.       Heck I'm sure many of you went through problems in your lives, as well as I did.      But the real question is,..once you know this, then where do you go from there?      I mean I deal with "soulless, godless" people on a daily basis, who will stop at nothing for personal gain, and really don't care at all about anything, and WILL abuse you or lead you astray.         So I mean aside from just spewed out and regurgitated "read your bible" preachings, since we still have to LIVE in the world and get our car repaired, go to the doctors, go to work, etc,...      how do we handle it all, when there's just ALOT, tons of shadiness to it all and it might hurt you. there are no guarantees. Just because you read the bible and pray doesn't mean that you're magically going to get shielded from paying your rent this month or your car NOT screwing up or your health going.         But how do we deal with the rampant soullesness, competition, humans own egotistical and fallen nature,..all of that other stuff.         It's everywhere, and it tires you out, if you try to deal with it.

You can't prove that the earth ISN'T flat. And even if you could, all that evidence is just made up by scientists who want to live in a round-earth utopia and not be accountable to the laws of flatness.

Along with my TV shows, and a lot of other things that aren't really important to survival. However there is a complete other side of me that would give it all up in a heartbeat, if I could be closer to nature. Once upon a time our survival depended on our ability to hunt. Now it depends on how much money you have. It makes no sense to me. People, children, are starving and living in paper huts, while others are complaining that they don't have that new pair of pants.  Does anyone else feel the same way?

I have been working for the same company for about 3 years and in my current position for about a year and a half.  When I moved over to this position, I already knew 95% of the people, including the guy who I was replacing.      Shortly after he left, he came back to train me for a couple of afternoons.  After one such afternoon, he ended up asking me out.  I had always suspected he had a thing for me, but didn't want to date anyone at work.  I had just started dating someone else and I told him so.  Over the next few weeks, I still had to contact him every now and then for questions, etc…and we seemed to be okay, albeit a little awkward.  I probably haven’t spoken to him now in over a year.      Now, I’m looking for a new job again.  Seeing as I replaced him once, I figure that we both do the same type of work and he would probably be a good contact for me.        Would it be rude to call him up now and ask whether he’s heard of any openings or knows anyone who's looking?  If it makes any difference, I’m still dating the same guy that I told him about a year and a half ago.

20090220160812AAdlxPY	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	When was the last time a religion inspired people to invent stuff?	I watched a documentary last night about the Gutenberg Bible. This was the first book ever to be produced by a printing press. It was a fascinating story. It got me thinking how the printing press was an essential device for humanity’s progression from the illiterate Middle Ages to the Modern Era and it was the Catholic Church that funded the costly development process that Gutenberg went through to make his printing press. This was going on nearly 600 years ago. Since then, religions seem to be dedicated to undoing what people invent and the discoveries they make. Take the creationists, for example. So there was a time somewhere not too long ago that religion stopped inspiring and began anti-inspiring (I don’t think there is a word that is the opposite of inspiring), when do you think that time was?

Hi guys =D my friend Justin has a question to ask about a girl that he likes, soo here it goes:      basically, he really likes this girl in his class. they would always laugh and smile with eachother & they made eye contact a lot. they would ask eachother how they were, etc. blah blah blah lol and now, he realizes that he likes her as more than a friend and wants to get to know her better ! but one problem, he's now extrememly nervous to talk to her ! gosh, it's terrible isn't it ? he looks at her a lot and so does she, but they never talk. she shyly smiles in his direction all of the time, and laughs at anything he says, even if they're not near eachother. What should he do ?? how can he randomly start a conversation with her again ? and also, he wants to know how you think she is feeling or if she likes him. I personally think she is probably confused and has feelings for him that she's also shy to tell him. thank you =)

I myself love that there are different types of people in the world. I love them so much that should all be preserved. The preservation of race is important. This is why evil acts such as miscegenation should not occur. This destroys diversity. It destroys races. It will make us all homogeneous. If a person truly loves who they are, they should make sure their children have their race and preserve their people. Think deeply about this.

20090220163057AAkiA4p	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Some questions for those who believe in paganism and/or the Zodiac...?	I don't believe in these things, I am asking out of curiosity.      This is how I understand it:   There are four guardians of the universal energy.  The energy of life is fractal in nature repeating from the tiniest atom, all the way up to the stars.   This energy is cyclical in nature.  It can be seen in the cycle of night and day, in the phases of the moon, in the seasons, and in the nature of life.   It is believed that the dawn corresponds to birth, the sun ascending in the sky to its apex, reflective of growth, and then the Westering sun represents aging and withering.  Then sunset corresponds to death.  The night corresponds to the journey of the soul between incarnations.      Each cycle is linked by universal energy.  At the equinoxes, the energy cycle of the solar seasons is aligned to the cycle of the day, thus the dominant cardinal guardians of birth and death (in the current age being Pisces and Virgo) are seen as the sun rises through them on the equinoxes.  (That means that Virgo is the devourer, and Pisces is the life bringer.)   Saggitarius would be the guardian of the departed, and Gemini would be the preserver of the living, the lesser guradians.  That would make the intermediate signs growth signs, withering signs, descent/decay signs and incarnation/fertility signs.      That is how I understand it, correct me if I am wrong in any particular area.      My questions:   1. Do you expect any aspect of birth, growth, maturing, withering, dying, descent/decay, rest, or incarnation/fertility to change in any way when the cardinal guardianship shifts in the soon-to-commence Zodiac age?      2. Will the effect that you believe each Zodiac has on the person born under it going to be different because they each have a different energy in the new age?      3. The equinoxes are reversed in the Southern hemisphere.  That surely means that the S. Hemisphere has been in the birth age of Virgo and the death-age of Pisces, the direct opposite Zodiac age.   So, how do you believe the S. Hemisphere is different to the N. Hemisphere for being in opposite ages?      4. Do you believe that a person being born under the same sign in a different hemisphere would experience different influence in their lives because of it?      5. We are in the cusp of two ages.  Does that mean the universal energy is weaker, or what does it do to the universal energy?      Thank you for your time. :-)

20090220165756AAXG18e	Society & Culture;Languages	English to Spanish translation, please?	Mirrors of life   Your mirrors of self reflection are made of glass, flesh and blood. What you look like, who your friends are, what you like doing, etc., is a mirror of who you are. How you communicate is a mirror of who you are. What you wear is a Mirror of who you are. What you know (and don't know) is a Mirror of who you are. What you . . . . Much like a real mirror where you can only see a part of yourself, all these other aspects are only partial mirrors of who you 'seem' to be. They do not necessarily represent who you really are.

20090220162053AAwPaHk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are you religious, but having a difficult time?	Here is my question: If a person is religious and having a difficult time, does that demonstrate the saying: "The blind leading the blind... and they all fall into the ditch?"      In other words, do difficult times mean that something is very wrong with the spiritual life of that person? Because increasing the light means that a person can see and know what is happening and where they are going.      I am asking because I notice "believers" telling each other that the Christian life is not easy... when Christ himself said that his "yoke is easy, my burden is light." (Which I think is correct with regard to the original gospel... click on my avatar for an explanation of the term "original gospel")      The correct result would be like a house built on a rock... strong, stable and unwavering. That would be the effect of religion that is right on target.      So, does a dark outlook on life mean the blind leading the blind?

Now I like science a lot but I don't know if I'd go as far out as to replace God with science, but do YOU think that God would give atheists/skepticals a second chance? I mean change it around at little and there's scientific proof/theories that could possibly explain a world without God. God did give us the option to think for ourselves but would he offer a chance to those who believed what they could sense/touch/feel over "blind faith"? It seems reasonable and I know this is just another religious 'lets all argue about it' question.

When I was a young foolish lad I used to harbour some silly childish anti-Americanisms and a lot of anti-Germanism. Probably brought on by my father, because he was bombed in the war so I sympathised, against the Americans? Who knows! personally it annoyed me the negative way they always portray British people in films and the fact they seemed to hate us rather like the way Australians seem to have a chip on their shoulder with the British. Anyway, I used to feel like I was the only one harbouring this Anti-americanism. But is this Anti-americanism new or has it been around a while, because when I was little everyone would idolise America and everything American nowadays we just hear negative opinions of the Americans. I don′t think we were always like this or was I just oblivious before? Don′t worry I have grown up, got to know and be friends with people from around the world. Hating a nation is stupid, an Iraqi is no better or worse than a British person, same as a muslim and a protestant. People are people fed rubbish by the media. Thoughts?

These small groups are very secular and very humane and are been murdered and hated by mainstream muslims all over the islamic world.   let me give you the reasons as to why they are hated,      these small groups reject the cult of prophet mohomed   they reject imam bukaris writings in the koran about taking mohomed's literal words as not only nonsanse, but deadly dangerous as well      sufi, ahamadi teaches its followers that islam, the prophet or koran should never be taken for its literal truth.      thats why followers of these sects are murdered. i beleive that if islam is ever going survive it will only be through the sufi and ahamadi sects. i have spent lots of time with these people and found them to be more like buddhists and christians with very humane views.      can shia and sunnis comment on this question?

20070610145541AAoC6jC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you believe that at one point, religion was needed to control the masses?	As much as I hate on religion, what do you think the alternative would have been centuries ago when people needed some sort of divine guidance (or punishment) to live in a decent   society?   Most were uneducated and ..ahem..primitive...so the premise of an all powerful god to show them right from wrong seemed like a good idea ( you know just like Santa for kids)   I know the same argument could be used for the crusades and slavery but you get what I'm saying... Was religion ultimately needed? Am I giving it too much credit and none to the people of the time?

20070810135741AAOYyna	Society & Culture;Languages	Hey can you check my french letter?	Bonjour,      Merci de votre lettre. Je vous écrit de préciser les points qui vous m’en a demandé. C’est vrai que les Témoins de Jéhovah sont une religion assez rare. Il y en a a peu près 100 milles en Pologne. Il y a quelques raisons pour lesquelles j’ai choisi cette religion.    Premièrement, les Tèmoins de Jèhovah ne prennent pas le part dans les guerres. Nous sommes une organisation qui aime la paix et garde la neutralitè dans les événements politiques. Ensuite on a un grand respect pour la Bible, on la prend pour sèrieux et on la lit régulièrement. C’est elle qui modifie ma vie de manière que je ne fume pas, je ne buve trop d’alcool et j’essai d’etre toujours honnette et mèner une vie morale.    On se rencontrent trois fois par semaine. On a pas d’églises mais les salles (parfois elles sont signées ? Une salle des Témoins de Jéhovah ?). Chaque groupe se compose de plus ou moins 70 gens.   Les croyances des Témois de Jéhovah sont proches se celles de catholiques (on a la meme Bible). Les différences principales sont :   - on croit qu’il y a seulement un vrai Dieu et son prénom est Jéhovah   - on ne fête pas le No?l ou les Paques, on a seulement une fête pendant toute l’année : la fête en souvenir de Jésus (une fois par l’année)   - on ne mange pas de repas qui contiennet le sang, on est aussi contre les transfusions de sang   Je respecte tous ces règles mais je suis tolerante et je sais qu’il y a beaucoup de religions dans le Monde. Je crois que chacun a le droit d’avoir une religion choisie par soi-même et comme ma religion n’est pas très commune je suis habituee que la majorité de gens ne partage pas mes croyances. J‘ai frequenté l’école où il y avait des gens qui appartenaient aux confessions divers (surtout le catholicisme). J’ai aussi beaucoup d’amis qui ne sont pas les Témoins de Jéhovah et je respecte ses croyances.      Tout ce que j’ai écrit est très général. Pour savoir plus veuillez visiter un site officiel des Témois de Jéhovah: www.watchtower.org      Ce qui concerne mon niveau de fran?ais j’ai passé l’examen Delf B2. Ca avait lieu en Juin et je n’ai pas encore mon dipl?me. Je le recevrai en Octobre. Sur mon baccalauréat j’ai passé le fran?ais écrit et oral (niveau avancé).      S’il s’agit de mes projets futurs, après le retour de la France je voudrais faire mes études (la faculté de sinologie). Plus tard, je voudrais avoir un travail ou l’on est amené à voyager et rencontrer des gens de pays divers. Peut-être j’etudierai une autre langue étrangère en futur. Je pourrais être aussi le proffesseur dans une école.           En attendant vos réponses, Joanna Ka?ków

Tempo fa sono stato a Milano per lavoro e ho notato,con grande rammarico che la gente per strada non ti guarda in faccia,nella metropolitana non si parla,ognuno guarda sempre dall'altra parte,i vicini di casa nemmeno si conoscono.Forse perchè è una grande città?Io sono Siciliano e nelle grandi città tipo Palermo o Catania,sì ognuno è per i fatti suoi,ma non si avverte la stessa sensazione di solitudine che c'è nel nord.C'è più "solidarietà".A questo punto penso che sia difficile se non addirittura impossibile avere dele relazioni sociali con persone che non si siano per forza conosciute in qualche contesto lavorativo,scolastico etc,insomma dove si è insieme per forza e quindi si ci deve conoscere.Ma come fanno a incontrarsi e salutarsi per strada se nemmeno si guardano?Vi ringrazio per l'attenzione.

20070706003236AASPALz	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	What were the relations between Kush and Egypt?	According to the Encylopedia the Upper Egypt the Southern segment of Egypt was essentially African in character whilst the North had large influence from the east. The South was where the ancient Egyptian culture originated from and where the pharoahs usually came from. There is nothing, absolutely nothing, in the language of the ancient Egyptians that is related to Indo-European or Semitic ancient Egyptian language was not Afro-Asiatic as Western historians presently claim it was entirely Hamitic and linguistically akin to Nubian and Beja. The Ethiopians] say that the Egyptians are settlers from among themselves and that Osiris was the leader of the settlement. The customs of the Egyptians, they say, are for the most part Ethiopian, the settlers having preserved their old traditions. For to consider the kings gods, to pay great attention to funeral rites, and many other things, are Ethiopian practices. Upper Egyptians even today are black and are related to the Nubians and the Beja.
20070706050215AAFMpRK	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Who were the black Hamites?	According to the bible the Hamites created the world's first civilizations which included Cush, Put, and Canaan and Egypt.  Nimrod, son of Cush, also identified as a mighty hunter before God, and the founder of ancient Babel, Akkad and Sumer.
20070708033305AAhkka7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Who were the black Hamites?	The black Hamites created the world's first civilization encompassing  huge geographical territories.  Ham's sons were said to have fathered the peoples of Africa. Of Ham's four sons, Canaan, fathered the Canaanites, while Mizraim fathered the Egyptians, Cush the Cushites and Phut the Libyans. According to the bible Nimrod son of Kush a black man created the Mesopotamian civilizations including Sumeria Chaldea Ur and Erech. Where did the Sumerians originate from? Because according to the bible they are descendents of the kushites.
20070714065934AAuDP01	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Was the founder of Sumer black?	Nimrod son of Kush  is said to be the founder and king of the first empire after the Flood, and his realm is connected with the Mesopotamian towns Babylon (Babel), Uruk, Akkad, and Calneh. He additionally founded Nineveh, Resen, Rehoboth-Ir and Calah. According to the bible he is the son of a black man called Kush who also refers to an ancient civilization South of Egypt.  The Kushites are also said to be the ancestors of the ancient Egyptians who's black descendents live today in Southern Egypt.
20070727024659AAfhkBD	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Was Osiris from ancient Kush?	Egypt was believed to have been a colony of Kush in antiquity.    They (the Ethiopians) say also that the Egyptians are colonists sent out by the Ethiopians, Osiris having been the leader of the colony... And the larger part of the customs of the Egyptians are, they hold, Ethiopian...    Diodorus Siculus, Ancient Greek Historian.  The idea of a pharaoh (king) may have come down the Nile from Nubia to Egypt (and) that would make Nubian civilization the ancestor of Egypt. The first settlements in Egypt are in Upper Egypt where the black descendents of the ancients still live today if you dont believe go and visit southern Egypt.  The Southern Kingdom, Upper Egypt, was clearly conceived as the dominant of the two regions. It was from the south that the most enduring influences in Egyptian society came and without doubt most of its greatest leaders were southerners too. The ancient Egyptians originated from the south not the north.
20070727000153AA2LA4E	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do people refer to ancient Kush which is Sudan as Ethiopia?	Egypt's Dynastic rulership may have originated in Ta-Seti, thus signaling the first such form of government known to mankind. Kush is Ta seti and it preceded Egypt as stated in  ancient Egyptian mythology Egypt was believed to have been a colony of Kush in antiquity. when people speak of the ancient Kushites they think of the light skinned Ethiopians which is incorrect the Kushites  had the oldest and greatest civilization in Africa and and are related lingusitically, religiously and racially to the Southern Upper Egyptians. People incorrectly believe that Ethiopia was the only significant civilization in Africa and dont even classify Ethiopia as black but dont worry kush is older and has 270 pyramids and beutiful temples created by the darkest people on the African continent.
20070807060522AAAxTEm	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Did the ancient Egyptia originate from Nubia?	Evidence indicates that the Neolithic in the Nile valley likely came from the Sudan, as well as the Sahara, and shared a common culture between the two areas and Egypt during this time period. Around 3800 B.C., the first Nubian culture arose, termed the A-Group, and it was contemporary, and ethnically and culturally very similar to, the polities in predynastic Naqadan Upper Egypt. Diodorus of Sicily writes:    {quote} The Ethiopians say that the Egyptians are one of their colonies which was brought into Egypt by Osiris If the Egyptians and Ethiopians were not of the same race, Diodorus would have emphasized the impossibility of considering the former as a colony. Egyptians considered the Land of Punt as being their ancestral homeland Punt, was an ancient land south of Egypt it is thought to have been somewhere in eastern Africa, probably in east-northeast Sudan  Temple reliefs at Deir el Bahari in W Thebes depict an Egyptian expedition to Punt in the reign of Hatshepsut. Hatshepsut. The Egyptians depicted Puntites to be similar in appearance to themselves

20081209095524AAlguWz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	?22. Por qué necesitan agradecer al amigo invisible de algo que han hecho uds mismos?	Mucha gente necesita convencerse que para vivir bien necesita un equipo de obedientes seguidores de mitos, que sacrifican su duda y asombro por cualquier pasaje mítico... que les diga cómo hacer las cosas, de manera literal...  Siempre cuando hacen algo le dan gracias a dios, pero nunca se la dan a sí mismos.      Necesitan de la literatura inquisidora de un libro que dividió la historia de 4 continentes, los creyentes (Puros, envestidos, honorables y honestos)  y los no creyentes (impíos, cobardes, sucios, diabólicos y peligrosos). Y que exculpa a su dios de toca acusación sumergiendo en prosa solo la responsabilidad humana...pero dándole gozo a dios por la posibilidad de hacer las cosas.      Su amigo, según ellos les dio la alternativa, pero ellos se ganaron el puesto porque los favoreció dándoles la inteligencia, y brindándoles el camino que debían seguir.   Sin embargo sí les va mal, no es culpa de dios, sino de la mala decisión del individuo.   Y así se llenan la boca hablando de la libertad y libre albedrío, cuando su amigo invisible, es y ha sido el  asesino durante dos milenios de miles tradiciones, descubrimientos, pensamientos y naciones enteras, generador de odios y de persecuciones raciales y sexuales, necesitando la fuerza y no los argumentos, simple prueba de que la duda hacia la iglesia tiene auge contemporáneo).          ?Alguien me puede decir entonces por qué necesitan agradecer al amigo invisible de algo que han hecho uds mismos? ?Por qué la gente necesita crearse un dios o bueno un amo y se?or?      (Sí ud va a ser grosero y tosco con palabras descalificadoras, haga algo productivo para ud mismo, no conteste nada)

I don't really care about the whole "going to hell" thing, which is what gets most people. But I do feel that if I don't believe in God, everything will just start going wrong...It seems like most things happen for no reason at all so maybe assigning a divine hand to the course of life would make things bearable....even though the rational part of my brain tells me that the likelihood of there being a deity is pretty slim.   Anyone else feels this way?

20090209201358AAfoaZ1	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Catholics: What Jesus taught?	I often see Catholics claim that the Bible itself says that it does not contain all that Jesus taught. Where do you get this idea? I have to admit I have never seen this claim in the Bible. My only guess is that is comes from the last verse in John. However this verse says things He did. Not things He taught. So where does this idea come from?      John 21:25  And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.

Don't you ever get concerned about the possibility of life after death when you read verses in the Holy Bible like this one in the last book of the Bible, Revelation 20:11 thru 15:--  11  And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away;  and there was found no place for them.  12  And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened:  and another book was opened, which is the book of life:  and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.  13  And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them:  and they were judged every man according to their works.  14  And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.  This is the second death.  15  AND WHOSOEVER WAS NOT FOUND WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF LIFE WAS CAST INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE.  These verses of scripture don't worry you in the least bit?  Your 100% sure that they are just fairy tales like 'Snow White"?  (I only want you to look at the possibility of our eternal destiny and the importance of our being properly prepared)

To the Greeks ancient Aethiopia was Kush modern day sudan just south of Egypt and according to the greeks the Kushites or Aethiopians were the tallest, most beautiful and long-lived of the human races, and before Herodotus, Homer, in even more flattering language, described them as the most just of men, the favorites of the gods. ancient Aethiopia or Kush is modern day sudan not Ethiopia which is mentioned in the bible 36 times and it was from this place that the southern Egyptians had their origins. Modern day Ethiopia is much younger than Kush and was less splenderous. Kush has 270 pyramids and beutiful temples and is no doubt the greatest civilization in Africa after Egypt. Today's Ethiopia does not deserve to be called that because the name belonged to the Kingdom of Kush (Meroe modern day Sudan. When you hear how great Aethiopia was keep in mind that they are speaking about Kush modern day sudan not Ethiopia.

Sur son site,l'auto-proclamé Cheikh débite aneries sur aneries, et je crois qu'il serait sage de le dénoncer:   Tout d'abord prétendre que la traduction du Docteur Hamidullah est une référence. M. Hamidullah était quelqu'un de trés bien, et je le respecte, mais il n'empêche que sa traduction où il a prit le parti de la littéralité totale n'est pas trés habile. En tous cas, elle ne vaut pas celle de Si Hamza Boubakeur, ni la trés récente et excellente traduction du Cheikh AbdAllah Penot.   Ensuite, Monsieur Riyad se permet de faire des commentaires du Coran. Il serait bon de rappeler ici que pour pouvoir faire des commentaires coraniques, il faut non seulement connaitre le texte coranique par coeur mais aussi connaitre ce qu'on appelle "asbab el-nouzoul", c'est à dire les circonstances de la révélation ( hadith), ce qui est une régle qui a toujours été appliquée par les savants en Islam jusqu'à l'arrivée des sectes wahabites et salafites.

We have already talked about this difference, and it was great that we talked about it very early on in the relationship. We have agreed to respect each other's views and beliefs and I'm very decided on not having sex until marriage. Now we have not talked about that but I am deciced on telling him that when I need to. We love each other very much and he is an incredible guy so I think he'll more than understand. But I was just wondering, does it turn him off everytime I make a reference to God? I am not super-super devoutly religious or anything, but I do pray and I thank God for my awesome guy. I tell him that sometimes. Sometimes I tell him that I prayed for him. I am not trying to convert him at all. I mean, it'll be great for me if he did convert back, but it doesn't really matter to us at all. But I just wanted to know, atheist guys, does it turn you off or offend you when your Catholic girlfriends talk about God or tell you they prayed for you?

20080901143636AAHlBqZ	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	All Real Mermaids!!!!?	 Ok. Im going to try this spell:Insouciant Inclemency    Redoubtable mediocracy                                                   Refutable humanity    Make me what I wish to be...   A MERMAID   Witches one and witches all   Give this power to me       Repeat 10 times         whatever you do, DO NOT SAY THIS WHILE DRY!!!!! You do not have to be in the bath, shower, pool, or ocean while you say this. Some part of you just has to be touching water. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SAY THIS ON A FULL MOON. Just don't look at it or you will regret looking at it (after saying the spell)      After saying this spell, you will probably have side effect(s)   -Legs changing color/getting itchy, tingly or achey   -Nausea   -Fatigue   -Difficulty breathing   -Coughing fits when in water   -Being able to breathe in water/hold your breath longer   -Random anger   -Scales appearing on your skin   -Gills appearing on your neck or under your armpits   -Legs sticking together or wanting to stay together   -Legs crossing by themselves   -Constant thirst even after drinking lot of fluid   -Headaches   -Wanting to touch or be in water   REMEMBER: SIDE EFFECTS ARE NOT COMPLETELY NECESARY, IT'S JUST THAT MOST PEOPLE GET THEM.   Sometimes side effects don’t happen until 2 weeks after saying the spell      Tail colors vary, and you do not decide what color your tail will be. It takes about a month for your tail to fully develop.       You do not get to choose your power. Powers I've heard of are the H2O powers (heating, freezing, or shaping water), psychic powers, and telekinesis. The power may take up to 2 months to develop.      For this spell to work, you need to have a symbol; something that is special to you and is on your upper body (so it will still be visible when you grow a tail). It can be a necklace, a bracelet, a ring, your hair, your eyes, etc. You cannot take it off for more than two hours at a time or you will lose your powers and tail or the spell won't work. You also have to believe the spell will work or else it won't. After the actual  spell, it says repeat 10 times, does that mean to say it 10 times total?, or to say it the firstime, and then 10 more times making it 11 total? Please dont be mean, if it doesnt work then let me find out myself,. And stop hating on all the other people wanting to be mermaid. Shouldnt you be happy that we still have imagiation instead of thinking about sex, and having our minds melted by television? so only rwal mermaids or nice answers.    Thank You.

Therefore, the 5 things I think each person should have to do in their life is:   1. Own your own business and have at least 15 employees.   2. Work as a waiter/waitress.   3. Fall in and out of love.   4.Trade places with a spouse- my husband would be required to cook, clean, do laundry, etc while I would get to ride on the mower.   5.Start out in the real world with no money and make something out of yourself from nothing.

20080925161216AAJjBsW	Society & Culture;Languages	?Me podrían traducir este texto por favor!?	Nell’ambito del corso di Dottorato di ricerca in Storia del diritto italiano con particolare riferimento alla Storia del diritto moderno presso l’Università di Siena (XIII ciclo), sto conducendo una ricerca sulla figura del giurista pisano Giovanni Carmignani (1768-1847).   Nella fase iniziale della ricerca, quella dedicata alla raccolta dei ragguagli prosopografici, ho potuto ottenere l’autorizzazione a visitare la Villa della famiglia Carmignani1 (l’ultima rimasta al patrimonio della famiglia), sita in una frazione del comune di Collesalvetti: Poggio al Pallone2.     L'immobile è attualmente di proprietà della Cassa Nazionale Forense, che l'acquistò alla fine degli anni ’70 a tenore del lascito testamentario fatto a suo favore dall’ultima discendente della famiglia, l’Avv. Giuliana Carmignani3.       La struttura architettonica della villa è quella tipica del casale di campagna riadattato a residenza signorile. Vi si trovano anche una chiesa piuttosto ampia , fornita pure di un campanile4, e una limonaia di grandi dimensioni.         L’interno la villa conserva ancora in molte parti l’arredamento ottocentesco; in particolare quello dello studiolo dell’Avv. Giuliana Carmignani, che pare sia stato lo stesso del giurista nato a S. Benedetto a Settimo.       Si sapeva che all’interno della dimora Carmignani si trovava una biblioteca di famiglia e si sperava, perciò, che essa fosse, almeno in parte, quella già appartenuta a Giovanni Carmignani (o al fratello Vincenzo) : la visita ha invece confermato il timore iniziale, per cui, probabilmente, il grosso della biblioteca di famiglia5 sarebbe andato perduto durante il secondo conflitto mondiale, con la distruzione del palazzo dei Carmignani sito sui lungarni pisani6.    Nella Villa non esistono locali organizzati a biblioteca: i libri sono disposti in due grossi scaffali nel salotto del primo piano, in un baule ubicato sulle scale che conducono all’ultimo piano in due armadi con sportelli in vetro che si trovano nello studiolo che fu dell’Avv. Giuliana Carmignani.    Gli scaffali del primo piano non contengono libri giuridici, ma soltanto volumi d’argomento letterario. Gli unici volumi a carattere giuridico sono contenuti negli armadietti dello studiolo e nella cassapanca sulla scale, ma sono in numero molto limitato.     Nel baule sul pianerottolo delle scale sono conservate una decina di copie del libro di Giuseppe Giuliani, La mente di Giovanni Carmignani6, circa 15 copie dell’estratto, d’anonimo, dalla Rivista Penale del 1877, intitolato Carmignani e la pena di morte e, infine, un esemplare del Giornale agrario toscano dell’anno 1846 (tomi XX e XXI). Vi sono, altresì, varie copertine di libri mastri della fattoria di Poggio al Pallone e di quella del Piano7, un esemplare degli Statuti civili e criminali della città di Piombino (in latino e con testo italiano a fronte)8, una copia di un Editto di Felice I principe di Lucca e Piombino dato in Pisa il 14. XI. 18119, vari fascicoli estratti (anzi strappati) dal "Nuovo Giornale dei letterati"10 contenenti recensioni curate da Giovanni e Vincenzo Carmignani.       Ma le cose più interessanti, almeno dal punto di vista più strettamente giuridico, si trovano nello studiolo al piano terreno. Qui sono infatti conservati alcuni libri d’argomento giuridico posseduti dall’Avv. Giuliana Carmignani. Oltre a questi vi sono alcune copie di lavori di Giovanni Carmignani: il primo volume delle Cause celebri del giurista pisano (nella loro seconda edizione, che reca in premessa la biografia del giurista scritta dall’Abate F. Pardini), una copia del terzo volume della Teoria delle leggi della sicurezza sociale nell’edizione del 1832. Nelle medesimo vetrine è possibile anche trovare varie memorie processuali e "cause (forse) celebri" dell’Avv. Della Chiostra, nonché parte11 dell’archivio dell’Avv. Giuliana Carmignani, con fascicoli e atti relativi alla sua attività professionale12.     Interesse particolare, al di là di quanto sopra scritto, presentano alcuni volumi manoscritti contenenti lavori finora inediti (anche se non del tutto ignoti) di Giovanni Carmignani.    Si sapeva che Giovanni Carmignani, negli ultimi della vita aveva messo mano alla compilazione, certamente ambiziosa, di una Storia dell’eloquenza forense13.    Si trattava di argomento di tanto interesse all’epoca, quanto rilevante era allora il ruolo della classe forense14. Lo stesso professore pisano aveva dato alle stampe un breve excursus di questo lavoro premettendolo al primo volume delle sue Cause celebri.    Di questo lavoro sono conservati presso la villa due grossi volumi accuratamente rilegati, contenenti molte carte manoscritte del Carmignani. Il primo volume contiene il testo, con correzioni, aggiunte, note di alcuni dei capitoli della Storia15, il secondo contiene prevalentemente schede, appunti di lavoro, bozze di scrittura di vari capitoli16. E’ ovvio che in questa seda non potrà essere affrontata l’analisi dettagliata di quest’opera incompiuta17, analisi che del res

20080926145536AAnhNJg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I need to worship God, and not Jesus Christ, whom I revere.?	I often feel God calls me. That I need to bow before him, pray to him, and speak with Him as often as I can. God as I understand Him is definitely Abrahamic. Yet I am neither Muslim, Christian or Jewish. And so I am looking to convert to one of these religions.      Of the three, Christianity has the greatest appeal due to its humanism. However, Christianity is literally worship of Jesus Christ who is God's human form. Sadly, I do not conform to the view which says that Jesus Christ IS Lord, (though I still revere Jesus Christ) Having also read the Gospels, I know that Jesus prays to the Father, and often converses with the Father.. and he wouldn't have done that, had he been God himself.      Is there no way of accepting Christianity and worshipping just the Father just as Jesus did, and not worship Jesus, while still revering him as the man who introduced us to the Father, to God.       Had it not been for Jesus, God would have remained an Israeli monopoly.       Yet, though Jesus died for his people, he was still a human... and he too, prayed to the One Lord, the Lord first understood by his Jewish ancestors, the God of Abraham, Moses, Isaac and David.      So to worship God alone, I sometimes look towards Islam.. which is also a beautiful religion, but in concept alone.. In practice, Islam is too demanding, especially their month long fasts and their rules about women (myself being male), and their hundreds of restrictions ... you know how it takes over your entire life, and even when its all followed, any bearded fool can threaten you with death if you don't follow his version of the Shariah.      Could someone please help me out of this quandary?

If god is truly all knowing, and he know exactly what we do, what we have done, and what we will do then he must have known this when he first created us, he therefore "engineered" us to do what it is that we're gonna do.  Therefor there is no free will, god created evil, god created murderers, god created Atheists.  It could not have turned out any other way for this is gods plan, he made us this way and KNEW how it would all turn out!  Therefore this goes against gods basic principles, therefore there is no god.  What have you to say my fellow human beings!???

20081013161348AAyb3Rk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Condemned to... isolation?	Here is a life question that needs to be answered. Mr. C. says: "Let me put it in the simplest way. While growing up I was sort of the black sheep of the family and of course went with bad company, so I would not be accepted as a date by many a girl. After several years my life changed for the better and I was almost married but it went sour so it didn′t happen. After that I went to Bible College and no one was  interested in me. I worked as Asst. Pastor for 12 years and no dating at all. I retired from Pastoring last year but when a girl finds out I was a Pastor she slowly starts to fade away as if I were to bring on her Moses¨10 plagues. I have not dated anyone for over 20 years, and when I try it′s like my past scares the girls away or I feel that it is their way of taking vengeance for the girl I stood up. Does this mean I am to be condemned to "isolation" and being alone for the rest of my life?   Sometimes I think that at least when my life was all messed up I had some fun, but now, being changed by Jesus since 1989, still am being isolated. Why? Any wise person have the answer?  I sometimes miss the "cool" life, at least I had friends and company".  I need a wise and reasonable answer please.  Thank you

I personally feel like I have a very good relationship with God and my faith in Him is what keeps me going, but I do not attend any church. I grew up going to church every Sunday and reading the bible too. I have had one or two really bad experiences with churches and have heard a lot of bad things about them, so I feel that I don't need a church to get me closer to God. He knows my want,my needs, and my heart, right, so why would I need a church?

20081025153803AAbKliO	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	What am I really? am I racist toward my own kind?	I have always been raised in a very white suburban life. With less then five percent hispanics through out my whole entire school life. until maybe the beginning of my sophomore year in HS. My mom has always thought really highly of us because she got her masters in psychology and because my father is a sort of famous star in Mexico so she raised me to believe that i am better then Mexican Traditions. Well anyways, I have no clue how to dance Mexican dances and only know like American people music. When i have tried to interact with hispanics they make fun of my accent when i try to speak in spanish. And the thing is that my view on hispanic people (see im hispanic and yet i find myself saying this out loud sometimes which makes people hate me and think im racist toward my own kind) is the same on how American views them, and unfortunately the stereotype isn't fantastic. It sucks because I AM MEXICAN. I was born there!!! yet i have no idea how to be ONE. The thing is the problem is that i don't know how to change my way of being towards them, i just don't know. I mean i was raised to look at all the Mexicans that came from the lower class and even the middle class as like lower then me, and i hate it because i don't want to be that way and yet without realizing i make my comments. mostly all the Mexican people come from the lower society. how do i solve my personality? am I truly racist toward my own kind? I mean I don't even like brown skin especially mexican brown skin.. there i go again...

20090220130744AABtlvM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is Ned Flanders a Christian Saint?	Fox started in 1987 with a handful of shows like "Married, With Children." An animated short on the Tracey Ullman Show lived on by itself and was named "The Simpsons." In the late 1980s, evangelicals like radio host Bob Larson criticized The Simpsons, as they did nearly everything in entertainment. Only a couple of years ago, one of the show's characters, Ned Flanders, was on the cover of Christianity Today magazine.   Granted, people lighten up over time but when a religious system teaches its adherents to see the world through a static worldview, isn't it hypocritical to bless 30 years later, what one condemned in the beginning?

20090220165157AAd5Ihr	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What happens after we die?	I dont believe in God to be a person standing over us judging our every move, and I dont believe heaven to be a place everyone goes when they die and is for some reason unconditionally happy. But I do believe that our souls are always somewhere in the universe..      So maybe if we are all eternal, than we never actually "die". It just marks the end to one chapter in our life..which is being a human on earth. And then maybe we start a whole new chapter somewhere else.      What do you think happens?

In the beginning, no one saw A'Tuin so there could have been no belief in him/her (unless people from another planet saw him/her) with the use of a telescope. So if people before seeing A'Tuin did not know he/she existed then they could not believe in him/her. Without belief, a god dies.

20090220143852AAxBmXy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why am i having such odd dreams?	So the sunday before tech school got out(Superbowl Sunday), I have a dream that Im leaving Disney World, and go to the airport full of sick people. So then I am back at my old Tech School, and have to start this engineering class I took, that I hated. My sister starts that school, and hates it like I did, and is having nightmares about that school.      My dog gets scheduled for surgery a week later to get a cyst removed.(not dreaming)      The weekend after school gets out, I dream that i planned a surprise party at Chuck E Cheese for my Uncle. The family got mad at me. But Chuck E Cheese was more like a house, where you had to remove your shoes. Then it shifted over to me finding someone took naked pictures of me and my cousin when we were 11.(It was gross).   Then it switched over to my cousins baptism, where his great aunt and uncle both living, and younger(His uncle died and his aunt got old in real life).      The night before the dogs surgery, I dreamp my dad was in the hospital for some reason. I was in some creepy Beauty and the Beast Castle, and a bunch of Characters appeared doing a song and dance around the castle, from the ocean. I worked with some old colleagues on some videogame mission similar to luigis mansion.      So my dog comes home not feeling too well, but fine the next day.      So then I have another dream im on some tower, talking to my aunt about the priesthood. Then I start talking to another aunt about a trip I took to visit her when I was 3, in which i had a flashback in which I my aunt gave me a 101 dalmation cup that fascinated me at the time, and embarassingly, a memory when I took a bath with my cousins.      Then I got a call from the tech school stating "I failed a class because I had a bunch of missing assignments." I really did turn the assignments in, and the teacher was very disorganized.(not dreaming)      So the next night, I dream I have to design some cult like amusement park/zoo, and the teacher who failed me was real upset, cause she had to euthanize her mom. Then she is surrounded by all these people with respiratory problems(The teacher is a heavy smoker).      Then I dream that I am on some weird expedition with my dad uncles and cousin with some place that started off as a zoo, and turned into the arctic. Then I was in school, where the teacher who failed me starts rubbing in my failure in my face. Then I am at a mass which my barber is presiding (He's a deacon).      Then I have a meeting with the school about that class, where the assistant director tells me "I love you and wish I could adopt you".(not dreaming)      The next night after this meeting I dream that its Christmas, and that Im still stuck in that class, cause of the teacher. But I am also at some Byzantine church that looks like my church sort of.      Is someone trying to tell me something?

This also sparked the debate, what about Christmas? Easter? Do we just do it for the hell of it? It kind of reminds me about learning about different religions in school- you want to find out more and participate even though you don't believe. Thats pretty much the situation I'm in here...I mean I plan to go to Ash Wednesday and things because its something that I've always done, but it feels like I shouldn't be there.

Because I encounter 5 anti-Christian questions for every 1 anti-atheist.      Honestly we kind of expect it from some of you people. But at least don't be hypocritical and point the finger at others when you guys do it 5x worse.

That made me think for myself and after certain life experiences I am totally non religious and very happy being that way.

20090220165112AACteHk	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	African American/Black females, how do you feel about this?	So I'm a freshman in college, and after my last class was done, I went to eat lunch with a group of friends. Among them is this one black guy from New Jersey. About midway through lunch, he looked over and saw three black girls going down the escalator and said "The black girls here have such pretty hair and take good care of it. Back home, it's like they just didn't care."      Then he looked at me and said, "Like you, for example. You have too much hair! It's so pretty and wavy. Is it natually like that? Do you even need a relaxer?"      So I said, "I get a mild relaxer like every 8-12 months because the waves are hard to get out with a straightening comb when I want them out." Then he said "Are you mixed?" which prompted me to say, "yeah I'm biracial. I'm half black and half Native American."      I thought my final statement would put an end to it. But no...this idiot has to ask me "Well, a lot of black girls here have really pretty hair. Are a lot of North Carolina black girls part Indian?"      This really pissed me off, so I curtly responded "I don't know their ethnic makeup. They could have significant white or Hispanic ancestry. Better yet, why can't they just be predominately black?"      Basically, this has been bothering me all day. When I told one of my other friends about it, he goes "So you mean to tell me you really care what that f*ggot thinks?"       I know some black guys love it when black girls have long hair, but I have cousins with longer hair than me and they may be like a little over 1/8 Indian.       I've been stared at my whole life because people have been trying to figure out what I'm mixed with or if I'm Dominican, Somalian, Ethiopian, etc.      What do you guy's think his problem is? Why is everything about being mixed or having a lot of hair to some blacks?

I have heard 3 people say they died were revived but didn't see or experience any thing. Second question have you ever come close to getting killed when mysteriously for some unknown reason you made it through. Then you looked back and just couldn't figure out how you made it through, how did you feel during the experience. Like did you feel you were being guided and you weren't really worried about what was happening even though you could see how you would have never made other wise

20090220165236AAPOW10	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Everyone tells me I'm very attractive, but my personality KILLS me, should I take it as a compliment?	I've never had any problems getting dates with gay guys. My problem has always been getting a second date.      At a club, I have no problem getting guys to talk to me, my problem is getting them to wanna keep talking to me after wards. The problem them wanting to be my friends after they meet me.      I get so many dates on-line, people look at my pictures, and immediately want to meet me.      A LOT of people who know me have told me they thought I was hot when they met me, but then got totally turned off by my personality.      It used to be hard to describe my personality until Dr. House began airing. I can say I have a little bit of him in me.       BUT it got really easy to describe my personality when The Big Bang Theory began airing. I have EXACTLY the same personality as a Sheldon. I'm eccentric in exactly the same way.      Everyone tells me I'm very hot, and that it's my personality that's keeping me from getting a boy friend.      Should try to change, or should my future boy friend like me the way I am?

20090220132038AALXlRL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can I know what God wants me to do?	Well, this year I'm a senior and I have so much to focus on studying. OK, it's not that I don't want to, because I'm a willing person and very ambitious at the same time. I often find myself planning for a successful future and such...   But sometimes I find all this nonsense, as long as I can't be sure for this future. I feel that my big desire turns away from me for some hours, even days... then it comes again and so on... The conclusion is that I become more disappointed while struggling like this, like I'm caught in a vicious circle. I feel I'm wrong when I act like this. I'm just... distracted...    This is a crucial year for me, because I'm going to choose my future career. But I feel I'm not considering some things to be as serious as they should be. E.g. I sometimes don't care about the days of exams, the life in University, my room mates etc. It's like I'm not going to live them in a few months.   The problem here is that since I've started to believe in God, I've became more indiferent about some things. E.g. My sister had deleted some important photos of daddy and I said "Don't worry so much for their damn photos. Think of your rest life, not for such details." I'm used to thinking such things even for myself. I feel like I'm avoiding myself, like I'm so weak, as I can't decide on what my future will be. I feel confused. What can I do to increase my will and vision? Should I let the things flow normally?

Ok, I am 18. I have never been w a guy or girl before. But I have had crazy, euphoric feelings for guys and girls. My most recent crush was on a girl, she was my first crush on a girl EVER (she is a genuine BI). I even went as far as telling her  that I couldn't stop feeling this way. Well, it didn't work out. She got scared, she told me she didn't wanna be my first. So we talked about it and we are still friends... We have our awkward moments but we are cool! Thank god... I thought I was gonna lose her.... anyways, I have had the similar feelings towards guys... Oh! Ever since I met her I have been checking out some girls... and I get shy around them... Same thing with guys... So I am confused... could I be Bi? Coz I don't feel bi... I feel..well... normal...LOL! But how do I know if I am really into guys or girls? I don't think I have to go as far as being 'on the same bed' w them to figure this out... there should be a simpler way... I have been to clubs before And I have made out w guys but I have never felt that thrill or passion when I kiss them... I don't know if that means anything... the reason why I haven't dated anyone is just because I know what I am looking for... as it is not easy to find....
20090220164650AAr9419	Society & Culture;Languages	Why does the English language have a word order such as this?	For example someone going to school:      He is going to school      now why does English include IS and TO? why not just be:      He go school      And take those words out? i forgot what those are called. and yes I'm a native English speaker and see no point in using extra words like that. I also understand for the past, present and future tense, but just use an extra letter or 2 to make it so for example, past Hene go school, present He go school, future Hes go school.      and yes i know it sounds like a stupid questin or may be to most fo you, but I'm just wondering. instead of has gone, will go and is going, with different endings for go AND different word for the marking of future, past, present (will,has,is).

20090220130837AA5JDuL	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;People with Disabilities	How do I deal with this co-worker?	My employer (which shall remain nameless) recently hired a deaf person to meet some bullshit requirement established by the Americans with Disabilities Act. It's horrible having to work with her. Yes, she is pleasant enough and she's got a pretty nice body, but, my god, when the woman opens that mouth of hers: cover your ears. It constantly sounds like she's gargling a mixture of saliva and tar as she attempts to form words; it literally makes me want to vomit.      I don't want to sacrifice losing my job over this, but I would like to politely let her know that she is not welcome. Other co-workers have gone so far as to call it a "minor distraction" and it "takes some getting used to", so I am not the only one. Our boss is really pleased with her work so far, so I can't call her out for incompetence. Any suggestions on how I can drop a not-so-subtle hint?

20090220134905AAsS7XJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do we have a choice when we do not deserve one?	Will what is formed say to him that formed it, Why have you made me thus?" (Rom 9:20). You may ask: Why has Jesus not shown Himself or come back now and show us who He is? Well if He came would you be ready? "The Lord does not delay and is not tardy or slow about what He promises, according to some people's conception of slowness, but He is long-suffering (extraordinarily patient) toward you, not desiring that any should perish, but that all should turn to repentance." (2 Peter 3:9) The Way of salvation is through Jesus Christ and since Jesus died and raised alive by the Power of God once and for all for sin there is no other way to enter into God's rest (Salvation) no other payment for the worlds sins it has already been paid by God through God (Jesus Christ). If you do not believe in God or Jesus Christ who came then you have closed your own eyes and ears and locked out your own heart without a key. Add me as a contact if you want to know more. I believe it is possible to come to Him when you feel Him draw you to Jesus Christ.  Thank you for your serious answers  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;... 
20090220130117AATNYU0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What made God? Do you agree with this?	Please read it completely first for a serious answer.     It is the complete truth that I can not convince anyone on my own that Jesus Christ is Lord(God), But only when they are convicted by the Holy Spirit and then turn to Christ they will receive salvation by His Grace. For those who have already been given this free Gift from God here is a wonderful understanding about God. Yes this is for the Christian. "Where does God come from" you may have been asked this before by someone who really wants to hear and understand your response. Also you may have been asked that question by someone who really has no desire to learn from your response. Jesus makes it clear and very clear Himself when in (REv 1:8) "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, Says the Lord God, He Who is and Who was and Who is to come, the Almighty (the Ruler of all)." This is what you as a Christian will have no problem grasping.      1) God is the One who Created everything right, so He also fashioned time itself remember He is also called "The Ancient of Days". So since God(Our creator) has the power to create time itself and the world with the universe that also operates by time the way He wants it to with different variations in space, He also made everything when it comes to the universe follow the rules that He has set for it. what do I mean by that statement? In our Human(natural) thinking, something must originate from something because it just makes sense to us. Remember God has taught us(Christians) not to operate or walk by our senses but by our precious faith that has been given to us. What many people fail to see is the awesome intelligence of God.      God made our existence based on "Well this must be here because of that." For someone to even agree that God exists they will be able to realize that God is not just the creator of the universe but also the Ultimate Creator of all that is. God Himself is the original source. He created the very rules that we sometimes discover like "Cause and effect." Since you as a Christian understand that God is the Creator then you understand or now understand that He has no rules to follow except the ones that He places for Himself to follow. With God, something does not have to originate from something because it all originates from Him. I am glad to share this which has been revealed to me and hope you continue to seek Him daily while He may be found.

All in the name of 'your best interests'?      My 20th birthday for example, I didn't want to be a 20 year old virgin, so I asked my friends to help me 'meet women' a few weeks beforehand, while holding the full details. They said sure, well 3 weeks later I still hadn't gotten laid, I decided, whatever. I got an $800 check from family and friends, who told me to have fun. Cashed it out, got my money. I hit the bars for one last attempt the day before my birthday. Well they came out had some fun. They c-blocked me with every woman my friend warned me could be 'easy'. Then to make matters worse, when I told them what I planned to do with the $500 I had left, they took it all! In my attempt to get it back I got arrested for assault. Managed to get out of it by telling them they took my money, 2 of my friends backed me up on it, so the cops let me go and ordered them to give the money back before they got charged with petty-theft. My friends argued about my 'immoral' intentions. The cops seemed cool about it though... Throwing 'This is Canada' back at them and stating 'it's legal here. It's also his body, his money, and his choice' which got me my money back. They even called me a cab and a phone number which he said 'gave a discount to cops'. Well my friends followed the cab and chained me down in the back of one of their trucks. And, well, let's just say I'm still a bitter 20 year old virgin. Thanks to the asinine actions of several people.      So I ask... What makes people think they have the right to decide what's good for me, or the right to get in my way, all in the name of my best interests?
20090220165005AATcnjF	Society & Culture;Languages	Translating English and Spanish?	I was listening to a Spanish song on Youtube, and I wanted to find the Spanish lyrics to it so I could follow along. I new the song in English, so I used an online translator to translate the English version into Spanish, so I could look at the Spanish lyrics. Only, the Spanish song that I was listening to (it was Latin American Spanish) did not match the newly translated Spanish lyrics. It said it was Latin American Spanish. I used a bunch of different websites, but they all came up with the same lyrics that were not the same as in the video. Why would there be two sets of L.A. Spanish lyrics for the same Spanish song; one of which was right?      Well, I ended up finding the "correct" lyrics to the Spanish song, so I translated them into English, using a translating website. Only, the newly translated English version was not the same as the English version I knew. The newly-translated words were pretty different. Now, the song that I was listening to was from a movie......do Spanish-versions of movies have different lyrics than English ones? (When they are translated?)

There was a question that showed a fat american chick, and a slim, and sexy, european girl. Now I know America by far has a higher obesity rate than Europe. But when you combine our obesity rate with Canada's and Mexico's it's only 69.1 . When you combine all of Europe's it's 295.9, and I know this is only because Europe, combined, has a larger population. Basically what i'm trying to say is that America has plenty of Obese people, but also plenty of thin people, like me, and the same can go for Europe (well except the higher obesity rate when not counting Europe as a whole.)      Don't believe me? Link:  http://www.scribd.com/doc/2415430/Countr...

20090220165339AA5UTOa	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If heaven is a kingdom why does God like voting?	It seems rather odd that most of the defining moments in the history of Christianity have involved councils and voting. The canon was decided by vote...and not a unanimous vote for each book either. The Book or Revelation barely got in there.  Popes have been elected by majority vote for hundred of years. Today synods, parishes, and other church jurisdictions vote on everything from ordination of gay clergy, to gay marriage, to women clergy. So God's will seems to be the will of the majority...or maybe it's overturned by the will of the majority.      Since God is an all-powerful king, wouldn't you have thought that he would have made things cut and dried and obvious? So, can we expect heaven to have a legislature accepting or overturning God's declarations just like here on earth?

I've recently been hearing about adults and children being "Indigo's" or children being referred to as "Crystal".      Could someone please explain to me what this means?

I recently graduated college and have a great job, and he's still working at Mc Donalds.      He's made comments before about being upset that I make more money than him, but if he counts the amount of money he steals from the register, he makes much more than me, and works much less.      I need these textbooks for my job and they are expensive.   How should I nicely go about asking him to replace them for me?

20090203080412AAVGhQN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do a large number of atheists take it to the nose when any reference to anything theistic is mention?	Fair play, a religion stipulates a belief in some kinda supernatural being or super valuable state of consciousness but you'd think a lack of faith IS faith the way these atheists carry on.  Here, in "theistic" I include messages of Nirvana or some super valuable state of consciousness that would be our birth right.       This don't imply atheism is a religion. It  merely suggests that some atheists reactions to negativity regarding their beliefs (or lack there of) could almost be construed AS religion. Note also that I say "large number", not "all" atheists.

No lie me and my best Friend when i was a kid would be walking in my neighborhood, and kids would try to start sh*t with us all the time. as i was growing up i had teachers not like me for various reasons. When i was 17 i got a job at a certain electronics store and all 3 of my managers hated me. For no reason whatsoever, even my co-workers and friends couldn't figure out why i was hated so much. I go to parties and me friends of friends and the next day my buddies will tell me that the people i met the previous night hate my guts, how? they never talked more then 5 min with me? How can you hate someone with a passion without really knowing them? I was at a sports bar and i had a little few to drink so i left a short tip on a 60$ bill. I think i left a 5$ bill. Well our waitress knew one of my buddies and she sent him a facebook message saying how much she and her out her co-workers hate me and how if i should show up again i should expect sh*t service. Why would people who Again have never talked more than 5 min to me hate me so much. Why am I hated so much for no real reasons? Me nor my friends and family can figure this stuff out for the life of me

His wife, who works with us, agrees with him. She has long hair and always wears it down. We are the only three in this company and I rarely meet any customers, so I am not exposing my pulled up hair to anyone except my two employers. Is this legal?

Ram sena was wrong in it approach but they made a valid point. These people are frustrated for being overlooked. These people seriously have a good reason to be anxious. As normal citizens, do you think its important to 'listen' to these people's grievances or just bull **** them saying that they are talibani?? After all, its democracy..  According to me, people feel frustrated when their culture is undermined or disrespected.. These are knee jerk reactions but why cant we talk, listen and interact with these people and arrive at a consensus of what is acceptable in indian society rather than singling them out as retards or talibans!

20090220165642AAfr3kg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Islam practices in America?	My husband is Muslim. No comments. They will be deleted.      He is struggling to follow his normal practices while in America. He wasn't raised here, and I have a strong feeling that certain things that he was brought up doing, aren't such major traditions for Muslim-Americans.      Like eating only Kosher. We went home for a week and tried for months before that to find a place that sold Kosher food. There are none. Doesn't that limit the places you could live, if that is all you would eat? I mean.. he doesn't eat pork, ever. But he really struggled when we were back in my hometown (so small).      Are there certain things that arent such a big deal when practicing the Islamic faith? At least in America where we aren't so adapted to it (at least not all of us)?
