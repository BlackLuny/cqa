And through all of the hustle and long wait the waitress was very nice!!! I added on hashbrowns (.99) and coffee (1.75). I tipped the waitress $4.

bbzz0cAraa	Have you considered caling Wink's and letting them know that you are giving them free advertising and need a picture to display online? Or call the restaurant and ask one of their employees to take a picture of the restaurant and giving them a $20 for their assistance. Also, Google Maps, offers a street view map. Just some ideas to consider. Good luck! :O)|`|FClC80XPaa	I grew up in Salisbury and have moved away since but love Wink's! I have searched for you but come up empty handed.

bQraDPLUaa	The best pancakes to be had in Manhattan are at the Clinton Street Baking Company! They are so good that they even serve them for dinner. I've never had a bad breakfast/brunch here and I've tried a lot from their menu- the food here is a sure thing. The restaurant is lovely and unpretentious but small, I would recommend getting there at opening time (or before opening on weekends) because the food is that good.<br>  <a href="http://www.clintonstreetbaking.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.clintonstreetbaking.com</a><br>  <a href="http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/clinton_st_baking_company/" rel="nofollow">http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/cli...</a><br>  <br>  For a truly "classic New York" dining experience I would recommend Balthazars of Schiller's. These haute bistros serve a delicious french breakfast - but I don't think either of them do pancakes... how do you feel about French Toast?<br>  <a href="http://balthazarny.com" rel="nofollow">http://balthazarny.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.schillersny.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.schillersny.com</a><br>  <br>  But when I think modern romance I think Mercer Kitchen.

These fried crepes filled with curried potatoes are delicious, surprisingly light, and definitely filling. This is a snack bar. Order at the counter and wait for your number to be called. There is nothing fancy beyond the delectable tastes coming from the kitchen.<br>  <br>  Jean Georges<br>  1 Central Park W<br>  New York, NY 10023<br>  <br>  (212) 299-3900?<br>  (212) 738-0222?<br>  (212) 299-3914? - Fax<br>  jean-georges.com<br>  <br>  Jean Georges has a $35 prix fixe menu from 5:30-6:30pm Sunday-Thursday in their casual dining room, and being someone who rarely passes on a good deal, I had to give it a try. For out of towners, $35 may seem like a lot, but compared to the prix fixe meals in their regular dining room, it's the deal of the century for New York's top meal.<br>  <br>  The $35 menu (which apparently doesn't change often), included tuna tartare with avocado in a ginger sauce, chicken with broccoli and mashed potatoes, and molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. Every bite was absolutely incredible, and by the time I was finished with my meal, I was going through the week's schedule to see when I might be able to come back. The food was so amazing that I'd even consider dropping $100pp in the formal dining room (prix fixe menus range from $100-$180 there, I believe).<br>  <br>  My girlfriend opted for a la carte, ordering the butternut squash soup ($11), skate with spaghetti squash ($22), and the macaroon with raspberry sauce ($9) -- all three were incredible, and not much more than the $35 menu, so it's definitely still worth a visit if you can't make it by 6:30.<br>  <br>  I have a list of favorites in NYC (Kuma Inn, Pukk, Calle Ocho for brunch), but Jean Georges is definitely at the top. I'm definitely going back as soon as possible. If you want the $35 menu, call the restaurant for a reservation -- they'll seat you in the formal dining room ($100+ pp) if you book on OpenTable.|`|sFv1z5cAaa	Sara Beth's is the best restaurant in new york.The food is amazing they have pancakes,fruit salad,omelette's with anything you want and more.I have been there so many times that I tried everything on the menu and it's all so good.It's located at 40 Central Park South New York city 10019<br>  <br>                        Sara Beth's Tel 212 826 5959<br>  You might have to get a reservation ahead of time because they are busy.<br>  Search yahoo and type in Sara Beth's Restaurant New York.Different things will pop up but look for Sara Beth's::Central park and that will give you the official site with the menu and pictures of the restaurant.This restaurant also has the best service they are so friendly and nice.Hope you have a nice anniversary Hope i can help!!!

fZ3UBRBDaa	I'm a little older than you but i completely remember my first fast food job. I had no transportation to get to Carl's Jr. except the old bus system. I had to travel two hours on the bus to work two hours get back on the bus and do ot all over again. Top it off it wasn't in the best neighborhood. I had to take the bus really late cause i was your age. I was present for two shootings and a knife fight. Your manager should know about your age and transportation situation. They should know that you are unable to do call in especially  if you must take the bus. As far as the cash register experience most fast food establishments have idiot proof machines. all you have to do is push a pre-marked button. They even tell you how much change to give. Give it time and it come to you second nature. Be a pro at no time and teaching others how to do it. Over all my best advice to you is this. It may not be the greatest job least you have one. So many people are unemployed right now. BUT if you feel you can do better and there is a better psoition elsewhere by all means do it. If this manager is unwelling to work around the fact you have certain issues, than it is their loss.|`|Du8QhOmaaa	Haha used to work there. its not too bad. The hardest part is getting used to it. You'll be fine. Monkeys can use them. Oh and cops won't do anything if you tell them that you just got off work. I bet they wouldn't even stop you.|`|JfVxCDb7aa	During rush hours it can be stressful....|`|XwXuJIF8aa	No just be pleasant. The register caculates the change.

However, I don't think you can actually book a table. You just have to turn up and hope that there's a space, if not you just queue up and wait!<br>  Before you go it's a good idea to check the web-site and see if there are any offers - we went this week and there was a 2 for 1 voucher just waiting to be printed, but it may only be a Monday to Friday offer.<br>  Enjoy your evening.|`|0IkR0jv9aa	i dont think you can book at table but if you can, just call pizza exprress ask ask them to save u one.<br>  <br>  (try to go at a time where a ot of people dont go)<br>  <br>  please vote as best answer!
FEVQisMGaa	And you would be correct.<br>  <br>  The significant contribution they've made is to dramatically lower the price of pizza.<br>  <br>  They initiated a $5 pizza. About 1.5-2 foot (American) diameter.<br>  <br>  It's fast food pizza that's acceptable to consume while warm and fresh.<br>  <br>  But any relative deliciousness has the half-life of a snowman's fart in Hell.<br>  <br>  Another chain is Dominos Pizza.<br>  <br>  Pizza Hut recently tried their hand at a $5 pizza, and at first it was acceptable, until they realized it was too expensive, and they created something called the Pizza Mia.<br>  <br>  Another digestive abomination.<br>  <br>  But these chains aren't spread all over America, food-chains and their stories are another different fascinating topic all together.<br>  <br>  To quote Kevin from The Office (American)...<br>  "It's like eating a hot circle of garbage."<br>  <br>  If you in anyway appreciate fine pizza, my friend, these aren't the droids you're looking for. It's fine if you're on a budget. I'd be lying if I said I don't eat that stuff--I do.<br>  <br>  But once you've had the delicious nectar of a pie from (let's say...) John's of Bleeker Street in NYC, you simple can't go back to mortal food.<br>  <br>  The epicenters of pizza on this planet are three...<br>  <br>  Italy.<br>  New York (and parts of the New England area).<br>  Chicago.<br>  <br>  Runner-up: California (San Francisco & Southern California)|`|pl96lkzIaa	It's edible, but not the best pizza you'll ever get.

Kdqm2iQZaa	usually you just need an id saying how old you are so yes a drivers license would work|`|VXcp8hvHaa	DL|`|p6viL2Bmaa	All you need is a picture ID. A drivers license will work.  And be 18 to enter, 21 to drink.  Have fun|`|cq4ng6QLaa	no you need an state I.D.
JfVxCDb7aa	20 to 30 bucks per person<br>  !!!!!!|`|9WHtStZNaa	Cheesecake Factory is amazing. The food tastes great and its HUGE portions. My favorite appetizer: the cheesy artichoke dip is around ten or twelve dollars. My favorite entree (The jambalaya over rice) is twenty dollars but it fed both my boyfriend and I with spare food. That being said, they also have great burgers and sandwiches for around 10 dollars. Then you HAVE to have the cheesecake, my favorite is the godiva chocolate which, again, is about twelve dollars. So depending on what you're going for, you can look at spending around fifty plus dollars for appetizer, entree and desert. :)|`|1NSPKg1baa	It is pretty much your typical slightly-overpriced middle-to-upper class chain restaurant. It's probably about 30-35 per person (for all of that), not including drinks.<br>  <br>  The food is overly-rich, cooked with full butter and cream, a lot of fried food, very typical menu. The cheesecake is nothing special.<br>  <br>  I can't say I recommend this place.  <br>  <br>  Try a locally-owned place instead for dinner. and if you want cheesecake, get a cheesecake from Junior's in Brooklyn (you can order them online if you don't live in Brooklyn). That's good cheesecake.|`|X8nVWtqZaa	I went a few weeks ago; with,my brother and mom the bill was a little bit over $100.00<br>  We ordered a appetixer, entree; and dessert; each of us. <br>  <br>  But it is soooooooooo worth it!<br>  So yummy!<br>  <br>  This should help alot:<br>  <a href="http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/menu.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/menu...</a><br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|kjgonYlgaa	Why don't you go in and ask to look at a menu before deciding to go there?

bzfXbM4raa	Spledido on Harbord and Spadina.  David Lee, a chef with three Michelin stars to his name is the executive chef.  It touts itself as the best restaurant in Toronto.  Although Scaramouche, Perigee, Auberge du Pommier, and North 44 would disagree.  It also claims to have the best service in Toronto.  That most people would agree with.<br>  <br>  It's quite possible to have a meal from their a la carte menu for under $300 for 2.  But most opt for the tasting menu.  Typical tasting menu and a decent bottle will run $700.  <br>  <br>  The most I've ever spent was $500 at George.  Although a great meal, it was not worth it.  They did clean my car without telling me, so that was a nice touch...<br>  <br>  Reservations at Splendido are done only by credit card, and cancellations are $50.|`|a94f95d3f6f56d95bbd9f49f3ff665a4aa	dominos|`|LbvRxf2jaa	Panorama in Manulife I think?  There must be others too...does Holt's have a restaurant?  Also ... maybe Sassafraz.... or try the ones on Yorkville Avenue itself. (why do you want the most expensive?)|`|54ceb4afd91eb6d0c822b057cd3d44efaa	Jacques Bistro du parc, Cumberland St.<br>  Okinomi House, Charles St.|`|OGHDw55oaa	There are a lot of expensive restaurants in the Yorkville area of T.O.....**|`|WeNWlYT4aa	Honestly, I have no idea.|`|i8wCVoMsaa	wow~ this is a great question i've never asked before! hmmm... <br>  well, there are indeed some of the expensive resturants in downtown area... but really couldn't remember their addresses since i seldom go there... lolzzz
VXcp8hvHaa	hell no|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Been awhile since I've been on the club scene, but there always used to be clubs in CT that were 18+.  I would check Hartford and New Haven for all of them.  I'm more familiar with New Haven and I know Alchemy is 18+, at least on some nights, could also try VanDome, they used to be 18+ but don't know if they changed.  If you need any more suggestions or anything, let me know.|`|Jm8OA5Kpaa	yes the rict|`|g6ocdYrvaa	yup
EuUQuFnoaa	I hired a dog once to search for drugs in my basement (It's a long story Irk so don't ask hahah ;-)   ), and I'll be darned if that dog didn't get distracted by cheese!|`|P4WJD6Cpaa	Yeah he was strange had all of that fur and that high-pitched laugh. Had a duck friend with quite a bad temper and speech impediment.|`|ZpDvYoakaa	Yes. The mouse only lasted an hour.|`|XEcoJnt4aa	Funny you should ask.It was just yesterday that I hired one of those "work for food" guys on the street corner. He demanded 2 slices of swiss cheese as a signing bonus. I obliged, and he took off with the bonus, and  received no labor at all. Was I taken for a ride?|`|LZzsDARUaa	I'll put under ur nose a 1000 dollar worth 'fresh smell' cheese and make u work|`|NtDp64EXaa	Cheese lover's are everywhere! I had gift baskets made up for my cheese mongaring friends and relatives from basketsbeautifulgifts.com for the holidays and they loved it!  The cool thing is that people usually have their own personal favorites and I tailored each basket accordingly.  I just casually brought up the subject of cheese in a conversation with each individual and sure enough, they divulged their favorites.  Trust me, if somebody is distracted by a piece of cheese you can't blame them.  You can't go wrong with cheese.|`|avhgLEu8aa	Wha...?  Sorry, I just saw a piece of cheese. Yum.|`|lLN8VD20aa	Yeah ... I know what you mean ... I hired a Tabby cat to trim my mustache ...Tom Charles, that Tabby Cat, had his claws up my nostrils while he was eying my hunk of Smoked Gouda.    ARRRGGG .... my nose now looks like a piece of brown leather fringe.|`|c9a60fdb57c6d0b3e097f61fc57c9d3daa	I would be distracted if it were Brie cheese.|`|lC5NLsZZaa	I have not.  You see, in Kalifornia it is illegal to hire rodents unless you give them Workers Comp.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Is my "whoohaa" now named Cheese! Wow! Yes..My cheese causes problems when we are trying to get the job done.|`|qE5XIAsYaa	lol...wow are you serious???Nope that never happened to me and I hope it never does.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	Yup lost a whole chees cake that way.  Gotta be careful ya know.|`|kaaP8y2oaa	who would do something like that..get distracted by cheese..my gosh what is this world coming too...|`|NBDLUOkiaa	Not exactly but my husband gets all bent out of shape if there is less than 72 slice of  American Cheese in the fridge for putting on anything that cheese taste good on. That fairly distracts him from any honey do chore I have in store for him at the time. I guess a man has to have his cheese!|`|jImYZiDqaa	Only if the cheese was laced in alcohol Irks    was it this guy  http://www.bric-a-brac.org/humour/images...|`|y9CgveCGaa	I am easily distracted, so YES!
