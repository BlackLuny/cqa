qGfAlDd2aa	They are not for everyone.  In my case I went for a HSA (Health care Savings Account) because it was the best for my situation.    Since this is for your paper, here is my opinion.  One of the big problems with insurance in general is that people don't see it as money for which they have to be responsible.  "I'll have that elective procedure because it will only cost me $50 and insurance will pay for the rest".  That raises insurance costs, which raises rates, and costs us all money.  This is also one of the fallacies with Government Sponsored Universal Health care.  Look at Medicare and Medicaid and all the fraud and costs there.  That's Government Health care!    Health care savings accounts shift the responsibility back on the individual.  Now it IS the person's own money so they will be more likely to make value judgments with it.  The fallacy with this is, many people can't manage their own money now.  They never were taught finance 101 (look at the mortgage mess).      So there will always be a percentage of the population that can't make any program work.  No matter who is in charge or who keeps the money.

WYzVw19Uaa	I have a simillar problem just that I put in the correct routing number than right after it came the (didn't know that) check number a little space and the Account Number, thats how I entered it on my Tax Return (efile) it got accepted by the IRS this morning, after that I found out about the Error from a friend of mine and contacted the IRS if they can change it by erasing the first 4 digits but of course they can't. Called my Bank about the situation and they are trying to help me by routing it into the correct account but have to call on the 11th (Direct Deposit Date 02/13) and from that day on daily to check the list for the Deposit rejections. Call your Bank ask for Bookkeeping!!!!!!!!!|`|DV4xyeChaa	wow latin america...i only do business with Pakistan and india...if only they spoke english im sure id get better results...generally all have same   of digits...keep after it..call often...keep a log of what was said by what operator..and send a registered letter...do it....i know because i spent 8 months,,100 phone calls and 10 letters dealing with a stolen credit card from capital one...every time i got a different operator,,put on hold,,hung up on....dont let it slide....good luck

While the employer IS responsible for providing you with this form, it is YOUR responsibility to include those earnings on your tax return, with or without a 1099.      Also, if the employer does not prepare a 1099 and send copies to you and the IRS, then the IRS will have no way of knowing what you earned and will not be able to accuse you of not reporting.|`|AA11591656	Well technically, they have all of January to give you a 1099 so wait and see, and then call them Monday.|`|QgXN2kB6aa	they have till monday, so give it till friday or call them.

AA10469473	There are a number of issues here.    First of all, depending on the exact dates of when she left and when the kids went back with her, you might or might not even be able to claim them since from your question it sounds like they probably lived with her a little longer in the year than they did with you.    Second, you say she left in July but don't say when.  If it was into July at all, you can't file as head of household, since you were still legally married as of the end of the year, if you lived together at ANY time after June 30.  And if you can't file HofH, many of the child related credits aren't available.    But if you are filing separately, there is no requirement to share your refund unless a court order or agreement says you do.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Yes!|`|VXkOZ4rEaa	no its your enjoy!    you are under no lawful obligation to give her a dime|`|96107c5bf43893adbb0a8444778f9812aa	It is really up to both of you to decide,but since they lived with you ,you can claim them.But if you are going to or behind on support they might take it!|`|AA11284831	If your spouse left the marital home in July, you are NOT eligible to file as Head of Household!  To qualify for HoH you must not have lived with your spouse at ANY time in the entire last half of 2008.  Even one day in July kills it for you.  Therefore if you don't file a joint return with her your ONLY option is Married Filing Separately.    If the children lived with her for the last 3 months of the year then SHE is the one entitled to claim them as they would have spent the most number of nights with her, not you, if you split up on or after July 1, 2008.  Add up the number of nights that each child spent with each of you.  The greatest number of nights is the custodial parent and that is the parent who can claim the children unless you voluntarily surrender the exemption to the other using Form 8332 or a similar written statement.    While a specifically worded court order CAN determine which of you can claim the child(ren), you don't have one so that's irrelevant in your case.    If you decide to file a joint return with your estranged spouse it will be up to the two of you to decide how to split any refund.  The IRS has no dog in that fight and will NOT get involved in any disputes over that.  You CAN spit a refund into two direct deposit payments if you can agree in advance as to who gets what.  Any paper check will be issued in both names and you will both have to endorse it to cash it.|`|A9BuuJUTaa	I really hate to disappoint you but you are probably not Head of Household filing status and she can probably claim the children not you.    According to table xx in pub 501 you can't be HOH if your spouse lived with you even 1 day in the last 6 months of the year.  Also you can't be HOH unless you can claim a child as a dependent unless that child isnt being claimed as a dependent by you because the other spouse is claiming them and that child lived with you more than half the year.  So your only choice for filing status would be married filing jointly or married filing separately.    If you choose married filing separately there are many deductions and credits that are eliminated or reduced.  As to the dependency issue, it appears that you and your spouse qualify to claim the children, but only one of you can claim them.  IRS doesn't care who claims each child as long as long as they are eligible.  If you can't agree on who will claim them the IRS will decide using the tie breaker rules which are; if only 1 of the persons claiming the child then the parent wins, if both persons claiming the child are parents then the parent that the child lived with the longest wins, if the child lived with both parents the same amount of time then the parent with the highest Adjusted Gross Income wins.    As to your original question about having to share the refund, you would not have to share it unless you filed a joint return with her.  Now the divorce judge might order you to share it as part of the marital assets but federal tax law doesn't require you to.

In debit card, you put money in an account; and the card leaks it out. If it is free of charge, usually this means you give up the interest payable on your money, or maybe you pay fees.  ATM cards are a rip, because the original purpose of the bank is to eliminate actual live tellers, saving about forty thousand a year per machine; but that was the start, soon they realised they could charge people for every transaction because they were "convenient".

Pjm9pg7iaa	In 1995, there were several companies that would link you with a company that would pay you $400 a month if you would "wrap" your car with the company advertising. They preferred cars that were distinctive: sports cars or vans.  This idea turned out to be a complete flop. Businesses did not see their sales go up by $400 a month. They were losing money instead of making money. So there is not one company today that will pay you to advertise on your car.  A few years ago there were websites offering to fix you up with advertisers for a small fee. $60.  But all you got was a list of businesses from the phone book and told to contact them. Most of them were shut down since they were scammers. I hope they don't come back..|`|llTqn0Tbaa	yes, some even provide the gas and car  sometimes you can keep it
0cd7030137d609db5865ec5a97d51d70aa	As a general rule, Awards & Honors are only worth mentioning if:    1) you have limited professional experience and/or are just out of school, or    2) they are directly related to your career or the position you are seeking.    I think you would be better off mentioning your actual professional experience. And don't make the mistake that many people do of writing one resume and considering the job done. A resume should be customized for each and every job you apply for, making sure that the details and qualifications that you mention are in alignment with the skills and qualifications listed in the job description.    Another thing about Awards & Honors... I think in many instances, awards and honors basically tell a hiring manager that you are dedicated to certain interests and/or thrive well in group situations. this is not a bad thing, so don't be shy about listing awards if you have them. Just don't include them at the expense of relevant work experience.    Good luck with your resume.|`|FhSKRB7Kaa	I see you posted your question in technology so I assume you are in the same field.

Yes you should leave the awards and honors section blank (unless these are mandatory) and emphasize more on your skillset and importantly your relevant experience.    Good Luck

fkwYvFBRaa	If you are looking for self-publishing companies to publish your book, I know of a few companies that practically holds court to everything a book needs from getting you your copyright, size preferences, book cover design customization, layout consultation, copyediting and even marketing  at affordable costs.         The difference with self-publishing is that you happen to send in your materials to the publisher and they will do all the work for you depending on which program you are on. Publishing packages are very affordable and investing on getting your book published is a good start.      Most self-publishing companies have programs that costs about $250 to $12999 and is highly dependent on the kind of services that you will be getting which is why it is very significant to carefully map out your book's budget as early as now.         Publishing companies now have all the resources to publish books with the same productivity and efficacy as that of regular black and white books. Considering the fact that most books are in full color, you should choose a publishing company whose books are of the highest quality, bar none.         Xlibris Publishing is one of those companies who truly boasts of their books top quality as your book is printed on acid-free 50lb library-edition paper. That alone can give your book a longer shelf life and durable pages.         Self-publishing entirely means that you get to retain full control of your books production and that it gives you the option to publish your work and claim authority of the photos that you have chosen to be published.         Publishing is synonymous to getting that copyright for protecting your book which is why it is highly important to publish it.         You can get free information sent to your mail here and even try to check the quality of their brochure because it is the same as how they publish books. The cost to publish is also listed in detail and in depth.      I hope I helped.|`|a6ef03634d4abd05e410b591fe483122aa	Sad to say but Asian Printers are cheap so why not publish it on ya own ?|`|sISu7Yahaa	k

0bf519503def383f410f5a983fcd76c4aa	The biggest hedge funds and investment banks hire Ph.D.s from places like MIT to develop trading strategies.  Any worthwhile positions where arbitrage might exist are immediately exploited.    Think about it like this.  If the masses could earn riskless profits in excess of transaction fees with just a few econ courses in their back pockets, how long do you think the opportunities would exist in an efficient or semi-efficient market?    If you want to pursue a trading strategy that doesn't simply track a index, read up on some of the persistent return anomalies (i.e. momentum, book to market) in the finance academic literature.  These are still contentious among academicians, so don't expect to find a how-to guide.|`|18f3b46cb43805dc72078b84b50e3885aa	I recommend you visit the finance section of your local library and or bookstore.|`|7f8389a753feea5b496c6ac4cf146b6aaa	Typically it won't be worth it at the individual level.  You're talking about making multi-million dollar transactions to profit off of tenth of a cent differentials in exchange rates.  By the time you do recognize an arbitrage opportunity, a more savvy investor with more capital has already taken advantage of the opportunity.  Plus, there is an additional risk of losing your whole investment because in these transactions you are a "creditor."  If the party on the other side of the transaction doesn't have the funds/currency promised in the transaction, you lose out.|`|AA12328843	very easy. contact www.stocksidea.com. they have answer of this

AA10144492	The best routes to take are to research the process of starting a business as well as the industry you're interested in.    I recommend checking out the SBA, Entrepreneur, The Start Up Journal & Nolo. All 4 are great informational resources for the new/small business owner. I posted links for you in the source box.    Associations may be a good avenue to explore as well. These organizations will address many of the thoughts, questions and concerns you'll inevitably have as well as many you haven't anticipated yet. See the source box for some relevant links.     Research, research, research  this cannot be stressed enough. Read as much as you can about the industry. Here are some book titles that are relevant:    * Pocket Guide to Home Health Care by Karen McGough Monks  * Handbook of Home Health Standards and Documentation -- Guidelines for Reimbursement by T. M. Marrelli  * Handbook of Home Health Orientation by T. M. Marrelli  * Manual of Home Health Nursing Procedures by Robyn Rice    There are plenty of free informational resources out there.

4ZNl4V3Oaa	No, it won't have any impact on your 401(k).  Income passes through the LLC in the same characterization as if the LLC did not exist.  Rental income isn't earned income and therefore isn't eligible for contributions to a 401(k).|`|ZeDjn4cVaa	Real estate rental income is passive income (except for real estate professionals - see below) and follows the passive income rules.  Passive income cannot be used as the basis for 401K or other retirement plan contributions.    The ability to deduct net rental losses with active participation subject to AGI limitations will be unchanged by moving  the properties  to an LLC where you are a member/partner.    Real estate rental income is not passive income for a person who qualifies as a "real estate professional" as defined in the IRS regulations. These are very strict criteria and very difficult to meet, even for people who think of themselves as real estate professionals. If you are a real estate professional then your net rental income qualifies you for unlimited deduction of losses.  But even for real estate professionals  it does not seem that rental income becomes earned income or income that can form the basis of retirement contributions.

So if the policy is through a parent's employer, THAT is the person that gets refunded.      If the insurance is YOURS, not your parent's insurance, as in, through YOUR employer, not through their employer, then the payment should have been made to you.  Assuming you're 18.    The next step, is to request your provider to refund the money to you - and then it's up to them, to collect the money back from your parents.

So, using the first set of rules, the foodstamps weren't provided by the child, so they have no effect on the answer.  Using the second set of rules, the foodstamps weren't provided by you, so they do affect the answer.

AA10464818	Sell products that people actually want.     If you want to earn serious money from eBay, you need to have a well-thought out business model. Selling on ebay is getting tougher -- just look at the number of auctions that closes without a bid. Go to the boards on ebay and you will hear even oldtimers complaining about how stiffer competition plus higher fees make it so much harder to sell on ebay.    Buying from garage sales and selling on eBay is fun, and good getting a few dollars here and there from ebay. Sometimes, you luck out on an item and hit big, but many times it will just be so-so (assuming you can even get the price you paid for it). In terms of fun factor, it is great. But from a business stand-point, it is not sustainable.    One success model of ebay is the couple Jay and Marie Senese (username jayandmarie) of the 1-cent CD fame. They have the highest positive feedback number of all sellers on eBay. Their business model is to buy very low cost CDs in bulk (those that CD stores sell in their discount bins) and offer them on ebay at a starting price of 1 cent http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/con... Their success is based on the fact that they stumbled on a sustainable business model with products that people really want. They sold their business -- where else but on ebay -- for $5 million! Now that is success.      eBay has several ways for you to determine exactly what the hot items to sell on their marketplace:     Items In Demand = the most popular items currently within that particular category. To see the In Demand page, go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/sell...      Hot Items by Category Report = a monthly report that lists the fastest growing categories on eBay for the previous month. Go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/what... and select "Hot Items by Category" from the menu on the left.     eBay Pulse = "a daily snapshot of current trends, hot picks, and cool stuff on eBay". Go to http://pulse.ebay.com/ to see eBay Pulse in action.     Merchandising Calendar = eBay promotes specific categories on its home page each month. Savvy eBayers know that this home page exposure results in more interest in such categories. Go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/cale...  to view the current Merchandising Calendar.    For managing ebay listings, I use Timbercreek's Sold! http://www.timbercreeksoftware.com/... - it can create invoices, schedule your listings, manage multiple auctions, manage customers, track payments receive, etc. You can use other tools as there are myriad other products in the market available to help in ebay selling    As for items to sell, you can:    1. Buy bulk liquidation items such as those at Liquidation.com http://www.liquidation.com . The capitalization may be big, but the idea is to sell the items individually and profit from it.    2. Find manufacturers of items you want to sell and buy discounted items from them    3. Make deals with retailers in your area, and offer to buy their unwanted items for deep discounts. jayandmarie - the most successful ebay sellers - made deals with music stores where they will buy the entire inventory in the discounted bins, and then sold the items on ebay for 1-cent starting bid.    4. Look for possible partners on the Web, preferably outside of the US. Import items from them and sell them on ebay. There's huge profits to gain from this approach.    5. Go to outlet stores. But focus on BRAND names. No-names are useless (and are not guaranteed to be sold on the first listing). A family member of mine has an arrangement with the clerks in the Coach bag outlet and they call her when the store has a big discount. A handbag that retails for $238, she may be able to get that for half the price -- and it usually ends up selling as much as the retail price.|`|92fd69a0960dc0314607a31fc6851f63aa	not everyone in eBay can make money as much as they want, there millions of seller in ebay.

If you have lots of items all the time, have an ebay store and have categories for similar items so people bidding on one type of item can find similar items you are selling easily.    take advantage of price differences in different states and countries (IE something costs a lot in NYC but is cheap in your town, put it on eBay so NYC buyers can save money, or something is cheap here and costs twice as much in Germany, put it on German eBay (ebay.de) so those customers can save some money and you can profit).  that's all I can think of

ATlZiDw9aa	Apply for a VISA or Mastercard to start.  They will check your credit report and determine what the limit is for your card which maybe only $1000.  When you receive the card, start using it to charge simple things like gasoline and groceries.  When you receive the bill, pay the card off IN FULL promptly.  They will not charge you for the use of the card or interest when you use it in that manner.  As you build up your history of using the card to near it's max and paying in full PROMPTLY, you can request an increase in the max limit.  You can then request another card from another company and repeat the process but do not cancel the first card. As you show responsibility for handling credit, the report will improve for you.<br>  <br>  Start here with no annual fee and cash back.

Specialized trade magazines often have a careers section for job openings across the country, and many of them pay very well. So, just because a company has not posted an opening in the local paper does not mean the job is not posted anywhere else.    Smaller companies with little or no HR department staff can be easily overwhelmed with correspondence (letters, emails, calls, etc) if they advertise an opening (especially for a good paying job) too broadly. These companies may instead rely on their employees to recommend friends and colleagues who are qualified, which also makes the screening process much easier.    It's all in who you know.

One to inventory and organize the parts, another to read and direct the directions, another to hand the tools and parts as needed, others to actually assemble the bike and another to present the finished product and to tell the group what they learned.  Each member of the group decided among themselves who would handle each part of the project.  We had upper management getting direction from young newly hired employees.  They all knew they had to work together to efficiently complete the task and egos had no place.  The best part was we had arranged previously with a local "home" for boys and girls to come at a prearranged time to receive a special gift.  The teams had no idea.  Once the bikes were assembled and presentations given of what they all learned, we brought in 6 boys and girls to give them their new bikes.

U7nj9Kg4aa	your best bet is to find a lisensed insurance borker.  If you have health concerns shopping online will be absolutely useless.  They will quote you the best rate for preferred health typically to reel you in, then the premiums jump up once they find out how healthy you really are.  A broker can assess your health issues and find an insurance company that can help you out with the best rates available.<br>  <br>  also, given that you are going on a cruise, your rates may be affected by where you care going to.  Are you going near any third world type places or places where disease is common?  Going near any places with civil conflicts or wars?

The value of these investments will fluctuate. Upon Annuitization or withdrawal, earnings in an annuity grow tax-deferred. Earnings are taxable to the owner.

12dbe2364bc5975dd394b7fdc85d1d8caa	I think you have the wrong idea of the wash sale rule.    It's really quite simple:    As long as you sell a stock you own for a loss, and do NOT buy it back for 31 days, you can show the loss on paper for the IRS. You can buy the stock back on the 32nd day and trade it again.     It is possible ( If you are not a good trader ) to have a loss offset all of your trading gains for the year )    Go to IRS.GOV and type in wash sale. You will get the exact wording.

AA11370600	Usually all items involving the property will be handled by the trustee. This is the person you most likely need to speak to. You may need to go to the court house to find out who this is but at this point in time you may want to start looking for a new place to live since whom ever ends up buying this property will most likely not want to be landlords.    Also, you may need to seek the advise of an attorney if you have deposits with the landlord. It may be hard to get those funds back if he is going into BK.

2N6oTOLQaa	The bottom line is that you need to make more than you spend. There are two aspects to this: earning money, and spending money.     First, evaluate your spending. Make sure you have a written budget and stick to it. Many people don't budget because they see a budget as a straight-jacket that won't let them have any fun. This is not the case. Its perfectly okay to budget for fun or unnecessary expenses, the budget is just a tool to make sure you don't get out of control in those areas. A written budget will help you direct where your money goes.    You should also keep track of your spending. This helps you ensure that your budget is accurate. It also helps you identify areas where you are spending too much.     Once you have spending under control, you can decide what, if anything, you want to do about earning extra income. You could work a 2nd job if necessary. You should also have a plan of where you want to be in 5 years and how you plan to get there. Maybe that means taking some classes or getting together the funds for a business, or maybe it just means working hard at your current job to try to get a raise or promotion. Whatever your goal is, remember that if you aim at nothing you will hit it every time. |`|wADsOOILaa	If you can't cut your budget, you get a second job.|`|3ttM4gsLaa	You need to get on Dave ramseys' total money makeover.

You'd have to be one of two or three people in the world, probably.    All that said, you could get involved in videogame design.

It's not JUSt a hobby, or something they do on a lark.    You really have to be up to that level now if you want to pursue it.

141749692cc0d1dbaa4f75c81a16fbc2aa	I would like to suggest that you endeavour to be clear and concise in your cover letter.  Once you have determined what you want to say (and how you will say it) you might choose to "doll it up".    However, this should not be done at the expense of creating a clear, on-target letter. Your reader will probably have a full workload (read: busy), and will appreciate anything you can do to make his/her job easier in evaluating your application/request.    For example, if you are writing a cover letter with attached resume, you'll want to note how your qualifications make you particularly suitable for the position, and what unique talents you'll bring to the job and/or organization.

882034916bd7229c91965207ddab86ffaa	I have friends who have used Quicken Loans for exactly what you are trying to do - get all your bills into lower interest payments.  Just make sure you get the best deal possible.  Also, an added benefit of going through a mortgage company to lower your bills is that the interest on your payments is usually tax deductible.      You'll need to talk to a mortgage professional to get the best advice, but I wouldn't hesitate to use Quicken Loans if I needed to get my bills in order.  You can find info on Quicken's website at www.quickenloans.com     Search around the site for specific articles about lowering your bills. I think mortgage pros use the term "consolidate debt" for what you are trying to do.|`|1bfe1345a5e2849a912da98b653d88b9aa	nope|`|f9b5a20310940600981211fcc3ff0a5baa	My brother works for them, i have,t used them be he says they are great fo re-fi
VG4gKiggaa	Sweetheart, I hate to break it to you, but somebody had to EARN the money to put in those investments. It didn't fall from the clouds. You do not have to be rich, white, Republican or elitist to have investment income. All you have to do is live on less than you make & put some in investments either through 401k, IRA, etc. or in other investments. People who do smart things with their money don't need to be taxed more just because they don't still have to be a wage slave!    Also, this tax the rich mentality is generally bull. The wealthy people & corporations ALREADY pay the VAST MAJORITY of income taxes, while I have done returns for people making from $15-100k that pay negative (get EIC), none or only a few bucks in tax b/c they have a bunch of snot-nosed kids they can't afford & are mortgaged to their eyeballs. For most of our working lives to this point our household income was in that range. We bought a very modest home & have only 1 adopted teen (adopted when we were in our late 20s & he was 15). We get screwed by the tax code for living w/in our means & investing for our own & our family's future, so this 'tax those mean old rich people' w/ their snotty "unearned" income really hacks me off.    Furthermore, except for a bunch of schmuck celebs made famous by the following of a bunch of mindless proles, very few "rich" people are "idle". One of my grandfathers is a millionaire. He has spent most of his time & money since retirement for the good of his church, camps for handicapped children, buying glasses for children of working poor people, etc.    If you want to read about the REAL "rich" people in this country, pick up a copy of the book below. I strive to emmulate many of the characteristics of the people profiled there. They are financially secure, hard-working people of good character. They don't deserve to be punished for it & neither do your parents! You sound like an ungrateful brat & if you don't develop some sound judgement, I hope your parents leave their millions to someone else!    Btw, there is no "k" in "collect".|`|93b942e36a4d3ec10311e003407e2041aa	There are issues of both fairness and economic reality here.  First of all, it has been conclusively proven that tax cuts INCREASE revenues, decreasing the burden on the lower and middle class.  Any incentive on savings and investments also stimulates economic growth.    Now the "fairness" issue:  First, the producer of this personal wealth did not become rich by being "idle."  He became that way by being productive, thus offering economic growth and opportunity to the rest of society.  Now that he's accumulated wealth and already paid more taxes than you and I in terms of both amount and percentage, you want to tax him again when he chooses to care for his family.|`|dXeYjVW3aa	It is becuase rich people  run this country and they all belive in  letting the rich become richer.  I fthis was not so then  we would not be in a defficet.  maybe the money will all equal out and  people will work  harder or  more  cause they know that regardless we all make the same  pay and  we all deserve it?  maybe?  I like that system that cuba has that drs nurses and  even a dishwasher is  making all the same pay and  there is not so many class struggling and class wars like  we have here and  in other places where if you have money  they think you have class and better than others|`|AA11957106	Props to you.  It is very unusual to find someone who believes in "Right first, Me second".  Most Repubs believe that people with money are usually interested in MORE money.  If they have money they will make an effort to make more by starting or expanding a business  or investing which will allow a business to expand or diversify and in doing so create jobs which allows more people to make money thru wages.|`|ug00j0S8aa	As far as dividends are concerned, if I own stock in XYZ corporation and XYZ corporation makes a profit, XYZ corporation pays income tax on that profit.  What is left then belongs to the corporation, which means to the owners, the stockholders.  If XYZ pays part of that leftover money as dividends (to me), I still pay income tax, even though XYZ already did.  I don't agree with all the tax cuts, but if you are relatively low income, the rates on dividends are even lower, and because of other cuts the rates on regular income are also lower.

Punto para el gas LP  -El precio por unidad de energa producida entre un gas y el otro es prcticamente es el mismo, ligeramente mas barato el gas natural si consumes grandes volmenes. Punto para el gas natural.  -El gas natural tiene una densidad menor que el gas LP, de modo que en caso de fuga la formacin de mezclas explosivas en la atmsfera adyacente es  menos probable que en el caso del gas LP. Punto para el gas natural.   -El gas LP tiene el inconveniente de que a bajas temperaturas vaporiza poco, de modo que podras tener problemas de suministro a tus calderas, an con tanque lleno. El gas natural no tiene ese problema. Punto para el gas natural.  -A grandes consumos y operacin ininterrumpida, el gas natural resulta mas conveniente, ya que es garanta de que nunca te va a faltar. En cambio el gas LP requiere de suministros constantes. Punto para el gas natural.  -A bajos consumos y operacin no contnua, el gas LP es mejor, ya que no pagas "por tenerlo almacenado". En cambio el distribuidor de gas natural te cobra un cargo bimestral por mantenimiento de la red (una especie de renta), consumas o no el combustible. Punto para el gas LP.  -El suministro de gas natural est limitado a zonas donde exista red disponible (tuberas, pues). El suministro de gas LP puede llegar a donde tu quieras. Punto para el gas LP.  -Los costos de instalacin y mantenimiento son casi similares, aunque el tanque de gas LP por norma tienes que cambiarlo a los diez a?os. Punto para el gas natural.

You have the option even in commercial for interest only and negative amortization loans if that flavor suits you.     If available I would also recommend the 30 year fixed but depending on the building and its use you may find that the shorter term loans will work better for you.

8M5C8T5Uaa	no its extremly legit but think about it carefully.    It takes like $.75 to bid once and increase the cost by  $.15 and each bid increases the time left on the clock for around 15 seconds and at the end you still have to pay for the item.    Now this is a huge profit for them because once you bid once normal people would be emotionally invested into bidding again because thry already invested some money but with a system like swoopo's they don't reward someone for bidding at the last second or constantly bidding becasue it increases the time so the only way for you to win is if everyone else doesn't want to buy it anymroe because the price was increased by way too much so that its no longer a huge profit.

That is a gross figure, not taking into account taxes, medical, retirement, or other 'benefits' you pay for.    If it's full-time, just multiple the dollar amount by 2080 to get a yearly amount. :)

Apparently the government are trying to get the lenders to be a bit more lenient because of all the negative equity. In short your house gets repossessed and you'll have to find rented accommodation until the market sorts itself out.    x|`|e00fc1c299d34a3d8c47805b7ceab0a4aa	If youre made redundant, lose it through illness then your insurance should cover it for a year. If it doesnt, the mortgage lender will eventually take court proceedings. If they evict you (which they will if you cant pay anything) you have 28 days to leave (or mebbe 56 if you have kids, a disability etc). But well before that you should have either got yourself on the housing list with the council or started looking at private rented. If people get help soon enough, they may end up in a crappy b and b but they shouldnt end up on the streets.|`|doeg7JSaaa	Negotiate with the mortgage company asap and most will settle for interest only payments until you are in employment again.  Be totally honest with them, don't beg but tell the whole truth sooner rather than later and they will try to help.

You don't get any of your rent money back|`|70307caa83c699ebeeab5f9a105c8188aa	you only get the security back nothing else|`|7b231ffb7a34e101011da695aa3bd858aa	You should get your damage deposit back less the value of repairing anything done to walls etc.|`|AA12054896	I'm assuming you mean the deposit. As long as you give the notice that is required of you in the contract, and have everything in move out order. I would have them walk through with you at least two weeks before you move out and sign a list of items that may need to be fixed or cleaned.|`|6702996c4cbb1036e21ea3ca6a066566aa	Assuming you have a 12-month lease and you stay for the entire time and leave the place in the same condition as when you moved in (some wear-and-tear is usually allowed as long as it's not excessive), you should receive most or all of your deposit back.    I say "most" because even if you leave the place in perfect condition some landlords just standardly say they have to pay professional cleaners to come in after you to clean carpets, bathrooms, kitchens, etc even if you cleaned them yourself.  So they could withhold that money from your deposit regardless, you should have this info in your lease agreement.  Depending on how much these professional services tell the landlord they have to clean will determine how much comes out of your deposit, so you should still leave it as clean as you can, touch up any nail holes in the walls, etc.    When you move in, do a very thorough walk-through and make sure all existing damage is documented in your lease.  Since filling out these little areas in your lease noting damage can be diffiult, take pictures of the place before you move in and after you leave, just in case the landlord decides to take advantage of you.    As your lease comes to an end, you usually have the option of renewing it or sometimes it just changes to a month-to-month arrangement, so check your agreement or ask your landlord.  You should always give 30 days notice when you want to renew or move out after the lease is up.    If you break your lease by leaving early, you will not only lose the deposit, but the landlord will probably make you pay rent for the remaining months left in your lease or up until he finds a replacement tenant for you, plus his cost to advertise, clean up, and find someone again.  Future landlords could require references, so don't burn your bridges with your landlord.    Lastly, if you are ever unhappy with your landlord or certain conditions of the property, always try to work it out with the landlord first.  If that fails, go to court and let them decide if you are allowed to get out.  Never just decide to break the lease on your own, you will probably lose if you do.|`|bgJMglpbaa	if you had a 1 year lease, you give the proper notice (usually 30 day's) , the apartment is left in good condition (clean with no damage), and all of your rent is current...then you will receive your deposit back less any fee's agreed apon in the lease. If any part of your lease say's nonrefundable for part of your deposit you will not receive that back.|`|AA10704364	Are you talking about a damage deposit?

If you have a overdraft amount on your a/c, then you should be able to go up to that amount, but if you have never used it, it may take a phone call to make sure it's ok, a quick phone call will sort it out and set your mind at rest.

AA11573642	You have raised a very important question regarding customer relationship.  It is very important that the customer service establishes rapport  with a customer service conversation is  as important as its beginning, as it should create a positive impression about the company. The end should be such that the customer should be thanked and invited to call again for any help.  The ending can be like this :-  "Thank you for calling us. If you have problems please feel free to contact us".|`|857613b00f17e9b24da4c2f617b245d5aa	IMO when a customer rep ends the call by just saying "Bye" I get the impression that he/she is pissed off or has an attitude because they had to talk to me. It also make me think that helping me with my issue was a waste of their time. The same also applies for saying "Good Bye", but in this case it depends on the tone in the voice. (Smile when you say it, it will sound better to the customer believe it or not).  The best endings...  1) "Thank you for your business and have a nice day."  2) "Is there anything else I can help you with? (wait for customer response) & then use  1 above to end the call.  Where I work I'm an admin asst for a residential contractor. I always close client calls with  2 above.

Are you sure you aren't reading the fee they charge for the transfer? Most cards say that you can transfer a balence for a fee of .5% for each transaction up to $75 max.  Try Citi Bank or Chase credit if you are looking for a new card.  Most cards do however limit you to how much credit you have on your card.  Good Luck.
f9a39482114c5f9844fc5040ac337bd4aa	Accounting vs Bookkeeping      Bookkeeping  - is the tedious part of the financial affairs of a business. It involves the systematic recording of the amounts, dates and sources of each revenue and expense transaction. Bookkeeping is concerned with the systems that enable the financial information to be extracted in the transactions that generate revenue and incur expense in the business.     Accounting  - is the bigger picture. It is the system that keeps track of the data, including people, and records the transaction's history, as well as taking the information that is obtained through the bookkeeping process and using that information to analyse the results of the business.     Accounting is the system that provides the reports and information needed for management to make decisions as to the direction of the business, as well as issues such as taxation, Sales Tax etc.     Some say you should think of accounting as a giant sifter and of bookkeeping as the process of pouring the stuff into the sifter. Things get stirred around and you get the information from the sifter after it's been stirred, in order to run the business efficiently and profitably.     I don't really understand your 2nd qn but if you want examples of sources of income:   Sale of Goods e.g. retailers selling shoes, clothes, books, etc  Sale of Services e.g. performing accounting work, legal work, a bank making loans, financial institutions accepting deposits and paying interest, etc  Receipt of dividends from an investee  Rental income from renting out a property, etc

If you go to a dealership, they usually work off of "book-time." That means that every process has a time value assigned to it. Like if replacing a water pump has a time value of 1 hour and the labor rate is $60/hr, you pay parts cost plus $60. The mechanic increases his rate by how fast he performs the work. So if he changes it out in 30 minutes, its the same as the mechanic making 120/hr because essentially he could do 2 hours of book time in one hour of the day. In this scenario, the fee never changes for you. If I knew a little more about your situation I might could give a little more targeted answer. Good Luck!|`|AA10299265	No limit. That would interfere with free enterprise and healthy competition. You really wouldn't want to place limits on your safety would you? Just remember, you get what you pay for.

32d480916cc4b91b7d982ba35e734fe7aa	This is because managers want you at work when you are supposed to be there.  If you have a schedule of work hours - you are scheduled between those specific hours for a reason, so that they have coverage to conduct their business.  Being late & absent regularly does not put you in favor with your manager.  They are not looking to do you favors & help you out, let's just be realistic.  By them telling you that the hours can't be made up, they are sort of punishing you too.  I am sure you don't get paid for hours that you don't work so they aren't going to reward you for being late by allowing you to make up the time & money.

AA10464818	The first step is to decide what you want to do -- especially if you have no resources. Think first whether you want to start a beauty salon or you want a clothing store -- not both if you have no capital whatsoever.    It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.    Nonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.    Even if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.    I suggest you read the following books to get ideas of how to finance your business:    Financing Your Small Business  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1...

First Thing to do is gather as much research through networking as possible.  Find an owner of a beauty salon/clothing store that will agree to answer your questions that you have.      After you have talked to those in the industry you can now figure out what your going to sell.  Call suppliers and get as much info as possible on pricing etc...      As far as investors go, you will have to have a business plan to attract any investors to loaning you money or becoming a partner.  The more money your looking for the more work you will have to do convincing the potential investor of letting go of their wallets.  Grant Money is unlikely unless your a minority that qualifies via income levels.  If you know someone that owns real estate property ask them if they would be willing to mortgage that property as an investment in your firm.      Starting a new business is a major headache and ordeal, especially a retail business.  But if you love what you do then it is more than worth it.    Good Luck.

There is no way to completely answer your question here, but I would start with a spiral bound note book and start writing down the what , where, how, when, why, who about creating and starting your own business.    Determine the above and you have the makings of your new business, then start filling in the bits and pieces of knowledge you are missing.    3 key questions to ask    what do I need to know, to run my.........(you fill in the blanks) business.

Reading about business in the field of your business choice would be part of the overall building process.    One more piece of essential advice;    What ever business you want to be successfull in, it will never succeed, unitl and unless you become a master in the one area that most failing businesses fail at.    the area is business generation, or prospecting, you can be the best whatever, if you can not generate customers for your business, don't bother even starting with your business, in the initial stages of your business, you will have to spend as 70 to 80 % of your time  and resources on creating business and customers for your company. If you can't or won't do that, you will likely end up where most failing business end up, broke and deveated, and working for companies that are great at marketing and prospecting.    one of the books or tapes to read or listen to is Emyth by michael gerber, it is trule a great book to understand the difference between being an employee (even in your own company) and being a business owner.

When the appraiser does their research it will show that the property has been listed in the past 12 months. So by not letting your loan person know this upfront all you will do is slow down the process.     I just had this happen on a loan I was working on. The borrower neglected to tell me about the listing (and yes, I did ask) and the appraiser marked no on the past12 months listed section. On the last page of the apraisal (page 15) he noted that the property had been listed and an MLS  . I missed this as did the underwriter. Just before docs went out the appraisal review desk caght it and killed the loan. I sent it to another lender and funded a week later but it was a painful experience.    If you are doing a rate and term loan (swapping one loan for another) then you should be OK. If you are looking to take cash out then many lenders will want it off the market 6-12 months. However if you were listing for a job change that fell through or something like that some lenders will make an exception and still do a cash out loan.    You already have a valid reason for the refinance, getting out of an ARM which is in the adjustable phase. Also going to a new fixed rate will most likely save you a couple of hundred a month; also a benefit to the borrower.    If you would like to discuss your situation in detail, drop me a line.

What kind of cutbacks can you make? For example: I drink bottled water. Now at $1 a bottle on something that covers over 65% of our planet is not smart. So I bought one of those water filters that screw into your faucet. I have bottles that I refil over and over again. I take them to work. Do you have a lot of small appliances around that house that are always on? I cut my electronic bill almost in half by unplugging all the clock radios and night lights. I also bought some of those florescent bulbs that look a lot like a regular bulb. These things use 80% less electricity than regular bulbs. You would be surprised, but these small things add up. I know I was spending money on the water filter and energy efficient bulbs but these things will pay for themselves in a month providing they pertain to you. If you really need the money right away start cutting back on your food costs. Romain noodles cost a dime and they taste just as good as campbells chicken noodle that costs $130 a can. Ok no chicken in romain noodles, but you are probably just missing about 4 tiny pieces of chicken. Put a brick inside your toilet 'chamber'. You will use a little lesser water each time you flush..Before you know it you will be ahead. Wanna be creative? Find yourself leaving lights on? Buy a motion sensor switch, the lights will turn on when you enter the room and will turn off (by a set amount of time) when you leave the room. I have one, they cost $15 at HomeDepot. Need new windshield wipers for your car? Who says you have to buy 2? You only need the new one on the drivers side, leave the old wiper on the passenger side.  So remember you have to start thinking S-M-A-R-T! Yours truly seahorsehawrey.|`|sTSoNfWeaa	That's a great reason to save some money! I hope it motivates you to come up with new solutions and change your habits.     Consider taking on a "Christmas Job". A lot of retailers hire extra people to get them through the holiday season. You could save the extra income. Open your own bank account (if you don't have one) and have your employer deposit it directly into your account. That way your brother can't get at it.    I'm guessing you're young, perhaps under 21. Please excuse me if I'm wrong. But it sounds like you've started developing some not so good spending habits. This would be a great time to start developing new habits, simple habits that could change your life. I suggest you read the book, "The Automatic Millionaire" by David Bach. You can get it for $2-3 used on Amazon or Half.com. It describes a system that is VERY easy that will enable you to save more money than you ever thought possible. The sooner you start the better.

Google "cash back cards"  or go to bankrate.com   and click on credit cards  some of the discount brokers offer 2% back, but you have to open an investment account.    I take it the trick is since HSBC is closed on Sunday, no transactions can be posted.  Also, they probably go by the date they receive the posting.  Ex:  If you shop on Saturday - it will not post with them until Monday - therefore not a weekend charge.  /

For self publishing, it depend eds, which cat is your title. Trade books, Academic, General book.Fiction and non -fiction etc.  Is this your FIRST book?  I suggest you join an association in your location.( Booksellers/Publishers?/etc)  Start with a MAILER  The  promote the same with e-mailing. ( offer a pre publication offer of 10% discount)  Contact all the retailers in your area and request them a poster space. and then a display space.  Join a Book club- request them to Discuss about the book on a week end.  Send few FREE copies to News papers, Magazines who feature NEW book information.  Send mailers to all libraries via mailer.  Have enough budget for a "release" function in a good hall, invite about 500 persons, SELL the book at a discount!  However, if you are offering the book to any publishers they will assit you in promoting the same.  Now a days globally it is all author backed promotion.    All the best!

And you are disappointed that you haven't gotten a response back. You need to grow up and make a decision. You have already displayed to these people that you are not trustworthy. When you misrepresent yourself you are lying. Companies don't want employees who are not trustworthy, especially in this field. It isn't difficult to check to see if someone has a degree or in this case has a CPA. Accountants deal with confidential financial data of their clients. It is critical that those to whom they entrust their most confidential information to be beyond reproach. To be candid, I would not want someone in my company or do business with anyone who would behave as you have in this situation. It shows that you are not trustworthy. You cannot have an accountant that you cannot trust. You need to decide whether you proceed with honor or continue playing games and misrepresenting yourself.

Also because you sign up under someone they teach how to run it, because your success equals their own success.

f9a39482114c5f9844fc5040ac337bd4aa	Depends on whether you have dividends. There are four closing entries, which transfer all temporary account balances to the owner's capital account.     1. Close the income statement accounts with credit balances (normally revenue accounts) to a special temporary account named income summary.     2. Close the income statement accounts with debit balances (normally expense accounts) to the income summary account. After all revenue and expense accounts are closed, the income summary account's balance equals the company's net income or loss for the period.    3. Close income summary to the owner's capital account or, in corporations, to the retained earnings account. The purpose of the income summary account is simply to keep the permanent owner's capital or retained earnings account uncluttered.    4. Close the owner's drawing account to the owner's capital account. In corporations, this entry closes any dividend accounts to the retained earnings account.
lv3ksYRbaa	The quickest way to do this if you have MS Word is the following:    Open a blank word doc  From the menu select Table then Insert  Next in the popup window type 1 for number of columns, and 2 for number of rows.  Now in the first row you can create your poster, making sure not to add too much otherwise the second row will spill over onto a second page.  Now place your cursor at the left side of the doc and notice it changes from a flashing I bar to a right pointing arrow.   Move the arrow in line with the second still empty row and click on the right mouse button. This will display a shortcut menu, as well as highlighting the empty second row.  From the shortcut menu select text direction to display another popup window. From this window choose whichever you prefer from the bottom two pane samples for your text direction.  Then click in the empty second pane and start typing your phone number line after line in the text direction you choose.  If you notice that the row isn't high enough for your phone number, hover your mouse pointer over the bottom border of the pane in which you're typing your phone numbers.  Notice the pointer changes to a two-way arrow. Hold own the left mouse button on this border and drag it to the desired height so that your phone number fits perfectly.  This bottom pane is like any other part of your text doc so you can do whatever you want to format the text in the pane.    That's about it!    Peter - http://topic.on.ca|`|tR2MisFTaa	add a table at the bottom of your flyer and insert vertically your phone number in the cells, then cut along the cells to make it easy for folks to tear off your number    you might want to look at using openoffice which is a free msoffice clone and it should help you do the vertical text http://www.openoffice.org/    hope i explained it ok
tz6ksGFkaa	I was wondering the same thing.  The responders on here are talking about the stimulus checks but that is not the question.  The question is a TAX CREDIT.|`|G3P5htn7aa	If there is stimulus checks to be distributed for 2009 it has nothing to do with your 2008 taxes.  We are still awaiting congressional approval on a new stimulus package and if it should  pass I can assure you that they will not even begin working on them till after April 15th.|`|Id5HppZLaa	Usually the stimulus package is sent out if you filed a tax return. So as long as you have filed you current year tax return, you will get the Obama rebate if it gets passed in Congress. Atleast this was the case last year, you had to file a 2007 tax return to be eligible for the 2008 stimulus package.|`|6c70c2C0aa	If it passes, you will still receive it when it does; you don't have to wait for it to file.  They don't change the tax forms, the IRS uses the taxpayers' info that have filed taxes to issue the stimulus check.    If your taxes are ready to file, send them in.
EPc8Wvkpaa	I would call the credit card company using the number from the last bill/back of card.  Ask them why you are getting calls about owing money on the card.
dde8ee0158b3da0fb4d185658f2c094faa	Yes they do. I used to work with a guy that had to put band aids over his piercings and some tattoos on his wrists. They also prefer you to not have unnatural hair colors (blue, pink, etc.) either.|`|XE527cDpaa	Why can't you just take them off when you go to work?  Are they like fused to your skin or something?|`|NP6ES2GPaa	Non-Ear Facial? I'd say most likely.

People who do patient care of any sort must have a license or certification. There are positions, if available, in dietary and housekeeping and, in some hosptials, non licensed people can work as transporters but eventhere may require some training. Take care and good luck.
FoxZWUEmaa	I am wondering that same question myself because I have not received any additional mailing notifications as I did with the Tier 1 extension.  According to the State website, it will automatically kick in as long as you continue to call Marvin.    See this website:    http://www.michigan.gov/uia/0,1607,7-118...    See the last question - How do I apply for an unemployment extension?
kGJND4lYaa	No.    However you should be aware that you are, for income tax purposes, deemed to have sold and reacquired all your property (real estate, personal, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc...) at fair market value on the day you enter Canada. This will serve as the cost basis for any future capital gains tax.|`|EmgiGg17aa	No.    You pay tax on money you "earn" aka income: while in Canada.  That means, if the money goes into the bank into a savings account - you will pay tax on the interest it "earns", not on the principle amount.    It is assumed you paid tax on the principle amount in the country at their tax rate where it was earned.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	No, income from before you becoming a resident of Canada is no taxable in Canada.  So the savings would not be taxable, but any income (interest etc) from the money once you become a resident, will be.|`|5dXsErAaaa	this is a form to determine your residence status  http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it221r...    Once you have established your residency you are subject to tax on your world income. You must report on your income tax return  all income from anywhere in the world received on or after the date you establish residency. For the period before your residency you would be subject to tax as a nonresident any income that was from Canadian Employment, business or scholarships and bursaries. If the 100,000 was earned prior to your residency and earned in another country then it wouldn't be subject to tax. However any interest dividends or capital gains earned after your residency would be subject to taxation.|`|y7Mwptsraa	You won't pay income taxes on this. But you will have to pay sales taxes, depending on what you're buying with the money.     There is no tax specifically on money brought into the country. You do need to report the amounts though to the Canad Border Services Agency. the main reson for this is so that they can track illegal money laundering operations.|`|Jrju4LjUaa	I moved to Canada from the US. The money you had before you became a Canadian resident is not taxable.     That even includes that even you got your permanent resident card a while ago but have not established permanent residence (e.g. get your sin card, health card) until recently in Canada, you still do not need to pay tax until you established permanent residency. There is a concept called deemed resident of Canada for tax purposes.         http://www.canada-tax.com
UZHMxvHWaa	i definitely say no because it seems pointless to me when you look just fine the way you are.  Noses really aren't that big of a deal.  I think most people aren't going to even be looking at your nose, and the people who are aren't worth your time.  I think for the most part you need to learn to be fine with how your nose is because it truly fits your nice face.|`|6jXuUCdraa	uh are you seeing things? your nose is perfectly fine! just maybe not so much make up...|`|NiYoIPApaa	no way! ur nose is nice and if u get a jose job u will look very unnatural.. keep ur nose!!! :) its not ugly and looks perfect with ur face|`|3j1QX7xAaa	How are we supposed to know if you need a nose job without seeing your nose?|`|eb703aadb704cfb3fadbe2d92e116e28aa	Nothing is wrong with your nose.. why waste money and end up with an atrocity like Michael Jackson's?|`|Qemwpzwzaa	hunny you look fine as you are,the people around you ( family,friends) won't stop loving you whatever choice you make!
