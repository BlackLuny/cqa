20080330152959AASEFZv	Computers & Internet;Security	Windows Live OneCare about to run out- renew or use a diff. antivirus?	I have Windows Vista Business and I have used Windows Live OneCare for a year. It has worked fine, but now the subscription is running out. It will cost me $50 for another year, or should I use a totally different Antivirus, antispyware, and antimalware program? Are there cheaper alternatives that work better/faster/easier/use less resources? I have heard there are some free ones, but I am not sure about how quickly they update their databases, how well they work, and I don't trust trialware. Do any of you know of something that is not total nagware, works in the background with minimal system resources, has a better database that is updated faster, protects against all forms of malware (viruses, spyware, all of that), and is preferably cheaper, but better is what I'm looking for?      Please help. I download a lot so I really need something good that will protect me and my computer.

Having a large library and many, many individual tracks, I need *only* the Artist and Album information. The XML exported by iTunes, however, gives much more information than I can use. I have found some scripts via Google that may be able to do this, but the ones I found are compatible only with Mac OS X, and I am a Windows user. I have tried exporting as text, as well as itunesregistry.com and nuTsie, however these don't give me the information I need in a meaningful way.

I'm worried a standard graphics card will stop the RAM from being as effective. Can one substitute the other?       Many thanks

20080709094233AAM0fVj	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	I have a good wireless signal but it still has trouble connecting.?	Even when I have three or four bars for my wireless network my laptop has trouble connecting to it. I immediately get this screen (as if it didn't even try connecting):       http://img141.imageshack.us/img141/4900/...       It can take an hour of retrying to connect. Other times it would connect immediately. Once it does connect, the speed is almost as fast as a wired connection.      I have tried changing the signal channel, unplugging my wireless phones, and even switching from D-Link to Linksys.      One strange thing I've noticed is that if I attempt to connect to someone else's network and it fails, it sometimes connects to my network immediately (my laptop is configured to automatically connect to my network when it sees it).

I have a table that lists all of our Quotes and the corresponding Purchase Order # & Amount when we receive them.

I am trying to run a query that lists all Purchase Orders and how much was invoiced to each one.        I have managed to run a query that will list all the Purchase Orders and the amounts billed against them.  The problem I am having is getting the query to also list the Purchase Orders that have nothing billed against them.  For some reason it just removes those from the query.  I am using the PO # & PO Amount fields from the "Project" table and the Invoice Amounts from the "Billing" table.  Any ideas how to make this work?

20081114123214AAXFu71	Computers & Internet;Security	Does This Sound Like A Scam?	Well I'm buying a first car and i need to know if this is a scam or not.                           Hello and sorry for my delay,   I'm SGT Andrew Perry. This Camry is in perfect working condition. This vehicle engine runs very, very smooth. No electrical problems on this beauty. This detailed vehicle makes the exterior looks like it just came off the assembly line. The car has 76k miles. VIN Number: 4T1BE32K32U540203   CD Player Anti-Lock Brakes Driver Airbag Passenger Airbag   Side Airbags Air Conditioning Cruise Control Power Locks   Power Windows Power Seats   Here are the pics of the car:    http://s300.photobucket.com/albums/nn37/...       As I know that my current situation is pretty special I want the deal closed only through eBay's Buyer Protection Program in order for you to be 100% protected. You will make the payment to eBay and they will hold the money until you receive the car. ONLY AFTER you receive the car and you inspect it(for 10 days) eBay will release the payment to me; in this way we are both protected. Anyway i am sure that if you won`t be satisfied about the car i will surely find another buyer in your area and there will be no need for you to ship the car back. I am located in London, UK and I was sent here to improve the military relationships between USA and UK. One month ago my wife moved here with me and brought the car with her but now we have to sell it back in the United States because we can't register it here; it has US specs and everything, and registering it here in Europe will take for ever. My final price on it is $2,700. If you will take it for this price, I am willing to handle the shipping. It will be shipped from here by plane with US Air Military Cargo so it will not cost me anything. You will get it to the nearest airport in your area and then it will be trucked forward to your place. You will receive the car in about 3 days. Please get back to me asap if you decide to buy, and include in your e-mail your full name and address where you want it shipped so I can start the deal with eBay. You will receive all the transaction payment and shipping details from them.   Best Regards,   Andrew and Sarah Perry

You get it on-line. When you get the free version they don't ask for any credit card info, but cut you off at 10 hours and then offer to sell it to you.        I downloaded the free version and it was a pain in the butt, they dumped a few icons on my desktop and it kept trying to dial up, even when I didn't want it to.  So I got pissed and uninstalled it. However, I went into my Network Connections and re-entered my username and password, three months ago and have had unlimited trouble free internet ever since (once I uninstalled it all the pains in the icons were deleted, and I believe so was the mechinism that keeps track of your hours), My free unlimited internet is as good as any isp I've ever had. You just don't have a bill, customer service or e-mail, but you get your e-mail elsewhere, right? Is this wrong?

Stampo la prima foto che viene tutta a righe, leggo e dice di fare il controllo ugelli. Infatti lo faccio e dalla prova di stampa risultano non allineati (mi stampa 6 rettangoli di colore diverso che dovrebbero risultare ben definiti ma non lo sono) quindi dice di fare la pulitura testine. Faccio anche questa pulitura e dalla nuova stampa prova ugelli risultano ora tutti i colori perfetti tranne il magenta che è scomparso e mi stampa bianco. Infatti provo a stampare una foto e viene sul verde, insomma manca un colore. Che devo fare? E' un problema di cartuccia e se la cambio si risolve o è un problema di stampante?

20070915202204AAtWl8n	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Whevever I turn this computer off/put it in hibernate, then when I start it back up the internet does not work	I am in college using a computer in a dorm room on a network, and yesterday when I tried to use it the internet did not work. I renewed the IP address for the Local Area Network, but then I just kept getting a message that said "Acquiring Network Address", and the message just stayed there and the local area network never connected. After this I assigned a static IP to the local area network, and then I got a messge that said the local area network was connected, yet when I tried to use the internet it would still not work. So then I tried doing a system restore, and after that the automatic configuration settings had been restored (in place of the static IP) and it said the local area network was connected, so I thought the internet would work. But it did not. So then I just decided to wait until this morning and try. This morning the internet worked, but later I came back in here and it was not working; I was once again just getting a perpetual "Acquiring Network Address" message.

20090308011317AAd5Im8	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Why my computer is failing so badly.?	My computer keeps giving me blue screen errors. I have reformatted and tried 3 operating systems. First it would just crash or restart and show no operating system found, or no system disk found. Then it started to have memory dumps, screen freezes, threading crashes, and other errors. I used Memtest86 to test my system memory. All tests pass....unless I choose memory sizing bios-all instead of probe or bios-standard. If I choose bios all, it gives immediate error for low side memory for test 1. This is the address test own address. It fails. It changes slightly when I move the ram around. Mainly if 1 2g stick is in, it gives the same error and the bottom says memory module 0 :0 errors. If both are in, it says 0:0 and 1:3000 errors *(error number not exact)      sometimes the computer works fine, but by the end of the day it will crash. I am almost certain the problem is with the bios chip in that motherboard. Am  I right to assume this?       I know the question is a bit confusing. To summerize:      Computer keeps crashing, memtest86 used under option 3 memory sizing sub menu 3 bios-all, instant error on low side memory.

20090308012510AAHKSD9	Computers & Internet;Internet;Facebook	Facebook is so popular, but how do you hande when your adult friends' children want to add you?	For example, I am 41, and many of my friends have teenage children.  I love them to death, but they want to add me to their Facebook, and I think it is odd.  I did accept one of my friend's 14 year old's the other day, and then after I did it, I wanted to delete it b/c well, she is 14.  Not sure how to handle.  Also, how do you handle when people from deep, deep, deep in the past add you?  Sure, I know the "cold" answer, and that is to just not accept, but I had a guy from a company I worked @ just out of college who added me.  I actually liked him a lot, but I found it very odd that he would want to connect to me.        I think my confusion is this...  if FB is a social networking site, but I really need it to be tight b/c I am more "private"...  Not sure what what I'm trying to ask, but I need some pointers here on what some etiquette moves are.  Help!      I suppose my question is 2-fold:      1.  Is it ok to "not accept" someone and add a message that says something like, "I'm sorry, but I am keeping my FB page limited to people in my immediate social circle and family so let's "email or call each other" to stay in touch, but FB  is limited.      2.  or if I add someone can I limit what they see?

20090308014702AAnGCxs	Computers & Internet;Security	I Need Help - W32 and Trojans?	Yesterday i was on the internet, when my page redirected and suddenly said that my pc was infected with a trojan virus...   It then started scanning on that web page.    However i knew this was a trick, and that the virus was going onto my pc right at that time and that it wasn't scanning for it but putting it on my pc; i tried to close it and stop but it had already finished...   I don't know what to do, i have scanned using norton 360 but it keeps getting stuck on 'Security Risk: Proxy.DNS' and says that the scan has finished...   However when i do a comprehensive scan many other suspicious things are scanned which i think are viruses, worms and trojans. But Norton doesn't state that they are risks and won't detect them...   Here are some other things it scanned:   w32.stration.d@mm   w32.sality.u   Trojan.bookmarker   infostealer.bancoor   I really need help and advice, i don't know what to do (i don't want to loose my 1 year old fab pc) please reply everyone!
