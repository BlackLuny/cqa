If there's a chance you have depression you need to address that, or you'll never find your way to a positive mood.  Other than that...<br>  <br>  You probably have to ask yourself what it is you get from being negative.  Some people like to be negative because they think (wrongly) that being positive makes someone seem less intelligent.  Some like to be "good and negative" so that they won't feel stupid or taken aback if something goes wrong.  Some find that being negative gets someone else to keep trying to make them feel positive, and it kind of gets to be  "dance" that goes on in the relationship.<br>  <br>  Sometimes people think others need to know how bad things really are/were, and if they're with someone who isn't negative they feel they need to "enlighten" them by keeping it up and keeping it up, thinking that the other person is just too "out of it" to realize how bad things are.<br>  <br>  Again, ask what you gain by being negative, what your motives really are, and what it is about being positive that you may not find appealing or smart.|`|c08c39bb7a1743575c2599b32315016aaa	Try to have a more positive mindframe.

ParFJxnSaa	Regularly monitor your internal monologue (self talk): write down the negative ones: "I'm really ugly" and then the converse: "I'm fairly good looking", and next time you become aware that you are thinking the former, visualise, as vividly as possible, a big "STOP!!!" sign, and/or a stern faced person wagging a finger at you, and deliberately repeat 5 times, either aloud, in a big voice, if alone, or subvocally (to yourself, in your mind), the converse affirmation. Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Habits take about 30 - 40 repetitions to become established, with most people. Cease comparing yourself unfavorably with others, using the STOP sign: "I am a unique individual, with potential, and my own set of skills". Keep your head up, and look people in the eye, or on the bridge of their nose. See self esteem/confidence, in section 38, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> and consider volunteering, even from home, at first. It will also provide a solid basis in reality for the daily affirmations: "I am a good person, who is valued by my community, because I ..(insert activity here).."<br>  <br>  Section 47 also refers. On volunteering outside the home, you will come into contact with supportive people, and receive positive feedback for your efforts, which will be obviously appreciated: there are many options; one is sure to suit you. Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at ezy-build also refer. "Even though I sometimes have low self esteem/confidence, I deeply and completely accept myself", as you use the acupressure massage/tapping. Read: "Lift your mood now." by John D Preston, Psy.D. 2001, New Harbinger Publications, Inc., 5674 Shattuck Avenue, Oakland. CA 94609 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/</a> may be worth trying for this, (or other books on the subject, via the searchbar) as it has a good section on building self esteem, using a different approach. I have recently encountered another opinion, however, which is that, just as it is important to build a house on a solid foundation, so it is with self esteem. Learn to forgive yourself for your past mistakes, and failures, or inadequacies. <br>  What do you want to improve or change about the way you interact with others? Try to make only one change at a time. Always check you progress before making another change. Celebrate your journey, not your destination. Learn to always feel good about where you are now, and to exude self-confidence about anywhere you might find yourself tomorrow. <br>  <br>  Set clear goals for yourself before every interaction. Know what you want. Think about how the people you will be meeting can help you reach those goals. Then decide how to approach each person accordingly. Apply this regularly and you will notice a difference. Be proactive. Take the initiative. Be decisive. Let the other person know exactly how he or she can help you. Proactive people tend to be more successful in their career. Treat each person you meet as if she or he is truly important. (You'll be amazed how this works.) Give a firm handshake; look the other person straight in the eye. Practice both of these. Your handshake should be just right. Not too firm and not too loose. Train yourself to notice something you like or find attractive in the person. Listen! Listen! Listen! Teach yourself to develop good listening skills. Learn a way to remember the other person's name. If in doubt simply ask for the name again 2 or 3 sentences into the conversation. Here is an exercise that can help you. It is called "Act as if." When you are in a social situation, act as if you are confident, and outgoing. Talk more, smile at everyone, ask questions, speak in a normal or excited tone, not a meek tone. Watch some of your outgoing peers, and imitate the style of their social behavior.

8WPpcjhCaa	This is why they say 'opposites attract'.  When two people with the same characteristics are put together in one room, they clash.  This is why when you see weird looking couples together, you think to yourself wow they dont look like they have anything in common, and thats actually good because if they always thought about the same things, did same things, had mental capacities, their relationship wouldnt last.  You for example, have a confidence about you, and so does he.  You both probably want to be seen, known as the person who socializes, the talkative one;  Now, so does he.  There's no room for two winners, just one.  You can compare this to the olympics.  Everyone has the same goal and is going after the same thing, they have everything in common because their whole lives are based on just that one sport.  There can only be one winner, and the other ones get frustrated. <br>  Hope that helps you understand.  Same with picking a significant other...if you pick a woman that is just like you, she would want to be the head of the house and aggressive, and so do you, how will that work out?  It wont.  You need someone who's not like you and who can help you complement your characteristics. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

Aasan- <br>  There should be a lonely calm room with soft light and sufficient ventilation. Put a carpet on the earth with a pillow . Lay down flat on the back with legs and hands fully extended. Keep the body fully relaxed.  <br>  Step 2-   Prana Shodhan   <br>  Close the eyes and take 21 breaths. These breathes should be equally timed , full and not in hurry. This is Shodhan Breath.  <br>  Step 3 -  Kaya Shodhan    <br>  Concentrate your mind on the following parts of the body one by one , and take a shodhan breath.<br>  1 Head, 2 neck, 3 trunk, 4 abdomen, 5 Buttocks and pelvis 6 Left hand 7 Right hand 8 Left Leg and 9 Right leg.<br>  Feel that every inspired breath is filling energy in the organ you are concentrating on; and all the weakness , disease and other undesirable conditions are exhaled out  with expiration . This should be separately for every one of the above parts one by one. <br>   Step -4- Dhyaan<br>  Now imagine [1]a figure of your favorite "Devta" like Shri Hanuman ji, Shri Durga ji, Shri Shankar ji etc. or [2] photo of your mother , father ,teacher etc. [3] or any other photo, Idol or structure whose imagination gives you strength or [4] a big lump of light ; in front of you and you are continuously looking at it. It is becoming more and more clear in your vision with closed eyes.<br>  For example:-   I imagine that Iam looking at Durga Devi who is riding on a Lion. [described in  "RKSoniPrarthana.blogspot.com] She is smiling and looking at me and seemingly saying that "Don't worry, I am with you and will save you from all the evils , pains, enemies , and troubles" . And the vast aura around her is throwing energy into  me , which is making my mind and my body more and more strong. <br>  Step - 5 -  Shakti Sanchar<br>  Now feel by saying in your mind [unuttered] that " Now the cosmic energy has entered into my body and is active to solve my physical and mental problems. You may  feel  like a stream of warm water flowing all over your body. Now no disturbing element may enter into your mind keeping it superstrong. Now do "Jap" i.e. repeated uttering/saying of "Mantra" the name of God and prayer. Jap can be done either audible or inaudible ,at your own choice, like " Om Shri Durgaayai Namaha". You may remain in this state till you like. <br>     Step - 6 -  Kayabandhan<br>  Repeat these words in your mind " Now I have got myself free from the troubles which were disturbing me. I have become more strong, more happy and with more peace of mind. I have now become capable of facing the challenges of life and win. Now I am getting up with much more strength than earlier."  You can alter the words at your own choice but the sense should be on the same line. <br>  <br>  <br>    Step - 7 -  Charyadhaaran - <br>  Now get up slowly and have a good time.

First step is, take care of your health: do simple, but effective exercises, like walking, swimming etc., watch your diet! listen to music, do yoga and meditation, sleep well, relax well! then, make deliberate effort to memorise and reproduce what you think is important to you, and gradually learn to memorise, in your own innovative way, more and more: expand the storage capacity in your memory store, and practise retrieval and reproducing what you have memorised, in a systematic way! Nothing is impossible! the main thing is, you should take interest in all this, and be confident! Go ahead, start today, this moment: you may not need anyone's help!

AA11674745	I'm now 48 years old and remember being depressed at 17. I can also recall actually being tired of being depressed and exasperated at what seemed like having no options toward doing anything about it.<br>  <br>  You have to get yourself ready to talk to someone about it. There is no other way really. I don't know what your financial situation is like, but a licensed professional can help simply by listening to what you are feeling and by making suggestions to you.<br>  <br>  At the very least, you can call a hotline in the phonebook and talk anonymously at first until you get comfortable enough to sit down and speak to a professional face to face. I can't say for sure why you don't trust anyone with your feelings, but I was the same way. Now, I won't hold anything back because its good for me to get it out.<br>  <br>  As far as the feelings about how others may or may not feel about you, well, I've learned that the most important opinion in that regard is your own. If you appreciate yourself - and I get the feeling that you do - then others will appreciate you. And we really cannot tell how anyone feels about anyone else. And consider too that there are days when some people don't like the world only because they got out of bed in a grumpy mood.<br>  <br>  I used to obsess about what I thought was my reality until I began to talk about it with a professional counselor. It turned out that I thought I knew it all and gave life to what I assumed were the opinions of others. It wasn't until I realized that my opinion of myself was what mattered most that I began to heal and improve my outlook on life.<br>  <br>  Some will say to get a prescription and the pill will make you better. It ain't that simple. Taking medication is part of a program that involves the work that I just suggested. <br>  <br>  You are in control of your opinions and feelings, and despite how it may seem right now, you are doing the right thing by reaching out for help. That is usually a hurdle for folks and here you are with a leg up on that challenge.<br>  <br>  I dare you to try to get better by seeking professional help. Someone dared me and I am forever grateful that I took that first step.|`|sJRO9ulVaa	None of us on here are qualified to treat you, but finding someone such as a counselor to speak to about your thoughts.

In the meantime, ask yourself "Why am I feeling empty?". You will pull out of it though :)|`|ParFJxnSaa	Ask yourself: "Why do I feel depressed, and when did I first start to feel this way: can I associate this with any recent change in my life?"

Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment). <br>  <br>  It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor. <br>  <br>  (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, don’t follow the typical “normal” reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements. <br>  <br>  (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes minutes of exercise, daily, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.  (7.) As options, if desired, either a known, effective herbal remedy, such as St. John's wort, (get a German variety, if possible; local ones may vary in effectiveness. Perika, and Kira brands have been recommended as being effective. Take with a meal) or supplements, such as SAMe, or Inositol (from vitamin and health food stores, some supermarkets, or mail order: view section 55).|`|r8rykCkGaa	Hi!  This is Marcia.  I do care about you sincerely.  You can send me an email if you'd like.  I know it's hard to trust people cause they let you down.  I used to get very depressed also.  Doing okay now.  Life is not easy but doing better now than ever psychologically.<br>  <br>  Anyway---I don't know anything about you, like where you are, your family, background, religion, philiosophy or anything, but regardless----God loves you and has a purpose for your life.  We often get to the end of ourselves.  That's when we can turn it all over to Jesus Christ, and get saved, and start a whole new life over again.  So, please don't hurt yourself.  Pray and read the Bible if you can.  I would be glad to hear from you.  More later---if you send an email.<br>  <br>  (In California, near San Francisco)
ParFJxnSaa	Regularly monitor your internal monologue (self talk): write down the negative ones: "I'm really ugly" and then the converse: "I'm fairly good looking", and next time you become aware that you are thinking the former, visualise, as vividly as possible, a big "STOP!!!" sign, and/or a stern faced person wagging a finger at you, and deliberately repeat 5 times, either aloud, in a big voice, if alone, or subvocally (to yourself, in your mind), the converse affirmation. Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Habits take about 30 - 40 repetitions to become established, with most people. Cease comparing yourself unfavorably with others, using the STOP sign: "I am a unique individual, with potential, and my own set of skills". Keep your head up, and look people in the eye, or on the bridge of their nose. See self esteem/confidence, in section 38, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> and consider volunteering, even from home, at first. It will also provide a solid basis in reality for the daily affirmations: "I am a good person, who is valued by my community, because I ..(insert activity here).."<br>  <br>  Section 47 also refers. Motivation; see section 28. On volunteering outside the home, you will come into contact with supportive people, and receive positive feedback for your efforts, which will be obviously appreciated: there are many options; one is sure to suit you. Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at ezy-build also refer. "Even though I sometimes have low self esteem/confidence, I deeply and completely accept myself", as you use the acupressure massage/tapping. Read: "Lift your mood now." by John D Preston, Psy.D. 2001, New Harbinger Publications, Inc., 5674 Shattuck Avenue, Oakland. CA 94609 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/</a> may be worth trying for this, (or other books on the subject, via the searchbar) as it has a good section on building self esteem, using a different approach. I have recently encountered another opinion, however, which is that, just as it is important to build a house on a solid foundation, so it is with self esteem. Learn to forgive yourself for your past mistakes, and failures, or inadequacies. <br>  What do you want to improve or change about the way you interact with others? Try to make only one change at a time. Always check you progress before making another change. Celebrate your journey, not your destination. Learn to always feel good about where you are now, and to exude self-confidence about anywhere you might find yourself tomorrow. <br>  <br>  Set clear goals for yourself before every interaction. Know what you want. Think about how the people you will be meeting can help you reach those goals. Then decide how to approach each person accordingly. Apply this regularly and you will notice a difference. Be proactive. Take the initiative. Be decisive. Let the other person know exactly how he or she can help you. Proactive people tend to be more successful in their career. Treat each person you meet as if she or he is truly important. (You'll be amazed how this works.) Give a firm handshake; look the other person straight in the eye. Practice both of these. Your handshake should be just right. Not too firm and not too loose. Train yourself to notice something you like or find attractive in the person. Listen! Listen! Listen! Teach yourself to develop good listening skills. Learn a way to remember the other person's name. If in doubt simply ask for the name again 2 or 3 sentences into the conversation. Here is an exercise that can help you. It is called "Act as if." When you are in a social situation, act as if you are confident, and outgoing. Talk more, smile at everyone, ask questions, speak in a normal or excited tone, not a meek tone. Watch some of your outgoing peers, and imitate the style of their social behavior.|`|498jyrobaa	Faith on "Bhole Shankar" i.e. the God.

S6xvBsR6aa	I don't think we can talk about India as a whole, but certainly there are parts of India where tradition still sometimes trumps the law. That is, in parts of India, women may be punished according to tradition rather than law (for example an unfaithful wife or a sexually active single woman). These punishments are almost always illegal but laws change far more quickly than behavior.|`|AA12098193	Traditions are a two edged sword.<br>  They help provide a sense of community and belonging; they help avoid uncertainty of the future; they offer means of pride and accomplishment that are in the reach of those who choose tradition.<br>  But on the other hand, tradition has little room for dissidence. So those in control of tradition will fight to keep it. Tradition says how you gain access to power and what part of it is there for you and what part will never be yours. So older women have their share and will struggle to keep it when younger women challenge it, just as men have theirs and will fight back if women try to grab it.<br>  Tradition doesn't have all the answers because not all the questions were asked in ancient times. There are new problems that need new answers. There are questions that have changed over time so they also need new answers. There are some answers still alive to questions that no one asks about any more. So they need to be put aside so we can move on to the next question.
W1xs3vYBaa	Exercise your body because it will increase blood flow and oxygen to your brain, also stretch for the same reason. Eat right, if you don't have the right fuel your brain will have a harder time working. Learn how to breathe right, and make sure you don't stop doing so when you get stressed. <br>  <br>  Your environment has a huge influence on how well your mind works. You should fall between your IQ range but if you are feeling groggy you'll score on your lower end. To maximize your score take care of yourself: Get a massage if you feel stiff, or if you're having headaches. <br>  <br>  Also, read and do puzzles to work your brain. It won't increase your IQ but it will get your brain into the mode to take a test.|`|4861f9e17bcef08d8f5e36f917de504eaa	Just be normal!  have fun, enjoy yourself, the way you would on normal days/evenings!

Recent studies have found that adults actually do best with 7 hours, and that the health effects of too much sleep are much worse than the effects of too little sleep.

vMaG2Ba6aa	To try to manipulate some one is of the devil it is witchcraft.  You may try, but you will be digging a pit (love) and you will fall into it not the person you are trying to manipulate, you are human you cannot change anyone if they choose not to be changed, it is between the Triune God and who ever.  Just remember this honesty is always the best policy, it always was and shall always be, any thing less, is abuse to yourself, just tell the truth, because if you do not, it will hurt you more than the person you are trying to manipulate; and each life touches another, who knows the damage you may do?  Jesus Christ is the answer, you must accept Him as you Lord and Savior and everything else with pray and supplication shall be alright and you shall be on the right path.|`|OnK9r0NWaa	Did you ever read "Tom Sawyer" by Mark Twain? There is a part of the story in which Tom is assigned to whitewash a fence. It was boring work for a young man on his summer holiday. But instead of protest, Tom did the opposite. He flew into the work with enthusiasm, and to each friend he saw passing bye, he told them cheerily what fun he was having. Via this little bit of subterfuge that we often call "reverse psychology" Tom got his work done by others who paid him for the "pleasure".This part of the story is a great read, you might try it and see what take-away you get from it. Still, I have to confess that I wouldn't feel comfortable hoodwinking friends that way. I prefer the direct approach with some kind of incentive for the person you asking for their help. That way, you don't risk a friendship.|`|jxoizhuBaa	manipulation is a somewhat difficult art.  best thing to do is learn sales techniques, that is really all you are doing.  if you ask the right questions, you can lead people to the answers you want them to say.  think about it this way... the next person you see tell them to do this:  "say and spell silk three times in a row"  they should say silk s-i-l-k, silk s-i-l-k, etc.  then ask them what a cow drinks... remember the correct answer is water.  it works.  and it is all about presetting someones brain to answer how you want.|`|AA10023185	You kinda ignore a boy which makes him work harder to get your attention.<br>  <br>  But you can overdo it and boy will decide that you are indeed not interested, and you gotta be in "same league" with the boy or "less cool" than him, b/c he gotta think that you should be interested in him.<br>  <br>  And if you want to manipulate a boy into liking you, chances are he's already using the same trick on you.

sW1skHoiaa	sometimes people are  trying to make themselves sound smarter but sometimes people are really just plain smart. if your less intelligent than a person to begin with or have a smaller vocabulary then the words that the other person may use in everyday language may come across like they're trying to be arrogant. |`|4GCH1lTyaa	ummm...no...it makes you a stuck up snob|`|r5Mxre6Saa	Using big words does not mean a person is smart, dumb, insecure or otherwise.  It's not the use of big words, it's how the words are used that matters.  Your second question:  sociology is the study of human societies, and the behavior of individuals within the society.   psychology is the study of the human mind, mental state, characteristic temperaments and associated behavior of groups or individuals.  I believe your question would be a psychology question.|`|AA11373993	Using big words does not make you smarter. If anything, it makes it look like you are trying to hard. As for the category, It can probably go in both, or even languages.|`|Xm24FpSlaa	i have no idea... usually if i answer and i use a big word it's just because that word randomly comes to me and happens to work with what i'm saying.....|`|KUooyuUIaa	I think they've just become accustomed to using a plethora of words to more accurately convey their message.|`|YJcd8OAeaa	they are just born learning it like that... sometimes it annoys me though<br>  social one|`|Ya4pyGJTaa	Do big words make you smarter?  No.  How could they?<br>  <br>  What do big words add to a conversation?  Specialized language, such as big words or slang or professional talk like "legalese" can add clarity.  If you want to talk about birds, for example, then you use that general word.  If you want to talk about a specific bird, then you use that specific name.  <br>  <br>  It makes sense to be attentive to who you are trying to communicate with.  It helps to use the language that works effectively.  If a doctor talks with a child with limited education, the words used will be different than if the same topic is covered with another doctor.  <br>  <br>  Yes, some people try to impress others with big words.  Is it arrogance?  Sometimes.  Is it low self-esteem?  Sometimes.  It  seem kind of sad to me.<br>  <br>  The world seems a more interesting place as we learn more, including more than one language.  It is like adding hyperlinks.  The meanings get richer and deeper.  But that is just my opinion.<br>  |`|oKExTm8paa	I think you have this question in the right category.<br>  <br>  My opinion of people who constantly use big words is that they are<br>  showing off. I think it is excellent to built your vocabulary and use more complicated words now and then, but not all the time.<br>  <br>  I believe people who keep using big words are trying to prove to the world that they are intelligent. Since English is not your home language, you are not expected to have a big vocabulary unless you have been studying English for a long time.<br>  <br>  If you do hear an English word you don't know, look it up online or in a dictionary. Then write it down.That's a great way to build your vocabulary.|`|bbpS3n9Waa	I personally use large words for the sake of clarity, rhythm, or to avoid repeating myself. Occasionally I will utilize erudition  (that's a joke, by the way) when arguing with someone if they claim to be smarter than me.<br>  <br>  Sarah Elizabeth, never let people make you something you aren't. Display your intelligence the way others would flaunt jewelry! Don't perpetuate that antifeminist stereotype just because people expect it of you!

We all know they spend about an hour trying to type something profound or seemingly intelligent but you just know they are spending all that time looking through a thesaurus. |`|FQPaE5Giaa	indubitably|`|7f932490a85b0ba15fb134215617447baa	lol- depends on if the person uses the word in the correct context or not.|`|b8f44f2b14bf2a59a255086e94d551f8aa	Sometimes it can help to use big words that sound intelligent because it can make someone think you know what you are talking about.  Or it could just be the best word to get the point across.  If someone uses a lot of "intelligent" words you can pretty much assume they are trying to look smart.  Nobody, not even scientists, goes out of their way to use big words just to explain something unless they are trying to prove something.<br>  <br>  M L- stop correcting people's grammar if you can't take your own advice.  It would be "does using big words make you smarter?"  It is really annoying.|`|eqDaHFuIaa	using big words doesn't make you smarter, it extends the outer reaches of you brains dictionary, yes, but for all you know, those people could have just pulled up a online dictionary and said words they found.  ( note that i used some big words too, but am not a expert on this question, so big words don't help )|`|lCIoXVGraa	honestly, i have really no idea. <br>  <br>  i tend to use larger words online than i would in a casual conversation...<br>  psychology (from my experience) because i try to make people think i'm an idiot in person (people seem to be nicer to you when they think you're a dumb blonde), though online i try to end that persona... if that makes any sense at all.   |`|94LHMaWlaa	It is possible that by elongating their verbiage a writer may endeavour to embellish their meaning to something greater than the inherent meaning.<br>  <br>  Preposterous!|`|JDt7hoJzaa	"Using big words make you smarter?" ....um, no, but proper grammar and sentence construction is a good start.<br>  <br>  Your question should read, "Do using big words make you appear smarter?"
6GmtcZteaa	Ya. Just forget about it. Because you're not moving yourself forward thinking about them. Care more about the blieive in your own decisions and work to benefit your future.|`|3585617e66b6e408b3a748ee15238f75aa	You need to lighten up on yourself. Get it in you head, you will make some wrong decisions and take a few wrong turns in life but you will also learn from these situations. Believe me, you do get smarter as you go. Don't cut your throat every time you make a mistake or misjudgment, just move on from it as gained knowledge.|`|CoTzmtFfaa	There have been so many times in my life where I didn't think about what I was doing and looking back I wonder what might have happened if I hadn't made the choices I did. Some of the things I have done in my life I'm not terribly proud of but I wouldn't change anything I've ever done. It's what's made me who I am today. And I couldn't be happier, so don't stress to much about the little things in life everything happens for a reason, good and bad.|`|z329Vcofaa	I think that you can sorta tailor you're life to fit you, and get what jobs and other things you want with the right amount of hard work, and yes, alot of decisions have to be made, whether with your heart of with your head, but every decision made will get you somewhere, and all experience is good experience, because you will learn how to handle similar situations later in life.|`|ac79c1bc2006138a997b16c6ea9ba908aa	um not really i may worry and get scared or something but at the end  it's life ,'ll continue it no matter what .<br>  and for me b4 making decisions i do usually think and take more than a rueslt A-B-C......

ae35bd9cf31fef968c2f69200ac87ae0aa	All religions are full of hypocrites, fanatics and superstitious freaks.<br>  <br>  Christians believe that a man died and was raised from the dead by his father who lives above the sky but can't believe in aliens.<br>  <br>  Muslims believe that women must cover their heads in the company of strange men or they will dishonor themselves. Also, the mere suspicion of a woman meeting a man of an even slightly differing faith is sufficient to have her killed and drag her carcass through the street... but it's ok to rape them, cut their face off and burn the body.<br>  <br>  Catholics, who were around when the Jesus was sentenced, call themselves Christians, even though they were around before he was.<br>  <br>  The list goes on of the silliness.<br>  <br>  I heard a Christian school teacher say $400 a week was sufficient to fulfill her needs, while her pastor was driving around in his new Cadillac Escalade LE. They are brainwashed. I bet you anything he told her that she doesn't need a lot to serve the Lord.|`|13dd1300afaebe4b25cb9bccb97c988baa	Why are you judging everyone by one standard? Not everyone is that way....Didn't your mother ever tell you to not to judge a book by its cover????|`|93wJRGV0aa	The same people in Christianity who are fanatics and hypocrites would have the same personality if Christianity had never existed.  It's not the religion, it's the way some use it for a hiding place.<br>  <br>  People who need a hiding place will always find one sooner or later.|`|j4H4o6W4aa	That is just not true!!! In every religion you can find fanatics, that is inevitable...but don′t generalize is not fair, there are people like me, for instance, who believe in Jesus, in his message, in eternal life, and live my life trying to be a good person, to do, to say and give the best of me to the people...so please don′t express like that...be respectful!|`|df635a503c0e808ca4ad6366a16697f0aa	unfortunatly some are but it doesn't mean we all are. a few bad witnesses are not the telling truth of a life lived for Christ. the bottom line is when someone has expeienced life changing truths it's hard not to be fanatical and want to share but never cram it down someone's throat. what some may seem as hypocritical the person in question may just be struggling with issues and need support or forgiveness. judgement is not the path to choose.|`|m7IS8wvkaa	Haven't you seen the bumper stickers that say,"I'm not perfect, just saved?". What they are saying is, I am not perfect like god, but I am saved which makes me better than you, you are going to hell. Now I ask you, what kind of garbage is that? While I am certain that there are plenty of "christians" that are perfectly decent, nice, caring, and loving individuals, when they are in a group they develop a "mob mentality" as it relates to their god, much in the same way as Muslim fundies. The christians preach that it is not up to man to judge man yet when they approach you and discover you are not one of them, they pass the judgement that if you do not get saved you are a heathen and will go to hell. If that is not hypocritical and judgemental then I'll eat my shorts. christians are damning, overbearing, that love fingerpointing in the name of a god. I would like to think that there are many among us with a far superior sense of what is really going on. It sure doesn't make us better, just more aware and knowledgeable of the often fanatical beliefs and practices of organized religion.|`|vMaG2Ba6aa	In life my friend, one may believe someone or some people are a certain way, when actually it is because they are that way themselves.  Unless of course you are able to base your theory on facts, then one is able to say, you may be correct; be it Christians or non-Christians.|`|uWBVuQOzaa	There are two questions here?  For the sake of discussion lets ignore the validity of such a sweeping statement.<br>  <br>  I believe Christians are such "fanatics" due to the intensity of the experience of accepting Jesus into ones heart and believing in the salvation of the soul.<br>  <br>  Why Christians are seen as hypocrits is more complicated.  Within Christianity the concept of salvation through giving to those less fortunate is revered and yet is fraught with problems of judgement.  Christians can move around this trap by giving with permission and without judgment.  Giving is about human connection where judgment of relative circumstances is irrellivant.

Also, there was a McDonald's ad with a little boy who's feeling neglected because of his new little brother.

Without ignorance there would be no boundaries between religeons, and religeon is undeniably the cause of a lot of conflict in the world. Although I do think people have the right to disagree with me on that one. Assuming the elimination of ignorance blurs the boundaries between religeous opinion- Fear would soon be eliminated because there would be less, if any, conflict. Conflict being a primary cause of fear. However, I do think that some fear is necessary to keep society itself together.

1168bcccfff6f3a578ef3a0223e4cce5aa	Did he have reason to question your fidelity?<br>  I'm sorry it didn't work out but learn your lessons and move on! To be honest it sounds more to me like there was a break down in communication more than it all being his fault - you said why didn't he contact you? but the questionis easily reversed and it doesn't take much effort on your part to pick up a phone either! You two obviously had issues here, not least with trust, but rather than working through them together you both just closed lines of communication ('he can call me first; no, she can call me first').<br>  It sounds to me as though he's trying to forgive you for something you never did (the thing is it's real from his point of view, hence, legitimatised) and he just needed to close that part of his life. I doubt he'd have made the call if he thought you hadn't got a b/f and moved on, although if he did he's an a** clown.<br>  Sorry you got hurt.|`|PliIXKdIaa	I think it was him that had something to hide when you were together! the accuser is normally the one with something to hide, so accuses you so it doesn't look like it's him that f*cked up your relationship!!! you should thank him that you aren't together anymore, i know it's hard but you done it once, you can do it again so move on and forget about him. if need be change your number so he can't contact you again and make your heart brake all over again.|`|x5MYW2LPaa	He is sick and wisted wanting to play with your emotions like a toy.

ILeHr73Baa	feminists wont answer here|`|dXyR1R8Yaa	Yes it is unfair. However it does not prove sexism in the system. I am not saying it is not there, just that this case alone does not prove it. There may be other factors, for example need of money. If your ex's previous partner earns a lot then they may need less in child support. Plus if you did not use lawyers you may have got a worse deal than if you had. There are a number of reasons why the amount you pay is unfair so it is not necessarily sexism.  However I do agree, the chances are, her being a woman may have had some affect on the amount she paid. And obviously this is unfair, and I think something should be done to stop the legal system seeing men and women differently.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	Here in the UK you can cut your child support down quite a bit by having your child sleep over, living with a woman with children, having more children, not being honest about how much you earn, etc etc.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	"If it isn't a sexist policy within the C$A (ex support agency) - then what else may explain this massive discrepancy?" - Hmmm...your being a man/father, and therefore having to suck it up to all such discrepancies,  explains it ALL !

Thankfully, I've not had to experience this sort of nonsense in my life, but I can assure you that before getting married, I would sit down and have the most stringent prenup drafted by the best attorney I could get.  Then I would look at every possibility in terms of how I could get screwed and if it looked like I can still get scdrewed too many ways by the legal system, then I wouldn't get married.  As tragic as it sounds (and I never imagined I'd say this) I don't see how anyone can get married after all these tragic stories I've heard of.|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	Theres a reason why her ex got custody of her daughter, its because she was seen as possibly unfit, which means that if you had kids together you could have brought up the fact that she was not the custodial parent of her other child, and that would have worked out in your favor, but its evident you did not explore that avenue and are being screwed for not being present in court!|`|pzLDXL6gaa	There are lots of ways in which child support varies other than income. Have you tried using the child support calculator? I think it's different by each state in the US but you should be able to find one. It takes into account a few things other than income. Maybe that's the cause of the discrepancy?     Do you know for sure the income of the other guy? Maybe it's different to what you think or there are other factors e.g. somebody cohabiting, new baby, lying about income or doing under the table work...it's silly to hypothesise it's sexism when it's quite a complicated formula. Even if your daughter and the other guy's daughter are different ages, that could change it quite significantly. Or if the mother has the daughter to stay even 1-2 nights per week, that could reduce it dramatically. I only really know about the system here in Australia but the Australia child support calculator takes into account a whole bunch of things and it doesn't even mention the gender of the parties when you're filling it in, works the same both ways and with same-sex couples.     If you're really unhappy with this I suggest you speak to your lawyer or the CSA.    Harriet
DoooQw77aa	It's definitely sounding like there is something wrong with your father. I think it may be AsPD too because lighting cats' tails on fire and shooting them with BB guns at a young age (or any age) is cruelty to animals, which definitely is a criterion in the DSM-IV-TR of AsPD for people under age 15 years. It sounds like you have the criteria for age 15 years and the ones for after age 18 years so see if any of the other criteria fit. I know that fire-setting with the intention of destruction is one too and lighting cats' tails on fire may count as that too. Did he ever break into others' houses or cars when we was younger? Does engage in reckless behavior? Does he seem to lack concern for his and others' safety? Does he do legal or illegal drugs a lot? It is definitely abnormal behavior to be cruel to animals and it is definitely abnormal to believe that that is normal behavior. And yea it's definitely appropriate to call him out on that. It's possible that he is even potentially dangerous which I am only saying is possible because you refuse to see him which makes it sound like he isn't too pleasant to be around.  This is to "Rachael h": it is definitely NOT normal to shoot cats and NOT everybody does that. In fact most people including me would NEVER dream of harming an animal!!  And to whoever said it's not appropriate to diagnose family members, in some cases it is! And AsPD can be a serious problem as is expressed by the harming animals. It may not 'just' stay with harming animals ... it may continue (or may have already continued) to harming people.|`|mCbhjcLuaa	If you go to dinner where he is present as this is not the first instance then he obviously is very self destructive.

575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	I don't necessarily think it's true that as intelligence goes up, happiness goes down.  <br>  <br>  There were studies that followed gifted children from childhood through adulthood, and it was found that they were, on average, more well adjusted and satisfied with their lives than average people were.  <br>  <br>  It can depend on the type of intelligence a person has.  If a person is very intelligent in areas associated with understanding self and others, that person is usually "smart enough" to know how to process sadness and how to find some degree of happiness.<br>  <br>  Very intelligent people don't necessarily have the luxury of living in "ignorant bliss", but they can be very skilled at knowing how to process sadness and put things in perspective.  <br>  <br>  It has been found, too, that highly gifted people often have a strong sense of spirituality; and may feel they are on Earth for some "purpose".  They often have a sense of a higher calling.<br>  <br>  There are more people with low IQ's in prison than there are people with high ones.  Also, going through day-to-day life is just harder for a person who isn't very intelligent and has to struggle more. <br>  <br>  For all these reasons, I'd rather be smart and unhappy.  Again, if someone is smart they can usually figure out ways to be a little happier than they are.|`|acrnYYweaa	great observation. i think i fall under the intelligent and unhappy category, and i have to say id prefer it to being dumb and happy.|`|FBh4ag68aa	smart and unhappy.<br>  But either way your life can change and you can become happy or you can become sad.|`|vXkPUOWdaa	oooo bella is a cutie ^, what up girl|`|zZY3JX30aa	I happier being smarter.

7h5zhoJqaa	Funny, Bub, he's actually describing true free market capitalism.  As demand decreases, prices fall. As prices fall, costs must be cut in order to continue to provide goods and services and still maintain a profit.  And the number one cost of most goods and services is labor.  So as prices fall, the cost of labor should fall with them in equal proportion.  Companies usually resort to layoffs to solve this problem, though, not wage cuts.      It's a pretty Utopian view, though, to think that this would be implementable.  The fact is that we compete in a world economy where we hold the throne, and the other countries in the world would not follow suit.  We'd essentially work ourselves into third world status.  Additionally, greed is human nature.  Wanna see a revolt?  Start cutting everyone's wages across the board to run in line with deflation.  Very few people have a real understanding of economics, people would view it as theft, and the media would have a field day playing on this public perception.    The concept itself does occur isolated to industries.  As a high demand job market saturates and supply for a particular skill set increases, salaries grow more slowly, level off or begin to drop.  Mass wage cuts may also occur in certain hard-hit companies as demand and prices decrease for their products.  But I can't see it working across the entire population.      It's just the nature of capitalism.  If you've made the lucky decision of working in a market that isn't affected by the recession, you're in a position to get more for your money.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Are you from a communist country?  So anti American.|`|LIYSGdQraa	The idea of this stimulus is to reduce the unemployment rate or at least keep it steady around its current level. The more people who are working, the more money there is multiplying its way through the economy (as each person receives the money as payment, they pay someone else with it and so on). So in theory yes it could help jump start the economy if it is done properly (whether that is actually going to happen is another story).    I understand your point about the false growth, but there is no way we can just leave it solely up to the market to correct itself. It certainly would eventually reach a natural equilibrium, but no one knows exactly how long that could take, and our country would suffer horribly through the process (see: Great Depression), especially those who already are short on money.|`|kukhR1Gqaa	Your idea is, in my opinion, a very good one.  However, it has a couple flaws: the stimulus package and American materialism.  The stimulus package is going to 'help' those companies who were hit hardest in the recession that aren't already bankrupt or bought out.  It is most unfortunate that it was most likely those companies that helped get us into this mess.  Also, American materialism will always be present (it seems anyway) and will drive Americans to buy better and better things.  In order to pay for this they will increase the price of their services.  People who need those services now have to pay more and so have to charge more for their services, and etc.    I do agree that the reason we're in this mess is the stupidity of both people and banks in allowing loans to happen that in all actuality could never have been paid off.  Kind of like what happened in the roaring twenties that set up the Great Depression, but not as bad.  I believe people need to understand that, in the big picture, the economy will grow.  But, they also need to understand that it can't always keep going up and must go down at some point, but that it will soon enough pick up and be stronger than ever.

For the longest while, I wouldn't even talk to anyone that I knew even DID drugs (and I'm talking if they said they merely tried marijuana).  I was like this through high school. When I graduated, I matured a LOT and realize that it was pretty judgmental of me.  My best friend in the entire world has smoked weed but he doesn't do it all the time, in fact very rarely.  If I ever needed him, he would help me like a brother.<br>  <br>  I don't have tattoos because they are not my thing but I don't judge other people that have them. I wear 2 hoop earrings in one ear but I don't have any other piercings.  I don't judge other people that do.  <br>  <br>  I guess what Im trying to say is I suggest that you still keep to your high standards and morals. That will do you a lot of good in the long run.  But I think you need to look at people's actions and conduct in an overall fashion. After all, there are cops out there that are corrupt.

dmCyY2SKaa	You wouldn't let doctors put a cast on your leg unless they took an x-ray and showed you where you broke/fractured your bone.<br>  <br>  With your brain, a doctor can just say that you have a "chemical imbalance" when you feel stressed, tired or have anxiety and/or melancholy. Instead of having you try to go to the gym, go to a nutritionist, get better sleep, spend more time with your family, make time for a hobby, get a less stressful job, etc... all things which will help you, they give you medicine that chemically lobotomizes your brain. The healthcare and pharmaceutical industry makes so much money out of drugging people up and turning them into hypochondriacs. No low is too low for them, they even target children and adolescents. Look at the rate of Ritalin, antidepressants and antipsychotics prescribed to children. These medicines have even worse side affects on children and adolescents, yet doctors hardly consider the long-term affects when they prescribe these medications to children. It's all about greed, money...<br>  <br>  Also, there's this attitude in America that people always have to be happy and cheerful with a smile on their face. Life is not just about joy and happiness... sadness, frustration, pain and loss are also a part of life as much as joy, happiness and serenity. You can't always try to be happy, and it's not wrong to feel unhappy sometimes. You can't also try to be tranquil all the time, sometimes life is turbulent, the more you go against that the more turbulent things become. People who are obsessed with control are totally out of their element in my opinion. They're inevitably going to be dependent on some kind of chemical, to strive for control.<br>  <br>  Muriel Heslop-- no, I've seen doctors harm children with chemicals without even diagnosing them with any disorder. It's a money making business.<br>  <br>  Muriel Heslop-- several antidepressants and several antipsychotics, in between them many numerous chemicals in these medications.<br>  <br>  Children and adolescents have been known to commit suicide after being prescribed antidepressants. It sometimes triggers something in adolescent brains, which pushes young people over the edge. <br>  <br>  "  Two to 3 percent of children treated with antidepressants had suicidal thoughts or behavior as a result of the drugs, officials said yesterday based on the Food and Drug Administration's most comprehensive analysis of past clinical trials of the widely used drugs.<br>  <br>  In a sharp departure from a decade-old position, agency officials said the increase in suicidal tendencies was not a result of the children's underlying depression but was caused by the medications themselves. "<br>  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18791-2004Sep13.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/art...</a><br>  <br>  The increased suicide risk is also linked to young adults between the ages of 18-25. A lot of people think that antidepressants are "happy pills" and "magic pills" but they are not. They only treat the symptoms and not the disorder itself. And when they fix one symptom, they cause another symptom.<br>  <br>  Muriel Heslop-- don't make my blood boil. I have very real, very personal experience. What a vile thing to say.<br>  <br>  Muriel Heslop-- check your inbox.|`|cee27a373f64a299e31c2d3af3a93660aa	If you're anti-antidepressants, I don't want to hear it.

We are talking about major depressive disorder so crippling one can't get out of bed.  You want to sleep 24/hrs a day (hypersonmia).  Insomnia is another common symptom, as is waking up very early in the morning and not being able to get back to sleep.  The illness makes you so fatigued all the time, it renders you unable to concentrate, and the constant rumination, the neverending tape playing in your head won't stop.  Its CRIPPLING.<br>  <br>  Major Depressive Disorder is NOT "feeling sad" - it is qualitatively different and can rob a person of the will to live. It is a SERIOUS MEDICAL ILLNESS REQUIRING TREATMENT. <br>  TS NOT A CHARACTER FLAW, k?<br>  **************************************...<br>  @BW:  I see now.  You made it up.  You have no real knowlege on the subject but just felt like "throwing one out there" anyway.  Just because.<br>  **************************************...<br>  @BW:<br>  What "chemicals" are these you speak about, who prescribed them and under what circumstances?  I'll bet none of them were antidepressants bcause few psychiatrists would like to lose their livlihood for something so stupid.<br>  **************************************...<br>  @ Princess: me too.<br>  **************************************...<br>  @BW: antidepressants are rarely used in the treatment of depressive disorders in adolescents and children.  When they are used its under the watchful eye of a psychiatrist with the right background and experience.<br>  **************************************...<br>  Wow, that's a really way out source you've found yourself there.  Really really waaaaaaaaaay out there.<br>  <br>  1. All the evidence tells us for sure is that women tend to seek help more often than men.  It doesn't say that more women are clinically depressed than men, just that more women seek and receive treatment for unipolar depression..<br>  <br>  2. Millions of women were fed Valium by their male physicians from the 1950's - mid 1980's.  It would appear these "happy homemakers" were NOT. They were "running for the shelter of Mother's Little Helper...".<br>  <br>  3. You don't know the first thing about Prozac (or any other antidepressants).  Prozac is absolutely ancient and it's not very useful for major depressive disorder. Often, its prescribed "off label" for anxiety disorders, and it helps many people.<br>  <br>  Lithium is used in the treatment of bi-polar disorder and just as many women as men are diagnosed with this very serious mental disorder.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	I don't think it has anything to do with feminism.  Social views on depression have changed greatly in the last 20 years and hugely in the last 10 years.  It is now discussed, talked about and no longer hidden in shame but a real medical condition.<br>  <br>  I think the rates for men a similar however, men are not nearly as likely to seek treatment; they seem to prefer to be miserable, drink, abuse drugs and make their SO's miserable.  Men can't or won't be as honest with themselves and their doctor as women are.<br>  <br>  Everyone has such huge pressures on them today; and this economic crisis isn't helping either.  People are trying to juggle work, kids, extended family, worrying about money, you name it.  Our society has turned into a pressure cooker for many and depression is one of the ways that the pressure surfaces.<br>  <br>  Women in particular wear a lot of uniforms; Wife/girlfriend, daughter, friend, mother, worker and add those crazy hormones which are made worse by stress, no wonder!|`|sfn6SpbCaa	Changed my mind; pressures abound something is needed to take off the edge. Feminism in truth is only a word, words have no power, nor do they have any weakness; unless, we attritbute such to them. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium</a>  What you want to know about lithium is here.|`|x5MYW2LPaa	What on earth are you talking about? I don't think it's very good to joke about something like depression just to add to your little feminism hissy fit. <br>  <br>  Depresion is a seroious disease where the brain has a chemical imbalance and anti depressants do not lower the IQ or have the same effect as heroin.<br>  <br>  Depression also has nothing to do with being miserable. Unfortaiuntely I know only too well that depression is when you have a wonderful life, a loving husband, family who love you, it's a beautiful sunny day and you have no care in the world. Yet you feel agonizingly unhappy, the same feeling as if you had a loved one die with no explanation or reason. So for people like that anti depressants are a life saver.|`|W1xs3vYBaa	It's because anti-depressants are over prescribed, period. <br>  <br>  Both genders are on anti-depressants because our lifestyle has become much more competitive and fast paced, and most cannot handle it. <br>  <br>  It has nothing to do with a person being male or female, but everything to do with people wanting quick fixes from their doctor instead of trying to find balance in their lives. Trying to say that anti-depressants and the rate that they are prescribed is evidence against "feminism" is completely absurd. Your correlation is incorrect, your hypothesis is biased, and your sample is skewed (no age, and only women).<br>  <br>  Also, fluoride is added to most tap water. Is it worth the risk?<br>  <br>  I'm slightly allergic to fluoride so I filter the water, increases my likelihood for cavities though.|`|eBMKmgCjaa	Lithium is some heavy duty treatment for bipolar/manic depression.<br>  <br>  Proazac has a totally different action to heroin. <br>  <br>  The rates of depression are much higher in women than men. Feminists blame men (no surprise) but its more likely due to biological factors e.g. hormonal fluctuations. PMS is an extreme example of how hormonal fluctuations can effect mood.|`|qPlx1Ejhaa	Depression is a result of the completely unnatural, contrived and emasculated lives we live - working in dead-end jobs to make money for sh1t we don't need, just so we can keep up with the Jones'.

pYKRoKK6aa	good idea  however....  all the jobs at the currency exchange would be lost  also US has a lot of traditions and special things they do on our coins for special events and such like each coin has a state, or the election of Obama with his face on it. it would be hard to come by|`|Shp5riE6aa	One language, one people...sounds like Trotsky.  :(|`|NsFaPI9waa	In theory it seems a good idea, but in practice not so much. (a bit like communism)    Also don't ignore the fact many countries would be reluctant to take the idea on board. National currency, for lots of people is part of their culture and to change that would be to lose it.    As someone else pointed out goods do not have the same values across multiple countries. We would be using the same currency but for example a bike wouldn't cost the same in America as it would in China.    And that would also mean inevitably one country would have too much power which is never a good idea. People resent being ruled by other countries and not even to mention (but I will) the heavy complications with firstly changing the system and creating a new one.    In other words why fix a system that's not broken? (well not really)|`|vGCetYmAaa	that would be great!!  PROS  1. this would make traveling easier.  2.there wouldn't be problems with keeping the value of the money equal.

Good idea YES, right for this day and age NO.  i like the idea though. =]|`|kX1PolCUaa	I don't think it would work... different economic conditions in different countries would make international trading impossible.|`|zhk8o514aa	Everyone would be very confused.  Have you watched discovery?  There are even some tribes out there that still uses seashells as currency.|`|Xg8Tzjfraa	Well, according to Revelation, it's going to happen.  No one will be able to buy or sell without the mark of the Beast.    This mark will be on the hand or forehead.  And judging by recent news, this "mark" will be a microchip that is implanted below the skin.    So whether or not it's a good idea, it's going to happen.  And soon.    (And yes, I know mentioning anything Biblical will cause a lot of thumbs-down votes... it's amazing how intolerant liberals can be :)|`|6CAsx3jaaa	it works in europe because the countries are close in terms of economy but for poor countries it would be bad for everyone. too much chance for manipulation and problems would be global instead of with just one nation|`|r4FJjEGiaa	Very very very bad.|`|vmUgLSTBaa	I would say Yes, but it would not work|`|hFQa24wOaa	good idea!|`|9g2OAB8Maa	That would be awesome. But the economic system might get messed up..|`|nFJl0X56aa	Would have it's pros, but then again that's an end time prophecy some believe.|`|POJNnWhDaa	that would be great for countries with worthless currencies.. what a pay raise for them.    That would only work if all the countries of the world had equal economic strength.|`|SHsIybhhaa	Hmm, form the top of my head.  Pros: Maybe more international trade, more stability.  Cons: Erm, maybe it makes it easier for savers to switch banks when the interest rate falls, meaning there is a greater risk of there being a rush on banks.|`|jaw51Z5Waa	I think that it would be a great idea. Then you wouldn't have to keep going to the bank when you want to go on holiday. Also countries wouldn't argue over which currency they are. I don't think that there are really any cons.|`|wcDy86xuaa	That would be impossible, as goods do not have the same values across multiple countries.  Also, one currency doesn't take into account the different economies of the world.  It's a terrible idea, read an book on economics...|`|q6NGnYjJaa	That would mean there would be a one world government, and the bible states thats not good|`|qZPZ2bTpaa	I've always thought that that would be a good idea.  There is only one problem.  Some country's money is special.  It is considered "sacred".  So what currency would we use?  Other than that, it would be so much easier.  You don't have to convert currency every time you travel out of the country.  I have always thought the same thing about languages too.|`|YGODUqK2aa	it would be bad because money natually has different value in different parts of the world.  So, if we had the same currency everywhere, we would be affected instatly by another country's depreciation or inflation.    Besides: if we have exchange rates---that is a good thing, because you could exchange your monney for another currency and actually buy MORE in that country!    BUT: having 1 single currency just wouldnt be practical|`|1JY3GY41aa	in a perfect world, yes it would be fantastic.    But the reality of the situation is that all over the world money has different values. The value of money is based on the economic strength of the country. So for example, if the world had the same currency the "dollar" would be worth more in some countries than in others.|`|Xf354QDYaa	You know, that would actually be a great idea! Because, for example, let's say you go to Mexico, right? And you bring 200 US dollars. It sucks that you have to go through the process of paying for pesos instead. I mean, when you get back to America, your never gonna use the pesos again anyway!    So yeah! I think the world should have one currency.     It would be made out of the same material as a dollar bill, but will have a picture of the globe on it! One side of the dollar will show one side of the Earth, and the other another! It will be called.....globills! A mix of globe and bills.    GENIUS!!!!!|`|tMuUh6YGaa	That sounds like a good idea. The pros would be we can buy anything around the world. The cons are many people have to get used to it since our money is completely different, and trillions of dollars around the world are all worthless.|`|jiMAtaCraa	Stop spouting Pro-Globalism pseudophilosophies. One world government, one world currency, and one world military is a bad thing. It is reminiscent of totalitarianism.|`|GR8jsGgLaa	It would be a bad idea...   What's good for Zimbabwe might not be good for the United States. And who will over see the central bank? Officials from Zimbabwe or the US?  Forget it..  It'll never work.|`|uuekIkOzaa	Well if your spirtual the Bible says that one world currency is the sign of the beninning of the rapture. so just to be safe, Iam going to say stick with what we've got|`|Djde15A3aa	No|`|SqmWM4EKaa	I don't think so.  It would probobly take the world many years to adapt to a new policy.

They are rather blunt and I don't advise anyone to search for complex symbols for interpretation.<br>  <br>  I don't think any evolutionary significance has been given to dreams, but maybe it so that our brains benefit from having "entertainment" and visual stimuli during the sleep.|`|wTChVUilaa	in my opinion there is little. it can let you a little inside details on your psyche or even the deepest workings of your mind, the thoughts that you block out seem to thrive when there is no control of your thoughts. such as when you sleep. you can try to interpret them as much as something so supposedly spontaneous can be interpreted but, in my opinion its better to disregard them (though some may disagree)|`|Kn1xIPrzaa	Entertain you so you will keep sleeping so that your body can regenerate enough energy.<br>  <br>  Also I think dreams are messages of your subconcious.  It is your hopes, your dreams, your fears.

Everybody asks themselves the same old question and there's yet someone to come up with a clear-cut answer, eh!<br>  <br>  The beauty of being human, for better or for worse, is our ability to think and be conscious of ourselves and the world around us, which means that we are questioning creatures. <br>  <br>  In the end all one can do is try to answer those questions for themselves by figuring out what matters to them, following dreams they may have, finding contentment in what they believe in, etc.<br>  <br>  We're all different, and not so much at the same time, otherwise we wouldn't be all asking ourselves the same type of questions... the best thing that can happen to you might not be the best for me and so on-- it all depends on your own preferences and ideals in life.<br>  <br>  Of course there is a lot of boring day to day things that seem to repeat themselves forever (getting up, going to school/work, having kids...) but it's the detail in between that can make you feel that your life truly is unique or that you've made your existence count, I suppose.|`|wTChVUilaa	if there is one. it is beyond our understanding. we have to create our own meaning in this world, we have to make the best of it live it to our fullest. even if we die and that's it. it feels good to be alive and to live a fruitful and meaningful life (by fruitful i mean productive and positive by meaningful i mean whatever meaning we have found or created for our selves) if a person cant cope with a meaningless existence and doesn't believe it is meaningless i suggest to adopt a religious practice or faith

Since I do not understand anything about it, then I would just be silent about it, otherwise I could be misinterpreted as a bigot, or a racist.

Gen 3:19, Ecclesiastes 9:5 - 6, Ecclesiastes 3:19 - 20, Job 34:14 - 15, Psa 104:29, Ecclesiastes 12:6 - 7.<br>  <br>  After we die, and we are buried, we remain DEAD in our graves. It is only at the Second Coming of Christ Jesus that the righteous people shall be resurrected from their graves to go to Heaven. John 6:38 - 40, 1 Thessalonians 4:13 - 17, Acts 24:15, 1 Corinthians 15:51 - 53, Daniel 12:2, John 5:28 - 29. At that time, the evil will remain dead until a set time when they shall be raised to be condemned to Hell.<br>  <br>  Heaven exists. Hell exist as well. But right now God put Hell in reservation until the end of time. Hell is not in use yet, contrary to popular belief. Matthew 25:31 - 41, 2 Peter 3:7, Revelation 20:7 - 10.<br>  <br>  But that’s beside the point of your question.<br>  <br>  Now, back to your question. I could write a book upon your question, but for the sake of practicality, I’ll be as brief as possible.<br>  <br>  When you commit suicide you commit two primary sins.<br>  <br>  1.  Killing<br>  2.  Unbelief.<br>  <br>  Killing – because you “killed” yourself. Not being funny. Exodus 20:13, Matthew 5:21, Deuteronomy 5:17, James 2:11<br>  <br>  Unbelief – Because you BELIEVED that your problems CANNOT be solved, even by God. That is called doubt or unbelief. You are basically calling God a liar - which is a great sin. Psalms 78:21 - 22, Hebrews 3:18 - 19.<br>  <br>  God commanded us to put all our trust in Him, to cast all our cares upon Him, so that He can solve our problems for us, and take care of us. 1 Peter 5:6 - 7, Psalms 72:12, Psalms 91:14, Psalms 46:1<br>  <br>  He also promised that He would be with us until the end. Matthew 28:20, Deuteronomy 31:6, <br>  <br>  To disobey God's commands, and to doubt His promises is to sin against Him. If you kill yourself, you are actually saying what God promised is not true, and CANNOT happen in your life, thereby calling God a liar. People who call God a liar will not go to Heaven. Only people who believe that God exists, and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him, and wait upon Him will inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. Heb 11:6.<br>  <br>  I could give you literally hundreds of scripture texts to answer your question. Texts with instructions to trust God, and promises that He would deliver and protect us. They are spread all throughout the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation. It is basically what the whole Bible is about - a record of the promises of God, if you will.<br>  <br>  Do not kill yourself Dally C. When everything and everyone else has failed to help you, it is now time to test God, and see that He stands behind every promise that He has ever made. He is the only being in the universe who is faithful and trustworthy.<br>  <br>  "God is not a man, that He should lie, nor a son of man, that He should change His mind. Does He speak and then not act? Does He promise and not fulfill?" Nu 23:19<br>  <br>  It is when we run out of options that God’s options really begin to shine.<br>  <br>  “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness”, says the Lord Almighty. 2 Corinthians 12:9<br>  <br>  Take out your Bible and your song book and talk to God today. God is already waiting for you to come on a journey of discovery with Him. Do not delay.|`|AA10009451	my sister shot herself 21 years ago, At the time I thought she went to hell because she hadnt been able to ask for forgiveness, Since that time in my life I've been saved. So I've learned that when you ask the Lord to come into your heart and believe Christ died for our sins. Your sins are covered by his blood.  If that is'nt true then Christ would have died for no avail. He would have to die each time we sin. So you see once saved always saved. My sister was saved in her teens she was just sick|`|iPiqfm85aa	I think committing suicide is often a consequence of deep depression. Depending on what religion you believe in, some will say that taking your own life means that you're doomed to hell, or that you'll be stuck as a ghost without rest... For what it's worth nobody in the whole world knows the answer as to what happens after death, except that bodies decay and eventually become little else than dust.<br>  <br>  Personally, I truly believe that to actually get to the point of killing yourself shows that you are already in so much pain within that to think such a person would carry on suffering after death is just, well, awful.

If that means calling someone on the phone or taking a walk outside in the neighborhood, or sending a card to someone to cheer them, just DO IT!  Then enjoy your computer without guilt.  Sometimes it's just little things that make a difference.  Maybe you are supposed to be a reclusive writer, but you'll be exposed to a lot more material for your writing if you get out a little more.  Good luck!  If you are Asperger-like, make a chart to keep track of your progress.  At least you'll know you are making an effort..
AA10308205	First, I am not a a qualified psychologist. I have been in many situations, unexplainable reasons. I am not qualified to give such advise. <br>  <br>  Is it possible that the phychologist may have been, testing the child to observe what the child feels as being the real reason why the mother gave the child up? <br>  Phychologist are tricky people who judge people everyday. Sometimes the whole situation is not understood from both sides. I feel that being a parent is not a walk in the park. Sometimes being a parent is like being in a tough sport, not knowing the rules, the score or any of that. <br>  My eighteen year old likes to tell me to just get over it, it is in the past. It don't matter....<br>  I feel hurt terriable, emotionally inside. Certain experiances just scar for life.<br>  <br>  My father told me that I threw my children away. <br>  <br>  I just had a CPS worker call an inform me that my seventeen year old wasn't in school, yet it was the sameday that he had been suspended... So, I told her about the fact that he was in school. That I had contacted him after she had left a concerning message on the phone.<br>  <br>  My basic situation was that five years ago after having my third child my teenagers decided they were going to go see somebody with or without my permission. One of their girlfriends....well, I was upset because my teenagers were like so independant an blah blah blah. If I didn't know where they were then I was held responsible if something happened to either one of them. So calling proper authorities, they had found my children and CPS said that by my doing so represented terriable parenting skills and I was neglegent because I didn't go down the street with the baby {4 months old at the time} to find my teenagers.<br>  <br>  At first my children were placed in the home of one of the boys girlfriends' parents. Not saying that the girlfriends' parents were terriable just a big issue with better judgement in mind. <br>  <br>  My neglegent behavior along with abusive past lead to my teenagers being removed. The abuse has been un-substantuated in a court of law, yet I am still being held accountable for my actions/non-actions and here says.<br>  <br>  Psychologist, also like to observe the families reactions to certain situations. <br>  <br>  I once was told that the man that I had talked about in sessions.... was non-existant. I ended up marrying that man . We had went to an appointment together for a session and was told that I didn't have an appointment that it was for the next day.... I took my appointment paper out of my purse and asked for that appointment again an was told, opps sorry that the physicolologist didn't have my file ready on on the site an needed to obtain it before my appointment. My husband had took work off that day in order for my being able to attend that appointment. <br>  <br>  I have been told that it is no ones fault but our own for feeling the way that we do because we are in control of our own emotional state.<br>  <br>   A parenting teacher had told me that.|`|575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	I'm not a psychologist, and you may not want my input; but I can't help but wonder if the woman just said what she did to see what the boy would say, and see whether he'd defend his mother.<br>  <br>  Of course, there's the chance she's just a moron.  <br>  <br>  Either way, I think your daughter should politely contact her, ask her why on Earth she said such a thing, give her a chance to explain why, and then make it clear to her that she does care about her kids.  She doesn't need to sit back and let those words "fly".  She can address what was said, even if the woman is not allowed to respond (because of whatever the legal circumstances are surrounding the custody arrangement).  She could also write the woman a letter.<br>  <br>  It never hurts to file a complaint.  That would usually mean the woman would at least have to explain herself to someone.  <br>  <br>  When all is said and done, though, her son defended her.  He apparently knows she cares about him.   It may be hard to believe that the woman could actually think what she does (if she really thinks that and wasn't just trying to see what he'd do/say), but your daughter should not feel hurt by what some "moron-stranger" says, as long as she knows her son knows the truth.|`|LIUsQtLqaa	It is very wrong for her to have said his mother didn't care about him.

62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	Psychotherapy is a catch-all term that encompasses a wide variety of approaches to therapy. There are about as many approaches to therapy as there are therapists. Psychoanalysis is one such approach that usually involves a longer period of time with the therapist and is usually thought of when one thinks of "therapy" although it is nowhere near as common as it once was. Therapists commonly use behaviorist approaches, cognitive-behavioral therapy, etc. I urge you to talk with your intended therapist about his/her personal style to determine if it is one you feel you can work within. If not, look for a therapist who uses an approach that sounds more appealing to you. Good luck!|`|0lnamekJaa	It depends on the TYPE of therapy that your particular therapist believes in.<br>  <br>  There are MANY types...  <br>  “There are hundreds of psychotherapeutic approaches or schools of thought. By 1980 there were more than 250, [4]. By 1996 there were more than 450, [5]). The development of new and hybrid approaches continues around the wide variety of theoretical backgrounds. Many practitioners use several approaches in their work and alter their approach based on client need.”<br>  <br>  It also depends on what is wrong with YOU... One approach may work while ALL THE OTHERS seem like nonsense to you. <br>  <br>  Me? I have Borderline Personality Disorder... Which makes treatment in general VERY hard because my particular disorder makes trusting VERY hard and people with BLPD tend to feel that the therapist is "Stupid" and that we are not getting anything out of the therapy and that it is just nonsense. <br>  <br>  YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON FINDING A THERAPIST THAT YOU FIT WITH.<br>  <br>  You may need to see just 1 or you may have to see 100 until you find someone you can trust... Because TRUST is the most important part... You can't open up to someone you don't trust.<br>  <br>  You also need to think about if that persons methods work for you...<br>  <br>  I went to one guy that used Roll Playing... It was the most stupid thing I have ever enountered.<br>  <br>  I saw one chick that had a daughter that was living a lifestyle similar to my own and the therapist decided to put her feelings for her daughter on to ME... So she actually got ANGRY when I told her my story...<br>  <br>  I saw one chick that told me that if I purchased a $40.00 bottle of Noni Juice, ALL my problems would be cured! Everything from Depression to making my hair grow faster... SCAM.<br>  <br>  I saw one woman that, literally, looked my father and myself in the eye and said; "I am not qualified to help you" after hearing our full story...<br>  <br>  Also... Remember that a therapist can't perscribe medication. THEY ARE NOT DOCTORS. <br>  <br>  Therapists don't even need degrees if they phrase their add right... The term "Therapist" seems to be interchagable with Scam Artist, Life Coach, and Hug Therapist these days...<br>  <br>  Make sure the person you are seeing is an actual LICENSED AND REGULATED DOCTOR.<br>  <br>  ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychothera...</a><br>  Psychotherapy is an intentional interpersonal relationship used by trained psychotherapists to aid a client in problems of living. It aims to increase the individual's sense of well-being and reduce their subjective sense of discomfort. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, dialogue, communication and behavior change and that are designed to improve the mental health of a client or patient, or to improve group relationships (such as in a family). Psychotherapy may be performed by practitioners with a number of different qualifications, including psychologists, marriage and family therapists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, psychiatric nurses, and psychiatrists.<br>  <br>  Forms<br>  Most forms of psychotherapy use spoken conversation. Some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, artwork, drama, narrative story or music. Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained therapist and client(s). Purposeful, theoretically [based psychotherapy began in the 19th century with psychoanalysis;] since then, scores of other approaches have been developed and continue to be created.<br>  <br>  Therapy is generally employed in response to a variety of specific or non-specific manifestations of clinically diagnosable and/or existential crises. Treatment of everyday problems is more often referred to as counseling (a distinction originally adopted by Carl Rogers). However, the term counseling is sometimes used interchangeably with "psychotherapy".<br>  <br>  Whilst some psychotherapeutic interventions are designed to treat the patient employing the medical model, many psychotherapeutic approaches do not adhere to the symptom-based model of "illness/cure". Some practitioners, such as humanistic therapists, see themselves more in a facilitative/helper role. As sensitive and deeply personal topics are often discussed during psychotherapy, therapists are expected, and usually legally bound, to respect client or patient confidentiality. The critical importance of confidentiality is enshrined in the regulatory psychotherapeutic organizations' codes of ethical practice.<br>  <br>  Psychotherapy systems<br>  There are several main broad systems of psychotherapy:<br>  <br>  Psychoanalysis - the first practice to be called a psychotherapy. It encourages the verbalization of all the patient's thoughts, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst formulates the nature of the unconscious conflicts which are causing the patient's symptoms and character problems. <br>  Cognitive Behavioral - generally seeks by different methodologies to identify and transcend maladaptive cognitions, appraisal, beliefs and reactions with the aim of influencing destructive negative emotions and problematic dysfunctional behaviors. <br>  <br>  Psychodynamic - is a form of depth psychology, the primary focus of which is to reveal the unconscious content of a client's psyche in an effort to alleviate psychic tension. Although it has its roots in psychoanalysis, psychodynamic therapy tends to be briefer and less intensive than traditional psychoanalysis. <br>  Existential - is based on the existential belief that human beings are alone in the world. This aloneness leads to feelings of meaninglessness which can be overcome only by creating one's own values and meanings. <br>  <br>  Humanistic - emerged in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis and is therefore known as the Third Force in the development of psychology. It is explicitly concerned with the human context of the development of the individual with an emphasis on subjective meaning, a rejection of determinism, and a concern for positive growth rather than pathology. It posits an inherent human capacity to maximise potential, 'the self-actualing tendency'. The task of Humanistic therapy is to create a relational environment where this tendency might flourish. <br>  <br>  Brief therapy - is an umbrella term for a variety of approaches to psychotherapy. It differs from other schools of therapy in that it emphasizes (1) a focus on a specific problem and (2) direct intervention. It is solution-based rather than problem-oriented. It is less concerned with how a problem arose than with the current factors sustaining it and preventing change. <br>  <br>  Systemic Therapy - seeks to address people not at an individual level, as is often the focus of other forms of therapy, but as people in relationship, dealing with the interactions of groups, their patterns and dynamics (includes family therapy & marriage counseling). <br>  <br>  Transpersonal Therapy - Addresses the client in the context of a spiritual understanding of consciousness. <br>  <br>  Body Psychotherapy or Body-oriented Psychotherapy (also known as Somatic Psychology in USA & Australia) - addresses the whole of the person, including their body, manifestations of symptoms in the body of the client, body language, proprioception, emotional expression, proxemics, psychosomatics etc. <br>  <br>  There are hundreds of psychotherapeutic approaches or schools of thought. By 1980 there were more than 250, [4]. By 1996 there were more than 450, [5]). The development of new and hybrid approaches continues around the wide variety of theoretical backgrounds. Many practitioners use several approaches in their work and alter their approach based on client need.<br>  <br>  See the list of psychotherapies for an extended list of individual psychotherapies.|`|4676ab82fdec587e35a8084755696854aa	As has been mentioned, psychotherapy is a broad term encompassing many various techniques. More than likely however, therapy for you would involve talking about how you are feeling, and helping you to change your negative thinking. Maybe a lot of a mental effort would be required, but it's up to you to decide if it's worth it. A combination of a different antidepressant and therapy would probably be very beneficial to you.|`|zwJbUbWMaa	There will be a lot of talking about you and your feelings, goal setting and some homework assignments to get you more motivated.  You will discuss your current medications and they may refer you to someone to change your prescription but they themselves can't change the prescription for you unless they are collaborating with a psychiatrist or MD. They may ask you to participate in group therapy as well.|`|OKPFeBtYaa	try another antidepressant.  They all can react differently to different people.  <br>  Psychotherapy maybe a pain at first, but it's better than doing nothing.  It's not like depression cures itself.  It sounds like a pain because you are depressed and everything sounds like a pain.  But it will work out for you.|`|9EkFrApiaa	You are over analyzing psychotherapy but you have the right idea.  It includes talking A LOT and coming up with solutions.  I used to feel better right after leaving but as soon as I got in my car, I was thinking, nothing has changed-- this sucks.  So then I was referred to a psychiatrist who put me on meds for like two years and then in the end I decided, you know what, I am the one that needs to change.  Life is a choice and I choose happiness.  Depression and suicide runs rampant in my family-- every single one of my relatives is medicated but I chose otherwise.<br>  <br>  In the end, you just have to find out what is right for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|48E2rBsXaa	I'm sorry, I'm not sure of the answer.

You need to realize that each dollar spent on the Oscars is income for someone. This income will be spent in other things and in turn support the economy even more. Due to the multiplier effect, money spent through regular economic channels always translates into a higher GDP growth than money that is "donated" or used for transfers from one person to another without anything being produced or traded. Think about the party caterers, for example. All of those companies will get paid to cater the lavish parties, and they will in turn pay their cooks, waiters, food suppliers, truck drivers, etc. The cooks will use the money to pay rent, buy groceries, clothes, and medical care. The cooks' landlords, grocers, and doctors will in turn spend that money on things they need and the economy will continue to churn that money into production, income, and growth.<br>  <br>  If the Oscars were canceled and all of the money were donated to charity, do you really think the stimulus to the economy would be comparable?
BS2dgOIWaa	The longer a person holds a set of beliefs and leads a certain lifestyle, the more cognitive dissonance he/she will experience when they try to change these things. They begin to consider these ideas and lifestyle choices as a part of their identity and justify their actions through the prism of their personal beliefs. Take racism for example. It was much easier for an old white racist to continue believing that blacks are inferior, because this is what he/she had accepted to be true and it affected the choices they made during their life. The more internalized the belief is, the more difficult it would be for them to change it; mostly because it causes them to question their own decisions and behavior. This is an extreme example, but that is how it basically works with every situation.|`|46q6xyKmaa	Though I'm getting up in age, I still find I can be flexible if I detect something is easier, or change an opinion if it makes sense to me.  Good question...|`|APNB4OfIaa	My ways change very little, because, thru experience,  I know what works for me.  Opinions are not so fixed.  If & when I acquire new data/facts my opinions can & do change.  Flexibility can be an asset, but failure to stand your ground when challenged can be a detriment.  One must be able to determine what the situation calls for.  In that experience is the best teacher.

They may hate it, but after a few years in that career, that's what they're accustomed to and nothing typically happens that they can't expect. They might be afraid of a new career because there's no job security in it, or, they'll have to adapt their life to this new career. <br>  <br>  Sometimes change can make an adult feel like they're starting over in their independence and have to temporarily rely on someone else to help them through the process - this can be invalidating to some. <br>  <br>  However, if you're accepting of change now as a person nearing the end of your teens, it will make change easier for you as an adult. <br>  <br>  It's more of how you grew up and how you cope with life, not necessarily an "age" thing.|`|6K1D6Azmaa	I think it depends on the person, but it also depends on what you mean by changing your opinion. I think some people are closed minded their whole lives and never even consider changing their opinions on most things. <br>  <br>  But if you have put a lot of thought into your opinion on some topic, quite possibly it would not be reasonable to change your opinion lightly. ?|`|hPkWZh3xaa	I don't think it matters about age.  You can be set in your ways whatever age you are, and it is up to us to be more open minded and tolerant.  I think one thing that increases with age is realising why people act the way they do, and then you can sympathise with them even if you don't agree with their views.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	As long as you're honest with yourself, no, its not difficult to change your opinion if you see its flawed, no matter what ones age.
JeJCXexBaa	I can give you my answer, but each person is different.  I like a girl who is close with her family and stands up for her  values.  I think corny is very cute.  The insecure thing probably comes out by the fact she is so shy.  I can tell you this girl has some good features, we all do.  <br>  I would like her more after knowing more about her.  But tell your friend to gain her self confidence first.  If she is insecure others will pick up on it.|`|z7IYhVXzaa	Well, your friend sounds like me because I'm really shy. But regardless of her being shy or not, we've all got something to hide whether we're down-to-earth or outgoing or timid.

8d8ejHPfaa	Hi Kelly, I'm sorry to hear about your grandma.  It sounds like she has Alzheimer's or some other form of dementia.  I'm sure it has been tough to watch her personality get whittled away like that.  I feel that this long illness has given you an opportunity to come through some of the early stages of grief before your grandma passes on though, and you feel at peace and acceptance that soon she will be in a better place, and once free of the burdens of physical life her spirit may be restored to who she really is, and who you really know her to be. You sound ready to release her.  This is not to say that you won't grieve some when the moment actually comes, but you sound at peace with it.  In the garden is where you remember her best, and that is where she will be, in the Garden....In sympathy, beatlefan|`|kXhAERt3aa	Your mind is preparing you, actually, and was giving you a break at the same time.  You see - when we lose someone, whether they are lost to confusion or death first, we grieve while we learn to stop seeing only the loss.  You will need to remember your grandmother as she was before her illness - you need to hold onto the feelings of love and happiness, then it will be easier to think about her without regret or sadness.  You can start your journal now - make a journal about all the cool and fun things you remember about her.  All the sayings, the stories, the habits - whatever makes her uniquely her - because when she has left, those memories are what will keep her close to you and you do not want to lose a single positive memory about her.|`|LWLX1ha2aa	Either she's getting better or something bad.

auKBPfpDaa	Welcome to my world.  Some people are weird magnets...Not sure about things changing color and flavor, haven't had that happen to me, but the technology thing is not that unusual.  <br>  Buses die disproportionately when I'm on them, and start up just fine if I get off.  The DVD player practically has a seizure if I sit near it.  I put out street lights just by walking under them and I've had a light bulb light up in my hand.  <br>  You might be skeptical of this kind of thing, but it may be an indication that you have some kind of unusual abilities or sensitivities.  The drastic stuff like changing yogurt flavors to your favorite will probably fade by the time you get any decent control over it though.  People who are younger or developed it more recently tend to have the highest power levels, but the least control and precision.  <br>  Feel free to contact me if you have more questions about this.|`|yDW1paZyaa	you have a ghost crush,a Secret admirer from the other side, but in case bless the hose.O do not freak out.:-) :-[.|`|J9AvKefwaa	Coincidental.. you are adding two and two together and coming up with five!

PN7ELn3aaa	You would first need to obtain a bachelor's degree in anthropology. Anthropology is the broad "overhead" science that archaeology and paleontology are under. This is a four year degree. You will want to find a university that emphasizes the study of "physical anthropology" or if you are unable to then you should take more of the biology related anthro courses offered in your major. <br>  <br>  Next you will need to get your Master's Degree in a more specialized field of anthropology. Go again for physical anthro. oriented work. Osteology, Forensic Anthropology and Physical Anthro. are all good for this line of study.<br>  <br>  Then you will finally need to get your Doctorate in paleontology or archaeolgy. <br>  <br>  During your years in school try to get into as many core groups as you can and attend digs whenever possible. You can join in on digs as early as your first few years in college, but you will be doing gruntwork and learning the ropes. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|tpDICzslaa	In the UK, archaeology is not a part of anthropology, but a discipline in its own right. If you wanted to study a degree in archaeology you could do either a BA, which focuses more on the arts and humanities side of the subject, or a BSc, which focuses more on the scientific methods used. Either way the course would involve three years of study. There is also the option, at Bradford University, of doing a four year course comprising three years of study and one year getting practical experience on placement.<br>  <br>  However it is not essential to have a degree to get a job in archaeology, and a small minority of professionals have no formal qualifications. Most of these will have started off as volunteers, digging with local amateur groups or doing unpaid work experience, until they are skilled enough to make the transition to commercial work. If you try to follow this route the important thing is to get yourself known within your local area and make contacts who may be in a position to write references for you or offer you work.<br>  <br>  But be warned, archaeology is not a secure or well paid profession, and things are particularly bad at the moment because of the recession. For a gloomy but realistic view of the current situation, go to www.bajr.org and have a look at some of the recent threads on the forum.|`|uzfdgFSxaa	You will need to get a degree in one of those fields.  Jobs are not plentiful in those fields though.

To see the core of what's really going on.<br>  To get beyond the "white noise" of surface thoughts and ongoings and instead see, feel and hear what the true "message" of what's going on.<br>  It's almost like "x-ray vision" or "reading between the lines".

They do as much thinking as the next person and visa versa. (that is alot of thinking words) I have always heard the terminology that men are thinkers and women are feelers. I would suggest that this has turned completely around in this generation, and is not a bad thing by any means. If a person lives solely on the basis of feeling, there is going to be many mistakes made in the individuals life and would soon find out that we all need to be and do both. When all is said and done, I believe we are now living in an era where no one has to think much at all anymore, as most people have access to the information highway. Ask and receive in seconds!

Human history is full of anti-social bullying behaviour...that is why we have been at war every year in every decade of human history. Even in the "civilized" corporate boardrooms of wall street, banks have created fortunes based on anti-social and bullying behaviour. Even right now, wall street is trying to hurt the economy after being caught giving themselves bonuses out of bail out money...when the Obama plan was unveiled, wall street showed the disapproval by bailing out in almost every sector, to try to bully the little people into being fearful and lossing confidence in this great leader. Why, because he told them "For Shame".<br>  This has allowed goodness to enter, because the antisocial and bullying behaviour has created chaos and destruction. Out of the destruction comes rebuilding with wisdom. So it always returns to a good lasting trend.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	Its a sign of insecurity.

QRPvIB8Yaa	If oppression was a  small group with a rule of thumb over another it would never work. It has to gain legitimacy in order to work. This means that people have to see the it as being advantageoius and natural. All regimes use this tactic and those that find it hardest to justify themsleves dont last very long.<br>   This small precentage must have large sway. And in terms of patriarchy this group does. Most men and women believe in essentialist differences between men and women. And men who have historically controlled most of what is produced in society and the organs of government have had more power and more interest in holding the system together. So a man believes that the best route to success is to act manly do males jobs. Man are visibly more gender enforcing than women. This is best illustrated by their treatment and aversion to gay men. And even the fact that lesbianism in terms of legality has been totally overlooked.<br>   Women do enforce gender roles as well. Because they believe the house/public wold dichotomy is the best and accept the biologically natural arguments.<br>   Men after the industrial revolution had a lot to gain from women living in the home and feeding them for a day of work. This greatly benifited men and become the compromise between industries and workers on which the welfare sate and male breadwinner model was built.<br>   You are right to say people benifit from these efforts. It is in fact the coroporate world that benifits most from dual earner families and part time work and working poor women. The need to allow women to work full time in the labour force is a way which benifits all men and women by wiping this ineqaulity out and doing away with cheap labour. This way both men and women are at their happiest.<br>   Men and women are complicit in thinking this ideology is correct and defending it. Building there self esteem on it, only to have it threatened and defend it from attacks by men and women who wont just sit by and take it. This is why part time women workers and men are infact happy with this system, work within it and brush off alternatives. That is how oppression works it naturalises itself and builds itself on a system of comprimises.|`|XKk101Kqaa	"No wonder there is so much resentment and bad feelings towards men".... awww, is that what this is all about?!! =.(<br>  <br>  ..

The reason why i know that feminist are men haters because i did intense research don't get me wrong feminist was about equality up unto 1928. In 1960 feminist morph into a menhating movement the only good thing they did was raise awareness of rape and domestic violence that about it. you need to read lot of books base on law and history. In her groundbreaking book Christina Hoff Summers documents in painstaking detail how the media has become an echo chamber for distorted and false feminist "statistics" and how public policy has been shaped based on feminist distortions and lies.<br>  Im glad you ask this question because i post question that show evidenced that feminist are menhaters some coward feminist end up delateing my question.<br>  <br>  <br>  For example, a typical feminist will see no irony in arguing on one hand that women need ever greater protection from domestic violence, rape and sexual harassment (even if it means destroying the lives of innocent men) but on the other hand that women are just as good as men at fighting, construction, farming, police work, etc. <br>  <br>  In short, feminism is the politics of convenience. And if you don't think feminist leaders are misandrist, you are in denial. Here, in their own words, is how leading feminists see men:<br>  <br>  "All men are rapists and that's all they are."

YoY indicates year after year, currently rising 17.5% from 16.1%.<br>  <br>  The figures I would say offhandedly indicate a potential for inflation because of the high amount of cash being injected into the system.

Have you ever noticed that when someone makes a good point about the humanity of unborn babies, half of the women answering will ignore it altogether and bring up rape as the reason why abortion should be legal (even though most A's aren't done on rape victims)?

I know I would accompany my Dad to the neighborhood bar when I was younger and my Mom was doing something and didn't need me to be around her - I would drink my cherry cokes and play the jukebox and the bowling game.

You can get together in groups and quest or raid, having fun coordinating and working together. There is also player versus player game content if you decide you like that.

It either was something that washed out a pigment overlaying the fish or something more permanent.  Something more permanent would require a chemical reaction that changes color after being hydrated.  It could be done with some dies that are indicators.  The natural pH of the clay could be highly alkaline and when water is introduced the configuration of the molecules change.  Basically hydronium atoms interfere with the alternated pi bonds and the molecule of dye then absorbs in the visual spectrum.  I never heard of such a thing but it is very clever.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	I have some tea cups from Japan and saucers, very old.

rpajoT0raa	Can you love her as a friend? It sounds like she needs a friend. Maybe one day it will turn into something else but if you care about her so much then you can at least be there for her as a friend. My best friend is a man. I love him very much and we've been close friends for 15 years. We talk about our relationships with other people all the time and it is not uncomfortable in the least bit. After so much time that we've known each other platonically, we know we won't be together in "that way". And it is the most enduring, genuine and valuable type of friendship I could ever know. Perhaps she sees you as this type of friend... or perhaps she would just like you to stick around just in case you could be more than a friend one day. :-)

Sometimes also blue, which I love, but rarely. Just black or white. The problem is that I love colours and I don't know why I can't wear them.

Your dream lover is made up by your subconscious - usually using some semblance of someone you have met or seen, but constructed mostly to get you to think about breeding, just as the subconscious of other species does for them.  So your dream lover is all you could wish for in most ways - because that is what they are made from.  I finally put mine to work: he is a character in some of the stories I write.

Kind of is similar to what you wrote here that your friend said in that it makes little sense. He would mostly talk about the world and the people in it, and it was all so strange. Like you, I am at a loss of words when I listen to that tape. I don't know what to say about what your friend said. My advice is to have a professional analyze it, I am sure there are people and/or numbers you can call that will do this for free. I am not sure if you should trust what people say on here. I am not saying they don't have good input, it's just that in a serious situation like this it is not a good idea to just guess and have non-professionals giving you advice. Hope this helps.

Let's say the price of something falls. The static benefit is the money that is saved on each unit currently bought of that item. The dynamic benefit would take into account what might happen as a result of that price decline. Perhaps it is a component in another production process. Perhaps the lower price will attract new entrants to manufacture with that product.
LkuwuNOeaa	When people have good health, their happiness also increases.|`|iUzSlmSbaa	There is physical health and mental health both are important for happiness but even more so mental health, because if a person does not have mental health, depression and anxiety are the most frequent disorders of bad mental health which can even lead to thoughts of suicide, therefore health in general is important but even more than physical good health mental good health is important to live a happy life.. neither mental nor phyiscal health should ever be taken for granted but one should consider them as a precious gift and make the most of having them and value them.

Women can only advance in what Society we humans have created but in brute reality man will maintain his dominance just as a lion in his pride or a gorilla in his troop. I don't care what you call me, my idea aren't any more more right or wrong than yours. Don't let Society lead you to think too much on what is moral and what is not, that is insanity.

You're generally an Alpha-type, and find it very alluring and attractive to get outside of yourself and the responsibilities of being an Alpha. The problem is, the women who are attracted to you, are attracted *because* you exhibit an Alpha personality, and so are disappointed when you express your desire to submit to them. <br>  <br>  Solution: Find a woman who is unimpressed with your Alpha-ness, or better yet gets off on seeing you lick her boots after being"the man" all day... Such women do exist.|`|fW5qcU5uaa	Well, most ladies, I assume, would, if you asked them to spank you, or take part in other such...activities, ask if they could "buy some pot from you, man."

It would be selfish to expect them to take part in something they are uncomfortable with.

Frequently men who are in very high powered positions professionally (which I am sort of assuming from the 'alpha male' thing) need to be so very much in control for the majority of their lives, that they have a very real need to be dominated in the bedroom.  It's like their escape, their chance to let go of that control and just 'be' without having to make all the decisions.  They can let someone else have the reins for once.  Very. very typical.|`|AA10895669	Any good relationship plays along.<br>  <br>  It's the secret that is missing from those that only want for themselves.

2GNFQPdmaa	it's really hard to explain game theory overall in simple terms, but I'll try to explain one of the early concepts, the nash equilibrium, to you in simple terms.<br>  <br>  When you want to use game theory, you want to use it to predict how people will act. The first way you do this, usually, is by looking at a scenario with two "players." You give each of them two choices, and then you make a simple diagram that will help you predict what choice each player will make.<br>  <br>  Here is an example: Andy and Ben are both selling lemonade on the same street corner. Their choices are to sell lemonade for 1 dollar or 2 dollars. If they both sell for $1, they will share the profits and each make $10. If they both sell for $2, they will each make $16. If one of them sells for $1 and the other for $2, the person who sells for two gets nothing and the person who sells for one gets $20. We build a chart that looks like this:<br>  <br>  ---------------------Andy<br>  -----------------$1-----------$2<br>  <br>  ------------$1--10,10------0,20<br>  Ben<br>  ------------$2---20,0-------16,16<br>  <br>  This chart shows us the two players, the two choices, and the four possible outcomes.<br>  <br>  Game theory lets us look at this chart and predict what will happen, the outcome we predict is called the Nash Equilibrium.<br>  <br>  Here is what game theory predicts: No matter what Ben does, Andy will sell for $1. Because no matter what Ben does, if he changes from $2 to $1 he will make more money than if he didn't change.<br>  <br>  Ben makes the same decision, because no matter what Andy does, he can make more money if he switches from 2 to 1.<br>  <br>  This means that the Nash Equilibrium is that they will both sell for $1 and both make $10.<br>  <br>  And this is the first step towards learning about game theory. I hope it helps and was easy to follow.|`|4H4dUBkGaa	Game theory is about how people make decisions, knowing that other people’s decisions will have an impact on what happens in the end. It’s like chess: you have to anticipate how your opponent will react to your actions when you make a move. <br>  <br>  Here’s a more economic example: a firm knows that if it lowers its prices, it can steal a lot of customers from other firms. But other firms, having lost their customers, will be forced to lower their own prices so that their customers return. In the end, all the firms are worse off (since they have lower prices and the same amount of sales).|`|1V3IcvTmaa	Game theory is how people make decisions, or best response.  It finds the best response / best strategy for a situation.  The way that this was explained to me was with the prisoners dilemma.  Here is the prisoner's dilemma:<br>  <br>  You have brought in two suspects, but you have minimal evidence on them, so you need to get them to talk.  So, you bring them to separate rooms and present this to them with this table:<br>  <br>  ....................S1<br>  ..............Talk......Quiet<br>  ............x----------x---------x<br>  ....Talk..|..4,4....|..1,8....|<br>  S2........x----------x---------x<br>  ...Quiet.|..8,1....|..2,2....|<br>  ............x----------x---------x<br>  <br>  This table shows that if suspects 1 and 2 talk, they both get 4 years in prison.  If suspect 1 stays quiet and suspect 2 talks, suspect 1 gets 8 years in prison, and suspect 2 gets 1 year.  If suspect 1 talks and suspect 2 stays quiet, then suspect 2 gets 8 years in prison and suspect 1 gets 1 year.  If they both stay quiet, then they only get 2 years each.  Now, you might say, "Why don't they both stay quiet?  They'll only get 2 years each."  But, can they trust each other to stay quiet.  In this case, their best strategy would be to talk, because it is better for them to talk, just in case the other person talks.<br>  <br>  To learn more, go to:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gametheory.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.gametheory.net</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  'Til Next Time (TNT)<br>  <br>  Slok K

There are differences in the sizes and shapes of some structures within the male vs the female brain, especially in those structures designated for emotion and subjectivity.

Jhrkvhgtaa	This is a really interesting question and some of the things you hint at are a big problem in the west. <br>  I read a pretty good book recently that went very well into the issue that came up a few years ago about the cartoons of Mohamed. Some Danish newspapers published cartoons of him as a terrorist or something of that nature. The book explains very well that it is not only the islamists that are a danger to western freedom but also naivists. Naivists are people that don′t understand the threat that islamists are posing and want to give in to them constantly. I feel that a parallel can be drawn in many respects between feminists and islamists.<br>  <br>  The law you mention regarding prostitutes is a good example of how loosely connected to reality feminists are. <br>  <br>  I think the same applies here. Hardcore feminists are a real danger to society. Men are mostly responsible for the progress that have happened and when a society wants to oppress the force that has been driving it forward it is on a brink of suicide. Other nations are not behaving like this and as a result the West is being outperformed by other nations, mostly in Asia where people don′t care much for feminist mumbo jumbo. <br>  The basic error on behalf of feminists is the fact that the genders are not the same and more and more research is confirming this.<br>  <br>  What is needed is for men to stand up for their rights and not tolerate preferential treatment of half of society. Men should not vote for labor since it puts a sexist in the position of a minister. There should be big consequences for someone that attempts nonsense like what you are describing. We need swift reaction to ideas such as these, the eyes of more people need to be opened so that people understand how dangerous ideas like these are. Feminists need to be made to look reality in the eye, even if they don′t want to, and understand certain things like what you mentioned that most prostitutes aren′t forced into their profession. <br>  <br>  I would say that the blame mostly lies with the lawmakers, they need to seek out a balanced non-biased solution that is fair to everyone. <br>  I feel that feminism is big threat to society just like islamism and it needs to be countered harshly and right now.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	You can blame democracy, lawmakers get elected and as long as pandering to feminism gets them elected the laws keep coming.|`|QRPvIB8Yaa	Neither of these things are laws why are relying on something which hasnt happened yet! find some real laws and complain. The wage gap is perpetuated by women being socially defined as mothers and as most gender eqaulity units in governments will tell you "lack of labour market attactment". And we should all be against that for female workforce training, and childcare so fathers care for children more and indeed have a better chance in custody battles. A lot of women are sold into slavery in prostitution, while there are those who arent. That doesnt mean we shouldnt try and stop it and deny it because of a political aversion to the propenents of such things: feminists|`|9VAnsWYUaa	H. Harman isn't a man. Or am I mistaken ?|`|V1MptCMiaa	Those laws sound pretty stupid.  Why should a man who pays to have sex with a prostitute be charged with rape?  That is in no way rape.  But whoever passes the laws is to blame as are those who are just sitting by letting laws like that get passed.  You guys need to do something.|`|BkleL3F4aa	"hey lets fix inequality, discrimination and sexism with more inequality discrimination and sexism"<br>  <br>  said the feminists|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Whoever passes the laws are ultimately most responsible.<br>  <br>  There are radical nut-jobs all over the world, when those who make the laws start caving into them, we're all in trouble!|`|ndopqX6Taa	Aren't most lawmakers men?|`|vEj7xoBraa	women in general are to blame.

PtoieF7Caa	Alcohol effects the message relay to the brain, making it sluggish, there is a split second delay before the connection can be made between the brain and the impulse messages from sensory organs.<br>  By the time the message has been returned it's already been bombarded by a new impulse so the body has trouble in keeping up with returned messages. Think of it like a car braking, the car still travels even after you hit the brake, if the brain is hindered by alcohol then you could compare it to a car brake needing fine tuning, it will take longer to slow to a complete stop, by then you may have needed to swerve to avoid another obstacle, your first action wasn't fully accomplished before the second one was needed.<br>  This delay in senses means that the brain does not have time to fully process it's surroundings and a slight time delay between a movement and the point where the brain measures it results in the distortion of the senses (like the room spinning)<br>  <br>  There are two parts to this. As i'm sure you've been told, alcohol is a poison and the body knows it, as it has a stronger and stronger effect on the bloodstream and organs the body begins to suspect that there is something wrong, a foreign force is acting on the body, rather like a virus. The mind is fooled into believing that the person is sick and what does the mind do then? It tries to combat the problem by dispelling what it thinks is a foreign object (a virus)<br>  Don't you often feel nauseous when you are ill? The alcohol which is causing the problem is in your stomach, the body thinks that's where the virus is and it chooses the fastest way to try and get rid of it, by making you sick.<br>  It's not just the mind reacting to this foreign object, other organs are effected to, including the ears which contain fluid necessary for balance, if your vision isn't lining up exactly with your body position then the ears send a message ot the brain to tell it that something isn't quite right with the body and it's probably an illness.<br>  <br>  Ultimately it's the body's natural defense system being tricked into thinking that alcohol is a harmful intrusive virus or bacteria and it tries to get rid of it as quickly as possible, if that means making you want to vomit it out then so be it.<br>  <br>  Most of your questions were answered in there but those that weren't...<br>  <br>  It spins faster when you close your eyes because your other senses are still registering an imbalance, the fact that there is now a visual impairment means that they are uncoordinated.<br>  This is the same problem when you try to sleep, also factoring in that you have now decided to lie down and throw the fluid in your ears completely out of balance.<br>  <br>  The way to prevent it is to space out your drinks with plenty of water in between to dilute the alcohol. Also be sure to have eaten something plain which can help absorb the excess fluid in the stomach.<br>  <br>  Edit: The reason the room only spins one way is due to centrifugal force. Depending on whether you are in the northern or southern hemisphere will determine the play of gravity and which way the room spins (either clockwise or anti-clockwise)<br>  The room should spin the same way that your water flows down a drain.|`|BzUMSGgwaa	You are dizzy because of the alcahol!! It goes straight to your brain!! <br>  Just drink loads and loads of water x|`|QU37MZi7aa	it's not exactly the room is spinning. lol. rather it is your emotion that is drowning you from too much alcohol, and or, sometimes you feel worst with your health; and the like.<br>  you can only prevent this just not drinking, BUT do not drink too much. a glass or two will do and you can go home pretty good too.|`|7izZ17ncaa	drink 4 pints of water, i know its very hard, and you may live in the toilet lol.
uw2lRgmeaa	Why do you think they have more than you do girl. They hoard it. And they don't give out more than they absolutely have to. Try it.|`|HMFR1I01aa	in that way, then can save more money, that way they become more rich!<br>  they work hard to find the money..once they find the money, they would just wanna keep it because they know they work hard for it. (no pain, no gain)<br>  <br>  and not all rich people are cheap. <br>  <br>  they usually pass down the money to their children as well; plus once they make the money, they would wanna live in a luxurious life, and enjoy themselves.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	This is why they are rich. They watch their money carefully. However  I don't know any rich people who are like this myself. Sometimes people don't give much weekly, but when the chips are down it is then that they come to the rescue.|`|oojO4WAraa	That is how they got rich. <br>  <br>  Maybe they worked hard to get rich and figure others can get up off their butts and work to earn what they need also.|`|9UTAQs1Zaa	Most wealthy people give a large proportion of wealth to charity, take Bill Gates or Warren Buffet, The two most wealthiest men in the United States give millions of dalliers away in charitable donations. <br>  <br>  It all stems from Andrew Caragie and the "Gospel of Wealth"|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	Actually, that's not quite true.  While of course some are like this, many of them donate millions to charity over their life time.  They just don't make it public.<br>  Besides, its their money.  Shouldn't they be allowed to spend it any way they want to?|`|vqZD2TzLaa	Often such individuals do not wish to draw attention to themselves.  (A defense mechanism to keep would be opportunists at a distance.) It then becomes a habit and thereafter results in the stereotype that you describe.|`|qkCFLgaSaa	because who really wants to give away the money they earned... on payday do you tip $40 to be nice. or do you send half your check to charity? no! so why should they, people who get rich wanna stay rich and thats a reality....|`|AA11773731	Not all people with money horde it. Many do give a lot to charity. But you may as well ask why some people without money are so quick to spend it on stuff they don't need?|`|Wvj6o1XZaa	They're rich BECAUSE they're cheap.|`|nXSpS3Axaa	Percentage of you income doesn't mean anything.... its how much you donate..|`|Vp83Fuakaa	thats how they got rich|`|ruE1llE2aa	This is a terrible misrepresentation of wealthy people. <br>  Rich people are usually highly educated (thats how they became rich, they studied and worked hard FYI). They also have more manners and respect others. Perhaps it is not the rich people who are failing to give to your church, but the others. Did you ever think that the rich people could be giving in all the charity and the other people may not be giving anything? Not to mention studies show that a good percentile of wealthy upper middle class are conservative/religious, and that those people tend to give the MOST to charities. So I think you should look into to what exact type of people you are dealing with, before judging the entire mass of people with money. I can only imagine that people with a good amount of income, worked their whole lives for that. I simply cannot accept that all rich people are heartless snobs. I know I certainly am not. (Not trying to Boast...I was trying to stray as far away from myself as possible)|`|cvukfE8Gaa	Not everyone is the same, your are stereotyping and that is just wrong!|`|1itmn0NOaa	Only because they know the value of cheap.|`|88b49eb5687cafe6f199ac5ad53114bcaa	thats how they got rich in the first place, by not spending/wasting money.|`|KqWivPpAaa	how do you think they became rich? and not all rich people are cheap.|`|AA11506593	What gives you that idea? Why be so stereotypical?|`|0s190C7Zaa	How do you know they all act like this? Or that you are sterotyping the rich when you probably blame them for the economy the way it is. Well I wouldn't hold it against anyone if you did because for the most part it is true. What makes you rich is the ability to accumulate wealth and the connections to keep it safe, invest it, and have it grow.|`|1oj4aamaaa	How do you think they stay rich?
FBeK2c02aa	I was 16 when my father was killed, he moved away from us because he couldn't get along with my mother, so my mom kicked him out, he then had a girl friend were he lived her parents had a argue and the girl frined asked my dad to come over and stop her father from hurting her mother, my dad got to the front door, the man inside the house opened the door and shot him in the head, the man who killed my father got out of jail in three months, My father was a good man, he played video games with us, he spent time with us, and he made sure we were happy i miss him and i love him so much, when i first got the news of his death, it was a sunday morning, my mother came in our room and woke us up, and toldd us, i didn't cry at first because i didn't beleive it, i was hoping it was a bad dream, so i went back too sleep, when i woke up again hearing my brothers crying, i then broke down and cried, i wanted to get back at the man who took his life so bad.<br>  The place was oklahoma and my family was in texas at the time, but it takes time to get over a lost like that, i don't hurt any more about it, i look at it as im glade i got to be in his life and him in mine while it lasted, im proud to have known him and loved him. i get sad sometimes when i remember the old days, but it doesn't hold me back from living my life, stress and depresion hurts your body inside many different ways, it can destroy your diet, and can mess up the way of thoughts, but trust me you have to prey and ask god to get you through this time, take a deep breath let it out and know in your heart he's with you always, good luck|`|L9Cx70gtaa	I'm sorry for all your terrible losses people.

I wasexpecting this because his health continued to decline howver I am sad and  tend to write a lot ofpoetry about this. I know due to memories  here I want to move to start my life again and in the mean time I do spend as much time as I can hanging around friends and family. Loss of a loved one is devastating and can linger for a long time... you have to decide for yourself though.... are you thinking sadness all the time? are there good memories to try to think of? If you are in a state of sadness and grief constantly and find  it hard to do the things you use to like to do and also find it difficult to work or concentrate then i would suggest some grievance counseling to get over this hump since you did say it was several years ago. Please also try to spend time with a group of supporting friends and discover a new hobby that might get you inspired and restore a spark of  life into your being. <br>  I will NEVER forget my husband  and often cry and wonder what if ... but I know he would have wanted me to continue on with full force doing the things I need to do like working, painting, gardening and whatever it was  i did before and I believe you father would have wanted this for you as well.
VMIR9IoKaa	Dance <br>  To dream that you are dancing, signifies freedom from any constraints and restrictions. Your life is balanced and in harmony. Dancing also represents frivolity, happiness, gracefulness, sensuality and sexual desires. If you are dancing with a partner, then it signifies intimacy and a union of the masculine and feminine aspects of yourself. If you are leading, then it indicates that you are in control of your personal life. It could also mean that you are being overly aggressive and assertive.<br>  <br>  Singer <br>  To see a famous singer in your dream, represents harmony and some divine influence or vibrations. It indicates glorification of the human spirit. Consider also your general impression of this singer and how those specific qualities may be triggered by someone or some situation in your waking life.<br>  <br>  Cousins <br>  To see your cousin in your dream, represents something or some aspect of your character that is somewhat familiar. Perhaps you need to spend more time in cultivating and developing some emerging ability or character.<br>  <br>  Ghost (not that you necessarily saw them depicted as ghosts, but because both people have passed away)<br>  ...To see the ghost of a dead friend/relative in your dream, suggests guilt and regrets concerning the past relationships with that particular person.|`|GY97evsBaa	You will suddenlym start dancing with dead people in your dreams<br>  <br>  wait....<br>  <br>  ?
gYfvCkRPaa	Agactual,<br>  <br>  The market was slightly inflated, there were signs of that.<br>  <br>  However, the primary cause of the market dropping is a serious lack of confidence in policies.<br>  <br>  Our current president appears to be strongly anti business. His rhetoric of penalizing successful corporate chiefs, adding taxes to businesses, etc., removes confidence from the private sector.<br>  <br>  Thus, investors pull their investments. The markets tumble. People lose their jobs. People depending upon IRAs and 501 retirement plans suffer badly.<br>  <br>  What people who supported Obama failed to realize was that the US economy revolves around a free market, not around the government. {I say this as a military retiree - not a businessman].  When you heavily tax business, or force corporations to adapt to the federal goverment's way of doing things, the country suffers. Business' profits sink, thus they are forced to lay people off, close plants, investors pull their investments out, etc.<br>  If, on the other hand, American businesses raise prices, people buy foreign made products. (Look in your neighbors' driveways and see how many have Hondas or Toyotas).<br>  <br>  Plain and simple - Obama doesn't comprehend the economy, its problems, and what it will take to fix it. That is the unfortunate truth.<br>  <br>  Addendum: I am not a republican.

sX9Ilrpxaa	In the past, some anthropologists were very racist.  However, this a) must be viewed in the context of the larger problems of society and b) has largely ceased now because of later pioneering studies by anthropologists that disproved racist ideas.  The study of human remains is not dehumanizing now, we have ethical codes to insure that we treat human remains with respect.  See: <a href="http://www.physanth.org/positions/ethics.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.physanth.org/positions/ethics...</a><br>  <br>  The study is necessary because it helps us understand our past, our present, and our future.|`|cl4wdRnvaa	That's false, in fact if you read Spencer Wells book The Journey of Man: A Genetic Odyssey, you'll see that genetically all humans are related and come from East Africa.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	I believe you have a misunderstanding of the field.|`|BZMPax7Naa	what's dehumanizing about it?|`|8bbe5bcc7c0d988a341bc7f24981c504aa	as someone with a degree in anthropology i have no idea what you are talking about.
46q6xyKmaa	Most of the time people pick on those who are an 'easy' target.  If they see it bothers you, they'll do it more often.  You may need help to overcome these 'downers' in your life.  Don't be shy and go to the school counselor with your concerns, or pastor of a local church.  Also, a comforting adult like a grandparent or even a neighbor can give you some insight on how to deal with this.  The first thing to do though, is walk around with a smile on your face.  Do not act sad and gloomy all the time.  People want to be around those who are up and not down.  Make friends; you have to be one to get one.  Your brother has some issues himself it sounds like.  I imagine it is your dad being an alcoholic that triggers these things for you two. With negative people bothering me, I just put up a barrier and pretend they just don't exist.  I have dozens of nieces and nephews, and 2 children, so have seen this often.  Believe me, life can and will get better, but you have to work on it.  Please find someone to talk to..today.  Good luck!|`|pian616Daa	Sounds like you have got a lot going on, perhaps you need a break from that environment. Or you could change your outlook on life. Instead of taking offense when others bully, you could try the sarcastic approach, and ignore the comments and flip them back at the bullies. <br>  By standing up for yourself you will gain self confidence, and most importantly you'll gain respect from your peers. When people intimidate you, try to leave the situation or stand your ground, flip the question, make them look stupid infront of their friends. It may be tough but sometimes ignoring people is the only way to progress. <br>  If you are not fat, then don;t let the comments bother you, you could even jokingly call them 'slim' providing you don't cause a confrontation.<br>  With regards to your family issues, I hope that your father finds the help the needs, possibly through support groups.

w5uHiNcoaa	To talk about girly things/help each other fix thier make up - things like that.

I really cannot understand it, in all honesty.<br>  <br>  Mind you, I have often thought it may be better if I did always have another girl accompany me - just to keep me right, as it wouldn't be the first time I make the mistake of heading into the gents by accident!!|`|67204bd052a33365d7bd0f82da0dcc95aa	Been a while since I was near one, but don't men's urinals have a distinct communal aspect to them?<br>  You are asking a question casting aspersions on women going to the toilet together, sometimes we do, but actually take it in turns, because the queues may be too long, and because any venue is usually designed by a man, there will be two female toilets for 1000 women!!!

AA10687304	Doubtful, especially a person that you know.  Maybe if it were a random murder committed by someone whose fingerprints were not in any database or anything, it could be pulled off.  Maybe not, there is always someone around who sees something and it is the age of security cams.  All they have to do is run security cam footage on TV and someone is going to know who the person on the tape is.  Even if a random soccer mom decided to commit a murder, some clue would surface to get her caught, right down to a passerby with a cell phone camera who randomly photos her at the scene.  I saw one of those crazy crime videos where a student's dorm was ransacked and the student just happened to have left his web cam running and said person was busted in action.  *laugh             <br>  <br>  My father always said, "locks are devices for keeping honest people honest."

AA12329845	Sigmund Freud was born to Jewish parents in the heavily Roman Catholic town of Freiburg, Moravia. Throughout his life, Freud endeavored to understand religion and spirituality and wrote several books devoted to the subject, including Totem and Taboo (1913), The Future of an Illusion (1927), Civilization and Its Discontents (1930), and Moses and Monotheism (1938).<br>  <br>  Religion, Freud believed, was an expression of underlying psychological neuroses and distress. At various points in his writings, he suggested that religion was an attempt to control the Oedipal complex, a means of giving structure to social groups, wish fulfillment, an infantile delusion, and an attempt to control the outside world.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://psychology.about.com/od/sigmundfreud/p/freud_religion.htm" rel="nofollow">http://psychology.about.com/od/sigmundfr...</a>|`|qx4F2SJmaa	If you do a google search there are tons of articles on it...<br>  <br>  Bottom line he disliked organized religion very much, and found it to be a crutch for most people.

PtoieF7Caa	Stress and depression usually result in two behaviors. Either the offensive one where people are blunt and short in their answers, or the defensive where they withdraw and are abnormally quiet and distant.<br>  It varies but generally if there is any substantial change in a person's usual mood or behavior then there is something wrong.<br>  <br>  Honesty is quite easy to spot unless the person is a proficient liar. Body language gives it away. Often a liar will subconsciously try to hide the palm of their hands from any onlookers. Their posture might be tenser than usual or their voices might be off, but it's the eyes that almost always give it away, if a person lies they subconsciously start to blink far more frequently than usual, unless someone is well tuned to their body reactions they will not notice this behavior.|`|6GmtcZteaa	Looks away <br>  Bites fingernails.<br>  Scratching the back of the head.|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	Looking in the eyes and checking stories is not going to do much if the person is even a half-minded lier. They can look you directly in the eye and come up with a complete explanation and then make you out to be a insecure, mentally unstable jealous person. <br>  When someone is trying to cover up they leave a entire trail of mistakes yet they have an explanation for any that are detected. When cornered they attack. This is why you see cheating spouses always acting jealous and sometimes coming out and accusing the loyal spouse of having an affair. Usually when they leave the marriage it is not because they finally succumbed to one incredible gut wrenching love affair...it is after a few, they simply found someone that held out,  or they felt great lust and chased a person but were rejected so in rebound they find a new someone and transfered the feelings that are now intensified. <br>  If you feel that something is not right, you are responding to your senses picking up little unseen clues such as a voice pitch, a shallow breating, of holding breath, twitching, a gesture, a certain way of sitting, a slight word change or way of talking. All these are ever so slight, but an intuitive person picks it up and just knows. Trust this.

Cry me a feminist river, why don't you.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  Here is a good quote for your next question:<br>  "Women are not human beings - they are highly evolved portable sandwich making devices. This is absolutely true, not said in irony, and not taken out of context. I truly believe that if a woman fails the traditional right of passage (to be able to make a ham and cheese hero in under 40 seconds) she should be cast out from society and made to live in a women-only commune. I swear to you, this is my true belief. Honest. No kidding. Shut up I am trying to be serious now".|`|YQOT68xFaa	I can see his point, in a way - there are an awful lot of feminist women out there who have a problem with sexism towards men. You hear the remarks all the time - men aren't as smart, men aren't as moral, men can't handle pain as well, all men are potential rapists, etc etc. I wouldn't want them ruling either. Power corrupts, and since they're already sexist giving them power would make it a lot worse. Anyways, that poster isn't saying that women should only make sandwiches; he/she is saying that feminists' behaviour is undermining their claims that women want equality.|`|YwE5kIB8aa	Your a very angry individual aren't you?

You may want to consider anger-management so you can learn to control your anger, and then you may be taken more seriously.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	No worries; that's just his opinion, nor does anyone have to take verbatim.

In stead of attacking men for "oppressing" women, they should of been attacking women for being lazy and weak.

THEREFORE, their "low standing" in society is based on their own laziness and sloth.

But you know what, ignore the elephant in the room, keep on supporting your sisters (men are bastards, men are rapists) vocally and silently, carry on blaming men for everything, and you'll keep on getting the resistance you obviously want.  Go for it, keep on pretending that feminism has done and said nothing wrong, it's a perfect little ideology, whatever gets you to sleep at night.<br>  <br>  edit -this question reminds me of another question by that man-hater that's around here, demanding (like I owe her anything) example's of violent mass-murders by feminists towards men.

Get real.|`|eBMKmgCjaa	This is a pathetic question even by your standards Eleanor B.<br>  <br>  The quote you make is from my answer to the question of whether male rule looks like a good idea after 40 years of feminism. Here is my answer:<br>  <br>  "This really is a good point. The more I learn about what feminism is doing these days the more I sympathise with the idea of men being in charge. <br>  <br>  Seriously, if feminists represent women (and I don't think they do) then feminists are giving women a VERY bad name because feminists can't use logic or reason, feminists can't admit when they are wrong, feminists are more verbally aggressive than men or normal women, feminists use psychological tactics to win an argument far more than men or normal women...  So why would we ever let such people within a mile of any position of influence? <br>  <br>  Really, if feminism was trying to promote a good impression of women they best thing that feminist can do is just go see a psychiatrist who can help them deal with all those feelings of misery and alienation that they dump on men.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  Eleanor B: "What an incredibly misogynist remark. So if you think feminist laws unfair, that justifies men's ruling over women?"<br>  Oh the outrage! Oh woe is me, the shock!!<br>  <br>  Calm down dear. I think men and women are equal and don't see why women shouldn't rule. Or at least I didn't until I opened my eyes to what is happening with feminism i.e. if feminism is representing women - as it claims to be - it is totally undermining the notion that women should be put in charge of anything other than making sandwiches for men. If you have a problem with that I suggest you take it up with feminist bigots with positions of influence in government, the media, law, and academia".
rpajoT0raa	Anthropologists deny the existence of any such kind of oppressive matriarchal society in history. Matriarchal societies do still exist today - including the indigenous Mosuo of China - but they do not oppress men in the way that men have oppressed women in patriarchal society. They just have a different gender-role construct - no gender necessarily rules over the other - but in order to achieve this peaceful happy balance they have a family unit which is not confined to a marriage unit. The Mosuo people are against marriage and raise their children in sibling/family units that follow a maternal lineage. Respect for all human life is integral to their societal order.. <br>  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/rough/2005/07/introduction_to.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/rough/...</a><br>  <br>  By seeking to deny women of equal status and autonomy, and by dogmatically imposing the traditional Christian/Islamic/Whatever patriarchal family unit, do men just oppress humanity?

Mostly they were small(ish) tribes well back into history.   Many of those societies allowed women to marry multiple men, it was the women who owned property, men were generally seen as servants to women.   <br>  <br>  Ancient Greece itself was sort of a matriarchal society, although it doesn't exactly fit your bill because women didn't weren't allowed to own property, vote, etc.  HOWEVER the interesting thing about Ancient Greece is that the reason most women weren't allowed to own property, vote, fight, etc is because women were believed to be almost Goddess like in nature.  During ancient greek times it was believed that while engaging in sex with women, men could at the point of orgasm reach a state of near "nirvana" (to use a term stolen from another culture but the idea's the same).  And that they as men could only achieve that state of enlightenment with the help of women.  So women in their society were often worshipped (while simultaneously being treated badly) and therefore it was thought that they should be above meanial everyday grunge work type tasks like dealing with finances and fighting in wars.|`|NYU37jfGaa	No.  Men rule in all societies known in the past and the present.  However, in most societies most men did not have the right to vote either until comparatively recently, democracy is a fairly recent thing for most countries.
NcgBKvUCaa	At one point in my life, i thought that i was in love.  I thought that i had found the one... but then we broke up and i got together with someone else and i was having the same feelings that you were... i even had a dream very similar to yours.  Mine lasted for about three weeks and when i told my current boyfriend about it and he sat me down and told me that he loved me and that everything was going to be fine and he wasn't going anywhere... well the dream persisted for another three days and i was beginning to worry again, but it finally subsided and my dreams changed drastically... finally we were happy (my current boyfriend and i) So, I'm guessing that what you are going through is just a phase, keep your chin up and it will get better :)|`|WKtHucpcaa	It is hard to say why your having these dreams but whether you may admit to this or not.

IVGGvxVIaa	Nope. <br>  Humans and chimpanzees are of a different species.

Humans have one less chromosome than other primates so any inter-species reproduction is highly unlikely.<br>  <br>  However I would have to disagree with the comment from Fairy above. Different species have been known to inter-breed. For example, horses and donkeys are different species but they can inter-breed to create mules (which are usually infertile).|`|5oUyPxuuaa	no the 2% difference in our genes is what keeps humans from reproducing with other primates.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	No, we cannot.

Other hybrids have been observed and horses and donkeys have produced offspring. They are apparently more distantly related.

ASXeYOjAaa	Early 20th Century "Progressives*" implemented policies leading us here.<br>  Much of the "New Deal" was suspended for WWII so when the war ended, a recovery ensued.<br>  Since that time there has been on ongoing struggle where the left seeks to restore and exacerbate our economic demolition while the right resists. Contrary to popular "knowledge" there has never been a day of "Republican control" in our lifetimes. There HAVE been periods of Democrat control and a crashing economy has ALWAYS been the result.<br>  It isn't hard to see why. Anyone relying on "theory" in economics is a fool and/or a liar. REAL economics is nothing more than observable and therefore predictable reality. We already KNOW what effect any given proposal will have; it simply is not a debatable matter. 100% of the Democrat caucuses over our entire lifetime always DEMAND programs already known to do economic harm. Search as you might, you will not find even a single exception.<br>  <br>  Power is inextricably tied to this. People living in harsh deprivation tend to submit themselves to Dear Leader. An example (and none to the contrary exist) is how the economic collapse of the Wiemar Republic (aka the Democrats' operating manual) led to the rise of the "Third Reich. (aka the goal of the DNC)<br>  <br>  This cannot be credibly disputed. Obama himself outlined this on TV and radio. Do this simple "arithmetic."<br>  Obama said we are VERY close to a point of no return from which it will be impossible to avoid the worst economic depression the World has ever seen. + Obama guaranteed this WILL happen unless government spending is vastly reduced. + Obama demanded the largest spending INCREASE in all of human history, while admitting virtually NONE of it can possibly have a "stimulus" effect. = a binary choice: Obama and the entire Democrat caucus are profoundly retarded or they plan to CAUSE unprecedented economic deprivation. There is no 3rd alternative. 1 of those is guarangoddamnteed to be true.<br>  <br>  *Now known as "Liberals."|`|hpzfccwaaa	I would start at the conceptual moment of the "tricker down" theory.|`|XQvLV5imaa	I've heard many theories that the recession didn't start in the past year, nor the last decade, nor even the last 50 years.

The claim is, that the New Deal, while trying to end the Depression, only acted as a band-aid, because along with it came the end of the Gold Standard... and the beginning of Credit.  Yay!  Credit!!  Except that when you start a cycle of habitual debt... someday it catches up with you.<br>  <br>  That's right now.  The Credit finally ran out, and some are calling it the REAL end of the Great Depression.

BzUMSGgwaa	Oh Nooo!!! the EXACT same thing used to happen to me, and I ended up in hospital and I started to suffer from imnosa, you DEFINETLY need to go see a doctor. They may give you some nerve tablets and they will give you anti-biotics incase your glands swell up. I really hope you are not ill during your exam, because I know how it feels, but take my advice and go see a doctor. Try not to worry so much, just think-Its only exams, they dont mean everything, just try and be happy and confident. Good luck!!!!!<< I mean it!!! xxxxxxxxxx|`|J9AvKefwaa	Is the fear about failing the exam? <br>  I always find i enter exams with less stress if i know i have done as much as i can to give myself the best chance of success. Adequate revision etc. The best thing you can do is make yourself slow down and calm down. When you start the exam make sure you take a deep breath and stop to read the questions. Make sure you fully understand what is being asked. Don't rush in headlong in some panic about running out of time! You can spend the first 5 or 10 minutes planning your answer, use rough paper to jot down your thoughts. Its about approaching things in a logical, methodical, structured way. Stay calm, do the best you can and know what even if you did fail it really isn't the end of the world. There is always the change to do re-sits. In the grand scale of life just how vital and important is the exam?|`|AA11403032	Definitely go to a doctor.<br>  <br>  More people suffer from these anxiety attacks than you would ever imagine.  <br>  I bet you feel like you're the only one who suffers with this problem...you're not...lots of people do.<br>  <br>  Your doctor will definitely be able to help you.<br>  <br>  There's a tablet called Clomipramine (sometimes know by the brand-name Anafranil).  It's for treating depression, but a mild course of this is also brilliant for curing panic attacks like yours.<br>  <br>  After you've taken them for a while you will improve and you won't worry about suffering panic attacks, then you can reduce the dose slowly until you don't need them at all.<br>  <br>  Hypnotherapy is also something you could consider, but I'd definitely get to the doctor straightaway.  No need to suffer panic attacks when they can be controlled.|`|pian616Daa	Relax. This is probably just nerves. I suggest that before you go into the exam room you take a few minutes to breath and reassure yourself that you're ready for the test, and that whatever happens, you'll do your best. Its best to go in with a clear head. Allow yourself to be completely submerged into the role, if you are performing, then you'll stay focused.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	The anticipation of the event, for you, is worse than the event itself.  I just don't think about it until its time.

Big deal.|`|OmDPJvo9aa	As long as you have done all that you can to prepare for the exam, relax. Make sure you know enough to pass and just chill, let the test happen and see how you do. No more, no less.|`|RQOXc7Skaa	OK #1, It sounds like you are getting panic attacks.  Close your eyes, Take very deep breaths through your nostrils, hold then release with a gush of air from your mouth while letting your body totally relax with the exhale. Feel your arms go limp, your chest fall etc.  Do this about 5-10 times.  Believe me if you do it right it will help<br>  <br>  #2. Buy a very mellow music tape or a sound machine and lye down and listen to waves of the ocean, babbling brook or whatever is soothing to you..  While lying down totally concentrate on relaxing starting with your feet. Let them just go limp. This takes deep concentration.  Then move up to you legs, stomach and back, arms, chin, face, & finally head all one a time.  This may take practice. <br>  <br>  #3 At night when trying to go to sleep, use the same music as before but preferably with earphones.  Put a warm cloth on your eyes, and concentrate only on the sounds coming into your ears.  Don't think about anything but what you are hearing.  Soon you will be asleep. PS....When trying the music thing ....do not use music with words.  This will not work.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.

NYU37jfGaa	A bit of both.  Women could be put on pedestals, and they could also be oppressed.  For much of history, most women worked just as hard as men, and their economic contribution to the family was valuable, but they were considered to be under the authority of their husbands, and any property they owned before marriage automatically passed into the control of their husbands when they married.  And women who worked at jobs which paid wages were generally paid a lot less than men.<br>  <br>  And while men might put some women on pedestals, they wouldn't have any qualms about treating other women less well.  A Southern gentleman in pre-Civil War days for example might put white upper class women on a pedestal, but he wouldn't have any qualms about making black women labour in the fields, using them sexually if he felt like it etc.  And there were poor white women who wouldn't be treated much better.  Which women were put on pedestals and which weren't was a bit selective.|`|PILm2U4Taa	"Seems to me that back in the day, women were carried over puddles, shielded from extreme weather, and placed on a pedestal."<br>  <br>  The only women who received the full chivalry treatment were the upper-class, wives & daughters of royalty or the wealthy: "Ladies" as opposed to "women". Average women could be beaten mercilessly, had no rights, and were placed far from any pedestals...|`|XeH5FPM5aa	Keep in mind that only women of at least average beauty were treated well. Early feminism was a movement to give ugly broads a chance.|`|QRPvIB8Yaa	Yes im sure women hark back to the days where they it was legal to rape and beat them. When they were told they were too stupid to work outside the home. In a world were they were portrayed as the evil seducers of men and indeed were always asking for it.Because you know some middle class me used to put therr coats in puddles for middle class women, ah thats all settled now sure. Its ok, at least their feet wont get wet and people wont say bad words to them. Oh and the state does this and doesnt do the other things as well? sure thats even better!<br>  <br>  edit<br>  <br>   Sorry no thats a lie it was legal under anglosaxon common law. I know because these laws were only repealed in my country in 1990. They were inherited from victorian times All that happens in modernity is that rape is recorded and recognised. And have you heard of "rule of thumb" this meant it was legal to beat women in european countries as well. I dont have a roman fetish.|`|rpajoT0raa	You raise too many rhetorical questions, and none are worthy of my efforts for a well thought out response.<br>  <br>  But, re:<br>  "Do you not think it would be better if we kept our money, and just spend it on the women, instead of having the State as a middle man?:<br>  <br>  No, dear, I do not agree. I'd rather have some women and intelligent men in political positions influencing the responsible distribution of taxpayer wealth - that I am more than happy to contribute to - to ensure the welfare and survival of the caregivers of children in the absence of a supportive breadwinner. <br>  <br>  The young men of tomorrow pin their survival on women, not just men.<br>  <br>  And, while we are pointing randomly at examples in history, let us not forget the witches burned at stakes and women thrown into asylums for being inconveniently nonconformist when trying to be humane.<br>  <br>  Edit-<br>  Morbid One makes a great point about the vulnerability of the less privileged social classes, and that is where feminism finds its roots and reasons for endurance.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	It's the same thing. Feminism came about because women got sick of not having equal respect under the guise of "protection." Eventually they thought fending for themselves might not be such a bad thing after all. I'm not a religious person, but I still say, bless them.
iHKJsyfTaa	With support of their cause so limited, they count each echo as a 'yay' vote.|`|fW5qcU5uaa	Yes!  My English teacher!

kXhAERt3aa	If he said he was "too pitiful to do that" then it means that he felt he was inadequate to be your date, so he did not ask you out.  It comes down to a self-esteem issue.  Many younger guys feel that they need to meet a higher standard to ask a woman out, so women end up spending their evenings alone, perversely.  Later on, though, women tend to think they are unacceptable as partners when men are still simply shy and would gladly go out with just about any woman with a pulse, to be quite honest. Men are afraid to get their egos hurt by being refused, women do not want to look desperate, and as a result, there are many, many people who could be out every night of the week and instead they are at home wondering how they will every find someone.  People are just strange like that.|`|hRNpGnktaa	I think your brain has interpreted something and made an odd sentence. Maybe you picked up the word, and dont know how to use it in its context. But i guess that exact translation of that would be that he felt sorry for you, so asked you out. wow, thats harsh
hRNpGnktaa	I dont think there is actual solid proof, just paranormal situations, like as you said orbs on cameras. Arguments about dust/flying insects/reflections are still plausible though. But i personally have like a weird 6th sense, i dont see ghosts like walking around but i can feel them, or can feel when someone has died somewhere, because i grew up with a ghost in my room(well, i thought i did XD), and it kind of opened a new door which i think everyone has, you just need to have an experience to kick it open. I can also see auras around people, tell what sort of person they are and how they feel at that moment, ao they could be related.|`|xb3RjkV2aa	I've never actually seen any show that shows evidence either.

YC90VzIRaa	OMG, you all miss the point! You are creating the recession. Spend!<br>  <br>  Just spend on what brings you pleasure and meaning?<br>  <br>  Cut out the rubbish because it wasn’t fun anyway.<br>  <br>  So don’t have fast food - stay home and have delicious real food. And invite your neighbors over and cook. Have a barbecue.<br>  <br>  Use the recession to cut out the sleepwalking and start living.<br>  <br>  But don’t stop spending. The economy relies on the money going around and around.|`|7992aa6b297d96f8bc84f450dab331c3aa	In some ways, we have to deal with this recession because as a country we've earned it.  This particular recession happened because people in lots of different ways took on risks they couldn't afford.  We had a negative savings rate (meaning people were spending more than $1 for every $1 of income they had.)  The economy we had wasn't really sustainable.<br>  <br>  To get to your question though, the recession will be over once enough people and businesses have fixed their balance sheets to the point that they feel they can participate in the economy again.  A family that's deep in debt and at risk of having their house foreclosed is not going to spend the same way they might if they build up some savings and feel secure that they can keep going at their current rate of spending.  The recession sucks, but it's a necessary evil that forces us back into balance.|`|MJijF66Paa	Every country that has ever ran a fiat currency, or a currency with no intrinsic value, with a GDP largely based on consumer spending (US GDP = 70% consumer spending) has had recessions. Recession are necessary because in all the circumstances debt had to be liquidated and to offset MAL investments.<br>  <br>  This is the only way for the US economy to be fix. A country cannot run trade deficits and then hope that consumer spending will be relevant in growing our economy; going into debt to buy imported goods is a ridiculous idea for economic growth. A economy must be able to produce wealth to be solvent. <br>  <br>  The title of being the anchor currency has helped the dollar, but the current account deficit is going to have to find equilibrium with exchange rates sooner or later. I would suggest finding a way to hedge yourself against this.|`|N1gjj0i0aa	Its not so easy...|`|azqcWjmuaa	<a href="http://cosmos.bcst.yahoo.com/up/player/popup/?rn=3906861&cl=12126414&ch=4226713">http://cosmos.bcst.yahoo.com/up/player/p...</a><br>  <br>  This is sad.

Of course, there are many people whose lives haven't changed, so they're spending similarly to how they have always spent.  It's a recession, not a complete death of the economy.  And maybe you're among one of those whose lives haven't changed.  I know that mine certainly has, though, as have many others'. <br>  <br>  People on the whole aren't spending as much because many have lost money in the stock market, have lost their job and/or can't get access to credit to make larger purchases.  I'd love to be able to pull money out of thin air.  Unfortunately, the world doesn't work that way, so my spending is down more than half.  And there are many others like me who were fine a year ago and now can't afford to spend like they used to spend.|`|mpfqoLCVaa	Preventing further outsourcing of jobs seems to be the immediate solution.

RLoilwCNaa	Deep breaths. Inhale deep and let it out slowly. It truly helps.|`|lVVEF3c9aa	This is very easy to deal with. You need to teach yourself that when you start feeling this way, you quickly react to it by calming yourself through mediation. Once you learn to meditate you can replace that feeling with calmness, peace, and turn this into a positive situation. Remember meditation requires discipline, but once you get the hang of it, you can control yourself in any situation.

Y5jiOlAUaa	Well your one of many-a lot of people claim to be very sociable and appear popular on the surface, but scratch it and you will find a similar predicament-it's the human condition, and  yes loneliness is incurable, if you have no one come into your life to relieve you of it. I think you need to maybe start developing your good points so that you have a sense of self that others will warm to and identify with.   That has been the case for me personally over the last decade, and i know i am not sad, or weird or any other stereotype.   What sort of friends would you like? What would you want to do with them, you have to have something to offer them and maybe they will reciprocate.  It's society, puts pressure on people to be a certain way, often based on bad prejudices and social attitudes, not great but you can bend and adjust to it, to keep you safe, but more importantly, contented, that usually means taking a few chances. Don't try to be something that clashes with your ID, that will put 'em off.  Just be general, and give good feedback,  one day it will be returned.

9hANb2mdaa	You can spend your life trying to figure people out if you want to.<br>  <br>  Think about your own brain, should other people be able to tell why you think and do things yourself?<br>  <br>  No, they can't so forget about it.|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	That's interesting. Consider the position of an employee. They are there to be of service to their customers, to be a spokesperson if you will for the store they represent. While some people will do this naturally with an attitude of being genuinely supportive of the products sold because it is a good fit with them. For others it might not be a good fit, they might consider the products wasteful, or they might be thinking of what else they would rather be doing. It is two distinctly different attitudes. <br>  So in order for the second type of person {your friend} to do well, they have to act, and follow rules. Or they can leave, but they want to stay perhaps for the community, or money, or fear. This is not in snyc with where they want to be so it builds a resistance internally between how they should act and how they really are in this situation. What helps is fthat work mates are equal and commeradery assumes that everyone feels the same so the community becomes the vital element to keep the job. <br>  When a member of this safe community leaves the comunity needs to adjust. Because they let down their guard with you and welcomed you you are now percieved as a outsider who has left the group. Now he has to stay safe behind the mask and pretend he enjoys serving you.  The reluctant server now feels threatened, embarrassed and inferior.<br>  You can't change this persons attitude, but you can understand and forgive them...then be aware in the future and take care of that friendly attitude.|`|7F5fBdZoaa	Clock??

8d8ejHPfaa	The imagery suggests that you are reviewing some old issues that came with you to your new house, or perhaps you left them behind when you moved to your new house, and viewed that as an opportunity for a new start.  The rats represent problems or issues that you were dealing with in the past, the rats are dead now, showing that you have resolved the problems they represent.  Some things associated with the number seven are healing, resolution, and completion, these rats represent issues that you have put closure on and "put to rest" as in "rest in peace".  :)  Kitchen and mother are both symbols for mother and nurturing, floor can represent your support system and sense of security, it seems you had help in putting to rest whatever issues the rats represent.

It's the ultimate example of putting women on a pedestal and its truly ridiculous.<br>  <br>  Chivalry is not completely dead, but it IS on its death bed.

I say GOOD.|`|AA11773731	Yes, chivalry is dead and we women killed it.

He'll let a door slam shut on an older person with a walker..<br>  Perhaps all the anti-feminists will hold the door open for an elderly man at least even if they disagree with holding it for an old woman on principle..<br>  <br>  Common courtesy is no longer common. I can't stand  ANYONE that is inconsiderate of others regardless of gender.|`|kdwnmrRVaa	Chivalry isn't dead, never was. However, the current fad in male behavior seems to be men either emphasizing feminine traits, or going for the hyper-testosterone idiot-caveman image. In one case you have guys who want to act and be treated no different than the women they interact with, the "I'm-their-girlfriend" effect. On the other hand, you have the cavemen that want nothing more than to act like the polar opposite of their personal image of womanly behavior. Both of these can be seen as products of the feminist movement to some degree, either taking the idea to it's furthest conclusion, or rejecting it so strongly as to become the caricature of "dumb males"  that certain man-hating feminists have always accused them of being. If you need to see this polarization of male ideology in action, just visit any college campus. <br>  <br>  I think that feminism was an inevitable movement. The idea of woman's suffrage and equality in politics and the workplace should have been a fundamental part of America as the Land of Freedom in the first days of government. Still, the movement has achieved most of its goals, and it is time to let the lingering animosity of that conflict slip away. Maybe when men don't have to worry about being seen as chauvinists for pulling their date's chair out for her, chivalry can begin to creep back out of the cave it has been locked away in for so long.<br>  <br>  But before we see any mass return to gentlemanly conduct, this country will need to undergo a far broader reevaluation of its culture. As long as a man on the street can call a woman "b it ch" or "ho" without the nearest bystander punching him in the teeth, chivalry will remain in hibernation. In all honesty, does anyone on this board think that will happen in the near future? We live in a time when freedom of expression is seen as an excuse to be rude to anyone you please, and to conduct your life only according to guidelines that put personal pleasure to the individual as the ultimate goal. Why be polite to anyone that you don't need to be? Politeness is extra effort to be reserved only for situations in which a making a positive impression on a person can benefit you in the long run.<br>  <br>  One thing that disturbed me further on up this board was the fellow who suggested that chivalry DEGRADED MEN by placing women on a pedestal. He evidently meant that the other connotations of the word "chivalry", including honor, self-sacrifice, rejection of baseness, protection of the weak, loyalty to countrymen, and bravery in peace and war, would not grant him enough pride to overcome the utter humiliation he would feel by treating women with a little extra respect. What value can we men be putting on the idea of "manhood" if it is totally subverted by opening a door for a lady?<br>  <br>  Well, I can fight the trend. I turned 23 years old on January 8th, and with any luck I will be alive long after the year which  the user calling himself "Mike T" predicted as the funeral for the last lingering thread of chivalry. He may not teach his children what it means to be polite, or how decent people chose to show their respect for one another, but that is his right. It is also MY right to fight the attitudes he advocates at every turn. When I have children, you can be absolutely sure that chivalry has bought itself at least one more generation of life.<br>  <br>  -J.R.A.

U69Q6rsWaa	Despite Koko being popularly well known, there isn't that much research about her in scientific literature. A lot of what is claimed is anecdotal, so its hard to say either way.<br>  <br>  Some say that she has merely been conditioned to perform certain signs in certain contexts (as she is rewarded when she does), but has no abstract representation of what shes signing.<br>  <br>  It has argued that she is able to construct novel phrases for things she doesn't know the sign for though, which may indicate some level of abstract representation (i.e. the sign for a given term (e.g. food) is not simply conditioned to a particular stimulus (e.g. showing her food/being hungry).<br>  <br>  Of course, these things would be very difficult to test in a lab, I wouldn't expect much success if they were to present her with various objects to see if she constructs novel terms for them.<br>  <br>  There are other apes that feature more prominently in scientific literature on non-human language, e.g. Kanzi andPanbanisha the chimps, but the same problems apply in terms of whether we can claim they are truly have abstract representations (or whether abstract thought is required for what they can do).|`|AA11282654	I do not believe it can be properly demonstrated.

Giving this attention means that you want to improve it.<br>  <br>  Feeling alone doesn't depend about not having true friends, but it depends on your way of life too. Lets me give you some important tips:-<br>  <br>  1- Try to change your life, it is easy. Do something different in which you like. For example, go eat your breakfast outside with reading a book. I mean add some actions to your lifestyle.<br>  <br>  2- Don't worry about relationships, There are many people like and want you. Is not fair to give a last result because of three or four persons. Change your way in life and think what does life mean to you??..Every person has his own dreams and thoughts. So, do not waste your life and your happiness because of such simple feelings.<br>  <br>  3- Everyone feel sometimes as a lonely or no one like him. It is normal feeling. Why do we feel like that??..because it makes us to improve our life more and more.
