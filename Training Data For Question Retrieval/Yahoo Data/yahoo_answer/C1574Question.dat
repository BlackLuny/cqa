20090203030251AAi4jho	Travel;Air Travel	The importance of a degree for a commercial pilot?	I would like to be a commercial pilot for a major airline, I'm overwhelmed with 2 options I have met.      a) 2 years of schooling to get the requirements to enter uni and then do a 2-4 year course of uni. That's 4- 6 years to say I have a bachelor in Aviation!!      VERSES      b) 1 year to finish highschool, and jump straight into flying hours, ratings and licenses.      c) A different approach      How vital is this degree? It's SIX YEARS! I'd be 27 years old. Patience is a virtue, though, I know, but the uni degree has to be a clear cut winner for this decision- it's alot of time. I'd do anything to live this childhood dream, I'm just lacking direction with this decision! :(      I see so much mixed responses online, I hear it's absolutely ESSENTIAL to get a degree to get into this competitive industry, and other times I see it's advised.. but quite possibly not required.       Any insight, opinions, alternative options, whatever! very appreciated. Thanks

I am hesitant about going there for allot of reasons. We party hard, drink, and smoke. We are really loud but fun to be with. Is it possible to do any of this in California, or should we just have the cops waiting at the airport for us at baggage claim? And  if you tell me to quit, I will just light another one and tell you what is on my mind. Serious answers please. Thanks.
