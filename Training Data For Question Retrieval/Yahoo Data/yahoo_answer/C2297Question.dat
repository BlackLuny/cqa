20090205191851AASrHDf	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	What should i change about my character sketch?	so, i have a character sketch that i have to do on someone I know, so i did it on my little brother. i know its not that great, its kinda rushed... and english isn't my strongest subject...it's due tommorow, and i wanna know what you think? how could i change it to make it better? thanks            The Person who I’m doing my Character Sketch is my brother, Neel. First of all, he’s eight years old, and in grade 2. He has medium length black hair, and he is around four feet tall. He weighs just about 60 pounds, so you’d imagine he’s pretty scrawny. He has pale skin compared to me; he looks more Philipino because my mom is Philipino. When talking, he never pronounces his “th” right and he sort of has a girly voice.      Now about his personality, he can be a great person to hang out with, but he is very short tempered. My brother loves to play with his toy cars and his action figures. If he isn’t watching YTV or Discovery Channel, he’s playing with his toys. He’s reluctant to do homework and his priorities, but with enough talking to, he’ll eventually do it. Like most kids his age, he has a lot of energy and he is very outgoing.

20090205193033AAZAI0g	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	A question for teachers, middle schoolers, etc: DO I BELONG IN HONORS?	------Be Prepared for a long description question!-------      I have been in honors throughout my whole middle school years.   In six grade, i got all 3.0's and higher.    But after my dad passed away in the middle of sixth grade, i found myself to become lazy, careless, and 'free'.   In seventh grade, i recieved my first 'D' which made me stress really badly. That was also the first time i got my first 2.83, my only GPA under a 3.0   My mom is now very, very, careless about me and my brother.   I am under the list of 'TRUANTS' in my Middle School.      Now, i am in 8th grade, and my first report card i recieved was the time i got my first F. I wasn't that shocked nor sad.   But now, i relized i'm doing worse and worse each report card.   My counselor told me i might have to repeat the 8th grade, because of my grades.   But i managed to get NO FINAL F'S on my report card, which means i'm graduating! (=   I know i'm a smart girl [not to be bragging] but i'm really lazy, and i'm asking you if i should switch to regular class, i mean, with my potential, do i really belong in honors?!   For each class, i recieve a 5 on my report card, which means my abscences are effecting my grade.   Regular's class will be easy for me, to work on my patience, and help me improve the skills i've been missing out on in honors.   But in honors it's challenging for me, which is good, but everytime i stay home from school, i seem to miss what seems like a chapter of work.      Do i belong in honors? /=

Hes so mean, if you ask him something hell yell at you infront of the class and sscream how he just went over this and why dont you get it. He told me its so sad he has to do this because i really did improve from last term..How is that wen i got a C-. Grades are really important to me, im a junior and i need good grades for college. He told me he'd mess with my grades to see what he can do, but he already turned the D+ in for report cards.What should i do about this ?

Basically, I need to pick an american literature book that has to do with the time period that it was written in. Also, I need to write about why the author decided to write it. I have a list of books, I'm just not sure which one is the best choice. I'd appreciate some help lol:      The Kite Runner   A Thousand Splendid Suns   East of Eden   The Great Gasby   The world according to Garp   Where the heart is   Treasure Island   Slaughterhouse 5   Gone with the Wind   The Grapes of Wrath   To the Lighthouse   Revolutionary Road   A Farewell to Arms   Tender is the Night   Huckleberry Finn/Tom Sawyer      If you read any of these books, did you like them?   Do you know the reason why the author wrote it, if he experienced something similar in his lifetime?    Which one do you suggest I read? (especially one that is greatly affected by the time period that it takes place in.)      I'm open to other suggestions...   Thanks soooooo much. =) God Bless.

20090205174614AAQt3Be	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	Whether or not to take AP AB Calculus?	I'm pondering whether or not to take AP Calculus. I'm currently enrolled in full IB, with Math SL (the harder, but not the hardest) as my math. I'll remain in full IB next year (my senior year) but i'm thinking about whether or not i should take AP Calculus. Benefits, it's guaranteed college credit (with a 4-5 on the exam that is), i'll be well prepared to take it, and the prerequisites are either Math SL or Math 140 (a college level class non-IB people take senior year). So, i guess my question is, is the AP Calculus (its Calculus AB, keep in mind) really difficult? I don't want to waste an elective block without the colelge credit it forebears. So those who have taken the AP Calculus AB exam, do you think i'll be able to pass? Oh, and its every day for a semseter, not A/B day. So former people in the class, help PLEASE!

20090205173504AAQqpWc	Education & Reference;Other - Education	How can I prepare after being recommended for expulsion?	Okay, I'm tired of looking for help and ONLY finding advice on what to do if your child is expelled. I'm the child, and I want to know what I can do, not what my mother can, to attempt to make my situation better.   This is my side-      I was walking outside with a friend during lunch, which in itself is nothing new. We do this allot, but this time we got caught. A teacher saw us and reported it, and the officer was sent out to get us. When we saw the officer, we started to walk the other direction, but he called so we went to him and walked with him back to the school. Then they took me into the conference room in one of the sub schools, after being searched. They found a blade on me, which I had forgotten to take out of my pocket that day. Along with that, they found medical supplies in my bag.      I was treating a burn I got that had become infected cause I kept scratching it by dabbing the area with rubbing alcohol to disinfect it ; and then I would soak it in hydrogen peroxide and cover it up with a band-aid. I was borrowing these two bottles from a friend of mine, and since the burn is as healed as it is going to get, I was returning it to her and had left it in my bag.      So the school has three things against me, walking away from an officer, having the knife, and the medical supplies.   The law has one issue, since the knife was over 3 inches (It wasn't exactly a kitchen knife, I have it for protection- I do allot of walking at night to get around). Hopefully I can get off okay with the law, since this is my first offense. If I'm lucky, I'll end up with community service and a form of counseling.      The school has to take it more seriously though, being zero tolerance. So they have suspended me until they investigate further, and know whether I am being expelled or not. As of right now, I am suspended and cannot be on any of our county public school property (bus stops, etc). If they recommend me for expulsion, there will be a court trial which will determine whether I am expelled or not, and the details of the expulsion(if it is all  county schools, just this school, if I can come back, etc).      I have to admit that the administrators handled it very well. My grade's principle was a bit rash, but he has to be; its his job. Most of them actually treated me like a person, especially the Officer, and I respect them greatly for that. When you are dealing with someone who is doing something illegal or caught with something illegal, it is extremely easy to consider them beneath you and treat them like crap- and nobody will think twice about it.      I understand that there is probably nothing I can do, but can someone tell me how this process works, or at least a place to go to so that I can find out? At this point I've been recommended, and I want to at least know the process more thoroughly before the hearing.

20090205191504AAsmU8s	Education & Reference;Home Schooling	Questioning my ability to home school children with current circumstance.... support/advice?	The homeschooling we have down! We've been teaching them since they first wanted to learn! However, we moved cross country 7 months ago and are finding it hard to help our oldest (almost 5) socialize. I had a high risk pregnancy (which means I now have a baby consuming so much of my time) and that caused lack of socializing opportunities. And now with the baby we have the same problem. So I am actually considering putting her in school come fall, because although I know I can teach her, I don't want her to be socially mishapped because we couldn't make things happen. We did have friends in our old town, but now she is cowering in a shell when she meets children and I don't know how to break it!! We did join yahoo groups, but they don't meet in the winter and since we couldn't attend for months, I don't remember anyone. We plan on putting her in a dance class this spring, but again she doesn't know how to act around others anymore, plus most dance classes don't have time for socializing, just learning dance. So help/ advice, before we make the wrong decision?

Kyle was expecting an exciting vacation in Oregon. But was his vacation too exciting?      Kyles dad said that he was salesman of the year and won a free trip to Oregon. Kyle knew he would need to fly to get there; Kyle said hes never flown before and was looking forward to the flight. When Kyle and his family arrived at their hotel it was still under construction and they had to stay at the totem pole in across the street. When they arrived at that hotel they noticed it wasnt as high class as the other so they were disappointed.      Kyles parents told him he would need to babysit Beebee for a night. Later on during the night Kyle and Beebee ordered pizza and milkshakes as they started to eat the felt the ground tremble its an earthquake. Beebee said something smelts like burning chicken. Kyle then heard a loud beeping sound; its the smoke alarm Kyle yelled. Kyle opened the door and the hallway was filled with smoke. He grabbed Beebee and rushed into the bathroom soaked two towels and held it over their mouth and nose the rush down and out of the hotel then they saw a tsunami coming and rushed uphill two came up that didnt hit them but the third one it was high enough it raised to their ankles. Once they were over they went to a tent on the beach. They were both worried if their parents were alive or not. All the sudden beebee yelled mom. Dad and they reunited.        My favorite part in this story was when Kyle and Beebee met an older couple who offer to let them stay at their house and help save them.      The next time someone ask me whats a good book I will try reading the book Escaping The Giant Wave.

He seems to always be talking about people getting beaten, sexual abuse, murder, suicide, etc. etc.    I understand how it may be ok to bring it up once or twice simply to open other kids' eyes about what goes on in the world...but it seems that we can't go a week without doing an assignment or at least talking about it.  I've been abused by my parents before, and it really bothers me that he continues to talk and talk and talk about it with his disguisting little smile. He swears way too much and sometimes he swears AT us. Sometimes I think that he delves too much into his personal life with us and asks us to share things that are personal to us. Some of the stuff I'm ok with, but there are other topics I just can't help but question. The fact that he seems to thrive on this stuff just makes me all around uncomfortable with him. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way.    What should I do about it? I mean, I really don't want the guy to lose his job if that is the cost.  I just want him to stop.

We have to write an essay in the form of a diary entry, I need a good mark, constructive critisim please?         Dear Diary,      Have you ever felt liked you have seriously ****** up? Of course you have, after all no single person is perfect, and at some time we have all have “Oh **** “moments. Let me tell you about how I made a huge mistake.      It started with internet chatting, a good friend of mine introduced me to Myspace, and at first I wasn’t really all that into it. But, I was getting picked on at school, terribly, and my good friend suddenly became a not so good friend. So in a search for companionship I took to the World Wide Web.      Now, at the beginning I just started adding (as a friend) anyone who was, let’s say, a little on the wild side. I was at my rebellious stage and I thought that going against the rules was both smart and cool. So, I added mainly Satanists and Goths. The appeal was great at the time.      Eventually I cam across Arron, I chose to invite him to be my friend on no other grounds except of his choice of religion. Which now I see as rather bad decision, but what can I say?       We seemed to get along pretty well, he was a Fascist and a Nazi lover, and I busy hating the world for the way I was being treated at school. I admit I was pretty stupid, na?ve and ignorant at the time. He suffered from Aspersers, the reason for his desire to blow up the world, I did not know this then, though I can’t say even if I had that I would have thought it through.       After talking for a year or more, and as we all know it is easier to share secrets with a person whom expects nothing from you. So, I grew attached and the romance slipped in.   I know that I am too young too be romantically in love, but I was just a kid.      We ended up meeting, he lived in a small town quite far away, but I was flying down to visit my great-grand mother who was sick and dying. It was decided that a museum would be a lovely place to meet up. The day went quite well and I felt an attraction to this stranger. Over the internet, we had been confessing our love to each other, but I must say I was unsure.      After a while I grew up; I realized that I being immature and that it would get me nowhere. I took up an interest in languages and politics, much preferably on the Socialist side. Arron wasn’t impressed about that; he thought I was losing my individuality, I beg to differ. I think now I am far more aware and understanding of things, I know I am idealistic, but what is wrong with that? Not a single thing, everything starts with an ambition, a dream.      Anyway, back to where I was.  I could feel myself growing to dislike him and his childish ways, he need for hatred. I know he was born like that, so I made up my mind to keep my feelings hidden. Until now. I broke it to him in an email (which other way could I have done it?), he was angry, as should be expected. I had just  told him that I desired nothing more from him than friendship.   I know that I have lied, I feel bad about it, but at the beginning I really did think I loved him like that. I just didn’t know him well enough. I told him (yet another lie) that I doubted I could love anyone like that, but the truth is, even though I am so young, I one day know I will be able to love in that way, it’s just he will not be the one.      He then threatened me, not physically, but he stated that if he wanted he could have anyone he liked, I replied that I could also. He wanted me to feel just as bad as he did, though I’m not sure he was upset at all. Oh, I don’t know what to do, I can’t just abandon him! And yet I feel unsafe around him.      Yours truly, Anna.

I am almost done with sophomore year and so far haven't taken any regular classes, I've been PreAP everything (which I think is considered 'honors', though I'm not sure, I was hoping one of you could tell me). I know I am doing AP Computer Science 2 next year, and perhaps will take AP Computer Science 3 senior year (I am probably going to major in something with computers, and I have an easy 100 in PreAP Computer Science 1 right now). Next year, I might take AP English 3 and/or AP Stats. I am thinking I will at least eventually take AP Stats before I graduate, not too sure when though. If I have constant PreAP's to back it up with maybe a few regular classes here or there, is it enough to get into a decent college? (was thinking something like Texas A&M, UT in Austin, or Texas Tech (which I heard is easy to get into)). This is without including other factors such as GPA or extracurriculars.
