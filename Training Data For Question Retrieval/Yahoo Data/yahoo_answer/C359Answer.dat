AA11314600	The hand prints were from all the children she had killed.  How she killed them is never really specified.  Use your imagination, that is the whole point of the movie anyway    edit: I didn't mean to sound condescending there|`|ZaYyXiJAaa	They never really say. Maybe all the figures in the trees allude hanging?|`|Twzg9s0caa	She bored them to death by telling them how hard it is to be a witch.|`|ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	I doubt that she uses a gun, starvation, or poisoning so it's either by stabbing, cutting 'em up with a knife or hatchet, strangulation, or beating them with a rock, maybe. It's never said in the movie. According to folklore, she is said to bring her victims into the basement in twos and while one stands in the corner with their back to her, she kills one, then the other.

Thats when my birthday is and everything is so beautiful.|`|HimBbU6caa	I like the Fall. It represents death and regeneration to me. I like the feeling in the air right after summer. When everything is all bright and warm, suddenly the air changes and the leaves fall. It reminds me of how fragile life and existence is, so I never take it for granted. It helps me appreciate the Spring season so much more once the winter fades.

People to see, time is precious  I look at my crowd and they out of control  Just like my mind where I'm going  No women, no shorties, no nothin but clothes  No stoppin now, my parolees on role  I like my jewelry, that's always on gold  I know the storm is comin  my pockets keep tellin me it's gonna shower  Call up my homies that's home  Then pop in the night cuz it's meant to be ours  We keep a fade away shot cuz we ballin  it's platinum patron that be ours  Lil mama, I owe you just like the flowers  Girl you to drink with all that and power clubs    Flo Rida  You spin my head right round, right round  When you go down, when you go down down  Kesha  You spin my head right round, right round  When you go down, when you go down down    Flo Rida  From the top of the pole I watch her go down  She got me throwin my money around  Ain't nothin more beautiful to be found  It's goin down down.  From the top of the pole I watch her go down  She got me throwin my money around  Ain't nothin more beautiful to be found  It's goin down down    Flo Rida  Hey  Shawty must know I'm not playin  My money love her like a numba one fan  Don't look at my mouth, let her talk to my fans  My Benjamin Franklins  A couple of grands, I got rubber bands  My paper planes makin a dance  Get dirty all night, that's part of my thing  Keep building castles that's made out of sand  She's amazing, the fire blazing  Hotter than ....  Girl won't you move a lil closer?  Time to get paid, it's maximum wage  That body belong on a poster  I'm in a daze, that bottom is wavin' at me  Like damn it I know you  You wanna show like a gun out of holster  Tell me whatever and I'll be your roper ..    Flo Rida  You spin my head right round, right round  When you go down, when you go down down  Kesha  You spin my head right round, right round  When you go down, when you go down down    Flo Rida  From the top of the pole I watch her go down  She got me throwin my money around  Ain't nothin more beautiful to be found  It's goin down down  From the top of the pole I watch her go down  She got me throwin my money around  Ain't nothin more beautiful to be found  It's goin down down    Flo Rida  I'm spendin my money  I'm out of control  Somebody help me  She's takin my bank roll.  But I'm king of the club  And I'm wearin the crown  Poppin these bottles  Touchin these models  Watchin they asses go down down    Flo Rida  You spin my head right round, right round  When you go down, when you go down down  Kesha  You spin my head right round, right round  When you go down, when you go down down  Flo Rida  You spin my head right round, right round  When you go down, when you go down down  Kesha  You spin my head right round, right round  When you go down, when you go down down  When you go down, when you go down down|`|0Vpm9vHDaa	I think its "You Spin Me Around (Like a Record)" by Dead or Alive|`|4zvjt5Cnaa	You Spin Me Around - Dead or Alive|`|ptwIHv09aa	Flo Rida:  Right Round  feat.

lILfQh6xaa	to her text, say why didnt you then? I agree with you if you and your brother are close. But to not tell your parents, that is wrong. You have 2 choices here. First, be upset with them and do all you can do make their engagement the worst in history. Or choice number 2, You can congratulate them, tell them you wished they told you sooner, and maybe help them out with some of the plans. Good luck|`|6oZagLCvaa	congrats|`|Lq15FydAaa	i wouldn't really care|`|SDSmotQiaa	I'd be a little offended.|`|022f1c3b90d1d4ff6e3967675d1ff3b1aa	I'd just tell him "good luck with that."|`|E1sqGzmtaa	Just let it go. He is not obligated to tell anyone at any certain time.|`|dPJWgzTRaa	Congratulate him and tell him you are happy for him.|`|cf4c77000dd8c8bfd28c8ed28d73c296aa	I would have been upset if I was not informed from my brother right after an engagement. I feel the same way you do on the situation. I don't know what you could say, except maybe question why he didn't tell you sooner.|`|724236ad3a6f20acded0447cbdeb28aaaa	I really wouldn't care. He's my brother but he's got his own separate life. It's not like it's my engagement.|`|NPwOxS3eaa	ah well its better than what my brother did. waited like 5 months into dating this girl and he told me like two days before hand he was going to elope.     Eh i don't think you should say anything. If it's what your brother wants  and if it makes him happy, then let him go ahead with it but if you truly think hes making a mistake then try all you can do talk him out of it.|`|gFkNVxywaa	I'd say it's between the two of them, not between one of them and me.    If they told one family and not the other, I can only assume they were worried about the reaction they might get.|`|J9j9B8BAaa	It's his business, not yours.  Get over it.|`|AA12098543	Congrats!!  Good thing you waited to tell us. She might have bolted like that girl who was engaged to Drew Petersen.|`|oGWQil5daa	Congrats|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Hm interesting.|`|c3MFIbeUaa	First, I believe your bro thinks his family will be disappointed in his choice of fiances and they thought by postponing the inevitable it will help them ( your family) get used to them being together.   My question is this the same brother you had problems with an ex girlfriend before?   It seems like he has a choice of picking wrong girls and really never wanted his families opinions. He values hers though until he is put in another bad situation.   She is right though they could have just eloped but that implies little caring for either family, his or hers.   I suggest if they hide so much from their families they lack so much of what a marriage should be based upon.   Trust,  and openness. This sounds like neither and i wonder just how influenced your brother is on this decision.   If he still wants to go ahead with the marriage then by doing so he puts rules on your relationship with him.   You must either accept the marriage and start over knowing they are a couple and she must be treated like family now. Or forget about the both as if you include him and not her into the fold shows you value your brother very little as it pulls at his happiness.   In knowing how your family might react is why he never told them in the first place.   Your family must sit down with the young couple and get to know the both of them for this to work.   Anything else is not helpful to the healing that his distrust in telling this news has caused to his family.   To this i suggest prayer in finding the encouragement to deal with situation as it can lead to a lifelong scars and wounds that never heal at all.   My Prayers goes out to you.   This happened by the way to my sister and my father.   My Father and i stayed away from the wedding and two kids later he became a very abusive husband.   Just as my Dad said he would become as a hot tempered young man when we met him.   However my father was left to pick up those emotional, physical and monetary scars of that marriage.|`|kEtYEmhqaa	I'd say congratulations|`|pBiGGoRUaa	wow I would be upset as well but what can you do about it?|`|b4twAWp7aa	My little brother actually told me he was married about a month later. We were at a restaurant and I asked him who his lady friend was and he was like "My wife" and then really loud I said "YOU"RE MARRIED??"|`|HS44HUrgaa	i couldnt care. its his decision not mine.|`|KFpEaY3raa	cool bro.|`|QBFjMRfuaa	i would be mad too|`|mIwNCjqZaa	Life is too short for grudges. Its his choice when to tell you. Be supportive : )|`|NwpGhT31aa	I would have said congratulations!!    Its his life not yours so get over it.|`|r8s5j6zOaa	mine got married and didn't tell me|`|WCkaZ4N7aa	get over it... he'ts not like its the worst thing hes done... s family... watevs i|`|3MB1Wsdaaa	His fiance needs to back off-it's his family to deal with not hers and she really isn't making a good start of things. If you're that mad then don't go to the wedding-tell them they should have eloped.  Seems though-there are things you're not mentioning-is there a reason they wouldn't want to tell your family-is he young?
AA10297143	Laughter is the best medicine.  Go see Mall Cop.|`|d6dVMApeaa	If you want a light, happy, funny movie, then Mall Cop, but if you want a movie that will get you thinking, then The Uninvited is a good one!|`|MkImXLulaa	The uninvited, cuz it has a grueling scarry *** twist|`|dCYFV6qbaa	depends on your mood.   if you want a laugh: mall cop  if you want to be confused and scared: uninvited|`|iVHfNbAMaa	uninvited is better.

vsy4QMHMaa	I can see why you're having problems finding them when you're looking in the Classical section.    ... try pop.|`|wzwkDFRpaa	try thepianocian.com  it's under sheets and then click the other link|`|qa9yILDyaa	You should try Pianofiles. It's a website where you can trade piano sheets with other people. You can sign up for free and they will usually trade with you. I know for a fact that there are plenty of Chris Brown and Kelly Clarkson piano sheets. (The link for the song does not actually take you to the song, it's just telling you that the person has the song. You would have to ask for the sheet music.) You can also submit sheets too. It's a really good site, you should try it! :)    You can also try My Piano. They have plenty of free piano sheets there, but they have no Chris Brown sheet music. Hope this helps!

6fxr3VBGaa	just a tip. don't separate your bars like that. you had about 21 lines and it should of been like half of that. make sure the end of each line is always a rhyme.    an example with your lyrics.  through each adolescents getting worse and worse like an infection  i'm looking for perfection but it seems that ain't in my selection    just flows better for the reader    overall/lyrically it was alright 7/10|`|7a5900dd33706d6ef39661952113f6deaa	That's tight, that's tight! -Wizard Kelly.|`|4hiMgHMCaa	It was better than mine.

Good luck! Give it a chance.|`|xDwMiH14aa	omg my aquarius bf was exactly the same!! we went out for a couple months but then we broke up and i haven't heard from him since..    anyway i think they just need their space and you'll just have to accept that they randomly do their own thing for awhile. i'm sure he still loves you though.

S2uAq7i4aa	Actually,I have a "Top 4".  The fixed signs are the most loyal in my opinion.  I even heard that the animals are the ones protecting G-d's throne.    midnite.scribe - She asked which "SIGNS" not which "SUN SIGNS".  Can't you see?I am so sick of people that are too lazy to answer answering with "You need more than sun sign".  Without the signs,how would you know what a Leo Mars or a Libra Venus mean?|`|VHxZuaOfaa	Yea fixed signs     Taurus Scorpio Leo Aquarius would be the most loyal, but I think the Earth & Water can be the most loyal if a person has a lot of water & earth in there chart there's a possibility|`|9JEyfhfPaa	Yes I agree, fixed signs ...taurus, aquarius, leo and scorpios->(but I'm not sure for the last one)|`|dHjvUkvLaa	Stop signs are pretty loyal, but speed limit signs cannot be trusted.|`|COInPqBdaa	I think Sagittarius and capricorn|`|wuQnu3sFaa	taurus and cancer i think|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Your question indicates a naivety regarding astrology.     No sun sign will indicate anything on its own. Reading a chart is like looking at an artist's work, there are many different brush strokes, depths of colour, areas of emphasis that all go together to form a complete image. Looking at one discrete part of a chart, although commonly done and discussed among novices and amateurs, makes as much sense as cutting that image I referred to into a jigsaw and then trying to get an impression of the whole picture from just one piece.|`|gEnWVe76aa	Virgo, Pisces, and Aquarius|`|AWC9OcQ4aa	virgo,pieces and leo.|`|EhLYiIZ2aa	Cancer, Taurus and Capricorn|`|dlmVTt18aa	Leo   Capricorn  Cancer|`|s1oDY9Tfaa	Scorpio!

Then they invented store security cameras.|`|AA12349214	Speeding - obvious one.  Used to play inside an old hotel that meant breaking into it when I was a kid - I think that was against the law.  Went the wrong way up a one way street because it was quicker - and it was late at night so no one was about much thank goodness.  Stole a bar of chocolate on a dare when I was 9.  But felt so guilty I went and put it back and nearly got caught doing so!  As students we doctored the electricity meter - I mean, didnt everyone then?!  As young adults we bought childrens ski passes rather than the adult ones because they were half the price and we were all broke!  But no one checked them or noticed!  I think thats enough to be going on with!|`|UgNHBJ3Jaa	no i'm a good girl *bats eyes*|`|nkmwGAKjaa	50 in a 35 MPH zone is all.  ;-(|`|Is3pmbbKaa	Yes.

When I was a teen I shoplifted, but who didn't?!  I've littered once or twice.  Exposed myself in public (I peed on the side of an old building in the middle of nowhere).  I'm sure I've broken more laws, but that's enough for now lol|`|jCFWPWpUaa	No, never.  I'm a good girl.|`|RoNQpMjdaa	I've broken the law so many times it hurts. the last time i got busted it was for swimming in a public pool at 3am while drunk.|`|d55f9fa303ffed7693f24381e6799502aa	Yeah I parked on double yellows, unintentional of course

I cannot change their world but I can let them know they are not alone and somebody cares about my online friends.

fx3gIRh2aa	Ableton Live is for editing audio & MIDI. However, in Reason, you can only edit MIDI. Neither one is "better", it just depends on what tasks you're trying to accomplish.
9GPckvDaaa	no. probably not.    some theaters are just selling them early.      but, they officially goon sale then.|`|fZ0ECVA2aa	no a lot of move places are going on sale before then i got mine before the 6 and mine  aren't fake.
OrjPe9Kyaa	Hmm.. you might have watched some of these before, but here are my recommendations:    Gokusen 1 & 2 & 3: There are three season to it, and they are all taking place in high school. Well, it mostly involves this class which is full of mischievous guys who always get in trouble. .. Until this female teacher comes, and she's different from all the other teachers, cause she actually cares about these guys. And then it evolves, as the dramas talk about how she teaches the kids to be better, etc. It's quite comedic sometimes, and there's a bit of romance too. Maybe not the BEST for comedy/romance, but it's certainly alright. :)  http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Gokusen    Nobuta wo Produce: There is a guy named Shuuji (the popular one, with a girlfriend and several friends) and Akira (kind of the odd one out, doesn't care that much about what others think) and they go to the same school. One day, this odd girl named "Nobuta" came to the school, being the new girl. She's always shy, doesn't speak much, and her hair always covers her eyes. Shuuji and Akira make a plan: To make Nobuta popular, or as they call it.. "producing a new Nobuta", thus the name. :)  It's full of romance and comedy, I really loved it!  http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Nobuta_wo_Prod...    - Hana Kimi: Oh if you want romance and comedy, you should definitely watch this if you haven't. It's one of the BEST ones out there. ? It's about a girl named Mizuki who fangirls over a highschool high-jumper named Sano. He goes to a all-boys highschool, so Mizuki pretends to be guy (cuts her hair, everything) and goes to the school just to meet him. There, she lives a hectic life, as the relationship between Sano and some other guy named Nakatsu advances. It's REALLY cute, full of romance and comedy. You should try it!  http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Hanazakari_no_...    - My Boss, My Hero: Hmm.. might not be a LOT of romance, but there is a bit for sure. And it's ULTRA funny, probably the funniest drama I've ever watched, so I recommend it. It's about a 20 something (?) year old heir to a Japanese gang, but he's really stupid. So his father, the leader, makes him go back to highschool and pretend he's still a teen. And he has to hide his identity and stuff, as he creates several adventures while being a highschool student.   http://wiki.d-addicts.com/My_Boss_My_Her...    - Yamada Taro Monogatari: You should definitely try this one, it's full of comedy and romance as well! There is a poor guy who goes to this very rich school (but nobody knows that he's poor), and also this very rich guy. They are both the best students in the whole school (their talents, grades, AND looks). And so it involves love, and their relationship as they continue on through highschool. It's REALLY good, you should try it!   http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Yamada_Taro_Mo...    Hehes, that's all. Sorry if you've already watched these, have fun!

And my best friend used to be friends with Ryan Sheckler's cousin, or something like that. So she has his msn address, and I have it too, but we're not allowed to give it to anyone else.

Good Luck!|`|5hWnamNZaa	It's ok she reuses lots of words.|`|L3hGhv6iaa	i really think its good but instead of writing "the time is going by" try to elaborate it and make it a little more meaningful and here's a tip: if you are writing a song try to put your own feelings into it and make as true to yourself as possible. I think that your sister is going to be a really good songwriter one day. Just keep trying = ]|`|b9fd917c446e0d2b1c604b0ed7e053c6aa	too ryhmy|`|l1SQOIjoaa	I love it. But... It really depends on how you sing it and the voice. :)|`|Wg0nwOiiaa	well we have to hear the song before we can say if it was good or not.|`|Tv6NEg8Uaa	I like it.|`|cxinfzJtaa	its amazingg! i'd totally  buy her CD! but i wanna hear the tune first :]]|`|lUjjfS4Raa	too deep at the beginning . . . she should lead into the more complex stuff till later in the song    GOOD THOUGH!|`|bbe992ba0d36ecd3d6cc640e105a921eaa	That's pretty good.  It would be better if I heard the music which is why I just said 'Good.'    But still, it's pretty good!|`|SiwjKLZHaa	those are really good lyrics!!!|`|IQssydjSaa	That sounds really good.  But I can't say for sure because i don't know the melody   What instruments are she planning on using with it?|`|5fZfNuIcaa	it starts out good but the lines are to long for a slow song near the end compared to the top. i am a band manager and know this stuff. i also want to know what kind of music or sound goes with it. it might make a hit some day and your sister could become famous someday with some help.|`|kZ9TTWZ9aa	Well I cant answer your question untill i get a tune|`|evEJxv06aa	its fantastic tell her to finish the song i love to read it and so will the others to and tell her to write more would like to read them ok.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	It depends how it actually sounds, anyone can write poetry but making a good song is a different ball game.|`|74jTo7o8aa	luv it

Those first three albums cover the range of the group's style and sound - raw energy and creativity abound. You might find some of the lyrics inscrutable, if not downright bizarre, but again the group is projecting an aura, if you like. This is not a band for someone who only wants a "10 Best" CD.  Future albums had larger art & production budgets, and the band's songwriting, singing and stage shows became a bit more sophisticated in keeping with their rising fame - but you can develop more of an appreciation for those albums (and their occasional foray into the Top 40) by starting with the first three.|`|G1glDc5Iaa	Just get a best of or greatest hits album

9mPux1fFaa	If he's your best friend you really should have fonder memories. Try taking him for a walk everyday. But not just any old walk - make it like an adventure. Or else take him to an obedience class and learn together. That way you can let him off the lead in a nearby forest and just go hiking together.   You could take him camping  Or take him to the beach and let him frolik in the surf  You could brush his fur everyday (even if it's short) as this helps to reaffirm your bond with him.  You could teach him to fetch and play with him everyday  Or teach him some really cool tricks! When my Dad got his first dog he taught it to make a huge "death scene" whenever my Dad went "BANG!!" This made everybody laugh but took him a lot of time to train!  Dogs are great and loyal friends. There are plenty of things you can do together - even if it's just him snuggling up on the couch with you.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Play fetch with him. I have a puppy and he's learned to play. It's balls of fun. I'm gonna teach him to play frisbee when he grows bigger than the frisbee|`|AnIgXRcJaa	Just try to make him the happiest dog in the world.

Mainly, love him!|`|W4Dek41Jaa	Oh!  With my dog, I love sitting down and cuddling with him.  So, what you should do is go get your dog, and coo to him, and enjoy him as the amazing animal that he is.  I absolutely love watching my dog and just staring at him, it's amazing how different yet alike he is to me.  He always does these ridiculous things, haha it's hilarious.  Also, get a towel and have your dog pull the other end and you pull the opposide side.  When I do this with my dog whose extremely large, he ends up pulling me across a room!  It's really funny and memorable.  And talk to your dog, I love talking to my dog or any animal basically.  It's just fun, he'll sit there and listen, well he should sense that you don't want to get up and run around.  Get a ball,and roll it around, and take it away and make him try to get it.  Make up your own games.  Also, go for a walk with him if he wants to dig, dig with him.  You could also try to look for other dogs he could possibly be friends with.  And don't you love petting your dog and seeing the expression on his face?  Of complete comfort and how happy he is!?  Give your dog treats to, practice tricks.  It's fun.  Take pictures, you can basically do anything!  Dogs are one of the amazing things in the entire world.  I hope you can make memories.

GBKaftrJaa	In that one season John refused to enter the code and the hatch was going to explode and Desmond turned the key to save the island.  The hatch did explode and when the people found it after time traveling, that's the state it was in first.  So they knew they were in time sometime after the hatch was destroyed.    Then they jumped in time to a time where the hatch wasn't found yet at all and Desmond was still in it turning the key.    And yes, there was a point in time where John tried to dig it up but they haven't seen it in that time period yet.|`|DUg1IkTIaa	Yes, it was when they failed to enter the numbers and then Desmond turned the "fail-safe" key.  The hatch imploded.    It's important to remember that the island is time-tripping, and the characters are also.  They have shown the "Hatch" in many episodes, sometimes it's OK (ie: when Daniel told Desmond to find his mom), and sometimes it's NOT OK (ie: when John was trying to open the hatch door and the light came on).|`|dASHruataa	Making it up as they go along.

Right now, they're working on a remake of "Friday the 13th" and also a remake of "Nightmare on Elm Street." Both remakes will probably change the characters of Freddy and Jason, so no one knows what the "FvJ2" movie would look like yet. Once those remakes are out and if they're successful, then it seems like the FvJ sequel will go into production. Around the same time they produce "Batman vs Superman."

6qsTmMQaaa	~~SPOILER ALERT~~    Well, it kind of steals from The Sixth Sense; Anna sees her sister throughout the entire film, but it turns out that Anna accidentally killed her sister and her mother ten months before. She was angry with her dad's girlfriend, because Anna saw her dad and her mom's nurse having sex, and she went to burn down the whole house out of anger. She got a lantern, and a watering can of gasoline, but spilled some of it and knocked down the lantern. Her mother, who was in the boathouse, began ringing, and, Anna's siter, who was nearby, went to check on her, and that was when the boathouse exploded. It's a very confusing concept, but it was very well tied together in the end.    If you'd like to see it, but are unable to, you could try renting the original version, the Korean one, online, or at a local video store.|`|j06SPzuhaa	how about see the movie.|`|8UYVD8Lgaa	basically anna imagines her sister there.  because after being in the mental hospital she brainwashes herself  to thinking her sister was still alive and comes to realization that her step mom killed her mother. but really the step mom is innocent and anna hallucinated the whole ordeal. And kills the step mom because thats what she wanted to do in the first place.   she also gets this idea from her inmate from the hospital ..mildred kemp  a women who was a nanny for a family but killed the mother and kids to have the father all to herself.

I think the idea of every season having/being a song is a great one and very pretty, but since the seasons are so different, it might be cool to make every one have a different sort of song. Then you could have 'Season's Sonata' be the name of the series as a whole and every section under it be a different song. Since the entire thing together is called 'Season's Sonata', it would suggest that the combination of all the season's songs create one big song, which would create a sense of flow as well as variety to the series so the readers don't get bored with the word 'sonata'.     As for all the names, I'd pick something fitting to the season. For example, winter is cold, dull in color and moves kind of slow. It's often seen to be a bit sad in a way, what with the disappearance of alot of the plants and animals you normally see. This being the case, one could easily relate it to a slow, quiet song. Kind of unmoving and unimposing, but at the same time noticeable and beautiful. Kind of like a nocturne, which can be slow and kind of eerie, maybe lonely. (This also suggests a sense of calmness since they're usually written for night-time, hence the prefix ''noct'.)    But this is just what I would do. You don't have to listen to me of course. (^_^)

e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	She does have Marnie's eyes.  The producers and writers have said that also in the official forums state that.  I think that because the "explination" scenes [grave robber is actually employed by Rotti and works for geneco and steals marnies body from nathans house; etc] were taken out for "time" [aka stupid lionsgate nazi's] it's left up to the movie goer to guess and there are a few loose ends not tied up but if they ever come out with a directors cut of the movie, all will be explained.    Alot of cool stuff was left out so they had to cut and paste to try an make the scenes make sense =/

GBKaftrJaa	I like Hurley best because he provides all the humor in an otherwise very tense and suspenseful show.  I feel sorry for him being plagued with mental illness.  And I like him seeing all the ghosts.  And remember he saw someone when he looked into Jacob's cabin when he was lost in the woods alone. And besides John and Ben he's the only one who can find Jacob's cabin it seems.    I also love seeing Richard Alpert always showing up the same age.  I just laugh out loud every time we see him.  And he's calm and steady.  And it will be interesting to find out more about him and his connection to Jacob.  There's going to be a lot to his story line I'm sure.    I love seeing how caring Desmond is and his need to help people. Like when he tried to save Charlie over and over again and now as he tries to find Daniel's mom.  I like that he travels through time naturally. That also makes his character line very deep.|`|ibiO4VEQaa	I think there are two ways to like a character: entertainment whose the most fun to watch (Ben) level and personal level which one do you like most as a person. (Claire)    Ben seems to be one of the most complex characters (plus the actors great!) He's been the tortured defenceless guy, the cold hearted psycho, the 12 year old obsessing over Juliet, the fighter, the broken "dad" and the "guy you need or your hopeless" all in one. Plus it's fun to watch him because your like "OK how is he going to get outta this one?"    Claire because she is the mother of the baby you kind of feel sorry for her having to raise him on the island. And she seems like the nicest person on the show, everyone else you would probably not want to meet off the island, the fugitive, the con man etc. She's not like Rabbit Girl Kate she did have a thing with Charlie but they never slept together and at least when she ended things with him she had a real reason. And the fact she's related to Jack, the mystery of if she's dead or not and the fact she won't be seen until Season 6 add to the intrigue of her.    Plus she's hot! *drool* :)|`|U8aXa8xEaa	Sayid --  He is always searching for peace, yet can't ever seem to achieve it.  I keep routing for him.  I hope by the series finale, he lives AND finally has peace in his life.  (Having him get a good woman that doesn't die 5 minutes later would be nice too.  lol)    But I also love Hurley, he is so adorable!  (I loved it when he said to Sayid  "You should eat more comfort food.  Maybe then you wouldn't have to shoot people so much."  lol)    I love to hate Ben.  But surprisingly, Juliet is starting to grow on me.  I love the way she delivers some of her deadpan lines.  Like when Sawyer asked her   "So, you scr3wing Jack yet?" and she answered "No, are you?"  lol|`|jMLBoMi4aa	My favorite was Charlie.|`|4JQUUrX1aa	vincent is my favorite.. but he gets no play :( sigh..  woof woof!    ok seriously.. used to be hurley till he became a spaz.. now its sawyer because hes by far the funniest one of the bunch... and hes not as egotistical as jack.|`|y8p5GHaZaa	Definitely Sayid.  He can stay calm (unlike Jack) but can also kick ***.  He is smarter than everyone else on the island.  I think he backstory is really interesting too.

Y1aAGPURaa	LOL!!!!!!   Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  A mother passing by her son's bedroom was astonished to see that his bed was nicely made and everything was picked up. Then she saw an envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow that was addressed to 'Mom' . With the worst premonition, she opened the envelope with trembling hands and read the letter.<br>  <br>  Dear Mom,<br>  It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with you and Dad.<br>  I have been finding real passion with Stacy and she is so nice. But I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing, tattoos, tight motorcycle clothes and the fact that she is much older than I am. But it's not only the passion...... Mom she's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.<br>  Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people that live nearby for cocaine and ecstasy.  In the meantime, we will pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so Stacy can get better. She deserves it. Don't worry Mom.  I'm 15 and I know how to take care of myself.  Someday I'm sure that we will be back to visit so that you can get to know your grandchildren.<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Your son, Jonathan <br>  <br>  P. S. Mom, none of the above is true.  I'm over at Tommy's house.  I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the report card that's in my center desk drawer. <br>  I love you.<br>  <br>  Call me when it's safe to come home|`|aZXnW6AUaa	Yes thats a very funny joke.|`|9e3u1iyPaa	that wuz realy funny|`|PRDZmeiEaa	Ha Ha funny!!

O2hmjOPyaa	It has been a LONG time since I've seen/read this series, so I may not be completely correct on this answer, but...<br>  <br>  I believe the morphing technology was exactly that, technology. The Andolites didn't possess a special ability to change into different creatures, they created a technology that allowed them to gain that ability. If Visser 3 was never exposed to the "cube" technology (which I think he wasn't, since his body was taken over by a Yeerk before it was created) he would have never gained the ability to morph into different animals.

(does that make sense? w.e) If there is something that really interests you, then of course you'll divert your full and undivided attention to it, and complete it. But if there is something that you have to accomplish, in which you dont find particularily captivating to you, yet you still have to do it, you'll find that you wont be able to muster the will do to so. As much as you are determined to accomplish this task in the beginning, and promise yourself that you will follow through with it; chances are that any persistance and determination in you will gradually diminish over time, until you just want to give up, and leave it alone. It happens all the time. People are always making promises to themselves, saying they'll change this, or they'll do that. They promise themselves that they will follow through with it no matter what. Yet in the end, most of the time, it doesnt matter what they say to themselves. They can be as determined as they want in the beginning; but if it isnt something that they REALLY, REALLY, REALLY want to do, or if it isnt something that they find terribly captivating, then .. well good luck with that. Lets use me as an example. The other day, i was having troubles beating the CoD:W@W campaign. It's dead hard, especially on the hardended difficulty. However, i love the game, and i found it to be quite enticing, and i REALLY wanted to finish it still, no matter how hard. It was still good fun. So i persisted, and after several attempts, i did beat it. Thats what i mean. LOL. K sorry, maybe that isnt the best example. Ehhh, i unno how to answer your question really... sorryy.

8F0zhsRXaa	you can get a good quality microphone for cheap it doesnt have to cost hundreds of bucks, then just look for a free or cheap recording software for your computer. if you have a mac then Garageband is the best bet for recording, and eventually you can move up to Logic Express|`|HobZedDnaa	You might need something like an audio interface that can hook into your computer. They usually come with recording/ mixing software and about two inputs for mics. Something by m-audio or lexicon or line6. Some of these start at about 50 and go way way up in price. or a four track recorder, some of these have sd memory so you can put it right on your computer but these start at 100 and can go way into the thousands too. There are too many to name.

e7KoyoWsaa	your answer is yes, your OKAY.  There are certainly parts your having loads of trouble with.  Your getting tired and your voice is getting strained.  If you wanted to lay down the vocal tracks to a song, it would require a lot of re-recordings... but that's how you get better.  I wouldn't recommend this song though.<br>  Your okay, but I wouldn't call you a good singer.  Sing in the shower, go to kereoke, sing a song for your boyfriend - but don't audition for American idol.<br>  you sound better than i think i sound.|`|WXcbE2H1aa	your voice is quite strong but that's not the right song for you. listen to a range of music and sing songs that you don't necessarily listen to.|`|agf7Jq76aa	*okay*<br>  <br>  Join this singing contest and see how you really stack up:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sensationalsinger.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sensationalsinger.com</a>|`|nucQYOf3aa	Im not sure on what ur voice sounds like because, I can't get to youtube because, my school is blocked it...Stupid ****** teachers anyway...Im sure u have a good voice..!|`|GQRs83Haaa	That was incredibly excruciating...

aihogb26aa	Anoop is almost a lock for the wild card show in 2 weeks. An Idol producer said that they are almost definitely inviting back the singers who come in the 4th place positions in each of the 3 rounds. They also said that they will NOT just be choosing people from the Top 36 (although he WAS in the top 36, but I think jamar Rogers will be brought back as well and he was not).|`|0TGpz08paa	He was such a good singer. But I don't think he will be back. Because next week is The Wild Card show and they're taking people from the top 36..And unfortunately Anoop did not make it to the top 36.

There is long fine history of it, including the name "rock and roll" itself. A favorite of mine from big joe turner, back in 1954, "shake rattle and roll":<br>  "like a one eyed cat peeking in a sea food store, I can look at you till you aint no child no more"<br>  <br>  or how about this dirty little blues number from 1935:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr6xjWEYGSs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr6xjWEYG...</a><br>  just about makes me snicker like a 13 year old.<br>  <br>  or how about chuck berry's "my ding a ling"<br>  <br>  Edit: Quick note on "Jim Morrison being dirtier than the 60s were ready for"- Back Door Man was a cover of a 1950s song made famous by Howlin' Wolf.|`|dyV9MPhDaa	Back Door Man by The Doors<br>  <br>  In the 60's it meant 'going out the back door as the old man was coming in the front'.<br>  Now today it is well known that Jim Morrison meant something else entirely........now the whole song is dirty.

At least one 1000-meter rifle range capable of accommodating 200 shooters at a time.  Universal wireless Internet access.  At least one good hospital with a trauma center. I'll probably think of more stuff later.  What laws would I have?  Everybody must be armed.  The income tax shall not exceed five percent.  No lawsuits.

uVo5rGJvaa	Sure do!!!  Go crazy!|`|C6ee83Jbaa	depends on the story behind them.<br>  my boyfriend has a scar, and the incident of how he got it happened right before we got together so i think that scar is cute:) even if it hurt him how he got it.|`|GmWIDDRQaa	depends on how they got there.|`|E5rhAaLGaa	Hmm, depends where, as long as it doesnt ruin his face!|`|mzkfSwLwaa	yUp 85% of them|`|547Ln6rNaa	Yeah if it's a good story. <br>  <br>  If you have a scar with a rubbish story ("fell of my brothers bike when I was 10"), make one up! If you marry her, she'll forgive you and think it was cute that you lied to be more interesting.|`|xggSASTwaa	no not really, do you like girls with scars? I mean i don't dislike someone because they have a scar. Why do you ask such a strange question?|`|NB5Dr7Nzaa	Kinda.  I think we like to know the manly stories behind scars.|`|9YlQ5HEhaa	God no. Ew.|`|FkXt4XLvaa	It depends on where it is, how it looks, and why it's there.<br>  <br>  If the guy was just being a complete idiot and acting out, showing off to his friends or was drunk when he got it, then it's probably not going to be that cool because the story is not going to be all that great. Although the story may be funny, it's not necessarily going to make us attracted to you.<br>  <br>  If it's a scar from an accident or a surgery, something that could have taken his life or in some way affected him deeply and changed who he is for the better, then it has a good story as well and most girls will like that aspect of it.<br>  <br>  It's not the scar. It's the story that goes along with the scar(s) that girls like.<br>  <br>  I know a guy who was in a VERY bad car accident several years ago. His back was broken - although he can walk still, thankfully - and he's got the scars (and some pain still) to show for it. But he is an amazing man, always has been and he learned so much from this and frankly, as much as this makes me blush...all I want to do is run my hands over the scars and tell him how gorgeous he is and how much I want to be with him. He has a girlfriend so that's out of the question but his scars don't bother me. <br>  <br>  If anything, if there's a decent enough reason for them, they show us how strong and resilient you really are.|`|YyiESOpFaa	yeah, it depends....if it's one down the arm and isn't all bumpy and stuff, that might be hot! or like a scar that orlando bloom had in the 3rd pirate movie....now that was SEXY:) lol|`|XlhBBZPxaa	only if you have a REALLY good story behind it otherwise NO|`|8Ypkfr7jaa	I dont....... but I find myself thinking guys who have scars on eyebrows are cute hehe|`|dprURFLxaa	No.  They were lying to make you feel better. ★|`|Q8yTJWTXaa	depends|`|lfDDdq4Gaa	eww yuck.. lOl. but i dO like briefs.. hahaha.|`|IM6UsVC2aa	tats of scars
B1O0qpdvaa	Baffling. I think it's a little strange that you and your rents have a secret handshake. Why do you? Why is it a secret? What are you guys hiding or rather what are you guys hiding from? Bizarre. <br>  <br>  Do you and your parents practice the handshake to gain access to back and/or side doors at establishments? Do you use the handshake so you can identify each other if you had blindfolds on?<br>  <br>  What is the significance of the secret handshake?<br>  Inquiring minds what to know.|`|u6vP1IdVaa	I like the disappearing hand myself|`|v3DlrlPTaa	kinda creepy and you will live with your parent for awhile|`|63a7abd045cc49ddeb43e136e6b00d67aa	I think it's sweet|`|EPaYoJaiaa	no, actually that's kinda cool! I wish I had that great of a relationship with my parents, but if I ever suggested that they'd give me a 'an alien came and replaced my daughter look' so kudos to you!|`|m6jE5KVUaa	Nope, that is great, sounds like you have a good relationship with them! lots of people would love to have that with their parents!|`|0154e31673244b2bea94b54516ec675aaa	this only makes me have more questions about you|`|FAUPZeSxaa	depends on how old you are|`|j7l9gavRaa	no it's cute|`|OuMhera8aa	do they also have a secret club up in the tree house?|`|w68p19bNaa	Nah.

He was probably one of the best boyfriends I've had.|`|AA10531094	Yes|`|JV0i77uiaa	No, he is dead, so I'm in love with the dead body. lol|`|22621f93a7534ed2f1a71acf45cf11a4aa	yes =)...it takes awhile but it'll go away and youll find someone better for u and be happy...trust me...my ex broke up with me and i loved him and i was heartbroken for like months but i realized that if you truly love someone, you want the to be happy and want the best for them whether it includes u or not. if my ex doesnt want to be with me then so be it. as long as he's happy then its ok. dont worry.  youll get over your ex.=)|`|qsuYKa3naa	Loving physically maybe but I think ones first love still will be somewhere hidden in the memories of past loves|`|Tj2xROpwaa	i probably never will stop loving him.|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	yes|`|P1oLYKzGaa	never|`|PXarLma8aa	tear.... sort of!|`|AA10742567	yes|`|T3DLgs6Vaa	Yes, they become a distant memory.|`|AA11669456	eventually, but then it goes from being love to respect or hate, depending on how long ago the relationship ended and how it ended.|`|FYvCR8mvaa	yes, I think so (if you're not still together) but I think we never get over wondering "what if".|`|hPgRvmTUaa	no|`|DFbjL5Q5aa	Stopped.|`|7ADHptSaaa	i have!|`|t7XnGkSOaa	I hope|`|ArDjAl4Raa	Ugh this question makes me depressed. I don't even know if I was in love with my first boyfriend, but I miss him. This sucks! I don't even know if i have loved him or if i still do! if i do, maybe that's why i am torn apart to not be with him. or maybe i'm just lonely?|`|Dj78kyxfaa	I don't know, its hard to say. I wouldn't want to ever go back to that person, I don't miss the bad times, but I still feel love for her and wish nothing bad on her.    So, you'll still love that person, but you'll no longer be in love with that person. You move on and end up falling in love with somebody else. That may be a long term love which is much better and stronger.|`|xbR3yMKsaa	No  you never stop.  40 years ago I dated a guy for 4 years and  everytime we see each other the excitement and love still shines.  it will always be there. There are different levels of love.  You love  your parents a different way than you love your spouse. dif for children  Different for God. As long as you love you are a great person  to give then receive.|`|Maw87YWdaa	yes I didnt though until I met my husband|`|oVcIsVFlaa	depending on the situation you do.  but I think that you always try to focus on the happy moments of the relationship.   you may stop loving your first love but you will never forget your first love.    and sex does not replace your first love.|`|Ob7xNdAhaa	I sure hope so.|`|9q7UPZIfaa	Hell Yes!!!  Time cures all. Time heals all.  Time Mends , so yes with Time.|`|MvwMxQL3aa	romantically perhaps...but we are still good friends...  we text and e-mail frequently and talk on the phone every once in a while...|`|7fXpLlhBaa	No, and I'm still with him ;-)|`|eOkohAMXaa	i hope so... its been killing me for months...|`|elECfJ52aa	yup
5EfJu34taa	who on earth would like to do that???|`|ZTVmUb4Laa	No...|`|G3qFUugvaa	its the stupid thing to do|`|uymZEWp6aa	never i dont wanna to be called a dumb who's just ridiculus|`|iMakU3RHaa	Interesting, but no.I have other things to do.
YW74O9aNaa	No... <br>  World peace is unrealistic because there's so much greed, hatred in the world. <br>  But that has nothing to do with how i should behave with my close ones.<br>  I strive for peace and happines in "my world" :)|`|j7l9gavRaa	no, i am just mean cuz i want to be i don't have to justify it|`|Q8yTJWTXaa	no<br>  thats just an excuse to be mean|`|63a7abd045cc49ddeb43e136e6b00d67aa	No, because change starts with us. We can cause a ripple effect by being kind to just one person, then hopefully that person will be kind to another, and so on.|`|YW1DXceqaa	good job spamming P&S lmao

84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Pisces + Pisces    Since you're birds of a feather, or rather humans of a zodiac sign, you have the potential to grow closer than most couples. Just remember that when you get involved with a Pisces, you get involved with a rescuer, a victim, a mystic and an idealist. If you can give each other help, health, fantasy and art, you have a better chance of getting each other's love and affection.    Pisces and Pisces spend a great deal of time in the world of feelings emotions and intuitions. Each one of you experiences life as an ebb and flow of emotional tides and currents. Neither one of you deals with people so much by their outward appearance as by their inner states. Each one of you has a degree of psychic power. You can cultivate a mutual appreciation of music and art.    TIP Work on your non-verbal communication together.    Learn to dance together. Share a ride on a water bed. Intangibles play a great role in your life together. To share greater success, develop a greater understanding of the interconnectedness and interdependence of all forms of life. In other words, develop your empathy, compassion and emotional rapport.    There are at least two sides to each of your personalties. One is more kind, loving, tolerant and long-suffering than most people. The other can be biting. Neither one of you don't want to hurt people, unless you are feeling righteous and need to punish the guilty.    It's fair to say that you're both imaginative, a dreamer, and even mystical. You each certainly seem to absorb and drink in your surroundings more than most people. You both have mood swings and can benefit from live music and dance. Together you can break the chains of fate and destiny. More than most people, you are both a product of beliefs as much as disbeliefs. As Henry Ford said, "Whether you think you can or you can't, you are right."|`|gEnWVe76aa	well, actually Aquarians are actually the aloof ones, but Pisces do have their moments  I personally haven't been attracted to any Pisces, but that's just me  But I still think they can work very well because Pisces have the abilities to sense one anothers' emotions|`|9B6Om8oDaa	Suggest you should get a full horoscope check and not go by just sun sign. That will explain how compatible you are. If you want to know more, you can visit a website that I have liked on the subject, http://www.decisioncare.org/marriage/5-m...   At   http://www.decisioncare.org/vedic-astrol...   http://www.decisioncare.org/   Vedic astrology    http://www.decisioncare.org/compatibilit...|`|qUFwZUzdaa	Well if both pisces work together they can make it work. Some pisces are stronger then others. If there is one strong pisces that pisces can make the other strong to ive had this happen. I have 3 pisces friends which are males. If u can make it work its great. But see the thing is we are so alike. And we know how to read each others minds very well. That's a downfall for the pisces & pisces relationship. And another thing to with 2 pisces u have to make sure u don't push each others patience. And sexually 2 pisces together its bomb azz! When 2 pisces get together its an extreme connection. Its very spiritual to. Communication is very great between the 2 of them to. If u have any other questions please feel free to message me or whatever.

kPWGVeWhaa	when I was like 7 I wrote a letter to the olsen twins.  <br>  <br>  got an autograph back and everything.  real too.  <br>  <br>  then I joined the "fan club"  and got a bunch a crap that was crap. <br>  <br>  but that was 18 years ago.|`|NB5Dr7Nzaa	When I was little I wrote a letter to Johnathan Pryce after seeing him in Miss Siagon on Broadway.  (He is also in movies; Govenor Swann in the Pirates movies, Fargo, Stigmata)  He wrote me back a hand written letter.  I thought it was so cool.<br>  I got drunk one night a few years ago and wrote a letter to David Grohl thanking him for his music and for being awesome.  I never sent it.|`|NpqAbZqpaa	No letters, but I had Martin Short as a big brother growing up, so I have his cell phone #|`|4YnoykD2aa	Back in the 80s, I wrote to the lead singer of Men Without Hats.

When I went up to buy his cd I got to say hi. I felt so nervous and stupid. I guess that's because I'm such a big fan. If I could I'd bring him home and make him read everything he's written. I love his work.|`|5XV1ZFyqaa	Yes I wrote a letter to some some politicians and to their supervisor.  I would not call them celebrities, they are a little above that.  Writing letters to people you do not know will land you in court or at the very least cost you the price of a stamp.|`|hGx4l2mAaa	yes, to Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter)<br>  I wasnt expecting anything , but i did get a personally signed poster of him along with a news letter!!!! yippiee|`|7wL3RMN9aa	Not lately.

Te0IkxuIaa	well since the us is very big i can only tell you what most of me and my friends think the best anime in the U.S is well currently death note,naruto,pokemon. are like the top but other anime shows are  code geass, sorta old.... inuyasha.sailor moon used to be a popular one  hmmm what else princess tutu,the wallflower,afro samurai rossario vampire,shugo chara is also a popular one but its only on english subs and not airing in the us like on tv but you can watch it on youtube...,  if you want to mor eplease email me okay  and yes silly anime is japanese and alwayys will be for here in the us we make something called cartoons like southpark,family guy the simpsons but anyways anime is 1000000000 times better since those shows are stupid in my own point of veiw    Itte kimasu|`|MfqHFQwbaa	There are alot of popular anime in the US but the biggest would have to be Naruto and yes it is Japanese anime. Although now there are many dubbed episodes of it.   Naruto is the anime that mostly started people's fandom. When it came over, San Fransico comic con had a huge visitor increase!   It was my first anime too. I really recommend it.|`|8a65aa558e9ad4329fd6cecf8635eb04aa	Spirited Away, originally from Japan, dubbed into English, a major hit.    an American cartoon that looks anime-like is Xiaolin Showdown. It was aired on Kids WB back in 2003 and it's really good. it's created by Chinese-American, Christy Hui.|`|3WCXGRaGaa	Anime is from Japan...  dummy, if it was made in America it would be call Cartoons...    and probably most popular is death note right now, and anythign elso tahts on t.v. stations and alot of people know about, and there are alot of picz of it...|`|HjiwX4HMaa	probably pokemon,yu-gi-oh,or like DBZ.|`|10bde24c95fa630a79d9c75bd022b054aa	This is a tough call, since it is kinda hard to get significant figures to back up any suggestion. A number of animes only air at night, considering the U.S. censors fear of anything violent.    But probably the three most popular in the U.S. have been Naruto, Dragonball Z, and Pokemon. Naruto is probably the most popular of the three at the moment. Dragonball Z's fanbase has always been huge and will probably continue to be. And Pokemon, while aimed at a younger audience, has a fairly good sized following in an older audience.    Of course, there are also other popular animes like Bleach, Full Metal Alchemist...but most of these shows have been relagated to viewer's blocks like Adult Swim because of their violence, therefore keeping them away from an even larger audience.
SkFgDxpEaa	Seriously i really hate how ppl are treating her. as if there aren't any of them in the same situation. they keep dissing her for having kids, and so many, when she can't financially support them. but how many 14/15 girls out there with no jobs, and have kids. but that ain't wrong for most ppl, i guess.<br>  <br>  well yes i think she would get more coverage from the media if she was a celeb, but i think that what ever she is getting is good, cuz then she can use it to support her kids better.<br>  <br>  and the way ppl have been treating her is just so unfair.|`|403a76a591bc07b10b1a689c061b508daa	It would be so much better because atleast they could afford eight kids. i think it would be a big deal at first then after a while you would not hear much about it. the reason why we are hearing so much about the octomom is because she has 14 kids which she cannot afford to take care of by herself.|`|c573f7ac6e5d1bec7e5fc59b2cf6d1adaa	I don't believe that it would be the same for someone who has money.

We are meant to think at first that someone is walking into a tavern, where something funny will then happen.<br>  <br>  However, in this case, when we hear the second line, we realize that a man actually bumped into a bar, like a steel beam or a protrusion in his path.<br>  <br>  The joke sets up an expectation, and then informs us that we've made a hasty assumption, based on previous jokes we've heard.  So our expectation has to change.<br>  <br>  We've been tricked by the joke itself, so our natural reaction is to laugh at our own confusion.|`|0ox8VKwKaa	Ask me if I am a truck driver?

Y1aAGPURaa	A six-year-old goes to the hospital with his grandma to visit his grandpa. When they get to the hospital, he runs ahead of his grandma and bursts into his grandpa's room. <br>  <br>  "Grandpa, Grandpa!" he says excitedly, "As soon as Grandma comes into the room, make a noise like a frog!" <br>  <br>  "What?" said his grandpa.<br>  <br>  "Make a noise like a frog because Grandma said that as soon as you croak, we're going to Disneyland!!!"<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  A young doctor was just setting up his first office. <br>  <br>  His secretary told him there was a man to see him. The doctor wanted to make the man think that he was successful and very busy. So he told his secretary to show the man in and at that moment he picked up his phone and pretended to be having a conversation with a patient. <br>  <br>  The man waited patiently until the "conversation" was completed.<br>  <br>  Once he hung up, the doctor asked, "Can I help you?"<br>  <br>  To which the man replied "No, I'm just here to connect your telephone."<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  A city kid went to his grandpa's farm for the weekend. He tagged along as Pa did what had to be done around the place, taking it all in.<br>  <br>  Then Grandpa came across a cow having trouble calving. He didn't know how the whole process would be taken in by the six-year-old, but had no option but to get on with the job of assisting the birth.<br>  <br>  When the calf had been 'pulled' and the cow was happily cleaning it up, Pa asked the boy if he had any questions about what he had just seen.<br>  <br>  At first the kid seemed overwhelmed by the experience, but finally asked, "Just how fast was that calf going when it hit the cow's behind?"|`|OUkiotELaa	im abt 2 pierce my nail. wish me luck!|`|2a9jRZGRaa	Owner of a boat<br>  <br>  There were two twins, Joe and John. Joe was the owner of a old dilapidated boat. It just so happened that John's wife died the same day Joe's boat sank. A few days later a kindly old woman saw Joe, and mistaking him for John. Said "I'm sorry to hear about your loss. You must feel terrible" <br>  <br>  Joe, thinking she was talking about his boat, said "Fact is, I'm sort of glad to get rid of her. She was a rotten old thing from the beginning. Her bottom was all shriveled up and she smelled like an old dead fish. She was always losing her water, she had a bad crack in the back and a pretty big hole in the front, too. Every time I used her the hole got bigger and she leaked like crazy. I guess what finished her off was when I rented her to those four guys looking for a good time for the weekend. I warned them that she wasn't very good, but they wanted to use her anyhow and were willing to pay. The fools all tried to get in her at the same time and split her right down the middle." <br>  <br>  The old woman fainted..<br>  <br>  <br>  sorry it maybe longer than you want I think it's funny|`|KXHM5BgWaa	“Doctor, won’t you please kiss me,” says the patient.<br>  <br>  “No. You’re a very beautiful woman, but it’s against my code of ethics,” replies her doctor.<br>  <br>  “Please, just one kiss,” she pleads.<br>  <br>  “Sorry,” says the doctor. “It’s totally out of the question.

rXl4VLMJaa	It all depends on birth chart and also see how you feel around him not just his sun sign. Theres more to a person than the fact that they are a libra or pisces or aries etc....    From personal experience:     I am a fellow pisces girl and dated a libra guy and he cheated on me, fairly quickly. Once he had the space he did what he could to find some booty. I have had bad experiences with a majority of libras before.     I try to give the benefit of the doubt though...But still notice how you get along or not and you will see. Im water and i like a fire sign and we get along perfectly, hes my prom date! lol.     im a fan of astrology too but you cant take it seriously because every person is different from their signs and charts and what not.......it happens im not saying astrology is wrong but take it with a grain of salt.    Go with the flow and good luck! you two will hit it off just begin by saying something or "accidentally" nudging into him or just do something to get his attention...Libras are shy too!|`|Ow3O7h4caa	Actually this can work even for a long term relationship with a romantic start I may add. Libra has an intellectual approach to the relationship and may annoy her because Pisces like to drift without a care in the world sometimes. Sexually, this is an irrisistable match.    This is amatch where equilibrium is the most difficult to obtain because trying to balance a Pisces to reach a certain point of stability and harmony is quite difficult. Pisces takes life too seriously for Libra but with a little compromise and other stabilizing aspects, this relationship can go a long way.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Libra + Pisces    Just remember that when you're involved with a Libra, you're involved with a peacemaker, a diplomat, a balancer and a glamor puss. When you get involved with a Pisces, you get involved with a rescuer, a victim, a mystic and an idealist.    If you can give a Libra class, style, fairness and equality then you have a better chance of getting their love and affection. If you can give a Pisces help, health, fantasy and art, you have a better chance of getting their love and affection.    Libra is a nice person and tends to be a bit more cultured and "better" than others. Usually, Libra is also diplomatic enough to keep your superiority complexes in check. The more that Libra becomes fair-minded, impartial and unprejudiced, the happier Libra becomes. Libra has the potential for much social intercourse and favorable public contact. To really thrive, Libra needs to be part of a loving, committed "marriage."    All things being equal, Libra prefers civil conversation. Libra usually does not find reason for raised voices or crude language at inappropriate times. Embarrassment can be an issue for Libra. Libra likes to ask for advice, but does not like to be told what to do. Libra needs a cushy job in a swanky environment.    There are at least two sides to Pisces's personality. One is more kind, loving, tolerant and long-suffering than most people. The other can be biting. Pisces, you don't want to hurt people, unless you are feeling righteous and need to punish the guilty.    It's fair to say that Pisces is imaginative, a dreamer, and even mystical. Pisces certainly seems to absorb and drink in surroundings more than most people. Pisces has mood swings and can benefit from live music and dance. Pisces can break the chains of fate and destiny. More than most people, Pisces is a product of beliefs as much as disbeliefs. As Henry Ford said Pisces, "Whether you think you can or you can't, you are right."    In the relationship between Libra and Pisces adjustment is key. You both need to give more than you get. This association requires extra sensitivity. At first, each may be somewhat irritated about each other. In time, with work, the very thing that caused the irritation may lead to personal fulfillment. You can't force growth in this alliance- go along with the changes. To beat the odds, change your routines.|`|zg6sgA3faa	I believe it can be a long term relationship. I had a lira guy before and he was great just had bad timing in my life. I wasn't ready to settle down. But I do wish you the best in your future relationship.|`|BAjc1fZNaa	When Libra and Pisces come together in a love affair, theirs is a congenial and even-tempered romance. These two Signs are very compatible, making for a truly smooth-sailing love affair. Both Signs are attuned to life's aesthetic side, but they also have much to offer one another: When Pisces gets lost in a fantasy, Libra can apply that Libran proclivity for balance to help get Pisces back on track, and Pisces can return the favor by helping Libra see the beauty in love and empathy. This is an honest partnership that values truth and harmony in itself and in the world.     Libra and Pisces make great friends as well as lovers. They understand one another: Both can be indecisive and tend to work in multiple directions at once. Problems between these two are rare, but Libra can at times be too mentally manipulating for Pisces. Sometimes they can also stop mid-action due to both of their indecisive natures; if these two work on a project together -- either their love relationship or something else -- it can be difficult to get it to move forward. If these two do have an argument, they do tend to forgive and forget quickly: Libra abhors conflict and will do almost anything to avoid it, and Pisces possesses great empathy and can forgive out of understanding for their partner's position.     Libra is ruled by Venus (Love) and Pisces is ruled by Jupiter (Luck) and Neptune (Illusions). These Signs are quite compatible due to the feminine energies of Venus and Neptune working in tandem. Under Jupiter and Neptune's rule, Pisces is intensely meditative, philosophical and internal. Under Venus's influence, Libra is in love with love. Libra is the Sign of Partnership and always is more comfortable when in an intimate love affair.     Libra is an Air Sign and Pisces is a Water Sign. These two Signs together combine their heads and their hearts to solve all problems -- a winning combination. The best decisions are made with both the emotions and the intellect; this relationship tends to be extremely flexible and progressive. When problems occur, however, the communication breaks down between Libra and Pisces. Libra, who can at times be mentally manipulative, may give Pisces "the silent treatment." In this partnership there's always an undercurrent of friction but neither partner will ever truly be the leader. Although they may disagree often, their differences of opinion don't last long. Their only real trouble may result from their tendency to slow down to the point of stopping when they get together.     Libra is a Cardinal Sign and Pisces is a Mutable Sign. Libra comes up with new ideas and starts new projects and Pisces is happy to go along with them, taking any role "assigned" them. If these two take on a project other than their love relationship, they will work well together; both are outwardly modest, and Libra likes a bit of recognition while Pisces doesn't mind the passenger's seat. Also, if Libra generates a new idea but then suddenly loses interest (as sometimes happens), Pisces doesn't mind switching directions as well.     What's the best aspect of a Libra-Pisces relationship? Their mutual interest in helping individuals and the world around them. They are well-matched in their enthusiasm, energy and desire for a sincere relationship.    By Astrology.com|`|9B6Om8oDaa	Suggest you should get a full horoscope check and not go by just sun sign.

God works in mysterious ways.<br>  <br>  After they crawl out of their cars, the woman says, “So you‘re a man. That‘s interesting. I‘m a woman. Wow, just look at our cars! There‘s nothing left, but we‘re unhurt. This must be a sign from God that we should meet and be friends and live together in peace for the rest of our days“.<br>  <br>  Flattered, the man replies, “Oh yes, I agree with you completely, this must be a sign from God!“<br>  <br>  The woman continues, “And look at this, here‘s another miracle. My car is completely demolished but this bottle of wine didn‘t break. Surely God wants us to drink this wine and celebrate our good fortune.“ Then she hands the bottle to the man.<br>  <br>  The man nods his head in agreement, opens it and drinks half the bottle and then hands it back to the woman. The woman takes the bottle and immediately puts the cap back on, and hands it back to the man.<br>  <br>  The man asks, “Aren‘t you having any?“<br>  <br>  The woman replies, “No. I think I‘ll just wait for the police.... “<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>   A man and  his wife walked into a dentist's office.

We have a 10:00 AM tee time at the best golf course in town and it's 9:30 already. I  don't have time to wait for the anesthetic to work!'    <br>   <br>  The dentist thought to himself, 'My goodness, this is surely a very brave man asking to have his tooth pulled  without using anything to kill the pain.'  So the dentist asks him, 'Which tooth is it sir?<br>      <br>  The man turned to his wife and said, 'Open your mouth honey, and show him.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  A group of children were trying very hard to become accustomed to Nursery.

I either maul you to death or we have rough sex." <br>  <br>  Frank decided to bend over. Even though he felt sore for two weeks, Frank soon recovered and vowed revenge. He headed out on another trip where he found the black bear and shot it. <br>  <br>  There was another tap on his shoulder. <br>  <br>  This time a huge grizzly bear stood right next to him. The grizzly says: "That was a huge mistake, Frank. You've got two choices. Either I maul you to death or we have REALLY rough sex." <br>  <br>  Again, Frank thought it was better to comply. Although he survived, it would take several months before Frank finally recovered. Outraged he headed back to the woods, managed to track down the grizzly and shot it. <br>  <br>  He felt sweet revenge, but then there was a tap on his shoulder.

On the Mischief Night, eve of Halloween, she was murdered in the backyard of her house and her murder remained unsolved. Twenty-two years later, the writer Mark Fuhrman, who is a former LA detective that has fallen in disgrace for perjury in O.J. Simpson trial and moved to Idaho, decides to investigate the case with his partner Stephen Weeks with the purpose of writing a book. The locals squirm and do not welcome them, but with the support of the retired detective Steve Carroll that was in charge of the investigation in the 70's, they discover the criminal and a net of power and money to cover the murder    It took me forever to find it, I remembered what movie you were talking about but I coulndt for the life of me remember the title, but I finnaly found it.

ae2de9ccef4109177673c61d99023de7aa	If you have venus or mars in pisces (i have both and am an aquarius) then you will probably get on quite well with the pisces.<br>  <br>  As for the geminis, I have a love-hate thing with them. The geminis I get along with I get along with incredibly well, but I meet a lot of gemini's that i clash with. <br>  <br>  If you and the pisces are feelin it, then run with it.  if you want to explore more try going to www.astro.com and find the free natal chart feature and then check you and your pisces' mercury,venus,mars,moon etc. You will likely find something there that indicates a good match. For fun, check your ex's info also and see if there isn't something there that could be the reason it didn't work out.<br>  <br>  My venus/mars in pisces makes some geminis seem really crass and insensitive, which i have learned not to let bother me on a personal level, but it definitely doesn't warm me up to them.|`|62LBaLqiaa	you need to get a book... like its one called Love Signs by Linda Goodman i think. it has all the answers. anyway usually aqua and gemini are great together but of course people are still people regardless and things dont always work. pisces and aquarius... lmao... you are going to want too much freedom and pisces is too damn sensitive... not gonna work!!! but then again it might... because like i said we are still just people|`|ZS38T8M7aa	I'm a pisces and I personally love my aquarius friends, but I don't think I would ever date an aquarius.

Going off sun signs alone Pisces and Aquarius isn't a good match. But you have to consider the whole chart to see compatibility.

b48oRznUaa	slam dancing preceded moshing, it was started by punks and skins in the 70s and early 80s. moshing was the evolution of slam dancing when thrash and cross over metal came along. then moshing became more mainstream with Nirvana with "Teen Spirit."<br>  <br>  A precursor to moshing, called "acookie", can be traced back to 1970s punk rock shows in the form of "the pogo" and was later developed into moshing by the hardcore punk subculture of the early 80s. While many use the terms slamdancing and moshing interchangeably, distinctions can be made in that slamdancing is typically more frantic, with body movements such as arm-swinging, while moshing is slower and more exaggerated|`|3jFm0rWdaa	About 10 years!

a7wao0lGaa	When Taurus and Capricorn come together in a love match, it's a practical, sensible partnership. These two Signs share a certain down-to-earth logic and interest in efficiency. Taurus is not interested in risking more than is necessary in terms of emotional connection and involvement, and Capricorn is similarly disinterested in risk, but more in terms of money and career. Capricorn's career is one of the great focuses of their lives; they're interested in scaling the heights and tend to set very high standards for themselves to adhere to. Taurus has high standards as well, but regarding love, relationships and possessions. <br>  These two Signs admire one another's dedication and strength, but, while they have this in common as well as a dependable, realistic, somewhat conservative approach to life (Capricorn more than Taurus), a love relationship between them can go stale fast. The problem? They're actually rather different at their cores. Taurus may begin to find Capricorn too conservative and restrictive; Capricorn may start to think Taurus is too lazy and doesn't care enough about career and status. If Taurus can encourage Capricorn to relax a little and appreciate the fruits of labor, and if Capricorn can help motivate Taurus to achieve goals and make dreams a reality, their union can be smooth, happy and long-lasting.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Without looking at your Mars and Venus signs, it's hard to say, but it sounds like you're describing typical Capricorn/Taurus in a nutshell.<br>  <br>  It's a good match, but if neither of you are big talkers you'll either have to agree to work on it together, or just accept that your relationship is a place to be quiet.<br>  <br>  The biggest problem the two of you would have would be if you wanted conflicting things.

biaZBhVkaa	Pluto in 11th House      *You may have a deep aversion to groups, associations, clubs, or organizations of any kind. Any such group you become involved in is likely to be either for intense personal growth, change, and healing, or centered around social change and revising society in some manner.     Circumstances impel you to change, ready or not. Sometimes you feel you must listen to a lot of other people's dreams and follow them. It is important to weigh their urgings against the inner voice of your own desire.    ^With Pluto in your 11th House, you may meet many of your power issues within the social sphere, particularly around special interest groups or when dealing with political processes. You're not the women who enjoys sitting on the sidelines if you're part of a group, especially if something could be done more effectively. If you have not developed a strong sense of your own ideals and beliefs you can fall under the influence of others who would usurp your power in order to boost their own. But once you've awakened to your own ideals, drives and directives, you can be a highly influential leader and instigator of social change. The extent of your efforts depends upon you and the choices you make for yourself.       Pluto in Leo     Pluto is the slowest moving planet and thus is recognized as exerting a generational influence as it moves through each zodiac sign.  With Pluto in Leo you're part of the generation that can experience radical changes in leisure time activities and its own children. On a personal level, those with Pluto in Leo tend to be proud, into hero worship and self centered in the sense of making their personal desires all important.    Jupiter in the Eleventh House  You could make a career out of group or community work, anything involving attempts to bring large-scale and humanitarian dreams and ideas to reality. Your ideals and inner vision keep what is best for everyone ever on your mind.    Jupiter in Cancer     Benefits come to you through family, property and a secure home life. You are highly sentimental and you may have a hard time releasing the past. You generally prefer to move with the flow of your peer group. Radical behavior is not your style and you'll only resort to it when all else has failed.

Plz4T3fzaa	that's an easy one - Scar    ...|`|tLI94qWNaa	I would have to say Jafar  from aladdin, he was so manipulative.|`|SRs6xcxPaa	i think maybe jafar from alladin|`|AA10520442	Cruella DeVil|`|ph4Htg02aa	Cruella De Ville|`|9NpXU7D2aa	this is a hard one there are so many great villians!  i like scar cuz he is so calm and cool about being evil.   i also love gaston cuz he acts so tough but in the end he begs for his life.    the only villian that has actually given me nightmares though is ursula. she knows how to touture you without touching a hair on your head. and when she becomes HUGE she is extremely scary especially when it came out when you were 3 years old!|`|DibFrwxlaa	Cruella De Ville|`|IDuA6JCxaa	Gaston.|`|1f47eba822d1938bfb09dfdafbfca889aa	hitler the hippo|`|R5I5Znlmaa	Frollo is a really good villain because he's the most realistic out of all the Disney villains. I also like Scar from Lion King and Yzma from Emperor's New Groove. Jeremy Irons is amazing as Scar and Yzma is pretty hilarious.|`|Mm51QadRaa	Maleficent|`|G3ScsO6haa	maleficent off sleeping beauty because she is the most biggest villain/boss in kingdom heart 1 and 2.    i also think hades as one of the biggest villains.|`|qDctmJTeaa	I think they are all very evil lol. I'm very obsessed with Disney even the villains lol.    Jafar is pretty creepy.  Ursula is so sneeky  Frollo is defiantly disgustingly evil  Malificent is scary   Scar killed Mufasa !  Captain Hook is creepy too lol  The Evil Queen ( Snow White) is the first so definatly deserves credit !    Clayton is horrible for wanting to kill the gorillas !    Cruella is HORRIBLE for wanting to kill adorable puppies.    They are all horrible    There's many many many more but I named a lot haha so I'll stop! ..|`|akcGfgdcaa	Scar was a great villain, evil yet witty. And you must be evil if you're willing to kill your own brother AND nephew!     Jafar was pretty cool too, especially his double act with Iago the parrot.|`|xLIK95Hmaa	Jafar fo sho!|`|yXD7Gfhmaa	Cruella and Scar
ZUlnZvaWaa	You may be on to something there, he does seem to be taking the engagement like it is a cover up arrangement to hide the fact.|`|Aabo2WP7aa	He's engaged.

lzVF1diNaa	hahah i remember when i was little i used to be in love with the guys from backstreet boys especially nick carter....woah seems so long ago|`|LRLu1ofNaa	Do you not remember NKOTB's big comeback last year?|`|5Wgsi9kXaa	I'm only 15, so I was really young during those times. I remember when I was around 8, all my friends seemed to be into the backstreet boys. Thanks for reminding me of those times. I never really noticed that there are no bands like that until you mentioned it. Your right, things are a lot different than before. It's amazing how fast things come in in out of style. That is what I think the reason is. Lately, I've noticed a lot of younger stars getting into the music industry. I guess these are just some of the things that come and go.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Yeah I remember the old days too. Im 20.|`|AA10368887	They became girl bands:    http://www.deedeecus.com/wp-content/uplo...|`|kHY0eMVraa	Yeah I remember those days.  I use to love Nsync haha!|`|vwTyihvvaa	Ah, the good ol' days.   I'm 20 and it seems like it was ages ago.|`|d7b8f18c89ed9f003ea45f3b4aeb20ceaa	i loved nsync and backstreet boys!!!     lol yeah JB is pretty much one of the only ones left\        OMG the girl bands are gone too  like DREAM! |`|3lbw0Tx2aa	gays went away|`|ns4Phv0maa	yes the guys have disapeared it seems.. but the spice girls rock!!! Britney isnt doing so well either..|`|Bmb3ksZFaa	Actually boy bands in America are no longer around. In Asia boy bands are still part of the mainstream market.

I hate to be the only one with nothing...it's like nobody even gives a crap enough to diss me...|`|NcNxIsynaa	Tell you the truth darlin I don't even pay them any attention...?|`|WbRuTjmFaa	hmph I think when I have 9 thumbs down I am very popular..|`|LpedVLedaa	I don't care either way, unfortunately.     I want to because I know the people giving me thumbs down want me to care, but I left that behind a couple of years ago.|`|VpuK1qTmaa	i guess so.at least then you know that your answer was noticed|`|7f2GSDmqaa	no..its the other way around|`|2PTlXs9zaa	Yes, it seems the thumbs are very heavy this eve. Kiddo's are home I suppose. May come back later when they are all in bed.|`|FNwxcBPpaa	I would rather be ignored.|`|H9gmJYdmaa	I'd rather be ignored.|`|WYfeH8nNaa	No, because most of the time, the posts I make are harmless andmean no offense, but I get like, 7 thumbs down.|`|JNQezEGqaa	Either way I know I have pushed a button   and  Made someone think.....

ty3nnq2uaa	Now  This question can never be resolved  1)Iron Maiden was a influence on Metallica but Metallica was      never like Iron Maiden  2)Both were pioneers in there respective trends  3)Iron Maiden have probably never given big dud as StAnger but have also never got to Billboard1   metallica has 5 consecutive 1's including StAnger  I Know Billboard is just crap for duds but you cannot deny it does give a idea of popularity  4)Metallica has some songs the popularity of which can never be acheived by Iron Maiden eg:Master of puppets,fade to black,one etc  but metallica can never emulate Iron Maiden in consistency  5)Both have sold nearby the same no of albums  Irons more in britain Metallica in US  6)END   Thus i believe its not a resolvable question but a heavily debatable topic  It also varies on personal taste  someone with a taste for metal in general would have a opinion like me i suppose      So lets hope for a Metallica&Maiden tour sometime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|zfadjiJVaa	Thats not even a close question metallica by far.|`|tyCnjhXCaa	metallica. although, they're really two different entities. it's hard to choose.|`|rM2PY9mPaa	Iron Maiden: Awesome band plus one of the pioneers of heavy metal. Almost every song they ever made is awesome! Bruce on the vocals, Steve on bass, and the three guitarist are all amazing.    Metallica: Woah!!!! These are the thrash masters right here, and have been playing for a long time. awesome riffs, fast drumming, and monster vocals just all good.    Winner: Iron Maiden just better band with all the members, and they never disappoint, and metallica screwed up big time on their latest album.|`|3b3C92wgaa	theyre both good but Maidens like one of my favorite bands and Metallica sucks now, so yeah Maiden|`|TUxPf25vaa	iron maiden influenced metallica  but these days most metal bands are influenced by metallica  i like metallica better though (first 4 albums with some songs on black album)|`|Qw4l9R68aa	Metallica in my opinion, there is no such thing as better though in music.|`|1vCoaf08aa	Considering Iron Maiden was an influence for Metallica.    Iron Maiden, but only because they constantly put out great stuff, Metallica will forever have the scars of St. Anger.|`|7fEVNng5aa	Why does one have to be classified as better? They can be enjoyed equally, can't they?|`|GG8x2kmfaa	Maiden, indefinitely.    Metallica doesn't hold a candle to Maiden. Metallica kinda sucks, also.|`|5HvdcWvBaa	Thats really funny that you should ask this 'cause Maiden & Metallica share my fourth favourite band position...i have never been able to decide which one is better, or which that i like better!|`|JXTLpgUoaa	If you limited it to the first 4 albums of each it would be insanely impossible to decide.  However, Iron Maiden never sold out.  Metallica has the better drummer and better guitarist, but Iron Maiden has the better singer and better bass player, even against Cliff.  I know the horror, the sacrilidge.  Bite me.  Harris rules.    Plus I've never hated Iron Maiden except when Bruce and Murray left the band.  Metallica I've not liked since the black album, absolutely despised to the point where I wanted to strangle them all myself since St. Anger, and only Death Magnetic has mangaged to calm my fury just a bit.      I want progressive thrash metal, you assholes!  Not this I reall wish I was a country music singer crap.  Hetfield.  Oh and give Kurt the rest of his balls back please.  DM was a decent step back but he still played like he half just didnt give a ****.    UP THE IRONS!|`|YwtXSUAdaa	Definitely Metallica...|`|PtNyUuDOaa	That's a pretty tough one. They've both had a considerable amount of impact, and they both have very skilled musicians. While Metallica had more mainstream success, Iron Maiden has been more persistent. I suppose it all comes down to taste.|`|00b644b30c5fa40d9099dfddcd2118c3aa	Iron Maiden is the more consistent band and has my vote because they make better t shirts.  I have three great ones by them.|`|kdo492J7aa	That is very hard. In my opinion, it's Metallica, but it is all up to your personal taste.|`|llNoDDCsaa	Iron Maiden.    But I like them both. :0)|`|pIMXHktGaa	i love them both, but metallicas deifinately "better."|`|j9axB0YMaa	Metallica
UD9U6Kweaa	i wouldnt say "popular"  but that was the year both bands had a song on he top ten billboard charts.|`|AAZTO16baa	green day's dookie came out that year and thats wut made them a big hit|`|DibFrwxlaa	Yes.
2KcmVTycaa	Paramore was once an amazing band.

ErN3pbTeaa	First of all, the degrees of which the planets are in the signs does not change their significance. The degrees are used for the aspects. If that were true 15 degrees would be the only true part of the sign.  Your chart does not suck...  A lack of air signs means that it's your element of luck. You need and desire them so that you can reach a balance.  Air signs are a communicative, intelligent, breed. Lacking this element means that you must work to obtain the characteristics of this element because they are not as natural for you.|`|elVDYy7eaa	Yep, I agree with you. It sucks.|`|9B6Om8oDaa	No one chat sucks. Each is different. If you want to know more, you can visit a website that I have liked on the subject, http://www.decisioncare.org/marriage/5-m...

k9gp11PMaa	Yep, it's Cancer, then Scorpio, then Pisces.|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Cancer, Scorpio and Libra    Hi Left-T|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Pisces.|`|Ow3O7h4caa	Any sign can be intuitive with a strong Neptune, Uranus , Mercury, Moon relationship . Moon in Sagittarius gives excellent psychic and intuitive abilities.    Linda Goodman was Aries  Carl Jung was a Leo  Alan Leo was a Leo  Nostradamus....Capricorn  William Lilly....Taurus  Issac Newton....Capricorn  Dane Rudhyar....Aries  C. C. Zain ...,Sagittarius ....to name a few    edit....Captain...Nostradamus was a Capricorn...here is the link...    http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_geGm51dlG5o/SU...    Edit.... Y  ......Yup...Aries & Moon in Sagittarius gives a fiery intuition. My Moon is in Sagittarius as well. :-)  So, don't be afraid to follow your hunches. Sagittarius/Moon are often dead-on in their hunches& intuition. Jupiter rules the higher mind LOL....    edit....forgot to mention the psychic 'Bouncer' .....sorry, you slipped my mind and it won't happen again. :-)|`|QelWHSZRaa	Geeesus WTF....leffie- T    ...you forgot to mention um Bouncer. i'm intuitive and my darn ruler is ur'anus. LOL..    ....don't know them other dudes but will check this sh*t out. oh, linda goodman is cool and hot. Darn it.|`|HvpkjTB2aa	Scorpio & Pisces.|`|gEnWVe76aa	Nah, it's Pisces then Scorpio then Cancer|`|hguvsRo8aa	Libra is most intuitive  Cancer/Pisces most psychic.|`|y6wikiJDaa	Definitely Pisces! Then Scorpio and finally Cancer. Libra is sensitive to her/his surroundings but definitely wouldn't call that intuitive or psychic.    Left-T: Nostradamus was Sagittarius, not Capricorn. Born December 14, 1503 in St. Remi, France.|`|ykIleAQ7aa	I heard it was Leo - which to me is more unlikely but that's what I have been told.   To me I would say the water signs. I'm a Cancer and there are times when my dreams or just something flashes in my mind and I know what will happen next and what to avoid. My boyfriend is also a Cancer and he is highly sensitive he can't drive because he never knows when he is going to see flashes of the future.      I agree with Left- T too.|`|bdfk2d49aa	Sagittarius.|`|F32mOSMEaa	im an aquarius and i am the most intuitive sign  i dont know psychic but i know intuitive.|`|9JEyfhfPaa	Don't mess the things... Water signs are more sensitive and not intuitive .    My grandmother, my uncle, my ex best Friend and my ex Bf are very intuitive people, and all of them are sags. It's really weird, they allways feel right what is going to happen... Amazing !    Btw, I'm aquarius and I am very intuitive too|`|2QbPDhluaa	Libra|`|WUKDoGJRaa	Pisces and Cancer.|`|HRfCijh4aa	Well sweetie ... pls keep in mind the growth pattern of the 4 elements through each sign. Also know that the house placement can higly influence the character one portrays. Pisces is highly intuitive due to the Influence of Neptune therefore assisting any other sign who may have a 12th House placement or a trine to Neptune itself. The Piscean element (water), planet (Neptune), house (12th) and the fact that Pisceans are a feminine sign and very mutable leads to their conscious and unconscious actions of intuition ... The Moon does assist Cancer with intuition yet it better supports helping Cancers "remember" emotions and short-comings. Scorpio's intuition is high in the bedroom or shall I say, when they have pressure surrounding them. This is supported by the 8th house of regeneration. The other signs and elements are bond to be intuitive in "limited" areas and times in their life. Pisceans live a consistent intuitive fashion! Natural.|`|A6agxakwaa	aries are supposed to be very intutitive    i wonder if what lef-t said was true, i'm and aries with a sag moon
3c5f2316d7b180d5f45a6448d9b9def0aa	Kelley, it was an amazing television event.    Nature has always humbled me.  And it's a wonderful thing to think we will never destroy this earth, no matter what we do, nature will claim everything.    I will continue to pull out every weed that thinks it can take root in my garden however!
3MB1Wsdaaa	Don't need to reply-they don't know me well enough to judge me and therefore aren't worth my time or energy.|`|MPba9IUBaa	"go suck ur moms dick"  thats wat i say|`|6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	I try not to take it personally because this is a game for points.|`|vvOyYDyCaa	.....and you are?|`|ajrnlFczaa	Whatever.  I don't let it get to me.  I know the truth.|`|p03Jc7eHaa	what c f said|`|AA11490975	me never talking to them again and me not caring.
PtNyUuDOaa	People have forgotten about Bush. They're no longer rip-offs because they were popular for a while... and then died. They're not important enough to complain about anymore.|`|wOc4Dqllaa	People DO call Bush Nirvana ripoffs! Every single review I've ever read of a Bush album points out the fact they're an inferior ripoff of Nirvana! They did pull it off better than most bands though.|`|OTFzJbaMaa	i dont really like any of those bands nor do i like their sound, but i think the people who call them nirvana rip offs are just bitter and hate anything that remotley sounds like a song nirvana would make because they think kurt cobain was was Gods gift to the earth.    keep in mind these are the same people who think nirvana was a better grunge band then alice in chains and soundgarden... im just sayin.|`|zZPbmxWkaa	Seether and Puddle of Garbage didn't rip off Nirvana, they ripped of Creed.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	Some people do call Bush Nirvana rip offs, just not as much as Silverchair or Puddle of mud. They all have copied Nirvana's sound, they're not the most original bands.|`|0DW8nj5caa	Even Bob Saget is funnier than you, and he is terrible!    "Mike Knox's beard is made out of pubic hair" Honestly, did you even try?|`|9hFexadLaa	because the singer of Seether was influenced strongly by Kurt and the Puddle of Mudd singer looks alot like Kurt|`|7qt4aQGYaa	Seetger was influenced by nirvana. but puddle of mudd is influenced by metallica, i don't think that they are ripping off nirvana. Wes Scantlin has a voice that is similar to Kurt's, that's why people don't like them, they can no longer say that Kurt's voice was unique because a band that has never cited nirvana as an influence has a lead singer that could easily pass as a stand-in for Kurt|`|UEzTKxwYaa	i hate how they all try to sound like kurt.

PMRp2ZRlaa	We only lived once, and life is not forever. Give yourself a chance. Good or bad, you don't have nothing to loose.     Failure and success are all parts of life. There are always be  problems no matter what. But the point is seek for the better, and not to stay with the worst. Sure we stumble and fall, get up again and just keep on going. In the end, they are part of memories,more or less, and all soon forgotten when we depart this world.    So, enjoy life while you can. Search that true meaning of happiness you're longing for, to fulfill your written destiny. Good luck...|`|ENspyhzUaa	idk i usually blow mines, so i can't say much about them|`|7f2GSDmqaa	It depends...if the person deserves it, then yes|`|SCs2inCsaa	No, if you get used to them, you will think you have get used to and enter the cycle of procrastination.|`|LDSL0DUiaa	yeah, of course|`|2BLfykCUaa	In life yes  in school no|`|Lp29F1ZZaa	Depends on the situation at hand.|`|04d81c107f433cebb6371d36ae227a9baa	absolutely yes|`|3MB1Wsdaaa	Sometimes-but some mistakes will never be forgiven.|`|YhjTbSmDaa	Some people deserve 2nd chances, yes.    But usually it doesnt even matter because you cant erase what happened the first time.

John is too common. Patrick is Okay but I don't care for unisex names. Matthew is also cool but my vote is for Zachary.|`|OoLy36Bjaa	Zachary John|`|RFcbLXh3aa	Patrick Matthew|`|e81cb58413964229d6af24dd65970eadaa	choose one name, double first names were lame when they were only for girls, now you want to put that on your son?  Do you want your son to be a criminal our social outcast otherwise?  At least you didn't choose Jaydyn Skylar or Kryschyn Lesslee or something equally horrible.  Try picking a name that you can imagine for a Fortune 500 company CEO.|`|e9U7jO3Zaa	zachary john|`|tLMZT97qaa	The first one sounds cooler.|`|rrGXtiJMaa	Zachary John|`|tB80PqOPaa	1st|`|PYl3GSQZaa	i like the second one, but what really matters is what do you like?|`|7f2GSDmqaa	John|`|jreon8v0aa	The first one.|`|hsDrlYMPaa	The first one|`|KnFElHEKaa	1|`|8X4Lxteeaa	zachary john :)|`|CfUuDEW9aa	Zachary John|`|iCLGHUdQaa	Zachary John.    Even though Patrick is a nice, classic name, I'm afraid it's mocked too much and the poor kid would get made fun of.|`|YhjTbSmDaa	Patrick Matthew.    My father's middle name is Patrick :)|`|CUl0iD7Caa	My brothers name is Zach. I like Zachary John.|`|cb9626d7fa143d0ce804d5d769640d45aa	umm...honestly? i like john patrick & zachary matthew. sorry to mix & match, but i think those combos sound better.|`|00CowMv3aa	Zachary John|`|nJOYHuyZaa	Zachary Matthew & John Patrick sound better, It flows better|`|vVTmJjJDaa	to me, middle names don't really mean all that much until a first name is chosen...    Zachary is definitely the better of the two, in my opinion, for the following reason:      no one is going to call a kid "Zachary" or "Patrick" once they reach middle school - they'll either be known as "Zack" or "Pat"...i choose Zack. :)    EDIT:  yikes, lol - please do not show this to Patrick! (if he gets picked on later in life, he might want to go by "Matt" - in fact, i like that name even better than Zack!). :)

Most of them would be annoying even if they were in the proper category!|`|lzTUEtppaa	Mostly Twilight.   Disney doesn't bother me that much.|`|bFLVPIkaaa	no how can i be sick of it i only watch it once and never will i watch it again|`|DVDm1GVDaa	Disney channel? Yes.  Disney itself is basically one of God's greatest creations.  To me, at least. =D  And I haven't been on in awhile, so I haven't noticed it too much.

2i6TPlauaa	It doesn't take much to make a good song, does it?|`|AA12301664	hi rw    wow.  that's me flattened right out. introspection indeed.  pehaps one of the simplest, yet most effective, and affective, songs i've ever heard.    ad i'm still a sucker for a bit of pedal steel...|`|7fEVNng5aa	What a great song, Radio Waves. Thanks for sharing. I got completely lost in it inside of a couple seconds. I don't want to get accused of plagiarism here, but the song *is* perfect for introspection on a cold, rainy day. I found myself looking out the window at the clear blue skies and wishing it would cloud up, even if for a short while.  ----  So, I'm on my 3rd listen now, and I'm getting the same feeling hearing this as when I listen to Nick Drake. Very simple, very mournful.|`|7B2s7maWaa	Great song, very soothing and calming.  It's nice I really  like this one a lot. Loving the vocals and the peaceful sound very much.  Thank you for posting and sharing. :]|`|5HvdcWvBaa	Took me a couple of listens to get into, personally. But i like it, its very peaceful.   Reminds me of Heroin by the Velvet Underground, somehow...  Yeah, its nice =]|`|ayS0085raa	And it works just as well in a snowfall :)    Some of the most simple and compelling stuff I've heard for ages - reminded me a little of Warm by Vic Chestnutt. I've also started doing the right thing and listening to these songs of the day on headphones, which really seems to make a difference with things like this. Amazing choice, thanks.|`|IatEdBpvaa	Just more proof that sometimes the simplest things in life are also the most beautiful ones.    Great post, thanks.
yjSGVfdiaa	great song.  Wowee Zowee has really grown on me.  Especially ever since I started buying the Matador 2-disc rereleases.  I've been absorbing their stuff all over again.  It's been great.  Great pick - awesome song from that album.    Don't know if you wanted the album version - but here it is if anyone wants to listen:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLeT1iLuR...|`|ayS0085raa	yep, people definitely need to listen to more Wowee Zowee. have a star :)
zFqJpKrraa	its actually a perfect idea!! i've done it with my ex and it cleared up alot of things. dont hold back, and a lot of your issues will work themselves out. good luck =]|`|sjnzoERfaa	yea|`|YhjTbSmDaa	I think it'd be a great idea to write a letter to him.  Its probably one of the best ways to explain yourself to him.    It could either make or break you though.    It could make him feel closer to you, or make him shift farther away, depending on what you write.|`|9GywK3mBaa	Yeah I think it's a good idea. Just remember there's a reason you broke up with him in the first place.|`|DVZNOlA5aa	you'll never know if you never try|`|hfZIKrhCaa	well y did u guys brake up??   and i would do what ur friend told u to do and get him to do it as well and once you've both read what the other person wrote sit down and talk about ur problems and try to sort everything out   :D|`|J1F3SRJsaa	It depends what broke us up ? Does he deserve a second chance,  whats the rush, Shouldn't you take some time out to breath. Go out and take some salsa dance lessons etc. have some fun, then see if he is willing to follow you.   Tell him to write down why you should accept him back, then you can decide if you want to write him back. Sorry guys.|`|lm2ByrhHaa	Why did you brake up in the first place? Dont forget about that! But if you think he's worth it, then go for it!|`|CeQqLIvkaa	Yes!|`|QanL79SGaa	i think that is a great idea :)|`|dDDAbqqhaa	there's a reason you broke up with him before, remember.|`|fMFsEo6oaa	yes i think its a gd idea its better to write it dwn hw u feel its so much easier than words hope all works out well 4 u both in the end tc xxx|`|1s6mQJqOaa	I think that is a great idea!!! GO FOR IT!! and good luck getting back together!|`|F5R3TJEQaa	do it !|`|HhY4Oul2aa	yes

Anyhoo, it didn't happen, and I broke up with him.|`|nuLroEjraa	yeah i did it.  we started dating in december '07, and i went home for christmas.  he didn't call me the WHOLE break. i was upset. so i was gonna dump him when i got back to college.  took me a week to get the courage.  i think i thought i could maybe change him? so i held off.  then i realized he's just really not for me.|`|qsuYKa3naa	I didn't want to hurt him|`|AA10742567	I have twice.

So eventually I made an excuse up to break up :/    Bad choice to hold on lol|`|PclT788Daa	I held onto a relationship throughout high school and college and little beyond.  I figured there was nothing else out there.  I hadn't met anyone that felt right.

Let me watch it and I'll tell you my opinion!|`|2zzZQHPpaa	it's not exactly for people who haven't read the book. if you read the book you get more into it. you love it. but if you don't read the book it may get kind of boring. oh and if you're a male, it will probably be boring for you, i suggest you check out the books though.    :D

Chicken, Steak, etc.|`|AA10742567	eat pizza|`|rsFWSelnaa	get pregnant|`|6TuPJ5lUaa	eat bread or stuff with flour or food with lots of carbohydrates. They stay in your body and turn into fat...very hard to get rid of though even if you work out. If you just eat food like mcdonalds every day it would not be healthy for your body. You would probably more likely get cancer or what not.|`|xLllDu18aa	they sell like this drinks to make you gain weight...is like milk....|`|HFEotT1Qaa	Take suppliments|`|0e4f865e315fc169e92917f5068a7248aa	Eat Wendy's.

hy45DHxgaa	Dear Nesh:    Yes !! Effective Communication Skills  are Critical for Success in Business  & with Spouses/GF's!    You ask about "Feelings" ?  This is more of a *girly-girl question.  "Masculine" Men DON'T Normally  display their feelings. They THINK!  Women "feel" !! (I may be one of the  few exceptions for a "thinking" male.  I tend to be a little More Emotional  then many of my masculine male friends.)    Remember this when engaging in  conversation with Most Males. It will save  you years of Frustrations & Counseling.  Keep DRAMA & Feelings to a Minimum!    Never ask a man what he "feels" about  something. Ask him what he "THINKS"  about something.    Does my answer make any sense to you?    Good Luck~  We all need that.  :-)|`|Cp6ACouDaa	I dont have any problem expressing feelings, although its not something I often care to talk about.|`|HFEotT1Qaa	Big masculine men usually have small scrawny penises.

I'm secure.|`|sHgWtEA0aa	yeah i communicate really well, it makes things a lot better|`|UwFb8cleaa	lol, it doesnt work that way, if id try to talk to my friends about my "feelings" the'd ditch me.
uw1NujDeaa	I do speak my mind,it's a shame some people find it insulting.And I do admire people who speak their mind.|`|VAsHKgYsaa	No, tell me this sweater looks great, or shut up!|`|2PTlXs9zaa	I know where I stand at all times, and expect the same. short of insults, of course. I take it at face value and neither admire or dislike them for it.|`|c9a60fdb57c6d0b3e097f61fc57c9d3daa	Depends on the diplomacy of it all.  If a person speaks their mind and it's hurtful I cannot admire that.  If they speak their mind and it's done with tact then speak all you want.|`|t8CS3gmIaa	depends on what they have to say about me lol|`|NGTuXvM8aa	admire it takes alot of courage to speak up when the rest of the sheep seem content to follow the herd|`|et9gdoDKaa	i actually dislike them if they speak their mind too much. they may think they're just "opinionated" but it can come across as close-minded and intolerant|`|yAXrsQiFaa	I admire them as long as they remain respectful.
W32XLc1baa	my love|`|sjnzoERfaa	yea....|`|IA2NJ8ndaa	You can avoid reality, but you cannot avoid the consequences of avoiding reality|`|ltlNGzmkaa	almost|`|ww3ukbdVaa	NO.

My life right now. =)|`|ZsujbEjJaa	nope|`|zhgc3TFxaa	no not yet hopefully soon though|`|tRtUJwMXaa	yes, but they are often strange deja vu type things.    2 and a half years ago, i dreamed that my mother took my textbooks (don't ask). a week ago i got my brand new textbooks for the new school year, after a few days they were missing and i was somewhat confused until i got the dejavu feeling JUST LIKE IN MY DREAM that my mother took them, and she did indeed.    another dream was a few years ago aswell, i remember being in a dark classroom with a flash of light peeking through the windows. mid way through last year - the very same feeling happened as the boys closed the curtains, a strip of light shone through and i got the same feeling i had when i was dreaming it.    too bad the one dream i want to come true, never, ever will.   and yes, it's about the opposite sex (which should go without saying)|`|QYDYX9B7aa	I had something happen. Then I dream about it. Does that count?   :D|`|4KT1cXMBaa	Yes, but it shortly ended that night.|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	Not yet. My dreams are a little more complicated and unrealistic.|`|mggll8dRaa	Sure Enough, a Few Times....!!|`|c3MFIbeUaa	MY top three Dreams are as follows.   3. You reach level five  and you have achieved that. Congratulations my friend.  2. You reach Level six. Your working on that one!  1., You reach Level seven. This is still in my prayer stage.     Just to let you know that your deleted question deserves a response and this will be mine as a reward from me for reaching level five. If one tries they can always find away around trolls and gestapo police at Yahoo.     A song for you!   Little girl, little hands, little eyes and lots of time?   What you gonna be, what your going to see,   when your eyes are  level with mine?     I'll be level with you   I don't know what I would do,   If i had to face  the things that you've got comming down the line!   If I had to face  the things that you've got comming down the line!     Lots of luck, lots of health, lots of wealth, and little pain.   That's what i want for you, but there is little i can do   To put you on the gravy train    I'll be level with you.   You'll always end up coming through   But you'll find yourself lost in space, now and again   But you'll find yourself lost in space, now and again     You have to have a world you can live in.   Not a world where all hope is gone.  And as long as we are together,   We can build a home for the free.     Filled with  Pity, not pain   That's loving and sane.   Not divided by hate, living in spite 'till it's too late.     Life is here   Love will come in the end, give it time   Theres wonders still to do and i know you'll find it true   That yours will be bigger than mine     I'll be level with you.   The one thing i hope you will do is  Tell me what your doing from time to time.   Tell me what your doing from time to time     I'll be level with you by the Moody Blues.|`|QaT680QHaa	Sadly Im still waiting..|`|HhY4Oul2aa	yes all the time, they r visions|`|OJtFNjfvaa	Yes!|`|v7HC2MGXaa	hell no..  i wish..|`|7B0qFbWBaa	i have deja vu in my sleep...i see it first in my dreams and then sometime when im awake i see it again...its kinda creepy sometimes|`|mBlcD6sRaa	no never|`|j7D3Sazraa	Uh.. yeah... I've been chased up a mountain by rabid, talking wolves.     :P Yeah right dude.|`|0qSpreVyaa	In short, yeah, though it wasn't really a "dream" come true. More of a "day dream" come true.    I met the girl i love, who just happens to be across the Atlantic Ocean! Well... i don't think ever aspect of your "dream" can possibly come true. But some can!    So keep dreaming guys! Something has to come true sooner or later! Hopefully it won't be a nightmare. : )|`|d1742746833f2615dcf34991254210b1aa	Yes. I wanted a ferret for a year but my mom never let me get one. July of 2008, my mother let me get my dream ferret- a female champagne ( champagne is the color) She sadly passed away on Thursday, but she's still my dream come true|`|VlCax7DWaa	waiting for that|`|aIEkNM0Paa	sadly no|`|ymMa6Pmiaa	Not yet.

pMSz4i8Kaa	In my honest opinion yes it is a waste of time since it's only 5 bucks|`|R6pfYeioaa	Only if there is no guarantee of getting the cards.  If they are actually adding the cards into the boxes then why not appreciate it?  I mean would you rather buy boxes of fruit roll ups and give up the $5.00 cards if they were there for you to have for free?|`|AA12069383	yes|`|UbSJPBuNaa	yeah it is kinda stupid|`|1da4ddb0b32e38994b79631ed4df2811aa	and the chances of getting a box with a five dollar prize is low too|`|EbEXx1Apaa	YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|KcRCQst5aa	yea it is pointless|`|hE7nI1Z3aa	Totally pointless.  A little kid cant even buy a toy with that.  Wtf is the point?!    Maybe a few packs of gum.|`|bPUcBaLDaa	its retarded i mean its only 5 dollars.the kids in the ad act like its $100,000.u cant even buy anything with $5
CS4MVhsfaa	Hi, Lauren!    Yeah, Space Ghost sounds correct.  I used to watch as a kid when it was first aired.  I'm not sure but I think it was originally shown on ABC.    The web site below will probably have better information.    John H|`|Hiasgb75aa	I'm not sure about white...    But I remember a show called the Blue Falcon and Dinomutt, and he looked ALOT like Batman. Except he was dressed in Blue (obviously)|`|AA10289523	Space Ghost|`|VhGC3vAqaa	It is still on Cartoon Network it is called Space Ghost. It is only on late at night on Fridays for some reason though|`|8yE2sYGeaa	That's Space Ghost and the Fanged guy is Brak

The video was moving, but not so moving to the government, who don't give a toss.    Mrs Merlot ... the link nearly had me in tears, It's disgusting after everything they've been through, It makes my blood boil, but also makes me sad when I see things like that.|`|jCFWPWpUaa	Especially so after it was in the news this week that the family of a young soldier who returned minus his legs, were refused permission to build him a bungalow on their own land.    I'll see if I can find the story and post a link.    edit; Found one.    http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-...|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	Yes but they won't listen, they never do regardless of who is in power.

My 2 days off are devoted to sleep, but one day a week I can be fully awake and not go to work. Usually I am on the Internet to update my Secret 007 Yahoo Group at http://movies.groups.yahoo.com/group/Sec...  or write and update my reviews and listmanias on Amazon.com or play a game or two. Currently I am watching the old "Dark Shadow" episodes on DVD.
sE1A1iIgaa	Eehhh, it's not like it's a new development.. never really could trust the hell outta anyone ever anyway.  Butaaaa i get what your sayin, feels like a unusually high amount of people are lien these days...|`|lLB5nN3paa	Trust is something that is hard to come by these days.  You get backstabbed by those you consider really close and it gives you a new perception of society.  I guess instead of waiting around and falling victim to this betrayal, it is better not to trust anyone at all.  As sad as it may sound, it is better to use and manipulate to move on ahead in life.|`|2H2RVmiEaa	You can trust me, hon - I won't hurt you! Well, maybe an occasional spanking...  ;)|`|tmwOwc0Laa	You barely realized this|`|p03Jc7eHaa	every one is self centered,its all about me me me|`|nuLroEjraa	You can, no one's stopping ya.  But when they crush your heart/betray you, you'll see why you shouldn't.|`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	how can you trust somebody that betrays your trust and intentionally too?|`|cUYunFvHaa	its true, u can only trust people who u dont have any real friendship with, kuz friends tell u things that are nice, gf's and bf's lie about cheeting, parents just tell u everything is a bad choice, and strangers well who wants to talk to them that much, but when u meet one u think is cute, then u should ask them all ur questions, and they should be pretty honest because he wont have any reason to lie other than to sleep with u and if thats not possible than ...... hey maybe they're just telling the truth, but overall i'd say no, u cant trust anyone anymore|`|yW12qyxoaa	I say we blame it on Global warming and the Government|`|AWDSCsZdaa	its true you cant trust anybody because you never know when they gonna turn on you but never let them know you cant trust them and dont tell people anything you wouldnt wont the whole world to know .  people even your bestys be jealous of you and they try to make you look bad
W0A39Ysjaa	YES! i always tell people the truth even if it hurts|`|sgHvnxe2aa	Only when one speaks the truth in love and even deeply held conviction  and not just someone using what THEY consider to be the truth to try run someone down without any reason.....like "you look stupid in that" or "you're ugly" or other such insults parading as "truth" as their excuse to hurt someone, just because they can.... >:(|`|ho6LQF8xaa	The truth isn't "always" good thing.  Sometimes it hurts to find the truth or denied it because we don't believe it's for the good reasons/purposes of ourselves or to the world    Not to be negative and all  But I have to say its also good to know the truth depending your current position of a conflict/problem    The truth at times change how you take other things that are kept from you by other people in a good or bad way.|`|fJ9gJ1ttaa	the truth sometimes hurt...but it makes you grow in ways that are good|`|6U9b2t4raa	No it's not.  When a women asks if these jeans make her look fat, or if someone gets a bad haircut, it's just easier to lie.|`|cUYunFvHaa	yes, indeed, well..........    sumtimes not if u want to stay in a relationship, lol|`|2H2RVmiEaa	No, brutal honesty can be hurtful. Sometimes it's better not to tell the whole truth!|`|T7HuKzZcaa	not really   especially during sex
lLB5nN3paa	I pretty much have that feeling everyday.  Eventually, you learn to accept it because it becomes the norm in your life.  Why bother figuring out what's missing for when you find out what it is, that void will be filled with another void.  It's an endless cycle.  "Gods" way of getting a quick laugh I guess.  Makes you think that time will heal all, but it doesn't...it only makes it bareable.|`|2H2RVmiEaa	All of the time - it's normal to feel like that but it isn't any fun!|`|elECfJ52aa	no|`|6U9b2t4raa	Yes,   a while back during a towel snapping fight in the men's locker room shower area.... thank goodness that modern medicine can replace a testicle        on a serious note, condolences to Singincurly for her uncle|`|qvdZIMlwaa	yup rite now|`|oRr9SOIqaa	Yupp. My uncle passed on today....i'm feeling it.|`|vqSkOICGaa	yep. every morning when I drop my daughter off at school:( oh and of course after you break up with someone after like 458723 years. sick.|`|ba4R1tf1aa	Ted is such a liar.    He was born like that.    I know.|`|sjnzoERfaa	yea|`|YFgREceaaa	24/7|`|63dUOWFNaa	yes...|`|zl2cBCj0aa	Yeah ordinary feelings ):|`|sE1A1iIgaa	Yup yup.. oooh man have i..... sure have.. defo one of the sh!tiest feelings.     But...  say if somethins missin, all ya can do is surround your self with good things, great things to fill the piece that's not there anymore.  Ya gotta power through.    Truth is ya feel like sh!t really no matter how much ya try to fill in what missing... truth is if it's missin nothin you can do can put it back... "time heals all wounds"... just takes time.. eventually you forget. And it no longer feels as sh!ty.  Just give it time.

( I kid you not)|`|U3qTwOOIaa	they did 'one bad apple' but most of the were ballads|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	No all their other stuff was waffly crap, 'Crazy Horses' is great.

1vEqxzgZaa	They aren't terrible, but not fantastic, either. It's also very feminine and  pop-ish, as well as slightly cheesy (no offense). Anyway, keep writing! You have potential, and could improve a lot..|`|nbGf6udUaa	nope.too mushy, too many words.brevity is the soul of wit.say as much as possible in as few words possible.|`|cwqB4j0uaa	yes i do =)|`|Box3Jtelaa	Yeah.. Its very good! :]] keep up the great work..|`|D8sN8gNFaa	A little predictable and corny, sorry if that's too harsh, but I knew what it was about the first 2 lines in.|`|Tg6ySuUOaa	its pretti (haha pun intended) good, but could use some work! be a little more clever and then BAM! NUMBER ONE HIT!|`|c88Z21chaa	"I have to get you out of my mind I think" i reckon it would be better if u said "to think" instead of "i think" like he is clogging up all of ur thoughts..  "but i we havent spoken" i think u need to get rid of the "i"    "Talking to would talk my breath away" maybe talking to 'you' would... ?    "Sometimes we have our minutes when we look in each others eyes" maybe moments instead of minutes, makes it seem like the breif time is more precious        its a pretty simple and cute song about maybe high school sweethearts, her never realising that he notices her too.  I dont think it is quite predictable, the last couple of lines prevent it from being cheesy.  Id be damn proud if i wrote sumfin like this, so good job!!  xo|`|tB80PqOPaa	great song i just sung it it somehow relates 2 twilight the book|`|Kw8W1ECKaa	Thats really good  you should put chords on it and play it on a guitar|`|HklyMOxiaa	I like it..u mite wanna consider sending it in to some songwriters n get their critiques ov it|`|BS9pRP97aa	yeah thats really good! except in some places it could use some work but over all its good. i imagined it as a country song well thats how i sang it but is that what your going for country?|`|VoiJ73xfaa	Good effort...

Then what star sign he or she is has nothing to do with it.   For love is not about star signs it is about so much more like spending the rest of your life with someone who will go through the hard times with you as well as the good times. Will still love you when you are old and grey. Will be your be friend no matter what, They will be there when you need them to be that's what it is all about.

bYlEqiKVaa	The first three seasons are amazing... seasons 2 and 3 in particular were better than a lot of the garbage on TV at the time, or even right now, but the show's pretty underrated.  Addictive storylines, and even some artful storytelling and direction in there as well.  The storylines start to get a little wacky and out there in season 4, but the kids' performances start to improve, so it's a pretty good tradeoff.      Keep watching.  If you liked the first two episodes, keep watching.  You won't be disappointed.|`|6dI5JC9Gaa	YES!!!!   The first four seasons go by so fast!!! Trust me!!   I started watching it from the fourth season and ever since then I've been watching OTH. The fifth season was a little to dramatic and I didn't like it that much, but season six is getting to be really good! I went back and watched previous seasons and it was really worth it. The show is really good so I definitely recommend it.|`|aa4a6f7a38e32e1bcf469defc1408816aa	It's one of my favorite TV shows. You grow attached to the characters and it's dramatic, but I don't think it's overly dramatic. Plus the actors are awesome. I'd say you should!|`|gErVlMNuaa	You will spend many days glued to the TV trying to catch up. I think once it is passed the 3rd season it might not be worth it.|`|wzSwoPBOaa	you should definitely watch it. the first time i watched one tree hill was on the season finale of the fourth season. i caught up and watched seasons 1,2,3 and 4. you'll be stuck by your tv for days. it is so good. you'll cry and laugh, and the quotes and characters are unbelievably good. yeah, so def watch it!

3MB1Wsdaaa	Agree with you-it was a lot harder then but the work people did was for survival. Now we sit in front of computers and so forth while we buy food full of hormones etc and all the outbreaks of disease in our food-it really seems like we need a return to simpler times-we are ruining our planet and ourselves in the process and for what? A cell phone, a laptop and all the other useless items we have-doesn't seem like a fair trade if you really think about it.|`|oSsVEXMxaa	They weren't nearly as well off as you think they were...for "cavemen," every day was a fight for survival, and Native Americans didn't live as peacefully and enlightened as some people would like to assume.    We *have* become very dependent on technology, but I don't think the examples of lifestyles to imitate are ideal.|`|720106f8fa9586128d276437bf2e0e18aa	no because right now i can go to the grocery store to buy my food, i dont have to hunt it down, living with the parents anyways, so they cook for me|`|AA10461616	Maybe in a different era, but not quite that far back!  I think it would have been fun to grow up in the 50's when things were really laid back, or at least it seems that way to me when older family members speak of them.  Back when people were not just a number and a persons word meant something.  Back when policemen and teachers and others in authority were not crooks or child molesters.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	No I dont...Id get killed and wouldnt be able to adapt|`|VPC8Epq9aa	true, but i'd hate to live in a cave.    i know a girl who kinda has monkey features, everyone thinks she hasn't evolved :(|`|l5hCRJgmaa	i dont think i could stand the annoying grunts they make all the time, haha

E.T. gets me every time, as does Terms of Endearment. I also remember tearing up during parts of Saving Private Ryan.|`|7fXpLlhBaa	I cry at almost every sad movie. I cried during Adam Sandler's movie, Eight Crazy Nights. GO FIGURE.     The last one I cried during was The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. (That's at least more reasonable than Eight Crazy Nights!)    I also cried during Click, another Sandler movie! What is he doing to me!|`|bb711c82f23cfb9ed9fc6e0fbe03147aaa	nope|`|GfM4EPwzaa	Now I don't,  but when I was a younger,I cried at Edward Scissorhands .|`|imlj6eNBaa	I just cried to Marley and Me =(|`|DZC58db7aa	The first movie I ever cried at was Titanic.  I was 6 years old at the time and I went with my mother and her boss.  I remember crying... not because I knew what was going on in the movie... but because everyone in the movie theater was balling their eyes out.  When 200 people are in the same room crying at the same time, it's really heavy for a six year old haha.
4cWtH7X2aa	My guess would be because that's not the name of the country. Canadians are as patriotic as Americans and we're proud of our country, a lot of Americans have no clue about Canada at all (not really your fault, I blame your media portrayals). We are alike but we're not the same, it's not offensive to me but I could see how it might be for some.|`|luwBPdE8aa	The population of Canada is a lot less than that of the USA and they are part of North America, but they usually don't call themselves Americans.|`|O6k9CJypaa	lol....haha|`|bHt24VPcaa	How about Canada sr?|`|mnAFVaK5aa	ahahaha I have no clue.

But I think that Demi Lovato is the smartest, or Aly or Aj Michalka, or maybe Hilary Duff, idk im undecided|`|Pv6n2pGAaa	"Smartest" would be based on opinion, so there is no exact answer as most celebrities won't come out and say that they're stupid. But Selena Gomez would be my opinion. Or Alyson Stoner.|`|5tUWitMiaa	In Disney Channel Selena Gomez acts like the "clever girl" so I think she is the smart one, but definitely not Katy Perry, Paris Hilton, Miley Cyrus, and Lindsay Lohann! They all did bad things so no way they are smart!|`|gAHsB0Txaa	hilary dufff(:

NwYwLdsNaa	What the heck!!!!  I just think I might cry...I didn't even know this.  I loved the Darlings!  Bring them back!    On November 16, 2007, ABC ordered a full 22-episode season for the show, making it the first show to receive a full season order since the WGA writers' strike began on November 5, 2007.[2] However, in the end, the first season comprised only 10 episodes due to the strike. Dirty Sexy Money: The Complete First Season, a three-disc DVD set including all 10 original episodes and exclusive bonus features including bloopers, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and featurettes, and more, was released on September 16, 2008.[3] The second season premiered on October 1, 2008, ten months after the first season finale. On November 20, 2008, ABC decided not to order any additional episodes for the 2008-2009 TV season.    ABC is in negotiations to bring unaired episodes of Dirty Sexy Money to ABC.com without broadcast rights.|`|AORcLwTNaa	it died|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	It was canceled.  ABC said originally that they might air the remaining episodes this summer, but it's more likely that the only way to see them will be to buy the DVD set.

Ow3O7h4caa	They met in 1907 and although they had different theories, they weren't enemies.    Here is a link on their meeting.    http://www.freudfile.org/jung-freud.html|`|5l2kTANaaa	They were friends but they parted. I think Jung was more in tune with everything "out there", shall I put it. And Freud was not.  I think Jung was a student of Freud at first but he developed his own ideologies and refused to "swallow" everything Freud came up with.|`|Fkvk49ngaa	yes, freud and jung were said to be friends, but i highly doubt that 2 highly prominent psychological theorists discussed the workings of a pseudoscience.|`|nF7g8nphaa	I am not aware there was an ongoing friendship or association between Freud and Jung. They have quite differing theories of psychology, symbolic interpretation and therapeutic methods.    I am not qualified to comment on the history of astrological scholars.
AdEJBAkMaa	He is not dating anyone right now, but his ex-girlfriends were Victoria Justice (Zoey 101) and Malese Jow (Unfabulous).

AA10159262	I think it's because all his many mental and emotional traumas caught up with him. From the time he was a child and learned that his mother was an actual prostitute, to the times she hit him for interrupting her with a customer, to the time he promised to save the little girl and failed and she was eaten by the dogs. It was after that he cracked up and 'became' Rorshach. Notice that in the 1960's appearances of the New Minutemen he spoke normally, though muffled by the mask. But Laurie (speaking to Doc M.) notes that R's voice is a horrible monotone.|`|7Ca2Iobuaa	idk but hes awesome

AA10025824	De ja vu refers to the feeling you get when you're experiencing it, and the feeling you've been there before.  There's definitely such a thing because it's so strong when you feel it.  Why anyone gets it I don't think anyone can really explain, just a lot of speculation about re-incarnation or the Matrix and things like that.|`|97158e12e6c17080ec04a0a2b2456b2aaa	yea there is, i have expirienced it too many times! But its kinda cool because sometimes i can guess whats gonna happen next "while" the de ja vu is happening, and usually people cant do that, they just usually say "i knew that was gonna happen because i felt like this happened before." but not usually during. its cool yet creepy.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I don't know why people do but I think it does exist to an extent! Kinda like psychic stuff, I believe some of it as well.|`|nl7tkxc3aa	yes, i hate it.    creepy|`|KQjhOdsIaa	yes|`|ZyXpGLl4aa	Yes, some believe that we're shown every minute of our lives before we   come down into this world.|`|AA11109728	There has to be - I've experienced it too many times.|`|0IjomiJ2aa	Seems like I have heard this before|`|Gr59rhfWaa	de ja vu is a vision of a brain turned on while sleeping     so scientificly yeah it is|`|S2uAq7i4aa	HAHA!  I've just seen a commercial foe Beyonc's Irreplaceable!I was thinking - Deja Vu!Her song xD  There has to be!|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Yes, I have it all the time. Once a month at least.|`|fghgwE2waa	Hi. Yes. As to why it is a mystery. Peace|`|94bc247802ba3a691d5647256aca97e2aa	havn't I seen this question before....?          woah!! de-ja-vu!!        Yes i get de-ja-vu all the time. Really I do though. Really I do though.|`|d2bca6X2aa	I really think that it is just a trick of the eye and mind. The things you think that you may be have relived or only feelings, this feelings you get when a certain person talks just reminds you of something making you think you've been there before. So yes and no I do and don't believe in de-ja-vu!|`|DQkDQraOaa	Maybe reincarnated peple experience it?|`|kc1IBYMRaa	Yes, but there is nothing mysterious about it.  The optic nerve fires twice simultaneously (I don't know how or why) thus confusing the brain that the event perceived is occurring twice and filing two separate memories of the event.
ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	The title gives it away: "The Life Before Her Eyes". Right before you die, people often say that you see your life passing before you. Uma's character (Diana) is actually the one who got shot and died--not her friend, Maureen. The movie tells you Diana had an abortion. She picked the baby name "Emma" with her friend which we saw among the little crosses. And the child in her life flash is also "Emma" and is always running away from her, and she is searching in the woods for her; this represents her feeling of loss over the baby. Also her child tells her "You hate me"--which is her guilt for aborting the child, that the child would think she hated her that's why she aborted her. What we see in the whole movie is what passes through Diana's mind the moment before she decides to sacrifice herself. She knows her friend is good and she feels she is not. The movie is what Diana's life could have been. She was the woman with her husband only since it never happened because she died that day it was her seeing herself which is the whole premise of the movie, her life passing before her eyes. You notice you never see the friend in her adult life. Also, she tells the woman at the memorial she is "not" one of the survivors. And Diana's mother cries her name in anguish the moment she is shot. Mothers tend to know this type of thing. Her mother knew it was she who had been killed. Furthermore, there's no way a college professor is going to be with a 17 year-old girl. It was all her fantasy that we, the viewing audience, see as Diana made the decision to die so her friend could live.  P.S.--Who's Lauren?

WUKDoGJRaa	I have a pisces moon and I think I dress pretty classy, simple, nice.    Solid colors, with a center piece like a cute detailed necklace or a scarf.    I find it true.|`|uel6NBOVaa	The ascendant has more to do with appearance and how others see you. That being said, I'm a water moon and I think I look classy, but I'm also a Libra rising.|`|ZyXpGLl4aa	I'm one but that's silly in my opinion. Plenty of people have "a classy look about them".    o-k..|`|gEnWVe76aa	oh yeah! Now that you mention it!!! Well, actually mostly scorpio moons|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Well, I haven't noticed that. Maybe.|`|VHxZuaOfaa	if that's the case fire moons must look like whore's since that's fire opposite.|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	Haven't noticed that. Seems like the water moons I know have round baby faces.
imlj6eNBaa	I agree about what you said with Chance! That was wrong doing that to Cali! Making it seem like he was going to pick her. He could have still chose someone even though he wasn't in love YET. You can't fall in love in 2 weeks (at least I think that's how long they stay there). And Cornfed was a great choice for Real! I ABSOLUTELY hate Bay Bay BAY- man looking girl! But he seemed doubtful on the reunion if he wanted to stay with Cornfed! I won't be surprised if they make a part 2! I'm sick of these shows where they don't stay together. It probably has something to do with them being away from eachother for 6 months.|`|GNOF6lzKaa	i feel nothing at all...all reality tv shows are written..meaning..its fake they all r just following a script...to get high ratings on tv..basically they just want u to watch theyre show ...but if it was real then i guess i wouldnt be mad at him..he just wasnt ready to love some1 yet ...its better not to choose anyone then take them through changes  dont u think|`|csBvaXjiaa	I think Chance did the right thing by not picking either Risky or Cali.  We all know these reality "love" romances are fake and there will be a RCOL 2.|`|7xMy4jmFaa	I have to admit that this show has become my secret obsession. It really stunk for Cali and Risky but come on do you really think they would end up with this person in the long run? I can see Cornfed and Real walking down the aisle any minute. But besides that I found this show very entertaining.  Im sure that Bay Bay Bay chick is cool in real life but she seems like to total biatch. But again this is a reality show and not real life.. (but I love it)..lol|`|eGCWuY4raa	Get set for the second season of Real Chance of Love.  I just read somewhere that Real dumped Cornfed.  He tried to say that she couldn't deal with his lifestyle, but he was really calling and seeing some the girls from the show the entire time.  As for Chance, he is almost as big of a jerk as his brother.  He acted like that he was so upset that he couldn't choose either one of the girls.  If either of these "men"  wanted true love, they wouldn't be looking on a reality show.
UAHjJpC0aa	Warmoth is probably the best guitar "parts' company out there    they've been around for years, for a reason    You can buy their bodies, and have your own artist paint the body if that's what you want?    What are you willing to pay?    You aren't going to find any $500 "custom" basses out there.    There are guitar/bass builders out there, but since they are hand made, USA built, they aren't cheap.    The stuff out there under $1,000 is all made in Asia, in big quantities,   to keep the prices down,  one of a kind, is gonna mean Buck$    Do you want a "custom" body? (REAL expensive)  paint job? (can be expensive too, if you want "airbrushed", or hand painted)  electronics?  ($200-800 extra)  all of above?    what do you want customized?    I have a friend in Az, that will build anything that you want  his prices "Start" at about $3,000, and go up.|`|pHQHvb99aa	google it

OWXI806qaa	Well you might like "The Mentalist" on CBS,  Click this link to check it out.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mentali...    But My favorite TV show ever is 24 on FOX.  You should watch it.  I know that you'll get a lot of responses to this question,  but this is the answer that you need to listen to.  Trust me!  24 is awesome!  It has everything that you could ever want in a TV show.  Drama, action, some romance, suspense & really good plot lines.  But I will warn you, it's addictive.  They just began the seventh season a few weeks ago,  but you could probably find the first 6 seasons at Block Buster.  I don't know if you know anything about it, but it's all in real time.  Each season is one day. Each episode is one hour.  There are 24 episodes in a season.  It's basically about fighting terrorism & about a really awesome  main character named Jack Bauer.  It's not the kind of show whrere you can just start watching   at any point & still know what's going on.  You have to start from the beginning, or at least the beginning  of a season.  It comes on monday nights on fox.  I've seen a lot of TV shows, & it really is the best.  Click the link below to check out 24.   Hope I could help.|`|f63ba71f316e8a0101a83d2986ff5c54aa	lets hope there are no psychological tv shows,  exept reality shows ..lol. it is real.lol.

It's one of the few diseases that people can freely discriminate against.|`|5qFmukWwaa	I'm morbidly obese and I don't expect anyone to pity me for it, nor do I whine or complain.  I know I did it to myself and I know how to fix it.|`|4a4z6ACiaa	I agree with you 100 percent on this one.      They should stop feeling sorry for themselves and put down the Twinkies.      Sorry if that sounds mean, BUT IT'S THE TRUTH|`|22086e3d6b0411d277d8b6f371ac7bb5aa	I agree with your observations, it is ultimately that person's responsibility to be fat, skinny or anywhere in between, but I still feel sorry for them.  I have several 400 and 500 pound patients and they are fairly young, but their lives are more or less over.  They have arthritis, hypertension, diabetes and eventually will have heart disease because of their shear size.  It's such a waste.

Mic placement, mixing, engineering even the size of the room and the materials in the room will affect the sound. Just something to think about before you go chasing another drummers sound.|`|KFjEkOlPaa	You have a Pearl Forum. They won't sound like Zach's or Rian's drum sets. They're sets are made from keller 6 ply shells. Which means the darn things are 5mm thin and resonate more, and produce a lower note. Plus, Zach uses an 18" floor tom and odds are yours is a 16"     Your drums can sound like theres in a live venue if the sound guy knows what he's doing. Other than they, get some Evans Coated EC2's with some coated Evans G1's on the bottom adn you'll be about as close without dropping $2400 on a new SJC or Truth kit. Buy a drum dial and set all your tom reso heads to 74 or 75, then the batters to about 72-73.     You can easily get the bass drum to sound like theirs with an Aquarian Super Kick II batter head and an Aquarian Regulator reso head.
KLNLfYQeaa	This is according to a blog written on an update for BBC's Big Cat Diary;    The Marsh Pride of lions are also well, their young growing rapidly. They are currently living near to the airstrip for Governors Camp which gives the visitors a spectacular arrival!    http://www.realafrica.co.uk/blog/  Scroll down to 'Update on Shakira'    THEN, this long story is according to Bebo, but it's almost a year old.  In the last series, a female ousider tempted Notch to stray from the pride. The Marsh females were unimpressed and hostile. This year, Tamu's story unfolds as she struggles to raise her new cubs, alone and unprotected.       Tamu  Last year, Notch, the Marsh Pride male, angered the pride females when he mated with Tamu, an outsider. She now has four five-week-old cubs.  But she's still living outside the pride, unwanted by the Marsh females. Without the pride's support and protection, how can she hope to raise her cubs?     Deadly pursuit   Tamu's cubs face many threats, not least from buffalo who will target and kill them. But the biggest threat is from other lions. Tamu gets entangled with two young males who will kill her cubs so they can mate with her themselves. Their pursuit makes it impossible for her to return to the lugger where the unprotected cubs are hidden.    Another attack  During the night, Tamu makes it back to the cubs. But the relaxed family scene in the morning doesn't last. Another rogue male gets wind of her.   This is her first litter and her inexperience shows. The cubs need to lie low and stay quiet, so as not to attract attention. Instead they're running into the long grass, calling out to Tamu.    Tamu defends her family   The male is soon on to them. His threat is clear. When he's only a few metres away, the tension becomes unbearable and Tamu snaps, throwing herself straight at him.  The male turns tail. Tamu now needs to round up the cubs and hide them, but as she searches, a cub distress call is heard from the long grass. (see diary)    Bad news for Tamu   Tamu finds the distressed cub, but it looks like the male found him first. The cub's front leg is badly hurt.  With two cubs still missing, Tamu leaves the compromised area searching for a safer place. The injured cub tries valiantly to keep up. Finally, they rest in the muddy marsh.     Tough decisions  Tamu is torn between protecting the two cubs she has found and returning to search for the missing family members.  She at last decides to head back to the den for another look, but there's still no sign of the missing cubs. On her return to the marsh den, she finds that her badly injured youngster has died.    http://www.bebo.com/Profile.jsp?MemberId...      I hope I at least gave you some info you were looking for :)
LwhnquZJaa	Yep. Not rich but not poor.|`|mggll8dRaa	No, I don't make enough...!!|`|1PGmB4JNaa	yepsss, not rich not poor ?|`|nuLroEjraa	upper middle class.  we're not rich, but not poor.  the house down the street cost a million bucks.|`|j0gtbpS1aa	Make too much money to qualify for government help but dopn't make enough money to make ends meet.  Stuck in the middle.  Better to be either dirt poor or filthy rich than all this struggling!|`|i3PGjRRfaa	In America, a family is rich if they make about 95,000 a year.  That will put them in the top 20% of all wage earning families...............|`|j7D3Sazraa	The two ways to look at things if I wasn't middle class:    1. I'm a hobo that lives in a cardboard box. A cardboard box that gets WiFi.    2. I'm freaking rich. But I'm wasting my time on Y!A instead of driving my Porsche or rolling in my wad of cash.    Obviously, I'm middle class(not rich but not poor).|`|daij1eBCaa	Yeah, I guess. To me it means you're not rich but you're not poor either...kinda in the middle. ?|`|H0LPCjIRaa	Yep! You aren't rich, but you aren't in poverty.|`|FCFQRAvCaa	Yes. It means there are as many people that have more money than me as there are people with less money than me. I'm right in the middle.|`|YnBdka6naa	No. I consider myself lower class. Dirt poor. =] Lol|`|OUwyHduraa	Yep.

I like the internet better.|`|KnCcEfBpaa	If you are down with the practice of verification via several outlets, then the internet... but it's more work to be sure the stories are credible.  ;-)|`|Q8ZlzjSqaa	i think its the internet, deffinetly :)  tv doesnt re-play old news!|`|CxyXgoA5aa	Internet.  Like Y!, or newspaper sites.|`|qxteTM9Kaa	radio,short and to the point|`|Kjxahz06aa	With the web, DailySource.org is great. It does the job for you by filtering out everything that's junk and links you to information that isn't bias and just in general is more high quality news. It's also non-profit so I guess that takes off pressure in serving demand and instead works on getting the best news articles for you.|`|0Re4PPq9aa	YOUR MOM|`|HJbZHS2uaa	internet...more stuff|`|xYqrCYuFaa	My grandpa.

Nothing in the newspaper is fake or else that would be illegal lol.  The internet however is not always as reliable, unless you go to reliable websites that are legitimate but sometimes you wouldnt always know. The newspaper can occasionally take a side to a story but the story is always real. In general I'd say the newspaper or the radio news.|`|tyisnTbwaa	hoodies because everyone wears them, so if a person  wearing a hoodie robs a store then the news goes. OMFG a HOODIE just ROBBED a STORE    Oh crud i read the wuestion wrong :)|`|lZ9QylvLaa	I think seeing something with your own eyes is the most reliable source. But, that is not always possible. The major media is completely bias. Practically, all news channels are owned by this media mogul person named  Rupert Murdoch. The news media is just like everything else. It is all just fluff between the commercials. They are there to get an audience so that big businesses can sell their products to the viewers. It is seriously all about advertising. I would try to go with as many independent news sources as possible. The internet is a good way to get independent news. Any source where you see advertisements, however, is guaranteed to be biased.

EaurpLufaa	In 1983, Winfrey relocated to Chicago to host WLS-TV's low-rated half-hour morning talk-show, AM Chicago.  The first episode aired on January 2, 1984.  In 1985, Winfrey co-starred in Steven Spielberg's epic film adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel "The Color Purple."  On February 9, 2006 it was announced that Winfrey had signed a three-year, $55 million contract with XM Satellite Radio to establish a new radio channel.  The channel, Oprah & Friends, features popular contributors to The Oprah Winfrey Show and O, The Oprah Magazine including Nate Berkus, Dr. Mehmet Oz, Bob Greene, Dr. Robin Smith and Marianne Williamson.|`|Aabo2WP7aa	Inauguration 09.

mzNLfY4Caa	Honestly, I don't know much about musi. I can definitely say that you have a very soothing voice. If a person cannot sing, I usually feel very uncomfortable listening to them, but I have to say that did not happen with you. You have a very soothing and relaxing voice! I would assume that you've been taking singing lessons?     Overall my honest opinion. I think you have a great voice. You should definitely follow your dream if that is what you want most.|`|7ljzPBjyaa	You should pursue it to entertain your friends, but don't make a career out of it.|`|BZuy7Rrmaa	decent to better than average considering its a solo with no music in the background i'd pursue it you will get even better the more you practice|`|yM3QtXgPaa	i actually think ur okay!!  if u get a singing coach u would just be AWESOME!!|`|6p50zivoaa	Hey.well i listened to ur singin and really ur not bad at all.not to be mean but with singing lessions ud be awsome.;D  so yeah take some lessions and practice alot and u should be able to get out there and persue singing.good luck!|`|F3oaDkT9aa	Not to sound mean, but your voice is boring... like monotone kinda except a little bit less|`|ZYJdpXEBaa	i think you are very good, you have a voice   i think you should relax a little because you can hear it in your voice that your waiting for the next lyric and it makes you sound a little bit too tense. so just let it flow and let you take control not the music..  good luck in your singing career :)|`|YnBdka6naa	You sound pretty good.|`|WA2Kn1EDaa	You're much better than me..  Keep it up.|`|mzAE9iesaa	you sound pretty good to me :]|`|StOvl9mVaa	You sing..well..okay. But not perfect.  You should get singing lessons.  But you aren't bad, not at all.|`|XDccNmY8aa	you're certainly not bad, i think if you got a singing coach and tried to project your voice more you'd be reeeally good.|`|0BzQxgTvaa	your good  if you got a bit more practice, u could be amazing:)

tYvf7YK6aa	The other night dear, as I lay sleeping  I dreamed I held you in my arms  But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken  So I hung my head and I cried.    You are my sunshine, my only sunshine  You make me happy when skies are gray  You'll never know dear, how much I love you  Please don't take my sunshine away    I'll always love you and make you happy,  If you will only say the same.  But if you leave me and love another,  You'll regret it all some day:    You are my sunshine, my only sunshine  You make me happy when skies are gray  You'll never know dear, how much I love you  Please don't take my sunshine away    You told me once, dear, you really loved me  And no one else could come between.  But not you've left me and love another;  You have shattered all of my dreams:    You are my sunshine, my only sunshine  You make me happy when skies are gray  You'll never know dear, how much I love you  Please don't take my sunshine away    In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me  When I awake my poor heart pains.  So when you come back and make me happy  I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame.    You are my sunshine, my only sunshine  You make me happy when skies are gray  You'll never know dear, how much I love you  Please don't take my sunshine away

Tons of songs have the word find in them.|`|xFP34JrPaa	I don't know if your looking for one particular song or a list of songs that have the word 'find' in the lyrics.    Anyway, here's one:  "You Find Out Who Your Friends Are," by Tracy Lawrence
hJP9y6kjaa	Some people professionally compose the music, ie "make beats" only... ie the Neptunes.    Some people write songs and sell them to other people - those are professional songwriters, ie Tin Pan Alley.    As far as I know, there is not a market for people who only write lyrics, except the artists themselves, and that's often only the case for artists who write their own music as well. Many rappers, even, will either collaborate with someone else on beat-creating or at least get a basic beat on their own that a producer might take and refine or modify or remix/remaster.

W9yYRCfvaa	Lemme go through it,    Introduction explains your aim for the assignment, and what you plan to do.    Results are the answers (in your case, your answers for which lip gloss brand stayed on the longest?)  (This is the heart of the scientific paper, in which the researcher reports the outcomes of the experiment!)    The conclusion is the part of the essay or assignment or project or essay etc, where you END.  You close your work with this.  Start off with "In conclusion..." then go on to write what you learn't in the experiment and how you were able to show your results and proof.    Introduction - start  Results - Middle  Conclusion - end.    Hope that helped at least a little bit.    |`|bankzwwYaa	Results are the actual data you recorded..

SFzQpCWtaa	The smoke on the island is a living, almost breathing entity and swirls around in the jungle tearing up trees, and generally striking fear into the hearts of the Islanders who encounter it. The smoke has made periodic appearances, with its first appearance (unseen) when a loud noise and the crashing of palm trees is heard from the jungle. It also has the ability to project images of someones past. Both Ben and Juliet claim to know nothing about the Monster, but Ben was able to "summon" it to attack the mercenaries attacking the Barracks.    On the fifth day on the Island Locke ventures in the jungle to hunt boar, and finds himself face to face with the monster. Later, during Season One, in Exodus II, while Locke, Jack, Hurley, and Kate are carrying the dynamite they found at the Black Rock, the monster appears. As they carefully make their way back through the jungle, the smoke Monster descends upon Locke and he falls to the ground. The Monster pulls him through the jungle and into a hole, and after a nasty tug of war, Kate releases the Monster's hold on Locke by throwing dynamite down the hole. Before this whole chapter, Danielle Rousseau said that it was the Island's security system.In Season Two, we get an even better look at the smoke Monster in The 23rd Psalm, when it actually develops a recognizable face. Charlie and Mr. Eko are in the jungle and Mr. Eko has an encounter with the smoke and through it we see multiple images of his past.    After seventy-one days on the Island, Eko is called to be judged by his brother, and while he's on the jungle the smoke appears near him multiple times, and almost engulfs him in the moment when Locke arrives. After Eko refuses to confess to his brother Yemi, the smoke grabs him and violently murders him.    After the barracks are attacked, Ben enters his secret room, sealing himself. He entered another room, with a door covered in hieroglyphics. Later, he comes out, covered in dust. A rumbling is heard, and the Monster appears, much larger than ever seen before. It also has lightning-like flashes emitting from inside the smoke. It enters the tree line, attacking the mercenaries. They fire at the Monster, but it does no damage to it. The Monster seems to cover the entire area, coiling like a snake.           So far the Smoke Monster has claimed several victims including:    The Pilot of the Plane   Mr. Eko   Several mercenaries who attacked the Barracks.|`|dASHruataa	Too late.  You arrived too late.  Nothing was eating anyone.|`|xYTagSIyaa	There were two monsters that were semi identified, one was a polar bear that they killed and the other was the smoke monster.  There is a chance it was a dinosaur as it very much sounded like one and as we know the island does move through time.  To this time, in season five we still know very little.  Like how did the polar bear really get there, assuming anything is real?  Could it have gotten there from an ice age, or was it a Darma experiment, as they had assumed.|`|U8aXa8xEaa	I hate to be the one to tell you this, but it's the beginning of season 5 now and they still haven't answered that question yet.  They just call it "the smoke monster"  It's just a column of smoke that seems to have a life and mind of it's own.  I think that probably won't get answered until the end of the show in season 6.|`|qriUKbjIaa	It's a black smoke monster.

X6Pvot2Saa	1. yeah he's hot  2.i Guess he would... but i looove him as jasper  3.NO DAKOTA FANNING FREAKING SUCKS  4.i'm switzerland but i kinda lean more towards the wolves :)|`|BCu8rER4aa	1)maybe  2)shes perfetc for the role,..IF and only IF shes not that famous  3)all the way into the vampires!|`|4Zxjx9dlaa	maybe    NO    both|`|05hpALwFaa	NO NO NO NO NO NO NO.  Edward can only be robert pattinson.  ONLY.  And team werewolf :)  Sorry|`|MmyOgpO0aa	1) No. Rob Pattinson plays a great Edward. I like Jackson Rathbone though, he suits playing Jasper.    2) Dakota Fanning will be excellent as Jane. Plus it will add star power to New Moon.    3) I'm a bit more on the Vampire side...don't want to say anymore in case you haven't read all the books ;)|`|nTTPZXvoaa	1. yes i think he's hot but he wouldn't make a good edward cullen he would be good for something even better  2. i think dakota will be cool if she played jane   3. i'm on the vampire side i dont know why but i dont like werewolves|`|ifYOXajoaa	1. Yes, i like this. lolz    1.Do you think Jackson Rathbone would be a good Edward Cullen: I don't know if i can answer that. I think anyone can play Edward Cullen , but not look like him. EDWARD CULLEN IS HOTT!!!!    2.What do you think about Dakota Fanning playing Jane: I think she might , MIGHT , be okay it depends if she can have the attitude forJane, because Jane in New Moon is like mean, and rude. But it depends she is getting older and might be okay for that part. (MAYBE)    3. Who's side are you on? Werewolf or Vampire?  Uh Vampire!!..... LoL. Edward is a hottie. LoL. And i love all the other Vampires in the Cullen Family, Alice, Carlisle, Esme, Emmett, Jasper, and Rosalie!!    I like all of the Cullen Family. ESPEACILLY Edward........... LoL|`|BepmhQEyaa	1)no  2)no  3) while reading new moon you cant help but kinda start liking jacob and the werewolves. but only cos the cullens arent there. vampires all the way.|`|GNtWomekaa	1) No, Jackson potrays Jasper so well and it would be a shame to get anyone else. Edward is very good too.  2) I think it's okay, i like it better than the idea of who's playing Leah Clearwater...  3) Bit of both, but i simply love the Cullens. I love Jacob's free soul and how Bella can be herself. Edward is protective but caring and loving.     I agree with you, Jasper is HOT!

BRXg8Mcpaa	I think this was a live performance that was tacked on to a B-Side at some point.  I downloaded tons of his stuff after I saw him on Conan O'Brien in 2003, and that was one of the songs I found.  I haven't seen it on an album yet.|`|pRz0Umhraa	It's not on an album, but you can find live performances of it on archive.org

hKQQhgFMaa	Jimmy Page once said the song was about a narcissistic woman .|`|YLZp5FBDaa	in one word . ...    acid  .drugs  i think this because of the lyrics and of the time era it was made in
D2WLPK0gaa	Me too, I love him so much! & Btw, a true JB fans loves them all... even Frankie     I think he's a sweet, caring, HOTT, talented guy and whoever is dating him is soooo damn luckyy!  Joe and Nick are more popular, I guess its because they sing more. But without Kevin, the Jonas Brothers wouldn't be as awsome!    ? Peace.Love.JONAS|`|K2umerZ0aa	yeah! like all of my friends say he's the worst, cuz all he does is stand there and play the guitar, also they think he's wayyy not as good-looking.... personaly, i think joe is the best! ;-) ? lol but it isn't fair about what people think of kevin... :-)  lol  ...!|`|mINKANlAaa	hes pretty awesome! :)|`|LRLu1ofNaa	He's better than his brothers, but they all suck.|`|N6cuuDAmaa	I know! Kevin is awesome! I love all three Jonas' equally!!!|`|FYT97XLgaa	He's really sweet! I like him he is soooo cute! People think he is gay that's just sad cuz he's not!!      BTW...most guys think poor Kevin is gay...talk about *awkward*...|`|0Dv91Ymnaa	They all suck.|`|BuJClF3Faa	Do I REALLY have to answer this?  He is outshined by his brothers, of course. Doesn't it make you wonder how close they all actually are? I don't the Jonas Brothers or any Disney generated commercial crap. The only thing I love about them is how much I'd LOVE to let my scissors loose on their hair...|`|iz8hh0vNaa	I love him.  In my opinion he seems the most approachable of the three.    He's always smiling, even though I'm sure that everyone seems to love his brothers more than him.  But he keeps a smile on and still manages to walk out the door, buy some Starbucks and perform in front of thousands almost every night, even when tonnes of people call him ugly.  I think it's cruel.    Also he must be sexy to have made it into People Magazine's "Sexiest Man Alive" issue.    Kevin is awesome, no need to hate him, without him, there is no Jonas Brothers.  I'm sure haters would love that, but I know the fans wouldn't.    Also, even if Kevin was gay, would that change the fact that he is who he is?  If a fan stopped liking him because of that, it just goes to show who's not a true fan.  What's wrong with someone's sexuality?  Last time I checked, it didn't matter.  So stop with calling celebrities you dislike so much gay.  Because even if they were of are, it DOESN'T MATTER.|`|SUOc7p35aa	I know i like him too.   Kevin your AWSOME!.   I think they are all great!|`|vwTyihvvaa	Jonas Brothers, ew!|`|oDx3Jgdcaa	hes mean. once in a concert, a girl went on stage and hugged  him and he started spinning around in circles...kind of funny but he made a fool of himself, he just shouldve ignored the girl and kept on playing the guitar, and let big rob handle it, thats what nick did|`|km1vuLUzaa	ugly   old   unattractive|`|1jfdJJrOaa	the jonas brothers. no.|`|dWvBhfvWaa	He seems really sweet and cool but his brother appeal to younger girls more because there hot he seems more like a really cool parent in the group|`|NviqYy6Xaa	the oldest one? (with the afro) i think hes the only one whos actually got a serious girlfriend. I know its so sad that the brothers get all the spotlight|`|d7b8f18c89ed9f003ea45f3b4aeb20ceaa	hesss sweeet.     i feel bad cuz everyone likes Joe & Nick.  if they were real fans they'd like them all.    I like them all equally.  they're amazinnnng    FRANKIES THE  1 JOBRO THOUGH.  lol hes adorable|`|LXSiqWPJaa	i think your right kevin does get outshined by his brothers but he is still my favorite|`|RI1brp91aa	Kevin's cool, he's nice I guess.     He's the only jonas brother who is totally pure and will stay pure.    Trust me, I know miley cyrus real personal NEW myspace (not gonna tellyou) but uhm...well everything is not what it seems. Kevin is cool tho.|`|Aabo2WP7aa	If you wanna know my true opinion, I think he's gay.  Not saying it as a bad thing though. I just think he is.

The Happy Song by Liam Lynch. (If I had a theme song, that wuld be it.)|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	White & Nerdy by Weird Al|`|Tg6ySuUOaa	rock & roll by eric hutchinson    seriously its amazing!|`|MuLaZcS2aa	Fin by Anberlin, It has a religious tone to it but for some reason i can relate to it, kind of like the song applies to a lot more about life than the lyrics may appear to.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEtLasb8U...    A nice easy song for the guitar is Sunday Drive by The Early November|`|NCy5Oj0jaa	It's not exactly a rock song but it's one of the songs that I relate to the most  I'm Okay by Christina Aguilera    daddy please  i'll kill you little girl    mhmm  once upon a time  there was a little girl   in her in the years   she had to learn   how to grow up in a war  she called hoem  never noticed where to look for shelter  from a storm  hurt me to see my mothers face  everytime my fathers fist   would but her in her place  hearing all the yelling  I would cry up in my room  hoping it would be over soon    Chours:  bruises fade father  but the pain remains the same  and I still remeber   how you kept me so afraid  the strength is my mother  for all the love she gave  every morning that I wake  I look back to yesterday  and I'm okay    half the window wide  I've carried all this skin  when it's you that helped me   put together these wall that I built  shadows stir at night through a crack in the door  th echos of a broken child  screamign please no more    Chorus:    brusies fade father  but the pain remains the same  and I still remember how   you kept me so..  so afraid  the strength is my mother   for all the love she gave  every morning that I wake   I look back to yesterday  and I'm okay    It's not so easy to forget   all the rocks in her life  are known as dad  when I was thrown   against cold cement   now everyday I'm afraid  to come home fear   of what i might see     Chorus:  bruises fade father  but the pain remains the same  and I still remeber how you kept me so afraid  the strength is my mother   for all the love she gave  every moring that I wake   I look back to yesterday  and i'm Okay   mhmm   I'm okay       it really is an amazing song       Hospital by The Used   This feeling never leaves you alone   You pull the trigger on your own   You're hiding in your safe place   Hiding with your eyes shut tightly   on the way to the hospital.    Now will you ever rest your head?   You end up feeling mostly dead,   Pretending you're the last one,   Hiding with your eyes shut tightly,   all the way to the hospital.    Before I cross my heart and hope to die at all   Take off my mask and leave the lies to the liars      It never used to hurt before it isn't funny anymore   Feeling so alone now,   Funny how you wish some way that you could die at the hospital     You're quiet on the car ride home,   You're waiting for your head to explode   You're hiding in your safe place   Hiding with your eyes shut tightly   all the way to the hospital     Oh, oh, i don't feel okay,  I don't feel alright  I don't know!    Before I cross my heart and hope to die at all   Take off my mask and leave the lies to the liars   Before I close my eyes I'm gonna give it up   Take off my mask and leave the lies to the liars  leave the lies to the liars     Will you look them in the face   Could you look me in the face   Three cheers you fooled them all   Come on now, Hip Hip Hooray x2  Hip hip hooray    Before I cross my heart and hope to die at all   Take off my mask and leave the lies to the liars   Before I close my eyes I'm gonna give it up   Take off my mask and leave the lies to the liars  leave the lies to the liars  leave the lies to the liars  leave the lies to the liars  leave the lies to the liars  leave the lies to the liars|`|DhSw53Claa	i miss you-blink 182    hear you me-jimmy eat world

PF6yKkVDaa	When I lived with my parents I'd just lie my *** off. Say it's a local band or something, and not mention the band name or think of a less offensive sounding name. Although if that doesn't work you could just beg or find a way to go without telling them. Not that I support lying to your parents or doing things behind their backs. If you really want to go you can find a way.|`|GG8x2kmfaa	Wow, that really sucks. I really don't know what to tell you. I used to have the same problem.. But what are you thinking! Asking your mom to go to a Cannibal Corpse concert! OF COURSE she'd yell at you and say no. Soo.. I guess you can just tell her that it's not gonna be all gory and stuff. I mean its Opeth and Enslaved... It's gonna be an amazing concert..

cw2KARcPaa	Dexter was picked up for two more seasons. This is really exciting, but I hope the show returns to more of a dark thing...    It should start in the fall of this year. Shows on cable have a tendency to follow their own schedule for the seasons. Some Showtime or HBO shows are summer/fall runners while others are winter/spring runners. Right now we have the United States of Tara (a winter/spring thing) while Californication, Dexter, and True Blood are summer/fall things. This ensures that there will always be someone watching their shows!    Non-subscription cable channels do the same thing too, which is why Project Runway, Psych, Doctor Who, Mythbusters, and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (among others) are not all on at the same time and only during certain times of the year. Its a great way to avoid reruns!    Season 3 should be out on DVD in July or August, just in time to watch the entire season again before the new episodes start.

xYTagSIyaa	Assuming that all that is going on is reality.  When Ben moved the giant wheel, he was banned from the island and sent back and lands in the desert of Tunisia where I guess he finds his way to California and finds the 6.  All this is what appears to have happened but we may find out different later.  The real question I would ask and may yet is; if Ben is on the boat with the 6 going back to the island, what will happen to him, since he was banned from the island for turning the wheel?|`|99hfFssXaa	he went down in the Orchid thing and went into that cold cave with a big wheel.  He then turned that big wheel and when the island vanished into the water, he woke up in Africa somewhere|`|U8aXa8xEaa	We don't know what happened exactly.  He turned this giant underground wheel to move the island.  There was a flash of blinding light.  Then he wakes up lying in a desert in Tunisia on a different date than when he left.    One of the many twists and turns on LOST.  lol|`|GBKaftrJaa	Ben was upset that Jacob preferred John Locke to him.  And Jacob gave Jack's father, Christian Shepherd, the message to tell John to move the island.  John came out of the cabin and told Ben he had to move the island. And Ben was mad because he said he was the only one that knew how to do it so Jacob told John just to make Ben do it and that now Ben would never be able to come back to the island again.    To move the island they had to go down to the orchid station, put everything metal in that chamber that said never put anything metal in it. Then Ben ran it. It exploded making a hole in the wall.  Ben then sent John back to find the Others.  Ben went through the hole, down some old metal stairs that fell apart causing him to fall and get his shoulder cut.  He then had to break ice off the big wheel and turn it.    The next place he was seen in those clothes, and with his shoulder cut was in the Tunisian desert as people said.  I'm pretty sure he took his passports and money with him when he went so he wouldn't have had too  much trouble getting back to wherever he wanted to be except the island.|`|LBovv7Sxaa	Jacob had Jack and Claires dad, Christian Shepherd, relay a msg to  Locke to move the island.  Ben says he will do it because he is the only one who knows how to, and Locke has been chosen to be the new leader of the Others (aka Hostiles).    Locke and Ben go down into the hidden Dharma Hatch, the Orchid.  Ben loads metal objects into a time machine that was built over a pocket of negativly charged matter.    the back of the time machine blows out, revealing a ladder that leads to an ice covered room.     Inside this room is a frozen donkey wheel.  Ben breaks away the ice and turns the wheel.  He instantly wakes up in the deserts of Tunisia in Sept of 2005 (approx 9 months after the oceanic 6 got off the island).|`|BtK9nSalaa	when he went down to the Orchid station he turned the wheel to move the island and thought he'd land somewhere cold so he put that jacket on and everything but ended up landing in the desert  try 2 pay a little more attention  :)|`|zUUDmVbbaa	Turning a big wheel.|`|AA10517735	he turns the big wheel in the freezing cold underground room, and wakes up in the tunisian desert.|`|f63ba71f316e8a0101a83d2986ff5c54aa	He moved to the New Series FOUND,.|`|dASHruataa	When he turned the wheel and moved the island, he ended up in the desert in Africa.

GNtWomekaa	I love Taylor. Part of the reason they didn't want him was because of his shape. But he's SO muscly now: http://www.hisgoldeneyes.com/index.php?s...  I'm looking forward to New Moon. You're right, he was nice in Twilight, but in New Moon he becomes aggressive at the same time, i can't wait!  If they get rid of him i'll be pissed, Taylor is perfect!|`|kXxaUnSUaa	I'm glad Taylor will be in New Moon but he still looks kind of young & small to play Jacob. However, he is shaping up very well for New Moon. Check this clip on YouTube:    http://ie.youtube.com/watch?v=_oyLRN2P2t...|`|ZG9zdEVaaa	Woohoo:) I think he did really good for 'young' Jacob. He's bulking up for wolf Jacob so I think he'll do fine. Just guess we have to wait until November.*sigh*|`|4Zxjx9dlaa	i think he was good in twilight. just a lot of people cant see him as jacob because of shark boy and lava girl. this shows he is a great actor because he is diverse.  i think he is officially going to be jacob again in new moon.|`|MmyOgpO0aa	Taylor will be a great Jacob. I think he wasn't so great in Twilight, but I think that was the dodgy wig. In New Moon he cuts his hair though so that'll be interesting.     He's a good Jacob because he's still got those boyish good looks, and he can't look too much older because he has to be younger than Bella.|`|QVC6sxtJaa	Do You want to Know why they wanna change jacob its because in the book jacob strong and in the movie jacob doesn't look strong..

dDDAbqqhaa	check out imdb or wikipedia for info.|`|vmbq8s6Oaa	so she gets out of the mental hospital & thinks dads new gf killed her mom. when REALLY anna was going to kill her dad & rachel, when she accidentally killed her mom & alex. but in her mind, she made it seem like rachel did it & that her sister was still alive, when really, her sister died the night of the fire. if you look back at the movie, you realize no one actually talked to alex, so it was all in annas imagination. and she made her self believe that rachel was really 19 year old margret kemp, when really, it was just a story she made in her mind. margaret kemp was only the girl next to her in the mental hospital, and SHE was the one who killed the 3 kids, NOT rachel. rachel is actualy a good person, but anna killed her, but she thought alex killed her. then at the end she's sent back to the mental hospital. hope that helps, it confused me too for a while!  ALSO, anna filled her mind with the stories of mildred kemp, and she got it in her mind that RACHEL was mildred kemp. and her therapist said to "finish what she started", & when she accidentally killed her mom & alex, she meant to kill rachel & her dad. so she wouldn't stop until she finished killing rachel, who really wasn't bad, and only had needles to calm her down since she was a nurse.|`|hWp64ttAaa	omg. i saw it lastnight too!!! :D  but it was veryveryvery confusing!!  i didn't really get it at all, but it was still good. :D|`|IL9GiaWBaa	i just got home from seeing that movie.  i dont really understand either!  like....  ughh i think that the girl from the crazy house.(i know her last name was kemp)  told anna to go and kill rachel bc she was jealous that rachel took her husband.    and somehow she got it in her head that her sister was alive..      ughh! idk...|`|yRRKtG2qaa	i watched it last night as well. Loved it but very confusing.     I didnt get it either but ppl on youtube explained it 2 me.      Anna is the one who actually kills her mom and sister on accident. Her mom is in the boathouse sick and Alex is going 2 follow Anna but Alex and Annas mom calls Alex back in. Anna had left the gas thing on (she was going 2 burn down the house cuz her dad and Rachel were in it) and idk what really happened at that part i think it got invoved with a candle. The boathouse explodes killing Alex and the girls' mom. Anna is crazy, so in her mind she pictures Rachel evil when she actually isnt. Anna thinks Rachel is Mildred Kemp. She also imagines Alex, who died in the fire along with her mother. It turns out Rachel was never evil and she never wanted 2 kill Anna. Anna also kills Matt, her ex bf by pushing him off a cliff. She did that cuz he knew everything that happened the night of the fire. Anna made herself believe that Rachel was evil, but she was innocent. Anna was the guilty one. She imagined Alex killing Rachel, but it was really Anna who killed her. Her dad explains that she was imagining Alex the whole time. Anna gets mad at her dad, and ends up arrested 4 killing Rachel. Anna thought that Mildred Kemp was the one who killed her mom, but it was really Anna herself. The 3 kids that were shown in the movie were murdered by Mildred Kemp. Rachel didnt lie about her name. The girl who was with Anna in the beginning was Mildred Kemp. Anna's physchiartrist (can spell sorry) said u must finish what u started and at the end Anna tells him I finished what I started meaning she killed Rachel. Alex and Rachels personality was all in Annas mind.    Sorry this is so long I didng get it either at first.    Hope I helped!

ZyGyDLsDaa	I don't know if this is from Lifetime, but it's the only thing that comes to mind right now:  The Children of Times Square (1986 TV movie)  starring Howard E. Rollins Jr., Joanna Cassidy, David Ackroyd, Jason Bernard, Danny Nucci, Brandon Douglas, Griffin O'Neal (Ryan O'Neal's son and Tatum's brother),  De'voreaux White, Ami Dolenz (Monkee Mickey Dolenz's daughter), Joe Spinell  IMDb synopsis:  A 14-year-old boy runs away from his uncaring stepfather. Ultimately he lands in Time Square and is taken in by a Fagin-like cocaine dealer. The dealer introduces him to a band of homeless teens and initiates his training along with another youth. Meanwhile the youth's mother begins a feverish search for the boy.    Right now, that's the only one I know of that is about a boy runaway. It seems that most are about girls. I checked out a bunch of other titles, but none of them are set in New York City~except the one I suggested. I'll keep looking.

Hm. Not sure I've heard of them.  Or Poco...  or Firefall  Little River Band's "Reminiscing" is okay, and this dude, John Farnham (sp?) he's from the band and his solo 90's hit is "You're The Voice" and that song is awesome! ;]  Boz Scaggs-I know his joints, he's okay.

211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	YES!  And its not just authority, but everyone.  Authority is the worst!  For example.. I went to the doctor the other day - He was a new pain management doc I was trying out.  My primary doc got tired of seeing how much back and neck pain i was in all the time, he prescribed a Duragesic Pain patch.  When I told the new pain management doc about this, he said, "Well, when you run out of those, you may as well go shoot some heroin because that's essentially what you are doing and you are causing the same amount of brain damage!"  I was so appalled, but do you think I stood up to this azz??  NO!  I just sat there and took it!!    I wish I was still a rebellious teenager and did not let authority figures intimidate me, otherwise this story may be ending a whole lot different!!  And if anyone has any suggestions on how to get my "balls" back - feel free to email me!!|`|6b7773b52762fcb851c58734843a6589aa	Even idiots intimidate me.|`|PpWosZsIaa	Nope|`|XTExSyv5aa	No should it?|`|UjPArJZ6aa	Yes.

gIlhHDyKaa	Try to keep your heater at about 18-20C and turn it off when you're out. Also, insulate your house and seal air leaks to reduce heat loss. Switching off any unused appliances (spare computers, Hi Fi's etc) at the wall will save you at least 10% off your electricity bill. Energy-saving light bulbs (CFLs) are a little more expensive than standard bulbs, but will last up to 10 times longer with a 50% better efficiency rate.|`|5qFmukWwaa	Lower the heater at night (sleep with a blanket) and while you are away. When you are home, consider a sweatshirt instead of raising the temp.  Naturally, turn off anything you are not actually using.  Ask your utility company if they have different rate plans.|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	I have found that I save a little if I lower the thermostat,, and dress warmer...I have also found the way the economy is today, when we can save on one thing, another thing goes up, so we are damned either way.|`|3MB1Wsdaaa	Assume you have electric heat so yeah it would lower your costs-don't turn it down below 50 though cause then you have to worry about your pipes freezing.

She's been looking like a queen in a sailor's dream   and she don't always say what she really means.  Sometimes I think it's a shame when I get feeling better, when I'm feeling no pain. Sometimes I think it's a shame when I get feeling better, when I'm feeling no pain.    I can picture every move that a man could make, getting lost in her loving is your first mistake. Sundown, you better take care if I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs.  Sometimes I think it's a sin when I feel like I'm winning, when I'm losing again.     I can see her looking fast in her faded jeans, she's a hard loving woman, got me feeling mean. Sometimes I think it's a shame when I get feeling better, when I'm feeling no pain.

UV6osJh8aa	No, but Paul Atreides is Muadh Dib.  Means "the mouse", and it is also a constellation visible from Arakkis.  They named him the mouse because the mouse, though small, is wise in the ways of the desert.    Muadh Dib became a great leader among the Fremen, and led them in a rebellion against the cruel Harkonnens, who killed his father and forced him into exile.

So maybe i am an Aquarius at heart (Moon in Aquarius).|`|bdfk2d49aa	Fire: 31.7%   Earth: 28.7%  Air: 6.1%  Water: 33.6%    "The predominance of Water signs indicates high sensitivity and elevation through feelings, JC. Your heart and your emotions are your driving forces and you can't do anything on Earth if you don't feel a strong affective charge (as a matter of fact, the word "feeling" is essential in your psychology). You need to love in order to understand, and to feel in order to take action. It may be detrimental to your vulnerability and you should learn to fight against it.    JC, Fire is dominant in your natal chart and endows you with intuition, energy, courage, self-confidence and enthusiasm! You are inclined to be passionate, you assert your willpower, you move forward, and come hell or high water, you achieve your dreams and your goals. The relative weakness of this element is the difficulty to step back or a kind of boldness that may prompt you to do foolish things.    Air is under-represented in your natal chart, with only 6.07% instead of the average 25%. Air symbolizes the values of communication, exchanges with others, but also adaptability and flexibility abilities: if you don't get out of your cocoon to talk, to show interest in others and to socialize, you may have problems understanding others. Because of your lack of flexibility or of your refusal to adapt yourself, you may be suddenly overwhelmed by events. You should get into the habit of talking, of phoning, of thinking in terms of "mobility, flexibility, adaptability, change" in every circumstance. It will spare you so many troubles!"|`|9CCtt077aa	I got:    37% Air  33,7% Fire  14,7% Water  14, 6% Earth    Yes, it does suit me somewhat. I'm a Leo (with an Aries moon), but I'm definitely more similar to the air signs.  I have several important planets in air signs (Gemini Venus, Mars Libra), and obviously they matter. lol    I'm not a temperamental person, but I  can be -  if I'm provoked. Yeah, I guess I have all the elements represented well in my chart. Not necessarily a bad thing. :)|`|ErN3pbTeaa	I have 6 earth (Sun, Venus, Saturn, Neptune, Uranus, Ascendant)  3 water (Mars, Pluto, chiron)  2 air (Mercury, Jupiter)  1 fire (Moon)    so 50% earth  25% Water  16% Air  8% Fire    I agree with it quite a bit. I'm quite level headed, relaxed, "down to earth", practical, and all of those earthy qualities. My other parts come out under certain circumstances.|`|369vsqhgaa	Earth-66.8%  Air-2.6%  Water-30.5%  Fire-I have no fire signs in my chart    I am a pisces sun and moon with taurus rising.It is not really like me all that much but i must admit parts of the interpretation are like me a bit|`|8ZUVToXgaa	I don't feel like signing up but I would like to know. :P|`|eVt0qkT8aa	I agree with what it says - I'm 38.7 earth,  40.5 water, and 20.8 air. I have no fire at all, so I'm not that enthusiastic.|`|uel6NBOVaa	My dominant element is Air, and I am predominant in Water. I do find that I am often conflicted between thinking and feeling. I am quite sensitive and deep, but still communicative and mental on the surface.     I don't lack any of the elements, I still have fire and earth, but to a lesser degree. Though I don't feel that I lack those elements, I think that I have enough influences to balance me out. I can be very grounded and stable, and with my Mars conjunct Sun and Ascendant I can certainly be firey. My ruling planet Venus is in Sagittarius, so that adds to the fire influence, and I have my MC in Leo.     Libra Sun/Rising/Mercury/Mars  Cancer Moon and Jupiter  Sagittarius Venus/Leo Midheaven  Capricorn Saturn|`|S2uAq7i4aa	Fire..  I got 5 fire signs,1 air,2 water and 2 Earth.    edit - I got   48.7 percent fire.  18.9 percent Earth.  20.9 percent water.  and 11.5 percent air!    Eden, Fire is dominant in your natal chart and endows you with intuition, energy, courage, self-confidence and enthusiasm! You are inclined to be passionate, you assert your willpower, you move forward, and come hell or high water, you achieve your dreams and your goals. The relative weakness of this element is the difficulty to step back or a kind of boldness that may prompt you to do foolish things.

I feel what others feel and im a hopeless romantic / artist but thats about it. I act like an aries more than pisces. I guess im more of a fighter than lover lol. I agree with what it said and how my birth chart is. I def have a lot of fire in me =]|`|B7WIZdglaa	I'm 35% Fire- which dominates. I guess I do agree w/it! It's weird cuz Air is my least dominant.. and I'm obviously an aqua, haha. Interesting..|`|872fcc76954a83920779a9df510b118baa	My dominant element is Air and my dominant planet is PLuto  :)  sigh    yeah I agree with it mostly...  if I didn't know more about my chart rulers then I probably wouldn't at all however.  I've read my Gemini description and it just feels there is a lot more to it.  I'm not the most outwardly communicative person you have ever met.  I am an attention seeker with a tendancy to change my personality or appearance often.  SO that is a lot like Gemini... and my life has generally been very confusing to me that as well......  I'm always asking tons of questions.    edit:  hey my chart also has a lot of air and fire in it.  ha put air and fire togther and you get a super fire.  so i understand why you say you feel you have temper issues.  I have had anger issues as well, violent nightmares and stuff that just freaked me out happen in life.  it helped me to go with the flow of it and try to work through it.  you can tap into your water parts (and earth) by meditating before you sleep, do something you find extrtememly interesting that you have never done before like a crazy craft or dance class that you have been meaning to take.

Perhaps they will be bold, fiery. They may initiate change for you, or make your life move forward or stimulate activity in your life.  You should also take into account the house that juno falls in and the aspects it makes to other planets.|`|AA11899483	i read that juno conjunct someones venus or mars is hott! so maybe someone with venus or mars in aries. . .|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I would not say Juno is TOO important. Your Moon, Mars, and Venus are way more important.     My Juno is in Virgo and I'm certainly not attracted to Virgo men.|`|9B6Om8oDaa	Suggest you should get a full horoscope check and not go by just Juno sign. That will explain how compatible you are.

84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Juno in Aries:    You have a strong need for autonomy in relationship, and if this need is frustrated, there may be outbursts of anger or physical reactions such as migraine headaches. May be attracted to dominant or aggressive type individuals.

01d9f7d86b08b714b8ed46b41571cfdaaa	The latter, we are very emotional.   To apologize to a scorpio, well, that's a bit difficult.  You have to be sincerely sorry, or else it's just a lie that you give them to get the blame off of you.  We can tell when someone is not sincere.  Also, if an apology is given too often, the scorpio may begin to question whether or not the apology is true. It may also help to find the cause of the incident, and try to fix that as well as apologizing (ie, if the scorpio in question wants you to pay more attention to him/her, but gets angry because of something small, apologizing and then going away won't help at all).   good luck, we aren't exactly the easiest of people to deal with.|`|872fcc76954a83920779a9df510b118baa	Seriously.....  don't do a Scorpio wrong.  you know if you don't agree with a persons way of being you don't need to pretend to be their friend.|`|8rF3wAHtaa	I guess it depends on what you are sory for. We are very emotional and can take awhile to get over something, we are good at dwelling and sometimes plotting revenge. Most importantly you need to acknowledge what it is that you've done and show that you are sorry through actions, not just words. We are very intuitive and read people very well.|`|MrQ3MwRzaa	do something sweet for them, and if you know something about hem that you only know about them, give it to them, or sth like that. Something special.|`|d2uGruHiaa	Honestly, I'm with a Scorpio- I'm a Capricorn and I think the best way to apologize is to not say sorry, because obviously s/he is mad, but just make the best of it by doing something sweet and nice or reward him/her with sex or something, since they are so sexually passionate, lol.|`|edgUEhTqaa	Im a Scorpio and I have to agree with some of the other answers, actions speak louder than words.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	Just be very very sincere. Scorpios have intense emotions.|`|eVt0qkT8aa	I can't really say that they are emotional, it's just that Scorpio's hold on to their feelings deeply, and those who are really hurt often revenge against whoever caused them pain. It may not be enough to apologize, because you have to be really sincere. Scorpio's, unlike Cancer, are more difficult when it comes to this type of situation and less likely to forgive as easily. They usually give the cold shoulder or cut off the relationship permanently.|`|ae1f9919ccfe928213e3b31b125b5bc3aa	have sex with them...and let them lie to you.

94zi1LFFaa	sun moon & rising for sure.. your juno sign denotes the kind of love you give & the kind you want to receive (if its in the same element as another you'll have attraction or if its in an element that the other has a strong sign in then you're good too), mercury (communication), mars (energy sexual & otherwise), venus (though as long as some of your planets connect with their venus you're good i.e. if your venus is in scorpio & they have planets in water signs... or if ones venus was in gemini and the other persons chart allows for great communication abilities...). the sign your 5th house is in can show the type of person you're most attracted to (for instance mine is in aries but i find myself very attracted to scorpio because they are both ruled by mars & I have enough water in my chart that I crave the emotional aspects of scorpio along with the sexuality that mars brings...).     as for aspects, harmonious creates a deep connection & if attraction is involved then you have a really good thing. compatible signs with challenging aspects create profound relationships where both individuals are learning & growing significantly from each other..    ~peace  ps: scorpios don't bite... they lick ;)|`|d69856882943ee44ddbbe3cb4e643f2aaa	In synastry, if your signs are compatible and your aspects challenging, then you will NOT understand each other, little less like each other, but since your signs are compatible you will have a better chance at understanding each other than if your signs were not compatible. You have the chance, but only if you work at it. It would be rewarding to understand each other in the end.     If you have bad aspects and incompatible signs, it would be very hard to understand each other, and if you ever did then you would feel weirded out, uninterested, and still as bored. Lol. You wouldn't be able to relate to the other person's way of being because the things that have shaped your life are so very different. You would just be bettwer off taking different paths, really, and letting yourselves be okay with it.    If you have good aspects, and incompatible signs, you would sort of get along. You would probably get along for a while..but in the end feel misunderstood..or like the relationship didnt fulfill your needs enough.    There is also the thing about the difference between the synastry and composite chart:    Ok, synastry is what you feel when you see someone across the room or your first impression of them when you have never talked to them yet or much before. Once you get to see each other's personalities better, each one of you will come to a middle ground on way of being that will be in response to how the other person acts. Acts..Not towards you, but acts as in their real personality...when you got to know how they are. That is what the composite chart is, a middle ground way of behaving that each of you adopt in response to knowing each other. Synastry is what you think of them before you really get to know them, composite chart is not. Basically composite chart is a picture or "natal chart" of your relationship. It describes what it's all about, and it also describes how each of those two people in the relationship feel. You will know whether you are compatible with someone not through your synastry, because as you can see, that fades pretty quickly, but through your COMPOSITE CHART.    Also, just so you know, sometimes you will have great compatibiliy indicated in your composite chart, but the person's personality a.k.a. natal chart has so many issues that means they are rude to others, overly suspicious, not faithful, sex-crazy, etc and so you will feel turned off by them and like you deserve better. Yet, you will still feel this certain something special for this person..you will feel fond of them...but you will still feel that this is not enough of a reason to be with them and that you deserve better. So, you see, the composite chart/compaitiblity isn't everything! Because, you may love someone, and they may love you, too, but you may not love their behavior! Hehe. So...You should always decide for yourself and go with your heart. Though the natal chart of that person will show whether they have problems or not....lots of squares, , lots of mars, or lots of saturn and neptune===bad thing!! Not good for a healthy lifestyle in reality.    Also, the opposite can happen! You may meet someone with a wonderful natal chart who has a terrible composite chart with you, and you will get along lovely! Not because of your compaitibility..but because that person is the way that they are, that they are able to be very flexible sympathetic and caring to have good relationships with most people, unless they are arrogant, domineering or have other big issues themselves.    Let me try to describe the difference to you...hmm..it's like...the person that you feel a certain love for, it's a very emotional feeling...non-rational. It comes straight from the heart, and you appreciate this person's most basic good qualities. When it is that their natal chart is awesome but you don't have excellent compatibility you feel like, rationally you know that this person is really good for you and will make you happy. You feel secure and comfortable being around them and being their friend because you know they are just good for you. However, the person you have that certain compatibility with, you are very susceptible to being hurt by..since it's so emotional. It can become sort of an unhealthy relationship....you have to have a very strong self esteem to know when to walk away and to not let it hurt you...it would be very hard, because the people we most love are the ones who can hurt us the most. So, my advice is that you find someone who has a great natal chart AND good compatibility with you! Then, you'll be set :) and you won't have any of those tough decisions to make down the road :)|`|rXl4VLMJaa	Venus is the most important when it comes to compatibility in astrology.

MDmURxEKaa	i think is because the girlfriend is uninvited.. like they dont like her and stuff.  (:|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	It was literally a name that they just settled for.    The movie is a "remake" of a brilliant Korean film called "A Tale Of Two Sisters".  They had several names in mind, and then settled for "The Uninvited", which really had nothing to do with the plot.    I was SO disappointed (not surprised, but disappointed) when I found out they were remaking that movie.  The put all sorts of things in the remake that weren't in the original film.  It makes the plot so convoluted that it ruins the film.  The whole thing about the other family, (the murdered kids) and the nanny, and the boyfriend are NOT in the original film at all.  The only characters in the original film are the two sisters, the father, the mother, and the "stepmother".  (And a brief appearance by the brother and sister-in-law of the "stepmother".)  They really changed a lot of it for the remake.  The original film is considered to be a masterpiece of film making.  If you're interested, you can watch "A Tale of Two Sisters" on Youtube.  Here's a link to Part 1:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6XPHHaRc...    (You can link to parts 2,3,4, etc. from there.)|`|56Kcb9kbaa	I saw it, GREAT movie but i think its called that either because rachel you know,didnt want anna there or anna didnt want rachel there.   thats what i think!|`|aKjOy0Luaa	Its the uninvited because they dont like the girlfriend|`|6OAxXpTjaa	Because when Anna was in her own psychotic world, she and her "sister" thought that Rachel was not needed here or wanted here.

I don't know how to answer this question.|`|x2rmsjIXaa	you can get more in there if you cook it first, but i'd leave it just a tad undercooked so when you take it out you can reheat it ,and it'll finish it off.|`|Usx5zMNRaa	I think it should be cooked so you can enjoy the whole day.|`|BJkfY3g4aa	Can you wrap it around some shrimp and jalapeno first?

But, if it were me, I would cook it first, so there wouldn't be so much grease leaking out when it gets hot. Also, I could just open up my briefcase and eat it, anytime I get hungry for bacon. Otherwise, I'd always have to be looking for the closest microwave.|`|c5a50631f90f4ba04d88c923dc2aa963aa	the briefcase ... cooked!|`|8RNPlSAfaa	pshh it's bacon who cares!!|`|AZTNUH08aa	cooked so that the smell of raw pork doesnt invite any attacking pigs, but if that were to happen and you had a knife, you could easily double your bacon.............its a judgement call|`|GGAgxzJNaa	Cooked.

Nothing to do but eat and eat till my stomach got big.  At least I had Yahoo answers, and anime's to watch.    Q1: why is it so addicting in Y!A?    ~ Because you get to help out other people and you feel proud of your self for helping out. Also because there are interesting questions to answer, and fun surveys to do like this one! Oh... and because I sometimes learn new things that I never knew before.     Q2: What would you do if a man suddenly approach you... after wards he hold your chin and tell you none sense things?  a) Creep out  b) Act like nothing happened then cry after wards  c) kick him  d) Be mad  e) blush  f) other_________    ~ My answer would be e) because I will be really shy to even say anything. I will blush and run like a crazy person lol. But I would be mad inside, but I would'nt show it. I will also wonder why he came to me from all the other girls. *maybe its because I am more beautiful than everybody, and my beauty caught his attention* (Kidding)     Q3: What so special about anime?  --> me... I guess the story and drawings..    ~ I also think it's special because of its drawing. It is just so unique unlike other cartoon shows. The story line is also really interesting, and when you watch one episode you have to watch more and more till you have to go to bed. I think anime's have some kind of spell that make you addicted to them (^o^)    Q4: Ok, if u & ur friend don't hang out & talk like before..... You see him/her in a mall.... but she didn't see u... Will u still approach him/her?    ~Yes I would because I think it wouldn't be nice of me to try to avoid them. If I did avoid her then I would never find out why we dont talk anymore or hang out.    Q5: Why do trolls like to bug people?    ~ Because they know that they have nothing better to do but try to rile people up. They just think it is funny, when they dont know that people think it is really annoying.    Q6: What time setting of anime do u like?  a) Future  b) Present  c) Past    ~I prefer it to be in the past.    Dont worry about it, I thought your poll was easy and fun to answer.

Q3: What so special about anime?  Everything! Usually the storyline and characters and its entertaining.      Q4: Ok, if u & ur friend don't hang out & talk like before..... You see him/her in a mall.... but she didn't see u... Will u still approach him/her?  No    Q5: Why do trolls like to bug people?

9bDNQpqJaa	What is your favorite anime/manga series? (doesn't matter how many)... and why?  >>> I love Fruits Basket! No competition! Why you ask? Because out of the 130 series I've tried (oh, yes! I counted!) it has the most colorful plot/charecters/story I've ever read. Actually, I can't even think of a novel that can rival Fruba's realism(not story wise. charecter wise)    What are your favorite characters [from your favorite series], and why?  >>>I love every single charecter in that series! But if I chose my favorite it would be Yuki! I can sympathize with him on a personal level. i went through a similar period to him, in which I felt useless, needed, unwanted, and desperate friends.

But in a different language you speak slowly. I sound horrible trying to speak english.|`|KFSmqBtaaa	Look at my username. I never really thought  about it.

W9BWY8XLaa	Firstly HIM is a pretty unique band and that is why there aren't many bands similar to them and that is why they coined their own genre; Love Metal.      The band Icon & the Black Roses is the most similar band to HIM in my opinion.  Other bands similar to HIM are...    The 69 Eyes  Lacrimas Profundere   Entwine  Tiamat  Negative  The Rasmus  Private Line  To/Die/For  Lovex  Sentenced  Poisonblack  Amorphis  Charon  For My Pain  Enemies of The Sun    A lot of Finnish bands are similar to HIM in the melancholy rock type of sense; maybe it is the culture or maybe it is the attempt to copy them in order to achieve the success HIM have had.  Anyway check those bands out!    Hope that helps!

d1f4df25e3d45f0e9e4b1146d352dae1aa	I didn't get it at first either so thank goodness I TIVO it so I went back and watched it again.    First she was talking about what happened to her at the daycare and then she went on this camping trip with her dad and she talked about how he only brought the one sleeping bag. The implication was made, he must've said things to her along the lines of sexual molestation that obviously scared her enough to leave immediately and go to a phone to call her mom.    The way this was shown on the show, it wasn't really explained properly but what I described above is what I took from the whole thing - after watching it twice.|`|HD8Cm7PSaa	She said he bought one sleeping bag on a camping trip and he tried to do things to her but she got out of there before anything happened.|`|cQXjyQUqaa	Supposedly all he did was forgot to bring another sleeping bag for her. She talked about how she got molested in a day care so maybe she was freaked out at the idea of having to share a sleeping bag with him.     She never did say he actually "did" anything to her.

TJICaGQyaa	Well Pay Pal will allow to use most sites without your credit card details, you register to current account to them instead, they act like an on-line transactional bank account.    BT's Click & Buy allows you to buy against your  BT bill, usually it's only upto 30 per month, although you may still need to register a credit card as backup, even though they should never ever need to take from it (providing you pay you BT bill of course). Limitation of this are sites that have it. Chekc site for details.    If however you are looking for way to shop online without a bank account or credit card, then look at pay as you go cards, these allow you to put cash onto a card, which then can be used as credit card, or look for prepay cards where you buy cards that you can then use in same way as any other.    That's about all I can offer, for you.  Haven't road tested all these myself, although believe all above to be correct based from information I have heard and read over past few months.

44fe68ac48e4256fe9ab6ffbd1ee8375aa	I'm bitter. The first 'meaningful' relationship of my life ended with my boyfriend cheating on me with my GOOD (haha) friend and when I had the nerve to confront him, he verbally harassed and dumped me. So, the first guy I ever loved, 8 months of my life and my trust for people is gone. Call me bitter, but I like to think it's for a good reason.|`|8Zcu55Braa	not always, there are those that love life as well|`|wSYhEREjaa	well you got it all wrong. I'm single right now and I don't want a guy to cause drama in my life. I've been there and done that. I'm just focused on life and school and my family. My friends call me dr. phil (female version) because i help them with all their guy problems. I just think its crazy when people at my age think they're "in love" and going to get married and have kids or something like that.  Sometimes girls and guys fall too fast for eachother. But i do know this couple in my school that have been together for about 2 or 3 years now. Thats a long time for a highschool relationship!    ?|`|7294c9edbf7c247468b6e48776c6fcadaa	No just don't want to face another round of divorce courts along with alimony payments and community property settlements.

QMXmJTWnaa	i think robert pattinson IS overrated because hes just playing edward cullen. he is good looking & a good actor & has a good personality like everyone thinks ... but hes too hyped like hes not edward cullen , he just plays that role. it makes me to mad when people get so excited just cuz he plays that character . & rob IS a good actor k . he shows emotion so good on his face & the right emotion that shoud be. im prettttty sure if he was a bad actor he wouldnt have big roles in the two most major movie series in the last ten years ;)|`|hqjJV70Eaa	I think that too many girls think he's Edward when he's not.  Don't get me wrong, I adore Robert but not because of Twilight.  He's a nice, goofy guy who's a kick to talk to.  He's a talented musician, actor, and writer.    It's not that he's over-rated, it's just to many girls are obsessed with Edward.|`|qGoXhhiyaa	That guy really needs to get a brush.  |`|r3sNTIvqaa	I agree with you completely.

pOjY1ESZaa	Richard Hammond because he is really funny, good looking and i feel sorry for him when the others make fun of him for being short|`|cAoJmUMIaa	jeremy|`|dKi2R2oHaa	Jeremy Clarkson. He could do the show on his own if necessary.  James May adds some colour. The Hamster whilst I like him, is a lightweight who could be easily be replaced.    I like Sabine.  They need to sign her up    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=m1pklvKKnd...    Here's the Germans take on our presenters    http://forums.finalgear.com/top-gear/dmo...    I think you can see how good the presenters are when doing other shows.     Hammonds attempts to do childrens t.v. and game shows are falling flat.     James May has done some good documentarys.      Clarkson excels and all the shows he does. I don't think I'll ever forget the way he described how his late father-in-law (Major Robert Henry Cain) won his V.C.|`|fYcYPyR3aa	Jeremy makes me laugh he so funny and Hammond, especially when they are taking the piss outta Captain Slow (James) I pmsl when I watch that show, love it.    I can't choose between Jeremy and Hammond but I don't think the show would be the same without any of them, even James. I like the Stig but he's not that great.|`|RFGGBtp5aa	jeremy clarkson as i believe he epitomises the typical 40 year old brit!!    and i love the way he always likes the opposite to what you would expect, he is a thrill seeker and i can relate to that.     i think with clarkson you either love him or hate him, as his views are always very firm and sometimes controversial.    hammond is a really nice person as is may, but clarkson makes the show what it is, take him out and the whole show would feel boring. the stig isn't a presenter though i do know he is an ex NASCAR driver for those who wonder his identity.|`|a6f1adc3e857cef18f7615f6ae435f72aa	Captain Sensible, James May. I don't know why but I'm a teeny bit in love with him.

We are facing a madman.    TheDeadpool: Hey now, you're also smacking a madman on the head! But ok, I'll stop goofing around...as much as I can, anyway.    The Shadow: *Studies Deadpool with piercing eyes* You're not quite there now, you were before though.    TheDeadpool: *shifts uncomfortably* Umm...I mean...err...umm...has anyone ever told you you're one creepy SOB?    The Shadow: *Stares a moment longer* Quite a bit actually. Usually before I leave them wounded and unconscious for the police to pick up.    TheDeadpool: Umm...well...you can't really knock me unconscious...soo....hey! Is that a Bananarama tape!? *Points fervently*    TheDeadpool (To Nightwing): I'm just trying to see what's going on. And keep Shadow from giving me that creepy look again.    Nightwing (To Deadpool): He is pretty damn creepy, huh?    The Shadow (To Nightwing and Deadpool) : Hehehehehahahahaha!!!    TheDeadpool (To Nightwing) Are you kidding me? The guy's creepier than a cemetary at midnight on Friday the 13th.  *Looks at the Shadow and gets the heebie jeebies*    Nightwing (To Deadpool) : I know, he always seems to be everywhere too.

Aquarius is my rising sun.|`|CEEQDSCFaa	same reason why you only see sun signs in your local newspaper horoscope, same as why most people only know one sign which they call star sign.. thats just how it was advertised, i dont think people will buy it on first impression when you start talking about pluto, uranus and the houses.. it just makes things much more simpler and interesting enough for them to get into

Does the answer apply to the question I asked?  2. Does the person answering have actual experience or knowledge of what they're saying, or are they just saying something to get 2 points?    Usually, after I think about the answers in terms of those questions, it's pretty clear who I'll choose for best answer.|`|u8SeGmnZaa	You will see a "Pick as Best Answer" button under my name in a little bit. Click.    That is all.|`|00CowMv3aa	wait for 4 hours|`|98kiNkgEaa	After 4 hours, go to the questions page and press the big blue bar under the answer you like.

That's to give folks a fair chance to log in and find your question. Many of us log on and off periodically during the day and we may not be online when you posted.    Once the four (4) hours have elapsed, go back to view the question. You can do that by clicking on "My Profile" near the top the page, right hand side under the word "discover."    Once you're at your profile, look under your avatar (photo) and you'll see a list of all the questions you've answered plus a tab you can click to see the questions where you were chosen as "best answer," the questions you've asked and the questions you've starred.    Click on the word questions and you'll see the list of your questions, click the question and it shows you not only the question but all the answers. There will be a blue box under each answer. Click the box of the answer you liked best. You will get 3 points for choosing.    Be sure you pick the "best answer" before the time for answering expires or it'll be too late, it'll go into voting.     IF YOU DIDN'T ASK THE QUESTION, to vote on unresolved questions click the "answer" toolbar at the top of the page then click on the "vote" tab and it'll show you a bunch of questions in voting.

Yes he is being quite ridiculous. You should try and explain to him that there are even PG13 movies which are higher than a PG rating and since you are 13, there shouldn't be any problems for a PG13 let alone PG.|`|zetxxZWUaa	In my opinion that is the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard. I mean, if he didn't want you to watch R because your 13 then i could understand but PG is like the lowest you can go, i mean, most Disney films are PG. There are very few G's out there and for the ones that are most of them suck big time.    I gotta agree with you on this, that's insane and almost unbelieveable.|`|lzVF1diNaa	that must suck. PG isn't even bad most kids movies are PG.  why doesn't he let you watch them? i mean it's not like PG movies have sex scenes in them or swearing so theres no reason why he shouldn't let you watch them.

We've all kicked back in our cubicles and suddenly felt something brew down below. As much as we try to convince ourselves otherwise, the WORK POOP is inevitable. For those who hate pooping at work, following is the Survival Guide for taking a dump at work. Memorize these definitions and pooping at work will become a pure pleasure.     ESCAPEE  Definition: a fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of panic embarrassment. This is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you did not hear it. No one likes an escapee, it is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.    JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with ESCAPEE)  Definition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should happen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.    COURTESY FLUSH  Definition: The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.    WALK OF SHAME  Definition: Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just stunk up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is best to pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH.    OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER  Definition: A colleague who poops at work and damn proud of it. You will often see an Out Of The Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with a newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look around the office for the Out Of The Closet Pooper before entering the bathroom.    THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN)  Definition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure emergency pooping goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the whereabouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE HAVENS.    SAFE HAVENS  Definition: A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.    TURD BURGLAR  Definition: A pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that can occur when taking a dump at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.    CAMO-COUGH  Definition: A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON, or to alert potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction with an ASTAIRE.    ASTAIRE  Definition: A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace.    WATERMELON  Definition: A turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.    HAVANA OMELET  Definition: A load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an Escapee. Try using a Camo-Cough with an Astaire.    UNCLE TED  Definition: A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An Uncle Ted makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you should always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees.    FLY BY  Definition: The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in and check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER. People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.|`|GgnG37moaa	4,000 and something.  lol my mom told me that and i busted out laughing  i couldnt believe i texted that much|`|c8TXAAj1aa	Like 400, even tho I have 1000.|`|pwY5jwOIaa	HAHAHAHAHA omgosh try like 28,000  I send over 2000 a day!

U8aXa8xEaa	I like the show.  I especially like that he admits that there is no such thing as psychics and explains how they work.  I know they won't answer this until the end of the show, but I want to know who Red John is.    "Lie to me" is also very good.  But LOST will always be my all time favorite.  (I saw "Lie to me" in a encore presentation.  It's on at the same time as LOST)|`|UUOG6VRoaa	Love the Mentalist! Yes, Simon Baker is very handsome. Have been a fan since day one.....|`|PjW3Yo2saa	ya.. good show..  not going as far and saying hes cute.. like the women he works with  shes hot...    just heard today.. they are picking it up for another season|`|OWXI806qaa	Yeah, I've been watching since the premier.  I like it a lot. And oh, wow yes! Patrick is very, very cute.  I love his devilish looking smile. I feel so sorry for him though.  I hope he catches RED JOHN.   Sorry no one else you know likes it.   I'm not always sure about new TV shows, but I doubt that this  one will get canceled. I hope not.

You were there and always by my side, never to leave me unlike all the others.  You were my crying towel and the only girl thats true to me.

ryLbKatoaa	I'm in a different state, one with a high asian population, so this might not work the same for you. But I can easily find manga in Japanese at Goodwill, Half-Priced Books, or at library book sales. In each case, I can buy them in decent to mint condition for less than a dollar.     But if you don't want to gamble like that (the stores are very unpredictable. Sometimes, they have amazing stuff (like original CLAMP manga in Japanese) or sometimes they just have crap or nothing at all), you can see if there's an Asian import store in your area. The manga will be $10 or more, but they'll be brand new. Anime conventions also will often have Japanese manga. It's cheaper than the import store stuff, but won't be as cheap as the used kind.|`|5Tr3DG3aaa	What made you think manga is only online? Check your local bookstore. I know for sure that Borders and Barnes and Noble carry a wide selection of manga.|`|skJCVPYfaa	Well I like to go to books stores such as barnes and nobles.

This one is interesting-- http://www.onemanga.com/directory/gender...    http://www.onemanga.com/Franken_Fran/  Franken Fren is also neat|`|Zd1Izf0paa	Clannad:    "Tomoya is labelled as a delinquent at his school because he is constantly late and skips classes, but he seems to have little care about how others perceive of him. Everything in his life seemed dull and unchanging until one morning he meets Nagisa Furukawa on the road to his school; he finds her muttering to herself to give her more motivation for the day. She has an odd habit of saying the names of foods she is going to eat to encourage herself. Nagisa has been sick for almost a year last year and subsequently has to repeat her third year of school. But now all her friends have graduated and she feels alone. For some reason, after hearing Nagisa talking to herself, Tomoya becomes interested and befriends her.  Following this meeting, Nagisa decides to revive the school's drama club. In his attempt to help by recruiting new members, Tomoya befriends several other girls at the school, two of which have their own mysterious past."    Kanon (2006):    "As a young child, Aizawa Yuuichi had often visited his cousin in the city. However, something drastic happened to keep him away for seven long years. Now, Yuuichi returns, his memories of those days are simply gone.    Settling into the wintry town, Yuuichi comes across several young girls, all of whom are connected to his past. As he befriends them and continues to interact with them, the long forgotten memories from his childhood begin to resurface..."    Both are really awesome series..hope that helps! ^^|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	~Nana  ~Beck  ~Paradise Kiss|`|8a65aa558e9ad4329fd6cecf8635eb04aa	Nana|`|W1lh6A8saa	It's my favorite anime genre!    Minami-Ke(first and second season are hilarious) Lucky Star, Azumanga Daioh(also hilarious), Honey & Clover ( beautiful storyline), and Nana!|`|cLW7vFUGaa	Well, I don't know what you've watched yet, but... Lucky Star - although just from the hair colors it looks anything but realistic - has to be the best example of slice-of-life out there. It addresses unanswerable questions that you've never thought to ask, and everyday situations that you're bound to have at one time experienced. If you can endure the first nine minutes of mealtime debate (which, though often criticized, is in my opinion incredibly entertaining), you'll get to some really great and lesser-known scenes in which it's almost impossible NOT to find a little bit of yourself in at least a few of the characters. A lot of the humor is the kind where "it's funny 'cause it's so TRUE."  Perfect example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVUSlSKLZ...    Other good slice-of-life series are Azumanga Daioh, Ichigo Mashimaro, and Minami-ke (first season especially).  I was going to add "Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei," as it IS a good show, and IS technically "slice-of-life," but... since it's a parody, the plot is crazy and scattered, the characters aren't quite as relatable, and the humor is more "it's funny 'cause it's RIDICULOUS."    Good luck finding a new show!|`|2bO7iiZdaa	Genshiken and Hourou Musuko are my favourites.|`|1vEqxzgZaa	MARS--It was like a soap opera in a book.  Hana Kimi--I loved it!  Hana Yori Dango/Boys Over Flowers--I, again, loved this!   Marmalade Boy--Very cute, and, again, like a soap opera in a book.|`|3n2o63Esaa	Strawberry Panic, Maria sama ga Miteru, Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru  (three yuri's) School Days, or Special A.    If your into drama/ romance, you will like Special A.    I haven't seen this one, but i've heard good things about it and its drama/ romance/ slice of life.  Honey and Clover  Synopsis:  Takemoto Yuuta, Mayama Takumi, and Morita Shinobu are college students who share the small apartment. Even though they live in poverty, the three of them are able to obtain pleasure through small things in life. The story follows these characters' life stories as poor college students, as well as their love lives when a short but talented 18 year old girl called Hanamoto Hagumi appears.    http://myanimelist.net/anime/16/Honey_an...    Special A  Synopsis  Hikari Hanazono, the main character, has always been second to Kei Takishima. While Hikari considers Kei a rival and somewhat of a friend, Kei loves Hikari. Everyone knows this, but she is too dense to notice. Their wrestling loving fathers first introduced them to one another when they were 6 years old. Assuming that she was the best in wrestling, young Hikari challenged Kei to a wrestling match only to be thoroughly defeated by him. Ever since that fateful incident, Hikari swore to beat Kei in school grades, a sporting event - anything. To do this she has enrolled in the same school as Kei since elementary. Now she attends Hakusenkan, an ultra elite school, that costs her carpenter father a lot of money. Hikari and Kei are the top two students in the school, with Kei holding firmly to that number one position.   http://myanimelist.net/anime/3470/Specia...    School Days  Synopsis  A shy and unconfident teenager has become very accepting at only stealing glances at a cute girl as they ride the same trolley each morning on their way to their high school. At least until Saionji Sekai surprises Itou Makoto and chances to get a peek at a photo-snap of the beautiful Katsura on his cell-phone. After evilly teasing Mokoto about his forlorn crush, Sekai offers to support him in his romance. So after many Makoto-pep-talks and lots of scheming, the three become close friends. Close enough that Makoto braves asking Katsura out on date. And she agrees. Later that day, Makoto finds a quiet moment express his thanks for all support that Sekai has offered him, and makes clear his intent on finding away to reply her kindness. But he is totally unprepared and very surprised at the reward that Sekai has chosen. Sekai steals a long kiss from his lips, before breaking away to run for the trolly. Sekai turns and wishes Makoto well on his date.  ****DO NOT READ ABOUT THE ENDING BEFORE WATCHING*****    Maria sama ga Miteru  Synopsis  Yumi is a first year student at the Lillian School For Girls, an exclusive all girl's catholic school. The school has a tradition that older girls take a younger girl as their little sister or "soeur" in order to instruct and look out for them. Though Yumi admires Sachiko, a reserved second year student who is a member of the student council, she has no hopes of being chosen as her soeur. When an innocent encounter leads Sachiko to impulsively ask Yumi to be her soeur, Yumi is suddenly brought into the inner circle of the Roses, who are the members of the student council. With Sachiko at her side, Yumi begins to unravel and understand the relationships between the Roses and their soeurs and figure out her own feelings for Sachiko.    Strawberry Panic  Synopsis  Aoi Nagisa is a first year high school student who has been sent to the Astraea Dormitory after her parents are transfered abroad. The dormitory houses girls from three different girls schools: St. Spica's Academy, St. Le Rim Girl's School and St. Miatre Girls Academy. There she meets the representative of the three girls schools, Hanazano Shizuma, also know as the Etoile, she is beloved by all the students at all the schools. The two of them have an interesting first encounter and Hanazano seems to take a instant liking for Aoi.   http://myanimelist.net/anime/855/Strawbe...    Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru  Synopsis  Mizuho can't believe his ears when Grandpa's will is read out. Grandpa's final wish is for Mizuho to attend the same academy as Mizuho's mother. The catch is it's an all-girls school. With the help of friend Mariya however, he gets a makeover good enough to fool everyone at the academy.

Just to let you know it's quite sad.|`|RnqzbRgRaa	Somebody already suggested it but...Lucky Star.

It may even have foreign language characters as subtitles. You will however be able to tell your friends you did in fact see it. Then you get one of them to take you to the movies so you can see it how it SHOULD be seen. BTW, it is an awesome movie & i do recommend seeing it in the theatre.

I like maybe three songs by them  They are way too popular though..  I've seen too many teenage girls obsessing over them.

5Ew1CuLMaa	Not bad bro, yeah i want to start a band too i just asked a question then to see if there is anyone in sydney to rock with i play electric guitar and mouth(vocals) and write fuckn mad mussic, inspirations Kurt cobain is my hero.  Song names are one of the most important things aswell and should not be taken for granted cause even a great artist wont sell if people go past the name.    Your name sounds good for like acustic or mellow type not heavy metal or grunge.  My first idea for a band name is detoxification what you think about that? i have another one i like better but i will keep that 2 myself for now.  Another idea if you dont use your own name is find your most passionate thing what your about then go to the dictionary and find an alternate meaning that sounds better.  But your name can pass on non electrical instruments or light electric guitar ok.  Peace, Luv & Unity andy  Edit yeah it can stick if your mussic is suited and good i think you should also try and find others to make a band even 1 or two instead of a cold shitty computer|`|d4b7e67e1621a19cd35c6b4fe13be84baa	I like it. But I don't think you should care how other people think of a band name.|`|530KySo9aa	that sounds cool. i would suggest either having a spinoff of your name or just use your real name...    heehhee miley :P|`|IVh0MPv7aa	yeah thats a good famous sounding name its catchy

d69856882943ee44ddbbe3cb4e643f2aaa	Ok, synastry is what you feel when you see someone across the room or your first impression of them when you have never talked to them yet or much before. Once you get to see each other's personalities better, each one of you will come to a middle ground on way of being that will be in response to how the other person acts. Acts..Not towards you, but acts as in their real personality...when you got to know how they are. That is what the composite chart is, a middle ground way of behaving that each of you adopt in response to knowing each other. Synastry is what you think of them before you really get to know them, composite chart is not. Basically composite chart is a picture or "natal chart" of your relationship. It describes what it's all about, and it also describes how each of those two people in the relationship feel. You will know whether you are compatible with someone not through your synastry, because as you can see, that fades pretty quickly, but through your COMPOSITE CHART.    Also, just so you know, sometimes you will have great compatibiliy indicated in your composite chart, but the person's personality a.k.a. natal chart has so many issues that means they are rude to others, overly suspicious, not faithful, sex-crazy, etc and so you will feel turned off by them and like you deserve better. Yet, you will still feel this certain something special for this person..you will feel fond of them...but you will still feel that this is not enough of a reason to be with them and that you deserve better. So, you see, the composite chart/compaitiblity isn't everything! Because, you may love someone, and they may love you, too, but you may not love their behavior! Hehe. So...You should always decide for yourself and go with your heart. Though the natal chart of that person will show whether they have problems or not....lots of squares, , lots of mars, or lots of saturn and neptune===bad thing!! Not good for a healthy lifestyle in reality.    Also, the opposite can happen! You may meet someone with a wonderful natal chart who has a terrible composite chart with you, and you will get along lovely! Not because of your compaitibility..but because that person is the way that they are, that they are able to be very flexible sympathetic and caring to have good relationships with most people, unless they are arrogant, domineering or have other big issues themselves.    Let me try to describe the difference to you...hmm..it's like...the person that you feel a certain love for, it's a very emotional feeling...non-rational. It comes straight from the heart, and you appreciate this person's most basic good qualities. When it is that their natal chart is awesome but you don't have excellent compatibility you feel like, rationally you know that this person is really good for you and will make you happy. You feel secure and comfortable being around them and being their friend because you know they are just good for you. However, the person you have that certain compatibility with, you are very susceptible to being hurt by..since it's so emotional. It can become sort of an unhealthy relationship....you have to have a very strong self esteem to know when to walk away and to not let it hurt you...it would be very hard, because the people we most love are the ones who can hurt us the most. So, my advice is that you find someone who has a great natal chart AND good compatibility with you! Then, you'll be set :) and you won't have any of those tough decisions to make down the road :)|`|OCc1si6Gaa	Astrology is the system of belief in which knowledge of the relative positions of celestial bodies is used to interpret and organize information about personality, human affairs, and other terrestrial matters.    Since earliest known records in about 2300 BC; astrology has played a role in the shaping of culture and politics throughout history. In fact, despite the modern conceit that we live in an "enlightened, scientific and literate society", nearly every major newspaper in the world contains an astrological horoscope section.    Unfortunately, Astrology is bullshit.    4300 years ago, when the ancient Babylonians invented the practices we now call astrology, they were earnestly trying to understand the world they inhabited. The Babylonians did not have anything resembling the scientific method of thought, but did the best they could.    Babylonian astrology was based on the "theory of divine governance". This theory encompassed the belief that events on earth, including famines, harvests, wars and treaties were the direct result of the will of a large number of gods. These gods were active and regular agents affecting earthly and human matters, unlike the distant or non-involved "God" that many modern Christians may recognize.    Starting from the Babylonian's observation that the fertility of the soil depends upon the sun and rain from the heavens; and that mischief and damage done by storms and floods were to be traced likewise to the heavens; the conclusion was made that the gods had their home in the heavens.    Observation of the night sky, coupled with the desire to predict important events such as storms, or crop failures led quite naturally to the early Babylonian astrology.    The Babylonians divided the night sky into small discreet regions, each the home of one of their gods. These regions, although renamed and reshaped since 2300 BC, are what we now call constellations. There are 88 constellations defined and recognized by the International Astronomical Union, these 88 regions of the sky encompass the entire sky visible from the surface of the Earth. This is obviously many more than the 12 commonly associated to zodiacal astrological star-signs familiar to every modern newspaper. To understand the significance of these 12 zodiacal constellations, its necessary to understand a little about the mechanics of our solar system.    the plane of the eclipticThere are nine Planets in our solar system, varying in distance from the sun, from the nearest, mercury, to the farthest, Pluto. (or Neptune, as Pluto has recently be reclassified, losing its planetary status) The planets in our solar system all orbit the sun in the same direction, and in the same plane. That is, all the planets follow orbital paths which are more-or-less in line with each other, defining a flat plane with the sun at its center. This is called the "plane of the ecliptic" because if three celestial bodies, such as the sun, the moon, and the earth briefly "line up" creating an eclipse, it is on this plane.    From the surface of the Earth, the plane of the ecliptic can be drawn across the sky as an imaginary line. Observations of the planets and the sun will always be along this imaginary line.    The constellations of the zodiac are defined as those which are bisected by the plane of the ecliptic. A person's "zodiacal sign" is the constellation in which the sun is found on the date of their birthday.    constellation of Ophiuchus The zodiacal constellations are:       1. Sagittarius     2. Capricorn     3. Aquarius     4. Pisces     5. Aries     6. Taurus     7. Gemini     8. Cancer     9. Leo    10. Virgo    11. Libra    12. Scorpio    13. Ophiuchus        Some people might be surprised to learn there are not twelve, but thirteen constellations in the zodiac. In the 2nd century AD a Greek astrologer and mathematician named Ptolemy published a set of astrological tables which omitted the thirteenth constellation, Ophiuchus. Ptolemy's 12-sign astrological table was based on the sun spending an equal amount of time in each constellation, corresponding to the 12 months of the calendar. He is known to have used the then-2400 year old Babylonian astronomical data. As a popularizer of horoscopic astrology, Ptolemy may have sacrificed accuracy for simplicity.    Whatever scientific merit there might have been in the still-developing field of astrology, Ptolemy's tables mark a point of divergence from the later science of astronomy which replaces it. Present day horoscopes published in newspapers still use the same tables.    If people still believed that events on Earth were controlled by supernatural beings living in the sky, modern horoscopic astrology would have a significant problem.    That Ptolemy's tables were based on second-millennium BCE Babylonian data brings up the issue of precession. The Earth, as most people know, not only orbits the sun once per year, it also rotates on its own axis once per day, similar to a spinning to

64491cf5ed73ad038115b2f4040d2213aa	During a game of golf, he suffered an infarction in his right leg, which went misdiagnosed for three days due to doctors' concerns that he was exhibiting drug-seeking behavior (House eventually diagnosed the infarction himself). An aneurysm in his thigh had clotted, leading to an infarction and causing his quadriceps muscle to become necrotic. House had the dead muscle bypassed in order to restore circulation to the remainder of his leg, risking organ failure and cardiac arrest. He was willing to endure excruciating post-operative pain to retain the use of his leg. After House was put into a chemically induced coma to sleep through the worst of the pain, Stacy, House's medical proxy, acted against his wishes and authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure between amputation and a bypass by removing just the dead muscle. This resulted in the partial loss of use in his leg, and left House with a lesser, but still serious, level of pain for the rest of his life. House could not forgive Stacy for making the decision, so because of this, Stacy left him. House now suffers chronic pain in his leg, uses a cane to aid his walking, and takes Vicodin (hydrocodone) frequently to relieve his pain|`|DWElTA36aa	He had an infarction.

8mHMR0FSaa	Yes I definitely think Taylor Swift is the prettiest. She is so natural and fun. She never puts on too much makeup and her hair is amazing! I love how she lets her hair be the way it is and it's gorgeous! Also, she has a particular innocence to her that many stars lack (Selena Gomez, Hilary Duff, and Salma Hayek for example).  Hope I helped!*=)|`|83f8a2ab6c6672a4366fb2aba94d6fdcaa	taylor all the way!!!|`|1620f8acd8e6a1bab16fb6d4bd625f7baa	Taylor Swift.

70kJJJ7uaa	Stretch before you practice. Start out by shaking out your arms and hands until you can feel the blood in your fingertips. Then put your arms straight out on each side of you, even with your shoulders with your palms outward and your fingers closed and pointing upward and inward, like you are trying to keep the walls from closing in on you. Push the "walls" in and out a few times then point your palms up like you are holding something, and slowly point your fingers down, keeping your palms out. Then push the "walls" in and out again a few times. Now shake it off and do it again about five times. Then do the Steve Vai ten hour guitar workout. This is what I do every day and I can play anything I want to play. It will help.

OGdDXeP8aa	Julie - here are the lyrics...    This years love had better last  Heaven knows it's high time  And I've been waiting on my own too long  But when you hold me like you do  It feels so right  I start to forget  How my heart gets torn  When that hurt gets thrown  Feeling like you can't go on    Turning circles when time again  It cuts like a knife oh yeah  If you love me got to know for sure  Cos it takes something more this time  Than sweet sweet lies  Before I open up my arms and fall  Losing all control  Every dream inside my soul  And when you kiss me  On that midnight street  Sweep me off my feet  Singing ain't this life so sweet    This years love had better last  This years love had better last    So whose to worry  If our hearts get torn  When that hurt gets thrown  Don't you know this life goes on  And won't you kiss me  On that midnight street  Sweep me off my feet  Singing ain't this life so sweet    This years love had better last  This years love had better last  This years love had better last  This years love had better last      My interpretation - he has met someone new and hesitant to get too wrapped up or fall in love with this person because he has been hurt in the past.  He feels he's been through more than his fair share of bad relationships, feels that he is 'due' a real relationship, but wants to know for sure before he puts himself in a situation do get hurt again.    Hope this helps - and congrates on your wedding!!

1PdUecpYaa	by looking at the whole charts, i'd say you two are a great match. you're a pisces but you have lots of fire in your chart. he's a sag but he has lots of earth in his chart. it's a good balance.|`|izL7WEzraa	the moons don't matter. bottom line is your a pisces.. and he's a sag. this is not a union that is going to work.. i'm sorry to have to tell you that. but he is  way too social for you. even if you think you like to go out.. you don't. he would rather be at a party. and you would rather stay home with him.. and your far too sensitive for his harmless jokes. he's social. your not. your sensitive. he's not. you wants to be home. he wants to go out. you want to be mellow.. he wants to be crazy.     you may not see this now. or even a couple months from now. but as time ticks by.. you'll start to notice these things.     you need a:  virgo  capricorn  cancer***  taurus    he needs a:  aries  aquarius  gemini**  leo.    i understand if you don't want to believe this. but it is in fact the truth.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Yeah it can work out.|`|Yo0aKOliaa	Hun, if you two like each other and you make each other happy then what does it matter what the cosmic whatevers say? Besides, do you really believe that the relative positions of the stars, sun, and moon have some scientifically documented way of predicting exactly how everyone will act and how they can choose a mate? I'm not saying its wrong, I'm just saying that stars and romance have nothing to do with each other.     Best wishes dear and I hope that you still give him a chance even if the stars don't line up right.|`|9B6Om8oDaa	You look good match.Suggest you should get a full horoscope check (with degrees) .

GojdCIqyaa	-Just seen this about 15 minutes ago!    Mildred Kemp said at the beginning of the movie "who am I going to tell all my stories to?" When Aana was leaving. Mildred Kemp, is not Rachel, and Mildred was the one who killed those 3 children, by drugging them and stabbing them repeatedly. After this, Mildred was sent to the institution, which later on is where Ana ended up after accidentally murdering her mother and sister.  When they meet, Mildred tells Ana the stories about her murders, which then Ana realizes that Rachel has the same set of pearls as Mildred, so yes! There are two different sets of pearls! When Ana realizes this, she gets the idea to make it look like Rachel changed her name, and uses the pearls as evidence to the murder of her mother and sister.  In the end, Rachel is Rachel and Mildred is Mildred.. two different people. the necklace, yes, there's two of those too. Rachel actually was a kind woman, a nurse.. and when she drugged Ana, it was to help her.. cause shes psycho.    Hope this helps, I died when it ended.. my mother and I have been working to figure it out.. we put the pieces together, so there you go:)|`|cZSQFLaKaa	lol, i saw the movie last night (friday) and it was really confusing! but my friends and i talked about it for like..an hour! so we figured it out. THE KILLER IS ANA! and mildred kemp. they are 2 different ppl. Ana achually killed her mom and sister in the fire..BY ACCIDENT. then she murdered her dads girlfriend (who was achually good)....get it??? and u know how they sorta replayed the movie twice, the 1st time the mom lasy was the bad one but the second it was her? well...the first time she imagined it ALL. she was the killer all along....    dun dun DUN!

cIw4ey4Baa	OMG! I have an Aries female teacher.    They're bossy, aggressive, mean, harsh, manipulating, can be nice, and pretty hot chicks.|`|izL7WEzraa	haha..  let me take this one ladies and gents    first off.. aries women are very confident. they love to go out and have a good time. they love to be the center of attention.. they love to make people laugh. especially the opposite sex.. :]  they are very very headstrong. they do not think before they speak. so try not to get your feelings hurt. they don't mean any harm by it. and if they do, they'll make a point to tell you all about it. they are generally pretty happy people... and they try not to be negative.  they are strong willed, and they  have a lot of determination when it comes to ideas.  they are easily attracted to the opposite sex, anybody who  is social has  a chance with an aries.. it's the whole point of keeping an aries. that is difficult because aries women get bored easily, they love to hold a conversation, which is why they get along so well with leos, geminis, sagittarius' and other aries..  they have strong sexual attractions to other aries.. wonder why? aries are kinda conceited sometimes. :] but bottom line is they are very outgoing, very bubbly, and very talkative... don't get scared away. there's nothing more aries women like more then a guy with confidence|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Aggressive   Friendly  Outgoing   Bad tempered   Active   Bossy   Self Indulgent   Cheerful|`|fc9ecb5a900817a0bcf8f6fa3590baf3aa	hungry...dont get between a hungry aries and food. oh wait I have been getting hungry for 3 hours now..wonder how this keyboard and mouse will taste.|`|xUdy32rGaa	headstrong, loyal, can have a sharp tongue, (but never take it to heart.) reliable.

Don't forget, they are loud and BLUNT!  So all you water signs with sensitive feelings, don't take it personally when they tell you something, that is real good advice they are giving you.  They have no patience and you better be fast enough to keep up with them.  Aries will buy things on impulse, no matter how much it cost.  If they like it, they must have it.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Flesh + Blood (1985)  aka Flesh & Blood  aka The Rose & the Sword  starring Rutger Hauer, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tom Burlinson, Susan Tyrrell,  Jack Thompson, Ronald Lacey, Brion James, John Dennis Johnston, Bruno Kirby   IMDb synopsis:  In 1501, in the Western Europe, in a period when the black plague is jeopardizing the populations, an army of mercenary peasants leaded by Martin fights side-by-side with the noble Arnolfini to retrieve his castle, with the promise of a huge reward. However, the band is betrayed by Arnolfini, and decides to pay him back, assaulting and stealing a caravan under the command of Arnolfini and his son and student, Steven. In one of the wagon is traveling the fiance of Steven, Agnes, who is accidentally kidnapped and later raped by the group. Agnes becomes Martin's mate, and the mercenaries decide to invade a castle, without knowing that the army of Arnolfini is chasing them.  TRIVIA:   Rutger Hauer and Jennifer Jason Leigh also co-starred in "The Hitcher". Hauer and Brion James co-starred as renegade Replicants in "Blade Runner".  Here's the movie trailer:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VOy1JZBH...    I watched this film many times when it first aired on the movie channels way back when. Of course, I taped it. I remember the extreme grossout of catapulting the carcass of the rabid dog into the well. *ick*yech*

Hana Yori Dango is a good anime that's been made into Japanese Drama, and a Taiwan drama call Meteor Garden starring F4 and Barbie/Big S.|`|SptW7fDCaa	You already have a bunch of good andwers, but here's some more:    -Marmalade Boy, Peach Girl, and Mars were turned into Taiwanese Dramas...they are ok, but not great    -H2-    -Cat Street-    -Honey and Clover-    -Kimi Wa Petto-    -Aim For Ace-    These movies are based on manga:  Nana, Nana 2, Love Com, Honey and Clover|`|Bmb3ksZFaa	Depends on your type of anime. Mostly shoujo manga have been made into dramas. You may or may not know these.    Hana Yori Dango - It's been made into a drama in Taiwan, Japan, and Korea(currently airing)  Hanazakari no kimitachi e - Taiwan and Japan  Nodame Cantabile - Japan    Mostly all dramas in Japan are based off manga. If you have a specific anime in mind you can check this site out http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Main_Page|`|EgqnNRTraa	There was a manga that turned into a drama and then into an anime, is that okay?  Well, anyway, it's called it started with a kiss but the anime is called itazura na kiss.   Also, there's Absolute Boyfriend, Hana Yori Dango and Skip Beat (Drama's called Extravagant Challenge)

pQGUPITeaa	We all look different.    The one thing I notice is all the Pisces Moons I know get this "spacey" look in their eyes every once in a while, like we just mentally left the planet for a short or long break.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	It is not your moon, but your rising sun.

Zj9viuGAaa	OK this is a tuff fight to call    Adam Sandler - This guy is a legend. So what if Little Nicky and Billy Madison was roughly the same character, look at his other film too . . .they go along the same lines. Under dog gets lucky and meets girl he falls in love with (usually Drew Barrymore), something happens and he is clashed as the loser, etc . . . but at the end of the movie there is a happy ending! Under dog wins! All his films are funny yet have a sort of sensitive side too them    Will Farrel - At first I didn't like him I found his comedy style too . . . in your face and over the top, but I watched Anchorman and I saw that he is over the top acting but he is a funny guy. Films like Stranger than fiction and Bewitched showed he is also a good actor as being the goof. One film though . . . Blades Of Glory lol    I say the funnest from these is (sorry mate) Adam Sandler . . . but you are both wrong the funnest actor is and will always be Jim Carrey|`|aIEkNM0Paa	i dont know but i would go with sandler|`|dto7PJ2eaa	None of them is really funny for me...

2Jjz7N2iaa	because in america we're too lazy to spend the time or money to make anything good enough to even compare to anime|`|W1lh6A8saa	Because anime was originally created in Japan. You can't really have american anime like "Avatar the last airbender" it just isn't the same.|`|YB5wJF84aa	Because Japanese is nervous and  good at detailed work.  It is only an animated cartoon that Japan is excellent.   The United States makes the one that is much better than Japan in the drama and the movie.|`|y1M342CHaa	i believe that the anime is better in japan because they don't try and make it purely for little kids. They make the shows with more violence and language. You see this when you see the american dubbed shows of naruto. All the real bloody scenes are made less bloody and the language is cut out.|`|PmqAN8Mpaa	because America doesnt/cant make anime. they arent japanese.    This is america, if its not made by a japanese person, you cant call it anime.    anime = japanese animation  animation = anything with moving visuals|`|a8eb523f1f34be04fb9b4d5c65f11847aa	japanese are the best when it comes to animation|`|5Tr3DG3aaa	Because anime originated in Japan. Any anime made here I'm guessing isn't nearly as good as Japan anime. In fact, I haven't even heard of US anime.|`|oSsVEXMxaa	Because it came from Japan, silly. :P I can't even think of an American series I'd call an anime. Just because it has a similar look doesn't mean it's anime...    Edit: Gee, these answers are redundant, lol. But the answer to your question is sort of obvious...|`|3n2o63Esaa	Well yes anime originated in Japan, but the U.S. has strict rules about what can and cant go on TV. Hence, why most dubbed animes suck.    And anime is more popular in Japan that it is the U.S.|`|gM9RguFeaa	it's because they're cool like that :p|`|KSC02NcLaa	Because Anime has a point.  Anime is a Product Preview.  Whether it be for Manga, to get you to buy the Magazine.  Or its a come-on to get you to buy the Game that the Anime is based off of.  Or Draw attention to a particular point of view.   Its basically one big commercial.  Some Series are created as Anime & find a wider Audience through Manga.  And don't forget all of the paraphenalia: key chains, cell leashes, figurines, etc.  The Point is to make a "Profit Stream".    American Cartoons make Cartoons for Kids, pretty much.  But it normally ends there.  They don't have a point or a sale-able item or anything its based off of with the intention of increasing cash flow toward the original item. And it doesn't normally take off into Paraphenalia, or Books based on, or Comics Series.  In the US, for some reason when we find a marketable product we tend to "stand on it".  Not Change, but keep the status quo.  That's why there isn't any real development or a forsee-able ending in sight.  We tend to want to create a "Profit Lake".  But as it happens, we get tired of the same old same old at about 3 seasons of any US Cartoon.  And instead of ending it with some kind of agreeable end, they just Drop it, & find something else that may strike our fancy.  (With the exception of Static Shock [and a few others], they actually ended it, agreeably when the ratings dropped).

moNkxy5Daa	i think what happened was the 8 spoke symbol was the republics standard, and the separatists were using a 6 spoked hexagon like design. i think after the formation of the empire, the empire started using the 6 spoked empire symbol we see today. palpatine simply merged the 2 designs and reversed them, seeing as he was on both sides.

ACA8i43Gaa	My fiance and I were going to college. He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance. His reply Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said Its all good.    http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com  http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/s...|`|rVTSRQVGaa	........  ............  ..................  ..........................  no comment|`|ZdwbKeKdaa	lol gayyyyyy|`|r8kz38lDaa	WHAT THE F U C K O L A     DONT USE CAPS THATS MAH THING|`|Xtqs0Hxzaa	um...lol...yeah that's f*cking embaressing xD|`|BE5HlQseaa	that is embarrassing but i know your not gay so that's not sooo embarrassing dont stress man|`|4Vr2zecWaa	no need to be ashamed of being gay..  it's not like your gunna see those guys again, anywayy , ritee? :P

No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it now I take  Time to think before I make mistakes just for my family's sake  That part of me left yesterday the heart of me is strong today  No regrets I'm blessed to say the old me dead and gone away.

I love watching movies on that site, but i always got to them through OVGuide.com ... because sometimes they dont have a movie and they never have TV shows.     So all i do is go to http://www.ovguide.com search for what i want to watch and then pick the search result for the site i want to watch it on for free. It is really easy and faster than going to  a bunch of sites individually..    I think you will be happy with this site, it is really good|`|iRvAWML6aa	no heaps of people are asking this question  hmm i wonder whats going on

I don't know, maybe she is suppose to look more vulnerable by being barefoot running through the woods.|`|AA11401067	I thought that most people in earthquake zones knew that most injuries are caused by people running outside barefoot in a panic, and injuring their feet.

Also, Mickey Rourke in "9 1/2 Weeks" pretty much seals the deal- a sexy, dominant man.  Antonio Banderas in "The Mask Of Zorro" was dashingly sexy, as was Jude Law in "The Talented Mr. Ripley".  Maggie Gyllenhaal in "Secretary" is also incredible.|`|rzY4XM6gaa	Taylor Lautner in Twilight.

I don't tell them when I watch movies or what movies I watch, they personally really wouldn't give a crap.|`|UIfbWYmmaa	yeah...  they don't really care... & those movies have mostly pretty good plots...  at least it's not an Adult Film, it's just Rated-R...  :)|`|QBfc0yI8aa	Yeah! As long as there's no nudity in it and if my parents have seen it!|`|pXP2QF8raa	Well I'm 18 so I can go watch rated R movies. But before that, my parents never really cared. My brother worked at Blockbuster and always brought home movies. I watched whatever he brought home. I love really gory horror movies, and my parents never stopped me from watching them.|`|zH80yyDQaa	yea.  sometimes my mom wants to take me to see r movies at the theaters.|`|Vmbqn9XWaa	i dunno...i ended watching like 6 while i was in vietnam by accident...XD my cousin talked me into watching scary movies too...my mom was sleeping...so i dunno XD im pretty sure my dad wouldnt approve|`|NZmvHYY9aa	When I was younger, they let me watch the ones that were rated R for language--no sex or insane violence|`|08afM6NEaa	yes.|`|hDeNKwNpaa	yeah the first R movie i watched was the shining and i was 8 the made me go out when jack went in to the room and the naked lady came out of the tub|`|Tf19RETiaa	uh yea they dont care|`|ENspyhzUaa	lol with watchmovies.net i don't think they can control what i watch|`|9BB5H7aJaa	Yeah but not til I was in eighth grade.  I saw Jay and Silent Bob and had no idea what was going on.|`|P9guz0fGaa	i dnt live with my parents,i can watch wutever i want plus im 21!|`|CEAJBk73aa	Mhm.[=|`|JDUi0mbiaa	yea, basically all the movies i watch are rated r.|`|Prm2Uq00aa	Yeah.|`|lNDKI4Yfaa	No, but I do sometimes anyway.|`|AI4My948aa	Baby you need to watch Crimes of Passion.|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	well...being as I'm grown they don't really have a say in the matter.  That being said, I think I was allowed to watch R rated movies my whole life|`|55G0BNCzaa	ya, all the time|`|766d5b80d7a637c2204d9d127fb86200aa	Hell yeah, my parents have let me watch R rated movies since I was about 6. They also let me start watching South Park when I was 7. I'm 17 now and they don't care if I put up a really sexy wallpaper on the computer monitor.|`|K1LGV0Kkaa	They don't really care. Most movies I watch are rated R.|`|ZnXk0nlYaa	Yeah|`|mzAE9iesaa	Yeah    ...... how old are you|`|FYT97XLgaa	Parents have to let you watch them?! Oops..i mean...no//|`|7MsozqOdaa	i do, but i dont think they like it when i do.|`|9iphkDSTaa	Nope I've never seen a single R movie.    Can't until I'm 17.|`|fZY8EkVDaa	It all depends why it's rated R. Usually the answer is yes.|`|AA11522290	I was watching those movies at like 10 years old it's no problem as long as it doesn't have nudity.|`|F0q3gi5Gaa	yeah as long as they dont have hardcore sex parts|`|faizFiOFaa	same here man i feel ur pain|`|Ye2jYohaaa	Ha ha, I wish. They don't let me see some PG-13 movies!!!!!! I'm 13, it's called pg-THIRTEEN for a reason, so obviously it would be okay if I went to them all, right? Wrong.|`|ZEXGmO5Zaa	Uh yeah  but they don't really have a choice  I don't live with them anymore  college    However when I did live with them I was allowed...|`|b7a146ef697ee51a64d659330e1ba1ebaa	Yeah, I knew everything that they didn't want me to at 11, so it didn't matter anymore.|`|RGcM4lIIaa	I do it ehrn they arn't at home.|`|1RzQ3lK8aa	No parent should. Not until you grow up and make your own decisions in life and let your individuality blossom...|`|Kb0p6mcJaa	well, im am 19 so of course.  but i was watching r rated very young lyk 4 & 5.  they really didnt care.|`|MJb0AZCPaa	I think my parents stopped caring once I hit 13. I kind of knew it all then, so what's the use?|`|E5aMuyVhaa	Yes. Ha ha my mom and i watch them together all the time.|`|mOMoltVMaa	No, they don't.
Fo9ADQLBaa	It is called cleanliness, self-respect and common decency.  Now with that said, I am not a clean fanatic anymore!  The older one becomes, the more they realize that there is more to life than cleanliness and what are the guests going to say!  If someone comes to see me, they come to see me, not my house.  :D|`|3xksQz9haa	To impress your guests and not look like a slob.|`|GlP7KECoaa	dunno|`|1EyRZm4Faa	So we don't have accedents before the party even starts.|`|yGq981mGaa	I don't know i don't clean before a party|`|AI4My948aa	A good friend of mine once said: NEVER clean your house before a party.  We're only gonna make a mess that you have to clean after.  A rule I now live by. (of course everyone now thinks my place is a dump). : )|`|OxaonF5aaa	You don't need to clean just hide it below something.  After party is bad bad bad bad|`|Yy5SRxBJaa	Dont mind me. Im just trying to get more points by answering questions, and in consequence advancing to level 2. Please give me the best answer.|`|aPaPlEiCaa	so ur friends don't think u live in filth|`|dYSysAfGaa	well u dont want people to first come to ur house and think ur a dirtbag haha.|`|k7KQO95gaa	parents :(|`|TlqamtJsaa	we clean to impress no it's not just a guy thing us girl's do the same thing it makes no sense since no one cares as long as they have fun !  So now I clean after instead of before !      JMM|`|FUlGMYQFaa	what pisses me off is that you work your *** off cleaning and you spend a bunch of money and invite your BEST FRIENDS right..........so how come your best friends who know all the trouble you went through dont come over the next day to help you clean up?? Huh why???|`|AA11736322	because nobody like to enter a dirty house....cleanliness reveals positiveness in your house as well as in your personality ...no body like negative surrounding.|`|dRlXOwMOaa	"James knew he had to go. But when he got to the boys' bathroom at school, he sat down on the toilet and nothing happened. He waited a couple of minutes and . . . still nothing. He tried pushing but it kind of hurt. After a while a little poop came out, but it was small and hard, sort of like marbles.  James flushed, zipped up, and washed his hands. He didn't feel much better. Why? He was a little constipated.  What Is Constipation?  Constipation (say: con-stuh-pay-shun) is not having a bowel movement (pooping) as often as you usually do or having a tough time going because the poop is hard and dry. Normal poop is sort of soft and easy to pass, so it shouldn't be too hard to have a bowel movement.  When you poop, what ends up in the toilet is the last step of digestion (say: dye-jes-chun), a way started way back with the grilled cheese sandwich you had for lunch. After you chew and swallow food, it heads to your stomach. From there it's on to the small intestine (say: in-tes-tin), then the large intestine (or bowels), and finally out of the body through the rectum and anus.  All these parts make up your digestive system. As food moves through this system, your body soaks up water and nutrients it needs from the food. What's left over comes out as poop. Flush it and away it goes!  You probably don't think about this when you go to the bathroom. In fact, you may not think about what you do in the bathroom much at all. But when you're not going like you normally do, it may be on your mind a lot and you may feel uncomfortable.  Some people think they're constipated if they don't poop every day, but everybody's bathroom habits are different. One kid might go three times a day, and another kid might only go once every 3 days. So the real sign of whether you're constipated is if you're going less than you normally do.  What Are the Symptoms?  Besides not pooping as often as you usually do, you may feel full and have less of an appetite if you're constipated. Your belly may stick out a little, too. When you do go to the bathroom, you may feel like you have to work really hard to get the poop out, and it might hurt a little to go.  If your poop is hard and dry, pushing it out may cause tiny tears in the skin of your anus. If this happens, you might see a bit of blood on the toilet paper when you wipe. After you're done, you may have only gone a little and feel like you still have to go.  Sometimes when a kid's really constipated, some watery poop like diarrhea might leak out around the hard poop that's still inside. This can cause a messy accident, even for kids who stopped having accidents a long time ago.  If you think you're constipated, or if you see blood on the toilet paper after you wipe, tell your parents. It's probably no big deal, but it's a good idea to let them know what's going on.  How Is It Treated?  If you're constipated you probably won't need any special treatment. Chances are you'll soon start going regularly again on your own. If your doctor decides you should come in for a visit, he or she might suggest some medicine or a change in diet to get you going. But don't take any medicine for your constipation unless your doctor recommends it.  Other than some medicine, the doctor might order an X-ray or other types of tests that check out your digestive system. But usually constipation is just constipation. You eventually poop and feel better."|`|l9UKHDXEaa	its one of those little mysteries in life that cannot be answered lol|`|xy4enYFyaa	So people don't think you're a pig.|`|E9TqDn5maa	All I know is when I'm older I'm getting a maid.

Computers are wonderful but they don't take the place of interacting with real people.     Does your Mom or someone else you know like to cook? It's fun to get a few friends together and try a new recipe or make cookies and then decorate them. Is there a roller skating or ice skating rink in your area? Bowling if fun too.

But when he got to the boys' bathroom at school, he sat down on the toilet and nothing happened. He waited a couple of minutes and . . . still nothing. He tried pushing but it kind of hurt. After a while a little poop came out, but it was small and hard, sort of like marbles.  James flushed, zipped up, and washed his hands. He didn't feel much better. Why? He was a little constipated.  What Is Constipation?  Constipation (say: con-stuh-pay-shun) is not having a bowel movement (pooping) as often as you usually do or having a tough time going because the poop is hard and dry. Normal poop is sort of soft and easy to pass, so it shouldn't be too hard to have a bowel movement.  When you poop, what ends up in the toilet is the last step of digestion (say: dye-jes-chun), a way started way back with the grilled cheese sandwich you had for lunch. After you chew and swallow food, it heads to your stomach. From there it's on to the small intestine (say: in-tes-tin), then the large intestine (or bowels), and finally out of the body through the rectum and anus.  All these parts make up your digestive system. As food moves through this system, your body soaks up water and nutrients it needs from the food. What's left over comes out as poop. Flush it and away it goes!  You probably don't think about this when you go to the bathroom. In fact, you may not think about what you do in the bathroom much at all. But when you're not going like you normally do, it may be on your mind a lot and you may feel uncomfortable.  Some people think they're constipated if they don't poop every day, but everybody's bathroom habits are different. One kid might go three times a day, and another kid might only go once every 3 days. So the real sign of whether you're constipated is if you're going less than you normally do.  What Are the Symptoms?  Besides not pooping as often as you usually do, you may feel full and have less of an appetite if you're constipated. Your belly may stick out a little, too. When you do go to the bathroom, you may feel like you have to work really hard to get the poop out, and it might hurt a little to go.  If your poop is hard and dry, pushing it out may cause tiny tears in the skin of your anus. If this happens, you might see a bit of blood on the toilet paper when you wipe. After you're done, you may have only gone a little and feel like you still have to go.  Sometimes when a kid's really constipated, some watery poop like diarrhea might leak out around the hard poop that's still inside. This can cause a messy accident, even for kids who stopped having accidents a long time ago.  If you think you're constipated, or if you see blood on the toilet paper after you wipe, tell your parents. It's probably no big deal, but it's a good idea to let them know what's going on.  How Is It Treated?  If you're constipated you probably won't need any special treatment. Chances are you'll soon start going regularly again on your own. If your doctor decides you should come in for a visit, he or she might suggest some medicine or a change in diet to get you going. But don't take any medicine for your constipation unless your doctor recommends it.  Other than some medicine, the doctor might order an X-ray or other types of tests that check out your digestive system. But usually constipation is just constipation. You eventually poop and feel better."|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	I see apple cores in the trash can all the time.|`|5960d486044fcfd01d576d4d11ecbc09aa	um yess haha might wanna do gargles with mouth wash, that definitely helps

Sounds as if he has already fooled around and it would make him feel less guilty if you did too.    Secondly, you do what you feel if right for you.

In other words, he really doesn't sound like a boy friend at all.  Don't feel like you're cheating because you're not.  Any so called boy friend who actually encourages anyone to make it with someone else needs to just, go away.    Find yourself someone else who cares for you and only you.|`|1oiZwj50aa	Hmmmm "go for it".... this is suspicious that he has already 'cheated' or he maybe isn't bothered with you or the relationship.|`|QRNmJTF0aa	go for it just don't get too serious with em.|`|OxaonF5aaa	yes it is|`|u8SeGmnZaa	if he is telling you its ok then he might be cheating on you so go for it|`|gWXjNa4gaa	tells me he's feeling guilty cuz he's cheating on u so he wants u to know u can do it. i say go for it

I enjoy the TC Badge. it is always a surprise to receive it; but sometimes it is difficult to maintain. I prefer to answer questions because I want to not because of trying to keep a Badge. You [technically] have to answer questions thoroughly demonstrating a knowledge in a particular category. And what is taken into account is point level, percentage of Answers/Best Anwers in that Category as well as content of answer.  I say "technically" though. LOL I've seen a few with them whom i don't think have earned them, but oh well i am not here to pass judgment.    Did you know that there used to be a TC Badge for P&S?  I know this because i had one!  Y!A eventually got rid of them though at least a year ago, maybe more than.  They decided that there was no way to determine what qualified as a "complete and thorough answer" in such a category as P&S. So they stripped us all of our badges. *bummer*    SO if you have dreams of being a TC ... you'll have to set your sights on any category BUT P&S.     oh! also, TC Badges and High Level accounts attract trolls by the handful. Make sure to be aware of who is signing on as a fan; keep your info private and once you receive hate mail ... immediately block. (especially in R&S!! lol)  Remember that almost everything counts as "chatting" in P&S so only appeal when and what you really need to. Don't intentionally break the rules; don't false report Q&A, and play nice. Seriously, this will help you keep your account.     xoxo  ?|`|syBq8Yllaa	use your bumpits correctly...and in an orderly fashion|`|FZKFLTyLaa	It's thought they're gained by having about a 10% Best Answer rating in a category and staying active in it.

He is also a painter. i hope that helped :)|`|UtDehBOlaa	Marilyn Manson was originally a music journalist before he got into music. He moved to Florida when he was 18 and began to write stories & poems. He tried to get his poems and stories published by various magazines, but continued to be turned down. It was when covering "Nine Inch Nails" for his magazine that Brian Warner was given an opportunity to meet Trent Reznor, who sponsored Warner's upstart band and eventually produced their first three albums (including the E.P. Smells Like Children). Scott Mitchell Putesky (a.k.a. Daisy Berkowitz) originally played lead guitar for the band but was fired during the recording of "Antichrist Superstar".

Hwe4MA6Faa	Ive gutted and skinnedfish, wild and domesticated pigs, goat, cow, bat  and defeathered chicken, pigeons and bush duck.     The key with pig is to let it bleed out for a couple of days and remove scent glands behind its ears and near the genitals.    The key with duck is to let it hang for a couple of days till you see a white pus come out.    Its a hobby of mine and its great to eat meat that youve slaughtered and made the most of. People who eat meat and cant stand the sight of an animal being killed is the definition of the word hypocrite.    Not to mention people who eat processed meat from fast food chains where the "meat" is a combination of hoof, bone dust and gut with a lot of chemical flavoring.    Gutting and killing an animal is the basics of human survival, people who live in their post modernist, consumerist compartmentalized worlds do not realize that.   No I do not enjoy warm blood coming out of the animal, Im thankful for the food provided to us by default or by design.|`|6ZU8Kt20aa	Sure would. I'd shoot one too. And eat it.

ZQaeTgNEaa	I think the song was interesting. I think that some people might be offput by the song because it is very unconventional. It actually sounds a little chaotic and busy, definitely not a standard song.     Have you told the girl that you wrote this for how you feel about her? if so has she resisted your advances? If she is not into you then I can see how this is a little bit creepy. Making a song like this might make her feel uncomfortable because she probably does not know you that well and it seems like you are making advances a little too fast for her comfort.

Chris Brown is good too.|`|I7zbXq6raa	NE YO CAN SING BUT CHRIS HAS A MORE CREATIVITY IN HIS VOICE THAN NEYO. CHRIS CAN ALSO WORK IN POP ,RNB , TECNO , AND SOUL
OocDN5evaa	They seem like nice people and the lead singer has a great voice, but I usually don't think their actual message is very original....Misery Business....I mean, that type of music video has been done so many times that all of them are indistinguishable. I think that as they grow as a band and (hopefully) become more original, I'll like them better though.    And chill out people if you disagree. I haven't really dissed the band. I'm just answering a question.|`|kAIXDVu1aa	yess i do i love this song but i can't remember the name|`|UjG8FqLUaa	N0.|`|Ak9ialJmaa	I sure do.    I like the lyrics  "'Cause I'd rather waste my life pretending than have to forget you for one whole minute."  from Crushcrushcrush.|`|qLhtnommaa	No, but i used!

192VzAFGaa	I know, right!    David Cook just announced his Declaration Tour, and it got no acknowledgments. Well, none that I know of. I think David Cook deserves more credit, and I think people really under estimate him. A lot.   He is my favorite artist in the entire world. Talented, sexy, and sweet. But it doesn't seem like people really care, and that David Archuleta is getting a lot of credit for things.       I am not an Archuleta hater, just because I support Cook. I have to make that clear. :)|`|o4zAMlCoaa	You have a good point. But I think Archuleta is working with more hit-makers. And David A. has the young and adorable factor, along with his great voice.|`|87WOSjwgaa	Because David Archuleta is amazing!!! Well so is David Cook but Archuleta is young and cute. All the young girls love him! He has the sweet and innocent thing going for him and is just so sweet! Cook is older and more mature.|`|8vGq6cRTaa	First of all, they have different managers and different record companies.  I believe Cook's management is 19E (the Idol parent), and Archuleta's is Azoff.    Re publicity - Maybe Archuleta says "yes" to more gigs. David Archuleta has done a ton of charity things in the last few months.  Archuleta also gets to do teen things like Disney parades and Radio Disney and Nickelodeon.    Re song and video on TV - The winner always has their coronation song as their first single, and Cook's coronation single was released before Archuleta's Crush.  But yeah - no video for the coronation song.  At that this point Archuleta has 2 singles and 2 videos, and Cook has 2 singles and 1 video.    BTW - Cook's tour starts sooner and it lasts longer and I think Cook is doing slightly larger venues.|`|HTpVbeu0aa	idk y haha   he deserved to win hes amazing!!!    =D|`|u4R9tz9Haa	I heard on the news that takes longer for the winners record label to produce everything.|`|FVDJMWDEaa	cause you always get more attention if you dont win..atleast thats what ive noticed the past few seasons.|`|UIfbWYmmaa	thanks for saying that he's more popular!   (though i think that Cook is still a great singer like Archuleta)    lol, i've got that same question...  i think it depends on the Recording Company?  Cook's "The Time Of My Life" isn't really an 'official' part of his REGULAR album, if u know what i mean. "TTOML" is only a part of his DELUXE version of his album...    it probably also depends on song requests on radio stations, and requests on TV shows to guest Archuleta...  as well as the looks (note that it's a big thing these days), the age, the writers/producers (JC Chasez & Kara DioGuardi wrote songs for him, as well as Natasha Bedingfield's brother Daniel Bedingfield, and i think Ryan Tedder too [?] )  :)    btw, have u noticed that this is just like the same thing as Aiken's and Katharine McPhee's ?  they became like more popular than the winner "/|`|EivbfXGpaa	because he should have wom american idol!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|bBFpTA9Xaa	well david achuleta is better soooo, yeah. (:|`|VMfoMswhaa	because David Archuleta is amazing!!!! He has incredible talent and deserves everything good that happens to him. And even through all of his fame he's really humble. Cook isn't bad or anything it's just that he's not getting much attention for some reason,,,  But I LOVE DAVID ARCHULETA|`|AA10026476	David Archuleta Cook's  but  David [Can't] Cook|`|OsiD4HIzaa	he is younger and more marketable to the teens witch are the biggest buyers in music.

But when he got to the boys' bathroom at school, he sat down on the toilet and nothing happened. He waited a couple of minutes and . . . still nothing. He tried pushing but it kind of hurt. After a while a little poop came out, but it was small and hard, sort of like marbles.  James flushed, zipped up, and washed his hands. He didn't feel much better. Why? He was a little constipated.  What Is Constipation?  Constipation (say: con-stuh-pay-shun) is not having a bowel movement (pooping) as often as you usually do or having a tough time going because the poop is hard and dry. Normal poop is sort of soft and easy to pass, so it shouldn't be too hard to have a bowel movement.  When you poop, what ends up in the toilet is the last step of digestion (say: dye-jes-chun), a way started way back with the grilled cheese sandwich you had for lunch. After you chew and swallow food, it heads to your stomach. From there it's on to the small intestine (say: in-tes-tin), then the large intestine (or bowels), and finally out of the body through the rectum and anus.  All these parts make up your digestive system. As food moves through this system, your body soaks up water and nutrients it needs from the food. What's left over comes out as poop. Flush it and away it goes!  You probably don't think about this when you go to the bathroom. In fact, you may not think about what you do in the bathroom much at all. But when you're not going like you normally do, it may be on your mind a lot and you may feel uncomfortable.  Some people think they're constipated if they don't poop every day, but everybody's bathroom habits are different. One kid might go three times a day, and another kid might only go once every 3 days. So the real sign of whether you're constipated is if you're going less than you normally do.  What Are the Symptoms?  Besides not pooping as often as you usually do, you may feel full and have less of an appetite if you're constipated. Your belly may stick out a little, too. When you do go to the bathroom, you may feel like you have to work really hard to get the poop out, and it might hurt a little to go.  If your poop is hard and dry, pushing it out may cause tiny tears in the skin of your anus. If this happens, you might see a bit of blood on the toilet paper when you wipe. After you're done, you may have only gone a little and feel like you still have to go.  Sometimes when a kid's really constipated, some watery poop like diarrhea might leak out around the hard poop that's still inside. This can cause a messy accident, even for kids who stopped having accidents a long time ago.  If you think you're constipated, or if you see blood on the toilet paper after you wipe, tell your parents. It's probably no big deal, but it's a good idea to let them know what's going on.  How Is It Treated?  If you're constipated you probably won't need any special treatment. Chances are you'll soon start going regularly again on your own. If your doctor decides you should come in for a visit, he or she might suggest some medicine or a change in diet to get you going. But don't take any medicine for your constipation unless your doctor recommends it.  Other than some medicine, the doctor might order an X-ray or other types of tests that check out your digestive system. But usually constipation is just constipation. You eventually poop and feel better."|`|0a59340d21076bfa762517c79658d908aa	I'm inviting some friends over, and we are all going to yell at the tv together. lol.

P82RLUppaa	I haven't seen the Uninvited yet but I do want to watch it. My friend told me that Unborn was not that interesting. I love TWILIGHT! it's an amazing movie!!!!!! I love Edward Cullen and Jacob Black!!!! What I like about Twilight is that it's a love story but also is suspenseful and interesting because Edward could just kill Bella any second. But i'm going to be honest I liked the book a lot more because it had such awesome scenes that i'd wish would have been in the movie but oh well. =)|`|hNa5oHxQaa	NONE|`|U6WskBDlaa	UNIVITED    nuff said =D|`|aCLqYRtEaa	i heart twilight|`|JxLd7EIxaa	twilight rocks!! the movie and the book are the best!|`|dCYFV6qbaa	i haven't seen unborn yet but out of twilight and uninvited, i would say twilight was better|`|aPOfW4lzaa	Twilight~ my sister and i would always hide our heads when the unborn and univited showed up!

And if Twilight is so brilliant compared to Slumdog, than I wonder why Slumdog won a Golden Globe!

8698ad788d29eb3bfd4384d7ea145f3faa	The TRUE question is this ... <br>  <br>  That $5000 is a down payment on the LIFE CYCLE Cost of that vehicle for sure ..<br>  <br>  What is the cost INCREASE for plugging it in to charge (I am sure that is going to drive the power bill up even more than it already is, and those bills have definitely increased in a lot of areas in the past year),<br>  <br>  What is the cost to MAINTAIN the vehicle -- batteries, tires, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now saying that -- it is STILL Impractical for the purposes of those of us who DO Live rurally -- for we are the ones who do use Fuel Vehicles for heavy-duty purposes (I do haul Hay Wagons, run a tractor, etc), and yes, even trying to go to the stores once a month means that I am filling up for sure (I do need to have plenty of capacity to hold the groceries/staples that I stock in my pantry).<br>  <br>  "Fashionable" -- that is NOT A good reason to purchase anything.  For me, it is the LIFE Cycle COST of the Vehicle (and can I keep the ones I have running for years more) that is the consideration for me.|`|VsamHLPOaa	Yes but not because its fashionable. I just think its time to get rid of our dependence on oil, or as much of it as we can.|`|b274bdcef529af1a95fd443e4e73d070aa	Yes!

We would buy the first one.|`|wgjz4pxpaa	Uhhh yeah|`|b8e8a6de149259fd7a51d672221ab4e4aa	Sure.  If I had an extra $5,000 to spare.

"Ooh I'm fighting with my friends! That NEVER happens to anyone else, so I might as well make a TV show outta it!" Plus they act like they're all that and it annoys me.

wwzoqIvVaa	SNL used to be groundbreaking television.  Unfortunately, they're only as good as their talent.  I agree, the only funny stuff is political.  I rarely watch it anymore, but in the mid-seventies, guaranteed, it was must see TV.    It's much like MAD TV - once in a while they mess up and create something funnhy.|`|7bg5z9yoaa	YES|`|Ybro1x2aaa	I think its the other way around, their political stuff annoys the hell out of me but some of their other stuff can be funny.  I'm not watching an hour and a half of a show for maybe 20 minutes of laughs.  They were hilarious back in the day, though.|`|7t7XzXsVaa	I don't watcj it so UI'm guessing it sucks|`|Lt8UFEIoaa	i've never really found it funny, the only funny stuff i've seen is Tom Hanks, Mike Myers, Jerry Seinfeld etc nearly 20 years ago.

Sean Connery and Ed Harris in The Rock, my favourite 'switch your mind off and watch' action movie as is the case with Con Air, in which John Malkovich and Steve Buscemi just steal every scene they are in.  A film in which I believe he really does shine is Leaving Las Vegas, but it is not a comfortable film to watch.  Worthy mention for Face/off as well.|`|cf4edaf15617b46e94d234ea845ecdebaa	any that he is not in...  no a big fan|`|tLI94qWNaa	Raising Arizona is my favorite, so funny:D lol|`|vJkEF1kPaa	face off|`|Bru5jJZraa	City of Angels|`|S4W7FojCaa	Face Off and Bangkok Dangerous.

3MztcAh9aa	I have never collected stamps or post cards, but   I am going to start collecting postage stamps.|`|Z2gIo6HKaa	i collected stamps wen i was like 7 y/o cos of a random show but i stopped well more like culdnt b botherd a month or 2 after|`|sPXbuyavaa	stamps a little when i was younger but then i gave up on it    dispatchgirl|`|c7go9FI4aa	Yes and still do. But I don't go out of my way to get stamps. I just wait for the stamps to come to me (I do not intend to make a profit on the stamps so I don't care if they are smudged or "used") when people send me mail from all over the place. Sometimes friends give me stamps from exotic places that they would otherwise throw out.    Post-cards is similar to above. I keep post-cards that people have actually sent me. Usually the stuff written at the back of the post-card is worth a lot more than the picture at the front! (Although I have bought post-cards and never gone around to sending them).|`|tFGMfDthaa	I collected stamps when I was younger. I have some really nice ones in my collection including some first day issues.|`|LAGM6I2vaa	No.|`|7nRom97Daa	never|`|F98c1ZMgaa	yes -|`|xwEEfzY7aa	Nope, never have.........
3MztcAh9aa	Gps systems are useful but not always accurate.   Some systems will tell you the wrong turn especially   in cases when the street has multiple other roads   with the same name.|`|Yyt8ZjU2aa	Not only do i believe they're not, i KNOW they're not. I have one in my car and it gave me the wrong directions more than once. Once i was trying to get to a high school football game (like 30 minutes away) and the GPS told me to drive like half-way across the state. Cuz there was another road with the same name i guess that was also in VA. so yeah lol.. i ended up driving like 20 miles when i noticed i was going north not south.. and then i realized lol|`|42752ab4ab20a3852a93491c98fdff11aa	No because my system had me turning a U turn and also once had advised me to turn down a one way street the wrong way.  I still think that they are a good tool to have but you still have to be vigilant in where you are going and have back up tools

The amount of coffee, the type of coffee, it's type of preparation, and a person's metabolism are just a few things I can think of that would impact on the results of the caffeine stimulant.

NqxDBO2Xaa	no|`|GXVanwgPaa	depends on the curriculum|`|zntOXCfuaa	I don't think having good grades means you're smart.  All it means is that you can follow directions.  Most assignments don't require a whole lot of thinking on your own, they usually just require you to process information that you've learned, and restate it in the correct way.  Grading isn't always fair, because it normally just grades what you've learned in one way.  All students learn differently, and all students produce their work in a different way.  Grading should be done in a more flexible, personalized way, but there's not enough time in the day for teachers to personalize grading for each and every one of their students.|`|TY96YpbZaa	Book smart, but i know so many school smart kids; that don't know anything about outside of school.|`|shjHhkwJaa	i think street smarts and common sense is more important then being able to solve math problems and know about world history.|`|VwtMfZMmaa	no its doesnt|`|SDSmotQiaa	Not necessarily. It doesn't mean you're stupid, but it doesn't mean you're smart either. Just like standardized tests like the SATs/ACT don't really prove intelligence either.|`|CPY2WlEvaa	no. my gpa does not equal my intelligence. im very smart, it just doesnt show on my report card.|`|Fhd9UqWtaa	Pfft, I'm a straight A student and I don't come anywhere near the definition of "smart".|`|ODKDDdToaa	No it just means you do your homework. I don't do most of my homework but I Ace every single test and have straight B's.|`|69GgJhnWaa	That depends on your definition of smart. Someone may have good grades, but they also may lack the common sense not to walk in front of a moving car. However, someone else may not be able to read, but could understand how to make a building architecturally sound at the same time. Basing intelligence on grades is like deciding a parrot is smarter than a lizard because it can talk, but I bet if you put the parrot in the desert it wouldn't know how to survive. There are many kinds of intelligence and one is not necessarily better than another. They are just different.|`|uhZ38xYkaa	Well it depends on if you are in AP/Honors, or CP.|`|KBVZOyKhaa	Not all the time.  I barely understood half the words you wrote in your sentence, so I'm just going to answer with, it makes me feel fine, I guess?|`|yCYw735Aaa	It depends.  if you apply it to your life and you remember what you learn or at least most of it then I would consider you smart.  It's not smart when you just memorize all this info and then forget about it.  Grading is just something people decided to do to see if you actually understand the basics.|`|6oZagLCvaa	book smart and life(common sense smart) are two different things|`|7C4lb4ggaa	People could cheat their way to good grades so no.|`|6ZU8Kt20aa	It really depends on who does your homework. No, I'm not being sarcastic. I went to high school with many "smart" kids who had parents writing essay and everything else for them. I think grading relates to intelligence somewhat, but I also think you don't reach your true potential until your out of school anyway, many people that do well in school do horrible in real life, and many that don't do well turn out just fine.|`|utYvlNqwaa	well you can get good grades meaning your smart in school.. but wisdom also depends if you are smart or not|`|AA11330914	having good grades means u know how to study. it doesnt measure ur actual intelligence. people in my school have iq's of about 90-100.. im at 128.. my grades are a lot lower then theirs. says something right? if  dont actually put effort into something(cuz its too easy and boring) u wont get the marks.. it doesnt mean ur stupid(just bored).. u cud state a question about just about anything and i'd have an answer for you, but my grades would never make u think that.|`|aoaVTflRaa	No someone could study everything like a parrot I think your understanding of something shows more about your intelligence|`|ee2eb688bade7663b57e940f752dc454aa	Not necessarily.  Having good grades mean you study and ace your exams. Sometimes hard work and conscientiousness trumps intelligence.  I thought British Prime Minister and statesman Winston Churchill and scientist Albert Einstein were both -- at best -- mediocre students.|`|hEDz9NqOaa	Not all the time. Common sense and street smarts vs. book smarts are way different. And sometimes having good grades just means you apply yourself and try your hardest. I get all A's, and my sister is just A, B, and some C's. But she's better at other things such as music.|`|2e5a7c8a2287633977e955d0ed3fe521aa	Good grades are not a reflection on ability but more on how you preform under exam conditions..    shame society considers a piece of paper the be all and end all indicator of intelligence.|`|sPXbuyavaa	no    dispatchgirl|`|raUjKchLaa	Not if you are doing the teacher.  Standardized intelligence is bunk.  I know smart people that can't even read.|`|ao8e2O9Saa	i dont think grades relate to intelligence because people copy and cheat. you can miss assignments and do a bunch of simple easy extra credit. smart people can slack off and get bad grades but it doesnt mean theyre idiots.

But when he got to the boys' bathroom at school, he sat down on the toilet and nothing happened. He waited a couple of minutes and . . . still nothing. He tried pushing but it kind of hurt. After a while a little poop came out, but it was small and hard, sort of like marbles.  James flushed, zipped up, and washed his hands. He didn't feel much better. Why? He was a little constipated.  What Is Constipation?  Constipation (say: con-stuh-pay-shun) is not having a bowel movement (pooping) as often as you usually do or having a tough time going because the poop is hard and dry. Normal poop is sort of soft and easy to pass, so it shouldn't be too hard to have a bowel movement.  When you poop, what ends up in the toilet is the last step of digestion (say: dye-jes-chun), a way started way back with the grilled cheese sandwich you had for lunch. After you chew and swallow food, it heads to your stomach. From there it's on to the small intestine (say: in-tes-tin), then the large intestine (or bowels), and finally out of the body through the rectum and anus.  All these parts make up your digestive system. As food moves through this system, your body soaks up water and nutrients it needs from the food. What's left over comes out as poop. Flush it and away it goes!  You probably don't think about this when you go to the bathroom. In fact, you may not think about what you do in the bathroom much at all. But when you're not going like you normally do, it may be on your mind a lot and you may feel uncomfortable.  Some people think they're constipated if they don't poop every day, but everybody's bathroom habits are different. One kid might go three times a day, and another kid might only go once every 3 days. So the real sign of whether you're constipated is if you're going less than you normally do.  What Are the Symptoms?  Besides not pooping as often as you usually do, you may feel full and have less of an appetite if you're constipated. Your belly may stick out a little, too. When you do go to the bathroom, you may feel like you have to work really hard to get the poop out, and it might hurt a little to go.  If your poop is hard and dry, pushing it out may cause tiny tears in the skin of your anus. If this happens, you might see a bit of blood on the toilet paper when you wipe. After you're done, you may have only gone a little and feel like you still have to go.  Sometimes when a kid's really constipated, some watery poop like diarrhea might leak out around the hard poop that's still inside. This can cause a messy accident, even for kids who stopped having accidents a long time ago.  If you think you're constipated, or if you see blood on the toilet paper after you wipe, tell your parents. It's probably no big deal, but it's a good idea to let them know what's going on.  How Is It Treated?  If you're constipated you probably won't need any special treatment. Chances are you'll soon start going regularly again on your own. If your doctor decides you should come in for a visit, he or she might suggest some medicine or a change in diet to get you going. But don't take any medicine for your constipation unless your doctor recommends it.  Other than some medicine, the doctor might order an X-ray or other types of tests that check out your digestive system. But usually constipation is just constipation. You eventually poop and feel better."|`|mzhFrm5Taa	Well answers, yes, if its a serious question, obviously you'd be looking for the help.

QcNkZxPaaa	People still like coldplay (me)     It's just the fact that the vida la vida album was so hyped up and it was a decent album but radio stations overplayed it.      I hate that album now. I still consider coldplay as one of my favorite bands but I can't listen to any song from that album without showing a look of disgust.      haha but enough bashing. My favorite album is 'X&Y' with 'A rush of blood to the head' closely behind.    those are absolutely amazing albums|`|RLvpfHK6aa	i absolutely love "a rush of blood to the head"  it's brilliant
ZdIaVkIcaa	One thing, you probably never noted that the glasses didn't have lenses.  I think they are silly.    The greasepaint moustache and eyebrows originated spontaneously prior to a vaudeville performance when he did not have time to apply the pasted-on moustache he had been using (or, according to his autobiography, simply did not enjoy the removal of the moustache every night because of the effects of tearing an adhesive bandage off the same patch of skin every night). After applying the greasepaint moustache, a quick glance in the mirror revealed his natural hair eyebrows were too under-toned and did not match the rest of his face, so Marx added the greasepaint to his eyebrows and headed for the stage. The absurdity of the greasepaint was never discussed on-screen, but in a famous scene in Duck Soup, where both Chicolini (Chico) and "Pinky" (Harpo) are disguising themselves as Groucho, they are briefly seen applying the greasepaint, implicitly answering any question a viewer might have had about where he got his moustache and eyebrows.    13 feature films with his siblings the Marx Brothers, you gota see them.

It wouldn't work.  you just have to develop your own wit.

I hate it when that happens. I was in that same situation. It was horrible. Ignoring them doesn't work, sadly. I have been lucky and a few times found weaknesses of them, like this one guy who always made fun of me had really feminine eyelashes and this other one I heard a nasty rumor about and threw it in his face one day...it was a very disgusting rumor and he got all defensive about it so I'm assuming it was true. I would go for an indirect way to get back at them, something you can think about when you're not around them and when you're not under pressure like that. I know it's cruel, but maybe you could start a rumor about them? If you've got photoshop skills...hahaha...|`|jIpzOQGTaa	My favorite standby is "Go **** yourself." And keep walking because you don't give a **** what those fuckers say you have better **** to do anyway.|`|gFkNVxywaa	Maybe think up half a dozen comments and just pick the best one for the situation.

WHen one of them says something say  "haha, whatever, I STILL feel sorry for you."  he'll be like what..  "Haven't you heard? Everyones talking about your small d*ck...   He'll try and shrug it off and go all quiet. Probably offer to show you it.   "No thanks, I dont have a microscope with me at the moment. So why don't you just f*ck off and go w*nk off with a pair of tweezers.     Then turn around and walk off.|`|oP3zNGfUaa	Ok. Everyone has something wrong them, nobodys perfect!!! So what you have to do is think what that thing is?  Do they have glasses, acne, big head, small head, dont get good grades on a test, too good grades on a test, or big feet?? say smart things like that and eventually they won't mess with you.|`|bC2ILdqOaa	haha i get the same problem man! i can say to agree with what they say, but it might not work in a way  eg. "your gay" "i know, id rather be gay, then look like you"  or...  try looking on google or something for good comebacks  or...  heres a few  "i ****** ur mum last night" "so? i had a threesome with ur sister and ur mum" (that might work)    "blah blah ur gay or wateva they will say"  "uhh no man, jus no, please, dont even say any more of your gay insults, cos they aint working for u"    the main thing is to not show that ur being hurt by their comebacks...    and if all else fails...    get a few of ur friends...    catch them when theyre not looking...    and stomp them into the ground!!    pain is temporary, giving up is forever

RG8ultQ1aa	I think the difficulty level of your class in high school depends on you!!!! if you don;t study then all the classes that you take are going to be difficult.         I hardly was beable to read english when I moved to Canada. so English became my hardest class in high school. most of it because shakespearean tragedys. in grade 10 i received 65% and i was good at math and science and others (85%) so i worked hard and hard in grade 12 i got 86% in english and of course 85% overall average which led me to University of Toronto.

Then the guy that was dancing says "A distraction" and then another guy comes out of nowhere and kidnaps the guy watching the guy dance. The kidnapper can be something crazy like a giant turtle or whinie the poo.
UoDtGtiLaa	this was the wrong section of yahoo answers to ask i'm afraid. you wount get much answers for this. I say Yeshiva would be the least difficult to get into, followed by Rutgers, Fordham and then NYU (this is my opinion)  If i were to get a masters, i would defintely choose NYU out of those 4. NYU and Fordham are the best of those 4. Fordham would be the most expensive if i am not mistaken
5faa7df1dbf6be8d22c72f7cca966e7baa	No, I do not think you have an attitude problem.  I think your reaction is much like my own.  When someone tries to "tell" me what to do or what I should do, I instantly turn them off.  But when someone "offers" me their opinion on a subject, I am much more receptive because they are not "telling" me what to do, just merely giving me an alternative to consider.  I hope this explanation helps in some way.  Have a great day!|`|OUkiotELaa	so do i, person, so do i........|`|AUsvrW8faa	Don't hate yourself. You have a purpose and are needed.

I served in Seeb, Oman during Desert Storm 1. I was a Medical Administrative Specialist.  We set up  and ran a field hospital similar to that in MASH.

What I can tell you is that they are one of the "nicer" brances and the bases are located near water - which means they are located in well populated areas.  The Navy will deploy you for huge chunks of time, the Marines and Army by their very nature are more militant (if that's what you're looking for, more power to you - they deffinitly have all my respect).

I mean, the opening track, "Huckleberry Jam," (named for Paisley's son, Huck) just reels me in with the blazing fast country licks.  Then, the second track, "Turf's Up," brings on the tremolo with one of the finest surf rock instrumentals I've ever heard...and it's by a country guitarist!  When the third track comes in--the first track on the album with vocals--I get a buzz from the harmonized lead guitars that are performed by Brad Paisley himself and New Zealand native Keith Urban.  With the fourth track, "Kim," I get a few minutes to relax from some great and more upbeat tunes.  "Kim," as some may already know, is for Brad Paisley's wife, Kimberly Williams-Paisley.  As soon as the softer side of Paisley shows, he brings us right back to the action with a rock instrumental, "Departure," that lets some of Paisley's fine country techniques shine through--especially his use of the G-bender system in his guitar!  After four instrumentals and one vocal track, you might be expecting another instrumental, but you'd be wrong.  For the next track, there's "Come On In," which was written by the late Buck Owens, who not only sang but also played mandolin and dobro on.  Since Owens died before finishing this great track, Paisley came in and added his vocals--to make it a duet--and his fine country guitar work.  With the remaining songs, he has "Kentucky Jelly" (bluegrass), "Playing with Fire" (blues; in tribute to Robben Ford), "More Than Just This Song" (vocal/guitar duet with Steve Wariner; in tribute to Clarence "Hank" Goddard and Chet Atkins), "Les is More" (jazz; in tribute to Les Paul), "Cluster Pluck (Grammy-nominated country instrumental featuring Brent Mason, Vince Gill, Albert Lee, John Jorgenson, James Burton, Steve Wariner and Redd Volkaert), "Cliffs of Rock City" (rock; in tribute to Eric Johnson--the title refers to Johnson's own instrumental, "Cliffs of Dover"), "Let the Good Times Roll" (the only non-country vocal/guitar duet on the album; featuring B.B. King) and then ends with an acoustic instrumental version of the gospel song, "What a Friend We Have in Jesus."    Honestly, PLAY will take any music fan on what I consider to be a true musical journey.|`|bQgOppFsaa	KISS ALIVE 35 World Tour  Valhall, Oslo, Norway - 31 May, 2008.|`|4rnIzFOraa	Legend by BOB MARLEY (R.I.P)  Plagues by The Devil Wears Prada|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	Mine is In utero, too. =]|`|yctQjQDTaa	Currently is Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness by The Smashing Pumpkins.|`|ifB3p0pGaa	mine is appetite for destruction by guns n roses
KgYIYXEtaa	Smaller posters are usually vertical because that's the way we look at other people. Hence the posters outside cinemas, and also bus shelters - in the UK, anyway. These posters are displayed among standing people, so they are designed to be seen among standing people.    Larger posters - like 48 sheet ad hoardings - are usually landscape format because that's the way the human eye is used to looking at large things (like landscapes).|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Because the display cases in all the theaters are vertical..|`|pzY0ARqDaa	They are printed that way?

dCYFV6qbaa	ok so basically the whole movie was from anna's point of view. and alex was just her imagination. alex died in the fire along with their mom. anna killed them both but it was an accident. mildred kemp was the one who killed the red head girl and her two brothers. mildred was in the room across from anna in the mental hospital and used to tell her stories. so anna got mildred's stories and real life confused. she though rachel was mildred and that rachel killed her mom so she killed rachel because she didn't like her and because she thought that rachel killed her mom. but she didn't. anna also killed her boyfriend because he knew that she killed her sister and mom. lol yeah i gave this exact same answer to another question. yeah sorry it doesn't make that much sense|`|Q1LXnEcNaa	the girl had schitzophrenia im guessing...|`|lhbEY5eJaa	me and my cousin watched it and like barely anyone got it....it was good but the ending messed it up   anna is a mental case and she killed a totally innocent person...and she was hallucinating her sister because did u notice how no one ever talked to her sister and when she talked they acted as if she wasnt there  thats all i got  sorry|`|dn2iaFIXaa	she wasnt invited..|`|CnM2U1bXaa	whoever it was they were not invited, the title says it all UNINVITED!!|`|ZPGhnsnMaa	Thats the whole point i gets you guessing whats going to happen in the next one

AA11265504	The commercial cast the other carriers in a bad light. So Verizon owning Alltel, why would they pay money to make themselves look bad?

Funny stuff.|`|1fIQXPP5aa	i would think so|`|I7sS4w0maa	Verizon didn't buy out ALLTEL they are both separate entities and the Verizon guy is still in the commercials.

ce35927379e187a9a9405823379c0faaaa	Do you remember when Gigi said that Stacy has wanted everything that she has? That's it! Stacy's out to take Rex away from her sister. I do think she should get an all out a** whipping. But I think it will only fuel her kinkiness if it comes from a man. I think Gigi and Leyla could get together and do the deed...if the two can work together for once.|`|dbKj55akaa	Oh I would have, and no sister of mine would be sleeping around in her underwear with my kid and man in the house.

Gigi needs to open her eyes, but, sadly, I doubt that she will until Stacey has done some real damage.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	I'm so glad I'm not the only one!

W8F9PboZaa	There was a rumour going round at my school last year that if you were pregnant you got 10 bonus uai points. everyone was joking round saying they'd get knocked up in September and get an abortion in November.    I mean they were joking. But the principal chucked a nut. So I don't know. Board of Studies are nazi's and definitely won't let you take it earlier or later. They'd probably go off of your school marks if you couldn't sit an exam and if you could they'd probably give you a couple of misadventure points|`|d4501c471133a25ee3f7e3b347a9c862aa	it depends on the total situation    sometimes they will let them rewrite the exams or take them early    all u can do is ask and find out and if possible make arrangements

7HBTvg8Caa	Depending on what you say it can be considered slander. But I wouldn't worry, not too many celebs have time to check out ALL the hate the flies about them.|`|Aabo2WP7aa	Nope.  Besides, you're anonymous.|`|QYDYX9B7aa	The FBI has been tracking everything you do on the internet and they plan to put you in custody.|`|Qa0s3HAeaa	Um no. They are used to it by now! :P|`|kHY0eMVraa	No.   If your from America we have freedom of speech so you can say what ever you feel like saying! :)|`|M9X9usmzaa	They say bad things about celebs in magazines, and on tv. . .and there are things on facebook and other stuff that talk bad about celebs.  so id say no.|`|bmwR7RdMaa	i just comment about the people i hate like jonas bros. and stuff like twilight on yahoo answers and i get reported !   its annoying|`|GSwjoipVaa	Everyone does it. But I think it's slander.|`|reNnLWh4aa	no there is freedom of speech for a reason|`|ibByvhgZaa	nope ITS A FREE COUNTRY EVERYONES DOING IT|`|rTwsdq6kaa	no your saying what you feel. plus ur an anonymous person|`|Y5XRdMlfaa	Its slander, but anyone can sue for that, not just celebs.|`|V1hxvQukaa	no.     it's called freedom of speech.|`|AA12051696	nope. freedom of the press. and freedom of speech.if they want to, they can try to sue for slander, if there is proof that the things they are saying are complete lies and are just saying it to ruin their rep.|`|ndEZOuuDaa	noo    return?  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|ENKPF0oaaa	if its not true|`|VYkKfCGZaa	Never heard that they could. You have freedom of speech so I don't think it matters.|`|xipapeHzaa	Not at all--just don't make threats. Shows like TMZ and gossip mags wouldn't exist if they didn't trash celebrities.     Companies that prey on the misery of celebrities will never go broke as long as we keep watching and reading them.|`|8oqurmE0aa	No, people say things like that all the time.|`|uly3aFqtaa	Miley Cyrus sucks.

Its no diff on the internet or on the tabloids in those lil magazines you see by the checkout line at walmart.|`|y73Y4aEPaa	nahhhhhh, unless u made a threat. but eh? whatever celebs are spoiled.. they will get over it.:)|`|X7fJjXFuaa	no, they are public people whose lives are often talked about in the media. you can speculate all you want or say, i hate so & so. it's mostly personal opinion so they can't sue you.|`|04TD5L6Yaa	no b/c a lot of things put about them in magazines and tv aren't true plus they get made fun of on shows like saturday night live  after all it is a free country. the chances of the person that you wrote about actually seeing what you did are 1 in a 1,000,000,000.|`|frwUHuZlaa	i guess not because everybody does that and i guess celebreties are use to that kind of stuff but downloadin g ikllegal movies is illegal|`|NrOuDXW4aa	In the first instance they would have to find you and prove you made the statement.  2nd to be worth sueing you for slander what you said would have to be pretty bad.    3rd most celebrities like having people talking about them because once people stop talking about them they also stop buying whatever the celeb is selling    Saying you don't like someones new movie or song isn't slander neither is saying you don't believe someone is right for a role.  Criticising someones dress, teeth or general appearance isn't nice but isn't really slander unless you really go over the top.    Most celebrities wouldn't be concerned with the criticism on this site so much as the loony element who want to know their addresses, phone numbers and even in one case what brand of toilet paper they use.    A celebrity makes their living by placing themselves before the public so a certain amount of scrutiny is part of the job however the stalker behaviour some people exhibit is over the top and inappropriate.|`|v7tnfgeHaa	That is a good question, the country isn't so strict about libel laws.|`|1bvl5zbkaa	Half the internet is made up of people trashing Celebrities.  I don't think you have to worry.|`|xkZbjKNdaa	no  why do you think perez hilton is the gossip magnet  he can get away with anything he wants to say|`|uJG0mW4Maa	no.... the tabloids do it all the time.|`|Z5A33IR3aa	nope the internet is open to the public unless it is some kind of threat|`|sveBTYSpaa	no its legal :)|`|skXsz4Gbaa	no cuz we have freedom of speech|`|paHt6Yi8aa	technically, you can sue for anything, you can put it up, if they try to sue you, just put them towards the people magazine people who diss all of the celebs, they can sue, but they'll probably lose...|`|X3scjhpGaa	well i wouldn't think its illegal but dont go to far or they might.|`|AA11521202	nope, we are protected by the 1st amendment..... unless your not a citizen of the USA...|`|3tDqt9sXaa	its called freedom of speech    as long as it is an opion and not saying untrue stuff about them that is not an opion and as long as it does not but anyone in danger|`|AA10703100	If you state it as an opinion, it is not illegal and they can' sue you. If you present it as a fact then you are liable for slander. Example below:    Opinion: "I think she is a prostitute.Look at the way she dresses!!"    Fact: "she is a prostitute. she dresses provocatively and waits for guys on the 42nd street."    The sample is crude, but you should get the picture. If you spread the word as though it is a fact. be prepared to be sued and possibly go to jail.|`|zsx97lOuaa	most u can trash and be perfectly honest|`|b618103502f7e36884dcc717dadabc94aa	You can say whatever you want; unless it will ruin their carrer/ life forever :D :D:D :D:D :D:D :D:D :D:D :D:D :D ? trash talk untill the break of dawn!! lol

I have heard You calling in the night....and so on, it was written and originally recorded by one of the priests that was in the order called St. Louis Jesuits and that is what their albums are listed under. I have 2 of their albums but not the one with this song on it. This version was written by Dan Schutte.     There are 2 other songs with the same title. One was written by Tom Booth and the other by Rory Cooney. The title could be either Here I Am or Here I am, Lord. All 3 of these songs are in our music book at church.

AA11309717	I always thought that non profit meant that whatever they received was done out of goodwill, that is via donation whether it be time, money  or skill. So I'd say the non profit probably doesn't pay the travel bill or the trip it would be the actor donating time money and services<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

73380f4f046c754e124ea1369d29812faa	welll okay.  at the end, it was all a flashback of what REALLY happened. like the first hour or so of the movie was imagined; Anna, the main character, was crazy. She needed mental help because of the loss of her family members traumatized her.. the first hour of the movie, we see the movie through anna's eyes. In anna's eyes, she is a victim.    At the end, however, it shows what REALLLy happened. First of all, Anna's mom AND her sister were both killed in the fire. It was an accident that Anna caused. Also, her boyfriend, she dropped him off the rock when he told her the truth about her mom and sister's death. how she did it. and she killed Rachel Summers, who was really innocent.    Mildred Kemp was the psycho old lady who was Anna's roomate. Milderd told Anna all these stories and Mildred had those pearls. So when Anna returns home, she sees rachel having an affair with her dad, and Rachel's pearls remind Anna of all those stories Mildred Kemp told her so she imagines all of the movie. Anna imagines that Alex was there and that Alex killed Rachel, but Alex was dead since the beginning. Anna kills Rachel out of rage and confusion, and possibly some possesed-ness going on too.   All those images that Anna sees, all of those freaky spirits and how she saw her mom and the 3 kids Mildred killed, those were spirits trying to warn her about what she was doing and how she was confused.    At the end, where she tells her psychiatrist, " I finished what I started", she meant that she finished killing Rachael, because if her mom and sister never died, she would have killed Rachael in the beginning.    but im still somewhat confused tho.    HOPE THAT HELPED!|`|dCYFV6qbaa	ok well the first person's answer was good. rachel summers was innocent. she was only killed because anna didn't like her and she thought that rachel was the one who actually killed her mom  the girl in the mental hospital is mildred kemp. and mildred killed the red head girl and her brothers.

xXQDHNDHaa	a girl who's step mom is trying to kill her, the twist is the end which is the step mom is in fact not trying to kill her, and she is in fact crazy and responsible for her moms death, and her sister, who is in fact dead meaning all this time she wasn't really talking to her sister. She kills her step mom in the end and gets put back in the mental hospital.|`|1Qs3wuxlaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uninvit...    full plot and everything. :]

O.C. is bad.  DITC is one of my all time favs!!!  I'm going to have to go with "You & Yours", even though "Can't Go Wrong" is just as bad.  He is my fav emcee out of DITC.<br>  2.  A lot of hip hop, but diverse.  I like old R&B, jazz, some classical and some neo-soul and even some alternative.  I also enjoy at time some 80's rock n roll.  I have a huge music collection and it continues to grow.<br>  3.  Probably Lupe Fiasco.  He went to UPenn and his lyrics are bright and he's an above average in intelligence rapper.  He seems like he keeps himself well "versed" in rap and life.<br>  4.  She is quite stunning, but only an average violin player.  I think right now she is riding someone else's coattails to success and for a classically trained violinist that truly is "frowned" upon.<br>  5.  My favorite of all time is still "New Jack CIty" and always will be.  Even though it's old, it's still #1 in my heart.<br>  6.  Rule #1 of a TRUE friend...you don't sleep with friends ex's, especially if they were married.  He totally crossed the line of friendship and of he will do that to you...who's to say what else he wouldn't be afraid to do?  True friends show respect and he didn't.  Friends NEVER cross that line, it's a known fact.  Let him stay at home and think about.

F5MnZ2hSaa	The lyrics are good, brilliant in fact. There's a good story there.<br>  <br>  Only issue: you'll be singing for days, man!|`|9ZRvPegvaa	You really are talented! I wish I could put a sentence together.  On the positive negative, it if far too long for one song.  Can you not split it into two songs.  The average song has about 3 verses and a bridge, you have 8 verses there plus some more. So it is more like a beautiful poem.<br>  <br>  So how does it sound?  Get in touch with Leona Lewis's manager. I think she will do a justice to your lyrics, and that is a big compliment.  i think she has an amazing voice.|`|7101ca25abf1e27ea43268cf9eca7944aa	Very good, but a bit on the long side, To get some one to sing it he would have a job to remember the words.|`|nucQYOf3aa	Wow..That was a really long and really good song..Do u have a career in Songwriter..!|`|y7jbhHURaa	i like it but it is a bit on the long side although that's not always a bad thing.
F0q3gi5Gaa	i think its boring, all they do is argue back and forth.|`|KBVZOyKhaa	I think it's right because it discusses how the president is suppose to act or what he might do when he or she becomes president [if they're talking about the president or the election]; but I also think it's boring and very hard to pay attention to, because the politicians go on and on and on about the same stuff! Just shut up and move on with another topic! That's why I stopped watching the politic channel on TV.
LJwCMgj7aa	He would be berated by Squidworth because, as we all know, he is a republican. Spongebob would chant Obama's marta "Yes we can!"

Or it might be one of Batman's lesser known villians who comes in for some mayhem in Gotham.

OcfL1QNcaa	The biggest question here is "is the sage of six paths dead?"    In one interview, Kishimoto stated that the Third and Fourth hokage  were pretty much tied in terms of overall power, and that the Third (and thus third and fourth) was the strongest dead ninja.    Why is this important? There are no stronger ninjas DEAD. (note, this was published before Itachi, Orochimaru, and Jiraiya died, but may include them as well). If the sage of six paths is alive, then he would presumibly be one of the strongest, alongside Madara, and company.    However, Madara is as old as the founding member of konoha, while the sage of six paths would be as old as the ninja world itself (probably before kekke genkai, which are tied into shinobi bloodlines, developed, and the clans formed.) He would be older than the uchiha clan itself, and many others. It is probable under the law of "the next generation surpasses the former" idea that he did pass away, and ninjas have simply developed considerably by then. It would be just kishimoto's style to throw him in there, though.    Yet, the rinnegan does not surpass byakugan and sharingan by 100 times. Each has their own unique abilites... yes the rinnegan is theoretically the strongest, but it doesnt have say, Madara's power to control the nine tails. They are just tools, and are dependent on the shinobi.    By virtue of these facts, we need to know if SSP is alive, and we would have to know the full extent of the Rinnegan and Sharingan's powers. (Not to mention SSP and Madara's own) before making any sort of conclusion.|`|4UeOIGuhaa	Obviously since Naruto is the main character.    I vote for Pein.

vgPhCbL9aa	hey babe =] |`|uL8c83rOaa	ummm...  i really don't believe in anything anymore.  but i think if "god" gave you your sexual organs then im pretty sure it was for a reason other than giving life through it.  if masturbating is what you crave at this moment then proceed.  and you shouldn't feel guilty afterwords for giving what your body desires.  it's like saying you feel guilty after you just finished eating.  it's a natural thing.  just do as you please...  ;}|`|IBSTTdm2aa	Well i have a story that might help you feel better.. so i go to a catholic highschool and we have a few nuns (no not hardcore like black outfits nuns haha) and one teaches theology and she told one of her junior classes she does/has masterbated.|`|PNkhcbMcaa	Dont feel guilty, its a good way to fulfill your sexual desires without acting on them|`|r3sNTIvqaa	I honestly don't see the problem. I don't go much by the whole sexual "rules" in Christianity (except I am saving for marriage, but for personal reasons). Think about it, Mary was an unwed pregnant teenager (no offense to anyone, but it is true, just under special circumstances). Don't feel guilty, it's not listed in the ten commandments that you can't do that, at least I don't think.|`|ZyPqznLFaa	At least you're not messing around in premarital sex... it could be worse.|`|f4c5f36a540069fbe952ea342c721c74aa	I guess you're between a rock and a hard place.  If masturbation is a sin in your religion, then don't do it.  Don't be a hypocrite.  Perhaps you are being tested.      As for me.....I don't buy into any of that.  It's my body and I will do with it what I please.|`|mD4Xn3jNaa	Gods gonna kill you. And give you aidsssssssss|`|sJ0sLvaPaa	Next time just turn out the lights so God can't see you...|`|KFpEaY3raa	think pure thoughts while doing it ? lol idk.|`|nGxrvQavaa	Get a toy, then it's pleasuring you.... technically no longer you.        Don't worry about it. There's nothing wrong with it.      ;)|`|RI277UX4aa	well the catholic faith is the only one with actual specific RULES against masturbation in christianity    i'm not tryin to tell u how to live ur life, but if u feel that there is guilt in your heart then maybe it's from God. maybe u should try to stop. fight back ur temptation.|`|OxaonF5aaa	If you feel guilty why do it in the first place ?    You really want to pleasure yourself, you should make sure that its not making you a bad, cummon its human.  God make you that way, gave you the parts ans organs you should use to get pleasure after a hard day of work or something.|`|s0zyoyljaa	i wonder what kinda God does the first person believe.     does the bible say masturbation is a Sin?|`|X7fJjXFuaa	it's perfectly normal to masturbate. i don't think you should let your christian values come into it at all. most people lie and deny that they do it, but it is really common.     if it feels good, go on. at least you are practicing safe sex.|`|6A0GkXXjaa	Wow, I would never ask a question like this with my face up here for all to see, you've got some balls haha. Anyway, normally, I think religion is a good thing, but these are the kinds of things where it loses me, doing that doesn't make you a bad person, it's natural, and it's better than actually going out and having sex and getting pregnant, isn't it? Yes.

AA12368449	The movie was based on a book by Vikas Swarup, and the screenplay was written by Simon Beaufoy(also wrote full monty). It is fantastic, but I wouldn't call t amazingly complex. It is well written but well within the boundaries of a vast amount of good writers. Realising that story and putting it to screen was a masterpiece for Danny Boyle.    My interpretation of Salim's actions is one of finality. The dream was to make money, to survive away from the slums and be a success. Salim has finally done the right thing and let the latika go, so she and Dev Patel's character could fulfil their dreams.In doing so he has sealed his fate. All he could do was make the most of his situation. Surrounding himself by money, as if he has fulfilled his dreams. He is no longer a slumdog - he has made it - or so he is trying to kid himself.    He knew it was his end. He was going to go out swinging.|`|OiU2Os7Naa	i know i loved it i know it was in India

QZzQdh43aa	this is true. leos do need some spotlight, but they relish when they get the majority of it. it also depends how much her moon influences her because it's possible for her to exhibit more of her moon than her sun. overall though, she could be happy with you dominating. i'm a scorpio sun with moon in leo, and my taurus sun with moon in gemini has complete control over me. <br>  leo can be dominant with other people though. they have fun, but they have to enjoy the person they're sharing the spotlight with|`|yxotSLIfaa	I think sun sign alone cannot say about the future of relationships.<br>  In the outside, it looks like Leo is more dominant, but inside Pisces can be the real ring-leader.|`|rnqgiRkWaa	go here it puts both your charts and all sings together and gives you a full length detail <br>  <a href="http://www.adze.com/VenusFiles/" rel="nofollow">http://www.adze.com/VenusFiles/</a>|`|oDdXpghDaa	Yes, I believe she would end up dominating you... and while you'd appreciate feeding her ego for a bit you'd get pretty bored of it after a while and eventually say F* it because it will be forever one sided...<br>  <br>  She may also not understand your need for personal space and time...
6HyFHrfIaa	You seem to be attracted to Fire sign women (Rhona Mitra- Leo, Elisha Cuthbert and Britney Spears- Sagittarius) with Air sign Moon.

When a band stands up there and starts playing the fiddle, acoustic guitar and steel guitar, it makes me feel I'm hearing something real special and not just noise and words.

When I was 9 and on holiday with the family in an old welsh cottage. One night I put my book down on the floor to go to sleep, but couldn't. A few minutes later I reached down to retrieve it and start reading again, and for some reason I looked under the bed. <br>  <br>  There in the semi-dark, all hairy legs, pulsing body and LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME was the biggest spider I've ever seen (I know, I know, I was 9). I swear, this thing looked big enough to lift weights and it's eyes actually glittered when I got my torch to get a better look. I'm not that bothered by spiders but this thing actually worried me, and parents were called. My mother couldn't come in the room when she knew what it was (arachnophobia) so my father disposed of it with a pint glass and a bit of card. <br>  <br>  The beastie had to pull it's legs in to fit under the glass and showed itself to be VERY active once it knew it was cornered. All the fangs and legs and hairy bits meant I didn't sleep very well, even after it had left via a window.

Bob says, "You know, I bet he'll jump."     The blonde replied, "Well, I bet he won't."     Bob placed a $20 bill on the bar and said, "You're on!"     Just as the blonde placed her money on the bar, the guy on the ledge did  a swan dive off the building, falling to his death.     The blonde was very upset, but willingly handed her $20 to Bob, saying,  "Fair's fair. Here's your money."     Bob replied, "I can't take your money, I saw this earlier on the 5 PM  news and so I knew he would jump."     The blonde replied, "I did too; but I didn't think he'd do it again."

According to them there were 18 episodes in seasons2,3 and 4.  The series ended at that point.  It has been shown in syndication on other channels but it originated on HBO and was pretty risque.  the syndication channels cut those parts out when they show it.  The episodes were shown without commercials on HBO but have commercials in them on the other channels so I do not know how long each episode is suppose to be.  In any case, they make it last an hour.

I really find water signs attractive, though....except for my sign of cancer, though.    Geminis guys and girls, it's true, are GORGEOUS. But, god, are they...umm..well, they're just superficial. lol. Sagittarius girls I find too tomboy-ish. And the guys, it's true what you said...somewhat like geminis in that sense.....but, they are too like smiley for me, I guess? I dunno, I just really like "cute" adorable looking guys, and sag guys don't have that look about them. Aqua guys seem too detached, aqua girls seem totally classy, pretty, like they have a good head on their shoulders, and to me, practically perfect. lol.  Libra guys have a very pleasant smile and are very very charming when given a chance to speak! I love them.    Oh yeah, and Libra girls are EXTREMELY alluring. But...I wouldn't exactly call them sexy. I dunno. I would say they are voluptious, beautiful, even gorgeous, but I wouldn't call them demure or sultry. I dunno, what's the word I'm looking for.

Ho9VGCmuaa	Your question about songs that incorporates the harmonica into the song without the harmonica being the focal point is an interesting one, because more often than not nowadays if harmonica is in a song it is a lead instrument.  However, the old blues harmonica players were true journeymen musicians who had to blend in with lots of bands and situations    - a perfect example of this is the Muddy Waters band  - my highest recommendation right off would be most of his Chess recordings - he always used the best players, and we're talking James Cotton and Little Walter, just for starters.    Of course there's tons of other music where the harmonica blends in so well that you almost don't realize that it's there - on lots of film soundtracks, for example.  I'd suggest keeping your ears open for that and start noting down when you hear an example.|`|2xazdHU5aa	any thing by the band Blues Traveler  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pCDs_0zb...  the video is odd i will let you know that

I don't know where you got your info, but there's a lot of independent and free recordings out there, including performances of compositions by Beethoven and Mozart.

TsBSLY9taa	I've never watched Wife Swap before but after that mess of an episode I doubt I'd ever watch it again. {belch}    I for one could not believe that ABC/the producers of this show would let this man verbally abuse his guest wife..especially in front of his own children. By his actions on the show it made me think he may be also abusive towards his wife who has adopted his elitist attitude and his children whom they both are turning into little clones of themselves. His Wife Rene doesn't have any collage degrees as she claimed.    I wonder where she got her new age degree {rofl} that lets her stand in the middle of a room and push the bad energy out by jumping up and down and screaming?     I was reading a blog about him and one of his friends  posted and said there was hardly any editing, so what we saw was the real Steven , also the friend added Steven tried to even take over the directing of the segment.     Steven Fowler may have gone to an ivy league school, but BIG DEAL he sure didn't learn any social skills while there did he?     I think the man is socially retarded and can only relate to snobs such as himself.    Steven Fowler proved  to me the old adage of, you can't polish a turd.|`|iy9xz6oNaa	never heard of him.|`|0jhzFOV8aa	I think he is an elitist who ridicules those who cling to their guns and religion.  No small wonder he lives in Mrs. Pelosi's congressional district.  This is the current ruling class in America, and he was less clever than the politicians about concealing his contempt for his "inferiors".  This question should be in the society and culture section as well.     This show touched an exposed wire in the American psyche. In sociology we discuss ethnicity, religion, race, class and gender.  It's about class.  Many people are worried about their job and how this country will emerge from this economic crisis. Here comes this 'top percentile' Brit to teach us backward colonists a lesson.  His oppressive attitude is precisely what our immigrant ancestors sought to escape.  His ideology is exclusive and elitist.  It's the stuff that incites unrest in the oppressed.      I'm afraid this show is fast becoming like a modern "Uncle Tom's Cabin," story. Stephen Fowler stars as Simon Legree.     A fast test of character is how a person treats their waitress or the landscaper. It is no test when one is among superiors or peers the facade is exercised to maintain social standing.  How one treats those with less money, power, education and opportunities is most telling.    BTW I am an educated Californian who has lived abroad with my European spouse.|`|d1f4df25e3d45f0e9e4b1146d352dae1aa	I'm pretty sure if I said how I really honestly feel about him, I would get my account deleted....sooo...I'll just say that he is an embarrassment to the human race...and leave it at that!    (I really wished Gala coulda b*tchslapped him - just once before she left though!)|`|c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	I saw it. He was disgusting. He's already having trouble because of the episode, rightfully so. One Brit I'd like to see go back home.    Edited to add: By trouble I mean his address was posted on the Wife Swaps Reality Roll blog and he threatened to sue if they do not remove it and he has himself posted his own address on other public accessible sites. He has since been receiving threats. He is indeed in San Francisco and his address in not difficult to find. Also, the company that Fowler is CEO of is partnered with a wheelchair company that makes wheelchairs for disabled vets. Many vets saw this program and are writing in saying they refuse to purchase those chairs. His wifes company is also in jeopardy because of his (and her non-)actions.    Hlfmoonbay~I am from the Bay Area as well and have been here all of my life. While I have met some cruel, arrogant, and abusive bullys like Stephen Fowler, I have NEVER met any foreigner who came to this country who has such an intentionally cruel prejudice against and hostility towards it and it's people like that bigot.    I also have nothing against ABC for airing this. Ever here of karma? Good that such an arrogant jerk will get what is coming to him.|`|VEE2Bxrlaa	I think he is too smart for his own good and he has single handedly destroyed his wife's business  and opened up his family for ridicule .    I think he is better of in England where they still try to maintain  class distinction and enjoy  the national pass time of the royal family. Mean while he will have to slum it out with the peasants in the USA .    And don't be fooled .He and his wife both have illusions of grandeur  and intellectual superiority and they are the same people she is just better at hiding her agenda .    Thank you ABC for exposing these misfits and I hope the IRS audits  them .|`|PT022gkeaa	Mr Fowler is a textbook malignant narcissist. Some are talking harm, but that is just being stupid. The Fowlers just aren't that important in this world. The only harm they will suffer is the harm they did to themselves with their overbearing snobby elitist behavior. It's called: KARMA. The irony is that they are probably taking the response of insulted Americans as the reactions of knee jerk neocon 'middle dwellers' with little or no intelligence or wisdom in the ways of the world. His attempt to come off as broadly egalitarian fails in his obvious disdain for any person that doesn't meet his self proclaimed level of intelligence.        I laugh that they deliberately did not say that the FOULers live in San Francisco. Instead, they called it 'Big City'. No matter, most of us can recognize the distinctive streets of San Francisco, as well as read the street signs on 101 saying SF Airport and San Bruno Avenue as we could clearly see in the background when they left the go cart business. It's obvious the show changed the name of the Cityn because the Fowlers are in business locally and were seen by anyone watching this show as the elitist snobs they believe themselves to be. Damn that pesky Golden Gate Bridge!        I live in the Bay Area and unfortunately, there are many out there like the Fowlers, but not many quite as extreme. His egregious manners and use of degradation to make himself feel or appear superior was appalling. He shows no class, which makes me seriously question his intelligence. Class is something that in some people is inherent, but it can also be learned. Someone with an alleged (self stated) IQ of 150+ should know how he comports himself publicly, and in front of a camera to a nationally televised audience could possibly be seen in a negative light. I think his ego won't allow him to see that his stupidity is his arrogance. He is a demagogue in his own little narrow minded world. His sesquipedalian tendency appears to be an affectation, exacerbated by his desire to denigrate the lady from Missouri. Can you understand those words Fowler?        As to Renee, her refusal to be a proud American by merit of no choice by birth makes this woman a nightmare and the type of rabid left wing liberal San Franciscans that many of us in the Bay area have come to loathe and be embarrassed by. I would really like it if these people would remove themselves from this country and jog their little snooty pretentious butts right on across the Big Pond. What disgusting people!        "Respect your body", but apparently, do not respect others. Isn't this how you raise narcissistic little future serial killers? To disrespect an adult woman in front of your children, to jeer at her, to make fun is setting a good example? To brainwash them and teach them to be rude when an adult addresses them even in a simple goodbye is something to admire? The man is a cretinous knuckle dragging moron, and his wife is probably subjugated by him. I pity da foo'.|`|GC6OBM7waa	For those of you who missed it here is a link to Stephen on YouTube telling Gayla she speaks two languages - bad english and redneck:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fkFWV8lh...|`|qB9sKJz1aa	It is also a shame that he was transferring such ignorant behavior to his children by not allowing them to speak to her.

The sad thing is that it seems to be rubbing off on his children.|`|VjhIrQiNaa	what makes me so sad about this episode was that gayla truly had an appalling reading (and i can only assume writing) aptitude.  not that she was illiterate, but there was no way that she could communicate above an 8th grade level.  however, that's not her fault if she received her education in a small town in which no one went to college and being smart was not considered a virtue.      gayla is a victim of circumstance, and if that woman ever came into my house, i would sooner welcome her with open arms and offer to help improve her reading skills than berate her for being an idiot.    what truly breaks my heart is that assuming fowler can vote, he probably voted for obama and pelosi.  he has poisoned the environmentalist and democratic agendas by acting like the biggest pompous asshole ever.  i hope renee divorces him, he ruined her life.|`|AA11180567	What I noticed was that he almost continuously had a glass of organic wine in his hand.

e4h5yVXgaa	I agree w mm100, I dont like Capricorn ppl either. I'm trying to get rid of mine. I don't deal w that rigid routine crap. They all around just make me sick. They are boring, sorry to sound mean, but I personally feel that passionately about boring ppl which I find cap the epitome of and they are all around me. They are melodramatic too (clinnnngy!!!).<br>  <br>  I like other Scorpio's for love. Cancer's can be ok if they are wild, but w Cancer's you have to come to an understanding, which is v easy to come to w a lil communication. But that took a while to figure out, bc water signs aren't communicators. <br>  <br>  Taurus, great friends for a while, and for love while the fascination last. But for a love relationship I believe the polarity b/t the two is too much to bear for either party. And certainly not enough love is going to be able to over look the differences.<br>  <br>  Virgo's? No!! Virgo's only look at things from a logical view point. Scorpio like's ALL the view point's. They need ALL the view point's in order for them satisfy their exsistance. Virgo cannot and will not do this- they can't. It goes against everything that they are, and bc they cannot connect on this level that's where they'll become v displeased w one another.<br>  <br>  Pisces are good I suppose. But if you are dealing w a Scorpio that is ambitious, then the Pisces may have to grow a backbone, can't be lazy, and has to be the strong type of Pisces, dynamic and adventurous.<br>  <br>  No Fire or Air signs generally. Though I admire them, but then again just like every sign...<br>  <br>  It's hard to pair a Scorpio up. Scorpio's are so contradictive and are the only sign w three stages. It's a v complex sign that are known for going through a lot in their lives. Nothing's simple w a Scorpio, including his love life.<br>  <br>  With that said I'm a Scorpio and I think any sign is suitable for dating. I've dated every star sign and the only ppl I like are other Scorpio's.|`|AA10197672	I do not recoment dating another Scorpio. Been there, done that and did  not work out at all! You need a sign that can balance out the differences. Cancer men are perfect with Scorpio women. The passion these two insanely signs share once in love is incredible! Both are water sign, both are very sensitive and passionate, loving, caring. Both are very loyal and care about family and care about one another. They are a great team together and will be very successful in life. Scorpio makes Cancer feel like home and makes him feel comfotable to come out of his shell. Scorpio provides a great deal in emotional security for Cancer and assures him that he can trust her. She never does anything to bring the jealous side of Cancer and understands Cancers emotional ups and downs and is there to help him through it..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://astrology.about.com/od/cancerlove..." rel="nofollow">http://astrology.about.com/od/cancerlove...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.starlightastrology.com/can-sc..." rel="nofollow">http://www.starlightastrology.com/can-sc...</a>|`|oDdXpghDaa	Pisces - we'll get you, and you'll get us...|`|QZzQdh43aa	go with virgos, cancers, tauruses, and pisces<br>  i know everyone says scorpio and capricorn are compatible, but i'm a scorpio too and i'm not fond of capricorn people<br>  stay away from firey signs and air signs. i wouldn't recommend dating another scorpio either, it'll be a clash of the egos and you two will have alot of possession problems unless other signs in your birth chart are compatible|`|8sMr9Vmtaa	See <a href="http://zodiacal-compatibility.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://zodiacal-compatibility.blogspot.c...</a><br>  The site explains compatibility between all possible combinations among the zodiacal signs, with emphasys on relationships.|`|AXE1ukupaa	An entergetic Carpricorn or another Scorpio are the best I think<br>  <br>  The worst, an imersonal air sign.|`|ZS38T8M7aa	Cancer<br>  Pisces<br>  Capricorn<br>  Scorpio<br>  Virgo<br>  <br>  Scorpios should stay away from fire and air signs.<br>  They usually work better with water and earth signs.|`|AA11195715	ur best match wld b ur own element water<br>  pisces nd cancer<br>  4 your worst match wld b aquarious|`|OCzss4xJaa	Cancer and Pisces are good choices for a date.

Once it gets down to the top 36, Idol is filmed in front of a live audience. Here's a link to the website. Sign up. When they have tickets available, they will email you a link to their site. Usually they don't give you much notice (48 hours at most and you will only get one opportunity per season) and it will either be for a full dress rehearsal or the actual show (you can usually choose between performance or results night. The full dress rehearsal is done right before the live show - no judges, just Ryan (actually there are fake judges that pretend they're the real judges). Contestants will be in full dress and make-up. I went to a dress rehearsal for Season 4 and was invited to attend a live show for season 7 which I wasn't able to attend. My sister went to the Season Finale Performance show for the Davids.

There are other sites that you can use though.  Hopefully they're just doing some intense maintenance on the website itself!

W840msNTaa	interesting ending, not what I expected.    I'm not into sad/romance movies so I was kind of disappointed with the whole movie.    also, the middle felt like forever, it just dragged on.    Overall, an ok movie.|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	i loved it alot!!! i mean it was a very very good movie and i found myself crying at the end|`|AA11229714	i loved it. but it was really sad.|`|P7v7Fbt7aa	I think overall the show was okay a little different the plot and sads too...i felt that there was no reason one should change himself/ herself for another|`|73380f4f046c754e124ea1369d29812faa	This movie was so sad. It gave me an epiphany of life. Its such an amazing story, its sad, but so like... godly. Who sacrafices their life for seven other peoples lives so they can be happy? Its so amazing. Made me cry so hard. But i hated how he just left her. He should have spent some time with her before he died. So he could die happy.

AA10491480	cuz he is dead now .and its supposed to be that the other side of the mirrprs is where all dead people are in ther own dead world .|`|IhZSaDXDaa	Because he basically sacrificed his own life for his family and others to be doomed.|`|Y5032C2laa	yeah i saw the movie i had to watch it 2 and throughout the whole movie i didnt understand it
dCYFV6qbaa	basically the first person is right. anna was imagining alex the whole time. anna killed rachel because she thought that rachel was really mildred. she also didn't like rachel. and anna killed alex and her mom too but on accident. and she killed her boyfriend because he knew that she killed alex and her mom|`|QmSIsUZvaa	i guess rachel wasnt bad all along, the girl was just crazy. i was really dissappointed because they really tricked you with the previews and everything.|`|jAoc49N8aa	Alex did die but Anna was crazy and she met the real Mildred Kemp in the institution. She imagine that Alex was alive but she wasn't. Then she killed Rachel using the story of Mildred but she only killed her because she didn't like her.

Avoid the movie or sneak in and sneak out...|`|gWXjNa4gaa	i just watched it. its not even a little gorey. in fact, the movie is dumb|`|AA10491480	its an action movie silly not scary at all just action|`|JXaq4uqBaa	no. not at all.|`|AA12364667	No not at all|`|8V1loJ6daa	I just watched it last night.

cSceVisnaa	T BAG|`|W4xJGKk2aa	no, but Hannah Montana The Movie is the series finale . there are still about 24 episodes left so new episodes will continue through the year, but the shows is ending. in the movie she will have to decide to continue being hannah or give up her dream, because her dad think she is forgetting about the important things in life and is to focused on Hannahs popularity.. but if you look closely in the trailer you can see her performing on stage as herself, so in the end of the movie i think she will finally tell the world that she is Hannah which would end the serie because that is the main thing about the show. without her secret double life, she wouldn't be Hannah Montana.|`|N6cuuDAmaa	I hope not!! Everyone is used to Miley and Selena's already known as Mikayla and the enemy so I really hope they keep Miley!|`|oQrtjivsaa	I HOPE SO!!|`|OsiD4HIzaa	no the show is in it's last season because miley wants to live a life of an older teen. Selena will not be replacing her.|`|a8qFkmSzaa	wow! really? I heard that after the hannah montana movie thats the end of hm. I haven't heard bout sel gomez part tho. wared u hear that?|`|JduQHocdaa	You can only hope and pray that it is!!|`|XSa8fgNIaa	OBVIOUSLY Not..|`|XOlnc8iBaa	You are wrong. Hannah Montana the movie is coming out with Miley.|`|oDx3Jgdcaa	selna gomez is NOT playing hannah montana. hannah is over, theyre just finishing up the season...stay tuned for new episodes though! =)|`|xKVMbHoKaa	LOL. selena cant take over as hannah montana. its cuz she already plays mikayla, hannahs biggest rival. and, i think it might be the end of the show cuz on the trailer of the movie, i saw miley standing on stage without her wig.|`|GilxwZ2Haa	They are ending the whole series with the movie|`|TrHefyK0aa	i hope not.  im a selena fan but miley is just better at singing.  can selena even sing?|`|AA12269023	Pfft, hate to break it to you, but the news you got was from a pathetic, bored, rumour starting idiot.  Miley WILL eventually end the show, after the movie, and a possible 4th season, but Selena WILL NOT be replacing her.  That would just be stupid, she already has her Wizards of Waverly Place show.    I'm just sad that Miley will eventually stow away the blonde wig, cause I will always see her as both Hannah and Miley.  Btw, that's what the movie's all about! Her choosing one path because she sick of living a double life. You should go see it when it comes out!    Got Miley?|`|zlNFIECRaa	i beleive she is but i doubt selena gomez will take over. they look nothing alike.!|`|zsx97lOuaa	we can only pray she will|`|3ok7pKMNaa	Dumbest rumor ever.|`|1UKcEW93aa	I hope they both fall off a stage and fall into a coma from which they will never reawaken.|`|d7b8f18c89ed9f003ea45f3b4aeb20ceaa	i think she is ... cuz shes making a movie.  usually when they make a movie about the series.  after the show obviously means they're kinda quitting.  just like after the Lizzie Mcguire Movie Hilary Duff   quit to pursue her music career... I think that's what   Miley Cyrus is going to do, since she's getting more fame.|`|XspXm3WHaa	miley = hannah. in the movie you will  find out. selena = alex on wizards of waverly place. no that is a dumb rumor. they aren't the same person. that would just be stupid.|`|4rn3cGy0aa	Retarded rumor, Miley said so herself.|`|7nAe7oDpaa	Obviously, that's not true. She's not quitting the show && if she was, they'd probably end the series. Who honestly wants Selena Gomez to do Hannah Montana? Big no no.|`|jr9iEmuoaa	uhm, i dont think so. she should just quit her career overall because she has no talent.|`|HTpVbeu0aa	what the double hockey stix??? ofcourse not!|`|FYT97XLgaa	PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BE TRUE!!!
ZyGyDLsDaa	There is a series of youth-oriented SF/fantasy movies:  Josh Kirby... Time Warrior: Chapter 1, Planet of the Dino-Knights (1995)  Josh Kirby... Time Warrior: Chapter 2, the Human Pets (1995)   Josh Kirby... Time Warrior: Chapter 3, Trapped on Toyworld (1996)    Josh Kirby... Time Warrior: Chapter 4, Eggs from 70 Million B.C. (1996)  Josh Kirby... Time Warrior: Chapter 5, Journey to the Magic Cavern (1996)  Josh Kirby... Time Warrior: Chapter 6, Last Battle for the Universe (1996)  Here's an IMDb review about Chapter 1:  Josh Kirby is a boy who comes in contact with a piece of the Nullifier, an alien device capable of destroying the universe! He soon finds himself racing across the time stream in a craft built by Erwin 1138, who is from the future. ("1138" is a bow to George Lucas of course.) Erwin has scattered pieces of the device throughout the time stream to hide them from the evil Dr. Zoetrope (perhaps a reference to Francis Ford Coppola's production company, American Zoetrope); but, the villainous doctor has found out where the pieces are. Now, it's a race against the clock to find all the pieces before Zoetrope does. In Chapter 1, after leaving 1994, Josh and Erwin find themselves in medieval England, where dinosaurs are considered dragons. As Josh and Erwin search for a piece of the Nullifier, they are caught in a war between two brothers.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...  "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension" is science fiction but doesn't involve time travel, so that's one that can be ruled out.     So far, no title has popped into my head, but I'll be giving it some more thought.
0BthrqvAaa	OVGuide.com has thousands of free movie/tv links... check them out. Watch-movies.net going down is a bummer but there are like a lot of other sites that are better, and OVGuide is def. one of them!|`|tmwOwc0Laa	http://divxmoviez4u.blogspot.com/  the only problem is you have to have super speed internet or else it takes forever for the videos to come up
dCYFV6qbaa	ok so basically the whole movie was from anna's point of view except for the end. the last like 10 minutes explained what really happened. alex was just her imagination. alex died in the fire along with their mom. anna killed them both but it was an accident. mildred kemp was the one who killed the red head girl and her two brothers. mildred was in the room across from anna in the mental hospital and used to tell her stories. so anna got mildred's stories and real life confused. she though rachel was mildred and that rachel killed her mom so she killed rachel because she didn't like her and because she thought that rachel killed her mom. but she didn't. anna also killed her boyfriend because he knew that she killed her sister and mom|`|73380f4f046c754e124ea1369d29812faa	HAHAHA I HAD THE SAME QUESTION! okay go search in what happened at the end of the uninvited. i got 5 really good answers. ITS STILL SO CONFUSING. HOLY CRAP. I still dont get whether or not any of it was real. And why she killed that one guy.|`|8Z1KkIWcaa	well the girl's name was Anna and she was just imaging all the things she did and said to her sister Alex. The stepmother actually was not evil she just changed her name because she had an abusive ex boyfriend. Then in the end she realizes she killed her sister and her mother in the fire after she was trying to set her dad and Rachel on fire after she caught them having sex. Then in the end she realizes her inmate was the meldrid kemp killer.

se6I1xFhaa	I really don't know if I was that impressed with Clint's acting, although I did like how he wasn't too impressed with his children, who seemed to want his stuff when he died. Clint just seemed very bitter, though he opened up about a third into the film. I've seen better movies where Clint's acting was better.     As for the teenagers in the movie, their acting were okay. Nothing about being great, but pretty good.     I did enjoy how time had changed the overall face of the neighborhood that Clint was living in, going from nice and pleasant to what it was during the course of the movie. All the other houses and lawns looked grey and dreary while Clint's house was bright and his lawn was nice and green.

You'll get tired of it, if you have any self worth    Bottom line u can't do nething, she needs to come to the relationship ready... it sounds like both of you need more dating/life experience.    If you want to stay w her, then make sure YOU lighten up a bit and try not to take things too seriously. Don't let het drag you down. You are doing MORE than enough. As long as you respect her, don't cheat, and love her totally- then be happy! Her jealously is her fault. Don't make her jealous (if you are). Communicate what you just told us. She sounds like she may manipulate you and take the opportunity yo slyly make you feel gulty for her unhappiness. I don't like your gf, she sounds bad.  She projects her insecurities on you to control you.|`|d69856882943ee44ddbbe3cb4e643f2aaa	Hi there, I am a wise Snake =)...at your service. A Cancer Snake who is a born psychologist, so I hope I will be of some help.    Okay, nobody's perfect, right? But, their imperfections have to matter less to you than their good qualities for you to feel good around them. That's just the way it works. Another thing, people never change...learn that. They may change in status, they may change jobs, they may change husbands..but they, their personality, their way of walking and talking, and the things they talk about....never change. (Well, unless they do some serious belief altering therapy, like thinkrightnow.com) Get used to it! or get out!! This is the best advice I can give you. You are a scorpio, a fixed sign, so you will hold on till there is nothing left to hold on to. I know this is hard, because you feel that you are in love here. But, you know what, it's like they say, if something belonged to you in the first place, then it will come back to you if you let it go. So, my advice is, that to see if you really love this girl as much as you say you do, go out and find somebody new, be away from her awhile and be with yourself instead. I think you will find that I was right, that you deserved better than this girl, and that you actually feel way better withOut her!!    To me it sounds like she is the one with the problem. And you need to get away from her because she is lowering your self-esteem. She is very suspicious, questioning, she doesn't trust you and she doesn't even know you, it sounds like. What you have here is not a real relationship, so don't treat like one. Without trust there is Nothing. No relationship, no friendship. Trust is where you must start always. If you can't get her to trust you, she obviously has a problem..especially since you haven't done anything to cause that mistrust. Like I said before, you can't "make" her do anything, ok? Please give up now. Don't waste any more time and grief on this lost case..
5EtiRi2yaa	GIRL ARE YOU SERIOUS. GO TO THE STORE AND BUY UNDERWORLD 1 AND 2 RIGHT NOW. I MEAN IT. LOL    That movie was so good I've seen it three times and going again. Okay you gotta watch the first two to get it. Okay so the ending is basically the intro to the first movie. That was "Selene" on the balcony. Kraven who's not in the movie (don't know why) is the voice at the end. He's in part 1, again you gotta watch part one. No okay so Selene is the girl that's at the end and she looks like Sonya!!!! Which my mouth dropped that was EXCELLENT b/c before you just thought of her as headstrong girl that was the only connection b/w Sonya and Selene. Oh and I guess their names both start with an "S".      No the green broach on the girl is the key that unlocks the werewolf. Okay so in this movie they talked of how the werewolves are savage and crazy, so the beginning the father werewolf is locked up.     If you wanna read it on wikipedia (Underworld then Underworld Revolution) you can but it seriously is a movie to BUY I really don't wanna spoil it for you b/c it's just that good!!!!    This is a prequel sorta like how Star Wars 1, 2, and 3, came after 4, 5, and 6. So this movie you just saw is like Star Wars 1 (Phantom Menace).    Get the comic book to b/c there's a rad story about the black werewolf Raze and how he came into being which was an alternate story (they changed it I guess so he could be in the movie, well they changed a lot of origin stuff Lucien wasn't the first baby that was sane and besides what about the full moon changing them. so.. anyway go see it for real GREAT MOVIES)    what's snoo snoo?????|`|Hrgp1oC5aa	That was the begining of Underworld....which is the 1st film. What you saw, Rise of the Lycans, was the 3rd film. That woman at the end was a vampire 600 years in the future named Selene (played by Kate Beckinsale) The story goes that Viktor saw Selene and turned her because she looked like his daughter.     Seriously.......go rent the other 2 films and Lycans will make more sense.       Here are the trailers for the first 2 Underworld films:     Underworld   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y87cQT4bd...     Underworld: Evolution  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpsHLXk5G...       Those films are great and you'll enjoy them.
AA10297143	Those given are correct, but obviously not the one you are looking for.  Is it with Clint Eastwood or Kevin Costner?  They have similar movies of this variety.  Do a search of actors if you can't remember the title.|`|45Db0MJGaa	I believe this is the Wesley Snipes/Diane Lane movie "Murder At 1600"  At the end of the movie Diane jumps in front of the president when the vice president tries to shoot him.   I thought it was great because she managed to jump in front of him at   an angle with her hands handcuffed behind her back.  Hope this helps!|`|VfEZoklPaa	Vantage Point|`|a02eaadfb74755b7d5fcdf53ef164046aa	Vantage Point   and it was a male agent.

nl0FdEEfaa	Well Im not sure, I own an Epiphone SG, and its  sweet Guitar, Plays almost anything I want it to.    But the bands that you choose. Ac/Dc tends to use an SG, because teh SG has that Deeper, Meaner tone, while the Les paul, has that deeper, sexy , bluesy tone.    Also Jimi Hendrix Used a Strat which had Pickups, and teh Guitars you just choose both have Humbuckers, so when you try to play Jimi Hendrix The tone migth or will be a little different.    So I guess You should go for any of the two guitars. Though since I already own, an SG(Its very good), i would love to get a Les Paul, and that Les Paul you choose is fantastic, and the finish is way better that the SG's.    Therefore I would go for the Les Paul.|`|oyv6JMgOaa	i personally would save up for a real les paul and teh SG type thing would be cool cuz you could pretend to be angus :p

qThmcR1Aaa	Back when Genesis was still a five-piece band, everybody played seated, except for Peter Gabriel, who wandered around the stage in ridiculous costumes and masks, dramatically playing out the parts in his songs. The music was intense and note-perfect, but Gabriel gave the audience some excitement with his onstage theatrics.<br>  <br>  So it's possible to have both.<br>  <br>  Me? If I had to pick, I'd rather have the guys sitting on stage and playing, rather than mucking up the music. I'm there to hear music, not to watch people flail around onstage.|`|kP0JGI1waa	i would have to go with the tidier performance for most bands.  i mean it would be sweet to see them playing the songs perfectly and also improvising to make it interesting.<br>  <br>  however, if its like a punk band or something then I would rather see the energy.<br>  <br>  its really the balance that makes a great concert, being fun and clean at the same time.|`|vidiDXxBaa	I'd rather see the band go crazy. If I want to listen to the songs played perfectly I'll listen to the studio version. Perhaps being 'sloppy' can add a good effect to the song making it different from the original version.|`|dyV9MPhDaa	My favorite band is the Doors.<br>  I regret my age never allowed me to see them live...the riots, the stage jumping, the general disorderly conduct of Jim Morrison.<br>  I would say 'let all he// break loose'.<br>  You want the studio music? Buy the album.|`|S2ByqJSmaa	The sloppy band. I judge concerts by how connected I feel to the music. Interaction helps me feel like I'm part of the music.|`|SMVsmzi4aa	go crazy!|`|ObeBvtzgaa	If it was one or the other, the first one. The best would probably be a good balance of both though.|`|AA12301664	one of the best gigs i ever went to was to see spacemen 3.<br>  <br>  they sat down. we sat down - nay, lay down.<br>  bliss.|`|pbw7chpyaa	Can I take option a without the props?  I like to see a band go crazy, do more of a live jam rather than playing the studio album in its entirety, but prop bands often seem to be faking their spontaneity.  I'd rather see a low key, technically perfect band  grooving, then see some costume wearing band faking their way through their umpteenth "wild " show.  "whoa, we're rock rebels, helllooo omaha, let's see some ****, ROCK On!"   It's like watching a 40 year old stripper faking her four thousandth orgasm on stage.<br>  <br>  <br>  Give me something real everyday.|`|VJAYmZQIaa	I usually like to see a band be energetic and show passion in what they're playing. I also think though that being more mellow can fit with the music. Not looking bored because that would be a turn off, if they're not enjoying the music why should i? I mean just not moving a lot. once saw a reggae band try to be real energetic on stage and it didn't work with the music they were playing, it was kinda disconcerting.|`|WtC6A9xYaa	i think it depends on what is being played. the type of music. like david gilmour from pink floyd doesn't move at all but his shows have great laser lights and his playing is so good that he doesn't need to jump around. and if the song is a slow song then they can't jump around but if the song is full of energy then if they want to then go ahead and jump around.|`|2FIbamFgaa	The first one definitely. I don't go to concerts to just hear the music lol, that's just a bonus. If I wanted the second one I'd stay home and listen to a record. What makes concerts fun is the energy.|`|PgbLkC9Qaa	The first one definitely, because when you're having fun, then it doesn't matter how it sounds (there are exceptions), everyone's jumping around singing along anyways.|`|AA10509738	I prefer a band jumping around interacting while playing precise  just like the recording.( See The Red Hot Chilli Peppers)|`|kC3VwbfRaa	rock concerts are for having fun, right? it`s not like going out to see ballet :)|`|wTkvkWscaa	I could definitely enjoy both. I think it very much depends on the band playing.|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	Stage presence really doesn't matter to me that much these days. Back when I was much younger a high energy crazy stage presence was important. But now I go for the Music if I go to a show. <br>  <br>  With Slipknot it doesn't matter either way you get crazy stage presence and terrible sounding muddy music. but even if they all stood in place you still have Chris and Shawn doing that annoying Banging on Tin Cans.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	Go crazy and play the song right. I don't like bands that sit there and do nothing I could watch an unplugged show of them on tv if I wanted to see them just sit there.|`|NQ37mnWkaa	I'd want a mix of both :)<br>  <br>  Also, it depends on the style of the music. <br>  I have a great live album by the band Lúnasa, which was recorded with them sitting in a castle with a small audience, but you wouldn't know it was live from the sound of it. What I mean is, some bands, like Folk bands, are more suited to that understated style. <br>  <br>  <br>  But if it were *my* band, we'd be playing almost precise {always room for a little sloppy!}, but also bouncing about having a lot of fun. Basically, mixing and matching the best elements of the two...|`|OTFzJbaMaa	i would actually prefer something like the mtv unplugged alice in chains session. <br>  layne, jerry and the band were just sitting on stools with their insturments with candles surrounding them and i really like that kinda thing. <br>  of course if i were going to a metallica concert id expect something a little more out going but for grunge id really like that kind of a set up. <br>  <br>  id never go to a marylin manson concert though that would just be chaotic and woudlnt flow in well with my panic disorder|`|aKBqMLuhaa	I'd prefer something in between.<br>  And a lot of it would have to do with where I was at the concert. If i was in the back and they weren't playing well I'd be let down. But If I were up in the front where the action was I might not care so much.<br>  I never want it to sound like the studio stuff, I like improvisation.|`|ucQxe2e4aa	sloppy 4 life! energy > precise

I was watchin' TV, and a 10 y/o girl was doing a science project. She went to several restaurants/pubs and took a ice sample and a toilet water sample. This'll blow you away ... in several instances, the toilet water contained less bacteria than the ice cube machines. *gags*     Apparently, numerous businesses don't clean their ice machines like they should, and bacteria is dangerously high in the machines. :(|`|kTc3bfrRaa	where do you think that water goes  after you flush??..<br>  <br>    back into your sink faucett!!..<br>  <br>  <br>  but  with   a little  more  toilet  paper shreds...floride..and   tiny  poopoo bits!!<br>  <br>  <br>    Wanna  a   BIG   GLASS of  water??..<br>  <br>  <br>  *smile*|`|uqMK3rUZaa	Certainly not me! :o)|`|wfMF0pbKaa	H3LL noooo!

tLI94qWNaa	"Thirteen"    Here is a photo of the movie cover on the left   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328538/plot...      At the edge of adolescence, Tracy is a smart straight-A student--if not a little naive (it seems...she smokes and she cuts to alleviate the emotional pain she suffers from having a broken home and hating her mom's boyfriend, Brady.) When she befriends Evie, the most popular and beautiful girl in school, Evie leads Tracy down a path of sex, drugs and petty crime (like stealing money from purses and from stores). As Tracy transforms herself and her identity, her world becomes a boiling, emotional cauldron fueled by new tensions between her and her mother--as well as, teachers and old friends.|`|VgE6HSdtaa	Sounds like a porno|`|FF9mMlgKaa	thirteen|`|X45rxI7gaa	Sounds like dumb Thirteen, something for aroused perverts
AA10197672	Scorpio is the best lover because they put everything they have in to pleasing you. They are not so much about being pleased, its all about you. They are v ery passionate, sexy. During your relationship they will learn about you, what you like, what you dislike. What turns you on, and most importantly how to pelase you. Once learned, consider yourself the luckiest guy alive cause they will pretty much do anything for the  one they truly love...|`|0HGqGJYTaa	Maybe you aren't compatible with Aries or Leo, because they are both highly romantic signs. If an Aries loves you, they will put you on a pedestal...especially the men. They are capable of putting their lovers first and best as long as they are treated as such. Leo, rules the 5th house of romance. They've very generous, but yes, both signs do need their egos stroked. Both tend to be passionate.<br>  <br>  All the signs can...Virgos give good love. As the sign of service, they are very considerate partners. I'm a Libra, we rule the house of partnerships/marriage, we give good love too.|`|CcgDj9GIaa	Scorpios and Taurus are the best.  They tend to give their hearts in their relationship and definitely please in the bedroom as well.  They always yearn to share their lives with someone who is willing to put as much dedication into their relationship as possible.<br>  <br>  The worst?  By experience I must go with Gemini's and Leo's.  Love is not their foretay, just having fun and making friends is all they care about.|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	It will depend on the synastry between the two people. Every person has a different "right fit", astrology-wise.<br>  <br>  <br>  I personally haven't slept with a good enough "sample" to give you my opinion on EVERY star sign. Sorry. I'm not that kind of girl.|`|QkQjvPzsaa	Haha<br>  <br>  If thats true, im amazing then<br>  <br>  haha but i don't belive any of this crap<br>  <br>  a sign isn't going to make a person act different, there personality and there parents are the major effect|`|bK5UeKQhaa	Hahaha. Aries and Leo suck?!  I'm a Leo and I have never had a SINGLE complaint about my bedroom 'abilities', in fact it's quite the opposite! Besides, I am extremely faithful and devoted to my partner and I love to be creative, etc, and I always have new sexy lingerie. I also used to date another Leo and he was AMAZING in bed. Had such a chiseled body and always lasted long. He was't happy unless my head was spinning...he got off on getting ME off...and boy could he ever! Anyway, I've never dated an Aries, but my BFF is an Aries and I expect she's good in bed, from the things we talk about. Anyway, it's compatibility. One person might think one sign's style/aura is HOT, while a person of another sign would consider it boring.|`|EriQuRApaa	it really depends. <br>  <br>  i'm a taurus and have no luck at finding emotionally available people. i continuously go for capricorns and virgos. <br>  <br>  it really depends on more than just a sun sign. i know an aries that's a huge cheater and only thinks of herself. while i know another aries that wears his heart on his sleeve and loves deeply. <br>  <br>  i know a leo that doesn't give a crap about love. and i know another leo that put down her ego for the one she adores.<br>  <br>  for me i think the best would be a cancer with taurus rising. who knows.|`|QZzQdh43aa	i agree with scorpio and pisces, and add taurus in their too. their outlook on love is very strong, and will put their all into someone they love.<br>  aries and leo being the worst...umm, i don't completely agree with. i think geminis and aquarius people would be the worst since love is their last priority, they'd rather have their significant other be their best friend rather than be considered in love|`|PGSpIOPDaa	That is so not true! Leos and Aries are not the worst. Actually Leos are very caring and love deeply and so does Aries. I believe every sign makes a good lover but if I had to choose one I'd choose LEO.|`|AA11195715	im datin a taurus nd dr da greastes lovers, nd im an aries nd i dnt think whr da worst lovers i mean we r if wr not attracted 2 r partners but once we find dat special one wr da best..haha|`|kAJdAbKXaa	Cancers & Scorpio the best lovers...<br>  <br>  idk abt the worst ones..leos maybe?|`|PCAlAoDsaa	best lover - Aquarius men and Scorpio<br>  wort lover - Aries

At least that's what you think, and you have all the right in the world to think that. Even if Karma is made up, which I don't think so, it's another way to stop you from doing mean, bad things, which is a very good thing. If one insists on fighting that feeling, to do good, then one ought to stop belittling other beliefs, or maybe questioning them, just to do what they want. <br>  P.S.

Because many girls find Zac Efron attractive. Because many people get super caught up in the silly teen drama movies, and parents didn't mind them getting into this one because it makes adolescence seem very chaste.

RKLFYS2Naa	Well mam...<br>  You see Superman wants to give the appearance that his dick is larger than others, so by wearing the underwear on the outside, it is hugging the penis extremely tight and giving the illusion that the balls are GINORMOUS, and when he gets a little hard on from seeing wonder woman, then the outline of the penis is more prominent.  <br>  <br>  By wearing the underwear on the outside it is also hugging his firm buttocks...<br>  <br>  Super man is o' sooo sexy in those tighty reddies underwear....|`|XWZoXDmgaa	Maybe he's not, along with everyone else in SUPERMAN.|`|hGVkInSnaa	Because he wanted to start a trend.|`|WeJBlyqsaa	I guess we should all continue to watch Smallville and find out why lol|`|AA11110732	Modesty.|`|dCbIHBpGaa	cos he is smart enough to save on underwear laundry bills!

You need your little behind whipped, cause you shouldn't even be asking questions like this. You should still be playing with Barbies instead of worrying about getting pregnant!|`|HYTmfxbYaa	no dont do it for the wrong reason. if you feel like you love someone and you think you will be with them then you can hold it off. you dont wanna look back knowing you did it just because you wanted to before you can get pregnant. just wait trust me. its not something you should do for fun or to prove something. you should do it to prove to that person you love them. so dont do it yet. dont plan it. if it happens it happens dont plan to do it until youre ready. and youre obviously not if youre questioning it|`|C61HWHKeaa	NO, if you have sex before you hit puberty it is more likley you will get a serious disease. it is also very likely that it will make it so you can never have kids. just ask your mum. she'll tell you.|`|NDbI6Gxeaa	well yeah<br>  depends on where our morals stand.<br>  like religion family. but they will still imply after puberty soo<br>  yeah i supose.|`|8clG1K3Xaa	um, it depends on age.

Not only does he have the sexiest smile, dazzling eyes, great bone structure, lovely tall lean physique, and a soothing mesmerizing voice, he also so has a great personality and extraordinary talents to match his good looks. He's a very sweet and modest guy. He can also sing, play guitar, piano and act. He's a beauty, not a gargoyle. :)|`|ff3689a5b50d6a1e23242ba497c37d3baa	I think he is very hot.

But I don't think he is  He looks great in Twilight, but I think the character Edward Cullen is what all the fans have fallen in love with. Robert wears a lot of makeup and has different eyes in the movie, and so fans fall in love with this character, its not Robert in the film but Edward.  But Robert Pattinson as his own person, is very hot!|`|ooyYAiN0aa	ehhh he's okay|`|UmAM1cW8aa	of course he issss ahhhhh|`|7HBTvg8Caa	I think he's absolutely gorgeous as Edward, as Robert he's even better.

3apZeBKJaa	It doesn't sound like you are doing anything wrong. I believe there are some compatibility problems with certain routers/settings and the PS3. For example, the PS3 can only connect to my netgear router when the security is WEP. It will not connect when I have tried WPA. So, I would suggest turning off security on your router and checking to see if you can connect your PS3 to it with no security just to make sure things are working first.
