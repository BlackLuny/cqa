20090226095723AAkMtGS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Is there such a thing as a ceiling fan with 'softer blades'?	My husband wants to move our 5.5 year old to the top bunk. There is a ceiling fan in the room. You can reach it from the bunk, if you are leaning and TRYING to reach it. Well, I know my boy and I know no matter what I tell him, he is going to try to do something with this fan. I don't want him to get hurt, so is there such a thing as a ceiling fan with softer blades? Like a firm foam or something?
20090226095815AAcahTA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	How to take/use provera and clomid.....?	So my wife's Doc gave her an Rx for Provera and Clomid.  She(doc) also drew out instructions for my wife on how to take them.      We thought the instructions said take provera, then on day 5 begin clomid. So, she was essentially taking them together.  But she just began to menstruate yesterday....   Were we supposed to wait until after her menstruation to take the clomid?      Anyone know of the instructions?  Should we wait another month to take another round of clomid, or just begin again with the clomid when she stops menstruating?

20090226095858AA4faLS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	How did you motivate your child to care about personal hygiene?	I asked this question earlier, and after a few responses, realized I hadn't asked the RIGHT question.        I have a 10 year old.  She is lovely and bright, creative and funny.  But she is at the age where personal hygiene should be important and I am so frustrated because she seems to lack awareness of her own body!        Does this sound familiar to anybody:  I am having (practically) the same argument with her almost daily; I tell her to get ready for bed, followed by "Brush your hair, teeth, put on clean pjs, " 5 mins later she is in pjs so I ask her if she has done those things and she answers in the affirmative though its obvious she hasn't.   And its not just brushing her teeth--its everything!  Getting dressed is the same:  "those dont match...didnt you wear those yesterday...wear a bra...did you put on deodorant..brush your hair, tuck in your pocket, zip your pants, did you brush your teeth?"  She tells me I'm mean (or some variant), I tell her she needs to listen (etc).. both end up frustrated,  late,  and the car ride is silent and brooding; a good day already darkened.   If this is something you've experienced, and you've both come out (alive) and onto the next thing, then I need your help.      I know I'm the parent, and that this is a phase/stage, but I'm sick to death of not getting anywhere.  I feel ineffective and at a loss and would appreciate your ideas and recommendations.  What worked for you not only to raise your children's self-awareness but to also to get out of the rut we're in.       Someone suggested that I use consequences as a way to deal with this (30 mins of tv taken away for each time we have this argument, for example).  Did that work for you?

Hi Ladies - well I went to the doctor to have my ultrasound done to see what was going on in there. I am 5 weeks 3 days along. He said the light brown spotting is normal...he actually said 1 out of 3 pregnancies women experience light spotting. I didn't know that! I am still a little nervous. My HCG level on the 18th was 157, then on the 23rd it was over 938!!!! My Progesterone level went from 13.68 on the 18th to over 23 on the 23rd. He had me get more blood taken to see where my levels are at now. I am tying to relax as much as possible and stay calm. If I find out that my levels are still increasing tomorrow, I will feel much better. What do you ladies think? Do you think that even though I am having light spotting of brown icky stuff, because my numbers are so well things will be okay?       Just need some reassurance from my ladies! Thanks so much for everything and I hope everyone is feeling great!!!

20090226101434AAJzwpI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	16 Month Old Not Pointing....?	My son turned 16 months old yesterday and a friend of mine got me totally freaked out about my son not pointing yet.  He has always been on the late end of normal with the major milestones.  He understands simple commands like, Go get your puppy, want some juice, etc.  He snuggles and loves music.  He loves to be read to...he will hand me books all day long.  He dances, plays games with me, loves to race his cars around.  he just recently learned how to stack 2 blocks.  He knows where his head it.  He can clap. He does not talk much yet and he does not point.  HOWEVER--he does follow if I point to something.  I posted a question a few hours ago asking if he was on task and while most parents answered---sounds great---one parent responded that it was a major issue that he has not learned to point yet.  I'm an educator so I am familiar with autism.  I know my son is not autistic.  He is extremely social and smiles all the time.  Is it really THAT huge that he doesn't point???  He will pull my hand to stuff he wants.  Isn't that enough for now?

She will not go an entire night sleeping in her own room. I am at my wits end and don't know what to do.      Here's the thing.. when we were living at their grandparent's house which is a huge mansion of a house, each of our daughters had their own room. Lila had her own nursery..  Cali, my three yr old, had her own room and slept in a queen sized bed..  the tv was kept on as a nightlight, and she slept the whole night through. We moved about 30 mins away closer to work in a 3 bdrm condo, and now she wakes up around 2 am every morning, crying and comes in bed with us.      Her waking up crying, wakes up her sister who is just 1 and sleeps in a crib in the same room as her. Then it's hell..  It's 3 am and I'm trying to put my 1 yr old back to sleep all the while, trying to calm down my 2 yr old and put her back to sleep.       Do you think its just the fact that she doesn't like her toddler bed and maybe got used to the queen sized bed at my inlaws?       She is 100 % potty trained, and sometimes will wake up in the middle of the night to go potty, not crying or anything, but then when we put her back to bed, she starts to freak out since we wont let her sleep with us. This is a nightly occurrence..  Every night, it ends up being, me, my husband, my 2 yr old and my 1 yr old in bed..  I can't do it anymore!!  lol.      So, any advice??       My 1 yr old, Lila, will sleep through the night in her crib if Cali isn't in there to scream and cry in the middle of the night and wake her up.

20090226103007AAaLkiP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	All TTC women, please help!  Is  it this frustrating for everyone?	Okay, my husband is 41 and I am 28. He had a microvasectomy reversal done in june. He had a semen analysis done at three months and the doctor said it could take anywhere from 3 months to a year and a half for sperm counts to return to normal.  I have been checked by my gyno and she said I'm ready to go, my AF has a long cycle but I ovulate.       My question is, are any of you in a similar situation, or have you been and been able to concieve?  Every month is agonizing, I think I have pregnancy signs then take a HPT and its a BFN.  Is there hope for me? I don't have any children and don't know what it feels like to be pregnant, and I overanalyze the tiniest symptoms, therefore stressing out and delaying my AF.  Am I crazy or does this happen to everyone TTC?

My plan was to take it away at 6 months, but my daughter ended up having emergency surgery..and that paci was her only comfort for awhile. However, over a year later...we are still fighting it. I tried taking it away (moms advice) and letting her just cry herself to sleep...but she cried for 4 hours in the night until she was sick from screaming so much. She wants it in the car, on the couch, bedtime...etc. AND, just recently in the past week, she's wanted when she's playing-I think she's becoming more attached and it sickens me thinking about it. I've tried dipping it in vinegar, she loved it. Cutting the nipple off-didn't bother her. We tried "throwing it away" together one time..hoping she'd realize it was gone. Went to the trash can before bedtime to fish it out! I'm lost nad need some answers....

20090226124007AAESmXE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Debates about whether babies over 6 months "need" a night feed?	My friend was astonished the other day when I told her I still breastfeed my 7mo old son during the night - she said "you do realise nutritionally a baby over 6 months doesn't need a night feed don't you?"      I answered her saying its usually his best feed of the day because its dark and quiet and he'll focus on that half asleep and go back down.      Last night however, I fed my son at about 3am and when he woke up he refused his morning breastfeed - I can only assume because he wasn't hungry yet. He didn't take it for a good couple of hours.      Now whilst I don't agree with what my friend said to me, is it possible that my son no longer needs that feed since he wasn't hungry on waking today?

Now, I know it's better than suffering the full pain of labor and delivery and I know it's the way to go for me, but I am afraid of it.        I hear the local feels like a really bad bee sting (or so said a much to detailed nurse in the parenting prep class we went to - that helped calm me down, let me tell you) and that after that you feel pressure and it's cold.        But I am still scared.  I've never even had stitches and now I am going to have this baby.  Can experienced gals help me relax about this?  I don't have to worry about the anesthesiologist hurting my spine do I?  So nervous!
20090226124038AAQ4hEu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Scared about the episiotomy...?	I am 32 wks preg with my first.  How bad is it truly?  Better to tear or be cut?  I know I will be numb during it, but what about after?  Do they give you plenty of meds to help it not hurt so much and do the sitz baths, sitting on pillows, and dry heat lamps really help that much?        I have been agonizing over this and am pretty sure my MD is going to cut me even though I really don't want her to.  She said it is almost guaranteed to be needed during a 1st delivery.  So, can ladies with experience please help calm a nervous mom to be????
20090226131919AA8r0Vt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Sweets from strangers. What would you do?	On the bus today, my daughter (she's 2) was smiling at an elderly man. He must have thought she was cute, because he handed me a little bag of sweets for my daughter.      I thanked him, and said I'd give them to her later after she'd had her dinner at home.      When we got home I put them in the bin. I feel bad.       He was probably just a sweet old man, who had some toffees for himself, thought he'd be nice and give them to my daughter, and I threw them away.      I feel bad for being so untrusting, but I think I did the right thing.      What would you have done? Do you think I did the right thing?

Went to the doctor today to get blood work done to be 100% sure.  I figure I'm probably just like 3 weeks or so.   My coworker is already telling me to be careful with lifting things and to not stress out too much and try to relax.   I have been more tired than normal and I haven't had an appetite at all, a little nauseous.      How careful do I really need to be right now when it comes to doing things?  My little cousins birthday party is this weekend, roller skating and I really want to skate, but now I'm scared to do anything!      I think I'm probably just overreacting, but from what they've said they make it sound like I shouldn't be doing anything right now!

Hi there,      I'm genuinely curious if there's any mothers out there who put on a fair amount of weight in pregnancy and got stretch marks on their stomachs. Is it possible that I might have a waist line that doesn't sag once I lose all the weight from the pregnancy?

Hi...i'm 27 yrs old (28 this yr) and my husband and i have been trying to vonceive for over 7yrs,o   1x my step-mom took me to this doctor in sonora mexico (since she lives in rio rico,said it would be cheaper)and he said everything was ok my ovaries and uterus were normal size and that we just had to keep on trying.I've always had an irregular period since i first go it,then it was normal from 2003 to the end of 2008 and since oct. or nov. i just started spotting and that's it no normal bleeding anymore.Ihaven't seen a doctor here in the us because we don't have insurance, and can't afford one and since we live in las vegas (nv)there's not so much help like in other states e.g. CA where they help you with everything....i've always said "let time pass by" and wait but idk what to do....sometimes i have these symptoms like:craving on food,dizyness,pain on my lower back,headaches,lazyness but not breast soarness though...and i want to think i might be pregnant but then again i just ignore it...and nothing happens any tips on what to do? or any recommendations will be very welcomed...thanks in advanced!
20090226123436AAx4WCf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	For BF Moms: After giving birth, how many days straight did you bleed?	I just had my first baby last tuesday. I didn't bleed much yesterday and none really at all today. I am breastfeeding. And, the nurses said you will bleed on and off for 2-3 weeks and then after that it will be hard to say when I will get a regular period. They also said that the discharge will change colors from red blood to like green, etc. and I have not noticed any changes like that.      Also, after you quit bleeding, how long did it take to get a regular period?
20090226112419AATeL2R	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Do you know any cases of elders having babies?	Just thinking how parenting can affect people differently given their circumstances and how they think. Like a high school kid will feel differently who just had sex with a guy for fun than a girl who was raped and became pregnant that way. I think an elderly person or a person who is in their 50s or late 40s and has a kid will feel a little different about it than a married 25 or 35 year old woman who intends to get pregnant and has a husband she is madly romantically and emotionally attached to. The basketball coach Larry Brown is in his 60s and has kids who are young enough to be his grandchildren and I think when a person is that old and has young children it is kind of interesting for the child in a way (having a birth parent who looks like they could be a grandparent). I just think it affects people differently emotionally pending at what time in their lives they become parents but the common threads are human attachment, affection, & discipline.
20090226133107AAEg8Z5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Stretch Marks....Will they ever go away?	I'm 39 weeks and the last few weeks I just started getting stretch marks.

I also drink a lot of water and NEVER itch my tummy but I ended up still getting them :(    They aren't really bad, light pink to silverish color.

20090226120102AAckg8o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	27 weeks, is it TWINS?!?	I am on my fourth pregnancy and I just turned 27 weeks. I have been having extreme pelvic pressure since about 14 or 15 weeks. It is just getting worse and I have sometimes severe stomach cramps. This never happened in my previous pregnancies. At least not until I was in labor! And that is what it feels like, and just recently I have started having braxton hicks but I cant actually feel the contractions, just my stomach tightening up. In the beginning of my pregnancy I believed that it might be twins but sono determined otherwise but now it still feels like there is 2 babies constantly fighting for room in there. I had a sono at 6 week 6 days and they didnt see but one though. I can also put my hand on top of my pubic hair literally and feel him kick my hand. That is extremely low. Iam also concerned that he might be trying to come early. Something else is that I am only 27 weeks and I have already gained 20 pounds. With my first child I only gaines 17 lbs, and with my other two I only gained 29 lbs. that means that for the next three months I will be gaining a lot more than just 9 lbs to be equal with them. I am not doing anything different. I dont know could this really be TWINS and when they did the first sono at 6 weeks 6 days and they only saw one. Could another baby still have been hiding behind the first one even when it was small?   I dont think I am worried too much about the pain as I am about the fact it might be twins. Twins run in my family a LOT and my husband has twins in his too. At the beginning I really thought that it was twins because I was HUGE and never had that feeling with my previous three. But I blew it off thinking that it was only because I was on the fourth pregnancy. I also lookied it up online and had three out of four symptoms for twins!   HELP PLEASE

20090226131639AAAKyzs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I just had a baby on Dec. 18th and had a very very light first period about a month or so after.?	it lasted one day and was only brown spotting.  Then about 2 weeks later there was a potential conception "accident".  Then almost 2 weeks later out of no where i got heavy brown discharge, i was scared this was implantation bleeding until the next day when the heavy red blood came.  The i was excited because i figured it was my period!! But now its been almost 10 days of bleeding.  Just when i think the bleeding has stopped i'll feel more leak out and its still bright red and not light at all! I'm wondering if i'm having an ealry miscarriage (chemical pregnancy)?? After my first two kids, my first period was completely normal...light as always and lasted only 3 days as always. I've never had long heavy periods.

20090226133204AA3FvZH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	.........can i still be pregnant...?	alright i posted a question about 3 days ago asking the possiblilities of me being pregnant, almost 2 weeks ago (feb. 15) i had unprotected sex with my boyfriend. that friday i had cramps, they were like my period but they didnt last that long .. since than my breast have made changes, they are fuller slightly bigger than normal and the veins are more visable. And im pretty sure my nipples have darkened a little. Besides that, they haven't even been to sore. And i have been a little more tired than i normally am. ALSO, my lower stomach where my uterus is had felt "swelled up" like im bloated and it seems like i can feel my uterus, but anyway ... Yesterday (Feb. 25, two days before i was suppose to start my period) i got what i believe to be my period...i had some cramps but they were nothing major and my lower back hurt a bit, at first it was a light brown and only when i wiped, a little while after that i went to the bathroom again, only this time it was like a dark pink and mixed with a clear mucusy..(?) like discharge. A hour or so ago i went to take a shower, and when i went to the bathroom and wiped it was dark pink...dark red i suppose, and kinda came out, but it was only a little bit and today, it was like normal period blood brightish dark red, but not as heavy as normal but not like drops of blood.. its in between I guess my question is,is it still possible that i could be pregnant even with what i think is my period.. /:      also, if i am .. is it possible that it could be the start of a misscarriage? or would i have extremly bad pains? because i only had slight ones that weren't bad at all.

I know I'm stupid but I want to make sure I'm correct. Me and my. Boyfriend have been together for close to a year. And one night, we were fooling around, and he ejaculated a little, but not on me. He went to the bathroom and cleaned up, and washed his hand with only water. Then about an hour later, he fingered me. I just want to be sure I'm correct that u can be pregnat. A stomach bug use going around and I woke up feeling bad. But I'm sure I'm over exagerating.
20090226134931AAbWRqX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Why is my pregnancy not showing up on a urine test?	hey everyone! I have taken around 7 pregnancy tests all urine and all different kinds. 6 at home and 1 at the doctors. They have all come out neg. I know I'm pregnant and I just want to medical proof. I also know that I'm not imagining this. I haven't had a period since Dec 12th 2008. My breasts are not only tender but I grew a cup size. My boyfriend can't even hug me without me being in pain and I can't sleep on my stomach anymore. My areola is a little darker and I have little bumps around my nipples I have never seen before. My back is in constant pain. I get really dull headaches every other night. I have constipation but when I can go its diarrhoea. (sorry for the tmi). Im pretty much nauseous all the time, but I haven't thrown up. I use to love cigarettes but lately all of a sudden I can't even look at a cig. Also I hate Ice Cream which is really new bc I never in my life would think that about Ice Cream I use to love every kind. And I can't stop eating hot dogs an relish. I know Im prego but I just don't understand why its not showing up. Im not even stressed out. Im ok with it if I am or If im not I just want to know and stop playing to guessing game with my body!

It seems like a lot of moms on here don't think a pediatrician's recommendations hold much weight, and moms who follow their ped's advice are stupid or misinformed. I understand that there are mediocre or even less than pediatricians out there, but there are also very very qualified ones. (Like my son's) I realize that it's important to follow your instinct as a parent, and do research, but if I feel that he's doing the right thing for my son and not going against my instinct, why is it wrong?

Ok so I took my 8 1/2 month old daughter in today for frequent constipation which the doctor was pretty concerned about. So I went out and bought her some glycerin suppositories. We stuck on in a little over an hour ago and on the package it says that it should take about 15 minutes to an hour at eh absolute most. Then it goes on to say that if your child doesn't have a BM that that could be a sign of a serious problem.... Because she is only 8 months old I figured 15 minutes and she would have exploded.      Anyone have any experience with these. Thank you so much for the advice... and yes if she doesn't go in the next hour I am planning on calling her doctor....

It is completely up to u to decide what crossing the line is n only u can decide that its gone in cases like mine. sure the technical definition of a virgin is female that has never been penetrated by a penis but so what! that doesnt cover all the in-between situations like mine that definition is just too black n white if u ask me the reason im going to still claim my virginity is i know that when i look back at my life thats not the moment i know i will remember as losing my virginity i will look back at that as a stoopid horny tennager momment. n just to put it in perspective for the guy i asked him so u really think u took my virginity huh? so if i went off right now n f%@ked sum other dude would u feel like u took it or the other guy did n he completely shut his mouth n apologized. i definitely learned from my mistake n i hope that any gurls who are in a similar situation will too n look at this with hope    ur still a virgin just stop teetering on the edge before u end up losing your virginity FOREVER   there that should get u

Also because we are still trying for a baby when I move in with him this june. So please help. I am very thankful for all the answers I get.      Me and my boyfriend have been together for 2 years... it will be 3 on july 24. We are in a long distance relationship and I will be moving in with him in june. Last saturday he said he was going to a friends house to watch a movie. He said it would only be with guys he works with and would be home around 9-10pm. Well he didn't get home until 2am and to top that off there was a girl he was hanging out with. He is also going to do this again on Saturday. I cried and told him I feel neglected and betrayed. He said he was sorry and that they are only friends but what makes me mad is that he doesn't care about my feelings. He is not willing to make me feel better and he says im being controlling and too jealous.       I love him so much and I just wish he could understand what he is doing to me. I feel so confused and depressed. I didn't go to work today because all I could do was cry and sleep. What would you do? Would you break it off with him?

20090226144354AAYjvML	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Whats the chance of going into early labor?	I'm 31 weeks pregnant-my baby is sitting really low (been told might go into early labor). I havn't felt my baby at or near my ribbs at all- when i get ultra sounds done the doctor has a hard time getting measurments of the head because he's so low- i'm guessing right at my bones down there. He's on his stomach and pushing against my spin and as of right now, his head measurements are right on with what they say how far i am but his body is at least 1 week behind (it was 2 weeks and still could be) Are there any chances I might go into early labor and what should i expect if i do?

20090225115110AAWHQOr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Already Ovulated on the 15th..Positive OPKS for past few days?	Hi everyone      I asked this yesterday but everyone keeps saying I ovulated late.  I definitely ovulated on the 15th of this month CD 14. I did an insemination at home with frozen donor sperm on cd 11 & 12. After ovulation I had a lot of cramping ... to be honest the cramp intensity has varied but its definitely there. I also was sick with nausea and vomitting. I have been experiencing fatugue, back pain, not much nipple sensitivity. I did notice that I am secreting a thick white cervical mucus. (sorry if TMI) It is like a lotiony consistency, but a thick lotion.       I have been anxious to find out what is going on especially because i never suffer from nausea and i took two hpt's both BFN.  I took 2 opk's because i was told that in early pregnancy they might detect sooner then an HPT. The tests i used were FRER Gold Digital and I used a EPT Certainty.  The sensitivity is between 30-50 miU on both. I am using FR OPK's. I tested yesterday and it was positive, i tested today and it was positive, i tested it again just now and it was positive (opks). Since i already ovulated what could this mean? Can you ovulate twice in a month? If thats the case will my period be delayed ?  Again affecting the date i would test... please help me because i am so hungry all the time and tired and anxious..       Baby dust to all... Hope this is my month

Aslong as you make an educated choice based on what you feel is the best thing for your child and your family dynamics then don't let anyone make you feel bad about it.      granted there are mothers who neglect abuse and mistreat their children they are the acceptation and please inform your self and educate yourself on the choices you make so you don't end up causing harm by ignorance .      Please lets lay off parents about the way they raise there children because at the end of the day they are there children and they love them and want the best for that child much more than you do!

20090226102503AAdYpHc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Why do people find the need to ask this question?	Why do people find the need in the pregnancy section to bring up abortion so much?? It's really annoying how much it's discussed. It's the mom's choice,and people need to leave this question alone,or at least put it in another category. Noone wants to think about a baby's death while they're pregnant. I just want to know why people find it necessary to bring up this so much in this section. I don't agree with abortion,at all,but it is the mom's choice. Does anyone else feel this question is really tired,and old,and it gets aggrevating seeing this? Why is it posted so much?

20090226170323AAUwLjQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What's your most recent bad parenting rant?	My mom doesn't drive, so we (my toddler and I) go grocery shopping with her every week.  Today we finished our shopping pretty fast and my little boy was getting restless and trying to climb out of the cart, so we went to wait in the car while my mom finished up.  While waiting for a whole 15-20 minutes, I saw a lady drive up in a little car with a toddler (2-3 years old) standing up on the floor of the passenger seat.  There was no car seat in the car, and no attempt made at all to keep the little girl safe in the car.  As she was driving off the little girl stood up and reached forward to grab something hanging form the rear view mirror.  I also saw a mom put her toddler (between 15-20 months old) in his car seat, but not buckle him up.  Seriously, do these people want their kids to be killed?      What's your bad parenting rant?

I believe I am 5 weeks pregnant (I just went to the doctor today and had a blood test, but haven't gotten the results yet, 3 Positive HPT) I have had cramping in the middle of my abdomen and a lower backache. The cramping isn't too severe but its kind of uncomfortable.  Has anyone had the same thing during their pregnancy? Do think its ectopic pregnancy?      Also, another question...Can a doctor tell by a bloodtest if its an Ectopic pregnancy?
20090226154919AAUNO5T	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My 11 week old daughter won't drink as much as she is meant to, should I worry?	My daughter is 11 weeks old and she is supposed to be having 200mL 5 times a day, but she barely finishes 125mL every 5 hours. Even after 5 hours she is not crying because she is hungry. Should I wait even longer until she cries for it?   I understand some babies just don't drink the recommended amount but isn't half just too little? She used to eat so well and she was eating more than she was supposed to but in the last 3 weeks she has just started refusing her food, sometimes she will just stop and start screaming like she is in pain. In 3 weeks she has not put on any weight but she has not lost any either, she is just the same. Her poos are a bit harder than normal I'm assuming because she is not getting enough fluids. She is having enough wet nappies every day though. My mum suggested starting her on baby cereal but I understand she is too young and I will not do this unless recommended by her doctor who I am seeing on Monday. When I was breastfeeding there was a LOT of trouble getting her to latch on and she just would not eat then either. Do I have anything to worry about? What actions does a doctor normally take when babies are having eating issues?

I'm not looking for a solution because there does not seem to be one other than not replacing it for them and making them pay for a new one when it is something they don't get back.

20090226154925AA2HFsd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Anyone else not able to take pain meds?	This is mostly because a few of my regular followers have been wondering what happened to me. Yes, there is a question in here, once you get past what happened.      Keep in mind during what you're reading that I also have a rather large cyst on my right ovary.      Last Monday night (2/16), I started having severe lower abdominal pains and stomach pains. Later through the night, it was accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting. This lasted all night.We thought it was food poisioning I called the doctor in the morning and they suggested going to the ER because I might be dehydrated and needed to get checked out. I was still in loads of pain. At Triage in the ER they told me anyone over 20 weeks (at the time I was 21w) had to go straight to L&D (Labor and Delivery) to be seen by the doctors there.       I get to L&D and they run all their tests and in the long run the doctor sent me home with what he called SEVERE indigestion.      Ummm... No? I don't think so. Who am I to question a Dr. though, right? Never once checked via sono to see if it was the cyst. So I did as instructed and went home.      The next morning (wed- 2/18) I wake up in even MORE pain, and its all on my lower right side. Just terrible, blinding pain. I wake up my hubby, and his mother-in-law, who is already there and we had to call an ambulance to take me back to the hosptial because at this point, I couldn't walk. I end up at a different (closer) hospital. They give me pain meds (morphine) and its not working, and they run all their tests, including a complete sonogram this time. Hmmmmm. No cyst. (so they say) and before ruling what it is, I get a pelvic exam. Dr. says that she feels no cyst, but does feel what seems to be 'drainage'. She tells me its the cyst, and that in that case the pain will go away on its own after 24/72 hours. She sent me on my way and said to follow up with my OB immediately. Coincidentally for me, my normal OB appt was for that same day. I went ahead and called to see if I could come in earlier and get it over with, seeing how I was in so much pain. They did, and I went. I get up there, and its the SAME doctor who said I only had indigestion *rolls eyes*. I couldnt move, so when it was my turn to be seen, I told him I didn't think I could get up to urinate in the cup as per usual for a visit. I told him what had happened that morning with the ER, so guess what? He sends me BACK to L&D to get my paper work from the other hospital so he can know whats going on. I get down there and guess what else? They READMIT me. I started to fight it because I seen no reason to be admitted. Supposively if you're there, you HAVE to be admitted though to do anything. Ugh. So, there I am stuck there again. They decide to do their OWN sono while I am there, though. Keep in mind.. still in loads of pain which has never went away, and now admitted twice in the same day to two different places. So, the sono is done, and low and behold before my very eyes, the technician finds the cyst, still there and intact. Welp, now we can definantely rule that out.      After seeing its NOT the cyst, I am sent home, AGAIN, and told to call back the next mornnig if the pain persists. So whats causing allllll the pain??       I wake up Thursday morning (2/19) and in even WORSE pain, now accompanied by sharp, jabbing, shooting pains in my right side. Here I go, right back to the hospital. Back to L&D AGAIN. The run even more tests and he then tells me everything in the L&D area of things look normal... they have to admit me to ACTUAL emergency. So, I go and get admitted down there. - This is where everything progresses quickly. I get down there, urine, blood, and an MRI. Several hours later, guess what? Appendix is the issue. Its about to explode. They got me in surgery immediately and got it out. They tried doing it simply with a procedure called larposcopic, but that didnt work, so they had to make another foot long incision in my belly at the waist line to get it out. They staple me shut, and now off to recover. I spent thursday-tuesday (5 days) in the hopstial before I finally got to come home. I have three incision sites, and two drains coming from my belly and abdomen letting some sort of fluid drain out. Its a mess, but the pain is finally coming to an end. - They were never able in the 5 days after to give me any pain meds that would work on me. No Morphine (even though I had a button I could use every 5 minutes), No Vicodin, No Hydrocodone, No Staidol. Nothing worked. Sucks!!      End results as far as my baby goes.. and I am now 22 1/2 weeks along. He is now at a big risk for preterm labor, but the doctor said if I didn't get the surgery, we would have both died anyhow. Lets hope he hangs in there a little longer.      So I am finally home. After this 8 day ordeal, I am finally recovering. Anyone else ever go through similar? Anyone else able to use pain meds and it work? Maybe just some encouraging words/thoughts?
20090226161704AADSNpC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	11 month old with fever for 8 days, and no other symptoms?	My 11 month old daughter has been running a fever for 8 days. It started at 103.       Two days ago, she was down to 99. But the fever went up at night to 101. The same thing happened yesterday. And again today. She was 97.6 all day today. And as night time comes tonight, it is creeping up to 101.       She acts fine - good spirits. Appetite is a bit less, but not bad. A bit more cranky at night, but not bad.      The doctor has checked her ears, chest, throat and glands. All normal. The doctor has tested her blood and urine - all normal. No elevated blood cell count, which indicates that there is no bacterial infection, which means they arent giving her antibiotics. Everyone is assuming it is a virus.      I know that Roseola (baby measles) is a common virus that typically has a fever with no other symptoms - but a Roseola fever typically lasts 4-5 days, 8 days max. We have now surpassed this.      She is also teething (cutting the top two front teeth - one tooth has broken through, but the other one hasnt yet...although we can see that it will be soon. I know that teething fevers tend to be lowgrade. And when this all started, she had high fevers, so I doubt it is teething.      Anyone have this happen this their babies? What could it be?

When I found out I was pregnant I was told by the father that if I kept it he wanted nothing to do with me. The thought of not keeping my baby crossed my mind, but I could never do that. I feel like it was our mistake that got us to the point of a baby and we shouldn't take it out on an innocent child. Needless to say, he was true to his word and moved some chick in with him almost right away and has made no attempt to contact me, along with the fact that he changed his phone number. So I have been handling everything by myself, going to dr appts., paying all my bills and dr. bills and working full time. I have a good job, my own place etc. It's just hard and when I lay in bed at night I cry myself to sleep bc I hope I have made the right choice. What do you think? Any advice? What should I do about him? Please don't be mean, I am trying to own up to my responsibilites and do the right thing.

My partner and I have decided that we wanted to TTC but for the past year we've been using the pull out method (I know we could haven't gotten preggo but haven't)       I've looked at some ovulation calendars online and all of them say differant days so it's really confusing exspecially that my cycle is soo irregular.       My last 3 periods were:::   Feb. 8-12   Jan 27th   Dec. 23rd.      I've been stressed out though for the last couple weeks due to moving and stuff.       My hubby and I had sex Friday (he pulled out) Saturday (came inside me ) sunday (pulled out) and Monday (came inside me) Wednesday (pulled out) and today (pulled out)      He says he's just used to pulling out. I had discharge due to ovulation i hope- on saturday and sunday and thats it, but I only noticed it while having sex. It was thick and white. I recently got tested for std's and all that good stuff, and i'm clean so we're definitely ready to concieve!!    I guess i'd like to know whats the earliest I can have a pregnancy test and should we keep doing the baby dance?    this morning I was kind of crampy so i'm not sure if that has anything to do with anything, i've been taking prenatal vitamins.
20090226171028AAfrsXx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	I need lots of answers please... I think this just might be my month... After 4 years of TTC...?	Here are my symptoms and how I have been feeling the past few days... I need you ladies to tell me what you think... I am really "feeling" preggers! But I havent tested yet because after 4 years of TTC I have got some many BFNs that I dont want to be let down anymore... I should have started either yesterday or today, and I havent yet. I have a very very regular cycle. I am never late! I also had my first round of Clomid this month. I have been having serious hot flashes for about a week now, also for about a week my boobs have been sore (which is normal before my period, but this month it just seems different). I have been moody, sleepy, and sick at my stomach the past few "nights" but I havent actually threw up... I know that if I was preg I would not feel a baby moving in my belly this early, but I have been having twitching feelings in my belly, and I have had, just today, a faint headache on and off... So what do you all think?      And good luck and baby dust to all TTC!
20090226105917AAgpWT7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Need some advice on weight and pregnancy?	I am not pregnant yet but hopefully soon with my second child! My question/situation is this......With my first child I gained 36 pounds. It took maybe 4 to 5 months to lose the baby weight then I have went on to lose and addition 10+ pounds. For some reason it seems I had to lose extra weight to get back to looking the way I did pre-pregnancy....but anyways. I am now 25 years old, around 140 pounds and 5 ft eight inches tall. I really dont want to be as big as I was with the last pregnancy so is it wise to try to maybe lose down to 125 130 before getting pregnant? So that even if I was to gain the 35 pounds that would put me 165. OR would I just gain even more weight if my body had been losing right before pregnancy? I know this is a strange question I just want some advice on what others have experienced. I am in pretty good shape and currently work out around 5 days a week.

20090226165150AAIG6rX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Can twins be undetected at an 8 week u/s? I just can't help but think there's more than one in there!?	So today I am exactly 8 weeks. I went in for a vaginal u/s and I told the tech I had a feeling that there were 2 in there, she said "nope... only one for sure"... but how can she be so sure??? Can they be? I am still not 100% convinced that there's only 1 baby. Is it wishful thinking b/c this is my last pregnancy (4th baby) or is it intuition? I also had a dream the other night about twins. My husband thinks I'm ungrateful for just one baby. But that's not what it is... I just have a feeling. Has this ever happened to anyone before?? Also, when she first did the u/s, the tech asked "do you have a history of fibroids? Do you have bleeding or pain?" So is it possible that a twin can be mistaken for a fibroid (don't laugh) or hiding behind it? Help.... I'm going crazy thinking about this and I won't have another u/s for 4 more weeks.... I am in denial???

20090226165512AAPrnls	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Was this mother neglectful and foolish?	This woman in my office was on maternity leave after having premature twins. She dropped by the office after the twins' doctors appointment and decided to suddenly leave them with us to run an errand....to get her eyebrows arched. She said she would be right back in about 20 minutes and she did. These babies appear healthy but because they were premature, they have to be on electronic breathing monitors for a few months. This woman is married, has a mother, a mother-in-law and has 3 sisters living in town with her who could have easily watched her babies if she asked them.       My question is did this woman practice good judgment? Or does this woman's actions seem NEGLECTFUL AND FOOLISH?

I am currently pregnant with my first child and My mother and her friends want to throw me a shower, but also the God parents of my baby want to throw me a shower. I can't exactly tell either one that I don't want one cause I feel it would be rude. And niether set of people really know the other ones so they don't want to combine the showers. My mother in law and sister in laws have been invited to both showers (although i don't expect two different gifts) What else am I suppose to do? hurt one of the poeple wanting to throw me a shower just becuase Im having a different one? I mean one is going to have my family, and my moms friends at it, and the other will have my husbands family and my friends at it. Almost Two total different crowds (give or take two or three people. and I don't expect more than one gift from those people)

20090226170050AAB8pYB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	It's it possible I'm pregnant?!?!?	I've been on the pill now for a year. Just last week my period came late, and and even then, wasn't nearly as heavy as usual. I used tampons, rather than pads, so I couldn't really tell if it was all that spotty. Then earlier this week I started feeling somewhat sharp pains in my breast, and having to pee quite frequently, but not really urinating a lot once going. Now, it seems my areola is darker, and slightly larger. My nipples are more erect, no matter the temperature, and they are slightly sensitive to my clothing rubbing on them. Am I pregnant??

20090226100618AAbIzQQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Late Period, could she be pregnant?	My wife is just a few days late. Since last week she has been feeling nauseous. So, I took her to the doctor last week for a sore throat and she vomited on the way to the doctor. When we got there I asked her to take a pregnancy test, it was negative. I guess it was too early to tell. Her period is now late. Well, my first question is when the doctor asks for your last cycle date is he counting from the start of your last period (which was 1/20) or the day it went off (which was 1/25). Also, she doesn't think shes pregnant, she says it's probably stress but I just feel like she is. She had her Mirena taken due to complications and has not been on birth control since Dec. We do take protective measures. Ladies what do you think and how soon can she take another pee test.    Also I bought her a generic pregnancy test called "For sure" she told me to get a "First Response" will this make a difference. Thanks

A few days ago I posted a question because I feared I was miscarrying but after talking with friends/family that experienced miscarriages, and researching online, I'm thoroughly confused.      I am pregnant and bleeding. It's not as heavy as a menstrual cycle at all, and I have no cramps. I cramped days before I started bleeding but the cramps have receded. I have no fever, no lack of appetite, no backaches, and no nausea.  I took an at-home E.P.T test Tuesday and it's still showing up positive. I heard if you miscarry it won't show in your urine. I go back to the doctor on Monday to get the result of last Monday's blood work. I have to see the doctor every week until the threat of miscarriage is over or that it is confirmed that I miscarried.       Does anyone have any advice? I'm trying to ease my mind until I can get back to my doctor on Monday. This is my first baby and I'm terrified. It took me a year to get pregnant so I'm extremely paranoid.

Someone mentioned that it's possible to make an appointment at a lab to get the test, without going through your doctor. Is that possible, and how much does it cost? Also how early can the blood test detect pregnancy (I'm about 11 days past ovulation, and 6 days before my period), and how long does it take to get results?

Well, I've been dating my boyfriend for almost two years, and we've talked about sex a lot, but he's never pressured me, and he says whenever I'm ready he'll be ready. I know for sure right now, I'm ready and I've gone threw everything with my mom, we have condoms, and I'm on birth control, so I'm not some dumba*s, also, I'm over the legal age, so don't think about that either. I'm just super concerned with pain, and I really can never handle it.. EVER. So..         1.) How bad does it hurt on a scale from 1-10?? 1 being ehh, not at all. 10 being UNBEARABLE, terrible pain.      2.) What EXACTLY does it feel like during the entering or first thrust?      3.) If I was drunk would it be less painful?      4.) I asked my boyfriend if he could maybe drug me or something, so I wouldn't feel it, he said he doesn't really want to, but would I feel pain then?      I'm so scared of pain, but so ready for sex, I STILL can't put in a tampon because it hurts so bad, so please answer the questions.         I promise promise promise, I'm not a troll, I'm serious, please and thank you.

Here is my story    I have 9 sisters 4 older 4 younger and my twin sister and one more sister on the way. I have to share a room with my twin sister and my 6-year-old sister. I don't care we have a big room. My twin and I are not 13 yet.   We all go to a private Christian school. We all eat lunch together. I allow them to give me makeovers we get board. They done this for 5-6 years. We live out in the country. 45MI NSS from our school. They are nice about putting makeup on me. They make me look good. I wear there clothes. It is not embarrassing to share a room with my sisters. I am going to live at home during college. So are my sisters. We change in front of each other. We are related. They have lots of choices do put on me my    Twin sister has lots of clothes that fit me. They are tying to get   Our parents to buy me my own makeup and girl clothes. I say no because i don't want to be a girl for life.( i think)    My name is a girl name and i am a boy the hospital messed up. So I go by a nick name at school. I like dancing and some other girly stuff. I do have some female features. My voice is soft like a girls. My hair is down to my shoulders. I look like my twin sister. I look like a girl. But i am a boy. I got a full body scan yesterday. I been have some pain. It feels like a girl having her period.    They did some other test today and They found out that I have a    working female reproduction system.    They believe that there me and my sister were going to be triplets but one did not grow and apart of the thing got on me to make me partly a boy. It is hard to explain    When i do get the surgery I have to be a wake. They wont be able to put me to sleep the stuff they use. will make me ill. So they said when i do deiced they will allow my twin to be in    the room with me during it. So she can keep my mind of off the pain.      I already have a girl name. The hospital messed up my name.   My name is amy. But I go by one of my middle names. I have two middle names. I go by one of them which is Jeremiah I have a long name. My last name for example XXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX      So if want to have biolgical kids in the long future. I will have to   be a girl. I have a working female reproduction system. I have female hormones.    After my doctors appointment. My mom and my twin sister and I went and ate at wendy's and talked.    Then after we ate. I went and got my ear's priced. Then my mom and twin sister helped me get girl clothes and makeup. Shoes, makeup. A purse.   Some days i fell like i should be a girl. I already have the girl name so i want have to change it.       I am scared of surgery. But i want to have biolgical kids. If I want    to have kids i need surgery and i know it wont take long. I know i    will have to stay in the hospital no more then a week.    I really don't know if i want to be a girl.    I am going to deiced over the next month.    Any advice to be less scared?      My name for example    Fff mmmmmmmm mmmmmmmm LLLLLLLLLLLLL-LLLLLLLLLLLL         My sister is going to help me over the next month
