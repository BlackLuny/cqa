Would i know if i had ADD, autism , aspergers , OCD or bi-polar?            basically im 31 now, suffered a very hard, tough life, years ago i was diagnose with borderline personality disorder and my psychiatrist accepted i have symptoms of PTSD disorder to.      in the past my symptoms have been : impulsive outbursts of rage in public, difficult controlling aggression and rage ; antisocial anger towards people ; spacing out ( dissociation ) - persecutory paranoia , agoraphobia , intense panic and anxiety feelings when outside , palpitations ; a feeling of feeling abandoned and out of control : always found it difficult to concentrate and absorb information : ( although ive read books and understood them ) : keep having to re read sentences to understand them : mind drifts off whilst reading a page of words.      always had low self esteem, difficulty interacting, forming and maintaining friendships . im very intellectual and are often told im very intelligent, understand things well, talk well , and have a good mind. have a good imagination. can converse very well.      as a kid was quite hyperactive, always running around , but calmed alot into teenage years.      my mind always races every day, racing thoughts, keep forgetting things , my mind feels scattered with thoughts, difficulty trying to organise and structure.   have obsessive worrying thoughts about physical, mental health.      now those are all the symptoms i can think of that ive always experienced.            ive NOT been diagnosed with ADD , aspergers , autism , ocd or bi polar - and my psychiatrist was adamant i dont have those disorders.            iam presently working with the mental health services although the therapy i want is not available ( psychotherapy ) because of lack of resources and funding, i have to accept what theyre offering which is an OT worker to go out into society to help me get integrated because ive been reclusive a long time now..            i want to know from what i described does it sound like i have any of the disorders mentioned ?      is it important if i have them to get them diagnosed and treated ?      if i do have those disorders would i know it ? and would they prevent me from getting on with life like education and career and learning etc ???         my moods fluctuate from being deeply depressed, despairing, abandoned, lonely, to feeling ok again the next hour , then the next hour to feeling ANGRY, ENRAGED , full of anxiety , mind racing constantly . see thinks in BLACK and WHITE etc. unstable impulsive moods...      this is why i agree i have BPD .            but im also worrying do i have those other disorders...?         ive been told i probablly dont have aspergers or bi polar  or autism   or  ocd  which came as a relief recentley.

Seems to me that ever since I was in high school, girls are getting hurt more and more mostly playing sports and ending up in casts. When I was in high school besides my own cast I must have signed 3 or 4 girls' casts every year and I wasn't in a big school. Same thing now that I'm in college - again I had the honor to wear a cast but I see quite a few girls in casts on campus and most of my friends told me that they've worn them too usually for breaks but also for torn ligaments. My mother said that when she was growing up in France the only time girls ever usually broke bones was skiing and she thinks it's because we're playing more and more sports like soccer and being more daring in cheerleading and gymnastics and our bodies can't always take the strain.      Is it my imagination especially because I was just in casts for a long time or are more girls playing hard like the boys and ending up in casts like guys always did?      Oh and if anyone is in a cast and wants me to sign it LOL just tell me whether it's arm or leg and before I close the question I'll send u a message to put it on LOL because I'm nuts (and it is the only good thing about wearing a cast).      Thanks and love, Kari

20090226084741AAaYVh4	Health;Other - Health	I got a BIG shock today? I'm DESPERATE for genuine help....please?!!?	I got a HUGE shock today.          I went to the bin in the kitchen to throw something away, when I suddenly noticed; cigarettes.          This is not new, but my mum used to smoke when I was very little, so of course I don't remember.   She came back from America; to say goodbye to her mother; who was very very ill at the time; and soon passed away. According to my sister, my mum has been smoking ever since then; and that was August 2007. It's now 2009. 1 and 1/2 years........   Even worse, which just is unimaginable to happen; to MY mum; is that her mum, used to smoke, and she died of a lung disease and several other things. I really really don't want this to happen to my mum. She's had cancer before, and pulled through, so it would be heart-breaking if she got it again......         I've never realized until today, and over the past 6 months or so, I've noticed she, the car and the house, sometimes smell of smoke, and I question it. But now I know; I feel really really guilty of persecuting her.   The other thing is; that since the country's in recession, starting to smoke now, is obviously, very bad. I feel powerless.      I've been up in the bathroom crying, and I just can't get over it, it's just to much of a shock....      This is a very eeiry coincidence: This is when I was loading the internet up to go on here to type this question....   I have iGoogle; and one of my things on there is Smiley of the Moment. I always, for some reason, seem to keep the boxes on minimize. And today when I clicked maximise, the smiley was crying……..and I've just been doing that........even weirderer; in my pictures, I have a folder of all these smileys. I save them from my homepage just to like collect them. This is the weird part; I hadn't saved this one before, though I think I have come across it before.      Please, please, please give me some advice, I am in dispair at the moment, and I'm really scared for the future.

20090226084107AAH1v70	Health;Diet & Fitness	I ruined my life because of my job!?!?	Alright.  Well, I work midnights at a high paying office job, but I'm so tired when I get out, so I get fast food, eat it, then go to sleep.  Well, I used to get like a big mac meal, but now I'm so hungry I get three big mac meals.  And this has made me so..Er..Fat.  I used to be about 130 pounds, but now I'm about 290.  And I have no time to workout, because I'm mainly sleeping, and I need my sleep because I am only up about 4 hours before my job.  But my boyfriend brings me chocolates during that time, and other things like cheesecake and little treats.  I asked him to stop, but he brings them and I can not resist.  He's so nice, but what is really odd is that he likes my weight gain.  He never said anything about it, but when he leans to kiss me he likes to grab my stomach and play with it.  I know this sounds really odd...How do I lose weight. and what's up with my boyfriend?
20090226083330AA8lkAr	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Cold Sore - First ever!!! WHY!!?	I'm 25 years old and I have NEVER once in my life had a cold sore. I've never dated anyone who had them (to my knowledge anyway), so I know I've never kissed anyone with a sore.       I'm 99% certain it's a cold sore, it's a little red area on the side of my top lip, and it tingles and burns a little bit.      I felt no warning signs, it just seemed to pop up when I woke up this morning!!!      I have had, over the past few days, the worst cold of my life however. Really bad sinus congestion, coughing stuff up, I had a fever a few days ago. Could this be a factor?      I picked up some Abreva at the store (expensive!!!) and I'm applying it according to package directions. When I put the cream on, the cold sore momentarily reacts and has this cold burn type feeling.      My question essentially is if I've never had one before, and have not directly been exposed to my knowledge, why is this popping up now? Am I a likely candidate to get them all the time now? :(

20090226084719AA2nDu3	Health;Mental Health	Please help, regarding depression (UK)?	About 5 weeks ago I saw my doctor about depression and she has referred me for CBT and I'm waiting for that to get sorted.      At the appointment, my doctor told me to try to get more exercise in the meantime as it releases those chemicals that make you feel good. The trouble is, I know this. The reason I exercise so little nowadays is because I don't have the motivation or energy to get out of the house anymore, which is why I went to ask for help in the first place. Last week I did try really, really hard. I got out walking for half an hour everyday but then, like all the other times I have tried, I lost my will to do it.      I am just confused, because it seems like one of the things you are supposed to do to combat depression is something that depression itself prevents.      Please help, I don't know what to do anymore. People at these centres keep saying they will ring me back but they never do and I am the one having to keep the ball rolling here. For the first four weeks it turned out nobody was doing ANYTHING, my doctor had forgotten to refer me.      Where do I go from here? I just feel so abandoned. Why am I having to wait so long for treatment? It's ruining my life.
20090226083350AAVAr0g	Health;Diet & Fitness	Will a few brisk walks a week do enough?	I'm trying to get fit and lose some weight. I've tried many forms of exercise (mainly workout DVDs, spinning or other keep fit classes), but I usually last a couple of weeks then get really bored and never go back! I know that exercise has to be something I work into my life in the long term if I want to reap the benefits.   What I really do enjoy is walking! And I'm wondering if I start walking on my errands (shopping etc) rather than driving will this help me get fit and lose weight? I've calculated that my supermarket trips would equal about a three mile walk and there's also a lovely park near me which I could do about the same length walk. If I do this a few times a week (three?) would I see results? I know it's not cardio (which has given me great results in the past, if only I could stick at it!), but it's something I might actually be able to sustain.   Any advice? I'd walk briskly and am considering getting a pedometer.

My dad and her have a bad relationship in that she mentally abuses him, so he leaves her house at 10am every morning and does not come back until 8 or 9pm at night, he has his own place a half hours drive away. She is cared for in every practical way, financially, clothes wise, food and has her own independance and car. Her mental illnesses manifests itself in separation anxiety and a 100% lock solid idea in her head idea that my role is to give up my life and my boyfriend (who i live with for 8 years) for her, and she drives this home to me every time i meet her. She doesnt like my boyfriend and has bad mouthed him to people and i cannot bring him home to her house (where i go every 3 weeks and xmas, easter and any other special holidays..i have to be separated from my partner). She has fought and said nasty things to her family (brothers and sisters) and now they all exclude her from family events..so she has no one. She soemtimes turns up at family events and then they ring me and tell me the nasty things she said or done even though i cannot control where she goes. that has lead to me cutting those aunts and uncles out too...as they have never been a support to me only to tell me how nasty she behaves. One aunt rings me up and tells me word for word the nasty things shes said about me and to her and then tells me not to repeat it as shes doesnt want to get ate by her. This leaves me so upset. My dad says i should do more aswell, although i do all i can with her. I've spoken to her doctors and nurses and they say she is just dfficult and wil not change and she is under their care. She tries to control me and people just tell me i'm an adult and to stand up to her wickedness, but i feel shes acting out of desperation and i dont want to upset her more. My dad then also says i'm not to stand up to her and make his life more difficult. He says hes the one dealing with her dailly while i live 60 miles away, so he thinks i should be doing more.

20090226084001AAPzjSY	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	Please help me, i keep hearing this weird noise in my ears.what can be done to stop this?	First let me say my English is not that good you might find many grammatical mistakes.       please help me, i keep hearing this weird noise(like small explosions) in my ears.what can be done to stop this?   .   here is the details of my probelm      i have a problem in my ears that i need some help.i think this problem is created by me.      In year 2006 month of July one day when i was taking my shower and i was washing my hair with shampoo and when i washed my hair after using shampoo some thing got in to my left ear and i felt my left ear is blocked a bit.i was hearing less clearly in that ear.so later i checked a doctor(ENT specialist) he gave some medicine and a few hearing tests .after i took those tests and went to the doctor with the test results he gave some medicine and asked me to take those medicine for a month and after a month not much improved in my left ear  and   i went to him he again gave me some medicine which i took but didn't got any better result so i stopped visiting that doctor.in the mean time  i quite frequently tried to clean my left ear with cotton swab/cotton bud.like a few times every day or so.       After another 4-5 months later in December,2006 i again went to another ENT specialist who after hearing my problem used some kind of suction instrument like sort of special vacuum cleaner for ear and used it in my left ear and this time a small but not soft thing/piece of matter came out and i felt my left ear was clear again.So the doctor gave me some medicine so that no infection occurred in my ear(i am not sure probably)      Now here is the sad part that was initiated by me after my left ear was cleaned by doctor and after a day or two i grew this obsessive/mania( i don't know which one describes it best)      that as my left ear was feeling as fresh as it was before july 2006, i grew this sort of weird feeling/mania/ that my other ear, right ear was getting blocked by earwax.so i started to do the same thing to my right ear which as i remember had no problem as i did to my left ear when it was blocked.and vice-verse so that means once i clean the right ear with cotton swab/cotton bud then i had this mania that nmy other ear is blocked by earwax and i mus clean it so that it won't be blocked again.So i kept doing this stupid thing of cleaning ears even though not much earwax was there in my ears for some time like a few weeks and then this problem stated to begin with both my ears.   I started to hear some weird sound in both my ears .      i am not sure what i can compare this sound to.because it's like coming from inside my ears      this sound is repetitive and are like small explosions that are continuing to happen in my ears continuously all day.i start to hear this sound when i get up from sleep and i can hear this weird sound tilll i fall in sleep.some time i hear this sound in both my ears at same time and some time i hear this sound in either right or left ears (which sound like small explosions going on in my ears).       have meet an ENT specialist who advise me not poke my ear in that mania fashion and gave some hearing tests and all the results that came from those tests are normal so he didn't find any problem with my ears despite i keep hearing this sound and i always feel my ears are somewhat blocked  by earwax.         this sound is repetitive and are like small explosions that are continuing to happen in my ears continuously all day.i start to hear this sound when i get up from sleep and i can hear this weird sound till i fall in sleep.some time i hear this sound in both my ears at same time and some time i hear this sound in either right or left ears (which sound like small explosions going on in my ears).      so any advice that can help to get rid of this weird sound in ears?because i can't seem to prove to the ENT specialist that i keep hearing this weird (small explosions) in both my ears.       I would be grateful to anyone who can advice me what to do to cure this weird ear problem that is annoying me for more that 2 years.       and i am a male and 25 five years old person

20090226082038AA5HT9N	Health;Dental	Can I get dental insurance to cover part of a nightguard?	I grind my teeth pretty bad at night, and since I'm going to be getting two crowns put on teeth I had root canals on, my dentist strongly reccomends I get a nightguard so I don't do further damage to my teeth or to the crowns once they're put in. However, when I got back a coverage quote from my dental insurance (Delta) they won't pay anything for a nightguard ($469!!), because according to them it's not a covered benefit of my program. What I want to know is if there is any way I can get my insurance to cover at least a portion of my nightguard, as I need these crowns because my teeth are chipping due to the root canals, but there's a good chance I'll damage the crowns without a nightguard to keep me from grinding down on them... or is 'not a covered benefit' an absolute thing, no matter what? Also, would it help if I had my dentist call and talk to them?

Yesterday I smacked my pinky toe into a big thing (I don't know what it is exactly lol) and it made me fall over from the pain. The pain didn't go away for about 15 minutes, but it still hurts to walk, flex or touch it. It's bruised with red dots and it's swollen a bit (When comparing with other pinky toe)   So I don't know whether it's just bruised or what.
20090131155337AAXgh4j	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Medical advice on my hand: dry, cracking, bleeding, bumps, etc?	In the past few months, the skin on my hand (specifically my right hand, although it is on my left hand too just a less severe) has been dry and scaly. The skin on my knuckles has been cracking a little and had miniscule bleeding, just like..little drops of blood. I also had a wound on the base of my right thumb that wouldn't heal for about a month (kept re-opening, turned slightly greenish) and have no recollection of getting it and it just now is almost gone. It sort of looks like a burn or a little skin got rubbed off. Today I noticed I had a few small, bumps and places of irritation on top of my hand where it meets the wrist.      I want to go to the doctor but haven't made an appointment yet, does anyone know what this sounds like or have any suggestions. Diabetes runs in my family and a few people suggested that this sounds like some possible symptoms.      Thanks.

I've been sick since Tuesday with what is now just a bad cold, with stomach issues for the first few days. However, recently while I was showering I first noticed just how sensitive I am to smells and how they're really overwhelming and can make me feel sick, despite being really congested and plugged up (e.g. shampoo, body wash, soup).      Then yesterday, I was having this rice that I've had before. And it seemed SO spicy. I couldn't handle it. But I know that it's not spicy...and my boyfriend confirmed that it was not spicy at all.      Is it common to become far more sensitive to smells and spicy food while sick? It's a new experience for me!

Anyway, most resources I find are about symptoms and treatments, but I thought it might help me out to hear real people's stories of what it was like talking to your doctor about it for the first time, particularly people who were diagnosed as adults. What finally made you decide you needed to get help, what was the appointment like, or anything else you experienced

Not like killing anyone, just like feeling negative about myself and my life, as opposed to God who makes me think that life is great and full of love. Do you ever feel like there are two types of people in the world, the ones that are closer to God and angels, and the ones that are closer to the devil and demons? I feel like I'm stuck in the middle and the devil is pulling me one way, but I just want to be good and to be with God.

But ever since having a child, I've wanted to tone up, particularly in the hips, belly, and thighs.  I've decided to try out the P90x program in order to do this.  Anyone have any suggestions?  I've stocked up on fruits, good sources of proteins, and lots of water/gatorade and do have a blender for fruit/yogurt mixes.  I will have to start off slow, as I work full time in a very physical-labor type job and don't want to be too sore to work.  Anything I can do for that little bit of extra tone?  Are there certain common mistakes that people make when trying this program?  And for those of you who have used this program, does it work well?  I have the motivation to use it daily, but don't want to waste my time making silly mistakes the first few months.  Thanks all!

I usually do not eat during the day until dinner time, and if I do this on camp, my teachers will probably make me eat or want to 'talk' to me. I have teachers that do know about this, but not all of them do, and i am not sure If the ones who do know will be on this camp. Like what do I do? I have to eat, and I mostly likely will not be able to throw it up because people will know if i do. Only a few people know about this and I do not want others to know because I feel so ashamed. So please how can I eat without people noticing that I am not eating, or how can I get rid of my food without people hearing me. I HAVE to go on this camp because it is part of the curriculum. Please no lectures.      Thank You.

When it started, I wouldn't be able to fall asleep until 1 or 2 in the morning. Instead, I would listen to music and and think about random things before I would even think about drifting off.   This progressed into what seems to be, minor helucinations of figments or shadows either at night or in a semi-dim room.    As far as the thinking is concerned, I still do it, now even in the daytime whenI'm walking home or something.      Is this a phycological problem?   What problem could it possibly be diagnosed with?      Note:   Other things I experience is:   Occasional heart racing   Awkwardness with conversing with other people (occassionally)   Extream emotional changes (occassional crying when there's no need for it)      I did have a negative childhood if that helps any!      thanks,

It has not ruptured, and she is soon going for the surgery in which they clip it off from the rest of the blood supply.  I'm quite familiar with what an aneurysm is, how they form, what may cause them to rupture, and what can occur if they do rupture, but, I'm concerned about the prognosis following "clipping" surgery?  From what I've read, the aneurysm remains where it is and still may rupture at some point.  Also, once a person has one, more form?  Is that true?

Ok.. so I just need a little advice- maybe you've had the same symptoms?      I started off with a sore throat- it only lasted about 24 hours.. it turned into a cold/headcold, and I thought I was starting to get better about 48 hours after the initial sore throat turned cold. This all started late Monday afternoon/Tuesday morning. Yesterday during the afternoon I noticed my neck was feeling stiff/sore. It feels much better today though. Anyways, now i'm just left with extreme sinus pressure & a sinus headache. My nose isn't all that stuffed up anymore, when I do blow it- it's clear. I do not have a fever. I've tried liquid cold medicine- doesn't work, i've tried Dayquil for head congestion- doesnt work, I've tried Exedrin migrane- doesnt work..  could this be a sinus infection? I figured if it was an infection that when I blow my nose it would be green or yellow and I would be more sick. Can anyone help me?! I could barely get out of bed today because of the sinus headache. Besides the sinus pressure and headache- i'm ok otherwise. No fever as I said, just the sinus headache & tired.    I don't have insurance and reallly dont want to go to the hospital unless need be.

20090131180258AAoTM42	Health;Diet & Fitness	Does keeping your abs flexed for a few mins make your body learn to automatically keep them flexed?	i heard this in an answer to my question that like if you hold your muscle flexed for a few minutes it gets your body to keep the muscle flexed.      "have always wondered this.... I think the point of it though is to get your body to naturally hold your abs tight. I flex my abs about every 30 mins for a good 2 minutes straight just so my body naturally does it and I think it's the same concept. The punching itself does nothing for your abs, it would be the holding your abs tight which helps"         Do your abs still contract more even if you do do this or are they like stuck how they are and dont seem to flex more when you flex them on your own?

I have been a bit down for the past couple of months due to relationship issues...I talked to a therapist (who I often feel is judging me) and a psychiatrist who are rly trying to get me on Zoloft. I went home during Christmas break and saw my doctor, who told me I had anxiety disorder (which I already knew about since age 11--I'm 19 now) and depression (but not lethal, he said). I didn't tell him specifically about the problems I was going thru (a break up), so he didn't know. I just told him I was stressed about school. =/      I don't think I'm rly depressed. I notice that I have such a good time and enjoy my life when I'm NOT worried about something, and after I discuss my issues with a therapist or friends. I am a major freaker-outer, what some people call a "spaz". It's not fun. I don't have a problem getting out of bed - I look forward to each day, it's just that I worry about everything (and the break up has made my anxiety worse--I had been doing really well for, like, 2 years til that happened) and it takes the joy out!

20090131171642AABld1U	Health;Mental Health	How do i cope with this?	Background:    I'm 21 and at home with roommates, attending college. Far away from parents' home. I'm trying to do my taxes tonight but alas, I forgot the W-2 form at my parents' house when I was there over winter break. I knew that I needed the information on the form so I called my mother. She does the finances in the house. When talking to her she says in the middle of trying to get information on a form, "what's wrong, you sound tired." Please note, I have been on medication for anxiety for almost two years now. I'm not sure if there's a connection between constantly being asked what's wrong or not. In any event I said I'm not tired I'm just looking to get the facts. ie: the info on the W-2.    I'm not left frustrated. On top of the mother telling or asking what's wrong and implying that she beleives me to be tired, my friends are saying i should go to a party at my friends' ex-girlfriends place, who's having an hawaiin party. I'm tired of house parties. I have work to do. On top of that, I need sleep if I want to get up to snow shoe in the morning. On top of it all, I don't think the girl of my dreams is wearing a bikini at a house party. One night stand, maybe. But I've never had one nor want one.    So I've got,  1. Frustration from mother telling me how I feel. Okay, so she "asks" how I feel, but if you're asking, you're bloody thinking it. It's all relative.  2. I feel like an odd soul for not wanting to go party. I'd rather be at home with a girlfriend. I don't have a girlfriend so I'm okay just doing homework instead and getting a good nights sleep. It's like I'm the only kid I know that has this mind set.

I was running into home, and I slid (Under the pass) and  when I slid my helmet fell off. well their 1st basemen thru it to the catcher who missed. (she never ended up touching it) and it hit me in the head.       The accident made it so i was stunned for about 3 seconds. It felt like my helmet was shaken on my head but it was my head shaking itself. (Does that made sense?) well I was still on the base due to the stun when my mom and my coach came over to help me up. It had bounced off of my head and into the fence.  My mom heard it from the stands. I couldn't walk. I stumbled for a little while. I didn't cry tho. IDK why.       anyways, I sat out one inning and then continued to play. I was O.K. as far as I was concerned. I was only slightly dizzy and I get hurt a lot. i walk it off. I had it iced. well my mom wanted to take me to the ER but i wouldn't go because I didn't wanna leave my team. (I play 3 important positions, pitcher, catcher and short. we rotate) my mom said fine. there's an EMT on the field. I didn't go. It turned out one of my teammates mom was a nurse. she checked me out and said it was a bad bump and it wasn't bleeding but very well would have. at the time, she said I didn't have a concussion. but it's true that it could take hours for it to show and for internal bleeding to occur. it scared the **** out of my mom. and she was very skeptical about letting me continue to play. I am babysitting tonight and she told me I couldn't go to sleep until she got home.      Well, now my head really hurts and I am a little fuzzy. I'm not sure what to do. she forgot her cell phone so I have no way to contact her. I can see straight and I can walk. my view is just slightly (a lil bit) fuzzy.       I'm sorry it was so long.

Its all behind my eyes, front of the head, up the back of my neck and in my jaw/ under my eyes (cheekbones). I have had some permanent plates/retainers put in on Thursday, which could I guess be making this headache, no matter what the cause I am in a lot of discomfort, to top it all off I have had sore shoulders. It is probably all contributing. What can I do? Pain killers aren't working, I tried having a nap but I cant get to sleep. I have also been drinking lots of bottles of water, at first I thought it was dehydration but its not.       Could it be sinusitis? I have had it before, with dental pain. but this time I am thinking I am jumping to that idea too quickly as I have the pain from the retainers/plates in my mouth (which feel like they are effecting my jaw).       Thanks in advance.

I hit puberty early and i already have pubes and underarm hair, and i'm starting to notice an almost unoticable hairs around the belly button. My mom's dad is not very hairy at all but my dad;s side is. So, with my body shape like my mom's dad, will my body hair also be like that? I hope. but, the hair on my head is mucher thicker like my dad's side. so, Will i be hairy or is this early hair just because of puberty? I'll award points to the best answerer....
20090131180424AAEiPH2	Health;Men's Health	Is this really true? Be honest....?	When you shave body hair, does it really grow back thicker/darker? I've heard both yes and no... does it depend on the person? Cuz i'm only like 15 and starting to get some unwanted stomach hair and i want to know if shaving it will only bring misery in the future. And no, i'm not asking your opinion on whether or not i should keep the hair.    what are some other ways of removing the hair? also, why would it grow back thicker?

I helped my ex through a suicide attempt at xmas after he left me pregnant 3 months before and now hes suddenly announced on the 20th of jan that hes met a girl on facebook who lives an hour away and that he is very happy and sorry he no longer loves me.He is angry at me constantly and she is the best thing in the world,he keeps telling me how happy he is after less than two weeks of knowing her!He is taking time off work to spend with her which is out of character and he is a completely different person the last 4 months.He seems delusional for example he feels that it is acceptable for me to ask for money when i need nappys for our upcoming baby rather than pay child support!I know he was overly hyper when we first split,getting in debt and drinking,exercising excessively and swinging from wanting to try with us to not wanting to even say a kind word to me!      But why has he gone from wanting to commit suicide and writing the notes on walls in the livingroom to seeking out a girlfriend on the net,knowing her 4 days and commiting to her whilst spending a week over there after!this is less than a month after!???

I got an MRI and CT and they both came up clear, so my neurologist diagnosed me with Neuralgia. He didn't give any medication or explain it, so I was wondering what it was all about.    My neuologist made the diagnosis based on the pain on the side of my head and tingly feeling on the top of my head. My doctors don't know about this, but I will randomly get the same pains in other parts of my body. They don't last long, anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes, but the pain is severe. Can this be linked to the Neuralgia? If yes, would it make a difference if I told my doctor about the rest of my symptoms?    I am 15 years old, and I am a little confused about this whole thing. I'm not sure how to handle it, and it's been haunting me for quite a while. How should I explain it to my friends? A little advice would be great :)

I've been having this white vaginal discharge for about six months now, it smells like bread and the discharge goes away when my period comes on, but comes right back when its over. The discharge was itchy and clumpy at times, but usually just thin and watery, then sometimes thick. So on Wed I went to planned parenthood and I got a paps test and she took a swab of the discharge and she told me I have both a yeast infection and BV. She gave me some pills to take for both the BV (bacterial Vaginosis) and the yeast infection. I'm concerned because I want to have kids in about a year or so. I'm 23 right now. One of the nurses that work there told me that BV doesn't usually cause PID, but I'm reading that it can. How likely is it that I have PID from a 6 month discharge that was diagnosed as BV. I started taking the medication for it on Thursday! Anyone with BV before? Please share your experiences. Will I still be able to concive if I have BV after its treated? I'm scared...

Also, I'm just now getting over mono, but that shouldn't cause it.  I woke up this morning and I couldn't get out of bed. I was very shakey and eating barely helped.  It was like my food was digested really fast and I was really weak.  Also, the mono is almost gone, so I should have my balance back, but it's worse.  I constantly fall over and It's hard to stand on one foot.  I don't think it's natural to lose so much weight so fast.  I weighed myself, so it's not the board.

I usually do not eat during the day until dinner time, and if I do this on camp, my teachers will probably make me eat or want to 'talk' to me. I have teachers that do know about this, but not all of them do, and i am not sure If the ones who do know will be on this camp. Like what do I do? I have to eat, and I mostly likely will not be able to throw it up because people will know if i do. Only a few people know about this and I do not want others to know because I feel so ashamed. So please how can I eat without people noticing that I am not eating, or how can I get rid of my food without people hearing me. I HAVE to go on this camp because it is part of the curriculum. Please no lectures.   My parents do know, but they do not think that this is serious enough, so they are practically avoiding the whole situation. My school psychologist also knows, but he was not any help AT ALL. My teachers were more supportive that my parents or school psychologist. I have tried to talk to my parents countless times, it is NO help AT ALL.   Thank You.

I was an obsessive eater probably consuming over 2,500 calories a day, I cut it to about 1,200.   I dance and play soccer but am sitting and doing homework most of the week. With my moderate active level how long will it take to obtain this goal.    Also what workouts will be good for cardio on a busy schedule.

20090131214835AAa2Rw6	Health;Women's Health	Am I having a miscarriage or whats going on?!?!?	ok, i went to the hospital about a week ago because i started bleeding heavy at work. Im around 7-8 weeks pregnant and had cramping as well. They then told me i was having a threatend miscarriage but the baby was still in there. The bleeding lessoned and then stoped for a day or two and i began bleeding again last night at work heavy again. The first time was bright red this time was a brick red. with cramping again. But im not passing any tissue. The hospital didnt tell me anything about my blood work or what the ultrasound showed ( crappy hospital huh ) and my doctors appointment isnt for another week. What the heck is going on ? And could I be losing the baby and if so, will bleeding occur days before the baby comes out? I thought if my body was stretching and just bleeding because of that it wouldnt be heavy and wouldnt stop for 2 days and bleed heavy again with cramps. My breats are still tender. Also it isnt my period time so i dont think im having my periods while im pregnant. ugh! i just need some kind of answers

20090131192251AAsEtpU	Health;Mental Health	I have a problem as a result of an accident , need help?	I was in a car accident in october of 07 and I was in the hospital for a year recovering and going through rehabilitation. The car accident left me with mil brain damage. My problems are I have trouble concentrating, my coordination is off balance, and my memory is real bad. To the point sometimes I forget what I am doing.Or just do something that doesn't make sense.   While I was in the hospital I lost my job, my apt, and my girl of 7 years who I wanted to marry. I am no longer capable of driving. I use to be really out going and loved to talk with people. NOw I just want to sit around and not be bothered, and when I try to engage in any conversation I forget what I want to say, can't remember certain words, and it just makes me upset and I feel like I am not the same person I use to be and I am just a shell of my former self. People that know me , know why this is , but stangers look at me funny and think I am just slow. When I am a very intelligent person.  This is a problem because I want to work again but it is hard because people think I am crazy or just slow. I don't even want to be around anyone, my own family treats me differently. Now I live with my mom because she took me in after this accident, but she is always blaming me for my problems like this is my fault that it happened and I wouldn't have this problem if it wasn't something I did wrong. She is always telling me to go out and get a job, but I pay rent and I am on disability now. She doens't seem to understand what I am going through, mostly because I try to act as normal as possible considering my circumstances which is very hard to do and I just don't talk to her, I get what I need tell her what I want in very short and to the point sentances. She knows there is something wrong, because she always tells me to go downstairs into the basement. Tomorrow is the superbowl and my brother and his girlfriend are coming over to watch with my mom, and she told me that she wants me to not be downstairs in the basement because that is where they want to watch it at, but this is the only place for me in the house. I feel really bad, like my own mother is ashamed of me and doesn't want me to make a bad impression on my brothers girlfriend who is expecting his child. I don't know how much longer I can take this , I was hoping that it would get better but it hasn't and seems like it is just getting worse. Sometimes I wish that this accident would have killed me and me and everyone else would be better off. Will this ever get better? I want to feel like myself again, and I feel like I am at the end of my rope.

THen today (sunday) had sex, and it really hurts when my boyfriend puts it andmoves. its like just the outside of the entrance of my vagina down towards the anus that really hutrs. i dont understand why i have been in pain these past 2 times?      my doctor tested me for chlamydia and ghonnareha(sp?) and it came back all clear. now because i had a little cut near my vagina she tested me for herpes to just to be sure, but said its most likely just because i had thrush. im waitin for the results to come bak wednesday and also going for another pap then.      Why does it hurt ? COuld i still not be over the thrush or something?

20090131191222AA1aTUv	Health;Women's Health	Pregnancy test at hospital was negative?	I went to the emergency room last night, and I was so out of it because I was feeling so sick.  They put an IV in my arm and I THINK they also drew some blood right before they put the IV in.  I went through a lot of tests and peed in a cup and had a pelvic exam too.  Later on the doctor was talking to me and mentioned that the pregnancy test came back negative.  I was relieved because for the past couple of months I have been worried about that.  But now that I am back at home, I'm over analyzing everything like I always do.  So my question is, did they do a urine test or a blood one??  i wasn't even thinking about it because I was so sick.  I was just happy it was negative.      Do hospitals do urine pregnancy tests?  I'm hoping it was a blood test, because then I KNOW I have nothing to worry about.

I have never had surgery before and I am so scared and nervous. I recently went to the orthodontist and they found that I have 'supernumerary teeth' meaning the condition of having extra teeth. The teeth are not visible to then human eye nor can they be felt. You can only see them on x-rays. They are right behind my front teeth in the roof of my mouth way far up into my gums. The surgeon told me it would be a lot more comfortable to be put to sleep because I won't even know that it happened. But I am very nervous about being put to sleep while having surgery, it's just something that's not appealing to me and I would want to be awake while I have the surgery, but he said that would feel uncomfortable and it wouldn't be pleasant to hear the drilling and so on, but he said I can bring some music to listen to if I decide to stay awake. He said the roof of the mouth is very sensitive and it will be very uncomfortable to stay awake. Now I really want to stay awake, but yet again I want to go to sleep. My mother is pushing me to stay awake and my father tells me to go to sleep. What should I do? I really need help and this is scaring me so much, can you help to calm me down?      Thank you.

I sat in a guys lap and he moved in ''way'' so i got tingly.( i no sounds weird) but we both had clothes on. So that couldn't affect it.       What should i do. Is i because i'm regulating.

My mom is in her last days/weeks of her battle in cancer,   her GI tract is not working as shes had a server bowl blockage since nov.   we found out she has some form of blood clot in her lung and she went back to hospital a couple of nights ago.   Today they went through with a procedure where they put a needle into her colon and had a tube to drain fluids out.. It worked really well for this and we were all really happy (as there was concern over the swelling of her abdomen and thinking it might rupture.

20090131202943AAoXxNK	Health;Mental Health	She's a success story too!?	I don't mean to sound like a Facebook stalker, but on my newsfeed a note came up about a friend of mine that she wrote--a 25 question thing. Being I have depression/social anxiety disorder on a Saturday night, I have nothing better to do so I read it.    She stated that she was diagnosed with manic depression a year and a half ago. She struggle to fine the right medications, but once she did her life was back on track. Also, her father that she had a strained relationship turned out to become one of her biggest sources of support.     I always feel bad for having depression--like I think something is wrong with me personally. Kind of a guilt trip. When I hear someone I respect has dealt with the same type of issue, it gives me hope that someday I'll deal with this better. Right now I'm in therapy trying to get things straightened out and back on track since now my life's pretty much a mess.
20090131203150AA73Uvu	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Possibly a broken ankle hopefully just sprained.?	Okay so i was up in the snow today and jumped off this sled and landed really awkward on my ankle. I felt some popping. I took a while to get up but when I did I was able to put minimal weight on it. The hard part was trying to walk uphill on unstable snow.      I would like to know what would be the symptoms if it was broken? Would i be able to set any weight on it without collapsing in pain? I pretty much stood on it on one foot but when i bend it a certain way that's where i feel some pain. Could the popping have been maybe some tendons or muscle strain? I really can't afford to go to the doctor unless absolutely necessary. There was nothing protruding but after an hour i'm noticing some swelling finally. That little pointy bone on the outside of my ankle finally is showing some swelling. What would be the best way to care for it if it's just a nasty sprain? and what should i look out for in case it is in fact broken.

20090131193304AAuy7Zk	Health;Other - Health	I often have small white/yellowish things in the back of my throat. They usually end up in small pockets. ?	On either side of my tonsils. They have a bread like consistency that has a strong foul odor- an extreme bad breathe odor. I usually get them up by coughing roughly and even trying to use my toothbrush they don't always come out easy but eventually. As long as i remember i would get them but they would be very very tiny and occasionally when i would cough or sneeze they would pop out but recently i've noticed that they have become large and irritate the back of my throat not really a pain but an annoyance and irrigation. I often thought they could be a build up of small food particles but shouldn't everyone that eats have the same problem? My fiancee has never once had this issue... Could it be something is wrong and there is a way of avoiding the bread balls (what i call them) ?
20090131202805AAIv4lw	Health;Diet & Fitness	I want to lose weight [/generic question]?	I want to lose weight. I'm 14, almost 15 and I'm a guy, and I'm pretty sure I'm going through a growth spurt right now. This leads to a few questions. First, I'm going to tell you a few things my friends told me and some I found online.   1. Excess water diets don't work.   2. Doing sit-ups increases muscle mass, it does not burn fat (or perhaps it does, but not much).   3. Losing weight quickly will only mean it will be harder to maintain that weight, and you will most likely end up gaining it back and then some.      So my questions for you are:   Seeing as how I'm going through my growth spurt, should I be trying to lose weight?   If I should, how should I go about doing this, running? (Note that I'm not trying to lose it fast, I'm by no means in a rush, I just want it gone eventually.)

(1) An underactive thyroid (which I take a pill daily for)   (2) Lots of digestive problems - acid reflux, heart burn pains, lost taste buds (I have a few meds to help control SOME of these symptoms - pantoloc, pepto, pepcid AC)   (3) I aspirate with everything (the liquids drip into my lungs) - I have 2 inhalers to help clean out the phlegm and whatever else goes in there   (4) Trouble eating, since my lower jaw stopped growing when I had my treatments, and my throat has even tightened on me to the point that I've had to have it surgically stretched back open   (5) Weight problems - I have NEVER been more then 100lbs (I'm only 5'1 but I am told I should be between 110-120lbs)   (6) I lost two-thirds of my hearing    (7) Anxiety and panic attacks - I take ativan for this, but it makes me tired all the time - I've tried 3 different antidepressants, had bad reactions to ALL of them   (8) Lack of energy, I tire out very fast, my muscles feel sore for days after I try to exercise or work out   (9) Headaches every day - caused by any of the above conditions      I feel burnt out and sore and depressed - I can't seem to manage ALL these things at the same time - SOMETHING always feels likes its wrong in my body - I always feel sick       I;ve been to doctors for ALL of these problems, and they perscribe meds to help "maintain" the pains of these conditions ... I have 6 medications I take daily (for thyroid, stomach, headaches n anxiety), and another 7 meds for "as needed" times ... I;m tired of this "living off medications" feeling      I want to remember what it was like to wake up in the morning HAPPY and actually look forward to what the day has to offer me ... but it seems all my medical conditions hold me back from being able to enjoy life!      I have changed my diet to healthier, non fattening foods - which have curbed my heartburn for the most part ... but I am not getting enough food and exercise in a day to truely feel healthy      Any input or ideas on how I can manage and deal with all these medical conditions ... so that I can enjoy my life a bit more and not feel sick everyday ???      Thanks for your time all !!

He told me that scoliosis is more common in women than men. I had asked him what where the chances of my son getting it and he said about 5% where if I had had a daughter she would have  a better chance of getting it. I had a spinal fusion nearly 5 years ago. I had two curves in my spine.

My son is 13 months old and about a month or two ago I started getting these really bad pains in my back. I have scoliosis and I had a spinal fusion to correct it. I guess the bottom where the rods weren't placed has gotten worse. That isnt where the pain is.    Anyways.... My doctor said that pain is common after having a baby and is having me go into physical therapy. He says that if the physical thereapy doesn't help then he wants to get a bone scan done to see if it is a "false joint". I had my surgery five years ago this july.   I was wondering how common it is to have have pain after a spinal fusion and after having a baby when you have had the operation.

I fractured my pinkie about 5 years ago and got it set back in place/a stint from some doctor (he honestly didn't seem like too nice of a guy, though)      After it healed it always bothered me, I don't really have a full range of motion with it and when I move it it is very stiff (especially at a certain angle where it almost "locks" up, but I can push it past).      Recently it has been giving me even more trouble because I'm starting to work out and it's a pain when I try and do things like push-ups.      I was just wondering if this was something that is expected of healed bones, if the doctor could have set it wrong, or maybe it didn't heal properly possibly by my fault?

It started out with a few symptoms of a cold, which I could deal with considering it's winter with the cold weather. Then I went from being okay, to complete death last Sunday. I slept all day, my throat was killing me. My mom had just assumed it was a cold, and to just rest up and get better. When my throat became progressively worse because I had trouble swallowing, and she saw that my glands are completely puss infected (sorry for gross detail), she took me to the doctor. I don't have mono, or strep, and I was prescribed penicillin to take, along with getting a shot to reduce the size of my glands. I know this is beginning to become long so sorry for everyone who's pained to read this!      Bottom line is, I am in horrible pain when I breath, speak, eat.. basically anything. and i've tried EVERYTHING. Gargling with salt water, peroxide, ceprocol numbing coughdrops/ spray.

I was first given amoxicillin for having strep throat.  After 7 days of the 10 day dose (1000mg every 12 hours) I woke up with a horrible sore throat and feeling feverish.  I went back to my doctor and she told me to stop taking the amox and start on a Z-Pack.  She said since I have a history of having to take more than one dose of antibiotics due to probably being somewhat resistant to antibiotics, I would need to start on a new antibiotic and discontinue the old one since it was not working.  So now Im on the 3rd day of the Z-Pack and now I have gotten a horrible cold...or at least the symptoms of one.  My sore throat is gone, but my nose is so congested/stuff/runny and im always having to clear my throat of mucus.  yuck.  The mucus is clear, although in the mornings, it is a yellowish color and seems to be getting worse as the days progress.  Is this cause for concern???  Is it possible to just get a common cold while on antibiotics?  Or do I need to once again go back to my doctor?

I became agoraphobic about 6 months ago but prior to my agoraphobic spell I had friends, acquaintances and a relatively healthy social network though I still felt miserable.   I became agoraphobic because all the bad experiences in my life finally got the better of me, all the verbal and physical bullying I have endured over my adolescence finally caught up with me in one big lump and caused me to recluse in my house, basically all my negative experiences massively outweighed the few positive experiences that have done very little to compensate. I finally got CBT therapy to conquer my agoraphobia and depressive episodes and it has helped somewhat but has done little to help me deal with feeling like the odd one out in any crowd or the ugliest person alive.

I woke up Friday morning with a few blisters on each wrist. Throughout Friday the rash spread to my leg then abdomen. By Saturday it had gotten worse so my family made me go to the ER. The ER doctors said it was maybe contact dermatitis or a virus. They gave me a shot, prednisone and stuff to help the itching. It hadn't gotten better by Monday but in fact had spread to my toes so I went to my doctor's office. My doctor couldn't see me so a nurse saw me, freaked out and sent me to a dermatologist. The dermatologist said she thought it was a drug allergy. I take a few medications for my headaches and back problems. She kept saying, "it's so diffuse that it has to be a drug allergy". It hasn't gotten better and I was googling, accidentally came across scabies and it looks like my rash. Now I am freaking out!!!!! I don't want to give this to my baby. Could my doctor miss scabies? I have dogs. I have read that dogs can pass it to humans and have also read that they cannot. We have had all of these squirrels dying in our neighborhood, is there a link?

It eventually healed but I had surgery on it again to remove damaged tissue. Recently I started to become more active trying to shade off the weight I gained from being immobile. So I walk on the tread mill 30 minutes and my doctor said that was fine.      The beginning of this week, I noticed to feel discomfort in my right knee. When I walk or apply any pressure to it- its like an arthitist pain, something I haven't experienced before. As the week went by the pain became much more prominent. Now I can feel the pain when I'm even sitting. I started to wear my tennis shoes hoping that maybe it was my heals causing the pain.

20090226092023AAnR8qj	Health;Women's Health	My boyfriend said something very homosexual during foreplay?	While I was giving him a hand job, I had one arm around his neck and the other on his penis. So my ear was pretty close to his mouth. And when he was about to come he said something along the lines of, "I want you inside of me." I'm not even kidding, so I asked what he said and he didn't answer so I just kept going. I don't know if he got his terminology mixed up or something, but shouldn't he have said, "I want to be inside of you." Instead? I'm positive he said "I want you inside of me." because it would have sounded way different if it was the other way around. This is a serious question, and I'm actually worried that he might be gay. What should I do??????? Do you think it was just an honest mistake?

20090131131432AAYiNOl	Health;Mental Health	I am burnt out with life and i'm only 17 years old...?	I'm a 17 year old guy living in california who has too many problems to list so i'll just throw a few out there:   1. I have been fighting with my parents for almost 5 years and haven't even said "I love you" for maybe 7 or 8 years.   2. I started to use hard drugs such as opiates, meth, speed, coke, etc. when i was 15 as a way to remain sane and prevent suicide.   3. I believe I have some type of mental issues like depression and/or ADHD, and after I quit using cocaine when i was 16, I think I developed either some form of manic depression/bipolar disorder and I began to see my grades drop even more and the problems of focusing got worse with the addition of extreme mood swings that my friends described as "the other me".      I can't focus on anything except chemistry and other forms of science. I can never bring myself to do homework and I haven't completed a homework assignment in almost 3 years of high school. I will also literally catch myself listening to someone talking directly to me but i will be thinking of something else and not absorbing a single word they are saying. It's almost like they're talking, but not a single comprehensible sound is issuing from their mouth.      I have tried illegal street drugs such as amphetamines, methamphetamines, and cocaine but they actually mellow me out, make me hungry, and help me focus. Whereas others i know who have done them before become extremely hyper, energized, and anorexic. The exact opposite of me?      I am almost about to drop out of high school 3 months from graduation simply because i can't stand to sit in a classroom and listen to the teacher blabber on forever about something i already know and understand.      I don't want to have to use illicit drugs to be able to focus my scrambled thoughts, but i'm not entirely sure who to talk to?      I meet almost all of the DSM-IV "symptoms" of ADHD and whatever my problem is, ADHD or not, it's beginning to severly and negatively ruin my life.      I have nobody to talk to, have almost killed myself, and can't see my future ahead of me. PLEASE HELP
