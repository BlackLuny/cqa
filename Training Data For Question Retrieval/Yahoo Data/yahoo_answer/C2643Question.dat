20090202201722AA3FO9m	Pets;Reptiles	Can I feed my bearded dragon this?	Is it okay if i just feed my bearded dragon only crickets for his meals? As in no mealworms, waxworms, superworms, etc. And as for greens I have only been feeding my dragon romaine lettuce mixed with chopped carrots. I also dust my crickets and veggies as well. My biggest concern was do I need to give him other type of insects besides crickets? or just feeding my dragon purely crickets is fine? Same goes for greens and veggies do I need to mix in other types of greens and veggies as well? Such as collard greens, mustard greens, green beans, or cabbages.      BTW - Is romaine lettuce ok for a bearded dragon? My vet and all the pet store tells me its fine but all the caresheets online says there are no nutritional value in romaine lettuce. Please help thank you =D

Taz is my female tiel and Duke is my male. They are NOT bonded. Taz is about 9-10 months old now and Duke is 1 year 2 months. Taz is obviously not very interested in breeding, she's way too young anyway, but Duke absolutely LOVES her! She'll go about doing her every day things and Duke will get right in her face and make a small chirping sound- he's flirting.    He does this ALL day long. And Taz ignores him.    By 9pm it gets annoying because he starts to literally scream in her face. I'm worried for him and I wanted to know if I should separate them or if I should just cover the cage when he does this or what? I don't know what to do. I've had birds for a few years and I've never seen a bird act this way before. It's like Taz is playing hard to get.

First, my cat has some matted hair underneath her chin and on the side of her face, and she hasn't cleaned it ( I don't think she can reach) so I tried to cut off the hair with scissors. I was petting her in her favorite spot and she was purring like crazy, and then when i went to go cut it she went BANANAS and scratched me like crazy! (She is 9 weeks old). So any suggestions on how to clean it? I tried using a wet washcloth but it didn't work.      Second, now that she scratched me because of the scissors, she is scared of me! =( She's not letting me hold her or put her on my bed. I can't lure her with treats because seeing as she is a young kitty, she isn't interested in them yet. What can I do to win her love back? Will she forget about the scissor thing?      p.s. the scissors were blunt and safe, so please don't think I harmed my kitty.

If there's any cat experts please help me out, thank you.

20070311141246AA1Lrhc	Pets;Dogs	What besides poison can cause a healthy young dog to suddenly stop eating and bleed to death internally?	My 1 yr old dane mix was eating my coonhound's poo so I fed the coonhound Deter. A frew days later the dane who has a VERY healthy appetite quit eating but I attributed this to the Deter and didn't worry. When a few more days went by and he still wouldn't eat and was losing weight I took him to the vet - who said he had a gastric ulcer and possibly Addison's disease (we get the results tom.) They kept him for 3 days with an IV - his electrolytes were low - and his 2nd night he actually ate so they sent him back home. The day he came home (yesterday) he looked anorexic but happy, then this morning I found him laying in the rain and mud and he tried to get up and fell over. We took him to the emergency vet and he began to have bloody diarrhea and they kept him and tried their best for a few hours but he bled to death. He has not gotten into any kind of poison and has always been healthy until now - and the timinig with respect to the Deter seems fishy. Any possibility it is related?

My husband passed away about8 months ago.  They have been in heat about 3 times since then.  Fortunately--not at the same time.        In the years past, they were not as bad.  They did not cry as much.  They were not as bitchy to each other--or to the fixed 5 year old male    cat.        It also seemed as if they were not in heat as bad for so long.      Is this normal?        And, do you think that it is too late to get the cats fixed?

There is also a cat that sits at his cage every morning, could he finally have gotten scared by it?

20090202230718AAFy6r0	Pets;Dogs	Possible to balance a life with a dog?	alright, im an 18 who owns a 1 yr old golden retriever. my work shift varies greatly. 9-5. then 11-8. sometimes 3-10. etc. its just all over the board. and to top it off, i live in apartments without a backyard so the only physical excersize my dog can get is when i take him to a park or for walks.      problem is, when i work 5-6 days a week, i want to spend my time with my friends, or my girlfriend...or even after i get off work im either really tired or i just dont wanna be home.. i want to be with my girlfriend.      my question is, is it possible to balance this dog in my life, and actually take care of him? im really torn between it because this dog..is the best dog you'd ever meet. doesnt bark. doesnt eat trash/your food. hes so sweet, and so calm. i KNOW ill never get a dog like this ever again. and ive always wanted a golden. and i know in the summer time if i didnt have this dog id be wishing i did. i think of how hes sometimes a nuisance, then when i take him out and i see him just stop and look up at me, i just smile.. not to mention hes always there for me when im lonely or sad.         just so you guys know, what im working with... heres jake.       http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...        http://c1.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...       and this one, any animal lover will love.   jake is trying to paw at a lazer light (cutest thing seeing this big dog chase after a red light), while my cat, thinks hes trying to paw at HER. so she fights back!!       http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v664/s...

20090202222126AAi9u3V	Pets;Fish	Curious about fertilizers for freshwater plants?	I'm  to wanting to grow my own Anacharis to feed my turtles. I have a feeder tank that's cycled with guppies and snails in it. If i wanted to cause my plants to grow rapidly could I put Miracle grow or other stronger fertilizer in with the snails and fish or should I set up a plant tank and go about it that way? I'm getting the turtles as hatchlings so their diet will be mostly protein for a good while so I have time to raise a bunch of plants. I'm just worried about what chemicals in the fertilizer might burn and kill the fish and snails. Never took chemistry in school. lol thanks for the help :)

I've been riding dressage for a few years after switching from hunters (it was a trainer thing) and I've never understood what the judges were looking at.

20090202222538AAWCsJ2	Pets;Dogs	How should my friend be training his fully grown dog?	Well, to start off, this is my first time here, so what up everyone! Name's Josh and I know there are some bright people here. Alright, got that done with, now for the actual question.    You see, my best friend not too long ago (I'd say a good 3 monthes, but it feels like more) adopted a Husky as a dog, which, in my opinion, is a VERY beautiful dog. But something has to change about the way he trains his dog. A little background information on Shadow (the name he gave her) she was adopted by my friend and was always fed table scraps, which is why Shadow always walks to us during dinner and begs. And from the sounds of it, wasn't really treated well either from the previous shelter (obviously if she ended up in an animal shelter). Sorry, I don't know TOO much about Shadow, but you can atleast touch on what her attitude is... kinda. Anyways, my friend did research and saw something about dogs love being "dominate". And I guess a dog gets its dominance either peeing or pooping (I'm just going to be blunt guys). So in this case, whenever he takes her on walks, he doesn't let her go to the bathroom at all. So I guess that his dog just can't hold it any longer that she goes on the sidewalk. Then when she does, my friend tells her no, but then hits her in the nose. Not a tap, but a hit. To me, personally, I don't know or really even care about the whole dominance thing. If a dog thinks it's tougher than me, I'll play with it and bring her down, you know? Just me though. But anyways... yeah.... my friend doesn't want her going anywhere else but at his home, which I think it's unhealthy for the dog. And with the hitting, he could get in trouble and/or the dog will just grow to hate him and BYE BYE to that relationship. So guys... please answer this question, and tell me if there are other alternative ways and PLEASE tell me them. I'll talk to you all later. If you someone seems a little unclear about something, just shoot an email at me. My other email is avengedblade@hotmail.com. Talks to you all later!

20090203001449AAfg30x	Pets;Cats	My cat is trying to pass worms and I think they're killing her!?	My two cats went to the vet a couple days ago and were diagnosed with tapeworms, roundworms, and hookworms. They were given the necessary de-wormer medications. Just a little while ago, one of my cats started screaming and yowling, writhing around on the floor like she was army crawling, trying to pop a squat every time she could lift herself up. Then she would just lay down on her side exhausted. I could see her gut twitching like crazy, and she just starts crying and growling.       What on earth is happening to her!?! Is she trying to pass worms? Are they killing her? I've called my mom for advice, tried to contact a vet, but obviously places are closed. I have no idea what to do and I'm terrified! Does anyone know what is going on or what I should do about it?

20090203002745AARD6HD	Pets;Dogs	Which dog is dominate?	I have a male am. bulldog and female am. bulldog/pit. The female is 14 months and the male is 16 months (I don't know if that matters). My husband and I cannot figure out who is dominate.       He will hump her head (she wont let him hump her backside) and then later clean her face/ears for her, but she does the same to him. She will stand over him while he is laying down, then later in the day clean him. I've heard the submissive one generally is the one to clean the other, so they both show signs of being the dominate one and the submissive one.      They each have their own kennel, and their own bones, and they share both of them. They used to go into the same kennel and we'd have to coax one out and into the other kennel. And with the bones they usually end up chewing the same one until it gets too slobbery and both move onto the other one.      They do share a bed and they both start off on it and then throughout the night one will always end up on the floor, but its never the same one.      They eat at the same time right next to each other and the male always finishes firsts and sits there until the female is done, then they will lick each others bowls.      I know that's a long question, but we cannot figure out who is dominate! Does one of them HAVE to be and which do you think is?

Do you know a dog that lives peacefully with big dogs? I know all dogs have different personalities but i was just wondering. Also, what qualities should I look for in a little dog? (if I want him to be okay with my shepard) Thanks!
20090202163254AAMnPKn	Pets;Fish	A question for aquarium experts?	I starting a new aquarium that's supposed to look as natural as possible.       What kind of underwater moss should I use that would NOT float around?       Should I use some kind of mesh on the floor of the tank for it to grow?      What substrate should I use on the bottom? (Sand, gravel, etc)       Please try not to copy and paste answers. It rarely answers anything ad it is plagerism.

20090202210620AArnOP4	Pets;Dogs	Is it normal for my puppy to...?	growl at me?  He is a 9 week old shih tzu puppy.  He is very sweet, gentle to children and knows no strangers.  He loves everyone.      But sometimes, he growls at me.  He growls when I am using the computer or busy while he is in his playpen (but it only happens around 3-4 times a day).    I believe he growls to get attention.  I don't pick him up or pet him when he growls though.  I just ignore him.    He also growls at me after he successfully pee or defecate on his puppy pad. I usually give him treats when he goes potty on the pads, but if I miss it (not see him go potty on the pad), he growls at me.  Is it his way of telling me that he went potty on the pad, therefore I should give him a treat? I am so confused.      He also growls when we play...     What should I do to stop it, or is this normal and should not be stopped?   Please help.      Please don't be mean :)

We have another cat, a female, who is eight years old. I have placed him once near her, and she hisses at him, and growls. He just wants to play with her, and he constantly chases her whenever she's running from him. I have no idea what I can do to help them get along, what should I do?      Someone suggested I put him in a towel, then wrap that same towel on her, but it didn't really work so well!      Please, My children are always sad that their two favorite pets are now enemies.

I've had her for 3 weeks and the last 2 times I've cleaned her cage (cleaning it again tom) I put her in the bathtub but she hates it. I dont like her in there either since I need to clean her cage in the garage. She doesn't seem to like her hamster ball either. And Im scared someone won't know shes in the bathtub or accidentely leave the door open and my cats will get in. Where should I keep her? She loves running around. And where could I clean her cage cause I'd like to keep an eye on her while I clean the cage in the garage, but its too hot in there. Anyways, thanks for anyone's help!
20090202210216AAgR1mS	Pets;Dogs	Dogs killing sheep? Did they do it?	Okay so our neighbor is accusing our Husky (Rocky) and our Chocolate Lab (Brownie) of killing his sheep. Here is the scenario. He claims he heard a commotion down in his fenced in barn area earlier in the day heard barking (we live in the country lots of dogs not uncommon) and did not think anything of it. Then about six hours later his son heard something and he went to investigate. He said when he got to the barn he saw the injured sheep and the dogs (he didn't actually see the dogs do anything) He was on the outside of the fence he said he did not want to holler at the dogs and startle them in case they turned on him so instead he climbs in and calls to the dogs (he knows their names they have wandered the neighbor hood before) Rocky comes over friendly as can be (they really are sweet dogs no I am not just saying that they are sweethearts) And he calls my brothers to come get the dogs and so they can sort out the mess. So Brownie has no blood on her what so ever. Rocky has a little on his paws and muzzle. I know does not sound good. The neighbor even said it is instinct with a dog to do this. He wants to settle this neighbor to neighbor, since we let him use our land to graze his sheep. Okay that is fine. So what I want to know is how can these dogs destroy 3 sheep, one is missing and 3 are injured severely with out getting all bloody? Also why wouldn't they have done it when the sheep are on our land and they had the oppurtunity? Rocky is usual tied or in his kennel cause he is a wanderer. Brownie never is because she never leaves without us our her leader Rocky. Rocky often breaks free when he is tied and just runs until he has had enough and then comes home. When the sheep are on our land wouldn't that make for territory issues as well as instinct? We suggested coyotes (we have them around here you can hear them at night) He says a coyote wouldn't go into a fenced in area to get at an animal he says they would prefer them alone and away from the herd. Which may be well and good but wouldn't a hungry coyote act on instinct as well more so than dogs that are fed everyday? It is just out of character for these two dogs. Huskys are notourius cat killers and Rocky is buddy buddy with ours? Is it unlikely to think that coyotes killed the sheep the dogs smelled the blood in the air and went over to it? They are now classified as dangerous animals and have to be penned or on a leash at all times. Along with several other restrictions. Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks.

20081031161810AAWIDar	Pets;Dogs	Is it against the law to advertise that a dog is from a reputable breeder when it is from a puppy mill?	I spent $700.00 on puppy only to find out now she is a puppy mill pup. They advertise that all pups are from a reputable breeder. Also I am having DNA test done because I believe they lied about what breed she is. A month after I got her she was limping, took her to vet, found out she has Legge Perthes Disease, which was most likely from birth, had to have surgery  for that, this is hereditary so they are probably still breeding these dogs with this disease. They will not answer any emails or phone calls, all I want is info on breeder, or her parents. I have spent over$3000.00 so far on Sadie by the way I was told she was a Morkie(Maltese&Yorkie) I believe she is mixed with Westie. I dont care about the money I just want to know what I can do to stop these people or to get someone to investigate them. This has to be against the law, they are selling puppy mill pups and saying they are from reputable breeders, this pisses me off that these slime balls are making so much money off these pups, Any info would be greatly appreciated. How do we stop this   Tammy
20081102185928AATTMHx	Pets;Dogs	Any easy / painless ways to trim a formerly abused 40 lb dog's nails?	I adopted a dog that was apparently severely abused.  We've had him about 2 months and he still has trust issues.  Touching most places on his body elicits yelps of fear and possibly pain.  His nails are so long that his paws are off the ground and  the nails themselves are twisted sideways.   Two professionals have tried and failed to trim them.  I can't afford to have him 'put under' to trim them right now.  The vet said to relax him with Benadryl and trim them.   I now have several bites on my hand for just taking his paw -- so much for relaxed.  My daughter is in tears because my decision is to return him to the shelter in the morning.     So one more chance - 36 hours only - Has anyone had a similar experience? Please only respond if you have personally dealt with an abused or injured dog.   Also, I have two other dogs (3 yrs & 12 yrs) that were also abused animals and have trimmed their nails in front of the new dog to show that "everything is alright."

I have a 5 month old male rottweiler and he doesn't seem to think that my husband is the king of the house, he doesn't listen to him when he says drop it, he tried humping his leg, and he does the same thing to my three kids. But me he respects completely different, he listens to me, he has never tried humping my leg, he puts his ears back and rolls over onto his back when he has done something wrong, and he knows that I'm in charge. And out side when the kids are out there he plays kind of rough with them, he will jump and bite their clothes, shows his teeth. But it seems like he is just playing like he would with his litter mates. And I'm just lost I don't know what to do. And please don't tell me rottweilers are aggressive because I am a true rottweiler lover and I want to do EVERY thing I can to make sure he is brought up to be the very best that this breed of dog is.

He moves around and appears active but it looks like he's starting to turn a reddish-brown. He's really dark. When I look at him, he appears darker than normal. They're humidity is at 65 right now with the heat lamp on and the temperature is at 75. I do have a couple plants in there and I do use the calcium supplement on the crickets when I feed them to my lizards. He does appear to be really thin. I fed them earlier and I couldn't tell if he got crickets or not. I'm worried about him. They're in a 10 gallon tank with an under tank heater pad and a UVA lightbulb on a clamp lamp. His eye lid is red and I don't think it is normally.    I've been having a hard time keeping the humidity level up where it's supposed to be. Anyone have any ideas?
20090202204651AA5FvwW	Pets;Dogs	What should we do about our Terriers invisible friends?	Our dog, Stitch, a Westie, has recently fell into a complete fascination with invisible friends. She plays with them, barks at them, and simple stares and watches them for hours. It was unusual at first, but now it's getting worse. When we first got her, it was both her and her sister Lilo. Lilo died a few months ago due to a liver disease that none of the vets caught until it was too late. For the first month, Stitch didn't know what to do with herself and became more attached to the family due to the loss. Then, she got bored and while I came home from College, I've been spending my time with her. Once I got busy again with school, she found her invisible friend. We cant get another dog and all the others are much too big for her to play with. It may be due to boredom, but she seriously believes what she is playing with is alive. Any suggestions of what we should do with this behavior? It seems kinda lonely and sad. I think this has to due with being separated from her sibling, but I, and my family, are at a loss at what to do. If anyone has any ideas throw them out. I'd appreciate it.

20090202205210AAa6eQM	Pets;Dogs	Im dog training! please.. please HELP!?	Please help me! i recently adopted a 3 month old Pure breed American Bull dog. We have almost had her for a full week. She is impossible on a leash chews up everything ( as we speak she is chewing on my mouse cord), She pees everywhere but outside. She is reversed potty trained, she will only pee inside. Im not exactly sure if its because i have another dog sent in my house, but she refuses to pee outside. This morning i took her on a beautiful 2 mile walk through the park. She did not potty once, the whole entire time. 30 seconds after walking in the house, she peed right in the middle of the floor. I am in the process of crate training, but she cries non-stop. If we ignore her she will continue to get louder and louder. Today when i came home from work, she had tore her metal crate apart and went potty all over my house and chewed up my coach purse. Please help! she is a very sweet girl, and we would love to keep her in our family and continue spoiling her. We understand she is a puppy, but she is not making any progress!  i am out of options... and am currently running out of couch cushions for her to chew on. We do not believe in physical discipline. Whenever she is doing something that is not wanted, We correct her by giving her a firm no. Whenever we give her a firm no and correct the action she gets very excited and it seems like she does not understand she is doing anything wrong! If anyone has any advise. I would GREATLY appreciate it.  I am desperate!

I have a saltwater aquarium that has been cycling for a while, did regular water changes, have had the water checked for all levels at the pet store and by myself and everything is good. I have a crab and two snails that are seemingly fine, had a clownfish that died, and now have a damsel that is not doing well. The fish seem to be sitting at the bottom of the tank with labored breathing. I did originally set up the aquarium with tap water and tap water conditioner and used a salt mix that could be the problem maybe metals... PLEASE DON'T TELL ME SALINITY BECAUSE IT IS PERFECT. I have two powerheads for the 55 gallon tank, no power head going, a freshwater filter...hang over the back kind (i think this might be the problem maybe too), salinity is fine, good oxygen flow and even a grounding probe as the people at the aquatics store think this could be the only thing left that could be the problem. My last 2 assumptions are that it could be heavy metals in the water or the filter is releasing something...I was considering doing a HUGE water change in an effort to save the fish...like 80% water change and then another 50% water change the next day. I do have some green stuff growing on the bottom of my sand, not sure what this could be...also I have roughly 35lbs of live rock and some live sand mixed in there. Any input would be helpful...

20090202210509AAnD9bU	Pets;Dogs	My dogs ate lots of candy and other things...are they gonna be okay?	My sister had left a stack of candy on the table and my dogs jumped up and ate it.  That night they were fed some dinner and threw it up.  It wasn't their real food, so we thought it was just something else.  Then the next morning they wouldn't eat their food and I had to hand feed them (I didn't realize they were sick then and probably shouldn't eat).  Later that day, my mom came home and thought they were fine, but later, they started vomiting and having bad diarrhea.  We took them to the vet and they are on medication and have stopped throwing up.  They are on an IV...do you think they'll be okay? I'm a little worried right now....
20090202210752AAdaIDe	Pets;Cats	Why does this cat...?	My mom in law's favorite cat spends most of the day with her and sleeps on her bed and every night he runs his paws on her chest or arm (he's declawed) as if he were making dough... is there a reason for him doing this? We're just curious. Thank you in advance.
20090202210821AAD8kDu	Pets;Reptiles	Can i use solely a heat pad for my reptile enclosure?	I just bought a heat pad today.      I will be getting a ball python soon and i keep hearing good and bad things about heat pads. I hear that a lamp is better to so the snake doesn't burrow under the substrate and get burned by the heat pad though the glass.  I also keep getting told at pet stores that i should have both a heat pad and a heating lamp, but i suspect that they might just be trying to sell me things i don't need.      I'm thinking I will probably buy a lamp after the heat pad burns out because i would feel better throwing out a light bulb than a whole heat pad (ouch my environment).      Has anyone raised a happy healthy snake with just a heat pad as the heat source?   Should i return this heat pad and get a lamp instead?   And also, I had a choice between a 'rainforest' heat pad (cheaper and produced less heat) and a 'desert' heat pad. Is there a big difference? I ran with the cheaper one.
20090202211029AAkhSpj	Pets;Cats	HELP ME !!!!!!!! Please !!!! About my kitten that I found today.... ?	I found this cat, who was from a home that didn't seem very good. He was very scared when I first met him and now  he seems calm and maybe less frightened.... I have him sitting in my other cats' bed ( he never used it) and every time I look ( maybe every so often) I see that he is breathing really fast.....  Do little kittens have a faster heartbeat than older cats?       PLEASE let me know!!!!!!!! I'm just a little worried for him, but I hope to give him a good home.

20090202213203AASslEd	Pets;Horses	I just don't understand...?	So I have wanted a horse basically my whole life.  I never was able to get one because we never had much money. I now have $500 dollars saved up and get $80 a month from my parents. I want to lease a horse now. It is $100 a month. I have more than enough to lease the horse.    For some reason, my parents still do not approve of leasing a horse.   The first reason it was a no was because of the money. I have solved that issue. Now, they say the don't want to drive me there 3-4 times a week. My mom only works part-time and is home before I get home from school, so I know she has time to take me. Also, the place is only 5 minutes away. I feel like there is a reason they don't want me to lease a horse, and their not telling me.   I'm sure its not because I could get hurt because I use to take lessons, and they always let me go on trail rides.   Do you have any ideas why they will not let my lease a horse?   Also, do you have an ideas on convincing them? I've worked my whole life trying to make them understand how much I love horses, but they still don't get it. When I talk to them about it, they just stop the conversation and think of it as a joke.    Help?
