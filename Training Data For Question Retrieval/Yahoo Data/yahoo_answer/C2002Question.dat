20081001162007AAnhOqj	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	What should I do with my xbox 360 which had a red ring of death but is now gone? ?	I got the red ring a few weeks ago and tried multiple times to see if it was just a fluke it showed up consistently for two days. So I decided to get a replacement and just today received my box. However when I checked the 360 again, it was just fine. I'm dunno what to do since I'm fairly certain the red ring will come back but if I send it in they won't believe me right now since its green lights. Also it says I only have 20 days to send it in. WIll i be able to request a box again even though my problem is sorta gone now.

20081225182331AAhbq0g	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Leather, Silicon, or Plastic case for iPod?!?	Plastic: I don't want to get this because I might drop it, and then it'll crack. But I also kinda want to also because it has cool designs and you can see the true color of my iPod.      Silicon: I like how it won't damage (unlike the plastic) but I don't know what color I want because my ipod is the iPod Chromatic in Green. If I get white (or any color) then it gets a bit fuzzied out and you can't see the real color of the iPod      Leather: I like how it is but I still want to keep my iPod the size it is, and the leather might make it a little bit bigger.       This is my iPod:  http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/  (in green)      Which case was better for you, which should i get?

It works well and I love the Ipod itself but Itunes has given me many heartaches. At one point I had 6000 songs on my ipod and I plugged it in receiving the message "Ipod must reformat." an error of some sort. I was extremely angry that it auto-deleted all of my songs. It took me a year to rebuild my library of deleted songs. My Ipod now has 8000 songs and I am afraid that if i plug it in the very same thing will happen. IT HAS HAPPENED 7 times!!!!!!!!!!  The same thing to my friends Ipod!!!!!!!!!!!   PLEASE ANY HELP OR INSIGHT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. ARE THERE ANY OTHER SOFTWARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF RUNNING MY IPOD WITHOUT THESE ERRORS?
