20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	It's a great idea to buy local products because it results in a lower carbon footprint, it helps the local economy, and in the case of food, you get fresher and better tasting stuff (and often cheaper).   These are the reasons I shop at my local farmers market every weekend.|`|1b91ce32a95b13a1e9f83fdedfcea4f9aa	Anytime you can buy local products you win, for the most part. Food will be fresher and you support the local industry and economy. Less transportation means less fuel and less pollution.|`|AA11932246	Efficiency is better served by having products produced where they can be manufactured the cheapest and that does typically mean that you're better off having food produced on the other side of the world.<br>  <br>  Of course transportation costs have to be factored into it as well but we can have cheap transportation (and cheap transportation does help a lot in terms of lowering cost, you do not want transport to be expensive).<br>  <br>  From an environmental effects of transport point of view there is significant and easy to get room for improvement in shipping (switching the ships to nuclear power) and railroads (electrify the lines (requires clean electricity, Sweden is doing well there though)) which can carry anything that isn't too time sensitive, air freight is a bit of a niche market compared to ships, trains and trucks although it's going to be quite hard to reduce the CO2 emissions from aircraft since there's really no alternative to kerosene (not avgas, pretty much everything that carries cargo burns Jet A, avgas is only really used for GA these days) and current planes are already pretty efficient with no really big improvements possible, trucks whilst they do long distance cargo are probably better used on shorter distances to bring something that came by ship, train or plane to the final destination.<br>  <br>  The lower productivity you might get in a lot of places would probably cause more negative environmental effects than growing food in a place that is suited to that food and then transporting it with what we have now (not what we could have).<br>  <br>  As for the famines, they won't actually happen (the limits to growth that people have claimed to find for the near future turn out to not be limits, but merely a lack of imagination, we have the technology to transcend the limits that are claimed to do us in soon, we just need to be allowed to use it (when we really need it, that'll happen, Sweden recently took steps to allow one of them)).|`|TK6YJdWtaa	I guess it depends on your reason for buying things. Economically it might be cheaper to produce things in eg China, but environmentally it's not necessarily better. <br>  - To reduce wasting energy in transport buy local food. If you can't resist bananas, buy organic African ones and not those from Ecuador, they have less way to travel. If the more energy efficient fridge comes from, say Germany instead Sweden, and you are in Sweden, it might be more environmentally friendly to buy the German fridge. It depends on what you buy.<br>  - Buy second hand, that reduces the amount of resources and energy needed. <br>  - Buy only what you need, do you really need a third tv or a new mobile because the last year model is "old"? Everything you buy has to be "build" and transported. If you don't buy it, it doesn't. And the old stuff needs to go somewhere too, sell it, other people might be able to use it, donate it, put it into recycle. It's no good in the landfill!<br>  - Buy fair-trade and organic as much as you can, that's more ethical and environmentally friendly. <br>  - Be more aware of your impact. Where do things come from, what are they made of, can it be recycled, do I need it in the first place, do the people producing it get fair pay?<br>  <br>  Of course everything you buy or do has an impact, but there are ways to reduce that impact,that's the goal :-) And the money you save by not buying the new tv you can spend on art, sport, concerts, a beer with friends, pizza with friends, a new tree in the garden, piano lessons......<br>  <br>  About the famine: as far as I remember, Meadows was saying that famine will struck the developing countries first because of the social and environmentally impact of lots of people with no money concentrated in one area. They will run out of clean drinking water eventually, and the amount of good soil is getting less in those areas as well. It does not necessarily mean that there will be famine in Sweden or Europe, but we will definitely feel some consequences. <br>  To the lack of imagination: yes we create new technologies, but if you can't afford the fancy new technology it's worth nothing for you! There will be social and environmental problems because of our consumption especially in developing countries but also world-wide and we should try to keep them as small as possible.|`|d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	It is always a good idea to support your local growers.

D9XHRMTDaa	Hello, I am eighteen and know exactly what you're going through. First you need priorities. My priorities were security, economical, and being clean. My parents also had no objections of me moving out, so when I found an apartment they cosigned until I had enough credit. No matter what your priorities, these steps will surely help.<br>  <br>  First, prepare your resume, if you have no prior work experience you'll need to pretend that your high school experiences is your job experience. If you have no prior work experience and no grades that will dazzle your people. It's probably going to be a hard run for you. If you have a job, still prepare your resume. You never know what might happen.<br>  <br>  Second, you need to figure out the cost of living in the area you want to live in. Cities are normally high rent, coastal areas too. Those areas that are not high rent are usually bad company, shop around and see what the neighborhood looks like. If you're going to college then look for one close by. I was lucky enough to find an apartment for me and my boyfriend, two bedroom fully furnished kitchen two bath and a living space for 600 dollars a month and a single was nearby for half as much. You may not be as lucky depending on where you live.<br>  <br>  Third, if you live in a bad neighborhood, be bad. Although the apartments were nice, the reason they were so cheap (I live in a beach town) was because they were in the "bad" part of town. A lot of drug dealers and people hard on their luck would hang around the area at night and there were a lot of break in's. I splurged and bought a safe for my jewelry and my boyfriend bought a gun with blanks in it. We also kept the door locked at all times and had no "back ways" into our apartment. <br>  <br>  Fourth, look for things now. I went to garage sales and picked up furniture and things from the streets, for my birthday and Christmas I asked for pots and pans and things I would need to cook and clean and live in the new apartment, this was the most fun for me but you can't let yourself get carried away. There is only so much a person needs before things turn into "junk"<br>  <br>  Fifth, this may not apply to you, but it did for me, I communicated the need to my parents for space and talked to my landlord about money. We managed to get a little support from my family and the landlord who agreed to let us work for compensation of some of the rent(50 dollars per month). This helped the landlord out because he didn't have to hire someone to clean up the lawn take the trash out and sort the mail. It helped the residents because they didn't have to form one of those housing committee things. It also helped improve the value of the apartment building as when my boyfriend and I decided to move after out renting contract expired the rent went up one hundred dollars. <br>  <br>  It helps to have a roommate or people who'd like to room with you that you trust and know. Below I have included a source that I would use. I wish i could include a checklist but these things differ from person to person and most internet sources are at best, unreliable. Best of luck!|`|K5IOSGXAaa	LOL Save every penny, you will need it. And you best be calling places you think you are going to rent, because they may not rent to an 18 year old. Good luck !

The 'go-green' agenda operates on the same basis but is a little easier to understand.   Who's to say that there has been time to adequately test all the theories and present proper opinions?  Or do they just skim the data, check the math and sign it instead?<br>  <br>  Science that says man is responsible for global warming is as questionable as science that says it can cure the common cold.  However, what makes the global warming science suspicious is that there can be no debate whereas other sciences welcome it to properly reach conclusions.

The Earth is typically warmer than it is now and sea levels are typically higher than they are now.  Many questions exist about the cause of the current climatic change such as:<br>  1.  Is it a natural part of the Earth's cycles?<br>  2.  Are mans introduction of greenhouse gases accelerating natural cycles or are they causing the shift on their own?<br>  3.  Since the temperature change has been slight thus far, is it simply a natural fluctuation?<br>  4.  How rapidly do natural climate changes occur?<br>  <br>  These are the types of questions that simply can't be answered in a matter of months as some people would like to think.  Geologic processes occur over a period of thousands or millions of years.  Some believe that we are still in a period of the last ice age and are only experiencing a warm period of it.  If that is true you can certainly expect things to warm and for sea level to rise.  That is the reason why you can find marine fossils in places like West Virginia.  Some others believe we may slip back into another ice age.  If that is true then you can expect to buy more winter clothes.<br>  <br>  There is not a single soul on this planet that knows the answer to the global warming issue or if it is even really taking place.  My opinion of course is to air on the side of caution and think that making strides to clean things up is always good.|`|6Gfz125Paa	The scientists have stuck to the scientific method.

I've read about building insulation made out of recycled jeans (on a company level) and bought office folders made out of recycled jeans as well. (There is paper made out of cotton, so I suppose lots of paper/cardboard materials could have recycled fabric fibers incorporated into them and either utilize the preexisting colors--textiles would have to be sorted by color before destruction--or be something where color doesn't matter much--like a plain ole cardboard box.)

More than 1/3 of the original group of scientists who originally signed the IPPC Statement have since asked to be removed from the list - most of this group (80%) were not trained in climate scientific disciplines and should not have been asked to sign the IPPC statement as experts on the science.  The statement they signed was changed and editied almost past recognition AFTER THEY SIGNED IT!  The entire issue is false - Not 1 proponent of AGW, not 1 expert on manmade warming - will agree to debate the hundreds of skeptic experts who have posted numerous offers and even challenges for an open forum debate!  In March thousands of climate scientists will meet in New York to show their "Skeptic" solidarity and try to further destroy the AGW Hoax - this is many more than were originally "tricked" into signing the IPPC - I predict the major newspapers will find some other news to cover in another shameful attempt to keep the idea alive that the skeptic view is the minority when it is the overwhelming majority - LIKE THEY DID LAST YEAR!!!|`|AA10591818	Yes I do, also I believe that the world media is keeping this hoax alive by playing on the fears of the general population.  Scientists are admitting that global warming is not happening, the earth is just going through a normal change.  The volcanoes around the world pump more gasses into the atmosphere in one day than man has in his entire existence.  Go figure.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Yes, of course. <br>  <br>  Try walking into a scientific conference and saying that global warming isn't real.  You'll be unanimously laughed at.|`|4d8923629944072027bbc12052c6a2e3aa	Yes, politically the dems are all in agreement and even some repugs,<br>  <br>  This is the Dem equivalent of the War on Terror.<br>  <br>  Scientifically the opinion is much different.|`|1SvJJFmfaa	yeah. In other countries with different politics and policies, there is not much debate about if it's lethally worsened by humans or not. They of course agree that it is, although they might not always be capable of facing the full seriousness of the global warming. And this is not to say that they aren't informed about stuff that proposes global warming to be a conspiracy or a scam. They totally laugh at this kind of speech in well-educated Nordic welfare countries|`|DIBo12zjaa	Quite frankly, the more it's applauded the less real it becomes. Different countries are using it as a crux to sway opinion and foreign aid. While others such as China have found lucrative loop holes in the C trade business. <br>  Everyone seems to have forgotten the science except for promotional reasons. The worse part; "it's just started."<br>  <br>  ed: Hey! don't blame me...you ask the question.|`|sSvPEf97aa	Of course.  One is more likely to believe it's real the further left they are on the political spectrum.<br>  <br>  This alone is proof that so-called "Global Warming" is political, and has nothing to do with valid scientific research.|`|RjUWPz5daa	Yes, very much so.|`|AA11932246	Yes.<br>  <br>  Within the scientific community there is almost unanimous agreement that global warming is happening and caused by us, there's very little controversy over such basic issues as whether it's happening or what is causing it (although there's quite a bit of debate about what the effects will be).<br>  <br>  But those who deny that global warming is happening or that deny that humans are the cause have been able to get media attention out of proportion to their numbers or the quality of their arguments.|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	In a nutshell Global warming is a massive scam. Its made alot of people wealthier and more powerful. However within the real Science community it has been debunked time and again.

In the scientific community there truly is no debate over what's causing global warming.|`|24072a527355deb8895a64a72f7622f1aa	I am convinced of it,  The real science shows that it is naturally occuring and not man made,  This is one way for polititans to gain control.   They pass laws that take away basic freedoms, like our right to choose the type of light bulb we buy, they do it in the name of saving the planet, then we are fall for it. They start with little things like lightbulbs, then they hike up gas prices, before we know it we won't be able to afford to live, then they will pay our bills for us.<br>  <br>  Al Gore is no scientist- he is a has been politian, when did he become an expert on this stuff anyway?|`|NqGkbDetaa	Absolutely!!

When we have hypocrite politicians like Pelosi, Obama and Al Gore telling me I have to reduce my Carbon footprint, but they live in HUGE houses and take personal flights to meetings everyday it kind of puts it all into perspective for me.  The whole carbon footprint idea is a total scam to make these idiots rich.  A wise thing to do is just follow the money generated by such plans to see who's on the other side waiting to cash in.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  JIM Z you are So right on.  I too own my own house and have replaced all of my windows, insulated my attic,  replaced my roof and I even use those sucky pig tail light bulbs.

(btw I'm not suggesting other Finns are like me)<br>  -first and foremost refuse to take the plane, and take the train/boat instead, if I'm not feeling too poor. Minimize travel and move to foreign countries rather permanently, since I really enjoy experiencing them. First I read a lot before I go, and sometimes I think I know already enough my reading, as if I had experienced it already<br>  -sold my car and cycle a lot. I do my driving in GTAIV on Xbox360 instead<br>  - have lived solely on local Finnish vegatarian food that is not grown in a greenhouse e.g. porridge (although there isn't a great variety as it's too damn cold) and had a meal with locally produced chicken meat in it once a week to avoid buying all the foreign stuff that's supposed to complete your vegetarian diet. Nowadays most of the time I just can't resist a piece of good foreign food regardless of does it have meat or not (reduces carbon as foreign goods need to be brought into the country by some carbon consuming means)<br>  -let what I know spread on the web and among acquaintances sometimes<br>  -decided not to have babies in our overpopulated world, thought it's enough for me to help out my single mom acquaintances every now and then<br>  -preferred to spent my free time in public places, doing my studies on public computers<br>  -tried not to buy new clothes or buy anything at all except food and condoms and tickets to places to connect with women<br>  etc. <br>  <br>  However, my philosophy is not to do anything that feels to require too much work in order to curb climate change. <br>  I truly don't want to make people get too alarmed about famines and other disasters, things come in degrees and it's best we don't get too scared or try to overdo minimizing our individual impact on climate change. It's not supposed to consume all your thoughts and energy as every psychologist would agree. It's not healthy.

I38WF5aFaa	I work on several houses that are off the grid.  Start by buying land.  Land without access to the grid is much less expensive than land on the grid.  <br>  Dig an outhouse. <br>  Dig or drill a well,  if your property has a spring that's even better.   <br>  Get the biggest bulk propane tank you can.  You will want a propane refrigerator,  propane lights and a propane heater.  The heater is a backup for your wood stove.  A generator is nice to have.  Its expensive to run.  Photovoltiacs with a battery storage system is the ultimate but if its only for a couple years it won't be worth the money.  <br>  <br>  If you want to drop out of society you should learn to grow your own food.  A garden doesn't take much skill,  just a lot of work if its to be your primary food source.  You can raise your own meat.  The easiest animals to raise are poultry,  rabbits and pigs.  <br>  <br>  None of my clients live off the grid. The places I work on are vacation properties.  Any one of them could be a primary residence but it is not practical for most people.|`|1oj4aamaaa	Go to Prague for awhile.

NqGkbDetaa	What Global Warming....???  The Earth is currently in a Cooling cycle.|`|fwnqB0dTaa	At present AGW isn't affecting any country to a great extent, at least not as much as natural weather cycles.<br>  <br>  Those that will be affected first are the low lying ones that will be hit by rising sea levels, but that is centuries in the future, not the years that alarmists are claiming.<br>  <br>  PS: Nice to see that the denier trend of refusing to answer a question, and just posting that it isn't happening, continues.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I'm not too sure about the comment about the Maldives. They are coral islands, and some are actually rising due to coral growth. This may reverse though if the seas get more acidic, due to absorbing more and more CO2 as the air gets more heavily laden with it.<br>  <br>  EDIT 2: Some countries affected may be Belgium, and surrounding low lying countries and parts of the UK, specifically East Anglia and the area around London. Basically any low lying  coastal regions prone to flooding.<br>  <br>  As for China, currently it is more of a danger in causing AGW, due to building massive numbers of coal fired power stations, than it is of being affected by it. India is another example of a country that is vastly increasing the pollutants it is pumping into the air, and it is more at risk than China, especially the area around the Ganges delta.|`|pnZssBg9aa	The Maldives would be one.<br>  The Netherlands another.
