AA11134471	1. The best way to handle overwriting the IP address in your example is to fill the address with 0's. Example, the IP address is 192.168.100.102 (15 bytes) and you need to overwrite it with 192.168.1.10. write out 192.168.001.010 instead so it has the same number of bytes. Otherwise you would have to re write the whole file.<br>  <br>  2. Never used it, and if I did I didnt know it.|`|FBQZ06vraa	Any string in any language has to carry its length with it.  In almost all C and C++ strings, this is done by terminating the actual string with a zero-byte (binary zero, not a zero character '0').  If you have fifteen characters allocated, there's probably a sixteenth to hold the zero-byte, however, putting a shorter string inside the fifteen bytes and terminating that with a zero-byte will force C or C++ to ignore the rest of the physical space.<br>  <br>  I have never heard of Big O.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

But I guess you just look for a Windows laptop. You can find many around that price. But you should ask yourself the following question before buying it: what do you need it for?<br>  <br>  -> for school only : get the Asus PC EEE 9" screen, that can load Vista OS and is a super tiny cheap laptop that has a valid webcam and internet connection. It's perfect for messaging / skype / internet and super easy to carry around.  <br>  <br>  -> for gaming / 3D / SecondLife : you need a good RAM, min.1G (2G would be perfect) and a good graphic card (Nvidia 8400 for ex.), but the price gets higher and it's difficult you get one lappies like this for max 500$. <br>  <br>  If you don't choose the Asus PC EEE, I advice you to anyway look at a PC with a good RAM (1G is better with Vista) and the min. requirements: wi/fi, webcam/ min.2 usb 2.0 ports/ speakers. And if you plan on using the laptop pad more than the mouse then TRY the laptop before.. I got mine, it runs perfect and all, but has a terrible touch pad, very uncomfortable to use.. the only thing I didn't check before buying it. <br>  <br>  Good luck with it! remember the computer is personal.. so the last choice is always yours, depending on what you're planning to use it for.<br>  <br>  p.s. oeps ...

Anybody can register a domain or buy an existing one. You must give basic contact information, name, address, phone #, and an email address. There is often an option of keeping this private for a few bucks more per year. Even with the privacy option it should never cost more than $30 per year, and you can get it for even less if you shop around. If you choose to to keep your contact info private it's no big deal, but spammers can pick off the email address. I suggest using a secondary email address.|`|L1jrlQSMaa	if you are planing transfering to butter server or domain. use the 502 server it lot faster but i think you have to pay fees for it.|`|AA11779483	the CURRENT OWNER of a domain should be the only one who can authorize its transfer.

JGBhN6FUaa	First of all, do not confuse programming language with program. C++ is a programming language, which lets you write programs. C++ is what we call a "high-level" language. This means that in order for it's code to be executed in a CPU, it must be translate to "machine code". In order to do this, you must first compile your code (to check for errors), then assemble it. Assembling means translating your high-level language code into assembly code. (Assembly is a low-level programming language that allows you to manipulate the registers in your memory directly) The assembly code is then translated to machine code (Hexadecimal sets of digits representing Binary code -> 0's and 1's). Machine code is stored as bytes and a single logical operation contains a number of bytes. At the beginning of each set of bytes there is a header indicating what operation to execute, then there will be addresses on which to perform this operation. This is a rather advanced topic, so I provided a brief summary.

The hard drive was likely corrupted, which means that the files couldn't be recovered (without some serious professional assistance), and this is something that Dell doesn't do for their customers. This is why backing up your files is always important -- you never know when your computer will fail on you.

zorYTX59aa	If YouTube is slow, stuck or weird, and people suggest you<br>  either change, install or get stuff....DON'T TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  Please don’t tinker with your "Java Scripts", "Flash Players"<br>  or different browsers -- and definitely stay away from any of<br>  the software that salespeople (disguised as answerers here<br>  on Yahoo) are trying to sucker you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you because I am pretty sure <br>  your computer and YouTube was working fine before, right?<br>  The first rule of thumb and ideal option should always try to<br>  be: DON'T disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, <br>  add, change or install anything. Matters will only get worse.<br>  <br>  Several times each day, YouTube shuts down a few of their <br>  servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck<br>  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer<br>  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time. <br>  That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios: <br>  bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish<br>  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the<br>  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few <br>  hours or by the next day.<br>  <br>  If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,<br>  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to<br>  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result <br>  being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to <br>  a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way; <br>  or C) never even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever<br>  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in <br>  a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them once and for all. <br>  Thus, exit out of YouTube, then clear your "cache" of all its<br>  "temporary internet files", "cookies" and "history". It is best<br>  if you shutdown and reboot afterwards. You'll be amazed at <br>  how "fresh" and "new" your YouTube will be.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you are using Google Web Accelerator or a utility<br>  similar to that: Dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall <br>  it. Do all that you can to get as far away from it as possible,<br>  even though this seemingly contradicts all my advice which<br>  I wrote uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking "Don't <br>  Accelerate This Website" will not help you whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is: "Despite the fact that you can't watch or access <br>  videos properly, buy our downloader." [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com" <br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: depending on how your YouTube account is set up,<br>  your personal "video playblack quality" (or "VPQ") could be<br>  set to "dynamically" or "fast", thus making YouTube videos<br>  play at higher quality. This in turn eats up lots of bandwidth,<br>  memory and "cache". If you are "logged on" to YouTube as <br>  you're reading this, you can verify your VPQ from right here <br>  within Yahoo!Answers by clicking my link below, which will <br>  bring you directly to "YOUR VERY OWN" playback setting:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/account#playback/quality" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/account#playback/...</a><br>  Otherwise, if you must "sign in" first, click on the 4th black<br>  option which will be on the left side called "Playback Setup".<br>  <br>  Note 5: nothing about playing YouTube has changed in the<br>  past year. If anything, the newer Flash players are causing<br>  many YouTubers plenty of grief -- especially all 5 variations <br>  of version 10. It is absolutely crazy that there is a 10.0.525, <br>  10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54, and 10.12.36. Updates are only<br>  good for one thing: software/computer conflicts. Myself, I've <br>  never strayed away from 9.47, and many flashers swear by <br>  9.45.

1f1c11ceebb9956bc1f3ee72b5c57bebaa	Its used to be able to display high quality video from your pc on a compatible HDMI TV|`|dC7d5sy5aa	HDMI means a simpler and higher-quality entertainment experience. It provides the highest possible uncompressed video and audio quality over a thin, easy-to-use cable with a simple, consumer-friendly connector. It’s also backwards compatible with DVI, requiring only a simple passive adaptor or cable to connect between the two interfaces. <br>  Most importantly, it adds support for up to 8 channels of full-resolution digital audio, all on a single cable. HDMI has the ability to transmit basic control codes from device to device, making the goal of system integration easier to achieve. <br>  HDMI addresses the complexity issue by both reducing the cable count and easing the process of interconnecting the various devices that make up the typical home entertainment system. Instead of having to choose among RF, composite video, S-video and component video and optical digital audio or coax-based digital audio, everything can use a single HDMI connection. For example, in the case of a DVD Audio or SACD Audio capable DVD player, a single HDMI cable can replace up to 10 other connections (3 for analog component video, 1 for optical or coax digital audio and 6 for the 5.1 multichannel analog audio outputs). <br>  Added to this is the ability to simultaneously achieve the best possible audio and video quality due to the uncompressed all digital signaling of HDMI.<br>  <br>  The most recent version of HDMI, more than doubles the bandwidth of the signaling from 4.95 gigabits per second to 10.2 gigabits per second. This increase in bandwidth enables greater color depths, higher screen resolutions and faster refresh rates. It supports the new xvYCC color space, adds support for the Dolby ? TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio standards, provides a mini-connector for use with camcorders and digital still cameras, and supports the ability to automatically and accurately adjust the audio to maintain lipsync with the video image. <br>  <br>  Quality:<br>  Because HDMI is a digital interface, it provides the best quality video since there are no lossy analog to digital conversions that are required for analogue connections (such as component or S-video). The difference is especially noticeable at higher resolutions such as 1080p. Digital video will be sharper than component, and eliminates the softness and ghosting found with composite. Small, high contrast details such as text bring this difference out the most.<br>  <br>  Ease-of-use:<br>  HDMI combines video and multi-channel audio into a single cable, eliminating the cost, complexity, and confusion of multiple cables currently used in A/V systems. This is particularly beneficial when equipment is being upgraded or added.<br>  <br>  Intelligence:<br>  HDMI supports two-way communication between the video source (such as a DVD player) and the DTV, enabling new functionality such as automatic configuration and one-touch play. By using HDMI, devices automatically deliver the most effective format (e.g. 480p vs. 720p, 16:9 vs. 4:3) for the display that it is connected - eliminating the need for the consumer to scroll through all the format options guessing what will look best.<br>  <br>  HD Content-Ready: <br>  HDMI devices supporting HDCP (copy protection) will have access to premium HD content now and in the future.|`|2jXkITUMaa	to connect to a HDMI port on a tv so you can see your small screen on the big screen.

Watching movies scence by scene, first at normal speed, then in slow can help you spot things like micro expressions etc. Even actors can't hide their emotions all the time.<br>  <br>  Also your friends. Actually, maybe you have better friends than I had...but most of my so called friends are extremely manipulative. I have known this for a while.

LF2oShTLaa	Try going into -Control Panel- System -Advanced Settings- Start-up & Recovery settings - Turn off/Un-check under system failure, automatically restart. Now check and see if the computer reboots again. Now it wont auto restart, this will figure if its a system error or not. If it is a system error usually it tells you on a screen usually the BSOD however if auto restart is on that screen is shown for a split second if at all. <br>  <br>  Second you can check windows error log:<br>  Control panel, Administrative tools, event viewer. This will give you a log of everything that goes on for your computer. Usually you wanna check under -Windows Logs- Application, since this seems to be related to those programs you have listed above. Now try and find around the date and time of the reboot, which should be indicated as an error. If so, just double click the error, or listing and it should give you a report and an error code number, which you can then google and find solutions if this didn't help as much as needed.

zorYTX59aa	If you are telling us your sound works fine but not YouTube,<br>  then I am sure the following is not your problem or solution:<br>  -- you might have turned the volume down<br>  -- you might have muted it before<br>  -- a cookie might have kept it that way<br>  -- it could be due to slow connection<br>  -- it could be due to high traffic<br>  -- try watching it during off peak hours<br>  -- solution: buy their downloader ?!?<br>  By the way, 'cookies' are tiny files that websites plunk onto <br>  your computer about your viewing preferences, such as the<br>  features that you have enabled on your YouTube homepage. <br>  Cookies do not affect sound whatsoever.<br>  <br>  I see questions similar to yours every few days on Y!A now,<br>  so I recently did a whole lot of Googling, searching, reading <br>  -- going through dozens of discussion forums and websites <br>  only to realize that there are no definitive answers out there. <br>  <br>  The only semblance of a "part solution" that kind of worked<br>  for a few people would require you to either:<br>  1 -- fool around with your "registry" (which I would be totally <br>  deadset against because that could really screw things up); <br>  2 -- download some utilities (which I would be just as much<br>  against, because that kind of stuff is what probably created<br>  your problem in the first place).<br>  <br>  Thus, my first piece of advice to you: shutdown then reboot.<br>  If that doesn't work, this is what I advise many other people<br>  when YouTube is slow, stuck or weird:....Clear your "cache"<br>  of all your "Temporary Internet Files".

If you've got "Google Web Accelerator" or anything similar,<br>  uninstall it immediately. GWA destroys YouTube.<br>  <br>  ? Long videos require both "Flash" and "Shockwave" to play<br>  properly. Shockwave includes Flash, but not vice versa.<br>  <br>  ? The most recent versions of Flash are regularly frustrating<br>  a lot of YouTubers. Most updates are typically good for only <br>  1 thing: potential software conflicts. If you are using 1 of the <br>  5 different versions of version 10 (yes -- there actually are 5), <br>  you may want to consider this other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  ?

If it's just for typing papers surfing the internet and the occasional music then just go for a dell no need in spending 2 times the amount.  Otherwise go with a mac. I would stay away from the new slim macs because the hardware isn't the best and if you drop it your pretty much screwed since there isn't much protection. For a dell go with a latitue/xps/ or studio series. I work at the IT department for a college and these are the types we have the LEAST amount of hardware problems on.

gVhGZzgKaa	I'd love to generically answer your question, but there is no generic response. Note that the faster you go on a network the more chances of data collision you will receive when on an ethernet network. Also, you are limited by several factors, so when you say "fast" it isn't always true. You will be limited by the speed of the NICs. For instance, let's say that you have 1000 mbps for your NIC. Once your traffic leaves and gets through your gateway (router) you will be down to the speed that you have as far as wiring is outside your house. Unless you're on gigabit through the pipe and out to your ISP you won't have the slightest amount of speed increase. Basically, if you don't have fiber you're forced to go slow. If you want to use 1000 mbps for a peer to peer network inside your house then you're fine. You'll be able to download and upload files to your personal computers with lightning speed. Once it leaves the gateway you're slow, though. Next, there are broadband modems that have routers, even wireless routers, built into them. If you want to have separate devices for your modem and router; then any generic cable modem will do just fine. Which router you get will depend on the size of your house. 802.11N is currently the fastest wireless router there is, but you will get an increased range with N mimo. I personally would go with 802.11 N simply because of the fact that it gives a further range than 802.11 G. In response to question number 3, why would you want a modem with a wireless router and then put an additional router on the network? It wouldn't make much sense to do that unless you were subnetting a large network and spanning a WAN via a serial cable. Again, remember that the more devices you have on your network, the more traffic is going out at once and the greater the chance of collision. I sure hope this helped because my fingers are getting tired.

ZG6DeAzPaa	Well, the newest version of Adobe Flash is going to cost 700 bucks. I have never met someone who buys it at this price. The absolute best thing to do is to get it from your school. It is usually only colleges that do this, though. <br>  <br>  So you either have some waiting to do... or waste a tremendous amount of money to waste. It is unfortunate that Adobe makes it impossible for young people like yourself to get into Flash without being extremely wealthy. <br>  <br>  There are illegal alternatives, which I do not advocate. I have just *heard* they exist. Good luck.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	In order to learn flash, you're going to have to learn programming.

I don't think Adobe has licensed their animator or their format out to anyone else really. I'm sure you can search around but ya, Adobe is extremely prestigious  and I would get it from them if possible.<br>  <br>  The Flash animator will be pricy, since adobe makes professional grade stuff. If you can somehow get educational pricing then that would be great. Educational pricing requires certain documentation to show you are using it for school curriculum. Talk to one of your art teachers (13... your in highschool right?) and see if they can help you (however this is pretty unlikely).<br>  <br>  But ya, I think $500 would cover the cost of it.

So thats normal but if you have a virus use Hijackthis from download.com or spybot to check if you have a virus. Also, McAfee does absolutely nothing. They barely find any viruses and when they do they can't delete them. They just quarantine them which does not work. So get spybot search and destroy or AVG ecen though the other guy said it stinks. The current one works very very well. But it makes your PC kinda slow. But it works. If you get any popups saying your privacy is in danger contact me or any other virus related thing this usually happens in trojan vundo or smitfraud which are some really terrible viruses i had in the past. Feel free to ask any questions. I am a pro in security and hardware. NEVER DOWNLOAD ANYTHING IF IT SAYS FREE!!!!!!!!!!!! FREE MEANS VIRUSES. THATS WHAT YOU GET 4 FREE!!

For each control which has focus you may have different keyboard event handlers.  A grid may offer cell-navigation whereas a textbox may move the caret.<br>  <br>  Most toolbox controls come with events like KeyDown and KeyUp.  You can easily attach an event handler to these existing events in Visual Studio by using a syntax similar to:  control.KeyUp += new [SomeEventHandlerType](YourEventHandlerN...<br>  <br>  and then your event handler can use its event args to determine what key was pressed and how to act accordingly.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=keyboard+event+handlers" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.ca/search?q=keyboard+e...</a> offers many possible solutions<br>  <br>  a pseudo-code event handler may look like this:<br>  <br>  private overrides void TextBoxKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs args){<br>  <br>       switch(args.KeyCode){<br>            case(Keys.LeftArrow):<br>               //do something based on left arrow;<br>           brea;<br>        }<br>  }|`|KjYwItdIaa	What OS?

Also make sure you disable system restore in windows so the windows restore partition gets scanned by the virus scanner or else windows won't let your virus scanner remove any viruses found in the restore partition. Also you can try running AVG in Safe Mode so certain viruses that start when windows loads all drivers in regular mode may not get loaded in Safe Mode.

You could revert back to a previous saved setting if you have done that. If you have no clue what I am talking about, you probably didnt do it prior to this issue happening. My best bet would be to take the PC to a computer tech. There is just too many steps to perform and to provide each one would not be easy. <br>  <br>  A simple fix would be to login to an administrator account and delete this account. Then recreate another one. However, you would lose any saved documents in your "my documents" and anything on your desktop. If those are important, visit a computer doctor.<br>  <br>  Edit: Looking at your previous questions, looks like your PC has a history of being trashed and you not giving away the 10 points.

vK53Hh8naa	Sorry about the late post, my browser was malfunctioning.<br>  <br>  I used a function oriented approach to solve your question guys. The game extension is set at the head of the batch by the gameExtension variable. The sessionkey variable is used to avoid bugs in the batch - it works because the sessionkey won't be known until the batch is already running and hence the functions can only be referenced within the batch. I also placed the pause and cls function combo that you repeatedly used into a single call - it makes it easier to read. <br>  <br>  @echo off<br>  cls<br>  SetLocal EnableDelayedExpansion<br>  set gameExtension=game<br>  set sessionkey=%random%%random%<br>  title Game Test 2<br>  color 0a<br>  echo This is the second game test that<br>  echo we have made/making right now...<br>  call :pausecls<br>  echo It is called GT2.<br>  call :pausecls<br>  call :init %1<br>  exit<br>  <br>  <br>  :getname<br>  color 0a<br>  echo What is your name?<br>  set /p name=<br>  cls<br>  echo Hello %name%!<br>  call :pausecls<br>  if [%1]==[%sessionkey%] (goto %2) else (goto :eof)<br>  <br>  <br>  :getage<br>  color 0a<br>  echo What is your age?<br>  set /p age=<br>  cls<br>  echo You are %age%...<br>  call :pausecls<br>  if [%1]==[%sessionkey%] (goto %2) else (goto :eof)<br>  <br>  <br>  :getclass<br>  color 0c<br>  echo Pick a class.<br>  echo Assassin(A), Barbarian(B), Mutant(M), Warrior(W):<br>  set CL=NONE<br>  set /p class=<br>  if [%class%]==[A] set CL=Assassin<br>  if [%class%]==[B] set CL=Barbarian<br>  if [%class%]==[M] set CL=Mutant<br>  if [%class%]==[W] set CL=Warrior<br>  if %CL%==NONE (<br>  call :wrongcase&goto getclass<br>  )<br>  cls<br>  echo You are a %CL%<br>  call :pausecls<br>  if [%1]==[%sessionkey%] (goto %2) else (goto :eof)<br>  <br>  <br>  :getgender<br>  color 0c<br>  echo Now we are going to choose your gender:<br>  echo What are you?<br>  echo Boy(B) or Girl(G):<br>  set GNDR=NONE<br>  set /p gender=<br>  if [%gender%]==[B] set GNDR=Boy<br>  if [%gender%]==[G] set GNDR=Girl<br>  if %GNDR%==NONE (<br>  call :wrongcase&goto getgender<br>  )<br>  cls<br>  echo You are a %GNDR%...<br>  call :pausecls<br>  if [%1]==[%sessionkey%] (goto %2) else (goto :eof)<br>  <br>  <br>  :summary<br>  color 0c<br>  echo Let's go through this information:<br>  echo Your name is %name%(NA), you are %age%(AG) years old,<br>  echo you are a %CL%(CL), and you are a %GNDR%(GN).<br>  echo If any of this information is incorrect, please<br>  echo input the key, if all information is correct, please<br>  echo input CO<br>  set /p check=<br>  cls<br>  if [%check%]==[NA] call :getname %sessionkey% summary&set check=%sessionkey%<br>  if [%check%]==[AG] call :getage %sessionkey% summary&set check=%sessionkey%<br>  if [%check%]==[CL] call :getclass %sessionkey% summary&set check=%sessionkey%<br>  if [%check%]==[GN] call :getgender %sessionkey% summary&set check=%sessionkey%<br>  if [%check%]==[CO] echo All information is correct...&call :pausecls&set check=%sessionkey%<br>  if NOT [%check%]==[%sessionkey%] call :wrongcase&goto summary<br>  goto :eof<br>  <br>  :printclasses<br>  color 0c<br>  echo Good, now we are going to choose<br>  echo your class.<br>  call :pausecls<br>  echo A list will pop up to tell you what each class is.<br>  echo.<br>  type list.txt<br>  call :pausecls<br>  call :getclass<br>  goto :eof<br>  <br>  <br>  :saveit<br>  echo Would you like to save your configuration?

This normally won't take longer then a few minutes/hours. For more information you can check the .NET Messenger Service Status <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Please note that the Service Status is known to not always be very accurate, if problems do appear the best thing to do is wait them out. Surely there are many other very interesting things to do. If the error keeps bothering you for over a few days there are some more things you can try below.<br>  <br>  If the error continues to appear it is most likely because the Windows digital signatures system is damaged or corrupt. To resolve this you will have to register several dll files that are required for Messenger. You can do this automatically by running a batch file we created or if you prefer by executing the commands yourself.<br>  Automatic solution<br>  <br>  First you will have to download this zip file which includes a batch file that can register the dll files for you. After downloading unzip it and run register-messenger-dll-files.bat, a black screen will pop up and update you on the process. When done your Messenger should work again!<br>  Manual solution<br>  <br>  First open a run window by clicking start, then run. Now, type the following command and press enter:<br>  <br>  regsvr32 softpub.dll Wintrust.dll Initpki.dll Rsaenh.dll Mssip32.dll Cryptdlg.dll<br>  <br>  If you use Windows XP you should open another run window after running the previous commands then type the following command:<br>  <br>  regsvr32 Dssenh.dll Gpkcsp.dll Slbcsp.dll Sccbase.dll<br>  <br>  <br>  In previous cases we found Norton Internet Security to be the cause of this error.

A wild guess, there is a problem with the MSN Server.<br>  The Cause of Code 81000314<br>  The Microsoft MSN server is down or otherwise unavailable.  If it is indeed Microsoft's MSN problem, then be careful not to make matters worse, for example don't try mending something that does not need mending and thus breaking a perfectly good system. <br>  Another possibility is that Softpub.dll may have become unregistered.  <br>  Solutions to MSN Error Code 81000314<br>  1) Wait for the MSN Server to return!  Meanwhile check the status of the Messenger service, at: <a href="http://messenger.msn.com/Status.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://messenger.msn.com/Status.aspx</a><br>  2) Delete ListCache.dat<br>  Launch CMD and navigate to %appdata%\microsoft.<br>  CD %appdata%\microsoft<br>  Dir /s ListCache.dat <br>  Decide if you want to delete the cache.<br>  Del /s ListCache.dat <br>  Restart your MSN Messenger. <br>  3) Register softpub.dll.<br>  Click Start (Button), and then click Run, type regsvr32 softpub.dll.  Restart MSN Messenger.<br>  It would do no harm to also use regsvr32 to re-register: wintrust.dll and initpki.dll<br>  4) Another problem could be firewall related, thus try temporarily disabling the firewall.  If this cures the problem, make sure that MSN Messenger is allowed full access through the firewall.<br>  <br>  <br>  ->>Summary of MSN Error Code 81000314<br>  If you are suffering from MSN Error Code 81000314, check that the server is available at Microsoft's end. at: <a href="http://messenger.msn.com/Status.aspx." rel="nofollow">http://messenger.msn.com/Status.aspx.</a>  Beware of doing anything to make the problem worse, when it could be the servers fault.<br>  <br>  <br>  ????????*`?. ? ??ρε ? ?εlρε??.?* ????????<br>  ☆   <br>  ::: (\(\ <br>  *: (=' :') :* <br>  ?..

Look for something like "keyboard utility"--it may even still be on your machine, but not invoked at start-up like it should be.<br>  <br>  ~~ ScienceMikey<br>  My home page: <a href="http://MRudas.2Ya.com" rel="nofollow">http://MRudas.2Ya.com</a><br>  My software blog: <a href="http://FaveSoft.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://FaveSoft.blogspot.com</a><br>  My Protopage links: <a href="http://TinyURL.com/3wt54n" rel="nofollow">http://TinyURL.com/3wt54n</a>

Generally though you could have any of the following connectors on both...<br>  <br>  VGA - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA</a><br>  S-video - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Video" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Video</a><br>  DVI - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Vis...</a><br>  HDMI - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI</a><br>  <br>  Basically the difference in these is quality and how long they have been around... In my opinion, VGA has the lowest quality and has been around the longest. Then S-Video, DVI and finally HDMI which is the newest to come out and sends stuff in HD and in digital quality.<br>  <br>  So take a look and see what your choices are for both your computer and TV. Be sure you are looking at the outputs on your computer and the inputs for your TV or else there will be a big issue (I've messed it up so I thought I would mention that)<br>  <br>  Most likely your TV and your computer will have a few in common which is good because it will end up cheaper. Let's say that your TV and your Computer both have VGA ports... go to Radioshack or Best Buy (somewhere where you can get computer stuff) and tell them that you need a VGA cable for your computer. You will be looking for Male to Male cables so be sure to mention that to the associate.<br>  <br>  Now in the rare case that your computer and TV have no connectors in common, write down on a sheet of paper which connectors the TV and computer has. Take this to Best Buy or Radioshack and ask them for help. I say this because you are going to need cable converters and they will be able to help you much better than I can put into words. Converting is a bit more expensive but when you have to have your computer on your TV, it's good to spend the extra 5 bucks!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :-)|`|1c462e7640ca8208f281921446a57c68aa	A midi cord is for hooking up a musical instrument to your pc.

Usually a 3x5.<br>  Using an odd numbet table allows you to insert text or images into the center, left or right, top middle or bottom. When you first insert the table it will be small but will automatically resize to fit your inputs.<br>  Resize your images before inserting so they will load fster on the page.<br>  For resizing a good (free) photo editor is XN View  (lilink below)<br>  <br>  It also a built-in FTP client for uploading.<br>  There are very good help files and lots of information about how to use on the websites. <br>  <br>  About the only weakness I have found is that Kompozer does not support frames. <br>  <br>  For frames I use Coffee Cup (also free download) to make the frame set then use Kompozer to make the pages for the frames.<br>  <br>  I wanted to make my own websites but did not want to spend $ 400-  to  $600- for an application and have been very happy with the two above.<br>  <br>  You will also need an FTP client to upload your files and even though there are built in ftp clients to Kompozer and Coffee Cup I use Core FTP.

kWxhWET7aa	The ONLY way they're going to pull this off is by caching them somewhere on the net. Which sounds like the kind of dangerous stuff they would just love to do. Or by still accepting cookies and just saying they're rejecting them.<br>  <br>  Like for instance IE7 doesn't actually clear the history when people use that facility unless, either the network connection is disabled, or the amount of temp files exceeds a certain limit. But a proper anti-virus will. IE7 simply invalidates the current pointer to the cookies so that people can't access them through script. But an intruder could easily raid your cookie jar since it's always in the same damn place.

IGJGUfjNaa	If your virus/spyware free, there are  a couple things you can do get your computer working faster. If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.<br>  <br>  First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Do a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.<br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/what-is-the-best-registry-cleaner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/w...</a><br>  <br>  2. Clear your Windows cache files, this is your temporary file. It can grow up to a large volume and stop your computer from using RAM properly. In a sense slow it down by preventing it from using free space.Here is how:<br>  <br>  1. Quit Internet Explorer, Firefox, or any other web browser<br>  2. Click Start, click "Control Panel", and then double-click "Internet Options".<br>  3. On the General tab, click "Delete Files" under Temporary Internet Files.<br>  4. In the Delete Files dialog box, click to select the "Delete all offline content" check box , and then click OK.<br>  5. Click OK.<br>  <br>  3. Manage your startups. Your excess CPU usage is due to too many programs running in the background. You can cut these to barebones by alter your msconfig. Here is how:<br>  <br>  1. Open your Start menu.<br>  2. Click Run<br>  3. In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>  4. In the "system configuration utility",click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>  5. Uncheck all programs that your are no longer using.<br>  6. Click "OK"|`|rfkPEvXQaa	Reinstall WOW.|`|XRECYErsaa	This might be your internet connection, or spyware problems.

Then install Folder Lock in any drive you want or let the path be a default one in the 'Program Files' folder.<br>  <br>  Once you are done with installation, run the program. Set and confirm a password of your choice. This will allow you to get into the Folder Lock's main functions area.<br>  <br>  Now, to protect files on USB Flash Drives, Memory Sticks, Pen Drives or Zip Drives, click 'Browse' and select the option 'Move to portable disk'. Then read the instructions and click the 'Next' button. Now you will be able to select the drive(s) in which you want protection.<br>  <br>  Lets say your USB Flash Drive is L: You can select this drive by clicking the check box next to it. After that click the 'Move It' button, this will move the program folder of Folder Lock to your USB Drive (Only about 1.75 MB). Now you can run the program from that drive, by going to L: through Windows Explorer. Then after running Folder Lock from there, enter the correct password, and keep the files/folders in the 'Locker' folder it creates there. Once all files/folders are transfered to the 'Locker' folder, simply switch to Folder Lock program and click 'Lock' button and choose 'Lock'<br>  <br>  Locking files by keeping them in the 'Locker' folder makes them portably secure. You can take your removable disks anywhere if you like, once the files are locked inside the 'Locker' on that drive. This will guarantee that you data is safe from being stolen.<br>  <br>  Please remember that the only method that we recommend for USB Flash Drives is the 'Move to Portable Disk' option, don't simply use the 'Lock Folders and Drives' option since it will only lock files in your own computer, but if you transfer files in the 'Locker' folder and then lock it, the only way to access your files is with a correct password even if you move the portable drive from one computer to another.

SNZ88BfKaa	GROUP is a reserved word, used in GROUP BY expressions. You cannot use it as a field name without delimiting it, with quotation marks I believe. A better option is to just rename it to something else.<br>  <br>  Although that isn't the error I'd expect from that problem. You should also check that your table and column names are correct. Is your table really "admiss" and is your column name really "reg_no"? Is the "admiss" table in the user's schema?

wTwppABQaa	You can easily block access to a website by adding it to your Windows HOSTS file. Without any software. Doesn't matter what browser that you use. This procedure will block sites in all browsers.<br>  <br>  (Before you start, make sure that in Folder Options, that you have Show hidden files and folders, "checked" and Hide protected system operating files, left "un-checked")<br>  <br>  1.Go to your HOSTS file which is located at:<br>  C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC for windows Vista and XP<br>  C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC for Windows 2k<br>  C:\WINDOWS for Windows 98 and ME<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Open HOSTS with Notepad.<br>  <br>  The default Windows HOSTS looks like this:<br>  ______________________<br>  <br>  # Copyright ? 1993-1999 Microsoft Corp.<br>  # <br>  # This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.<br>  # <br>  # This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each<br>  # entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should<br>  # be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.<br>  # The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one<br>  # space.<br>  # <br>  # Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual<br>  # lines or following the machine name denoted by a "#" symbol.<br>  # <br>  # For example:<br>  # <br>  # 102.54.94.97 rhino.acme.com # source server<br>  # 38.25.63.10 x.acme.com # x client host<br>  # <br>  127.0.0.1 localhost<br>  _____________________________<br>  <br>  3. Directly under the line that says 127.0.0.1 Localhost, you will want to type:<br>  <br>  127.0.0.1 name of the URL you want to block<br>  <br>  For example to block the MySpace.com homepage (highly recommended!), simply type:<br>  <br>  127.0.0.1 myspace.com<br>  127.0.0.1 www.myspace.com<br>  <br>  Other parts of MySpace could be blocked in a similar way:<br>  <br>  127.0.0.1 search.myspace.com<br>  127.0.0.1 profile.myspace.com<br>  etc etc etc...<br>  <br>  You may need to add sites with both with and without the "www.". Test after blocking to make sure you got it right.<br>  <br>  You can add as many sites as you wish to block in this fashion.<br>  <br>  <br>  4. Close Notepad and answer "Yes" when prompted.<br>  <br>  5. Reboot your computer and attempt to access your now blocked website. You should see a Cannot find server or DNS Error saying: "The page cannot be displayed".

Windows XP would work with 526 MB ram at a slow to moderate speed if no to few programs running in back ground. It would be limited as to graphics and video card for the programs you want to use. I would just use it until you can save up for a new computer. Lap tops are great but not easily upgradeable so if considering one order it with every thing you want like a excellent graphics card, WiFi etc.because changing or adding internal components are expensive, also get the factory extended warranty. Desk tops are more upgradeable and cheaper to repair but not portable of course, so the trade off.<br>  Hope this helps|`|73250ff641e2c3cc52bb285aea5f1d3daa	You can upgrade your OS from ME to XP, but I don't recommend installing Vista on it. Especially with older computers, they don't really have the requirements to run it. Although, if you do upgrade  it, you won't do very much if you are going to use graphic-intensive stuff, because there's a very annoying RAM limit on motherboards, and with older ones, they can only at least hold at most 256MB or even 512.|`|eToQ9AXcaa	Your computer will run a total of 512mbs of pc133 sdram therefore you can upgrade to xp. The pentium 3 will not run vista. Vista also requires 1gb of ram minimum to run. Check ebay for the ram. As for as the operating system download windows xp pro black edition.(its free)|`|AA10666760	I'd be cautious about spending much money to upgrade this system. The max that this can handle is 512 megs of RAM, which isn't much.  That's barely enough to do anything after booting up. Yes you can purchase an upgrade CD (from ME to XP or Vista), but two 256-meg sticks of RAM will cost you 70 bucks at crucial.com; the upgrade CD will probably cost about that much as well. The end result would be an old computer that runs XP very slowly.  I'm not sure your time on photoshop or GIMP would be well spent on this, but then again its your money. Most would recommend a good gig of RAM for XP, not 512 megs.  If it were me, I'd save the money if I couldn't afford a new one, and keep it till I could get a better, new model.

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Easy. First, you should understand the purpose. The top surface of the chip and the bottom surface of the heatsink may look and feel smooth, but they aren't. Look at each under high magnification and it looks like mountain ranges. This means that when put together, only the tips actually touch with air in the places which do not touch. Air is an insulator which means heat is transferred only where the tips of the ridges touch. The paste you refer to simply fills in the air space with a material which conducts heat well so it makes better contact across the entire surface where the CPU and heat sink come together. All you need is enough to coat the surfaces completely and not ooze out around the edges. Anything oozing out is too much and is wasted. However, it IS better to use little too much than not enough to cover the contact area completely. Think of like peanut butter and jelly, each of which fills in the holes in the bread on both sides completely but does not squeeze out. All the paste does is improve the efficiency of the heat transfer that takes place between the surfaces to maximize the amount of cooling done by the heatsink.|`|4YmB7q5jaa	you first need to clean tha old paste gently then add the new one|`|Cn9WIJhgaa	<a href="http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/274" rel="nofollow">http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/2...</a><br>  <br>  www.expertvillage.com/video/7468_build...|`|fc77a866e635617e01c610e44fc41f33aa	Place a couple of drops (or small lines) where the heatsink will fit (after you've installed the CPU in the socket) then install the heatsink above it.<br>  <br>  The paste will be squished when the heatsink is installed.<br>  <br>  Put a sufficient quantity, but not too much to avoid spills.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|7c007d90b52d84105c8a22e166229b79aa	VERY LIGHT coat on the cpu.

gVhGZzgKaa	If you're getting a message saying that your USB device could run faster if you plugged it into a USB 2.0 port then that is exactly the reason. USB 1.0 is an older technology. They increased the speed for USB with 2.0. Yes firewire is and has been faster than USB since it's introduction, but everyone uses USB for whatever reason. USB is coming out with USB 3.0, which I am eagerly awaiting... anyway, I digress. It means you're putting a device in a USB 1.0 that was originally designed for use in a USB 2.0 port. The only way to remedy this is to A.) Buy a new motherboard, which I wouldn't suggest because you'll replace everything else too, or B.) buy a new computer. I would venture so far as to say you're computer is older than 5 years as well.

C9TbFpHMaa	Please find the below definition for chips:<br>  <br>  A chip is a tiny piece of silicon with electronic circuits. The chip is the most important part of the computer.<br>  <br>  In Computer CPU also one type of chip.<br>  <br>  <br>  How Chips are Made:<br>  <br>  Computer chip technology is in all sorts of everyday items, from space shuttles to coffee makers, traffic lights, and computers. A basic rule of thumb is, if a device uses electricity and you can "tell it what to do" by programming it or customizing it, there's a chip inside.<br>  <br>  Chips perform various tasks by design, meaning that some are more complex than others. The most sophisticated chip is a microprocessor, whose transistors can execute hundreds of millions of instructions per second.<br>   <br>   <br>  A microprocessor is the most complex manufactured product on earth. In fact, it takes hundreds of steps in the world's cleanest environment to make microprocessors<br>  <br>  I hope you will get an nice idea about chip now.|`|7mfKuYF6aa	What?|`|HtYgXUixaa	Do you mean something like the Bios on a motherboard or firmware on a basic chip such as for MIDI?

Assume you are saying you going to do something like FAQ (frequently asked question), I did once before which I called it a semi-dynamic FAQ. It is not fully dynamic is due to the content are not loaded from DB, instead it was hardcoded in the page itself, however it is actually animated due to the AJAX toolkit called Accordion, so what happen is that I will have all my questions display in the page and when the user click on the question, the answer for the respective question will show :)<br>  <br>  If you wanna do something like this just mail me at chengfee_83@yahoo.com, cc to easypolicy@gmail.com or vice versa.

044IeGstaa	NOT GOOD!<br>  <br>  The port, or opening in your laptop where the AC adapter goes, (Also called a 'Charger'), is the DC Power Jack.<br>  <br>  Your AC adapter converts your household AC electricity into DC electricity. (Flashlight batteries, and your laptop battery are examples of DC power)<br>  <br>  The pin in the middle of the DC Power Jack is the Positive (+)<br>  The outside round metal shell is the Negative ( - )<br>  <br>  IF, there is a loose connection, Resistance is developed. Resistance causes Heat. Heat cause FIRE!<br>  <br>  Sure, you could get a small piece of paper, and maybe insert it and the AC adapter plug into the DC Power Jack, at the same time. Would keep the AC adapter plug wedged over to one side, and make a tight fit. HOPEFULLY, it would force the center socket hole, of the AC adapter plug over to one side also, and make a good contact with the DC Power Jack's middle pin.<br>  <br>  BUT, this is a VERY BAD idea! You don't know if everything will be tight, and STAY tight!<br>  IF NOT, resistance, heat, FIRE!<br>  <br>  Now let's say you leave the AC adapter plugged in overnight.<br>  WILL you sleep good, knowing a possible Fire could occur while you're sleeping?<br>  <br>  Solution?

ia3MomIOaa	go with the 9800GTX+ its a very good card, and most that prefer intel over AMD also prefer nvidia over ATI.

Choose dual slots if you have an option.|`|TJAdzZOEaa	I'm not sure if your power supply will be sufficient for either of those cards.

Its basically a 9800GTX+ with a faster clock speed and a smaller gpu chip. Therefore, it runs a little bit faster than the standard 9800GTX+  and a little bit cooler too (and of course you get physx). Best of all, its cheaper or at least about the same price as a 9800GTX+ <br>  <br>  As far as the "better cooling" that comes with the 4850, theres not much use for it because the 9800GTX+/GTS 250 rarely top 70 Celsius unless you overclock the heck out of it so theres no worry about overheating. <br>  <br>  Plus you get to brag to your friends that you have a 200 series GeForce in your computer. Thats always nice :]|`|GKgmyEfnaa	I'm running a similar system - Q9450/4GB/AsusP5K-e/850w PSU and have found the 9800GTX to be an excellent graphics card.  Can't say I know a great deal about the 4850 so I won't say that one is better than the other, but if you choose the 9800 you'll be getting a nice piece of hardware at a reasonable price.  It has coped with everything I've thrown at it so far.
AA10394789	It depends on the speed of your internet connection, but for most people 1 or 2 at a time will get the best speeds.<br>  Other peers will send more data to you if they are receiving a decent amount of data from you.  With 5 torrents running, most people's upload would be spread too thin and they will not get back much from other peers.<br>  Most bittorrent clients have a queue system where the torrent would start when another have finished.|`|JxYzhAILaa	Download the one with the highest d/l speed first, by it self. Most programs give you the option of assigning a priority to the download, which is very useful. If the highest d/l  on 1 file is 60 for example, you may as well start the d/l of another. Continue to monitor them and adjust as necessary.|`|aUtBNzLUaa	They come in at the same rate usually. it is more preference. doing it one at a time is better if you want to feel like something is actually happening, while if you do it all at once, you will have the feeling it will take weeks. Personally I like to focus on the important ones, never more than 2 or 3 at a time, and then just move the rest on my own priority scale.
a5NcueNwaa	Yeah, it's going to be huge as a single file.<br>  <br>  Firstly, converting DVD to disc image file (ISO).  Do this using any software that converts dvd to iso.  I use Nero, but it's not free - I'm sure there are free tools to do it though.  The receiver can then burn ISO to DVD on their end.<br>  <br>  Secondly, in order to turn a massive file into smaller parts, you can use winzip or winRAR (free) to create an archive and use the "Split" option to save the file into multiple zipped files.  For your purposes maybe split to 50mb files (if downloading from somewhere) or choose 20mb (if you think you might have to email each to a gmail account - max transfer to gmail is 20mb, lower for hotmail I think).<br>  <br>  The receiver downloads each to the same directory from wherever.  Once all downloaded, open with winRAR (or any unzip tool) to find the content of all the split .zip files combined.  Extracts the ISO to burn. presto!|`|4mpqiMLuaa	You can burn video on DVD with Wondershare Video to DVD Burner , which is a fast video-editing and DVD-authoring application.

Should be ok in case of LimeWire or other P2P programs since they'll upload directly from your computer.<br>  <br>   - if they're happy to view it without burning to to DVD first, you might consider converting the video footage to a file format easily viewable on a computer eg. mpg, mpeg or avi, etc. before sending to them.<br>  <br>  2. Alternatively, you might also have the footage on a camcorder, which could be tranferred to the computer directly, instead of getting onto a DVD and then to computer...

If not all is not lost.  Go to Start and click on search.

Select the drive you wish to search i.e. C:/ and then press search.  Depending on how large your drive is it could take several minutes to find the file.  Good luck

Ubuntu has some gui kind of mode, it loads and run's in live cd/dvd mode and an icon will appear on the desktop. Just you need to do is double click on it. And for RHEl, Fedora, CentOs etc just insert dvd(bootable OS) and restart the machine. Make sure that the Bios is configured for booting from cd/dvd drive. and follow up the pop-up instruction's from the OS while installing...<br>  Enjoy :)

Z0lEv4Dzaa	I think Turbo C++ cannot really run in Windows Vista.  Its too old and it runs in 16-bit DOS.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you try other better compilers for C++ that has windows-based IDE. There's Visual C++ with different versions but is a lot more advanced compared to Turbo C++ and used to create almost anything like Windows Applications and Console Applications.You can google that up if you want to know more about it.<br>  <br>  If you want to write programs the way you write it with Turbo C++, you can try the Borland C++Windows version. Codes are written the same. Its a windows based C++ 5.02 compiler and I'm sure you won't have problems installing it on Windows Vista. I'm sure you will enjoy more writing your codes with Windows - based C++ builders like (Borland C++ Win) etc.<br>  <br>  Go download it. If you can't find it, send me an email then I'll send it to you thru email.|`|7bb0efb37d1d3c0228ce2e788f4e2555aa	Turbo C++ for DOS? Download the free DosBox, it emulates older PCs and Turbo C++ for DOS should run on it. It has its own DOS.<br>  <br>  If it's Turbo C++ for Windows, you're probably running the 16 bit version which won't run in Vista. Try the free Microsoft Virtual PC, and VMWare which is not free. You will need to install an older Windows, or Linux with Wine. Btw, the free Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express is an excellent IDE. You'll need to also install Platform SDK if you need to create non managed (non .NET) code.

It really does nothing to help the computer.|`|x35co5F8aa	Your disk is partitioned - but I think not very cleverly.<br>  <br>  I have a 320GB system disk - I allowed 60GB for my XP installation - you could resize and make it smaller, as long as it's never more than half full, because Windows can't use space well and it would get fragmented a lot and slow down.<br>  <br>  For 320GB, you should think maybe around 300GB visible - the filesystem wastes some space. On a laptop, you also have an invisible recovery partition, that accounts for the rest of the space.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do to start being safer is to MOVE your 'My Documents' folder onto the NON system partition D:  - this means it is excluded from any recovery and/or re-installation, and that makes it safe.<br>  <br>  U can right click 'My Documents' and in the properties section, you can set the location, and tell it to move there - that means your Windows installation is on C: drive, and your documents are on D: - which is also where you should keep any backup files. It's the same as taking your luggage out of the engine compartment of your car.

XlyLakYAaa	You could also go for an Intel i7.  Even the slowest i7 will decimate any Core 2 Quad.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I'd probably go with a Q9550|`|r5ebjq5waa	Is money the issue? If money is not the issue, the a core i7 is definitely the way to go. <br>  <br>  If money is the issue, but you will be building a system from scratch, then i7 is still probably the way to go... or phenom 2.<br>  <br>  An i7 920 system will beat just about anything except other higher end i7's. You can build an i7 920 system on newegg with a nice case but no monitor for about 1200 dollars. <br>  <br>  You can build a Phenom 2 system for about 1000. If you bought the Phenom 2, though, you would have to buy a mediocre chip to use the newest AM3 motherboards and wait for the good AM3 cpus to be released in a month or two. <br>  <br>  Building an i7 system is probably the way to go. If you build with the LGA 775 socket, you're limiting yourself because they're going to stop making them much sooner than the i7's LGA 1366 socket.  Basically build a good one now and you won't have to for awhile.

AA10570173	If you are a student (generally you are going to school at least half-time to qualify, although there are different rules regarding K-12 vs. college) you can qualify for the student license. You can buy direct from Adobe, or from any of several academic resellers such as JourneyEd.com or Academic Superstore. Check with your school first, because some schools may have special arrangements with the resellers, where it is either easier for you to qualify (you don't have to do as much paperwork/provide as much proof) or may have a reselling arrangement themselves. Also if you have a university with a bookstore on campus in your city, they often carry the educational/student license versions, and as long as you can prove you are a student, even if you aren't attending that university, you can purchase the products there.<br>  <br>  If you aren't a student and need a "cheap" alternative, look into downloading the free OpenSource image editor, the Gimp, from www.gimp.org.

maMeeV4caa	I believe that you need to get a new charger that is specifically for your laptop.<br>  <br>  The new charger is making your computer laggy because it has 0.5 volts less than your old one. So the computer has to work that much harder to draw power from the charger, thereby making it laggy. If I am correct, you may also experience overheating with your laptop.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that you return the charger to Dell and get a charger from Topmic.com because they offer lifetime warranty and free shipping for only $58. ($30 cheaper than Dell). and you dont have to worry about your charger breaking anymore.<br>  <a href="http://www.topmic.com/dell-inspiron-1721-laptop-charger-ac-adapter-power-supply-and-power-cord.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.topmic.com/dell-inspiron-1721...</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck, get a new charger somewhere soon.

My friends who own HP machines usually have to return them to make their warranty valid and get them fixed (they break all the time) so I'm inclined to think HP is particularly bad. Also, it's pretty obvious to me that HP focuses more on impressing the average not-very-tech-savy costumer than actually caring for the quality and performance of their computes.<br>  <br>  IBM is also VERY high quality.

wNXocBHpaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I had this problem Previously this is what i got from Mozilla's website it fixed my problem and it should od the same for you.<br>  <br>  When you attempt to download an executable file (e.g., an .exe or .msi file) the download may fail and the Firefox Downloads window will show the message:<br>  <br>      * This download has been blocked by your Security Zone Policy. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This happens because Firefox honors your Windows security settings for downloading applications and other potentially unsafe files from the Internet. You can fix this by either adding a Firefox preference to bypass the Windows Security Policy check or by resetting your system Internet security settings, as explained below.<br>  3, Windows:<br>  Bypass Windows Security Policy check<br>  <br>  You can add the new preference, browser.download.manager.skipWinSecurity... (available in current Firefox versions) and set it to true. This will bypass the Windows Security Policy check and allow you to download executable files. To add this new preference:<br>  <br>     1. In the Location bar, type about:config, and press EnterReturn.<br>            * The about:config "This might void your warranty!" warning page may appear. Click I'll be careful, I promise!, to continue to the about:config page. <br>     2. Right-click anywhere in the list of preferences.<br>     3. In the context menu, select New then select Boolean. The "New boolean value" dialog box will appear.<br>     4. Enter the preference name browser.download.manager.skipWinSecurity... in the text field and click OK.<br>     5. In the "Enter boolean value" box that appears, select true and click OK. <br>  <br>  Firefox should now be able to download executable files.<br>  <br>  As an alternative solution, you can also reset your system Internet security settings.<br>  3, Windows:<br>  Reset system Internet security settings<br>  <br>  The Firefox Downloads window will show the message, This download has been blocked by your Security Zone Policy if the Windows Internet security option, Launching applications and unsafe files is set to "Disable".<br>  Note: This option is available on systems that include Internet Explorer 7.<br>  To fix this:<br>  <br>     1. From the Windows Start menu, open Control Panel.<br>     2. Switch to Classic View and double-click Internet Options.<br>     3. Select the Security tab.<br>     4. Click the Custom level... button to change the settings for the Internet zone.<br>     5. Scroll down to the option, Launching applications and unsafe files (under "Miscellaneous").<br>     6. Select Prompt (Recommended).<br>     7. Click the OK button. <br>  <br>  If the "Launching applications and unsafe files" option is already set to Prompt (Recommended), "toggle" the setting (select Disable, click OK, then go back and select Prompt (Recommended) and click OK).<br>  <br>  If the above instructions don't fix the problem or don't apply, try the following:<br>  <br>      * Reset all Windows security zones to the default levels. From the Windows Start menu, open Control Panel, switch to Classic View and double-click Internet Options. Select the Security tab and click the Reset all zones to default level button. <br>  <br>      * Add the blocked download site to the Trusted Sites list. From the Windows Start menu, open Control Panel, switch to Classic View and double-click Internet Options. Select the Security tab, then select the Trusted sites zone and click the Sites button. You may need to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone checkbox before adding the site.<br>      * It is also possible that the site is being blocked because it is in the Restricted sites list.

If this does not help, press Ctrl, Alt, and<br>  Delete keys all at the same time. If a programs screen appears, select end task and left click your mouse one time.

fCOq04lNaa	Well you can get silent running GTs. Go for something like a Geforce 9600 GT at the least, and something like an 8800/9800 series card will be super. <br>  <br>  Not all GS cards run quiet, it mostly depends on the cooler. Getting a card with a good cooler is usually more important. Try reading reviews of the specific card(make sure the review is of the same manufacturer)<br>  <br>  GS versions of a card tend to be neutered versions of GT cards with lower clocks, worse memory, and a significantly lower stream processors count. Therefore they perform worse than a GT card. Avoid the lower end cards like the 8400 GS. However they do usually generate less heat.<br>  <br>  In Nvidia lingo:<br>  Usually the second number of a card is the most important(e.g. 8800GT), as they show the level of the card. <br>  Low end:x2xx-x5xx<br>  Mid end:x6xx<br>  high end:GTX 260, x8xx<br>  <br>  Followed by the first number(which indicates series)<br>  <br>  And then the suffix:<br>  G<GE<GS<GSO<GT<GTS<GTX<GTX+|`|9c1c58591b54b915f9fa4a32a19a748aaa	gt with zalman cooler|`|xhyLxSliaa	i would recommend gt becuase it is better for performance   gs is not aas good as gt  you can compare graphic card benhmarks on <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/charts/gaming-graphics-charts-q1-2008/3DMark06-v1.0.2-HDR-SM3.0-Score,538.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tomshardware.com/charts/gamin...</a>  <br>  <br>  <br>  that will tell you all about performance  i recommend gt for performance   all graphic card make noise.

Does that mean, however, that you, a viewer of the video, are also allowed to use the song for personal use? <br>  <br>  I think that the answer is yes. Bear in mind, that I am not a lawyer. Not only that, but I really know very little about copyright law. Just the basics. This is just my guess. I would advise you to actually check the laws in your country yourself.<br>  <br>  Many nations around the world have Fair Use concepts in their legal systems. This does not mean, however, that every country that has Fair Use defines it in the exact same way. Therefore, it's important to check up on the specifics for your country and also for this kind of situation.

That should give an idea of what it does. If I had it on my system that's what I'd do.<br>  <br>  UPDATE: ok, I located a copy of the exe and have sent it through both Anubis and CWsandbox. Network traffic from the file appears to be simply reporting a version number, but also remember this is only for a short period of time while the analysis takes place. Further activity could, however, happen later (and I've seen malware do this in the past).<br>  <br>  Anubis thinks the file is suspicious based on its behaviours (such as modifying internet explorer properties and deleting non-temp files), but I don't know if AV software would normally set warning bells off as it does do some pretty funky stuff by common program standards.<br>  <br>  My feeling is that the file is safe, however the CWSandbox analysis was quite large - pifts.exe is one very busy little program. Unfortunately someone with a better understanding of low-level windows programming would have to take a look at it to make a more informed assessment, I'm not familiar enough with MS Visual C++ (which it's programmed in) to know if the behaviour and system calls it is making are normal. <br>  But as I said, my gut tells me it's ok.<br>  <br>  Still doesn't tell us why they're deleting everything mentioning it though...<br>  <br>  (PS: clean on virustotal.com too)|`|6m7odjdRaa	This may throw some light on this subject of PIFTS.EXE <br>  <a href="http://www.sophos.com/blogs/gc/g/2009/03/10/mystery-symantec-pifts/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sophos.com/blogs/gc/g/2009/03...</a>|`|ePqWFnyKaa	aliens, amn. ******' aliens.
lfymrCqtaa	There are no programs to overclock Ram. A because you do no use programs to overclock and b you don't over clock ram you overclock the cpu. overclocking the CPU is accomplished by changing the clock ratio of the frontside bus (FSB) in the BIOS setup, some older methods were accomplished by changing a jumper on the motherboard or changing the clock crystal. Dell and other top brand manufacturers usually disable the part of the bios to overclock your computer, so you ether change the Bios which is really hard because alot of bios are satered on the motherboard or you buy a new mother board that can be overclocked.

kksb2IUSaa	An XML namespace is a way of grouping XML elements together.<br>  <br>  Imagine that you want to combine some of your XML documents with someone else’s. In doing so, you find out that they have used some of the same names for elements that you have. For example, let's say that your XML document uses an element named "title" to contain the name of a book you are selling, while the other person's XML document uses the "title" element to contain a customer's name prefix (mr., mrs., ms., dr., etc.).<br>  <br>  If you were to combine these XML documents, the data will become unclear and effectively meaningless because there are two "title" elements and you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.<br>  <br>  The solution to this problem is to group the element names from each XML document into its own namespace. Then, when referring to a particular element, it would be identified with the namespace in which it resides. This provides a way to distinguish elements in one XML document from the other. For example, you could use the namespace “Products” for yoiur XML document and the other XML document's namespace could be called "Customers". The elements would then be referred to as "Products:title" and "Customers:title" respectively and would be clearly distinct.

If you wanted to, you could set up a counter that would run your loop a certain amount of times and then exit.<br>  <br>  Also, the choice command is not available in all versions of windows, so if you are planning on running this batch script on more than one computer, you might want to look at set /p instead.<br>  <br>  I don't know if that answers your question, because I don't understand it very well.

Fk3TupqVaa	There are several primary areas that could be causing your computer to freeze.The most likely reason is that Corruption within your registry keys, registry classes, and registry settings.Any time you make a change to any of your computers settings and surfing online, they are stored and updated in the registry.Over time,the registry can grow to enormous proportions and full of junk and errors.So if you run a program,it will take a long time to required registry file and sometime it cant find its registry files since regsitry errors and then it has to sit there.So your computer will freeze. <br>  You need to run a self diagnostic program called regsitry cleaner.This program is very very useful,it can fix regsitry errors,clean registry remnant,corrupt files and temp files in a few minutes.Then give you a bran-new and high-speed computer.There are collection and comparison of top rated registry cleaner:<br>  <a href="http://www.make-my-pc-faster.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.make-my-pc-faster.com</a> .You can download and scan your computer for free.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	The specs look pretty good. I don't think its a hardware problem since you built it yourself, it could be something to do with the software. Computers tend to freeze out of the blue. If it does that, just reboot your machine, then try again. It could be a processor issue but I doubt it.<br>  Sometimes the Computer will freeze if you overclock the CPU, But I don't claim its from that.|`|IGJGUfjNaa	There may be several reasons why your computer is freezing. First question is when was the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.<br>  <br>  2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be a the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how. <br>  <br>  3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.   <br>  <br>  4. Another area is a hardware drivers. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestion and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing.<br>  Check your drivers. <br>  <br>  5. Lastly, check the dust buildup on the fan to make sure you system is cooling properly<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/fix-computer-freezes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/f...</a>|`|mBRHP9b2aa	Go here and run a full-service scan:<br>  <a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" rel="nofollow">http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/defau...</a><br>  it should fix your problem<br>  <br>  Also,  did you flash your bios?<br>  Your hardware may be so new<br>  and advanced that you may<br>  need to.

The Computer registry is a database that stores all of your computer<br>  settings. The computer registry becomes more complex as you use your computer.

I tried a couple but I LOVE iTunes so I dumped them.|`|wI5bhnuBaa	Well maybe if you had a legit copy of XP, you could install SP2.  <br>  BTW all caps = no no<br>  Why everyone thinks they have to have an iPod-brand MP3/MP4 player/Phone, it beats me.  Creative has better software for listening to music and syncing with MP3/MP4 players, so remember that next time around.<br>  Chris, iTunes isn't awesome at all, it is bloatware anymore, with QuickTime and Safari being pushed onto Windows users.  iTunes is acceptable but there are def better music players.

A4YXZtEJaa	First; people who just answer to earn points- get the hell out of here! <br>  <br>  Sami M; - I guess your files are in C:\Documents and Settings\<user> folder [assuming you are using Windows XP OS]. "ntuser.dat.LOG" files are logs of changes that you have made to the user registry(ntuser.dat). They are hidden files though not attributed as system file, nevertheless you should keep them. They get bigger and bigger with time but not much bigger to be aware of. As you have already experienced; they can't be deleted. Still you wanna delete those files? Get ready to be accountable for your own action! Here it goes:<br>  <br>  Option A: (Hassle- minimum) Use any tools that securely delete files. I use: PeaZip free RAR 7Z TAR ZIP archive manager (<a href="http://peazip.sourceforge.net/)" rel="nofollow">http://peazip.sourceforge.net/)</a> though it can't delete everything.<br>  <br>  Option B: (Hassle- medium) Use the most efficient,effective, lightweight Live OS:"Puppy Linux"(http://www.puppylinux.org/downloa... Boot from CD and delete anything including core windows files. But be sure which files you wanna delete cause your Windows OS may not Boot or run properly. <br>  Tips: You can & you should keep and use a copy of Puppy Linux for emergency Boot &/or for file transfer/edit in the event of your regular OS's failure. Puppy is lightweight (only 94MB) and loads on the fly, runs from CD and you can save the changes you made while exiting if you are using a CD writer & rewritable CD.<br>  <br>  Option C: Start using Ubuntu (Linux distribution)[<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download]." rel="nofollow">http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download...</a> For test purpose- install the OS into the Windows just like any other software and use for some days; if you like it (i'm confident everybody'll like) install it in a different partition otherwise uninstall it the way you uninstall other software from windows.|`|NB3vDR7zaa	like any other file? try logging in from a separate account like the windows administrator account and deleting the files.

Same thing goes for software.<br>  And about security, macs are less targeted than windows, you'll get viruses on a mac if you try hard enough.

YxiqI903aa	Dude, I'm not going to do your homework, so I'll tell you a solution, instead.<br>  <br>  1. Start the while loop asking for grade score or whatever you want to say, but also include an information stating that "exit" would take the user out of inputting more info.<br>  2. Receive Input<br>  3. Calculate, if input is not "exit" then start with the prompt from the while loop, if input is "exit, exit loop.<br>  4. Display grade with message, or whatever|`|7ONAv4vYaa	1. Just contain your code in assignment#2 in an infinite loop<br>  int main()<br>  {<br>  variables here<br>  <br>  while(true)<br>  {<br>  //asks to enter in all the grades of the student (meaning input)<br>  ...<br>  system("pause");<br>  }<br>  return 0;<br>  }<br>  <br>  continued...<br>  <br>  Continuation:<br>  2. Wait for the negative value inputted at assignment #1 as cue to exit the program.<br>  ...<br>  printf("Enter first assignment grade: ");<br>  scanf("%d", &asgn1);<br>  if( asgn1 < 0 );<br>  {<br>  // you can add exit message here<br>  break;<br>  }<br>  <br>  3.For score not in range (ignore student), you can edit this part to disregard and continue to get scores.<br>  if(allscore)<br>  {<br>  printf("all scores are good for calculation\n");<br>  }<br>  else<br>  {<br>  printf("one or more scores are bad, please re-enter the scores\n");<br>  system("pause");<br>  continue;<br>  }<br>  <br>  4. For summary add variables for total number of student, and for each letter grade number of students. like numOfStudents, Astudents, and so on. Initialize this variables to zero.<br>  <br>  5. To count number of students, add an increment statement in this area of code.<br>  if(allscore)<br>  {<br>  printf("all scores are good for calculation\n");<br>  numOfStudents++;<br>  }<br>  <br>  6. To count number of students in each letter grade,add increment statement in this area of code. This goes to other letter grades.<br>  <br>  if(score<=100 && score>=85) // if statements will<br>  {<br>  grade = 'A';<br>  Astudents++;<br>  }<br>  <br>  7. Display summary at end of the loop<br>  <br>  ...<br>  else if(score<0)<br>  {<br>  grade = 'N';<br>  }<br>  printf("grade=%c\n", grade);<br>  printf("Total Number of students=%d\n", numOfStudents);<br>  printf("Number of A students=%d\n", Astudents);<br>  ...and so on<br>  system("pause");<br>  }<br>  <br>  8. Just polish it according to your preference. You can add a message to tell user to input negative value for first assignment to exit program. You can also add statement to clear the screen at end of loop or not to keep the display of previous.<br>  <br>  I hope I didn't miss anything.<br>  I hope this helps. Goodluck

mnuIdZdIaa	Well the link thing happens to me too and currently i do not think that there is a Microsoft 8 out yet, just the beta. The website server may be down so just wait and try again later. Post additional data in 3 days and i will respond. Then for the engine thing you can change your default browser by going to tools or or options and from there go to search or browsing settings and look for add a new search. From there you can change it to Google, yahoo, ect. But I strongly recommend getting Mozilla Firefox. The only thing about it is you cannot run programs you have to save them when downloading setup files I have it and I prefer it over internet explorer. Hope this was useful and keep me posted on the internet explorer thing. I will check this daily.

Why? because several versions back this program was extremely good package but now it has become a bloated monster of a program, its become bloatware. There are much better alternatives to this application.<br>  <br>  No.1 You DON'T have 14.2GB of memory you are confusing this with hard disk space. Most windows XP machine will probably have atleast 512megs or 1GB of working memory, if you have windows vista you will need 2GB or 4GB of system memory. Older machines will probably have 512megs or less working memory.<br>  <br>  No.2 If the programs set up says its run out of system memory to install itself then that's probably accurate & true. It means your machine does not meet the minimum required configuration to install the program. Check Lavasofts website for the minimum system requirements for installation of this version?  <br>  <br>  No.3 I highly recommend a) SpyBot search & destroy (freeware) from safer networks & b) A2Squared (freeware) from Emsisoft.

OK, if the fan or lights turn on than you should see a splash screen of the manufacturer even if the hard drive is bad.  Try to connect the laptop to a external monitor or TV and test if you see anything on external monitor(you have to connect all the cables then turn on the laptop).  If you do not see any thing than try reseating the RAM on the laptop and see if that solves the problem if not than your ram or video card/chip is bad.

Tick the Create a copy of you want to leave your old workbook intact until you are sure it works ok. <br>  Then click ok and view the results.<br>  Continue workbook by workbook until all done.<br>  or<br>  Download ASAP Utilities from <a href="http://www.asap-utilities.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.asap-utilities.com/</a> <br>  and select their free version, it has a facility to amalgamate many workbooks into one, but I haven't used it for a few years now.

You can't put an Intel CPU like that Q8200 on an AMD motherboard.<br>  <br>  And the X48T ATI Crossfire board is a complete waste of money if you are going to use an nVidia video card like the 9800GT on it.<br>  <br>  For your Q8200 CPU and 9800GT video card, the best Elitegroup mobos you can get are:<br>  <br>  - PN2-SLI2+, which is an nVidia SLI motherboard if you want to add another 9800GT in the future.  <a href="http://www.ecsusa.com/ECSWebSite/Products/ProductsDetail.aspx?DetailID=702&CategoryID=1&DetailName=Feature&MenuID=44&LanID=9" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecsusa.com/ECSWebSite/Product...</a><br>  <br>  - P43T-AD3, single-slot motherboard if you aren't going to run two 9800GTs in SLI:  <a href="http://www.ecsusa.com/ECSWebSite/Products/ProductsDetail.aspx?DetailID=946&CategoryID=1&DetailName=Feature&MenuID=44&LanID=9" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecsusa.com/ECSWebSite/Product...</a>
XA4Sa81Xaa	Need more info. You didn't say whats the error on your laptop and what is the set up in your home network.<br>  <br>  1. How does your sisters laptop connected to the internet? Via wireless router or via wireless connection to your fathers PC?<br>  <br>  2. If your sisters laptop is connected to your fathers PC and NOT on a wireless router then it your fathers PC wireless connection can only accept 1 connection at a time.<br>  <br>  3. Third, who did the "wireless set up" on your home network? You should ask the person.<br>  <br>  4. If you got a wireless router and your fathers PC connected to it by cable and your sisters laptop wirelessly then check the wireless connection if it has security, if it has then you need the password for it (to put it in your laptop)<br>  <br>  5. Make sure your laptop wireless connection is working.|`|OXrFIq2haa	Have you ever setup a wireless connection with router before? <br>  If not, you have to configure your router to utilize the wireless connection and also enable things like encryption. <br>  Once done on the router, you have to set the same things up on your wireless card in XP. The encryption key must be entered correctly otherwise you may see the network.<br>  <br>  Check your IP address to make sure you're getting an IP from your router.<br>  <br>  Goto Start -> Run -> Type CMD & hit OK<br>  Type IPCONFIG and hit the Enter key|`|dfTQCf5saa	On my laptop, i found a switch on the side of it that turns the wireless on and off.<br>  Look for it, because I had the same problem but all that had happened was that I had knocked the switch!!<br>  By the way, your laptop is the same as your sister's yeah?<br>  And is wireless enabled? :P<br>  And you have ALL of the stuff you need. :P<br>  Just look for a switch thingo, it helped me heaps!

Often there are spam messages with links - these never bother me, but I feel sorry for the silly people that believe when the shops or computer suppliers advertise 'We recommend XP' or 'Vista' - because they ONLY say that because they're paid!!<br>  <br>  Microsoft have a history of sucking at this kind of thing, and everything they do on net sucks big time. The only thing they do well is use their money to buy ideas and stop developing them.<br>  <br>  Try using Yahoo, and set up a Yahoo profile - they work quite well.

But my guess, if uninstall it, your shared files and smileys will still be there because its already loaded to your documents, but not quite sure. You can try it at your own risk. I haven't done it yet. im searching a way to do so before i'm entirely sure that it wont remove my stuff. by the way, to uninstall it, in the 'add or remove' thing, its called windows live essentials. hope this gives you some ideas and make sure you are confident that your files wont get deleted.<br>  <br>  Update: I finally found out how to uninstall it! First you have to go to "C:\Program Files\Windows Live\Installer" . Then click 'wlarb' and choose uninstall. choose to uninstall messenger and there you go!

SkpRC2Nmaa	Try to write an algorithm on a paper and then you can write the code on java<br>  <br>  In mathematics, computing, linguistics and related subjects, an algorithm is a sequence of finite instructions, often used for calculation and data processing. It is formally a type of effective method in which a list of well-defined instructions for completing a task will, when given an initial state, proceed through a well-defined series of successive states, eventually terminating in an end-state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as probabilistic algorithms, incorporate randomness.<br>  <br>  A partial formalization of the concept began with attempts to solve the Entscheidungsproblem (the "decision problem") posed by David Hilbert in 1928. Subsequent formalizations were framed as attempts to define "effective calculability" (Kleene 1943:274) or "effective method" (Rosser 1939:225); those formalizations included the G?del-Herbrand-Kleene recursive functions of 1930, 1934 and 1935, Alonzo Church's lambda calculus of 1936, Emil Post's "Formulation 1" of 1936, and Alan Turing's Turing machines of 1936–7 and 1939.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm</a>

Key index #1 means to get the first key.<br>  <br>  Your router manual should explain how to find out what security method you are using and what they keys are (they are unique for every router). <br>  <br>  Once you have that either use your MAC user guide or google for instructions on setting up wireless on a MAC.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

The popularity of Linux distributions as desktop and laptop operating system has been growing lately due to the rise of netbooks and the Ubuntu distribution of the operating system.<br>  <br>  Most Linux distributions support dozens of programming languages. The most common collection of utilities for building both Linux applications and operating system programs is found within the GNU toolchain, which includes the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and the GNU build system. Amongst others, GCC provides compilers for Ada, C, C++, Java, and Fortran. The Linux kernel itself is written to be compiled with GCC. Proprietary compilers for Linux include the Intel C++ Compiler and IBM XL C/C++ Compiler.<br>  <br>  Most distributions also include support for Perl, Ruby, Python and other dynamic languages. Examples of languages that are less common, but still well-supported, are C# via the Mono project, sponsored by Novell, and Scheme. A number of Java Virtual Machines and development kits run on Linux, including the original Sun Microsystems JVM (HotSpot), and IBM's J2SE RE, as well as many open-source projects like Kaffe.<br>  <br>  The two main frameworks for developing graphical applications are those of GNOME and KDE. These projects are based on the GTK+ and Qt widget toolkits, respectively, which can also be used independently of the larger framework. Both support a wide variety of languages. There are a number of Integrated development environments available including Anjuta, Code::Blocks, Eclipse, KDevelop, Lazarus, MonoDevelop, NetBeans, and Omnis Studio while the long-established editors Vim and Emacs remain popular.<br>  <br>  As well as those designed for general purpose use on desktops and servers, distributions may be specialized for different purposes including: computer architecture support, embedded systems, stability, security, localization to a specific region or language, targeting of specific user groups, support for real-time applications, or commitment to a given desktop environment. Furthermore, some distributions deliberately include only free software. Currently, over three hundred distributions are actively developed, with about a dozen distributions being most popular for general-purpose use.<br>  <br>  Linux distributions have mainly been used as server operating systems.|`|LM1RD7uQaa	Linux  is a open source operating system . ie its  free and mainly  uses free application software.<br>  it is based upon theunix operating system <br>  its free from the virus as  virus attacks the .exe files and it don't have any .exe files ..|`|suxunLtLaa	It is much more secured than others like windows <br>    & its free . <br>     its main use is that u or ue company can alter this OS according to use . <br>    If u want to add some type of extra work , then also u can do so|`|0f945921bed325532d373f0bafa2764eaa	ask what is not possible in linux ..<br>  <br>  that is more better|`|1AxfEJBGaa	Linux (commonly pronounced IPA: /?l?n?ks/ in English; variants exist) is a generic term referring to Unix-like computer operating systems based on the Linux kernel.
