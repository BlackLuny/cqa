6k8GJBRPaa	I would start easily, not more than once or twice a week, but I would try to make a longer call and make a personal conversation. Maybe you can ask him, after a couple of calls, if he calls tomorrow again. Is there also a chance that you're going to the US or he's coming to the UK?|`|27MZpZrBaa	Sounds to me like he is attracted to you, but realistic to know a relationship "across the pond" is likely to fizzle.  My advice to you is not to "wait" for anybody on another continent.  Get out there, live your life in the UK.  Keep in touch with this other guy though.  Ask him where he sees the relationship going if you are gutsy enough.  Sucks to be back on the market again, doesn't it?|`|YzKRUniLaa	why not use webcam and skype
ee2ce7f4a4671d3a72fbfecf0348ee49aa	men are easy .. just say hey how you been?  Its been a while what up in your life?|`|uEs7n7xgaa	say "hey stranger"|`|OE8r1VtRaa	just say hey, long time no speak, how are things? something simple to break the ice :)|`|ecb41de6b1cd7b5071902909f6a45435aa	u  just start off with hey remember me..."saw u here it'll be good to catch up...."|`|KBU2X921aa	I would just talk to him as if you haven't really met him before. Go from hey, its been a long time since we have talked. Maybe say a few memories you have had that you remember and then talk as if you just met him. Just small talk for the time being and maybe if you two start getting closer maybe get into more interesting conversation. Something to maybe spark a good talk about the past or something. Its probably been a long time since you two have talked and starting off by just talking about old times just will make him want to continue that distance.
GSOYYSUGaa	It might be different for gay guys but when I was in high school and older men tried to hook up with high school girls it was usually just for a piece when they needed it, but hopefully that isn't the case.|`|izbAdDUraa	Maybe he feels he wants to nurture your brother? Some relationships are based on "fixing" the other person or the need to help. I dunno its weird. But if you ever sense your brother is in harm, talk to someone.|`|WWNWtzvDaa	the mans name isnt GARY GLITTER by any chance =?|`|kiJUCYMcaa	u lost me, there is ten years apart, right, well i always say that age is just a number when its like five years but ten, i dunno....soz|`|ZJohgu1saa	Maybe ur bro has a nice personality.. and good looking too.  i think most gay guys are good looking.|`|WFFXHFfVaa	Your brother is of legal age now, so I think age is just a number, there was 10 years between me and my hubby, and made no difference what so ever. And just cos your brother as a disability dosent mean it wont make him attractive to anyone.|`|883gTDBsaa	i don,t know maybe love. well maybe u could answer this what does a 31 yr old guy find attraction about a 16 yr old girl and she has a learning disabilities too of age 10 yr old. if u can answer will both know i am talking about my sister here. so i cant really answer your question sorry cos i am shocked my life.|`|3VCG0p3haa	I am 18 and my boyfriend is 28. He is not anything to write home about but i do love him and he loves me. The company, friendships and laughs is far more important than the age gap. Ok some i cant condone if they are under the age of consent but if they are old enough and mature enough to make that decision on there own then the world is there oyster.|`|Q33dbzAdaa	Technically a 17 year old guy can be more hung than a 40 year old guy and twice as hard. Just like a 17 year old girl can be twice as endowed as a 40 year old woman and be twice as firm.    Sorry, I didnt want to go there but I'm laughing too hard not to.  Its one of those paradoxical things.     As long as he is over the age of consent, I dont see an issue but you said he is learning impaired and has an illness. That means society will never pay him a large salary. He is smart hooking up with a successful guy. Smart. He isn't so impaired after all. All society would give him is a $700 social security check and a 1 room apartment in a slum.|`|QK4Yzp83aa	it's not any of your business really he's old enough to do what or who he wants regardless of age, money or anything else.
eZltpbHeaa	I love passionate women !|`|KuWLNfYbaa	i was married to an unpassionate woman for many years and now have a passionate partner,i prefer the latter|`|zOIgzIy4aa	yep that,s the kind of woman for me, it,s the best kind.|`|NG4E7pbuaa	Absolutely...that is one of the most attractive traits in my eyes.  Passion is the drive behind her and establishes who she is and her independence.|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	Yes very much so.|`|ichCJlWyaa	Hiya Princess.    This isn't such a straight forward question to answer !!!    I would say most people want to share their life with a partner who is passionate about them - that's a no brainer. Its the "other passions" that can cause problems.  For example, not everyone is passionate about their careers (like me) and when they end up with a VERY passionate person in that regard - it often causes problems.    And what if the love of your life has a passion for breeding hamsters ???    Passion is a complicated emotion - However as long as you remain passionate about making the love of your life happy - passion can work.    I probably sound like a Vulcan but in my case, passion is always tempered by logic... and im not saying thats a good thing.    Its just the way it is.    Still there are times where passion ALWAYS wins through - but thats private. ;) x|`|KBU2X921aa	Very much so. Someone who is not passionate about life are usually the ones that don't have the life that they want. You this trait describes you, then whoever you end up meeting is a very lucky man.|`|QVEHBMp3aa	Yes    A person without passion is.. Well.. Is an Emo!|`|ZJohgu1saa	Good Question :-))|`|6JPiNGdfaa	yes|`|fug6NLOkaa	yes without a shadow of a doubt. passion is a trait that appeals to me most in women.|`|AA10971621	For sure i would i love women like that , you sound like my type :) .|`|AA11203798	yup, thats the only kind of woman thats worth anything, As long as shes a rampant, screaming, gasping, sweating, frantic soul, screaming in ecstasy, and howling for more ............and thats just when shes cooking my dinner................as for bedding, well now, thats beyond words.|`|iDqVy21gaa	God yes!!!!!!!!!      Lets trash the hotel and break all the beds      : )    If your really a Princess?    Mum and Dad can afford it can't they?    x|`|K3snVnk7aa	yeah, but not too much gotta have a little UMp in her lol|`|tkSzObmQaa	Passion is a admirable trait.  I wish there were more passionate people, it would surely  turn this superficial world upside down.    Don't change for anyone and find yourself a like minded mate...|`|t5hp4t79aa	I think everyone wants someone passionate and everyone wants to be passionate. Those who lack it are probably depressed or lost. Those who don't want it in their partner are probably controlling and insecure...    Be passionate, it makes life beautiful....|`|dfNVERxzaa	Yes, is the simple and easy answer ....but as usual, there are always add-ons regarding local - personal - circumstances in these things.    You state, > Once I give my heart (has only really happened once), it is forever..     'Passion' is noble, very, but it can depend upon for what it is targeted on and how it is driven too.  It's target could easily be a bone of contention ~ it could get in the way of a relationship ~ and can be very exhausting.    So, although my answer is a yes, it does come with reserves too.    Swanlight
izbAdDUraa	I think I am unattractive and guys still hit on me, so, no... i don't think thats the case.   Maybe you are just not approachable. People used to tell me (after becoming friends with me) that they thought I was a snobby b**** at first, but I'm not, I am just shy.. sometimes it can come off badly.  Check your body language, make sure you are smiling (or at least not frowning or scowling all the time) and have a good aura about you. People will flock to you :]|`|e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	It could also be how you project yourself.  How you present yourself to others.  It's not always the attractiveness it can also be your aura the vibe you give off.  If you have a serious look on your face or you're always smiling.  If you're happy and peaceful inside, that's what comes out.|`|icTmbLjfaa	I'm in the same boat honey....I'm not talking to no one and nobody has hit on me in months! But ppl ask me all the time if I model or tell me that I am "fine" or "sexy", Maybe you have an intimidation factor like me(Ppl often think I might be mean because I don't smile alot)|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	Maybe it's your facial expressions or clothing. There could be a hundred reasons other than looks.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	maybe it,s because your too attractive and they think they don,t have a chance with you so they don,t even bother.|`|AA10986891	I could have nothing to do with your looks. It is about the way men percieve you, if you are shy and really serious all the time guys may percieve you as unavailable and uninterested in male company.    You have to hint them that is ok to approach you, smile at them when you notice they are looking at you. Try to smile more and watch your body language, like having your arms crossed when you are in public, avoiding eye contact, looking distracted and distant. If you change all of this things I bet things will change for you, not immediatly cause it takes a little time to change the perception you have created of one but things will change.|`|S5x6KNHraa	if u feel that way change your looks|`|0d4X54rMaa	look in the mirror.. what do you see?  do you think you are?  you know better than anyone here on yahoo that answer|`|x02jsjg6aa	Of course it can be assumed.  Unfortunately, it's not that simple.  Attitude and the way you carry yourself play a significant role in whether or not members of the opposite gender hit on you.|`|Ls1oc5syaa	no if your a girl then u definily have someone out there thats attracted to you...there is always someone for someone|`|JlDcVTVsaa	maybe you are not easy at all, and it scares them?  they are afraid to start it because they think you will get upset, and reject them?    I would just say, you should take it abit easier, and be less serious and see what happens.    good luck|`|T3nxSbZwaa	Nope - I would feel that I was coming across as unapproachable, or intimidating.  Maybe you should smile more... it's the same as kids in a playground - the one with the most friends is the one that can have fun by themselves.     I agree with the last comment too - you are in total control of how you look, maybe try a different 'look'|`|wl8EXWwqaa	Of course I would feel unattractive - any normal woman would!  But don't let that get you down - too many great movies where less than attractive girls/woman have revamped their appearance.  So, if you are heavy and think that's it - lose weight but lose weight for yourself - you wanting to look and feel better ABOUT yourself.  How about your hair?  Need a new do?  Do your homework before going to a new stylist then splurge to afford him or her. When done, if you like it, take a picture so that if you can't afford to go back you will at least be able to show a more reasonable stylist what you want.  How about clothing?  How are you dressing?  Polyester or slinky crap is not good.  Spend money on one or two really good pieces or suits and accessorize - don't want to look like Ugly Betty or Brittney.  You can also get free fashion advice - with an appointment-at many of the up-scale department stores.  Bottom line - everyone has a chance to remake themselves every day of their lives. But again I stress that you do this for yourself.  If you feel better about yourself it does radiate.  Unfortunately the opposite sex is always attracted to looks first and personality second so work on your personality and let your feeling good about yourself shine through.  You go for it for yourself!|`|70ViG4aMaa	I personally think that I'm ugly or what not. It shouldn't be about weather a girl is ugly or not. If you find a guy that's worth anything, he should like you for who you are, not any other way.|`|HgaiSaMRaa	you might be intimidating to men, or you might be a bit too 'pally' with them so they might only see you as a friend.
IOQshyGMaa	I think so! I think it's sweet that she's lowering her school standard to speak to you! =]|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	Plain and simple, you're the man. Good job, just finish reeling her in.    That means Yes|`|S5x6KNHraa	yes she likes u
f8ON3dRfaa	If this isn't the first time he's not helping you out at home, then it's natural you get irritated.    But if this is the first time, let him know that you get off work 2 hours later than usual and yet have to make a trip to the store and it's tiring you out and perhaps you don't wish to cook anymore. (Never complain about his freedom as a student and his obsession with his PS3 for it will only make matters worse)    If after sharing with him your tiredness and he seems nonchalent about it, start getting irritated!|`|a24940a45d48e8ea1965febacd1bd09daa	i think he might have just missed your hint about him going to the store maybe next time just ask him|`|rsIyLZHKaa	lol well i will make u dinner the next time hun .he is a couch patato.dump him .|`|C9845Dzvaa	That's something you need to work out with him, not post on Yahoo Answers|`|VKcbyyoPaa	It's understandable but you gotta realize guys are clueless- you gotta ask or else it wont even cross his mind.|`|Aoj0qVvsaa	Let the little things go. To many arguments and relationships have suffered due to little things like this. Was it rude? Yes. You can talk nicely to him and tell him that since you were working late it would have been nice of him to offer to pick up the items and to be respectful of your job and time management. If you do it without nagging you'd be amazed at what can be accomplished.|`|3Qxqh68xaa	You needed to say "I need you to go to the store and pick up...." Guys need more direction than that.|`|SmFVG8eXaa	Depends.. If this is always the case you might wanna think about discussing this with him.  If it's something that will drive you crazy forever, you might want to re-evaluate the relationship.  Maybe he doesn't realize what he is doing and how it affects your feelings. Sometimes you have to be very straightforward with guys.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	sounds as if he is using again or has a new love, definitely something he wants to hide. yes its okay to peek, so u will know the truth, right now your not snooping because of his feelings, but its your life, and its always best to know instead of being in some denial.if he is not answering his calls, there is something wrong, something he is hiding. if this man is nothing but a bag of troubles, why would u still want him?|`|AdIrjmV7aa	He didn't answer because the calls are from his other girlfriends or drug dealers.  He wants to have it all and is using everyone. Dump him. You are just another person to be used.|`|K3snVnk7aa	sounds like its someone he dont want to know hes talking to or he dont want the person to kno whos calling him hes with u, next time tell him u dont mind if he talks then if he still dont u shud look    ; )
dcouvjuKaa	I had the exact same situation - this girl I liked so much was still in love with her ex, they eventually got back together which resulted in me being hurt. I still am now and it just takes time to get over things. The fact that I don't see her anymore helps, but it doesn't stop me picturing them together. You just have to move on, in my situation I have two choices 1. I can move on 2. I can continue to think about her all the time, continue to contact her, pine over her - but I would still end up without her.    My advice would be give it a good few months, don't contact him and don't see him. If you still feel the same after that amount of time then you have to do something about it. As long as you know you CAN do something about it if you're feelings don't stop then you should feel a little better about it. Hope this helps and good luck :-)|`|1wdcprkGaa	Look it will always hurt you but somewhere out there is somone who is going to step up to the challenge to make you the happiest person in the world jus keep ya head up everything will be jus fine =]
zKjgWdqAaa	What don't I like!  I love the whole package - the way women look, the way they smell, the graceful way they move.  I usually notice eyes and smile first, but I love beautiful long hair, and I really enjoy a nice smooth skin tone, no matter what color.  But I also appreciate the shape of a woman.  Nice breasts of course, nice butt, some shape but not too big, shapely legs, nice arms, graceful hands.  Some stuff that people might not mention that I really love are a woman's cheeks, a shapely neck, and her little belly.  I love the soft pubic area, and I'm crazy about nice collarbones.  Like I said, the whole thing!|`|IVjspiStaa	eyes.|`|rPbyDmjYaa	Boobs....sorry I gotta say a love boobs on a woman, and their lips.|`|YSzNTo4Haa	i know guys love the vagina|`|zRvt68ZYaa	I'm a guy...  Every part of a woman's body is beautiful. God did great work! I'm especially fond of pretty hands and feet.|`|7e4jxj3Daa	I'm a guy and it's a woman's legs that drive me wild.|`|A5gfxSyzaa	I'm a woman.  I like how soft a woman's skin is and how good they smell.|`|4WOCDS9taa	well im a gurl but i guess the top haha|`|tU7JVMinaa	her heart and her eye and her smile|`|QGuxbItCaa	I am a guy and I like everything about a woman's body.|`|vs8xxWEnaa	I am a guy and personally i am an *** man, but the **** are great too|`|FORX7yfQaa	I'm a guy and most of the times i look at a girls butt and boobs first.  I don't try to be perverted but that is just nature.  After that though i look at the face and the entire body. The butt and boobs aren't the most important but they are nice to have.|`|blgRK8Ebaa	I'm a guy -- definitely eyes|`|uzcK1k9faa	I'm a girl and my boyfriend loves my fat feet|`|eYuIsNk1aa	her naked is the best but I'm a butt man   must  be heart shaped with a little bubble  not bug  but not to small but she need to have boobs to can't stand flat chest|`|xQKhzvEaaa	you're wrong.  it's the eyes and the vagina.|`|Q33dbzAdaa	I am male.    breasts are my favorite.   Butt if she doesn't have big breasts.|`|NqK4vgVPaa	i'm a girl and i read your other question about the kissing stuff and something similar happened to me and i'm trying to figure out how to make it go away (for me, nothings wrong with it) so i'm trying not to look at other girls body's but i think boobs catch my eyes first and then the butts....i also think nice curves on a skinny girl are gorgeous, they drive me insane....
wRdESMOOaa	Definitely not! A relationship can never be built on terms and whims of one of the partner....and yes,if it went kaput once,YOU BOTH MAY HEAD IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AGAIN...and the way she is PRETENDING she has moved over you,she will never respect your feelings even if you two date.I would suggest you to be happy with yourself...PEOPLE ARE AND CAN BE HAPPY ALONE IF THEY LOVE THEMSELVES..choose a hobby,start writing a diary or something...let time take its course and one day,you will definitely get the one meant for you,not this pathetic girl.Yep,dear,get going...life is not meant for ONE person!|`|Vmim6dv0aa	Maybe she is just testing you to see how much you will go through to be with her, considering you were the who broke up the relationship.  You also have to remember it has been a year so each of you may have changed in some ways.  It also depends on why you broke up with her, if she cheated I would say move on.  If it is something that could be fixed I would say maybe.  Your best bet is to just stay friends with her for now with no expectations, hang out with her on a regular basis and time will tell what you should do.  Besides friendship is the foundation of all good relationships.|`|iG0nAZKGaa	No I'd say you should move on ,doesn't sound like she's serious about you anymore.In time you will find the person who is right for you.Have to be patient though.|`|e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	He's hooking up with other guys but it doesn't mean those guys are getting some.  She's probably looking for compatibility, the one who share the same views of life and shared meaning.  Seems like a quality girl to me and that's why you want to get back with her.  Sometimes people just have insecurities to deal with.  You have great expectations of each other and they weren't fulfilled.  She wants to see other other people so let her be. She probably wants to test if she still feels strongly about you.  She's letting you date her, take it or leave it. Maybe she's also putting you to a test if you're a changed man.
c22c8f9d77d6ed911976dd38531a7aa7aa	Ok well my best friends had the same problem. She didn't know what to do but what I told her was to follow her heart if she's your real friend she'll understand that you really like this guy. I mean you shouldn't worry about it if she says she's ok with it. I mean my friend took the advice and now she's happy with her boyfriend for already seven months.|`|icTmbLjfaa	It's not cool! I had a similar situation in high school and she went on and on about how she didnt want him but when we finally got together she stopped talking to me. Then when I asked her why she stopped then she tried to say I was a back stabber......Not worth it, dont do it, find another person to talk to.|`|1wdcprkGaa	all you gotta do is sit down with both of them and find out if its worth it or not|`|T4t8rdTNaa	you should NEVER date someone that your (best) friend has dated before, that's just asking for disaster within your friendship...whether she said it was ok or not
8bWcUh3Zaa	naah...he is havin a fantasy abt ur body..Sayin I love u needs to hav that beautiful feeling of love...saying I love u without any feelings is of no use...better find a guy who really loves u n not ur body.|`|xN5QDXMmaa	Yes.|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	Sure, all night long!    Seriously, just ask him how he really feels.|`|wGw834Gkaa	Probably not, he's just playing you so he can get to the goodies.  Find a guy who treats you with respect.  You will see why this guy is such a jerk once you have something to compare it to.  He wants sex.|`|SvEt3d8Gaa	no he doesnt love u,he just loves ur body,,|`|QFf9phAmaa	sure ! he want your company.|`|AA12346188	May or May not.|`|3Qxqh68xaa	He LIKES you, but LOVES your body?  He's only there for the latter, not the former.|`|ABhmJepFaa	Yes, of course. Your body is part of you.|`|uPL3e3tyaa	Why can't a guy pay you a compliment without you trying to find fault with his feelings? Maybe he loves you and just wanted to let you know he found your body irresistable...we men aren't wired the same as women and don't always think to soothe your emotional self esteem before we say what we feel!|`|96ZfDF6Aaa	Loving your body definitely doesn't mean he loves you. Liking you is very different from loving you.  Whatever you do, DON"T HAVE SEX WITH HIM!|`|JjU6IdnDaa	It somehow suggests that this is all he knows about you.  Maybe you can help him learn the intellectual side of the relationship before presuming the privilege of intimacy.    Love is a personal attitude toward self.  He is really saying that he Loves himself to treat himself to being intimate with you.  Pay attention.  Guys think similarly but different from girls.    When you are with a guy you are really treating yourself to intimate pleasure of the company of a guy.  He will never know how or what you feel.      This is an entire realm of knowledge that few explore and therefore most misunderstand.  Get to know yourself first.  Become your own definition.    It is not about him.  It is all about you.|`|a1dpU3JMaa	means he doesn't love you he only loves your body|`|2mFfhIxOaa	I don't think he is a nice person. He is only interested in your body not in you.|`|8SihHDdGaa	yea or no i think its yes|`|VSb6S6muaa	the "love" & the "like" should hint something to you.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	Love is a strong word. If he like your body he does not love your personality. Love should have been for your personality.|`|rnL04k7waa	It seems to me that he only wants to have sex with u.|`|0fkOnfbMaa	Of course he may like u too. Why girls r so narrow minded. I said same thing to my gf but to be more frank i like her more than her body.|`|iTJ2YIH5aa	so who r "you" by the way..|`|un55SR95aa	like u but also love ur body. so body does not constant maintained. i think u need good person who like ur feelings. and also interested in sex with u for life time. i think u want to find out.|`|AA11636892	not really
cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	She's clingy because she's afraid to lose you...and getting clingier because she's getting closer to losing you. If you're going to break up, do it sooner than later. It's going to get even harder in May. I feel bad for her but you also have to do what's right for you. If you're not happy, you can't stay.|`|YAwvszITaa	Just be honest with her. Don't lead her into thinking there is a chance of being together if there is not. That will of course only cause the situation to be more painful. She will be crushed but she will get over it break ups are a part of life.|`|0Dbjv10iaa	Lol. Just tell her dude. She knows its coming and that's why she's clingy. Watch it though. She might go crazy.|`|SmFVG8eXaa	You just need to tell her.. It will hurt more for her if you string her along and cheat on her.

Short sweet and to the point. In this type of situation I like to do it at a time and place where the other person can leave right after the talk so wherever it is just make sure she drove to meet you. Be nice and understanding and just tell her how you feel. Don't say it's a break or give any other inkling you might get back together in the near future unless you really mean it. Clean Break.|`|JBLcMQ9haa	There is a huge world out there! If you don't see her as "the one", then why the hell are you wasting your time! Cut those ties and live your life. Don't let her hold you down. Get that degree and move to where YOU want to move. Get the job that YOU want to get and live the life that YOU want to live. and then, when you're ready to settle down, the right girl will come along for you. Don't just settle down because she wants you to!|`|c64339464988241688f21fe6fe705dcbaa	dude ask for some space and try not to hurt her to bad    she is probably clingy because she is in love with u|`|Aoj0qVvsaa	Then don't lead her on. She'll get over it. Not only that, if you've been dating for quite some time, it would do her good to find out who she is without you. Sometimes people need time to grow on thier own and if you both love eachother you never know, you might find your way back even if you don't think so atm.|`|Iq1R5ehvaa	dont be an ***...  just break it off and don't lead her on.   congrats for graduating!|`|0n0zw1Sfaa	call her a W.hore..|`|ee2ce7f4a4671d3a72fbfecf0348ee49aa	just tell them asap ... it is going to suck no matter when you do it ... but make sure you really want to leave her ... don't drag her on and don't cheap ... that can really mess someone up|`|a53jsAKGaa	Ive been on the other end here.   She probably feels clingy because shes scared when you go graduate youll leave her behind. However if you really dont want to be with her anymore, your going to just have to tell her. Tell her why, so in the future with new boyfriends, she can try not to be.|`|skYAEp5kaa	Graduating college in the spring as well, and got out of a serious relationship a few weeks ago, I can relate, only from a girl's perspective.  I think that my boyfriend felt the same way, he wanted to break up to go see what else was out there, but he didn't want to hurt me or himself either.  I think that if you are having doubts like this, and you see her as clingy, then you should end it.  You're probably pulling away more because you want to see what else is out there, and that's causing her to cling harder.  Let her go, and yes she'll be sad and devastated, and you'll probably feel like a jerk, but she'll get over it and so will you.  Don't lie to her to make her feel better, but just be honest and tell her you don't want to be with her because you want to be single as you graduate college.  Don't keep her around just to have her there either if you don't see a future with her anymore.  It's hard, but it will just keep getting harder if you drag it out longer.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Just tell her the truth. Don't lead her on. Tell her now.|`|A7lghafHaa	sit her down  man up  and tell her you want to break up  then go romp around until you find the one|`|Z0VvcKCraa	You could start by explaining to her, that at this stage, the relationship will take a turn that won't keep the two of you together.  She will be hurt, it must mean a lot to her, she's a younger girl who got an older college guy, she must be very proud of you.  You can't stop it from hurting but to ease the pain you could tell her that you don't want to hurt her, you could also tell her that you're life is taking a turn where you want to go out and explore the life you're starting.  If not, the best thing to keep in mind: Honesty is the key and Communication is the way!|`|810513944bc1fc28c514a617993b162faa	You sound lovely... You're dumping her 'cause you want to romp?    Let her down gently, don't bring up the fact you think she's clingy, especially if you plan on telling her why you're dumping her. It'll destroy her self esteem.    Be nice, and be quick about it. You're leading her on.|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	Then tell her now. It's not fair to allow her to believe she is moving on with you and she's not.
wl8EXWwqaa	you should have kicked her to the curb when the disrespect first started.  she should have gotten off her lazy *** and gotten a job - and if she already had a job then she should have kicked in $$ to carry you over.  a relationship is about mutual respect because all the rest of the stuff goes by the wayside.  anything can be worked out when you respect each other and like each other - love is a result of the first two - you don't love someone and hope they treat you right or help when things get tough .. you absolutely did the right thing and don't take her back - she already showed you her true colors|`|eSDNSq4zaa	sounds like you overreacted, she was just trying to make sure you had a job, guys are supposed to make girls feel secure and loved. you shouldnt be so whiny about a girl. like ur a guy? id expect this from a girl. who knows maybe you could have had a good future with her.|`|Aoj0qVvsaa	Kathy had it dead on. Dood... you did the right thing. She can't expect you to do everything. I wouldn't have married anyone like that. Move on and find someone who isn't so self absorbed and lazy.|`|dDGdKiOFaa	I think you did the right thing. How someone treats you when the chips are down is very telling. she sounds like a leach, and an ungreatfull one at that.|`|8KxurcApaa	I propose you close this thread now & give "Kathy T" 10 points!!!  I agree with her 100%.      Even if you were less than committed while looking for a job, you still managed to pay the bills which sounds like more than she has contributed.  Believe me when I say there are respectful women who can actually bring something to the table, and many of them are attractive as well!|`|SvEt3d8Gaa	same way as yu did|`|cG5wZOeBaa	Dude, you should never kick your girlfriend. Unless you're a pimp. Then its ok.    You're so going to jail.|`|DtEnHza6aa	JUMPED THE GUN..  Girls are always right.. even if you think they're not..  If she wants you to change.. just change man....|`|3Qxqh68xaa	When you were laid off you were still paying all the bills?  And where you not looking for a job and playing on myspace all day?  Now suddenly you have your job back  and can go back to being a responsible adult who pays their bills.  Ummm.. it sounds like she had every reason in the world to "disrespect" you.
SmFVG8eXaa	Sounds like there is some serious trust issues with your relationship.  I would say to end things if you cant trust him, or if he doesn't seem trustworthy to you.  You can confront him, but he may lie, get defensive, etc.  You need to think about what you want and see if this guy fits into that picture.  You deserve to be happy and constantly worrying that he's cheating doesn't sound very happy to me.|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	Yes, it sounds like he is cheating.  If this isn't the first time and you've confronted him before about it, it's time to leave.  No more confrontation, no more forgiveness, no more relationship.  Kick him out or leave and don't look back.  The man is scum.  There is NO reason for him to need to be out until 4am especially under the circumstances you have explained.|`|Yeswwb9Xaa	If you confront him, and he's got this completely elaborate excuse, he probably cheating! Guys tend to exaggerate when they try to talk their way out of a crappy situation. And if that doesn't work he will get aggressive and tell you to start trusting him more!|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Take the pictures, take him to court, get alimony, custody of the kids, and child support. He is a cheater and will never stop.|`|cq4ng6QLaa	Try to discuss your problems too him but if he doesn't change then you should know what you have to do.|`|3QiKTfqeaa	it cant get any clearer.. his actions... followed by souvenir pictures. I think its disrespectful. You might want to ask him point blank!|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	You should make sure of who the girl in the photos are before you jump him about it. You could come off looking very ignorant if it turns out to be nothing.    If he just met her then that changes things a little. Still a few pictures doesn't mean he's cheating. At a sports bar Sunday I had my picture taken with several women. My wife was there. I have no intention of cheating, they were just all in fun.|`|EBjyMCeCaa	Ask him.  Just tell him you saw the pics and ask who she is.  If your feelings are telling you he is most likely that is the case.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	if you saw the pictures then theres ur proof|`|6fa2568b75c06da2670c61858c9441ceaa	If you can't trust him, just dump him. He isn't worth your time.
dYRWG3WTaa	Aww, that is horrible! My daughter passed away 10yrs ago as an infant and even though I was in shock and numb and looked to be in another world for quite some time, I remember everything everyone did, every card I received (and everyone who avoided me too) I wouldn't answer the phone for a while, but having persistent friends, I finally did and I am very glad I did, their words helped a lot. definitely call her after the dust clears, I agree with everyone else who have suggested a plant instead of flowers. Send a card and tell her how much you wish you could be with her right now. If there is a specific donation they are requesting, it will be greatly appreciated too.   Send her and the family prayers from us Yahoo people!|`|Sjf112pKaa	They are probably going to get a lot of flowers and plants and food.    You could just donate (in your cousins name) whatever money you would have spent on flowers or plants to a non-profit organization relating to the babies cause of death.|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	Flowers would be very nice and appropriate, along with a sympathy card. I'd give her a call too after the dust has settled (but don't wait too long).|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	If you can't be there send her yourself how ever you can. Flowers or a plant is nice, I like plants because they continue to grow. But more importantly just be there for her emotionally as much as you can.|`|8lTjwBEzaa	pray that she gets healing and comfort her write her a heart felt letter and sympathy cards. OMG that's terrible babies shouldn't die.|`|wntdMR8caa	Send her a new baby. But really though, send her a plant, flowers die, and might make her depressed. Send her one that will last forever as long as she takes care of it. I know plenty of people with house plants 20 years old that they kinda consider to be part of the family.|`|lohDhzRzaa	send her some flowers or give her a call
5Slqssqoaa	gift cards    funny books    music    Something they collect    framed photos of you and your friend    silly games (like twister)    Add to your gift a mix cd of songs that remind you of your friendship.|`|2vPcn17Baa	coolers for guys and teddy bears for gals|`|XxGB4eGyaa	idk what the heck rupees are but...    teddy bears  makeup sets   purses   clothes and  jewelry are good for girls    guys idk|`|rZuSN2kTaa	gift cards with 100 each.  the boys... gift cars to gamestop.  girls...... gift cards to a store in the mall.|`|24fyNeyOaa	teddy bear|`|DtEnHza6aa	lol rupees :D yay from legend of zelda!!    umm    1. Wallet for guys  2. Tie for guys  3. Perfume  4. Shoes  5. Toy2R DIY    My favourite is the Toy2R DIY where you draw on a 3D Canvas toy|`|4IFXHz80aa	what about a small scrap book. take pictures that youve collected and make little books for your friends. youll only have to spend money getting the supplies for the scarp books. you could also make mixed cd's. choose song that you and your friends made memories to. i would suggest being creative than just spending money on things they can buy themselves.
bID1Pd7Gaa	Maybe it's because you have no name!|`|9DQDFiLuaa	yeah death is right|`|3Qxqh68xaa	her birthday probably has nothing to do with it. why dont you just ask her?|`|wl8EXWwqaa	have you ever met this girl for real?  If she isn't texting you then you need to get the message that she isn't writing ... find someone else to bug!  If she replies because you've sent something to her bet she is just trying to be polite ... give it up - and why would her birthday have anything to do with it??
f8ON3dRfaa	Let him insult you until you've finally decided you have had enough and move on.    Don't expect him to change for the better. Although you deserve better.|`|A7lghafHaa	he is a LOSER!   you deserve better, much better  move on and never look back|`|8rLH4YNsaa	It aint your fault at all. This guy is a jerk, trying to be cool...hes trying to be somebody hes not. And when that all falls apart for him hes guna come running back to you, but your guna have moved on...right? :)|`|5r48jn7iaa	just let him go. you pushed him away so hes gone. but maybe he misses you too and he'll try to talk to you. but you could always try to talk to him first. if nothing works just forget about him.
m009tscZaa	I think the girl is pretty shy man. First make sure that she doesn't have any boyfriend. If she has, then u r out of luck mate. But, if she's clean then, by the way she's behaving, she's just trying to judge what kinda person u r and to know if u have a strong personality. So, if she trys to observe u next time, don't look at her at all and just try to ignore her as she does to u. No figeting........just stay cool and act normally. Women never like men, who is melodramatic. Then, speak to other girls while she's watching. Don't flirt, just maintain a friendly attitude. As for ur reputation, come on yar who's perfect in this world. Proposing to a girl is not a sin. If at all, they make fun of u, just tell them, it's ur own life and keep the **** out of it.  Well if she doesn't turn up in a couple of weeks just forget her and think that she's not worth it.|`|2NDX7cSsaa	She said let's be friends and then stopped speaking, right? You do not deserve a girl who doesn't keep her word. I can't blame her for refusing (she may have had her reasons) but this avoiding thing is going too far. On the other hand, maybe she can;t feel comfortable around you anymore. I know I wouldn't.                                  But I too agree with the others. drop her and move on. Trust me, there are plenty of better girls out there. But if you still want to be friends, then I suggest you act super- casual. Talk to her, but don't push. Don't even suggest meeting anywhere and don't even have lunch together till she's absolutely sure you just want to be friends (assuming that's what you want).                         Personally, I think you ought to forget her for what she's worth. don't flatter her ego by paying too much attention.|`|jtvhleWuaa	i m not agree with others answers ....i dont think so that u have to drop her friendship...i think just do as ur heart says ..if she is looking or noticing to u more...may be she is of very shy nature so after ur proposal she has started to neglecting or avoiding u...but i really think that she loves u right now but after refusing u she is unable to say that thing again..i think this valentine u can try again...and always hear to ur heart...bcoz u will get answers from other persons as they are saying from their mind...and this question is related to ur heart so listen to ur heart ............best of luck|`|izbAdDUraa	just play it cool.   but why are you even worried about it? she turned you down and straight up AVOIDS you? Move on. Focus on someone who is actually interested in you.|`|rZuSN2kTaa	let er go.  she's being stupid.|`|Pe1gHUMbaa	I have to agree with the others. Girl can be so stupid. Just let it go and move on. If she actually does want to be more then friends she'll get jealous and come around. I would say watch your back though.|`|GC2kBuEhaa	If she is avoiding you but at the same time is observing you then maybe she is buying time to get a clearer picture of you, the real you. Avoid talking to this girl for a while. Let her get back to normal and you too be calm and natural. Carry on with your daily activities and do not flirt with any other girl in your office or you will lose any chance that you have with this girl, as it is pretty evident that word reaches pretty quick around in your office.    good luck!|`|RhPiUrxDaa	hey she is actually loving u da ,since she is lovong she wants to know ur reactions after her action that's why she is watching u ,i think u are lucky .as a girl i have also scolded some boys after their proposals but i have minded about later ,but this girl likes u that is why she is longing for u .have a good married life with her da
VSb6S6muaa	breathing through your nose works.|`|UI79JnJVaa	"I breath through my nostrils,   and keep my eyes closed."    "I have the Lady breath through   her nostrils, and keep both of   her eyes open, while kissing."|`|M0GoGVHXaa	I breathe but lightly ...I dont think i could hold my breath lol|`|eSDNSq4zaa	its called breath in through ur nose?|`|Aoj0qVvsaa	Breathing heavily actually increases the taste buds and gets the mojo working. It gives more oxygen to your body and increases the sensations. Breathe! Always breathe!!|`|91OVJtgPaa	BREATHE!! But through your nose. They secretly like to feel the heat of your breath upon them!
fbc51fefdf8f90a690cd87fb91f16194aa	Start giving him oral as you already do, and instead of finishing him that way, start intercourse instead. Then he'll definitely be in the mood so you don't have to worry about being turned down.|`|VSWl45cKaa	Trust me, don't worry. He already indicated he would be receptive so go for it It will be a nice but slightly different aspect of your relationship. Most (if not all)  guys love it if their partner comes on to them......Go for it.|`|fMEypXDYaa	Just go ahead and say what your thinking, as time goes on, you will get more comfortable with doing it as you learn more ways to initiate sex with him. Ask your gal pals how they do it to get their boyfriends to respond sexually to them, see if you get any ideas from them, your not the only woman to feel shy about this.  Bet you was shy about just having any form of sex at one time before now, and see how you got more comfortable with the act as time went on, same thing for saying what is on your mind.|`|IOXJdCvSaa	Well, dont be afraid    Be creative and tell him what you want him to do to you|`|0fVtHNtmaa	He wants you to initiate it so he's not going to turn you down. Just suprise him with a random bj out of nowhere or bend over and back up to him playfully. Lapdance him while he's sitting on the couch.|`|AsFiWxhUaa	guys think about sex like every 30 seconds so i doubt very seriously he will turn you down.|`|keEfXfg8aa	slap him around a bit. get some jumper cables and put them on his nipples.|`|Aoj0qVvsaa	Do what men do and think about sex every 5 mins or so. You'll be so hot to trot that you wont care about anything else lol. You've already answered yer own question. He loves having sex with you. Period. He won't turn you down, trust me. Have some confidence and the rest will follow :)|`|1wdcprkGaa	go with the flow and have fun dnt be worried about it|`|tJel8yiFaa	Figure out what you think you both would enjoy, try something a little different (role play maybe), have a drink if it helps, then go for it.    The guy is asking for more, you are willing, nothing to be afraid of.    Good luck, and just keep telling yourself you have one lucky guy .... cause you do.|`|nwNkXEO3aa	Usually, a person fears because it's the first few times that they are doing it. Hence, since you and your boyfriend have done it a few times already, just initiate having sex a few times. After those few times, you will not feel scared anymore. Since he always want to have sex with you, there is a low low chance that he will reject you. Just be confident. You can do it! Just imainge youself in a flirtish mood. Enjoy having sex!
qDpFSqn4aa	There are too many things that could cause this.  The worst would be that he's found someone else and he doesn't have the balls to tell you (let's hope I'm wrong on this one).  He could have other pressing matters or he could be in a hurry to get to class.  Too many things could be the reason. The best thing is for you and he to sit down and talk about EVERYTHING.  Communication is the key to every good relationship, without it there can be no trust.    Hope this helps, good luck.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	He's a gutless wonder who wants out of the relationship and lacks the decency to break it off honestly.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Beat him at his own game. Do to him what he's been doing to you and see how he likes it. Then find you a man who will treat you right!|`|sCr2iTczaa	Either he could be going through a tough time in his life and doesn't want to be bothered or he could really not be interested in you anymore. I know when i stop liking a guy i tend to start ignoring them because i just don't know how to say i don't want to be with you with out hurting someones feelings. I think maybe you should make him sit down and talk. and if he wont then you need to let him know that he can't keep treating you like this because you didn't do anything to make him act like this right??? so let him know that he can't keep ignoring you|`|QE2GKQWkaa	He thinks he is too cool for you. Break up with him because he is acting like a "bit**".|`|IOXJdCvSaa	Break up with him  **** it he doesent wanna treat u rite, why would you stay to be ignored?|`|5r48jn7iaa	make him talk to you. or maybe hes just a little too immature and its time to break up.|`|SmFVG8eXaa	Confront him and ask him what's up? Tell him you deserve the decency to know why he's ignoring you.  And remind him that you're mature enough to deal with a breakup and are not interested in playing these childish games.|`|f5be9151ad367e7746c827fa94f8d3e1aa	i think you should stop talkin to him. Because i think he like the attention. But if you stop talkin to him if he loves u or woteva he will try and find out what is the matter with you ..     Hope this helps you     It always works for me|`|RrkwM6lCaa	the truth is...He is not happy with your relationship anymore and he is just shy to break up with you...maybe he is doing this for you to notice and break up with him...at least he still respects you for that matter...|`|Mgk7Cjp2aa	ignor him to and act like u dont even care it works all the time|`|RXRmRmqpaa	Ask him if there is anything upsetting him, is there anything you or anyone else has done to upset him, or is there something worrying or bothering him. If the answer is yes, then you can begin to sort this out, depending what the problem is. If the answer is no, then the conclusion would be that he is too gutless to end the relationship with you, so just finish with him. If you continue to let him treat you like this he will eat away at your self esteem, until you start blaming yourself when it isn't your fault. Good luck.|`|A7lghafHaa	move on  obviously he is an immature twerp who dones not have the b lls to speak to you  you deserve MUCH BETTER!    how would you feel if your daughter was being treeated by some nothing like that? yeah that's right you would not like it  so dump him and get a better boyfriend and never look back  he doesnot know how good he had it
SsfnitjXaa	No you should not call him, no he is not remembering this as you anniversary, no he is not thinking of you.  Move on honey.  Once a cheat always a cheat.  You did the right thing.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Don't call that cheating scumbag!  You go out with your girlfriends tonight and have a blast!  The best revenge is moving on and not looking back.  If he thinks he has a chance with you still, he might try to get back with you.  What would that tell him?  I'll tell you what it would tell him - it would tell him that you are ok with him cheating on you.  You sure don't want that.  You did the right thing by moving on, now you just gotta stay strong.  You'll thank yourself for it later.|`|4rCmYe1Aaa	If you're not with him, then there is no reason to call. It would just be awkward. Move on.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	why the hell would you call somebody who disrespected you by cheating on you? he didnt think you were good enough thats why he cheated.|`|lohDhzRzaa	i think you should call him up and tell him what has he been up?  then ask him if he remembers what today is...  good luck:)|`|MOALoKWdaa	if ur not with him then theres no anniversary.....|`|EhTgzrXNaa	i don't think you should call him, he cheated on he, so maybe he forgot the anniversary, and is enjoying his time with the girl he cheated on you... don't call him, act like you don't care or forgot that is it your anniversary.....if he care he wouldnt have cheated on you... and be with you to celebrate the anniversary...|`|Sjf112pKaa	ugh. Obviously he wasn't thinking about you when he was cheating on you and he won't be thinking about you now.     It would be a bad idea to call him...it would only make things worse for you....at least you found out what he is before the relationship could get any deeper or if you were to get married.
a61d29f848346a3a635d768e9c48bb90aa	i don't think it's cheating.  if he is letting you listen to the messages on his phone and it's only about her getting a job, then that's all it is.  it doesn't seem like he's hiding anything from you, so he has nothing to be guilty about.  it's okay if you don't trust her, to be honest i wouldn't either.  but what counts is whether or not you trust him.  i don't think he's doing anything.|`|1BGwGFQZaa	Breathe and Take Control of The Situation!    If this lady is calling catch her and talk to her on the phone. Be calm and collective during the duration of this conversation. Advise your husband that you feel much more comfortable coordinating jobs and other information that these ladies have to dicuss with him. Other than that if she is not mom or sis or grandma she should not be calling. If the callin persists do some investigating till you get a straight answer.|`|XzHjeFKYaa	GO with your feelings. If you asked him to stop, if it was nothing then he should stop for the respect of you. But there must be something if she keeps calling, it would be nothing if she didn't call. Does he hide it from you, and you find out.. or does he talk to her in front of you?  Does he go into another room to talk? He is letting the girl know that it is okay... that is why she is still calling.. so she stopped calling for a while.,.. Whit just happened that made he start calling again.. or did it never stop.. Girl go with your feeling, it is the WORST feeling to feel stupid, that you are there for him in every way, and he is doing what ever in the hell he is doing,,, he has no respect for you and yalls relationship.|`|3zm0jA0yaa	I can tell your womens intuition(spelling?) is kicking in and you have every right to be concerned. Every question you said your husband SAYS shes asking could be answered by someone else other than another womans husband. And calling him at home is a brazen act on her part! She is trying to break you two up. That's her goal. She wants him for her own, and letting the cat out of the bag will allow it to happen. He is making up some very flimsy excuses here. You should be seeing straight thru them and I think you are. If hes not cheating then he is very close but I'd say he already has done it. You don't have those uncomfortable feelings in your gut for no reason no matter what he uses as an excuse. You know in your heart when that danger bell goes off. And you are asking for advise from strangers now to confirm it. You already know. The next thing is to have him followed by one of your friends. Let them borrow another friends car, and when you think he's going to meet her have them follow him to see where hes going. Nothing is too far out there if you have that gut feeling This way you are at home and he has no idea hes being followed by anyone and will feel comfortable enough to relax and screw up. If he is cheating you can find out this way. Its just too hard wondering. Good luck to you and tell her to stop calling "your husband"!|`|izbAdDUraa	women have ulterior motives.. more often than not.   maybe you could try talking to the woman yourself and express CALMLY and MATURELY that you don't feel comfortable with her calling/etc so often and would appreciate if she would stop.  Or have your husband do it. But either way, it should stop. Its just trouble in the making.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Is he happy with you?  Are you taking good care of him?  Is the physical part of marriage still good?  If so, you can and should pressure him firmly and persistently to get this woman to back off.      If not, you need to focus on him and you because if it was me, and I was frustrated with my marriage/sex life and my wife was pressing me about another woman I would ignore my wife.  And I have never cheated.  It is a simple thing though, if you are making him happy you have the right to press, if not, you don't.|`|SsfnitjXaa	Call her and tell her to use google search for any information that she may need and tell her to stop calling YOUR husband.

That would be the most important question.|`|AA11356977	My ex was cheating with the girls he was suppose to be JUST at a study with. Who can tell if yours is but chances are he is.
6EztfzkEaa	A simple "sorry, i'm not interested" always seemed like the best choice to me.    Seems like women don't like to use this approach....I don't know why.  I mean, it's honest, direct, to the point, and it's very formal.  It's not even rude.  I think women don't use it because they think that it's mean.  Well ladies, coming from a man, that's not rude.  That's honest.  Men value honesty; Men dislike games.  Don't play with him, as he definitely won't take kindly to that when he figures it out.  Not to mention that you may inadvertently lead him on.    Honestly, honesty is the best policy here.  Good Luck.|`|Bc5v99Zfaa	Its pretty simple really ...just say how you feel..|`|cmFU81rQaa	Be honest with him.  He won't be confused and you wont lead him on.  Better for everyone.  Don't lie or sugarcoat.|`|BgYWhOyAaa	stab him in the testies and watch him bleed, while lafing manaiecly...  DO IT!!!!  Please??!!?!?!?!?!|`|l60zgb1iaa	If you and him are friends then you should feel comfortable hanging out with him and just be completely honest. I think that it could maybe hurt him more if he really likes you and then you lie to him, you could lose him as a friend also. Just tell him that you think he is a great friend but it's strictly platonic and that you would love to hang out as friends whenever.....I hope i could be of some help...good luck|`|POHWTDPRaa	Tell him you're worried dating him would wreck your friendship.|`|Z0VvcKCraa	Right now you aren't ready for a relationship but you are open to all the friendships you can get.    YOu could tell him that..|`|wGw834Gkaa	If he hasn't asked yet how do you know he is going to?  Seems you are putting the cart before the horse.|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	What could it hurt to go out with him? My wife was a good good friend before we dated. She was my best friend then and she still is today.|`|fQ3AKGKxaa	OMG DONT TRY it if you dont like him in that way just tell him u wanna be friends u will only hurt him down the road.|`|napgiSmXaa	Hi Emmaelctric       The best way to deal with this chancer, is to be straight to the point, you think he's a good laugh and really "SWEET". " How ever I don't wont to get involved in any other way.  I don't fancy you, sorry!"        All said in your sincerest voice.  If he's got anything about him as soon as you say you think he's sweet he'll know what's coming  next.         He'll get over it easier than you will if you mistakenly, date him or worse.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Why don't you go out with him and see if there's anything there?|`|7VUkNBDGaa	Tell him how you feel.  Talk to him about it and let him know that you guys are just friends.  I already know that he will be disappointed , considering i have been through the same situation.   Continue to hang out with him.  good luck.|`|MoLQsZeXaa	sit down and talk with him why are your reasons that you don't want to go out with him ?|`|Iq1R5ehvaa	there are 2 ways to deal with this   -the chicken way- put him in the "Friend ZONE." do lunch dates, and talk with him about all the guys you are interested in.   -the brave way- wait for him to ask you, and then talk to him about it.   if you really value his friendship and he really values you, then you will be able to talk with him about it and he will be able to listen. don't expect to be buddy buddy immediately afterward, give him time and he will get over it.|`|5Slqssqoaa	Be honest with him. Be kind.     Tell him upfront that you value his friendship, but you don't see him as a romantic interest. Tell him why he is such a good friend.     I once told a friend I was interested in more. Before I said anything I prepared myself for losing his friendship. I also realized that I wanted to keep him as a friend.     He let me down gently. He told me how much he values what we have already. But also said that he wasn't interested in taking it to the next level. I was hurt. I cried. I thought about cutting him off. And then I remembered why I was so attracted to him. Years later, he is one of my closest, dearest friends.
vja4ddNmaa	I do not understand your usage of the word "bad", so I will omit the 1st three words of your question when taking into account of how to answer it.    Women really want it when they are 34-40.|`|Z0VvcKCraa	There is no certain age.....people are dumb.....it's when you're in the mood.  Kids start very early or very late...|`|Gburbcuiaa	I'm 20 and still don't want it.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	i was 17 when i got it. it is the best feeling in the world to share with the one you love. we have it a few times a day|`|WVvfmw2Iaa	dam most girls want it at the age of 16 and up but i hadn't Had sex jet so yea im waiting for the right guy|`|cDRXtuJCaa	I think underage sex is awfull most girls regret it,I sorry mike but this question is badddddddddddd|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Women reach their sexual peak at 30.  It depends on the girl though, some like a lot and some not so much.|`|I6zUkFtfaa	Depends entirely upon the girl, just as it does upon the guy. Not everyone reaches sexual maturity at the same age...|`|qaD1jAQYaa	I was 14, but it depends on the girl. I've known quite some who didn't feel like doing it at 18, it's something very personal. As for me, I don't really need sex or want sex, but I also know people who slut around all the time when they have the chance.|`|uNplLsZqaa	It depends when there hormones start to develop. I wanted sex at the age of 11, And Its quite a strong feeling. Sometimes it like you really need it, Like NEED it.|`|1mKmshvXaa	Geezus!! 13??? Wow...    Uhm....it depends on the girl and bad they want it. like for me, i dont want it until im married, but a girl i know at school, i know she wants it BAD and she's the same age as me. So it all depends.    Geezus... 13.....    ~Mattzzie|`|nwNkXEO3aa	My gf and I had sex when we were 20. It's so awesome! She told me personally that she feel great having sex with me. I felt awesome having sex with her too! After that sex, both of us just couldn't stop and we had another few sex other days again.    As of when do girls want sex, it depends on individually, because some may not be as open as others. And if only I can meet you, we can have sex together. You seem open.|`|Hwh7Brq9aa	Obvs it depends on how horny they are. The age varies for girls who want sex but they tend to have morals nowa days and want to wait. Girls like to be respected not walked all over and treated like a whore. so if your looking for a easy ride i suggest you go buy a day rider from your local bus station =]
RQrFOF14aa	It really will turn me on when I feel your naked body and boobs... on me.|`|AA10250079	i think, yes!|`|TzDvl1CUaa	well yes|`|uNJirnYoaa	yeah, i'd be turned on. we'd then go to the bedroom.|`|GdBrrevBaa	It would "turn" me on. Maybe even if she rubbed a little bit too. For most guys, i would say yes. It just gives us a better feeliing of the girls breasts and the guy starts to use his imagionation. Once that happens, then he starts to get excited, even if he's a real nice guy who wouldn't think about doing anything innappropriet with that girl. It's a guy thing to be honest. the only answer i can give you is yes for most guys.|`|kz9O7QKwaa	Yes. Headlights!!!! Mmmmmmmmmmm|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	probably|`|uQKTFPvnaa	Depends on the body underneath the shirt... you know what I mean?|`|y9CgveCGaa	I don't let myself get turned on unless the woman is my wife.|`|sM6d8ZgWaa	It would be a 1 armed hug. The other would be under you shirt :)|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	I don't know. I'm not a hugger. I'm a big fan of personal space. I prefer to only hug my wife. But it does turn me on if she is dressed like you explained.|`|HnGAxJ2uaa	uummmmm.  thanks princess...|`|omfSAeBjaa	positively, absolutely|`|7ewzmiNEaa	Hugging a woman with or without anything underneath is a turn on !|`|ULVT2NbSaa	Your best answer....       Yes It Would Very Much. But If Would Really Send Me Through The Roof If You Were To Hug Me Tightly Wearing Nothing At All........  :-)                                                   Hello Princess.|`|QCkanmR9aa	Yes it would yummy.But still have a warm heart?|`|gLqX7TG0aa	yeah it would|`|2b39e12aad73ae2fda69e018286d6baeaa	probably, but to sure, why don't we try it and see,  i am available most evenings.
bID1Pd7Gaa	You need to set rules before you even go out. You need rape counseling, you're not going to find that on yahoo. Seek a qualified therapist.|`|hXFndli2aa	Honey it okay, I can totally understand where your coming from. Im not saying its your fault, but next time you need to take control of this kind of situation, you need to put your foot down and tell this guy it was not okay to come onto you to strong. Your gonna have to confronthim and i know that most of us would rather avoid confrontations, but if you don't confront him he is going to think that it is okay to do that to you. You need to stand up for yourself or noone else will. GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|gLXzVbm8aa	you need to find another job. it is dangerous to be so close to him.|`|EmMxNWyLaa	he probably thought you wanted him, or , maybe he hasnt been with a girl in awhile, give him a break.|`|JYyOjAqdaa	1)  You werent raped.  You were sexually assaulted.  2)  You have issues that should probably be worked out with a therapist, cuz it seems like there's a bit more at work in ur subconscious  3)  Confront the dude, i know its been a while, but im sure that a swift kick to his ball sac would make u wanna go out and start  boning people again :]|`|FkdEyXudaa	LEAVE! GET ANOTHER JOB! MOVE IN WITH YOUR MOM! WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET AWAY FROM HIM!!!  Answer mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|g2XbXYyraa	lol owned|`|HLlWCilNaa	You are very lucky. Some girls are date raped then get AIDS or something horrible. I'm sure you'll be able to trust guys in time. May take a while, but you will. You'll also learn to be extra cautious around them. Oh, and you should report your trainer guy.|`|DABa3Cjyaa	Wow, you got your self in a pickle. Just cancel your gym card and go to a different gym. OR tell him how you feel|`|keEfXfg8aa	first of all that isn't date rape.  second go get another job  third quit you rwhining, a lot worse has happened to women    for instance i knew a girl at the age of 8 tht got molested(that means touching and forced sex) by her grandpa  i knew i girl that was raped my her own father  another one by her bf  and yet another one by a complete stranger at a party.     so yours is nothing to fret about. just get over it. and next time tell someone where you are and who you are with. and get to know him better. and don't lead him on by kissing. and scream NO.|`|XMsOHXROaa	Be more careful.  Learn from this and don't be so quick to let your self be duped into going over to your date's place.  More than likely, when a date (male) invites you over to his place, his hopes and desires go beyond just an innocent romp on Guitar Hero or Wii.    You'll just have to accept that this person is a jerk and can't be trusted.  Be professional at your job, if you are unable to get past the discomfort, find another job and quit the gym.|`|dcouvjuKaa	This is bad of him - i would confront him and say you're uncomfortable around him after what happened, he may apologise and you can clear the air. If not, your other option is to find another job if things get too unbearable.|`|v4D5pxh6aa	I really feel for you. What happened to you is so horrible. One thing you must do for yourself is get counselling asap. If you feel you can no longer work with this guy then you are 100% within your rights to speak to a manager or even go over their heads and speak to Head Office. You can make it as little or as big a deal as you feel comfortable with but please don't leave anyone make you feel like you were asking for it or that it was your fault in anyway...Please look after yourself now and F everyone else. Don't leave him take anymore away from you. Good luck. X
Slr6jtMGaa	Love is when you adore, can't think of no one else, can't stand to be away from them, would think you would die if something happened to them!!!!    But, there are different kinds of love....e.g. family, friends, and the one i was talking about IS your love....|`|nlQiRHRJaa	love is life ,if you have no love in your life you don't have nothing .  love is all ,love is the beginning of all|`|6mBrJ2EGaa	a fancy or a feeling|`|jd6XmIXtaa	Very hot sex 24/ 7
CItYLBibaa	well....Your definitely packin....Why do you think you need to preform better?  You know, believe it or not, you may be hurting your girl/s.  There is such a thing as too big for some girls.  The first thing you need to do is make sure that's not the problem.  Start off regular missionary position....If that doesn't hurt her, throw her legs up over your shoulders, if that doesn't hurt her, then shes good, and you're not to big for her.  Once you've determined that, be rough.  Trust me, all girls like it rough....Don't be too rough at first, cause some girls can only handle so much, but be rough enough that she HAS to like it....give it to her doggie style, then pull her hair a little, ask her if she likes it. get things heated up a little.|`|m1oaS5Xpaa	OMG!!!!! ALLaboutcha you are hilarious!! Wow! I almost peed myself i was laughing so hard! Good ideas tho..lol.|`|WFP46Ek9aa	email me       rustygirl_90210@yahoo.com  add ur y/a name too. it would help!|`|PhNzEkVnaa	You don't need a girl to answer the question you need a girl to motivate you to be better.|`|qaD1jAQYaa	That's...  25cm.    I'd simply die of fear if I saw that. XD   Seriously, dude, be careful with girls.
sGP6s7uraa	I had almost the same issue with my MOH.  She's pregnant and she's feeling that this is her time, too.  I would choose someone else as my MOH and have her as the first bridesmaid.  She's got baby brain (LOL) right now and you need someone else to depend on.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	It sounds like your friend is being a very good MOH despite all that is going on in her life.  I think she's got a lot on her plate right now, but is still trying to help you properly celebrate this big event in your life.  But she's having a big event too- a huge event!- and it almost seems like you expect her to let your wedding overshadow her pregnancy.  I mean, come on- she's supposed to be all excited about going to David's Bridal with you when she is getting to see her baby's heartbeat on a screen the same day?  It just doesn't compare.  As for being a friend to you, I'll just say this: Any woman who is OK with putting on a bridesmaid dress and walking down an aisle at someone's wedding just weeks after giving birth is a good friend indeed.  Relax and lower your expectations a bit- she sounds like a great MOH!|`|MkErhX7Haa	Ok, I really didn't understand the David's Bridal story, but I'll try to answer anyway.  You have already asked her to be your MOH.  Unless she does something really terrible to you, you should keep her as your MOH.      Try not to take the situation so personally.  Like you said, she will be having a child in May, which is a really big deal, and right now, that's much more important to her than your wedding.  I know you are excited, but try to understand that no one will ever be as excited about your wedding as you are.  Good luck with your friends.  I got back with my friends from high school 4 years ago, and it was difficult to start over at first, but now I can't imagine my life without them.
5Slqssqoaa	Move on.     I have become friends with ex-loves but never right after the breakup. Give him and yourself time to heal. A chance to form new relationships. Once you both are sure you can build a friendship without the hope of reconciliation, you can be friends.     Until then, stop calling. Stop talking about him to your friends. Accept that he is not interested in your friendship right now.|`|0Nfr3leOaa	yup  its True|`|MuflptJVaa	yes this is true.This is what i call "Men" syndrome.When a guyloves a girl and she doesnt want to "get together"  so he gets pissed off.Let Him be and it should calm down soon.|`|t1inn1nLaa	As a guy myself, I'll say that if he can be friends with you easily, that means he never really love you    he's hurting because he really love you. How can you be friends with someone you want so much but you know you can never be with her again. Every time you see her, you just wants so much more than friends but you know you cant    I don't really expect many to understand this, but... Not everyone can be with someone for one moment, and the next just switch on the friend mode and switch of the love|`|ocAHRPbUaa	i went through the same thing, i had a boyfriend for 6 months and we broke up 2 years ago, things are still really awkward between us, i think the fact that u guys were together and now wanna be "just friends" puts both of you in a really awkward stage, if he's ignoring you forget about him, let HIM call you, when he's ready to be friends again he'll show it, look for signs like him actually acknowledging your existice, or him coming to you for advice, just give him time.|`|BcrYBSJmaa	I think your friends are definitely right. He loves you and is probably hurt and feels like he's not good enough for you. I'm not trying to make you feel guilty about breaking up with him by the way, if it didn't work it didn't work. Give him time and surely, if you mean that much to him he'll want you as a friend, even if he can never be more than that.|`|iN0ljkRNaa	I agree, if he truly loved you it will be very hard for him to remain your friend. Even if you guys remain friends it will be very awkward for him, especially if you find someone else!
1fd011c04b7013be44a3fd5dc118bf7baa	own up to the fct that you just told her that hoping you'ld get into her panties|`|izbAdDUraa	castration?  seriously. you are a pig. you got what you deserved. now i suggest telling her the truth that you lied to her about LOVE just to get in her pants.  you do realize that there are plenty of women in the world to have sex with that you DON'T have to lie to, right?|`|AA10451072	You, sir, are an idiot.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Well maybe you sholdn't be going around telling girls that you love them just so that they will sleep with you. You know that is really low down of you. You should be ashamed and now that you slept with her you should at least give the girl a chance I mean come on...she was good enough to sleep with!|`|P4Jc76GPaa	You started it by saying you loved her. Now it's up to you to clean up the mess. Maybe you shouldn't say that unless you mean it. I hope she ends up being your fatal attraction for being a dim wit. Have fun.|`|sCr2iTczaa	Well you never should have been shallow enough to tell her that you loved her just to get her in the sack. Men these days just don't care about womens feelings. why would you tell a girl you loved her just to get her in the bed. You know you could mess some one up emotionally by doing that. I am a believer of karma what goes around comes around. Im not trying to be a b*tch to you at all. I am just trying to help you out i mean. Say one day you meet this girl and you are really interested in her. You like her alot and want to be with her. Lets say you ask her out on a date and she says yes you two go out and have a good time. Well lets just say she tells you she likes you alot and hopes to see you again. Well maybe you are trying to get a hold of her but she won't pick up. She ignores your calls and  ignores you most off all. How would you feel. You might feel pretty upset because the one girl you wanted to be with didn't want you and trust me that feeling sucks,. Imagine how she must feel thinking that you love her and you just wanted some neddin. Shame shame shame. But hey every man and women has their own thing. So do what you do|`|AtJgXB59aa	1st youre a common idoit and you shud neva do tht becus stupid things like thiswill happen now learn frm your mistake|`|tU7JVMinaa	LOL     you put yourself in this situation, get yourself out of it.  Using a girl to have sex is just wrong you know that.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	That's what you get for being a douche.  Live with it.|`|SmFVG8eXaa	Probably shouldn't have lied to her.  It sounds like all you're concerned with is yourself - Why didn't you stop to think how this would make her feel before you went ahead and lied??  Tell her the truth.  If she's willing to forgive you, then good for you.|`|JYyOjAqdaa	You told her that you loved her.  Next time dont lie.. Youre probably gonna have to break up with her btw, the sooner you start working on your excuse, the more believable its gonna sound :]|`|PhNzEkVnaa	Don't talk to her.  Don't text her and above all do not have sex with her.  End it.  Look after a text she's your girlfriend if you do anything else she is your wife.      You behaved like you ae desperate and so did she.  If you want someone not so desperate, try acting not so desperate yourself.|`|1UVgDk4Faa	dang dude, looks like you just bust your own balls.|`|cmFU81rQaa	natural consequences ********.  natural consequences.  you're a ******* *****.  good job.|`|KBU2X921aa	You are a complete asshole for doing that in the first place! I hope you get what you deserve.|`|nwNkXEO3aa	Do you love that woman? OR is it just because you wanna have sex with her? I guess, if you have feelings for her (be it like or love), you would probably won't mind as much if she says she's yr girlfriend. In any case, now that she goes around and says that you're her boyfriend, then it makes it easier for you to have sex with her,right?|`|DABa3Cjyaa	Just tell her things aren't working out, I didn't mean it like this. My feelings would be more hurt if I found out that it was a joke, so say "Look, Blake, We need to spend some time apart from each other." Even if she does slap you, its ok, its the first thing she things of. I hope you find Ms. Right |`|0pGoCQIHaa	you're a male slut and that's all i can say :'(|`|D3iXIgeNaa	You are so stupid. Have fun getting out of that one|`|BjNKpy4Eaa	Wow.    You are moronic to an unbelievable extent.    Did you not know that it would come back to bite you in a*s??    What you should do is just tell her the damn truth and accept whatever consequences that come out of it.    If people think you're a horrific human being for it, well, you'll just have to deal with that.    After all, they would'nt be too far wrong would they??|`|Wn7s2Rtraa	dont mess with peoples head for sex. thats gross

Jfo6XyAZaa	You need to sit down and make a list of what youd like to improve about yourself.  1) Buy new clothes  2) Go to Greggs with friends  3) Get homework done on time  etc..  Kinda like a to do list. Check them off when you do them. In general you just need some organisation. Write down homeworks and when theyre due in and ask for help when you need it, you may need to make yourself a time table leaving yourself enough time to do work.
YQ1Q7XeEaa	Listen - I have never understood girls forgiving a guy for being a player.    He only sticks with you for the sex you give him.  Sorry to be harsh but it's true.    If a guy lies and cheats on you - it's not your fault but his.  You can't change him.  He doesn't want to change.    If he cared about you he wouldn't have been with someone else in the first place.    He's a peice of human garbage drop him - you have now WASTED 3 years of your life with him.    Pick someone else who will treat you right.  BTW if you keep picking guys like this over and over then your "picker" is broken and you probably need therapy to figure out why you need to be treated so badly.    Sheesh!|`|Z0VvcKCraa	Girl the key word in this question is BOY, leave him and find a real man, one that can man up and tell you the truth as well as stay faithful.|`|Z1FdawAOaa	i understand where your coming from. i had the SAME problem with my fiancee, and i always told him matt don't lie to me because the truth always comes out. well it got to a point where i said listen buddy this is your last and final damn chance (i had given him MANY chances) if you screw this one up im gone. FINALLY he got the point. so just tell him straight up if i mean a lot to you you will stop lying and if you don't im gone. and if he does screw it up tell him he brought this upon himself ;)  good luck girl!|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Move on. Those things will always be in the back of your mind and they will eat at you. This guy is a douche and he will never change. You need someone who's going to be honest.|`|keEfXfg8aa	well there isn't really anything wrong. you guys were apart and he got with some chick. since you guys weren't together there really isn't anything wrong with it. but him lying about it is BS. forgive the hanging with his ex but not the lying.|`|8ENRWmoMaa	you seem to be wrapped around his finger, so let him cheat all he wants b/c you obviously will keep coming back to him.|`|C4VWBD6paa	i bet you strongly care for him because yall have been together so long but its time to let the past be the past.  dumb him....your better than that|`|MxHRjPFHaa	WEll as i always say about cheaters and liers...      first time is he's fault 2ed time is your fault..........  you should be done with him and if your not its all on you...be smart ther's plenty of fish in the sea I am sure you have heard that before|`|YVO3WyU1aa	Trust and Communication are the basic elements in any relationship.  Since neither are there my suggestion is to move on.  Good Luck|`|yWROYbZAaa	You should definitly move on. I was in a relationship like this and you come to realize that they will never change and you cant do anything to make them change. They are going to do what they want. We were off and on again for almost 4 years. It will be hard to get over him at first and he may come back and say he is sorry and he knows he did wrong, he may do right for a few weeks,but he will always go back to his old ways. Don't waste your time, there is someone much better out there for you.|`|QylxMcgTaa	MOVE ON!! if he's lied and cheated and lied and cheated then move on he's not good for you. you've givin him chance after chance but he just keeps walking all over you he's not going to change...|`|RQ9KdIwlaa	Already you had taken the right decision.

Ybo6HS8Caa	Depends.  How long have you been in this child's life?  Have you been caring for her financially, emotionally, physically since she was a baby?  If so, your odds are better at still being able to see her.  I live in the state of KS, and here the law is written that if there is a "father/child relationship", the biological doesn't matter.  Have you carried health insurance on her?  If you can prove that you have a strong bond with the child, and have cared for her as your own, the judge may agree that it is in the child's best interest to be able to stay in contact with you....and that is what will matter in the eyes of the court - the childs best interest.  I would definitely ask your lawyer about this, and I applaud you for wanting to continue your relationship with your little girl.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	That is so terribly sad. Losing a baby is a difficult thing and it can cause severe troubles in a marriage when not handled correctly.  Have you to considered counceling? She needs to hear your feelings and explanation of your actions without any fighting or arguing. A councelor can help you do this...she's clearly not understanding you and may throw away a wonderful relationship because her judgment is blinded by grief.  If she is your step daughter and the father has not been around, you've supported her entirely, etc. then you MAY have some rights to see her. However if he is in the picture then you will not have any rights but you can (and should) strongly request visitation through the court for the benefit of the child.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	No unless it is agreed by the mom|`|F4knwfVsaa	The courts will most likely decide not so please gather your thoughts make the right move and move on. The pain for you will get worse if you try to hang on. I don't know how your divorce is going Good or Bad? but most likely not good. At 5 years old you will be a distant memory for her she has no real strong bond that has been set in her mind (I know you love her dearly or you would not have asked this question) but move on for your own well being.  Good luck.|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	depends on how long you have been married.  Your lawyer needs to address this question.|`|89dbda5201b9cd4a4f9e174ecf63f9f7aa	Of course you do!  Make sure your lawyer puts it all into the paperwork for the divorce agreement.  You are divorcing the mother, not the child.  When you married, you took on the role of a parent.  It would be hard for the child to lose you.  We have friends that this has worked out for very well.  The children have their mother and new stepparent, their father and new stepmother, plus they have our friend, who was also a stepdad through marriage to the mother.  These kids are well balance and enjoy a huge family!  The parents all work together to make it happen.  If you are using the child as a weapon, please just walk away.  You will ruin her life if that's what you are doing.|`|uI4Dspi4aa	No, she is not your child|`|lM8kzsiPaa	Legal right, no.....maybe you and your ex can work something out.|`|aGOBuJtKaa	Unless you adopted her, No. But maybe your wife will allow you to still see her.|`|dSMb8JDvaa	You may need a lawyer if you are not her father..Oh dear you must love her so much. The best way is to talk to your EX..(future Ex) so you don't have to pay so much to fight with her (meanness) If I, I will let you see her. Good luck..for a good man|`|a61d29f848346a3a635d768e9c48bb90aa	technically no unless you adopted her.  but being that this is the norm these days, courts are trying to have the exes work something out with each other in some jurisdictions.  as they should.  at least you care enough about your stepdaughter to want to see her, and your soon to be ex wife should appreciate that.|`|BMEMH7JLaa	Everybody is right if you want to have a relationship with her you are at your ex'es mercy.     Please guide your actions during the divorce accordingly
yWROYbZAaa	He could be into you. If you get a lunch try taking it around the time he takes his....if this happens ask him where he is going for lunch and he may ask you to join him.|`|uNplLsZqaa	I saw thats quite sweet of him giving you that free drink and all :D But im sure he likes you in some way.|`|37ana68Haa	yea he is interested ether that or he just wants to be friends
YVJQ7Y4jaa	There are two types of abuse. Physical and mental. Not only is he abusing you he is abusing your children. There is something wrong with your husband. Abuse does not stop, it goes on. Possibly he was abused or came from a abusive family.   There are three choices you can make, keep taking the abuse, have him go to therapy, or leave him, but with an order of protection.|`|Z1FdawAOaa	he needs to take anger management classes before it gets bad!|`|cmFU81rQaa	Well, he may not realize the kind of affect this is having on you, the way you look at him, and your relationship.  I suggest you try explaining as you just did us.  Tell him he's hurting you, and emphasize how this makes you feel about yourself and about him.  and then tell him that just because you guys have started a family doesn't make you his to the point where he can just treat you however he wants.  He's got to treat you with love or it'll be au revoir baby.|`|7e7e66e61bc00173161b8dc44d25b035aa	Patient?  PATIENT??!?!?!!    Pardon me, but why the holy F**K are you being PATIENT?!?!?!    Just in case you haven't realized it yet, your husband is BEATING YOU!!!!    Why are you making excuses for him?  Sack up, grab your kids, walk out the door, and don't look back.  If you can't do it for you, then do it for your kids.....as living in a house full of violence and pain will damage them emotionally in ways that you can't even fathom.    You need to leave....and leave quickly.|`|N8tvMoqwaa	Get out, get out, get out! Do you guys have children?? Because if you do, then you shouldn't even consider staying because it's only going to get worse. I'm telling you, it's not going to work. Even if he starts going to counseling, half the people don't even learn anything from counselors because if he can't control himself being the grown man that he is, he will never be able to control himself. Either give me an ultimatum, or just leave him and I know it's going to be sad and hard to do, but we girls tend to forgive the people that we 'love' and hope to be the one who change his ways, but we need have more self respect. Good luck.|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Sounds like you Married the baby ..... IF it's broke and you like it, try to fix it... if it won't be fixed ... move on.|`|0Nfr3leOaa	sorry hun but i think he is abusing u mentally u should leave him before things get worse and take ur boys with you maybe to a woman's refuge asap|`|ERAvvezmaa	I am a christian girl.    And I know that god said to be loving to your husband, but he didn't say that if your husdand hurts you you should take it.  If you want slow action than pray for it.  If you want to take fact action than walk out on him for a few months and only come back if he bed.    Hope this helps.|`|YVO3WyU1aa	It is abuse and it started when he first met you.  Now it is escalating.  The steps to take are either he gets help or you start preparing yourself to leave.  good luck|`|2IuoHrjQaa	In answer to your question.. yes... you are being abused. The fact he blames you.. demeans you, and he is trying to make you feel guilty. Dont talk to him when he is angry, you will get nowhere, but when he is calm, speak to him. Tell him how he acts and how it makes you feel. Tell him that its not fair on you or him or the kids. He needs to sort it out. Go to conselling and find out the true stem of his anger. If not, then you need to walk away from him.. why? ... because if not addressed..... it will get worse... dont be a statistic.
SS1FFafRaa	what's worse?    well, I guess the bottoms.    tops you can see at a bar.  bottoms you usually can't.|`|vffZ3is4aa	you can flash me with both . then i can tell you which is best.|`|2b39e12aad73ae2fda69e018286d6baeaa	show me a picture of you naked and I will let you know.  or one of each will work too.|`|tJel8yiFaa	Flashing Bottoms would certainly seem to be more complicated.|`|Z1FdawAOaa	if you flashing someone and not married to them? yeah thats not good!|`|fHfVRcqbaa	Neither are appropriate.  I would say for a guy, it would be the bottoms that are worse, obviously.  For a female (come on, she's not a 'lady' now is she?) it would be either.    I don't think that any married person should be flashing anything to anyone unless you as a couple are okay with it.|`|HnGAxJ2uaa	flash me and i will let you know right away...
SS1FFafRaa	You'll loosen up eventually.    It can't hurt forever.|`|Wn7s2Rtraa	yeah. go for it.|`|SsfnitjXaa	If you are very short there may very well be a problem.  Time for him to move on and find a better fit.|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	Honey, you will get use to it.... But then no other man will satisfy you, you will be ruined.  So either marry him, or walk away.|`|66l0BPhaaa	no there is not, but there is a suck thing as girl replacement surgery! what you can not take, someone else will.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	No.  If a baby can come out of your vagina, then he is not "too big".  He may ruin you for all other men, though.    Lube lube lube!|`|0d0W0nbVaa	yeah.  it's called 'bobbittecetomy'|`|GeruGGOQaa	Not one that most guys would be willing to have.|`|DABa3Cjyaa	Omg, ewwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|uI4Dspi4aa	Does HE know you are looking into chopping off his manhood?|`|BfmV2KpUaa	I'm sure there probably is, but is there a sane man on the planet that wants such a procedure ?|`|HnGAxJ2uaa	yeah, it's called marriage.
E2OKRhwYaa	Ignore the things they say and ignore them, haters aren't important.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Blogging about my feelings helps me get over stuff. So if you have a 360 you can set your blog to private and go to town. Also removing myself from the presence of people who act like this helps so I don't have to keep going through that pain over again. Also remind yourself--and tell yourself in a blog--that you are what you say that you are, and no one can detract from that. It's what you say about yourself that matters the most. =)|`|c3Dhkvvoaa	just kind of get over it... i know its hard but Like you have to just ignore it. make them think that you dont care and they will stop cause it takes all the fun out of it :)|`|2N5qCHKDaa	my best bet is just ignore it. i went through something sort of like this but all i did was ignored it. if it gets to bad like physical abuse then maybe you should consult somebody about it. if they are just being mean maybe they might possibly be jealous? i am not sure what this will help but i hope it works out for you in the long run|`|R5pBAyMMaa	I know what you mean, i hate it when people act fake..they only do it because there insecure about themselves, and i know everybody always says that, but it's the truth. i just ignore it and move on. life is too short to waste time on those types of people.<br>  Hope i helped and good luck.|`|xDJISO81aa	punch them in there mouth|`|DTGZJ8T6aa	you realize that everyone has talked about someone behind they're back, you probably have to, and even though we know it's wrong we do it anyway and there's really nothing you can do. it just helps you realize who you're best friends are|`|AA11202193	i would jus igg it cuz u shouldnt hold grudges
RjpPzbBJaa	Personally I would already feel incredibly low and ashamed for breaking my vows and being with another man. Even more so if I didn't admit my wrongs and apologize to my husband.  Then on top of all that, see the poor guy when I was with the guy.... its just adding insult to injury. You really beat him up pretty hard.... I feel terribly sorry for him and hopes he realizes its not his fault at all, that he did nothing wrong.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	"hello Mike...  meet Fabio".    why is it so hard?|`|YTasscmKaa	I'd feel like the complete dung heap that I am.|`|AA10986891	If he is not over you he will be a jerk about it, but onlu cause he is still mad and hurt. If he is a gentleman he will wave and say hi to both of you.|`|b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	Ex-Wife:  She would feel she had to hide, get out of there, avoid any fight    New guy:  Getting ready, defensive mode, torn between "Just let him hit her once and I'll kill him" vs "Just let him hit her once, and maybe he will calm down after that"    Ex Hubby:  Shake hands with new guy, invite him onto the equipment hubby is best at. Exercise the new guy so tough that he will have cramps and sore muscles for a week and not be able to function in bed|`|TfijWwsYaa	Sounds like you already had it girl.|`|HnGAxJ2uaa	feel lucky your ex did not physically go after either of you|`|ze7xiJwTaa	I would feel like shxx. I'm on the other side of that and I recently ran into my ex and his (19 years younger) floozy at a 10k race. It was horrible, at least for me. You should apologize, let him have some closure.|`|OBCvewW2aa	If I left my husband for another man, I'm sure I'd be so head over heels in love with my shiny new man that my old man probably wouldn't even register on my radar.|`|Bc5v99Zfaa	Never cheat while you are married and happy ,then this wouldn't be a problem. When a marriage is over it isn't cheating! I think this is drawing the line pretty straight .|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	I'd feel terrible. I was on the other end of a situation like that and it hurts like hell. My ex husband never apologized or asked for forgiveness. It would have been nice if he had but I'm happy now. If I hadn't caught him cheating I'd probably still with with him. I'm very happy and been in this marriage for wonderful years. I should THANK him.

Some florists will work with a small budget and others have $3K minimums. DIY is probably the cheapest route.

The lady is Theresa. It's a very small shop in down town la but she really does work that looks like it's worth thousands more contact me if you need her number don't want to post it on here.
bID1Pd7Gaa	No, and I don't like you either.|`|6zVISNTZaa	It sounds as though because you're both freshly out of long term relationships, she doesn't want to rush into something that could become just a rebound fling. I suggest you get to know her socially like this, eg. going for drinks etc, and wait a little while to see what becomes of this. It sounds like she likes you though, women work in mysterious ways!|`|yWROYbZAaa	Yes, she sounds into you. Since you both just got out of a long relationship she probably wants to take it slow.....she has been with that same guy for so long its different being with someone else. She will come around just keep hanging out and show her how sweet you are and what you have to offer and she will open up more.|`|FkdEyXudaa	Yeah she likes you, she just doesn't want to get hurt again, show her your reliable and a good guy.  Answer mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|Hwh7Brq9aa	Shes just got out of a relationship so shes obvs just wants to take things slow and make sure she dosent get hurt and just generoly get to know you better. im sure in time she will be open to a relationship with you. just dont push it. remember youv just got out of a 7 year relationship, you think thats not worrying for her!?     just keep it cool, ask her to go out to cinimas just casually, but b carefull that you dont let your relationship develop in to a friendship.|`|wRdESMOOaa	Yep...she does like you.Go slow and respect her feelings...you two can HEAL and COMPLETE each other...to see if she likes you,ask her advice and help on you dating a really worthless girl(someone known to her) in her opinion (which of course would be a lie) and note her eyes and body language when she reacts.Good luck!|`|ge5x9NHxaa	It's really love.  She loves you no doubt about it.
KBU2X921aa	If you really need help i would suggest getting professional help (counseling, social worker, etc) These things you keep in your head seem more of a mental problem than anything but nothing to serious.
46FJSnw7aa	Well I would definately say he is interested, he just doesn't want to cheat on his wife or make problems with his wife.  Obviously he is going to act professional on an email because there is a chance there for him to get caught.  I bet he has feelings for you too, you just have to give it time.|`|9m9gGtfaaa	He is married, Yet, he still takes advantage of you, a student of his.    What does that say about him?    In fact, if he is reported to the DoE, he will be charged,|`|2b4OFx5Oaa	First off, yes, it's because it is a school email and that holds up in court very easily.    Wake up Sunshine! What do you think will happen? He will leave his wife, sleep/date with you for a while, ditch you, then you will claim he violated the teacher/student relationship but since his emails show no violation and the so called "tight hugs" are all about interpretation you walk away used and looking like a home wrecker.    There are millions of guys out there, leave this one alone. Best of luck but if you stay the course I guarantee it won't end well.|`|QFfewAywaa	hmmm well 9 years apart i have to tell you i have this guy i like and we are 7 years apart but i honestly think he is interested and he is probably professional on e-mails because you can't be to personal with a school e-mail if he really likes you and you guys build a really good relationship and he falls in love he will leave his wife for you so be careful but at the same time keep him close and interested keep him chasing!|`|AA12203640	LOL! I'm in the very same predicament........a little different in our ages than in your case....  I'm a university teacher, 29yrs old, she's a student in the same university 22yrs old.  There is a strong magnetism  between us that is difficult to deny.  We have strong communication outside of school and in fact, we totally ignore eachother while we're in school.      Look, if he has a family, wife and kid,....then you must be strong and leave him alone.  If he's single, and so are you....and if you both have the maturity to handle this situation, then go for it. Otherwise,, it is off limits.      And don't listen to the world as long as you're both legal (and single).  Trust me, America is not the end all, be all in moral and ethics accountability.      Good luck and follow your heart.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Ya, he's interested - in cheating on his wife with you.    Dump the loser.|`|6rR7LTl1aa	Sorry, girl, but you certainly can help your own feelings.  You choose who you get involved with and to what degree.    He's into you (for now), and his wife is onto you both.  Why wouldn't she be upset?|`|wzXJOSIeaa	WOW...I know that sometimes teachers can be very attractive. It's like that authority just turns some people on. But you are only 19 and he is married. I kind of don't know what to say because I'm sure it's very exciting to be with him and have that little fling but trust me in due time you will get over that and find someone your age that loves you more than this teacher ever could. And just remember if he did it to his wife, he can do it to you! Best of luck!|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	My interpretation of his actions is that he isn't interested in you sexually or he would have invited you over to his place after he told you his wife was out of town. Perhaps he was waiting for your reaction to that statement.  Sorry to say, but that was your golden opportunity to seduce him, the door was wide open  and you whiffed. The next time you see him in person you should tell him how you feel. He may be hesitant due to the teacher/student connection. One thing for sure, his wife is onto you, lol.|`|FyhzmgRUaa	it does sound like he likes you.|`|Kvajun9yaa	I think you shpuld just have fun! =D like you said you are looking for a fun fling! and i think that he does like you but do not get your hopes up because i highly doubt he wil leave his wife! - good luck|`|0fVtHNtmaa	He's a predator and you're easy.|`|MxHRjPFHaa	I hope your not going to the same school as he is now..because he couild get fired for dating a student...if your not go for it he's married yes but he wants you dont expect a relationship out of the deal just sex thats all he wants and I think thats all you want am i right..let me know
55b6b6044398395cf0baf0b11b60ccf8aa	Sounds like this dude is a player. Regardless, seems like he's still hung up on his ex. If I were in your position I would move on and not look back on it.|`|1iX9BIUEaa	huh? get rid of Obama? not the time or place.HE WON,  so thats president Obama to you sir, and yeah the guy sounds like a chump.|`|iO34oQF2aa	i think he likes both of you, but still, i think you should ask him once, as to who is the girl he wants more, and if you are still not comfortable with him, or if you do not feel the same warm way, then just leave him coz its ur life, its your wish!!!!|`|YAwvszITaa	He is 2 faced. Get rid of him or else be ready for a lot more drama and lies. These things are usually a pattern. Did you ever ask him why he felt the need to even hang out with his ex? That right there is ridiculous.|`|mnQXmZbeaa	stay away from him before youre the next noch in his belt|`|jL9myhmqaa	is this ur bf..if so how old are you. people love drama|`|RVzec1rjaa	he likes you!!!!!  its not a crime to be friends with your ex.   they are like brother and sister now.  and you should go hang out with them  it would be fun for you.  go hang out with him. he will love you more!|`|Hwh7Brq9aa	Hes playing with your head, if i was you id tell him its either me or her. Then move on. Other wise im quite sure your going to end up getting played and hurt.|`|J3uudQobaa	THe guys is being nice:    1. probably because hes interested in you    2. is just an overly nice person to begin with    But in this situation it sounds like this guy isnt over his ex. I dunno how they broke up, but it seems like he's still clingy. He probably wants to move on to another girl like you, but can't because he feels too connected with his ex. Becareful not to fall for him easily.|`|5dx544amaa	Sounds like he can't let go of the ex. I woiuld stay away from him if I were you.|`|yRxOZ6Uqaa	Ohh, that sucks girl. He is just one of those a**hole guys who wants what they can't have. It's that simple but it hurts just as much.|`|zpLaunPMaa	maybe he is realizing that he wants you.   sure...the timing is off but those are guys. thats how they "roll".      maybe you shouldnt be mean to him. just  hang out as friends and if he wants more than take it slow.
aMZ7IKysaa	You are totally right.  Your husband is immature and needs to grow up.  Lucky enough for me my husband is anal retentive with bills and being on time, but he is also a money hog and likes to know where every cent goes, psssh.  You should insist that the bonus money go into the bill fund.  Tax money is play money.  Its so sickening though, what is he, 5?  You have to act like his mother you poor girl.  Give him an *** kicking and take charge!|`|QCmRRbABaa	You're right. Tell him what should be first, and what should be second. Be very clear, do not fight, do not yell at him. Once you finish talk, walk away, end of the conversation. Let him think about. He needs to learn to make responsible choices. Family finances is a matter of both, not just him.   You can learn how to take more power in your relationship from a book called Taking Power in an Abusive Relationship by Agata Campos.|`|7ewzmiNEaa	Tell him no Wii until ALL bills are paid and he can prove it.|`|66l0BPhaaa	i use to have that problem, i told my wife to take over the bills and now they are smooth. she tells me to pay online what we need to pay but she manages the budget. sound like his money is his money. he does not want to catch up on bills, but wants to buy a WII. I guess the tax money will be for bills or does he have plans for those also. take over and shut him the hell up.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I think you should use the money to go and meet with a financial adviser - it couldn't hurt!  Neither of us are great with money and the financial planner helps keep us both on track...we meet once a year to touch base.|`|ze7xiJwTaa	You are right.   If you are behind on bills they should come first, before toys. My bf is always scraping by and has thousands in debt. We live together and I have been paying for all of the living expenses for 4 months (he got laid off but has been back to work for over a month). He got some unexpected money for unemployment insurance and he wants to buy a mtn bike, yet he hasn't given me a single dollar for 4 months. If he comes home with that bike, he's gone.   Take over the finances. Don't take no for an answer. Now is not the time to get behind on bills.

76cAAPfBaa	Wait a minute, everybody who has personal real-world experience with this guy is telling you to get away from him fast, and you STILL want to trust him??    You are making a big mistake, get away from him now! You just can't take a chance like that, and end up ruined in some way.|`|0dCOJQiwaa	First of all, how old are you both? The reason I ask is because you mentioned "school". If this is HS, then I would trust the "rep" he's got as a "Man Hoe"....most of the time in HS, those reputations are correct.   Secondly, girl, what are you doing with your best friend's ex? I would trust her. She seems like a good girl who is just looking out for you and has "been there, done that"|`|BbEo2HOzaa	Can you see the forest through the trees?   Do you know who your friends are?    If so, listen to them.|`|gDuDNeRcaa	trust him until he gives you a reason not to. BUT....keep a close eye on his actions. you already know his pattern, so watch for warning signs.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	make up your own mind but be careful.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Let me get this straight.  Your best friend dated him and says he's an absolute jerk -- yet you don't believe her?  What kind of friend are you?  Friends watch each other's backs; I would never date a guy who hurt my best friend because she's my best friend.    You need to fix your priorities.  I think this guy is a player; at his age, they all are.  They're just out for the quickest sex they can get.  So here's a test.  Tell him that you don't believe in sex before marriage.  I guarantee you he will dump you within a month.  And do not have sex with him anyway; you're way too young for that.    If you guys are together for a year and there's no sex, no pressure of sex, no jealousy, no cheating, no lying ... you can come back here and tell me I was wrong.  But sadly, given his age (or the age I assume he is), I think I'm going to end up right.  Go ahead and trust him for now, but don't have sex with him.    And get a new best friend, since you don't appreciate the one you have.|`|MVVmsWSqaa	No one is entitled to trust.  The Bible says to test everthing.  Pray to God to reveal you the truth, and your boyfriends true light will shine through.|`|r88L6kZNaa	aww, that's a tough spot.  I know how you feel.  I went out this guy named Collin.  He's gone out with a lot of girls, and people call him a player.  All my friends told me to break up with him, but I liked him so much that I said no.  && he had a tendency of getting back with his Ex girlfriend, Maranda.  They broke up and got back together.  I told him that if he goes back out with her tell me, and don't lie.  He'd always say no no, we're just good friends.  I'm not going out with her.  I always believed him, once all my friends said he was going out with Maranda and I said no! but somehow, I believed them and I broke up with him, he got really mad.  Said that wow, you don't even trust me and everything.  So, I said I was really sorry! & got back together with him.  I didn't know if he was going out with her or not though.  Then I went out with him again and about 10 days later, I had a feeling he was going out with her, and he said no i'm not.  && one night I went to Maranda, and I was talking to her.  We were sort of friends(: she said i'm sorry to tell you this, but we're going out.  and i was like okay!  So I broke up with him that second, and once again he got mad..  But he had been going out with her like 1 day already. I'm still friends with him though, and I'm glad for that. He's a great friend, bad boyfriend.  My advice would be to talk to him and HIS friends.  See what they say, and maybe go with what your friend says.  Ask his ex girlfriends.  That is a tough issue.  Hoopefully I helped a bit.  I even believed him on the phone when he said, I am not going to go out with her again! but he did.  I went to him, and i said.. See told you! && we were just laughing together.  I said you should've told me, I wouldn't have gotten mad.|`|6857a830af423b9d5d00df49db1e6142aa	well wt i cn tell yu is tht yu reallii need 2 think bout the choices yu wnt to make whn it cumz to him..he says tht he readii 4 sex wit it cumz 2 yu but hey itz nt easii whn yur n luv wit sumbdy nd yu wanna do wt they wnt onlii cuz yu luv thm mii name is keria nd im dominique's friend nd im aanswerin yur quez onlii becuz i been thro it....i made mii decision nd he styd wit mii he didnt leave lyk hiz friendz said tht he wuld evrybdy liez juz 2 mak thmselves happii bout their relationship mezzn ^ so they wnt otha ppl 2 suffer.....  so juz tak yur tym nd mak the right decision...

Un9CElCaaa	it is if u have known that person a long time and been with them long enough to fall in love with them|`|EmMxNWyLaa	to me it looks like, you think that if you dont, he'll leave you. but the first few seems like love, the whole, thinking of him and you;ll do anything for him, but will he do the same for you?|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	Love is the relationship you have between you and another person.  It's not just your feelings for him.  It's how you interact, how you relate to each other.  It's friendship, caring and respect for each other.  He needs to show that back to you.  There shouldn't be so much hurt involved until at least you've been married a little while (no joking!) unless he's not pulling his part of the love masquerade.|`|t1VthewCaa	I'd say the best word for all that is obsessed because that's some sick things. Doing way too much!!!|`|8emYO8DFaa	Um..... How long have you two been together? That could help on the subject. You see if you two have been together for only a short while, then this can easily be seen as just puppy love. But, if you two have been together for awhile now (let's say at least 2 years) Then I would say that yes you are in love. Here is an interesting question though ...... Does he still feel the same about you? Are you sure? Does he just say it or does he show it?|`|0fVtHNtmaa	It's infatuation|`|SmFVG8eXaa	It certainly sounds like you care deeply for him.  Is your question - is this real true love??  I don't know.. only you would know. It certainly does sound like you devote a lot of time to him.  Are you doing the same for yourself ? Taking care of you? Doing things for you? You're just as important as he is.. so think about that.|`|ygimTNzoaa	It's real love if you're getting the love back. You need to have respect for yourself and be getting respect. If he did something to upset you, it cant be a "well I love him so its OK" type deal, he needs to communicate and be able to work things out with you. It cannot be only you. Remember that, if you ever think you're the only one putting in the effort, then it's only emotional not true. Remember people change, it may be great now but people change and you have to be willing to change with him, and viceversa. Hope you don't get to lost in it, you sound like you may be.

Our body clocks work in 90-minute cycles, and our bodies need 4 or 5 of these 90-minute cycles per night. So if u count back from 7am that will give u an indication of when to go to bed.<br>  So ideally it will be somewhere between 11pm and 12:30am, if i've done my maths correctly.<br>  <br>  Also, the worst thing to do in the morning is press the snooze button, because when u fall back to sleep you body begins another 90-minute cycle and when u have to get up this is interrupted, making u feel like u haven't had a decent night's sleep. Best thing to do is force yourself to get up on the first alarm, as hard as it is to do!!<br>  <br>  Fait de beaux reves (sweet dreams in french!)|`|iCUstJdNaa	Go to bed about half past ten and make sure your bedroom is dark.

a899c2784f7d18371c6b8f614a000c4eaa	Well, I was very shy about masturbation and all when I was your age, too. For me, I just noticed that if I ever read/saw something very sex-related, I'd feel a lot of heat rush to my down-under area, lol. Then, now - I'm 17 now, btw - I tend to think more about sex since I have a different understanding of it (still a virgin, though). Are you sure you're not getting wet?

He can't be forced to admit to cheating so unless you have video tape evidence or his mistress is willing to testify good luck trying to prove it.  Just so you know video of them going into a hotel room and coming back out with their hair and clothes messed up doesn't legally prove adultery.  You would need video of the act itself.    As for the monetary split?  Welcome to the double edge sword of women's lib.  Now that women can make just as much if not more money than their male spouse, they are starting to have judges rule for alimony being awarded to the husband.

The key is to find out what the deception is and when it started. Some people, when excessively accused of cheating for no reason, will react with a lot of drama if excused again or the guilt of what she's actually done is eating at her. Another thing to remember is "the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior".|`|dSMb8JDvaa	You can not assume that is true story. YOu both now very emotional. YOu can't blame on her if you not sure yet. But if she did...well you is now in the same shoes with her Ex bf. ( yOU need proves though to excuse her for that)
VXcnq3zGaa	Invite her round your place and cook her a three-course meal. You never know where it might lead...|`|AsFiWxhUaa	go to a park and talk just get to know each other. if you live up north go play in the snow then go get coffee or some hot chocolate|`|PhNzEkVnaa	Go to a museum or a gallery, more of a chance to interact.  You will definitely get time to see what the other is interested in.  I guess this only works for a Sunday date.  I vote for baseball game but wrong season--for Saturday evening.  What about hockey--too cold for me but some are fans of it ?|`|UndijYHAaa	something FUN! go window shopping somewhere strange and quirky, or just go to the park and play on the swings. and you're never too old for finger painting. the sillier, the better. if you want to cook her dinner, make it something you can cook together. building your own pizza with odd toppings is always an interesting one. bake something, and get into a food fight. try something she's never done before, like a martial arts class or wine tasting. if you can find a continental market, they're incredible for looking around. if you live near a river, you could go rowing and bring a picnic. (may not be ideal in winter though). just find something you can do together, thats fun, and preferably a new experience.
kduFYoCVaa	its frustrating for a girl because boys and girls have different views.- to a boy it doesnt even matter. it does start to matter when they're living under the same roof etc, if hes young then he'll grow out of it.

Flirting when in a serious relationship is selfish.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	You are right that flirting is natural, and I think your friend may be overreacting.  The thing to remember is "intent".  If her boyfriend is flirting intentionally, that's not cool.

231e2f619695988a9a2770ac10966cd2aa	wow. i can tell this has really been on your mind. the best thing to do is try to get him over her. maybe have her not come over anymore, and when you guys hang out, maybe you can just start going to her house. i know the last thing you want is to have your dad and your best friend doing things without your knowing of it. maybe slowly your dad will get over it. he should not be the one depressed, you have every right to cry over something like that. he needs to realize that you are more important and pleasing you(which would be getting over your friend) is better then having his daughter cry about something she cant get off her mind. maybe you can tell him that it makes you feel uncomfortable.|`|y39iNwFjaa	Tell your dad he's upset you.

Is there anyone 'real' (not yahoo answers) that you can confide in? You need to trust someone to help you through this. It really does sound as though he may have abused your friend and this is WRONG.<br>  <br>  The rudeness I'm sure you don't appreciate and people are unfair to be so rude but you need to face the facts as you've presented them here and your father DOES come over as being in the wrong as his feelings are not parental.

I would kinda watch him around her. don't sound good to me. you got to know what's up if you cried. after talking to him if you don't see any change talk to her parents. when you see things like this you need to let someone know before something happens. let just hope it's nothing.|`|zYqHaDcmaa	Ok. One thing you HAVE to understand: You can't choose love. Love happens, coincidentally. It comes when you least expect it. And this is apparentally the case. and everyone saying: EEW he's a perv, etc.... get a life. She's looking for help, not put-downs. Ok. Here is something great to do. Write a letter to him. Make it full of all your feelings, even if they are mean. Then look at your letter. Re-read it. Now nicer, make a new letter that puts your thoughts out there in a better way and slip it under his bedroom door. Don't make any comment when he sees it. Act like you didn't even put it there. It will clear your mind. When your dad is ready to talk about your letter and his feelings and explain more, he will. Don't be afraid. Hope I helped.|`|wXCX0Gy7aa	first off tell him how you feel and don't tell your friend because she might stop being your friend. tell him that's wrong and if he really needs another women to try a dating site if he has too. i know you don't want to hurt his feelings but this is serious and you must do it for them and your sanity|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	this is seriously wrong honey and its not about making jokes or smart comments but your dad needs help there is no way he should have these feelings towards a 15 yr old girl he is very close to pedophile.talk to another family member maybe an aunt or grandma.but get some help for you and your dad before its too late.|`|wHEYZibeaa	Oh, I'm sorry. I would tell him the truth. Tell him everything that you feel. That it's kind of weird, because he's really old for her. And that it probably isn't likely that she'll fall in love with him. I hope everything ends well.|`|jkDawQVNaa	you need to talk to your dad and your best friend together let them know it has to end now and your dad can get arrested for it if he does go further , she is a minor and she should tell him to back off to!|`|NRfqivKPaa	Sounds like your dad needs help. Your friend needs to know what he said and she needs to stay away from your house, this is not right! Your dad could get in major major trouble for this too. Sounds like he might have done something he should not have!|`|HJI8778baa	This is tragic. I really have no ideas what you can do apart from perhaps help him realize the reality of it all and to move on.|`|Xly2sF6waa	Short of calling the cops(they won't do anything if he hasn't made any advances) you need to tell your friend's parents.

D=|`|RErVDMNVaa	You say your dad isn't a creep. A creep is considered a "bad" person. Your dad may be a good person, but he needs some help. There is no way about it. He may need some counseling to get over your mom..which NOT being over her can cause him to turn to anything or someone which he would not usually turn to. He is "in love" with a 15 year old girl. This is NOT normal. A 15 year old girl is not mature enough to handle the physical or mental part of  being with a 54 year old man.  It is unrealistic. His views on life..morals..values is totally messed up. I would definitely keep my friend away from him. Talk to another trusted adult. Do not try to handle this situation by yourself. It might be rough..watching your dad go through the changes it takes to fix this problem he has. It's not your fault..nor your friend's. If anything were to happen with your friend and your dad..I would suggest she get some counseling as well. This is not considered a relationship..but rather sexual abuse. Not something to take lightly or keep to yourself.|`|UVW4yZsDaa	if your english, you NEED to watch hollyoaks thats on at 6.30 everyday on channel 4.<br>  <br>  if not, nevermind.<br>  <br>  you need to tell your dad its disturbing you and you need to tell him that its kinda' wrong! <br>  STAND YOUR GROUND, ITS YOUR BESTFRIEND!<br>  <br>  don't be harsh, because after all, he is your dad, but tell him it hurts you that hes trying to replace your mum or mom. <br>  <br>  i'm guessing now that i've seen mom, you are infact american.<br>  <br>  google > channel 4 > hollyoaks<br>  <br>  go on it. what you've said is exactly what happened in hollyoaks.<br>  <br>  hope i hoped lovey!<br>  <br>  x|`|c24c92b6e2571d7ff8699136760929c3aa	Good God. That's really sucky of your dad to dump that on you. What a horrible burden. You are going to have to talk to someone about this. Fish around and see if there is some anonymous hotline you can call and spill your guts about this. <br>  <br>  How awful for you. I wish I had a specific place. There must be a hotline for you to call to talk to someone about this anonymously.|`|E4cbSGXMaa	I dont mean to be harsh, but i think you should contact social services, shes only 15! also hes saying they had a 'thing'. u never know if it is true or not, you cant be with her 24/7. also your dad shouldnt allow himself to fall in love with a minor, he could of asked u to stop her coming round and all sorts of things, hope everything goes well talk to someone family or teachers, you cant keep this a secret.|`|UoNe20J6aa	I can't imagine how difficult this might be but you should definitely tell him that he has to seek help because that is totally not normal.  If it dies out after a few days maybe a good talk with him will help but if he continues acting emotionally affected then you need to tell him that he needs to talk to someone.|`|mh357Rnuaa	I feel for you petal;<br>  But as I have never been in this situation it's hard for me. However why dont u take him to a singles club or introduce him to a new hobby that way he may attend clubs where he can meet  different women. Try to make him see how young you are and then maybe he'll see just how young his crush is.<br>  <br>  From; CandiBabe X.|`|sgrPLmR5aa	Tell him how you feel first of all, don't keep your feelings to yourself. And ask him if he loves your friend only because she reminds him of your mom, or if it's real. If it's real then it's totally not right (and illegal as well) he should find a way to move on.|`|PhZx6nYnaa	Well talk to your friend and your dad and see what they think and is your dad married , if so tell your mom and see if she can help, or get a divorce, but its better than your dad cheating on your mom with someone that doesn;t like him back..... <br>  <br>   And please anwser mine :  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Av8IMCvGkbyCf9WFH4mRPB_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220155753AAiua4B">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|i2YA8Xyiaa	That's a very very very wierd story i mean ur dad is 54!!and she's 16 goshh its unbelievable. get him soemone older, make it stop. quick b4 u make it in the news! ---> "world record 54yr old man matching up with 16yr old young girl".

I don't necessarily think your dad is crazy or a pedophile, as many of these answerers say.  Sometimes, these things happen.  When you fall in love with someone out of your league, what can you do?  It happens.  The World is full of surprises.  And, just so y'all know, a pedophile is a person that loves to have sex with children, sheesh!                            <br>  <br>  _____________________ <(-_-)>______________________<br>  <br>  Well, anyway, to get back to the point, just tell your dad that you feel a bit weird about this, or just tell him your feelings.  Try not to get your friend too involved with your dad, anyway.  Over - aged stuff can lead to problems, even if there's no sex or if it's just holding hands, unless you were smart enough to be discreet.  There's really nothing much to be done.  Tell your dad to try not to get involved with your friend too much.  Anyway, hope this helped you in any way possible. <('.'<)|`|GQ9znuYiaa	oh boy, ok do not panic.<br>  if your dad has sexual feelings for your friend than you need to tell someone. like a schoool counseler, or a trusted adult (an aunt or uncle or someone like that) maybe tell your dad that shes 15 going on 16 and hes 45. plus to top it off shes your best friend since the 2nd grade. your dad is prob just alone alot, (im guessing something happend to your mom) maybe he should think of dating his OWN age. he needs to know its ok to love someone as family, but nott falling kinda love. and he also needs to know its basiclly ilegal for some of that age to 'love' some one thatts 16. <br>  i wish you the bestt of luck, i really do!<br>  ihope this works outt,<br>  stay strong<3|`|balYkPJ0aa	This isn't right and you know that deep down...I know that this is such an awful position for you to be in, but you need to talk to someone you can trust.<br>  <br>  I take it your Mom isn't around?If not, is there anyone you can talk to this about?Your dad might need some councilling or just some help, hiding it isn't going to make it go away.<br>  <br>  You might feel like you're betraying your dad by confiding in someone else, but you're not. <br>  <br>  The important thing is that he hasn't acted on it.<br>  <br>  Talk to someone you trust, things will be okay.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps:)|`|mbfMYmzWaa	Prolly a troll--- but JUSSSST IN CASE....<br>  <br>  <br>  First of all- understand you're not alone. Older men fall for younger women all the time... and in some societies it's even expected. <br>  <br>  Having said that, I cannot BELIEVE that he told YOU! that is just completely selfish and out of line. It's not fair for him to totally knock your world out of place just for the sake of 'getting something off his chest'. <br>  I dont want to offend, but I think your dad has some serious issues to do that. Maybe he's going through depression or a (late) midlife crisis, either way if he doesnt usually act as irrational as this- you can probably assume it's not him talking, it's a (hopefully temporary & mild) mental condition.  <br>  Is he on any medications? Did he only recently lose your mum? maybe things like this could have triggered something. <br>  <br>  If I were in your position, I'd speak to a proffessional. Call a free hotline like the kids helpline or something, and they can refer you to someone who specializes in family matters like this & together you can get some kind of plan. <br>  To start with, I'd gather my thoughts and write them down, then you can easily pick out the issues that you feel you can talk to him about... and the ones that you can't bring yourself to discuss are still off your chest. Honestly, the 'theraputic' benifits are rediculously underrated.  <br>  <br>  Obviously you're a pretty mature girl (can tell by your articulation & the fact you're concerned for HIM rather than "OMG disgusting!!"), but still- for him to dump something like on you puts you at risk of serious psych trauma. Whether or not it's "love" or just infatuation is pretty irrelevant at the moment, because I think we can safely assume that nothing's going to happen between them (seeing as you "KNOW" she wouldn't have reciprocated in the past). <br>  <br>  Goodluck luv. <br>  <br>  Remember, in a few years you'll be looking back on this and just rolling your eyes in embarrasment. Nothing but the end of the world is ever 'the end of the world'.
AA10065812	*** Yes, and the child support can be increased due to the increased medical costs due the the pregnancy.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Absolutely. The child is still a minor (unless she marries) AND her needs are even greater than before she ruined her life, ummm I mean got pregnant. I'll bet you're the step-mom. New gf's and step-moms are often trying to figure out how the screw the previous children out of support. It's really unattractive.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	No. That's asking a grandparent to pay support.

Av6rDfjKaa	i am 23, my parent are in their 50's. they just got divorced last year and my mom has a boyfriend. she overweight, crazy, and well completely crazy. but i think she is really happy with him. ANYWAY, my point is, i think you can find love at any age....its just a matter of timing and finding someone else. i mean, you think youre the only one who is 38 and single???yeah right!  if you are not happy with your current relationship, dont just stay because you think you have no other options. also i would say dont lie about your age. then that will cause ajor problems down the road. good luck!|`|TAMGy07Daa	Its sorta true, my mother is 46 years old, hasn't had a (real) relationship for a while.. i feel sorry for her, but its sort of there fault, they dont go out and find dates.|`|Pef0ZbLZaa	sweetie don't listen to t.v. <br>  you shouldn't stay with someone because you think its your only option.<br>  you said your attractive. go meet someone new ;)|`|7KRYTaReaa	my mom is 40 and she still gets dates, age really doesn't matter, a lady in my church got remarried and she is 72|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Where in the hell have you been in the last 5 years or so?  Women of any age can get dates in today's world.   You need to leave your boyfriend so you can learn to love yourself, and become the cougar that you have hiding inside this meek little person.  You have to work on making your inner beauty shine through.  <br>  <br>  A real man will love you for who you are, and appreciate everything about you.  Don't lie, as it just leads to a bad relationship, and causes more problems.  Perhaps you need to see a professional to deal with your self esteem and depression.
fsHgUrcAaa	Your mom is probably feeling all kinds of emotions due to her illness and inability to care for herself.  She might be taking her frustration out on you (which is unfair) but if you're the only person she has contact with, it's bound to happen.  <br>  <br>  Does she have any friends she can vent to?  Maybe you can spend some fun time with her to help her get her mind off of her illness.  Let her know you don't mind being there for her and maybe she'll think before she takes her frustration out on you.|`|EIY722Hwaa	I assume that this is really starting to get under your skin and you aren't feeling appreciated by your mom. You have to know that she is VERY grateful for all that you're doing for her. She's just scared. She doesn't want you to have to do all that you do for her because she's the mom and she's supposed to take care of you. Not you take care of her. Give her a break and be there for her as much as you can. And you know if you don't, you'll feel bad about it later. ( I know how you feel because I have to help with my step mom) (even though her condition isn't at the point of where your mom's is at, i do have an idea how you feel.) Just be there and be patient with her.
6rqpICYeaa	you ask her out, when she said "it was the sweetest thing anyone has said" it means that she is probably interested to date you...any way..you never know..so just ask her out..!<br>  Good luck!
eavQdBn6aa	Sounds like she does like you! :D Maybe she's too shy to admit it lol XD But once there was this guy I liked, and he told me he liked me so I was like yay mee too! Then he said he was joking... o.O  Lol XD|`|XuPCXZjwaa	Hey Templar Rock<br>  <br>  It seems to me like she may like you as a friend. For now. Maybe if you stop worrying about whether or not she likes you and just enjoy her company for the friend that she is then when the time is right (and  you'll know when the time comes) things between you will develop on their own.|`|SaXDB3aFaa	well.... she might like you....she might not..... if she rejects you your gonna feel like crap and not give a **** about anything anymore if you really like her...... if she says yes you guys will be happy and stuff..... but personally i think she likes you but play your cards right cuz she can just say no as easy as she can say yes....|`|K3RhqzScaa	You should use a pick up line|`|ikL5ZdfAaa	she's either playing hard to get or just wants to be best friends with ya|`|xN7oqJxKaa	well im a girl my self and all people confuse me but i git this one  ok she like you but not so shure she probably  has friends that tell her don't and some friends that say go for it girl  and she her self is  probably totally confused her self give her a chance to sort things out  your probably going to fast maybe she is a slow person or maybe likes another guy and teeter tottering between you and another guy 'good luck and hope for the best'|`|UmDqxnr6aa	she may be acting different just cuz she likes you. she is most likely playing hard to get so you have to try harder.|`|KWV6ZtBsaa	why dont you use a pick up line fool|`|cEfXbPLqaa	Sounds like she is playing hard to get. We women do that all the time. She might not like u- she might love u. lol  Be patient but, if u like her- ask her. It won't hurt to try.   :)|`|HJrTuihcaa	maybe she said she doesn't like you because she hasn't sseen you in person and hasn't got to know you personallly|`|DZSQNEBjaa	I think she just wants to be friends buddy|`|pqlhPnexaa	No, she does not like you. I have been the girl before in this situation... trust me on this.<br>  <br>  Saying somebody's "cute," asking what you look like... that's just the way she is. She does NOT like you. If she did, she would have made that clear by now. What she's doing right now is just being a little over the top friendly, because it's her personality.<br>  <br>  Realize friends is all you're going to be with her, suck it up, and move on.|`|6hj9Z1graa	I dunno bro, I've had similar things happen to me and it turned out that the girl did like me but she was waiting to see if something she heard about me was true, so maybe shes still trying to figure you out. I suggest you just be yourself and see how it goes, good luck|`|QTysjfgPaa	She probably does like you, she's just so nervous to tell you, and maybe she's not entirely sure that you like her, you should give her more signals, then maybe she'll have more confidence to tell you|`|HsctHlHhaa	k she reallly likes you allot but doesnt want to show it believe me i know cos i act exactly like that when i really like a boy and i know he likes me allot and btw thats soooo cute you two are 13!! (im 14 lol idk it seems cute)|`|k9txFCTlaa	i think she does like you but is just trying to play hard to get. obviously its working if it has you so worked up about this :] then again she could be one of those girls who enjoy being a tease. all i can say is be careful|`|Yy3zDYW1aa	i had this problem she says no but inside she really likes u it's just that she is afraid to tell.<br>  <br>  p.s wanna have sex?if u say yes cool if u say no u suck eggs<br>  <br>    answer in the e-mail nanabel1026@yahoo.com|`|3NdBYdlOaa	of course she would'nt tell you she likes you,she probably does but is too shy to admit it|`|l9PkppP1aa	well if she said she doesnt like you then i guess she doesnt like you<br>  she probably just wants to be friends|`|Tbtdw8BZaa	well this is totally my thoughts on this.<br>  <br>  i think that she doesn't like you as a boyfriend or anything like that. i think she just thinks your really cute and she wants to be really close friends with you.<br>  <br>  Orr<br>  <br>  she does really like you and wants you to be her boyfriend, but already has somebody, or she is just shy or nervous, or she just isn't ready to date yet. but if she does want to go out with you, sounds to me that she is just confused and she doesn't know what she wants just yet. <br>  <br>  dating at 13..... isn't that a little young? not to discriminate or anything, but i think you should at least wait 1 more year before you go out looking for a partner in life.... im just sayin...
Lfc9Zav2aa	try sniffling and falling at her feet wrapping your arms around her ankles and begging her for mercy even though you really don't deserve it.|`|9bdEPcWIaa	Go to her car and help her with a smile.  Can you squeeze in a hug for her too?|`|JI1EpWX6aa	Ok first of all you have to apologize for what you did what ever it was.<br>  Next you have to play it cool with her help her anytime she needs help so she won't be mad anymore. If she doesn't waht to speak to you leave a letter saying sorry and that you really didn't mean to do whatever it was.You can even write I'll do anything just to show that you want her to forgive. Just don't do anything stupid that could make you get hurt mentally and physically. <br>  <br>  My brother when we get really pissed he goes to the same room as where I'm in and says sorry usually i say What? Then he explains that he didn't mean it and everything and I end up forgiving him but he only apologizes two or three days after so I have time to cool off.|`|9Ni21lHpaa	Are you old enough to bake?a plate of cookies with an apology note might make her smile. If ure not,how about u make her a "im sorry" card??;DDo what you usually do and help her put things in the house,apologise for whatever youve done and tell her u didnt mean to make her mad.|`|48W167cBaa	What on earth did you do? :/<br>  <br>  When she gets home, head out to the car and help her with her things. While you're helping out, apologize for what you did. I'm sure you didn't mean to, so let her know that. <br>  <br>  Hopefully she'll understand.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and be careful! :)
XjkdUliGaa	jst wait til he's ready|`|LMfYodo6aa	When a guy isn't "ready" for you to meet his parents and he keeps using "someday" when you ask him when, then he's not ready to commit. When a guy is ready to commit, he will want to bring you home to mommy and daddy and show you off. If he's not ready to commit, then he's not going to want you to meet his parents. It's usually a sign that he doesn't think that he will settle down with you. He's not going to put himself through all the hassle if he doesn't view himself settling down with you.|`|O2gN9HSDaa	I agree with you... <br>  It is obviously important for you that each of you meet the other persons family. <br>  <br>  I think by that year mark if he's not ready then I would be willing to say he will never be ready ....<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that what you want matters just as much as what he does ... DO NOT give up what you want just because he says he isn't ready. He's a big boy and will get over your decisions.|`|BsK3u5p3aa	his big grown 31 year old behind dont need to be scared of nothin! lol how old he is he should have SOME kinda "parent-meeting" experience. n if u waited too long to tell ur parents, be sure to apologize to them cuz if my daughter kept somethin like that from me for that long i'd tell her AND HIM off!|`|THAMJdQyaa	Thats a big age gap, maybe he is a little uncomfortable about meeting your parents because of his age.  Let him no they don't care and that you don't care about the age difference.  Love has no age!|`|KbcdLsz3aa	umm give him 2 weeks cuz yall should of been did this so yall can go ahead with yall lives together|`|hE6Z93Ysaa	Sounds like a commitophobe to me.|`|XH2o1MM6aa	.Very unusual for any couple who profess to be in a serious relationship to wish to remain anonymous to the respective parents.He may resist the invitation to meet you parents because he knows by accepting he's opening the door for you to visit his.For some unknown reason he wishes to avoid this.I'd persist,insist he meet your parents.If he wont, then something isn't right.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Like so many things in dating, deadlines don't work.   <br>  <br>  Enjoy what you have with your boyfriend, and let things like this happen.  He's quite a bit older than you, and that's not really a good thing.  He's probably really nervous because he's not ready to face the "aren't you too old" thing.  <br>  <br>  Just give it time, and enjoy what you have.|`|Xly2sF6waa	It is too late the day before the wedding.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	What do I think?  I think he's uncomfortable with the age difference and he's concerned about how warm his welcome will be.  I also think he's concerned about how you will be received by his family.  You don't address this point in your question, but it's an obvious issue for most couples like you and he.<br>  <br>  If this isn't a problem in your family, then set it up.  You can only hope that he will take your lead and reciprocate with his family.  It's not the kind of thing that you can force to happen - at least politely.<br>  <br>  An honest relationship is ALWAYS ready.  I would start questioning his motives.|`|e9v0jjHJaa	Wow, chick. I mean, wow. Stand back. Take a look at things. I'm not telling you to break up with this guy, but just take a good look around. For a 31 year-old guy to claim he's not ready to meet your parents, well, either he's a total loser with no social skills whatsoever, or he's remarkably embarrassed that he's dating someone 12 years younger. <br>  <br>  If I was involved with someone I cared about, I could muster the courage to meet her parents, even if they were the royal family. You have WAY too much life in front of you to waste your time with this garbage. Somewhere out there is a guy who will treat you well, respect your family, and want a truly positive relationship without any weirdness.

24UPDIBTaa	You should keep it to yourself and let his relationship play out naturally unless you want to risk being part of some sort of love triangle. If they break up and you are still single and into him, tell him you're sorry things didn't work out for him. <br>  <br>  Wait a little while, maybe a week or two, then let him know you can remain friends but you're also available whenever he feels comfortable dating again.

Why put yourself through that again?|`|8yncQq62aa	like the first post said, she probably just wants to back in good terms. its not good for anyone to hold any sort of grudge. so just play it cool, im sure she just wants to be friends.|`|l9PkppP1aa	well maybe she just wants to be friends again<br>  she has moved on from everything that happened between you two<br>  but she still wants you in her life|`|wXCX0Gy7aa	i doubt she wants to but theres a chance
2XTkSV4daa	I think you guys should try being friends again. Start slow and then gradually move up into being close...this might involve sitting together at lunch and then maybe doing homework after class together a couple weeks later and then having her over for a sleepover with you and your friends a couple weeks later. I think she needs your love and support because insecure people are like that...so even if she annoys you to want to be the center of attention all the time, at least be someone she can talk and have fun with.|`|E2OKRhwYaa	Well you say she seems to mature, but if you don't trust it I'd say give her another chance just don't be too close to her. You do however need to realize that people do change.
lzcglDnMaa	The only way I can think of is even though you know that your daughter is your bf child. Get a dna test and prove it to his mother that it is her grandchild. Maybe after she says it in black and white then she will learned to like you and quit being so mean to her grand child. I thing if it was me and she was being that mean to me, I would just not talk to her. Get caller id and when she calls do not talk to her. Tell your bf that he needs to stand up to her and set her straight or there is not going to be a wedding. Marrying a man who is not going to stand up for you before you get married,  means that he is not going to stand up for you after you are married and that will just lead you into a divorce later down the road. Good luck.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Yes, your boyfriend's mother is a racist. She clearly wants you out of his life. How do you think marrying him is going to change her mind? Do you want to raise your daughter in that kind of environment? Is your boyfriend going to cut all ties with her so that you don't have to put up with her? Do you really think she will allow him to cut her out of his life? Don't your child[ren] deserve better? <br>  <br>  There are no magic words to fix this. You would be wise to forget about having any kind of wedding until you can settle this issue with the woman who might end up being your mother-in-law? Love is good, but it doesn't conquer all. Good luck.|`|iD4ejChZaa	if you were black and she was white you'd get a milion responses here, if i were you i would never put up with that, convince him to move far away, ultilmately she doesn't matter, tell her she is jealous of you because that is the root of it,, stop fornicating get married if you're in love.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	well you can beat her .. with a ... d  ... n ...  a   ,,,, test .. then show it to her .. then you win ..|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Bless you because you are a better woman than I. I would have already taken this to the "mattress" for calling my daughter that. My kids are my cut off switch to controlling my temper--meaning if you mess with my kids and you are an adult then you have just had yourself a bad day. Any who how...Your boyfriend should sever all ties with his mother because she is toxic. Counseling would be a biggie too. You deserve better than what you are going through on the grounds that you are a human being alone, and your could be MIL should have more respect for her son!!|`|BItkg1f0aa	Wow, i feel way bad for you. Sometimes those monster in laws can be insane. And sometimes you can be handed a good one. People are right. Get a DNA test and prove it is his. Once she see's that don't let your daughter near her still. Let her think about the feelings she has hurt through this. I hope your daughter realizes how horribile this woman is when she gets older. As far as the guilt trips she pulls on him. I know how that feels. It sucks and gets way irritating. Sooner or later he should get sick of it. My dads mother got so bad, that they no longer speak to eachother. My dad made that decision. I hope all this gets better for you. People can be quite immature at times.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	O boy.  Misery loves company.  If you are prepared for this life go ahead and get married.  I think you are clearly setting yourself up for a divorce. However, if you both truly love each other, I think that will outshine the mother and she will finally come around.|`|0QKEW5lRaa	here's what you do: <br>  1. pretend to break up with him<br>  2. get yourself some plastic surgery to become black<br>  3.

Sadly, some people are still very racist, and it is very old-fashioned in this day and age. What is worse is that you and your fiancee love each other, and she would rather see him with a black woman than a woman he loves.<br>  <br>  It really upsets me that she says her grand-daughter isn't hers. That is just mean. You are brave for dealing with her for this long, I don't think I could have done it. It sounds like she is never going to change, or at least not until she realizes her son is not going to leave you just because she acts ridiculously. I would just stay away from her, and if he wants to see her, he can go alone.<br>  <br>  By the way, I think that mixed-race children are beautiful! They are so lucky, they always seem to have the softest skin and the most adorable hair. Its like they get the all best traits from both races!|`|bHTJOqiiaa	Ive experienced this. I was the the daughter. My mother went through the same thing with my fathers mother. she never liked me or my sister. What you have to do is stay strong for your baby girl. Always repsect your elders but dont l;et her down your baby girl. thats what your not supposed to take. its great your fiance stands his ground also and lets her know that not how she treats someone he loves. jus stay strong and even if it doesnt work out always respect her but dont lt her disrespect your baby. thats the most important !|`|cb6ToDZYaa	I am so sorry that you are having to endure this - it must be very difficult.  I understand that since losing his father that he is afraid to cut ties with his mother, but he needs to understand that his mother knows that, and is manipulating him in the biggest way.  It is cruelty at its worst.  I respect that he sticks up for you and your daughter - he sounds like a great guy.  It is one thing for his mother to talk this way about you, but it is completely unacceptable for her to talk about a child in that manner.  In my opinion, he needs to tell his mom that he can no longer have a relationship with her until she grows up.  He needs to tell her that her manipulation is not going to work anymore, and shame on her for using it in the first place.  He should tell her how much he loves her and he hopes for a relationship in the future, and he hopes all the best for her.  She doesn't have to agree with his life decisions, but she has to respect them.  I hope the very best for both of you and your precious little girl.  Good luck.
sTAA8lthaa	Oh, please don't kill yourself. I have a friend whose dad is just awful to her too. Talk to someone. A friend, your mom I don't know someone! All I know is that everyone has good in them.

What I would do if I were you, is talk to your mom about how you feel wehen your dad yells at you. Maybe she can ask him if he could take things into consideration and be a little nicer to you. Also, i would try to write your dad a loving note, explaining how much it hurts when he is mean to you. Maybe he just doesn't notice how he is acting? Maybe you can join a club so that after school you don't have to come straight home. That way, you have a reason for the mess to not be yours. You dad will yell and you can say but dad I wasn't home after school how can I have made the mess. Good luck and i hope things work out for you =]|`|48W167cBaa	When your dad asks you to clean something up, and you yell back "It wasn't me!" will only make him more upset. Have you tried cleaning up the messes without any arguments? Sure it's unfair, but if no one else will clean it up, someone has to. If you don't, he just keeps yelling.<br>  <br>  But hitting you is not acceptable. If you're talking back, it might make him do this- try not to argue back! Have you talked to your mom about this? Maybe you could talk to a counselor at school.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you hon- stay strong, and good luck. :)|`|4Y2w3EeXaa	maybe he wanted a boy instead<br>  <br>  or maybe you killed your mother being born

There is nothing in your piece to indicate that you are best friends or headed  for a potential romance.  Though I suspect that you like this guy and will like to date him, I would suggest that you continue to talk to him  and find out if he likes you as more than a friend. If he does , then you can discuss going out on a date. If he does not , then you can say nothing, remain his friend , and nothing is ruined. You have your whole life ahead of you since you are still so young and you will have plenty of time to date and tons of guys to choose from.

He is creating social burdens to increase our deficit.|`|3379beee21bd16119073619f31fef6d5aa	Just means that he can't control himself and is a major dog.|`|00390bee0bdfb56e0334bd2845fadd9aaa	um no <br>  it just means he's a pig<br>  <br>  and if I were his wife..he be-getin a beating from me!|`|4Y2w3EeXaa	he's very rich cos he can support so many children|`|LWtz8cGsaa	Huh, this looks like a soap opera.|`|DQlZIzAFaa	No, it just means he likes to not wear condoms.|`|OZ9yC9INaa	does he treat her with respect?<br>  that will answer you question|`|Tj2jMlTvaa	No, he does not Love YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is no way in the world a man has respect for you yet alone you have respect for yourself, if you are messing with a married man, have three kids by him, and think that he loves you................yeah right.....like you said he goes home to his WIFE every night.|`|WNn8WDPHaa	just means he can have babies..not in love. sorry|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	No.  It means he was deeply in you - at least 3 times.<br>  Hope you are happy raising those kids by yourself.  What are you going to tell them when they wake up in the night and do not see him?|`|FATyhyZ2aa	W/O further info., I'm guessing it just means he's had at least 3 sexual encounters w/ the mistress.|`|sFhvRimFaa	No it means he is a really stupid person! I don't really care about the guy in that situation i just care about the kids.

4i62SCfIaa	truthfully u should not need a whole list of how to impress a guy..<br>  he needs to like you for being urself!!<br>  if he doesnt like u for who u are..then there is something wrong with him..lol<br>  but other than that....impressing a guy<br>  smile at him, make sure that u give him eye contact and of course flirt with him, engage in the converstation, and be YOURSELF =)<br>  good luckkk!|`|UOb95jKzaa	first off confidence is key in the hell that is dating only the tough survive.lol if you think positive and carry yourself that way it will show. you can't make him like you but don't start off by putting up a false front and making him think your someone your not. Be real and flirtatious and fun.then see if anything happens, but if not don't be discouraged you haven't lost a thing and you may have earned more confidence.|`|EZxI4w9Caa	BE YOURSELF.<br>  <br>  that's where people fail epically. <br>  you shouldn't try any tricks or anything to get hi to notice you<br>  <br>  if you are being yourself and he is over looking you, and he knows you like him then simply he may not be that into you.<br>  <br>  sorry.  so show him you like him a little more, flirt with him if he doesn't respond MOVE ON.  there are plenty of guys in the world|`|ePpCKNT6aa	first you should just try talking to him and get to know him-and make sure he doesn't have a girlfriend- but i also think that you should just be yourself and just smile at him and try to find something you both like to talk about that he will find interesting <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK;)|`|p2brbBOeaa	Just be yourself.  If you are already friends, than that is a good thing.  I think everyone should be friends first, then more.  Just my two cents though :)|`|JmNaXTjqaa	this will sound corny but its true...be yourself, and if you get on then why dont you ask him instead of him waiting for you.|`|jiMi6Ihhaa	Do an awsome dance|`|nIOXmNBfaa	well..... trying seeing what he likes and give it a try.. n say funny things... so he can see that ur funny!|`|EZrYH6tdaa	well there is no exact way for him to notice or like you just start talking to him after a while you can simply ask him out <br>  and trust me this always works out one way or the other <br>  <br>  he will either say no (but he will take it as a complement and begin to be a friend)<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  he will go out with you<br>  <br>  so hey its a win win situation <br>  <br>  trust me this is how it always works out I've been through this <br>  <br>  good luck little starshine <br>  <br>  LOL that's a joke|`|BsK3u5p3aa	all i can say is that if he like u, he like u. he dont, he dont. u cant make someone like/love you. they supposed to like u for who YOU ARE. dont change a thing or do a thing to change them. let love come naturally to you. that way, you'll kno its real...<br>  be yourself. if they dont fall in love with the real you, then itz not meant to be. if u dont be urself, n they fall in love with the "fake you", then thats what the love will be: FAKE. and it wont last long... so be yourself. your own sweet self. k hun?|`|mh357Rnuaa	Be funny with him dont just let him tell the jokes. Also try to find out what hobbies he likes and then maybe you could talk about them if your interested in them.<br>  <br>  From; CandiBabe X.|`|dTbS3fIkaa	find out what he likes to do...and if u like doin what he likes then talk about it and make him laugh...BE URSELF!|`|Gxp4KmsIaa	with clothes <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>        !..................................... DUH........................................|`|IQ3pERJOaa	just be yourself. <br>  <br>  i know its hard to be like that around your crush<br>  <br>  but try as hard as you can.|`|g3CrnbhAaa	Be yourself, or show them the goods.<br>  That'd impress anyone.|`|rqyWvkeHaa	You can't make anyone like you. They either do or they don't but you never know what can happen over time. My best advice is to be yourself 100% then if he likes you for you it's all good=) I think if you be genuine that really impresses guys alot. I know that my friends that are guys really hate that in a girl.|`|3NdBYdlOaa	I wish I could help if I knew,just try to be outgoing,but not obnoxious|`|TyeuvRJzaa	BE YOURSELF=D|`|we2Csi51aa	be yourself and make him laugh.
C8DOT8Y7aa	Notice his reaction when you talk about other guys, sometimes his reaction when talking about other guys can be a big hint. If you are talking about how "Jacob looked so cute the other day", and he changes the subject quickly or gets uncomfortable, that's a good sign. If talking about how cute a celebrity is or just even mentioning another guy gives the same reaction, he likes you, and he wants to know that you think of him too. <br>  Notice these tell-tale signs: <br>  If he wants to talk to you all the time. <br>  If he was acting like you're his friend but stopped doing embarrassing things in front of you, <br>  If you turn around and you catch him looking at you. <br>  If he starts acting nicer when you're around him. <br>  If he says "yes" to all the things you ask him to do. <br>  If he treats you differently than others. <br>  If he tries to sit next to you at work, in class, at lunch, or play on a team with you during Gym/Recess. <br>  If he looks at you a lot every time you smile or laugh. <br>  If you catch him sneaking a glance at you and he quickly turns away when he realizes that you saw him,and you see him blush. <br>  If he acts immaturely around you, like poking, teasing or playful flirting. <br>  If he seems to always want to hang out with you. <br>  If he gets closer with a body part, or if he tries to touch you (e.g. when you touch him he might touch you back). <br>  If you catch him peeking at you and he smiles turn around slowly and smile back playfully. <br>  if when your talking and you say that you have to go, if he says nite cutie or nite sweetie, then that might mean he likes you. If he says he misses you then he might like you. <br>  If he tries to make you laugh. <br>  If he tries to copy you. <br>  If he tries to keep you in view for as long as possible or tends to look around and stop when he finds you. <br>  If he subtly looks at you but makes it look like he is looking at the girl next to him. <br>  If he's immature he will act different around you, quiet and maybe even try to avoid you. Or, he'll act different around you than when he's just with his friends. <br>  If he constantly calls you and uses an excuse -such as What was the homework? <br>  If he goes out of his way to talk to you (e.g. if he goes to the other side of your school to talk to you because he knows you have a class there). <br>  If you see him staring at something by turning his head 90 degrees and when you look at him he smiles and turns away, when this happens, check his pupils, he might have actually been staring at you. <br>  If he invites you to a party. <br>  If you flirt with a friend of his when he can see, and he looks jealous or automatically flirts back, (but don't flirt with them just to find out if he likes you). <br>  If he talks to you and wants to know how you're doing. <br>  If he is nicer or tries to talk to your friends. <br>  If he asks about you to your friends when you're not around. <br>  If he asks you to dance with him at the dance. Note: He may be trying to be nice because he thinks you like him. <br>  If he walks past you and tries to look cool so you can glance at him. <br>  If a guy tries to show you things he got that are somewhat expensive (e.g. a cellphone) or he tries to impress you. <br>  If you notice when he gets out of class and starts to walk a little slower than usual, then he's trying to give you the opportunity to talk to him! <br>  If he always talks to you there's a great chance that he likes you. <br>  If he feels so awful letting you down that he lies. <br>  If he would do anything to spend more time talking to you (e.g. if he talks/texts/IM's you until midnight). <br>  If you realize that he ignores you when you're looking but when you look out of the corner of your eye, he turns back around to look back at you. <br>  If he's talking to his friends and nodding like he's paying attention but you realize he's not, he's actually been staring at you the whole time! <br>  If he walks down the hallway (at school) and he "accidentally" bumps/touches you, if he moves your chair or pulls your hair etc. <br>  If he ignores you almost completely. For example, when you call his name he does nothing, but when your friend does, he pays attention. This is because he might be embarrassed or not sure how to approach you. Be careful, though, he might ignore because he just flat-out doesn't like you! <br>  Watch his body language! Whenever you are in a group of people with the one guy you think likes you, look at his shoulders - believe it or not, sub-consciously the guy will not want you to think he is ignoring you so his shoulders will be pointing at you, he may be talking to somebody else but his shoulders will be towards your direction, and then when you go to talk, he will usually immediately turn to you to listen. <br>  Watch his actions! If someone else is picking on you does he rush to defend you or get revenge on that person? Either he thinks of you as a great friend or he really likes you!|`|X9kUtwqSaa	Maybe he just doesn't want you to look at him.|`|Mk6Y5F0vaa	ok well look for this<br>  1.if he texts you non stop atleast starts up a convo with u 5 times a day and u didnt text him first he texted u<br>  <br>  2.if he tries to impress u (BIG BIG THING) he might try to run really fast when your in gym class with him <br>  <br>  3.if he is nice to you <br>  <br>  4. if he asks u out<br>  <br>  5.Asks you to hang out<br>  <br>  6.tells u he likes you<br>  <br>  THERE IS MORE<br>  but it would be way to much to type <br>  another good one is EYE CONTACT:)<br>  hope tht helped
c5UAa65qaa	But does he sparkle?<br>  <br>  I don't think you need to worry about him being a real vampire.  A little too goth, maybe.  If he creeps you out or gets too rough, just let him know.|`|7KRYTaReaa	i think he's a vampire, lol. Maybe your just being paranoid (no offense to you or anything) just be straight up with him.|`|mrysAOpGaa	first of all, even though its purely fictional, noone is sexier and has a sexier personality than edward cullens from twilight...<br>  <br>  But it's not because you watch too many movies and read too much, i dont think hes a vampire but her certainly is a freak of nature and by what you say..he creeps me out..|`|Ek2INE3Kaa	It kind've sounds like you're just talking about Twilight.|`|diL5HyI1aa	TO MUCH TWILIGHT !!
VqVBgI8vaa	i know what ur going thru lol hey and im 12 yrs older than u we have the exact same relationship and he's older than me...  Neway age aside.  I'm trying to figure out the same as u.  Sometimes blunt answers like the answer that Insura...  just gave are hard to read and listen to but they make a lot of sense.  Its a hard one hey especially when u feel the way u do and ur not really considering urself and ur feelings?|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	I think that you are both too young to take a relationship that's clearly not working this seriously.  <br>  <br>  You fight more than not, and aren't functioning as a unit.  You have to be a team in order to make this work, and the two of you are more like rivals.  <br>  <br>  You should call him and find out if he can still get the refund for his ticket and end the relationship.  Moving closer to him is not a good idea, as this isn't going to last even if you aren't long distance.
AA10529674	have him sit on the edge of the bed and then you can sit in his lap while making out. It's so romantic.|`|tp87bkXkaa	wow.. lol<br>  uh you guys can try side by side|`|g6p7uoSsaa	lay on your sides facing eachother and just put one of your legs around his waist and an arm around his neck or wherever you like. comfortable and simple :D|`|Ek2INE3Kaa	Have him sit up against the wall/headboard and you sit on his lap facing him.
9FyxeA1Zaa	haha man talk about your day, things that occured in town, what youve got planned and just link shizzle to these and make it funny! <br>  <br>  Well thats what i do with everyone i talk to on MSN haha|`|JmNaXTjqaa	yes make conversation she myt be thinking the exsact same thing..or just talk about somthing you both have in common :)|`|ai33g11Maa	Maybe try talking to her in real life as opposed to msn?!!!|`|eerMQ5LOaa	Yea dont be stupid she won't bite|`|Fu7OK54kaa	cus you like her!!<br>  <br>  make conversation - if you can't, maybe you shouldn't be together. Talk about stuff you normally would in the real world.|`|g3CrnbhAaa	This is how most conversations go on MSN.<br>  Not normally with girlfriends though. I would suggest you make conversation with her, otherwise your relationships going to get boring. Your not being paranoid; and dont worry, she wont think your being an idiot for making conversation.
rLRid8NEaa	just say "sup?" and maybe it will get into a thorough conversation. What ever she says, just keep talking. If she says, "im really tired" or something then ask her why. Tell her something about yourself. Ask her things about herself. Just say "i think it would be nice to know a little bit more about you. Tell me some things about yourself" And when she can't think of anything else to say, THEN ask her what favorite color, or cd, or sport is. When you get farther into the relationship, it will be easier and more comfortable to talk to her about things. Good luck~|`|JIsqQfiDaa	Spend 70% listening & 30% talking, ask questions open like "how was today for you?" or "what would you like to do next?"<br>  spend a long time smiling & agreeing with anything she says, if it something you don't really want to do say "yes I understand you like that, but what about trying this...."|`|WFFXHFfVaa	How long as she been your gf?? Should really come natural,and wouldnt u know that stuff about her already if shes your gf? Unless uve only just started dating.|`|eerMQ5LOaa	Tell her how she looks and slip in a cheeky joke or 2 - to keep her keen
I38WF5aFaa	Ignore it.  When someone says your sister's hot put him on the spot.  Respond with  "What about me"?     Watch him stutter and get red in the face.  At the same time do your own thing,  make your own friends and watch out for your little sister.  Guys do stupid things around hot girls.|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	well theres not really anything you can do but soon enough youll find a guy whoo thiinks your so beautiful and not want anything to do with your younger sister. its better to be like that bc then you know a person isnt just with you for your looks and that there love goes deepr|`|2XTkSV4daa	Wow I know exactly how you feel. Everyone...and I mean everyone...says my sister and I look exactly alike from our friends to random people in the elevator or the cook at the resturant. I'm not kidding. It can get annoying I know. The thing is that if they say that then you must be hot too! Anyways, back to the question, my sister is just starting to grow up and all that so she's getting a lot of attention more than me and stuff. Sometimes I'm jealous but then I remember I've got great friends who love me for who I am and not how I look. A good boyfriend would do the same. I hope it works out...I know how you feel.|`|G3emC90haa	OH MY GOD dude thats how it is for me D:<br>  <br>  i swear girls have gone gay for my sister.|`|VHDLTFG2aa	well the next time someone says,"ur sis is hot" just say "ok...and why don't you go tell her that" and walk away|`|AcmfbJVpaa	your sister has nothing to do with it<br>  and wen they tell you thing like that just say thank|`|YZMdV5Wdaa	Aww, that's really hard. But I bet that as soon as you walk away, those guys who are talking about how hot your sister is start talking about how hot YOU are. :)<br>  <br>  Just be there for your sister and don't let guys take advantage of her, and don't get jealous because you probably are just as pretty.<br>  <br>  hope that helped|`|JwyuXoeLaa	I feel the same exact way! Like omg! I'm 15 and my little sister is 13. Everybody used to say we looked just alike but we don't. She is the typical tan, blonde Barbie, like my mom. We have the same skin tone and face, but my hair is black, like my dads. All the guys I date love her to death and it just makes me sick. They always say "I can't wait til she gets older"|`|DQMriRuwaa	ok well i say that whenever someone comes up to you and says "dude your sister is hot" you say "why are you telling me this? I'm her sister, i dont want to hear that, besides youre not her type."<br>  <br>  maybe then people will stop talking to you aboaut it|`|HsctHlHhaa	is your name sam and your lil sisters ashleigh cos i kno two girls who look exactly alike and theirs a situation like this<br>  anyways your prob prettier how do you know ppl arent telling your sister your hot|`|23e9acd22e8df956ae04b1771cc19da9aa	get a makeover!! and be hotter than her. problem solved! =)
5DJzp6bMaa	He asked You Out and If he Didn't say Dutch then No|`|F8Yj3U9caa	no|`|ajgC0KPhaa	Go ahead and offer, just to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  The basic point is: He's the one who asked to go out, so he should be the one who's prepared to pay.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090212210557AAl3UEa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  <br>  .|`|QODJNf1oaa	Yeah, I think it's the polite thing to do and I'm sure the guy will tell you to put your money away, but he will appreciate the fact that you didn't assume he was paying.|`|HJI8778baa	Lucky guy, you look beautiful! I'd say offer to pay, but he'll most likely pay for it and insist you put your money away.|`|FR1SoLteaa	As a women, your not entilted to a free meal, if you deserve it, he will pay|`|r3zoMV0faa	No, if someone asks you to out on a date it normally means they will be paying however, you always prepare yourself to pay for your own tab in case you did go out with one of those men. <br>  <br>  A little advise don't always be so willing to pay or offer money fast b/c men tend to use woman who do that. Although a man can intinally find you attractive their motives quickly change when they realize they have a woman willing to easily spend her money.<br>  <br>  Get pampered, he asked you out. Enjoy & Good luck!|`|rLRid8NEaa	just say that you will pay. If he says no, its ok. at least you were being kind and offered to. It would be a good first impression on him so he can kind of know what you're like.|`|JmNaXTjqaa	well take some money and just incase he doesnt offer you can pay for yourself|`|atHoF0N3aa	yeah offer but playing around. he should be the one paying afterall he is that guy and he invited you. good luck|`|2FtRHFMBaa	if he asked you out ,he should pay for the date.|`|bZCSRu8Iaa	Im not sure sorry for the answer.... any ways be prepared|`|JIsqQfiDaa	no, never jump in too soon.  Ask him if he asks you to pay why.... then wait for the answer. If in doubt say sorry I ain't got much cash on me, can we just pay for our own drinks etc..
ahujYDBdaa	Aww, thats realllyy cute though. But yes, she obviously realized that you've realized ur past mistakes, adn that you've finally taken action for your mistakes. Shes in love with you still, and she sees the change you've become.|`|PLsJpPqOaa	wow this is sorta long but i'll try to do my best...<br>  maybe she knows that there's some good in you and i think that you should text her or write her  a note or tell her face to face about how you really feel and how you're sorry.<br>  hope this helps! <br>  :)|`|bxYP7QK2aa	That is definatly going to come back and haunt you... you know what they say "what goes around comes around..." good luck!|`|Tbtdw8BZaa	obviously she really loves you and she wants to be with you again. yes you were acting like a jerk, but people can change. if you really want to be a better person, then ask her to lunch so you can explain your feelings and thoughts to her in person. let her know why you did those things and just tell her your sorry. <br>  <br>  who knows, maybe you 2 will be back together after this is over. well at least i hope so. good luck friend...

KVFYJrDJaa	A couple of things: <br>  <br>  1. Your gf could be one of the many girls who just does not get on well with girls. In that case shes' always goign to have male friends. <br>  <br>  2. She could be an attention hoor and just likes to have the attention (to whatever extent) of her male compatriots, but have no intention of cheating.<br>  <br>  3. She could be on the make for someone to shag and/or leave you for.<br>  <br>  Whatever the case, The guys who hang around her only hang around her for one of two reasons: 1) they want to bone her (sorry to be blunt) or 2) she's "just one of the guys" <br>  <br>  I have a lot of female friends. I would sleep with any one of them, without a doubt, but I am a sucker and a total wuss when it comes to women, so I'm totally harmless and they know it. That's why they are comfortable around me. BUT, I can also tell immediately when a guy is hanging out with a chick just to wait for the opportune moment to make his move and when someone is just being friendly. My wife had male friends before she met me and I could really care less. But there was this one cat who would pop up every few months and be all like "Oh, is he right for you?" and "are you happy?" and other such bullsheought meant to make her question her relationship with me. I nipped that in the bud but quick. Once I pointed out his douchebaggery, she was totally on board. She didn't see it because she was so close to the situation. <br>  <br>  However, it seems like your girl is all about the power trip. You ask her to stop making so much time with her male pals and she's all "Ummmm... I don't know... ok, maybe" and then she makes no effort at all. Amigo, that's all about her flexing her muscle.<br>  <br>  And asking her to stop is doing no good, and telling her to choose you or her pals leaves you out in the cold or leaves her resenting you for taking away her fix. <br>  <br>  I'm not going to tell you that I think you should dump her, because obviously I'm not close enough to the situation to give you that kind of advice, but maybe you should get yourself some female friends, like a co-worker who's just up for some drinks or whatever once in a while. Preferrably someone who likes to sit in your lap and hug you a lot. That'll drive the point home to your gf. <br>  <br>  I DO recommend, however, unless you are planning on spending the rest of your life with this girl (think about this long and hard before you address that) that you prepare yourself for the eventuality that this girl is going to f you over. Do not convince yourself that she WILL because that's the wrong attitude too, but prepare yourself in such a way that if she does, you're not devastated or really even surprised or shook up. If she DOES do you dirty, you will be giving her a tremendous amount of power if she finds out she f'd you up over it. <br>  <br>  Man, I wish you only the best and I hope that everything turns out ok for you.|`|0JGFv5PXaa	u need to talk to her about it|`|4vdtR7sSaa	talk to her about it.. maybe the one guy is really close to her as in bff|`|Uyiw7bECaa	I am a girl and most of my best friends are guys.<br>  To be  honest, if my boyfriend asked me stop hanging around with my friends who were guys i would never listen.  After all, why should she choose you over them?  They are the ones that are going to be there for her after you split up.<br>  You need to take a step back, trust her, and let her hang out with who she wants.<br>  How would you feel if you had particular friends that she didn't want you hanging out with.<br>  Also, what excuse can she give hem?  You're putting her in a really awkward position.  She's not going to want to say that you don't ant her hanging with them because that would make you look bad.  Then again, she'd not going to want to lie either. So, take a step back before you start pushing her away.<br>  Try to hang out with her with them if you feel insecure.<br>  Good luck!|`|VHDLTFG2aa	just tell her (maturely) that you don't like her hanging out with this guy and you would prefer if she hung out with girls when you weren't around. but with in reason. if you don't let her hang out with boys she will think that you don't trust her and she'll go on and do it anyway.|`|lVaC4Ga4aa	if she sgood friends with the other guy, build a bridge and get over it. I have really good guy friends and mi EXbf got all shitty bout it, so thats one of the reasons i dumped him! Just leave her to have her own frineds and dont b 2 hard on her<br>  *^*|`|p7izYNBpaa	like she is like making you like jelous like. lol<br>   like yeah.|`|YZMdV5Wdaa	I am a girl, and my two of my best friends are guys. I also have a serious boyfriend who is currently away at college.<br>  <br>  I love my friends and I hang out with them a lot, but it's not because I want to cheat on my boyfriend. I just don't see them in a romantic way. That said, I have accidentally (drunkenly) made out with both of them on a few occasions.<br>  <br>  So your girlfriend probably isn't cheating on you, and it's not fair for you to ask her to stop being hanging out with her friends. But if you meet them and sense that there is something more going on, then there probably is (although it might not be serious).<br>  <br>  Bottom line: she's not going to change, and if you can't deal with her being close with other guys, then you should end it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|PK5Elowdaa	Its not your fault you feel this way. You're a guy and just like lions, we don't want any other male lions around our pride. She doesn't seem to understand it well enough. Explain to her how you really feel. Let her know that this is pushing you two away. If that doesn't work, I recommend you ignore her for a couple of weeks. Don't completely ignore her but don't make her your first priority. Turn down a couple of dates with her. Show less interest in some of the things she wants to do.  This will let her know that you stand by what you mean and that you are slowly moving apart. Hopefully she will understand how serious this is effecting her relationship with you. I mean by her doing that, to you, is really inconsiderate. If this persist,  I suggestion you give her an ultimatum. Change or split.|`|6ySVF6zRaa	ya tell her it bothers you and if she doesn't try to stop or she doesn't care you should really find a better girlfriend <br>                    Peace.|`|c612359d3dc728ddf7d727e22846b34caa	You will never stop that.

Move on.|`|VZ14JElBaa	Just talk to her about her actions and tell her how you feel about it|`|XjkdUliGaa	some girls do better around guys so they can get away from the drama and stuff so if u don't like it get a new girl|`|qp9RfkARaa	talk to her openly and tell her more about how you feel|`|Otatq4LTaa	Oh my goshhh! This is like the number one thing that girls hate the most about guys. They get extremely jealous, but I guess we know that you think that because you care about us and don't wanna lose us. But you just need to trust her, I don't think that she'll cheat on you or anythingg. I think that you have absolutely nothing to worry about. (:|`|bZCSRu8Iaa	Try to talk about this to he, If he is not listening to u... then find a gal who looks very nice compared to ur gals frnd n u always be with her... u should make ur gal frnd to know u always roam with her...

If you keep trying to control who she hangs out with and don't start trusting her, it might not end well.|`|6an7ubiDaa	She's just friends with them. chill. if you keep trying to control who she hangs with and all that, things wont go down well for you dude.

CM1dfztQaa	The term comes from a time when our government gave lands to the Native American tribes to live on and continue with their traditions. It was not to be touched by settlers or anyone outside of the tribes. As time went by the government took more and more of that land back to do with as they chose. And gave nothing to the Native Americans for it.|`|o1rzGR8kaa	Yes I still pissed

All the others were either flings, or never got to the stage of sex. <br>  <br>  With the first or the two, We had sex after about 3weeks of official dating, but we had know each other for a long time, so the trust aspect was already there. <br>  With the second of the two, she was a virgin when we met, and we didn't know each other long before dating, so we didn't have sex until we had been dating for almost 4 months.
QBFIpsGnaa	if  shes doing that, then shes not a real friend to u, even if shes ur best friend, u might not hers, especially if she dosnt want to hang around u. she might be mad at u 4 sumthing, have u been different around her? or not spending as much time with her? p.s, she lied to u, true friends dont lie.|`|nFTyOWMCaa	Just except the fact that she wanted to spend the night with her friend then bad go bowling with you.It really isn't that she doesn't like one over the other but she might just be trying to balance her friends.Just keep your chin up. She probably isn't even mad at you.|`|ZKlY5HYWaa	Call her out! she can't just get away with treating you badly. call her and tell her exactly what you said on here.|`|chPwS1BIaa	get new friends...|`|xnxrpKAqaa	this SAME thing happened to me and this is what i said and it worked AMAZINGLY:<br>  'listen, you promissed me that you would go bowling with me yesterday. you can not just turn around and hang out with some one else on the night you said we would go bowling, its disrespectful and it hurts my feelings. you dont seem like your the least bit sorry either. if your my true friend you'll either appologize or let me come over. and saying that you dont want me over is a slap in the face too. i like you as a friend and i dont mean to sound mean but i KNOW i can do better than you if you are going to act like this. so either appologize to me or i will find some one who values my friendship'<br>  <br>  good luck sweetie!|`|yL87FoPfaa	my advice to you is to confront her, and tell her you know the truth. ask her why she lied to you, and hopefully, she'll tell you. i think you should get your other friend to confront her too (the one whose house your best friend went to) as a witness? oh yea.. if your best friend refuses to confess, i wouldn't be friends with her anymore. or, you can just stick to her pretending you have no idea about this, only if you truly want to be her friend. Hope this helped! (Because it happened to me too!)|`|zO7Bgw9faa	Well the way it sounds is that your friend likes you only when your around. You've seen Mean Girls with Lindsey Lohan? well girls kind of back-stab each other.... I say if she says stuff like that behind your back then they're not a true friend. Confront her with the truth then go find yourself someone who really is a good listener and has always been there for you. Those kind of people are the best ones to have around... not the kind that are fake..... but ones that truely care about you..... Hope this helps... <3 Fuu <3|`|IC9ikMKoaa	She doesnt seem like a very good friend|`|iR1pZ5VTaa	i dnt think u should b frieds with them ne more........get new better friends|`|DBUmR8FTaa	keep her as a friend but not a best friend. She sounded like she wanted time to her self. Forget about it Have a sleepover of your own tomorrow. Ask you parents and start planning it, This will get your mind off it. I don't agree with the other answer that is just kids stuff. It is real and it hurts.|`|prjXvpL8aa	Your friend is a jerk! She probably just wanted to be with the other friend, or is mad at you. I would ask her about it. She lied to you and was a complete jerk, I wouldn't be her friend anymore, shes obviously not trust worthy|`|ou0sh511aa	All friends need a break from each other if you have been hanging out with her constantly let her have some time off it is nothing to be mad about besides she would'nt have been hanging out with you all those times before just to score free food now would she? no because she is your friend. Picture this would you like to eat chicken every single day of your life even if was your favorite food, no you just want to take a break from it for a day or so, so don't feel bad and get mad because that could ruin your relationship with her|`|rffdGwB9aa	Dang I hate when that kind of thing happens.<br>  <br>  A while ago, I had this girl who I thought was my best friend, bbut she really just didn't like me.. I think. She was a very evil and confusing person. But you should make her talk to you in person. Tell her about all the stuff that you know, then see what she says. Work it out, and see why she was acting like such a *****. She most likely is not mad at you, and, I know this is extremely harsh, but she might just not like you. (Wow, now I sound like a retard, huh?) ANYWAYS: I am just speaking from experence. She may not like to hang out with you that much either... I'm not all that sure.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.. I was kind of babbling. Heh...heh.. D: Soo... feel better soon :D|`|cuqP79Foaa	okay. it sounds like your friend wants some space. it kind of sounds like she is trying to shrug you off a little. why don't you find some new friends and call them up tonight. get her off your mind. just remember you are better than her! Good Luck!|`|6qnd87Wwaa	i think what you should do is ask her if she is mad at you. or you can say i know your at her house why dont you want me to come. you know|`|WrlD4xn6aa	confusing. to many "best friends." use like friend #1, #2and stuff. and i dont like responding to kids post. it's always, he say, she says. cry me a river|`|uMbToXcaaa	she might not be a true friend.... whatever you think is right, then do it. dont do wat other people say unless u agree with it. do what ur heart tells u. not random strangers....|`|yuDCktAnaa	don't worry about it... they are just stupid friends.. i have friends just like u. if they're going to be that mean to you and lie to ur face then you better get rid of them!! get some new friends or just don't hang out with her!<br>  <br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPED!|`|yPKrBiIhaa	the 3 way call thing was immature. just get ovr it|`|LUwxlzG4aa	its never good to get worked up this much about something. Friends dont do that to other friends, you have to be stronger and realize that you are the better person and that it is HER lose, not yours. some advice to you would be to stop talking to her for a while so she knows that you are upset, do not give in to temptation. let her know that you are in control of your life and that if someone hurts you, they WILL pay for their own actions, why should you have to pay for it?|`|bp0SbC44aa	oh sister i totally understand!!!! ive had plenty of girl problems myself and lemme start by saying that she is not a good friend for you, it doesn't matter if shes just mad at you, saying sheel do something like go bowling with you and then she bloed you off, and then lied to you, then you need to teach her what life is without you, so don't spend time with her or do anything or talk or text or anything with her until she comes to you and admits that she lied. then maybe forgive her, if shes your best friend then she will miss you, and she will ask for forgiveness. try it

5uzHW4CYaa	I know exactly what you're feeling, trust me. I'm barely over the guy I fell in love with three years ago. He's moved on, but sometimes, late at night, he calls me when he's drunk and tells me he still loves me and he'll never forget me. He's a total mind f*ck, I hate it. <br>  <br>  So you're not ready to get over him? I understand. Just play it cool, don't let him know you're upset, that just makes him feel better about himself, that a girl like you is still into a guy like him. Things like that are an ego boost to guys, they want you to keep hanging out while they've let go because it makes them feel needed and wanted. <br>  <br>  What I did, is I wrote down everything I was feeling by keeping journals. If you don't write, then don't write, I mean, you can paint, play music, dance, run . . whatever it is that you do to keep your mind free and happy. <br>  <br>  I cried and vented a lot, even if it was by myself. Stay happy and even get a rebound guy if you're up to it. Time heals all wounds . . I know it sucks to hear but it's the truth. You'll be okay.|`|Xvk3HeZcaa	I had the same problem and I was in a rut for months. Then I just decided that this person who didn't even have feelings for me was consuming a good chunk of my life. Believe me, I know it will be excruciatingly hard, but you should just stop talking talking to him all together. it turns out I was focusing so much on my love for this other guy that I wasn't paying attention to any other guys around me. Once I cut him out of my life and jumped back into the dating pool I almost instantly found a wonderful guy who is even more amazing then the first one. The first guy will always have a special place in my heart, but I moved on and I think you should too. It seems like you're causing more harm to yourself than good. The sooner you remove him from your life, the better off you'll feel.|`|ee17TXtcaa	if he did like you he wouldnt be hooking up with other people<br>  try to get over him. or just tell him in person how u feel about him.|`|zPU6aIILaa	mmmm at least he txts you.. mmm they jux told me... sorry i cant talk to u anymore.. im sure hes not seing anyone... so wtf..  know.. sense then i havent talked ot him.. is gonna b a month... i got over him... n foudn someone better... hotter.. <br>  <br>  but i dont feel anythign when i kiss him...<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnCGE6epIOP9ISArzySf2Ursy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220163458AAFzqc2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  mmm i think you should go out.. n have a great time wiht your friends.. shop.. go the the  movies.. talk to ur friends.. nnn.. forget about him.. he ll come back beggin when he knows u have  aa new bf... thatz what happedn to me.. with this guy.. he called me.. but i answer n said.. sorry i tought u couldnt talk to me.. so i hung up..

You'll have a lot more fun. Maybe when you two are alone at school, bring up the subject.<br>  <br>  "Hey, Destiny? I know we always go to the mall every Friday, but lately, I haven't been having a lot of fun... do you think you could help me get involved some more?

But, yeah it sounds like you still want to be her friend, if I was in your situation, I would go. People tell me I sometimes do that (turn my back on some of my friends), it usuall happens when I have something on my mind. When you get a time alone with her, ask her if everything is alright. there could be a family problem. it will let her know something is bothering you. Good luck!

Maybe you should check your hormone levels too. Higher levels of testosterone will increase hair growth (that is the issue I had... I got it regulated by taking hormone pills which helped the hair not grow back as much). I knew one girl who shaved her arms and they were constantly itchy and prickly.|`|RGRyDqBdaa	Well.

A person may think they are but no one but the Maker Himself is Perfect. You should ask yourself is it possible to find the one that truly fits you. The one that makes you laugh, catches your eye every second their around and the one that makes butterflies in you stomach. This is the one that needs to be your spouse. The one that shares your morals, beliefs and shares the way of life that you lead. True they say opposites attract, but even opposites share beliefs on marriage, children and general living the rest of your lives with someone. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|wXaGIPSPaa	I once met a man who said he was looking for the perfect wife. He told me that he needed to find someone who was beautiful, kind, loving, and very spiritually oriented. And yes, he had found such a women. But it did not work out. He said she was so spiritual that she could not easily relate to the practical things in the material world. <br>              Then he found someone who was perfect. She was beautiful, kind, loving, intelligent, organized  and practical in material affairs. She was just what he was looking for. But he said that also did not work out. Why? Because she was so practical that she really did not need him so much, and ended up being a bit of a nag, always telling him what he should do. So he still looked for the perfect woman.<br>              Then he found the perfect wife. She was beautiful, kind, loving, intelligent, organized, practical in  material affairs, as well as spiritually inclined. A perfect balance. No one could be better. She would make just what he was looking for--the perfect wife. <br>              So I asked him if they got married. No. Why not? Because she was also looking for the perfect husband.|`|WrlD4xn6aa	yes, some ppl do. but no most dont. but like is not perfect so you have two learn to ajust and put ya differences aside.<br>  I dated a gril for two years once. things were so good (closest to perfect) that i started doubt things and left her. i concluded that if it was meant to be, me and would end up together again,. but it was meant to be, not that i believe in that. but i am settle now and happy.|`|39e9dda5be0b2e2098eda11c3273a895aa	no one is perfect, but if you find that person who can look at you when you get out of bed, and still love you. then thats as close to perfect as you can get.|`|63a7e31b3b02cf9de77f9df2e50d7fe1aa	If you'd like some tips follow this link to an article about how to pick the perfect mate.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4728655_pick-perfect-mate.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4728655_pick-per...</a>|`|ihS1d5Ftaa	Hope i do|`|O36qjj7Oaa	There is no such thing as the perfect spouse but a couple can be perfect for each other.<br>  <br>  Neither me or my husband are perfect far it from it but we are perfect for each other.|`|QCfOUgxnaa	Neither of us is perfect- but we're perfect for each other!|`|B12E4rYiaa	No one is perfect there will always have to be compromise and some putting up with behaviors that you won't like.

Write to her tell her how stupid you have been an what a fool you were to do the things you did, you obviously still care for her or you wouldn't be worried what she did an with whom. Ask her for another chance to put things right between you an see what she say's I fit doesn't work then so be it. After all you made your own bed an cannot blame her if she tells you to lay in it Alone.

If she said she was sorry two or three times then she actually may be sorry. If she said sorry and you said you didn't care then i would understand. If she was your only friend and she was kind enough to be your friend and whatever then give her a chance. Don't lose something special over something that could been a mistake.

Hope you are honest to her about it! <br>  <br>  Everyone are beautiful. We are all going to be loved and seen as attractive. You obviously think your girl is hot and that is enough. <br>  <br>  For whom is she worried? Whose opinion is she concerned about? Her friend's? Yours? Self esteem is tough and a lot of young girls have problem seeing their own value. Our society is obsessed with looks and we're all supposed to look like super models. The magazines show photoshopped girls and even my photo is not really real... Our ideal is not for real. <br>  <br>  Of course she is a pretty girl, but whatever we say is unimportant. It won't help if she win the miss Universe comp, she have to feel the beauty from within. She has to feel she is valuable as a person, not a face or a body. <br>  <br>  I can't coach her through you. But I don't think you are helping her by posting photos on her as if it was a beauty competition...

XH2o1MM6aa	.Justin might find it easier to deal with this issue,if he could perhaps gt into her group of friends.That way he could involve himself indirectly with this girl.Once the butterflies settle down he could take a more casual appoach with her.
EioOPbzbaa	Your initial feeling is usually correct.  To leave that message she didn't call work to get it and to know your name for each other - she should never be included in that.  I would start watching his work hours, maybe park across the street especially during lunch or at the end of the day if he has to work late.  You should watch the cellphone records and see how much that number comes up.  If you have a friend that works there you could learn a lot.  Get to know the receptionist and start chatting with her.  You would be surprised how easily coworkers spill the beans.  Don't take his word for it, regrettably guys won't admit to it even if caught redhanded.  Good luck.|`|7cjqT33Baa	Your gut is usually right about these things.  If things don't add up in your head and red flags are going up, there are reasons for that.<br>  That is very bizarre her calling him your nickname for him.|`|jChr0udLaa	How does she know your nicknames for each other? Go with your gut and why is work giving out his number even if it is to another employee? You need to talk to your hubby.|`|iizKx4Bvaa	sounds like someone has alot os explaining to do. Do not let it go.|`|KEdmwuizaa	nine times out of ten your initial gut instinct on a person is right. i had a bad feeling about a few people and come to find out i was right about them. you need to talk to your husband about her and let him know what you're feeling.|`|BeTD0wY7aa	have you tried sitting him down and talking to him about how you feel? <br>  nice and calmly if you can, so as not to put him on the defensive. <br>  tell him that she makes you uneasy and you dont like that  shes contacting him outside of work etc. <br>   i know your angry but texting for a work schedule, it could be worse, now is the time to talk it out though. <br>  <br>  PS. i know im not a lady. lol but i figured id try to help out. i know how it feels to be a guy and have someone worry about that. Id really like if they could calmly and nicely discuss it with me instead of the usual attack.|`|7vk4xoKZaa	If you have had an uneasy feeling then you may have something to worry about. I think a persons intuition can tell you a lot especially if you have a real gut feeling. I think it may be a bit suspicious that she texted him to find out when she worked. Did you ask if anything was going on? If you ask questions they have to answer therefore they can't avoid not telling anything. I think you should keep your guard up because you don't deserve that kind of stuff. Sneaking around is childish. Good luck with everything!|`|WDs4fRoxaa	They could just be friends, but why she knows the nicknames<br>  that you call each other is odd.<br>  <br>  If they are only friends, why say she called the front desk at work to get his cell # to find out her schedule? It makes no sense. This is a big red flag.<br>  <br>  It does not add up.<br>  <br>  You should not be angry at her. He is the only one who owes<br>  you any type of an explanation.<br>  <br>  Best wishes
ajgC0KPhaa	If he is the one who tries to talk to you during class, I would say that he's interested in you.<br>  <br>  Regarding the beach situation, the concept of being at the beach is very unsettling when it comes to being social, especially if you're around someone that you like.<br>  Haven't you ever watched TV-shows or read fanfiction about nice guys who go to the beach, and he sees a girl he likes? The guy is always surprisingly shy, because he's worried about how compromising the position would be if he and the girl stood close to each other.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090212210557AAl3UEa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  Thanks.<br>  <br>  .
8FbOtXAXaa	First of all I don't think he needs to even be talking about his exes in your presence because it doesn't need to be discussed and he should not even be thinking about them. It is possible he is trying to see how you will react if he talks about them but then again why would he want to test you? It doesn't make sense to me. If he keeps talking about them, and it does bother you just ask him nicely to stop talking about them because you are not in a relationship with him and his exes.|`|TJEzMl00aa	if it's as often as you sed it is Thar's something up|`|8II1frHiaa	He is warning you.  you may become an ex and he will tell about you one day to another.  so, be careful with him and save yourself.  see, the girls only capital are their beauty and structure of the body.  if you lose your capital with these story tellers, believe me that no one will be there to give hand or to show kindness.  Thank him.  As i said earlier, he is warning you that you may become an ex to him. Awake, Arose and save yourself.
8YfYh3y0aa	You should go and you should be very polite.   You also need to have a chat with him about this relationship.  You have started playing mind-games with one another and that's a real bad sign.  <br>  <br>  If you can't be honest and loving with one another, it's time to end it.

Don't just be like "So you got a girlfriend?" type of thing, that's a tad obvious. I'd say you should just let the conversation flow and once it seems to die a bit, just be something like "So, anyone catch your eyes so far?"|`|UmVPqiylaa	God no dont call him,thats waaaaaay too forward and stalkerish...Text him..mention who you are and see how things go from then..Its much easier if its done by text cause it gives him time to think and it also gives you a chance not to mumble up ur wordds....Hope this helps..|`|pIRFfmO0aa	call him call him!!<br>  it would be great to talk to him and see if you guys are compatible and what not!|`|zPU6aIILaa	call him..<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnCGE6epIOP9ISArzySf2Ursy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220163458AAFzqc2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|dE8RxZMwaa	call him i agree with the first answer|`|S852p6SXaa	before you make a move, find out the girlfriend thing. Theres nothing worse then trying to get with the guy of your dreams and then all your hopes getting crushed when you find out hes dating someone else. so if you know any of his friends ask them if hes been seeing anybody lately or maybe one of his acquaintances, if they say he hasn't been and hes single then go for it. and just be you, go up to him and say hi and that you remember him from school and ask him what hes been doing lately sense graduation.
JhvqUvlsaa	Now that you've sent that email, see how she responds. If she does not seem apologetic AT ALL, then don't be friends with her anymore. She is in a bad habit of saying stuff that she shouldn't and that is bad news. You can do a lot better for a best friend and you will; I'm sure you'll find someoen a lot more respectful.<br>  <br>  If she says sorry then accept it but still keep her at arm's length until you see real improvement which you probably won't.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	get even tell her secrets .. so all know .. and make sum up to .. that will stop her ..|`|vv2uk9hHaa	Just quit telling her things, for god's sake. You should have learned your lesson the first time. Unless you like the attention you get by having your stories spread around. Or maybe you actually prefer she tells everyone so you can whine about it when the information you wanted to leak didn't have the effect you wanted (e.g. too shy to tell a dude you like him but when she tells him, if he's not interested, then you can blame HER instead of yourself).|`|WtGoMfhdaa	your friendship is definately over . i would NOT tolerate a backstabbing friend . they loose your trust and they can never get it back|`|TSZhrDMQaa	she is a backstabbing blabber mouth <br>  i would ignore her <br>  she probly has nothing better to do.|`|Z3HFBXwDaa	this is not a friend|`|AA11306029	Well, she's not much of a friend then is she?

Looks don't matter and if you guys have alot in common you should overlook his apperance.<br>  But I can understand how your feeling in a crazy sort of way|`|KJxwNfsaaa	LMAO . oh wow.<br>  you dont know if you would be able to kiss him.<br>  thats by far the funniest thing i have ever heard.<br>  so im not sure what your complaining about<br>  the fact that hes fat & ugly or that you cant kiss him?<br>   <br>  but im pretty sure you will be able to kiss him just find. tones of skinny people go out with REALLY HUGE people and they still kiss.|`|S852p6SXaa	honey its not going to work if you dont have some sort of attraction towards him, attraction is what pulls us to another person.  you might have alot in common with him but if theres nothing that physically about him that catches your attention then you might as well just be friends.|`|Xvk3HeZcaa	I wouldn't trust an internet date, but if you truly think you like the guy, looks shouldn't stand in your way.|`|Xly2sF6waa	Just be friends.|`|sGpjvGmMaa	Ok well you dont have to be attracted to someone physically to love them or like them in a special way because its whats on the inside that matters. Dont listen to the others talking about the whole package i mean what if a guy was good looking and was in a car accident that damaged his face then what?. If someone makes you feel special be grateful i mean it doesn't have to be serious i suggest get to know him better before jumping to conclusions but give him a chance because at the end of the day you want someone who genuinely makes you happy. Only the shallow people say looks are worth something they dont matter and what about blind people who find true love how do you explain that and dont listen to them they are just shallow people who are going to be unhappy and alone who said this because the size people up. Get to know him better if you want a relationship go for it or just remain friends.|`|JcV2nn4jaa	I know physical attraction is not all there is in a relationship, but it is at least 1/3 of the relationship.  Whos know, maybe you will find him attractive one day, but from how you describe him, I think he could be a good friend, but not boyfriend material...my advice is to let him know up front how you feel and that you really treasure that friendship and don't wnt to lose it.  Ask him to be a Pal, because if you let this get further and turn him down, it could be the end of any friendship you two have.  OH!  DON'T KISS HIM|`|7sA8HwTzaa	Sometimes people can overcome these things, but sometimes they just can't.

You may be able to better decide that way.|`|GUUa1s6Laa	Don't judge him before you meet him. The amazing thing with being emotionally attracted to someone is that it makes you find them more physically attractive then you normally would too!|`|DxYwNFdhaa	If the is NO physical attraction what so ever then I dont think a relationship would work out.

My best friend told me he liked me and i think i would have liked him back if he wasnt so overweight. If you cant imagine yourself kissing him than its not gonna last if you date him.

mDMnhqwdaa	If anyone, your husband should be the one person you can talk to..my advice would be to stay away from negitive things and people..sometimes the people that we have in our lives can bring us down and stress us out, in order to live a better life and be happy you have to sometimes cut them off and love them from a distance and try finding a new job because most old people are very miserable and misery loves company.|`|ON84EQaBaa	I think you need to be counting your blessings to be able to help, one day you'll get their age, I assure you you won't be young forever! you should not feel alone, you sit around older people, there's a lot of knowledge there sit back & try to learn something!|`|LmswcIdtaa	These seniors aren't as helpless as they seem in most cases. They are simply entering a new and probably frightening stage in life, just as you will be someday.(God willing.) If you were to take on some of those older people as friends or as adopted grandparents, you would learn a wealth about history, survival, and what you may face someday in the way of growing older. I understand the need to vent. I've been on that side too. but the best path to take, is to learn to sympathize. Later, you will learn empathy.|`|cd2b4472a17f3517a4f1fb0493c5d9dfaa	write it out or sing a happy song. go to the park && sit by the ocean. it helps to keep telling your self it all gets better with time|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Sounds like its time you find another job, maybe working on a beach or a tanning salon, probably a lot of young people there.|`|MzlEoOjQaa	Stop whinging and start winning!<br>  You are playing at being a helpless Victim who has no support, but in fact you choose NOT to tell the truth to your friends and husband,so you CHOOSE not to turn to them. <br>  You complain about how few jobs there are in your area, but you have a job!<br>  <br>  The old(er) people around you must find your company very uplifting (NOT!).<br>  <br>  You are NOT alone, but if you carry on as you are choosing to, you will probably end up alone - and blame every one else, I bet.<br>  <br>  I can understand that you are bored, but that is partly because you obviously lack the inner resources, the emotional intelligence, the creative energy and the maturity required to take responsibility for doing something different with your life.<br>  <br>  Yeah, yeah, you'll have all the excuses in the world, but you show little compassion for the helpless elderly. <br>  <br>  And, yes, I know this is very unsympathetic and you want someone to treat you like a needy child who's not getting what she wants, but I thought I'd speak for those old folks you speak of with such disdain.<br>  <br>  I hope you get what you work for, if not what you deserve!|`|AA12153783	If you have a Church you go to , you can go to your Pastor and let him know whats going on and he will listen and give you the answers you need and his advice is Free and you know he will never do you wrong .

The 2002 was a auto and the 2005 was a stick. She doesn't drive sticks. To shorten the story I re-traded the 2005 back for the 2002 and now I have a car payment for a car we had already paid off.

AA12322142	I think you should go!!! Your will get to know her better and if you know someone else who is going then maybe you could just stick with them if you don't feel comfortable. Also, you could call your parents to come get you if you really don't think you can stick around.

Plus it seems there is an element of jealousy because she made this comment calling him cute but did not use the same term with you. You call her reaction to your comment about her husband as sarcastic;could it have been surprise because she believed she was the only one who thought he was handsome? Plus what is wrong with a woman in her forties complimenting a guy half her age , what is the age range when you can compliment someone. Unless you are interested in her or think because she made the comment around you means that she is interested in you , or you would like her to be interested in you, I will suggest you find something important to focus on. Your question at the end of your piece gives you away and exposes your ulterior motive.|`|AA12252260	Don't look too much into this concerning your teacher.

nKuf2yl1aa	Absolutely, unequivocally without a doubt.. YES.. yes yes.<br>  Where do I start? <br>  It's true that being well endowed probably helps you to be 'good' in bed. It's like having two newbie snowboarders, one with all sweet new top of the line gear, and another rider who has all old hand me down gear that's not too great. The guy with the sweet new gear, looks super good and has a bit of an edge at becoming a better snowboarder than the guy with old stuff, simply because he has better equipment. However, just like snowboarding, in bed, it's all about technique & practice. If the rider with all the sweet gear practices improper technique and just fools around without learning the basics and building up.. obviously he's going to be shitty no matter how sweet-*** his gear is.<br>  <br>  Pretty much the exact same as guys are in bed. Yes, if you're well endowed you have a head start, however you can easily tank if you have no idea what you're doing, how well you're doing...or don't CARE to have an idea. Some guys who are better endowed i think can be like the new gear riders... they think the equipment will do the work for them. .. Evidently, they're the ones who are the guys who put their head down beside the girls head and just pump away without caring how she's doing or feeling. Losers, basically. And yes, for evidence sake, i've slept with a man who was well endowed and well, he was ... terrible. (see loser description above)<br>  <br>  It's all about paying attention to the woman's body, how she reacts and what she likes. Plus, most women don't even prefer intercourse as their #1 form of sex play (because for most women it's difficult to orgasm from intercourse alone).<br>  <br>  Pay attention & practice proper technique; which can be learned by asking questions! and being open and eager for feedback from your lady. I think a positive attitude, tenderness and perseverance is what makes a great lover, not necessarily the size of his penis.<br>  <br>  Good luck out there!|`|BorpWkDMaa	It depends does the "well endowed" take up all the room
AA10854518	I'm a bit confused about your question but I'm guessing you want to know how to get back at this guy? Well first of all, DO NOT let him know you care. Brush it off. Act really casual around him and flirt with other guys but don't seem desperate. When someone gives you the advice to 'forget it and move on' that's because that it is a great form of revenge because it shows that you are confident and do not need him. Do not let him see you vulnerable or sad or losing your cool at all. Guys love when girls do that because it boosts their egos, especially jerks like the one you described! Be confident, be yourself and don't let any man take your pride! You are a strong woman and do not let any man make you look weak and pathetic!|`|AA11313161	boys being boys|`|AA12185376	all you  are to him is a tumble. If that's all you want to be , go for it.

I can't really understand what you're trying to say.  Complete and coherent sentence structure is the corner stone of any language.<br>  <br>  Second, what are talking about?!?!?!?!  If you were a one night stand, that's the end of it.  He's moved on, maybe you should too.  And I don't recommend leaving messages to someone who wants nothing to do with you because it makes you appear like a stalker.<br>  Sorry to be harsh.  Good luck.|`|fcbf9c69312e0d0ad84f35fb32bb0670aa	Let me guess .. he looked at you ... he liked you .. he said few wounderfull things to you .. he has sex with you and then he dumped you ..

Sometimes you want relief when your partner isnt around or you dont have one so what are we supposed to do walk around like we are in a permanent state of PMS. Most people wont admit to masturbation cause society says its wrong.|`|f2fyXyulaa	First of all, you can't really put every girl in one group and say either they do that or they don't. But, more than likely they were just saying that. Some might have been showing their true feeling but, more than likely, some weren't. Hope this helps! (Every girl is different!)|`|6be171757a9dac013cbc5b3c82fdfe03aa	Depends on the girl.

ebHcrGdpaa	You sound just like me when I was your age.  Looking back on when I was going through all the drama of growing up the one thing I wished was that I didnt spend so much time caring about what other people think and more time having fun being me and doing what I like best, not because its cool but because its, ..me! I would give you the same advice, this Holly girl, honestly...sounds like a real jerk. I had a friend who did that to me when she became a cheerleader and it broke my heart because I didnt feel good enough, I felt like there was something wrong with me. Girls like that are a dime a dozen and you will encounter them your whole life.  Ignore it and move on, because they will never find true friends, and will never be happy because the things they find important are material and worthless... the girl that hurt me ended up in highschool becoming a total skank and when she got a bad reputation none of her 'friends' cared about her, because she wasnt cool anymore to them....what goes around comes around and you dont want friends like Holly anyways.  <br>  <br>  You sound like a nice girl who is getting hurt by a bunch of girls that arent half as great and understanding as you probably are...treasure the friends that dont care who you sit with at lunch and will be there no matter what, and move on from people like Holly who are fake and only wanted to be friends with you in the first place because you conveniently made them look good.  Good luck!!|`|7i9zha6Oaa	beat him/her with a baseball bat|`|kulDK5jsaa	It is entirely your fault! Go apologize to her immediately.  Have you no morals?|`|AA10824838	Wow that is long.  But I think you just need to give "holly" space.  Don't text her, call her or email her.  Be friendly, like if your passing her in the hall say hello, but leave it at that.  She may come around, with some time, or she may not.  Only time will tell, but you have done enough to let her know that you want to be her friend already.|`|nCZQL2Mgaa	Holly doesn't like you and that isn't a bad thing.  Just leave her alone.  Not everybody in the world will like you.|`|qWvstWGdaa	try to talk to her in real life, not over a text..and if that doesn't work, just whenever or if ever she tries to talk to you the just ignore her and pretend like you don't hear her like she does to you....|`|qzqEMB8Jaa	look friendship never ends. if she has forgotten that then let her do that but u still be the same but at the same time don't move around her pleasing her and reminding her of the old days i mean u keep ur self-respect high  and don't let her hurt u. if she doesn't cares then just move ahead.|`|rffdGwB9aa	Act with "holly" the same way she acts with you :D Be completely uninterested with her, and taaalk to your other friends a LOT.

Friendship had its ups and downs.|`|0Awd4VYWaa	i know this is long-ish, but i read yours! ;)<br>  <br>  you should try to ignore her and just hang with your real friends. try making some new friends so you can have more companionship in high school cuz it's hard to make friends in high school (unless another middle school is joining with yours)<br>  yeah, she doesnt like you. so what!!?? there are other people out there who are also waiting for friendship. just look around! <br>  i'm pretty sure there are other tables other than sportys and stuff<br>  and stop worrying about what other people think of you. once you get to know each other, then you'll get along and become friends!|`|0TXaPJDoaa	I'm having the exact same problem at the moment, with this girl at my school, we were really good friends over the holidays and now she's acting like i've done something wrong...<br>  <br>  My advice is to wait it out give her a few weeks to a month to cool down, and explore other people's lives, find some other people that you relate to. Talk to your other two friends and ask them what they think. <br>  Don't be scerad to talk to people you fought with, talk to them they might not still feel angry.<br>  <br>  And then when she's forgotten about acting wierd around you talk to her again. If she's still acting strange forget about her, because she's obviously not worth the effort!<br>  <br>  Hope this helped|`|A8S10nGBaa	Ok first of all DONT tell your friends about what you think of Holly, it will just start a fight between friends and you will all get broken up, I don't think you should sit at another table because it is good to interact with your friends. Maybe you should just sit down on the other side of Holly and join in, this Holly girl don't sound so pleasant so talk to your other friends and just be normal, just please dont start this whole " I dont like Holly she does this and that" and then start a whole mix-up Ive done it before and you arnt happy for a couple of weeks. Trust me just do that and try it<br>   <br>  Good luck! Im sorry about this girl|`|E7xOBER4aa	Well I have the same problem but shes only like that when shes in a mood with me or someone else, she always takes it out on me.<br>  <br>  It kind of sounds like shes jealous of you or being like that just for the sake of it, maybe she thinks shes more popular than you and treats you like her push over and like uses you when it fits for her maybe?<br>  <br>  When your talking to her next tell her that she needs to stop acting so miserable and tell her you just want to be her friend and you feel left out. She might laugh at you but then thats her problem and I'm sure your other friends would agree with you that shes being a little off with you|`|NjYCvfYGaa	Get a new friend, you're trying to be friendly and obviously it isn't working. It's 8th grade. Once you hit high school you're hitting rock bottom on the popularity list. I hope she knows that, unless she knows a bunch of juniors or sophomores. Don't worry about her hang out with someone else. There are nicer people that actually want to be your friend.|`|ZIHB84TDaa	well i would ask her in front of your other friends so she will answer more honestly whats her problem with you and if she says something bad about you your other friends will hear and stand up for you.|`|catPJUy2aa	OMG I CAN TOTALLY RELATE TO YOU!!!! this similar thing JUST happened to me but wayyy worse. My friend nicole basically got mad cuz the boy shes obsessed with doesnt like her and i told her that... Anyway she ended up threatening to kill me so the school got involved and the crap just went on. Its been about 2 months of her ignoring me but talking **** to all her friends (shes pretty popular, but soo many people r annoyed by her, shes quite a fake and ditz) well now she appologised and wants to be friends again (WOW) lol im kinda like watever, o btw im also in 8th grade lol... ANYWAY about ur problem, <br>  <br>  ok so it sounds like shes annoyed by u. sounds harsh, but thats what i do when im annoyed. i just kinda ignore them slightly, without being mean. This doesnt mean u cant change that tho! just try to kinda lay off talking to her everytime u c her and hanging with her talk to other people... u should also try to make plans with her and maybe other people too. Sound interested and fun! U should definitely sit with her at lunch but dont talk directly to her much. Just enhance in the tables conversation. Even bring up interesting topics. When she does directly adress you, answer but not with too much enthusiasm. I know I like mellow people lol. <br>  <br>  My questions to u:<br>  what social group would u consider her to be and wut about u? Popular?<br>  Also how does she dress, random but it actually helps lol<br>  u can ask me any direct questions im really observant and have helped people before and i have deaaled with drama sooo often lol <br>  i forget! lol<br>  a REALLY good idea would be find out who she really likes, as friend or like a crush lol and befriends that person, then make plans with him/her and ask holly if she wants to come, chances are she will and then BE FUN! <br>  hope i help(ed)|`|M8HVkIikaa	whooo<br>  I read that whole thing!<br>  <br>  =] well I live in a small town to and we are the athletic table..<br>  you se ihave a alot of friends and ya know at least one of them .... SYDNEY...doesnt realy like me.I text her. I try to talk to her...shes never intersested in what i have to say.shes just like Holly...I think you should let yourself free and find friends that want to connect with you an like you. Holly is going through a phase..she wants it all she has to socialze to get people to like her...but uhm...just meet new people.. DO WHAT SHE DOES. but dont be a *****. =]|`|3Dhacs6caa	Hmm, i understand how u feel, and almost everyone goes through this kind of stuff. i do have some suggestions for u. well if Holly doesnt start treating u like a friend anymore then stop hanging out with her. well, sit with her at lunch for a few days, as ur sitting with her and ur 3 other friends then start texting the people at the other tables and talking to them on AIM. start making some more friends from that table. and remember smile and say hi to everyone u see in the hallway, etc(: once, u started texting them and talking a little bit more with them, then sit with them at lunch. and if this Holly girl asks u why u didnt sit with her, then just tell her how u felt. and try hanging out with some new people, possibly at the movies, mall, park, ur house, their house, etc.<br>  ohh btw cheerleading is an awesome sport :)|`|123aGpwgaa	Get a boyfriend, then make friends with his friends<br>  then, you'll have more friends.<br>  obviousy if you have only 3 friends? That's kinda sad.|`|C59bTKO2aa	It sounds like Holly is interested in her other friends or forming new friendships, maybe to her, you two just don't have enough in common. Sit at the same table if you want to, but just be pleasant, don't try to force a friendship that she isn't feeling.   As for the other table where you don't think you'll fit in, you should be more open to talking to people with different interests.  I was captain of both the volleyball and basketball teams but I rarely talked about sports and sure didn't want to talk about games that had already been played|`|XAcxEVGRaa	You should try to make some plans with some other girls. When "Holly" sees how it's like being left out she won't like it. "Holly" i prbably jealouse because your a cheerleader and she couldn't make the squad or she didn't think she was good enough etc. Don't let her make you feel pathetic. Stand up for yourself. Good luck.|`|t5MwoKokaa	just forget about holly. and talk to your other friends on that table. once holly misses you she will come back to you<br>  and ask if you can go along with you friends if they are going somewhere. or orginise a big sleepover with everyone, including holly, so she doesnt have a reason to fall out with you.<br>  good luck
28WJwHf4aa	Communication.<br>  <br>  You need to sit your fiance down and express your thoughts and concerns. If he knows that the goal in the long run is to get married, then he should be fine with putting it off for a bit. Tell him that you  both have a lot of life changing events coming up and that you want to space them out so it doesn't feel so rushy and stressing. <br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|KTNqah9eaa	That's a difficult one, especially as you will both soon be bringing a wonderful baby into the world. And you are getting married in a week's time. There aren't any easy answers here except that it is time to talk. There's always a solution to everything, it's unlikely to come today, but will come at the right time if you start working on it today. <br>  I suggest the best way to start doing that would be to talk to him. He loves you so he'll listen and help. If, for some reason, you don't want to start with him, what about sharing your problem with one or two close friends or members of your family? It's probably best to start without any rigid idea of where you want to get to and just see what develops when you start sharing the burden.<br>  I do wish you well|`|vnJG8UYJaa	First, you need to put some thought into why you are experiencing these feelings.  Is it just emotional due to the fact that you are pregnant?  Are you financially ready for this marriage?  Ask yourself some really serious questions.<br>  <br>  When you have your thoughts in order, then present them to your fiance.  Be willing to listen to his thoughts and feelings about the situation.  Then the two of you can make some mature decisions about how to proceed with this relationship.  <br>  <br>  You have a little one to consider now.  Be sure you put some thought into how any changes in your plans will affect your little one.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|HeB9M5lgaa	Theres really no way to say it except to just say it. If you tell him and are honest he'll respect it. Reassure him that you are not saying you do not want to marry him at all but why not get married later in the year or next year even.<br>  but be sure that you really want to delay the wedding. I love my husband and was so excited when we got engaged yet the week leading up to the wedding I constantly questioned myself. Even shortly after. but now, I would never have changed it. I am so glad I didn't give into my nerves and back out of it. (we were rushed he is foreign and after his visa was approved we only had 90 days to get married. we had had to postpone our wedding 3 times because the government was so far behind on the paperwork. it was crazy.) all brides get these feelings usually its only nerves.|`|PyiCwi8vaa	I'd suggest you sit him down and be very open about it.  And make sure you make the point that you still want to get married to him and you love him dearly, but you just want to slow things down a bit.|`|7lmtBhdMaa	Two things<br>  1. Why did you get pregnant?<br>  2. Why did you move in together before u get married?<br>  <br>  You have rushed into it, but u should have thought of that before|`|a5DuXeGRaa	You could use the excuse that you want your baby to be there when you get married... that would give you six + more months
XGZBEdAWaa	Yes talk to him, tell him how you feel and ask him if he feels the same way about you. It takes allot  of guts to do that but at least you'll know where you stand and if he doesn't like you you won't have to waste anymore time on him.  Good luck, lol.
F8iYNurEaa	Oh for god's sake! I am so sick of all these ridiculous people who go on about buying milk when the cow's free (or whatever that stupid saying is)!!!!!!!! I have been with my boyfriend for 4 years and we have been living together for the past year and a half. We got engaged 6 weeks ago and are getting married next year. My best friend was living with her boyfriend for 2 years then they got married. My other friend was living with her boyfriend for almost 2 years and then she got married. I don't know anyone who has lived with someone and never got married/proposal and I am sick of commitment phobes scaring the c#ap out of others by saying that stupid milk saying. Not everyone is pathetic as you guys!!!!! People like this don't realise that not every man has a lack of morals and that some men were actually brought up to appreciate marriage. Anyway, rant over.<br>  <br>  I know people always say that you should never bring marriage talk up with a boyfriend but if you have a good relationship then you should be able to talk about anything with your partner. I would bring the whole marraige thing up in conversation and ask him whether he sees marriage as part of his future. You need to talk about it at some point. You don't want to waste years with a man who never intends to commit to you.|`|QBRPza93aa	If you feel like you're both in the same places in your life and ready to get married... you should bring it up, but if one of you is in a place where marrying isn't the time just yet. Just as an example, if one of you were unemployed or something like that(again, just an example). Than I'd maybe wait until you're both stable and ready for the next step.<br>  <br>  I think it's also a good sign that he wants to get married someday. That should make it a little easier to discuss it.|`|CQsD09D6aa	Why buy a cow when he can get milk for free? I don't mean to be crude or hurtful but that is how I feel about living together. He already has all the benefits of marriage without having to propose. Lucky him. I would give him an ultimatum. If he doesn't marry you by then then move on. There are other fish in the sea.|`|bf6K6uubaa	problem is...you're alreadyliving like a married couple so there comes the why buy the cow if you getthe milk for free bit...but anyway...you should casually bring it up...if you haven't recently...and say "hey when we get married and we do our taxed together we'll get more money" and see what his reaction is...or you can just ask him...so i've been thinking about taking our relationship to the more official next step and was wondering what are your thoughts on that...see what he says|`|R4YYdgmcaa	So what you are saying is you want to tell him it isok to ask you because you want to say yes. Not the way you want it to go. Wait and if he doesn't ask on his own then move on. If you push it he may do it only for that reason and then later it may come back to haunt you.|`|wOBZEFXFaa	Women have been looking for an answer to that question for years.<br>  <br>  First you need to figure out why he hasn't already asked you to marry him. You live together so it's not like he's afraid of commitment. Once you get that figured out, the rest should fall into place.|`|29I8PWrxaa	I think you should just tell him straight up how you feel.  Just let him know how important marriage is to you.  I was living with my fiance too before we became engaged.  I think some guys just put off asking if you're already living together because it's just like being married anyway.  He might just need reminded.

5DJzp6bMaa	Yes|`|jdRKZe18aa	still loving your spouse and yet cheating does happen, but being HAPPY is a WHOLE other story.<br>  <br>  Clearly there has to be issues, problems or things missing that need attention or fixing if someone strays.|`|4gZYucHMaa	~temptation is the creator of all evil...let's just say *it can happen*|`|O36qjj7Oaa	If their happily married and in love with their husband/wife no they wouldn't cheat because they wouldn't want to ruin a good marriage and relationship with their spouse plus they wouldn't want to put him/her thru that kind of pain.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Those that have a happy marriage or truly in love with each other have NO desire to look elsewhere and cheat on their spouse.|`|DenLZAL1aa	If they are happily married, there shouldn't be any reason to cheat.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	No.|`|B12E4rYiaa	Just because you are happy doesn't necessarily mean you are in love. And they may cheat because the are happy but not in love so they don't care if they hurt the other person.<br>  <br>  A person who is in love with their spouse does not want to hurt them so they will not cheat they know this is the ultimate betrayal. Not to mention they will not be attracted to other men/women.|`|jOyzcJd7aa	if the are HAPPILY married why would they cheat? If they are TRULEY IN LOVE there's no point in cheating. The reason why people cheat is because their not sexually happy or emotionally happy...|`|HGRBtDIiaa	why would they cheat if they were truly happy in their marriage.  i think that there probably would be something lacking even if they are not aware of it.|`|39e9dda5be0b2e2098eda11c3273a895aa	No I dont think happy people do cheat.|`|6b7eeb4f41fa6f871211ccd21d079e24aa	Yes, it is possible.|`|iD4ejChZaa	i don't think so, unless they were drunk or disturbed about something, still, there's no excuse,  it is wrong and sin.|`|BItkg1f0aa	No.|`|LvTIVjySaa	Skanky people cheat.<br>  <br>  Happily married people get enough enjoyment with their spouse that they are too satisfied, or better yet, too worn out to try it on with another.  They love and respect their spouse too much to hurt them.<br>  <br>  Now some people have open marriages, and that's a whole other ball of wax.  My personal beliefs prohibit that type of relationship, but I have had friends who had this type of marriage and seemed satisfied with it.<br>  <br>  I think the main thing is honesty.  If you don't have 100% honesty and communication, you don't really have a strong relationship, be it married or just dating.|`|rJaqsPFraa	Having been on BOTH sides of this situation, I can whole-heartedly say, something is missing if a married person is cheating. It's usually got nothing to do with performance in bed (like SO many people think!) rather, an issue of emotional distance or lack of intimacy.<br>  <br>  When one spouse doesn't give attention, the other spouse feels rejected and neglected - rightfully so! However, this does not excuse having an affair or "cheating" in any way, no matter how hurt or neglected one feels. In all instances, the partners should talk and try to figure out how to re-connect. If that doesn't work, maybe they shouldn't be together as a married couple.<br>  <br>  My spouse & I agreed divorce before we would cheat on the other!|`|VBCPdcetaa	i have friends who say the are happily married but do cheat. But then you ask them WHY they cheat and they start with a whole list of things they aren't getting in their marriage or things they feel they need to have. <br>  <br>  So I think a person who is cheating can convince them self that they are happily married.|`|AA10471068	Just because you love someone that doesn't mean you're happy.  I luvd<br>  my ex-wife dearly but was not happy.  When you live with someone you learn a whole different side of them. It may be a side that you don't like at all. Though you may not cheat, you do want out.  Some do cheat to compensate for the part they don't like.|`|WrlD4xn6aa	No. when you truely love your spouse, you dont cheat cause you self consious wont allow it. even if think of smashing a hot grl or a hot guy once you get that point or even talking on the phone you will stop and that is the power of true love.<br>  <br>  ppl cheat on their spouses cause they dont love him or her enough.  even if ya having issues dont mean you off and cheat.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	No they don't. Those who say different are fooling themselves. Why would you cheat on someone you loved, if you didn't love them anymore? You can talk about needing sex all you want, but there's more to marriage than just sex. Once you break that bond, it's over.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	Sadly, yes.<br>  Some very happily married persons (male or female) cheat for other reasons ...<br>  some like the chase<br>  some like variety<br>  some are in love with more than one person<br>  some have complicated lifestyles/schedules<br>  Some want some kinky thing their spouse cannot provide them<br>  etc etc etc|`|XpjUe2Gtaa	No, they don't.  If a spouse allows themselves to be in the position to cheat and they do act on it then obviously something was lacking in the relationship.  If you love someone you don't hurt them like that.|`|3GE1mJ3faa	No...if it is real, true love, no one would want to cross and hurt the other person.

oFTBbQMuaa	It sounds like he really likes you but he is not confident in himself. I think that he is saying things like 'you can do better' because he doesn't feel he is deserving of you. You need to tell Erik that you love HIM, and that you don't want to find anybody else. Also for number two I think he meant that even though you were in a fight he still cares about you and doesn't want to lose you. <br>  <3|`|MQCT1FXjaa	he likes you, doesnt feel good enough for you, and i agree with the first comment|`|1ad7aa5Caa	I think that if you know he's not the best and doesn't treat you like a queen, get out of this relationship and search for better guys.

We still hang out and get along very well.

He wasn't really her "type" so she broke up with him. I think she only went out with him because of his looks and because all the other girls love him. <br>  <br>  But my twin brother has had a couple of girlfriends since 6th grade and none really lasted that long. He just found a new one each time. There's nothing wrong with it.

Maybe you should re-think this - if the texting/calling is not just being a friend and is about relationship stuff, then maybe you should tell him that you want it to stop and he should find another girl that wants the same sort of things as him, and you will do the same.

Obviously he isn't ready to commit to you and since you can't change that then fix what you can. You can fix who you like, so it is time to move on if he's leading you on. I hate it when men and women do things like that because it doesn't make too much sense. There is something about him that you like and that makes you continue to play this game with him, but if you are ready to commit to someone I am 100% positive that you can find a guy with the same qualities, who wants to commit as well. Only go for men who want what you want, because they won't change their minds and you won't change yours so what's the point of dealing with a guy doesn't have the same goals? Don't call or text him anymore and if he does call or text you don't answer or respond because if you do, all you're saying to him is "yes let's continue the cat and mouse, I want you to keep playing with my emotions and I'll keep giving you attention even though in a few months you'll move past me".

Love is a strong word, sure...just like hate and loathe and dispise...but we can throw those words around like they mean absolutely nothing.  To me, there are 3 types of love in the world-family love, friend love, and soul mate love-family and friend love is one thing to consider-but when you're talking to a girl...or a guy...your 'soul mate', then I suggest making it clear that you're not just some phony lieing about loving said soul mate...and sex doesn't always count, either.

Historically, virgin referred to a young woman with no sexual experience, but in modern usage, the term can apply regardless of age or gender. Both historical and modern definitions vary in regard to what kind of sexual activity or experience determines virginity, and whether it is a physical, psychological, or spiritual state. <br>  The term is also applied informally to non-sexual matters. For example, someone who has never gone skydiving might be referred to as a skydiving virgin, and the first journey of a ship might be called its maiden or virgin voyage. It is commonly used in reference to purity; unalloyed metal is sometimes described as virgin, and olive oil is called virgin or extra-virgin if it comes from the first pressing and contains no refined oil. A similar connotation is moral purity due to inexperience; cocktails might be described as virgin when prepared without alcohol. <br>  <br>  so i hope i helped you! and im still a virgin to sex and pickle eating|`|W6LGsQC8aa	It is not a dumb question at all! As a Health Education student in grad school our professors always try to get us to give a specific definition of virginity, and it is always hard for us all to agree.<br>  <br>  First of all, virginity is a concept made up by people, and not a real physical thing, so there is no set answer.<br>  <br>  Some believe virginity is lost when the hymen (a thin piece of skin in the vagina) is torn, but any girl that is physically active (gymnastics/horseback riding/etc) can tear the hymen, so it is not the best definition.<br>  <br>  Another more widely accepted definition is when there is vaginal-penile intercourse ('regular' sex). But this definition also has a lot of gray areas, as this definition means that same-sex couples could never lose their virginity to each other. And what if the penis only goes in and does not orgasm? Still lots of gray area.<br>  <br>  Then there are all different aspects of sex that are unsure if they meet the requirements to have one "lose their virginity", like should anal sex count? What about oral sex? <br>  <br>  So your question is not dumb at all, as there really is not one definition accepted by all people, even in the field of health education we can't decide.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|MOcAhQXcaa	Yes you are a virgin until you do it for the 1st time .Once you do it you're a virgin no longer.So...wait until that special someone comes along it will be something that no one else gets but him.Its a gift that only u can give.

You pretty much got it right.|`|XjkdUliGaa	basically|`|4oFpT7m3aa	virginity means that you've never had sex before <br>  not much more to say about that|`|ILxQYrrPaa	In the strictest term; you are a virgin until you've had sexual intercourse with the member of the opposite sex. But this definition leaves a lot of people out of the loop. While the social policy makers look to redefine marriage to include same sex partnerships, maybe it is time we also revisited what it means to be a virgin.<br>  <br>  When we think of virgins, we think of "white wedding innocents" who define sex as a synonym for gender. But the fact is, the standard definition of virginity lets you get away with having a lot of different kinds of sex was still being able to call yourself a virgin. In theory, under the traditional definition of virginity, someone who is homosexual can have sex every day and still be a virgin. Someone who has oral sex regularly is also still a virgin. Does that really make sense? Something is a miss!|`|1qkdHe8jaa	a virgin is someone who neva had sex. ur mom is not a virgin. ur 2 month sibling wud be a virgin!

Your decision on whether or not your are going to be sexual with this person is your own. If he doesn't respect it, then he's definetly not someone that you should devote any time with.

Why would someone act like this for no reason?  There must be some reason that you feel has happened.  Maybe she's physically exhausted or mentally tired or overworked or worried.  People do change over time esp with stress.  She sounds mentally unstable to me.  Does she drink or do drugs?  I would speak to a minister or a marriage counselor.  You have to be cautious that she doesn't hurt you (ie, jail or beat you) or vice versa if you should return.

I wrapped my arms around his neck and starred at his lips. He stopped talking and smiled, while I looked up pretending to be frightended and then embarrassed. I got closer and closer, until my cheek lightly touched his face, and he turned his head and kissed me. Does that help? I guess just kind of gaze at his lips and get closer and closer. That's what I did.|`|YZMdV5Wdaa	Apply some lip gloss or lipsmackers in front of him, and then tell him how good it tastes. Then smile and asks if he wants a taste.|`|nnlWIAniaa	Gaze directly at his lips while he is talking.|`|f0XuYQsbaa	alright so first just ask him when the last time he shaved was, then slowly feel his top lip, then put your head closer and then very slowly pull away. he'll kiss you don't worry. hope that helps|`|3KAiV9zTaa	when i want a kiss from my boyfriend, i nuzzle him on his nose and then under his neck. its so scary sometimes because he knows what i want half the time. and then when i want a kiss from him, i put my forehead against his, and i talk to him in a really low voice and BOOM! i get it. then when me and my boyfriend both are hugged together on the couch, its obvious to what we want sometimes because we gaze at each other for like 2 minutes, and i follow the shape of his lips with my finger and he does too and then we kiss. or i just make him give it to me. either way works.|`|klcqgST9aa	Lick your lips and look from his eyes to his lips, back and forth, stare at his lips a little longer than he eyes.. <br>  <br>  If you want a more obvious hint, take his face in your hand and stroke his lips with your thumb, maybe while you're talking to him.<br>  <br>  (Not when he's talking, that could be weird.)

If he forgives you give him another shot.|`|we2Csi51aa	no. and i wouldnt forgive your bestfriend either. your better than that. get a guy who doesnt need other girls to love someone and ur friend sounds like trash for doing tht to u|`|HChxgBUaaa	HECK NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  He will do it again and he wil hurt you screw him and your best friend and get new ones.|`|FHm7LGPSaa	He cheats, your best friend is not your best friend.

You don't have to do anything to make him happy, if it makes you uncomfortable. And if he can't be patient, then he can go find someone else. Some people move faster in new relationships, and some people take things slow. So we all just need to find the right match, that's all. Continue to do things or not do things the way you want. Either he's all for you or he's not.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	Be yourself - that is the best advice I can give you - if that is not enough to make your new partner happy, then in the long run, it won't work.<br>  <br>  If you can't be yourself - then he is wanting you to be somebody you are not, and you can't keep that up for a life-time!|`|POHWTDPRaa	Don't do anything that you aren't comfortable with and that doesn't come naturally. If you aren't really a toucher, don't try to be. That would not be fair to you. He needs to be more understanding.|`|S852p6SXaa	well how long have you guys been dating? if its only been a few days then tell him your not ready to go that far, you still want to get to know one another and get in the groove of the relationship. if you been dating more then a couple of days or months, then try to just a little forward, if its something you really dont feel comfortable with then tell him so you guys can take it slow.

You might offer to do something small to help instead, but only if you're feeling generous.|`|7qr2GprBaa	That's really sad...she must not have very many friends, so I understand why you are trying to be nice about it. <br>  <br>  Tell her you don't feel like you would be able to help her in the way a maid of honor should, and she deserves to have someone who can really be there for her. Explain the situation with your time constraints and how you barely have time to take care of your own family. Hopefully she will understand.|`|7XG5fd5Xaa	This is your day, your friends will get over it if they are truely your friend. Im getting married this year and decided to go with only bridesmaids, not a maid of honor so I didnt have to decide who to choose, my best friend or my sister. Thats what my friend did for her wedding. And her family was ok with it, as for me my sister was not happy about it, but she will get over it, after all its my day. And on your wedding day its about you, no one else!|`|aipChC3haa	I really think you that what you said on the last paragraph that you wrote is what you need to tell her.  It's polite but to the point.<br>  If you honestly don't want to be a MOH, then say no, but I think that if you honestly could, then try!<br>  It could hurt her feelings, but if you say it because you don't have time/energy I think that she won't be too upset.
1ac39fcfa274ce08e7a2111bc679183aaa	Giving him space is best. If he wanted to be with you he would have stated that in the text that he sent. If and when he is ready to resume a relationship with you trust me he will make himself clear, you will not have to guess.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Dont sit around waiting for him to get in touch with you.<br>  <br>  If he really wanted to be with you he wouldn't have broken up with you.<br>  <br>  Move on with your life without him.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	I am not for revenge or playing games. If you want him back after what he did to you, go for it. Otherwise, just let that text message hang and go have some fun. Good luck.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	now your chance .. tell him what you want ..and see if he agree with you ..if not go party ..|`|B12E4rYiaa	It looks like he has a drinking problem and may be an alcoholic if this is the case try to get him to get help. Alcoholics are like Jekyll and Hyde just like drug addicts so you could be in for one heck of ride. <br>  <br>  Or he could just be immature and incapable of commitment which ever it is you need to decide if you want to deal with it.|`|EPaYoJaiaa	Yeah you definitley were rebound and I bet you ANYTHING that between new years and now he tried to get back with his ex that he was with for 10 years. She probably turned him down, which is when the drinking at the bar alone started, and he's started thinking of you again.  I don't know how long he waited between his break up with her and getting together with you but he is obviously NOT over her and in a very dark place right now. He's right he needs to get his sh*t together. He needs to get back on his own two feet BY HIMSELF and get on with life. He won't be able to do it with you as his lap dog. HOWEVER you CAN be there for him as a friend, but nothing more at the moment.<br>  <br>  FYI: When someone says they need space and need to figure some stuff out a week is nowhere NEAR enough time. WAY WAY too early to have contacted him again.|`|lyWSufFBaa	"Hi, how are ya?" does not mean, "Hey, I want you back." <br>  <br>  You seem to be jumping the gun.  You just said you don't want to be a rebound chick and if you continue to mess with him that's exactly what you'll be.  No man should ever cause you to become a complete wreck.  That means you love him more then you love yourself.  You only dated him for 5 months so technically you don't even know him.  Just be his friend because that's all he really needs right now.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Don't walk--run--and don't look back. Warning: Drama alert the man you are attempting to see is apparently dealing with a lot of drama or just causing a lot of drama.|`|iD4ejChZaa	nothing came his way sex wise so he gave you a text, but he wants to see what else is out there. I wouldn't trust him, he'll hurt you again, he is not ready to give up his independence, but that's his peragotive.|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	If he texts you again just say Im giving you the space you needed. and I think you made the right decision not texting him back, just be strong, you will meet a new guy in no time!|`|MVxFOI5naa	I would let him know you got his text but unfortunately you are busy -be busy for a while -make him earn his way back to your heart-otherwise he will not value your relationship and this will happen over and over again-good luck|`|0ox8VKwKaa	You are doing the most healthy thing you can for yourself and the relationship.

If he wants you truly, he will date you and treat you with respect.  If he can only muster up the will to communicate with you when his butt's on the bar stool, he's not worth your time.  Move on.|`|JKlLd598aa	Just keep giving him his space.If he really wants you he will CALL you,I know, what a weird concept.Most men do not like a woman that seems desperate.Most men also want what they can't have.So just bide your time,he will either come around or he won't,either way,do what is best for you.Good Luck!|`|WrlD4xn6aa	no, this has nothing to do with age.<br>  you are doing the right thing tho.<br>  dont give in easy.<br>  why are you even still thinking about this guy. he dumped you 2 months ago.<br>  anyways. if you do end up texting him back. give really short responses.<br>  if he ask to meet up. say you are busy for now or something.|`|AA11323563	you sound like you are about to become a booty call. Its up to you if that is the sort of relationship you want to have.|`|dTaGzh6Haa	You're on the right track so far by not responding to the text. Rebound is right, and so is the other advice you're receiving here.<br>  He's lonely and that's all. Do not try to be his friend if you want to be his girl. Let him figure his s **** out and then and only then talk to him.Of course by then you may have forgotten what you ever saw in this jerk. Sorry, but if I had a nickel for every guy who has sobbed on my shoulder or one of my friend's shoulder we'd all be millionaires. <br>  Be the queen you are and cut this one loose. Who needs a freakin cry baby?|`|wJZAwxrpaa	Well sweetie you answered the question yourself ,smart girl i went through a break-up and now i'm by myself and enjoying life on life terms so i know how he feels he  does'nt want commitment from nobody.You are the rebound person when he wants to bothered with someone thank god he only calls you and not anybody else.When he's not with you he's with other guys just doing him and theres nothing wrong with that he don't want one on one right now.

Don't be silly--you're way too young and need a lot more life behind you before you make that kind of decision.  He's jeopardizing his job, he could be paraded in front of news cameras on his way to jail....cue the music..isn't it romantic?<br>  <br>  You are putting him at risk for going to jail...even though it's consensual.  Take a break...you'll be legal soon enough.

You're a child and he's an adult - your TEACHER to make matters worse. You could never date while you're his student, and I doubt very much if it would ever work after you graduate either. You should be reporting him for sexual misconduct, not encouraging him! Stupid girl.|`|xBd96wvRaa	A wealthy teacher?<br>  <br>  Ok factual inconsistencies aside. You must keep the relationship a secret until you are 18. <br>  <br>  But really don't you think it is pompous and immature that he only is willing to wear certain name brands? His morals are flexible enough he will date an underage student? He lies like a pro? <br>  <br>  Do you really think he is worth the extra effort to try and make this cluster of a relationship work? <br>  Why don't you give it a break until you are 18 and then see if he still seems so dreamy?|`|LSCG8aGVaa	i think you could make it work. BUT you MUST MUST MUST be careful. PLEASE be careful. do not tell many people about this relationship. well you can tell peopl.e just seeing this guy is not illegal. but having a sexual relationshp with him is. so watch out. and dont broad cast things like that. wait until your at least 18 to make it clear that you guys are together. please be careful.<br>  <br>  good luck. i hope i helped :)|`|gYuJUyvvaa	You could make it work, just wait until your older like when you're AT LEAST 18 but for the age gap then 20+ for you would be best.|`|TAMGy07Daa	Theres no such thing as a wealthy high school teacher..<br>  <br>  lol?<br>  <br>  i dunno, i dont think you should stick with him. he might hurt your feeling badly

You think that a girl likes you, but you are just not 100% sure about it. Would it not be handy if you can identify easily some 'clues' and figure out (for sure) what a girl really think of you?<br>  <br>  Now here's some good news - you can indeed easily find out if a girl likes you - simply by observing her body language! When a woman likes a man, she will inevitably send out certain 'clues' which you can easily decode - all you need to do is to be aware of them and start to actively identify these clues. Read on to discover the easiest ways to know for sure if a girl likes you...<br>  <br>  Three Body Language "Clues" She Shows If She Likes You<br>  <br>  Clue Number One - She Invades Your Space. Is she leaning in your direction when she is talking to you? If so, it's a sure clue that she really fancies you.<br>  <br>  Clue Number Two - She Twiddles With Her Hair. This may happen subconsciously - she definitely likes you if she plays with her hair while talking to you.<br>  <br>  Clue Number Three - She Becomes Extra Chatty With You. Does she ask you heaps of questions and makes lots of comments when she is having a conversation with you? If so, then good news - she likes you.<br>  <br>  Now that you know that she fancies you (or not), what is then to do? Simple - you will need to bring things to the next level by intensifying her feelings that she already has got for you.<br>  <br>  One simple way to do this is to use this 'covert hypnosis' tactic called 'fractionation' - which is known to be able to make a woman fall in love in as little as 15 minutes. Absolutely mind blowing stuff.<br>  <br>  Before you use this technique, you must first heed this warning...<br>  <br>  Fractionation is considered as a 'dark art' tactic which is the basis of hypnosis-based seduction, and while controversial, it is known to be one of the most effective tactics ever invented by underground seductionists.<br>  <br>  It is described in a step-by-step system in the Deadly Seduction Manuscript (<a href="http://www.TheSeducersGuide.com)." rel="nofollow">http://www.TheSeducersGuide.com).</a><br>  <br>  These psychology tactics are highly unconventional techniques that are used by the secret elite in the seduction community. Use at your own risk. I personally vouch for the effectiveness of these tactics, but care must be taken as they could be outright dangerous in the hands of the unscrupulous.<br>  <br>  But if you're ready to get girls without breaking a sweat, then do this.

When you do this, look for some unappealing trait that he has developed.  After you've parted ways, try to concentrate on the stuff that you don't like and not what you DO like.  You will never forget him, but you do need to learn to forgive him for taking your heart.

AA12400627	That is more than a broken heart! She is your ex wife....who is now remarried? So she ups and leaves current hubby....moves to your city to be closer to you? Then builds a life with you.....and just when things start to gel....she goes back to her husband???<br>  <br>  Okay, so you feel crushed? You have been duped, although it was great while it lasted? You gave it your all and she did not appreciate it? That is so wrong and heartless!!!!<br>  <br>  She used you while she was upset at her husband, and as soon as you got attached, she decides that she would rather be with him! She is a user and you need to realize she was not worth it!!! <br>  <br>  Look at it this way....better in finding this out now than much later when you have wasted more time and money on her! Burn her out of your mind.....and rebuild your life! Separate yourself from all the things that reminds you of her! She is not worth your time, nor your tears!<br>  <br>  Use that pain to motivate you to work harder at bettering yourself.....and believe me...this woman will get what she deserves! It may not be in the way that you want it to be, but it will come back to her! It is the law of nature and she cannot escape it.....<br>  <br>  Be positive and think positive....be strong and move forward.....put everything behind you, but take one small step at a time...and soon enough you will realize you are better off without her!<br>  <br>  One day at a time....you will get through this....and you deserve love form someone who can love you for you.....and not use for what you have!!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck and let the past be the past....look to the future....who knows, there may be something much better waiting for you!|`|Qe95LNxYaa	time heals all the wounds|`|R5SGjlCyaa	If she loved you in the first place she wouldnt have left you. sounds like she saw that you were doing well for yourself and wanted to reap some of the benefits,sorry but she used you. leave well alone.|`|jkL4K7otaa	dude like really what i think is you need to fight for your kids if you dont mind me askin was she married to this other guy when you guys weresleeping together|`|ujIeOsDNaa	How to Deal with a broken heart?<br>  <br>  1.

I'm sorry you had to go through that.|`|wtPYkznQaa	I find that it is wrong that she came to you, then out of the blue left with the kids and her husband to move to another state. To deal with this situation, please don't drink, do drugs, or have mean less sex that will just hurt you even more. It takes time to mend a broken heart. You have to take time to figure things out and decide what your going to do with out her if you two don't decide to get back together. As you get stronger fight for your kids because they need you in there lives. Well I wish you the best of luck. I hope that I could have helped you out any way possible. If you need anymore help, please contact me.

It will probably hurt alot but you are young, so not for very long.  Plus, it will hurt even more if you try to stay and the cheating just goes on and on.<br>  <br>  You could also develop a mentality in which you feel like you don't deserve to be treated well.  From then, it's very hard to start new relationships and keep them.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you do love him very very much, but sometimes just because you love them doesn't mean that they deserve your love.  Be honest with yourself and do what is best for you in the long run.  Good luck.|`|q66hhy20aa	Recently this kind of thing happened to me... my exboyfriend broke up with me for another girl. when i found out it really hurt.... i loved him too. i still like him but i dont know how much anymore. after the breakup my friends helped me realize that he was a jerk for not seeing me as more than someone he can mess with and get away with it. he was a loser and i see that now. point is, anyone whos gonna cheat on you isnt worth your valuable time and your breakable heart. im sure hes great.... but theres better, more worthwhile guys with values out there waiting for you. youve just gotta find them.
1YdeUn1Caa	Yes, and illegal. He's "friends" with you, because women his own age won't give him the time of day. So he preys on little girls. Be careful. He'll be on the attack.|`|TjePtr7Aaa	wow|`|M8HVkIikaa	he wants to pop ur cherry....never ride in the car with him k?|`|CtUVT49Gaa	the fact that you asked this answers your question.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	he will get her in the end .. try to keep her besy .. so she wont be able to see him .   do you understand what i mean .. that will stop it i think .. dont you ..|`|pKzH1cFHaa	He needs to be reported.

Tell your cousin to stay away from him until she's 18.  By that time he'll probably be in jail for statutory rape, pedophilia or kiddie porn.|`|GSaazia3aa	if theyre friends.... sure but dating- thats sick and disgusting and twisted|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	No way..alarming at that..have friends your own age|`|mFlvTGXZaa	wow ok tell your friend to cut off the ties. its one thing if she was older. he is creeping and if she doesnt commit to him something bad is going to happen like rape. best of wishes for your friend|`|AA10864190	eww..<br>  thats disgusting..|`|S6FLJ64Qaa	stay awy from this pervert!!  this loser can't attract or doesn't want to attract an adult.....Is this guy's name, "Chester?"|`|VMUwtGCuaa	he sounds like a paedophile. he will hang around and wait for the girl to drop her defences and then pounce.|`|l5Q8lq35aa	You need to stay away from this guy; he seems like a pedophile.<br>  I'm serious! A 23 year old guy who does that to a 13 yr old girl<br>  must be very lonely. Shouldn't he have an adult girlfriend his age,<br>  being interested in children is NEVER okay no matter how it is<br>  handled. I know he might be a good guy and stuff, but he needs<br>  to stop it! Always make sure you are never with this guy no matter<br>  what, and don't let your cousin be alone with him. <br>  <br>  He's just creepy!|`|XkidpdPWaa	Well, the man is a pedophile. Besides the fact that love has no age boundaries, this is illegal. Your friend and you should surely see this. This will most likely end in rape or her marrying a man 10 years older than her at a young age. Let's be honest, you don't want to marry at 18.|`|KozV63xBaa	thats sick and disguisting.<br>  <br>  he could be arrested no joke|`|XAcxEVGRaa	He seems okay. It's god he doesn't like touch her or anything. He's respectful of her and that's important. But if your cousin didn't like him she wouldn't be hanging out with him. She knows what she's getting herself into, don't worry.|`|60FCA8dVaa	Very wrong.

I mean, I tease him for being old, and he envies me for being young. I think it's all gonna be Okay though. Just go with the flow. Maybe you'll get to know him how I know Jo.|`|R5pBAyMMaa	That is REALLY wrong...that guy isent right in the head, if he has a crush on her now...your cousin needs to get away from him..looks can be decieving and a 23 yr. old can EASYILY overpower a 13yr old..|`|oHKpy4IRaa	I think it's alright for them to just be friends. Age is just a number and in my opinion it really doesn't mean anything. As long as they're not dating or anything because hat would be illegal. I guess it is fine for them to be friends. If he was going to hurt her he would have doe it already and she would have told her parents. I think it's normal but that's just me.|`|rIzx4OEWaa	There is a ten year age gap but there are many people who have been married for years with bigger age gaps between them so that in it's self is not strange but the fact it is to all intensive purposes a relationship/friendship which her Mother an Father condone is wrong an should be discouraged at all cost. The girl in question is way to young to know what type of person he really is, he could be a paedophile an loose any interest in her in a few years as i am sure she will when she starts getting chatted up by boys her own age. <br>  I cannot understand her parents an feel she needs to have some much needed advice to help her steer clear of him as much as possible, try to get her to meet some boys er own age that might make things easier. I wish you every success.|`|FeRC5jkoaa	this guy is a straight up LOSER ! Tell him to get a life and hang out with people his own age.. Thats not normal at all.|`|vv2uk9hHaa	That is downright creepy. Obviously there is something really really wrong with this picture. A normal guy that age wouldn't hang out with a "kid" like that (no offense, but at 13 compared to 23, that's a kid). The whole proposal thing seems like a technique to manipulate her so she'll trust him. Ask yourself, why isn't this guy with a girl his age? There's gotta be something awfully wrong with him if no girls his age want to date him. He sounds like a creepy pedophile to me. It's unhealthy for a guy that age to hang out with a 13 year old. She should tell him to leave her alone and not even try to contact her until she's 18 and able to better assess the situation. He's trouble. And by the way, a normal guy would date a girl about two or three years younger, at at age. You only see big age differences in older couples, where the younger person was an adult already ( 18 or more ) when they met.|`|9Ni21lHpaa	THIS IS NOT A NORMAL 23 YR OLD!!!HE'S GONNA BECOME A PEDOPHILE TAKE YOUR COUSIN AND RUN!!!!!!!|`|BOXEPEA6aa	It's not wrong, I guess.<br>  As long as you're not like, friends with benefits or anything =P|`|Em9wu87Kaa	First of all no but u shouldn't be liking him like wanning to marry him. for example, you could ask him out but it has to be when you're older like 20 and he's 30? u see no it's not right hangin' out with him.|`|CURZ8bOzaa	Yes, it is wrong. No matter what a guy says, what a guy wants is sex. That is a very wrong relationship.|`|f79674f11cb0d8833ea9b2f32ce01461aa	It's wrong|`|Ts5EoS1iaa	HE IS A PERVERT!!! He also seems kinda stalkerish....<br>  <br>  Watch him continually!|`|SuQFjKtSaa	13 is kind of young but see girls are more mentally mature than guys so i mean mentally you would be on his level but be careful he might play you. and if he cant get girls his own age i wouldn't want him but if he can then he's okay!|`|EbVpz2Yfaa	Absolutely not ok - her parents need to put a stop to that friendship - even when she is 16 - he'd be 26 - still too old.|`|Z3HFBXwDaa	yes it is all this guy want is sex|`|TRHLmzrBaa	NO IT AINT RONG CUZ AS LONG AS U DNT DO NUTTIN ITS ALL GOOD|`|AA11306029	I know my parents wouldn't alow this.

I think he should find sum1 else. N the gurl should tell him that the age difference is just too big. Im not trying to be mean, im just being honest. But she shouldnt be with him. He's wayyyyyyy to old for her. I dont think they should be friends either because he likes her too much.|`|bp0SbC44aa	NO, and I'm telling you this because NO NO NO, he wants you to, you know, get jiggy with him|`|jGBtosiCaa	Well i have always hanged out with older people...most of my friends are in there early 20s...My best friend is like 26 n we talk bout EVERYTHING he was i guess interested in me at first but as we grew closer he was not so interested we still are friends with NO benifits i talk to him once a day we been friends for 2yrs now almost 3.

7HuNXrgvaa	No, no matter how hard this situation is you should not do something so  permanent. Once you are gone you are gone forever and you can't change that. If he went out with this other girl, obviously he wasn't thinking of you at the time. So, that tells us he could let go at anytime. <br>  You shouldn't beat yourself up for this guy. Suicide is not the answer.. Please rethink and sleep on it. Everything will be okay.|`|kX1PolCUaa	Don't killl yourself. Right now, it feels like this is the most important thing in the world, but look back 10 years. Do you even remember what mattered to you then? So 10 years from now, this will be like that.

Just baby steps. Trust me it will all work out. Good Luck.|`|XkidpdPWaa	Damn it! It's not the end of the world! Apply yourself! Forget about him and find someone or something worthwhile.

Just don't kill yourself, your family loves you and your friends too.  Hang out with your friends more, I'm sure you have some.  And go to a therapist.  That should help.|`|S6FLJ64Qaa	no you should not!  call your minister.|`|6GpN0NOIaa	dont let a guy feel like that  cut awy from him compleatly find a new crod u dont need the drama if it makes u feel better spend time out side fore some reason it makes me feel soo much better and if your realy on the subject of dieing call some on like a therapist or school consuler or think of it this was<br>  ever tim u wake up your onday closer to dieing so the best was to kill your self is to be alive and you were the fastest strongest best sperm out of millons and a pride like that cant bring u down|`|q66hhy20aa	suicide is not the answer!!!!!!! your life is so much more important than this one guy. if this guy is making you feel this way you need to either a) fix this stuff with him by telling him how you feel tell him you want to be friends and maybe more or b) MOVE ON!!!!! the way hes making you feel isnt healthy!|`|eyGRSIh1aa	Don't kill yourself.

You can work through this.  It might take a while, but in the end you will be happy with the decision you make. We are all meant to be here.  Start paying close attention to the things you enjoy and do them again.  Don't focus on the negative things going on in your life.  For example...get into exercising, reading, baking, take a class, and so much more.  If you feel lonely, go out with friends or find a book club to join.  You need to stop moping and focus on the good things in life.|`|e4DAjaYUaa	Dont kill yourself!!!! I know it things my seem bad right now they will get better!!! You sound like you need a Friend.

eVK2zZsOaa	Well I don't know how old you are but that is the way it is. Some parents just refuse to let their children grow up and be more independent. He just loves you and wants to protect you. Don't get annoyed by it, enjoy it because when you become an adult you are going to miss daddy's love and care.<br>  <br>  You can prove to him that you are getting older and you want him to treat you as if you are getting older. If you are old enough to work, get a parttime job at the mall so that you can start spending your on money. Clean your room and help out around the house. There are plenty of things you can do or you could sit him down and tell him that you don't want to be treated like a kid anymore. That might help.|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	It's a big responsibility being parent now days. Just be thank full he cares about your well being.|`|oVvtGrqHaa	well if you're not responsible you probably won't get treated your age.<br>  helping around the house and looking after siblings will show you're responsible and not a little kid.|`|AA11648899	Act like you're at least 9.|`|NJ9Ytksraa	LOL!<br>  I ? 1st answer!|`|NbOCIyBPaa	how old are you? 9?|`|W5WClV7iaa	show him that u are not a little boy. that u are a well and full responsible man(or soon to be, whatever). once your dad sees that you are a grown guy then he might back off a little.|`|yPKrBiIhaa	act more responsibly and do chores... but ovr all parents nvr stop babyin u|`|ee3N1lpQaa	he loves you and care for you thats why<br>   just let know how you fill about it|`|f79674f11cb0d8833ea9b2f32ce01461aa	turn 9?
8uzTVZVtaa	Who ever said this may not be interested in intimacy. It is sign of weakness, or a waste of that person's time. You're point of view is acceptable, but not important to him. What a nerd. I think he's been watching to much Star Trek or something.|`|py0HNOHDaa	sounds like someone has gotten to comfortable with a partner and no longer try's to woo there other half and has started to let themselves go a bit.
5AaMDz91aa	I'm going to agree with the person that wrote ontop of this.  Babysitting helps.  Not kids around in your neighborhood?  No problem.  Are you good at something?  Photography?  Painting?  Poetry?  There are lots of contests that give away money for their top winners.  Try googling contests.  Another way is to sell some of your stuff.  Say you have a really cool purse, but it has just been sitting in your closet.  Sell it!  It'll make some quick cash.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  K|`|bL9APqogaa	Babysitting really works as you get paid the same day. But make sure you ask your parents about babysitting first even if you don't tell them why you are doing it.
cYf5IacRaa	Well, if you don't talk to him, then honestly, I wouldn't suggest telling him how you feel. He might just think it's weird and that would be very bad. Try to make conversation with him and get to know him. Once you've reached the point of being friends, then maybe you can tell him, but until then, I would hold off. Best of luck! :)
aDL7xmt6aa	So just get over it already.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	You are too sensitive.

I had basically the same thing happen to me, my fiance took a pic with this girl he isnt really friends with at a bar, where he works, he knows I cant stand this woman because she is always flirting with him, and trying to talk to him and touch him, so the fact that I found the pic on her myspace, on a night when I wasnt there, I felt betrayed. They looked like a couple. Its not right, maybe as women we feel differently about this then guys do. But I feel for you.|`|VBCPdcetaa	That's terrible!|`|AA11077276	?|`|WrlD4xn6aa	cry me a river. grow up.<br>  it's not like he was making out with the grls or having sex with them.
eVK2zZsOaa	I have two comments about this.....<br>  <br>  The reality of it is....You are 21 years old so your mother has no say so in who you date. She missed out on that chance by a few years. She is only 26 and that is not that much older than you. <br>  <br>  From your mother's perspective... Are you sure she has a problem with the age or the child? Plus she might have a problem with you being 21 and already engaged. Maybe she wants you to date for a few years and then decide on getting engaged and married. You might find that you are not ready to get married (and already have a child) at 21. There is no need to have low self esteem over this situation (that is already a sign that you aren't mature enough to be married with a child). Your mother probably knows you, and knows that you need to wait a few years.  I am probably sounding no better then your mother but I just had to throw that in. <br>  <br>  But anyway your mother has to accept it....you are 21 and there is nothing they can do about it. It is your decision now...|`|xQn3rR6Naa	You are 21 and an adult. Time to stand up and be a man. If you are not living on your parents dime then they really shouldn't have a say in what you do or who you hope to marry. <br>  I ought to be easy enough to bring this woman with you to neutral territory like a decent restaurant and have her meet your parents. It is often hard to accept something that you don't know anything about. Let them meet her, and then they will see that she is the kind of a person who made an early mistake in her life and is behaving like a responsible person now.|`|M5oMYc9Laa	I know how you feel.  I also know how your mother/family feels.  I have a 30 year old son that has several times almost hooked up with women in the same situation.  They on the other hand didn't have good careers or much to offer intellectually.  Having said all that remember,  this is YOUR LIFE!  When your mother was your age she lived  her life as she chose and did her own thing.  It sounds like your fiancee has a lot going for herself.  You are an adult, a grown man that is entitled to live your on life your way.  She is only five years older than you that is not a lot.  So what if she has a child.  Clearly, she was in a prior relationship and has a child so she made a mistake.  It didn't stop her from completing her education and getting herself together.  Your mom is stressing but she cannot live your life for you.  If you want to marry and you are feeling good about it then you should go for it.  Mom is over protective and trying to meddle but don't you go for it.  Parents raise their children to grow up, take care of themselves and gain personal independence and that's just what you are doing.  Good job!  If you want to get married then by all means the choice is yours and yours alone.|`|1EhbLBkUaa	If your mom has such control over you so that she can "not let you see" someone you're dating, then you might not be ready to marry quite yet, anyway.  If you're such a good match, it will stand the test of time -- only a few months! -- until you graduate and, I assume, become independent.  Then you can demonstrate to them just what kind of a life you will be building with her, by doing it.|`|MWjNp6y3aa	When you get married you are to leave your mother and father and cleave unto your wife. Same with the woman. It is your life man and you seem like you have a good stable mind. Being a father to a child that is not biologically yours will be difficult however. Just be knowing of that. If you cannot be allowed to discipline and take care of the kid as your own then it will not work. The age thing is nonsense and trivial. The 5 year difference doesn't make a lick of sense. However I would date and live with her for at least two years before setting a wedding date. Trust me...I married young and got divorced young too. I am only 23 and have been without her for over a year and a half. Good luck to you man. <br>  <br>  Your life, your decisions, your life experiences. Tell your mom you will do what you want and will disown her if she keeps threatening  you. No mother wants to lose their child. She will listen up if you are serious with her.|`|i15KoiJhaa	Good Grief.<br>  <br>  Your Mom needs to get a grip and realize that:<br>  <br>  1. You're an adult<br>  <br>  2. Your Fiancee' is only 5 years older then you<br>  <br>  3. Your Fiancee' is also obviously taken the high road and is getting her education possibly in spite of her circumstances being a single Mom<br>  <br>  4. Just because your Fiancee' has a Child and is a single Mother, does NOT make her damaged goods<br>  <br>  My darling, this is your life to live. You seem like an intelligent Guy who knows what he is doing and what he wants in life and more then that, you are doing what you need to do to achieve that success and happiness.<br>  <br>  Tell Mom and Dad that you are sorry they feel the way they do and it is unfortunate that they feel the need to judge and cast the first stone before they know the Girl or what you feel.... I would feel it necessary as well to let them know that this isn't the way you had perceived their views to be growing up... that you think they did a great job with you as Parents and it is now time to see the fruits of their labor in allowing you to live your life with success, happiness and love.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|p2poEwSXaa	Time to make up your mind.  Your 21, old enough to do and buy what you want without your parents decision.  All I can say is I hope your thinking with the right head. Make sure if your family is wealthy or in a better situation than hers that you have all your bases covered.  From what I can determine just go with your heart.  Your mom and family can't choose your life. If they're really your family they will see your love for the woman and understand its bigger than them.   TIME FOR YOUR TRUE INDEPENDENCE
HJrTuihcaa	wait, why would it matter if she's white?|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well, I know men's number one fear is being rejected by someone they like. The only way you could know if she likes you is just to ask. Or you can give her your number and see that way. She may just be being nice to you and then she could be interested. Sound's like she is being nice though.|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Well, it is probably always going to be taking a chance to ask this girl, or any girl you like - they could say no - but you won't know if you don't try (unless they are very confident and ask you out first).  If this girl laughs at your jokes and is happy to spend time with you and sort of seems self conscious, such as with her hair, when you are talking, that could be a sign.  Maybe try to spend more time socially out of class, such as group outings to the movies, bowling etc if you can do that.  Asking her is a risk, but remember that you are friends and she sounds like a nice girl.   If she says no, it would not be because she didn't trust you or didn't think you were a nice guy.  Also, it is not likely that she would make fun of you about this.  Good luck, hope it works out for you.|`|tMEUPBo4aa	It sounds like you are either, afraid of what your "boys" and/or friends going to say ... and/or you have a major "fear of rejection".<br>  <br>  Look, you like this girl ... you only live once. I say, Man Up and ask her out or for her number. If she says no, politely say, "Thank you" and move on. If she says yes, the hard part is over. She's into you, you are into her... its all good afterwards.<br>  <br>  All in all, she is just a women and I never understood why guys are so afraid of speaking to women!!!|`|54qBK15laa	Dude, don't be afraid of rejection.  Once u make a good friendship with a girl u start to feel different about her.  I'm in the same thing right now.  Just go for it and if she rejects u she will probably be friends with u.  She will respect that u had the balls to ask her out and she will probably say yes.  Look for tips that she likes u and if u find some ask her out.|`|HZgjUguWaa	if she didn't think u were cool to begin with she wouldn't talk to u period ..So ask for her # the worst that can happen is she says no.  But oh baby what if she gives it to you!!!!!|`|gea2XyUwaa	Well, a good excuse to ask for her number is to say, "Hey can I get your phone number? Just in case I have a question on homework or something."  So that that way, she doesn't feel like you are hitting on her or anything, and its polite, and for a good cause, and you can always ask her other things too while you are talking/texting her on your phone so you can get to know her better.  Most people won't turn you down if you ask for their number, just so you know, and you talk to her in class already, so it shouldn't seem weird at all.|`|Zqby1cXpaa	first of I dont get why you had to put "white girl" in your Q but no just talking to her is not enough if there are deffinate signs of flirting like her trying to touch you or her staring at you for long periods of time then yes she likes you but if you just talk then that doesnt show anything I have a few friends that are girls I talk to everyday JUST FRIENDS|`|QCF9nHDLaa	Hi. O.k. so do I have it right : You like this girl,can't tell if she likes you ,and are afraid to ask for her number?<br>  <br>  My opinion would be to just start asking her to join you and your friends to go to like a movie or something.Or you could just ask her if it would be o.k. for you to start hanging out with her friends. Bottom line- don't make a big move as to ask for her number get to know her better first.O.k.?|`|AA10789153	I think the question here should be "Why did I have to enter the fact that she's white in the question?" Otherwise, just go with your gut dude.|`|FfGIZe7jaa	Ask for her number it's a risk but it's worth it if she says yes.so go get some digits.|`|ZRS0C1CXaa	I say go for it you don't know until you try. you two might be a great match!!|`|ikL5ZdfAaa	why did you mention shes white?|`|r1NYkcKMaa	what the hell.....what does it matter if shes white? is that an issue for you?
XcxL6ZMqaa	im sorry, and i hope someone helps!|`|ZII6YCk1aa	Maybe it's not about you and there's something else on his mind. Try actually talking to him instead of trying to figure him out mentally.|`|z5Hl6Bhtaa	I don't think it means anything really. If your being nice and not doing anything to make him do that then maybe he sighs alot. Your looking into it way too much. He sighs that's all, you didn't do anything wrong!|`|GBC39wHAaa	It means I don't wanna see you, I want someone else, and you're in my way or I don't really like you that way, but you're not getting the message. When my ex gave me that look, I would say how dare you, if I make you look that disappointed I dont wanna be around you. I dumped him.|`|7ca00ab095cf88b23620a56d48169edbaa	If you like him, talk to him!  Gosh.   What do you have to lose?  And if he really likes you back then put a smile on his face!   Come on, what do you have to lose?|`|AA11648899	KIDS.|`|AA11922229	Ask him.|`|WVAd2l7Xaa	Sorry to tell you, but it sounds like he was just trying to be a nice guy to you, but he doesn't like you and guesses that you like him, which of course gives an awkward feeling.<br>  <br>  In other words, I don't think he likes you.|`|gaWZ79gNaa	It means he likes you but doesnt want you to know or anyone else to know..<br>  <br>  <br>  boys are weird like that.<br>  <br>  I know 50 year olds who still act like that!!<br>  (see i bet you the person who gave this a thumbs down is a male and he's probably 50 yrs old!!)|`|8KgwSgimaa	ask him wtf his problem is but but he might just try hiding his feelings towards u or if not hes just a total fucken *** hole if he dont give u any explanations tell him to go **** himself den and move on|`|GfXhyUBZaa	If I did that...<br>  <br>  It'd be because I think the person who I was sighing at would never like me (he could have low self esteem, or really, really, likes you.)|`|aUDVBmZSaa	He probably doesn't want to lead you on with a smile.|`|CC4fUcRsaa	Could be hiding something from you, what that is have not got a clue.|`|Lg6Y8HdZaa	it could mean many things, we don't know for sure....<br>   ask him.|`|OSjQ86ySaa	Aw!<br>  Maybe your taking it the wrong way?<br>  Maybes hes embrassed because you look at him because he likes you! Maybe next time this happens look at him and smile.<br>  See how he reacts to that.:]<br>  Or maybe just talking to him?<br>  And do you know him at all?<br>  is he just this random kid who looks at you and sighs?<br>  haha good luck!|`|c4YabDIRaa	Girl, you must be stupid fly (good lookin)! The boy WANTS YOU! He is probably just self conscious and doesnt think he is good enough for you. Do you ever say high to him? try thatt, so then he will think "well she is talking to me, maybe she is interested." If yall just adore each other from a distance, nothin every gunna happen. <br>  <br>  Talk to him, hes probably just really shy.<br>  <br>  ~瑞士人|`|Qkg98XtHaa	Its probably because he wants to get your attention and get to know you.

How is his business doing in NY?  Is he an equal "driver" in the business with his partner?  Does your career have a better earning potential?  If his business is doing well, and there is a legitimate chance of success in South Africa, perhaps you should consider a short term visit.  You wouldn't necessarily need to move there, but what if you went there for a couple of weeks (and took a leave of absence from your salon)?

Don't disrupt your life in the U.S. of A.  Your fiance should never have dropped the bomb on you.  He should have first discussed it with you and then let the two of you make the decision since you are in a real since his "partner in life".  He can go without you.  If it's only for a few months it will be good for your relationship in the long run.  He needs to see for himself what life without you is really like so that he won't make a decision like this again.  Let him go for a few months.  You stay put right where you are!|`|d39dc2a48a86bf08c5bfb20d68522559aa	Yours does not sound like a solid relationship. He can't be without you for TWO MONTHS?  What about all those servicemen and women over in Iraq who love their spouses but have to be away for a year or more?  Don't be angry with him. Just tell him to go to S.A. and you'll be here when he comes back, assuming he comes back before summer. You don't need a man who is so demanding that he requires you to be with him 24/7. The only reason you should go to South Africa with him is if you'd like to get married and live there with him. That is reasonable. But, if he's coming back in two months, don't go.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Since you are not willing to leave him, I would say try it out for 6 months to a year.  If you absolutely hate it, then something has got to give.|`|DenLZAL1aa	You stated,"His best friend & him opened a tattoo shop in South Africa a couple of months ago & he has dropped a bombshell on my head the other day" This says it all, if you can see he didn't consult you on this beforehand. You also stated that he has family in SA. The proof is in in the pudding. He lied to you by omission, by not keeping you informed of his venture, and now he wants you to move to SA. I would advise you to consider that things are much different in SA, and you are in his control once there. Trust your instincts.|`|AA11198190	Life is a challenge.<br>  lf you both love one and other...then you need to support one and other as well.<br>  l would say go.He has a business which he wants to succeed in....<br>  Be there for him.You say it is only a couple of months,so that is not all that long.You can always come home....if you don't like it there.|`|iD4ejChZaa	tattoos, blood, south africa, aids, he's crazy.|`|EzZk2pyNaa	If it was me, I would tell him I didn't wanna go, because truthfully, I really wouldn't wanna go.|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	Do not move i made the biggest mistake of my life when i moved with my husband to a different state. I so miss my friends and family now not to mention all the little things i was so use to doing. It has put a big strain on our marriage. It would be much worse for you because your talking about a different country so everything would change for you. The life style the food the people the environment not to mention the danger If you don't move and his business goes down the drain he will blame you he won't come out and say it but you know he will and it will escalate into something much bigger. I'm sorry but it sounds like your damned if you do and damned if you don't.
F8iYNurEaa	Red dress??? Yuk. And Chris De Burgh. Hahahahahahahahahhaah. I want to go to that wedding just for the laugh. It makes me cringe just thinking about it!!!! Please please please remind her of this conversation when she actually does get married in about ten years time. I bet she'll cringe too!<br>  <br>  Anyway, as far as symbolism....I think red is an important colour in Indian weddings but other than that????? If you are thinking more along the lines of "What does choosing a red dress say about my friend" then i would guess that she is a little bit "racy" and she likes to be different.|`|vpKhZvYraa	Because the evil little devil himself, Chris DeBurgh, wishes it! Also, the song is called 'Lady in RED', that's RED. Lady in RED. She wants a RED dress and she wants the song Lady in RED played at her RED wedding.<br>  <br>  I hope you are able to REDeem some dignity by uncoveRing thE Definitive answer in this riddle. I hope you are REaDy to step back into the world, meet with your fRiEnD and discuss her wedding plans with her further. REaD with care, wouldn't want you to miss anything, would we now?|`|28WJwHf4aa	It could be her fave color....<br>  <br>  Wearing a colored wedding dress is becoming more acceptable and popular nowadays. The focus is being taken away from tradition/etiquette, and the rules are more flexible. It's centered more on what the bride wants, as oppposed to what she is, technically, supposed to have her wedding.|`|rI7J9M8taa	Passion, romance, excitement.  Studies show that the color red has a physical effect on people, increasing respiration and raising blood pressure.  Brides who choose red want to turn up the volume on their wedding day, wake up all the old timers and get them up on the dance floor!|`|CQsD09D6aa	Red is popular in some countries. A friend of mine who is Russian got married in red because red is the traditional color of the wedding dress in Russia.|`|eb3d326190ecade0f226972a952e9dbfaa	Married in red wish she were dead, married in black wants to go back, married in green not fit to be seen, married in white, shes alright. (old saying)|`|7a8db8d183d13feb7759bd9779e41ee3aa	maybe she likes red!!! Red does have meanings in different cultures though. A traditional Sikh wedding dress is red.|`|0e7e2273a98e965ef6963c7287e9faffaa	It doesn't mean anything, it's personal choice. My wedding dress was purple because it's my favourite colour! We don't all like white you know!!|`|PyiCwi8vaa	Well, red dresses are starting to become popular in weddings and they're different from the traditional white/creme/ivory colors.  I'm looking at red wedding dresses aswell|`|1cPB2NYfaa	Maybe she likes red...|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I think a red dress symbolizes a bride's wish to be different, modern, nontraditional and to follow her own path.  I see nothing wrong with it.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	It symbolizes that the bride likes to wear red and doesn't care about silly traditions. Period.<br>  <br>  Although in south Asian countries, especially India I believe, it's the norm for brides to wear red, just as most brides in the US wear white/ivory. In those cultures, red symbolizes joy and happiness - just the color for your wedding day.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Red wedding dresses in Asian cultures symbolize love, passion and festivity. Why shouldn't they be able to mean the same thing to a Western bride? Even ancient Greek and Roman brides wore red. Maybe red happens to be her favorite color and is most flattering on her.<br>  <br>  Not everyone wants a white dress or looks good in them. In those same cultures, white symbolizes death so brides don't wear it.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Because she likes Red, because she looks good in red? Google an image search for red dresses. they are GORGEOUS!  Most chinese woman get married wearing red actually.<br>  Red doesn't symbolize anything.  Just as white doesn't symbolize purity and virginity (as much as people like to think it does, they are all wrong) and black doesn't symbolize death or funerals etc etc.|`|WFFXHFfVaa	Prob just likes the colour red...nothing wrong with that|`|4426582303692fa8410a0ca12979ceb7aa	It's all in the mind.

AND HE AINT A FRIEND IF HE ALWAYS MAKES YOU CRY YOU SHOULDNT EVEN BE CRYING OVER A BOY LIKE THAT. YOUR BETTER THAN THAT GET YOUR SELF ESTEEM UP GIRL YOUR YOUNG YOU AINT GOT NO REASON TO BE STRESSING OFF SOMEONE THAT AINT GONNA BE THERE IN YOUR FUTURE  ESPECIALLY IF HE TREATS YOU LIKE ****. I DONT THINK ITS RITE WAT HES DOING WITH YOU HES BASICALLY PLAYING YOU AND HE KNOWS THAT HE CAN HAVE HES CAKE AND EAT IT TO CUZ YOU WILL BE RIGHT THERE AT HES FEET AS SOON AS HE NEEDS YOU SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS PICK YOUR SELF UP DUST YOUR SHOULDERS OFF GO OUT WITH SOME FRIENDS HAVE A GOOD TIME AND DONT TRIP OFF THAT GUY.

IF YOU GIVE A GUY TO MUCH IMPORTANCE THATS WHEN THEY KNOW THEY CAN TREAT YOU HOW EVER THEY WANT, BE STRONG GIRL GOOD LUCK|`|yH8jzvgZaa	The question isn't whether you like this guy, it is whether you love yourself. You need more self respect. With that you will not tolerate this guy stinging you along. Take six months apart and move on. You are young and deserve to be with someone who treats you right.|`|d61W6VB3aa	BEEN THERE. The crying, the "never again will I let him take advantage of me, oops not again" garbage. You will get over him if you try, I promise. There are literally billions of guys in the world, of which you've only met a few. So many guys out there are just like him in their positives, but have more in the awesome department and less douchebag qualities. There are actually guys out there who won't make you cry ever! Just because you haven't met them doesn't mean they don't exist. You're only 18, and up until 18 are the years you meet the least amount of people, because you're probably cooped up in school, living with the parents or whatever. Unless you live in a small-town commune of 20 people, you will meet someone better. Go travel, do new activities, get out there!
4d6feb857be7f242bc72dde7f3799e1caa	Girl if you were mine and I even thought you were THINKING this way You young lady would have a knot in your uhhuh!!! You are still a baby in an adult's eyes. Girl, do you know how many girls there are that THINK their SUPER BOYFRIEND is what you call loving you...a BOY his age don't know what love is and you don't either. The truth is, as soon as he gets in your pants, it's NEXT! And you're dropped like a sack of sh....anyway. What you are talking about at this age just shows your immaturity. To have to go on this site and ask a question like this shows that you ARE NOT READY FOR SEX, LOVE OR A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP. Grow up pure. It's the best gift you could EVER give yourself. If he LOVES you he will respect your wishes and wait for you. If he doesn't wait, then he doesn't trully love you. I am 35 years old with 2 kids, two kid's daddies, and have already had a hysterectomy....you know, where a surgeon takes out all your reproductive organs.... due to the HPV VIRUS. Study up on that one. I had cancer....due to having sex. Due to having sex at an early age. Due to having sex with more than one partner....I also thought my first boyfriend was the one.........NOT!!!! You have the rest of your life for a silly thrill called sex. What's the hurry? Yeah, it feels good at the time. BUT IT AIN'T WORTH SCREWING UP THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!!!!!<br>  Please WAIT. PRAY THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE TOGETHER INSTEAD OF MAKE OUT. GOD WILL APPRECIATE IT.

As hard as it is to believe right now, you're going to regret losing something so important so early in life. If you love each other as much as you think you do, you'll wait until you're older and more ready to handle the physical and emotional ramifications of it... or, heck, even till you're married. I promise you it doesn't stay this bad forever.|`|TVwZMBD1aa	Your still too young and I know it can get pretty crazy but there is so much in the future you don't even know if your going to stay with that boy and have regrets trust..I mean my friend got pregnant at the age of 14!|`|KuKa4EOmaa	When you are older and mature enough to not be embarassed by the thought of our friends knowing and when you can drive yourselves to the store to buy your own protection then are you ready for sex.|`|yVyBY5ESaa	Hun, you REALLY need to consider waiting til you're at least 18 years old to have sex. 13 is wayyyy too younnngg!

You may be exactly what he needs to get serious about his life.    I would simply ask him not to make judgments on your parents with out meeting them.    He can only get serious about the relationship if he is feeling good about himself.---and that's the way you should want it  (he seems like a keeper to me)|`|a1b6b5962587dcb80b0e16d346f15ac8aa	Tell HIM what you are telling us!

You wont be able to change what is insecure about...but what you CAN change is his perception of your parents.  The only way i see this happening is to actually get him to visit your parents.  It might be a good idea to talk to your parents about it as well.  <br>  <br>  Bottom line is this.  If he is uncomfortable about his financial situation..and you really care about him...consider this.... live within his means.  It may mean that you dont have the nicest car...or the nicest and newest clothing, but that you can put that money that you are saving....into a combined savings.  Then you can both use this money to improve your lives...rather than him leaving a humble life, and you living a better life.|`|06480cda5bc785d8b48dc8af6c054b93aa	The quick and easy is to have a conversation with him about money, personal finances and goals.  If you haven't had to worry about money and can afford the things you  want....and he has financial difficulties and has to worry about paying his bills...then it does create a bit of a difference.  Spending time with eachothers families can show comfortability and acceptance.  but you still need to talk about it.

AA11119626	Boy, can I relate. My family once owned a house in a popular tourist spot with a very popular annual event. People we'd never heard from before suddenly noticed how they hadn't ever visited us and laded on our doorstep - every year at event time. Mom and I ended up cooking and cleaning up after hoardes of people, who treated our house like a hotel (never offered to help clean, or cook).<br>  <br>  All of which isn't to say it's time to roll up  your doormat, BUT the best way to avoid feeling used is not to let yourself be used. Don't expect the freeloader to suddenly wake up and see that she's turning your house into a free motel and feel bad about it. She's doing this because you allow it.<br>  <br>  You either have to be more direct or less available. If you want to let her continue to visit, you're going to have to set limits. "Hi - wow, there's a ton of laundry to do, not just yours, but I've got a lot that needs doing. Would you rather clean the kitchen, or do the laundry?" Assume that of course she intends to help - surely she wouldn't just use your home like a motel?  <br>  <br>  Let her know that everybody's getting up at whatever time, so breakfast will be at, say, 7 a.m.  If she sleeps until noon, let her, but don't make a special effort to be quiet, or keep breakfast hot. Them what keeps their own hours makes their own arrangements. The rest of us went to the beach, sorry you missed it!<br>  <br>  You also have to let her know she can't assume an open door policy at your place. You and your family need some alone time, just you, much as you love the gang, so it's best to call because you might not be home/available/have space for everyone who wants to stay. When she calls, you tell her that no, you have other plans that weekend, or yes, you'd love to see her, why doesn't she bring a few litres of soda?<br>  <br>  It's not that you need someone to buy groceries, just that she's expected to contribute. People take more pride when they are contributing, so this is better for her.<br>  <br>  Of course, this means you take this approach with everyone, so it's fair. If you're old enough to have this lovely home, you're old enough to decide for yourself how you want things to go in that home, and say so politely, but firmly.<br>  <br>  Either that, or just make up your mind to put up with whatever treatment she feels like giving you. Even hotels have limits on what behavior they tolerate from guests.|`|Jj56ALSJaa	Hi <br>  I have had the same problem in the past. It is really tough especially when it is family. But if they love you then they will understand when you say I love having you come over. But I need to spend time with my family and go places too. We need to get out to visit people like everyone else. So if you wouldn't mind coming maybe  only once or twice a month...but maybe call first to see if we have plans already.Say I love our visits but it is time for us to get to do things too.And when you come maybe we can go to bed earlier so we can ALL get up sooner and have a nice breakfast. Then we can all do what our plans are for the day.Whether that is all of us together or apart. OK? I do hope you understand I would never hurt your feelings. But we just need a lil breathing room for now.. We do love you.
4d55d100833b8c7caaf04324a2ad701eaa	First of all if you kill yourself then how will you ever talk to your friend again, and do you really want to leave her in pain over missing you.  You don't really want to kill yourself you just want the pain to stop.  Pray!  Ask God in Jesus's name, to give you peace and heal you of the emotional wounds and scars you are suffering with.  He will do it.  I have prayed for you, God bless you.|`|1zPHCE9maa	It's really good that you're talking about it. Just think of how much pain you'll be putting onto others if you do that. I say you should become religous. You will start thinking more of the positives and how lucky you are to even have your life. Plus, it's one of the ten commandments that you can't kill yourself, or you'll go to hell.|`|AA11040867	I don't think there is a person in the world who cannot relate to you and what you are going through....most people have had a tragic circumstance happen around them that was beyond their control....the feeling of helplessness is what is overcoming you. <br>  The best thing to do is no try and ignore what you are going through, but write it down as though you are writing to your friend, telling her how bad you feel and why you think you are feeling that way.....you don't need to send it, you don't even need to show anyone what you really feel and why you feel like that.....just keep writing until it all starts making sense to you!<br>  Don't forget a good cry helps, then when you feel up to it, go for a long walk, listen to some music, eat an ice cream cone or better yet, buy one for someone who is not expecting it....you will be surprised how making someone feel good will help you feel good too!  It works wonders to see someone smile because of something you did.<br>  Don't forget the big fella upstairs (God) likes to hear from us when we are in trouble as well.....ask Him to give you some peace with everything that is going on.....you are in my prayers.<br>  God Bless.|`|C5yapTAyaa	Killing yourself is stupid then you'll never see your friend again.Just tell your friend how you feel.The same thing happend to me i just told her and it diden't exactly go to plan but it made me feel better.<br>    Then i went travelling met loads of new women and you'll soon get over it|`|EoHYEJtdaa	You're already doing the right thing -- you're talking. Talking helps your subconscious resolve dilemmas and confusion. She'll be so happy that you called the ambulance, so I'm sure emailing her and stuff will help alot. Remember of course that you can always find a way to travel and see her, or at least set up a webcam.<br>  <br>  Just don't give up!|`|Jj56ALSJaa	I am feeling so proud of all  of the answers here!!! I know you are in great hands with all the help you got here!! just look at the people trying to help you through I gave them all votes!!! These are all great ideas!

And like they said  7 months is not  along time and  she would be sad if she came back and couldn't see you right??  So you take good care of yourself  and you will see things will look up in no time!!

Good luck.|`|M3PHrU74aa	hi 1st stop talking like that dnt u know that life is precious!! and this girl im sorry she met an accident listen there r other ways to kill the pain there is emial the phone txting how bout wrting to her a long letter and if she cant *** to u way not go to her see life is ment to be lived and who knos she might be the one so take the risk and live life i wishh u all the luck in the world to both of u take care<br>  <br>  hope|`|UI4kQiPhaa	well fisrt off, eveything seems better in the morning.  try sleeping.  play a song.  cuddle with teddy/dog/cat/rabbbit.  call/text ur friend.  talk to ur to ur friends.  make plans for what you'll do next time u see her.  make plans for the future.  smile.  have an icecream.  u deserve it.  talk to SOMEONE.  mom.  dad.  whoever.  u arent alone :)

She left me rather coldheartedly, but it would be shallow of me to treat her poorly. I'll be the better person and continue to act with compasison and kindness. It confuses her also, and she even got upset with me over it, but after a bit I think she realized that I won't play the dramatic hate-for-no-good-reason game. He might have motives of trying to win you back, but he may also just be the better person. Just be kind in return. Hating your ex for no reason other than the fact that you broke up is petty and useless.

y pueden haber reclamos! incluso!<br>  <br>  porque no hacer nada, primeramente pregúntate tu que tanto valoras tu relación con tu pareja, tienes hijos ? o que tanto valora la pareja de tu amante a su familia? estas tentando a faltar al único código de confianza que existe entre los amantes, la discreción, que pasara cuando le comentes a la esposa de tu amante como reaccionara? que tan segura te encuentras que no solo arremeterá contra el sino contra ti además, has un alto y piensa en esto:<br>  <br>  tu eres casada? si es así entonces cometes el delito de adulterio, sabes común puede reaccionar tu amante o la esposa de este?<br>  <br>  llamándole también a tu esposo y dando todos los pormenores como prueba para que tu vallas a la cárcel! o se desintegre tu matrimonio!<br>  <br>  claro! es como el adulterio se a comprobado!<br>  <br>  estas poniendo en charola de plata todo lo necesario para que seas acusada de adulterio!<br>  <br>  haaa no estas casada? y tu crees que eso es suficiente para que de todas maneras no exista un delito, haaa claro piensa en lo molesto que será si tu pareja comprueba el concubinato es muy fácil una carta notarial de concubinato y listo, y ponle que no termines en la cárcel pero para que quieres un problema legal en los juzgados?<br>  verdad?<br>  <br>  o sobre todo y que tal si mejor cambias de amante?<br>  claroooo!<br>  <br>  mira no quiero ser sarcástico pero precisamente la condición de amante es lo único que te garantiza! que si las cosas salen mal no hay reclamos sin consecuencia!<br>  <br>  asi que mejor no hagas nada y lo único a que te limites es a terminar la relación con tu amante y bueno ya será tu decisión si encuentras otro.<br>  <br>  Pero voy a ser muy crudo con lo que te comentare pero es por tu bien sale?<br>  <br>  mira lo de menos es que te enga?o, abre los ojos tu crees que era la única? ahora con quien se metió? cual era sus hábitos de higiene? que garantía tienes de que el no ha tenido relaciones con alguien contagiado de quien sabe que enfermedad?<br>  <br>  CORRELE YAAAA! a hacerte un examen de todo!, y espero salgas bien librada por tu bien!<br>  <br>  ahora crees que el se daría cuenta de que tenga alguna enfermedad? claro que no por eso suceden las situaciones tan desfavorables de salud!<br>  <br>  esto es lo que debe de preocuparte!<br>  <br>  ahora solo tu amante se metió con mujeres?<br>  <br>  estas segura?<br>  <br>  sabias que el bisexualismo es muy común y es la causa según los doctores de el porque tantos problemas con enfermedades?<br>  <br>  no das mucha información por eso peco de pesimista pero cordialmente lo digo es por tu bien!<br>  <br>  antes de hacer algo investígalo! porque el problema es que hábitos tenían no solo el sino con quien se metió!<br>  <br>  espero que todo salga bien que te limites a tan solo ver por tu salud y corroborar que estas tu bien y bueno una amante que tiene a otros amantes ya para ti implica un riesgo de que contraigas algo y bueno por naturaleza un amante sea hombre o mujer de lo que mas carecen es de honestidad así que no le creas o duda si te dice el típico !es que ella era la única! porque es muy seguro no lo sea, así que ya falto a tu salud y al arriesgarte el te arriesgo a ti!<br>  <br>  suerte :)|`|Km5suD4zaa	jajajaja chiiiinnnnnn  pues ya ni modo, lo mejor seria que le des vuelta ala pagina y sigas adelante, no tienes nada que perder, igual y hasta te encuentras uno mejor o mas joven....<br>  SALUDOS|`|MUo0ObcZaa	recuerda que tu amante es tu amante  y que el amante siepre tendra otra  u otras amantes    es que es un amnte esso es lo que es<br>  <br>  pero olgo es  muy divertido  asle una llamada asu esposa  dile que la enga?a con otra   dfale direccion  y que los cachen|`|QPKG0kkFaa	Vaya mujer!!!<br>  <br>  Jajajaja!<br>  Eso si da gracia!.. dejalo y buscate otro.. y dile a su mujer que lo enga?a y que lo castre por.. %"·%%$%$&(?)!"/"·$!... ya sabes... y tu ten cuidado y buscate a un soltero... no seas... igual...<br>  <br>  <br>  Por eso estamos como estamos... con la sociedad contaminandose de SIDA... y ni?os abandonados por madres con problemas sexuales o por que les estorban en sus "trabajos"...|`|ZZ9fqpbVaa	si  y  rápido!!!!!!!!|`|fvwKNfnIaa	yo creo q tu amante ..le justa tener mas mujeres..como te sentiste yo creo q mal ..te lo merese por meterte .con hombres casados..llama asu esposa ydecileq vos era la amante de su marido ,,a ver si te da la cara ...porque las mujeres q se meten con hombres caSAdos ..no SE RESPETAN.................|`|7827232074146ae839f9f0faf39108e2aa	Pues nada, si era de dos, sabias que podria ser de tres no?<br>  Aguanta como la esposa contigo, ni modo.|`|eb30173b995814dbe6d352bd89d2a0dcaa	NAAAA......donde comen 2 comen 3..y asi...|`|68956f7a7773e3064e72396f6c2e38fdaa	Acúsalo inmediatamente!!! esto no se puede quedar así.

That or you have build up a romantic daydream of what you think it would be like to be in a relationship with him. Not very fair to him as he will never be able to meet that goal.  <br>  So stop worring about "loving" him and first try talking to him and getting to know him. <br>  Go out on picniks, to the zoo, to a baseball game. Go places where you enjoy, and see if he enjoyes it also.

Tienes que ser muy inteligente. <br>  Mira, el que complazca a la mamá,  en sí a veces es natural. Es su madre y siento que estás sintiendo unos celos terribles. Ella no es tu enemiga, debes hacerla tu amiga. De lo contrario tendrás siempre en contra a tu esposo.

Not because of the boy thing, but because of the girl thing.  My girlfriends and I always had an understanding that if a potential Mr. right was in the picture, it was an excuse to cancel our plans together.  I'm not saying that that is the right way to be, however ground rules for us.  You sound much younger than me.  It is the way people cancel plans, the way they treat you when you are hurt by something that really matters.  This girl sounds mean.  I wouldn't want her for my friend.|`|LG1ugoJ0aa	i'd say screw her and hold it till she makes up for it i had a friend like that and i got sick of her ditching me all the time for guys and other friends and i'v known her for 11 yrs let her know that u don't like it and that she has to make it up somehow like plan another camping trip or somethin|`|lJuEnaKSaa	In my experience you have to make a choice - either you accept that this is how she is or you walk away.  My best friend of almost 20 years has ditched me more times than I can count, and I've done the same to her.  She has made me hang out with guys that were so annoying/creepy I would rather shoot myself.  BUT she is my best friend and I love her regardless of the BS we but each other through.  If you don't like the guy she's with then you need to either deal or make sure that you don't expect her to be apart from him for too long.  That's just how some girls are.  And seriously, don't hold grudges - Its not worth the energy or time.
NE0RjQNkaa	Nothing, this is perfectly normal and it shows you have a sense of humility.  That's a GOOD thing.  He's your friend and you feel like he should not be serving you because you consider him your equal.  I hope you can put that to the side however if your friend enjoys it.  I used to serve, and having my friends in there was the highlight of any day.  It IS really fun.  Just think, he spends his day being disregarded by at least 30% of the people he serves.  It feels good to serve someone who you know appreciates you.  Just relax and let him do his job, and give him a great tip if you can afford it.  It'll make his day, any day!|`|AA12123970	Dont tip well huh....

ef244a13c77b687c912316346bad26adaa	the way you can tell if someone really loves is they would be willing to anything and they would show there love|`|0f690a02d3afbacde305c13308d0ac8caa	Well if someone reallly and truly and deeply love you then they will risk anything for you.|`|1c05a2dddf59de2a57757ae713a07ef5aa	There is no simple answer to this question because ppl show their love in different ways depending in the way they were rasied and the way they saw their families,friends and other show love. But in general and as far as i know, when he/she knows every lil detail about you, thats love, when he/she calls u in the middle of the night cuz he/she cant sleep then a lil while into the conversation he/she starts yawing thats love, when you are the first person he/she calls to tell u about what a good/bad day he/she had, then its love. When he/she knows when u r lieing just from the look in your eyes, then its love. When he/she drives by your house to take you out for a ride just cuz he/she feels bored and wants to spend time with someone, and that someone was you, then its love. When he/she calls your friends to know why the hell u r not picking up, then its love. When you feel his hands shacking up,just clamping to your hand just before he/she drops u off then its love. There are many other signs u can pick up along the way. If u Love that person then u will know.|`|72f61c2deac72fdbb7ba48659ea075beaa	This might not be the right answer but I think you know if that person takes time out to know you pays attention and does the most sweetiest things when u atleast expect it...They spend most of their time with you but yet still has there alone time...They always interested in you and what goes on in your life and they just respect you and always their when you need them..you the same way with them...Dont think ya'll have to be together 24-7..just enjoy each other and respect each other....hope that helps!!|`|e12914f2e881daad3e9007ea44fdd7a1aa	Because if they don't then they ARE AN IDIOT, and not to mention the one who's missing out, not you. You've truly got way too much to offer, and you are worth everything.|`|f9228585bd341b3c206a00054a65e7f8aa	Because they know the real you and they are still there. They listen to you instead of talking all the time. They don't down you. They aren't afraid to show some PDA around their friends (not crazy stuff, just a kiss, holding hands, telling you they love you). And they tell you everything they love about you. At least that's what I think.|`|32edf6bbc923ed62b18ed8d31e83a082aa	Everyone has their own way of knowing and showing it.  I tend to think the cute little mushy way.  Little gifts, having fun and generally having fun together like children even though you're both adult.  In other words, when people do things they wouldn't normally do due to their age like little pranks that wouldn't hurt anyone but in reality unconditional love always in the background.|`|2a2270179432db443b5ca34b31d680fbaa	Well you can always understand if someone truly has some feelings for you.You can see in the way he looks at you, he talks to you, he hugs, he kisses you and so on.Just focus on his bodies the key is on the body moves!!!Hope I helped!|`|781c8036b8d6e107513c72ec56ed496aaa	They'll die for you.  Literally!!|`|8527a78a7589f57cfc3a7e4e4457d185aa	Honey, you are a woman. You will know, trust me. What does your heart tell you?|`|ce6db5670c5f81e3852bacefbb9455e1aa	you can never be truly sure if someone else loves you but you can trust what they say or their actions....but it is never guarantee.....people lie....they can change their minds at anytime...so they only way to know is believe in yourself....and take their word for it......but don't be surprised if its not a fairy tale like you dreamed about|`|ebab62f967cc3a84b423efa6a7f3cc3daa	There is no simple way to answer this question. The thing is, different people have different opinions and beliefs about what "love" is, and philisophers have been trying to decode the meaning of "love" since the beginning of time. And the truth is, it is alot of things. Here are a few facts on what "love" really is: Love does not hurt. Physical and/or emotional abuse are NOT a part of love. Love is not manipulative, and should not be used to get others to do what you want. You should never give in to demands based on the "You would do it if you loved me!" tactic. Love is an intense form of caring. It can take many different forms (romantic, friendly, familial) but it is ALWAYS about caring. Love is when they put your happiness before theirs. When they don't want you to compromise your values or be untrue to yourself. When they don't ask you to do something that you don't want to do in order to "prove" your love for them. When you love someone you don't ask them to sacrifice a part of themselves in the name of that love. They allow you to be true to yourself and not go againsed your beliefs and values for their love. It is also very easy to confuse love for     . The true measure of love is committment and trust NOT physical attraction. Relationships based merely on physical attraction or looks are pretty shallow. And love is NOT, I repeat is not NOT SX . Love is not SX, and SX  is not love. It can be a part of love, but it is NEVER mandatory. Romantic love can (and often does) fade, too. When it goes there is not always a reason. When somebody falls out of love with you it does not reflect upon your value as a person or your desirability. Remember the old testimony in the bible : "Love is kind, love is patient, love is not jealous."<br>  <br>  Love is a special thing, and I hope you find the love that you're looking for - good luck!!!

I would show up at my parents' house, with him. You both need to sit down with your folks and let them know your plans. Speak to them maturely, adult to adult. Assure them that you will finish college. Perhaps plan on waiting a second year so you can both get your careers established and thus afford to support yourselves. Explain to them how you plan to support yourselves. Also, if you plan to go for your graduate degree after you're married, let them know that as well. It may reassure them to know that you're not giving up on your education and career. Tell them that their blessing is important to you but that you're confident the two of you can make it work. Good luck.|`|yTv8JqsWaa	Just call the parents up and set a dinner date.  In public, where you can announce together.  If they refuse to speak to you and miss out on this happy time for you, then that is their loss.  This is your life.  I am happy to hear that you are waiting until you do graduate college.  BE SURE TO KEEP THAT PROMISE TO YOURSELF.  Also, they may warm up to the idea after they have time to think about it and you have a year.  You should have a "life plan" together that you can share with them.  No reason you have to, just out of respect towards their feelings.  Let them know your plan of (if you will be in school or working or both, what your husband will be doing, and where  you will be living).  You all need to discuss this yourselves and have it ready and stick to it.  That way you can have a successful marriage.  20 is young, but it's your lives.   It can be done.

jxO3AsxCaa	surtout s'il y'a un bien immobilier...il s'occupe de tout ce qui est partage de biens. Mais faut pas oublier qu'en fin de compte, si vous ne vous êtes pas mis d'accord, c'est le juge qui donnera au notaire le droit d'exécuter le partage.|`|f0b7c941e5387d08ed64218aee8bfa4aaa	Il n'est utile que dans le cas où vous êtes d'accord. Le notaire ne tranche pas, il acte.<br>  <br>  S'il subsiste des zones de désaccord entre les futurs ex-époux, il faudra faire appel à un juge.|`|0DmZITLQaa	Oui le notaire est obligatoire, dans ce cas-là. Il sera nommé par le juge si c'est un divorce contentieux. Sinon la convention qu'il aura rédigé devra être jointe à la conclusion des avocats pour la demande en divorce.<br>  <br>  Et n'en déplaise à certains, un notaire, officier public et ministériel, détenteur du sceau de la République, ayant le pouvoir de conférer à ses actes la force exécutoire d'un jugement en dernier ressort, peut effectuer des actes qu'aucun autre juriste ne peut. <br>  <br>  Et pareillement, un notaire ne pourra jamais aller plaider devant le Tribunal de Grande Instance. C'est le domaine réservé des avocats. <br>  <br>  A chacun son métier...|`|fd4ed2cde326f9a109732fd90a0c5417aa	oui, surtout s'il y a un bien immobilier!|`|gJFqebxuaa	Non, sauf si vous êtes mariés avec un contrat de mariage.C'est préférable pour la répartition sans problémes .|`|xUVgykVIaa	absolument surtout avec des biens  immobiliers jusqu' au terme du partage des biens qui vient souvent après le divorce|`|dxR0qUsaaa	Si tu fais un acte de séparation de biens ou si tu en as déjà fais un, oui.

Ils pourront aussi collaborer ensemble si nécessaire. Disons plus il y a des biens à partager et mieux c'est de voir d'abord le notaire qui est le spécialiste en la matière. Voilà.|`|sUZaU5haaa	Le notaire n'est pas obligatoire tout ce que fait un notaire peut le faire un avocat et si vous avez l temps vous pouvez le faire tout seul.

Hang in there.|`|9f0edb78f5ee8ce133d815afe3584497aa	Rebuilding the base of trust in a person who has been the hurt like this is tough. Be there for him, and stand firm in WHY you are there. Don't waiver. Even if there may be a slight difference in what he wants, and what you have to offer. You need to show him stability, and singular dedication. We would all want that in a situation as you have described, go for it.|`|LHedrUi9aa	you cant do anything. Just show him you love him, just as you would show any other man... if he brings up that issue, then deal with it, if not, then youre in the clear|`|db4a7097c036b1c34576c792e8c76f1eaa	just let him greive and continue to be there for him. when the time is right...you can tell him.|`|f8b8ef4f491022b92da1c9e8dcbdeee4aa	Just be there for him. Actions speak, and time is what he needs. He sounds like he is still grieving, and wanting to hurt people is a natural urge when you are hurt. Most of the time, those people are the ones that are still close enough to hurt. You don't want to be that person either.<br>  <br>  It's a sticky situation, but he's definitely bitter if he's still grieving after two years. You just need to be supportive, but not over-eager or smothering. He has to choose to trust again, but there is a chance that it may never happen again.<br>  <br>  Also, be careful when you throw out words like "never" if he does trust you, you need to make sure that you're ready for a commitment. Not many people go into a marriage planning to divorce, but it still happens, a lot. You may just have to move on in lieu of waiting for him to heal.|`|f8d1a679d6b799b3ee6ae938dd25f2ecaa	been there done that~! My hubby and I have been together for 9 yrs going on 10. We had just gotten together about 6 months after his divorce from and 11 yr. marriage. It all depends on what kind person he is and how he deals with loss and grief. But also i can tell you he will most likely always no matter what happens have some kinda feelings for her and you have to be grown up enough to understand and respect that w/out letting that effect your relationship; IF it goes any further that you and he being friends. Besides that you and no other person on earthl just like his wife cannot guarentee your feelings are not going to change even after a long period of time. that is the human way.

You can lean on them when you are down and they actually don't want you to fail and if you do they are there for you.  If they give you advice that you choose not to follow, they aren't right there with an "I told you so".   Ones who are there at our lowest moments because they care about us when a loved one dies or we lose a job.  <br>  <br>  The best rule though is, To have a friend you need to be a friend.|`|AA10286675	I guess mostly  we r the ones who make good friends.u find someone who fits but u should take ur time through the way ,but avoid interfering in their lives,avoid telling ur most important secrets,not coz they'll reveal it but coz like this u force them to solve ur problems sometimes it's distressing for the other to live her/his life to satisfy ur needs.Also keep in mind that any thing from ur friend is a gift don't take their love for granted.wish u all the best

bNdMR66Paa	Yes those can contribute to that.  Tell him exactly what you just said here.  Tell him you are sorry and explain that your medical condition has alot to do with how you appear when talking sometimes.  Tell him its nothing he has done but sometimes the medication can also make you seem that way also.  Just be honest and let him know what is going on with you when you do get in a bad mood.  Tell him how you feel about it.  THings will work out if you will be honest and trust him.  Good Luck.|`|AA11798616	Try talking to your current therapist.  If this isn't there area of expertise the have them recommend someone who handles the depression and mood swings associated with being Bi-Polar.  Also speak with your physician.

The therapist should be able to recommend something that will help with behavior modification.  If your fiance is unwilling to work with the condition you already face in your relationship with him, then he is probably not ready for a long-term relationship with you anyway.  Stop worrying about him and concentrate on self-improvement so you can get on with your life.  Best wishes.|`|db41c158c6116c2c2332bf79ec3303fcaa	does your fiance' know about your mental condition??<br>  if so, then hopefully he will understand your moodiness and have patience with you when you treat him badly. <br>  <br>  BUT you should not be using your mental illness as an excuse to treat him badly. you should try your best to treat him like the prince he is, cause he's sticking by you.<br>  <br>  i have some of the same problems,and thankfully my husband hasn't left me. <br>  <br>  i'm not sure he'll leave you, but it might be on his mind, and he might be questioning himself as to why he is doing this to himself. <br>  <br>  so, i would start by changing how you treat him. start respecting him and doing nice things for him. <br>  <br>  also i would check these books out:<br>  "the proper care and feeding of husbands" and<br>  "the proper care and feeding of marriage" by<br>  Dr. Laura Schlessinger.<br>  <br>  they are good books, i've read them both and they've helped me  alot in my relationship. <br>  <br>  good luck and take care!

Therefore I like girls who are more in the size 8-12 range (my size range is based on shorter girls too) and may be a little chubby (especially if it is in the right areas like butt and b00bs).|`|7265919fd01cce2acb9424f26bda1f6eaa	I am a bi-sexual, and i prefer any girl :D

If he is and she shows up in the pictures you're going to have to re-evaluate the status of your relationship. <br>  You could always hire a p.i. but that could be expensive. Look at all of the circmstances and trust your instincts! They're usually right.|`|44bba4ed155b45dc504c9d4f02d9078aaa	He shouldn't be going out of town with his ex.  This is a huge red flag.

Good Luck!|`|5cf0470a204de934eb842ceee9cb69cfaa	First of all, ask him what is going on? And then you tell him that you are not comfortable with the idea, and see what he says.

The only reason men keep in touch with any females (friends, ex, high school friends etc...) is because they have some sort of romantic feelings for them deep down inside. Your bf still has feelings for his ex.

bd7d39e7fbff3ea14755bee2d2acd8daaa	Love is as real as a rock. It's far more than mere protection ... it's a need ... it is comfort ... it is giving ... it is taking ... it can be an overwhelming thing.<br>  <br>  It you feel a hole in your soul when not with the person ... it could be love.<br>  <br>  If you would give your life for the person ... it could be love.<br>  <br>  If your heart sings when you're with the person ... it could be love.<br>  <br>  Love is very difficult, if not impossible, to define. It is also one of the most complicated emotions known to mankind.<br>  <br>  Do not, however, equate it with passion. That's different, but it feels quite a bit the same early on. Passion fades from relationships, but real love doesn't ... or at least takes a very long time to do so.<br>  <br>  Love is totally real. I hope you find it!|`|767bb8157aecc7cdecc1971537e9ab6caa	it just is|`|7febe51383822571431c80673543909caa	Love is a very specific feeling you get about a person, like butterflies in your stomach, when you see that person.  Sometimes it can be as little as your chest feeling funny at the sight of a person.  But now to answer the question what is truely love, your gonna have to find that out for yourself,  i happen to know that if i think about the person alot and when i do it makes me smile then i know its love, but it is diff. for each person.|`|e8682ff16025b0333174691b84e2e83eaa	Love is funny it could make you fill like your on top of the world .<br>  <br>  Or it could make you fill like the lowest form of life in it.|`|AA10208608	I think the biblical verse says it the best:<br>  <br>  Love is always patient and kind; it is never jealous. Love is never boastful or conceited...It is never rude or selfish It does not take offense, and it is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people's sins but delights in truth. It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes.<br>  <br>  ~ 1 Corinthians 13:4-8<br>  <br>  you get impatient, then you remember that the person you love is a different individual and he needs to live. you learn to be patient and love him for who he is. <br>  you find flaws in his character yet love him anyway. <br>  you get jealous that he doesn't always spends his time with you, but you remember that being possessive chokes him and you have to set him free. <br>  <br>  the verse just hits it right on.|`|15113b2159f87a6b4d4be085ad468c0eaa	Yes.

You need to speak to both a family law and immigration attorney. I don't know what your custody situation is with you son's biological father, but if he pays child support and has a relationship with your son, you will not be able to take the child out of the country without going to court first. Also, customs and immigration may need a notarized letter from his father stating that it is ok to take the minor out of the country. As for long-term stay in Ireland. A passport will not suffice, you will need visas etc. Talk to an attorney and go to the state department's website. There may be more information there.|`|712407cda9314fe4090ddf8ba85d6b87aa	Usually if your married to a native citizen in Europe, you get citizenship in that country and so do your kids. My mother is American married to a Spaniard and she got legal citizenship there and we all went to school there. So yes you can. European Union also gives you more flexibility to be in any country in the Union. So cheer up and relax because marrying works in your favor. Look for a good school if you scared then look for the american school in that country. There is atleast one in every country in Europe, a bit more pricy but it allows your kid to keep in the American system or they are called international schools.<br>  Good luck.|`|f1e7f07d74d4c5c7ede8daca687b5d9aaa	ask your fiance

267f66118d98a55c76ca87b845474a73aa	I went through a very similar conflict with my bf. <br>  In our case he tried telling me several times how he felt about my friendship with another guy, but i always overreacted also because i could not see what the problem was because i did not love the other guy like i love my bf. Then finally my bf sat me down and looked me straight in the eyes and asked me just to listen, and he spilled everything, about how our friendship was hurting him. And it took me a while to grasp it but i did. I realized that it really hurt him that much that i had almost lost his trust. That was two yrs. ago that we had that conversation and i have changed and i am happier for it now. We have been together for 4yrs. this Oct. I am not saying that every relationship is the same but try talking to her one more time. If she loves you like she says, she will at least try to see your side. Good luck!|`|4eedf7c8bf516975c78538c0f1aadab9aa	you're not over reacting ...thats a hard call since he's been around longer...and the fact that it's in a nother state does not help...I think it's out of your control ...it's just up to you on weather you want to deal with it ...if you stick around you'll just have to bite your lip unless she confesses something , but if you cant handle it then leave...|`|AA12102457	You should tell her that its bothering you and give her examples, dont let your self come off as your jealous.

Trust in a relationship is the most important thing to have or you lose out on way to much so relax. Hang out with your friends and pass the summer then you both will have things to talk about other than fighting about about some thing that didn't exist to start with. If it is meant to be a life time thing you have your whole life ahead of you both. So enjoy your friendship and stop trying to destroy it.|`|050ea638a5bba6e7b09d727bc2965f3caa	your NOT over reacting. They got something going on. Leave her and find someone who will show a little respect.|`|AA10405098	Think about it and think about it hard. We all have jealousy in our blood. But then again if she knows it bothers you and she does nothing about making you feel comfortable about it then there may be a problem. Sit her down and tell her how you feel and take what she says, analyze it, then Deal with it or Not. I am a strong believer that love and lust can at times go hand in hand. In other words, they are more than likely still feeling something for each other. My advice is to: Address it NOW! And do not hesitate to express your thoughts so that they are understood and not focused on her friendship with the other guy. It must be about you and her, solely! Ultimately you'll have to kick her to the curb. Good luck!

AA11616958	omg! I'm in almost the exact same situation except my cousin went to camp last year where this guy liked her and then when she came back I asked him out for her. They went out for a while but then he cheated on her and broke up with her twice. He's a real jerk for a lot of things he says and does. He's never even met me and he likes me just cause he saw my picture and thought I was hot. And to top it off, this other girl he went out with always got mad  whenever she talked to him since they were still friends. He told her everytime he talked to my cousin and then his stupid gf would call and say hecka rude things to my cousin. It's a long story but my advice for you is to warn your cousin. If he was that rude to you, your cousin should'nt even consider getting with him. I know I never would because anyone who is rude to my cousin has absulutly no chance with me. If she doesn't heed your advice, then don't blame yourself. You warned her and that's all you can do. If she gets hurt, she has no one to blame but herself. Also, consider this, that your x is probably just trying to make your jelous and you can't let him get his way. Otherwise, just let the past be in the past. Please don't play games and turn this into a big soap opera scene like we did. It doesn't wrk. Hope my advice helped. Good luck!|`|561ffec0bde176953c948f8fd24ee650aa	Why did you go out with him if you knew what he was like?

I dated this guy who was nothing more than a liar. And even after he dumped me in the cruelest way possible... he had the nerve to ask out my cousin? All that shows is that he obviously doesn't care about anyone but himself. And if you're in this situation, my advice to you is tell him the truth, and nothing else, unless you want to turn the situation into a big drama scene. But there's really no reason to lead you're cousin into dating someone who hurt you because there's a better chance that he'll hurt her, too, and is that what you want for someone who you care about? Not likely.

Maybe as time goes by, he will get the courage to ask you out and begin dating, but until then, the ball is in his court, leave it at that.

662cef5c780e2d732b150d467c71815baa	It sounds like you have the best of intentions for this girl, and it is very difficult being "just friends" with a someone you care about deeply.  However, after telling her how you feel, the ball is now in her court, and it wouldn't do you any good to force the issue.  Continue to be there for her when she needs you as a friend.  You're still young.  Don't let other potential opportunities pass you by just so you can wait for this girl to change her mind.  Play the field a little bit.

AA10699062	lol I just answered another question and in my response was one of the most romantic things hubby ever did for me.  Let me see if I can paste it.  <br>  <br>  Once I got home from work after a particularly stressful day, to find the house dark, soft music playing, candles lit in the bathroom, the tub full of hot bubbly water, my current book sitting beside the tub on a stool, along with a glass of coke. He also took white and red rose petals and scattered them over the counters, and bathroom floor, and tub. He took the time to fix the setting for me - with many of my favorite things. He took my briefcase from me, undressed me, helped me into the tub, and once I was settled asked if I needed anything else. Then he said "the next hour is yours" and left the room.<br>  Stuff like that makes me feel special and appreciated, and loved beyond belief. It stirs my heart and soul -- all those things lead to great intimacy. <br>  <br>  Woohoo - the paste worked.|`|AA11600840	he cooked for me.|`|1b74f5654eaa54707c5afc3182cb836faa	Although the relationship is over now, amicably this is the most romantic thing for me<br>  <br>  <br>  One night I got a phone call from work, telling me that something had happened at the house, and I REALLY needed to come home, so naturally my boss let me go and I rushed off home. I came home to find the door locked, and I had forgot my key, and just as I was turning around to go back to work I hear his voice say "Hunny, up here" and I looked up, and there was that crazy man up on the roof! He let down a rope ladder, and helped me up, <I worked at the Duck club then and was wearing heels> and to my suprise on the roof of our apartment building was a candle light picnic, with everything made how I like it and red wine! Then he gave me red roses and told me "Your boss was in on it, that's why he told you tonight was formal, BTW you don't have to work until tomorrow night." and we spent the whole night together! and I just had to send my boss a thank you card, because that was so nice of them!|`|55f5e2b9952df1a9fa0eecd7b762a502aa	My wonderful husband Mark, bought me the most lovely and thoughtful gift ever. It wasn't expensive but the thought behind it was immense. <br>  In October of 1996 we had our first beautiful daughter and although short on cash and struggling we were really really happy. The only thing that upset me was that we didn't have a camera to capture all of these memories.<br>  On Xmas eve, two months later a very small box appeared wrapped up under our tree. As I told all of my friends and family everyone assumed that it was jewellery of some sort.<br>  I opened it the next morning and found a 35mm film ready to go with the camera my dad had bought us. <br>  It may sound soppy but that was the nicest thing he has ever done for me and I love him!!|`|579c551e33031795293c5e1c1b783afbaa	taking me to paris and proposing|`|fc7117280cedb9017461839769b2c21daa	well there are two things i'd say so far...one was while I was sleeping he made me breakfast and brought it to me and the other was i had been begging for weeks to hear him play the guitar and sing...he says he can do neither cause he really sucks at both but i didn't care i just wanted to hear it so he taps me gently to wake me up and there he is at the foot of the bed with his guitar singing walk the line....I about died...because i thought it was beautiful, one that he would overcome his fear, and that two he was singing to me|`|59249c26818237814136d5fed49fa0e0aa	hugged me!!! i would really like him 2 kiss me!!!!|`|88b3ff146fc18c6c5766d65039814797aa	on our first year anniversery i went to his house not knowing the what heck kind of gift he was gonna get me. when i got there he took me downstairs and sitting on the table was a little box and a huge bouquet of roses. it was so sweet!!!!!! and in the little box was a ring!it was so pretty i didn't know wut to say to him....the whole day after that was so romantic....|`|badde11f62afd0efd9c6e29fd162f93caa	Surprised me by booking a night in a hotel with a four poster bed, with flowers and champagne in the room.

b2686104ef2480397eb802150472c27aaa	When he haunts your thoughts, fantasies and dreams so many many years later. <br>  Sometimes you do "move on" and you get on with your life, other men, marriage family.. etc.. but there still is this pang in your heart that is him. <br>  Its hard when you are in love. <br>  I sort of know where you are coming from here. I am in love with a guy , we dated , we know that we cant be together and that we have gone our ways with husbands, wives and children.<br>  But there is always some sort of tension there. <br>  Letting go is hard. I still havent let go, I dont know that Im ever going to be able too... but I have accepted the fact that I love him but will not be with him. <br>  Its best to just love him but leave him be. If he wants to be with you then he will. <br>  Letting go is hard, and as I said I still havent .. but I have accepted.<br>  Move on with your life. He may realise that he is missing you and come back. <br>  Dont shut him out, keep lines of communication open...let him know that you are there for him and then let him make his own decisions.|`|b0849faca5949292a2ba9cfa62e38492aa	aww sweetie, i kno how u feel.  did he hurt ur feelings or something for u to say what u said?  I still love my ex and i too believe he has another gf.  he never told meand of course i never seen him with anyone else, i just kno my heart and his heart.  i will always love my ex because he gave me my first son and he treated me like a queen.  i don't think you holding on too long at all.  you can't change what's in your heart.  i honestly think that one day he just might come back to you.  some things are worth giving a second chance.  timing is essential.
k76WEz9Iaa	i agree with your friend's if he loves you he will come back. if he doesnt then get over him and find someone to spend the rest of your life with. but my advice is to change and show him that you will change for someone you love and he will respect you for at least attempting to change for him.|`|AA10734464	well, it almost sounds like he is trying to let you go easy. Why would he tell his ex how much he really likes the girl he just replaced her with? He seems like he is trying to not hurt your feelings and keep his answers to you pretty neutral. The changing part.....uhm....who says that you are the only one with changes to make? If you have to change and he doesn't....seems one sided and wrong to me.<br>  <br>  You didn't mention how long you guys have been apart or how long he has been with the other chick, that might make it a little easier to tell.  does he still actively try to involve you in his life? Or do you just call him all the time cuz you want him back?<br>  <br>  i had an old boyfriend hat I will always love in that special "you are now my ex but I did really love you once" kind of way. And I am married to someone other than him. So see how that went. I thought I wouldn't find someone else...no one would be as good...blah blah blah......it hurts to break up but what hurts worse is a relationship that someone is beating with a stick, one that isn't really a good relationship.<br>  <br>  Think of the bad times as stepping stones in your life...you have to get to one to reach the other. I dated some great guys and not so great guys and I married a SUPER great guy. If i had sat around depressed over the other guys, well, I wouldnt have the great marriage I have now. If I hadn't dated the wrong guys then I wouldn't have found this one.<br>  <br>  Now, could I have been happy with someone else? Certainly....but i am very happy  with the one I am with.<br>  <br>  So sweetie, just love yourself, do things to make you happy. If you need to change then do it because you feel it's a problem  for you, not because some guy says you have to.<br>  <br>  What happens if you don't change? Or don't change enuf to suit him? sounds like an awful lot of work on your part. I think if he really wanted your relationship to work then he wouldn't be with someone else right now. what made you accuse him of cheating? Something triggered it I'm guessing.<br>  <br>  When we love someone we always want to think that there is no one else for me, but there is, there are alot of choices|`|e2P8XRGyaa	What happens when you chase a puppy?

This will let him know you aren't going to waite forever for him. You don't have to get into a serious relationship, but start dateing and enjoying your life. If he is serious about the person he is with then he would be happy about the relationship. Maybe all he needs is to know that you wont waite forever.  You have to make yourself happy and be secure with yourself before you can change how you are with him. Good Luck to you.|`|9bb35f01c789bdf54875e81df0950eb8aa	do you want to marry him or to continue the same pattern of relationship you had? i think he wants to be really close to someone who cares and he 's on his way to find that other person. someone who is 'easier' to be with (no long distance/ no insecurities etc....). you don't want to move on but you'll have to one way or the other (commit or split).|`|7ca5d4333693a929c0d64ea49dd8353faa	You need to tell him leave her, i'm back!

You can e-mail me if you want to know more. Good luck, Carrie|`|6bfd6331fbc212b9ae381f6478c62c12aa	SOUNDS LIKE HE NEEDS TO  GROW UP.

Tell him that you are not that kind of girl and feel very uncomfortable with the situation. If he really likes you for you and not the sex he'll tell you he wants a relationship, if he don't want one then say good-bye and be with someone that wants you for you not the sex.<br>  I say dump the chump...|`|AA11925677	If you want to get hurt and feel bad, go for it.|`|fc922f2bd6a15b6df3de94f7b46b99a5aa	No going back now.

4a98c272d6efbe24bcd8c2f0671ff4ccaa	If you are attracting the wrong kind of guy, why are you baiting him towards you? If you have a heart of gold thats fine, but i know exactly what its like to be taken for granted and scewed over for kindness....and it reallly stings the most when you give without hesitation, to help or offer anything you may have to only to have that someone use it against you.  It really leaves a person bitter. and remember not all the world sees you the way you see yourself in the mirror.<br>  Beauty is skin deep.....But Ugly goes to the bone.<br>  If you want complete dedication from a man...find an ugly one.. you will see for once what true beauty is...for an ugly man to be with a pretty woman who only has eyes for him...He will treat her as a Goddess...not only that but it makes all the Ken Dolls go insane. Unlike the HollyWood style you seek, who only use you and then screw around on you with your so called betterlooking girlfriend, your ugly man will be far more use to you than the handsome jack....they even go to great lengths to make you satisfied in every way and at any time...lol and if you dont believe me , Just ask my wife.  Take care...you will know when you find the right one.|`|9373ed4de384e1d54446a82bddaf237daa	i know; i do the same thing.<br>  it guess its just bad luck.<br>  always falling for the bad boy;<br>  i know its hard not to.<br>  opposites attract, after all.<br>  but you just have to tell yourself<br>  'No.' It's going to be hard, but if<br>  you know what the guy is truely <br>  like, you have to stay away as<br>  to save yourself from trouble.<br>  one day, you will meet a nice,<br>  good guy-- just wait and see!<br>  <br>  goodluck with things! :]|`|AA11123408	Where are you meeting this guys?

Thank you, I have taken your advise as well.|`|AA11512648	I have heard and read this before. First of all I have no idea of where you socialize. If you go to bars and nightclubs this is the worst place in the world to find someone to develop a relationship. If you do go to these places go just to enjoy the evening and not to try to find someone to develop a relationship. Everyone I have talked to who met someone at a bar tells me of how things never worked out. Those people most of the time have little character, no morals, no ethics and most of all they just do not care for anyone but themselves.  They are totally self centered.  First of all it sounds like you are a very genuine person who deserves more from life than what you are receiving.  First you need to develop higher standards for yourself. You don't want to go out with a guy just because of his outward appearance. Most of the times men and women both who are very attractive normally have hard times in long term relationships because they think that no matter what happens there is always someone to fill that spot.  Find someone who has high moral standards, someone who cares about his fellow man, someone who is kind, someone who is giving and most of all someone who will be by your side until your last dieing breath. I know someone like this is extremely hard to find, but they are out there. What I would suggest is that you pray and I promise you "God" will put the right person in your life, and you will be so happy when he does.  You must trust and believe in God and he will take care of finding you a lifetime mate.|`|fdea8542f36681e54a629fffc2df2959aa	Learn how to say no. If you are that attractive you can afford to be choosy.

Try sleeping pills. But just for one night. But take them really early like 7. So you go to sleep early and wake up early. Its because your sleeping schedule is all messed up. But that should put it back to normal. I took Tylenol PM. It helped me.  Good luck!!|`|b1ee8b7e9f82c6bb9881e1400b5a7252aa	take vitamins and excersise.

AA11066768	the thing is you have kids together so you will always be connected whether you want to be or not. thats the reality now my advice would be to get out there and date that can show you there are other guys out there, have some fun and forget about your ex. so what if he's dating? you should be too! Just be civil and set a good example for your kids.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	it is hard to forget about someone we loved and trusted. you say he showed u no respect, that he is seeing someone else,u need to get a support system, trusted friends, family, maybe your minister. he lies to everyone so he won't have to look like the bad guy, so others won't see the true person. when it happened to me, it hurt beyond words, but i just quit talking to him, and i did move away after the divorce. it still haunts me at times, they claim that one must give it half the amount of time you were with that person for healing to take place. u can't forget because u still must have expectations of him, but he will never be sorry, or admit wrong. he wants to make it appear that you caused this, that he did nothing, happened to me like this also. u can't forget because there has been no closure, but sometimes there's not going to be any, sometimes for our own sanity we just have to distance ourselves, and these things with other women do not just happen as my ex tried to convince me. it has been going on awhile, alot of plotting and planning, and finaliazing plans. alot of deception and he waited to leave until he was for sure about her feeling's. this was not caused by u, it has to do with a man who has no character, or impulse control. a man who truly has no self insight, and who has no sense of right and wrong. just don't talk to him anymore, file for divorce, let her have him and all the problems too, we really have no control over anyone if they don't want to be with us. some men want to be forever adolescents, and have no responsibility in life.|`|0370fd46af40ff0a67a8182e1d0051a2aa	There are two ways to solve any problem: confront the situation or surrender to it.

I would suggest you discuss this with him, and be ready to give up if his answers convince you the situation is hopeless.|`|AA11537569	Wow, that sounded like me a few months ago.  Were we married to the same man?  But seriously, you will get over this.  It will take time.  You see, a part of you still loves him and that's why its so difficult.  If you didn't love him just a little bit, it would not matter what the loser does or say.  I'm just now getting to that point where it doesn't matter what he says good or bad.  I'm like so what as long as it doesn't hurt the kids.  Just give it time.  That thing that he is seeing someone could be true or not.  For some reason men like to lie about that.  Believe me girl, you will be able to move on.

I cry and cry when it hurts and write how i feel and yell when i want to.  i just do what i feel to do when i feel like doing it and i force myself out of the house.  do whatever makes you feel better, just make sure that you take care of your children and dont hurt yourself.  you will move on.|`|5c2469822fc61f1e9929f82e02df0232aa	Being in that situation only from a much longer marriage when he decided to try and have his cake & ice cream too, this is what time has shown me.  You forgot who you were and what you wanted in life while being his wife & care taker.  So, it's time for you to go for the things you passed up over that time that will make you happier and keep you busy with less stress on forcusing on wanting him back in your life.  He's going to try and come back at some point once he figures out his mistake of letting you go.  So, that will be in your favor to have the choice of taking him back (which you shouldn't by any means), or being able to tell him NO because of the pain he's caused you.|`|d477a32d22080db38e253d627f0237fbaa	The line that stood out to me above all is: <br>  <br>  "IS IT SO BAD THAT I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE KIDS SO I CAN MOVE...."<br>  <br>  How can you say that!!  I understand you may be frustrated but all you need to do is get over it and move on.  Be nice to him and be happy with yourself, you will be setting a good example for your kids and who gives a damn what he thinks and what he does.|`|e40be73ba926e18c4f3627438add6757aa	I am essentially going thru the same damn thing right now, however we still live together because our newborn has some medical issues, and frankly, i cant go back to work until I get her over the hump right now, she will be having surgery next Wed. <br>  He too tries to find something that we have to discuss only to berate me and call me names.I think it is because he knows he is SO wrong, he is trying to put the blame for our arguments on me.I have gotten to the point where I just agree with him, and it pisses him off more.<br>  F**K him! You will get to the point where you just don't care.And whatever he tries to argue, or make things your fault, just tell him..Whatever gets you through the day, keep believing"

First you have to be confident about yourself. Next you just step up to the plate and talk to the guy and be friends and see what he is all about? Then you may ask him out something simple like lets do lunch or something then you may tell him how you feel about him and see what he feels about you? who knows maybe you will hit it off and take it to the next step, you never know until you try, right? so go for it give it a try....|`|AA11918331	You are proably not ugly.

On the other hand if in doubt there is a reason for him going.  He might be looking to fantasize|`|a04d8ba01741e52edd70eed372868226aa	First, are you in a relationship with someone going to a strip club? If so, it sounds like you are questioning whether there is trouble. If that's true, then going to a strip club isn't going to help.<br>  <br>  Now, assuming that that is not true, I'd recommend you go with friends who are boys, not with boyfriends. There will be less emotional pitfalls, and you will get a better idea of what happens, and how men respond.<br>  <br>  And you will probably be the only girl (or group of girls) in the place. I know someone else said lots of girls go to strip clubs now, but I haven't seen it. Couples are a rarity, and "Unescorted women" are often not allowed.

ebab62f967cc3a84b423efa6a7f3cc3daa	Your boyfriend knows your phone number. <br>  <br>  And forgetting to call him hasn't alarmed him or caused him concern that something may has happened to you. <br>  <br>  It is not your job to be the "official caller." My guess is you call because he doesn't call you. What does that say about his level of care for you? You deserve better than this guy. I know it is going to hurt, but you need to accept he just doesn't feel the same. You can't make him care more either. <br>  <br>  Stop trying to contact him. Leave him totally alone.

f47dca6eadfc8031c2098a94afd47d0faa	Take it slow. Even slower! The problems that were there before, are obviously not going anywhere, so the question is are you and him more willing to work through things then walk out on them. By the way, if he still does not forgive you then move one, honey, because this will be something that is held over your held for life. You will be better off in the long run. Next time a hottie catches your eye find out about his or her baggage, you and only you know what you can and are willing to deal with.

He's right, you should have talked to him first.  The basis for any good relationship is trust and the only way to have that trust is to talk things out.  I hope you have one hell of an excuse cause you're going to need it.  Why would he want to move back in with you after you did that to him the first time?<br>  <br>  It looks to me like the only way you're going to get the RIGHT help is to help yourself.  You have a lot to prove to him so If I were you, I'd get my lips ready, you're going to be doing a lot of butt kissing if you want him back and to move in together.|`|OHs6ntPSaa	do what u feel<br>   <br>  =========================<br>  Meet new singles, if you are lonely:<br>  <a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A86.OSill41F9DAAlUval8kF/SIG=122phhrhg/EXP=1166993701/**http://webc453t21.blogspot.com/">http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A86.OSill41F9D...</a>
d916db9e9b5092ec2e51a61d825bdcecaa	Okay, so first, be really nice to her.  If she drops something, pick it up for her, if you get up to get an assignment, book, etc., get one for her, too, if you stack chairs, grab hers and stack it!!!   never say something to tease her, that could be offensive, like"u r fat,...........JK" or something like that.  walk her to class, talk to her, get to know her better, this is when you find the true person underneath it all, and decide that you dont really like her, you just wanna be friends, or you stil love her.  Then, just go from there, because you should know by then what to do!! Then if you decide that you love her, dont treat her like an object!!!!!!!!!  and never say that she's hot.  THAT IS A REALLY BIG NO-NO!!!<br>  tell her she's BEAUTIFUL(after you ask her out on a date  oh, and dont go to a movie!!! you dont learn anything about her!!! you just sit there with a stranger!!!! go rollerskating, or something fun like that  double dates are fun too!!

No girl liks a guy who pretends to be someone or something he really isn't. Pay attention to what she says and listen to her. Conversation is the key to any relationship.

Just remember to be yourself!|`|03dfa7e84e779aaad83459db6050e4e0aa	well try and talk to her, and actually listen to her answers, and when she asks u questions dont use one word answers, silences are not good. just be yourself, if shes worth your time she will like you, ohh and try not to do anythin imature with your friends around her thats a major turn off.|`|99b9295eb79f1f076849610e50a3e59daa	Just talk to her.

u0tWZMJlaa	Solo dicelo, cuando una mujer es amiga de un hombre, este no puede aspirar a mas que eso, pero cuando un hombre es amigo de una mujer, es mas fácil que el le de el si :D, creo, apoyenme chicas...|`|i4sfvx5Aaa	jaja, hacer que se de cuenta de que le gustas??? <br>  Si le gustas le gustas y punto, si el cree que solo son amigos es porque sólo eso quiere y más bien tú debes darte cuenta de que no le gustas, que prefiere ser tu amigo|`|6wXI1P0haa	ok dile que tienes algo que contarle pero que primero cierre los ojos porque ademas tienes una sorpresa para el...una ves con los ojos cerrados le das un beso y cuando los abra le confiesas que te gusta y mucho te aseguro no dira que no, pero si es solo por internet puews chateando dicelo es todo...suerte me avisas si te fue bien...suerte.|`|AA10492394	agarrale la mano y miralo a los ojos mientras le dices lo mucho que te gusta su compa?ia|`|b3sNmZ9Paa	pues dicelo asi alomejor en ese momento te dice que a el le pasa lo mismo ysi si es asi que suertuda y si no no pierdas los animos y ya encontraras a uno que si te quiera y no le ruegues por que asi va ser peor y ya no te va hacer caso, dicelo expresate ante el lo que sientes por el vale, SUERTE...?|`|bea7d0edb53748244a9c8e9dc0e3afd2aa	dile q te gusta|`|45ec11d800235c294a1f14031d5e1fbcaa	solo sientalo frente a ti y diceselo asi de frente y espera a ver su respuesta suerte mi enamorada amiga!!!!|`|5ApPcIhuaa	Primero como puedes decir que tienes enamorado, cuando el dice que son solo  amigos...me imagino que salen se ven siempre pero se han besado...si no lo has hecho estas perdiendo el tiempo. Bueno si tanto te gusta entonces no lo presiones solo portate como el como amiga y espera un poco su reacción y si no sucede nada entonces hasle saber que un día no saldrás con el sino con otro amigo.A los hombres no nos gustan que no presionen, pero si nos interesa la competencia y saber que la chica que elejimos esta muy interesante y  que puede tener muchos pretendientes, pero decir que es un ganador por que es el único que tiene a la chica...no se si me hago entender también queremos sentir orgullo por la chica que tenemos y por eso reaccionamos ante la competencia... Revisas tu estrategias porque las mujeres si se lo proponen pueden tener a un hombre a sus pies cuando este demuestra un poco de interés en la chica. Suerte|`|qqpqg29Baa	no hay como decirle que te gusta,,,ya no pierdas mas tiempo,,un a?o estando enamorada y no haberselo dicho es tiempo perdido,,,que tal que a el tambien le gustas y no se anima porque cree que solo es un amigo para ti,,,,el que no arriesga no gana, intentalo ,si no te va bien no perderas nada al contrario ganaras mucho porque asi te desilusionaras de el ,y si ganas pues esta por demas decir que seria de pelos no.....vamos arriesgate y suerte.
AA10894438	wow your parents would let you go to japan? but anyways lol i think you should tell him that your just best friends not a couple he's treating like you are his gurl ...your not but he just trusts you and enjoys being with out all the time..some people would kill for a guy like that but you should split the summer in half half in japan and then go back and then spend half wit your friends = )|`|fda602dea1ba43a0cbbeb9f869aed71faa	I know this might sound kind of selfish but you live here and see your friends mostly everyday and it's not everyday a friend asks you to accompany them to Japan.

82d10b303e74dbe6accab663bbcd07b2aa	Why not just be friends and hang out... see what develops. There is no need to push things to developing into something more complicated. This can and MIGHT happen on its own given time. <br>  No need in making each of you a nervous wreck around each other worrying about the others expectations. Just talk it through, determine that you should be friends above all else and whatever happens or develops.... well then worry about that when it happens.<br>  <br>  Enjoy each other! :)|`|57ed1cef8b60a3a531830c2bbbd239e4aa	just be as relaxed as possible about it.  if you can both just sit down and maybe have somewhat of a conversation about it than that could be a good start to the whole matter if you two haven't already done that much.  my best advise is to do whatever makes you both feel comfortable and let things happen.  if it leads to other things, (a relationship other than friendship or whatever else that it might lead to) than let it be.  i hope the best for you and your friend.  good luck with whatever goes on.

NGR4SnIMaa	No es un mito,ha ocurrido en algunas pocas oportunidades,y lo han pasado por los noticieros de televisión,(sin dar nombres) de tal o cual hospital en el que ha llegado una mujer con ese problema,y la explicación fue que es como si el envase se cerrara al vacío,por lo que resulta imposible sacarla,han tenido que romper la base de la botella para que entre aire y así poder deslizarla.Los que difunden esa historia deberían dar una explicación completa,ya que la solución no es la que han dado los noticieros, el caso es que en el forcejeo puede ocurrir que la botella actúe como zopapa y traiga problemas á la vagina y útero de la mujer.No hay que tomar estas cosas tan a la chacota.|`|0e15945497b3758f6aaff2df97f70f57aa	Que raro objeto para masturbarse... Me parece que es peligroso que una mujer (o un hombre) use ese tipo de objetos para hacerlo (como si no existieran los sextoys), se pueden hacer da?o si se rompe... <br>  Es conocido que ese tipo de casos llega de emergencia a los hospitales : personas con objetos atascados en algun orificio de la parte inferior del cuerpo (incluso objetos cerrados). Cuando una la persona tiene miedo, los musculos se contractan y el objeto puede atascarse. Solamente cuando la persona se relaja, puede retirar el objeto. <br>  <br>  Sin embargo no se con que proposito te lo habran contado... Pero si te puedo decir que ese es el tipo de cosas que cuentan los adolescentes y no los adultos. Es normal, puesto que a los adolescentes les llama la atencion todo lo que no conocen y suena sensasionalista... sobre todo si se refiere al sexo.|`|463a698e62636817bd13a124cfac1cdeaa	es verdad porque hace sopapa|`|SSlRnE6Laa	Mito de todos modos la masturbacion no es mala|`|0HyeJzo8aa	Por supuesto que no es un mito, lo que me parece increible es que digan las cosas de una manera tan trasgiversada que lo ùnico que consiguen es confundir y mal informar a la gente. yo vi un caso exactamente igual pero en un canal de television llamado discovery health lo que ocurre es lo siguiente: cundo esta chica introdujo la botella en su vajina lo hizo por la parte mas delgada que por cierto (esta abierta) lo que quiere decir que tenìa  AIRE al entrar en un espacio cerrado ejerce una presiòn que hace casi imposible que pueda salir el objeto introducido en este caso la botella, lo que tubieron que hacer es cortar el fondo de la misma para liberar el aire y  pudiera salir sin problemas, sòlo que imaginate la verguenza de la chica!.... <br>  -- <br>  ____\\\ | ///<br>  ____( 0 0 )<br>  ooO__(_)__Ooo____<br>  ___|___|___|___|___|<br>  _|___|___|___|___|___|<br>  -'-.-IvOnNe IrAiS.-'-.-|`|2a05ab95814eb28ef37922630177eb5aaa	seguro es un cuento...|`|5j76Lirkaa	yo pienso qeu es un  mito, ademas de que es algo muy sucio , nolo digo por la masturbacion , si no por el envase|`|9xRganhjaa	HAY CIELITO LAS EMERGENCIA DE LOS HOPITALES ESTAN SIEMPRE LUCHA QUE LUCHA CON ESTAS COCSTAS SI ES CIERTO LA BOTELLA  AL INTRODUCRILA SIN SU TAPA CORRESPONDIENTE CREA UN VACIO AIRE DENTRO Y!!!!!!!!!!!SE QUEDA COMO PEGADA AH!!!!

I used to only like tall, blonde, preppy guys. And then I ended up falling for this ghetto, brown haired guy. I would have never thought that could happen but it did.<br>  <br>  Don't lose all hope or anything. Get a whole lot of self confidence, and start talking to him. If you really want something to happen, you may have to put a little effort in to get to know him a bit, and show him that you care. But, dont throw yourself at him or anything. Trying to avoid wearing your heart on your sleeve. Confidence is key. Good luck!|`|AA12094082	Well you can help yourself by 1. changing your eating habits so you can lose weight, having your hair colored, and getting colored contacts. OR you can 2. ACCEPT YOURSELF.

8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	She has been honest with you: her parents don't let her date or have boyfriends.  She doesn't want a relationship right now because she is busy. She wants to be friends but lacks the time. If that's not good enough for you, move on.|`|fhGhZ7cIaa	It is possible that she really does have a lot to juggle in her life.<br>  It takes a lot of effort to kick a drug habbit and perhaps her real reasoning for taking it slow is because she wants to clean up her act before she makes a committment to a relationship. Lots of people don't get into relationships because they have school and other things going on. She seems to be a good girl by focusing her priorities on positive things. If you really do love her, be patient and be friends. If you feel you can't wait, move on.<br>  <br>  Stick by her, be patient. In the end, you'll be rewarded well.|`|2f06a5d77b1665b399e93fb69df1ef80aa	I think that she is busy... If you reall care for her then you will support and believe her situation... Just b there for her and she'll realize how much you care|`|384509079b461e09cb5a404a23a5946faa	At the moment, it sounds as if she's only interested in you as a friend. If I was really interested in a relationship, you make time for that person.  The girl sounds wonderful but the thing you have to ask yourself is, can you be just her friend?  Sure, you could wait it out and see if things change but unless she makes a move, you'll be nothing more than friends.  If you decide to stay "just friends" how would you react if she started dating someone else?  Would you allow it to ruin your friendship?|`|b996a7ac3a41c431da612916ee8a240eaa	Honest answer...Just wait a while, and that does not mean you can't see other people in the mean time - cause you just friends right!|`|f4Tksyd8aa	At least she has the honesty to tell you that she is too busy, and so give it some time. If her parents won't allow her to date, there's another reason to move on with your life by making new friends, and keeping busy.|`|OQxeHcVXaa	I think her parents have something to do with that, they are keeping her so busy were she will not have time for bfs, which in the long run can be a bad mistake on the parents part, like teeange pregancy. She does not want to tell you this or how she really feels b/c she feels you may not understand. I suggest to you that you continue to be friends w/her b/c she is going to need you when she finally has had enough of her parets controling ways, and all the extra activies that is making her so busy, she is going to want to get out and be a teenager that she is and if i'm reading her right from what you have said you will be the first person she calls on to go out with. So keep on being her freind you see it will work out.|`|nrgZYQBJaa	Hmm... well, if she can't date, then the best she can do is remain your friend... And if she says she wants to be your friend, she probably means it. Give it time, and maybe she'll decide that you're the one...

Date NO ONE for at least six months.Try different things, go back to school ...or whatever. Clear your mind,gain some confedence,stand tall, be happy. As soon as you mentioned that there was jealously in your relationship, I knew it had to end. Jealously NEVER gets better. Relax, learn and WAIT, start a new relationship when you are ready (not before 6 months) and base it on something else other than    , lies, and jealously. Neither of these things will result in a good or lasting relationship.Please take my advice, I only wish I'd taken it when someone gave it to me...Good Luck|`|C5nJkgT3aa	Ok,so I'm definitely not an expert in the relationship department since I'm always the one getting hurt somehow, but I wouldn't risk giving her your heart again to break. There was a reason that things didnt work out, and if she was seeing you before her marriage was even over, who's to say that she's not going to do the same to you.... When I first met my ex of almost 1 year, he had a girlfriend and broke up with her for me. I felt like I also had the upper hand. But then, before a year was up he went and did the same to me by finding someone else and dumping me for her. It was hard and for a while I was so in love I was WILLING to be a booty call just to be with him becuase I knew how good it Could be, but it just hurt me more in the end. If she really cared about you, more than her hubby, then she wouldn't have dumped you because you told him. It's not a fair situation for you to have to be in. It seems like your her "safe place" or "home plate" cause she knows you still love her and you'll be/ do whatever she wants. Don't rush things. You can try to be friends, but I doubt it will work|`|er4lGVOlaa	i think u should be a little careful n move wid a lill caution coz she might be comin to u fer emotional support n sympathy as she is goin thru a tough time n is left all alone now..n she knows u love her and no matter who wants her or not, u do.so she probably wants ur shoulder only fer now.another possiblity is that she might seriously be plannin to come back to u as she is almost done wid her hubby..no matter if she is playing u or not the only way to find out is to give it some time n not rush wid things u might wanna not give alotta attention now to her n see here reaction to it coz if she really loves u then she will be persistent in her effort and will always try tp come back to u otherwise she wont push it too much and find sum1 else...hope that helps..
S1EzANDDaa	Do you go to school?? Start up conversations with people sitting next to you (like did you do the homework, did you understand question number 5 etc...even if you don't need help at all).  Go to events at school.  When I was in college there was always something going on, different social groups meeting on different days.  Is your appearance approachable?  I used to always look "mean", not realizing that people saw my expression, thought I was having a bad day and didn't want to bother me.  I'm not saying be cheesy all the time, but smile and say hi.  Even at work I'll see random people in the hall and always say hi or just smile at them.  Do you have siblings close in age?  My older brother is 5 years older than me, but now that we're both in our 20s, we have mutual friends and I consider his friends mine and vice versa.  Cousins too.  What about your parent's friends, do they have kids that maybe you share common interests with.  Don't be scared to ask people if you can hang out with them sometimes....most people are open to sharing their activities with others.|`|19539470390c366766fb8e95dadc0aa2aa	it hard to find good friend now day and i am not going to lie to you.<br>  I suggest you can go to the movie by yourself if you want to. <br>  or if you are in school the best place you can start going to is seeing a councelor and she or he will tell you places you can go or pit you in an social club anywhere in you community or whatever community to want.<br>  councelor are there to help students who need help with anything really like housing, want to make friends or just student who want to just talk to someone they are there for that amd you should take advantage of that to make great friends.|`|e97fc691dc0b4ada5aca0e58e5ddb5eeaa	i'll be your friend.

He makes all of his girls feel like their the only one, but it hurts them when the actually sees him with someone else. My advice is to stay 'friends' BUT THATS IT! If you start to grow feelings then stop talking to him unless you want to get hurt. I'm telling you I see this happen everyday by my friend Tony, girls coming to me crying, "I thought he liked me what went wrong?" I'm like nothing went wrong thats just how he operates.

031ee34b5e525ff02d66b1f725852d12aa	Okay, let's have at a look at this one for you.  On the one hand she told you "just friends" but on the other hand she has not dismissed you out of hand.  <br>  <br>  Now since you refer to "school camp" in your question you must be quite young, and therefore so must she be.  Therefore she may have told you "just friends" because she was not - at the time - ready for ANYONE as boyfriend.  That she hasn't refused to talk to you since suggests that, indeed, you might well haver a chance when she is ready to entertain thoughts of having ANY boyfriend.  <br>  <br>  BUT, and pay heed, because this is important, you WILL have lost any initial appeal you once had because this other boy you mention is in there talking to her, no doubt making her feel like a million dollars with the attention and is therefore almost certainly closer in line for a relationship that you are.  Now, that's not all bad, because she is still talking to you (albeit by mobile telephone) BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO OVERCOME THE SHYNESS AND DISPLACE THIS UPSTART or you WILL loose out. <br>  <br>  She might very well be waiting for you to prove yourself, but she won't wait forever.|`|7IsKT0HNaa	no talk = no chance.<br>  <br>  get some balls and have a crack at it. it might just be worth your while...|`|QqjpO0rqaa	Yes, you have.  Don't be too shy to express what you really feel for her. You should be brave, boy!  If it's not your time now, one day the girl will realize it's hard to find someone like you.|`|rhUWXOnSaa	yea man talk to her<br>  <br>  if u dont talk she'll never know<br>  <br>  my situation is even worse lol..o well good luck my friend.

Jj56ALSJaa	Your friend sounds to me like he is falling for you in a big way and doesnt know how to tell you or show you except through the phone. He maybe was drinking that night however and so it was easier for him to come right out and say it. And maybe the crying is because you being his friend isnt enough anymore but he is worried that your good friendship will break up and get all weird if you try to date.He didnt want to talk because he was embarrassed by the way he confronted you.Make him own up to it. And ask him if his feelings are growing for you. Are your feelings growing? Think about that too.He sounds to me reading it again like he is really  wanting waaaay more then just to be friends with you. Talk to him and decide together if it will be ok to  go out as a date. I think it sounds romantic that he called you to tell you sorry. Be still my heart!! And the crying ...mmmmmm.. my hunny did that to me and we been married 32 years now!:) Check it out! Sounds like Love to me!|`|JDXlIRwdaa	this is what i think, he might like you more then a friend and maybe hes confused thinking you might not feel the same and ruin the friendship. or there is a possibility that something bad had happen to him that he isnt telling you?|`|117X1VSGaa	well may be he want to be more than friends. and remember some times guys just say that just to win your heart so they dont always mean it. and since he lives 4 hours away just remember that long distance relationships doesnt last long. so i think you should just be friends because ur friend can feel that way about you as a friend  but when u get into the relationship it is just going to change. and if u do get in to a relationship ur gonna be worried if he cheats on you and you will be worried about what he is doing and since u guys live 4 hours from each other u guys will never know whats happening between each other. and may be he didnt feel like talkin to you cause he just realized he is asking a lot|`|856d451bae39e49aa37981bff63adbd5aa	mabey you should tell him that you love him and that you hate to see him sad like this and you want him to be happy. tell him that he has nothing to be sorry for and that he is not a punk and that you will love him no matter what. i hop it all works out for the best. and i hope your friend feels better.|`|N3VY8WWsaa	he's just coming off from his 3 day bender?

It's such a rarity for a guy to be truly kind that, when one actually is, women don't trust him.

It is a shame that if we...men or women... don't get the response we are looking for from the opposite sex, we assume WE are missing something. I am not sure how old you are or anything, but it sounds like you have the qualities that most women... if they are honest... would LOVE in a guy. Humor and sensitivity. OK a nice bod and looks get you in the door, but the visit won't be as long if you have nothing else to offer. I don't know what you are like in social settings, but just be yourself but whatever you do, don't come accross to needy or clingy. Most women hate the guys that cling onto their every move. I don't know girls, am I close???

Jj56ALSJaa	Hmmmmmm!!! It depends on what the secret is? If it is something that could hurt her or get her/him into trouble then you need to tell them!!!! If they are your BFF it is mean not to tell them something just so you don't get hurt. Like if you cheated with your BFFs BF or GF! Then fess up!! If you are true friends and you made an honest mistake it may be forgiven but ....If you are still making the same mistake then you still need to fess up but I wouldn't expect that friend to be so forgiving. At least not for a long time. So tell us? What is the secret? I hope it is something else? Good Luck!|`|0d452a5489ed0d5a46b906b2ecd984f6aa	nope. BFF should tell each other everything. Tell her before time that what u may say might hurt ur relationship.|`|AA12374994	It depends on what that secret is. Put yourself in the others shoes and then ask if you'd want your bff to tell you.

It means they get sex without  being committed to one person. And they don't feel they have to buy anything for you or they don't owe you anything....like commitment. If you have a friend who says you are a friend with benefits time to  KICK them to the CURB!!.

AA11119598	I am very sorry that you are having to go through this. When the person you are with cheats on you it can be devastating. The most important thing is to stay strong and realize that non of his actions are your fault. Cheaters have this nice way of trying to spin their mistakes back onto the person that hurt. Do not fall into that trap. Stay strong not only for you but for the children you have, it is not easy but focus your attention on them and shower them with love. It will get better eventually and it is a slow process but you have to do what is best for you and your children. Remember he did not only cheat on you, he cheated your children as well. He was more concerned about himself than he was his family and you and your children deserve better than that. I wish you the best.|`|AA12308754	I am so sorry,Hun!!   I know that hurts.  My ex-wife saw nothing wrong with having a boyfriend on the side when we were married,so I have an idea how you feel.   <br>  <br>  Please contact my source below and ask them for some resources like "Rescue your love life"   "Every heart restored" and whatever else they might suggest.   <br>  <br>  It will not be easy....but it will get better........|`|Jj56ALSJaa	Awww I am so sorry that  this happened to you. Especially if there are children involved. Do either of you want to get back or I should say do you BOTH want to get it straightened out? Than go to  a professional and start talking and get it out in the open right away. It does no good to just pretend ya wanna fix it. If you can't forgive him you can't. And that's OK !! It is not an acceptable thing that he did. I don't know how old the kids are but you need to explain that   things are going wrong and if they are old enough  tell them.... with  order of course and being kind. but firm. If they are babies they will learn as they grow to deal with it.  And like you said he must not have loved or cared too much if he did this. I am sorry it is my opinion and others may think different but I have been married for 32 years and am still secure in my marriage to know  I can trust my husband when he goes out the door. Can you? Good luck  with it  and I hope  you find happiness in your life. Take Care and God Bless!!|`|TtBKvmoqaa	Molly, First let me say how very sorry I am for what you are going through. I commend you for even trying to forgive him. Do you still love each other? Divorce is very hard on children. But it may be harder on them to see and feel the tension between you and your husband. Especially if you fight alot. They can tell when something is not right. If you can't forgive him then most certainly you will never trust him. If there is no trust the marriage will slowly deteriorate to nothing. Which will be harder on all of you. May by its like this, you have the best of him, the kids, and what is left just doesn't look so good anymore! They always say that if they do it once they will do it again. Is that really the kind of relationship you want your kids to grow up to have? They do what they know and what they see. I hope that whatever you decide to do, for your heart to heal and you find peace with your self.|`|XH4EtD0raa	relax, his cheating has nothing to do with his love for the other receptical, it was lust, a port in a storm, he wanted to have sex with her, he comes home to you.   is it right, no, but get it right, it has nothing to do with love, when are women gonna learn this, men dont have to liove you to use you sexually.|`|XY9GiItXaa	Marriage should be based on trust and respect. If you don't have it, never even use the excuse of "FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR CHILDREN".<br>  <br>  You'll save them more from hurting by just giving up if you feel that you can no longer forgive him.|`|f011d01882858984f24f9c6ebd66cf86aa	leave him you will never trust him again

Go get em!!!!|`|FEwM2qhDaa	Hey Dude, I am old enough to be your Dad, so I have had a bit of experience, so listen to what I say.<br>  <br>  I don't have to look at your picture. The kind of woman that you want will love YOU, NOT because you have rockstar good looks, but because you are a man of character and you are nice and friendly and kind and sweet. You are only 20, so don't pressure  yourself into thinking that something has to happen now. Just be you. Get to know girls on a friendship level. Go to Church groups for young single adults.<br>  <br>  When I was 21, I was just like you, I could have written what you just wrote.<br>  <br>  I will tell you what worked for me.<br>  <br>  I joined the Mormon Church and had a blast! I met so many good girls who had morals and values, girls who look at a guys character, not his looks. I tell you, character is all I had to offer, I don't have good looks. I found lots of great girls to be friends with and we went out and we had fun. I married one of them! It is a good thing that you are a virgin, good girls will respect that SO MUCH!!<br>  <br>  Get on lds.org and request missionaries. Two young guys your age will come to your house and tell you of the great life that you can have and how you can meet the best girls on the planet, the kind of girls who look at your heart, your goodness, your character. The kind of girls who will help you be the best man that you can be.<br>  <br>  That is what I did when I was feeling the same things you were feeling right now.<br>  <br>  Dude, you can be meeting lots of great friends by next weekend. Go ahead and change your life for the better and head down the road to meeting that really special gal now! Leave me a message with contact information if you want me to help you out.|`|o5f2fTsPaa	when i read your question, i really had a visual of some ugly young guy in my mind.<br>  then i saw your pic...  and surprised. <br>  i thought you were really just an average looking guy.<br>  i don't know how tall you are but unless you are 5"6 or shorter you are fine.<br>  you don't look like brad pitt or will smith but hey who looks like them?<br>  more than 80% are average and only 20% of them are above average looking.<br>  <br>  just like jennifir said, i have seen so many cute girls with just average looking guys.<br>  those guys usually have good personalities with a great sense of humor.<br>  <br>  my advice to you is work up your confidence. don't be shy around girls.<br>  if you really feel shy to apprach girls. try online girls first.<br>  just talk to them. maybe add them on messenger if they are nice.<br>  you can practice that way.|`|AA10116907	Ah, you look fine.  You not having a girlfriend has nothing to do with your looks.  What attracts girls towards you is your personality.  If you have personality, you'll do fine with females.  Looks attract females for the first fraction of a second, and after that, it's all personality.  If you feel insecure about finding a girl, then girls will pick up on that and gravitate AWAY from you.  Project confidence, and you will greatly improve your chances.|`|6RPLWdF6aa	I'm just going to be completely honest. Please don't be offended, but visually you're really not my type. However, you seem like a cool guy (from what you've said about your personality). So, that should win you some points. Look around, there are tons of hot girls who have boyfriends who are not quite as hot. Most of us rank personality above looks. <br>  <br>  Also, you say that you dress well and use nice cologne. How do you dress and what cologne do you use? Some guys who dress TOO well and wear TOO much cologne can come off as being gay. So, you want to make sure you're not over-doing it there! <br>  <br>  Best of luck. :-)

A day will come when someone sees you for the person you truly are.  Then they will feel like the lucky one because they are with you.  It's better to wait and find someone who loves you for you than jumping into a relationship just to be in one.  Those are the ones people regret.|`|wNOR4MHtaa	write someone a note or just casually say hi to someone you like to see what their reaction is dont be shy you are probably attractive or a very nice person you should not give your friend a note to give to them that is too elementary school unless you are in elementary school if you ask someone out and they say no it means you are too good for them and walk away and find someone else|`|AA12070828	Nothing wrong with you.

He had to be talked back into it. 5 years from now he will be cheating on you because he is not happy but his family will love you. If only you could marry his family everything would be wonderful.<br>  <br>  Your were happy with your new boyfriend until the X came back into your life. That is understandable because you had strong feelings for the X. You were about to get married, and you were dumped! You remember that time when everything was wonderful, your future was bright, and want that to be true again. Now it has interfered with your present relationship. <br>  Tell him, the X, to go away. He had his chance and proved to be unworthy.<br>  One reason we have dating, engagements, and weddings is to give each party a chance to pull out before its to late.

You'd be risking what you have now for almost no upside.<br>  <br>  Think about it.  Do you really think your ex would make you THAT much happier than the "really happy" you are now?  It would have to be almost pure ecstasy all the time imo to risk the downside of things ultimately busting out with your ex after you dumped your current bf.<br>  <br>  And the risk is pretty sizeable that it would end up the same way.  Think of all the residual emotional "hotspots" that you retain as a result of the breakup.  Do you think that those wouldn't flare up from time to time if you went back to your ex.<br>  <br>  Happiness is just a state of mind.  It can't be quantified into a comparative analysis.   <br>  <br>  If you believe you're really happy now, then you are.  Trust that<br>  feeling you have now and don't mess with it.|`|3259d7fcc72545f67e78fa6dc2b97998aa	Maybe you need to be by yourself for a while to know your feelings.

You can only give this part of you away once and most importantly only to one person. My advice would be is to wait until you are both adults and are sure that you love each other and want to be together for LIFE. If you do have sex just remember to be smart. Use protection. <br>  <br>  To take a line from my favorite movie Never Been Kissed-"No one is going to want to buy the ice cream truck when you are handing out the popcicles for free."|`|sfDq3s97aa	When you no longer have to ask this question about is it to early or not.

Si no quieres hacerlo tú. Deja que lo haga él. Apaga el celular cuando creas que te va a llamar, frecuenta los amigos que dejaste de ver por tu relación, haz lo que no le gusta que hagas y a ti te gusta hacer, y poco a poco terminará sintiéndose ridículo y él mismo te propondrá terminar la relación. No se trata de humillar a la persona, sino de hacer lo que más te gusta y que has dejado de hacer por él. Tuve una novia a la que me pasaba todo el tiempo consintiendo, pero cada vez estaba más insoportable y yo ya no la aguantaba. Un buen día conocí a otra chava, que no me gustaba pero me caía muy bien. Fuimos a tomar un café, apagué el celular, platiqué horas y horas muy relajado, y ni siquiera me besé con ella. Mi novia me buscó y se enfureció al no encontrarme. Presentí que ella misma, sin realmente quererlo, me terminaría y así fue.

9dO5jV8yaa	he doesn't really like you|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	He sounds as though he's very shy & don't fault him for that, if that's the case. The next time he tells you he's coming over, tell him you may not be home, so call ahead of time. Do that more than once & in time, he'll get the message. In time, his shyness will wear off. I think he really likes you but can't get past his shyness right now. Give it time, but let him know you aren't going to sit at home waiting for him to come over.|`|AA11133649	He doesn't want to go to your house because he knows that you should be studying to improve you knowledge of the English language.|`|6c83086ac56b1873cb365b6abd1892a0aa	Maby he is playing games with you, when I was dating, I hated it when they did that, now I do not have to worry, because I have a wonderful marriage to a wonderful man of fifteen years! <br>  <br>  But he is still playing games with you, it is the lack if immaturity that he has.<br>  <br>  A lack of immaturity and pure shyness. He needs to grow up, how can you have a relationship with anyone like this one?<br>  <br>  Get one that can actually talk to you and have conversations with you and keep his honor when he says he is going to visit you!|`|8531ad23f07efdb2af658b8bf062727faa	if he has a tiny brain, why do you care|`|BwzcEQcRaa	Maybe he is painfully shy.|`|HHYPgtgpaa	Hmmm.... that is pretty wierd, talk to him.

b5fxVlzjaa	i am a girl and in my opinion you still have a shot because she would not just say that to make you feel better she means it. but it could mean she just wanted a break. if your wondering why it probably means you do something she doesnt like. ask her if she broke up with you because of something you do but make sure you dont say anything back after she does or doesnt tell you why just say okay and before she answers make sure she knows nothing she says can make you not like her or effect your friendship. if you think its a reasonable reason just stop whatever your doing and when she knows you stopped ask her out again and see what she says if she says no find out the reason why and respect her answer. if she says yes then you got your girlfriend back and that answers your question. dont chicken out the worst that can happen is she says no and your just friends and the best thing that can happen is she says yes and you get your girlfriend. as you can see there is nothing you can lose with trying.|`|F0aVtkFnaa	GET ANOTHER GIRL make her see what she lost|`|c6206b40d5e4899522260146aef60470aa	It sounds pretty weird to me.  If she didn't like you "chillin" with her brother, why didn't she tell you before she broke up with you?  Or did she tell you and you didn't take it seriously?  I can't imagine why someone who thinks she will date you in the future would break up with you now.  It doesn't make sense.  I would move on.|`|HHYPgtgpaa	Yeah, just make sure you stay good friends with her!
IYwPL8BVaa	I think you should think this through. If you are having doubtsnow, then you should wait. The Marines and Airforce will always be there if you decide it is what you want. Take you ASVAB, your score stays good for 2 years. Then if by then you still are unsure, then you would be able to take the test again. That test is also good for 2 years. and so on. So take your time, and don't rush into something you are unsure about. You don't want to make the wrong decision.|`|P8WAKaWBaa	Well the current situation of the world today does make you a little worried but if I were you I would pray about the situation first and then I would follow my heart.If this is your dream to become a photo journalist then do it you know its good money and everything and well you are doing this your boyfriend can be working on your career also...smile and I am so glad things worked about between you two|`|H7hwiGNAaa	Follow your ammbitions. It is worth it no matter what! Men will come around again, and you never know this one might even wait for you. But dont give up on your dreams of life that you have had forever, this is an oppertunity to see the world and build character. If you are lucky enough to be presented with this opertunity, it would be silly and ungreatful to not take it. So my advice to you, is take a breath decide if you really want it and take it. Be who you want to be, and experience the world for  yourself. Congrats on the man and recieving this great honorable opertunity!|`|AA12288732	well if he cares about you then he will understand  what you want  in life and not stand in the way go fulfill your dreams and if he is still  there then its all good he it will probably work out don't worry so much|`|uWfOypP6aa	everyone in life wants to make the perfect choice....right?yes....so now the perfect choice is the choice of your soul a choice not influenced by anything not love nor hate.....so think of that choice and listen to your soul it will tell you what you should do......:)luck sweetie

bSVlTvlcaa	It wouldn't be an ammendment to the divorce decree.  It would be contesting the estate for the children's sake.  Hire a lawyer and go through everything with him.  His children, if they are under age, should have a right to their father's life insurance, especially if he hadn't remarried since your divorce.  You have a good shot at winning a settlement.|`|iVjd9lE4aa	No, this is not going to happen, the divorce is done you should have talk to your lawyer before you signed the papers. Bottom line it's over with and you do not have a leg to stand on.

If the life insurance was not in the original decree, you likely will not be able to go back and change it now that he is dead.   The military stuff is complicated however, and I have seen a few cases where they have awarded back benefits but in very different circumstances from this.. It may be worth talking to a lawyer who really really knows this stuff.

SZTm6mwmaa	The first thing you need to ask yourself is do I want to be Right or do I want to restore the peace and I love I want from this person. If you want to be right then I say there are no rules because in your mind you want to win. You can not win without usually inflicting damage to your relationship<br>  Now if you want to get back to Love, you need to be willing to share your feelings about how it has made you feel and ask how can we resolve this issue. Then come to an agreement that is mutual. If it happens again you have an agreement that you can renew quickly or the agreement is broken and you need a new resolution. Say your sorry even if its not your fault. It helps to get one from the other party , because usually they can't stand the guilt. Now move on to being loving..|`|2bf9c8457088df58616d846f406df38caa	never bring up the past, even as an example to illustrate a point.  don't interrupt. no name calling.|`|98769fffa0481bb79aada0c23b9f40f9aa	1.

mF7bgDZZaa	Marriages that are published in the paper are there because the married couple wanted a public announcement made of their union. That is the choice of the couple to make, and is not a legal obligation. You would have to call the newspaper yourself to tell them you wanted it published. <br>  <br>  As long as you have legal documentation from the US Virgin Islands, (like a marriage certificate, or other document) you're fine. If you don't have a copy, try to obtain one as soon as possible, because it will come in handy from time to time, regardless of where you were married.|`|gBAYTYEHaa	You are almost certainly married. If your marriage was legal in the Virgin Islands then you are married here. Publishing in t he paper is not generally required.  who is"aware" of the marriage does not matter.

08wGmXu8aa	Kevin and I just got married in June... but before that we long-distance dated for a full two years because he graduated college 2 years before me. It was definitely hard, and I know what you are going through. I got jealous even when he just went to hang out and drink with the boys. I think it is because you miss them so much and you wish that they made more time to talk to you and to miss you back. We fought all the time on the phone but were so happy when we could be together. The best I can tell you is to hang in there and remember what you love about bwing with him so much when you are having a hard time with him being gone. Keep yourself busy with your own friends and your own awesome life. It will get better I promise!|`|aelsl0bzaa	sometimes i do for my bf is at least 16-20 hrs away and we barely ever see or talk to each other cuz we dont have enuff time lol but i do get jealous but its natural especially if he is seeing some1 else|`|9OkjI52yaa	Maybe you could talk to him, tell him how you feel and ask him to not totalk about and give you details about "the girls" at work all the time anymore...<br>  Really, for him to talk about them all the time, that would make me jealous and... it may be that is exactly what kind of reaction he wants to get from you...it strokes his ego to know you are jealous...that's a very powerful feeling.<br>  <br>  .I would either talk to him, ignore it-even though it is bothering you, or turn the tables on him and talk about the guys that are firends in your life---just so he knows how it feels.<br>  Try not to put your heart on your sleeve so "out there", seem a little less easily available.<br>  <br>  ...take it from me, it can backfire on you and run him off...now if I can just take my own advice, I'd be da bomb....LOL<br>  <br>  Good luck, I have long distance one too..
f418a7ef7c081a4b77cf8c593f969692aa	Depends. This is so random a question. Only your ex-fiance will decide the probabilities of you being accepted. But accepted as a what? Fiance? Friend?  I guess as a fiance, eh. That being said, WHY do you want to be accepted now, and what has changed? Will you be able to give her a commitment now, as that is what she wants from you. Good luck, and try not screwing things up, OK. You have done it once, and once, sometimes is far too many already.

4ger20soaa	hi,<br>  im in that situation right now.<br>  i like this guy so much, i mean i love him and he doesnt know that i do love him. he think i like him as a friend.but it you want to send me a message and i'll give you more information...|`|AA11578426	Ok, have you thought that maybe she does "like like" you but is afraid of what other might think? Or maybe she's not allowed to date or scared to. It's sometimes hard for girls to date her best friends because she's afraid if something happens in the relationship the whole best friends thing will be over as well. Just try to reassure her that you guys will be friends no matter what even if your whole bf/gf thing doesn't work out.|`|AA12130864	P.A.R.E.N.T.S........<br>  <br>  She is just afraid of what her mother and father will think of there "little girl", going out with the big bad wolf (you).|`|BH8hBJdZaa	maybe she already has a crush on somebody...|`|7AyEnRSpaa	When i was sixteen i had a best freidn and we were freinds ever since he moved here . So we were best friends for 4 years and i always like him more than a friend and i had a feeling that he did too. ( and he was 17 at the time lol)he would always ask me if i liked him and i would always say no. and when i aksed him he would always say no. but then one day he just told me that he has always really had alot of feelings for me and i told him that i did too. im not with him anymore it only lasted for a year but we are still friends. <br>  <br>  but yeah so i dont really no for sure if she likes you because i think if she did that would have been her chance to finally let her feelings out. so maybe she doesn't. or maybe she just isn't sure because she doesn't want to lose a friendship. because that was why i never told my boyfriend in the first place|`|Am8YAA3jaa	hmm....i think if she liked u a lot, she would go for it. i dont think she's playing hard to get. just wait some time, maybe she'll "change her mind". good luck.|`|C6R8t5JCaa	i think she maybe not ready u can wait and see what will happened <br>  treat her normal show her that u are respect her desiggen|`|CYn7fITPaa	Oh god! This is a TOUGH one.  Yeah i've liked a guy alot but then also didn't want to go out with him for some reason? It's kind of a weird feeling.<br>  <br>  Obviously she could also be playing hard to get, maybe to seek revenge! <br>  <br>  If the case is she's playing hard to get then you're best option is to be nice to her and let her know how you feel, don't play the same game as her! The worst thing ever is when GUYS start playing hard to get! One day she'll see that you're being completely serious and she  may give you a chance =]|`|DhAwgktWaa	Maybe shes just not ready to date.... or maybe she thinks you only like her to get into her pants|`|ENyDoVuFaa	shes probably shy seeing as how thats my problem and I've been in that situation so many times its not funny :[[<br>  <br>  she might not like you anymore ( hard to forget though)<br>  <br>   she could be playing hard to get to see how much you actually like her and your not playing some cruel joke (which i hope your not)<br>  <br>        try a little harder and flirt with her a lot|`|iMpEJQstaa	hmm, i have like the same problem too. i like a guy a lot and have gone on a date with him but if he asks me out i dont know if ill even consider it actually. she is probably trying to think things over and deciding if its worth it to surender ur friendship for sumthing like dating. if/when u guys slit. she could loose a very valuable friendship.|`|722561d7c12f06d39d643393351ba989aa	Not that Ive been in this situation, but im around ur ages and I would let her be, dont push her into being with you. If she wants to be with you she will eventually.|`|0o8qI0V0aa	So she just wants to be a friend? I don't know of any friend which would abuse the other and lead them on.<br>  <br>  You're young and you have plenty of time to find out yourself but I'll give you a clue:<br>  <br>  "Let's just be friends" means "Fvck you" in a polite and mannered way. <br>  <br>  She doesn't want to be disliked or be perceived as a bad person. She probably doesn't want to feel responsible for your hurt fragile ego either. So its easier for her to be "nice" and hope that you pick on that she is simply not interessted in you.<br>  <br>  I really do believe that majority of so called friendships between a man and a woman are based on a LIE. <br>  Usually one of them wants something more intimate, be it sex or relationship, but is afraid to display his true intent for numerous reasons.<br>  So people tend to beat around the bush and hope that by some miracle, all of sudden the other person will fall for them, and give them what they want without even knowing what it is.<br>  <br>  More a guy waits, more she will loose her confidence in him that he is a man. Girls can pick quite fast on this and usually they know that the guy is interessted. However, in that case she also knows he is weak, insecure and manipulative, because he is afraid to let her know what he wants. And the more nice things a guy will do for her, more she will feel manipulated and bribed.<br>  <br>  Those girls who respect you won't take it and will tell you, for your own sake, to stop.<br>  Those girls who take your bribes will gladly lead you on and will walk all over you, again and again.<br>  <br>  I can give you hundereds of reasons why a girl will loose interesst in a guy but who cares about the reason? Its pointless to try to find out why someone doesn't like you and to try to MAKE them do so. Its IMPOSSIBLE! <br>  <br>  Ok, what that you can do now?<br>  <br>  You can tell her EXACTLY what you want from her in a very upfront and direct way, and tell her that you want her to bring up the honesty herself. If she continues with the LJBF crap, just walk away. Walk away for your own sake. Not in order to make her chase you, but because you want to respect yourself and dont' want to settle for lies and games.<br>  <br>  You just MIGHT have a slight chance if you behave as a man for once. And if she doesn't wanna go with, who cares.

SmlU6GSnaa	Hey, Paul. I'm shy too, It's something that never really goes away and I think it means that you are also sensitive to your environment and I  would venture to guess that you have some artistic talents, or at least have a vivid inner life. Not looking someone in the eyes means that you feel unworthy to share the same space with them. But, no one you meet feels this way too. People love to meet eyes. It helps them feel comfortable. You would make them feel comfortable when you do this. It's like shaking hands. They can't see through you , they are just as insecure as you are--Next time you meet their eyes  make THEM feel comfortable--they will appreciate it.|`|fUtXlQixaa	I am not going through the same thing but i think if people are focusing only that in their relationship with you and judge you without really trying to understand and get to know you better, they are not worth your effort anyway.  It is ok to be shy.  You need to work on your confidence issues and get help if you think you need to since it could make you feel better.  Until then if someone asks you to look them in the eye or something, tell them how you feel.  It is ok, actually even cute that you are shy.  Tell them that it is not because you don't care about them or anything.  Hope you meet people who will really understand what you are going through and help you.  Good luck!|`|xNs7wLaCaa	You should overcome this fear. Show no fear in talking to anyone, establish your self as dominant, and be confident.|`|CesNxG6paa	The only way to do this is if you force yourself to do so!  Everyday, look at 5 people in the eye.  3 girls 2 guys, increase the number every week.|`|ml8I5Adfaa	I know what you are going through. I was that same way before i changed. If you have close friends or family members that can help you, go to them for answers. You can't always be shy all your life cause you will miss out on great things. Sometimes you have go out of your shyness and show people who you really are. Even though shyness is part of you, show others who else you are. In a couple of months or weeks you may come out of your shell and not be so shy. I went through what you are going through and i understand the pain you are going through. I wish the best of luck to you and i hope that you will come out of your shell sooner or later. But don't worry, your shyness may be with all your life but it won't be so dominant and people won't always see it. I am always shy when i meet new people but once i get to know them,i am not so shy. <br>  I wish you the best of luck with  your shyness.
K2QKWja5aa	In Victorian times when there were Kings, and no mail service. LOL<br>  There was a special person who took messages from one place to the other. It was always the poor messenger who brought bad news or mail, to Kings and Queens    like your army has been slaughtered or the King of England thinks your wife is ugly. <br>  Usually this job was pretty good, you got to roam around meeting all kinds of cool people. But sometimes when the news was particularly bad the King would kill the messenger, because he couldn't take his immediate anger out on the one who sent him the news.<br>  So if you understand all that. You were the unfortunate messenger, and your Friend Lauren lashed out on you because this little trouble maker Keren was not there at the same time.<br>  Try to explain yourself as best as you can. Keren sounds like she will lose in the end if her true colors come to light. Don't give up on your friend Lauren.|`|aS6DxIR1aa	I would focus on your English skills and leave the other issues alone kid.....geezzz|`|43514fb4f537c87f247a098664ec5b3faa	I agree, work on your grammar & and dump your untrusting dramatic friends. If you stick around that group of people, it is tantamount to being flushed down a toilet.|`|HwXEhAnpaa	Dump those loser, some friends you have. I wouldnt bother with them|`|UvFCzV7haa	just breath, that is how friends are.|`|ml8I5Adfaa	All i can say is that they aren't the nicest friends in the world. If they want to spread rumors around about you and your friend, then they aren't your friends. They need to learn respect for others. Rumors are really hard to deal with and once it starts, it seems like it can't stop. But the only thing that is nice is that you believe your friend isn't bulimic and you didn't want rumors going around. i think that you should give them time to cool off and soon or later, they may come around and apologize. For right now, leave them alone and keep telling your self that the rumors aren't true and that you can find better friends than those who start rumors about you. <br>   i wish you the best of luck and i hope that you are still close to your friends. even if they don't come around but you never know. they may surprise you and apologize.
EocBpxjJaa	If she wasn't trying to tell you, she wouldn't hint at it.<br>  Just say casually "Well I could be him!"<br>  If she doesn't take to it, just be like "Hah, that would be kind of weird. Just kidding!"<br>  Go for it dude!|`|AA12389705	I would say yes, she's into you. <br>  Ask her to go somewhere with you-but just casually. Then see what happens.|`|c3kFdiDraa	depends if she was smiling!! lol but yeah just talk to her and find out how she feels about you! she just might like u!

heCuvfPSaa	I believe that if he or she shows them self why they are marriend then he's not into the marriged in the begining mistakes are mistkes that person is in the worng for what he or she did and you should never feel bad for what that person choosed to do |`|xKjecOTYaa	I would take a hammer and smash the computer. Burning bread in the oven is a mistake, exposing yourself on the computer is not.|`|jUEoujN2aa	acceptable...<br>  <br>  well if it's just for fun it would be ok. but if i had a spouse and they did that i'd take em straight to bed and mingle.|`|CLOtMCwSaa	Personally, I would give them the chance, if it was bothering me. For me, as long as it doesnt get to the point of where they are actually cheating on me physically, then I am ok with it. Yet if you do tell them to stop, that you dont like it, then they should. If that doesnt work, then start taking access away. Take the internet, take the computer. If they still try to do it after that, like find other ways to do so, or hook everything back up, then I would say drop them. Because that just goes to show that they are not going to stop. Hope this helps.|`|1epjqrflaa	I think both of them need help from a professional. There is obviously something missing in this marriage. It is NEVER ok to expose yourself on the internet. It is trashy and it is cheating as far as Im concerned. This sounds like a very unhealthy relationship.|`|AA10500615	Mistakes happen once, not over and over. Sounds like he isn't even sorry, which means it was no mistake to him. Trust me, I'm in a very similar situation, and your problem is only the very beginning if you stay. It WILL get worse.|`|q7HzEn9Yaa	You mean like in your question?<br>  <br>  Cuz, no offense. but it's full of mistakes.<br>  <br>  But in all seriousness, this same thing happened to my mom, and my mom left the guy ASAP. <br>  <br>  Don't get wrapped up in his world.<br>  If this is happening to you, get out quick.|`|tdAIY8Xbaa	Leave him.|`|aOjAdvUUaa	I believe that there are unacceptable mistakes. The ones that are not acceptable are the ones your gut instinct is telling you its wrong. Go with your gut feeling don't listen to a list of mistakes people may or may not give you. This is something you'll have to judge yourself. If that were my situation though, If I was the one doing the exposing, I would have to accept whatever anger he had towards me. If that were him I would be really upset, there would not be a good enough excuse as to why he would do something like that.|`|hQXG49xdaa	Honey I know that if your spouse is sneaking around online and exposing themselves to other people then you have a problem. The wrong thing for you to do is ignore it because that kind of behavior is unacceptable and should never be tolerated. You need to confront this person and expose them! Let them know that your not  stupid and you know whtat's going on and that it's going to stop. you have to be strong and stand up for yourself. Cheating comes in many diffrent forms it can be emotional, physical and yes cyber cheating counts too. I think you should try talking to a pastor or marriage counselor because if you are going to save your marriage you need to take action now. And if your spouse refuses to stop the cyber cheating and refuses to go to marriage counseling then I would tell them you are gone. Try a seperation period for the spouse to realize their mistake and if that doesn't work then you deserve better and I would file for a divorce. Adultry is a biblical and moral reason to get a divorce. hope everything works out for you.|`|xtVelindaa	I'd say the first time it's a mistake, after that I wouldn't really consider it much of an accident and no, that little situation shouldn't be acceptable the first time, let alone the second. ?<br>  <br>  If a person was sorry, it wouldn't happen again. If they cared enough it wouldn't have happened to begin with. I personally would have a difficult time trusting that that person remains faithful through the remainder of the marriage. I don't think I'd forgive em, especially if it was reoccurring problem. <br>  <br>  The only mistakes I find acceptable are those that don't hurt others or evade others lives. if it puts strain on your relationship why stay? He doesn't care enough to even think about your feelings. Maybe you should reconsider trusting him again.<br>  good luck! ?<br>  ?,<br>  Elizabeth Lynn<br>  <br>  |`|YAiKlPkMaa	Where do you draw the line? You have to ask yourself this. I think when you start sending pics of yourself and chatting you have just stepped it up to the level right below meeting in person. This is nonsense when you are married. This is what single people do when they don't have anyone or they are on the prowl.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	mistakes are accidents beyond your control.<br>  <br>  exposing yourself is not a mistake.  Unless drugs or alcohol were involved (and that's a whole other issue right there) it is a premeditated/deliberate act.<br>  <br>  this is your marriage.  you know what you want and how you want to live.  You are the only one who can decide if this kind of behavior is acceptable, tolerable, or reprehensible & a deal breaker to you.  <br>  <br>  Is your spouse right at this moment in time of the caliber of person that you would want to spend eternity with?  Not how you want him/her to be, but as they are right now.<br>  <br>  If you find yourself turning into someone that you don't like because you are so busy chasing after your spouse to check up on him/her then that is one indication that you are with wrong person.<br>  <br>  You have to decide what you want out of life and what you want and expect out of marriage and then find someone who believes the same as you.  you can't retrofit someone who doesn't share your values into that mold after the fact.  You have to be with that person going in from day one.<br>  <br>  so "no" you don't just blindly accept insincere apologies.  what you have to do is truly see the person you married and either accept them as they are--warts and all--or realize that you've made a mistake and move on.<br>

I tell my hubby everything but that is just the way we are with each other. However, if my hubby was the one who had done that then I would rather he take it to his grave. I don't want to know, would rather not know and have a wonderful marriage then to know and loss the love of my life. That is the only thing we think divorce is ok for.|`|0le6RYndaa	If I was to be honest, It would be judging.<br>  <br>  I think everybody has secrets that they regret, but I don't think we should take them with us to our graves.  I think you would feel better if you came out and admitted to it.  You need to show maturity and take responsibilities of your actions.  You wouldn't like it if that person close to you did that to you, now would you?|`|m8UEGUaGaa	Yes, I think most people have something they don't want anyone to know. I don't keep them bottled up inside I write them all in my journal and I confess them and pray for forgiveness. <br>  <br>  Tell me more about you sleeping with this spouse? It will help to get it out & I won't judge you.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Other than sleeping with the mother-in-law and sisters, I guess that would be all I will be taking to the grave with me.|`|yRKnC05Baa	yes. i am just 18. i have done some bad things. <br>  <br>  but i don't know if it is best for me to tell my spouse what i did.|`|AA12382198	I do have a secret I will take to my grave.<br>  <br>  However it's not anything that serious or that big......it wouldn't jeopardize my marriage.....no judgment.|`|IocgFjr2aa	I have tons of secrets that no one will EVER know.

He, however, should have realized that signing off so soon would make you feel like you were overreacting. He doesn't think you're weird. I think he predicted the sentimental goodbyes and all and might have wanted to avoid it. I just think it's like that...<br>  Hope this helps.|`|6TTYSa8Gaa	i think hes lazy sometimes it happened to me too but.me too i respond like that when i don't n the mood to talk.always make wat u say nteresting and dont make him get bored.hop it helps|`|6hbwzVifaa	Guys are so weird! You've not done anything wrong. Its hes problem and hes not worth it obviously!|`|Yj9vo8a5aa	come on!! you're not weird. It sounded like he doesn't wanna talk about it and wanna move away. You know ,guys are like that . They don't like you talk about what they feel and don't like to listen what you feel ,because they know that they will feel guilty. he'S just a silly guy. <br>  I recommend not to give any explanation .It won't fix anything. and 2 years far away from you?? come on girl,there are better fishes in the sea. Be strong.|`|cc7160f5f74bd8f083c00b91ee3d1f53aa	A lot of guys wouldn't cry over a friend leaving, so it's not that you're weird to him, girls are weird.  And if he's a guy that's not into talking about feelings and such, well, he probably uncomfortable talking about that.  If you're ok with that, then all you have to say is that you're really close to your best friend (not weird), and that if it's weird for him to hear about that, then you won't go about it.
nlGKHX8Aaa	go to the police and if you are scared to do that tell your parents, in fact tell your parents anyway. They might be mad at you for drinking while being under aged but they will  be more pissed off at the guy and will make sure that things happen to set things right. |`|s4psKJrPaa	YIKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Octzpyyhaa	Excuse me.....but you sound very dumb.  Thats called Date Rape....you should tell this story to the Police....they will know what to do.|`|GXm20LUKaa	Tell the police you shouldn't keep this to yourself. If you tell the police you will prevent him from doing this to another girl. Also go to the Doctor and get yourself checked although i think it's too soon to know if your pregnant you can check for any stds.|`|CVo1SxfJaa	Idiots make idiotic decisions, what can I say. We blokes only go to parties to do that.|`|f702c2af2dcb2922666c0e47e515ace4aa	I understand you made a mistake and got drunk, but the thing is what he did was wrong and could be considered rape depending on your age. I also think you need to go to a doctor and be tested for STD's and pregnancy because you dont know anything about this person. Have you seen this tape yourself?? If not get a copy and go to the police and tell them the situation so that something can be done about it, they will be able to tell if it you gave him permission or not, they will also be able to tell that you were drunk and didnt know about anything going on. Everybody makes mistakes but that does not give him permission to take advantage of you. I know your scared but you need to take action and do something about this.|`|kYa44IQhaa	u learned ur lesson
RL9wZs3Iaa	I think it could possibly work if you create sort of a "secret admirer" type thing. This could help both steer his mind away from other potential partners and it could intrigue him to find out who it is...which could lead to good things. It may be kind of a risk, but it's for you to decide what you want to do.|`|Chl8Wdj7aa	if you want to kno how he feels then dont avoid it, just ask him straight up but politely. . i kno u dont want to ruin the friendship u 2 share, but ask him but at the same time try to avoid asking him fully. so ask him in the terms of like what if we were more then friends? u kno? ask him but at the same time try to avoid the question|`|m06Ra7Adaa	thats dumb =D<br>   just  tell him how you feell !<br>  if you do it like that he'll just know that some one likes him,<br>  not that you do|`|puuJQgmTaa	Tell him yourself, youre not being honest if your hidding bihinde a fake name, and how do you know he would believe it?|`|W2PqYlwgaa	tell him and if he saids no then ask please don't ruin your friendship because of me|`|5Rvb6IhXaa	No its not. Just tell him how you feel. Maybe he feels the same way.|`|1sA5pUV1aa	he's not going to know how you feel if your hiding, but at the same time it might be a good way to express yourself and for him to start to think about whats around him. When we like someone we tend to miss little things, like signs that other people like us. We are so blinded by what we want that we dont see what others want. so By telling him in secret it will keep him guessing.

AA11698804	ok I am man in a similar situation but I am on other side of the whole Q. I think he found something really interesting in you which he lacks at home. So he is flirting with you, he has fear for sure but let me tell you, unless u open up and show signs, he wont advance. So now you have to decide whether you still want to flirt with him. If you are ready to have some fun and have self-control(coz anyway he will leave you after some months/yrs), then go ahead. If you do not want flirt around then it is just waste of time for both. Try to give negative signals straight away. To tell you more in detail, I think he is more thinking like a filmy passion not rough one. If he is turning off, then cut off things fast.|`|gJE9WFYuaa	What are you doing messing with a married man...and accepting emails! You say he flirts with you at work,but not inappropriately? If his wife doesn't know, then how innocent are they? And you ask,'what is up with that?' I think you need to quit playing with fire or you're going to get burned. If he will flirt with you behind his wifes back,then don't you think he'd do the same to you? He's a loser and I think you need to think more of yourself than that.|`|UCpdxLPhaa	All talk and no go.  He's just playing with you.  I'm sure his wife wouldn't be happy about all the flirting and emailing and may consider it an emotional affair.  Keep things professional with him.  You might also want to check your company's computer use policy to ensure you aren't violating it and risk getting fired.|`|0EB2ZR0Gaa	He wants to socialize with you and his wife?  And that doesn't seem really odd to you?   Unless the three of you share some common hobby, like say bike-riding, I think this just looks like a guy interested in some odd three-some behaviors that I'd personally stay a mile away from.|`|8MCjqTONaa	i think he is testing your waters. He wants to see how far he will get with u. I wouldnt trust him though. He will start with touching u and then taking it further so be very careful.|`|e35e563de072fa05692e56acda24a6e9aa	I have several thoughts on his man . Maybe he is curious as to whether or not you are interested in him.  He may be trying to figure out if you are interested.  His thinking could be that if you are interested in him that you would say no to his invite because of his wife, but because you said yes he realized you don't have feelings for him.  He sounds like he has issues!  To keep inviting you to get together and then going back on his word is strange.  You also mentioned that you would want to double date , well if you told him this he may of got turned off.<br>  His wife and him may want to have a little fun with you.  But another person is not what they are into.<br>  My advice would be stay away from him, don't answer e-mails.  He has a plan for you, which is fine if that's what you are in to, but if not stay away from him because he sounds like a Royal Creep!!  By the way he is not on the up and up!!!.<br>  Good luck<br>  P.S.- He may be lying about the misses being there  and when you accept his invite he chickens out.  Ha!|`|2yUhUV2Iaa	He is just "taking you for a ride".  no need to doubledate to set boundaries. just totally avoid this person. 
cAVIaVApaa	porque no es nada|`|AA10492394	por eso hay una tendencia a no casarse, si te fijas cada vez la gente dura soltera mas tiempo, los que se casan son porque "se comen la torta antes de tiempo" o porque realmente quieren casarse por amor, supongo que a los que te refieres que se separan son los que tienen hijos antes del matrimonio y como no se amaban realmente (ni querian usar proteccion para el sexo), pues luego vienen esos problemas que tu mencionas|`|UiBV7eK6aa	Este fenómeno sucede a partir de que la mujer abandona el hogar en pos de competir laboralmente con el hombre,  debido a múltiples razones (abandono,  orgullo,  independencia, etc.) Las mujeres que se han quedado solas,  no les queda otra.  pero la gran mayoría de las mujeres solteras que trabajan,  jamas podrán ser amas de casa o madres como las de antes ya que se han convertido en proveedoras.  El rol de la familia esta muy claro incluso en la naturaleza,  uno de los padres sale a ganar el sustento y el otro se queda cuidando el hogar,  protegiendo y educando a las crías,  incluso se turnan en los roles pero jamas,  a diferencia del ser humano,  ambos dejan abandonado el hogar.   Como ambas partes son capaces de adquirir bienes y servicios es muy común que esta asociación de 2 personas pueda disolverse rápidamente ya que ninguno depende del otro,  estamos claros que la mujer de casa due?a de hogar depende economicamente de su proveedor,  pero es ella en un principio quien decide con cual de los proveedores que se le ofrecen se quedara.   En conclusión,  las parejas hoy en día están mas motivadas por iniciativas sexuales y no por crear una sociedad para cimentar una familia,  estas familias sin due?a de hogar carecen de identidad y por lo general terminan en divorcios o separaciones.|`|8985ae6e3e49ff3e9484f717c77c7b68aa	Siempre han existido familias incompletas por una u otra razón y  en muchos casos, eso no ha sido impedimento para que los hijos salgan adelante.<br>  Mi impresión personal es que antes el deber, el pensar en los demás era muy valorado, ahora no, hoy muchos consideran más importante el estar centrado en uno mismo y "si no me gusta, no me sirve, no me otorga satisfacción a mí, entonces no tiene valor" se vive la vida teniendo como misión la auto complacencia, entonces cuando el conyuge o  los hijos estorban en ese camino pues a hacerlos a un lado y a lo que sigue.<br>  Además, en su mayoría, la sociedad misma llama ahora tonta, etc, a quienes se dan a sí mismos a los demás y son personas honorables, honestas, que cumplen con su deber;  parecería que las nuevas generaciones somos "más estudiadas"  pero menos humanas.|`|8hDGPZlkaa	Creo que somos demasiado materialistas y muy muy egoístas , si eso lo unimos a que la competitividad de la vida en general la aplicamos también en la vida familiar..................bingo ya tenemos la bomba de relojería y todo estalla sin que nadie quiera arriesgar para que eso no ocurra.|`|RAMGrIE4aa	Antes criaban a las personas bajo el credo "el matrimonio es para siempre"; el divorcio se veia como algo terrible y casi de otro mundo, ahora ya no. <br>  <br>  En estos tiempos, pensamos en que la vida es una sola y tenemos que buscar la felicidad asi que nos casamos y si se presentan problemas simplemente "renunciamos" a eso sin esforzarnos por arreglar nada y seguimos buscando sin importar cuantas veces haya que repetir los mismos errores. Pero debo decir tambien que hay casos en los que el divorcio es lo mejor para todos, incluyendo a los ni?os.
hffW7Uy7aa	The best solution to any problem with a friend is to just tell them what's going on.  Trust me on this, if there is a problem in a friendship, and neither one of you says something, than it just get's worse and worse till the friendship doesn't exist anymore.  Don't lose a friend becasue you didn't at least try to keep it alive.  Always talk, it really does help.  And she probaly doesn't know she's annoying you, so if you tell her that, nicely, than she'll be more likely to understand.|`|4u3r3eYvaa	Your old BFF---"old"-thats is why you shouldn't label friends.

LxvA4vGpaa	That is funny.  <br>  <br>  But to be honest.....I think we are pretty much screwed either way we go.   It amazes me that neither party chose a candidate that is even worth a darn. McCain is showing signs of dementia and is way to short tempered...and don't even get me started on freaking Palin.  She is white trash at it's finest.  and well, Obama I don't think has enough experience.  He is one hell of a smooth talker, but being president is more than just being able to charm people.  <br>  |`|y9CgveCGaa	My family.|`|Mo5xfgOnaa	left and right testicle.

I agree with alot of what he says, but mostly I think I am more drawn to vote for him because of all the idiotic crazy racist comments about him.  <br>  <br>  You know for all those that say he is muslim.  My ancestors came from Germany so does that make me a nazi??  Or there are some from Sweden hmm what does that make me now?

f4653542288455cd58da95dd853b1fc7aa	I would say so, most guys are like if I don't like them in any way then why stay up and waist my time talking to them that long? My girlfriend and I have stayed up all night talking before and neither one of us had any regrets about it because we both really enjoy talking to each other. If a guy talks to you that long he really likes/loves you. I hope this helps you and good luck.|`|nKiwypRdaa	See...I need confirmation on that too.  I strongly think they do. I mean wut else could it be?  I'm experiencing that myself with someone that i've loved for almost 15 yrs. We can talk for hrs about anything except feelings.  Reason being he thinks it would be wrong for us to have a relationship b/c I had an insignificant encounter with his brother yrs ago before i met him.  I told his brother not thinking he would care. And surprisingly he said I was trying to go thru the family, which made me feel cheap. That's not my style at all. I just really hate I met the wrong guy first. I've posted a question about it.  haven't gotten much feedback.|`|1YyUUGpHaa	um ya i woundnt just talk to girls that late if i didnt like them|`|c8df8677102b4aa018d49e13a3a22b65aa	i would say so, at least i did, because if you didnt like that person you would only need one second (lol) to find a reason to get OFF the phone|`|CeZF4j7xaa	Not really!

Oh, je sais les tenants du dogme pur et dur de la monogamie absolu vont m'identifier comme un dragueur ou un coeur d'artichaut, ce n'est pas du tout cela. Ceux qui ont vu le film de Truffaut, l'homme qui aimait les femmes savent que le personnage jouer par Charles Déner est absolument sincère en voulant s'investir auprès de toutes celles qui l'entourent. Il ne triche pas, il n'essaye pas de jouer avec les sentiments de ses différentes partenaires, ils les aiment et les veut les chérir sincèrement. Ce n'est pas non plus un érotomane dans la mesure où il ne cherche pas forcément le contact sexuel mais se sens bien et épanouie avec le contact des femmes qu'il aiment de tout son coeur. Je vous conseille à toutes ce film qui en dehors des harems orientaux, s'approche le plus de moi et de mes attentes en matières d'amour.|`|TH3yzReRaa	Oui, cela m'arrive.

lN7ujxXHaa	Cela fait huit mois qu'elle t'a quitté comme une merde et sans raison. Je ne comprend pas trop pourquoi tu as accepter de la revoir. As tu encore des sentiments pour elle? ou est ce de la pitié?<br>  Je ne souhaite pas être méchante mais je te comprend pas. J'ai vécu à peut près la même histoire mon ex copain m'a largué car en plus d'être marié il m'a avoué qu'il serait mieux pour nous deux qu'on ne se voit plus. Sa aurait du être moi qui aurait dut le quitter pour ce qu'il venait de m'annoncer.<br>  J'ai accepter la situation et je lui ai dit que c'était définitivement fini entre nous. Mais il a continué à m'envoyer des sms et à m'appeler pour avoir de mes nouvelles et me dire qu'il m'aimait encore et aussi qu'il souhaitais me revoir pour parler.<br>  Je n'ai jamais accepter de le revoir et c'est mieux ainsi. On m'a toujours dit de ne jamais ressortir avec un ex. Mon copain actuel ne comprenait pas pourquoi j'acceptai de recevoir des sms de lui. Cela a donc créer une crise dans notre couple.<br>  Je pense que tu devrais lui faire comprendre définitivement que tu ne souhaite plus avoir de nouvelle d'elle autrement le jour ou tu auras une relation avec une fille elle risque de faire sa réapparition ce qui ne plaira pas forcément à ta copine|`|MaQ1c3B5aa	fais plus gaffe à tout ?a ?.. pourquoi conna?tre les vrais raisons sinon pour te faire souffrir?.. tourne la page.. et la vie continue!.. de toute fa?on , elle est très mal dans sa tête et dans sa peau?.. elle ne pourrait t'apporter que des ennuis?..bon courage et l'amour t'attend plus loin!...|`|2ByM8ul9aa	Il ne faut peut être pas donner d'importance à ce qui n'en a pas.... elle semble empêtrer dans ses explications, regarde devant toi et oublie le passé, cela ne fait pas avancer dans la vie.....|`|2b06888b1d7dc7db18180f3613d17dd7aa	laisse tombé fait ta vie  différament  et oublie la elle a une vrai raison mais veux pas te l expliquer|`|LAZRQ86uaa	Arrête de te prendre la tête, savoir si elle a menti ou non n'"importera rien du tout !!

How about you suggest to her that she work on her listening and understanding skills when you both have an argument.  Its not just about who is right and who is wrong, its about understanding and listneing to your spouse so you are both satisfied with the outcome.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Logic? Woman and Logic do not mix.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	Because you're a man and she's a woman.  <br>  <br>  You have it good actually.  When we get to a point where it's going to go my way, my wife will say she doesn't care.  She will NEVER say "ok we will do it your way".  She will not show any weakness or compromise at all.  So at least your woman is giving you half the credit.<br>  <br>  You will learn over time that women are lying, deceitful, immoral, and inconsiderate.  It is no coincidence that most world religious leaders and philosophers were all men.  This is not because of sexism, it's because women are literally un-interested in logic, reason, or morality.  Those are all "real" things constructed by men.  Women prefer to operate in a gas where they can trick you to their advantage, regardless of what may be commonly known as "right or wrong" or "fair".<br>  <br>  Edit - redhead above said it best... "there is not logic" ....ie, in a woman's mind, the idea of "logic" doesn't even exist, or if it does, it's like a leprechaun or a unicorn... just imaginative folly.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	She's competitive and hates to lose, or can't admit when she is wrong.<br>  My husband is similar. I have turned it into a joke over the years. We used to argue about it until one day I decided arguing over such stupid things was pointless. Even if I can prove I'm right, I let it go. I will say Oh honey I forgot you are always right...and wink. He usually smiles and says that's right, and winks back. I know I'm right I know he knows I'm right, but why make an argument out of it?|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Ha Ha.  Funny<br>  You know that saying about the rules of the house.<br>  <br>  1.  The wife is always right<br>  2.

fc7117280cedb9017461839769b2c21daa	ok here's your problem you wanna be friends but you have pursued her like you want so much more, you have to back off of her if you want her to even consider being friends; get her out of your mind for a while and let her come to you; friends don't chase down other friends; potential mates do. so take it easy.|`|icHg21t7aa	just wait....let her decide if she wants to be friends you cant push her! 
bqkfu6Diaa	If you intend to stay with him, you need to get over it and continue having intimate relations. You can also put your foot down and make it very clear that this was the last slap and another will not be tolerated. If you cannot bring yourself to get over it enough to be intimate with him, you need to break up.|`|SsfnitjXaa	It will take as long as it takes.  Don't even try until you feel comfortable.  Don't even feel bad about it.  He brought this on himself.|`|CCFhjtNBaa	This could be the start of it, warning sign right there. I would say leave, but if he raises his hand again in any way, get out|`|cdQryr7paa	For your sake I hope it is a one time incident.<br>  I don't know how long it will take before he can win back your trust, but that is up to you and how you handle it.<br>  You will know when the time is right.<br>  But, in the mean time, you can take advantage of him running around behind you kissing your butt.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Maybe it's too soon to be intimate with him.  I would give it some time and talk to him and find out WHY he did it (exactly why, explore a bit, not because it was the heat of the moment) and what can you both do to prevent it.  If he does it again, you need to seriously think about counseling.  Just give it time and just communicate.  Your trust has been perversed by his anger.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	Very interesting.  I think it's going to take time, perhaps a very long time.|`|HJEXk7Pmaa	WOW<br>  <br>  it will prob take a month to get this over with<br>  <br>  you should of slap him back|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	of course you cant be intimate, the person you loe the most hurt you and everytime you try to get close to him your subconcious mind is screaming for you to run before he hurts you again. it is jsut going to take time and a lot of distraction on his part to make it up to you.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	It only happened on Tuesday. I think it will take a while to get over this. Don't put any pressure on yourself to sleep with him. I think intimacy like hugging, kissing, cuddling is more important now. Take little steps. Just hold each other, or just lay next to each other. Sooner or later you should feel comfortable enough to sleep with him again.|`|AA11315360	Wow, that is awful. I would not trust him again. If he hit you once he will probably do it again. I suggest that you both go to counseling together to make sure his anger is under control and so you can work towards trusting him again.|`|goY0JHzlaa	Let me get this straight. He slapped you in a fit of rage and you are worried about having sex with him again? Come on.........|`|wia9SXCPaa	I don't think I would ever be able to get over it.  <br>  <br>  I have a zero tolerance policy to that.|`|fznvQptlaa	oh sweetie. that's sad. my husband and i have been married 5 1/2 yrs. we got married when i was only 18 and used to have a very stressful relationship. there was a time when we both put our hands on each other. we have since moved past that and have a very beautiful family. we are closer than ever and he is absolutely my best friend in this world. i don't think there is a quick fix for it. it is devastating when something u never dreamed would happen does. his reaction and guilt seems very sweet and appropriate. the patience is also amazing. i am a believer that time heals all things. it will get better.|`|lzooHi0Baa	You are the one that has to be patient, not him.  You are the victim.   He is just showing his true colors and apparently you did not know him well enough before you married him, at least not the violent part of him.   You might be in time to mend things if he agrees to go to anger management meetings, this will show how sorry he is and that he loves you.   Don't ever make up any excuses for this type of abuse, like maybe you deserved it, or you had it coming....There is never a reason nor excuse for such punishable by law act.|`|NPU2mpTjaa	I had a similar situation w/ my husband.  We had been married almost 10 years (it happened the evening before our anniversary) when we got into an arguement and he shoved me, pushing me into the fridge.  He had never been violent with me before.  I was stunned.  I didn't know quite how to react.  However, our 4 year old was standing right next to me, and I knew I couldn't let her see me just taking that kind of treatment.  So I punched him in the face and told him if he ever touched me in that manner again he would never see me or our children again.  It's not a reaction I'm proud of, but I felt I had to do something and fast.  That was the 1st thing that popped into my head.<br>  <br>  He was very apologetic, I believe sincerely.  He hasn't been physically harmful to me since then (about 1 1/2 years ago).  It was the one and only time.  He kept bringing it up in our conversations, trying to figure out why he did it.  He said he had been frustrated that I wasn't listening to him, but couldn't figure out why he shoved me.  Honestly, I think he was even more upset about it than I was.  Anyway, I too wanted nothing to do with him physically for a while.  I think it's just that I didn't feel I could trust him.  It's as if that one action changed who he was in my eyes, and I didn't know if I could trust this new person.  I think I needed time to feel comfortable and safe in our relationship again.  <br>  <br>  So I guess there's no definite answer to your question.  If he is sincerely sorry, it never will happen again.  Until you're confident that it won't, you both need to be patient.  Don't feel guilty if it takes a long time.  It might be frustrating for both of you, but it sounds like your relationship is important enough to you both that it will be worth the struggle to get past this.|`|PhYHZCy4aa	what he did was wrong, but you need to forgive him.<br>  you can't be mad at someone forever, especially someone you love..<br>  ask God to help you forgive him.<br>  God forgave everyone, even people who didn't love him and slapped him in his face.. I don't  know if you are even a christian or not, but even if you weren't you still need to forgive your husband.<br>  God would want you to forgive also...<br>  your husband loves you and said he was sorry.. he might never do it again... i really hope for your case he doesn't..|`|fef2399896e2e080792c38d047a07298aa	Hmmm. I'd be careful. But if this has never happend ever before, this could be a fluke incident. Especially now, everyone is really stressed out - with the economy being so bad.<br>  <br>  If he is being patient and being apologetic sincerly and really remorseful, then I'd accept his apology this time. If it happens ever again, then I'd leave. There is always 1 forgiveness, but never 2 times.<br>  <br>  Take the time and talk bout how you feel. Start slow. Just by hugging each other. Just so you feel his arms around you untill you feel comfortable. <br>  <br>  If he loves you enough, he will wait till you're ready again.<br>  <br>  PS. You're so lucky to get it every night! :) My hubby and I only have time on the weekends.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|kafQ6AJBaa	So sorry to hear that.This may be jumping the gun, but maybe you guys should get counseling.I mean, you did say that it was out of character for him.SO why now all of a sudden he up and hits you?Everyone knows the difference between right and wrong.I'm glad that you aren't backing down with the sex issue.Show him that what he did was wrong.Also, you need to sit down and have an heart to heart with him, and ask him how could he do such a thing.You are his wife, and that's the last person he should place his hands on.I'm sorry, but he could have easily punched a wall, kicjed a chair,or screamed to the top of his lungs.But no, he resorted to violence, and that's something you should never do.<br>  <br>  But you know what they say, usually the first hit leads to many more, so I hope that this doesn't become a pattern.Hope I could help a little, but stick to your guns.This is a serious issue, and you shouldn't take it lightly.
UgzKBiePaa	I'm in the same situation. I have two friends that I am confused on whither they like me or not. It would help if they gave me a sign to see if they did like me for more then just friends. I am also shy, I try and get over that shyness by being friends or making new friends. This helps my conversation skills and opens me up. That guy you described sounds like me, so if he is like me then giving him a sign that you like him for more then friends would benefit you greatly. Also make it a sign that is clear and easy to read, because I am not very good at getting hints and he might be the same way.|`|7FemzG2taa	My lady, if you paid more attention to him & giggle at corny jokes he will get the message.<br>  <br>  JPJ out to sail again the low seas.|`|D22DyVMOaa	Just make the first move. If he reacts he's interested if not, he only likes you as a friend.|`|bA8Hc4ecaa	Dont move in too fast especially if he's shy. Test him. I know all you girls test boys/men to see if they are "real men" NO! i know.. just look at him and smile, stare into his eyes just a second longer than you would with anyone else. If he likes you he will get the hint. BUT! if he's shy he might like you, but he might have trouble expressing it.|`|utP6jrPoaa	Well, to be honest, I guess that society is a bit different nowadays, but if he has been taught respect and chivalry, he will understand that it is wrong for the female to make the first move. I don't know, that's what I was always taught. I mean, it's nice knowing that someone has an interest in you. I mean, I guess you gotta know whether someone is interested, but I resent it when girls are so forward, so be careful if you do. Who knows, maybe he is just trying to see if what happens. Relationships take time you know.<br>  But again, that's just my own opinion. <br>  Another thing you might take into accout is whether or not he is just shy when he's around you. If that's the case, then he probably does like you.<br>  Who knows, maybe he is just trying to see if what happens. Relationships take time you know.|`|xMDPUd1Saa	Usually, you can tell... just follow your instincts. Like if you get that gut feeling that he likes you, then he does.  If you keep regreting the fact that he likes you, then he does.  Trust me on this.  Mostly you can tell by the way they look at you.. if they hold your stare.. they really do like you.. if they look away.. they're shy.  Just keep an eye on him and see how many times he might look at you. I've been researching for about 6 months about guys and their signals towards the girl they like. <br>  <br>  <br>  Okay here is a list:<br>  <br>  1. If he stares at you and keeps hold of it (shows his confidence) then he really likes you.<br>  2. If he stares at turns away, he likes you.<br>  3. If he remember everything about you EXample: "oh you got your braces off?"<br>  4. If he only talks to your friends and not to you...<br>  5. If his behavior all over changes... like he stops talking to you <br>  6. If he stares atyou from a distance..but when your close by, he won't even look at you. <br>  7. Look at his feet, are they pointing to you? If they are, that might be a sign....of body language.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't sleep with a guy, its not worth it!! Trust me.

Are you needy, clingy and demanding?  If so this is a big turn off for a guy.  It's a big turn off for a girl to have a guy act the same way.<br>  <br>  Guys like women who can think for themselves, take care of them selves and just be independent.  Not rely on anyone.  <br>  <br>  Im not excusing your ex-boyfriends behavior but he was being brutally honest.  And maybe that is what you needed. <br>  <br>  In the meantime what I found as a great substitute for feeling low is a gym membership and a nice pet like a dog or cat. Going to the gym is a good way to release stress and meet people.  Taking your frustrations out on a weight pile will or in an aerobics class will make you feel TONS better.   <br>  <br>  Dogs and cats love you unconditionally.  I have four cats and they know when I am down.  They come over, sit by me or on my lap and purr.

Reflect and see if everything he said are true. If it is, try to make some improvements and changes some characteristic flaws. If It's not, then really just forget about him. I know easier say than done, and I understand that you love him. But when it doesn't work out, you can't go crying your eye out everyday.

On peut même aller plus loin et dire, oui, la poésie est faite de mots, mais de quoi sont fait les mots? Les mots sont fait de sons, vibrations dans l'air. Donc nous trouvons que tout art a comme matière première, comme matériel de base des impressions sensorielles<br>  <br>  J'aime la poésie car elle me berce depuis ma plus tendre enfance. <br>  <br>  Paola Rially<br>  <br>  Bienvenu Alain bises.|`|y113MSnZaa	l'art se dévoile et s'apprécie !|`|zaajqjmMaa	merci d avoir spécifié le nom de l auteur ! trés peu le font...|`|bqFNlxTBaa	Indispensable à la vie, pourquoi ?|`|mGaelg0yaa	Je trouve le lard un peu trop gras, mais bon... c'est un point de vue....  mdr.<br>  <br>  Belle soirée a toi|`|ohflaJYpaa	Bonjour Alain, ta petite soeur est heureuse de te retrouver!!!<br>  <br>  J'aime l'art et j'y suis sensible, que ce soit par les mots ou la peinture ou toutes les expressions qu'il peut revêtir.<br>  Je me souviens en particulier de ce poème de Verlaine que j'ai appris il y a fort longtemps<br>  CHANSON D AUTOMNE<br>  Les sanglots longs <br>  Des violons<br>  De l'automne<br>  Blessent mon  coeur<br>  D'une langueur<br>  Monotone.<br>  Tout suffocant<br>  Et blême, quand<br>  Sonne l'heure,<br>  Je me souviens <br>  Des jours anciens <br>  Et je pleure;<br>  Et je m'en vais<br>  Au vent mauvais<br>  Qui m'emporte<br>  De?à, delà<br>  Pareil à la <br>  Feuille morte.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bises Alain <br>  Cathy

Oui, madame,<br>  Quant à vous, je ne vous invite pas, Zari.<br>  On entrera, dès que le ma?tre aura souri,<br>  A l'heure par exemple où se couchent les villes.<br>  A la porte on vendra des éventails des Iles <br>  Du temps qu'Athénasie était reine en riant. <br>  Un diplomate russe, un nonce d'Orient<br>  Viendront gris sans que l'on trouve ?a regrettable.<br>  Le d?ner, viande et fruits, écrasera la table. <br>  Je ne sais pas les noms de ce qu'on mangera, <br>  Ni quels vins couleront ni quels airs l'on jouera, <br>  Mais les glaces seront de Venise et des p?les. <br>  Des plats d'or voleront par-dessus les épaules, <br>  Sous de fiers lustres à cent mètres du plafond <br>  Qui sera comme un ciel d'indulgence sans fond,<br>  Où trembleront des seins, des lyres et des astres. <br>  Des rires crouleront comme de gros désastres. <br>  On entendra des cris d'oiseaux dans les hauteurs ;<br>  Il y aura des chefs d'offices, des auteurs, <br>  Des voyageurs parlant comme ceux-là du conte ; <br>  Nag la pale y sera, répondant au vieux comte :<br>  ? Change en or ton argent, ton or en perles, cher... ?<br>  Et les femmes seront des anges bien en chair, <br>  Nourris de moelles de boxeurs et de cervelles <br>  D'acrobates, disant des bêtises entre elles. <br>  Il y aura des gens sérieux quoiqu'en deuil, <br>  Quelque immense poète en un petit fauteuil, <br>  Et puis, sur une estrade en feutre, une féerie <br>  De musiciens blonds venus de Barbarie,<br>  En gilets frais ainsi que des pois de senteur.<br>  Autour de la maison, obscur comme le coeur,<br>  Le parc sera pompeux et la lune mignonne.<br>  Ah ! nous aurons aussi le monsieur dont personne<br>  Ne sait le petit nom ni le nom, croyez-vous,<br>  Et ce sera le plus délicieux de tous.<br>  Il y aura le diable : une humble enfant qui souffre<br>  Dira le reconna?tre à son odeur de soufre.<br>  Certes il y aura l'ami qu'on croyait mort,<br>  Le chien qui mord, et la bonne femme qui dort,<br>  Et plus d'un mendiant au bras de quelque dame,<br>  Mis avec toute la distinction de l'ame ;<br>  Et la musique aura tant d'influence, vrai,<br>  A la fête qu'après-demain je donnerai,<br>  Que l'on croira jouir d'une mort indicible,<br>  Et mourir plus longtemps qu'il ne semble possible,<br>  Dans une sorte d'aise et de grace, humblement.<br>  Quant au bal, qui sera rose admirablement,<br>  Il entra?nera tout nous tous : danseurs sceptiques,<br>  Filles graves roulant des prunelles mystiques,<br>  Et chacune - je vous inviterai, Zari, -<br>  Trouvera son valseur, son ange et son mari.<br>  Bref, tout ce monde, armé de ses plus jolis vices,<br>  De salle en salle ira tournant avec délices,<br>  Dans un vaste froufrou de coeurs et de chiffons,<br>  Dans mon chateau, mon bon vieux chateau des Bouffons<br>  Qu'avoisine une mer verte et gaie au possible,<br>  Suivre vers la folie une pente insensible,<br>  Ou vers le crime qui, ce soir-là, sera roi,<br>  Jusqu'à ce qu'apparaisse, après le souper froid,<br>  Le matin bête dans la cohue étonnée.<br>  Hélas ! personne à la fête que j'ai donnée  <br>   <br>  Germain Nouveau  1854/1920   <br>  <br>  " Pas mal hein! " <br>  <br>  <br>  Bisous Paola.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS : J'ae Ma Puce qui se reconna?tra...?

Even though I'm happily married i would still be a refreshing change lol|`|gclk5qijaa	Strong confident women are very much a turn on ;-)|`|o8Ouoa2Jaa	for sure. ask him out. sometimes guys can't see the signs that a girl likes them. so do it. you may be very suprised.|`|tAWxgBosaa	Well, from a woman's perspective, if a man invited me out to eat or to a movie, I would actually accept that as a date (that is beyond a hint). A hint would be if he asked if I had seen a certain movie because he would obviously be asking to see how I respond to see whether or not to actually ask me to a movie.<br>  <br>  Right now I like this guy I volunteer with at this human rights organization. I keep thinking he is going to ask me out, but he doesn't for some reason. I think he is going to though (just my gut feeling). However, if he invited me to the movies or to dinner, I would be so happy to go. I am actually hoping he will. I can't bring myself to ask him because I am very shy about that type of stuff.

UrgsYz94aa	If he has apologized, that should be enough.  Don't make him pay for a mistake.  Don't linger on it either.  If you want to get serious with him, tell him about your feelings.  If he feels the same, no use in wasting time.  Life is short enough as it is!|`|lfE9X6Jnaa	Wow!! how can he forget someone he really likes...If he really liked u he would be thinking about you all the time and wouldnt be able to wait til the next date!?! Well i think that writing a song is too personal because he prob might feel shy about it if he hasnt known u for that long...i would say have him take u to ur fav restuarant and order the most expensive dish..lol!
RL9wZs3Iaa	I kind of had (or have, actually) that too. I nowadays find that I spend less time playing video games then I used to (month-2 months ago) I think it is because you are now involved with someone and you spend more time around her instead of playing any old game. Somehow in the process, you lose the need to play video games to keep happy and it instead transfers over to your need to be with your girlfriend. I don't believe that it has anything to do with your gf's disapproval of games.|`|Po1S4R6kaa	juss cause she dont like video games dont mean s**t.....u need to grow some major balls and do wut u want to do.... u might like her but u dont need to go by wut she wants u to do...k??? i am a grl and if i told my bf wut to do i wouldnt want him to be a pussy and not do wut he wants.....so she may not like it but who cares??? if she has a life she can get over it...|`|t5Zq9CThaa	aaahhhhh....behold the power of female persuasion.<br>  Just be yourself, and don't settle for anybody's BS.<br>  if you like games, play games. If she can't deal with it, she's not worth your time....besides, there are worse things you could be doing with your time.|`|U1tNHeqGaa	i think you grew some balls dude<br>  and your in love with her and not games

zPWpivOzaa	It isn't that complicated, you just have to develop an eff-it attitude (i.e. nonchalant). You are complicating it, that is the worst thing you can do as you'll come off as unnatural.|`|8NIoRMrEaa	just pretend like he's not there.....that always works for me|`|Lq7dFeJAaa	How does he know that your 'friend' was telling the truth anyway?  Just be friendly, fun and look really cute.  Be the nice person you are.  Your heart may pound a little harder at first, but it will get better.  Be like an actress if you have to at first but be cool.  So he didn't reciprocate your feelings.  Next!  Look for another guy at the party.  Don't damage your life cause of a guy.  (you can still look at him and enjoy his looks though ;-)|`|P5QgZn7Paa	Treat him like hes your dad.|`|PSV578tYaa	Trust me, I was in the same exact situation as you. First I just tryed not to look at him and pretend like he is never there. But it did not work out so well because almost everyday he would come up to me and ask me a question. So then I just told him that "I could not talk to him because me throat was sore." That was the dumbest exuse I had ever made. So after that awkward day of not talking to him I went strait up to him and I said "Do you want to go out to get some pizza, as a friend?" And then he said sure and now we are best friends and nothing more!!! <33 =]|`|ae2de9ccef4109177673c61d99023de7aa	if you really are "over" him, then there shouldnt be a problem. dont be a jerk, and dont feel like you need to do anything for anyobody or anything, just go to the party and have fun...that would serve everybody best!|`|b8431b2ae8db8c34535f6d08f83ce70baa	Well once that kinda happened to me but I just told him instead; still wonder why or how I'd gotten the courage to do that; but anyways, I just tried to tell myself he didn't know or anything and just try to forget about it and just act like he was just another of my friends or something.|`|t7qTlhIuaa	as a guy, if i were in your situation, i'd think the girl was over me if she went up to me with another guy (maybe you could get a 'fake' date) and just be like hey whats up. or if fake dates are stupid and complicated, just be normal and dont look fazed... talk to him but not too much, and look like you're having fun adn dont let him catch you staring at him... <br>  <br>  i hope that helped!! will you plz go answer my question? its called 'cant decide!'|`|S4KAcas7aa	It doesn't sound like he's an EX crush.  Just be yourself.  And don't be dramatic.  These things have a way of working out.  Just smile real big!!
W02kTOqmaa	No, it makes her a bad friend for not understanding that you are having a tough time right now and you need to get things done this weekend!<br>  <br>  Tanya, it isn't even her best friends wedding, it is her best friends SISTERS wedding! You shouldnt have to be obligated to your friend's siblings. While I know it sucks not being able to go, I also know how much moving sucks. We had to be out of one apartment in 24 hours! We packed and moved EVERYTHING in 6 hours. Not easy, not fun. I just moved in to my current place, and we had 1 full month to move and Im exhausted! not only that, but besides moving, you have to find an apartment as well! Im sorry, that's very tough, your friend should be understanding|`|mu4ERrUoaa	Sorry but you've been invited to a wedding and you can't go because your too tired? I've heard this before and you sound like a real party pooper. Of course she's going to be annoyed! It's her sister happiest day of her life and she wants her best friend there. You are never to tired to do something you want to do.

Try staying for about an hour and then you can leave, she can't get mad at that. Even at reception or an before/after party would be good. If it's absolutely impossible I would call your friend and tell her instead of just not showing up, it doesn't make you a bad friend just a very busy one. It isn't your fault that the landlord did that to you at this timing. Just explain it all to your friend and if she is as close as you say she is, she'll understand. But if you can, do try going. I wish you luck with finding a place and with the wedding situation, don't get stressed about it(:

Fkl6gV8Qaa	I think that he has probably learned the hard way that falling too fast is not the best idea. I wouldn't worry too much until he starts talking babies and carpools with you. Enjoy your relationship. There are not many men who would take full custody of a baby. I can't even get my ex to take his 5 year old daughter without pawning her off on his mom.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Personally, I would never seriously date someone with a child; having a kid from a previous relationship would be an automatic deal-breaker before the door is even open. But it is strictly my personal choice, and it's not at all a "rule of thumb" that everyone must follow. If you are happy with a guy and don't mind him having a baby, then the baby is not the problem here. Assuming I was ok with dating a single parent, what would bother me in the situation you describe would be that he seems to be the type of guy who rushes into things without thinking it through, and because of it makes bad choices that affect not only himself, but other people. This is a very dangerous trait, and I would be on the lookout for potential problems in our relationship. Also, it sounds like he might still be "on the rebound", and this carries its own set of problems. Be careful and be prepared that this isn't gonna last. |`|pKzH1cFHaa	People will do crazy/stupid stuff when they think they are/are in love. As for this question, of course someone would date someone with a baby. How do you think step-families are made? With a wand? Same goes for the questions do guys/girls date fat, skinny, blonds, brunettes, red heads, etc. Yes, people do. Date this guy if you like him and aren't bothered by him having a baby, but if he asks for a baby before you have been together for two years and say I do, get out of the relationship because he hasn't learned and it may take him a long time before he learns.|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	I'd wonder why he was sleeping with someone without protection if he didn't know " who she really was "<br>  A responsible, professional stand up kind of guy wouldn't purposefully strive to impregnate a woman he'd know only 120 days-- he'd care more about the future of the baby than his own infatuation.<br>  I'd move on.<br>  It's not the baby that's a problem- it's his lack of character. |`|HPAcASpOaa	I say stay with him he sound like a great guy, Its makes him sound even better with a kid because he sounds like a great guy. i think he is just hinting that you should get on the pill i guess or something like that|`|aEpPt9koaa	I wouldn't date a guy with a baby and I have a daughter. When I think of guys with kids, I think of baby mama drama. You will have to accept that he will always have to communicate with another woman (the child's mother). Plus some women can act real immature (especially when they still have feelings for the father) and try to use the child to get to spend more time with father. And the fact that he purposely got a woman pregnant he has known for four months does suggest there is something wrong with his brain. We are talking about a child here, not adopting a puppy. You don't plan a pregnancy with someone you have only dated four months. But you got to do you. If you can deal with it then great. I'm sure he's a good guy, it says a lot being that he is taking care of his responsibilities as a father. I just know I couldn't do it.|`|ehAG30Yvaa	You have to decide if your willing to take on the baggage of someone who has a child. The child will always come first in his life and that can be a hard thing to deal with sometimes when your dating and trying to get to know each other. My husband was a single dad when I met him and there we're days when I was SO over everything that came along with dating a single dad. Mostly his ex because they still deal with each other because of their son. That is still hard to this day but we're married now and I've chosen to accept that she will always be in our lives because of their child. These are all things to be considered but initially it shouldn't be about the child, it should be about you & him getting to know each other and finding out if you're a good match for each other. You said you just started dating so hopefully he's keeping his son away because you really have no business being around him. Kids get attached very quickly and if things don't work out the child could get hurt. When you spend time with him to start make sure it's alone time where you can talk and get to know each other without the distractions of his child. Hopefully he's open and honest with you about things and if you decide to continue the relationship into a more serious one, then you'll know what he wants. You are in control of your body so you can't get pregnant unless you have unprotected sex...regardless of what he wants. I doubt he wants another baby right now anyway. Just be open minded and realistic about your expectations when dating a single dad. It's tough but a child can definitely change someones life for the better. If he's a good dad you'll see that and it's a testament to his true character. It's one of the things I love most about my husband...what a great dad he is! <br>  <br>  Hope things work out for you!|`|ft2r5gxPaa	Everyone makes mistakes. The wonderful thing about this guy is, he took care of his responsibility and is being a good dad. There are so many men that would just have walked away. That shows he is not just another self centered creep. He's doing what he should be doing raising his child. I think he deserves a chance. Just take it slow and see how it goes. It is really hard to come by good, genuine men now a days that are responsible. Good luck.|`|pma90Xycaa	I would continue with him.  People can learn from their mistakes.  Take it on faith that he learned from his mistake with this other woman and give him a chance.  Don't throw it in his face that he had a baby with her ever.  Either accept him and his little responsibility as they are or else move on.|`|788a038f5541dbc6f3da4714cefecd6caa	Well, everyone has moments where they rush into things. I would think that it would be fine to date him if you have feelings for him. I would take it slowly though! :) But I dont think you have anything to worry about in terms of him and his ex planning this. |`|AA11657908	People make stupid mistakes. Just watch out for signs he's trying to repeat the same mistake with you by talking about marriage/kids too soon.|`|c222262ec43d3e2ededcf13c811e2412aa	It is definitely a red flag and I would not date this guy no matter how cute he is or how much money he has...|`|c49338b3d5ebb5c9906b129d1efe4208aa	I would not date someone with a child; too much drama.|`|AA12187979	<br>  No.|`|bpjpD7W3aa	leave--start off life with a clean plate, you don't need this baby baggage-<br>    let the only baby in your life be your baby,|`|p5OPYtdFaa	Give him a chance, I mean, why mess up something that could turn out to be great?

But my advice would be to let your friend know what has been going on. In the first place they are too young to get married if they dont understand the vows they took. Marriage is serious and all you see is making out-what is she came up pregnant with someother guys baby and he thought it was his? Situations get worse after time so letting him know now could greatly help. They will either work past issues and save their marriage or they will have to let it go. But being a good friend is letting him know what it is you know. Here say isnt good but what it is you saw.

But these are the usual signs that a girl likes you but you should talk to her more and hang out with her and get to no her more then it will probably become more clear.

But like a girl looking at you, I mean like that is so blan, that could man so many things.|`|nNez1t56aa	Of course! No girl will let a guy copy her homework unless they are either long time friends or she has a major crush on the guy.

Stop drinking - i'm sure it isn't helping you one bit. and no wonder you got dumped - you had three girls in one week. that's about a two-day relationship for each. lay off the girls for a while and figure yourself out - get healthy and then maybe try dating again. if you're scared of commitment, don't date until you see a therapist or a counselor or talk to a close friend.

If you want to go out go out by yourself or with a friend. I wouldn't make an issue out of it. Besides the food you get out at these places is not that healty for you. You are better off eating at home. I know for me I hate hearing screaming kids while I am eating or seeing people with their nasty manners. I would much rather eat at home. <br>  <br>  Also with the movies I would rather be at home and watch a good movie in the comfort of my chair without my feet sticking to the floor or other people around annoying the heck out of me. How can you enjoy with all that noise anyways. <br>  <br>  I understand where he is coming from and maybe you should be a little more considerate and stop bugging him about it. If you continue he may think you are nagging and get upset at you.|`|4RgXh3ftaa	having a husband that doesnt want to do much will break down in the long run. He needs to know that it's O.k for him not to enjoy things with you but at the same time he cant be selfish and think about what he doesnt want to do and think about you, trust me my husband was similur at one time and I was more the adveturas person and I found myself leading a different path, so now he's my ex-husband. Just talk to him and tell him he needs to be open minded to your feeling too:)

asAWGIgnaa	i think you should talk to her, support her and try to find out whats going on. i think she obviously is screaming out for help, and i think her family should know what she is going through, go to her family and tell them, but dont let them kick off ect because it might push her over the edge. all you can do is be there for her and talk to her family.

Later,if you see her alone somewhere or not doing much just go up to her and start a convo.If you know what she is really into try to work it in.For example something like "Hey, what's up?Listen, my friend got wrestling practice on Friday so he's a no show for the Lakers game.I got an extra ticket here  if you are up for it.I know how you love that Kobe " Something of that nature...subtle way of asking her out but she will get the message if she likes you.|`|7zGFvmbSaa	just be comfortable and talk to her, start off with talking to her as a friend and then work your way up and see how it goes.|`|WTNrSY0eaa	that easy this may seem simple but just say hi ask how she doing and general question  to get the conversation going<br>  and trow a joke or two|`|q9lJK2UJaa	just go up to her and say "hi". start a converstaion about anything that you think might be interesting to herself and you. get to know her better and then ask her. <br>  <br>  good luck :).|`|sZhw4Zhiaa	Ask her if she wants to go for a coffee or something.|`|vjnVrlnBaa	pretty much anything and everything that doesn't have to do with genitalia should be fine. <br>  try to find out if she's into any specific type of music/ art/ athletics, and bring that up. try not to seem too nervous or too cocky. <br>  good luck.  :]|`|w5O6e8YAaa	just go up to her and say "hi" don't get nurvios it's just a word...|`|xJH6Me5naa	ask her about something you know the answer to, and if you think she likes you back, make it obvious. she'll take a hint. make lame excuses as to why you need to talk to her.

(And 2 other crimes as well ). Now since he had a girlfriend He is either bi-sexual/bi curious or Straight .<br>  <br>   he is not straight ,  else he wouldn't  have come to you. So he is Bi-sexual.<br>  <br>  Now, your concern is that if you file a police complaint, he may Rape or kill you. <br>  <br>  <br>  Right ? <br>  <br>  <br>  I Would say You and Amit .....

FHxZx4Thaa	If my 17 yr old took off for the night, she would come home to much worse situation than when she left. She would have a bed, sheets and a few clothes. The rest would be gone.|`|HSe2baBaaa	i woul dbe really pissed off, but i think you should do it, espiciallie since they say that kind of stuff to you|`|AA11585161	I'd be pretty pissed.  But on the other hand I'd be extremely pissed if I was you and had to live with being told this stuff.  Try sitting down with the folks and in a mature and open minded manner inform them of how what they have been saying to you makes you feel and think about life in general.  A good family conversation most certainly would not do this relationship any harm and it appears that it would probably benefit from some form of family or relationship counseling.  Best of luck.|`|K3NsxWW5aa	Let them know that you can be trusted I had the same problems with my parents,Earn there trust by telling them where you be,studiying for school,what time youll be home by....and so on  Just make sure they know you should be respected as an adult...Make sure that they know your responsble|`|AA11249896	Hmmmm...there's always two sides to every story and we're just hearing yours.  Why did they take your cell phone?  You don't say so I have to assume you're being punished for something and they knew that this would probably carry the greatest weight with you.<br>  <br>  I have a 16 year old stepdaughter who has done this (not come home) and I will tell you it makes a parent CRAZY with worry.  It's a stupid thing to do.  What will you accomplish by not coming home?  Teach them a lesson?  hardly.  All you'll do is show that you are as irresponsible as they claim.  Take the high road.  Come home.  Follow the rules.  <br>  <br>  Treat them with respect, even if they don't do the same for you.  If you want to be treated like an adult, then really, truly act like one, even if you think you're being treated unfairly.  |`|XaNvKroGaa	Hmmm if I was your mom by the sounds of it not at all! Is tough growing up in a household like that-I went through something similar but, was quite badly mentally&physically abused. Theres no winning with parents like that you'll always piss them off with something so I'd start saving if you can afford it in case you need to leave but, and i know as the mom of a teenager i sjhouldnt say this but yeah id stay out too!lol. That experience with my family made me a great mom&I have a great relationship with my fifteen yr old son. GOOD LUCK&BE CAREFUL.xx|`|RBsCBjWtaa	hahahah I think that is GREAT I'm 20. I think that if you pay for it and your working they should have no control over your phone. your almost an adult so if they called the cops they would just come tell you to go home or something, haha i think you should do it. I know I dont give the best advice but if my child was paying for it them selves and taking care of them selves then I wouldnt take their phone. also I know for a fact I will never say anything like that to my child that is the worst thing you can do out side of beating them is telling them basically you dont nor did you want them I think your parents need to go learn how to be parents....|`|Uk1PckNBaa	Very pissed. But if you do that they'll just retaliate. You don't want them firing back at you, do you? Could get messy and stressful.<br>  Just make sure you move out of the house soon. <br>  Parents are human and can lack perception at times like everybody else. It's your responsibility to be gracious and put up with them. You should learn to tolerate their occasional stupidity because they love you and care about you like nobody else in the world.  That's a rare and precious gift. <br>  I want to absolutely strangle my parents for their blindness and idiocy( and mine are wayyyy wayy worse), but I never show it. It's my gift for them. |`|rvHf4nALaa	I would sit down and talk with your mom first.. she doens't need to say those things to make you feel unloved thus making you feel that you don't want me to exist right now...hOWEVER parents are your parents and they will always be there no matter what they love you..and in the end if you aren't married and not looking yet...THEY WILL ALWAYS support you.. Maybe they took your cell phone to help themselves find some control over you cuz at this point I just think they are lost.. and yeah you are almost 18..but its a lonely road if you don't have them in your life. I wouldn't make your mom sad..I would go home.. and apologize...say I am sorry for making you sad.. AT 17 she will think you have matured 10 years..you might get a small lecture...and a disbelief.. but have fun..roll with the punches...but always keep your family close.. specially if they are still together.. You guys are on the same team..You reaching your highest potential someday..but i think your mom like mine...says things to make you hurt so you feel the way you made her feel..It happens.. but It will get better..

If you like her, you should try to be him.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	It means she is depressed and passive because she is waiting around for someone to come and "rescue" her, and nothing has happened.

XAw4cJmjaa	I spent over two years waiting on a guy to come back to me. He came back, then left again. It's not easy saying good-bye to someone you care about, and it's even harder to let that person go. Letting go means that you move on with your life, not letting their memory hurt or make you cry. Some would say to give it time. Others may not completely understand and say get over it.  I say, if you're really ready to move on, write a letter as if you were going to give it to him. You may cry and your heart may race and feels like you are gonna die, but put all that holding on feelings down on paper. You may not ever give it to him, or you may decide to. That's up to you. Keep your head up and believe that you will be ok.|`|TyLBzdOnaa	You don't have to "let go" try to accept it. <br>  <br>  you will never forget your past you just can't unless you have like severe brain trauma. <br>  <br>  I had a bad experience once and thing was that it wasn't even an official relation but boy did I love her. We spent time talking about our "future" getting married having a family spending our time together. I was dumb and naive, I mean she had a bf at the time I guess you could say I was the other guy O_o<br>  but why would she tell me these things she really lead me on and I really did feel "love" with her and fought for her by talking to her bf about how we would talk about this and make love. wasn't the brightest idea we didn't fight guy told me he was happy I told him the truth they had their lil fight but they ended up staying together and she stopped talking to me just like that. I guess I expected for them to break up and we'd be together. <br>  <br>  Any ways after a year long of psychiatry visits and anti depressants and near suicidal occasions I am doing much better. take it from me that time will only make the hurting stop. <br>  <br>  my advice would be if you need to go to a psychiatrist by all means go to one. or if you don't then try to keep occupied by keeping busy. make yourself a support group, keep a schedule of your things and fit in activities that will distract you. learn new activities like joga, canoeing exorcise. <br>  <br>  Yeah I still think about her from time to time. but now I am moving on I have a crush on this girl and just moving forward. <br>  <br>  So, just let time run its course and keep moving on.|`|CoesNKmPaa	time will heal.<br>   there really isnt anything you can do about it at the moment, but you'll get over it. <br>  <br>  take care and be strong|`|ZOXP3HKlaa	Well its not something that just happens hun. the only way you can truly get over some one is being with some one else better then them and treats you better. or you have to really really be so mad at them that you dont want to talk to them any more. but dont go sleepin around to see if its different bc it will just ruin your chances with other guys bc u will start attracting idiots

A female who is not into the relationship is not worth keeping.  However love is hard to come by(unless you fall in love easily).  Have you ever just flat out asked her what her problem is?  If not then do it, and not nicely.  Women need to be called out when they get that attitude.  If you let them run over you and avoid arguments when they cop an attitude it makes them move further away.  Ask her what her problem is and have as much attitude as she does.  If she has no answer then let her go, time will heal all pain.|`|ViKhxSQFaa	It depends, did you both mutually brake up? or was it one person in the relationship? Sometimes people feel that they were betrayed by the one they loved and they do everything to push that source out of their life. When my first gf broke up with me, I completely stopped talking to her. When I broke up with second gf, she completely stopped talking to me. It's a way to ease the pain and move on, especially when you still love someone. But whether to let her go or not is your decision, if it felt right then you did the right thing. Everything relationship is different so I can't tell you, it's something you should know.
VHp086UWaa	It is bad that you had a friend tell her that you are interested in her.  Women like confidence and that shows a lack of.  However you are on the right path if you can tell her how you feel face to face.  Actually don't do it with words, do it with a kiss.  A deep, sensual kiss will tell her how you fell about her.  If you aren't in a position to kiss then just tell her how you feel.  If you can tell a woman face to face how you feel it shows confidence.  The gift cards are OK, no big deal.

AA12296157	If you both like each other, what's the problem?  Could it be that you're too young to know what to do next?  Look, I think you young people are too interested in hooking up and being in relationships and not interested enough in growing up, getting educated so that you can compete with other kids from other countries.  Why do you think so many items in our stores are "Made in China" or Made in Mexico?  What are our people doing?  Trying to get boyfriends and girlfriends.  Most of you can't read, spell correctly or write coherent sentences.  If you can't figure out what to say and do with a girlfriend, that means you're not mature enough to have one.

QUrRNzuIaa	Ciao Clarissa...ascoltami, ho 32 anni e di questioni come le tue ne ho vissute tantissime, e ogni tanto mi capitano pure oggi... però con l'esperienza oltre ad aver imparato a fregarmene (credimi è stata dura) ho imparato anche che chi non mi comprende, è perchè non ha voglia di conoscermi...perchè è facile stare vicino alle persone in modo superficiale, ma è quando si va oltre a questo che ci si deve mettere in gioco... e tu lo sai fare, ti rendi disponibile, ti apri agli altri con il tuo cuore.... tu ci sei, le atre persno invece non ne sono capaci: è un loro limite! <br>  In questo momento magari ti senti sola, ti sembra di vagare nel nulla e di andare verso un periodo di solitudine ... beh magari accadrà...un piccolo periodo in cui stare da sola e parlare a te stessa...però prima o poi ci saranno persone che vorranno aprirsi con te, condividere con te i loro pensieri... viverti e volerti bene!<br>  Non ti preoccupare di chi ti disprezza, di quel ragazzo che non è interessato a te... sono persone sfortunate, loro non sanno leggere al di là di quello che voglio vedere... e credimi rimarranno ottuse così per sempre! Mentre tu vedrai cose che solo in pochi possono vedere!<br>  Un bacione grande... e su di morale, pensa che di persone come te ce ne vorrebbero tante, e sii orgogliosa di come sei!<br>  E quando qualcuno ti umilia, pensa dentro di te.... che lui non può capire e vedere quello che capisci tu, voltati di spalle e fatti un sorriso grande! Tu sai perchè...lui non lo saprà mai!|`|41FJOPrwaa	vedi,quando andavo alle superiori per me era la stessa cosa... e ci stavo male. però piano piano col tempo ho capito una cosa... non devi piacere agli altri, devi piacere a te stessa! se gli altri ti prendono in giro o ti umiliano come dici tu non è tua la colpa, casomai sono loro a non capirti... quindi non sei tu ad essere in difetto ma loro. ti faccio una domanda... qual'è la cosa più importante della tua vita? quando troverai la vera e unica risposta credimi che prenderai tutto come un gioco ;D|`|VjgDNkgbaa	ti capisco è capitato anke a me alle medie...e da qst esperienza ho imparato ke con certe persone non devo essere gentile,ma devi rendergli(per quanto puoi)pan per focaccia!non disperare e dedicati allo studio dimostrando loro ke sei più brava di loro e se la situazione in classe è drammatica parlane con un prof ke ti possa capire o per lo meno col quale tu ti possa sfogare...cmq se vuoi contattami sn disponibile per parlare dei tuoi problemi...|`|cbc84369a171d872d8458deb909c6976aa	sii sempre te stessa|`|xIMO0JAyaa	perche ,usando parole tue....'ti impegni per piacere'.............<br>  io lo trovo irritante...e anonimo....scusa sii come ti piaci a te....se a loro va bene,bene,se no al diavolo mandali a cagheeeeer...cè sempre la classe accanto,o un ragazzo piu bello....e tiiira fuori un po di grrrinta dio santo....belin se non lo fai ora....mi incazzo e vengo a tirartela fuoriio...ciao|`|6tVrCk9Daa	mi spiace, vedrai che passerà anche questo brutto periodo... se ti va io sono qui, mandami una mail che ti do il mio contatto messenger, così se ti va possiamo chiacchierare|`|AHtjwigdaa	mi dispiace per come ti senti. succede che non ci si senta apprezzati e parte del mondo che abbiamo intorno, e può essere pesante da affrontare, ma non cambiare il tuo modo di essere gentile, non voler essere diversa (e poi come? iniziando anche tu a prendere in giro gli altri?).vedrai che alla fine ti ripagherà e ti farà sentire bene con te stessa (il che dà una forza enorme). non smettere di cercare le tue grandi amiche, di voler condividere il tuo tempo con loro, anzi chiedi loro di starti vicina in questo momento delicato. ciao|`|bR8GWyFnaa	Ciao,<br>  mi sembri veramente disperata.<br>  Vedrai che prima o poi trovi chi ti vuole veramente bene.<br>  Sii però sempre te stessa.<br>  Se hai bisogno di un supporto scrivimi pure.<br>  Un abbraccio|`|0lLXZBMPaa	non impegnarti x piacere agli altri...risulti poco credibile,non vera....<br>  vestiti come ti piace,esci e stattene x conto tuo...<br>  rispondi se ti parlano...educata e gentile ma mai servile ,e poi estraniati dal gruppo,non esigere di farne parte...<br>  in questo modo,oltre ad essere te stessa che è la cosa migliore,creerai intorno a te un alone di  mistero che incuriosirà sia le ragazze che i ragazzi che cominceranno a cercarti più spesso...<br>  attenta a non sembrare superba,sii solo superiore quando ti prendono in giro..guardali e vai x la tua strada...fai capire che non attacca quel comportamento ma che se ti parlano gentilmente tu ci sei...<br>  sono loro alla fine che si sentiranno m.e.r.d.e......<br>  quelli un pò fuori dal coro,che stanno sulle loro attizzano da matti......prova e dicci come va tra una paio di settimane...nel frattempo noi siamo qui se vuoi....baci e auguri di cuore...te li meriti...

AA10591673	Wow. Ok. Just confront them and tell her that you still love her even though she breaks up with you (grls always fall for that) and go with the flow.
wHgBnMipaa	I guess they kiss just like a boy and a girl would kiss.  It's really not sexy, though, I don't think.  Maybe a perverted guy watching it would get turned on, but I don't really think it is something you should be trying if you're not a lesbian.  Why would you want to do that if you are straight?
YG9ZLFMfaa	If you feel comfortable with it, go ahead.<br>  If you feel you shouldn't or you feel guilty, then have him stop.<br>  <br>  ** Spoiler Alert**  All boys are going to try this with you.|`|53fb280ff7bc054d5cb4da6f2dfe04b5aa	i think you should let him, at first when my guy wanted to do that, i didn't let, but now its ok, it feel really good, if you are not comfortable with that then you may say no|`|7c25bbaa1925ddeec4cb62a284be37ffaa	If your not comfortable about it then first then give him the signal by pushing his hands off when he tries to go up at them, if he still does it then say stop and if he still does it then i would like tell him to back off and just walk off.
BnVIKi8Aaa	If I were you sweety, I would just tell that boy and your friends the truth and tell them please don't bother me with that anymore, if they are your friends they have to understand you hon.  Just talk to that boy and tell him that he is a wonderful person, but I just don't see us together, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings, but I don't want to lie to you, that's all.  That's all you gotta say to him sweety, because it is your decision and no one else can make it for you.  And if he doesn't respond to that, you just have to get mad, because it will be out of line already.<br>  OK?<br>  good luck honey<br>  much love and respect|`|CxALUsLYaa	how cud u allow him to hug u??????????<br>  <br>  just kip formal distance and try to manke him understand ur fealings for him every time he is wit u thts all.|`|JvynDBPNaa	Tell him straight out<br>  That you are NOT INTERESTED<br>  You dont want him to get the wrong idea<br>  <br>  Be honest with him...no matter what he will be a little hurt....but its better to be honest than fake|`|YzF6ArdMaa	1st of all if your friends were real friends they wouldn't think you are a *****. so if you want him off you just say I don't mean 2 hurt you but GO AWAY!!! and I'm sure he'll get the picture!

Votre père se balade main dans la main avec la nouvelle ?) et les témoignages.<br>  <br>  Concernant le domicile familial, ?a dépend à qui il appartient mais il peut lui être attribué même s'il appartient en propre à votre père (en contrepartie d'un loyer)<br>  <br>  Votre mère devra aussi exiger une prestation compensatoire en sus de sa part de la communauté<br>  <br>  PS : il existe 4 sortes de divorces (il y a aussi la demande acceptée)|`|6df8878ab252b293b25d6f006e38dcc7aa	Un divorce à l'amiable donne les mêmes garanties qu'un divorce pour faute, c'est simplement une question de délai plus court et éviter les affrontements, c'est tout !|`|1be43ee8c159d1918304de0efcc8b27caa	prends un rendez vous avec un avocat, c'est le mieux<br>  <br>  Mon divorce a duré un an et m'a co?té environ 4000 €|`|3MkjLenXaa	Tu peux toujours utiliser l'adultère comme faute pour demander le divorce.

JdB5Ofnnaa	First think first, relax ;-).  When you call be yourself... The hardest part is done, you have her number. Just have casual conversation and let it flow... (Hi, how are u? What are you doing? How was your day?) Based on these responses, let the conversation take a life of its own.  I know it is easier said then done (I was there too at one time).  I wish you all the best! I have a feeling you will do just fine!|`|FyV6HhGXaa	ask whut her hobbies. let her talk about herself.|`|OK5AR0cPaa	ask questions about her and listen.|`|ULNIDEAZaa	Find out everything you can about her... pets, friends, idea of fun, etc...

AH....!|`|d6ae1a9abc001723d2951a5162d5a014aa	just start up a conversation by asking her what she likes to do for fun on the weekends, ask her about her family, how her classes are going.  Compliment her on her hair, clothes, personality, etc.  Maybe offer to buy her lunch or to sit at the same lunch table.  Talk about what she watches on tv or what kind of music she listens to, and if yall watch the same shows or listne to the same music, yall can talk about that.  Just ask her questions to see if yall have something in common, and if so, the conversation should be a breeze!!|`|wF244FP4aa	Good bye|`|xEu84S8Eaa	if you share any subjects wiht her, say for example,<br>  "wasn't the lecture so boring? i almost fell asleep."<br>  or<br>  "why does the teacher have to give us so much homework?"<br>  <br>  you should probably call her 3-7 days after she gave you her number.<br>  just act normal to her<br>  act as if she was just one of your other friends.<br>  once you guys get closer, she might consider you.|`|reC0vweUaa	Hey dude, been there done that, thank gawd those days are over lol<br>  <br>  If you can than talk to her in person that would be best, try talking to her away from the crowd.  If that's to hard than call her for sure and ask her if she wants to chat for a bit. Something like " hey it's (your name) you got time to chat for a bit?" if she is interested she will chat and if she tells you she does not have time right now than ask her if she wants to chat later?  That way you will know if she is interested.<br>  <br>  Don't worry to much about what to chat about, I'm sure she is nervous also. Just tell her "hey I am a bit shy and chatting with girls is tough, what bout you? chatting with guys that is" from here you are on your own :-)
G9vY0cqraa	It's good to hear that you have spotted the scammers no1demon<br>  <br>  It didn't cost you anything to join the dating site ...and It doesn't cost the scammers anything as well. That's why they do it.<br>  <br>  Date site scammers tend to work like this:-<br>  <br>  *They get your email by joining dating sites , singles groups, or social sites such as Myspace and write to you pretending to be the kind of person you are looking for.<br>  <br>  *The pictures they send and the ones in their profile are always good-looking, and are usually taken from modeling sites on the<br>  Internet.<br>  <br>  *They may claim to be working abroad, often in Nigeria<br>  <br>  *Make no mistake, a love scammer will usually have several victims going at once, both male and female, and may be "engaged" to more than 10 victims at a time. They think of you as a "job", not a person.<br>  <br>  *These scammers are willing to spend months talking and writing every day to their victims before asking for money. The relationships they have with their victims often start fast and are very intense.<br>  <br>  *The scammer may try to make the victim feel like they are joining a new family, and may introduce other scammers as their mother, father, sister, etc. This is to make the victim feel a responsibility toward their "new family".<br>  <br>  *The bottom line is that they want you to care for them so that you will send them your money.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  When they finally ask for money, it is usually for one of these reasons: <br>  <br>  *They need to pay for a visa, plane tickets, marriage license etc to<br>  come be with you.<br>  <br>  *A close relative suddenly becomes very ill and needs money for medicine<br>  and doctors.<br>  <br>  *They are rich, but they can't get their money right now and need your <br>  help<br>  <br>  *They are somehow stuck without funds in a foreign country (usually somewhere in Africa or Europe) and need you to wire funds so they can get home.<br>  <br>  *They need you to cash a check or checks and send them cash via Western Union. The check or money order they will send you is fake, even if your bank cashes the check or tells you that it "cleared"!!!! The bank will find out in a few days or weeks that the check is fake, and will make you pay all of the money back, even the money you sent to the scammer.<br>  The bank might even have you arrested for cashing a bad check.<br>  <br>  *They need you to receive packages that cannot be sent directly to them, and send them on. The packages will contain goods paid for with stolen credit card numbers, and the person the police will come after for theft is you!|`|53b1575c73e52f1219345cc93d409168aa	The Internet provides anonymity and allows the scum bags to ply their trade with little fear of repercussions.|`|GQJtokj0aa	Because its an easy scam everyone wants love and some at any price.

srhyNr9Eaa	the simple thing is write her a note, and just ask her, or have your friends do it, but if you want it to do something better give her a chocolate rose, or a teddy bear, and tell her you like her, and if she doesn't like her, then keep being friends with her.|`|7xsPLGNvaa	well don't get one of your friends to do it cause if she turns you down then that would make it more awkward, so just tell her yourself about how you feel about her.|`|9a4ca8b9c03fc5ca17aa0cd77f1a4fd4aa	By her a pizza pie and arrange all the toppings on the words " i gota a crush on u" ,(if she likes pizza), Its cheezy true, but its sweet!|`|AA10834511	Just ask her if she would like to go to the movies or for pizza or something, then you will know if she will want to be yours. Just be yourself, and if its meant to be, it will. Good luck! Ps: Nothing needs to be said, unless the sister will say something, maybe you should start by being honest, then take it from there. Good luck.|`|b8bCqtxqaa	Wow! This is a tough one...I was going to say "Just tell her": Then you said that you use to have a crush on her sister too (it doesn't matter if she was older or not).  I am a younger sister and let me tell you, If you made your feelings clear about her older sister...she'll either tell you to "Get Lost!!" or she'll use you to get her older sister jealous...Or just possibly, she might feel the same way you do. You have to be honest with yourself. Do you really like her, or do you just like her because she's the younger sister??? Think about it...Take care.|`|gFCPnE5Jaa	hunn how about you be exstremly nice to her and and dont really talk about her sister when with her i think u should tell her but not just one day come up to her and b like lets date i like you taht would be rather odd im sayin mabey hang out go out somewhere like sorta ask her on a date and then if she says yea tahts a good first step second hang with her more and ask her friends if they know if she lkes you and then ask her out it will be less harsh to hang out with her before you ask ehr dont do it randomlly|`|ou882Z5aaa	Just come straight out and tell her! She will like it if you just come out and say it, us girls get annoyed when that we think like us dont just come out and say it!! Well, good luck and god bless!|`|vXSo79ZLaa	Have one of your friends (who also talk to her) be like "Hey what do you think about so and so (you)?" Casually and not random. If she sounds like she is interested have your friend be like "He may or may not like you" and so on. If she sounds confused or a bit annoyed just have your friend drop it casually.

cE3DzVgdaa	try talking to him first, if that doesnt help just try to let it go and just stay away from him. true friends wouldnt treat you like s***.  or you could try to find the deeper reason he is being so mean to you and try to help him, tho sometimes its not even worth it. i wouldnt really argue with him, dont waste ur time but at least if u tell him whats on ur mind u wont have to carry that around with you. maybe hell realize hes been a d*** and change his ways, if not its his loss.|`|agh18eT2aa	Let it be and pray for the guy.

Tell him you hope his band is successful and you are hoping to hear great things about it.  Kindness can kill, if that's what you have in mind.

LOL|`|jsS03HSNaa	You say he's in one of your classes?  Approach him when he's not around his friends, and ask if you had any homework in a subject or what's going on in the class.  If he becomes all flustered and either makes direct eye contact or keeps darting his eyes around, it means he likes that you are talking to him.  If he just continues looking at his books in his locker or something, it could mean he stares into outer space or is just incredibly cool around a girl he likes.  If you still want to know more, send a person you are friendly with (you send one of your BFFs it is obvious to him you sent them) and have them ask the boy if he likes you.  If you want an honest result, send a guy.  I hope everything works out for you, because from what you've written it seems promising!

Espero que de algo pueda servirte lo que voy a decir... Yo he visto morir mucha gente querida, he visto y sentido el dolor de la pérdida. Los que quedamos en este mundo sufrimos un luto muy difícil de olvidar...<br>  <br>  Pero debes saber que la muerte es únicamente el paso a una vida mejor, no sé si crees o no en Dios, yo sí; fervientemente creo que él nos ama y nos cuida mientras cumplimos el paso por esta vida.<br>  <br>  Nuestro cuerpo material no es eterno y todos sabemos que tarde o temprano nos llegará la hora de abandonarlo, lo que realmente vale es nuestra alma inmortal y eterna y si tu padre era una persona buena tal como la describes, sin duda él está en un sitio mucho mejor, feliz, esperando volver a verte y velando por ti.<br>  <br>  Dios es inmensamente sabio, no debes culparlo por la muerte de un ser que amabas y amas... cada ser humano cumple su ciclo de vida y nace a una vida nueva, para asegurarnos eso fue que vino Jesús al mundo a sacrificarse para brindarnos la posibilidad de la salvación... y sólo puedes entenderlo mediante la FE.<br>  <br>  Nos queda el cálido recuerdo de quienes amamos y siempre atesoraremos en nuestro corazón, no te sientas sola. DIOS TE AMA.|`|a28e1926b952aff6fc4d427a23b394bfaa	Lee La Biblia, en el libro Juan 5:28,29 y despues lee Revelacion 21:4|`|e319df53f182399db4b717aed2ca3ddfaa	Hola amiga... creo que el tema de la muerte es algo que nunca entenderemos... si bien desde que nacemos empezamos la cuenta regresiva para nuestra muerte... nunca entenderemos porque las personas que aparentemente son sanas en todos los aspectos mueren, lo unico que te recomiendo es que trates de recordar los momentos felices que tuviste con él y tu familia, y no te tortures mas pensando en porque tuvo que ser él... <br>  <br>  saludos y resignación
5ZSRekRaaa	Si me preguntas mi opinon, la verdad el no te quiso lastimar porque sino te hubiera cortado de una sin dar ninguna explicacion, yo lo entiendo y no es por ser machista.

La verdad te diria que lo llamaras y que le pidas una disculpa pero que todo fue un mal entendido.

Mayb his parents didn't like you or something. But, he probably doesn't even know that he changed. and he will probably never realize it. but also, if he fell in love with an other grl, and he's a true sweet hart, yes, he will call himself that b/c he knows that  he's hurting you and a true man would never want that to happen. And believe it or not, he does still care abt you if he said that when he broke up. And this all let's you know that he wants to be close friends with you if he's still coming to you for advice. Why come to you when he has his grlf? hmmmm.....ask urself if you seriously and truely do love him. and i mean seriously! don't second guess urself. if you do, then date other people and hook up with him later when you both know its the right time. Sometimes, if you truely love something, you will give it up for the best. Hint, hint.....  that's what he might've did to you for a special reason! Good luck!

Si ves que no tiene mayor interes en ninguan otra muchacha, lanzate sin miedo y dile como ha cambiado lo que sientes por el; pero si ves que tiene cierto interes en otra chica, mejor esperas porque sale feo decirle todo lo que sientas para que luego te diga "sabes es que a mi me gusta otra...".

De ahí e adelante, necesitas no comprometer la confianza que se tienen como amigos, esa confianza puede estropear las cosas que quieras construir, y es la parte más difícil. Por lo demás, tienes que ser natural, es decir, ir directamente y DECIR CELO es negativo por que es asesino para tus nervios y lo pone a él entre la espada y la pared. <br>  Tu trabajo entonces es 1ro que te vea como una chica y no como una hermana; 2do disminuir de a poco el lazo de confianza si es mucho(como que se cuentan todo); 3ro, tener mucha paciencia y no forzar las cosas más de lo necesario.<br>  Así por lo menos lo hice yo y me fue bien, a tal punto que seguimos siendo novios con mi amiga, jeje.

EJLKnPFMaa	Si te disparas o si te cortas las venas, sólo cuida de no salpicar mucho. Si te ahorcas, no olvides ponerte condón. No te tires a las vías del metro, recuerda que la gente tiene que llegar a tiempo al trabajo. No te inmoles porque si sobrevives ni quien te quiera cuidar. Si te envenenas o sobredosificas, asegúrate de ser efectivo, sería muy bochornoso fallar y que tu ex te lleve chocolates o flores al hospital. Evita los lugares públicos porque los inoportunos llaman a la policía y además de vivo acabarías detenido. Si usas una 22 tírate hacia la garganta porque si lo haces por la sien no hay orificio de salida y quizá quedas medio turulato pero vivo. Recuerda que los seguros de vida normalmente no pagan cuando es por suicidio.|`|e1c9464a69731f536a2e0ab354c29a06aa	Dios te dé larga vida y te colme de bendiciones para disfrutarla.

Also stop doing the high 5s and stuff that sounds a bit masculine to me. When i go out i dress girly and confident and love getting male attention, maybe if he sees other men looking at you he will start to look different at you too.

g9RQ7ediaa	Cold Hearted..no..maybe not open to possibilities ( like someone 'growing' on you) but I also have long stretches between guys..and it isnt weak in the knees that keeps me from dating,its not wanting to waste my time or get the guys hopes up if there is something about him that I KNOW will not work ..IFeeling sick when thinking about kissing them ..well maybe not sick..apathetic maybe..I think you are actually showing maturity and a sense of self worth if you dont want to 'just settle' BUt I will say as you get older ( like me) you soon realize that you may have to settle if you get to the 'gotta have a guy' mentality.

7HjZovi4aa	You said your 99% certain he wants freindship so start being his friend and stop analysing his every move|`|aYDObT1Laa	Well you should be more talking about your views in the group. and participate in wht everyone talks.|`|67cvBQK0aa	people of this kind is actually someone who cares for other. he did not want to ignore anybody. maybe you are the one who feels being ignored, because you want more of his attention. other thing is, maybe both of you spend your time longer than your time with other. so thats why he give priority in the group conversation.|`|934uk0Qvaa	Talk to him.<br>  A very sensitive guy behaves like this.|`|bI0pEWTlaa	It is probably just because you are the quieter one.  If he is like me, he probably tries to look mostly at the person talking and just glances at everyone else.|`|cc7160f5f74bd8f083c00b91ee3d1f53aa	You're looking for, and possibly over-reading signs that he's into you, because you're really hoping that he likes you, when he most likely treats most friends the same way.  He's either interested or not interested, and if he's not, then you're torturing yourself when it would be healthier to move on.  Guessing and analyzing won't get you very far, and so there are no big signs that he likes you, especially compared to your liking him.<br>  <br>  As for in groups, people naturally focus on the most talkative, most energetic people.  When you make a comment, such as laughing at his joke, but then don't say anything else, then attention naturally shifts to you, but you're not contributing anything else, so everyones' attention shifts back.

Thirdly if this guy acts like you don't exist sometimes that means that you are probably smothering him or acting weird around him at times that makes him feel uncomfortable so he will act like you are not in the room so you won't say anything to him. Move on gf...He's not feeling ya.|`|cc7160f5f74bd8f083c00b91ee3d1f53aa	A lot of possibilities.  He could like you but intentionally pretend he doesn't sometimes to make you like him more/control himself.  In which case, he either could have lingering feelings (control himself) or he's, well, trying to make you like him.<br>  Or you might be so blinded that his normal actions seem like much bigger deals.  Then you should probably ask mutual friends who have an objective perspective and better information.<br>  <br>  You really want some affirmation so you won't be rejected.  But if he likes you, you have to find out, and if he doesn't, it'll hurt, so it'll be a roller coaster either way.|`|ojD2PfjCaa	seems to me he still likes you..<br>  guys are dumb like that.<br>  My first bf, when i was 11 always acted like i didnt exist,<br>  i asked him years later why<br>  and he said, he was fine with me before we started dating, and he liked me alot, he just felt akward and uncomfortable..<br>  Then my current bf, my fiance, just likes his space alot..<br>  with him its just a matter of girls arent as clingy as girls are, and dont like always spending time together, especially at a younger age.|`|vRgnejizaa	Hey ya....<br>  <br>  Looks u are getting insane... But for what... A person who I feel is got double standards. Stop breaking your head and go speak to him. Tell him about how important he is to u. If he reciprocates then nothing good like it. But if he tries acting smart…. Then chuck it and carry on…<br>  <br>  Cheers!!!

Would you try out for the major league as a pitcher....no, it's out of your league.|`|mYY9uOQKaa	basically it means that the other person is 'too good for you' but its stupid because no one is too good for someone else, so dont believe it!|`|vHOU1tXpaa	that the other person is not interested.
71b2f5f33bdf6b91c85d30c447c8c9c3aa	that she loves you and she is living with regret.  Trust me I know.  Go to her, tell her you love her, tell her to leave him, and tell her you will marry her if that is what you want. She will be hard to talk to but have patience and tell her everything will be okay.  She is angry with you becase it took you so damn long to realize you should have married her!.|`|9e56d15ae2a8b08aaaaf034514dc987baa	Well - she doesn't sound happy!  I guess she really really wanted to get married!  She isn't angry with you - she is angry at herself!  She doesn't want everyone to say "I told you so," and it is probably scary for her to think she made such a HUGE mistake.  What if she divorces him and you really don't want to make things work with her - then she will be all alone.....She has to be in a scary position too.<br>  <br>  Put yourself in her husbands shoes - I bet he has no idea how she feels......  Maybe you should try moving on, and in time things will work out the way they should!<br>  <br>  A Broken Heart sucks - and I am sorry that you are going through that, it has to be a horrible situation to be in.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|m3L6pLBaaa	move on man. if she loved you she would be with you . i would not even talk to her anymore. i would not even answer the phone. find you someone else man. she is just using you as a back up incase it don't work. any way she did it to you once do you really think she wouldn't do it again even if she was devorced. sorry man just stop letting your self getting hurt by someone that is married and is using you. find you someone else. the quicker the less heartache you will have.|`|0fe2a69798e0174e0b5a68eb4d1f2a1faa	She is mad at herself for making a bad choice. The anger directed at you is a way of redirecting her self-hatred. You were right to tell her not to talk to you until she is divorced. Don't answer her calls.  Keep your distance.  You don't want to become the reason for the divorce which will undoubtedly happen.|`|9C8Be3Jjaa	Maybe she's regretting...best way to avoid her is change your phone #...|`|hiiVybBHaa	poor mate you need help to get over her  if you want you can talk to me i always listen to what people have to say  and always find answers email me at katemoore75@yahoo.com.au|`|9haJXU9taa	We are in the same boat...I know how you feel, confused! Really don't know what to expect and don't know whether to move on or wait.|`|C8TMWXT7aa	she's probably angry at the fact she wasted four years on a self obessed 'superconfused' knob hed|`|ErpVPlmpaa	i think that she got angry at you because you finally said that you still loved her and that you still wanted to be with her and that it was a complete shock to everyone that she married someone else, and i think she got mad at you because she realized what she missed and that maybe she did the wrong thing by getting married to the other guy, she does not want to accept the fact that she is the one who ruined the relationship and that she could be married to you and not the other guy, and what she means by that she has accepted her marriage is that she does not love him the way she loves you and she loves him in a way but not the way that she wants her marriage to be and that she is going to learn how to deal with the fact that her life could of been completely different<br>  <br>  and you were right when you said that she should call you when she is divorce, you do not want to be in the middle of their relationship even though you kinda are, but try to stay out of it as much as possible, if you love her tell her that you will wait or that your always going to be there for her but not in the way that she would end up cheating on her husband <br>  <br>  this situation is really hard and I'm really sorry for it, hopefully everything works out well, good luck|`|pMPfyUtkaa	she is bi polar.  no she feels guilty.  She loves you but like so many women, she thought she "needed" to be married so she went and married the first jo shmo that came and married her.<br>  <br>  She loves you and she knows you were "the one" and she was probly marring the guy to show you how badly she realy wanted to be married.  <br>  <br>  She messed up, and she has to deal with the consiquences.  I suggest you move on with your life too....<br>  <br>  Unless she divorces the guy and you'll take her back....

(answer in years) does it exceed her age?|`|KfKooqJoaa	yes...|`|a56b5b19fc49ac86a93efb5bb5523ca7aa	How do you think she is too young for you ? 18 and 15 is a suitable match. Go ahead.  All the best.|`|iisVZhBsaa	Three years is not too much, it's just the fact you guys have started early. Adolescence is for growing up and if you were able to experience the ups and downs of relationships and she was not, then maybe she won't fully mature. If she is a fast maturer and she is happy with the relationship, then don't worry about the number. When you guys are happy and she's 25, you'll only be 28 and the gap won't seem so large!|`|qNAu480qaa	depends on where you are... i am 16 and my bf is 22. But where i live 16 is legal. Its alright for you to date... but probably not to actually enter into a sexual relationship just yet. You will have to do some research into age of consent and your area. But i truly don't think age should be an issue if its meant to be its meant to be
JnDPuDqaaa	Obviously, your ex-boyfriend still has romantic (or plainly just physical) feelings for you, even if he cheated with another woman. I wouldn't take the dream very seriously, though- don't feel soft towards him just because he was dreaming of you two together again. If he cheated, he's not worth it!|`|FSK1v5neaa	he still has feelings for you|`|8aLwA4Z9aa	that he wants u back  or he made it all up 3get u back|`|1e9c3a6ed6da93db07b65d1deb5225c1aa	It means he thought that this would be a good line to try to get you back....even if he did have this dream for real, it is not some cosmic sign that the universe is telling you to get back together...|`|3Lqb6ZWEaa	means he misses you|`|TnSo6ETmaa	He feels bad.

CDzStUPUaa	Maybe she thinks you're 'too' into her by  giving the impression that you'll always be available.<br>  Pull back a little bit.  Call her less;  be a little less available ... play hard to get.  Let her wonder if you are losing interest in her. <br>   If   she really, really  likes you;  then she'll start chasing you. Trust me; it  works! Good luck!   :)|`|e1dc61fe86e4539f88ffde7d3e99425aaa	I would not pressure her,it might run her off.  Best things are to comr, when you let them come to you.
ZSqF9OHtaa	Connect in person. Time to plan a visit and spend some time reconnecting.  The warmth of personal connection is hard to keep alive long distance.  Just get together with him and spend a couple of days and see how it feels. It should do wonders for your relationship.  A recharge of sorts.  I hope it turns out perfect for you.  :)|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	sounds fishy, and like it might be time for a surprize visit to me.|`|5f120cbd83a90b696041c6b04f024601aa	u should try meeting more with him to keep him interested in u good luck|`|ad727be340dbb41ff7fa32cb9647324baa	this is easy, just leave him be! seriously! don't try to hard, you'd hurt yourself.<br>  just leave him for a while don't call him for a while, like a week. then see what happens. if he calls, he still loves you.|`|aevvY7JSaa	I somewhat had/have the same problem except it was a little different in my case. If you don't think you've done anything wrong, or if you suspect something, first I'd sit him down and have a serious conversation with him. Tell him that you've been feeling this way and what you think is the best thing for you both to do about it. You got to get your feelings out, thats what I did and things have been alot better (this happened about 2 weeks ago) get ready for a rocky road though, i'll tell you its not easy, but its really the only option you have. You need to ask him his priorites and see whats going through HIS head. It'll take a little while, i'm still working on it. Good luck though, I hope your problem works out as well as mine :)|`|hzuim98Raa	Busy means "doesn't care enough to make time for you".<br>  Busy means "you aren't really a priority"<br>  Busy means " I am more important than you are - deal with it".<br>  <br>  Soooooo - if you are comfortable with those answers - then revive it however you can.  I say - be realistic and realize that he isn't making the cut anymore for you.  And you possibly aren't for him - call it quits and save face.  Trying to revive a bad relationship is only going to make things harder and take more precious time away from you... you deserve better.  Someone out there won't say that they are busy and they will make time for you... go think about that guy - he actually deserves your time.|`|f1d4892274fb0093612f50bb5aadba0eaa	Unfortunately, the odds of a long distance relationship surviving are quite small. If you are having doubts you will need to ask him straight out. If he still avoids you or the questions then tell him its over.
ebab62f967cc3a84b423efa6a7f3cc3daa	It is true that alot of men say it without really "meaning it." this is why you pay attention TO the guy you're with and ALWAYS go by his actions, not just his words. Another way to tell if a guy may actually love you is if he loves himself. Without a good relationship with you, how can you have one with anyone else? Instead of hurting yourself over trying to figure out what HE'S thinking, pay attention to you. Because YOU matter the most.<br>  <br>  Good luck! =]|`|9L3nOoLvaa	I dunno. If he really loves you. You could kind of tell sometimes? Ask him questions, if he gives a corny answer than...i dunno maybe? i have no experience ... :P

6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	I think you should try to figure things out with this guy. You'd regret it if you didnt; he sounds like a real gentleman. What do you have to lose? He seems to really enjoy your company at least.
mJmG3i4Oaa	Don't ever worry about what other people think about you. You should feel good about yourself, and know the beauty you have inside and out on your own..!! Most likely girls are going to give you side comments about your looks becuase alot of girls are filled with jealousy. And the guys may be truthful when they tell you, you look gorgeous. Just make sure That YoU feel good about yourself before anybody else does...thats very important. So when someone says your unattractive, think about it in your head and say, hmmm, "how do i feel about myself"? " i think i look good who cares what other ppl say."...! =) [confidence] is a manin key <br>  <br>  haveanice day =-)<br>  <br>  [ebony]?|`|6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	If you think you're attractive, then you are.|`|Monwd22Oaa	Well unless you're a lesbian,it's better for guys to think you're attractive than girls.<br>  But I think you just know some bitchy women.Because the girls I know,if they think you're pretty or looking pretty or cute one day,they tell you.
6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	I think she may like you...when you stare at someone, that often means you're thinking a lot about that. The fact she did this even when she was sober suggests she probably takes an interest in you.|`|DnoJHdE7aa	idk man sounds more like a stalker than a crush, ask some of her friends wats up, does she like you did you offend her, is she part of a cult, just find out some info and it will prolly solve your problem.|`|tmXmVmA8aa	Maybe she likes you.|`|v3ws8ZJOaa	you should talk to her, even if you don't feel attracted to her yet. she will be happy you're talking to her, and hey, you guys might end up going out or something.|`|zPGHZGL5aa	Well she likes you. Dot.
nJasb7Fxaa	He is no longer interested in you. If he was you would have heard from him, I'm sorry to say. So, I think it is okay to make the break up official.

You haven't talked in a while. Maybe you guys should start talking again; that's a first step. If it gets really weird, I would probably break up with him if you can't figure out your problems.|`|kkc5Wkhuaa	if he liked you he would definitely want to be with you and make the time to be with you, it sounds like he has lost interest and rather than making you upset he is just avoiding you.

There are sooooo many others out there.  Give this loser a swift kick to the curb.  I promise there is somebody out there that will like you for you.

All I am sure of is he is not worth your time.|`|AA12219198	obviously this guy doesn't respect you, and isn't worth your time. You are better than that.

He and your other buddy are practically ganging up on you. That's not cool at all. Thatis one of the most heartbreaking things from my experience. At the same time, depending on his age, he could be picking at you to cover his true feelings. If that is the case, then you will be able to tell very soon, hopefully. But one thing I'm sure of, girlie, if you don't see any sign of improvement in his attitude toward you and your deep down feelings, lose him. At least try to convince youself that THERE DEFINATELY IS SOMEONE OUT THERE who will not hurt your feelings as a passtime. That's not acceptable. Your better than that judging by your sweet little question. :-)|`|b98Xvgwoaa	hey<br>  i've had this same feeling. I really liked my best friend for ages and she knew about it.<br>  What i needed to do is just take some time away from everything and think things over. <br>  when i liked her i got the hint she liked me back, but didnt think much of it.<br>  From my experience i would suggest just taking some time to yourself so you can think this over.  In the time you may realise that he isnt worth all the touble your getting put through. Especially if hes fooling around with your friend and not realising he is really hurting you.<br>  <br>  i hope you work something out =]|`|ddcE9JhHaa	dont worry things will get better. just keep being who u r and dont get upset just cause he is joking about it.|`|griwMyO6aa	Just be straight up when they make fun of you. "Do you honestly think it's funny? It's seriously not that big of a deal." Maybe they laugh b/c he's gay. Have some one on one time with him and ask him how important you really are to him.

If they feel they need to lie to make friends, then maybe they are not secure with themselves.  Perhaps they are not loved at home and are starved for attention.  There may be more to this person than you realize.  If it bothers you this much don't associate with her, perhaps she'll learn that it's a bad way to go about getting friends.  Be the better person.|`|WvuZU0uKaa	it depends on what they are lying about, some people have a tail when they lie, like they fidget or blink alot. if its someone you have been dating for a while you could hire a private investigator to follow them around, or you could do it, but then you would be a stalker. or get one of your friends to do it, someone she doesnt know. also if she has a computer you could get one of those key logging programs to see who she talks to and where she goes on the internet. it just really depends on what you want to do and how creepy you want to look.|`|b677a447fb4532a31547b43c8998569faa	Its called being a pathalogical liar. Just ask her TONS of questions about the subject...orrrr remember a lie she has said and ask her about the same topic or thing she lied about in about a month.

He wants you to be embarrassed and angry. If you react like that - angry, embarrassed, asking him to stop - he's gotten exactly what he wanted and will do it again. However, if you ignore it and/or laugh it off, you're not giving him what he wants. Eventually he'll get tired of trying to embarrass you and getting no reaction. Just laugh it off. "God, I was a weird 3rd grader, wasn't I?" Don't act embarrassed - you were in third grade! No one will care.|`|AWHVwtIkaa	That's really childish on his part. Find out something embarrassing about him and tell everyone, yeah it's a little juvenile but it might be the only way he learns.|`|M62WPprsaa	What did you go?|`|gW9fcWMVaa	Hehe, it must have been hilarious.

As you don't want to chase her away.|`|mzPAdtLDaa	The simple and hardest answer is to ask her. <br>  <br>  She already likes you since you are good friends. The only way to see if she might like you more than just a friend is to ask her. You could find a quiet spot and tell her how you feel and see if she feels the same. Some times you have to break out of the shy thing.|`|8cbdf39201470907f21879ffb12f4980aa	Well, I'm in 9th grade and i am really good friends w/ this guy and i really like him, but he doesn't really exactly know that.

wHe3TALtaa	It's not you at all-It's probably the guys that like you are just really shy. As for your guy friends, if you really think that you're interested in him, give him a chance, because you never know what will happen if you don't at least try.<br>  If you are still unable to give your emotions away to a guy, you have to get used to the fact that in dating you're most likely to get hurt, because what's love without getting hurt? The two go hand in hand ( at least I think, since you need to date a few guys to see if it would work and some don't. ) It's a fact that we've all got to face and I think you're handling yourself pretty well with that fact.<br>  Just try to get out there and meet a few guys that fit the type you're looking for, makes you happy, supports you in everything you do and loves you no matter what.  you shouldn't settle for anything less since everyone deserves happiness[:|`|IFRiC3KDaa	its not  that you can give your emotions to guys its just maybe you havent found the right guy yet<br>  <br>  dont worry im sure you will

If she fights having sex with you or shows signs to stop you from having sex with her, then it could mean that she was forced into marriage and she loved another.  Then, you need to talk to her nicely and find out what is in her heart.  Then go from there since there is no use that you have her body but not her heart.<br>  <br>  If it's a girlfriend, then if she came alone to have sex with you then obviously she is ready to do it and need not speak about it since her actions speak louder than words.|`|cDGdMALPaa	Normally girls will not speak out during first night. because both of you come from different environment.  Sex is one of the unavoidable case in marriage life. So definetly she will be interested but don't insist that you need to know this on first night itself, which will make things worse..|`|ahrFYliBaa	Try and make a move or something..<br>  and if she pulls away, then you no shes not intrested.<br>  <br>  And don't take advantage of her..|`|qgjOSCsKaa	u need to give her some time she might be shy but once she knows u you should be fine
RL9wZs3Iaa	That's just like asking if everybody in the world likes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. There are definitely going to be some nice guys out there. However, there is a slowly dwindling supply of them because of society these days.<br>  <br>  Many girls (along with some on Y! Answers also) think they are all in love with guys who are tough and dominant. And what do all of the nice guys think about this? They believe that they have to be just like all of the others to get women to look at them as a potential partner. <br>  <br>  This has evolved (or rather, de-evolved) what people in the world think. So, the real question is when will people (men and women alike) begin to seek those who will really give them the love that they say the will give. Just something to think about...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  To respond to your additional note, I'm not saying that you specifically are like that, I'm saying that many people out there have that opinion about what they like in guys, which is why so many are hard to find.<br>  <br>  As for finding them yourself, I would have to say to go places where nice guys might be hanging out (local shops, libraries, etc.). Not that great of advice, I know, but there really is no true way to pinpoint a guy's location.|`|7kga2aRBaa	mostly.  well they sure as hell are at my school. i'm like you, only really met about 10 that are nice (they don't go to my school though) i'm sure there is actually nice guys out there though.  hmm, i wouldn't really know where to find them though, haha, sorry.  but hope you find some! and if you do, tell me where. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  answer my question please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080607174947AAbXNrV&pa=FYd1D2bwHTHzJbhuHOw6SWWHTC048RsMTSpD.FpceyrFNw--&paid=asked&msgr_status=">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|TXaAsy4Kaa	im a single chef in austin mail me back if would like t ochat|`|p7HYGk1xaa	Hello,,you said it!!you met about 10,,how many you need to answer the question?|`|IWnOtGV6aa	There are still some nice guys out there but unfortunately a lot of them don't come in the "physical package" that we are looking for and they get overlooked.

Girls normally do not like if you treat them good. Even if they tell you its wrong, remember that they do not think by their brain but by their ..boo.... :D.. Leave her for sometime, give her a cold shoulder. Don't go gaga over her. But do pay much attention to her without letting her know. Then do like this one moment you push her away and the next moment you pull her in. Do this for sometime, she would get confused but she would like it. It'll get her off any thoughts she has with that ex-loser. It's an art, don't get too involved before you get the ball in your court for good. Be calm, content and play it like a good poker player. <br>  Love is pure but female beings are kinda strange.. you have to keep your bunny in your cage and everything's fair in love.<br>  You may email me at <br>  lunypriest@yahoo.com<br>  if you decide to use my thoughts.

And to have a healthy relationship you need to be open with each other. So you should probably talk to her about that first of all. And about the ex thing it might be because of the not open thing or it may be because she is not completely over him. Which she cant move on to a good relationship with you until she does get over him, my suggestion is that you talk to her about it. And if it doesnt get better you guys might need to take a break. For you sanity and for her to maybe test her feelings out and see how it goes . that is the best advice i can give you.
RybMyatPaa	guys like girls who like themselves. they like when a girl enjoys her life and does the things she enjoys. they don't want a girl to drop her life for him, they will try but stand your ground.

1RmjF6G8aa	That's mean. You were just trying to ask her what her book was, and what is was about. Not to sound rude or anything, but if someone could even treat another person like that, they have problems. That's just terrible. She could of just said, "I'm not in a good mood right now, sorry. I just don't feel like talking or something", if she was upset. But to take her anger out on you or to be mean to you is not cool at ALL. Now, I not saying that you should be mean to her back or anything, I'm just saying that YES, you do have a right to be mad. But if you never forgive her or ever talk to her, you might regret it. Just talk to her and tell her how you feel. Tell her that it really upset you that she acted that way, and if she acts rudely to you again, who cares? If she wants and friend, she better start acting like one. |`|5cf4bbd0a4285d4d25548299c7061c4aaa	you shouldn't be mad. especially if they are your friend. it was probably just a bad joke. you'll get over it.|`|AA10423186	just  try|`|7HZTLApTaa	maybe she was just pms ing ... lol i would just ignore her and see what happens on Monday.. if shes all smarta** again be like whatever.Eventually she'll get over it.<br>  <br>  hope i helped:)|`|PM4tUtsLaa	It depends on how she said it, in my opinion. If she said it like a joke, then there's no need to take offense. If she said it harshly on the other hand, then you might need to reconsider who your friends are. There's no need to make a response like that, so you might want to consider asking her why she did. For all you know, she might be angry about something you don't know about, and took it out on you. Being angry at her might only make things worse.|`|rD2bH6Asaa	Ignore it. They;re just being annoying. Next time just ask, whats it about? but i don't think they had a right to reply to u in that way!|`|iIPpd6wuaa	people always tell me the same thing .. that im a too nice,, but i think you are maybe overreacting|`|vJP6yTy3aa	you overreacted.  how is she supposed to know that you didn't know what the book was?  is she a mind-reader?  nope.  you should have asked her "what's the book about?"...|`|U047ZtGnaa	YES U SHOULD GET SOO MAD IT UR BOOK SOORY I DID NOT REAFD IT WELL<br>  
k2CbMYt4aa	Ask him about Kaylee.  Be like so you like this Kaylee girl? and if he says yes be like Oh thats a shame or thats too bad and then he'll say why and just kind of say because I like you.  After you say that watch his reaction, if he looks or gives an indication he likes you like that then ask him out and if not just laugh it off like you were jokin around and then you wont ruin your friendship with him either|`|e6f57551a9fea96616d64364edaca81faa	You will spent the rest of your life wondering what could have happened if you do not ask him. Just flat out tell him you like him. There ya go, done.|`|pNN7YnKSaa	Just write him a note, telling him you like him and stuff, and ask if he feels the same way.  Just make sure you slip it to him when the teacher isn't looking.  |`|2a8FLwtaaa	Wow, I say this to like all of these questions, but flirt a lot?<br>  get him to "help" you in class, especially if you do need help. double win<br>  smile, and say hi to him, whenever you see him|`|mAgCw5bsaa	cowboy up  start talking to him see if hes interested. your only ?<br>  pretty sure once you get talking it will become obvious just don't scare <br>  him off to quickly don't no what could be so in important at ??? years old good luck|`|1SlKkLewaa	You should wait till he starts showing some interest on you cause you dont want to look like a fool asking him out and then him denying it.<br>  Also its kinda weird if a girl asks out a guy.|`|QX2sfHcdaa	maybe if u r shy just give him a note or something if u dont want to give it to him in person ask one of your friends to give it to him while ur not there. |`|D1u3aL7Aaa	Kick him in the nards and light his face on fire.|`|6hPqiwAEaa	if you go for it and ask him hes going to say yes i know that for a fact just go for it |`|040pPto7aa	ok u r to young wait till ur a teen at least.  go see a movie or something but see something he wants to see.
qZ684R09aa	its a hard one. but, consider letting them both know either together or individually that you value their friendship at all cost. i think they would understand. but, seems like you really can't do much but be supportive and hope that it works out or else if it doesn't, that they are both grown ups to not jeopardize friendships. good luck!|`|so0Dx32Vaa	well it could be uncomfortable for you...<br>  but is that maybe jus b/c you don't wanna hav 2 choose sides??<br>  jus make shure not to doubt their relationship...<br>  but if it does fall apart...and they ask...<br>  jus simply say you don't wanna choose sides b/c you love both of them so much<br>  and if they're real friends...they'll understand :)|`|AA10074764	Well there's nothing you can do about it that's life enjoy and take pics so that u can blackmale later<br>  Gnight|`|30df7c325ae8f7474ce61c26a63fc215aa	well if they put you in that situation they're not being good friends to u  so be honest with them and I'm sure they'll be cool|`|oSAq7ay3aa	Stay out of there arguments and don't take sides.|`|uXrZqrKWaa	tell them exactly what you just told us.|`|5KtJGbuFaa	Stop worrying so much. Just be happy for them.|`|gNgHbHQHaa	Engage in a hot and steamy threesome!|`|ImgouTRIaa	You may well lose them both ,but don't be the jerk in this situation. Graciously step back from any of the dating mess, and stay back. Nothing wrong from being friends with them , but when it comes to taking sides , don't, and if those questions of " whose side are you on" , tell them with no uncertainties that you are staying out of it. If you do , guess who will have the egg on the face ?YOU!!
59eb8ab2bb7c6098d7fffda52a1fe21daa	Wow... what is so amazing to me, is that she is putting her fantasies of having him over her relationship with her daughter...jeeeeeeez... At any rate, I am not sure confronting her would do any good, she probably will just deny it and try to make you look crazy for suggesting it.  I would advise to spend ad much time holed up with your man in your room away from her, while you save up money so you can get OUT of there...Good luck, hon!|`|8UolTiBxaa	I feel so sorry for you. Get him out of the house for an hour. Then talk to her about it. But I'm sure she is too old for him (no offense). If you want to be mean tell her to back off or talk to her husband about it. But you need to get your own house QUICK!!! Hope this works. Wish you the best =]|`|wxGa752Eaa	Choke her and say leave my bf alone ******<br>  <br>  No really, you have to tell her before it becomes a bigger problem.|`|gnAWD5szaa	You need to have a serious talk with your mom. Tell her to back off.|`|NbBUNcrYaa	talk to her about it, tell her that she needs to find someone for herself.|`|AA10205406	Get out of your moms house! ASAP! |`|1oIRSdPzaa	hey if this continues then you need to confront her about it, if she denys then keep working at it.if this does not work when you visit her keep her away from him, if all this fails then tell the guy she lives with if he is the kind to care about her. hope this helps,bye.<br>  |`|7f932490a85b0ba15fb134215617447baa	Move out of there as soon as you can. Even though she's 53, she still has needs and it seems like she might be trying to fulfill them through your man. <br>  <br>  Take your stand if you have to. The minute she does or says anything out of line, point it out to her and tell her to quit it immediately. Maybe she'll get the hint. <br>  <br>  People should have morals. My 18 yr old had her boyfriend staying here and he had similar feelings for me. After they broke up, he sent me sexual messages. It definitely isn't acceptable. <br>  <br>  If your mom is trying to get that kind of attention, she needs to grow up and think about your feelings.|`|KN4hKLCBaa	Tell her whether it's her intentions to try to steal your boyfriend or not, you're not ok with her actions concerning him. And that she needs to back off. If she resists, tell her your mother/daughter relationship will be no more if she doesn't, because she needs to respect you and your beau. <br>  <br>  And also-- get out of that living situation ASAP.|`|jYmvtUC5aa	I think I would be evacuating the premises myself. Mom may be harmless, but maybe not and how not cool to mess w her daughters man.<br>  Y'all need a place of your own and let mom know this is not gonna cut it in the mother/daughter relationship.<br>  Women, seems like we are always competing, even when we shouldn't be............|`|AA11596133	FIRST, you NEED to get your OWN place.  You have been living in an extremely dysfunctional house for WAY too many years, making YOU quite dysfunctional too.  You CANNOT and will not EVER be able to see reality as long as you are in that environment.<br>  <br>  WHEN you do cut the ties that bind you to this mess, you can then live your own life in peace.  Your drunk horny Mother totally controls you - get away from her NOW.  You cannot tell her what to do as long as you live with her. |`|rlULD2Hzaa	i hope youre draining him regularly while living there, you know us guys.. if we have a bit of a buildup there and theres a willing female, it can sometimes be hard to resist :/|`|bf563611997105cddb27bc4878086aa2aa	You should feel sorry for her. She obviously is trying to convince herself she can still attract a younger man. She is actually making an *** of herself. Sad!|`|ebab62f967cc3a84b423efa6a7f3cc3daa	It's simple: dont bring him to the house anymore. You're a grown woman, i think you can figure it out.|`|b8c19e3a7d89db6f55b31d1c1ae94233aa	Oh, barf! I am sorry to hear this...it makes me throw up in my mouth a little bit. If you don't think you can pull your mother aside and talk to her woman to woman about what she's doing, and ask her to please stop!!! Then the next time she does it in front of you with him...say MOM, what is your deal? You act like your in love with (insert name her). Or tell him, it feels weird your mom does that, and ask him to put her in her place tactfully.

That really winds me up. <br>  <br>  Real love is the most important, special and beautiful thing in the world.|`|421288574b7a52a5ba8268e608253dfbaa	It must be real because the pain I'm feeling after my ex suddenly dumped me for no apparent reason after almost 2 years together hurts like hell.|`|b2972287e366f5c1407c131b23fd7144aa	Real!|`|UVciAbXxaa	yes its real|`|bf563611997105cddb27bc4878086aa2aa	Real love is Real and it makes you very happy! Unfortunately many people think jealousy, games, infidelity, abuse are love when in reality they are anything but love. Love is when you care for a person's happiness and you do everything in your power to make them happy and they do the same for you. Why people settle for less is beyond me!|`|1eb768403881b0e1324273b881757fbcaa	Well really it depends on the type of love<br>  Friendly love- yes because true friends are there for you whenever you need them<br>  hater love- yes because without this love you will never know who are fake and real<br>  first love- yes because some people actually do marry their first love<br>  sex love- not really because most people have sex more than one time and more than one person<br>  first time love- yes because their is a such thing as falling in love for the first time<br>  puppy love- no because crushes come and go <br>  |`|0Fl0lJwyaa	What can I say, it's real. True love is hard to find, I can tell you that, but to me, love is created, not just at first sight, it's about the little things in life you do for your partner. It's about caring, and to always think from hard love. I've been in so called "love" before, but I never realized that I didn't actually love that woman, but now I've found my true love, and it's the greatest feeling I have. She became my power, my hope, my will, and pretty much gave me what I've always dreamed of. Real love... may be hard for some to find, maybe some will never experience it, but you know you got it when all you want to do is to be with her, no matter how hard the times may be.|`|FvbDDfWbaa	Yeah its real, its something that countless generations of individuals have tried to find, understand and explain, and when you find this answer to what love is, and you grasp it, it can easily dart away like quicksilver.|`|rNysukWyaa	yes love is real.. theres different kinds of love.. the one you feel for your sibblings and the one you feel for a partner.. it is the most wonderful thing but love is only real when two people feel it not just one..|`|ebab62f967cc3a84b423efa6a7f3cc3daa	It depends.<br>  If it smells, it is real, if it talks, it is real, if it moves it is real...does love do these things?|`|Q8YHZ5g8aa	Yes and it was really hard for me to find. But I finally found it :-)|`|zAPK7YPQaa	yes|`|iSXxchJMaa	yes its real 4 me coz my parents did love marriage and many of my friends and also relations did but am still in search of ma love.,how sad|`|8abdS3g4aa	Love is very real, but it is also a phrase that gets "thrown around" too often. When you are in love you will know it!!|`|DFIZEJFhaa	Love is real and it is the best thing on earth.Without love there would never be peace.So imagine if love was not real?|`|HXRcBwZHaa	Definitely real|`|E6hAnLTzaa	Yes!

f5VSMPg9aa	He wants to hurt you because you hurt his pride. He was arrogant, selfish, and believed he could do what he wanted and get what he wanted.<br>  <br>  If he broke up with you initially, it's probably because he wanted to fool around a little bit. If you broke up with him, he probably thought he was better off at first because he could fool around now, but either realized he wanted you more than anyone else or realized he ****** up with the new girl and believed the old mess he made was better than his new one.<br>  <br>  So, he came crawling back to the relationship that was comfortable for him. Then, he found out he could never have it back, so he blew up. It was more than he could handle. He wont stop until he gets what he wants, hurts you bad enough, or you just cut him out of your life.<br>  <br>  I know it's hard, but get that divorce. He says he's going to do it, but I doubt he'll go through with it. He's using it as a tactic to get what he wants from you. If he doesn't get the divorce soon, do it yourself. If he wont leave you alone after that, get a restraining order. I know it sounds extreme, but you don't need that in your life. You've got enough stress and problems to sort through already. He's just going to keep adding more.<br>  <br>  As for the kicking and screaming... do it. Cut loose and do it. Either by yourself or with someone you trust. Cry it out. Let yourself feel these emotions.|`|f3cbb5ce9f2304adcda13ae360118e58aa	Men are scum sometimes. Go out with your freinds cry on there shoulders. There will be another man in your life-just take your time. U deserve better.   |`|72444e08c9e33c48ded58d8e6c28c267aa	All i can do is tell you, that you will love again! so go ahead kick scream and cry for now... you will heal... go to church and events and meet new people... dont get in a relationship yet but make friends, and find yourself again! A lot of women forget who they really are when they get into a relationship- Find that women again, i know because I found myself - and its wonderful! |`|dvc5sNEbaa	Go to church, get counseling on your own, but under no circumstance let this man back in your life.|`|W3F7xeF5aa	forget about him, be independant|`|YmJAI5MVaa	WELL UR INA TOUGH SITUATION!!!! u should definatley stop drinking so much befor u become completely addicted to it. u should get the divorce and get a new number and email. just kick him out of ur life!!!  u dont deserve all of this. i bet ur a beautiful 28 year old who wants to forget about the biggest mistake of ur life. and u should! just move on. make new friends who dont noe ur past....party it up.....go to clubs, relax and live ur life the way u want to live it!!!! forget that ****!!!!!!!  ur a new women and u r strong and independent!!!!!!   u only have one life to live!!!!   LIVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|ebab62f967cc3a84b423efa6a7f3cc3daa	It does sound unbelievable.<br>  You need to stop talking to him. Simple as that. Make it a promise to yourself that you will not see, speak, or hear from him for at least sixty days. It is the best thing you can do for yourself. And during that time, go out and see someone new, or at least, try. Plan a vacation with your friends. Far away. Make it a priority when you get up in the morning to to something that will make you feel better about yourself.<br>  that DOESNT include your ex. You'll be glad you did.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|PtC3z4pFaa	Umm .....<br>  Hes caused you all this trouble just walk away and find some one else who wont screw other *******|`|8N7W6ze9aa	First off, quit talking to him, there is no trust there...and there never will be, tell him to mail the divorce papers to you.  No since in trying to warn the other woman, she doesn't want to hear it, she needs a daddy.<br>  Second, learn to love yourself...you will never love anyone, if you can't love yourself.  There is someone out there that will sweep you off of your feet, and treat you like the princess that you are.  Break all ties with the man, he can do nothing but harm and hurt you...he's shown that!|`|E6hAnLTzaa	Sorry you're going through such a rough time. The emotional roller coaster you are now now is normal. Just don't let him dictate the ups and downs. He is probably enjoying the fact that he can make you miserable. I dunno. I couldn't do it, but I guess there are guys out there that get some sort of sick satisfaction out of emotionally beating a woman. That kind of stuff makes me sick. <br>  <br>  Did you guys have separation papers drawn up? If not, and he goes out and gets some other woman pregnant, you own him. He admitted to having an affair. Get a lawyer and tell him/her the situation and they will pretty much tell you he's screwed. <br>  <br>  As far as loving again? You will. For right now, just hang out with your friends and find a good shoulder to cry on. Get rid of all the negative feelings, and start the slow process of healing your heart. A friend of mine has a great saying at her desk at work. It says:<br>  <br>  " Don't tell God how big your storm is, tell the storm how big your God is." <br>  <br>  I have found this quote to be useful in a number of issues I've dealt with. Don't turn to the bottle to deal with your problems. They will still be there in the morning, only you will have a headache to go along with them. <br>  <br>  You can always turn to the one person that will ALWAYS love you, and never abandon you. Jesus Christ.  He is the best listener of all. If all else fails, maybe talk to someone about your problems and maybe find some positive ways to get over your current situation. <br>  <br>  I wish you all the luck!!<br>  <br>  |`|NYsyOcgFaa	Sweetheart, consider yourself lucky.  One, you don't have kids.  Two, better to find out now than 10 years from know when you're in your 30's.  Men are dispicable creatures.  My ex, still haunts me to get back together, and when I refuse, becomes psycho.  His nickname is Jeckel & Hyde.  It's been 3 years since our divorce.<br>  Another thing you need to consider, is that guilty people (guilty of cheating in your case) always place the blame on the innocent party.  It is a mind game, but it somehow justifies the wrong doer.  <br>  He is hurting you to get you to see that it is over. hench new girlfriend and already starting a new life.  MOVE ON....YOU DON"T NEED THIS HASSLE.<br>  <br>  Counseling, a possible restraining order if he gets violent or harrassing,  and a good lawyer will help.  <br>  |`|Qn9dkQxvaa	I would do my best to ignore them, and keep my mind on other things, fill up your schedule, sit down and plan the next few weeks, from the time you get up, until you go to bed, make sure you don't have any time to think about it, eventually they'll either get over it, or forget it, or y'all will sort it out...plus you need a little "me" time! Also, I'd pray, but if you aren't religious, then I'd read some books on dealing with anger<br>  Hope all is well,<br>   C/SGT Bradley
f4nfRv2xaa	it is natural for u2 2 become friends becoz u both knew the same person.  it was not wrong 2 go out unless they r married & u were aware.  <br>  <br>  he likes u.  2 say he loves u is 2 soon.  love takes time.|`|fc7117280cedb9017461839769b2c21daa	There is an unwritten rule of friends to not date what they've had...it keeps drama like this away, I don't think he loves you, he loves the idea of you, and likes being around you, but somehow I get the sense that since you two are young you're flavor of the week so to speak and if you were in maddy's shoes you'd be yesterday's news...kinda sleazy to break up with your best friend to make the moves on you...a far as the cheating there is an old adage what can be done to one can be done to you remember that|`|ssW1ZK0Caa	It was wrong to date him so quickly. You probably of gave it some time. I don't think I would date a guy that cheated on a close friend. I would look at him and see him kissing another girl.

But if you like the girl and she likes you, I wouldnt take the risk.|`|fjTmlkTJaa	Just don't go over board with this, Don't flirt with her then ignore her for a week, Because that will make her really mad and girls tend to care for attention and girls love attention, So don't just go on flirting with her then ignoring her for a week because she will think somethings going on with you and someone else and she will feel really down if she likes you.|`|lkq8vLxBaa	pfft...not in the real world|`|ut48o0diaa	It depends on the girl.  Personally, if someone ignores me for more than 3 days, I get very irritated and divert my attention towards someone else.  My friend also has a 3 day limit before she erases anything to do with the guy.  To me it means, you're not thinking of me, so why should I care about you.  Do what you want to do, don't listen to the rules society puts on people.  Shoot, I've had guys call me the next day, or right after we both get home from the club, and I would like it.  Then again, if you are dealing with a girl that can't think for herself and listens to all the stupid dating rules out there, then go ahead and ignore her.<br>  <br>  I hope you don't believe that stupid other thing: that if a girl doesn't unlock your car door for you after she gets in the car first, then that means that she is selfish or doesn't care.  This is untrue.

Flirt with her and make her laugh.  Take her on dates, and send texts, call or email her 1 - 2 times a week.  Let her know you are interested, don't ignore, that's annoying.

I can't give you a specific time period that it will take. It all depends. Even after years it might still bother you, but maybe it won't. Maybe you'll find somebody better and forget about it completely. You might hold a grudge though. It depends on the kind of person you are.<br>  <br>  There is hope though. My ex-boyfriend cheated on me and we're friends now. It took a couple years to get over my grudge and for him to apologize, but once that passed everything turned out great. There's absolutely no hard feelings between us and we hang out often. There's hope for you too, it just takes time. Plus, maybe after a certain amount of time you won't even care anymore. You could always feel differently about keeping him as a friend later on.|`|gZcNw1Whaa	in a mutual breakup, i think there is a possibility of staying or becoming friends in the future.  however, feelings and memories don't disappear; boundaries may have to be built and respected; associations can still hurt.  broken hearts don't heal like the rest of our body can.  he hurt you, and you tried to be friends to keep that connection, but if that pain continues to appear around him, maybe you can't be friends for a long time.<br>  <br>  take care of yourself.
K11PVo3vaa	Jealously jealously jealously, I don't know why some people like to see "nice peoples" reactions to their "mean comments", try not to bite, it's your reaction that keeps her comments rolling, if you respond nicely for example, agree with her, say yeah ur right, wish my hair was more like yours, say it so nicely (not sarcastic at all) and she will not know how to respond to you.

dPYBoN7Aaa	All I can say is that love has a funny way of just creepin on you when you least expect it. It doesn't happen because we made it nor forced it. But because it choose you. I understand the situation that is at hand. But what can you do.. A... Go with it until it fades away or gets boring. Maybe its the excitment the thrill thats going on right now. You'll only know as time goes by. And if its still strong and going. Why not take that chance...We only live once in this world and you'll never know if its coming around again... Why chance it...

Jump from one pond to another sort of deal... You need to put the brakes on this one, and tell her straight up she needs to discuss her problems with her husband, not you.  She is investing too much emotion in you when it should be towards her husband.  <br>  <br>  In most cases the person who has an affair does not stay with the person who cheats with them, the cheater is looking for someone to give them strength to leave their partner.<br>  <br>  |`|FDc0n4J3aa	You are infatuated with a married woman. All of your  communication is centered at work, which is not in anyway a normal relationship. You only know one side of her and she is showing you only that. If she is bringing her problems to you, then she is running away from her marriage. Do not allow her to believe that you would be a hero for her.

If you are in love with her then i suggest you get out now.  Women get to a certain age and need attention from the op piste sex.  She most likely will not leave her husband for you.

e35e563de072fa05692e56acda24a6e9aa	It is hard to end a relationship after seven years.  There is the comfort and security factor, however life is too short to be with the wrong one.  Be happy.  Learn to be alone and find out who you are and be thankful you are not married.  You will see that you will be much better off. Besides what if your soul-mate is right around the corner?   You could be with him living a beautiful life, but you  will never know unless you have faith and act brave.  You know what you need to do, otherwise you would not of have asked the question.  Good luck.|`|AA10072732	it is normal for couples to argue a lot. what is important one is willing to forgive/ask for forgiveness and this is the key to a successful relationship. in a relationship, you have to take the good wt the bad.<br>  why not take time out and you two have a vacation,maybe both of you are under a lot of stress and therefore taking it out on each other which is not supposed to be. good luck. |`|X6aYVpU3aa	You are right, no body is perfect. Why does divorce rate now is so high? Because each couple has an options to do it, and instead of solving the problems within them, they look at the other option, divorce. "it is better to remarried a changing person multiple times than marry many times to different person. In relationship, you can't talk and discuss most of the things, there are things you can talk and has to avoid. There should be a moment of quietness for us to gve a thought what is really happenings in marriage. Marriage is more than physical it is more on bonding spiritually to one another. Argument is common for a healthy marriage but we should know the limit of it. We shouldn't argue just because we want to hurt each other but lighten up our sides, it is not important who is good or right, the important is what he is trying to say, is it for goodness of the family or of his own? Do you share with the same goal but in different views and ways?|`|qw7BmBq6aa	I've been with my husband for just over 7 years now.  Relationships take alot of work, ALOT... lol  this is something I am always learning.  No matter how long you'ev been with someone you always have to put in your best effort and not let your guard down.<br>  <br>  You may fight alot, but don't punish him physically.  It is EXTREMELY important to keep up with regular sex.  I cannot stress this one thing enough.  It is your mans base need, something you should be doing minimum 3 times a week.  Men feel connection to their spouse from sex.  When you have sex frequently it brings a couple closer together.  there are going to be times when you don't want to, but trust me just do it and you will always feel better afterwards.<br>  <br>  Keeping intimacy is alot of work also, you always need to do different things and come up with new challenges to keep things heated in the bedroom.  You can try out thigns like:<br>  <br>  1.) make a deal to have sex anywhere but bedroom for a week, and the first one to give in owes the other a massage etc.<br>  <br>  2.) leave your sexy thong in his lunch box for him to find at work ;)<br>  <br>  3.) leave dirty messages hidden in his jeans pocket, his favorite newspaper, behind the car visor.  Be creative!<br>  <br>  4.)  Try wearing some naughty lingerie for him!<br>  <br>  5.) take strip/pole dancing lessons and give him a show :)<br>  <br>  there are so many things you can do to spice up your sex life.    Every relationship no matter how perfect will always have arguments.  Personally I enjoy arguing with hubby, it lets me know there is love and passion and that is why we can get so upset at times.<br>  <br>  Every relationship has it's problems, just remember, you need to put in the effort you used to when you first dated all the time, even when you're both 70!|`|RILO4uMxaa	The 7 Year Itch<br>  <br>  It applies to many relationships, and is statistically the length of time of the average mortgage.<br>  <br>  You either push through this year and see if things improve, or you become another 7 year itch statistic.<br>  <br>  The funny thing is that the 7 year itch has also been statistically proven to apply to an abnormally high proportion of breakdowns in relationships.<br>  <br>  Personally I would push through.....but for no other reson than I hate being a statistic.|`|EWvCRVzBaa	if you are arguing after seven years it will never get better, sorry to say, I would say try to  talking to him let him know how you feel, it you want this relationship to last try counseling, if not I would walk away cause who know what might happen, you see the news folks are going crazy|`|dJ13dBAAaa	People argue, that's normal.

Take care of your needs, and see how good you feel, sometimes we expect others to meet our needs, but sometimes they dont know what our needs are... <br>  <br>  so i want to encourage you, what can you do to take care of yourself? independently from his attitude first, what can you do to make the atmosphere in the house more pleasant for both of you?|`|FDc0n4J3aa	It would be nice instead of arguing if you would just open up and express whats on your heart with this man of yours. It will always be a work in progress. Every man will be that way. Find out how he feels about these certain issues and ask him if he thinks they are a problem. You should also let him know that you are having problems being into him right now. Sounds like you have hit a wall, but it still takes 2 people to argue. Give more than you receive and things will turn around if you really care about this guy.|`|XhXvceg0aa	Hi<br>  <br>  Every marriage goes through the "7 year itch". Married couples are so quick to run to the divorce courts today. Its such a pity because many divorces could be avoided by just working at the marriage harder.  <br>  <br>  You need to make a list of the reasons why you want to stay with your man, make this list as honest as you can. Then, make a list of why you want to split. Ask your man to do the same. Never, ever do this when you are angry with each other.<br>  <br>  Sometimes being this honest can be brutal. You may not want to hear things he has listed, and he may not want to hear things that you have listed. Compare the lists. If you have more reason to stay together, you both need to build on these. If you have reasons that you think you should split, these could be factors that both you and your husband/partner need to work more on.<br>  <br>  Read up on articles on how get the "zazoom" back into your marriage. Just by acknowledging that there are problems, and being willing to work on them, you are already making progress and your marriage could be one of those happy ones where you both grow old together in contentment. So many people could only wish for a truly happy marriage but are not prepared to work at it.<br>  <br>  Remember, a good, strong, happy relationship takes continous work, and in the end its all worth it. You know what you have now, just need a little more excitement and passion which you both can work towards. You never know what is in store for you in the future if you do decide to split. You dont want to do something that you will cry buckets over because of guilt and regret. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  |`|nlFaI0Unaa	I know a lot of people who stay in relationships because of "comfort" and "security" and they're not happy. I find it really really sad because they are wasting their life when they could be out with someone who makes them happy. Life is too short to be in an unhappy relationship. <br>  <br>  If you really love this guy then I say work on the relationship, see if you can get the spark back. Give it about 6 months and if that doesn't work then I say move on. Don't be one of those people who wastes their life away and end up 50 years old looking back at their life with many regrets. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11587827	no u caint break up if you have only been with him for 7yrs, u have to be with him 10yrs thats a law its been passed to cut down on the divorce rate, so suck it up, u have 3 more yrs to go|`|qXCSWQpdaa	No.<br>  <br>  It is long past time to break up.<br>  <br>  Now get to it and quit waisting yours and his time.

d08rkYlpaa	No. The average age when a girl has sex in this country is under 16. I had sex the first time when I was 12, and I do not regret it - it was very special and romantic, and I will treasure it forever. <br>  It is important to prepare enough though - make sure you know enough about sex so you aren't all awkward and uncomfortable. It might seem unpleasant to go looking for sex information, but you need to know. Sex the first time hurts, and you shouldn't do it just because everybody does - do it because you are in love.|`|AA11831936	I don't think the age is as big of a deal as people make it out to be. <br>  I think it is the level of maturity. If it is something talked out and planned for then I think it is okay. If it is unprotected and with a random person then I would say that it is wrong.<br>  <br>  Most adults would say yes, but that is just because they are older and it has been so long since they have been in that predicament.<br>  Kids experiment, at least you are thinking about it before you act. <br>  <br>  And about your class mates doing it, that shouldn't matter. Sex is something between two people who love each other, not between 200 who just want to look cool.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you.|`|Zv8dTjp0aa	only if you ignorent of all the pros and cons to sex, how to protect yourself and your doing it for the right reasons,<br>  <br>  although in my oppione you should wait until your out of school (high school) so you don't mess up your education<br>  <br>  because even protection can fail.<br>  <br>  <br>  to leanr more about sex check out:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://plannedparenthood.org" rel="nofollow">http://plannedparenthood.org</a>|`|E3N016csaa	Sex is not every thing try finding something else to do with your time.<br>  Your mind gets stimulated that way.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	yes its always wrong cause at this age u don't really grasp the concept of how serious it is. the consequences to sex can be a heavy burden. use PROTECTION ALWAYS!|`|uocnuIC1aa	Sex at 15 is looked down upon simply because a person is not mentally mature enough to make the decisions needed to deal with the consequences of sex.

Sit her down and talk to her about it, cuz it seriously sounds like u just wanted to make some money from all this, she SHOULD understand|`|OYnWN2adaa	haha omg how can you NOT see why shes upset!<br>  ok so you have a girlfriend atm and you wrote your EX girlfriend a love poem and wanted you CURRENT gf to publish it, that is soo wrong lol!!! how can you not see that????|`|a0c841138fda9afcee4fa5305f481a18aa	boy, u wrote a poem for YOUR EX! your ex... meaning no longer a part of your love life. meaning thats history. <br>  <br>  you cant ask ur ex to publish it. come on<br>  |`|2GJxvLf8aa	LOL wtf don't you think you?

You didnt say how old you were but I would advise you not to throw your virginity away cuz you can never get it back|`|4WgsBvq1aa	17 but should have waited till after i finished college year 12 (in australia).<br>  Wait till your the right age that you can deal with the consequences of sex noy only the action of doing it.<br>  :) Good Luck|`|XauYxCBOaa	I was 17..Dated the guy for a year and a half and broke up a year and a month ago.

And i'm sure she'll LOVE IT!!!|`|2fW267GMaa	Yeah it is cheezy but hey cheezy works.  Im sure she would really appreciate it.  Its a lot better then doing the ordinary dinner and movie deal that everyone always does.  Go for it.|`|9aEjKzKCaa	no, that actually sounds really romantic:) she's lucky|`|n07zskg8aa	no. that is so cute :)|`|2ZVI4GGcaa	no way do it! so romantic|`|Lo8JPfy9aa	no! that's incredibly romantic and could show you how down to earth she is. if she cant appreciate the beauty of a starry nights sky then shes way too indignant to be with a sweet boy from the sticks.|`|pDmM8m14aa	no. ABSOLUTELY not. Damn come to think of it, i'd wish I'd thought of that before. Do it, it would be hella sexy shed love it.|`|igC1EIPVaa	SO ADORABLE!|`|2sxV424aaa	aw, thats adorable. :)
xODPFIfuaa	It is hard to tell why he disappears for periods of time, but it does sound a lot like he as a woman on his arm. Maybe he doesn't want to upset your friend by bringing her back to the house/apartment. But there could be other reasons. If you are concerned confront him with this. Just ask him how come you are never around. It's quite simple and not to hard to ask. And if his honest it will settle your mind and it will answer most of your questions if you ask him directly. Good luck. And also as long as he is paying the rent, then thats fine.|`|hXeeg3pgaa	yup he sure does|`|BpKHk3aQaa	Yeah it sounds like he has a partner who's house he is staying at... he probably really likes the partner but doesnt want to take the official step of moving in with them so that's why he still keeps his room too but only uses it as a base.|`|iaQfpqcIaa	both|`|jX3MzEPpaa	woman...or he doesnt like staying round the place very much...confront him about it...it may be weird, but you need to ask about it if its on your mind...as a roommate you have to right to now at least when he will be back and be leaving again|`|orLH84nlaa	sounds like he has a girl|`|oL8X9nYKaa	Yeah, he has a woman. Why is it bothering you two? Your roommate now has the place to themselves to do whatever they want. They should take advantage of that.|`|zaCagGRPaa	why does she care ?????|`|h8gILQXZaa	If your roommate is only a roommate and is paying the rent, taking care of his/her share of responsibilities then all should be good in the neighborhood.  <br>  <br>  I do wonder why you care?!|`|ZPkheZRJaa	Does it matter? but yes he probably has a GF|`|DuIv5462aa	I would assume he has a woman that he stays/lives with.|`|qpCZrrzhaa	I would assume he has a woman now. But as long as he's still paying his portion of the bills, who cares if he's never there?|`|bh8I8kAKaa	Sounds to me like he does.|`|rPznrUnxaa	all possibilities come here. we can just guess but it may be wrong. better ask straight to him. what happens if he doesn't like you asking him. don't care and just ask.|`|hYQ7cCmUaa	probably a woman|`|2ZVI4GGcaa	both|`|69CIy3NPaa	Its prob a woman...|`|UZJSyaAmaa	woman :)<br>  why does it matter to you anyway?|`|QNDCh3zlaa	It sounds like another woman.... but try asking where he is going.  Maybe there is a good explanation.... or maybe not....|`|k04WNpUoaa	yea a woman..|`|zpt994Mwaa	woman and doesnt wanna hurt your friends feelings|`|hD5zAyZhaa	Sounds like he has a girl/boy|`|6z1WrOuFaa	why the hell does it effect you?|`|RDxwA15kaa	Probably a woman.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	Woman|`|by77NPbTaa	i don't think you should get in the middle of this|`|8ZUVToXgaa	I'm wondering why you want to know to.<br>  <br>  Are you interested?<br>  <br>  It sounds like he just keeps his life private. <br>  <br>  I don't know him so I can't say for sure.|`|E3O2Gi0Uaa	woman...thx for answering mine|`|pdbc4souaa	Would you like to talk about it over coffee?|`|92yiQo7uaa	Definitely he has a girlfriend. The roommate is only to keep costs down. He'd rather not have the roommate so when he goes with his girl he is somewhere better. If your really asking if your friend will likely have to replace this roommate who is now shacking up, I would say yes. Within the next several months he will move out to be with his girl--give it 6 months. Your friend should start scouting possible replacements in the near future so he'll be prepared when he gets the news that his roommate is leaving.|`|9b8fa166dc569bc5bbfc609864036c7daa	yeah, it does to me. Why dont you just ask the guy?|`|ODvwza53aa	He could be in a relationship with someone, but that's not a big deal if he's only your friend's roommate, so why do you care?|`|AA12038417	Could be both.  Very hard to tell from just that.  I would say more likely a woman.|`|AA12226426	I don't know but it's a possibility.|`|H0JnT2Epaa	woman|`|dV1W99Gqaa	or maybe he's just really busy volunteering at the local nursing home....|`|xUsmcx0raa	i guess a woman
RL9wZs3Iaa	There is not absolute sure way to tell, but usually it depends on how your boyfriend acts around you normally. If he likes getting physical (multiple kisses, grabs, etc) instead of talking to you, he most likely is out to "get some."|`|uXjb9yMYaa	Well if have you kissed him yet? if you havent then maybe u should.lol and if he might say sometihng that will tell you yhe answer good luck!|`|n5gcrmkCaa	all guys just want some...depends how fast he's taking things...its good ur aware of this btw<br>  <br>  if ur not ready don't feel pressured into doing anything...<br>  <br>  look for signs of how he expresses that he likes u...<br>  <br>  subtle hints...like when ur sitting does he sit close 2 u with his leg slightly touching urs...etc,etc,<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|b1ikC4AGaa	hmmmmmm.............. mabey you should sit down and have a talk with him alone. Make sure its completely serious and stare him straight in the eye. If hes looking away, then theres something wrong, if he looks back at you, its smooth sailing|`|KV66KhVRaa	Take thing slow tell him you are waiting for marriage to have sex. He might still try but stand your ground and see if he sticks around.|`|uO0oiWN4aa	Give him some and see what happenes. If you are asking then you are unsure and if you are unsure then you are not to involved might as well find out now rather then wait and get attatched
RL9wZs3Iaa	Make the move, and sit next to him at the lunch table, saying how it sucks that you two aren't in that class anymore, and just take it on from there. It's not a weird thing to do, so you should be okay. Good luck :)|`|Tf19RETiaa	go over to the table and say hi!
HFqiY6BGaa	Give her a note instead saying you want to go do something.|`|ZQWEgFZ2aa	I know exactly how you feel. Try making small talk with her, ask her how was her day or simply say hi! Just keep doing this until you're comfortable talking to her in person. Eventually you'll feel more confident and then you should ask her out. Don't rush into asking her out if you aren't comfortable talking to her. Hope this helps, good luck!|`|fJ8cdPgHaa	Ok, so heres the deal. I know being around the one you like can make you really nervous and its really hard to bite the bullet and let them know whats up, but you dont know if you dont try. Its better to say too much than not say anything at all. I think if a guy likes me, I would like to know. Just talk to her as friends so you can get to know her  and learn her interests. Then, once your friends, then it can progress to something more :)|`|cFMprHwjaa	aw thats cute,<br>  but girls never like shy guys. because once in a relationship she might get annoyed that she has to make all the moves bc your to shy. just buck up and approach her. once you start talking youll feel more relaxed to ask her out. be casual, dont make it akward.|`|piDZfVHVaa	Dude... it seems like your maybe too serious about this. Just calm down and dont think too much about about her looks. Try to get her to talk with you. If you cant do this, you can try to talk with her without looking at her by doing something else like writing or while fixing something. hope this helps :)|`|GNc5wMEDaa	You should practice asking her out. Like ask a friend or picture yourself asking her out with all the confidence.<br>  <br>  Can you please answer mine?|`|KONMQPuDaa	text or email or myspace her

b3zGfYMpaa	I dont know what her intentions are? She could want a hook-up, she could just be teasing..I dont know. Either way taking this friendship to anything more than just that is going to create a world of drama for you! If she really likes you than what is she doing with this other guy? She was waiting for you to be single, but now shes trying to have her cake and eat it too. If you mess around with this girl..eventually the other guy will find out. You need to decide whether this is worth all those issues or not. And keep in mind, if  you want a relationship with her, this is by no means the way of getting it. If shes willing to cheat on someone with you, what would make you think she wouldnt do the same to you. Put yourself in the other guy's shoes..how would you feel? Dont be the lesser man and make this mistake. Just ask her what she wants, but if I had to guess I dont even think she knows and until she does I wouldnt pursue anything else.|`|sS5Fq9KCaa	dude she is effing with your mind!<br>  i bet she got some sort of bet going on...<br>  if thats not the case she is a whore cause she got a bf and wants your junk.....|`|kEy3W5ydaa	one playa teasing another playa and she doesn't feel commited to either guy but is looking for betta|`|H60E0wvuaa	sounds like she wants to|`|vWKQJhwRaa	just flirting playa :D|`|CLOtMCwSaa	Ask her flat out when your going to get together, and where.

Having realistically recognized others' kindness as well as their faults, love is always focused on the other person’s welfare. We have no ulterior motives to fulfill our self-interest or to fulfill our desires; we love others simply because they exist. Attachments exaggerates others' good qualities and makes us crave to be with them. When we're with them, we're happy but when we're separated from them, we are miserable. These attachments are linked with expectations of what others should be or do. Is love as it is usually understood in most societies really love? Let's examine this a bit more. Generally we are attracted to people either because they have qualities we value or because they help us in some way. If we observe our own thought processes carefully - we'll notice that we look for specific qualities in others. Some of these qualities we find attractive, others are those our parents, or society value. We examine someone's looks, education, financial situation, social status. This is how most of us decide on whether or not the person holds any true value to us. In addition, we judge people as worthwhile according to how they relate to us. If they help us, make us feel secure, listen to what we have to say, care for us when we are sick, we consider them good people and it is this type of people we are most likely to be more attracted to. But this is very biased, for we judge them only in terms of how they relate to us, as if we are the most important person in the world. After we've judged certain people to be good for us, whenever we see them it appears to us as if goodness is coming from them, but if we are more aware, we recognize that we have projected this goodness onto them. Desiring to be with the people who make us feel good, we become emotional yo-yo's - when we're with these people, we're up, when we're not with these people, we're down. Furthermore, we form fixed concepts of what our relationships with those people will be and thus have expectations of them. When they do not live up to our expectations of them, we're disappointed, or may become angry. We want them to change so that they will they will match what we think they are. But our projections and expectations come from our own minds, not from the other people. Our problems arise not because others aren't who we thought they we're, but because we mistakenly thought they were something they aren't. Checklist: "I Love You if __________ " What we call love is most often attachments. It is actually a disturbing attitude that overestimates the qualities of another person. We then cling to tightly to that person, thinking our happiness depends on that person. Love, on the other hand, is an open and calm, relaxed attitude. We want someone to be happy, and free from suffering simply because they exist. While attachments are uncontrolling and too sentimental. Love is direct and powerful. Attachments obscure our judgment and we become impatient, angry, and impartial, helping only our dear ones and harming those who we don't like. Love clarifies our minds and we access a situation by thinking of the greatest good for everyone. Attachments are based on selfishness, while love is founded upon cherishing others, even those who do not look very appealing to the eyes. Love looks beyond all the superficial appearances. If we see unattractive, dirty, ignorant people, we feel repulsed because our minds want to know attractive, intellectual, clean and talented people. Love recognizes that regardless of the others' appearances, their experience is the same as ours: they wish to be happy, to be free from sufferings, and to do their best to avoid problems. When we're overly attached to a person, we're not mentally and emotionally free. We overly depend on and cling to the person to fulfill our mental and especially our emotional needs. We fear losing the person, feeling we'd be incomplete without him. However, this does not mean that we should suppress our emotional needs or become aloof, alone and totally independent, for that too does not solve the problem. We must simply realize our unrealistic needs, and slowly seek to eliminate them. Some emotional needs may be so strong that they can't be dissolved immediately. If we try to suppress them or pretend they do not exist, we become anxious and insecure. In this case, we can do our best to fulfill our needs while simultaneously working gradually to subdue them. The core problem is that most of us seek to be loved, rather than to love. We yearn to be understood by others rather than to understand them. In all honesty, our sense of emotional insecurities comes from the selfishness obscuring our own minds. We 'can' develop self-confidence by recognizing our inner potential to become a selfless human being with many magnificent qualities, then we'll develop a true and accurate feeling of self-confidence. And then we'll seek to increase love - without attachments, to increase compassion, to cultivate lovingkindness, patience, compassion, generosity, understanding and wisdom. Under the influence of attachments we're bound by our emotional reactions to others. When they are nice to us, we're happy. When they ignore us or speak sharply to us, we take it personally and are unhappy. But pacifying these attachments doesn't mean we become hard-hearted. Rather, without attachments there will be space in our hearts and minds for genuine impartial love for them. We'll be actively involved with them. As we learn to subdue our selfish attachments, we can have successful friendships and personal relationships with others. These relationships will be richer because of the freedom and respect which the relationships will be based on. However, our lifestyles and interests may be more compatible with those of some people more so than with others and that is alright. In any case, our relationships will be based on mutual love, mutual interests, and the wish to help each other in life".|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Move on . She is getting a shellacking from another man.|`|AA11803994	The problem with a lot of marriages today is communication. TELL her that you love her and that you are sorry that you have not been there to fulfill her needs for time and attention from you. TELL her that you want to save your marriage. You fell in love with her and married her....go back to the basics of what happened when you first met. Show her as much attention as when you were dating her and trying to win her heart. Marriage takes work and I commend you for even posting this question and trying to make your marriage work.<br>  <br>  Another problem in marriages, especially if you have been married for a long time, is it's hard to keep it romantic and interesting. The key to a good marriage is you WORKING at it. Romance doesn't come easy after 5 years of marriage. Communicating your needs to your spouse doesn't just happen. You have to work at it.<br>  <br>  Women want to be valued by their husbands and they want to feel like their husbands desire to be with them and spend time with them.<br>  <br>  When you have kids that means less time for husband and wife, but don't feel bad for planning a special weekend away from the kids. Happy parents means a happy home. <br>  <br>  It sounds like your wife needs some major TLC from you. Women are easy, though. Do nice things for your wife, make her feel appreciated by saying thank you when she cooks dinner. Get serious about her and what she means to you and she will get serious about you. Marriage is a wonderful thing between a man and a woman. Treasure your wife and honor her to the best of your ability and God will take care of the rest.<br>  <br>  I'll tell you a great movie to watch is FireProof. <a href="http://www.fireproofthemovie.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fireproofthemovie.com/</a><br>  It is a Christian movie but whether you are a Christian or not, it really speaks about how to salvage a marriage and really work to not only keep it together but to make it grow. It's a romantic movie and it's funny as well. If you just show your wife that you care-that you REALLY care-about how she is feeling, you would be surprised at her response. <br>  <br>  Rent the movie FireProof and watch it together. Fireproof your marriage. Good luck!!! :)|`|vp4xjqbLaa	so you have forgiven her for the affair? and her excuse for the affair is that you weren't there for her? if so....START A NEW DAY NEW PAGE!<br>  Tell her this by taking her out to dinner a nice romantic dinner or cook her a nice candle lit dinner at home.<br>  Start by resolving any issues that made her feel you weren't there for her...listen well...and try and change that if you can.<br>  Look back to when you first fell in love with eachother and try and remember the things that you did that made her laugh..smile...and feel loved.<br>  But she too needs to gain your trust again and not have an affair when ever she feels that your not giving her the attention she seeks.<br>  Tell her to come to you and tell you how she feels more often because some men don't purposely neglect their wife its just work,stress,life in general that can have an affect on how a man behaves in marriage.<br>  Just try and be what she needs you to be at this point in her life and LISTEN...always listen that is the main key.GOOD LUCK|`|AA11315360	Take a look at a book (i forget the title) with a 40 day love challenge.

5XERNFogaa	If you really want him to stop, you just have to calm down about it. He just wants a reaction out of you. I know people say that all the time, but it's the truth. A total jerk in my class today was trying to get me to talk to him, but I just ignored him, and he went away, so it works... Try not to respond, and be serious when talking back to him, or telling him to stop it. You may not get what I mean, but you know that voice us girls can use, that's really tired sounding and sweet and exasperated that we use when we've had enough and just want someone to cut it out? Try that. Boys pick up on it right away. It'll sound like you're having a bad day, and he should back off, if he has a brain in his head.<br>  <br>  And just saying, he probably does like you. That's just the way boys act around pretty girls, really immature and bug them a lot. <br>  <br>  Sorry that was soooooo long. But be firm with him, and hopefully it'll work! Good luck! :)|`|76cAAPfBaa	Nope, I think he does like you, and wants your attention. He keeps it up, because he gets a reaction, and any reaction is good for him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ignore him totally. Don't even acknowledge his presence, and he'll most likely eventually give up.|`|qp9RfkARaa	if his dad said that he likes you he most likely talks about at his house and he might "like" you have you told him to stop and ignoring him?|`|jbIvIsTpaa	belive me he likes you! <br>  goodluck!|`|TE4spiLtaa	Get him to like you.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Tell him that from now on he is to leave you alone and not to talk to you. Be firm. If he tries to talk to you, ignore him, walk away, and if necessary, tell the teacher that he will not leave you alone.|`|GTja6ouWaa	I think your sis is telling the truth if the boys father is her princepal.
sIJ6jxNdaa	i am not 100% sure that he likes you but i think 50% he likes you and 50% he like you only as a friend if you were not like best fiends i would say that he likes you try to find out by your friends if he really likes you|`|xkMadpW5aa	okay, same situation...i've been friends with my best guy friends for 5 years and i like him and i trust him with everything except that i cant tell him i like him...even your name has bball in it, and i'm like the bball girl in my town, lol.<br>  anyway, the examples you provided alone don't show that you like him, but if you think that he's sending out a vibe that he likes you, go for it!|`|zXpbfBcuaa	just stay frends unless he tries 2 pick dat conversation wit u<br>  <br>  <br>  trust me once u hav dat conversation u will no ur anser|`|osZ5zVEDaa	The only way to know is to ask. Be honest and put yourself out there. You may get burned, but at least you will know and not have to anquish over this.|`|yyvcryrbaa	yes it does.|`|2hXteNxOaa	I say go up and ask him. But make sure he won't freak out first,
eCKNRcIVaa	Yes I got back together with my boyfriend that I had form the time I was 19 to 22 then we broke up,  we got back together when I was 27 we got married and guess what - now we are divorced.  So, obviously it didn't work for us.|`|4qil1bb8aa	Yea. I think that it's possible, you might still have feelings for him, and if that's the case, don't give up.
0v7Msiznaa	Hiya paul hope your well.<br>  <br>  i would suggest the following go out with herself next week and see how you get on with her.  if the chemistry is good and your having a laugh.  Than see how you get on over the night if she asks or you ask about going up for a coffee or a night cap than go for it.  Your both adults so just go for it and have fun.<br>  <br>  hey if you do have a good time you dont need to explain to yourself to others so go for it and have fun ;-) and dont forget to use protection|`|NZg4hIrYaa	it seems you are both using each other for fun, have a go if you wanna.  you should be clear about what you done and have protection, good luck|`|TyFBrelcaa	You said so yourself she wants sex ,kind of using you but if you want the same thing go ahead but if it's serious don't take her out|`|zGgUsEmdaa	If you're over legal age, go for it. x|`|jIeQlIq2aa	well, your both looking for the sex so i don't see why you shouldn't-do it and have some fun? if it doesn't work-it's only a ome night stand-what have you got to lose?|`|ai33g11Maa	You sound like a real gent.  Go crazy.|`|1b40b411fde105efac034d33b5f3fdeeaa	As long as you are both consenting to a night of fun, i say go for it!!!!!!|`|WFFXHFfVaa	Well depending on whether your both of legal age, and your both only looking for no strings, dont see why not.
5skL2HJxaa	Get home around 5:30 to 6 PM.  Talk to my daughter and see how school is going.  Listen to her telling me about her friends.  (single father)  We go to the gym and workout, stay there until 8:30 to 9 PM.  Grab some dinner on the way home, watch the local news or something on the DVR.  Go to bed.|`|crKCWOxXaa	Dinner then from there we might either watch tv or even a movie then from there we spend about half an hour to an hour telling each other about our day mostly me telling him since I am home all day being that I am in college I only work weekends.|`|a5jwMmZQaa	Get home at 6 pm - Prepare dinner for the family - Watch evening news on TV - have dinner with the family - check emails- check calendar of activities for the following day -take a shower - read book - pray and then sleep at 11 pm.|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	Home, gym, dinner, shower, sleep|`|fB2vdKtSaa	i go home, sort my animals out, cook dinner, have a bath/shower watch tv have a drink and generally sit and think 'is this it'!! lol and then go to bed only to have to do it all again the next day!!|`|5d9211d38d6935bc0d08850b222ec434aa	most nights, it's like this: drive home, grab the mail, get inside, take off coat/accessories, walk around the house turning on some lights/tv, get a glass of water, do a workout routine/or play computer games while I wait for the hubby to get home, then we cook dinner together and eat, then we clean up and watch tv together and sometimes play a game of some kind (Chess, yahtzee etc.), chitchat with him, then set up the coffee for the next morning, set the alarm, and go to sleep.
B0y9aO1Laa	This is a bad situation because she has a boyfriend so she is probably not interested in other guys right now.  But keep being her friend maybe in the future when she's single you could approach her and ask her out.<br>  <br>  Like I said it's a bad situation only because she has a boyfriend but its not that bad.  From one to ten its probably like 6.
da3f31f0285fe3fe3296aa9f25dca37eaa	Basically, if you are a Christian, you should wait on the Lord to bring you the right woman.  That will happen in His time not yours.  Your job is to pray and ask for God to bring that person into your life and trust that it will happen.  When it does, you will know, and it will be right.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	Based on personal experience, I think you could go as young as 25, maybe, depending upon maturity. My husband was 39 and I was 25 when we married.|`|fYwrSBB0aa	You should at least be married one time by the age of 39. Who wants to wait that late.|`|vhuqAqNdaa	if your 39 you should be already married.|`|PnE35NZlaa	about 28 and over|`|yDJiiqcsaa	29 or above.

Maybe its just a guy thing to be attractive 2 this or its a personal thing. Other wise u might have a foot fetish!:) who knows maybe its just u!|`|dU1rHcGraa	I do that sometimes, when wearing flats. It is just natural, and fun to do, I guess.|`|TemZzSuCaa	I catch myself doing it from time to time but I didn't know someone thought it would be attractive (:|`|VP7KAe12aa	i do that why?!:S.|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	I can't say I know why you like it so much, but when I'm wearing flats or other shoes i can slip my heels out of, I do that all the time.

S749Bbp9aa	first off i am a guy.<br>  and i think loves is a feeling like you could spend every single day with someone. Like you never want to leave their side. That no matter what they do, no matter how mad they make you, you still have strong feelings for them and don't want to go a day without them. You find yourself missing them at weird times. and when you start thinking about someone or something they find their way into your thoughts. Someone that you have an urge to be with in every way possible, You want to please them in the most intimate and the most simple of ways. Not like just having sex with them. Making love with them, Making them feel as amazing and completely pleased in every way.|`|i47AGNpJaa	Love is having a good wife and mother of my children.  Love is also being listened to and having my orders followed.  Love is also a dinner that isn't cold on the table after an 8 hour transatlantic flight.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean really, I call you on the way home from the airport.  Just put the dinner in the oven and heat it up.  What?  You think you are busy and stressed from your day at the insurance office?  Do you think flying a metal tube full of high-octane jet fuel and 200 passengers at 35,000 feet over an expansive body of freezing cold water is a picnic?  What part of that DON'T you understand???<br>  <br>  God Bless-<br>  <br>  Captain Art Griego|`|YRUf6BoWaa	i am a girl and i think loveis something so wonderful you couldnt explain it with words and i know this even though ive never really fell in love|`|aUDVBmZSaa	Love is something or someone that you have a bond with and makes you happy, such as loving to dance or loving your mom.|`|ToIBDOgnaa	I'm the guy half of this poll, and the following describes love for me:<br>  <br>  Everyone is a little weird.  Life is weird.  When two people's weirdness is compatible, they fall into a mutual weirdness, and they call it love.<br>  <br>  Love is a totally uncontrollable and unconditional feeling of affection toward another person or thing.|`|eDP3YU5Laa	I think love is When you think about someone so much and cant stop<br>  thinking about them! dream about them! gets jealous when girls are talking to ur man! when you care about them :)|`|EjyD1sXeaa	love is when you'll do anything for anyone unconditionally<br>  <br>  I love my husband completely<br>  from the top of my head down to my feetly<br>  <br>  I couldn't have sex without feeling a love for my partner

AA11803994	My husband used to love to play volleyball every Sunday....ALL DAY....and it started to get on my nerves a little bit. I was thinking of all the things he needed to be doing or helping me with and I wanted him to have fun but I resented him for always leaving me with the kids or not staying home looking for a better job (he was working on getting a better paying job). I calmly sat him down one day and I explained to him how I felt and that he was going to have to decide what was important to him. He needed to figure out what his priorities were. I wanted him to know that I loved him very much and I was all for him getting out and having fun sometimes - but not every Sunday, and not when he needed to get a better job. I made sure he knew I was supportive of him and his love for sports but I wanted him to be supportive of his family and not get so involved when there were more important things that needed his attention. My husband very rarely plays volleyball now because he got a better job and doesn't have as much time but when he does want to go play...I definitely support him and come and watch him because he put his family first.<br>  <br>  I really recommend talking to your husband. Guys have a tendency to get focused on one thing. That's where women come in and make them aware that there are several things that need his attention. He sounds like he was sorry he got so caught up in the game, but don't go to bed mad and don't think that he knows what he did wrong. Tell him your concerns and why you are upset and make sure you do it in a loving way. It may take you telling him two or three times, but he'll get it and if you are still supportive of him watching his games, he'll most likely be more supportive of you, even if he is watching the tube. Best of luck!! :)|`|p75ZEmjXaa	I have a feeling that if you and I were together we'd both be a lot happier.
DabYmHt7aa	mate dont worry about it. it ll be old news on monday it isnt that bad you had your reasons i will tell you sumit embarresing happened to me a couple of weeksago i had a testicle operation embarrising i no and the teacher told everyone everybody laughted at me and stuff like that next day something new was on the agender so happens to everyone i dont care about people laughting about my problem now lol gud luck mate|`|073ad2ba60d8cf71ef3514ad2f5a92eaaa	I had the same experience, every time I remember I scream lowly and I say AH in my language doesnt mean sigh it's a show of anger. I press my teeth hardly. SOme while after I thought that yes it happened and it shouldnt have happened. But I suffered it at that time and situation once and repeated the suffer and anger and sadness several times. Why should I bother myself more. Yes it was annoying but 10 times remebering it was enough. Doesnt worth more than that.<br>  get rid of the memory.|`|9jddst2gaa	yo man don;t worry about what other people think as long as you know that your situation is 100x harder than theirs.  every guy cries once in a while and its ok some thinkgs in life aren't worth worrying about and this is one of them.  If you dont want to tell people why you were crying then they will eventually just forget <br>  <br>  keep on|`|VP7KAe12aa	God yes I would! Espically if the teacher did what yours did. <br>  Sorry about you getting embarassed.<br>  Add me as a friend if you want.<br>  Rebekka|`|uQrIdrjfaa	that sucks. u should stop crying...its dum u dum emo|`|G6JXHvZKaa	HEY WE ALL HAVE A TIME WHEN WE CALLED AT THE WRONG TIME DON,T MAKE A DEAL ABOUT IT NICK JUST SHUCK IT OFF  BE HAPPY MUSIC FREAK  KM|`|XRn0Ai3Naa	Who gives a hell what other people think hell with them.|`|2nMkDyDqaa	random...|`|fBXRNKyuaa	What got you so upset???????
15Uz3lO2aa	Make a list of things he should be doing. Holding her, Playing with her, Feeding her, Changing her.. and anything else you can think of. <br>  <br>  For every time he does something, go to your list and put a check mark next to it. <br>  <br>  Around her first birthday, (maybe not ON her bday), show him the list, and say something like, "She's too young to remember her life right now, but do you think this is a good pattern for a healthy father-daughter relationship?"<br>  <br>  This will let him know that he still has time to fix it. That's important!<br>  <br>  Don't say it in an attacking way, say it in an honest, concerned way... and leave it at that. He'll be able to see for himself that he's gotta step it up a notch, without you yelling at him about "not spending enough time with her", because honestly, men never listen to that speech... They just take that as you not being understanding of their work and social commitments.|`|zMzuR9SQaa	hey, i wouldnt get to worried about it, maybe he just doesnt appreciate your daughter enough yet? it's a shame it didnt all go perfectly well but you know, not alot does. you could talk to him and ask him to do his fair share of nappy changing etc.. maybe he will see what goegeous daughter he has and want to hold her play with her etc..|`|8fEeyNMeaa	I would run home just to see my newborn. You knew what you gettting into guys don't change over night. Hopefully he just doesn't like new borns and will show more interest when she gets older. I hope your not over exagerating my wife accused me of never being home. Which i wasn't but I WAS AT WORK MAKING MONEY TO FEED MULTIPLE MOUTHS HELLO.|`|8f25aSY1aa	is the boxing what makes the income in the home? guess thats the hazards of that profession if so..but he should pay more attention to his family confront him and see what he says"! Tell him how you feel ,does he even know what you feel?  once you have told him how you feel and he doesn't respond well with it then he may never ..<br>  But thing is , no not all men are that way..keeping it to yourself isn't solving it..only you know him we can not say what will happen or the exact way to deal with him..Maybe ask Dr. Phil.<br>  GOOD LUCK|`|qfJmQJheaa	No.All Men Are Not Like this,He Has IssueS Going on BUT he also needs to see and talk and play with hi daughter A LOT more.u should sit down with him.have a talk about your feelings and say."look,u havnt talked or fed or done ANYTHING with ur daughter, and im sick of it.u NEED to do this"and so on.exchange feelings and talk for a good hour and a half or two.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	He may be afraid that he will injure the time.  Work him into her schedule.  Like today, you will feed________.  And stay there with him when he does.  Tomorrow, you will change a diaper.  Often, they don't want you to know how much out of their depth they are with a child.  Just holding one can be intimidating.  Only women know that we don't everything about babies.  Men expect us to know this stuff.  They never thought that they should know it too.<br>  <br>  Have a sit down with him about it and put it in his schedule.|`|eCKNRcIVaa	All I can say is no not all men are like that, in fact most are not.  That is very very sad for you and your daughter
YhKBmy2Taa	definitly not if its your first date.|`|W89kmvxjaa	First - is this your first date? If so, I wouldn't go for the Public display of affection thing<br>  <br>  Second - Is she a shy girl?

8FbOtXAXaa	I would love to be in Hawaii. I have never been there and it is cold right now where I live.

48W167cBaa	Maybe while they're hanging out (i'm guessing they talk at school?) he should ask her if she feels like hanging out during the weekend. Maybe they could watch a movie at your house, or at hers. He could write her out a sweet note, asking her out towards the end. He should loosen up some! If he really likes her, he'll find the nerve to ask her. He will. :)<br>  <br>  In 7th grade, there's really not much you can do- words of encouragement to him also help- cheer him on. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, and your brother!|`|UlXZdcW7aa	hello whoever[ name of kid of course][be bold and timid] woud it be proper to ask you to a movie, with your parents permissin, or for a walk, or to the zoo.

8YfYh3y0aa	I swear, I just don't understand how guys can be sooooooo clueless.  <br>  Let me keep this simple.  Yes, she likes you. <br>  <br>  Why do you think you should go from hardly talking to her to asking her out?  You need to talk to her, boy.  TALK.   Texting, or IM'ing or anything like that is no substitute for actually talking to her.  You need to get her alone, and spend some time talking face to face.  Just make small talk....talk about school or your brother or college or family.....just TALK.   And listen to what she says.  Be kind, and be respectful.   And stop relying so much on your friends for advice with girls.  They seem as cluless as you.
vja4ddNmaa	I can only help you within the context of writing suggestions. You cannot make him (nor anyone else) happy. I very strongly suggest (italicized and bold) that you realize this now.    He is moving on... and there is nothing you can do to stop him. I suggest again instead of focusing on this issue that you focus on your self-esteem issue. Also, get as much education as you can (that is one thing that can never be taken away from you.)    About the child... I cannot comment because I am parenting no one.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Focus on "you" first.  It is great you are going to school.  Keep going.  Do not have another child.  The more kids you have the more likely he is to leave and the harder it will be for you to find someone else.      Find time to give your baby long (3-4 mile) walks in the stoller every day.  The exercise and fresh air will cheer you up.      Get rid of the junk food in your house, exercise and eat healthy and you really will feel better over time.|`|wZYPFtL9aa	thats bad if ur 16 and he already isnt intreseted,     maybe you could take him out to dinner, movies, cook for him, show him he means more to you then just the sex,    hope that helped|`|lGS1zOd6aa	clean the house|`|AA11280073	You married too young and he is looking around.

4HoVVCenaa	My best friend was killed by the police when I was 23. (He was a messed up war vet... probably suicide by cop. ) You have to allow yourself to go through the grieving process. It takes about a year, more or less. I can't remember the steps but it is something like anger, denial, grief, and acceptance. You might want to see a minister or grief counselor. Talk about your feelings with a trusted friend. Don't be afraid to cry or rage. It takes awhile. I used to visit the cemetery a lot and just look at headstones and walk. My sympathies to you.

oXNgstLYaa	I'm kind of doing the same thing for my wedding, but I am just putting little baskets in the restrooms. We are putting item that people tend to need, but often don't carry around with them. Things like, hairspray, wet naps, smelly spray for him and her, feminine hygiene products, lotion, stuff like that. But if it is going to be in their room waiting for them, you could make it more personal by adding a fun magazine, if you know their favorite candy, a "thanks for sharing in our special day" card, different toiletries(shampoo, lotion, etc), toothbrush and paste in case they forgot theirs. I'm not sure how much you were wanting to spend on each basket, but atleast there are some ideas to get ya started! Good luck, and Congrats:0)|`|SuMwWNfyaa	Candy<br>  <br>  not crap candiee<br>  <br>  <br>  as in<br>  <br>  nice chocolates =]<br>  <br>  <br>  flowers possibly<br>  <br>  <br>  thank you cards<br>  <br>  <br>  nice licorice and other sweets =]<br>  <br>  <br>  cookies.those soft chewy chocolate chip ones.<br>  <br>  and if you put that stuff in it,but theres alot of empty space in the baskest,just put some of that "easter" grass in like,a white color in it.|`|msLHOKrmaa	candy.|`|pub2GLZPaa	We are having the same type of wedding!

This is also a great place to include relevant information for your wedding guests - phone numbers for the families, other guests staying at the hotel, a wedding itinerary, nearby attractions and local maps. <br>  <br>  Also consider including items that are reflective of your wedding location. Use your wedding welcome baskets as a creative way to tie everything together and introduce guests, many of them visiting for the first time, to the area. Getting married in Maine? Throw in some maple syrup! Or Texas - how about a miniature cowboy hat or a packet of spicy chili mix? You get the idea....Use this opportunity to be creative, and make your wedding a memorable event - from arrival to departure|`|JgT3k7Ocaa	why?  b+b's are notoriously good at providing all manner of little things for their guests - don't be worrying about this when you have lots of other things to get ready!  your guests will survive without a basket from you kiddo. no favors, no baskets, nothing~now have a great wedding.|`|he0GbZT3aa	here is some good ones in a video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYiHvFzZ1jc&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYiHvFzZ1...</a>|`|pxuDr2T4aa	fruit baskets accessories basket candy baskey flower basket thank you basket|`|R4YYdgmcaa	How about things they can use on their trip home, or while they are at the bed and breakfast.

It'd suck for your current bf though, but if the chemistry's not there, then too bad.<br>  <br>  See the thing is, girls don't appreciate the things guys do only when their gone, they begin to realize how important their guy is. This happened to me so I know.
kyTBaYFlaa	lol, after you show her the contract nothings gonna happen|`|ev33OxJbaa	No, since most sex related crimes are from men, I carry a loaded gun because the law will not do anything if your about to get raped by some creep who had too much to drink and thinks you owe him something in return.|`|AcgDcQG0aa	A contract is only as good as the law that respects it.  And I don't think a sex-contract is going to get much respect either from the police or in a court of law.<br>  <br>  The law is always more important than any contract.  And if there is some contradiction between the law and the contract.  Then that part of the contract is automatically null and void as far as the law is concerned.<br>  <br>  If you feel that having sex in your country is too risky in terms of possible accusations and trouble with the law.   Then either abstain from sex and be celibate like a monk.  Or go once in a while to a freer country for some trouble-free fun with the willing ladies there.|`|IQ3pERJOaa	that's just wrong.<br>  <br>  if you have sex with someone you should take the responsibilities that some with it.!|`|lbt0ayPuaa	WTF THIS IS RETARDED|`|G3emC90haa	what the hell.|`|TAMGy07Daa	Never actually heard of one!|`|bZCSRu8Iaa	No i never n im waiting for a such person|`|sSAx3Gitaa	...you're weird...

697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	ask him|`|AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|InlBfPM9aa	hmm if he isn't being as open and nice to you then it does show a sign that hes not interested but he said your the first to like him so maybe hes just unsure if he wants to jump into a relationship yet. id talk to him about it yourself thats the best thing to do hope this helps!|`|Ixae0HsAaa	he is playing hard to get ask him out

7CKipTZOaa	Your dress sounds lovely and pale pink would look great as a color. White lights would be beautiful, if you are worried about decorating the tent, assemble a team of friends, I'm sure they would be more than willing to help.  If you really can't find any cherry blossoms from vendors, there are lots of alternatives, you could do origami cherry blossoms  http://theflirtyguide.com/tfg_everyday/c...    or brown sticks with pink blooms intertwined throughout them , ie orchids http://www.onesourceweddings.net/recepti...|`|wZYPFtL9aa	wow, my mom is having the same problem, her wedding is may 8 and has the same color dress as you, shes doing A latte color as the off set in the flowers and invatations and bridesmaid dresses, maybe you could do something like that?    just an idea    congrrats and good luck|`|tvUAO4ioaa	Since it is outside, why not do a pale pink and light green color scheme and a flower theme. Something like this for centerpieces:    http://www.lillianrose.com/sitefiles/Ima...|`|KIfkzdIJaa	Pale pink is a great color for that time of year. Lillies could work as a theme, too, if cherry blossoms won't work.     If the Christmas lights (twinkle lights, my mom used to call them) don't work, maybe some white/champagne/pink/red Chinese lanterns would work. When I coordinated my friends' wedding I hung about 45 Chinese lanterns around their tent and it was beautiful.     Decorating the tent shouldn't be that difficult - there are enough supports to hang things from. If you stick with Christmas lights, use icicle lights since you'll get more bang for your buck.|`|di6p10Ifaa	your wedding sounds very similar to mine!! outdoors, may, tent, your gown is the same colors as mine!! Okay to decorate the tent I am having large peices of fabric draped from each corner to the middle and a chandelier in the middle of the tent. We are doing the christmas lights in the top of the tent as well but they will be under the fabric twinkleing through. You can also use tuelle in the top of the tent. For the colors you could go with pale pink and champage like on your gown. My colors are light green and champagne and a very tiny bit of deep pink, only in the flowers.       http://www.creativeconceptsevents.com/fi...    http://www.rentandevent.com/images/Illum...    http://festivitiesmn.com/images/CIMG1400...    pink and champagne wedding    http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_oZuFDni50Qs/Rz...        Hope this helps
FXCoGD44aa	I'm thinking that you haven't actually met this person, and therefore you have no grounds to actually be "in love" with him.<br>  <br>  He probably isn't an old pervert, but that doesn't mean that everything he is telling you and/or showing you is the truth either. While the internet is a great way to meet new people, the fact is that you really don't know if what they are representing to you is the truth until you actually meet them. You really DON'T know that the pictures he is sending you are actual pictures of him. Pictures don't "prove" anything.<br>  <br>  I don't think that it was the best judgment to give him your address for him to be sending you stuff [[unless what you gave him was a P.O. Box]]. Realistically, this person is still a stranger - and now he has your address. You don't know what he plans to do with this address outside of sending you stuff, you don't know if he has a history of stalking [[of course he wouldn't admit that to you]], and you don't know if he has or intends to give it to other people!<br>  <br>  If you want to look at another angle of this, what do you think your parents would think of this situation? Are you hiding this "relationship" from them, and if so, why?<br>  <br>  I'm not saying stop talking to him, and I'm not poo-pooing your situation. My point is that you should be a little more cautious before you devote your love to an identity on the internet that is giving you attention that you haven't actually met in person.<br>  <br>  Be a little smarter, sweetie. You shouldn't be so quick to trust and commit to people. You will learn that as you get older.|`|NfgqrQhCaa	yeaaahh as a boy i should tell u that even tho u guys have a relationship that doesnt mean that he has another gurl...belive me some bois are straight up cheaters weather he know is or not
rwJlUQkLaa	Well, im i have the SAME problem, i like my crush and my friend likes him. If i were you i would be honest with your friend tell her what you want her to know. Don't say too much.

REMEMBER its a free world.|`|SBXug4g6aa	Well, it depends on how much your love your bff compared to this really hot guy. You should tell your bff that you like the same guy and see if she still goes out with him which means that a guy is more important to her than your friendship. I would also talk to this guy and see what his true feelings are for you to see if he really does like you or your friend.|`|NHljQ2o6aa	this may seem corny but having freinds is more important if you really dont want to risk your freind ship over some hawt dude then dont. im 13 and i know alot talk to your bff about this  and maybe she might understand ;)|`|PLsJpPqOaa	i think that you should tell her how you really feel about him. just remember don't let a SILLY guy ruin your friendship!!|`|5rSbqhQKaa	I am a teenager just like you, and i have these issues, QUITE OFTEN lol. and hm, maybe you should just play the game....i mean, get to the punch before she does, as bad as it sounds, if you both like the guy, then that means it becomes a competition, dont let it show to your bestfriend that you want him....but play the game... SOMEHOW you should tell him that you want to go out with him, i mean, just be out there with it, and see what he says...and if your friend cant accept the fact that maybe this hottie likes you more and wants to be with you, then maybe she isnt really a good bestfriend. i have had these issues, and they are still good enough to be my bestfriend because they understand that the guy might like me more, just like i can accept the fact that they might like her more....thats all i can give you, i love my bestfriend but if she likes the same guy i do, then we just see who he really loves..... hope this is a good response for you! GOOD LUCK! =) lol|`|LSCG8aGVaa	neither of you guys should date this guy. no guy is EVER worth a friendship. you dont need him. move on there will be more guys out there. dont let one guy come between you and your bestfriend. thats not cool. <br>  good luck:)|`|c674775dc13c0f95352cfe22a3a3450baa	You both should back off.

SlLhUL6zaa	Okay well I've had the opposite experience. I worked at a grocery store, and this really cute guy my age came in many times and usually came to my register. I wanted to talk to him so bad but I thought he'd think I was really lame haha. But anyways, for your problem: just talk to her! I wish I had talked to the guy, but now I quit and it's too late. Trust me, she'll probably think it's cute that you're making conversation. If you're nervous, just try to approach her like she's one of your friends. I mean, you're not asking her hand in marriage here, it's just a casual conversation. So if she does have a boyfriend, that sucks. But at least you'll know, and you'll be able to move on. <br>  But just so you know, don't have really high expecations for this. <br>  "she is so nice and everything about her is exactly what I want."<br>  Just because you make a good impression and have a good conversation with this girl, it doesn't mean you'll end up in a relationship or anything. <br>  Good luck!:)|`|DxfFItv2aa	pretend like that your really good friends. that might work. and ur cute so dont be afraid. and if ur a little good then girls like that if that is what you mean by loser. if she has a bf oh well. it'll be okay, maybe she would dumo him for you.|`|UAnGaeGoaa	your too shy cuz your a troll...if you stop trolling on yahoo answers you might be able to talk to a girl|`|QDBRk1oEaa	Be a man and just talk to her! :)|`|bySORZZjaa	what you can do is start on how is your day? it will go on but you have to be quick because she has other people to check out.. after several times she will remember and recoginze you so you can start a convo by that. i hope this works!|`|AA11883855	hey, whats up?

di6p10Ifaa	you can just stick with one matron there is no need to add a maid of honor unless you have someone you are considering and you would like to add to the this position. Thus having a matron of honor and a maid of honor. Congrats and good luck!|`|0a3ecde4cde9a9d580733f222785f56caa	Maid of Honor and Matron of Honor are the exact same job. The only difference is that "Maid" signifies that she is single, and "Matron" signifies that she is married. There is absolutely no reason to add someone else just because she's getting married.|`|8ilHQMq5aa	shes still your maid of honor but the technical term is matron of honor i guess.<br>  my mom was her best friends kristine's maid of honor but my mom had been married for 17 years. she did all the same things but kristine joked that my mom was a matron of honor.|`|3MDY29gnaa	Yes you change her to the Matron of honor, you dont need to go get a maid of honor. They are basically the same thing but the matron is married. That's all :-)|`|CQsD09D6aa	Maid or matron? The same thing only the maid is unmarried while the matron is. Just a technicality.|`|oXNgstLYaa	Yes, that is rude. Why does it matter if she is married?! Matron, Maid, what is the big difference?!|`|zPHxB9OYaa	Yes, she would then become your matron of honor.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	Maid or Matron, it's the same thing, no need to quibble over semantics.  She is still the same figure head in your wedding, just married, thus a "Matron of Honor."  Why would you need to add a Maid?  Sounds like you are making more out of nothing.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	you only need one m.o.h. - whether she is matron or maid doesn't matter. even if she is married you don't add a maid of honor - there is no need to add another body to your wedding party.<br>  happy wedding<br>  edit:<br>  as for your 'additional details' and making such an insulting comment about the less intelligent - all the answers here are clear and well spoken - if you were all that intelligent yourself you wouldn't have had to ask the darn question!  we so your comment is rather like the pot calling the kettle black!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Yes she would be a matron of honor by the time you get married. You don't have to get another maid of honor. People only have one or the other and you don't need both.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	you don't need to have 2.  Maid and Matron of honour are the exact same thing except the title is changed for someone who is married.|`|WxbPOmrFaa	I don't think it is right for a married person to be a maid of honor...think how her husband would feel? usually made of honors are not married.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Don't need another person - who cares if she the maid or matron?

If your TRULY over him, tell him next time he calls you to just leave you alone. Tell him you don't want to be a part of his life anymore, and that your moving on. If you care about him wish him luck with his girlfriend and thats it. Don't answer his calls or texts or anything. If you see him, just leave him alone and he'll leave you alone in time.|`|ZBMHCC4taa	stop answering his calls, block himfrom all communication, and get another boyfriend so he gets the message.|`|hKDmHqAdaa	dont answer his calls and if neccesary block his number|`|690MZg0Xaa	lol  hes not over U......................

If he persists, you may be able to bar his number - ask your phone company. <br>  <br>  Can you change the places you go with your friends, or are you in a small town with not much choice? If you have to go to the same places your ex goes, try to turn your back and ignore him.
pihrOgsEaa	i'm going through the same situation.<br>  it's probably cause he still has feelings for you, and he wants you to come back to him.<br>  but dont go back to him unless you are sure you still have feelings for him.<br>  cause he might break your heart again.|`|6kAtYLAdaa	he still cares. dont girls do that?  they still like the guy so they try to get him jealous.... ya same bit.|`|3LlW0uf5aa	Im willing to say that he still likes you. most of the time when people act like that, there are still feelings for the other person. if you just ignore it and act like it doesn't bother you, he will come around. best of luck to you|`|jkXDhtsQaa	Well -- now that he knows he had lost something good in his life and want you back. <br>  <br>  With this kind of relationship -- RUN as far and and fast you can you away from this kind of person.|`|XeLZtw20aa	he just really wants you back if you want you can let him down gently or you could drop the hammer so he gets the point
ByUS0k8waa	Its her depression acting up and she should see her Dr about that. Im sorry to say that you should back off the hubby but stay close to her she probably needs you right now. This is a very stressful time for her. When your that depressed you sometimes feel like everyone is out to get you. It has nothing to do with what you did or didn't do with her hubby. Just stay close and talk to her. If she is suicidal then you should get her some help. Call the hospital to see what you need to do to get her some help. She may be mad at first but she will thank you later on. If you get her to the hospital they may keep her over night and then get her meds on track to were they should be. Back off hubby even if its not like that.|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	Why did you even go to the movie alone with him, let alone FOUR times?  That is where problem began.   That's just not something you do.  Cut off your relationship with both of them.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	You haven't been friends long enough to be hanging out with her husband like that...I could see viewing an occasional movie together but not all the time.  It sounds like you should stop hanging out with her husband if you'd like to continue your friendship with her.|`|XzHjeFKYaa	run as fast as you can away from both of them.,... that is so screwed up crazy.  I was in a situation kinda like that.. but I was married. So me and my husbadn would hang out with this girl and her husband, our husbands where coworkers,. they worked together, so he invited the guy and his family over for dinner one night, I got along with the wife. but she was a HUGE freak., telling my husband how she wanted to sleep with me, I think this was a turn on to my husband, he kept them coming around...  I hated it. just so many BAD things happened.  SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many bad things.      Just girl run away from them, get them out of your life. TRUST ME... it is not good.|`|46q6xyKmaa	Yes, you have to remove yourself from the situation.  She is making her problems, YOUR problems.  Maybe after a few months, call and see if she is ok, and if you want her friendship, even now, just arrange outings with her.  Stay away from the husband.  I've learned through the years, (21 yrs. marriage) you just never allow yourself to be in a situation where something could develop, which includes never being alone with another male.  Sounds drastic, but we've both adhered to this and neither has had to worry about an affair, etc.  Good luck!

ze7xiJwTaa	What a great idea! Gift certificate for a restaurant they like, or even something more casual for something they like but can't afford (i.e. Starbucks). Gift certificate for a grocery store. Long distance phone card.|`|YENiEvoJaa	Can't they just declare bankruptcy? You'd better call them and ask them to talk to an attorney, for Pete's sake it's much better than losing your HOME. Section 13 allows you to keep your home and belongings and make small payments I believe.    If that's not an option (although it should be unless they've already declared bankruptcy in the past seven years or so), I don't really know what to say about the care package, you don't want it to seem too cheerful in a time like this, maybe what would be nice though now that I think of it is a giftcard to a restaurant, that way they can at least have a good night out and you'll be feeding them without it seeming like it! lol  the movie is an excellent idea, something they can do at home that is cheap, my parents aren't in the poorhouse (yet anyway!lol) but we always go over there and play Uno Flash, it's actually really fun. We also play poker but a poker set would be more expensive. I think Target has Uno Flash... It sounds lame but it's really fun, I swear!
Molu004zaa	He's a good guy who wants you both to stay sober on your date so you can PROPERLY enjoy eachother's company.

oFKHFc7Naa	Just look at her face to face and tell her how you really feel for her. She might feel the same way back. You can't do this forever. Just walk her to one of her classes when your both together and just walk with her slowly or it doesn't matter as long as you talk to her. But you have to tell her that you like her.
ZkeoRyy3aa	sure I can help you out..<br>  My man never really cheated with another person...but he was lieing outrageously and I found out he was a frequent visitor to those porn booths they have in xxx stores!  Not only that but he would watch it at school (college) knowing he could get kicked out.  He lied to me for 3 months about the fact that he was smoking...and sooooo much more.<br>  By the way, he is more than welcome to look at porn at home(so it was  "what is he watching" that concerned about)<br>  <br>  These things completely destroyed my trust =/  I was always wondering about him and what he was doing, if he was lying to me, if he even really cared about me at all.  Most people told me there was no way we were going to get back on our feet and have a good relationship..<br>  He attended counseling and it did him wonders, but so did I and it has helped so much.  There is no way everything would have worked out for us if we hadn't both attended...you can't get trust back on your own.  It takes talking to someone who has no part in your situation and getting a clear piont of view.<br>  <br>  Some people may not believe this but, our communication is better than it has been ever, we both completed our counseling programs.  I have not let my guard down in about 2 years, and it took a lot to gain back my trust...mood swings...testing him....freaking out about nothing.  Sometimes acting like a total loon to be honest.  But like I said, things could not be better.  When he and I realized that we were back to our normal selves again, he held me in his arms and we just cried out of happiness.  That may sound dumb, but that was a new beginning.<br>  <br>  If both of you are committed and willing to forgive each other and both take fault in whatever things have happened in your past, you CAN move beyond this.  I wish you the best, and I hope everything works out for you just as it did for me.  Good luck.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	I have not had the cheating experience and moved on, but I have had the violation of my trust and found a way to move forward. The unfortunate answer to your questions is time. He needs to prove himself to you once again and he will have to be willing to do whatever it takes for you to feel comfortable. If that means giving you the 411 on his every move then that is what will be required. He was in the wrong here and he will have to be the one to make it up to you. This will not be a 1 month of good guy = everythign okay again. It will be 6-12 months of being that good guy to feel a better level of trust. The key is he will have to be aware of this. Tell him what you expect and if he can do this then you two can move forward. If he can't then you two can't.|`|Ry8oAQ7Laa	I'm sorry I don't have a positive one to tell you, but my bf cheated on me once, we broke up for a year, but I gave him another chance because I loved him, he said he was sorry, blah blah blah.  Of course I had trust issues, that was the hardest things, but he cheated on me again.  So that was it for me.<br>  <br>  If you truly feel he's changing, and that he's trying, then follow your heart.  But gaining trust back is really hard, and he has to help you.  You sound like you're not ready to let go, so if you feel like he deserves a second chance then give it to him, but watch out for red flags!

When you cheat, it ALWAYS eventually becomes a problem.  There's no way around it.  If it's worth the risk to you, then knock yourself out.  If not, then don't cheat.  Sorry, but there's nothing anyone can tell you that's going to make cheating run smoothly.|`|NQuPNHPyaa	I must say I don't like that your cheating but anyway, Do you love your girlfriend? If you don't why not break up with her and be with the girl your having and  affair with? If you do want to still be with your girlfriend just see less of the girl.. Try avoiding her and the talking with you to keep it to a minimum.|`|AA11988604	Any time you have to lie to people about what you are doing, you harm yourself as much or more as anyone who is listening to you lie.     Women are hardwired to want a single sexual partner, and to have him stay with her and protect her and to not engage romantically with anyone else.  It's part of evolution, the success of babies is due to the survival of more babies who's mother's carried this predisposition than those that did not care if the father was out running around making babies all over the place.    Men are hardwired to spread their seed as far and wide as possible.  Men's genetics are most successful the more babies they produce, because the mother's are oriented toward caring for the children.    Due to the relative ease of life in the modern age, a man no longer needs a woman to care for him and gather and cook etc.   He likes when she does that, but he doesn't really need it.   So, when a man is younger and his biological urges are strongest, he tends to want to see multiple women and to not be tied down.    So you have a natural friction between the desire of the woman and the desire of the man.  Society has ruled in favor of the woman.  You have to be faithful to one woman if you want the full benefits of society, vs the satisfaction of the biological urge.  Generally men will date for a while, satisfy the urges, and then settle down with a woman who gives him what he now prefers, having done the whole spreading himself around thing.    So, you are still in the spreading yourself around stage.  And your two women are in the nesting stage.   You're just going to have to work it out, but do not lie to them.  that makes you the bad guy.  And it's not wrong to not want to settle down yet, but it is wrong to lie.|`|v0GwTTsVaa	I'm not going to tell you to stop cheating.  One day it will catch up with you. Your Girlfriend will find out and not only will you break her heart you'll cause her to have issues dealing with trust for a very long time........possibly the rest of her life.  But you keep on cheating cause it's the man thing to do........ be a real man and spread your seed to as many women as you possibly can.  Do you not have a brain other than the one in your pants!  Get real and make up your mind on which woman you want to be with!  Unbelievably selfish prick!|`|wntdMR8caa	I kind of hope she goes of the wall and kills you, or better, cuts off your junk.

Why dont you go out and find yourself a smart, pretty, confident, fun girl, that you are willing to devote yourself to 100%.    If you need 2 women to keep you satisfied, it is obvious that those women separately are not enough. They're not right for you.    You could spare you - and the women - allllllot of heartache if you break it off WITH BOTH of them, and find someone that can satisfy you.    I know alot of the woman on yahoo answers are going to answer like "that is disgusting" "you're a pig"  but it actually makes sense for you to need 2 women, because that 1 particular woman is not satifying. It may not be aparent that shes not satisfying you, but until you find someone that can, and that you are willing to be with 100% you will never know.    Please just take a second to think about it, i know it will be really hard, but if you work at it, it will be truely amazing.  Plus who likes clingy girls?????????????????????  ugh|`|Vmim6dv0aa	I can't say much for cheating, I cheated on my ex husband with my new husband, but there will come a time when you have to make a decision.  Living a double life can get very hard and it would make it easier if you were honest with the other woman, cause that leaves you with just one person to lie to instead of two.  Just tell her yes you are living with someone and trying to figure out your current situation.  Remember if it ain't love don't leave a happy home, also never tell your girlfriend, let sleeping dogs lie.

Maybe this time she'll say yes.|`|zfKzLFgxaa	sorry :) i just saw the length of your paragraph and skipped to the end.... it IS too long|`|624b94938d509e58bec9e61282417d76aa	Dude, do really expect any one to read this.|`|5qwtCcKraa	well give her some time... she probley was just shocked about it|`|c4qZRoQgaa	geez you could make this a book it was so long!<br>  lol|`|073ad2ba60d8cf71ef3514ad2f5a92eaaa	Although too long I read it all:<br>  She doesnt act normally u should be so young I think. Leave her for a while, she surely like u but seems that the kind if u dont act as she want she will forget u and put u away. So it wont be for a long time. Be away for some times , See what is she going to do. Maybe she understands what to do in the future and conclude that being friend is the best choice for u.|`|iUE97ieHaa	dude. seriously, never ask someone out on a date by text. that gives the person bad intentions.<br>  this girl seems super nice, and totally fun to hang out with. but u need to stay calm and see what comes and goes.<br>  if this girl is not interested in you, u need to just sit down and relax. having her as a friend is better than not having her at all. right?|`|idjUvg2Zaa	Dont worry about the long question, some things need a lot of explaining!! The only reason i can see for her getting jealous is that she realises maybe she does like you, or at the very least likes you enough to not want to see you with anyone else. <br>  If i was you i would do what i can to get hold of her, maybe not by text but phone or something and say you need to have a chat and explain everything. Just say its fine if she doesnt want to be with you but if thats the case she needs to accept you talking to other girls. Give her the chance to tell you how she feels, its the only way to really get to the bottom of it.
bID1Pd7Gaa	She might have liked you but did some soul searching of her own and decided that losing her boyfriend back home was not worth it. Just move on, it would be nothing but heartache for you.|`|AA11812015	Yea you need to just let go of it.  She is not interested in you right now.|`|9iXGakohaa	Probably because she's embarrassed, you said she was shy. She probably just doesn't want to lead you on any further, because she might be worried you will get the wrong idea again.|`|h2vIOmDgaa	She feels weird now that's why she is avoiding you. It's ok you took a chance it just didn't work out. You do know that when you agree to be friends that usually code for "stay away from me".|`|Un9CElCaaa	she doesnt want you to be the reason her current relationship fails and why would u tell her u liked her so soon. u are in college dont u know how to chase a girl by now. its all a game with them. the more u are willing to work for them the better chance u have. if u tell them u like them right away its like "game over" but it even starts|`|fjm1ag1uaa	Man she does like you but she loves her  boyfriend to. If she didn't have a boyfriend she would be your. Actually she cant get you off her mind and its driving her cray because she loves her boyfriend but cant get you off her mind.|`|zwaCsOeVaa	Wow, way to jump the gun on that one, scooter.|`|7XGjs8cyaa	This has happened to me before. I've accidentally led on guys and then they'd ask meout and ialways say no. But whenn i agreed on being friends and stuff and just feels real awkward to talk to the guy like you did before he asked me out|`|80bb87677d8929ca4ce706abcdf1b5d7aa	Yeah, you probably read a little too much into that or she was just enjoying the attention since she is not near her boyfriend.    It is going to be awkward now, there is no going back so probably not gonna work out as friends for awhile at least.|`|X6hK915Naa	well shes still trying not to give you the impression of her being atracted to you so shes staying away from u so u dont feel like shes atracted to you|`|9ae557afae8c72a2f03fc0f5b4f78564aa	If she's shy, avoiding you is probably the easiest way of dealing with it. She's probably embarrassed and not use to the attention. You sound like you have handled things very well. If she's not able to be friends, then just let it go. Don't push it, don't chase after her. Maybe when she's a little more comfortable (it's hard being a shy girl) she may come around. If not then move on, you tried, that's all you can do.|`|Lwc8BK2Zaa	she may really like yuu .. as yuu say the signs are kinda there .. but now she feels she likes yuu ..n yuu like her .. shes scared she will cheat on her bf with yuu and so to make sure tht cnt happen she is staying away .. even being friends she still has feelings for yuu and now she feels she cnt be the same around you ... as she probaly been wid her bf a long time n really loves him ..     only thing i can think of atm sorry x|`|38OLrY0Zaa	Maybe, she does like you. She might just feel guilty because of the bf back home. She also may feel confused because she feels for both of you but isn't sure how to react. Just give her some space. Eventually, if she doesn't start talking to you, ask her if she's ok and if she's mad at you. Tell her you're wondering because you thought you were friends but don't talk. Try to be her friend. In the end, she might choose you. Or, you might only like her as a friend. I'm a girl so, I know we have the bad habit of giving mixed signals. Just, don't be pushy. Give her the time and space she needs to figure things out.|`|UaSb84BOaa	A girl who's looking for a guy while her guy is away will not tell you 'all the right things'. It's great that you like her, but if she's attached and has made that clear, move on.   Don't be confused. Sometimes, we never say what we truly mean - this is true for men as well as women. If you put yourself out there, and are honest, and she doesn't respond in a way that would indicate she is into you, then move on.|`|NEfngXeXaa	she is differnet then most girls|`|yWROYbZAaa	Maybe she thinks that if she starts talking to you or you two are friends she will start liking you more and that will ruin things with her and her boyfriend.|`|ee2ce7f4a4671d3a72fbfecf0348ee49aa	you have put her on the defensive by approaching her ... it was all in your head she never liked you as anything more than a friend now she is trying extra hard not to lead you on|`|Jfo6XyAZaa	She finds it too uncomfortable to be around someone who fancies her when she's involved with someone else.    She probably doesnt want you to think shes leading you on when there's no chance.|`|AA12239377	Ithink that this girl is weird and DID likeyou, and is just playing games.  she's also being immature by avoiding you|`|0zjrVM8Naa	When you like a girl and then "relationship" breaks up, you find it impossible to be "friends" because for some odd reason there are always moments of awkwardness.  And you can never be alone with each other cuz then its even more awkward. I have no idea why.|`|37ana68Haa	because she is a dumbfu** lol thats all i can really tell ya she is one of those girls that lead you on and then leave you hangin|`|zO1eMt0haa	its called for forbidden love my friend, I've been in the situation, since she's a quite individual she wont ell you this, but it's most likely the case that she likes you, but had good parents, so she knows that she should be loyal and prove what a good girlfriend she is, if you like her a lot, then try waiting for awhile, college relationships are very similar to high school, most of them generally don't last, especially if they're long distance and if they kind of he a crush on someone else like in your case, so depending on how much you like her, you should wait.|`|NKpZGdtraa	maybe feeling guilty for leading you on when she had a b/f...just give her time|`|KsFqEL7vaa	Ron,  temptation is a strong and curious power. It can be unsettling. Maybe this is the first time away from home for her? She wants to stay true to the b/f but is seriously tempted to have some fun with ( you or someone like you).  It's always best to cut and run before college. Give her time and just be an open book. Let her know how you feel and drop it. "he who cares the least wins". think about it....   monk|`|YBRQsmLMaa	Take your coloured glasses off your nose so  that you may read the hint and move to pasures new.|`|QSmvZ6fMaa	the reason why she is avoiding you is because that she really do like you but when you made the first move she said that she was sorry but really she wanted to make the first move cause now girls are the one to make the first move so what she wanted to do was ask you if you had any feeling for her then if you would of said yes then you'll could be together
MWjNp6y3aa	Are there no single older women at your church? Maybe find some clubs to fit into. Try meetup.com They have some little clubs you can attend in most areas. Try eharmony as that other person said. I know you probably haven't been out dating much in a long time so you just got to get back into the game. Talk to those nice women and get them to go out to a nice cozy dinner somewhere. Try craigslist maybe too. Craigslist.com is a website where you can post a personal ad without a whole lot of trouble. It is free as well. If you need any help with that stuff let me know. That's got to be sucky sir. Good luck to you brother.|`|gdbeVf32aa	this isnt eharmony|`|VMoDsdREaa	you need to go to e harmony. com and see what happens. good luck sir.
uvn609hsaa	Wow that's really unlucky. I suppose you just have to accept that flirting is as far as it can go for now. If you really like her then you will have to wait until she IS allowed a boyfriend, then the waiting will pay off. If you don't wait, then when she CAN have a bf you wont be there anymore because she will have moved on. Just be patient, She clearly likes you. Just be grateful of that and wait. It will be worth it.<br>  Good luck. x|`|RC2aQBkgaa	Well, flirting is natural for a girl. Every girl will flirt here and there, and it can sometimes be a good thing, and in fact very fun. I find that flirting allows me to be closer with a guy I like and gives me attention from him and gives me a fun experience. Flirting is like the single version of dating, I guess you could put it. If I couldn't date, flirting would give me a better relationship between someone whom I am attracted to. It's a girl thing, I guess it may not make sense to you, but that's the way I look at it.|`|3zl6DrjVaa	Its fun!!!!!!|`|SLTlvqRlaa	Its natural and why isnt she? Obviously she wants you.|`|WFFXHFfVaa	Flirting is just natural, and we all do it in some form or other, just cause she isnt allowed to date, dosent mean she cant flirt and like you
98p5v51zaa	Sounds like Chester the Molester to me.|`|v2K249U8aa	four years???!!!
02FU5knNaa	What you seriously need to do is go get her out of the house. Either have her stay with you or your parents. There are also numerous safe houses that she can go to, where he will never be able to find her. The next thing to do would be to get a restraining order on him. That way if he comes near her he will go straight to jail.    I have been there one to many times. She just needs to have as much support from her friends and family as possible. She may fight you in the beginning, but every one needs to stay strong and determined. GET HER AWAY FROM HIM, and KEEP HER AWAY FROM HIM. There is not a judge in this world that wouldn't grant a restraining order against this guy.    When you (or whom ever) gets her out of the house, leave everything. Her life is way more important than material things. She can replace all of that. But can she replace her or her childs life?     I seriously wish the best for everyone involved here, and will pray that she comes through this safely with her child.|`|HEOWbQIXaa	Tell her to get rid od his *** because no women should be treated like that that|`|YAwvszITaa	OMG I am so so sorry to hear this! Please call the police I know your sis might get upset but she just has to get over it because the kids are the most important. Call social services as well. The kids will likely be taken out of her custody but maybe you can become a temporary guardian for them. Please call the authorities and social services immediately. Do not try to act on your own because he is dangerous and will try to hurt you again. The kids are seriously neglected. Why doesn't she try to get some help? I hope when the kids get taken away they make it required that that bastard stays away from them. He is bad news in all ways. Get the police involved ASAP!|`|SvEt3d8Gaa	ask her to be bold enuf to tell him,,|`|HLlWCilNaa	You should try bringing your sister and niece back into your home, or if that doesn't work, just accept them into your house for a little while until she pulls her life back together (get's an apartment or something). And you should report that man to the police or rehab or do something about him. Don't let him get away just so he can do the same thing to someone else. And guys like that are likely to not leave. He'll probably stalk you and your sister now. Get help!|`|xmzvUFR3aa	Unfortunately she's not going to leave him until she has had enough and wants to get away. If she doesn't want to leave him she won't leave him and there's nothing that you can really do to make her leave him. I think that the only person you should concern yourself with is your niece. If your sister doesn't want to leave him you need to go to the authority's and tell them what's going on so that they can do what's best for the kids.
e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	About your sister - you cannot do anything.  It is her choice.    But, since there is a child involved, and she actually accepts that he puts the child in danger by getting drunk and using drugs - and most likely have a violent tendency as well - you could call social services or the police about this.    You could talk with your sister first - invite her for an afternoon somewhere, for a drink, bring the kid etc. and explain in a quiet manner what you see. Do not expect results, if she thinks she loves him, she will be blind to the bad things.  So, stress the child's needs, and the child's safety. As a mother, her first priority should be with her child.     If she still refuses, explain that you cannot in good consciousness allow this to continue, and that if she does not take steps, you will have no choice but to get childrens protection services or the police involved.  This might mean that your sister will be angry for a while (at you for 'betraying her BF') - but at least she will be alive and healty to be angry at you - and that will pass once she realises that she is better of without an abuser posing as a BF.|`|e6988558ce99ec66bb677335e270a037aa	If you seriously fear for the children, call Child Protective Services to give her a wake up call. They will keep it anonymous as to who reported it. On the other hand, if it's strictly this boyfriend that's the problem - bud out. The sooner you and your family leave her the hell alone the sooner she will realize what a loser he is. The more you complain and the more you try to get her to leave him the more she's going to love him and want to stay. I don't know why but it's always the same, leave her alone and she'll figure it out on her own. Because right now she's hearing you guys complain and put him down and so she has her defenses up. As soon as you stop doing that she won't be wasting her time defending him and she'll wake up. SHE has to want to leave, you can't help someone that doesn't want to be helped.|`|9sIcZwWMaa	a man date a girl or marry her so that he mentally abuse her????/  this is bulshit.... yes go ahead and report this answer but I will say it one more time: this is bulshit.......  just try to understand the psychology of a man.... try to know how a man want to be treated... you are very wrong lady , no man love a girl and spend his years with her trying to abuse her.....|`|rmQKOcp5aa	I think that you need to really do something about it, in one of your answers it says that its your sister and that you cant do anything that is sooo wrong, on the contrary its your sister and your niece first of all you should always have her back right now your sister is not even thinking for her own self they got her in a stage where she is controlled by this man even though she is wrong she wont see it, she needs counseling, second of all the baby can't even think for himself that's where u should call the cops when he hits her or just try to find any little thing to call the cops. If he shoots himself up with any kind of drug that can be dangerous there is kids in the house .... don't wait too much time before you know it somebody is gonna bend up dead.... As they always say its better to live alone than to have bad company all the time. your sis will thank you in the long run......

You should not care what SHE thinks. Your most likely a great kisser. She's just tryng to get you down.|`|uXiKfK0Yaa	DID U BRAKE UP WIT HER...CUZ IF SO SHE'S PROB JUST MAD ABOUT THT.....OR EVEN IS SHE BROKE UP WIT U SOMETIMES GIRLS WILL JUST SAY STUFF LIKE THT CUZ MAYBE YOUR BETTER THEN HER?????<br>  <br>  JUST TRY TO FORGET IT....UR PROBLY TO GOOD 4 HER ANYWAYS|`|DxYwNFdhaa	Different girls like different kisses lol She may be the only one that thinks this, your other gf's may have loved the way you kiss.|`|tLOUuf3Maa	you're a good kisser.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  feel better now?|`|eNulfbs7aa	yea...she didn't know what else to say...I did it when I was younger..I said (well I will leave his name out of it) was a sloppy kisser...I felt terrible about it later...he was a little slobbery...but I was young and scared at the time..and it was easier to blame his kiss than to come up with the word fear!  Don't sweat it..he married my best friend and they seem to be doing just fine..Just let it go..and keep practicing..that was many years ago..and I still feel terrible about it...but that is on her..not on you..Just keep practicing...it is a lot of fun to keep practicing...you are fine~she is a bit of a *****...I guess I was too...We live and learn...hopefully she will feel terrible later too...I still feel like dirt to this day...and it was....(a lloooonnnggg time ago).  I am sorry about your nuts...hopefully they will feel better soon|`|QXoeJqD8aa	well just forget about them. If someone likes you then they will accept whether you are a good kisser or a bad kisser. So dont let little thing bother you. Remember no one is perfect in this world so if someone say something that hurt you, try to ignore it and say this to them or yourself when they say that you suck at something tell them "like you can do any better than me" even though u are a bad kisser, but maybe you are good at other thing. so yea...dont let anything or anyone get into your life. so GOOD LUCK!!!|`|J7k4xJtoaa	well if none of the other girls have said that to you then she probably is saying it out of spit. My ex tells me that I am not sexually open enough and a prud becuase I wont have sex with him... its their ways of trying to make us feel like crap, because they are upset... Chin up your probably a really good kisser|`|oRdHPdUFaa	well she dated you so don't worry about it. she is probably telling you that out of anger cause she's hurt. just don't worry about it.|`|Or6mIS96aa	Just ignore obviously she doesn't  know what she is tlking about maybe she doesn't deserve you|`|aZywR0j1aa	She's an ex for a reason. Get a new girlfriend who appreciates you.
d1a57165e69fb7e3ade74a8659b315cdaa	Its called a conversation. They dont always mean stuff.
VFEjLgvuaa	She has gone through the worst pain possible with the exception of losing a child. Its been 2 years and Im sure she is lonely and hurting and propably just needs comfort and companionship. The fact shes pregnant and isnt with him should tell you that though shes looking for comfort and companionship shes not ready to move on emotionally because if she was she would be looking for a relationship not just someone to feel her voids. Be there for her and try to help her through this your friend would want her to move on and be happy and not be lonely and misserable for the rest of her life but she hasnt moved on shes just lonely and needs some attention and care.|`|XJW7Yx8faa	Two years yep time to move on.|`|UgcPxd4maa	Its been 2 years. Im sure she still misses him, but she needs to move on as well as everyone else. It doesn't mean she's forgotten about him though.|`|LydL7EN6aa	everyone deals differently. she was probably lonely... i dont know? are you friends with her? if you are and you two are close talk to her. ask her if theres anything you and your wife can help her with? i dont think i would be able to do that if my husband died and we dont even have any kids!|`|IfS1VnSKaa	Well its been 2 years she probably got lonely and was trying to move on with her life and try to be happy again.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Are you serious??? it's been 2 YEARS PAL??? I think thats plenty of time for her to move on!!!! Sorry about your friend passing. But really>>>life has to move along.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Everyone grieves in different ways.  If she's not with the guy she's pregnant by, it sounds like it was just a mistake, you know?  It doesn't mean she slept with him because she loves him; sadly, there isn't enough of that.    I don't know how he died, but I will tell you something about death.  If it's unexpected, it takes longer to get over.  But if the person is sick for a long time, you tend to get over it more quickly because you have already had time to grieve.  When my father passed away, I didn't cry; I had already shed my tears while he was suffering from cancer.  Death brought peace and the end of pain, and as strange as it may sound, it was a blessing.    It's time for you to let go of your friend's memory and feeling like you need to watch out for him.  Everyone is entitled to move on and not live in the past, including his girlfriend and his children.
d2359ab4ecd6093abc8a4a670574eaa4aa	Making out just sort of... happens, usually.  A kiss that sort of spirals into something more.  Note his reaction when you kiss him.  A catch of breath, a sigh, anything.  That's usually green light.|`|htsQ6HXCaa	4 ******* MONTHS AND YOU HAVENT MADE OUT YET??!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Honestly, when you two are just alone. And when you are thinking about it, hes probably thinking about it too. So just go for it. You can feel when its the right time.|`|5qwtCcKraa	go for it.....kiss him softly and then suck on his bottom lip..then make out with him.|`|mVNMgaQBaa	during your next date would be ok|`|ahujYDBdaa	wtf is up with that troller?|`|zXpbfBcuaa	on a romantic date<br>  <br>  movie<br>  fair on top ferris wheel<br>  over dinner|`|JsYmr0Xcaa	Ok look. Im a boy that recently made out with my gf. Here's the advice for when the time is right. I've made out with her about 9 times since then. Top three places: Movies, Hanging out, and my first time, in front of a grocery store hanging out after school. When is the right time/mood... there really isn't any... mine and my friends were sorta spontaneous and  then... well my situation was she made a joke, i looked at her, kissed her than continued into kissing, then make out. There really isn't a 'time'. The best time is when YOU think the time is right. After that it's really easy to make out. The time is usually always right. Good Luck!! I really hope your kiss is awesome!!|`|UAnGaeGoaa	when you stop trolling is a good time<br>  <br>  mrs. cullen...your a troll so stopp talking ok?|`|oMUcx37Waa	Just go for it!

9ae557afae8c72a2f03fc0f5b4f78564aa	Are you sure you love him? Maybe he's just comfortable and your afraid to start a new life without him. You can love someone without being "In love" with them. You should really think hard about this. You shouldn't stay with him just because you have a child together. If you like sex, just not with him, I don't see how the relationship can work without hurting both of you (and in the long run your daughter)|`|aSjdL4heaa	I would say that at this point you two need to agree to have a semi-open relationship.  3-ways and 4-ways can be fun.      It is very unhealthy to sneak around behind his back.|`|WPd4MYt6aa	If you loved him you wouldn't want to have sex with anybody else. Just break up with him and get yourself checked for STDS. You're nasty and don't really know what love is. I've only had sex with one person in my whole life and that's my husband. I love him enough not to want to have sex with anybody else.|`|9SSO454taa	Lol you should be on jerry springer, love is like a war easy to start but hard to end.

You could tell him how you want it experiment with him instead of getting pleasure from other guys who don't really care about you.  You might also be developing sex addiction if this goes on.  You have already hurt him by giving yourself to other guys but not him.|`|ZQfGvUgMaa	You certainly don't love him if you are sleeping with other people. He probably doesn't love you either if he is sleeping with other women.|`|zhk8o514aa	Do yourself a favor..get tested for STD's  before even thinking about seeing him again.    Nasty woman.|`|brgewnhRaa	I think the relationship is pretty much over. This is why guys like girls that do not have a lot of sexual experience.|`|zY9PdRGjaa	you need to get your priority's striaght.. i think your being selfish.    how about be more concerned with your child then sex...   if you trully love him and want to work things out you can.. but i see you as a lot of other females who have a good thing but **** it up over lust.. you want a good guy or a guy thats not gonna respect you but is good in bed?   if you know what it is you like tell your husband what to do...|`|TxIDLrjOaa	Lol wow. uh, I can only suggest fantasizing? SERIOUSLY DAMN IT YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER TOGETHER!|`|mnQXmZbeaa	Gets some toys to help out, invite another woman to play with you two, or talk to him about whats up.|`|e0Qvdg0zaa	Hmmm....Some people are probably going to say mean things to you about this, but I kind of understand. I haven't ever done this, but I have been with my boyfriend for a long time. I have never cheated on him, but sometimes I feel the urge to hook up with someone else. It just seems exciting. I don't really know what to tell you, but you need to figure out what you want. It is hard to be in a relationship where you aren't sexually attracted to the person anymore.|`|f6OOxJQsaa	You're headed for trouble.  You want to eat your cake and have it too.|`|jz0PYljzaa	U ****** the whole thing....if he comes to know ...he wont really accept u...he will be shattered...think of ur daughter...she is gonna suffer a lot...take care of her....Or she will be on yahoo answers after some days ...questioning about,her dad n mom fight....dont let that happen...|`|SAgCy83Oaa	That's a funny kind of "love" you have there.  You have already "hurt" him; he just doesn't KNOW it.  I'd say you need to get out of this pitiful excuse for a relationship and go "find yourself" before you get involved with anyone again.|`|89YkHxMUaa	Do him a favor if you really care for him and leave him.    If you say you ''love him'' you would tell him no matter what you have to face.|`|BGTkTNQyaa	I think you're just going through a dark time. It will pass. Sometimes you may not feel attracted to him, and other times you will. Relationships are like that. And no matter who you hook up with, know that the relationship will be full of its own ups and downs. Hang in there and if you need to, get counseling.|`|Qq4H1VJNaa	i can understand where u are coming from because i see for one that u both have been together for a good min so u know sex may get boring of course then you have a child by hhim so im pretty sure yall have did it like alot of times and i know people can become real bored with the same person so i can understand u wanting to do what u did but u say u dont wanna hurt him so if i was u just stop and think about what ur doing and become a family and try to get the connection started again between just the two of you|`|DABa3Cjyaa	It isn't not heathly to have a sexual feeling towards sex to strangers but now to family, just try it, make it more special.|`|rRetsTHNaa	it sounds like you dont love him, you most likely want just sex and not real love. that is pretty bad. I can tell by the way that you asked the question. You obviously don't love him so find a new person to date.|`|FHRfTlCxaa	I think you should do some interesting and romantic things together..  Maybe you will like him again.. :)|`|9rdP7cmoaa	ytou have every right to do this!, its your nlife just letr him know and he will understand|`|xmzvUFR3aa	The fact that you broke up with him for 5 months and had sex with "a few different men" and  when you got into a argument with him a month ago, you had sex with a stranger that you met online, tells me that you should break up with him. Allow him to find someone who doesn't sleep around.|`|Uek2TNLMaa	no there isnt any hope to get back together again....youve hurt him enough.....leave him and live the single life.you have no heart and you dont need a commited relationship right now.

If she didn't like you, she should not have asked if you liked her. It kind of gave you the green light to be honest and I'm sure you were expecting her answer to be different. It was misleading. But, give her points for her honesty and don't take it personally. I doubt it's because she thinks you're ugly... she probably just has boundaries when it comes to dating people like friends, neighbors, etc. Don't worry about it, and don't blame yourself. You'll get over it in a few days. :-)|`|IMCYeBuQaa	is her name jaynet or something like that, it starts with a ja right. dont mind her your reeally CUTE.|`|PJMXqlRjaa	It's also about your attitude. Confidence is important. A guy can be pretty cute, but if he acts like he needs a woman's approval, then he (in my opinion) starts to not look as attractive. Don't show her that you're focused only on her. She clearly stated she is not sexually attracted to you. Women are often sexually attracted to men who act manly - sure, if you're nice, that's great, but manly men take charge. You can read stuff online about alpha males. You can still be a nice guy but try to keep in mind the alpha male personality traits. If she can't appreciate you, then find someone who can. Are there other girls you're interested in? Sometimes you have to try approaching many girls to find out which ones are interested in you, too.|`|Ym9bRgcDaa	You're so cute! I'm 13 and I would date you if I was her!<br>  Maybe she's afraid of rejection or getting over another guy...|`|Eqi0BNUhaa	u r so cute i would soo got out with you!!!|`|VXlAfw3Eaa	Just be nice, and act like nothing happened. She obviously cares a lot about you as a friend if she still tried to be nice and talk to you after you asked. Who knows? Maybe in the future something might come out of it. Until then, there are "plenty of other fish out in the sea!"<br>  <br>  And you're definetely not ugly, don't worry hun!|`|iNzRRI70aa	well i dont think its that she doesnt like you i think that she ment what she said whtn she didnt really like anyone right now. so dont get down. and HELL YES! you are pretty cute in a wet suit haha. well anyways dont ger super upset i would give it some time and try back later!<br>  <3MUCH LOVE<br>  LuCkY|`|tU5NJVL3aa	No, she didn't -- nowhere did she say it was because of your looks.  She "just friends" you because of what she said -- She's not into you that way, and because you are neighbors.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Aww, you're cute ^-^|`|tPMNAFbsaa	I am waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay older than you and trust me, YOU ARE VERY CUTE!

I am also in a band and I have been doing some shows and we also have a couple of shows coming up so I've needed to shift my focus from my personal life to my musical life for a time.  I am still totally crazy about my girl...   I just don't have the same kind of time to SAY it.<br>  <br>  OOPS... I gotta go.  I think she just signed in.|`|AA11053422	maybe he has the feeling that you don't like him over-calling, he's busy, or it's so casual between u2 he doesn't feel like he needs to text 24/7. you cant blame someone for not texting all the time. just sort of have a casual convo with him now and again. talk 2 him about what he's doing, etc. dont get worked up about THIS!|`|O8kke1X5aa	Looks like the stanza of a poem.

If it is a couple of days, he could be busy. If it is weeks, maybe he is not interested.|`|IFXAlv7Uaa	get a life?|`|Z8WGDv5paa	From what I hear men change their minds at any given point sometimes.  It could be he found another girl, he feels like he can't chase you anymore because he has you and it is no longer fun for him, or he just doesn't like you anymore. Men are so funny like that.  If I were you I would not text him or communicate with him for a while. I bet he will come around, if not then it's his loss. There are other men out there.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	I think he maybe checking to see if you'll text him instead of him texting you.<br>  <br>  He's just gauging the relationship, or he's worried he's harassing you.|`|48f33a581499ea478ca95a87097d67c5aa	Sounds like your reply texts were boring him, and he figured he need not waste his time on you.  Did you text back more than; "like wow, I like that 2" ?  Get creative girl.|`|RVzwViRyaa	maybe hes worried hes annoying you
ynLWX4s1aa	Not if there a girl...
KcdzO9Bqaa	You are asking questions that have no answers. <br>  <br>  She is not better than you, just different. Looks aren't everything, so if she is pretty or not it really doesn't matter. <br>  You are asking why he moved on so fast....but he never stopped moving. You may have settled down, but he was still out there looking for the next person that gives him that new and exciting feeling.<br>  <br>  This does not show that anything is wrong with you, he is the one that has the problem...and there is nothing you should do to make him regret it. Guys like this don't feel like normal people do. You can try and "get back at him" but it will only make you feel worse because it will not work. Instead he gets to live his life with out ever experiencing how great you truly are, and how wonderful it would be to be in a relationship with you. He will grow older not knowing how great a deep and meaningful relationship is...and one day he will have a daughter and some dumb guy will do this same thing to his daughter.<br>  Knowing that something like that will happen should make you sleep really good at night....and maybe just maybe you will have the son that breaks his daughters heart.|`|wjPcDlK7aa	There's no doubt you'll hear from him again. He'll get bored with his new girl and will want to "catch up" with you. Be prepared and say you want a friendship and not not a secret relationship behind his girlfriend's back. He isn't worth your time and you certainly can do better hun.<br>  Good luck. :)|`|KrpnKhFTaa	Love is not a power game.
pTj97rYnaa	She likes you. Maybe sit next to her and then ask her out? Or just talk to her and ask!|`|H2tkkWyPaa	Wow. It totally sounds like she likes you.  To ask her out, I dunno, probably don't do it in text, give her something sweet and put a note on it asking her out, or just do it in person.|`|AA10410277	be like hey , i feel this connection with you ! say like do you want to go out with me ? lol i really don't know. but, it seems like she likes you!
xqgE4CrBaa	Yup. Sure. I really believe you, Dancer.|`|icTmbLjfaa	You should not make out or anything else with a boy until he tells asks you out. If doesn't tell you that he likes you or wants to be with you and only you do not kiss,touch or anything. You gotta keep your standards high and make sure that he respects you.|`|VFEjLgvuaa	I was 12 when I had my first love and though we did kiss and make out we never had intercourse. I was 17 when I lost my virginity and I regret it I wish I would have waited I ended up having a baby 10 months later at 17 and life has been very hard on me I now have 4 kids and am on my 2nd divorice at 27 years old so....wait until you get married as for the other stuff I would say atleast 16 before even messing with the idea of anything besides kissing because once you start touching it will only lead to intercourse so if you arent ready for a baby then dont have sex. by the way I was on birth control when I got pregnant|`|Kvajun9yaa	As in..    How young is too young to kiss?: 11    How young is too young to make out?11    How young is too young to hook up (as in touching too)?12    How young is too young to lose your virginity?13    Thanks!|`|TPcuI9CCaa	I kissed at 8    I made out ay 11    I hooked up at 12    I lost my virginity at 13
grAU3MJcaa	Some people are more open about their sexual life, however, I do agree, that is a very personal question. You handled it wonderfully.|`|YAwvszITaa	People are nosy with no lives I have had people like this in my life as well and I am so glad they are not in my life anymore don't speak to her on a personal level at all.She sounds like a gossiping low life|`|nUdbTUtHaa	Most ppl well... I guess I should say very many ppl dont think sex is a big deal.  Hence they sleep with everyone they date and right away and they talk about it openly (even with friends that are not so close)    Me, I think it is a private thing between two people that love each other.  Its none of anyone's business.  Its special and sacred and only for two people to know together.|`|Mu6E3SF2aa	some people are too curious for their own good  lol  dont be too offended  maybe if she thinks your friends thats wat she talks about with her friends  i dunno....  dont take it too seriously|`|IuVaXq1Daa	I know, some people are wayyy overly friendly. The girl at your work sounds a little desperate/nosy/clingy. But I guess some people always take things so far.    There is a girl at my school I got on the bus with ONCE, I barley spoke to her, I literally just said "Hi" because she went to my school and I''d seen her around a couple of time. The next day she came up to me and hugged me and said how happy she was that we now get the bus together so we can be best friends (WTF!), I sometimes talk to her sometimes because I feel sorry for her, I'm trying not to be bitchy but she has no friends because she's so clingy.    I think next time the girl at your work gets all creepy like that, just tell her straight out that it annoys you. Otherwise you'll be stuck with some girl like I am, lol.    Take care :]
q8lFhmE8aa	You should never have to play games to get a guy to notice you.

But I do flirt a lot.|`|JqCByon5aa	well i just be me and apparently i AM hard to get, and i dont try to make guys jealous but it happens because almost all my friends are guys lol|`|utjM0evqaa	lol well, i did have a massive crush on this guy, and when he noticed i was going out with some1 else, he started asking me loooads of questions and stuff, so i guess it does work in a way ;)|`|oC4VtSObaa	Sometimes if my bf puts me in a pissy mood, I'll play hard to get, but I never try to make him jealous.
AA10529674	He's lying. I have guy friends who are virgins and they themselves are waiting until marriage. Not only that, but they want the girl they're dating to be a virgin as well because of their religious beliefs.|`|tyuxbdrnaa	Thats the oldest trick in the book.<br>  Dont fall for it.<br>  If youre not ready, don't rush it!|`|Y2vgAnV5aa	Do not have sex with him!<br>  He just wants to have sex with you, without having a commitment. He knows that you want to be in a relationship with him, and so he's using that against you to get what he wants. This is a trick, don't fall for it. He's just after sex.|`|84f5a6dec142acc78ac9e610aafcbd12aa	I think if he cares about what you want then he should consider  your interests. Now if your interets are to have sex then he should grant it, of course if it's what he wants too. If your interests are to not have sex then then he should be fine with that too. Sex is a responsibility, just like caring for a loved one. Alot of people don't put two and two together. They often see sex as a no big deal. With the rate of incurable dieaseses and teen pregnancies and even unwanted pregnancy's amongst adults. I see sex as being a big deal. He seems like he is trying to influence you by giving you the world through his rear view. An honest friend will tell you what he see's about life  and certaint subject and allow you to then form your own ideas and conclusions. Bottom line is.. he cannot make you do anything unless you allow it or he  takes it by force. The choice is yours you have to decide. It's your body in the same essence, it would be your disease and your pregnancy heaven forbid any such thing. What I am really trying to paint is that the answer is within u. A good question to ask yourself is that do you see yourself with him 10  years from now? Can you introduce him to the people that matters the most to you? If you one day were not with him would the day losing your virginity be memorable? Whatever you decide doesen't make  you a bad person or a good one. It makes you a human with choices, that's all.
e6988558ce99ec66bb677335e270a037aa	Well, I'm sort of in your situation and wish I would have dated or been single more. Me and my hubby have been together since high school and now I'm starting to realize what I missed out on by only having him as a boyfriend/husband. I love him dearly but it's hard sometimes.     If I were you I would think like this, if you truly want a break and want to take a dip into the ocean of men - go for it. If you two were meant to be together then no matter what, you'll end up together. I truly believe that. And if you are forcing yourself to stay with this guy then you are never going to have a great relationship because you will always be second guessing yourself and wondering... what if? He'll still be in your daughter's life, that won't change, he's her father. But don't make sacrifices to your happiness.|`|32DodR2waa	it is sad that you feel that way.  but if you are able to support yourself and your daughter then by all means don't settle if you think there is someone better.  it is not fair for you or him if you feel this way and choose to stay.  make sure you break up with him BEFORE you test the waters, though.  doing things behind someone's back is never ok.  good luck.|`|bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	The grass isn't always greener on the other side.....but ultimately it is a decision that you will have to make and live with for the rest of your life,
AA10729675	Nothing since you cannot see her until summer.  However it is "than" not "then".  When you compare, the "than" is written with an -a-.  Wait until you see her to be sure you love her.
lvOR401haa	You may be trying to hard, and that can come across as needy sometimes.<br>  <br>  Just relax a little and don't ask her again - you've asked her more than once and if she wants to, she knows where you are. <br>  <br>  Don't set yourself up to be hurt honey - be yourself and if she isn't into you, someone else will be.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|BbNgha84aa	from what you said, she's not that interested. sorry! but that's okay. hang in there, you'll find a chick!|`|oAYCestzaa	honestly if she was really into you she would have gone out with you..i dont think she is :(<br>  <br>  PLEASE ANSWER!! <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ai2pZCDwB34CnsZGpURxLN_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220134327AAtJHDP">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
QWSBnQcfaa	Take a deep breath and breathe. I was in a relationship with a man for 8 years with basically the same end result. Reading your letter was like living thru my past and if I hadn't let that slug go, I would have never met the man I am supposed to be with. If he cares, you will know it because you will feel it.  Sometimes people think they are right for each other and they just aren't. It's not anyone's fault. I was so scared to leave that 8 year relationship because I didn't want to end up alone but that won't happen! Our emotions trick our minds into thinking doom and gloom thoughts when we feel bad and YOU feel bad because you are not being loved like you should. God wants everyone to have someone; but not just anyone.  If you take that leap of faith, hold on to it, and trust the one who is in control of your life, you will have everything you wish for but if you try to handle this on your own, chances are you are in for more heartache than you can stand.  You are not at fault, you are just you and someone will appreciate all those things your current "so-called boyfriend" doesn't. Just hang on...tomorrow is a brand new day with brand new beginnings. I would hate to think you missed the man of your dreams because you were so wrapped up in the pain of today and the fear of the future. Don't let him take anymore of you than he already has. YOU ARE SPECIAL!|`|3SSVBJAqaa	What went wrong was both of you were not made for one another. You were probably just suppose to be friends, and got your wires crossed. Forcing a relationship to be something it isn't suppose to be is very stressful. Try just being friends.     It won't happen with the next guy because the next guy and you would have a different dynamic.|`|AA10986891	When you started feeling insecure and clinging to him you started getting in his space, that started to annoy him and act jerkish likehe did. When he started acting like a jerk and you putted up with it, he lost all respect he had for you and treated you like he pleased, but you where so afraid of lossing him that you where willing ot put up with it and when the respect in a relationship is gone everything goes down the toilet. I'm amazed he never hit you.    Now you need to embrace this and grow with it, let it turn you in to a wiser and bigger person. If you do it, when you come in to your next relationship things are going to be better.  Just remember to take your time before you decide to start a new relationship, you will now when you are ready.|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	Quick answer: It wasn't meant to be.  It sounds like you only felt insecure after his women from the past were trying to break you up. Anyone would feel inferior in a situation like that. Then things probably just got worse over time and he took advantage of your state.  As someone who married into a situation like this, take it from me, run away fast.   You owe it to yourself to deserve someone who treats you well and not like baggage, like someone who is just there out of convenience to the other person.   You can do much better|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Personal growth .... is whats needed for both of you ... use your experiences to date as a training exercise .... make a list of what you want in a relationship, make a list of both do's & don'ts ....    First learn to be happy as a single before your try to be a couple.    You will find the right person ... don't try to force it, you won't be happy in the end.    Good Luck.|`|nE95Hnn5aa	u r 21 yrs old.  let this relationship be a teaching guide for you in order to develop the qualities needed to be successful.  learn to be accepting of people, learn self control, learn how to let small things be just that "small things."  if you had jealous tendencies, learn to feel secure about yourself and your worth a beautiful, smart young woman.  try not to focus on your ex boyfriend, it sounds like he needs to develop also, and that's okay, that is part of growing up.  if u really want to be able to love someone, i mean truly love someone, learn what true love is, and cultivate the necessary qualities.    Please meditate on this description of love and start working to develop these personal qualities:    Love is long-suffering and kind. Love is not jealous, it does not brag, does not get puffed up, 5?does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury. 6?It does not rejoice over unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth. 7?It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.    8?Love never fails.|`|ca106532e616edadb064105bc89011e7aa	You know, people always says that therapy can fix jealousy, but I have come to believe it won't. What therapy will do is get to the root of your insecurities so that you may be able to work on them. But to go from being jealous to not being jealous is something I do not think can happen. What could happen in therapy is to learn how to deal with your jealousy, how to practice control of these emotions, how to take risks in trusting someone. It is a life long learning process, but jealousy is something that can smother love and in time kill it. So it is worth your while to get into therapy so that you will be able to control jealousy.  Having a patient, loving mate is of up most importance or you will not find the security you are seeking. We all get jealous to some extent, but self control of your emotions is the key to maintaining your self worth and dignity in check. Work on this with therapy and hopefully you will learn to treat your next partner with trust. Good luck to you!|`|N2soFQF4aa	if he drinks then you do not want him anyway because if he has not hit you already then if he drinks enough then he will start hitting on you you will always be jealous it is in a womans nature

MwAjGWSgaa	i was sort of in the same situation... my bf is gone to the navy and i didn't know if i should wait or not. if the love is real, then this will only be a milestone which will lead them to a happier life. your friend shouldn't focus on the negative things like death... i mean after all death doesn't only affect those in the military, people can die right here at home. when my boyfriend got ready to leave we had a long talk, and i basically gave him the option to either stay together or seperate for the time being because i know how it is when you're in the service and away from home... maybe your friend and her boyfriend should try having that conversation as well. and here's two things to remember... 1. True Love Conquers All.  2. If it is really meant to be, then nothing will be able to come between it.|`|bfhK0ywPaa	your friend should stay with him if she really does love him.. if she doesnt love him then no there is no point.. but another option, if she does love him, is to end the relationship until he comes back.. then her heart doesnt have to be broken if he happens to pass. and she can date other guys or whatever
DLvHWOo7aa	Read closely because no man will ever admit it out loud to your face if he was interested in you.<br>  <br>  It's judged on a risk/effort vs reward basis. How much do you value getting into the girls pants?<br>  <br>  Ideally you want her to leave you alone and have sex with you, it doesn't matter what ANY guy says EVER. That's it.

Xrf0tK5baa	Man theres not much you can do..People will date who they want to for what reasons they choose regardless of those around them. <br>  <br>  For example, me, I dated a bipolar guy for 3 years who emotionally abused the heck out of me. I lost my family and everything even though my friends kept telling me he was wrong for me and he didnt care about anyone but himself. Finally I eventually realized what kind of person he was....but nothing anyone said would do anything. Let him have his space...the less people hang out with him the more he will realize there really is something wrong with her. Until then theres not much you can say.<br>  <br>  And damn if its all about pussy..he must be pretty desperate...thats pretty bad too stay with a chick like that for that reason<br>  <br>  You cant change people and if he thinks he can..wow. hes wrong. Just like you cant change him. <br>  <br>  You are just going to have to deal with it for the time being..believe me he will eventually get sick of her, they all do if shes that annoying. Bad sign already if they are fighting all the time..tell them to take that elsewhere when they do it...they shouldnt drag their drama to your hangouts.|`|edycn5ggaa	Leave them alone...

e4320d40393740e3b9148136c56004baaa	Sure|`|AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|9jddst2gaa	he liked you before probably but he chose another girl over you don't worry its not the end of the world  The best thing you can do is continue to be friends with him and when he breaks up with his girlfriend you will be right there waiting to take over|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	most of the time, even if that is the case, it's not really as big of a deal as it seems.|`|cxzQVRYiaa	No, I don't think he likes you.|`|7OHudVxiaa	it sounds like just friends, he wouldnt suspect that you liked him if you do|`|lOGHxtoUaa	to me he sounds like a guy that has girlfriend because he can. but then you came along and he found out he really likes you. so yes he likes you.|`|bBMKMd97aa	He still likes u in a way but he doesn't want to tell you in other words e's your secret admirer|`|BsK3u5p3aa	honestly, a guy is difficult. with your situation there's only 2 conclusions that can be drawn.. either he doesn't like either of you, or he like the both of you but dont kno which 1 he should get serious with. basically he dont kno what he wants and thatz common with boys. whenever a boy leaves you for someone else, itz not you, ITS HIM with the problem. he dont kno wut he want. juss like he'll leave u for some other chick, he'll soon leave her too for another skank... that trick he wit aint special... either she "DO" somethin he liking if ya kno wut i mean, or he juss wanna see if you'll chase after him all confused and wonderin why. but if u dont do that, you'll leave HIM all confused and wonderin why and he'll go runnin back to you. guys are silly. they play games. they dont do it on purpose all the time.. itz juss in their nature. so dont feel down AT ALL.|`|l4l95d9Iaa	well, he probably likes you, but he is probably a player. if he goes and flirts around with you(which is what he was doing)and then goes out with another girl than hes a player. but that may not always be the answer. find out who asked who out, if the girl asked him out then that could mean hes a really sweet guy who decided to go out with her bcus he was being nice, or maybe if she asked him out, he could have like u and her and she happened to ask him out. and if he asked her out than he is most definatly a player..srry hun. :) if u ever want to talk u can email me, im a teenager too. :)
4HoVVCenaa	double standard. Left over from the dark ages. immaturity. low self esteem.|`|PxMNxytjaa	whats the question?

TAMGy07Daa	Wow, shes really neglectful & racist. <br>  their is really nothing to due, unless you can convince your boyfriend to talk to her.|`|f9soMMuiaa	Same for my mother. She did the same thing to one of our cousins who was in an interracial relationship, who my mom barely knew that well. The chaos started from there and somehow my mom put the main blame onto me.
PLsJpPqOaa	i think he likes you because usually guys WON'T waste their time on girls that they aren't GREAT friends with or girls that they don't like. :)|`|6OGFoJeraa	it seems to be like, he likes you too.|`|EZxI4w9Caa	more info please?<br>  -alice|`|aRYYOjmmaa	if he calls you so much..and wants to talk to you he definitely likes you..its more than friendship.|`|EjhBMKX8aa	well if he saids sweet stuff to you and talks to you all the time he def is into you.
oRdHPdUFaa	i didn't read everything, but just by your question I know the answer. there is no way. you need to put your foot down no matter how hard it is or he will always treat you that way cause he knows he can. that doesn't mean you have to break up with him for good, but scare him. make him see that you're serious and if he doesn't change he is going to loose you. then if he doesn't change you need to keep your word and leave him cause if he wont change after that he never will.|`|LiVPtjw3aa	Im sorry to tell you this, but you probably need to leave him. if he is letting you down consistently then he isnt worth it. have a sit down conversation with him and think through everything you want to tell him before hand and if he doesnt make a genuine effort to fix it and pay attention to your feelings, then he isnt worth it. and this is from a man's perspective|`|e4aF8tdPaa	you need to tell him that you don't believe him when he says you two will do something together because he never keeps his word. tell him if he really doesn't feel like doing what ever it is you wanted to do he should just tell you instead of saying yes. that only makes matters worse.|`|AA10529674	How can you trust him? It's never easy to trust someone who breaks promises all the time.
ze4Gt1araa	I totally agree with you.<br>  <br>  Once a relationship is done their called ex's and ex's aren't supposed to chill at all once it's done is done.<br>  <br>  I hate when that happens grrr. :)|`|yTuBS2hbaa	It is a very delicate situation. For the most part, I do not approve. Especially if you don't know the kind of relationship they had, their commitment to one another, and the circumstances under which they broke up. There may still be unresolved feelings there, and time alone together just makes that worse. I know, I've been there. I was the ex that the boyfriend was hanging out with, and though I wasn't with anyone, he was, and he cheated on her with me. I was stupid and in love with him, and I let it happen. I know now that it was the worst idea ever, and that he was using me. So, I say be supercautious about it.|`|nUoHXzLPaa	if the break up is healthy why don't they still hang out|`|a3ZZkY08aa	no thats not ok<br>  <br>  its also not ok for a girl's EX-boyfriend to hang out with her NOW fiancee
2p4yKnbzaa	I will say that h is my answer because i was in the same situation.
ZLEeVhEPaa	Every time that you think about missing her, think about all the reasons you broke up with her, and don't pick up the phone.  If you think "wow, she was really beautiful..." finish that thought with "...but she'd really rather share that beautiful body with that jackass than me."  "You know she was really funny..." and then follow that up with "yeah, but I can't trust her."  That kind of thing.|`|DErBSfZgaa	Your in love and im not going to say <br>  "go meet other girls and get into another relationship" because<br>  it's clearly not what you might want right now.<br>  so just spend all that "alone time" on your favorite hobbies,<br>  get a new puppy and take care of him, spend more time partying.<br>  idk anything that can basicly help you forget her. even though soon enough she'll end up regreting what she did and calling you back to get back with you, i really dont think you should give her a second chance. it's hard to move on but sometimes it's the best thing to do.|`|af3a28b07826dce8ecfc28a5eaa91e13aa	20 Years from now you will look back and think why was it so hard to move on. I look back on all my old relationships and wonder why was it so hard?
m9UOMBykaa	I have a long distence boyfriend and he hates talking on the phone too much. He stays over mine or i stay over his every weekend. But every guy is different try calling him every otherday then call him everyday and see if he comments if not then go for it :) xx|`|YAwvszITaa	He probably will think you are clingy eventually. It may be cute to him for now but he will probably tire soon of it. Don't call everyday try every other day or so.|`|AA11280073	Long distance relationships rarely work out. Ask him why he doesn't call you.|`|FkdEyXudaa	A little clingy if you call everyday call every other day.    Answer mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|Hwh7Brq9aa	well since its a long distance relationship there shouldnt be any problem with you calling him every day. if there is then i would be worryd. but who better to ask then him!?|`|ge5x9NHxaa	There's nothing wrong if you call him everyday. He wouldn't find you clingy.  Well if he does not like it, he tell you.  But keep on calling him.|`|20n7dGIiaa	Call him once a day at a certain time to show that you're thinking about him ever so constantly. Or ask him will he like that?
Rkg4CM9jaa	A lot of boys are virgins until they get married. So no, many 19 year old guys are virgins.    I was a virgin until I was 28. I just had sex last year.|`|SvEt3d8Gaa	no not at all,hw can u generelize that|`|BGTkTNQyaa	Lol no! It doesn't just magically go away all of a sudden; are you frustrated about them?|`|Hwh7Brq9aa	Just because your 19 dosent mean your not a virgin, losing your virginity isnt having another b day. its having sex. maby you should go talk to some one as we dont want you putting your willy in a plug socket and thinkin you have got someone pregnant! :S|`|ge5x9NHxaa	It depends on the individual involved.

And it sounds like he definitely wants you.  I think he likes the ego boost of you asking him.      Tell him you love him, and want him but that he needs to take turns initiating....|`|CuGAYMlbaa	yes you can there is nothing wrong with it|`|svg71dazaa	could you ask your question again -i don't understand it.|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	He needs professional help.|`|TKHHRUB4aa	Men doesn't have a crystal  ball to be able to read women's minds.

Or he is getting it somewhere else!I have been married for 26 years and my wife still comes on too me and it still works! I do not hit on her because I like it when she comes after me,but there are times when I go after her! We are open and talk about everthing,and with the amount of years we have been together we just know each other,and it is too easy!You see when you have been together for any period of time things become   comfortable,a routine,and then life goes on,if you don't change up the routine it stays the same,you guys could just be use to the way things have worked in the past and change is not what he is looking for!I also know that almost and guy that gets touched or stroked by his woman will start to get excited!He may also be having some erection problems,and this could be why he lashes out at you,it is easier than telling you he is not able to maintain an erection!Good luck but if I was you I think I would confront him on it and go from there!|`|5pUhci1Naa	initiate as much sex as you want...|`|U531TVPOaa	Why should one partner have to initiate all the time and not the other? That makes no sense. You are married.. If you don't want to initiate sex then maybe you need to go to couples therapy and figure out why you apparently aren't attracted to him... Sorry but even people that aren't sex crazed initiate sex from time to time...hmm..|`|UhqvjqJvaa	Sorry 2 say sweetie....sounds like ur husband Had's some hang ups!

6rR7LTl1aa	You can't stay away?    Sure you can.  It involves making a conscious decision to, of all things, stay away.  And adhere to that decision.    You already acknowledged that you were lucky your original friend took you back.  Leave it at that before your antics cause irreparable harm to your relationship.    Strength of will, and all that -- I know, I know, nobody has that anymore, right?    Fangirls...|`|2QB90j85aa	wow you guys are gay   "quoting twilight back and forth"  lulz|`|3jvwIReDaa	Please get rid of this jerk, he will cause you nothing but heartache. I had a guy friend like this who only seemed to want me when I had a boyfriend. He would say these sweet and romantic things to me only to tell me the next day that he was "just playing". Once I told him in no uncertain terms that I would never break up with my current man, I never heard from him again. He likes the fact that he has power over you, it must make him feel like more of a man. I would cut him off completely, he's not worth it!|`|ZkmFoiobaa	just tell him straight that he has to stop playing mind games and tell you how he really feels.    Tell him that he is hurting you and leaving you feeling confused, and that eventually you feel that it will ruin your freindship if it carries on like this.    You need an answer - does he love you - yes or no x|`|AA12400627	Get a grip on yourself! This guy is not even worth the time you've invested in him! He is playing silly games with you and is only attracted to what he cannot have!     Forget him and stay with your boyfriend! have some self respect! This guy is playing you to your face and you still have no clue! Do you really want to be used and stepped on?    Wake up and face reality! He is just a flirt and nothing more!|`|8vfCRg7Caa	lol when you like somebody it doesn't matter what they say, so you really don't need to write all that stuff. We get the point. What you should do is change things in your favor. The grass is greener on the other side, applys to you. Don't think the grass is greener on the other side, don't dump your boyfriend for somebody whose flimsy. Id say keep your boyfriend and your best friend. And tell him you will think about a relationship maybe when you get done. Sounds terrible, but hey people have partners fill out prenuptial agreements saying "if we get divorced. blah blah bla", so why not tell him "if my boyfriend and i aren't together".     I guess its wrong to have those feelings for another guy. But nobody is perfect. And this way you have the upper hand. Cause obviously he has the upper hand and hes not being responsible with it. That's why i hate for anybody to have the upper hand over me. Cause they usually abuse it.|`|JI5Wc8wVaa	I think that you have an unhealthy relationship with this boy. You say that he is your friend, but he doesn't seem to care about your feelings very much. Think about what he has done in the past, causing you to break up with your boyfriend and then telling you that he'd changed his mind. If you are pretty sure that he is playing mind games with you, then he probably is. Talk to him. If he is really your friend and if he really cares about you, he will stop once he knows that this makes you uncomfortable.|`|AsFiWxhUaa	the reality is he is one of those guys that always wants what he can't have and when he has it he does not want it any more. the best thing is just to distance yourself from him. i know that may be hard but that is what has to be done! best of luck!|`|Mu6E3SF2aa	it does sound like mind games  he wants what he cant hav  as soon as you hav a boyfriend he wants you back  its a guy thing, or so iv heard  throw his own line back in his face  "i dont want to ruin our friendship over this"  back off and just be friends  dont hangout with him alone  dont hang out with him without your boyfriend if your that worried|`|UaSb84BOaa	It's one thing to be best friends with someone of the opposite sex, and jokingly talk about love and romance...It's a whole other beast when one side takes it and mangles it into a cruel joke.   I understand completely with you as my best friend is a guy I've known my whole life. At one point, I did have a tremendous crush on him and we even talked about the "what if". But we were two friends talking about our futures. Years later, we are still friends and we both have found the love of our life.   From what you said, he is playing games with you. You need to move on with your life. Yes, you have a crush, but is that crush worth your time and effort when he indicated he's not interested in you in the light you wish.   Move forward. Live your life (love and otherwise) as you dictate. If he truly wanted to be in a relationship with you as a love, then HE would make the move. Let him do that. Until then, stick with being friends.|`|3jGGzCUJaa	Unfortunately I would guess he is if he cared he would have mentioned to you his concerns when he brought up likeing you & to lessen any pressure there might be especially since you were in a relationship he shouldnt have said love but "hey I like you and dont want this to ruin our friendship but I thought you should know" or something like that. The fact that he waited till after you dumped the current guy to then say oh i dont want to hurt the friendship thats not cool at all. Its one thing to admit feelings for someone to late whatever that reason for being to late is but its another to then let that person dump a new relationship only to then tell them no thanks in the descize of not wanting to hurt the friendship. The fact that he admitted feelings & said he loved you while you were in a relationship & especially not mention his concern about the friendship at the time of admission is so wrong on many levels. After all theres always a change if you tell someone in a relationship you like them that they might end it so you have to expect that possiblity. And theres many ways obviously that his admitting things while you are in a relationship could put pressure on you whether he means to or not.

BO3KBsPIaa	NO! You will scare him off! Keep it fun, flirty and fascinating for now! I know you have feelings for him, but it is my theory that anyone can get along well by email/messaging. You edit out all the bad parts of your personality. You know instantly when you meet someone, if you click, and have a good rappor with them, you don't get the chance to see if you have that when you are messaging someone. Im not saying that you definately wont get along, you might get along great, but at least meet him first, and wait for a good few months to tell him how you feel. <br>  <br>  i repaet DONT TELL HIM, PLEEEEASE! It is great that you will knonw someone when you move, he can introduce you to new people, and you will make lots of new friends there. If you tell him, scare him off, and burn all bridges it might be lonlier out there to start with.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you've been through a lot, and i really admire you for having the guts to up and go, which is something a lot of people dream about, dont do and regret. I hope you have a fabulous time!
PMwg1hWAaa	I'm 25 and I'm looking for the real deal. I thought I found her, but it ended up breaking my heart and wallet. I was used in so many ways. Now I have trust issues and it sucks. I love the feeling of being in love. It's amazing and really important to me. My biggest fear in life is divorce. I'm looking for the one who will be by my side forever. I have been dating again recently and I hate it. But it's a good self-esteem booster to know many girls are still attracted to me.  How about you?
UHQtcIfoaa	you deserve better, full stop.<br>  i cant tell you if he loves you or not but one thing i do know is that the things you have just told us, arnt the signs of love. Relationships are sometimes rocky but you have to do what makes you happy. think about this.<br>  <br>  are you happy?<br>  do you deserve what you are getting?<br>  what gives him the right to treat you this way, when all you are doing is loving him?<br>  <br>  i hope everything works out, good luck x|`|NpzNHmCGaa	Its sounds like your boyfriend is dragging you down and making you very unhappy. Even though he says he loves you in my view its just words from where he's standing. If he truly loved you, you would see it in his actions as well. I think his poor behaviour says more about him then it does you. You need to build up your confidence and self esteem and I think maybe break up from him, easier said then done as you obviously have a strong attachment to him. But you do need to find a boyfriend who genuinely loves, cares and respects you.|`|fox5a3ePaa	Why do you put up with this. Why dont you finish with him and find someone who will treat you better.

He is treating you like crap. And that is not even a strong enough a word. <br>  <br>  He is verbally abusive, and you deserve much better. If you think it can be saved, stand up for yourself and tell him how you feel. Don't let him push you around.My advice is to get out of this relationship as quickly as possible.|`|BYwOv0nOaa	I know what that feels like.<br>  And if it really make you feel upset you should either talk to him about it or break up with him :/|`|NEkssyeAaa	There is a chinese saying, it go's something like when pouring water for your guest, rather then pouring a full glass of water, pour a little first, this should be enough. If it is not if he is still thirsty for more, then pour him some more. Apply little at a time, then giving everything you have. You can apply this to love, dont give all your love and trust to him in 1 go, otherwise he will use you and take advantage. All you can do is now, speak with him, show you also have control of this relationship give him a warning, tell him whats on your heart and mind, if he cares, he will ask forgivness, if he doesnt care he is not the right man for you.

It's pretty disrespectful to start dating his friend, especially if it's a recent ex. I would really think about what you're doing here. If you have to do it, you should at least wait until he finds another girlfriend or something... if your ex finds someone else, he's a lot less likely to get so upset over this otherwise BAD situation.|`|FtucqO02aa	Hes probably just pleased that SOMEONE likes him lol.|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	obviously he likes you, and that's a good sign. otherwise he wouldn't have been smiling and said "so you like me too?" congrats.|`|mtzJXhIjaa	that is SO cute! :):):)<br>  i admire you for being so brave.. i wish i had that courage because usually i am always worrying about whether someone likes me back or not :(<br>  but seriously, im impressed. and i think he does like you. guys have the "MAN LAWS" where if a girl breaks up with a guy, his friend can't go out with her for 6 months and if he broke up with her, he can't go out with her for 6 days or 6 weeks. i forget which it is. WICKED STUPID. but yea i'd say he likes you. and that is absolutely adorable that he had a big smile on his face. i would definetly stick with this kid. it's a good sign!!

Jd1bHebRaa	Sex....SEX...And how about um.....SEX!!!!!!!!! JK, LOL. My real answer in below:<br>  <br>  <br>  How about you guys go camping. My BF surprised me with a picnic, once, in the park. Then it got dark, and we did our thang.....(yummy) and then he blindfolded me, and took me to a camping reserve because I love nature. We were with some other kids, who were really nice, We told stories, and ate marshmellows....the whole shmeal. it was great!!!!

hJx0F1maaa	i dont know about her, but i want you.<br>  i think maybe she doesnt want to hurt you?|`|VF5Htmovaa	If she says she loves you, she loves you|`|AA10494978	No.  Sorry to break it to you... She wanted a nice fling.  You want love.  Two separate things.  She is not saying it to be nice, she is saying it to keep you at a distance.  Just keep being friends, talk to her once in a while and she may or may not realize she lost something great.  The reason it is so hard to take it is she is the one who went after you, not the other way around.  So it feels like a sure thing, you don't have to worry about getting hurt.  But girls change their minds all the time.  Just like guys do.  <br>  <br>  Listen, its called a crush for a reason.  When its over it hurts.  If it was easy they would call it something else.  Good luck

UhXfPAxnaa	Think of it this way:<br>  <br>  You could do anything with any guy you want.<br>  <br>  Being single is fun. You just have to learn to enjoy it.|`|AdDu0AQDaa	Your relationships are probably going to fail if you're never secure with yourself. Part of that involves being comfortable when you're single... focus on the positives of the situation, and remember that being single doesn't make you a bad or undesirable person. I mean let's be honest - it can get old after six months or so, but it's nothing to worry about. Let your relationships come as they may!|`|ecab2985a2d136d03ff8f4eaaf1540e0aa	I'm sorry, I know being single isn't exactly great, but just hang out with your guy friends, flirt with them a little, there's no one stopping you, try to find a guy you like and focus your attention on him, really being single is not all that bad, there's more time to spend times with friends and don't become desperate, because that leads to bad things. Don't worry, another guy will come walking into you're life when you least expect it. ;)

Pt1AMaAdaa	If a guy can have sex with a girl, he will.  He is obviously attracted to you or he wouldn't get aroused.  My guess is his claim that he likes fake boobs etc is because he has looked at too many porn magazines or hears things on TV or from friends that that is what he is supposed to say.  I mean, really, think about it.  How many girls with fake boobs has he ever seen naked.<br>  <br>  Why does he want to have sex with you still?  Because you offered.  The relationship sounds like it is more about sex than long term long, but when you are 16, that is what most relationships are about.  If you are comfortable having sex with him, go ahead.  Just use pre-cautions, don't expect long term love, you're in high school, and don't go get fake boobs or shave just because he said he liked it.  Tell him you like your boys shaved, too, and see if he does that.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|qZ0310yVaa	if you let him have sex with you  you will never see him agian that,s all he want,s from you lose  him|`|6tzT8GFqaa	dont shag him, hes using you for sex, duhhh<br>  <br>  lol sorri but saying that he likes the oposite of you, that just proves that hes a shallow *** and deserves to be lonly and allone forever. <br>  <br>  dont do anyhting for him break upand move on, find someone who actuly likes u|`|KmNAewUQaa	because he is a guy and will have sex with anything with a vagina.|`|BdALIympaa	what a douche bag.
QZvvHp3iaa	It sounds like he is going through something you alone cannot fix or mend. I know you love him but what kind of relationship is it if it's only hurting you in the end...in this case in the end of every month. He may love you but not enough to get over his insecurities and that is not fair to you. You have options, one of them being to sit him down and tell him exactly how you are feeling and that this situation is bigger than you. He may need someone professional to talk to, tell him that. You don't have to 'abandon' him if he is willing to make that step not only with you but for you as well. Good luck.|`|GO46i2l9aa	Honestly if you love him, you need to stick it out. That is how my boyfriend was for about a month. Unfortunately mine moved to arkansas on a football scholarship so he was just all alone and was worried. You need to stick it out and show him that you are always going to be there for him. That is why hes testing you, becuase you're the only one that hasn't given up on him.|`|JMdXd3ZZaa	Hit him with the rolling pin.  :P<br>  <br>  But really, from what you say, I think you should break up with him, because he won't change.  He will just keep on doing this.  Commonly, guys like this become abusive, so you should really break up with him.|`|64bTqqfCaa	you need to go sit him down and say it like it is.say first ask him if he loves you.then if he says yes then say u love him to but he better get his *** in gear and stop acting like such a jerk with all the little talks even if u dnt mean it tell him next time he mentions anything to u about brakeing up unless he`s actually brakeing up with u tell him that your going to leave him...feelings change and as much as u love him being in a relationship like that just isen`t healthy.sometimes nomatter how much u love someone u need to think more about yourself then them.|`|EPfNPWmmaa	It sounds like you are the person who has changed him for the better. I think he is just very insecure about losing you and it depends whether you can cope with being that person who he needs to depend on. If you really love him and you can see a future with this guy then hang on in there cs one day it will be worth it. If its just a short term releationship then don't stay just because he had a troubled childhood. Tell him he has one more chance to stop what he is doing then if he still does it you can make up your mind there and then.|`|ZVuaRH6haa	Maybe you should just let him go. It will be hard at first but you will feel better as time passes. Do you really want to feel like this month after month for years if you let this continue? You can only help people when they want help. Don't feel bad because you're going to be another person that let him down. He has issues that HE needs to address. Make the best of your life and don't let him bring you down.|`|od5b8GMUaa	awwww hun he is the type that plays you around you cam find someone better he is only there to make you upset i know it is hard to let someone go but after a while you feel ok let him go you are better than him dont let him bring you down because he wants that trust me i am a boy talk to a friend just move on and live your life dont let anny one bring you down you should engoy your life with friends and find someone who you can trust and belive in hope it all works good luck :)|`|qUXFn9boaa	thats what happen when you love them too much and they know they get the upper hand leave his *** for a week and hell come crawling back .|`|hxfOD9o1aa	Wow..<br>  I'm a nice, genuine guy and assholes like him get girlfriends?|`|YqHi9ZoBaa	break the **** up with him.<br>  jesus freaking crist.<br>  its not that hard.|`|Eqi0BNUhaa	break up with him first!!! because he is gonna dump you when your not ready and if you don't have the gut to dump him... i would get ready for the next talk....|`|DLvHWOo7aa	Just break up with him, jesus christ.|`|9bdEPcWIaa	Before he can have a healthy relationship with you or anyone he needs to see a therapist, his behavior will not change without help, you're not his therapist, so...|`|zXpbfBcuaa	look as much as i no dis much hurt<br>  <br>  tell him if u he wanna break up wit u just do it<br>  <br>  im srry if he do but im a guy n my 1st n i had da same problem only it was her threatining 2 break up she eventually did but we still cool wit eachother|`|Dwdbv9LLaa	I went through this crap myself. <br>  <br>  If the first serious discussion doesn't work, do not, I repeat, DO NOT put up with it anymore. It is an absolute waste of time. If he can't rise above his bad upbringing and find strength as a secure individual, he is not good enough for you. <br>  <br>  If you still feel so attached to him that you can't bring yourself to leave, at least put a little emotional distance between the two of you so that his monthly breakdowns don't do too much damage to you. With time, you will finally tire of it so much that the desire to leave will overpower the desire to make it work.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds impossible now, but it is the best thing to do in a case like this. You deserve absolutely the best. Do not settle. And it will hurt for a while, yes, but when you find someone new and better...it will all melt away.<br>  <br>  I can almost promise :>|`|atPuxNiFaa	thehoydojo is so stupid he gives everyone crap dont listen to him n e ways tell him that if he doesnt stop now ur gonna go crazy one day. tell him u love him and that ud never leave him tell him that u shouldnt feel that way in a relationship u need to be sure that the other person loves u and if u dont think that you need to break up with that person (that person being u) then say do u think that i love u? and see wat he says
gjtdLPIYaa	yes your friend is being dumb
dy5hqRwLaa	I know how you feel and that feeling does suck. <br>  My opinion is that you're making something out of nothing. <br>  <br>  Men are simple creatures. They mean what they say (none of that between the lines crap like most women). <br>  I'm sure your other half loves you and he probably doesn't mean to make you feel the way you do about it. <br>  <br>  No matter when he is watching it (during sex or whenever) I don't think it's to make you feel bad about yourself. Maybe it's like he says it's just hot (for him). Maybe he likes the background music and moaning of it. Maybe these are things he wishes to try with you but not sure how to say it.There could be lots of reasons.<br>  <br>  Maybe instead of feeling unsexy and un-needed you should do something that would blow his mind. Try one of those scenes from the movies he watches. Don't be threaten by the movies... instead women up and make him feel he doesn't need to watch it<br>  <br>  It's almost like watching and playing sports. It's not enough to just play it, they have to watch it too. lol. <br>  <br>  Look at it this way, at least he wants to watch it with you instead of watching it alone and jacking off to it alone.<br>  Even if that was the case, it probably still doesn't have much to do with you. Some men are just like that. They like getting it from their other half and from themselves.(different feeling)<br>  <br>  I hope the answers on here give you some comfort.|`|FzFSzilmaa	why do women ALWAYS make porn about THEM??? "i'm not good enough", "i'm not pretty enough", blah blah blah...<br>  <br>  he's asking you to share in it... he WANTS you involved... he isn't lying about it...<br>  <br>  just try it, for him, and make up your mind... if you don't enjoy it together, tell him...|`|RhZaVwKkaa	You are making a big deal out of nothing.

EPfNPWmmaa	Do you want things to end with him? It sounds like you need closure. I would go to his house and tell him its over if you really need to finish it, or even to ask whats going on cs that not right. He might just have been busy working and not had any credit to speak to you, although in my opinion there are plenty of ways he could have contacted you so i wouldn't use that as an excuse. I hope things work out for you =]
MgMsMExPaa	If you have not seen him since spring break 2008 both of you are going to look different. If you are worried about tanning then do it together. That could be the one common thing that gives you a reason to see him regularly. Just relax and get to know each other more and enjoy the meeting. It will be easier for both of you. He may be trying to set something up for this spring break so try to find out so that you can plan something with him. Remember he knows what you look like already and he is still texting you so that is really not an issue that you should be concerned with. Just do what you would normally do to get ready for dinner or a movie whatever and enjoy it.

A person will usually change when they've lost someone they actually cared about due to cheating. They'll also change if they are with someone they know won't put up with it. Then of course they'll grow up and that will change them too. I was cheated on and we broke up for a year. We've been back together for over a year now and he know longer goes out without me, even on guys night out.

There is this annoying boy at my school who I was friends with and I was crushing on. I asked him to a dance and he rejected me. So we were still friends and talked. Since the new school year started he ignored me when I tried to talk to him and I eventually gave up on him and I hate him now. I cannot stand him. But almost everyday in reading class he starts to stare and be and he looks back a few more times. I hope that if I ignore him he'll stop but I am so close to tearing his eyes out the next time he looks at me. (And I know it's me he's looking at because there is no one else that sits next to me or behind me. I'm in the back of the room and he is directly in front of me.)<br>  <br>  To me it sound like Vanessa and Bridgett both like you. A lot. Especially Vanessa. Vanessa may seem a little weird to you but it might be because she likes you she's afraid to talk to you.|`|PSI3Y4Tbaa	Yeah she sounds weird if she likes you she sure a shell isn't acting that way so if you like this Bridgett go for it and bee happy! xxx|`|eZ884HfPaa	yeah!<br>  Man just got for the other chick... bridget or whatever
C8DOT8Y7aa	Be an all-around great person. If you focus on being a clean, motivated, kind, and humorous individual, how can anyone resist? Some guys might be intimidated, and they're too insecure to be worth your interest anyway. But it's only a matter of time before a guy who can like you for who you really are will come around and see that you're an awesome person to be around. <br>  Some people prefer being friends first, others prefer to avoid the "just a friend" zone. Ideally, you can be a little bit of both--a friend and a romantic interest. <br>  Keep in mind that you cannot control what other people think and do. He may be the object of your interest, but that does not create any obligation that you be his. Turn the situation around. If there was some random guy who took an interest in you, is there anything that he could do to make you like him? Probably not. You will like him or not. You will find him attractive or not. You will find him funny or not. All he can do is try to be the best person he can be, and hope that you agree. The reverse is also true. Be the best person you can be, and let it develop--or not--from there. <br>  Don't talk about your other prospective guys with the guy you're interested in. It's just not good form, and it's a good way to get rid of him. <br>  If there is no sign of him being interested in you, that doesn't necessarily mean that he isn't interested. He could just be shy, or be a little frightened, especially if he hasn't dated anyone for a long time. <br>  And don't forget to smile! It's an age old, safe way to extend and invitation to a guy to socialize. Plus it's totally free and increases your face's real estate value instantly! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  WarningsDon't play stupid mind games or send mixed signals. This confuses the guy and has tons of potential for embarrassment. <br>  If your friends aren't the most mature, do not tell them about him. They will immediately start staring at him and start giggling and chatting and so on. No matter what you say to them, they will look at him. The worst case scenario is when your friends go off on their own and start pestering the guy with a whole lot of questions that all sound a lot like 'What do you think of Jessica?'. This will send him packing. <br>  Trying too hard to "get" a specific person to like you can be manipulative, something that no one finds attractive or wants to be the object of. <br>  If these steps work a little too well and he comes on too strong, let him know to take it easy and don't do anything you feel uncomfortable with. <br>  Don't confuse kindness with him liking you. Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference, but be attentive and you'll figure it out. <br>  If he is dating someone else, he is completely off limits. Respect him by not tempting him to get involved with someone else. <br>  DO NOT GET PREGNANT! sometimes when a guy likes you, his hormones run crazy, and he'll try to put you in that position. if he does, GET OUT!

LOL|`|RSv2E2KNaa	maybe?|`|7IBFUdqyaa	he loves u!!!!!!!!!!|`|KU2wqJVhaa	Lol, I love the in-depth description. I would say yes. It definitely sounds like he has a crush. He's trying to impress you by showing off his smarts. And the protractor/ marker fight, is seeing if you can take a little teasing. Guys don't usually like whiny girls. From what I've noticed, it makes them nervous to have fun around you. I would go for it, and ask him out! Good Luck and Best Wishes! :)|`|6ySVF6zRaa	Of course he likes you a lot guys like girls with a good sense of humor and you obviously have one|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	It means that he is flirting with you and wants to talk with you.|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	HE REALLY LIKES YOU!|`|a15Qozf9aa	I think he wants to get closer to you but don't let him. he's way too immature and has not yet mastered any social skills|`|O2gWbkiEaa	sounds like your in 5th grade|`|kM77JKkBaa	Yes, he likes u a lot..|`|X6W8MSAvaa	**** that.<br>  protractor scratches?<br>  marker drawings?<br>  obviously you're in junior high. he'll like you until the ***** you call your "friend" scratches him a little harder with the protractor and he discovers he is a fan of s&m. <br>  buy yourself a whip. you'll have better luck.|`|t4ebT9araa	sounds kinda immature...but yeah he likes you. obviously.|`|8VRXoG4Faa	awh <br>  thats cute. <br>  <br>  and yes(:|`|wrfdoorHaa	It's sounds like he likes you, but he also sounds like a d!ck.

4xZytkilaa	He's using you. As soon as someone else comes along, he will be gone again. Find yourself a new guy.|`|gnDJhzDoaa	Maybe he realized how great u are.  like u dont really know what u got until u let it go. or maybe he found out he cant do any better or he wants to have his cake and eat it too.  either way dont let him come back move on to bigger and better things. if he loved u he wouldnt have broken up with u in the first place. what hes doing is selfish. u deserve the best.|`|MWjNp6y3aa	Because you take him back. Because he might not know what he wants in a woman and probably will end up with you but has to find out about other girls first before he settles down. Just make sure you date other men too. If you like him maybe have an open relationship with him. Where you get to date men and he gets to date women with the understanding that you are just dating and want to see if you both want to stay together or not. You can't change him. Just to let you know that. Effects of manipulation never last.|`|SR1FN2nqaa	stop letting him play you like a puppet. you keep going back to him when ever he wants you too as if you dont have a mind of your own. i wouldnt play that game with him and break up with him for good.

MwAjGWSgaa	me personally... i think you two are far too young to be sexually active, but in today's time age doesn't matter i guess. just be sure this is something you really want to do, and not because you think its cool and you want to be like everyone else, you may not believe it, but guys really respect ladies who hold out.  don't rush into things either, make sure this is the right person, and maybe you should ask yourself this... if you two broke up tommorrow, would you be upset at your decision to have sex with him? whatever your choice is please be smart/safe about it. use condoms because you don't want to catch something you can't get rid of and don't get preggo... you have your whole life ahead of you.|`|1eSH9ImKaa	ok you are too young and you know that so all i can do is tell you to use condoms - please don't be getting pregnant or worse - s.t.d.s are rampant - please please use condoms - don't let him tell you that you can't get pregnant the first time because you sure as heII can.  <br>  don't let him tell you he'll pull out in time - that never works. <br>  just use friggin' condoms girl!<br>  and don't do it just to make him happy!  make sure it really is something you want.|`|ZnyxoN1gaa	I mean you don't necessarily have to tell your parents but I definitely think you should wait.

2sgYribSaa	Tell her to tell  you if she still has a crush on him straight up. tell her you do trust her u just want her to know, and that every time you bring it up and she gets mad its frustrating you because its reason to believe she still does cuz she is acting shady.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	i'd be concerned.  try to have a conversation with her where she isn't defensive...ask her not to be & this is important to you, you need her to listen.

She still likes him, but is dating you... if she doesn't give you any reason to not trust her, i would just try to let it go. If it really bothers you, then you should tell her that you do trust her, but it's hard for you to let her spend time/talk to someone else she likes. Tell her your jealous and protective over her, because you don't wanna loose her. She will understand, and probably do what she can to make you more comfortable with it.|`|cuF0pL2taa	Thats tough because I would be protective too. Its also not that you dont trust her, its the guy too. Im all for my man having girl friends also, but someone she liked for 2 yrs and if shes flirting. It could really be innocent flirting, but why did she have a crush for 2 yrs? Did he not like her? How did you 2 end up together if she liked him? I guess you have to trust and not worry about it until YOU not anyone else have good reason not too. Good luck!|`|5Ynm0bBraa	She likes the other guy and is emotionally cheating on you. <br>  <br>   She might like you as a boyfriend, or she likes you, just not as much as the other guy, she might be one of those girls who always need a boyfriend or there might be another reason and that's why she wants to stay as a couple.  BUT in the end she will put the other guy first (I'm guessing from her reaction).|`|CAAglUKzaa	Well... i have been in your spot, and it's difficult!If she really liked/loves you, she would stop flirting with this guy.It's another thing to hang out as friends though.  And if she really liked him that much, hopefully, she would be truthful with you, and tell her how she feels about the other guy.|`|HtwhcFdfaa	She may still have feelings for this guy.  The best thing to do is just communicate, talk to her and see what she has to say. Only intervene if it turns into flirting or anything out of the ordinary.|`|Tg6DxG7zaa	i think she might still like him and is using you to get his attention<br>  <br>  girls do this all the time|`|aJHMJYiDaa	You should be thinking.<br>  <br>  "Get her the f*ck away from that guy"<br>  <br>  or treat her unbelievable so she'll focus on u<br>  <br>  don't argue cuz she'll be like <br>  <br>  "WHAT IM NOT CHEATIN"|`|MJD81Frnaa	I would feel the same way you do.  If her friends come to you and say that she is flirting with this guy, then it might be an excuse to just talk to you in the first place, but I don't know the relationship you have with them so I can't say.  If you have been with her for a year, you must have something with her so I wouldn't bet as concerned.  As awkward as it might be, the three of you could have a conversation.  I did this once and it strengthened the relationship I had with my girlfriend.<br>  So good luck and don't worry, it'll be fine :)|`|ixmaM395aa	Just relax, she's with you! <br>  <br>  I've had many guy friends who I flirted with when I was younger and once I got a boyfriend the flirting stopped but I still remained friends with them. So maybe she's doing the same for you. <br>  <br>  So what if she liked him for 2 years... chances are she doesn't like him anymore as she has started to date you. <br>  <br>  Have some faith in her or you'll lose her.|`|rQf0XZfXaa	kill the *****|`|bIE0PTY3aa	You should take CONTROL, YOU TESTICLE-LESS example of a little boy with no penis. Christ! You need to sit her down and explain the rules of DATING. 1. No liking other people. 2. No crushing on other people, 3. No acting like you like him when he is around, and 4. You explain to her that if she can't handle it, you'll explain it to HIM, and she DOESN 'T WANT THAT, because you WILL NOT BE NICE DURING THE EXPLANATION. 5. you follow through with the explanation, got it? No go be a MAN AND QUIT BEING A SNIVELING LITTLE BABY. Take charge of your woman and tell it like IT IS. If she doesn't get it, then kick her to the curb, AND YES I MEAN THAT (except the kicking part). No DO IT or forever be banished to pussyhood. -JOHN, a REAL MAN in a REAL state known as IOWA

Talk to someone quick. OMG!|`|BsK3u5p3aa	yeh the others already answered this but i'll put more detail in for ya... first of all be careful because if itz done right it CAN lead to sex... and also be choosy about who you let do it to you because there are some mean guys out there... some guys do it to see if you're tight or loose or if ur hygiene is good or bad... like ur scent and stuff... so take care of yourself becuz boys can be evil little pigs and talk about u... so be careful who u let do that becuz so many girls had boys put out bad rumors about them. fingering might seem like somethin so small (as well as a lot of other stuff) but theres always other things that go along with things that are BIG... so juss be careful with your body... treat ur body good and with RESPECT.

wovoZ5Z0aa	There is really no way to MAKE someone likely, but you can make it easy to be liked.  Most importantly, act as confident as you can.  Confidence is attractive in women too.  If you don't feel confident, fake it 'til you make it.  <br>  <br>  Talk to him.  Be interested in what he has to say and accepting, but stick to your own opinions too.  <br>  <br>  Dress to emphasize your best features, (but "hoochie-wear" is generally a no-no).  Don't worry about not looking good enough.  Most guys have fairly flexible standards when it comes to looks.  Looks ARE important, but as long as you're not WAY outside of normal, you have a chace.  <br>  <br>  Touch him casually from time to time.
iNzRRI70aa	well you could get to know her. that way you will be more comfortable when you are around her then you could start to giver her little hints that you like her like hold her books ore sit with her at lunch. but dont be clingy. just show her that you are there and then when you feel comfortable just go for it.you sound really nice though so i wouldnt worry to much ;)<br>  <3much love<br>  LuCkY|`|AA10162464	that is normal ,but if you don't try you will never get to know her.Calm down just be yourself don't try too hard to impress her,be open tell her if she want to go for a walk (sometimes they try to play hard to get in front of friends) with you and say that you really LIKE her (not love ) and you would love get to know her better.|`|N4oOt8Q2aa	Write her a song. That will steal her heart. If you can't sing though, why don't you ask her out like on a date, but don't call it a date. Just tell her you want to go out with her as "friends". She may start to get feelings for you after you guys have alone time. Hope this helped! Good Luck!|`|QPqRRXdKaa	yeah do that..hit her up on myspace.|`|rz7GfvPNaa	There no real solution for this just try get her on her own and tell her outright. it is scary as hell but what is the worst that can happen? she'll say no? then you have at least built up some confidence around her and will be able to be confident around other girls, people respond well to confidence just act it even if your not.|`|GqL8VD9aaa	By telling her straight up. I like guyz who do that, so I know exactly who likes me, and who is just my friend. Brave guyz are hot.

Play our free word games – BOGGLE and HANGMAN<br>  <br>  Do you remember – when you were a child – learning (then gleefully reciting) what you thought was the longest word in the English language? Was it ANTI-DIS-ESTABLISH-MENT-ARIAN-ISM? Or the similarly long SUPER-CALI-FRAGI-LISTIC-EXPI-ALI-DOCIOUS...<br>  There are longer ones...<br>  <br>  However, there is no easy answer that we can give when our visitors ask us for the longest word in the English language. Most very long words only occur in one or two dictionaries, and often they are debatably not words at all. For example, ANTI-DIS-ESTABLISH-MENT-ARIAN-ISM has possibly never really been used to mean "the belief which opposes removing the tie between church and state." Certainly 99 in 100 times it is used as an example of a long word. And who says you can't put NON– (for example) on the beginning to make it even longer?<br>  <br>  This problem is even more evident in chemical names. Most chemicals are named using a systematic naming system which methodically describes the molecule's structure. Some molecules, such as proteins, are huge, so it is possible to come up with genuine words containing millions of letters. But of course no chemist uses these really long names in practice.<br>  <br>  Here we look at some of the longest words in English dictionaries, and discuss whether they should be considered to be real words. Interesting long chemical terms and place names are listed separately afterwards. The red numbers indicate the length (number of letters) of the word that follows.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  <br>  Longest Words<br>  (45) PNEUMONO-ULTRA-MICRO-SCOPIC-SILICO-VOLCA... (also spelled PNEUMONO-ULTRA-MICRO-SCOPIC-SILICO-VOLCA... = a lung disease caused by breathing in particles of siliceous volcanic dust.<br>  This is the longest word in any English dictionary. However, it was coined by Everett Smith, the President of The National Puzzlers' League, in 1935 purely for the purpose of inventing a new "longest word". The Oxford English Dictionary described the word as factitious. Nevertheless it also appears in the Webster's, Random House, and Chambers dictionaries.<br>  (37) HEPATICO-CHOLANGIO-CHOLECYST-ENTERO-STOM... = a surgical creation of a connection between the gall bladder and a hepatic duct and between the intestine and the gall bladder.<br>  This is the longest word in Gould's Medical Dictionary.<br>  <br>  (34) SUPER-CALI-FRAGI-LISTIC-EXPI-ALI-DOCIOUS = song title from the Walt Disney movie Mary Poppins.<br>  It is in the Oxford English Dictionary.<br>  <br>  <br>  "But then one day I learned a word<br>  That saved me achin' nose,<br>  The biggest word you ever 'eard,<br>  And this is 'ow it goes:<br>  Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!"<br>  (30) HIPPOPOTO-MONSTRO-SESQUIPED-AL-IAN = pertaining to a very long word.<br>  From Mrs. Byrne's Dictionary of Unusual, Obscure and Preposterous Words.<br>  <br>  (29) FLOCCI-NAUCINI-HILIPIL-IFICATION = an estimation of something as worthless.<br>  This is the longest word in the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary. Interestingly the most common letter in English, E, does not appear in this word at all, whilst I occurs a total of nine times. The word dates back to 1741. The 1992 Guinness Book of World Records calls flocci-nauci-nihili-pilification the longest real word in the Oxford English Dictionary, and refers to pneumono-ultra-micro-scopic-silico-volca... as the longest made-up one.<br>  <br>  (28) ANTI-DIS-ESTABLISH-MENT-ARIAN-ISM = the belief which opposes removing the tie between church and state.<br>  Probably the most popular of the "longest words" in recent decades.<br>  <br>  (27) HONORI-FICABILI-TUDINI-TATIBUS = honorableness.<br>  The word first appeared in English in 1599, and in 1721 was listed by Bailey's Dictionary as the longest word in English. It was used by Shakespeare in Love's Labor's Lost (Costard; Act V, Scene I):<br>  <br>  <br>  "O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words.<br>  I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word;<br>  for thou art not so long by the head as<br>  honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier<br>  swallowed than a flap-dragon."<br>  Shakespeare does not use any other words over 17 letters in length.<br>  <br>  (27) ELECTRO-ENCEPHALO-GRAPHICALLY<br>  The longest unhyphenated word in Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed.), joint with ethylene-diamine-tetraacetate (see below).<br>  <br>  (27) ANTI-TRANSUB-STAN-TIA-TION-ALIST = one who doubts that consecrated bread and wine actually change into the body and blood of Christ.<br>  <br>  (21) DIS-PRO-PORTION-ABLE-NESS and (21) IN-COM-PREHEN-SIB-ILITIES<br>  These are described by the 1992 Guinness Book of World Records as the longest words in common usage.<br>  <br>  Some say SMILES is the longest word because there is a MILE between the first and last letters!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  <br>  Chemical Terms<br>  Two chemical terms (3,641 and 1,913 letters long) have appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records. They were wit
nlbJAtuZaa	i love it u seem really nice|`|2XTkSV4daa	I think you sound like a nice guy (all that about not reporting and stuff like that) and open to making friends online, but I'm not into the kind of music you listen to. I also see that you answered a question about a lady's chest...which is disgusting to me. All in all, I don't think I would be your friend but I'm sure you'll make lots of other friends. Does that make sense?|`|IyOVYQ0paa	It's very...nice. but this isn't really a dating site. or a college aplication site. I know, i'm not trying to be rude, I just want to give you an honest opinion. <br>  maybe you can tone down the "nice" stuff.|`|aSdUzlIiaa	don't put ur last name and don't put have a nice day or how nice u are <br>  <br>  sry not trying to be mean but its true?|`|UVW4yZsDaa	its nice (:<br>  <br>  nice ol' chap (;

If you're attractive and confident and charming, they'll probably be flattered that they're being talked to and keep on going...

Good Luck!<br>  M-J xxx|`|0vW88Uw9aa	Well you can get one of your friends to tell him, or tell one of his friends. If you keep flirting he won't know that you like him and he might think you're just a tease. What I would do is if you know anyone who has a class with him and sits next to him write in her notebook little notes about how you like him and then she'll open the book and he'll see it. It's a cute way. :)|`|zXpbfBcuaa	talk 2 him<br>  <br>  n wile he talkin chew ur lip, twirl ur hair, n gaze deeply in his eyes<br>  <br>  <br>  once a girl do dat 2 me i git dat message

ajgC0KPhaa	You point out his girlfriend because it's a key point in this situation, and you expect us to not say anything about him having a girlfriend? If he has a girlfriend and you have sex with him, you will BOTH be hated. You for seducing a taken guy, and him for cheating on his girlfriend.<br>  If he's in a relationship, he's most likely not going to consider doing it with you.

2QS8j9aOaa	The person who see's things outside the box usually is accurate, because she can see things that you obviously have ignored or choose to not see. Open your eyes and your heart too.|`|ebGjDZtMaa	i thnk he does because you said its been for a year<br>  thats a long crush if he's got one on you<br>  but when i had a crush on a guy somedays i didnt want to look at him either<br>  maybe he was jealous of another guy flirting with you and felt like hes been cheated on LOL maybe you should ask him|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	He sounds interested..are you? If so, start talking to him. He seems a little shy and needs you to initiate a conversation. Good luck!|`|7f91ea2Eaa	How much more obvious do you want. He is shy so maybe you could try breaking the ice
OCMSTxYfaa	shouldn't, sounds like he needs to learn how to take a joke|`|uAzBvk5gaa	i'm pretty sure he's fine with it. Nothing to worry about.|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	i think that if you have a good healthy relationship then he would probably jsut laugh it off<br>  (i think it's funny)<br>  BUT if you have control issues or other issues in the relationship prior to saying this, it might confirm in his head that you are controlling|`|vRvXvnRZaa	My kids use that term all the time, to my boys it's just another word but I never really understood it, I still, however do not like it.|`|Ysnbesz4aa	you shoulda said, "No bitches I would rape both of you." thats the proper terminology for gamers.|`|we2Csi51aa	noo it was just a joke.<br>  and wow his name is ali lol like alexandra.:) hehehe|`|Q0Ky6DeLaa	If they laughed too, they probably didn't think anything of it. If he starts acting weird/angry/upset ask him if what you said hurt him, and apologize and say you didn't mean anything by it. If he doesn't get better, talk to John and see if Ali said anything to him about it. Good luck!|`|mDRgyLdiaa	no. i would say that to my boyfriend. then again, i say a lot of things to him...ahaha.<br>  but no nothing should've been wrong. it was a joke and nothing sounded wrong with it. that's a good joke to haha i would use it (;<br>  but if he seems mad about it, then hes just ridiculous.|`|ZzcGlrtCaa	If he got all P/O at you for saying that, it was his lack of maturity and sense of humor. He might hold a grudge for a day or so but he should get over it.<br>   I personally thought it was funny. Good comment and reaction time on your part.|`|IJ2QhfKEaa	yeah, i see what your saying. that came out abit wrong hey. nah he probly didnt think much of it. remember, boys are pretty simple, they dont remember or care about much. makes it easier for us girls to get away with the stupid things we say and do sometimes.|`|IyOVYQ0paa	I don't think so. It was just a joke, but you can call him and make sure that he knows. Don't let it bother you too much. =)|`|GipcAbHpaa	In A way he might think you do play halo and he might challenge you lol and then "own Him" lol.|`|6kAtYLAdaa	it was a joke dont sweat it unless he starts acting stand offish and then just be like sorry dude|`|AA10410277	say you was just kidding.|`|5RkHsul3aa	there's no reason for him to be mad... i would have taken it as a joke if my bf (if i had one) would have said somethin like tht...|`|bVr6wvcWaa	you probably mad your bf feel like he's your dog or something just apologize and he'll get over it :)|`|ewUCa9WAaa	i think it will be fine. anyone who would get mad about that is pretty ridiculous.|`|YzDLOHjPaa	lol! I would have laughed! Maybe they need to lighten up! Keep doing what your doing! Just be yourself!|`|nQzvPcREaa	it doesnt sound like a big deal to me it was a joke..|`|PLsJpPqOaa	i don't really know i guess it just depends on your personalities... :)|`|5vFJSDdPaa	no|`|AA10238397	no i think u just tried to make some fun between those guys, u did the best :)
def913262af3ad74da15c66c2614ad09aa	it sounds like to me like he has some sort of issue.<br>  <br>  i dont know what but it's not right for someone to get so angry when you tease them. or for them to talk about you behind your back.<br>  <br>  my friends roommate is like this and i can't stand him. i called him "the grumpy one" one time and he started yelling and slammed a door in my face. and then when i left he told me friend not to hang out with me anymore.<br>  <br>  don't hang out with people like that. it's not fun! you'll always have to tiptoe around every conversation to make sure that you dont hurt his Delicate feelings
vmMaWOFvaa	well i think you should comfront him about this ask him why he gets mad when you make fun of him when he makes fun of you just say ya know what happened i thought we were friends and we always used to make fun of eachother. just try to talk to him try to get everything out so you guys can start fresh. but maybe he thought that was a date and if he is he is being really sensitive. thats ok. i hope everything turns out to be ok.
c282b658121c083eb61a50380f3c922daa	Wait till you reach 18 then.  If you will still like her by then, you will have every right to drive to their house.|`|ZLEeVhEPaa	"Allowed driving range?"  Are you on parole?
CDpwCvmLaa	Text him whenever you feel like it.<br>  He wouldn't have given you his number if he didn't like you! Maybe he assumed it was okay not to text back, because you've spoken to him since. <br>  <br>  If you get the feeling he's not interested, just ask him about it. Being honest is always better and more respectful than playing games with him. <br>  <br>  Luck! :]|`|BDK6PTXFaa	tell him he want to engage in textsex with him. its like phone sex but via texting. on the online world, this is called a "one text stand" if you guys recently met<br>  <br>  100% pregnancy/std preventable!
HMzUeqTmaa	If  a guy near you is talking to you watch his body language. Eyes toward you, feet pointed toward you, and he leans in when he talks. Thats pretty much this simple stuff. Can you answer my latest please?|`|v2K249U8aa	Not sure, probably or he knows you like him and is teasing him.
VtTU4KcNaa	First dates are for first impressions.  Second dates are for making sure the first impressions were right.  And third dates are for people who like each other.|`|wmBK9uASaa	I think you can be sure she does after a 3rd date.....|`|FKN9kBvLaa	She likes you if she accepts a second one|`|0nW8wMBdaa	Doesn't mean diddly squat. She's interested in you and wants to find out more. If she's easy then yes, choosy then no.
6NokYZ2Xaa	that's a really tricky situation hunny. <br>  <br>  i'd go with your gut feeling, that's the only way to go.|`|EjhBMKX8aa	he is hiding stuff read the red flags....|`|p77l62cHaa	well since meredith is his bestie you shouldnt be worried about them dating on the down low or anything ITS A MATTER OF TRUST|`|PLsJpPqOaa	i think he's hiding something from you, it sounds really suspicious.|`|T5EOJrVZaa	yea sounds a little weird....cuz hes deleting them and not being truthful...oh and just so  you know a senior can invite anyone to prom...well at least in my high school we could...|`|we2Csi51aa	i dont knoww! confusing...check other stuff of his.|`|z8ecdbX2aa	You may consider learning to be the jealous typee.

f34hHeUEaa	Maybe its just time for you guys to move on. Friendships don't always last forever, I'm sad to say. But as long as you have Allie and you family behind you, I think you'll be good :) This happened to me a few years ago, thought we'd be BFF'S but turned out not to be. She back stabbed me and spread rumors about me. So at least it isn't as bad as that.Or is it?<br>  Good luck!
5uzHW4CYaa	Go out of your way to get him to notice you, when he does, be really confident, guys like that. Don't be some broken mess that they feel like they need to fix. Have fun around him. Let him know you don't need him but you might want him. Be strong and flirty. Compliment what he's wearing, when he catches you looking at him, smile.|`|BR2XgFPFaa	Make him know your there and you like him, <br>  go up to him and just start a small convo. <br>  or...<br>  you could always add him on myspace and talk, <br>  or write him a not if you go to the same school, <br>  but i would go with the convo in person is always better<br>  it works you might be shy, but if you really like him you will do whatever to get him to notice you, <br>  hope this helped (:|`|ILxQYrrPaa	then make your self exist like wear nice hot clothes fix your hair and just look nice and also just start talking <br>  like with me i don't care if i dont know the person i just talk and then we became friends like theres this boy i like and i dont know if he likes me but we never talked because he was new but then one day i went upstairs to class but nobody there yet and i saw him with his two friends that are my friends to and i started making them laugh and now everyday we always talk|`|nNvpBX81aa	U should try to get his attention. ist u should change ur style try to find out what his taste r. 2nd if u both go to the same school then u should bump into him and try to start a conv. if that doesnt work try to befriend him.|`|AA12091265	talk to him...a simple text with start that|`|qnmI1bmkaa	then talk to him...?

Cause you dont like him!<br>  Same thing happened to me! Every guy was singing the song<br>  to me!|`|uff3kOoFaa	maybe he just liked the songs......|`|MIR3eC5kaa	idk
xX7EnZsdaa	If you knew he liked you or however he feels then to say that WAS heartless... Maybe when you said it you should have explained why.<br>  <br>  And not just guys do that a lot of girls do this as well so don't be sexist.
ZDasr4uUaa	yea he liked you but u probly broke his heart<br>  and thats why he made u listen to tht song.<br>  "how could you be so heartless?"|`|908b0790cd51aa2d22433510f21b1e39aa	Wow.|`|50AljhbMaa	Tell him what happened if u like him he will understand tell him u onlyu liked ian cause he reminded you of him! he seems like a sesitive kind guy he will understand<br>  <br>  Hope i could help|`|Azu5CjYUaa	yes he did like you and you broke his heart. i hope you still have a chance|`|a4qzfDq2aa	he liked you...<br>  but u broke hes heart
deoT7QD8aa	you should start by saying so how was ur day or so what are you going to do fro the rest of the day u know little small talk to get things started|`|9jddst2gaa	ask him about the movie or how his day wen ttalk about school your friends his friends pretty much anything that you would talk to him about if he were with you in person|`|c4qZRoQgaa	talk about movies. <br>  lol<br>  or school, or whatever! <br>  just start with small talk! lol<br>  good luck! [=|`|mVNMgaQBaa	ask what movie hes watching|`|kB7UsIXdaa	"so whats the movie about"<br>  (he tells you)<br>  "oh it sounds really good. we should watch it sometime!"|`|zXpbfBcuaa	say "wats up" lolz<br>  <br>  n just chill
oB3pYs20aa	I would say mostly on msn, belive me on facebook u know he has other friends/girl friends to talk to and he might not mean wat he is saying to u.if you r just chatting its not really a real conversation its just a quick "yeah your cute" talk to u later on msn its better because its just your email and no one to interrupt your conversation and he actually means what he is saying so my answer would be msn and he wants a relationship with u i hope i helped bye girl!
uec7RIhbaa	sure, there's no reason why he doesn't love you.  maybe he just doesn't beliebve in the institute of marriage - alot of people don't!  i was one of them until i got with an army guy and realised without a ring on my finger they wouldn't actually acknowledge my existence!  but he may be warning you - no matter how far you go with this guy he doesn't want to get married.  do you?  is this a deal breaker?  once you move in with him or possibly have kids thats as far as it can go - there will never be a wedding.  is that ok with you??  if it is then it doesn't matter, keep going and see how the relationship pans out.  however if you  know you want to get married one day then i'm afraid this guy either has to agree to marry you or its over.  good luck|`|WFFXHFfVaa	Alot of people dont believe in marriage, to some its just a piece of paper and they dont think it will make any difference to the relationship what so ever, dosent mean he dosent like or even love you.
kiJUCYMcaa	they open up, umm they talk a good amount|`|DLvHWOo7aa	Don't be a total douche.|`|EPfNPWmmaa	Not caring about how other people view you, without being cocky, and not letting things get to you. Although i have to say i think kindness and how sweet the guy is is far more important than confidence|`|U3gebnDLaa	well, for one, TALK TO HER. DON''T IGNORE HER and act weird around her. be FUN. But, don't over do it. ********* is the other extreme.|`|J30Gh5O6aa	Like by hugging the girl when you see her and just being funny and cute and confident haha idk.|`|jB6xN1Kiaa	put ur hands on ur hips or stick ur chest out|`|vJr9etaZaa	Well some actions can be like being very polite and always look concerned and neat. Girls like it when you flirt with them so do your best. Give hugs and care for her. Words that you can use are flirt phrases.. Example: "I hope you know CPR, because you take my breath away" or "Apart from being sexy, what do you do for a living?".. Things like that can get you where you want to be.<br>  Good Luck! Tell me how it goes.|`|g59exVBdaa	Start a conversation with a girl about something you have in common. Don't try to show off it will just make you look arrogant. Just be your self and go up to a girl. this will show her that you have confidence in your self. <br>  <br>  Good Luck getting the girl! =)|`|96ILMzzBaa	well i mean i like when a guys confident, but not too confident. its annoying.. like my boyfriend whenever i say your so right or sweet he'll be like i know.. its annoying. just when someone says something be like thanks instead of oh not really.. or say yeah im good at that|`|aa9jQ9XFaa	make sure to look the girl you like straight in the eye even if she looks away, have good posture dont hunch over, and most important be confident enough to ask her because she is probably too shy to ask you|`|rlkWrJlGaa	I hate it when guys refuse to look me in the eye. It shows a lack of confidence and is completely not sexy.
XYw16m2Yaa	You should stop in the hall way or wherever you are, and just start a conversation, like... i like your shoes, or, ask her about an assigment in math you dont understand. Just kinda go with the flow, and talk to her. <br>  <br>  If you want to take it to the next level, try flirting with her. Look in her eyes and actually say something serious or nice about her. <br>  <br>  oorrr, if you want to take it to an even higher level, ask her if she wants to go to a party with you, or hang out sometime afterschool. <br>  <br>  If all comes to fail, and she ends up not being interested in you, dont give up. There are many other fish in the sea. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.  :]
Xrf0tK5baa	Someone told me once that you will never forget your first love and deep down you will always have a connection to them. I know this to be true. I dated mine for 3 years and was completely in love with him..I honestly would have done anything for him....now we are broken up but whenever I am with other guys all I think about is him...it sucks..but I try and remember why we broke up and what kind of person he really was...I push the positive memories away otherwise I start missing him.<br>  <br>  You have to learn to distract yourself with things that matter to you...get your life and dreams in order and remember you dont need him..all you need is you.<br>  <br>  Deep down you will always love your first...even when your married 30 years from now...you'll wonder what hes doing and where hes at.

Stop being so depressing and get a life.|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	No, it stays with you. But you can move on. Everyone has a first love after all. If you loved someone you will always love them a little.|`|zfKzLFgxaa	it depends on why he dumped you. and of course you can get over your first love, i mean.. how old are you? if you're young, you couldn't have thought that you were gonna b with him forever, you'll find someone else. in the meantime, try not to see him or talk to him at all and have fun with other people, that will help you keep him off your mind and you'll eventually forget about him completely :)|`|U3gebnDLaa	ha join the club.! you gotta move on with your life. i'm assuming you haven't met someone new.thts the key. once you get someone who sparks your interest your old love will be a series of memories.|`|T272vObnaa	Yes.  Well, not literally.  I still remember him and that I did love him, I just don't have any feelings for him anymore.|`|L8P9a3Dmaa	no but you can recover from time to time
xpAk4yVqaa	Okay since I understand you now.<br>  <br>  I don't think you did anything wrong. You are just really flirty, and the guys feel more confident to approach you than the other girls because you actually responded with a maybe.<br>  <br>  Ya you are definitely labeled girl they think is easy, but none of them have hit it yet. So most likely some guy is saying he got something from you, and all the guys are wanting a piece since they think you "put out". <br>  <br>  Don't worry though. You get some good practice out of playing mind games with these guys, and learning to be confident with yourself. This is great for your ego, but some girls tend to start having sex with guys just to gain popularity, and they usually do become popular because they "put out". <br>  <br>  You have nothing to be ashamed of just wear condoms when you are ready, and choose wisely. Trust me there are gonna be dumb *** guys who will tell their friends about you and make you feel bad. But don't be.<br>  <br>  Sex is natural, and its not just for guys to have multiple partners. So try and choose guys you can trust that don't got a big mouth. <br>  <br>  Easiest way to find out if a guy is a gossip, is to see if he talks jokingly, or badly about any of his friends or other girls. Have fun, you are a huge flirt these guys are trying to get up under your panties, and its driving them crazy. <br>  <br>  Maybe they even got a bet going?|`|jGKGlxAuaa	Most guys, especially young ones in 8th grade, cannot recognize sarcasm. Remember most guys IQ number is approx the same as their penis length.|`|AA10529674	Don't even give them the benefit of the doubt.

I think u should b mor classy about it. and b serious when these questions are ask. Cuz guys think if ur being sarcastic about it then they think ur liking it too. Next time dnt joke about it.<br>   or just ignore them and dont agree to sayn u will when ur not. Dont do that|`|MwAjGWSgaa	oh its probably because you all are only in the 8th grade. the same thing used to happen to me back then... immature ways are probably to blame. this may just be a phase... it's probably something that they [the guys] think is funny, and then the fact that you're being sarcastic right along with them may only worsen the situation.... this may all just be fun and games.

CFS. When I do, I make myself go over there even if I have to drag my sorry a$s across the doorway. I know I will feel better if I do. She is very understanding. Today, it has been very bad, but I am going over there after she gets off work. Point being, if he really loved you he would do the same. But be patient. But sometimes you can let this s**t get you down... you just can't. I'm grateful that she puts up with me, but I would understand if she moved on... don't know why she doesn't. But that's love. Maybe what you have isn't love.|`|sxJgu3C9aa	When YOU love someone...you're not alone, mainly when this LOVE is shared.<br>  <br>  Love is about being with the ONE you love, for better and worse, so...understand him, he has a more difficult period, be with him, help him pass through this illness.|`|kWKZoQogaa	If you really love him, then you have to be patient with him.|`|7vcoonkuaa	This is a joke.|`|9kMJJ1giaa	Seriously, if this is a real life situation, I think this guy really took you.  Sorry!  If he truly loved you and was sick, he would attempt to, at the very least meet you half way, in any plans that were made and then canceled  by him, due to his illness.  He would not always make plans with you then not carry through with anything.  Come on, unless he is on his death bed, there really is no other excuse.  He is playing you!  If he loved you he would feel bad in his always disappointing you.  But he does not feel bad, in fact you say, he will not even let you try to talk to him about how this makes you feel.  He tries to make you feel guilty about his illness, by saying you can not handle his illness.<br>   <br>  This is bull, my friend!  He wants you when HE wants you.  When he don't, he is too ill to see you, or to do anything with you.  You are a game to him.  You have already been too patient with this user.  Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is an illness, but I doubt it puts you on your death bed.  He is using his illness, and your compassion. <br>   <br>  I hope you can easily pick up the pieces in your life and move on, or back to your home.  Tell him people who are dieing from horrible diseases, seem to have more energy,ambition and dedication to a commitment than he does. <br>  <br>  Please do not fall for anymore of this guys crap!  Don't allow him to make you feel bad about his illness, and you not being able to handle it.  Chronic Fatigue Syndrome does not make you so sick and tired that you can not spend time with someone you love, or only be able to see that person for a couple of hours a week.<br>  <br>  I think he has Chronic BULLCRAP Syndrome!  And I do NOT think he LOVES you or would MARRY you. He might make the wedding plans, but I'd bet he would be too sick or tired to make it to the altar!<br>  <br>  Just CANCEL HIM!!!!<br>  <br>  Moving in together will not help!  I'll bet the time is never right for him anyways.  Do yourself a big favor and don't waste anymore of your compassionate good self on him.|`|sJClbSHGaa	This is a very hard challenge you are facing. You moved away from everything you knew, and now you're in this new place and the person you love can't even be around because of his illness. Maybe you guys should plan small dates at home like renting movies so he wouldn't be forced to go somewhere if he's not feeling well? Also, you should really talk to him, and tell him not to interupt you until you're finished stating your feelings, then ask him how he feels about it without interrupting.|`|qMsWcfNXaa	u can be patient with him but some people can be in a relationship where theyre there because they care for this person and feel like if i leave him then something bad might happen. I think u can b patient but there will only b a matter of time that ur gonna get tired of being patient and leave. I think he should atleast giv it a try to go threw with these plans he has with u. and next time try not to bak out. but i think u should just remain friends|`|Cpmfx6L9aa	If he working on bettering himself then you should stay. And if he trying 100% then you should stay. It takes a lot to deal with someone with an illness so you have to find a happy medium. If you can't find it and he's not meeting you half way...keep it moving before too many feelings are involved. Good luck.|`|n1MZefbqaa	They say that love can overcome anything.  I cannot actually assert for I have never been in love but when that time actually happens I would want the love of my life to be there in the good and bad times.|`|uKuRTh9iaa	i think you should be patient for a little bit more and you dont see no progress thats a sign is not ment to be to move on.|`|lTx67Mu8aa	try stepping in his shoes or have him in your shoes.theese relationships are hard try for about 2 more weeks see if it improves. if not lay it to him flat|`|AA10087769	Are you certain he has Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?  Its very hard to diagnose--lots of other things can mimic the symptoms.  I was told maybe I had it, but later found out my thyroid was barely functioning (which led to the aches and pains, extreme fatigue, etc.).<br>  <br>  And, not to be mean, but do you go to his home and visit with him?  Or, is he just stopping by to see you?  You may want to make sure that he is on the up and up (no girlfriend or wife, etc.) and find out exactly where he sees the relationship going.  Maybe he has changed his mind about wanting the relationship and is having some doubts now.  At any rate, when he says you can't handle his illness--well, did you do some research and make sure you were aware of what all his illness entailed?  And, if he really is so tired that he is unable to spare more than 1 or 2 hours a week for you, then you either make the effort to get out and meet some people on your own or decide if you want to stay there and stay in the relationship with the limitations.|`|tXdb3X4Kaa	It'd probably break his heart to know that you left him for something he can't help.<br>  If his illness is really getting to you, you should suggest him a doctor/medicine. If he already has or has had those two things, then you should either make deal with what he has and love him, or just give him up. (those are truly your only two options)<br>  Would you be better off in the long run having given him up or sticking by his side? Which would you feel better about?<br>  How much do you love this man? If you REALLY, truly love him in return, I'd think you'd probably stick with him forever.<br>  <br>  If you honestly consider leaving him, then rethink about how much you'd really give for this man.<br>  True love takes patience - if you would care not to ever let him go, then don't.<br>  If he's not worth your time, what is he really worth to you? (Do not take this question sarcastically or rudely; it's an honest question, honest answer.)<br>  Think about those things and you can probably decide what is best for yourself.|`|KlRsBt5waa	Have you done any research yourself on this illness? Unfortunately for the both of you, part of being in this relationship is spending quality time together. It's easy to have a relationship over the internet because not a lot of energy is needed. But when you're face to face, it's a different story. I don't know much about Chronic Fatigue Syndrome but there has to be a way for people to deal with this and have a life too. Get educated about this to see so that you can make a proper decision on whether you can deal with this or not. <br>  <br>  Also, did your bf tell you about his daily challenges with CFS like how much energy he has and how this has affected his other relationships? if he has, then you have to look at whether you can really deal with this diagnosis. If he hasn't, then he misled you into believing something that was false. Either way, look into it yourself so that you know what your dealing with and if there are any strategies that can help you cope.
otTMXJvRaa	Hi Kaitlyn,<br>  <br>  Can I assume that you're about 13 and in Junior High School? You sound like a nice young lady.  I’m sorry that you’re confused and heart broken over Jacob, but it won’t be very long and you’ll be feeling better.<br>  <br>  If what your BFF said is true… and the fact that Jacob hasn’t spoken to you since…  then Jacob has decided that he’s not interested in you.  That’s not a crime.  No doubt there are boys in your school that you are not interested in, correct?<br>  <br>  Now, for something completely different.  Let's assume for a moment that Jacob instead decided that he was interested in you... what would you have done in that case? That's something you need to start thinking about... especially because you're probably a bit sheltered and vulnerable (which is just fine).<br>  <br>  OK, since you seem to be an innocent and sweet young lady, here's a general crash course all about guys, BF's, crushes, dating, love, etc. for you to think about while nurturing your broken heart.<br>  <br>  Kaitlyn... crushes, dating, and love can be confusing... extremely confusing... for adults as well as young people. That's why it is a good idea not to start dating too early.<br>  <br>  It would be advisable for you to not start seriously dating until you are about 16 or 17.   Your parents should also say OK and meet the boy first.  <br>  <br>  And stay a virgin (i.e., no premarital sex) until you get married. That way, your life will have much less drama and heartache. You'll find out pretty quickly if the guys you date just want to get into your pants… or if they truly do respect you, your body, your heart, your soul, your feelings, your values… and your family.  <br>  <br>  In Junior High and High School, young guys and young girls can be pretty unpredictable, and change their minds very quickly... for no reason whatsoever. That can lead to hurt feelings and heartache. You and some guy might both agree that you like each other one day, and literally the next day either one of you could call it quits.<br>  <br>  Kaitlyn, don't assume that you will marry your first crush or your first serious BF... it won't happen. The odds are literally 100-to-1 against it. Sorry!<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the purpose of dating is generally to determine if a person will make a potentially good future spouse. Therefore, don't ever date someone that you know would not be good for you in the long term.<br>  <br>  As a decent and trusting young lady, you will need to be aware of a few of the potential hazards of dating. These hazards certainly apply to young people as well as adults. That's also why you need to not start kissing or making out too early with guys (even though you might want to).<br>  <br>  Kaitlyn, here are two major dating hazards for you to consider:<br>  <br>  1. There are some guys out there (the smooth players) who will tell a nice girl that he loves her, just to see how far she will let him go with her body. There are guys out there who are ready and willing to use you and your body for their own selfish pleasure... and then leave... breaking your heart in the process, and possibly leaving you pregnant... or with an STD (a nasty disease in your private parts). Hopefully, you will be old enough and mature enough when dating to recognize these losers, and say "No". <br>  <br>  2. You could meet a genuinely nice and decent guy, and you both really do think that you love each other. After a few weeks or months, you both might be tempted to take off your clothes together. That would be a good way to mess up both of your young lives. It's happened to a lot of nice girls and decent guys out there. Hopefully, you will be old enough and mature enough to resist this type of temptation... and the temptation can be very strong.<br>  <br>  Kaitlyn, the best way to avoid getting into trouble from either hazard listed above is for you to never be alone with your guy... anywhere. Not his house, not your house, not a friend's house, not behind the school, or anywhere else. A responsible (and awake) adult should always be nearby.<br>  <br>  You should also never attend a party where no adults are present... ever. Nor any parties with drugs or alcohol.<br>  <br>  Ideally, before you start dating, you need to make a conscious decision to remain a virgin until you are happily married. Having sex too early will make you feel sad, cheap, and make it less special (same thing with kissing in case you do it too early with the wrong boy... but kissing is much less dangerous).<br>  <br>  OK, why no premarital sex? <br>  <br>  Because having sex without marriage is going outside of the laws of man and God that civilizations on this planet have lived by for thousands of years.<br>  <br>  Because there's the unnecessary risk of excessive heartache (any break-up will cause heartache... virgin or not... but heartache will be less if you are still a virgin... that's just the way human brains are wired).<br>  <br>  Because there's also the genuine danger of an unwanted Baby... or an STD.<br>  <br>  Because your parents would very likely be extremely disappointed.<br>  <br>  Because your "no sex" rule will pretty much eliminate the players, the losers, the creeps, the clods, and the selfish manipulators. <br>  <br>  Just take a look at a random selection of the questions from girls in this category... a significant number of problems here directly involve premarital sex... coupled with immaturity, foolish expectations, and invalid assumptions.<br>  <br>  Long term, you need to find a special guy who will be honorable and be very good to you as you grow into a decent young woman. He may not be the hottest-looking guy around, but you will love him just the way he is. He should be a guy who is proud to take you home to meet his parents and his family. A guy that you would be pleased to take home to be introduced to your parents and family. A guy who will ask for your hand in marriage. A guy who is willing to stand together with you in a wedding ceremony before both of your families in church.<br>  <br>  Kaitlyn, you don't want a guy who is not honorable and just wants your body... for a while... and then he would be gone. A problem like that is much more likely to happen if you start dating too early, and have trouble recognizing good decent guys versus hot-and-attractive creeps with smooth lines.<br>  <br>  And don't ever try to date older guys who won't hesitate to ask you out. They won't hesitate to try to get your clothes off, either. <br>  <br>  Keep yourself out of trouble by thinking smart. Don't believe everything a guy tells you... watch him carefully, and evaluate whether or not his words are consistent with his actions. See if he respects you and your values.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid or embarrassed to talk to your parents or your family about dating and boy issues as you are growing up. They know you, love you, and will certainly give you good advice.<br>  <br>  When you're older, and you look back over your life... you'll be happy that you made the right decisions about finding, dating, and evaluating guys when you were young.<br>  <br>  That's pretty much the big picture for you to look at, Kaitlyn.<br>  <br>  Someday, you'll make a lucky guy a fine wife.<br>  <br>  Take care, and God bless.<br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  - Charlie<br>  <br>  P.S. - If you are looking to have a good Junior High and High School experience... including the BF part... then it would be a good idea for you to join sports teams at school. There will be less free time for you to dwell on BF and crush issues. Plus, you'll be in good shape, and you'll look cute in the competitive outfits at the games. Guys are absolutely fascinated by female athletes, and love seeing them in shorts and t-shirts... with minimal make-up... and they won't care if you are sweaty and your hair is a bit messed up. No kidding. You'll have more boys looking at you than you ever thought was possible. And your wardrobe costs??? Essentially zero! In addition, your Coach will be around to keep an eye on you and give good advice if you need it. <br>  <br>  Finally, you'll develop more self esteem, confidence, self control, better judgment, and you'll be much less likely to get into trouble. You'll be stronger mentally, and any BF relationships that develop will be more stable. Guaranteed 100%.
RZKygoPzaa	What makes you think he doesn't like his current girlfriend?  He is with her now and from what you have said, takes her to with him apparently, you have even noticed that.<br>  <br>  All you can do is be yourself, if he responds then he is interested in you, if he does not, then the answer is obvious.<br>  <br>  Be nice and conversational with him, but if it becomes apparent after several attempts on your part to encourage him, then you will have to walk away from this.  He has a mind of his own and the right to choose who he wants to spend his time with.<br>  <br>  Have you ever talked to him when his current girlfriend is not with him? Is that possible to do?  If so have a list of things you might say to him so you will not be tongued tied and nervous.  Like a script from a movie.  Stick to the script and know when to terminate the conversation so it doesn not become too long.  Boys have a short attentin span when placed in unexpected situations that might make them nervous.  You will know when its time to stop.  <br>  <br>  If you think his girlfriend is controlling the situation, that may be.  Maybe he is uncertain and does not want to make her mad at him.  Maybe he doesn't talk to any girls when she is around.  Have you noticed if he does or not?  <br>  <br>  The bottom line is, if he likes you, he will still find a way to talk to you, whether you make it known that you like him or not. The male of the species is the pursuer.  You have dropped hints that you are interesed no doubt.  Let's see if he responds.  sometimes just be part of the group, smile at him but don't say anythng.  See if he addresses you, he might.  He will be aware of your presence as you have spoken to him several times before.  It is not necessary to take the verbal initive every time.  Don't make him nervous so he runs from you.  If he doesn not respond to you after a while, there will be someone who will down the road.  If someone turns up but you are not interested in them, just remember how you feel now about the guy you have feelings for and are not getting the response you desire.

B0y9aO1Laa	I don't have a sure answer for this but i have some theories.<br>  <br>  When girls have a boyfriend they always have their guards up with every guy they don't know that approachest them for anything.<br>  <br>  Some girls may be nice but others will just tare you apart for no apparent reason because their simply conceited b*****s that think every guy is trying to get at them.<br>  <br>  Just don't let their cruelty affect you.  Stop giving them your attention at work and if they ever ask you for a favor of something tell them you can't and walk away.|`|Uk3MpEyuaa	because it subconsciously makes us feel important.we're so obsessed with finding someone who is so in your face that we never notice when people are being nice so we take them for granted.sorry i dont mean to insult women,i kinda have the opposite thing,im always way too nice to everyone and then people dont like me.we also like the thrill of being with someone who is like a puzzel.<br>  by the way this is not true about all women so dont get me wrong|`|4SrrCwhiaa	not only women
H8Zr6RDYaa	I think that you need to wait and see if he responds and what he might say to you when he does.  There is still no excuse for him not talking to you for weeks at a time, even if he is sick he could at least text you. If he writes you back he might actually be worth acknowledging and trying to work something out.|`|MWjNp6y3aa	Well...If you want someone to communicate properly then maybe try using real sentences and punctuation and such.

tK7XacH7aa	How strong is your friendship? She probably doesn't want to hurt that. Just keep flirting with her, don't just be nice, actually flirt with her and strike up some type of conversation. Eventually she should want to turn it into a relationship.<br>  Are you sure she likes you though? If this is a weak friendship then she probably means it.

Don't go completely out of the way if this is the first time because she may catch this as being awkward. If she's ever alone, that's a great time to just say hi and say who you are and ask for her name then just strike up a conversation about something. Whatever is going on in school, classes, etc.

PK5Elowdaa	First understand that guys hide a lot of their true feelings inside. I personally do it myself sometimes. My guess is that he feels you're not reading him well enough. Im sure he really wants you back but maybe you weren't showing enough concern for him wanting you back.This triggers him to becoming frustrating. Guys expect girls to catch on to our signals. <br>  <br>  As far as him being around his friends and acting differently, this is because guys really don't like their friends seeing them "whipped" or falling for someone. Its a cover up. You've experienced this already. You mentioned his behavior changed when you two are alone. The ANSWER?? His true feelings is the feelings he express to you when you guys are alone. Almost all guys do it. His true feelings is NOT the way he express it when he's with his friends. I all honesty I can read this guy. He really wants you back. Bad. But don't torture the guy. Let him know your decision. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hopes this help<br>  -The Guy Expert|`|AA10199949	Most guy's break up with you around special events.. sometimes they think a gift is needed and all you need is his time.|`|xwNgEhKCaa	its becuz you havent answered|`|5qwtCcKraa	he just didnt want to get you something|`|7jCO1sE7aa	it's probably because you're fat|`|P9oduCUgaa	thats cold babe.|`|FyhzmgRUaa	The day is not over, wait and see if anything happens.

And I have personally witnessed a parent who thought it was so cute when her daughter at the tender age of 13 had her first boyfriend, her eyes just lit up like the 4th of July when her little girl was holding hands with her boyfriend,  I intervened and spoke with the young girls mom about all the consequences that can happen with a kid who is to young for a boyfriend, and she claimed that this would not happen to her daughter, and that her daughter was supervised around the clock, well 9 1/2 months later her eyes were full of tears, as her young girl was about to give birth to a baby that was going to be put up for adoption. This mother had no ill intentions towards her daughter, however she was quite naive in thinking that somehow some way her daughter was different then the rest of the population of young girls. Bottom line is, 9-12-15 is simply to young.|`|0vW88Uw9aa	no|`|OX5IqYndaa	no way<br>  for there safety no|`|zXpbfBcuaa	HECK NAH<br>  <br>  around 14 or 15 is ok tho lolz
ZoeS825Kaa	Well you've completed the first part of getting a girl and that's finding the nuts to do it. Second you have to go to her table, ask to sit and introduce yourself to both her and her friend.  Incorporating her friend into any conversation that may arise will increase her comfort with your presence and vice versa (less threatning).  Don't ask her out then.  Make a couple more of these rounds, make sure to acknowledge her everytime you see her.  Once you two have established a comfort level with each other, add a bit of flirtation into it.  With any sign of her flirting back,you must jump in immediately with a serious proposition that involves you two going somewhere outside of school together.  If she has gone this far, then you're probably good to take it as far as you want. Especially considering that you said she was usually shy. That's all it takes, just remember to be confident, not cocky, and always convince yourself that your goal is going to be a sure success.  Alright, now go out there and get some of that ***!!|`|EyaqiWPwaa	wait for her to make you a sandwich...oh and you dont want girl you want hot ....sandwich|`|uJSys2xGaa	.....you have never talked to her..so how can u ask her out if you don't even know her?? dont ask her out without ever talking to her...she will DEF say no. sounds cliche but talk to her and get to know her first..for all u know she aint ur type...just cuz ur both quiet dont mean ur the perfect match..
509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	talk to him.  you didn't know he liked her either.  just play fair.|`|qW4GDpHsaa	i think you should as her who she likes before you ask her out. <br>  <br>  elizabeth|`|suoY5vxbaa	Haha! Bros before hoes.. Nice one! Lolz. I would ask her out before he does.. haha. Good luck!|`|osZ5zVEDaa	Ok I am a firm believer in Bros Before Hoes except in the very small minority. The key is talk to your Best Friend and let him know of your intentions. Then you two decide who gets first crack at trying to Date her. You can try and see who is more interested, but if you two both feel passionate about it then I would flip a coin or paper, rock, scissors. You get the idea. <br>  <br>  First remember that the friendship is more important then the girl. There are other girls, but a true Friend is hard to come by. If it becomes such huge deal then let him have her. Also just because one of you calls Dibs does not mean the Girl will like the one who called Dibs more than the other. If she goes after the other Bro then you need to talk about it first to clear the air.<br>  <br>  I almost lost my Best Friend over just this issue. I had Dibs and he was down with that and then she went to him to tell him she liked him. They started dating and THEN asked me if it was okay. By that time I felt burned. The are now Married and happy so I am okay with it. Before they became seriouse things were pretty rocky between us. Be respectful of your Bro and ask him to do the same.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|PK5Elowdaa	Considering you're both into the same chick and she's not taken. You  have the advantage knowing he's trying to get her too. This means you need to make your move and do so quick. This is not Bros before Hoes, this is an example of Go Bro, before you lose that hoe! With that said,good luck. <br>  <br>  My advice to you, ask her out on a date and do it quick. Once he knows you two went out, he'll most likely back off.
hhRuKIzRaa	guys always want sex...sex and love have nothing to do with each other...however, sex with love is priceless! <br>  <br>  only you will know which one you are willing to wait on,but he doesn't care which comes first...|`|jfwmelYgaa	It depends...from what you have said it sounds like he just wants some action.|`|908b0790cd51aa2d22433510f21b1e39aa	Most of the time, yeah.|`|VS5qCFsbaa	the fact that he wants to have sex with you means he is PHYSICALLY attracted to you... it says nothing about his EMOTIONAL feelings|`|yt2zVOZfaa	1 month and he is already asking for sex?

Their brains are like movie theaters showing porn 24/7. Wanting to have sex has nothing to do with love for them.<br>  <br>  If you think you really like him and trust him enough, then go for it. But if you sense that he's just trying to mess around, then break up.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|V2ZKTMOJaa	no dont do it, you will regret it later, that is something special, dont advertise it for free|`|6kAtYLAdaa	hahhahahhaha boooooottttyyy call!|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	he just wants in ur pants!!!|`|pe9502BAaa	When we are physically attracted to a girl then love has very little to do with it. Has nothing to do with taking you serious I am answering your question which means I am taking you serious, If someone has sex with you they are in part taking you serious, it is what they do afterwords that defines them. He says he can't stop thinking about sex with you, this means he finds you very attractive and wants to sleep with you. It, in the end depends on you and what you are looking for or what you are ready for:)-|`|7xFQrWZaaa	Sex is an urge:  love is a desire to be with.
C8DOT8Y7aa	Establish a more-than-just-friends relationship. Start by asking her for something to play on, like if you are in her class, ask her for a pencil or eraser. If she's slightly interested, she might play about, teasing you for it. Don't worry, it's not that she doesn't like you. She expects you to play along, so maybe walk off in mock sulk, don't do it too heavily though. She might start to think you are weird if you do. If she comes by you and asks you who you like, you know you are on the right track. They are probably just as nervous as you, so they want to get that type of approach as well. This probably means that they like you, and your job just got much easier. <br>  Compliment her, but be careful. Unless they are desperate, they might think you are desperate or making something too obvious. So maybe tell her you like her new hairstyle but then go behind her and mess around with it, spice it up. She'll like your courage to go play about with her hair but make sure she doesn't have dandruff or lice because although you might not be too bothered, she will get embarrassed and scared to go near you. Also, don't lay it on like you've seen in the movies: "I like your handbag.". No guy, in school, will honestly care about a handbag. Something you might truly like you can compliment on. <br>  Start a ball game (not literally). Be a little far away and look at her, admire her. She'll catch your gaze and look at you. Look away suddenly but keep an eye out for her looking back at you. If she is, get up and walk past her, possibly giving her a little smile as you go. <br>  Have chats with her. Ask her if she has any pets and find out some interesting things. Make sure she knows you inside out as well. <br>  Move in closer, be alone and look down. Look up at her eyes, look lost in her world for a second, and then say "I,(pause),like you. So...(cough)..Will you go out with me" While you say this look down. Look up when you say me and smile questioningly. If that isn't your style, there is another way to ask a girl out. All you have to do is walk up (make sure she's alone), and ask her to go out with you in a confident (but relaxed!) manner. <br>  Don't try too hard, girls aren't stupid, they can tell when you get desperate. Be relaxed and confident in yourself. <br>  Don't just become friends with her, become friends with all of her friends, as relationships are made and broken on her friends' opinions. <br>  If she says no, she means NO. Just back off for awhile, leave her to cool down, but don't give up complete hope. <br>  Be confident, not cocky. The difference is there, and very noticeable for girls. Make jokes and be self-confident; women love it when men make them laugh. <br>  When the time comes to ask her out, wait for the opportune moment. Trust your instincts; they will tell you when the time is right. As mentioned earlier, it's probably best not to do it in front of her friends or in front of your friends. It's easier for both of you if you are alone. <br>  If she says "I'll think about it" it's not a good sign, although she could just be nervous, or caught up in the moment, and she's being careful not to make a stupid mistake. Don't bug her about it, let it go a few days - if she doesn't bring it up again, it's a no. <br>  Don't ask her out as a dare, or as a joke - this can really hurt a girl's feelings. Be sure that you are doing it because you want to, if you don't you could really become known as a jerk. <br>  If you see any facial expressions, like an eye raise, make sure you say, "it's okay if you say no."|`|93Pq7zVtaa	Females love honesty just tell her " you know i like you right" She'll probably blush and that's a good thing.|`|iSBxZ3Zlaa	Just say "hey i want to know if you would like to be my companion?

If we got curly hair , we want straight and vice versa ....I know theres just no working us out lol|`|64554a8e1157e502654f643d0ffe309baa	Different people have different tastes. <br>  <br>  And why would you assume that a woman would want to get into a particular size to attract a man. Did you ever think maybe she just thinks she'd look good in that size?|`|DErBSfZgaa	because that's what the media stuffs into our heads.<br>  thin, tall "beautiful" women.<br>  fortunatly i DONT want to become a stick. i like my boobs and a$$<br>  too much to be losing all that weight.|`|EJZVgQyNaa	i don't know mate but you put it right i would hands down prefer a curvy girl over a stick any day!|`|f96fc627f519f3ac55a4b380b5d54678aa	good question!|`|VMoDsdREaa	some women are naturally thin, and some just think they need to be thin to be happy, it's just something thats all in the mind when all people should really care about is being healthy and having a clear good view of who they really are inside and not just what they want the world to see.|`|KM50wTbHaa	for me its cuz i always want to be slimmer and i think its like that for a lot of women. no mater what size, they want to be less. i don't know why actually... i'm not a size zero, i'm an english size six and i'm happy!|`|xV3KM1qnaa	Because they see all these size zero girls getting with all the hot guys, guys say they like curves, but all you have to do is look around and see it isn't really the case|`|8AA2fTDcaa	Not all men do. I've datde guys who like girls to be slim. I know what you mean about super skinny girls though not attractive.|`|774c0eb5f31b806e89824993621a7184aa	That's because women dress to impress other women and not for men.|`|9A2qByAUaa	One of life's wonders. <br>  <br>  i would rather a girl too overweight rather than too underweight... hands down.|`|Ntj4p0Gqaa	its not that girls want to be skinny. just in shape/toned/ not flabby|`|MOcAhQXcaa	Hello! have u seen all the celebrities? The magazines? Some girls feel that in order 2 get a guy they need 2 be skinny. I'm a smaller person by nature, but some women haven't accepted who they r. I think what matters most is who you are on the inside. Outward beauty will gradually fade,but true inner beauty will grow making the person more attractive as the years go by. Also have you ever gone shopping with a girl/woman? It is hard 2 find a good fit unless u r tall skinny & have curves in just the right places.Sometimes this gives women a different perception of themselves & if they haven't been taught that everybody is unique they feel the pressure 2 be thin. Also people have the perception that being thin is healthy. That is sooo NOT true.|`|2qw6E7iCaa	well- i have no curves, coz i was built like that, and proud of it lols<br>  <br>  shouldn't you like the girl for who she is...<br>  <br>  an di agree- can't be bovered with size zero lols|`|ubbKS6BBaa	Magazines! ftw.|`|0xTBYmdGaa	i think its all to do with them  being insecure with themselves.
bj8fK23laa	All guys are different. But you don't really want to be leaving straight after, this gives the girl a bad impression that sex was all you wanted or you didn't enjoy yourself and she did something wrong. Instead just lay there with her. Wrap your arms around her and let her rest her head on you. Stroke her hair. Relax!. You don't even need to talk, your actions says it all. <br>  <br>  Te x|`|Hn3aBIb1aa	One guy did this to me and i was like wtf!!!! dont do it guys! even if you just be honest and say im going out for a bit tht was amazin but i need to get away for a bit least she will no why u are leavin!!|`|wI5SU7ykaa	Probably you once you relieved your stress you feel emanate death upon you cuz she might start to talk-or- you feeling a little guilty after giving it up.|`|XBYiHaWIaa	Fornicating LMAO.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	I guess we're all different.   I don't feel that way.   I often feel TIRED b/c I make sure she's been enjoying herself for at least an hour before I do that, but I don't feel disconnected from her.|`|05d6VYAtaa	i hope not.  then i wont want 2 do it with a guy.

4drQ38qZaa	To not make him lose interest with you just need to be be nice to him and maybe surprise him once in awhile with a gift like his favorite chocolate. <br>  <br>  Questions you can ask?

zvGvrsOxaa	ok this is PERFECT for you, its a "text game" and i play it all the time with new people i meet and wanna get to know and stuff.<br>  its called questions and basically you start off with a question, he answers and asks one back, you answer and ask one back and so forth...im a really outgoing person and i think its a awesome way to get to know someone cause you get to know some of the most random and deep thing about them depending on the questions. The only way this game is really any fun though is if you have no limits to your questions. be creative and ask things like: is it harder for you to look into someones eyes while they are telling YOU something special or when you are telling THEM something? <br>  stuff like that see? and like i said be creative and fun! NO LIMITS!!! :D|`|c4qZRoQgaa	talk about the weather, school, movies, etc. etc.|`|OMDxtS6Eaa	wanna have kids one day?can be some of the questions to ask<br>  family?|`|zi9qUPJvaa	sports<br>  school<br>  his/your friends|`|YsC0QVpAaa	Try to ask him questions that might expose his personality and what type of person he is. Use questions that make him think, but also can be entertaining..ie "If you were stranded on a desert island what two things would you want with you and why?" <br>  "What is one thing you wanna do before you die?" <br>  things like that are always fun to ask and it lets them do all the talking.. then you can throw in a "Why is that?" everyonce and a while.. and the conversation will go on for as long as you like.|`|HOVvKqxsaa	whatever he's interested in<br>  sports<br>  school<br>  movies|`|2bsNGr82aa	Whatever things you guys likes and if you don't know what he likes ask him.

He thinks whoever he said it to is super hot.|`|A6MQuHfbaa	It's just flirting. no big deal... Although that line doesn't make any sense.|`|dWwIEqEwaa	it means that he likes the way you look and that he is bad at talking to girls because he uses cheezy pick up lines|`|GPPVTbXYaa	that just means that u r really hot because the equator is really hot....get it?|`|yARKV3PXaa	It means he has no game and that's one of the worse pick up lines I have ever heard.

XH2o1MM6aa	,Best to have another "talk" and point out she is no longer a guest  but a lodger.As such she pays board as required.<br>  As a lodger she must have her own living area.So more sharing a room together.
s6e4bqahaa	Loooong legs for sure! And if she has pretty eyes too...OMG!!!
Scupj6XVaa	done it in the butt... it's really great actually
WA9Y8QAEaa	Yeah, I can see how you're feeling and everything, but don't worry about it :) she loves YOU, and true, she may still have SOME feelings for her ex, but they're really not as strong as the feelings she has for you :) that's why she's with you, not him. He sounds like a really horrible guy and you sound really great! you two really deserve eachother :) just don't worry about it, she's with you now, not him :) <br>  Good luck :)
AA10043175	Yes, it is possible but only if both partners see the relationship as true friends and the sex as physical release (and not emotional expression).<br>  <br>  This is usually seen as a poor choice in Western culture because of the confusion that most people have between Love, Romance and sexual activity.<br>  <br>  Here as some things to consider:<br>  <br>  Keep communications open and honest.  Make sure that you hide nothing from each other or yourselves.  This allows for the friendship to become something more or allows one of you to break things off before the other gets hurt.  Deceit is nothing more than playing a game (one with winners and losers).<br>  <br>  Usually the very best lovers and later spouses start out as very good friends. <br>  <br>  Remember that two consenting adults is the key.  Once the line is crossed, remember that both of you agreed to the activity.  Treat this like an experiment.  Learn to wade before you swim.  Neither of you can walk or run on water.<br>  <br>  Do not pretend that intimate physical contact will change nothing in your current relationship.  Unless at least one of you is devoid of emotions, the relationship will change.  Both of you must be willing to discuss what is going on inside even if it is confusion or frustration.<br>  <br>  Your last question "What are some signs I should look for to be able to tell if he actually has feelings for me or not?"  can be interpreted several ways.  Do you have feelings for him?  Do you believe that he has feelings for you but has not expressed them?  Do you already know that you will never have feelings for him?  You might try talking before moving on to kissing and more.|`|Ed8BbSzeaa	friend with benefits?|`|c68478bf085bc0e4d6aaf10a27fd367baa	if ur snatch is any good.... he already does lol|`|bnJPvsVWaa	I always tell people that it's beneficial to have a f*** buddy, so long as you can stay away from each other, when one or the other of you has a significant other, so as not to become a cheat buddy instead.   The main reason is this...many people, man and woman, tend to put up with crap they shouldn't put up with, and stay with people they shouldn't stay with, just so they won't be "lonely".   A f*** buddy allows you to make relationship choices, without the pressure of not knowing when you'll be able to feel physical affection again.  A f*** buddy also gives you the benefit of a steady sex partner, to help keep you away from STDs, to which you may be exposed if you're out searching for that affection. That's a huge benefit.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the hardest part is keeping the "buddy" in f*** buddy.  All too often, one or the other will develop feelings.  I don't know that there's a way to prevent.<br>  <br>  You might want to keep an eye on how often he contacts you, and how long he wants to stick around after you've done what you came to do.  Pay attention to how he talks to you and looks at you.  See if there's lust and friendship, or actual affection in his eyes.  <br>  <br>  If there is, you've got some choices to make.   Good luck with it.  I hope you two can keep your heads.|`|87e42b12d9375f23a7f6007b19387ae4aa	yeah for about 5 booty calls. 503930492049202 people have tried this since the beginning of time and all have failed miserably. you will as well.|`|AA11367901	No, if he's a man he don't think like you. <br>  <br>  If you care nothing for him you shouldn't have a problem.|`|Jii448d2aa	eventually someone will start to catch feelings. being a girl you'll be able to know exactly that hes into you more then the arrangements calls. you'll just feel it, women's intuition. Promise!!!|`|z0ro3VkJaa	It is possible...<br>  <br>  It isn't very likely though. More likely than not someone will get emotionally attached if you go that route, which can get very awkward.|`|9zacWxG2aa	Yes, and I believe what you are thinking of is a very old proffesion and legal in many places.|`|oDLdqrJfaa	Lol this sounds like a massive win for him and a small win for you.

hheEB0wpaa	maybe she  really was gay and didn't want to say any thing to any one because maybe she felt like she was going to be laughed at or picked on because she is gay. you should ask her if she was gay before the other girl came and see what she says. then you will know if she was gay before or if she realized that she was gay after the other girl came.|`|Z2FVXeNEaa	wats the ?|`|xBd96wvRaa	Most gay people tried the straight life on for size before accepting they were simply more attracted to the same sex or only attracted.<br>  <br>  Turned her gay? Oh well if that's the case you better cease friendship with your friend - we wouldn't want someone to turn you gay as well. Now that your friend is gay she too must fulfill the gay oath which of course is to use her magic gay dust to turn all those around her gay as well.<br>  <br>  LMAO.<br>  <br>  I suggest you stay out of her business you are too ignorant to give input.  Just be happy for her -even though this heathen of a lesbian from a low class public school has used her evil mind tricks to turn your formally lusting after male athletes that look good on paper friend to a full fledged carpet muncher.<br>  <br>  You sound like a jealous ninny. You are either a male friend or a lesbo yourself. Since gays have the power to covert others sexual desires you better steel clear of your friend otherwise you might  find yourself craving a late night salami snack.<br>  <br>  Lighten up live and let live.|`|WFFXHFfVaa	she could be bi curious and just experimenting, maybe she is gay, and just dated guys to cover up the truth, whatever way, you CANT make someone gay.|`|EhDFNQ5iaa	Whats wrong with public school kids?

Going out with these guys was either a cover up for being gay or she just hadn't realised she had gay feelings until she met this certain girl..she just fell for this particular girl.

Remember, no-one "makes" anyone do anything - it's personal choice.|`|Vhfb7UACaa	People assume that they're straight a lot of times.  I'm sure once she found that she was gay it was much more comfortable.  You can't "make" someone gay.|`|mvotlqL9aa	most likely she's rebelling against life but no one can make a person gay you might have always been gay and just haven't known it. OR maybe she's just experimenting?|`|tLOUuf3Maa	LOL.<br>  <br>  she's probably curious?|`|MtVxBOZXaa	okayy,, thats just not right :((( yuck<br>  <br>  but you really just have to accept people for who they are and seriously, don't start stupid rumors|`|MgMsMExPaa	If you are straight and she is gay you will never understand the relationship. You do not posses the genetic material to do so. What you need to understand is that she is happy with this girl and let that be. Obviously she has a much deeper connection with this girl than with any guy. Just keep in mind that people are born gay it takes a few years for them to realize that they are not dating the correct gender for the way they were born.|`|2QS8j9aOaa	well life has surprises and maybe you liked this girl and are disappointed that she being beautiful, popular and president which is a typical role of a princess picked the other gender and are disappointed on her choice.<br>  Sorry about that and you can't change her choice and just be her friend if you like her as a friend still.|`|mPuRl4tbaa	originallly she was just trying to fit and do what people expected of her and finally when she had the chance she realized whats was really important to her and what she really wanted. just be happy for her as long as shes happy. if you really care for her, the most important thing is her happiness|`|62axZ9rBaa	I would guess that your friend thought she was straight, but discovered that this wasn't so. Personally, I'm glad she found someone she liked.<br>  <br>  Why does it matter that she went from dating guys to dating a girl? To be honest, it sounds like you DO care that she's gay.|`|PDAVQU3Caa	maybe it makes her feel better than dating boys. i don't think the other girl made her gay, it was her choice weather to be gay our straight. sorry i could be of much help, hope everything turns out ok :)|`|m0XAJbzAaa	1- if you don't know you date any one.<br>  2- you said 'rich' if you couldn't get a girl, who better to go out with then a guy who would get you stuff =P|`|iF2MVlaTaa	It could just be an experiment, but i think after 9- 10 months that she's serious about this girl.|`|3tPrSpsFaa	Nicee.|`|578zwk6Baa	so how is this related to your question, or rather what is your question?|`|pkHh5Uj7aa	Any no offense but how is this your problem<br>  your jealous <br>  get over yourself|`|cn1jWO4Haa	first off, does it matter if she's from a public school?<br>  secondly, talk w/ ur friend. maybe shes been gay her whole life and never known it!|`|7RO4Pxeaaa	ok you have no question here,  yes the other girl kinda made her like that but you have no control over it|`|vBRXR0QEaa	Whats your point?  She likes girls, so get over it.|`|e489ymwhaa	shes a lesbo now.....get the hell out of the drama|`|oDLdqrJfaa	HELL yeah!!....what the problem here bro?|`|AA11103763	The other girl didn't "make her gay" - that is really off thinking. I have loads of guy friends who dated women in college, but when I have reconnected with them recently, they are in committed relationships with another guy. They just weren't ready to "come out" when we were younger and now are comfortable with who they are.<br>  <br>  Your friend probably has had feelings for girls for ages, and this new girl was someone who let her be open about her preferences.  From what you have said in this question, it doesn't seem like you are very accepting of her . Just let her be who she is and enjoy her friendship!|`|k3DdIDGoaa	well you know, this girl might of influenced your friend but, at the same time she might be bi-sexual. Its not a made thing, but also she might be bi curious, meaning shes confused and doesn't know wat she wants. I think wat you should do is talk to her say wats shes been up to then after a couple of days ask her if she would like to go out on a date with her, if she refuses then maybe you would know she isn't interested in guys anymore.|`|Em1xK7Gpaa	thats kinda weird. maybe she got tired of all the guys she dated, she probably thought that there all the same. she might of wanted to try something new.|`|nIOXmNBfaa	wow! dude! have u tried talking to her!!1 u need to get her to her senses!! but if she doesnt wanna listen.. then.. its her life!!!!!!! and we gottA let her make her own decisions!...|`|siWeuiTTaa	cool!|`|OxbOAm5Xaa	well, this is a tough one. i just want to say you are a great friend for sticking by her regardless of her sexual preference. i hope she really does realize how good of a friend you are. okay....now on to your question. i don't know if there is a correct answer for this but i will gladly give you my personal opinion. maybe the whole time she was dating the " the cute rich guys" she was trying to hide her true sexual feelings. what i mean by that is maybe she was trying to make herself like boys, and that's why she may have not slept with them because there was no "true" connection on that level.  Now that she met this girlfriend of hers she can be her true self and express her sexuality the way she feels most comfortable.  but she is young and it could be a phase. time will only tell. but you are great for caring so much and sticking by her.|`|cb6ToDZYaa	First of all, no one can make anyone else gay.  If your truly a friend to her, you will be happy for her, no matter who she is with.  Chances are, she is bi-sexual, or was hiding her homosexuality for fear of how others would react.  It doesn't matter how "rich or cute" these other boyfriends were because she obviously didn't love them.  If she has found someone that she can love and be happy with, you should support her and be happy for her.  You seem really upset by this, but I don't suspect it has anything to do with her being in a romantic relationship with a girl.  Honestly, by your tone, I think you are having jealousy issues with the fact that you feel you are losing your best friend to another girl.  She is in love with this other girl - it has nothing to do with your friendship with you.  It's no different than if she had a boyfriend that took up a lot of her time.  I think though because it's a girl, that you feel you are being replaced.  You need to talk openly and honestly about how you feel, because I can tell you really care about your friend, and if your attitude continues in this manner, you may lose your best friend, and that
S0APZr5Aaa	Because they blush at the fact that there crush has made eye contact and is noticing them. Its queit hilarious actually how ppl can act when seeing there crush lol.|`|qyMc5yOFaa	playin cool|`|ahujYDBdaa	becasue theyre happy that they caught their crush starring.

Couldn't he cheat w/ a woman?<br>  If you have trust issues Do Not move in w/ him.<br>  As for being bi. I have several friend who are, It appears to have the same "rules" as straight or gay relationship. If you are with someone you love and are committed, you are committed to that person. Gender really does not seem to be an issue with the pairs I know. They are with the person they fell in love with.<br>  Bi just seems to mean that the person does not limit them self to one gender when dating, etc.... they are attracted to either gender.|`|9xvyjRuBaa	I went out with a guy and we lasted like six months together and actually became great friends. He later told me he was bi. I think he is truly just plain gay. He was in love with this guy when he was with me. Point being you can only talk to him and trust him. Suspicion for the rest of your relationship isn't healthy either. Talk and make sure you're comfortable with where your at. other than that you won't b happy|`|B1MnNcI8aa	sounds like a reasonable answer.  if he's not experienced he may be curious.  you can fuel it curiosity and keep him close at the same time.  ask that he perform oral sex on you after he orgasms or kiss him after you perform oral sex on him.<br>  <br>  Either way, he'll get a taste, enjoy the experience with you and not think twice.|`|ubbKS6BBaa	If he's confused about his sexuality. You might have to give him time and let him figure that out. Imagine being with him a long time and he finally realizes it, he'll either have to go. Because that's not what you go for.<br>  <br>  Or having a working 3 some relationship which sounds sucky also. <br>  <br>  Maybe give him a porn test?? Have him watch guy on guy porn and see if it turns him on something fierce. Tell him you want to help him figure this out because it scares you. :(|`|toWa68Goaa	If you don't trust him then this relationship will never work and also it is quite embarrassing to find out that he is having an affair with a man.<br>  <br>  Be honest with him and tell him how you truly feel about the relationship.|`|hdc3d3w8aa	Read a book on bisexuality at a bookstore.

wjPcDlK7aa	If you see your friends at the movies, then talk to them with her. Include her in the conversation as much as possible, and make sure to hold her close so she feels safe. Hold her hand in the movie haha she'll love it! And once in a while, turn your head and smile at her so she knows that you're more interested in her than the movie ;) <br>  Good luck with your date!|`|fUngGukYaa	the good thing about going to the movies on a date is that you dont have to do much talking at all. if she talks to you during the movie, then oviously you can answer her. but otherwise, ask her abotut her famiily, her activities, her friends, even about random things like what food she likes to eat lol. the more you get to know her the more comfortable youll be around her, and then she'll open up(:

yuwIUlHLaa	duh, if his ***** in someones mouth and shes good, he could just close his eyes and pretend its someone hot|`|3KAiV9zTaa	HELL YES!!!! this may be going against what the question is asking but ok, my boyfriend has and AMAZING sex drive. he doesn't even have to be in the mood to have sex or anything and all i have to do is press my body against his. like holding him by his waist and pushing my pelvic against his and he get this insane sexual excitement! i'll know if he really gets in the mood then because he starts to do this grinding motion with his body and then he holds me in position by putting his arms around me and then holding me close to him. but when he gets excited its hilarious he has to hide it with his jacket in front of him! XD<br>  yeah...but its only funny until he gets you stimilated as well *pouts* and its no fair. it aways backfires.<br>  <br>  but yeah. men are just horny human beings lol. they'll have sex with any girl.
yuwIUlHLaa	It doesn't matter either way. It depends on the peope..if you're shy it might not work if you cant think or things to talk about, but if youre really out going, you can always just get into dumb fake arguments about like music or something, if the other person doesnt like your music or whatever, you can just have fun with it|`|GPgykIJZaa	Yes, you can be with someone and have nothing in common, but when your partner / spouse ask you to be with him/her even though you don't like it, you need to to be with her/him.<br>  <br>  Good communications.<br>  is always a solutions to every problem.
HJrTuihcaa	keep talking to her and be yourself.|`|Wk02nH2Aaa	You should ask her what changed|`|UCqojp7yaa	there are a lot of variables in this situation. How do you feel about this girl. do you like her. if you do just ask her whats going on. She might say something like, "i dont know because im confused". if she says that just give her some time to think and dont ask her everyday what she thinks. she'll come around.

A lot of people aren't comfortable talking about sex with people.|`|8yncQq62aa	you can deffinately tell for sure if a girl has by actually having sex with her. anyone whos not a virgin knows what i mean. you cant tell on a male, but you can look for clues such as: he sucks and has no clue what hes doing. he keeps talking and apologizing. he cant find the hole. he cums on contact.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	"Have you ever had sex?"<br>  "No"<br>  <br>  And that's how you tell :)|`|yKV9W5Xfaa	Well i have a friend who claims she can tell if someones a virgin by their posture/the way they walk.

KVFYJrDJaa	Wow, tough one. The sad fact is any attempt, no matter how diplomatic, to give your opinion on the matter (or offer guidance, or parenting advice, etc) *can be* construed as you telling her how to raise her child, which you already know ain't gonna fly. <br>  <br>  I guess it kind of boils down to this: Does your gf think of you as an influence in her daughter's life? If yes, then you have to find the most respectful way possible to let her know how you feel. If no, then I'm of the opinion that you're pretty much out of luck. Regardless of the answer to this question, you have to let her know that you are absolutely not trying to tell her how to raise her daughter, but you feel that it is important to tell your opinion on the matter. If she is receptive, great, if not, just let it go. <br>  <br>  But if I were you, and I'm not but I'm just saying, I would find an easy going way to tell her how I feel and in no uncertain terms tell her that when her daughter comes home knocked up, the likelyhood of which is very high for a sexually active girl her age, that I would not be accepting any moral or financial responsibility. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, if it does not bother the mother, there's nothing you can do short of encouraging the mother to get the girl on the pill ASAP. <br>  <br>  Sir, I wish you only the best and whatever happens, I hope it works out for you.|`|lA8WKvAyaa	I understand that you feel a right to an opinion about your girlfriends parenting skills and her daughters social life, but you don't; at least not yet. You've only been dating her for two months, and known her daughter for two months i dont get how you feel a need to adress the situation. its not your kid not your problem, let the real father handle it if he wants to.
evJ2GEodaa	Unfortunately there will always be people who think they are better than you and they will let you know. I would rather be ugly and respectful than hot and that's all, beauty is only skin deep. I mean what would they do without their looks.|`|Gojbv3Nraa	I agreed with you when I was in your age bracket. And...I was called ugly a lot. I bet I still am sometimes, but lots of people call me cute now.  I smile a lot more and think less on total world domination. :D Confidence will make some people think you are thinking yourself too special, but you will find those people are going to be mean and not your personality type anyway, so stick with those who encourage you to be confident and optimistic in all things, no matter what. You could look like Frankenstein and still deserve to give the world optimism and show confidence. :D<br>  <br>  I am guessing the prettier ones think they are better because they are more than  just confident: they have been taught they are beautiful/pretty and therefore special. So some let it get to their heads, and become a mentality of some sort, an excuse or reasoning even. "So and so can't come be in my group coz I am prettiest and no one else should be paid attention to." That kind of thing. It's...ridiculous really.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|gjtdLPIYaa	I am sure you look handsome and you are right you stay confident. and  tell  those mean girls to f off.|`|hJWjSWYXaa	when I was younger  a lot of people told me I was ugly too but just like you I kept telling myself that the inside of a person is what counts most. now that I'm 20 I get told that I'm pretty and that my personality is great unlike most "pretty" girls my age. I also don't look at guys for there bodies or if they have money I really look at them for who they are on the inside and I think that is the most important thing not looks at all!|`|K6JSNQJQaa	I think your mom is being a great mom to you...listen to her!  You seem to have a good head on your shoulders too.  You're right, you're a work in progress and will be for several more years.  Don't sweat the acne, you'll out grow it.  Those so called "pretty girls" aren't so pretty without all that make-up are they?  It's all about what's on the inside of you that counts anyway...so you're on your way to becoming a wonderful and warm human being, not to mention a gentleman.  Believe me, those are the kinds of guys most women look for when it's time to look for a partner.  Keep up the good work....and kudos to your mom!|`|0c9d887dbda833482a70e923def3561daa	don′t hear what girls say about you. I'm not beautiful, I admit, but that has nothing to do. by the way, i think that african american  are very nice, I mean it. also, i have acne too, you know?. and you know what?, who care about people saying me?.<br>  kisses, bye|`|wdFwirb4aa	Ah, just ignore those "pretty" girls. There will come the day when you feel confident with yourself, and then someone will notice you for you, doesn't matter what you look like.|`|cb6ToDZYaa	Please don't listen to any of these girls who are trying to make you feel bad about yourself.  You sound like a beautiful person on the inside, and that is all that counts.  I know that in high school that looks seem so important, and what other people think of you seems so critical, but if you ask me, it is the people who are saying these things to you are the truly ugly ones.  You can take the most beautiful woman in the world, and if she has an ugly heart, she is no longer attractive to me at all.  You hold your head high, because you have what none of those girls have - a beautiful soul.  In a few years, you will be out of high school, and none of this will matter at all.  You will continue into life as the beautiful human being you are, but they are the ones who are going to suffer.  I believe in karma, and they have a lot of pain and humiliation coming to them.  Love yourself, and as hard as it is, ignore their immature remarks to you.  Their opinion means nothing - your inner beauty will shine through.|`|e1af88eac281c905066de872cfd4a497aa	hi precious,<br>  you are what you are inside. as we age we start to look better and better as we get older/ don't worry about anybody what they think of you just keep a positive addititude and god will take care the ones that's running their mouth, pray for them and keep on going. there is not one ugly bone or mark on your body if so its only for you to know and them to mind their business. one day when you've gottern older you will see a handsome young man.the real reason why girls call you ugly its because they don't like themself and when they look in the mirror at theirself they see ugliness of themself so dont' fall for that mess its just the devil coming out of their mouth. smile when they talk stupid stuff and speak kind to them kindness can kill negetavie words so be encouraged and keep your head up and everything will be alright. its what your family think of you and god always love you no matter what. just think i bet you are a beautiful person inside and you keep that nice smile and be bless.|`|ecab2985a2d136d03ff8f4eaaf1540e0aa	I'm sorry those girls call you ugly, it is probably to boost their confidence and ego to think there is someone uglier than them out there because girls judge themselves harshly and won't stop complaining about their flaws. I'm sure you're not ugly and beauty only goes so far. It's what's on the inside that counts, and not all pretty girls put down guys, just superficial ones. :)|`|6kAtYLAdaa	yeah they do.  and classy women dont prefer thugs.  pretty girls get by on their looks and it causes a false feeling a superiority.  your mom is absolutely right.  dont worry about it high school is stupid anyways.  and theres someone handsome or beatifull hiding inside of everyone ( im talking about outer looks here)  sometimes it just takes a haircut or a wadrobe change or weight loss or whatever!  i mean have you ever watched beauty and the geek? some of those guys after their makeovers are so fu**ing hott! dont worry about it k?  :) just keep on smiling|`|lTUXdbCTaa	Be confident in yourself! This is an awkward stage in life. Everything is growing and changing. It'll work itself out in the end.<br>  And if you really want the honest truth, put up a picture.|`|kOV3QIa5aa	Yeah i see your point but in todays society out ward apperence means everything lol sorry!|`|QeALCWbqaa	aw|`|RylUX7WTaa	u will become handsome ,try me at pinkgirl1452@yahoo.com
Otatq4LTaa	I say that if you like him, go out with him. If your friends have a problem with him they'll just have to get over it. They can't pick the people you go out with, only you can. And it's not like they'll stop being your friends if you go out with him.
KTqdwG3Xaa	You should trust her, what is a relationship without trust?|`|gjtdLPIYaa	real talk. she is shady she probably didn't want you to go because she was probably doing something she wasn't suppose to do.and so what if hasn't seen her friends in 2 months there should of been no problem with you going along. and the whole issue with her  sitting on your friend lap basically grinding on him you should of dump her right then and there. most likely she is probably cheating.|`|TbLX1PHPaa	i would dump her,even if i knew or thought my boyfriend didn't like my friends,i would still let him meet them,because they are a big part of my life and i would want my boyfriend to feel secure.And her grinding on your friend?that's disrespectful and shows she probably is capable of cheating<br>  <br>  i would break up with her,these are warning signs of a cheater
KTqdwG3Xaa	No I did not talk to her.|`|Lnw6ZYMoaa	For awhile we didn't talk because we were both really angry. <br>  Then we finally talked about our feelings and became "friends". We don't talk to each other anymore, except every couple of months.|`|IkrnvC2Naa	its been a year for me since my ex and i broke up. its soo awkward still. in the beginning it was sorta awkward then in the middle it was extremely. now we text like once every two months for like an hour but we pretend we don't know each other. it took a while to finally get closure. but now we have closure so its all good.  it just takes time
RzBjyzEzaa	let her be and don't bother her, obviously she doesn't want to be friends any more.  good luck.
F2rI3Juaaa	She is being a tease! Doesn't want you but doesn't want anyone else to have you either! Please don't fall into her trap!|`|PGmcLovfaa	I'm really sorry, but the whole "I just want to be friends" excuse is usually the easiest way to break up with a partner.  The fact that she's ignoring you either means that there's a lot on her mind and she doesn't want to deal with you right now--that, or she is trying to avoid talking about getting back together.  Either way, she is giving off signals that she doesn't want to be friends.<br>  Now, the kiss gives off strange signals, but if she makes you look like a fool, stay away from her.  She may just be trying to keep you hopeful, but in all actuality, I think that she's using you.  Find yourself a better girl--you deserve something great after dealing with your ex =]<br>  (By the way, that whole breakup-on-Valentine's-day was pretty lame of her.)|`|y7JML5UYaa	okay i think that something you were doing was bothering her and maybe something happened on valentines day happened that set her off. she ignores you because when she said she wants to be friends, it was her way of breaking up with you without being rude. but she is rude because if she makes you look like a fool in front of poeple then shes embarrassed by you. let her go hun.
7KRYTaReaa	he's probably jealous that your spending time with his best friend instead of him, but its better if you ask him yourself, so you can be sure
714KGK9Eaa	Hmmm.....don't go! If he doesn't wanna go out coz of the rain then just change the date. It's not safe going to someone's place who you don't even know.
Qz3sii2caa	You're probably right. Unfortunatly guys don't really change all that much as they get older, they still aspire for younger and prettier.  Lots of guys will just hit on you because you're hot, but stay strong. Not all guys are pigs and some guy out there will like you no matter what you look like.
xXRmY2tCaa	because they are either not that into you just wanna see a pretty girls body, or they are too afraid too, they could be shy and want to but cant, if you're looking for someone, and u see a guy looking but not approaching, and u think this is genuine, go up and slip it(your number) yourself|`|j94HCVeyaa	cuz just that doesnt mean they think u like them i mean alot of girls smile so they smile back, and guys stare at girls all the time like one after another so it could be that tehy didnt think much but when u look at them they quickly had to do something<br>  oh yeah about ur question guys going after u for u looks<br>  <br>  i mean personality cant go taht deep theres just so much you can say and act so ofcarse both contributes to a person Liking you<br>  <br>  but back to this one- if u want them to ask u have to do something to show that u want to give, not like ur forced to by being nice to them only
3KAiV9zTaa	OMG my favorite type of kissing! it is wonderful, i love it, i love it, i love it! I am 16 going on 17. My first kiss was just a kiss on the lips. I got my first tongue kiss after a pep rally at school, my current boyfriend of almost 9 months now took me up the stairs, and it was like off a movie! I told him i had to go home and he asked me to stay a little longer. i was like no i had to go home so i started walking off. He grabbed my hand and pulled me up to him. He first looked at my face and smiled. He leaned in and kissed me, and then slid his tongue into my mouth. Of course when you french kiss(tongue kissing) your tongues are gonna touch. I just use my tongue to play around with his. Make sure to watch out for each others teeth lol cause that hurts.  And then after he was through, he smiles again, gives me a kiss on the forehead, and then tells me bye and walks away.<br>  <br>  Now with my boyfriend that's the only kind of kiss we do. I love it, and we always have our make-out sessions with it. But...it always leads to something else so yeah.|`|OWVXKKLdaa	My first kiss was with my current boyfriend in August and we're 18.<br>  It wasn't a tongue kiss either.<br>  He showed me that a few months ago... and it wasn't weird having him teach me...
A9tR1Bjjaa	just put your self out there and hope for the best like i guess a way to do it well how my gf did it is she was w8ing at my house on my bed naked and we made out and went from there she said it hurt her a little so have him go slow with you wow that makes me feel like a porn directer|`|0JGFv5PXaa	your too young if you dont know|`|W618lfZ6aa	Make him use a condom, and get on the pill or shot.<br>  <br>  Let him do the work if you aren't sure, he should go slow.|`|3KAiV9zTaa	this kind of stuff you don't plan. usually i'm the one asking these questions about me and my boyfriend but don't you think that's kind of stupid of you to want to have sex with him? first time experiences should be special. if you want to have sex so badly, but don't want to end up pregnant, stick to fingering honey. its just as good and you won't get pregnant.|`|deg9d50faa	just practice on me.|`|cn1jWO4Haa	honey, u really want 2 b a mom?|`|Ek2INE3Kaa	I think that you should just talk to your boyfriend about it. Tell him that you're ready to have sex for the first time, and since it is your first time ask him to be gentle.
VvRHin1Jaa	if you want to text him and you miss him then you should if you want to
dFHsAXDMaa	I would say date casually right now if you wait until you leave in September to tell her how you feel because you are afraid to drive 40 minutes to go out to eat or to movies you could loose the love of your life when someone close to her asks her out instead keep it easy and simple until september though but tell her you really care about her and can not wait to start college<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|8yncQq62aa	usually i would say you shouldnt wait for anything in life, but since your going to be going to same college, wait till then.|`|a20KcBqdaa	40 mins isnt that long a time. if you really love her, and she really loves you, then that should not be a boundary. i say ask her out. live life to the full mate. when you get to college, you'll have someone to be with, to give you strength. go for it. good luck.|`|jmYl4hEFaa	If you really like her then you should ask her out now cause what if she finds another boyfriend by the time you go to college!|`|MgMsMExPaa	Yes and date others while you are waiting on her. You have no way of knowing what is going on right now since you are not there.|`|klOP21xTaa	carpe diem my son|`|PLsJpPqOaa	i guess... if you want to wait... it's easier to not have long distance relationships but if you want to try i say go for it.<br>  :)|`|05d6VYAtaa	college if it is the same college.|`|THAMJdQyaa	sooner the better! Love can't wait.  You may regret it if you wait|`|7oN5qYOsaa	yes that will be better
MgmgmO0Raa	If she seems shy, ask her out in a not so public location. Ask her where there aren't many people, so she's less uncomfortable.<br>  She obviously likes you. Before you ask her out though, find out what she likes to do. <br>  You could ask her out to the movies, less talking and more contact, it helps get rid of the awkwardness of a first date.|`|AA10356455	well be really sweet, haha try to bumb into her and nock her books down "by accident" and pick them up and be really nice about it. <br>  try to sit near her or be close to her. smile at her if she looks at you. talk to her if its a boring class talk about how you cant stand how the teacher talks walks smiles(etc..)  but dont start asking her biger questions about her life untill you know shes alright with talking to you ( youll know shes okay with it if she responds smiles back gives her opinion if she doesnt want to talk shell prob. try to egnor you and insted of comenting shell just nod) also if you see her in the hall you can say hi if you find where her locker is try to take that route to your next class. hope this helped :) good luck with her !
C8DOT8Y7aa	Be sure that his attention is what you want. Don't just try to get a guy to look your way, you want attention and you want to feel good about yourself. You don't want to lead someone on like a puppy taken out for a walk. You could end up in a very awkward or uncomfortable situation--see the Warnings below. <br>  Be yourself. Everyone probably says this, but it's true! No guy wants a girl to pretend she is something she's not. As a general rule, guys don't expect girls to change. Resist the temptation to put on a show or to do anything that just isn't you just to get his attention. <br>  Get a new look. Don't change who you are (you never want to do that because you'll actually end up changing yourself) just try something different; if he doesn't like you for who you are let him be. Try a new hairstyle, new clothes, etc. It's a good idea to change things up once in a while, just because variety's the spice of life, and it might help you catch his eye. Try being that girl who is different from all the other okay looking girls giving him the eyes, because beauty is common, but a good outlook and a great energy are very rare. <br>  Smile and make eye contact. Whether closed-mouth or open-mouth, do it. Unless it really makes you feel artificial, learn how to shoot people a reassuring smile, letting them know that you're a happy and confident person who wants to enjoy life. The idea is to communicate that you're inviting their company. <br>  Flirt. Do it as little or as much as you want, but remember that too much flirting (especially with other guys) will likely get him to take notice, but perhaps not in a good way. If he reacts and you don't think its real (he's just doing it because you're there and you're a girl and he thinks he can do better, let him know he can't). If he is faking it, call his bluff and say something that makes him know you don't think he is 'all that'. For example, if he comes close, pull a face and offer him gum. This will unbalance his ego. <br>  Start up conversations that have to do with if it's where you are or if he's talking to you. Make sure you don't go on about nothing. Definitely make sense when you talk to him. Don't twirl your hair, flick your eyelashes or GIGGLE nonstop. He can get kind of scared and make fun of you, no matter how old you are, guys will always be the same. Be yourself! Just be who you are, thats the # 1 quality guys look for in a girl. <br>  Hang out with him often; you don't always want to be hanging around because you might look like an annoying bug that's always around and never goes away. Try to start a conversation about an interesting topic, for example if your at a football game ask confidently, but cutely "did i miss any action?". This will tell him that you want to know about the game, but also you want to get his opinion so he will automatically talk to you about the game (or other topics) the whole game. Start slowly like a movie or party try not to make it so noticeable cause he might not be interested. <br>   <br>  *Whisper Whisper*Talk to him. Try to get to know him a little by discussing things you have in common. A good way to start a conversation is to ask him a question. Listen to him and don't interrupt him when he is talking. You could even compliment him or ask for help. A good opener is spray two different perfumes on each wrist, then go up to him and ask him his favorite. This should get him to talk to you. Also be friendly to his friends to help him feel more comfortable around you. Some guys don't notice girls unless they talk to the guy. <br>  Be assertive. You are the girl. You have the power. A lot of guys are shy and awkward around girls they like, so don't hold back. Do what you want to do. Boys like a powerful girl. Be decisive. Tell him what you want him to do, etc.--just don't get too bossy! <br>  Make him feel special. There's got to be a reason that you want him to notice you, and that's because you noticed him first. Let him know--subtly--that you're interested in who he is, and that you sincerely want to get to know him better. <br>  Be brave. Stand up for who you are, and what you believe in. Ultimately, this will catch the attention and respect of someone who is going to work well for you, even if it turns out not to be this guy. <br>  Don't be a slob! It's a real turn-off for a guy when he notices a girl hasn't brushed her hair or wears the same outfit every other day. Even if you don't fall within the typical expectations, just looking presentable is always desirable--irrespective of who is the guy or girl. <br>  Just Talk To Him. When it comes down to it, talking to a guy, and flirting with him will get his attention, and if it doesn't then nothing will. <br>  Walk in front of him. It may be very simple, but it works. When coming out of the class, or playing in gym class, just walk in front of him, and he should be able to notice you. If he walks in front of you a lot, he probably likes you.

wW6NJk4jaa	obviously he likes you, its just hard to tell if its in a close friendship way or more, I would wait until a situation came up where I could joke about other girls with him and see if he seems interested in other girls, or try to make a joke about what would happen if the 2 of you dated, so if he acts weird about it you can play it off as a joke
QAJpufjwaa	Thats so sweet sort of like a Romeo and Juliet kind of thing ... lol anyways just strike up a conversation with her talk about a movie you saw and one you want to see and see if she says she wants to see it too and then you might end up going to see a movie together lol something along those lines. Or try to find something that you have in common with her.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!
KbcdLsz3aa	talk to her and see if she is feeling the same things and if so you owe it to yourself and her to give it one last try ........ good luck.........|`|fLvzhAX8aa	wait it out bro.<br>  happened to me too.|`|41JhpCRpaa	it takes time
VgVoz2mzaa	hang around other guys, act like you dont like him anymore<br>  and make him jealous<br>  it sounds mean but it helps
9yIX1F3xaa	It is best to move on. Even if you could get him to "grow up" it would never be the same as it was before he cheated.  You would always be waiting for the time when he does it again.
nypzET7Laa	NO WAY! being in the army is such an honor! you get to defend your country for goodness sake! that is never a bad thing. you will have so many Americans thanking you (well actually the army, but u are part of the army) for protecting them and their families. It is also a huge plus as to all the benefits you get. After serving, you can get like all kinds of money and such. My friend's mom just got out of the army and they now are LIVING THE LIFE. after she got out, the family got a pool! It will also be a huge experience for you and I bet that you will never think of life as you thought of it before. I don't know if you're talking about the army in general, but being in any armed forces is just as good.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Shucks yes!! beware something wicked this way comes!|`|M8HVkIikaa	Being in the army means you want to help your Country.<br>  It is a good and bad thing. <br>  <br>  Good becuase it will get over with . Just because of the congress and president make the decisons and make war means you should help them out and fight.<br>  <br>  bad because its war..and war isnt good. =]|`|IqoRBVUTaa	It makes you anything but! Your fighting for your country man! I personally think that the war is kinda stupid at the moment, but others don't see it that way. My uncle is a commander in the Marines, and he always come to visit bringing story's that are so exciting, yet heart breaking at the same time. Who knows, maybe some day I'd like to join the war. That would be cool.|`|w6MtjrMVaa	Not at all because your doing your country a service to benefit all of us to have our freedoms, that other country's don't have.Nobody likes wars but when it happen we should be very proud of people like yourself, fighting for a course.|`|MwHxyNogaa	NO!|`|62xJhGxraa	well i dont think so. cause i mean your fighting for your country how does that make you a bad person?|`|06iz5ttqaa	no but the army is the worst branch in the military <br>  <br>  AIR FORCE ALL THE WAY BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|EZsVuLV7aa	course its not its ur choice weather ya do it or not goin to da army dont make ya a bad person think of da lives u will be saving by going probably ours at that matter|`|OlVnw3esaa	no being in the army doesn't make u a bad person. people in the army are risking their lives to keep us safe.|`|TAMGy07Daa	Yes, supremely EVIL|`|XAcxEVGRaa	WTF. How would protecting your country be a bad thing?|`|bV7TbNNoaa	no its an honor to serve
MzlEoOjQaa	No! Pick yourself up, dust yourself down, stop yearning for what is not yours, and get on with your life - unless you are a drama queen who is enjoying the situation, in which case<br>  <br>  you GO girl!|`|DIvU3ZGYaa	If he tells you he likes another girl, that probably means he doesn't like you back. I'm sorry, but he is also being a gentleman about the situation.|`|WDGPrlEUaa	its like the cheeze is not in your hand anymore and you are asking how will it taste!! :p<br>  <br>  the guy has made it clear to you that he likes some one else..<br>  i knw your liking towards him is just a plain crush..<br>  so move on fine some one else with whom you can be foreva...<br>  <br>  take him as a friend and find some one else..<br>  theres no point in trying when the boy is committed! or wteva<br>  <br>  you can get much betta = ]|`|LmswcIdtaa	If he has made a point of telling you that he likes another girl, he is being a gentleman and letting you know that the door is closed. Please respect it.|`|q66hhy20aa	he probably sees you as a friend.... tell him you have feelings for him but that youre ok just being friends if hes not interested. if you make it obvious that you want to be more than friends he will be more confident if he likes you back|`|6GpN0NOIaa	if u reaspect his feelings and make him feel like if he falls he can always land on you then hell eventualy like u|`|GexgmXMJaa	he might be talking about you. or he just might accually like another girl. to be good friends you should ask him who it is and get them together he'll "love" you for that.
ob0QTNqmaa	Just make sure he doesn't mistake your confidence for *********, that could turn him off! But don't be Frigid Brigid in the corner either!!Find the prefect balance!..Well keep doing your best in the appearance stakes, and try smiling at him and see if he smiles back, and saying hi to him if you see him in the corridor, and try to talk to him after class like "That was so boring" or something.. And if Mary isn't pretty and you are, he won't be long realising what he's missing!!:)

Well some guys have low standards no offense. Others are just too horny to be picky on looks. But a regular guy who has avg skill with women does not check out ugos|`|f339a9f3cf7d571157484d675d6af3b7aa	Guys stare at all girls. Fat, Ugly, Skinny, Pretty - they are always looking for something to talk about.  But then again we ladies do the same thing.|`|G3emC90haa	oh sure. all the time ;)|`|WQOC6ILMaa	I don't ever stare at girls that I think are ugly|`|J031Sg34aa	i dont know...<br>  they stare for lots of reasons<br>  dont jump to conclusions C=|`|3DT5CUaBaa	Hahaha thats a funny question but hmm you'll never know till you ask him! I mean there's one guy in my Spanish class who used to sit straight on facing me and he ALWAYS stared at me too, like never stopped! I was freaked out. But then we changed seats and now he stares at the girl who sits vertically from him now.|`|9YAP6MmUaa	men stare at all girls for any reason - usually sexual|`|xJdKiwFmaa	No , i dont stare at grls who don't fit my taste because I'm afraid they will think I'm attracted to them.|`|emJ79qagaa	if thats YOU your very beautiful. <br>  <br>  Yeah, with a nice body and blond hair, but an ugly face<br>  <br>  they are like, that girl is so hot and i tell them, she's ugly!|`|00390bee0bdfb56e0334bd2845fadd9aaa	Beauty is only.............<br>  <br>  a light switch away|`|51NtvXqqaa	unless they r saying to themselves " danm this girl is ugly"|`|izFtmVCYaa	no why would u want to look at something ugly for a long time|`|4MxCAm6gaa	He is probably looking past you. Who sits back there?|`|iNvGnl0Xaa	No, I don't.|`|Muz6j3qOaa	Ugly is an opinion. Everyone has different types and interprets beauty differently. It's the awful media that portrays beauty in a way that not many people are. If a guy stares at a certain girl who most would not think is attractive, it is their opinion that they are cute, or beautiful, etc. Everyone is beautiful in their own way.|`|XL4sAPbmaa	no we barf<br>  LOL hahahaha|`|xWg1krzBaa	I don't tend to stare at girls lol just by chance. Absolutely not!  Who's to say that you're ugly? Usually that's a sign of low self esteem but it doesn't always mean there's any support for these feelings other than your own twisted thoughts.  That's the basis of this piece.  You are asking if this guy likes you or thinks your ugly.  Who's to judge who is ugly?  He's interested, try to talk to him ;)|`|DAueFg0Paa	well r u ugly?|`|9XjtEdEqaa	so are you calling yourself ugly? dont say that about yourself. maybe he thinks your attractive and is thinking about talking to you soon or asking you out.|`|pSNex1a1aa	this isnt one of the "i'm trying to get told i'm pretty" questions is it...|`|VgiUGqxtaa	If you're that ugly that you have a disfigured face or some sort of witchlike warts on your face, then yeah he is staring @ an ugly girl..<br>  <br>  I would too..|`|IcAO0QuBaa	Normally not maybe your not as ugly as you think you are.|`|TAMGy07Daa	I tend to be Normal and stare at amazingly beautiful girls only. :3|`|ILxQYrrPaa	well I don't know because im not a guy but there's guys that stare because they like that person <br>  maybe that guy likes you|`|klZK6UhNaa	No I never stare, I just look intensely at hot chicks until they pass away. <br>  <br>  <br>  Ugly girls are hot in there own ways.|`|4Y2w3EeXaa	yeah cos they look freaky, it's like you can't peel your eyes away, in a bad way|`|5KjvNg2oaa	usually stare at hot girls|`|ujIeOsDNaa	If they're kind of retarded......yes for a moment, then the newness runs out!<br>  <br>  Other than that no!|`|dqfSoSkpaa	first of all, no matter how "ugly" a girl is, someone out there thinks shes the most beautiul girl on earth. and that goes for "good looking" girls too, someone will think shes not good looking at all. if hes staring at you, hes obviously interested in you whether you think youre ugly or not. the question is....are you just going to sit around and wonder why hes staring at you? or are you going to pick your chin up, try and feel confident, and approach him?|`|TQOSW78Vaa	no.|`|K119R72Caa	yes they can|`|jJNGPMO6aa	nope|`|8JbECTi1aa	awhh umm i dont think they wouldd idk why would they want to?|`|f85459126cfd7c5ea3b1362df9d88d56aa	Maybe... just maybe... he doesn't see you as ugly... everybody has different tastes.  What's ugly to some is gorgeous to others.<br>  <br>  How about a little self confidence here?!?  Smile at him...<br>  <br>  The worst that could happen is that he turns out to be a jerk.  Nothing new in this world... right?|`|4Qx8lGs0aa	Sometimes, rarely though. We usually stare at very pretty girls that we can't take our eyes off. Have fun|`|BE0zSvlkaa	if you;re butt ugly and look like a monster..anyone would stare
Molu004zaa	Probably just a phase - that or he's just really horny lately. Either way, it's immature and rude. If I were you, I'd tell him to stop.|`|K4Fnbvjuaa	He probably wants to have sex with you. Maybe he is bored with his girlfriend (sex-wise)....if it's uncomfortable for you, tell him to knock it off. If his girlfriend finds out, it will be all kinds of drama....and she will blame you....the girl always gets blamed. Be careful.
5DJzp6bMaa	You Get Over it Just as you Would any Other relationship, Time|`|GWRP3vLQaa	You said several times that you were over him and have moved on. But I don't think you are. If your question is how can he forget having a 12-year affair with you, well men often have a way of forgetting things they don't want to think about. <br>  <br>  You may want to get some counseling with your husband to work on repairing your marriage, if that is possible. At least that might help you move on from your affair and start to put things right in your life. good luck.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	its time you took a new lover ..dont you think.. you cant have it both ways but you can have a lover ..|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	I actually did not quit anderstand the explanation <br>  of your affair<br>  but you are an adult it is your choice <br>  to forget or not|`|iD4ejChZaa	cheating for 12 years, how could you live with yourself, 12 years you threw away.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	You have to move on with your life the best that you can. Seeing someone for 12 years is a big part of your life. You can always remember the good times that the two of you had. I had also cheated on my first husband and I had seen the other man for about 13 years. It was a hard thing to do when I cheated on my husband and no way will I ever be that stupid again. The reason I had cheated was because I did not get what I had wanted from my husband. He had mentally abused me for a long time. The reason why I am no longer with the other man is because he passed away in 2002. He broke my heart when he died. I had loved the man with all my heart and I still do love him. I did get divorced before he died and I still remember things about him that made me laugh. I am now remarried again and doing better than I was. My husband has no idea about my life. If he knew then he would not trust me again. There is no way that I will ever sneak around again and lie about it. If your not happy in your marriage then get divorced if you can. It is not easy loving a man when your married to another. I couldn't stand my ex. Hopefully you'll get your life together and get out of your marriage. I can understand what it's like to be in an unhappy marriage and then cheat. I never one time thought that I would ever cheat on anyone.|`|WrlD4xn6aa	wow. so what's the point of this post. te tell us you got away with cheating for 12 years. congrads on that one.<br>  you should talk your husband, make him go to the Dr's and get he;s thing working or figure why he is not doing you. <br>  if he refuses, leave him instead of sleeping aroun|`|BItkg1f0aa	Ok. Explain why you got married now? Oh wait...for money, riiiight. He looked at you as a booty call. He has no feelings for you. Now go find a new pool boy for you to screw. And make sure your husband witnesses it this time.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Put one foot in front of the other and walk, walk, walk through the valley of the shadow of death.|`|AA11895524	I agree with lisa m.  You can get over this.  Just take it one day at a time.  Yes it was wrong to have an affair but who am I to judge you.  No one knows what goes on behind closed doors but you.  Just pick yourself up sweetie and hold your head up high.  There are brighter days ahead.|`|Kl9zdMfpaa	I am sorry your hurting and that you let the affair go on for so long. You have to understand that after 12 years the man apparently wasn't serious about having any kind of relationship with you cause if he was he would have asked you to be with him after the first few months. I am sure he has feelings for you but I am not sure that he feels what you feel. Are you still married? And has he ever told you that he loves you? Also have you ever talked about you leaving your husband and being together?|`|c5d438ebf95dccb2481d6bea0e9b19e0aa	MAYBE HE FINALLY REALIZED THAT YOU ALL'S RELATIONSHIP WASN'T GOING ANYWHERE. <br>  Yes, it was wrong to have an affair. Maybe you should had took those 12 years and worked on your marriage. If you didn't want to there is a way out by telling your husband that you want a divorce. I'm not saying this is right to get a divorce. I'm just saying that you should had given your own relationship a chance instead of finding a new one while you were married. <br>  Why do people do this? <br>  What makes you think that he isn't going to do the same thing to you?<br>  And how could someone trust you and start a new relationship with you based on honesty when you couldn't be honest with your first husband?|`|dTaGzh6Haa	Life throws us all kinds of hard balls, doesn't it? Sorry you're hurting so bad.<br>  Here are a few things to remember that might ease the pain a little:<br>  If you really really love this man then you want, above all, for him to be happy, right? Sometimes we have to let them go...for that reason. <br>  I also think that when a person finds "the ONE" they have the greatest desire to present with their very best. This is all the more heart breaking because of the way in which you have presented yourself. Somewhere in the back of this man's mind he wonders about your self respect, honor, and dignity. I'm sure you're wondering about yourself right now, too. But don't beat yourself up too bad...none of us have a right to throw stones at you. This is all fixable.  <br>  Go in the bathroom right now and take a shower, wash your face, and dry your tears. Look in the mirror and swear to yourself that from this moment on you are going to treat yourself like royalty. Re invent yourself so to speak.<br>  Know that you are capable of love. Many people aren't. Know that this is a valuable life lesson that has taught you something fantastic for who is waiting right around the corner. <br>  Is there any love left for your husband? Or do you need to let go of more things to make it right? Get to work girlfriend, it's going to be all right.|`|wJZAwxrpaa	And they say what comes around goes around i guess it's true you're living proof you cheated on your husband now this one treats you like crap and you really love him but he don't give a rats *** about you thanks for sharing.To all you cheaters let this be a lesson to all of you,Cheaters never win in the end.

It's hard to think about yourself because your daughter will always be more important but there are some questions you need to ask yourself: do you love him? are you willing to accept him the way he is right not? are willing to give up your dreams when you have the change to make them come true? is he a good father for your daughter? it's a very important decision, don't forget that you have to see what is best for your daughter and you...|`|zGZe0mt8aa	your question is really difficult to answer all i can tell you is to do what is in your mind , if you think that can help you.|`|iNvGnl0Xaa	If you have talked to him and can't compromise then it sounds like the thing you want to do.|`|qySznFXaaa	Here is the best answer to your question.<br>  <br>  You are still young.

Pretty soon your daughter will grow up and have the same  at home mentality as your bf.  You dont want that.  Parents want there children to have things that they didnt!!!.  So Take her around the world with you.  Dump wii boy.  You will meet that inspirational person. I promise!!!  I have traveled around the world and seen many cool things that arent here in the states, I have met many cool people, and experienced cultures that were so inspirational to me.

I understand that you have a daughter and you might love your partner for the fact that you share more than a 'common interest' (which you obviously dont have). But you have to live YOUR life. you cant live your life through your daughter... yes you do everything for her. but do you want to live the rest of your life knowing there was so much more to explore. Your daughter may not understand now, and in her pre-teen years she may say some pretty hurtful things to you about this subject. but when she comes of age she will understand the choice you made. Althought, yes, you would give your child the world, you also have to think that you are still young and have your own life to live. take your daughter with you, travel the world.. she will be thankful when she comes of age and realizes you've given her experiences that not alot of children have. places to see that she will be more than thankfull for you showing to her.  Relationships can not be based on a child. She will ahve her own life to lead one day... and yes a father figure is important in her life so make sure contact is not lost. and that visits stay constant and holidays are shared. She wont be happy listening to mommy and daddy arguing thats for sure... which is what will happen. Someday, you'll realize that you made the right choice no matter what it might be, (your her mother and what you do for her is always the best) who are we to tell you what to do. But you're young and still have a long life to live, maybe you'll find someone who shares your interests and loves your daughter also..<br>  <br>  ***BUT(i think this is the BEST SOLUTION)... there is also a way to keep your relationship with your partner and have trips round the world.... have you ever considered a career change? A simple change to a Travel Agency... even a local one... they are constantly aranging trips and cruses many of which a person from the agency must accompany their clients... this is a sure fire way to travel and keep the peace at home.<br>  <br>  a close family member of mine previously worked for one.. you get to go for free, you get discounts on trips, and in some cases one extra ticket for the person of your choice... and who knows if its a couple's cruise you can find a babysitter and it might spark up the romance a little bit. He might be okay with the idea of knowing that trips are less expensive and he'll be in the comfort of his own room while other vacationers do their thing... He's probably the more layed back type.. to be catered to... not to be going around site seeing taking pictures... this way you have the best of both worlds... some trips you can take alone... other private vacation spots you can involve him. ( my partner is the same way so im speaking from experience... he rather be layed back instead of rushing around like a busy body, seeing new things and going to tourist attractions... ) some people just dont like that... thats why that might just be the perfect oppertunity for you to get away sometimes.. or take him for the more calm lay back relax vaca's<br>  <br>  (or theres always going back to school for a degree in which you can get a job to afford to take him with you and he can have the luxuries of x-box, wii, movies and room service awaiting for him at your destination)<br>  <br>  best of luck to you. hope i helped a little
bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	In my opinion you didn't insult her.......you stepped on her toes  (where your brother is concerned) and sometimes the truth hurts.  I would not offer any apology. It sounds like your brother has several problems. The more you bring them to light to your mom the better. He needs help but as long as your mom is supporting him and his habits he will never get the help he needs.|`|wGw834Gkaa	H3ll no.  This guy is a loser, your mom just doesn't want to face it.  Reality is as it is, her hiding her head in the sand doesn't make your brother a saint, it just makes your mom look even more silly to the world.  Remember the story about the emperor and his new clothes?|`|jBxW6ee9aa	I think maybe you should apologize... but you should let her know that your hubby, is YOUR hubby and he has a job!! She was wrong for being insulted by such a minor thing! It seems to me, that your mom is the one with a problem, if she can't except the fact that you have a life and it doesn't revolve around your kid brother. I would still apologize because that is just the kind of person I am, but I would also let her know that my life is just that, my life. By the way, I have never had this kind of problem because I am only 18, but still I hope this helps.|`|e6988558ce99ec66bb677335e270a037aa	Hell no! I totally understand having a voice and not being heard and I can not understand why some people pacify the ones that need the most help. Moms sometimes are the worst at seeing the truth even if it slapped them in the face. I would just distance my self and let it all blow over. One day she will wake up and realize you were right and she'll be the one apologizing. That may be tomorrow or ten years from now but until then I'd just try your dangest to bite your tongue and not have your baby around that.|`|NwNBswpuaa	sounds like she has  a personal problem and isn't living in reality.|`|ct300nsOaa	No you shouldn't that's not right that someone as 22 years old still gets babied by his mom you should show her that if she keeps this up who knows where he will end up and you should tell your brother that his mom won't always be there and what is he going to do when that day comes
VnRECJJxaa	maybe he just wanted to be the one to pop the question, he probably always figured when he got engaged he would be the one to ask, perhaps you accidentally did something that he always thought he would be the one to do|`|BMEMH7JLaa	At least he gave you a honest answer|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	if you have been together 5 years i dont think you are rushing at all.

Clearly you are and he knows that. I was with my bf for 7 years (2 kids) and we just got married like 5 months ago. I also never cared about anything fancy, a ring, the wedding etc.. SO, if you really don't care..then why are you picking at it all so much? Don't pretend you're laid back about it and then freak out.. That's when guys leave..|`|i15KoiJhaa	5 Years together  A 3 year old Son together  Been living together for 4 1/2 years    AND he needs to think about it?    Honey, I am starting to think that there is never going to be "Right time" for this guy...    In all honesty shouldn't the question for Financial stability been asked prior to having a Child together?    I have some Friends like this... he is always making excuses about needing more money before he gets married to her... they have been together 5 years, have 3 Kiddo's between the 2 of them, live together....     At some point and I'm thinking it should've been before NOW, your Boyfriend needs to get in or get out. The Son the 2 of you share will always bind you together (sometimes that is good when it works and sometimes it is very painful when you're shuffling him from your house to his house when things don't work out)    Time for your Boyfriend to give you the commitment.|`|VmQBhY6iaa	I don't understand why he said 'he needs to think about it', I mean u guys have a kid together been together for 5 years! and he's 29,he should be thinking of settling down,not that he hasn't but I mean kind of more serious,right? I don't think u ask too fast,and I think was extremely cool that u ask! I popped the question too :D Also,don't give him ultimatum apparently he's comfortable by not being marry yet,and maybe,just maybe, if u give him an ultimatum he may back off,let him know that u don't need a big ring or wedding and make him feel that way too,hopefully he'll change his mind and u'll be planning a wedding soon! Good luck!|`|LLeQyWGcaa	there was nothing wrong with asking him to marry you. like you said, you weren't going to know unless you asked.

You have been living together for years now. You have a child. You share a house and a bed. Sounds to me like he FEELS married already!     What could possibly motivate him to go ahead and make things official? Nothing....He already has all the good things marriage can offer...!    This is precisely why you shouldn't have kids if you are not married...!    How will you be able to tell your son to not do the same thing in the future? Actions speak louder than words.    Don't hold your breath and expect him to marry you. I don't think he will. Sorry.|`|XXZFf1AYaa	My opinion: You did ask too soon, and maybe shouldn't have asked at all. If he's going to be stringing you along and making excuses, and always saying but not showing that he wants the same things as you, he may not be who you think he is.|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	You guys already have a 3 year old and have been together for five years now...

Everyone is different thought when it comes to having enough of an unfaithful mate.|`|71VRvldJaa	Everyone has their own reasons why they are in a relationship and love is not always the reason.  Some women get in a relationship for financial security, some for the prestige or status the relationship offers them etc.  In situations like that, where most likely sex and intimacy don't play a huge role, the wife/partner could possibly be relieved if the spouse looks elsewhere for sexual gratification.  Other women choose to live in denial....that if they don't acknowledge it, it isn't happening and it will go away.  Others might be involved in a relationship themselves and having their partner/spouse preoccupied with his/her own affair, leaves the path clear for them to enjoy their own extra curricular activities.  Some couples stick together for the sake of the children but choose to live separate lives and just share space under the same room.  Whatever their reason is.....it's usually not healthy for either one of them.|`|3y8YIs3raa	they need some one and doint want to leave their partner as this would mean they would be alone :]|`|AcmfbJVpaa	conviniance|`|r1fb8t25aa	there probably at it too|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	Some people feel they have too much to lose.

I hate to admit this, but yeah, that was funny....although sooooo wrong!    The worst thing I ever did was, when I found out that a guy I was seeing was not only cheating on me, but doing it with SEVERAL other people, I changed the voice mail on his phone to say (I can't remember the exact wording, but something like this) "Hi, you have reached Aaron's phone.  He can't come to the phone right now, because he's busy boinking (not the word I used, but you get it) half of our town.  If you are looking for him, he is probably with one of the following people: (and listed off all the other girls names).  If he isn't there, then check at the local clinic, because there's a good chance his dick will be falling off soon.

LMAO|`|VUvfWG7Eaa	Thats a good one but I have you beat, when my second ex beech walked out she cleaned my savings, sold my boats, sold my plane and never looked back, she forgot that she was living in my house, in the divorce she was awarded the land but the house was mine, leave it to our legal system, her and the boy friend went to the Bahamas for a little gloating at her success, while they were gone I moved the house 200 yds to the west and set it back  down on a new foundation,  as you probably guessed, I was in construction at the time, when she came home, she freaked and decided to enter the home in its new location, as the two of them proceeded to break everything in site, and take what ever they wanted, I watched and laughed while the security cameras filmed every move she made, just as they were finish there little escapade thinking that nobody would ever know who it was, the sheriff rolled in to greet them, that did wonders for there careers, she was a state employee, criminal counselor, and he was an attorney, she lost her job, and he was dis barred and they both did jail time and had to pay restitution for all damages.

0XXM4U5Zaa	I think cost should have little to do with it. You should find the style ring that she would like. Something that would fit her personality and compliment her hand. Something that has a classic look is always a good bet, as this IS the one item she is going to wear (hopefully) for the rest of her life.  My husband spent $200 on my wedding ring. It's a couple's band. It suits my personality, looks good on my hand, and I LOVE it. My Ex husband spent $1500 on my rings. I hated them. They were big and tacky and didn't suit me at all.   Look at options at stores. Get nosy...ask her friends if she's been looking at ring photos. Ask her mother/sister/best friend etc. if she's ever mentioned what kind of ring she would like. Look at other jewelry she has purchased to see if there's a common style. Oh, and if she has a ring that she wears on that finger....trace the inside of it on a paper and take it with you when you shop. You can have the jeweler get the size from it.|`|YMff2MIoaa	1 to 2 pay checks or the best you can afford, i mean it my bf could afford it than ya but if he was in a slump than just w/e they can|`|h7xh61TWaa	You can get a fine ring for $1000. Like the poster above, I planned on $2000 but just watch sales and got the one I was watching for $1500... that same $1500 was still around $1770 after taxes, sizing, and insurance and all that good stuff.    A good 1-ct Solitare can easily run between $2000 and $5000 depending on where and who you go to.|`|zaSyEcnqaa	Whatever you can afford with out going into debt or financing your life away.

What can you afford with out stressing yourself?|`|AsFiWxhUaa	it is not the cost that matters it is the cut, size, and clarity....lol jk!  it all depends on what you want and how big you want it. when you are buying the ring just ask yourself if she will like it and if what you are spending on a ring is going to cause yall to start yalls marriage in a great deal of debt.|`|sGP6s7uraa	What you can afford.  Two months salary is what I always heard but do what you can do.|`|TNH8QMOaaa	Well, its your own personal choice.

The two months' salary rule is garbage. Personally, I'd say spend the amount equal to one paycheck -- and that's NET, not GROSS.    You may also discover, over time, that the success of many people's marriages is inversely proportional to the amount of money they spent on the rings.|`|JPXgLx6waa	Spent 500k on mine. I love my wife a lot.  But it isn't the price that matters, it's if you love her and truly want to marry her.  Spend accordingly with your status. If you can afford, get her something really expensive, but if you can't get something a little cheaper and save for more important things like a house.|`|BObu4i9saa	the money has nothing to do with it   start asking her friends what she likes keep an eye on her when there are rings around  she's going to care more about what it looks like (she is going to wear it every day after all) then how much it costs (unless she's really shallow)  once you have that down you can look around and figure out what rings fit her style and your general budget    my best friend got exactly what she wanted and her fiance spent $700  I got exactly what I wanted and my fiance spent $1700  it's not about the money to most of us - it's about the ring!|`|V6uezBBcaa	My fiance got my ring off of Ebay for $400. Its a 1.5 carot. Clarity is flawless, color is flawless.. Yes, its a real ring, it appraises over $3500. We got it appraised right after he bought it to make sure were not getting ripped off. It's the most beautiful ring I have ever seen, it's perfect... I get butterflys whenever I see it, and so should your gf. That ring should be a sybol of how much you love her not how much debt you are in!|`|vWEu8GxNaa	What ever the ring that you BOTH decide on costs!  There should be no "right" price - just the right ring for you both. xx|`|ge3meKYEaa	How much should you spend on a house- only you know.....    What does she want?

bID1Pd7Gaa	The best gift my wife could give me is just being with me. I mean spending time together, no friends, no kids, no family. That is my suggestion.|`|IOXJdCvSaa	You're not married to him yet so buy him a gift lol.    Buy him his favorite NFL teams jersey customized with his name on the back and put 1 as the number    and then give him some good lovin that nite :D    that would be the perfect vday gift a girl to give me    so if ur man doesent like the jersey fedex a steelers jersey to me wit the number 13 on it lol jk    Take care|`|wWL934E8aa	When I was newly wed, 18 years ago, we decided no cards or gifts.  Well, I decided to surprise him with a little something.  I made out coupons and gave them to him to redeem.  Some, use your imagination, others were cute like:  1 day of no nagging (he has yet to redeem that one!)  1 day of going where you want.      stuff like that.  You can think of things he would like.  Even if you buy a gift, add some coupons for fun!
FO5KQzf0aa	plentyoffish.com  freedating.com (or uk i cant remember)    theres so many. just go onto google and tap in dating sites.    In my opinion, If he is cheating, he wouldnt pay for the sites as it would come through on the bill. so possibly type in free dating websites. hope this helps|`|UaSb84BOaa	I'm not too familiar with all the sites out there, but my girlfriend just told me about plentyoffish.com. She swears by it and it's a little more 'hands on' than eharmony or match. Another one is chemistry.com.   My ex-husband frequented a site called adultfriendfinder.com. This was how he cheated. It is an adult site, mostly geared toward cheaters.

4WXK187vaa	Enquirer,    Place yourself in your boyfriends shoes for a minute. yes, it hurts...and bad.     Make a correction...instead of excuses begin by having an adult conversation with your parents about him.    Acknowledge what they feel first...'Mom, Dad, I know you want the best for me".    Then tell them about how your feel about your boyfriend and why you are together.    What you are choosing to do is done by people that are codependents. People pleasers...yet you ended up hurting your boyfriend because you chose sides.    There is no need to chose sides when you are in love with someone. I can only hope that aside from the excuses, you did say you are sorry to your boyfriend?    Create opportunities to introduce him to your friends, co-workers (if any) and family. But first speak to your parents and then invite him over for coffee or tea when they are home.     Your parents will learn to respect you as a mature grown- up when they see the 'change' is in you.    Good Luck, Mystified|`|QMhl2DGQaa	if you still fancy him them go out and talk about the situation    iwood|`|LbfwxW3yaa	if you've been together for 2 years, he should understand you, but you still need to apoligise and tell your parents infront of him that you're going to carry on going out with him no matter what they think and that they can accept you two b eing together or risk loosing you|`|HZuLVEEsaa	At this point i think the only thing you can do to put it right with your bf is to say to your parents and everyone else, that he is your bf and that they can basically like it or lump it. Whether you want to do this or not depends on who means more to you i guess.|`|lz4IIIGzaa	I hate to say this, but ask your parents *why* they don't like him.    Try not to get defensive when they tell you, or fly off the handle - everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion.    Looking back at the advice my parents gave to me, they were Always right, even though I often couldn't see it at the time.    Your parents will also respect you for asking them, and even more if you offer them a constructive reply, rather than an argument - you never know, you might win them over.|`|njbmOlJSaa	you shoudl've introduced him as your boyfriend..if you love him very much..trust me your parents would get over it.|`|BcrYBSJmaa	You have to consider your parents only want what's best for you, but look at closely at their reasons for disliking him, and if you really don't agree with them, explain to your parents that you love him and try to tell them why their reasons are wrong (whilst avoiding huge conflict), you need to remember that you have been with this boy for 2 years, you love him, and he's given you no justification for treating him badly, or has he?|`|Hwh7Brq9aa	If your living with your parents and your under 16 tehn he needs to realise that its not you being nasty its just the fact that you cant afford to be upseting your parents over it because they are the two people in the world who can actually (try) and make you split up and obvs cus ur under 16 you have to obligate and do so.     Other wise if your older then 16 then i think you need to grow a pair and stop being so silly. your parents oppinion dosent really matter.     You have made it look like your ashamed of him and thats probably wots hurt him the most, you need to talk to him and descuse why you did this and how you can make it up to him.     if your over 16 you need to stop feeling like you have to make every one happy especially your parents and just go with your feeling for your bf and just make your self happy. your parents will learn to live with it.|`|wHDxWWhraa	ok tell him y did u do that...and he'll understand that....but you must face your family and introduce the real him to them...who told you that all married people were accepted at this stage from parents !!  and tell him about your new decesion and he'll appreciate it...and it would stress on you for little but in the end you must do what you want...and your vision in him what must be taken into consederation not your parents orr any other !|`|lDXAA9FKaa	i think he has the right to be upset, youve been with him for two years and you didnt have the balls to introduce him infront of people as your boyfriend. he probably thinks your ashamed to be with him by doing that.    sort out what you want. if you love this guy stay with him and have a proper relationship and dont listen to your family.|`|x5GH9A9Gaa	You need to ask yourself first what is the future of your relationship?  If it is not going to be possible to pursue your relationship in public how long will you carry on like this?  And the longer it carrys on the worse it will get.  If your parents views are really important to you then you need to finish this for good (even though it is difficult . But that is what its going to be at the end then why carry on?)  and if you want to be with him then he has a right to be identified as your bf in public and for that you need to find some guts to approach your parents and talk about it! All the best!|`|nr1Bt47baa	Someone will have to be hurt. Tell your parents you think he is the right guy for you and tell him you are sorry, you realize it was a mistake and that you did it to please your family. Two things should happen, your parents will accept it and he will forgive you. Good luck.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Well I hope he is your friend as well as your boyfriend, I dont understand why you feel so bad about this and why everyone is making such a big deal. If he is very hurt as you say then he sounds like an immature kid and I feel sorry for you.|`|6zVISNTZaa	If you've been together 2 years, I think your parents are going to have to accept it. it's not fair to bend it and pretend he's your "friend" when you've been together for so long. If you keep doing it, it'll just escalate eg. "Mum, i'm pregnant" "Who by?" "My er...friend"...|`|7mhqRhJKaa	How old are you?    At some point you and your parents have to realise that YOU have to live YOUR life.    If you are certain that you love him and that he is the right person for you, tell them, firmly and politely without any animosity, that he is the man you have chosen, and that you will accept the consequences of that decision yourself, so can they please let go of their little girl.|`|HUhheZWtaa	Tell him y you did that. If he loved you he should understand but its your life so you should be able to make your own decisions i also think you should talk to him.    Hope i helped    Good luck!

Be happy with what you got, don't be clingy or needed.  My boyfriend is very insecure and it is driving me away.|`|jVFSIeipaa	I really hate to answer a question with my own personal experience but i have to tell you that i have felt the same way and from time to time i still feel like that, i know that the way i feel has to do with previous situations in my relationship that have led me to feel this way, today everything is perfect but i cant help to feel insecure at times, if your boyfriend has an easy going understanding personality or side, my advice to you is to sit down and talk to him, dont hold your feelings if you have to cry you cry, tell him how you feel do not hesitate, this will help you a lot, his reassurance will make a difference in how you feel, i used to be angry and mad like a lunatic for no apparent reason, until i told my bf, he was more than happy to work with me on this issue, today i feel a lot better, i have the ability to block negative feelings and thoughts about the past, i feel more secure about everything and there are days i dont need reassurance because i know how he feels about me and where we are heading, turst me my situation at the beginning was not easy, and im talking about cheating to emotional breakdowns on his end, it was bad, bad bad, he moved out 3 times, we didnt speak for weeks and one day everything fell into place, we hardy talk about it and we are working towards our future, marriage, rising our kid, so bottom line, communication is the key..good luck to you.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	I have the same problem, in fact I was dealing with this just this week.  I get paranoid that he'll start pursuing someone else.  My first marriage ended because of infidelity, so I'm probably going to be dealing with that paranoia all my life.  But I just talk myself through it.  Is there any reason he's given me to doubt him?  If so, I need to discuss it with him.  If not, I need to chill out.  Usually just taking some deep breaths and looking at things purely from reality, and trusting your gut rather than your fears, that will help.|`|hNRF5agXaa	I'm in the SAME situation. You just have everything going so well that you think something bad will happen. What i do is music. haha The spill canvas is amazing but kinda keeps you down.

My daughter is like this and she usually finds a way to make her own fears come true.  Get yourself into some counselling to find out why you feel this way before you sabotage your future.  Did something traumatic happen in your past that subconsciously you feel guilty about?  He honest with yourself and with your counselor or it won't do you any good.

I would survive right? Ok then, if I know I would be okay if this all ended, then I don't have to worry about it ending all of the time. Ask yourself that question, and if you come to the conclusion that I did, then just enjoy what you have now without further obsessing about bad things happening. If you don't think you would survive, then you may want to get with a therapist to help you work through your issues.|`|AA10904025	Personally I'm all about the back-up system. Whenever I can, I call my BFF and have her counter all my insecurities. At the time it doesn't seem like it works right away, but she is telling me what I should be thinking, she's distracting me from making a bad decision and giving me time to calm. Try talking to someone or even taking the time to write your insecurities down in a journal which you can later counter for yourself.|`|lDXAA9FKaa	its good to know im not alone when i have my irrational fears.     you just have to keep remembering yourself that everythings fine i suppose. just take things as they come cause if you keep worrying about you might see it slip away without even noticing it.    thats what im trying to think about to try to stop me from worrying|`|gZO8tpiYaa	try positive thinking i no its easier to say then do  but negative thinking  bring u closer to the things u wish to avoid.  lots of my friends keep a blog where u can receive feedback from readers, may help to release the fears you have and put them into perspective.
kE2n7HXcaa	Here's the hard truth - guys ALSO don't like to play the game the way you've set it up - having your friends let him know you like him, give him your number, etc.  If he -did- like you, that would be a turn-off.  Chances are, he hasn't called because he's not into you as much as you think.      Plus, guys like to fish.  Fishing is a challenge.  We like to bait the hook, wait, and get a big one out because of our skill.We wouldn't like fishing as much if we just walked up to a lake and there were fifty fish flopping up on shore.   By giving him your number and sending your friends to do this dirty work, you've eliminated the challenge.  You want to be the type of girl that needs to be won, not the type that is begging to be liked.|`|b9ff940610f4c3ac65317b30bae44184aa	Give him your number yourself. Maybe he doesn't want to call because he doesn't know you know he has your number.      And please, throw in some capital letters. They don't cost anything.|`|wrrY9VbKaa	are you certain he likes you?  maybe that's not why he's calling.    and maybe he's waiting for you to call.  just text him, see whats up.    grow some balls ;D|`|UfgLRgOxaa	well u know guys have alot of pride maybe u should give him a surprise call...ha ha

I really do love him a ton. He's funny, cute, affectionate, teasing, has a GREAT voice (not singing necessarily...it's just very soothing and smooth), is an amazing kisser, and makes me feel very lucky all the time (which I am...I don't know how I got him all to myself, lol). He makes everyday better, and knows me inside and out better than anyone else. He's too good for me, really. He just does EVERYTHING right, lol, it's not fair!

MuflptJVaa	hormones.If you think this then don't let it be so!Its like stage fright.|`|OlivXMYmaa	no actually its a normal thing... when you re talkin to someone its better to look at him than to look away mabe hes interested in your conversation..or maby he admires your face...|`|QNoZjy9qaa	No, it's not weird and you're not the only one. It's just different for all of us. Some people do it because like u said "they don't know what to do with themselves" Others do it because that's just the way they look at others when spoken to. Some people do it because they might be nervous around the other. And yes, some do it because they wanna find something bad/good on others. I can't speak for everyone but i'm human so i know a thing or two about how we act around others.

I'm not sure you know what the word "infatuation" means.  I am "infatuated" with certain female movie stars but I only love my wife.    Hope this answers your question.|`|K3ZYWBr4aa	If I love the person im with I try to not let myself become infatuated with anyone|`|GWmkKF5jaa	ALLLLL the time!    Men I dislike constantly approach me and hassle me.  Its part of being a Asian girl in America.    This makes me look like a slut and the men I really like avoid me.|`|6zVISNTZaa	I believe it happens to most people at least once, it's a case of wondering if the grass is greener on the other side. Usually it is not. And it is not follow up these thoughts. Try and avoid the person you're infatuated with, although, this can be difficult if they're a friend or colleague, but don't make excuses to talk to them unnecessarily, and try to remember why you're with the person you're in a relationship with, and all the little things you like about them and forget the other person, and your infatuation should die out.|`|9xgGd9praa	Whenever I'm with someone, I can't help but think of someone else, so I dump the person I was with, then realize I don't want the other person at all, and I just ruined an alright relationship.  I don't get why it happens.|`|7sxGW40qaa	Yeah I have, and don't worry about it, you will either get over or go for the other person.  But either way something happens because of that person.  It all depends on how you handle it.|`|ysexlf9baa	yes as much as i hate to admit it|`|QSmvZ6fMaa	yes|`|E5n8tRKoaa	yeah i have. as long as it doesnt interfere with the relationship, it should be okay and fairly normal. now, if the person you like is Animal from the muppets, i think that could pose as a problem.|`|lZNU8tMcaa	Yep.  But I just keep it as it is-an infatuation.|`|G3DY39luaa	yes! always!|`|Hwh7Brq9aa	If your infatuated with some one else then maby your bf isnt the person for you. unless its a celeb then maby you should just try an calm your adiction down.

U6rCN4R8aa	all day errday.  it makes for better post-sex.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Depends on what kind of "vibe" they give off.  Yes, I have gone on dates with them.  I don't think it's only men who approach strangers either.  I have done it lots of times, and made lots of friends that way.|`|RJY6aRQ9aa	Never gone on a date with them but I have chatted with them. I normally try to confuse the hell out of them and if they laugh then I feel more comfortable around them, if they just look at me as if I'm completely insane well, it normally ends there.|`|KXmcx8sRaa	no im not comfortable with strangers coming up to me.

My only issue is when it is quite apparent that they are MUCH older than me.|`|9iXGakohaa	It depends on the situation. It can be a bit uncomfortable and awkward, and I have never personally gone on a date with a stranger I met out and about. I know someone who has though, and they are perfectly happy together!|`|GWmkKF5jaa	It all depends on the guy.    The popular media plays a key role.  If the guy looks like a TV/movie character, then he is welcomed.    Basically if he "looks" like what our minds have been programmed to find attractive, then he can pretty much have his way with us.    If he does NOT resemble what we are programmed to find attractive. Such as race, height, nose features, accent etc... then our female instincts automatically reject the male.    So simply compare yourself with the media hotties.  Do you resemble any of them?    The difference is huge!  We will call one a dream man, the other a stalker.|`|Q33dbzAdaa	if men didnt approach women, humans would go extinct.|`|aYoscopKaa	yeah I think it's ok. If they're friendly in a busy street for example its alright, Just depends on the situation really.|`|38OLrY0Zaa	At times. If you're the kind of guy who stares for hours, not so much. If I've seen you a few times, and we've noticed each other, but are still strangers, then what are you waiting for?

When my husband and I had two cars we didn't think his car/her car. We just hopped in a car.|`|wp5TjXT4aa	He should agree to let you have the new one if it is a van. As long as it is safe for the kids! if it's about driving the kids around and you need something safe, you should be driving a big old van. maybe like a 1985 model!|`|BE2vknbHaa	You guys can easily take turns with the new car and avoid senseless arguments.|`|8ilHQMq5aa	he should get the car. <br>  you got the last upgrade.|`|R5SGjlCyaa	yes you do sound like a spoilt brat!
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	because people are only human, the only thing wrong is falling in love with the wrong person.there is no right or wrong time, or place, its the person u choose to love that causes it to be wrong.|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	I personally do not believe in coincidence...everything is Divine timing. Whether we are in a place to accept that or not may define our need to judge what we are doing and feeling as 'wrong'....trust that Love is never wrong. Destiny will carry you to wonderful places if you are willing to open your mind and look outside of this box of space and time..Love knows no limitations...Ahhhh sweet love!     To answer your question, simply....I can not.|`|svg71dazaa	It's called life and we living it and sometimes we make mistakes but that is OK as how would you know otherwise. We learn from mistakes.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	baby, if fallling in love is wrong, i don't wanna be right.|`|tClYrQ1vaa	well things happen weather its the wrong person thats up to the two people who "love each other" as for the place well maybe your just looking in all the wrong places and you should stop trying to find love and let love find you.|`|LMIbr1aeaa	When you are not so pretty and attractive, us people don't stand a chance but go with fate. As long as at least one spouse is fully happy and content. YOu can't always get what you want from life. You only get the box of chocolates and thats it. Enjoy what you got and make the best of it. Just listen and understand. That's what life is all about. GL|`|GeruGGOQaa	Because love is an emotion and not a logical process.|`|yy45iAbtaa	mostly because they are just coming out of a bad relationship and are on the rebound.|`|xHxi9p0Vaa	Sometimes all of these "wrong" things you mention, only seen wrong if you choose to look at it that way. There is always a way to put a spin on things to make them seem right.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Primarily because people don't "date" anymore and they rush into the intimate side of a relationship.  Once you give into the lust / attraction stage of a relationship your logic (this guy is bad for me, he has no job, he is controlling, he is a drug user) tends to be trumped by your emotion (he makes me feel good, OMG sex is so good etc.)  The problem is your emotional side can't sustain a relationship long term and it the practical / logical thinking that does.
S852p6SXaa	i really dont see the point why a guy would hook up with a girl they dont find appealing to them. that would just be wasting their time and the other girls time.  so what if is friends were watching, that doesn't mean he has to make out with the girl not unless they made some sort of bet. Guys are more visually then us, their brain decides what is more attractive and what is not but many guys have their own tastes in woman. what other men may  not find so attractive their are others who do.|`|mCQx7Co5aa	they'll only kis the hot one, becasue they wanna look cool!|`|f8VUgchtaa	would you snog an ugly guy cause your friends were watching??!|`|P7D1bsQaaa	She would have to be not.|`|tYO2Ir1oaa	teenage boys can be cruuuel|`|rLw3ThKmaa	Like britney, said.<br>  <br>  eg.<br>  <br>  Pandora of skins is hot imo.. Most guys think differently|`|5e8d9d565c4a1b022e1a499cb8fb71f8aa	A guy would not snog an ugly girl in front of his mates.....unless it was for a bet......or if he was drunk....or didn't give a dam....so maybe the answer's yes??|`|AA12091265	no if he really likes her then he will do it|`|zGgUsEmdaa	Definitely hot, teenage boys are harsh sometimes. x
zRvt68ZYaa	This position is awesome!  Try letting him do control your back and forth movements with his hands on your hips while you relax and push your boobs into his face.  Absolutely wonderful....|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	My hubby likes the reverse cowgirl - just sit on him facing away from him instead of towards him.    I also like to sit upright instead of laying down, and put my legs up next to me.  (Think of like a squatting postion)  That way, I can move around better, and you get better leverage by using your feet that way. Plus, you can move up and down on him and not just be moving around.  I like to move my hips in a circular motion rather than back and forth, but thats just me.    This is what works for my hubby and I, but every couple has to find their own "rhythm" and what works for them.  Hope this helps!|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	Try practicing without him to build up muscle strength. Just sit on the floor in that position and do repetitions. You will build strength and endurance. And you will enjoy the benefits.|`|vFCva8R5aa	I know exactly what you mean. The best way i have learned that has helped me is for him to sit in like a kitchen chair (with no sides/armrests) and you can straddle him. That way your knees are not bent like they are if he is laying on the bed. and you can have both feet on the floor for support.|`|svg71dazaa	This might sound dumb but shake your hips as if you are dancing to a sexy song. Move your hips round and side-ways and this will make him happy. Or really pretend you riding a horse. Hope that works.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Don't worry its a common problem at first. My friends mom told us one times the best sex is on the couch. Just climb on top while on the couch and its pretty good sex. It seems to hit your spots easier so you will get the rhythm alot easier.|`|C4bxnKDXaa	you should both be working...even in that position|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	try putting some music on that you can use to move with the rhythm, i lvoe this position make sure your good and lubed up to! i liek my hubby to be slightly elevated wit hpillows and then its away we go|`|yy45iAbtaa	you need to work out on your legs.your legs are getting tierd because you have no strength in them do some squats.or try some Pilate's get the tapes that will strengthen your legs or join a gym.|`|GeruGGOQaa	Take some horse back riding lessons.  Then go home and practice horse back riding with your husband.  Problem solved.  Trust me there is nothing like a woman on top that is a seasoned horse rider.  Giddy up!|`|xHxi9p0Vaa	How are you moving once you are up there? are you bouncing up and down, or are you more or less rubbing forwards and backwards? Sometimes, even if you are not overweight, stamina can be the issue. Do you get winded after about 3-5 minutes of doing this? If so, you should/could alternate positions. If he seems to take FOREVER to "finish", you could switch between oral, and riding him, and then back to oral when your hips/legs get tired, and then pick it back up again after a few minutes of that. Try it.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	Thank you for this question and Nikki for answering it. My husband and my kitchen chairs are going to get a workout!|`|RAGAcJV7aa	try other positions . you on top not facing him doggie sideways . you bent over a cough or better yet go to book store and buy the art of making love.|`|3Y2jRkxcaa	lean over him and put your weight on your hands. just put it in and sit on it sort of.|`|7edl5u1oaa	I agree with Nikki or if you're on the bed maybe he can prop up on a pillow!|`|VmQBhY6iaa	Getting the rythym going isn't about just doing it fast.Change speeds.Try going fast then when ur getting tired do it slow so u can rest and get more energy to keep going,tell him(nice and naughty) things in the ear so he gets excited and maybe 'come faster'(sorry) so u'll be done sooner,lol. Mens like this position a lot,I personally love it too,cuz I'm in control,and I love to have control!!!|`|RtmfVevbaa	Sounds like you are out of shape to me! He can help you a bit by putting his hands in a supportive position, under your buttocks, and also he can thrust upwards, making it easier on you! If that does not work go to the gym and work on your squats, so you can build some much needed stamina!!!!|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	i would have him in the sitting position instead of laying flat on his back.  While he's sitting and you're on top it is easier to move your body back and forth instead of up and down.  You knee will not get tired and both will have much more pleasure fun.  Hopefully this will work for you.|`|wfMC742Naa	Yeah, it can be a tiring position.  What I do is have my husband put his hands on my hips and help me keep the rhythm going.  That way I'm not doing all of the work.  It makes it MUCH easier for me, and it isn't very much work for him.  Sometimes having him sit up instead of lying down works better too!    Good luck and have fun!
G3DY39luaa	i dont think she is interested in you she says nice things to make you feel better!  She probalby likes you as a friend!  you should ignore her for awhile and   let her come to you :)|`|WdflTmXtaa	um maybe she just is playing hard to get... Just give it some time...|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	Wait for her to decide. You can't make her go out with you. There is nothing we can do to change her mind.|`|MIiuJzJNaa	well like maybe she doesnt want a relationship right now. of just maybe she doesnt want to go out with a red neck guy|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Ask her why she feels that way?  Maybe she doesn't want a redneck man, idk
54qBK15laa	I am a guy and honey, trust me guys act like that all the time.  Whenever I look at women I try not to stare so I don't look them in the eyes a lot.  It is obvious that he likes u and u should totally ask him out.  He is too shy to ask u out because he likes u too much and he is probably afraid of rejection.  U should ask him out and it seems like he really likes u.|`|ZRS0C1CXaa	Yeah he likes you! That's the best way he can show it without pushing you away.|`|Zqby1cXpaa	It is true I sadly am dreadfully shy an did the same thing to a girl I liked|`|ikL5ZdfAaa	both|`|tpfnIpqbaa	When a guy likes a woman quite a bit he does get shy. especially if he hasn't talked to them very much or hasn't become comfortable around her yet.<br>  <br>  Actually some personal experience I've had is I get random spurts of shyness around a specific girl (whom I'm deathly attracted to)<br>  <br>  I don't know if that helps at all though because the guy obviously isn't me but it could possibly be a universal human trait. :/|`|VvXZFKLLaa	My OWN experience I wasted the majority of my twenties acting that way. . .Yes he likes you and further more HE RESPECTS YOU, which means you have to act wisely to avoid losing that respect "if you desire a relationship" . . .And I don't have any answers for that, but it can be done(smile)|`|uZDe2eM3aa	i think if he is not looking you in the eye and stuff well i think he likes you he probably just isnt looking at you because he might make a fool of himself.|`|AA12091265	that sounds like me I am a VERY SHY Person but when i see a girl i like I GET ALOT MORE SHY so idk|`|BAKuIe1faa	Yes yes yes|`|JQ4lDdZWaa	Yes, he likes you. He's just shy.|`|cw4hEkaaaa	He's Shy,AND he likes you :)|`|j0sGgtbKaa	aw how cute. :D<br>  i seriously think he likes you,<br>  but he's just a shy guy.<br>  :3|`|0pHMnQVVaa	omg sounds like me i have trouble looking somone in the eyes buts its with everyone.anywayz i fink he likes u|`|HZgjUguWaa	YES|`|klZK6UhNaa	For the last time, yes just walk to him and spill it out. <br>  <br>  Life is a dream, dream don't hurt people/
38OLrY0Zaa	You seem shy. I can relate, I am too. Just try talking to him. Get to know him better. Let him get to know you. Most of all, be yourself. If he's ever going to like you, let it be for the real you and not an act. The pains? Hunny, they're probably just nerves. When you seem him, your body reacts in it's own way. Don't worry about it. the more intense it gets, the more nervous you are. You just have to try to keep yourself calm and relaxed. (Blushing helps keep you relaxed AND get his attention.)|`|AA11812015	Just start talking to him and you can pick up on clues as to whether or not he likes you the more you talk to him.|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	Do you believe he's better than you? You must because that's the way you act. Stop selling yourself short.|`|K3ZYWBr4aa	They are called panic attacks. Get use to them because more and more people are having them.|`|mbqAQAJ7aa	ur prob just really afraid of being rejected.  the only way to find out if he likes u back is to talk to him :)|`|6zVISNTZaa	You're having panic attacks, because you're seeing him. It's not healthy to be like this, and even though you can't help your feelings, you could try and focus on something else, and boost your confidence, as its likely you feel like this because you have no confidence in front of him. Try joining a club etc, or maybe you could try talking to him, the more you get used to talking, the less hard it'll be.|`|AA10986891	It is either a panic or ansiety attack.|`|tuEJ8Rv8aa	i think this may be just a case of butterflies! :)  try talking to him, maybe just a simple question, like "can i borrow a pen?" just try getting his attention first, then work your way up to conversation. :)|`|3oiXckLBaa	You might want to pay attention to your breathing when he's around.  I'll bet you pretty much forget to breathe.    Remind yourself to consciously take some (deep) breaths and see if that helps.
U6rCN4R8aa	wutchu talkin bout willis.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Stay away from him!|`|ZkmFoiobaa	move on listen to your friends.

It hurts because he used you. Learn from this and realize that you are more valuable to yourself and others than what he made you feel like.This kind of character will move on to hurt the next gal. Once you have moved on, who's the better? You.|`|Hwh7Brq9aa	move on and stop being a storker. The only option you have is to get over him!!|`|7sxGW40qaa	Hon, getting revenge will not help you any, because then he will just be hurt.

If you rate yourself a four go for guys that are 5 or under.Every guy will try of course for the 5 or higher even if they are 1. Sometimes you have to look at the beauty within if your not an attractive person. But always remember theres someone out there that thinks your a knock out. Doesn't hurt to ask a guy out nowadays. I personally love big boobs and tall women . If they have a nice butt and hips thats a bonus. Lopez booty of course. Guys are intimidated by height. Dont want to get thrown around and feel unmanly in a fun wrestling match|`|9XjtEdEqaa	i cant tell from your description, nobody could. Theres nothing wrong with having more to love. Light skin is fine so is brown eyes. where are your beauty marks? A bigger bra size but not all guys go for that. all guys like big butts and big feet arent too bad. a lot of girls have big feet.

I did!    I had so much fun planning our wedding.  We had a semi-destination wedding since we got married in a resort town about 90 minutes away from where most of our guests live....it was close to where I live.  We got a really good group rate for the hotel, and most of our guests made a weekend out of it.  Most of our guests wound up meeting each other at the pool, at breakfast, in the hallway or at the golf outing in the days/hours leading up to the wedding. So, these diverse group of friends and family were paling around at our reception since they had already become familiar with each other.|`|VnRECJJxaa	I did! Perfect weather, no problems or drama of any kind, the most perfect fun and romantic day ever! I wish i could do it all over again!|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I got married in 2007 and it was perfect!

Do you think he doesn't fantasize about other women? Well he does! And I wouldn't be surprised if you even thought about women sometimes. We're human, we're going to fantasize. But that's just it - it's a fantasy, not reality. It's when people can't separate their fantasies from reality that gets them in trouble. There's no harm in fantasizing.|`|2YX18RE2aa	Well now the problem becomes clear.    Get your head back in your own house.|`|QWSBnQcfaa	In my opinion and from my experience you are playing with fire. All good and bad decisions begin with thoughts. If you let those thoughts get too big or too consuming, you might be in for a struggle. My advise is don't entertain them and keep your thoughts in line with your goals. It reminds me a song that goes "be careful little eyes what you see".|`|OIRI5Ok7aa	That's normal.  Everybody does it, including your husband.  It doesn't necessarily mean anything.|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	No...I can't imagine thinking about anyone other than the man I am with while we are in bed together. But then again I do not have to because he just does it for me.    I hear men and women talking about on YA all the time...so you are not alone.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	i have had these dreams to, not abotu a neighbor but the dream with another man. it is jsut your brain working things out it doesnt mean anything.  no worries!|`|XXZFf1AYaa	Yes, I think you're just curious about your wild side. It's not going to hurt you unless you act on it.|`|GeruGGOQaa	Fantasizing about being with someone else is perfectly normal regardless if you've only been with one person or 12 people.  Of course if ever asked by your spouse if you fantasize about other people the correct answer is always, NO!
ecNeN0staa	Because she was a dirty dirty girl!|`|YqNSqUPvaa	Well maybe she was with a few men close to the same time....and doesnt know which one is your father....    you can find him if you want to though...|`|nJ33E233aa	Sorry, it isn't that uncommon these days. Don't let that consume your life.|`|JPXgLx6waa	Well, it's because she slept with more than 1 man around the time you were conceived.  If it comforts you, I don't know who both my parents are. Be thankful you at least have her.|`|sIvnNh26aa	Your mum may have her own reasons for not revealing your dad to you.In most cases a woman would refuse to reveal the father to her kid if the man negleted her after delivering the child;second if she became pregnant by accident/with the wrong man ;third if she has experienced alot of pain and tribulations raising the kid single handedly.But as they say time heals even the deepest of the wounds.Don't press your mum very hard or act as it's your constitution right to be told who your father is.Approach your mum soberly,try to be real nice and let her know that she is one in a million and the most beautiful thing that ever happened to you;that even if she tells you who your dad is he cannot take her place in your heart;that you would tell him straight to his face that he is a junk;that real fathers never abandon their kids and dear wives but are their for them during times of joy and problems.I'm sure your mum will be feel appreciated ,recognized and loved once more and won't hesatate to reveal your dad to you.Good luck.
6EztfzkEaa	You should really just talk to him about it.  You have to deal in facts though; and the fact is, his name's not on the lease.  Now, if you want some rent money from him, you're going to have to tell him that he needs to kick in on this rent if he's going to be here.  Either that, or pull his weight around the house.  Either grocery shop, or kick in on the bills.  Tell him, if he has money to spend on shows and at the bar, he can help with the bills.  Tell him, you feel it's not fair that he's here all the time, and you have to pay the bills by yourself.      A good way to do this is to talk to him about putting his name on the lease.  Now, i'm not saying that you are actually going to do this, but this will be a litmus test to let you know what you need to do next.  Tell him that you think he should be on the lease too, seeing as though he's always there.  Tell him that him being on the lease would help reduce some of the bills you have to pay and he will have a place that's his too.      Either he'll say sure, or he'll hesitate and question it alot.  If he says sure, the be prepared to actually do it.  Only do that if you are ready to live with someone.  You've got to be willing to sacrifice your space, and understand that if he's living there, he has some say as to what happens there now as well.  If he's hesitant and questioning everything, he's not willing to take on that responsibility at the time.     Either way, if he starts paying half the rent, half the bills, or gets on the lease, he's going to have some input on the dealings of the house at some point.  Can you deal with that?  Are you willing to give some to get some back?    Good questions to ask yourself.  Good luck|`|uS07WAwcaa	no  because he is not your legal husband and required to help out  unless he asks you to|`|wGw834Gkaa	If you have to ask you already know the answer.  Don't look here for us to tell you you are right, you know what to do, go do it.  Don't be used.  No one gets off the Ferris Wheel if they are getting a free ride.|`|69GgJhnWaa	Well, if all of his stuff is there, he's moved in and therefore should be paying part of the rent and bills. And of course he won't say a word about it, you're basically giving him a free ride. he gets a place to stay for free until you say otherwise. So, tell him if he's going to continue to keep his things there and act as if he moved in, he should just move in and pay part of the rent.|`|UI79JnJVaa	"If it's that serious, add his name   on your Lease Agreement."    "Then, he would be Legally Liable   to pay half of the rent, and Living   expenses."|`|97G3OJCOaa	ask  and  demand It's a common  courtesy to help  out specially  when he knows .It  has  been  two  months .A little  help  goes  a  long  way  and good relationship ,you are not asking for much.just  a  little share so you can have something for the rainy day ,as  we  call  it.|`|HEOWbQIXaa	Yes he should, tell him this is not a free ride|`|vTkAre7zaa	he should offer wait for it.....BUT U DONT MENTION IT IT IS RUDE|`|BeoZ3cDBaa	have a serious talk with the cheapskate|`|7EfUQ1MZaa	yea i think he should pay the bills if he want to live there he running up your water bill so yea  i think he should help out dont marry him my mom been through that and ive seen it|`|d88eb912fab4805d41b1be4d77cbd00daa	Listen to Amanda !!!!!!!!

You'll  be  used !!!!!!!!!!!|`|1Byis7Flaa	He is your boyfriend, not your roommate. And not your husband.    And no you should not be asking your boyfriend for money if you are having difficulties.    You should however, inform that you enjoy his company, but you will be looking for a 2nd job because of YOUR financial crisis, and tell him it isn't a good idea for him to be coming over all the time because you need to get your priorities in order, JOB, MONEY, BILLS etc..    And then let him either say   OK....   OR how about If I move in and help out ...    And then you two can discuss it.    But don't you offer or suggest it.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Subtle : give him a shopping list and ask him to get the shopping for you :)    Less subtle : leave bills where he can see them    But, he should contribute a bit, since he is using gas, water and electricity as well.|`|fGqkfLZQaa	I think you should gently move his stuff out; you can struggle without someone there to watch...    If he has money to do the things he wants to do - be clear - he doesnt want to help you...    Don't let him spend extended periods there anymore...    Hope this helps.
GeruGGOQaa	Tickets for a sporting event.|`|vTvsgVJiaa	How about a really nice journal and pens to write his poetry in, a mixed CD with songs that make you think of him, and if possible tickets to his favorite sporting event, even if it is just for a college or university team.  Or you could always go for the good old standbys... a new wallet or money clip, cologne, fancy shaving stuff, anything for his vehicle, etc.  Hope that helps!|`|89dbda5201b9cd4a4f9e174ecf63f9f7aa	Get a nice birthday card, and then put in your own message too.  I don't think men are in to romantic dinners, movies, and candles.  So, put a coupon in the card for this evening out.   Take your $100, hire a sitter, take your man out to a sports bar, and let him eat greasy food, drink beer, and enjoy himself with you.  Your time together, without the baby,  is the gift that my husband has always enjoyed the most.  Adult fun for two.|`|tClYrQ1vaa	well it just depends on what he likes   my husband loves to have poker nights so for his last birthday i got him a poker table and poker chips  just get him something that you know he really wants and that he would enjoy....or you can go with the whole sex night and give him a massage and just enjoy each other company.|`|OIRI5Ok7aa	Is there are certain band or show that he likes?  I got my husband tickets for a Henry Rollins show last year, and he absolutely loved it.  Plus, we both got to go and have a good time.  You can check and see what's playing in your area.|`|QP1ZQqPfaa	If he likes playing video games well you can get him a Game or a XBox or Playstation 3 Or a Wii.  You can also get him a CD player for his car.  A new cell phone.  Jewelry like a watch.  Tools if he likes to work on stuff.  Good Luck!|`|NWH3MnE9aa	I'm tellin' yah, Mrs. Gill, you CANNOT go wrong with prolonged oral sex.

If he is into "rap poetry" maybe a book for his poerty, OR better yet go down to the music store and get him something like a Hand-Held Stereo Digital Recorder to put it all down.|`|ZVqEDvZSaa	your only 17? wow..maybe get him a ps3 or xbox or something he really wants..u should really know.|`|WV36m31Zaa	a naughty note and pic in his briefcase or somewhere he is sure to look . ..|`|eN11kTWGaa	nice wrist watch or a really nice pair of sunglasses.     maybe make him a cake and wear something sexy ;)    http://www.patagoniagifts.com/customer/h...|`|TUNvbXbgaa	what are his hobbies?   buy him something he will enjoy. buy him is farorite music C D or his favorite Movie C D get him a nice watch or a nice pair of sunglasses. cook him his favorite dinner.   or take him out to his favorite restaurant.|`|i15KoiJhaa	You can get cool "Dog Tags" since he's in the army with pictures engraved on them of the 2 of you and on the backside a photo of your Daughter.    I got this for someone I knew in the Marine Corps.  They (I think) are pretty cool, sentimental with the photos, a time stamp so to speak since he's in the service and they are very affordable.
8XKmMBU7aa	These sites can't help you without paying annual fee for using it. Without annual fee you have no Prof that it's your own I.D. I can say you that you are using my I.D. or any other person who well know you and your I.D. information, can say same. You may find Lawyer and change your name in Court or may announce it in Newspaper.  OMG  I really don't find any Joke on this beautiful question.

Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|2s5WSVbPaa	They aren't legal, I changed my surname last year to the same as my partner and our children, it cost 40 in a solicitors and took 5 minutes, you get the documents straight away.|`|wGw834Gkaa	You should probably talk to a lawyer.  That stuff may have been ok a few years ago but now post 9/11 I don't think you can get a government nose wipe without legal papers.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	hey let me know what happens.  i really wanna change my name to Clint Eastwood.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I'd be very careful about trusting it.  I changed mine in 1992 and it cost me 22 at a solicitors sixteen years ago.  I had to have a written deed which I signed in both names and the solicitor witnessed.  I can't see how you could do that online.|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Clare,    Unless it goes through a court house, or is the result of a divorce proceding .... Web site can't fix your problem... But the will take your cash !|`|tClYrQ1vaa	that is in Euro and if you don't know they exchange rate i would look it up but i wouldn't do it online just because of everything that has happened you should go to the courts and do it|`|CSrNYeMaaa	i really highly doubt it bcuz changing ur name is a federal thing and has to b associated with judges|`|yy45iAbtaa	why would you want to change your name that your mom gave you at birth.but if you really need to go to city hall and do it the legal way they will tell you what you have to do. good luck.i don't think you can do it on a web sight.|`|L4rlu2BDaa	I had to pay nearly 60 through the deedpoll website so i very much doubt these websites are true. I then also had to ay 2 per certificate which i had to give to my bank, landlord etc which cost another 16. It's exspensive process so 10 seems really unrealistic!|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	If you are in the UK you can change your name for nothing. Just get your friends to call you by your new name.  If you want to do it officially you can put an ad in the local paper, saying "Jane Smith is now to be known as Esmeralda Muffin" or you can fill in a form and pay a solicitor for that they call "Deed Poll"  Web sites will take your money and do nothing at all.  Take no notice of websites.   Once you can prove you are using your new name, you can convince the passport office and banks, etc. I knew a man who did this once, and it was not difficult,
qyXSHIzbaa	Change is possible but unlikely as long as he sees nothing wrong with what he is doing. of course you miss him, you care about him but that does not mean it was a mistake. A relationship is about two people, not just him, it requires compromise on both individuals parts not just yours. I would say you did the right thing and should move on, as well as seriously analyze how you ended up with a guy like that to begin with. That is not a healthy relationship. Good luck|`|wZYPFtL9aa	well an affiar is terrible, but you need to sit him down and tell  that you wont stand for it and hope he listens        good luck|`|S9bEtVCSaa	No he would have gotten worse had you gotten married.|`|njbmOlJSaa	you did the right thing...and no if you were married then it probably wouldv'e gotten worse...marriage doesn't change a person.|`|rQ7dI88Maa	No, you didn't make a mistake but did the right thing. If he's controlling and abusive before marriage, he will be after. And only worse because half of everything you have would legally be his. People like this control and manipulate their victims until they comply with whatever to "keep some peace". This also can strip you of your self esteem if you allow it to. Congratulations for having the courage to break up with him. You miss him, naturally because of companionship. However, you deserve better in life. By your actions, you have told him and others that you feel you are worth more than what he's treating you. Don't regret it!|`|RQ9KdIwlaa	Only because of misunderstanding.To marry to someone is not so simple.So ask your boy friend to your family and say everything because it is Your life long problem.Where as you are a girl so everything should be cleared.  Do not believe any 3rd person between your love.
TaJWZ96paa	Considering three extra people in the house runs up the light and water bill. Groceries a warm place to live etc. I'd say that their getting off pretty good at 60%. But if the mother wants them out then I would have a talk with her and suggest she helps them put at least 25% aside in order for them to get a place of their on and that father needs to get out and find that job even if it's bagging groceries or scrubbing toilets.
5E4t2xqNaa	Maybe she's having problems at home, with her parents or other family members.  Or she could be experiencing new PMS symptoms.<br>  Now, how do you deal with this?  I would ask her what's wrong, if she wants to talk about it.  As a friend you want to help her with whatever she is going through, whether it means leaving her alone for a while (if that's what she wants) or letting her vent and trying to help her out of her slum.|`|qx4F2SJmaa	I am thinking that she is sexually frustrated and needs to get laid.|`|JuPXSwleaa	Honey, I know it hard. but sometimes the best thing to do is give them their space.<br>  <br>  Just tell her you not exaclty sure whats been going on lately, but if she needs to talk to someone you their for her. Then just be her friend. But dont press for details. Maybe something is happing at home that she cant talk about.. If she doesnt start being happy in a few weeks. Suggest it to her, Like 'Ive noticed your not your normall happy self lately, is there anything i can do to help you get through this?'<br>  <br>  Shell appreciate it and you wont loose your friend.
EIY722Hwaa	You should always be honest with your parents no matter what. If you're not, then you're not honest with yourself either. Your parents are your rock. Trust them and give them a little more credit.|`|7f7547ce6ae07c763915978ab531d418aa	Wait until you know for absolute sure what your sexual orientation is before putting any labels on yourself. You don't say but you sound like a teenager. Teens are going through so many physical & hormonal changes that a lot of them experiment with both sexes. You'll know when the right time comes to label yourself.|`|5AaMDz91aa	Being that you are only in teenager, things are deffinatly going to change.  Are you sure that you are bisexual?  Things could change, and you could end up liking only men.  Or only Women.  Either of which is absolutly fine, but with one of them, the world might not be very accepting.  <br>  Deffinatly tell your parents.  It could be on of the hardest things that you ever say, but it's deffinatly important.  If they find out about your girlfriend before you tell them, they could get insulted and angry, because you didn't tell them first.  <br>  One of my friends is lesbian, and telling her parents was very hard.  At first they didn't accept her into their family.  After she let them in a little into her life, they began to understand where she was coming from and accepted her just the way she was.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  K|`|JI1EpWX6aa	Yes you should.
