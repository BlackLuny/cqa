20070815070419AAgUh0l	Travel;Other - Destinations	Abbi fiducia in Me...dice il Signore...?	"La vita infatti è più importante del cibo e il corpo è più importante del vestito.   Osservate come crescono i fiori dei campi: non lavorano e non si fanno vestiti...eppure io vi assicuro che nemmeno il re Salomone, con tutta la sua ricchezza, ha mai avuto un vestito così bello.   Se dunque Dio rende così belli i fiori dei campi, che oggi ci sono e il giorno dopo vengono bruciati,   a maggior ragione procurerà un vestito a voi, gente di poca fede!"   (Luca 12:23,27,28)   L'intelletto dell'uomo cerca sempre di calcolare le cose: vuole delle risposte a tutte le domande dell'essere umano. Dio, tuttavia, ci dice semplicemente :" Abbi fiducia in Me.."   Perchè molti decidono di non provarci neanche?   Un saluto a tutti Alba

20090128184736AA1mBaT	Travel;United States;Other - United States	Need recomendations for an inexpensive vacation, I live in Tennessee about 30 min. from N.C. ?	I am 24 and my husband is 26. Our 5th year anniversary is coming up on Valentines day and we are getting our income tax before then and would like to go do something by ourselves. We have 3 children together so hardly ever get to go out to do anything, I would like to go to a restaurant or somewhere where I can wear a nice evening dress or gown. I want to be able to dress up but not stand out from the crowd too much. My husband wants to go to Vegas or somewhere to play poker and gamble but we have to keep it in our budget. We have a budget of $1,300 to spend for our trip including gas or flight, hotel, and expenses such as eating, shopping, etc. I am wanting to be able to stay for 4 or 5 nights at least but no more than 6 or 7. I really don't care where we go as long as it would be nice and something to remember, but as I said my husband likes to play poker and gamble. If we go to Vegas I don't think we would really be able to enjoy ourselves as much because we wouldn't have much money for expenses, especially gambling after we pay for the flight and hotel. Here are some things that I am really looking for while on vacation   ** a nice place we can go so I can get all dressed up to wear a nice dress, kinda like a prom dress   ** somewhere with a casino   ** nice room in a hotel, not some cheap motel like days inn or something   I would really appreciate any advice
