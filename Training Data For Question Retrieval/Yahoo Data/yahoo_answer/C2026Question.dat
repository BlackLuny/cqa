I mean I know 120Mz is better but if one tv had the 120 Mhz but low contrast ratio, should i lean toward the higher contrast ration with 60Mz rather the more Mz's.  List of importance... I'd be playing video games (ps3) and hooking it up to dish network.  thanks

I left my purse in the car when i went into the house (i guess i was in the house for at least 45 min to a hour). Well when i got back in the car i wanted to use my camera so i turned it on and it looks like the screen cracked when i turned it on (you cant feel it when you touched the screen but it looks like it). It still can take pictures but you can't see them at all. So will i have to get a new camera or can i get it fixed???      ps. I didn't even think to realize that the camera is like a laptop....you cant turn it on when its really cold, you have to let it go back to room temperature.......

Hi,      I’m building a electric motorcycle (yeah I know, it probably won’t work) and I was hoping to learn a little bit more about the difference between the energy capacity of a standard off-the-shelf 12V battery, compared to a expensive $200-300 dollar lithium battery.  Obviously the lithium battery will work better, but would it be more cost effective and have the same capacity if I were to just put 2 or 3 12V in place of an expensive lithium battery?       I appreciate any help you can give me and any additional comments you might have.

20090129071101AAxecYF	Consumer Electronics;TiVO & DVRs	Time Warner Cable remote?	I have read all the instructions to program my remote to my Philips TV. So many different codes and I tried them all. At first everything was fine except the volume wouldn't work at all. You would have to get up and change the volume on the tv set. I tried pushing the clear cable button and also the clear tv button. neither worked. somehow that problem got fixed but another occurred. The channel bottom would change the channel on the tv and not on the cable box. So it would take me off cable and onto that black and white flurry screen. I have pushed the clear cable button to let the remote know I want to change the channel on cable and not the TV. Somehow that got fixed but only for 2 days and this morning the same problem has came back. Ok so here is my other problem..      I have been on hold so long with customer service of Time Warner Cable - Austin and then when I finally get through I get someone who doesn't speak good english and doesn't understand english perfectly. He had no idea what my problem was because he had no idea what i was trying to say. I made a service call for someone to come out but then my remote fixed itself so I canceled that appointment. The same day my appointment was suppose to be, my remote f@cks up again. So I called again and guess what? I got that same damn guy.      Does anyone know what I can do with my remote? hahaha

20090129031353AA6ZUAR	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Should I sell my Wii?	Recently I just got a PS3 because there are a lot of good games on the console, and there weren't many good games on the Wii (Which I currently had).   At the moment, I am not playing the Wii at all and my Wii is collecting dust. I don't think I can replay the very few "good" games again. (The good games are Super Mario Galaxy and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.) Although, there are some games my family enjoyed playing. They were Wario Ware: Smooth Moves and Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Then again, with Wario Ware: Smooth Moves, I didn't mind playing it and I'm not too sure if it's a huge loss and with Super Smash Bros. Brawl I didn't really like playing it, but my brother enjoyed playing it with my cousin and his friend.   The thing that is stopping me from selling it as well is the new 'good' Wii game releases coming. I know of the new Legend of Zelda game coming out and The Conduit. The new Legend of Zelda game is 'apparently' going to be too easy, which will make it terrible. Should I wait till GDC 09 when they will most likely announce a trailer. The Conduit is probably only good to the people without and PS3 and Xbox 360 (IMO). Because it is pretty much just a normal FPS but it is pushing the boundary's of Wii. If there are any other Wii games I must keep a hold of my Wii for, tell me.   I am also saving up for an LCD TV for my room. (I'm 14 and I don't have a job yet, so it is much harder to save up.) If I sell, it could really help me get my TV quicker.   Remember I DON'T want to make a decision I will regret. That's why I need your answers. The person with the answer with the most detail will get Best Answer.   If I do decide to sell my Wii, I will probably sell it to my God Brother.

I saw an advertisement for an app on the iPhone, where you can see on a map where your friends are and what they're doing.  Do your friends have to have the same app for that to work, or can you see any cell phone on the map?      I ask because first of all, if you can see anybody that seems like heaven for stalkers.  I think somebody should have your permission before you can "track" them.        Secondly, I have a friend who has an iPhone.  I could see her using this - she's a bit crazy and stalks her ex, me, my ex, and other people.  I've tried to talk to her about it, and we've all had to block her from our facebook accounts because she was using them as stalking tools.  I don't hang out with her much anymore, and if she could track me I think it could lead to a bad situation.        Thanks for your help!

20090129072942AAGe6XU	Consumer Electronics;TVs	How are LG LCD T.V.'s...?	A while back I did a lot of self-motivated research on LCD TV's and Plasma TV's.  I am pretty sure an LCD TV is more of what I my husband and I are looking for.  When you get to the store though there are about 348931204 brands of TV's and you know the usual ones like Sony, Samsung, etc.  But what I was wondering is if anyone knows how good LG TV's are?  The picture quality looks great, but I'm not sure if anyone knows how they hold up or not or if they are comparable to other, more well known, brands...?

20090129072522AAD64lO	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	What will be the best AT&T phone for me?	My new Iphone 3G is finished, due to some dumb mistakes on my part. SO hesitantly moving on.... what would be the best phone for me to get? I would get the same Iphone but do not want to spend 500 bucks on a new one. I may get the old Iphone on Ebay because it would be around 200 and I wouldn't miss the 3G too terribly I guess.     The features I want to definitely have from the iphone are: notes application, easily syncs with Mac, a user friendly calendar that will sync to a calendar application on my computer + will give me notifications of alarms/ events on my calendar, hopefully touchscreen, and easy to text on. Copy and paste would be great (this function doesn't exist on the iphone)     Samsung Epix any good?    Any other options that would fit this criteria??    Thank you!        Thanks.
