I started by changing oil and lubing my chain and I was good to go. The first thing I noticed is:       1)When I pull the clutch to move the bike around (without the engin started) I have to force a lot more than if I was in neutral. Is it normal? ( I can't remember if it did it last year, but I don't think so) What could it be? and how can it be fixed?      2) When I give gas, I hear a noise, it kinda sounds like air getting out of a tire. The second I let off the throttle, it stops.      My motorcycle is a sv650 2006

I have also heard vortec heads are a good choice. Basically, just looking for more of a power gain. I will probably be upgrading to a 750 carb soon because the motor seems starved for fuel.   I want to keep it within reason and know enough that simply throwin heads on it could cause issues. Basically, Im looking for suggestions on heads, sizes, type, brand?

20090307174253AAHRN6Z	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Should I go with a 350 or a 454?	Hello,      I own a 1984 Monte Carlo, I bought it in 2006 when I was 18 years old with my own money. This cars hold sentimental value, it is my dream car. When I purchased the car I had 22" wheels with a slight lift, re-did the interior and had it painted. The car was awesome and I always received thumbs up from everybody. A few months later the car was stolen and when I found it I had no wheels, front end, etc. It has been sitting in my driveway ever since. This year however I decided to bring it back to life by installing a new engine. My brother and his buddy (a mechanic) said they would help me install the engine and transmission if I can find one. I have been looking at a few on craigslist and found pretty good deals on both 350' and 454's (my top two). My question is which engine would be a better choice. I want a car to have power, be fun, and unique. I know the 454 would be much more expensive since I would need new radiators, springs, etc. but I am willing to spend the extra cash if it is a better choice. Please Advise!    ps. I never knew how much I loved this car until I purchased a brand new car off the showroom and still missed my Chevy.

I had a car accident a few months back and after CT scans, x rays and MRI's I ended up having 2 slipped discs at L4 and L5 which were hitting my sciatic nerve which gave me such great pain starting from my lower back through my left bottom cheek and straight down my leg to my ankle. I have been going chiro sessions and even though the pain is not as bad as what it was, i still after several months get pain in my ankle and lower back. I have seeked legal advice against the driver who hit me from the rear and am dealing with a solicitor who mentioned this type of injury is substantial and considering i am only 25 years old have a whole lifetime of working, I havent had any children yet and that this will bring me trouble in the future. My chiro also said that once discs have slipped you can not fix them. For this type of injury what would be an appropriate payout figure, I have never done this before and obviously do not want to be out of pocket later on down the track for any medical sessions I need. Has anyone had anyone in a similar situation and what was the offer made my insurance. I really am not one of those people that sue for the hell of it and am not abusing the system. I have genuine injuries and why should it come out of my pocket when i was hit by the car?

She seems to think it's totally unncessary. I argue that it's good for the car, and prevents wear and tear on the gears. I do this all the time, even when I have my car parked on level ground.

If you've ever driven cross-country and stopped overnight at a truck stop or rest area, you know what I mean. All the trucks have their engines running through the entire night. I've noticed this during the summer and winter, doesn't matter which.       First of all, isn't this a huge waste of fuel? And doesn't it mean more stress on those big truck engines? But more than that, isn't it just plain unsafe to be in a parked vehicle with the motor running?

20090307181727AAE9Ppn	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Ford	99 Ford escort sputtering problem?	I have a 99 Ford Escort with 109,000 miles on it. I just replaced the heater core myself today and while I don't think it’s related, I still have a problem with the engine sputtering.      Here's my story...   4 weeks ago, I started the car up to warm it up while I got ready for work. It was 31F outside (cold for Florida). 15 minutes later, I went outside to leave and noticed the "check engine" light was on but it was running ok. So I drove a few hundred feet down the road when it started sputtering like it was out of gas and about to die. So I pulled her over and looked around. Checked fluids and the oil were maybe a little low, so added a little. Started the car back up and went on my merry way.      I didn’t get the check engine light checked until 2 weeks later. The car ran fine, no power loss, sputtering, rough idling, etc. The trouble code was “Running Lean”, but I don’t remember the number code offhand. A few days after that (on a Tuesday), the car developed a bit of a heater core leak. It wasn’t a large leak, but it was inside the blower assembly and tearing the car down was a no-go for at least until the coming weekend, but I had to work and couldn’t get the car fixed. So for almost 2 weeks I rode around with a heater core leak (of course I kept adding water/coolant as needed… little bit here, little bit there but never a lot). The heater core is fixed now (as of today), no leaks, no drippage… All good.      However during that course of time (while driving around with the heater core leak), the car started sputtering when I stopped (at lights, corners, etc) and felt like it wanted to die until I put the car in neutral or park. It would do this until it warmed up, then it was fine the rest of the trip. It progressively got worse but never got any check engine light, until today. Now it just runs rough the whole time and will die when I stop unless I throw her in park or neutral and give her some gas. Went to the local auto-parts place and had the code checked. P0135 (Oxygen O2 Sensor Heater Circuit Malfunction : Bank 1, Sensor 1). They cleared it so I went to the store since it was in the same parking lot and while driving home, the check engine light came on again, so I stopped at yet another auto parts store (a different one), and it was the same code P0135. Cleared it and went on my way. So now the car sits in the driveway with a new heater core, a slight antifreeze smell in the carpet, a radiator fan fuse pulled (see below), and it runs like crap…      Then last week (while driving around with the heater core leak), after work I noticed the car was dead. No turning over, no power whatsoever. Got a jump from a co-worker, and noticed immediately the radiator fan came on. I pulled the fuse to shut it off and got the car running. Now, every time I drive the car whenever I shut it off the radiator fan keeps running so now I have a habit of pulling the fuse before driving off.      Any ideas? A few of my suspicions   * Timing Slipped?   * O2 Sensor at the manifold?   * Some fuel injector cleaner I added at last fill up?      About the radiator fan?   * stuck relay?      Thanks for any help. :)   Jerry

Finally when i pulled into a parking lot it shut off again and when i tried to start it it just clicked and sounded like the battery was dead.  All gauges and lights did work.  Finally after a few minutes everything was dead.  I tried rolling the bike and poping the clutch.   It ran for a minute and i was driving it then the gauges when blank and a few seconds later it starting backfiring bad at about 40mph and shut off again.  I have not looked into anything but will tommorow.  I dont think it would be the battery, it seems worse than that.  Its probably electrical.  Please give suggestions would it could be and the proper steps to check for problems.  If you need any more details just ask.

I'm thinking if its a cracked bumper or bent hood, i can still buy it, cause those things are not hard to replace. And i was focusing on the ford focus, they are cheap and dependable. But right now i only  have 800 dollars to leverage, what types of cars can i start off at? I see dodge neons sellings for 150-300, but those have horrible resale value, can one of you give me your system, or some advice on how i'm going to do this? i have a plan set up and everything, just could go for some more info.

20090307191824AAgtWFu	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	How difficult will it be to get a GM car fixed if the company fails?	I am considering buying a 2005 Chevy Equinox SUV and am worried if GM fails about the ability to get the car fixed.  The car would be purchased from Carmax and would not be subject to any long term extended warranties.  The mileage would be between 35,000-42,000 miles depending on the exact SUV we choose.  They have a few to pick from.  I really think this is ideal for our family and have my heart set on the car.  What are your thoughts?

20090307191121AAvP5Iw	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Ok, is it the Alternator? In Detail, it wants to stall at idle, i rev it up, it hesitates then drives. What...?	... is going on? 1995 Ford Escort, Automatic trans, I4 1.9L 2-door Hatch. First priblem of ANY kind, and this is it. Car in Excellent condition. What happened....      At first, car didnt start. Changed the Distributor coil, and voila, it started! Then i put it in drive, and it dies.      I let the car idle, and the engine got very hot. The spark plug wires came off Cylinder number 3. We found one that fit, and it is on there now.       Now I let the car cool all the way down. It -wants- to stall after 30 seconds. Every stop, it wants to stall out. Sometimes it does.      I took it on the highway after this roughness. Smooth Sailing. then the Battery light came on. This would explain my squeaking alternator. Is it the alternator letting the car run bad, like ti wants to die? That would me my bet, even the fuel pump runs off electric.... (so does the engine cooling fan.)      I let the car sit for 45 minutes, cool down a bit. (Running kinda hot, engine hot to touch, temp gauge says fine, it reads on low side, gives accurate aftter car runs for like 1 minute, its a Ford.) I was able to drive home by putting the car in Neutral at the light, revving it up, slamming the brakes, revving it up again because it wants to die, and keeping the revs high .Makes a hesitating sputtering, like ti wants to die.       I know the Battery light did come on. Not during the second trip, but Iwas barely able to park the car on the hill. It almost did die. I had to ut it in neutral, wait 30 secinds, and it idled back ok. Then I had to rev it up and put it in D three tines to park the car, now i turned it off and it will cool down and all.      I will put a Head Gasket seal in for good measure, but i dont think that is it. The car wants to stall, and feels weaker as it drives. My battery is/was strong, but the belt was squeaking yesterday. 4 hours after that, it would want to turn over, and not start out of nowhere. Changed the Distributor Coil, and it DID start. Did have the spark plug wire off Cylinder 3, but now it runs ok, we got it back on.      So i wonder, yes changing the fuel filter is a good idea (guy said t seems to be the original one and it makes sense,) but could it be the Alternator, given even the Fuel Filter may not be getting Juice and the alternator Quit???      PS: I have a very strong Interstate battery, but I have had a Nissan Sentra that had no alternator. Displayed Battery light. I will try it again to see. But what does the board think, it did come on while driving on highway.....        Thank You, i am getting the most suspect part fixed tomorrow. I need to go to work. Thank You.

20090307185935AAuvKmv	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	2002 Grand Am 2-door.. left headlight bulb out, but works just fine when the brights are on?	I went to go change my light bulb in my car.. Couldnt get to the bulb itself because its night, even though I had good lighting, and it seemed that I had to take a lot off to get to it. The only thing in the way of the presumed-by-neighbor spot to change the bulb was the thing you adjust up and down for the light, which Im told if I even think about touching it, an evil geenie will come flying out of the engine and scream, "THEY SAID NOT TO TOUCH IT!!". Okay so maybe not. But still.      Anyway, I gave up, went and parked my car in my spot, and I accidentally hit the brights, and the car I was parked behind was fully lit up like when I usually pull up in front of it.. So I got out and the bulb was on just fine. Some people are saying 'Yeah theres two bulbs' but I swear it looks like the same bulb. I was putting the brights on and off looking and comparing and it was the same bulb!      Help? :(
20090307193343AAAJ3Ux	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Can adding a turbo save gas?	Ok I've asked this befor but I have more to back it up.      K I'm wondering if adding a turbo can save you gas (MPG)   (respond if you know what I'm talking about)      Ok well a turbo adds air ( well it compress the air). But the more air entering the engine the ECU sends more fuel in also. But when adding a turbo from a n/a engine (sorry I'm mainly talking about my car Nisaan 240sx s13 ka24e sohc)       When adding a turbo it is needed to upgrade your fuel system. Well not needed but recomend it. And they consists of bigger fuel injectors ecu fuel pump... But if you get something like a fuel computer like e-manage where you can set how much fuel goes in at certin rpm. ( sorry if I'm wrong about e-manage doing that but I know there's some that do)      But with that you could set the air to fuel ratio where more air doesn't throw tons of gas in but just enough. Like if you ran 7 psi but but was putting enough fuel for 4 psi. It wouldn't have high hp #'s but it would have great mpg.       Just think about that with more air there's a bigger explosion but if you set the air to fuel ratio lower. So insted of having 300 rwhp at 14 psi or 1 bar. What if you lowered the fuel where at 14 psi you get 200 rwhp.       Wouldn't that save gas????      Thank you if you read all of that :)

When I turn on the car it starts just fine, but after about 30 seconds it dies on me and I don't know why? Also, when I'm driving sometimes it kinda hesitates and jumps just a little bit. I was driving about 55 M.P.H today and it started jumpin a little bit, the check engine light turned on, and the car turned off while I was doing 55! I pulled over to the side of the road, turned off the car then turned it back on and it drove home just fine. I don't know why it's doing this, I just changed the Throttle Position sensor and that was'nt the problem. I'm thinking it might not be getting proper gas or something. I'm gonna try a fuel filter, but I don't know if thats the problem either. Any help would be much appreciated!!! Thank you!      Marcus.

20090307191438AA21ib3	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	I have found plans to add a modified alternator to my vehicle to use for welding. Can I use the existing unit?	See www.instructables.com and put compressor into the search bar and the instructions will be in the first page that shows up.  The article is titled On Board Air Compressor/Welder for Vehicles.  What I want to know is if I hack the alternator of my Corolla as shown with the Ford alternator will it do the same job.  Toyota makes good stuff and I suspect it will prove worthy but do not know for sure.      What I am mostly wondering is couldn't you just add the removed parts back in to the car electrics using a nice heavy duty switch box arrangement.         There is not a lot of room for me to work with and it seems silly to mount a second alternator when there is one there already.         I am not an auto mechanic or electrician, however I am pretty handy and no dumb bunny.  I cannot see why if you disable something inside the alternator why you could not just add it back in externally by using extra wire and some switches.      I get the need for a separate compressor to pump air, as you need to eliminate the freon in the circuit.  The hack this guy does is pretty cool, and seems to work well.  I would add a quick release to make it easy to isolate the units by releasing or removing the extra belt,  when not needed however, as there would be significant extra drag on the drive train.  you could also just drop the extra belt off the extra compressor pump and vent the compressor so it would just freewheel.

20090307195339AAxLaFP	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Whats wrong with my gokart!?!?!?!?	I have a old quicksilver 2x6gl from like 02-03 and its engine and everything is fine, starts on first pull, tires are great, paint isn't faded at all, etc, but there is one thing that i noticed it does now. when i try to accelerate, sometimes nothing happens. the engine just sounds like its running at full speed and i feel little "grinds,  bumps" coming from the back. if i tap on the gas repeatedly for about 10 seconds, it will very slowly move about 3-4 mph but not accelerate, but sometimes randomly it just speeds up really really really quickly after getting no where at full power. I think it has a torque converter but im not sure (it had a lump covered by a plastic box about 10 inches tall). very randomly if im lucky the first time i press the gas, it sometimes accelerates. Is this the torque converters fault and is there a way to fix it?
