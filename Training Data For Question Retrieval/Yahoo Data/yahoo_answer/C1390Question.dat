I had a dream one night that I was protecting a friend of mine. people wanted her dead but i fought against them all and won. Then when i was fighting a enemy he stabbed me and then he told me of his plan to kill my friend. i fell into darkness then i was in a room and i was wrapped around in chains a man was standing over me he said he could bring me back to life but i wasn't going to be human. i agreed and then i fell into the darkness again. when i awoke my skin color was no longer peach colored but a dark shade of blue and i had wings.  I then flew(yes not ran but flew) to save my friend. then a man confronted me and offered to help me and during the time of travel because my friend just happened to live far away from where i had woken up.(I awoke in a forest) i fell in love with the man and i saved my friend from her death. i awoke after that.

20090307150459AAgnEzo	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Help interpreting a dream.?	I have had this dream, where I am walking down a hallway and the hallway is lighted with bluish fluorecent looking lights. Down that hallway there are many doors of which to open. I open one of the doors and its a room about 15 20 feet and is illuminated by a blueish light on the ceiling. As i walk in the room it is empty. It is just four white walls, but the one I am walking forward to has a giant mirror that covers the wall. In the dream I am wearing, a night gown and I have long black beautiful wavy hair, but when I look behind me in the mirror, i see another version of me, but this person is dancing in a creepy manner wearing the same night gown, long black hair but is very ugly.  When I turn around, the other me isnt there but when I look back at the mirror, there it is again. Then out of nowhere I look into the mirror real close to a close up of my eye and i start to pluck out my eyelashes..one by one.

20090307151248AAMWUQ7	Social Science;Anthropology	The Ancient Egyptians were an ethnic mix from Africa and the Levant.?	The reason why people are now saying that the ancient Egyptian culture was a pure african civilization is purely political and not historical. Is is so terrible that the Egyptians were a racial mixture. All you have to do is look at the map. In looking at a map of Africa and the Middle East it is easy to see how 30,000 years ago immigrants came back into Africa from the levant because the nile area was lush with vegetation and was so fertile. They mixed with the people that were already there to from the Egyptian race. This is history and all the wishing in the world is not going to change it. Do you think there were signs 30,000 years ago saying ...STOP----YOU ARE IN AFRICA PLEASE SHOW PASSPORT----- I think not......people moved back and forth between Africa and the middle east for thousands of years. Finally, we are all brothers and sisters who come from the same place if you go back far enough so can't we all just get along.
20090307151746AATxeI0	Social Science;Psychology	Why is it some ppl can make you feel attractive about yourself. I feel attractive about myself?	However when I get around certain men that not even all that attractive to me, it makes me feel like they trying to do things to make me feel less attractive in subtle moves, saying certain things  doing  things.  It seems to me, when ppl know they look good and are confidence in themselves they dont try to make ppl feel unease.  Why is that?      Say on yahoo answers for ex. you have a person ask a question another one try to be a smart alex or cleary you can see he's mad he didn't come up with the question or ask feel some type of way so he try to answer with a very sarcastic answer, that's probably way off subject or say say something to attack.       example   someone say they dont have any friends the answer would be you're a loser. wouldn't that answeree have to feel like a loser to relate to a person he thinks a loser. basically like the saying takes one to know one.
20090307151812AA6zztF	Social Science;Psychology	Does everyone do the "ugly cry" every now and then?	I have two cries.  The first is when I'm a little upset about something.  Tears will run down my face and all that, but it doesn't really make me look horrible.        My second cry is when I'm competely distraught and hysterical over something.  Not pretty.  There is scowling, gasping, tears flying, red eyes and cheeks.  Thank goodness my "ugly cry" doesn't rear it's head very often.        Does everyone out there have an "ugly cry"?  What made me wonder was when I was watching MTV's show "From G's to Gents" and Macho got kicked out of the club.  They were filming him outside and he went into full-on "ugly cry".  I had never seen a man go into "ugly cry" mode so I guess I just figured they didn't do that (naive, I know).        So anyway, it made me wonder, "Wow, does everyone have an "ugly cry" every now or then?"  I know you can't answer for EVERYONE, so just tell me if you personally have one.      So, have you ever done the "ugly cry"?  And if so, what happened that brought it out of you?
20090307151903AAelDeA	Social Science;Psychology	Do I have a personality disorder, or am I just a massive *****?	I'm 17, pretty, charming and intelligent. I have a very high opinion of myself, but I'm aware that I'm not actually a good person. I lie, almost all the time. I can't help it, I'll lie about everything, even little things that have no importance in my life or anyone else's. Lying makes me happy, I suppose, and I feel really freaked out if I'm ever forced to tell the truth for some reason. Sometimes I find it hard to remember the actual truth, because my lie seems more realistic.      I've sorted out very complicated things, all by lying and acting- for example, I got a perscription for Ritalin and a diagnosis of ADD from an actual psychologist. I wanted the pills to lose weight, and didn't want to pay for them. I think I convinced him totally (I don't have ADD, I'mt he opposite of someone with that.) The diagnosis upset my mother a great deal, but I didn't feel anything apart from happiness because I had succeeded.      I have no problem lying to my parents, my boyfriends or my best friends. I don't feel any guilt at all. I know what's right and what's wrong, but I don't care, I don't have that bad feeling people are supposed to have to make them do what's right.      I like to steal, even more so if I'm stealing from people I know, like my boss, my parents or my friends. I never get caught, or even suspected. I cheat on my boyfriends all the time without remorse. I'm incredibly selfish and generally, I'm mean to the people I like. I have a lot of friends and boyfriends though, because I know what to say to make people like me.      The other day, one of my friends managed to figure me out. I'd got into a nightclub and she hadn't because she didn't flirt with the bouncer, so I'd just left her and gone off with a couple of french guys. She was angry, obviously lol, and she called me 'Iago'. Isn't he a psychopath though?      Am I actually not right in the head? Or just a massively nasty, scheming *****?

20090307154957AARA4l9	Social Science;Other - Social Science	How can I find inner peace?	I'm a 21 year old college student, who doesn't like my major and just doesn't care anymore. I don't even know who I am nor passionate about anything. I just feel like I'm kind of drifting along. Adding to that, I've never been in a relationship, which is fine with me..but I'm not even sure of my sexuality and would never want to kiss a guy. (I kissed a guy before...and just know that I wouldn't want to do it again. I could possibly see myself in a emotional relationship with a guy, but not a physical.   I would say I'm an extremely philosophical person, kind of interested in nihilism, because I don't really believe life has meaning. But part of me wants to find my own meaning and truth.   Adding to that, I've never really had close friends, and don't share my emotions with anyone. Part of me is like, what's the point, we're all just going to die? What's the point of any of this?      I know that I can't look to anyone else or anything to make me happy. I have to make myself happy...and I am trying to really get to know and love myself...but I just can't seem to get there..?

20090307050825AAyP4nT	Social Science;Psychology	Strange Dream Deja-Vu?	I get this feeling, pretty frequently, of deja-vu. Except that I don't feel that I've been there before, but that I've dreamt it before. Sometimes I get glimpses of that dream too, but once the sensation has passed, I can't remember what I have seen. It's never anything important - seemingly random and pointless. Sometimes it's just a fleeting sensation. Other times it's so strong it makes me feel sick, or dizzy, and gives me a headache.      Anyone have any insight as to what this could be?      I have asked a similar question before, I am just hoping to gain some new perspective.      Thanks.   xxx

I'm also curious what might cause these dreams too.

20090307121508AA6IJwR	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What's the issue most people have with promiscuous (yet safe) sex withstanding a relationship?	What's the deal? Understanding that we all have high level sex drives, and that we are bombarded by images of sex in the media, as well as our personal lives all day long- what is the incentive to fight against this?       In addition, what is the strain on a relationship if we all acknowledge that sex can be enjoyed for it's own benefit, and that it's not something unique between individuals in a committed relationship? If anything it seems we (and by "we" I really mean YOU guys) are setting ourselves up for failure by establishing unnatural boundaries. WE as humans WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE! I'd think this would obvious at this stage. -- This however doesn't have to interfere in a relationship, unless of course your partner is admitting that they are only good for sex, right?  (You should only be in relationships with people whom you enjoy beyond sex anyway)      Sex is often times just carnal pleasure, and wanting to do it with various sometimes random people is nothing unnatural. Legally forcing yourself to be monogamous however is unnatural. If I go around F'ing a new woman every other day, but come home to you every night, that means I like you. Appreciate that and go find an authentic and complete connection with another which goes beyond sex, so much so that having sex with someone else is simply that- sex, not "cheating".

BUT since it was post apocolypse outside was dark..but hot. Dark was the new light and we all glowed in the dark. So we were making out pretty heavily when I looked to the side. There were half a dozen suntanning in the dark. They were naked and their lower parts were stuffed with real taco stuffings. AND they had been out way too long..so the lettuce was really limp and the taco was just crusty etc. I was repulsed and went back in the building. OH I also held up a bus by myself.   Dream 2) I was using a dildo and suddenly it turned to goo and I was sad. ..and I thought that I'd need a new one. My husband walked in while I was using it and he was annoyed with me (in the dream).      Oooh also..what does it mean if you dream frequently about deep water with whales and stuff in it?

Also, most of my dreams (with an exception once every few months) are bad. I have developed something that allows me to escape he bad dream, just something I taught myself to do overtime.   Well, with all that said, last night I was dreaming I was alone in a parking lot, I had a bit of a walk to get to my car. I saw a car full of guys, they drover a bit passed me and stopped their car and it seemed they were going t reverse and right then and there I knew they wanted to hurt me. For a micro second I realized I was dreaming and was about to do my "escape" but as I was I decided I wanted to stay in the dream but I still ran but for a VERY short time, than I decided to stop, I lied on a hill and saw them comes towards me, I didnt run, I just didnt have the fight in me. I did say I would do anything but pleas dont hurt me. I was raped by all of them but not very violently.   Anyway, Im good at interpreting my on dreams but the idea that I knew I was dreaming,considered escaping yet decided to stay and surrender to the dream. Why??

A women is in love with a man but she doesn't know how to love very well because she came from a family that didn't show affection towards her much.      So, as a result of not knowing how to receive or give love back because of lack of knowledge from it, she pushes the man away even though she loves him and wants to love him.      Do you think this an example of self sabotage?

20090307114451AAxbHzf	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dream              meaning....?	Okay so I'm going to give you a little background info of whats going on in my life,so things may make a little more sense to you.   I'm a freshman in high school.Last night I went out of town with some friends.My ex went,whom I broke up with about 5 months ago,went also.He's about a year and a half older than me,and we dont go to the same school,and we really only started talking to each other about a month ago.By the end of the night things were great.We were laughing and having fun like old times.I'm thinking of giving it another chance.I'm gonna call him guy 1   The other part you need to know is about a guy that I just recently met about a month or so ago. He's in my fourth period and we eat lunch together about everyday.He's started talking to me about some of the things going on in his life.And I was the first one he called when he broke up w/ his gf.He wants to hang out,and I do to,but I'm not sure if I should b/c he still as a chance of getting back with is ex.I'm gonna call him guy 2.      So my dream(I know this a lot,bare with me):   It was raining one day after school and I had a softball game. Guy 2 was there with me and wanted to give me a ride to my game so I wouldnt have to walk to the field(our school is set up weird). I was hesitating be/c I knew that guy 1 was going to be there. Guy 2 said "fine I'll just walk with you" He picked me up cradle style, and started to carry me in the pouring rain. I was laughing and then I asked him about his ex,and if they we're still talking or planning on getting back together. He looked at me for a second and then he kissed me and smiled. Then I woke up.   What does my dream mean?   What do you think I should do in my real life situation?
20090227072022AA3ijPb	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What do parts of this dream mean?	I had a dream --actually, a bit of a nightmare-- that I was in a man's room with red walls. Then the man embraced me but soon after stuck needles into my body. Then we were in his car and I was looking out the window while he was driving and I think he told me not to speak to anyone in a threatening way. Then we were back in his house again in a bath tub which was inside a bathroom with gray tiles and I wanted to escape but I was scared.       Then while he wasn't looking, I ran through a maze like hallway with weird angles but I felt him chasing after me behind. I then reached what seemed to be the exit that had a blinding white light when I opened the door. But then I was running through the same hallway over and over again with him still chasing me. After a few times, he finally caught up to me and jumped infront of me but I pushed him away with a magical power (a light purple force field?) and escaped.         Then I was on the deck of a boat with one of my friends and I told her about the man. She said not to worry and that the man did the same thing to her as well. Then he came up from inside the boat and chased after us and tried to grab us. We screamed but no one could hear. Somehow after pushing him for a while, we got him arrested XD      But then later on in the dream, he found another girl and I tried to warn her but we both didn't like each other. For some reason, little pink flowers trailed him. Then they got in a room that I couldn't see through and more pink flowers bloomed outside the door and I had a feeling that they did "it".       Later on in the dream, the girl cried as I told her what kind of person he was and said, "Why didn't you tell me?"      What does this dream mean?      Sorry its really long XD   Can you explain what each little thing means if it has meaning?

20090307123129AAZXDvM	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why are there so few women in physics and engineering?	More broadly speaking, why are there so few women in the physical sciences (physics, chemistry, etc.), the advanced engineering fields (nuclear, electrical, chemical, etc.), computer sciences, and other highly advanced technical fields?      Women, when applied, certainly have the ability.  Women are now actually outperforming men at the high school level in math, so the "women aren't good with numbers and logic" argument is hopefully dead.  There isn't some ceiling to their ability, either; my fiancee is a shining example of that (or if you're not so fortunate to know such highly accomplished women, consider famous examples such as Marie Curie).      Women are also fully equipped with the resources.  The majority (and a growing majority) of college students in general in this country are female, and in my field, for every scholarship dollar available to people of either gender, there are approximately two dollars available only to female applicants.      Yet, to cite two statistics with which I'm familiar firsthand, at my undergraduate alma mater, 15% of the freshman class of electrical engineering majors were female, and the statistic dropped with each year of advancement.  Less than 4% of professional physicists in this country are female.      So what gives?  If women clearly have the ability and actually have an advantage when it comes to the resources, why is it that so few women, when given the option, choose to go into technical fields?  And how do we fix this?

I was arrested for possesion of marijuana, parifanila, and loitering and prowling. now lets rewind, when i was in 2ed grade my teachers called me dumb and said i didnt try hard enough. i was forgeting my homework and just not staying on top of things. So I was put on riddlen, and aderol, and many other a.d.d./a.d.h.d. medication. then i was put on anti depressents. nothing workied. i was pretty much told i was stupid and wrong and a pill had to change who i am or who i was at the time. and nothing worked. no look at me i was depressed because i have poor social skills, im horrible with women and everyone at my school thinks im a ******* joke and they all call me birdcage. i ******* hate it. i wrestled and i was made fun of for that. and i played football, and got relly made fun of. and it seems like anything i tried i failed at or i was made fun of for even trying. this then related to me not trusting anyone, which made me not want to talk to anyone other than people i already knew, which makes me anti social and not wanting to talk to anyone. so i turned to drugs like soooooooo many people who were depressed have done and will contine to do in the future. and then i was arrested for it. so now im even more depressed than i was before and i dont know what to do....
20090307124521AAweJID	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why do men and women categorically respect women less than other men?	I really need to know this in order to make a decision about my career, and this is why: I own a contracting business with a male partner. We are also both musicians, I've been doing both longer than he. We both possess skills and talents that the other one does not necessarily have, and you would think that would compliment and make a good team. But in 99.9 % of situations, men and women (but mostly men) treat him with utter respect, they ASSUME that he is an expert in all areas and treat him thus. I, on the other hand, get spoken over, ignored, given advice and instruction on whatever I'm doing by people who have no clue, and have a very hard time getting information that I need to perform my job. If and when I assert myself, people react as if I have just run around screaming like a maniac, and they take it as a personal affront. I need some insight into this phenomenon, and if I should just walk away. People will watch me build something and then praise him for it, it's unreal.       More specific information: it's a remodeling business, we do everything. I have tried different ways of dressing, wearing my hair, nothing changes. He has tried directing the conversation to me, they still ignore me (which is actually disrespectful toward him). I'm not a "manly" woman, nor am I a "girly girl", but it's as if people expect one thing and if I don't fit, they simply ignore the fact. Does anyone have any insight? Thanks a lot in advance.

20090227083004AAudJDe	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Is this theoretically correct : DREAMS = PERCEPTIVE REALITY ? ? ?	Experiences in the real world serve as the basis for the content of these two states of mind. An individual’s interactions with the world through his senses construct his perception of reality. Dreams are echoes of this perception.       http://www.stanfordscientific.org/compon...       I have this theory though :      Dreams are our own individual perception of the 'alternate' reality, meaning no two dreams are EXACTLY the same. I said 'alternate' because it is the dimension beyond the real world. And then sometimes, when we 'lucid dream', we manifest a state of subconsciousness making our perception of this alternate realm into pseudo-reality.      Am I the only one thinking this?

Dustin pulls me into a tight hug, kissing me on both cheeks then holding me back at arms length from him. He holds my face so that I am looking at him and looks deep into my eyes for a moment before asking, “Caitlin, are you sure this is what you want? It‘s not to late to say no…”    “Dustin, please,” I whisper back. “You said you wouldn‘t do this, you said you would be here for me and not do this!”    “Stubborn child,” He muttered to himself, then to her, “Very well then. You made your choice.”         That was my dream. Now Dustin is my best friend, but we did have a very involved relationship before and I know he don't like me being with Reed but as my friend he has promised not to interfere unless Reed does something wrong. Reed and I had a little problem a week ago, and i broke up with him but now we are back together causing a bad reaction on Dustin's part. So what does this dream mean? I think it has something to do with this...

20090307124254AATeb0g	Social Science;Psychology	How do you deal with social anxiety?	I'm not exactly sure what's wrong with me. I can get along with people who are older than me, and younger than me. But I can't relate to anyone my age. I feel like people in my grade are always judging me, I hate being the center of attention. My mom is always pushing me to be popular and she says I'm a loser and that I have no friends. Which is true. I have a great group of friends at school, and I enjoy talking to them but they never want to do anything outside of school. So I never go out to the mall or the movies with anyone. I've had 2 boyfriends but when I start getting close to them I panic and dump them. I'm a cancer survivor and I have 9 scars from surgery and a hideous body. I have undiagnosed anorexia (well, my mom says I do), I know I'm not fat, I'm starting to gain weight by myself. I weigh 105 pounds and people are always telling me to eat a cheeseburger and that I'm ugly and stuff. I do great in school and Recently the popular kids have started asking me to hang out with them, but I make up excuses. All they do is drink and do drugs and have sex and I know I'd feel so awkward. My mom is disappointed that I won't go with them. It's like she'd rather me go out with them, start doing drugs and get pregnant than what I am now. I don't know what to do. Any ideas? Thanks, please no rude answers.

20090307133510AACrd6f	Social Science;Psychology	I want him to act out this rape fantasy...how should I ask?	I am 20, and my best guy friend is 17. I had this crazy rape fantasy dream where I tied him down, gagged him, and then rode him cowgirl while lightly choking him.      The idea of being superior/having power over him is really exciting to me (him being pretty shy while I'm not; him being Korean while I'm white; him still being a kid while I'm an adult). The problem is, I don't know if I should ask him, or if I did, how I should approach this with him without freaking him out. I'm scared that he'll say no. Any tips would be appreciated.

20090307142455AA8XICy	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	When are men (as a majority) going to realize that women's 'reactiveness' allows them to be more influenceable?	I see and hear dudes complaining all the damn time about how women never initiate this, and that they never do this, that they wait for men to do this etc...      When will a good deal of men realize that it is women's lack of proaction which gives way to their proclivity to be reactive? In other words, women will follow your lead (regardless of what you ask of them) if you adequately provide for them. It is a huge benefit to men for women to give us this edge, don't ever underestimate or heaven's forbid relinquish it. Sure it is a heavy responsibility, but even more so than that this provides a huge deal of power an influence if you can harness it.

I don't even know who I am nor passionate about anything. I just feel like I'm kind of drifting along. Adding to that, I've never been in a relationship, which is fine with me..but I'm not even sure of my sexuality and would never want to kiss a guy. (I kissed a guy before...and just know that I wouldn't want to do it again. I could possibly see myself in a emotional relationship with a guy, but not a physical.   I would say I'm an extremely philosophical person, kind of interested in nihilism, because I don't really believe life has meaning. But part of me wants to find my own meaning and truth.   Adding to that, I've never really had close friends, and don't share my emotions with anyone. Part of me is like, what's the point, we're all just going to die? What's the point of any of this?

20090307144727AAeM1iQ	Social Science;Psychology	How would I apologize to someone I back-stabbed?	How would I apologize to someone I back-stabbed?      I've known Rhea for/ever/. Since 1st grade. We were like, sisters, you know? However, since 4th grade, I scammed her out of her Neopets account, even though it was only a side account. In 5th grade, I annoyed the heck out of her when I cried too much to the point when she had to be sent to the office when I accidentally spilled curry on her book. In 6th grade, I never ever did my homework. Always asking for hers. At the end of the year, I had the nerve to hack into her main Neopets account and cause havoc in her guild. I wrote her a confession in 7th grade. Later, I self-froze. A few months later I found a little cbox she and her guild hangs out on. After talking a little bit (more like her friend harassing me every second as I /attempted/ to apologize to her...and I think I did it wrong...)      I feel so terrible for all the things I've done...I wanted to send her a letter, but I feel that is completely insignificant and I really, really should do something much more than THAT. I planned to write her a autobiography of my life during those times...the best and yet the worse of my life...but I figured that would be too melodramatic and that will just spur up the undying pity I would expect out of her. I honestly have no idea if she ever wants to speak to me again, but I would honestly just want to...like, break the dispute, at least. If I'm lucky, heaven forbid, I might ask if she would like to be friends with me again. I've been such a heartless person...I honestly didn't know I was hurting her since 4th grade. Well, actually, I did, but I thought she didn't mind...she never said ANYTHING. She hid everything so well, took it so cleanly. She can't even be considered my friend...more like a puppet, really. So I ask you, Yahoo, how I should apologize to Rhea. I cannot contact her though the phone or any real-life face to face situations, so I have to settle with poking her in MSN and making it on the Internet.      I can code HTML, use Photoshop to make pretty effects, write decent narratives, draw decently, have a tablet, and is trying to get my old friend, my previous puppet, to forgive me.      Just so you guys know, I just turned 13. Wow, my life is so tragic. For those that are wondering, yes, I have a 3.85 GPA / straight A's NOW and had like C's in 6th grade. I have already broken my previous non-homeworking habits...but this is something I really want to change...I want to do something about it NOW.

So, the other day I was hanging out with the girl I like who had been flirting with me a lot the week before. She wasn't talking much and then after a little bit of talking she laughed at me for something and I jokingly called her a jerk. Then she said that I was the jerk and named all these things I've said/done to her.       I didn't realise it before, but everytime I teeze someone I sound like a jerk. Now it turns out that almost everyone hate's me because they think I'm a jerk, which I was never trying to be. I thought I was just joking around with them.      Now, since it seems like the girl I like doesn't like me any more, I'm dying to appologyse to her, but I won't see her for another few days.       In the mean time I have nothing to do at all and this is all I'm thinking about. How big of a jerk I am and how no one likes me. This sucks, I hate it. What should I do?

However, at the moment I am just feeling so unsure about what I want, and who I am, Im jealous of other peoples lives and keep asking myself what they're doing right that I'm not, I'd really like more regular reliable friends who i could go out alot more with but am worried it will never happen. I feel so lonely and bored and isolated sitting at home staring at a pc screen and it feels like a vicious cycle because you make friends by talking about things you do and being interesting and most of the time I do nothing or very little worth talking about. And before you say get involved with something honestly I dont have time with the huge amount of homework and revision on my hands.   Is this feeling familiar? Does it go over time?

But this question is not about sin, it's about our genders. Were we the ones that selected it? So if this was true, then transvestites don't have the right to change their genders lol.      Now I want to be a girl, since being a boy is pretty boring. You pretty much can do anything a boy can do, and still look good doing it. You get to wear all those pretty clothes (of BOTH genders as well), make up, nails, and have more variety of hair styles. You are less likely to have diseases and early deaths.

(I kissed a guy before...and just know that I wouldn't want to do it again. I could possibly see myself in a emotional relationship with a guy, but not a physical.   I would say I'm an extremely philosophical person, kind of interested in nihilism, because I don't really believe life has meaning. But part of me wants to find my own meaning and truth.   Adding to that, I've never really had close friends, and don't share my emotions with anyone. Part of me is like, what's the point, we're all just going to die? What's the point of any of this?      I know that I can't look to anyone else or anything to make me happy. I have to make myself happy...and I am trying to really get to know and love myself...but I just can't seem to get there..?

I had a dream that I went back to my dorm and there were two people sleeping in my bed. They're a couple by the way, and I'm not friends with them though they are significant in my life with regards to a certain situation (long story). When I say sleeping, I mean actually sleeping. I was confused but I didn't wake them up, and I noticed a bunch of cookies behind the bed. I remember shaking my head at their    carelessness and picking them up and throwing them out.       What do you think this dream means?
