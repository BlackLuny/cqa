YupMCYHlaa	Yes, I do this kind of thing all the time.  Also putting one person's head on another person's body.<br>  <br>  You decide which picture's background you want to keep.  You take the other person and 'cut him out', create a layer with just him on it, and trim all around him with the eraser tool. This is fussy work but it's not hard.  Then you slide him over the other picture.  Get him positioned and sized right, and maybe adjust colors, contrast, brightness etc. to match the other picture.  Nothing to it.  It does take a little practice, and the first couple of times you do it it's a little work.<br>  <br>  But it would be easier for you to take a picture with someone else, and just put Taylor Swift's head on her.|`|myq34zlHaa	Usually what you do is "cut" yourself out of the photo of you, and layer it on top of the photo of Taylor, next to her.  Making it look real usually depends on things like, getting the size right, the color right, and picking photos that have similar lighting.  If the photo of you is in bright sunlight, and Taylor is in a bar, it's really never going to look real.

3H8jvC2aaa	On my journey, I have learned not to get attached to plans.  Sometimes my plan doesn't match up with the larger plan, so mine usually gets scrubbed.  I find that when I stubbornly hold on to ideas and habits that go against my true path, I get the most grief.  When I'm on task and following my path, the road seems less frustrating.<br>  <br>  I have learned that our ideas of what we desire or want is based on our flawed views of the world and what is really going on.  Until we tap into the flow of energy that takes us to our true selves, we will continue to struggle with our lives, seeking that which we aren't equipped to understand.<br>  <br>  So, before we seek meaning in the world, we need to seek the truth that lies within.  Most of us don't realize our greatness or the fact that we are creating our own reality.  Until we face ourselves, we will continue to try to base our own happiness on others, when in truth, we can only be truly happy by connecting to our higher self.<br>  <br>  I can only tell you that when you achieve that level of awareness, the bliss you experience is better than anything you can experience on earth.  I'm not saying that there is perpetual bliss, but you do have access to that ability, which helps relax the body and mind so you can receive higher knowledge.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	i am a musician and despite all of the disappointments that i've experienced thus so far, i know that the only thing that will stop me from reaching my goals is myself so i gotta' keep moving forward without stopping!!!|`|SoE7kqpeaa	i feel trapped and simply can't seem to get out of it!<br>  <br>  just overwhelmed by life's problems... don't know when its going to be a good time ???|`|kTc3bfrRaa	its   tied  me  up!!!..<br>  <br>    and   aint  letting  go!!|`|9lT4e8Efaa	Being a student and being skint is holding me back! give me a few years and then I can truly fulfill my lifelong desires :]|`|1TPGdaXJaa	I've contemplated this question for some time. I feel some sense of frustration in that I feel my lifestyle and the 40 hour workweek are holding me from reaching fulfillment or my truest potential.<br>  <br>  What is that exactly? Well, for starters I love to write. I aspire to become a published writer but cannot dedicate the time I need to it around this 40 hour workweek. Other things too; just being with family, enjoying life, and learning new things. <br>  <br>  However my lifestyle requires that I work at least 40 hours a week to support it. Mainly, this is due to a mortgage payment that has to be made, and health insurance - both of these are things that support the well being of my family.<br>  <br>  I have found great relief and ability to embrace my job through Meditation and study of Buddhist philosophy; and altough I can embrace it and get some joy from it, it is not the thing I would most want to be doing to benefit myself and those around me, yet it is necessary.I've thought about changing careers too, but in order to keep this level of income, I would likely need to go back for more education, and I cannot justify dedicating a great amount more of my limited free time and energy to pursuing a new degree, which will inevitably have me back in the same dillema, just doing a different thing. <br>  <br>  I think many people struggle with this though, and I have to say through the meditation practices and study of Buddhist philosophy I have done, over a short time my perspective has changed from a "frustrating struggle" to one of embracing and engaging in what I do and not let it overtake me - so perhaps I will find more answers as I continue my practices.|`|LjsRfaskaa	As we go through life it is a journey. If we want to get somewhere else we need a map. As map is no good without us having some understanding of it we need a data base of information about it and what all the glyphs and icons mean. <br>  This is where the medicine wheel comes into the picture, because in order to find out how to get to your destination you need to find out where you are now. The medicine wheel is a compass, you are in the middle at the cross roads waiting for instructions as to how to proceed.  <br>  <br>  Animals are used as totems because everybody knows what animals are like, their habits and traits. It is a ready made data base of knowledge. Or it is if you spend time in your natural environment. :)<br>  It is not the animal itself but a description of the nature of the energy.<br>  <br>  Standing in the middle of your cross roads you look to the east, what totem message do you see. Then you look to the south, west and finally to the north and do the same, which message is given. East is the morning your beginning and motivation, South is hot, your emotion, west is earth and your physicality and north is cool, your higher consciousness. <br>  <br>  The medicine wheel is a very useful tool much overlooked in our modern society, mostly through misunderstanding about what it is and what you are doing. <br>  <br>  Even in the bible it says to  ' ask the birds in the air, they will tell you, ask the fish in the sea, they will guide you, etc.'  This is what it means, to use a medicine wheel and totems.

I am = I'm. Did not = didn't, etc. Personally, your grammar and spelling turned me off and she's an idiot to get pregnant that young.

So between me not liking her decisions and your annoying spelling/grammar mistakes I really don't like it much.|`|WTXvmcxcaa	it's not really bad, but it is too cliche, i think. and, you are telling, not showing. it needs work. <br>  <br>  good luck, though. :)|`|bnXhtB5baa	It's really good<br>  <br>  You should get it published<br>  <br>  But check spelling errors first!!<br>  <br>  <br>  x|`|28b037c9067df2ec28f25fbd2bab84e3aa	I'm not the best judge because this isn't the sort of story I would normally buy, or read.  But my responses:<br>  <br>  You should go on with this and/or other stories.  You definitely can write.<br>  <br>  It really does need good copy editing.  Badly.|`|GqhygphIaa	A lot of grammar and spelling errors...|`|daza5A4vaa	Didn't you just ask this?|`|j7D3Sazraa	I'm sorry to break this to you, but it kinda sorta sucks. I read three paragraphs and found about eight mistakes, ranging from spelling to grammar. You repeat things over and over again. But did you seriously use the name Isabella? With all the Twilight madness going on? And, yes, a girl can be a mom at sixteen. It just sounds like you're copying The Secret Life Of The American Teenager and Juno with this. Poor writing. And who begins their story saying "this is the beginning of this story". Well, apparently, you do.<br>  <br>  *EDIT* <br>  So you want reasons why it "kinda sorta sucks"? I have given them to you above. But I'll add more. You're writing is too cliche. How many novels out there involve pregnant teens? My guess would probably be a lot. And you start off way too fast. Like in the second or third paragraph, the character introduces herself as: My name is Veronica. I am sixteen. Blah blah blah. A good story doesn't give all the details at the very beginning. Let the reader learn about the character as the story progresses, not right at the very beginning. That is why I think that your story "kinda sorta sucks".<br>  <br>  P.S. It's not really "racy". But I still wouldn't spend good money on it.<br>  <br>  P.S.S. I really don't mean to be cruel(if you think I was being cruel) but I don't want you to delude yourself into thinking you have a career in writing, then fail miserably.<br>  <br>  P.S.S.S. I'm thirteen, and I don't really find your writing all that great. I don't mean to say that I'm better(although I might be- I've written countless stories, three of them recognized by the district and state, but that's besides the point). I'm really sorry to break this to you again, but it kinda sorta sucks :(<br>  And, in response to your previous question(Is this good writing for a 13 year old?), there is no such thing as "good writing for a thirteen year old". There is good writing period. Your age does not matter. If, by some strange miracle, you did get this story published, a customer wouldn't care about your age when buying the book. All they want is a good story. And is this a good story? No, no it is not.

GcMdjREaaa	well, i haven't directly read anything that clearly stated their position on this topic but i assume that they would have had a very positive view on education and would have encouraged it because the entire movement was all about political, social, economic, and moral reform. the progressives tried to get the people more involved in the affairs of the country, in order for them to be more aware of the big "tyrannical" businesses and the dominating monopolies that controlled the country. they wanted the middle class and working class to stick up for themselves and give the people more control over the government, and in order to do this, they had to be at least somewhat educated. i hope this helped!

If you go to a public high school--you'll probably be dancing like most teens (jumping around acting goofy) for the pop songs and slow dancing for the romantic ones..<br>  <br>  If you go to some kind of strict fundamentalist christian school--you probably won't be allowed to listen to any good music and won't be allowed to touch your date...  no really, seriously--I've had friends in schools like that...<br>  <br>  If you go to some fancy private school that actually holds a formal dance--ok you might be ballroom dancing...  Normally you have to take lessons to learn how to ballroom dance too...<br>  <br>  So if you're in public school--it's not going to be anything special, just a big non-alcohol serving party with a bunch of kids who paid way too much money for their dresses, hair, and tuxes...|`|mPMp8UGnaa	ok.<br>  1) you don't "perform" anything at prom<br>  2) I wouldn't call the dancing done at prom "ballroom"<br>  Prom is no different than any other school dance.

xJoMSkI5aa	Roosevelt was a proponent of the "New Nationalist" variety of Progressivism. A master of populist rhetoric and public charm, Roosevelt quickly tapped into the widespread fervor for reform. His administration pursued some widely publicized antitrust cases against large companies like Northern Securities and the Swift Beef Trust, but for all his aggressive rhetoric, Roosevelt actually went after fewer monopolies than his successor, William Howard Taft.<br>  <br>  Taft supported Teddy Roosevelt's "Square Deal" policy of attempting to strike a balance between employers and employees and conservatives and Progressives, but it soon proved impossible to please everyone. Taft simply did not have Roosevelt's personal charisma. Over time, he wound up satisfying conservatives more often than Progressives. His administration nonetheless pursued more antitrust suits than Roosevelt.<br>  <br>  Wilson was a leading Progressive, arguing for a stronger central government and fighting for anti-trust legislation and labor rights. As president of the United States, he passed important legislation on those.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop

hRmLenxCaa	This one definitely isn't predictable and it kept me interested. I thought it was creative and witty. It's fiction. It's called the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. Book one is "The Lightning Thief". <br>  <br>  Also, I've heard The Notebook is a good story. It's a sad romance and sounds like you might like it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ihHAcLaLaa	well, the Notebook is really good. I reckon you should read that. Try "Rangers Apprentice" by John Flanagan, I enjoy those. Um, maybe read "The Tapestry" by Henry H. Neff. Possibly Nightmare Academy by Dean Lorey.<br>  Maybe "Airman" by Eoin Colfer. "Eragon" in "The Inheritence Cycle" by Christopher Paolini.<br>  Keep your eyes peeled for interesting books like "The Egde Chronicles" by Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell.<br>  Have fun reading!|`|jKfuz9LAaa	Read "A Great and Terrible Beauty," by Libba Bray, and then there's two sequels to it.

jvPToF4Laa	Straight from the Bible, "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live among you." Anyone who could manipulate the world through magic was dealing with the Devil, and must be saved or destroyed.<br>  <br>  Even Cotton Mather was ashamed, later in life, at what he did in Salem, MA. It spiraled into a mass hysteria, and many people died.|`|NYU37jfGaa	They believed that witchraft existed, but on the whole witch hunts were not a feature of New england life.  Before the Salem incident, there had only been 93 defendents in witchcraft trials in New england, and of those only 16 were hanged.  Courts were generally quite reluctant to try witches (witchcraft was a difficult charge to prove) and juries were reluctant to bring in a 'guilty' verdict.  <br>  <br>  The Salem affair was very unusual, quite uncharacterisitc of witchcraft trials in general in New england.

35GfsJ3Paa	Generally the C three octaves above middle C (Thumb and 1,2,3 fingers on clarinet) is the highest possible note.

SPQdFOwKaa	For a title: "Beyond Light & Darkness" sounds the best of those. Avoid using the word "Twilight" in every case. Don't want your story to be paralleled with that book! As a new title what about one that involves the main character's names like, "Zero Light" or something of the kind for Dawn.<br>  <br>  For the weapon: "Enerblade" sounds great. I'm Greek (just the case!) and here are some Greek words you can use for it if you like, "Lepitha" (which means "blade" in Greek) or "Aeroshistes" which means "slashing the air." <br>  <br>  How Zero can wake up from the Twilight: I have no idea! Do what your writing skills tell you here. But I'd try to combine this one with Dawn. Or Zero dies and he's automatically transferred into the Light side, where someone's magical powers bring him to life. I'm in a bum! <br>  <br>  Good luck! I love the fact that the main character's name is "Zero" - brilliant. Don't worry about grammatical errors. They were few and far between!|`|TKZAYJokaa	ok, you might want to check out synonyms for twilight doing this i found 2 words that sound like cool titles<br>  <br>  half-light<br>   <br>  and<br>  <br>  last phase<br>  <br>  <br>  also the blade could be called<br>  <br>  duskbiter<br>  <br>  lifetaker|`|CmZ2cLIqaa	I like the title Between Dawn & Dusk.. Maybe use something that light & dark describes instead of just dawn & dusk. Maybe something like The Dark in the Sunrise? Or maybe vise versa The Light in the Sunset?

nQVM3ry4aa	The cold war can be seen as a war of opposing ideologies. You could thus argue that communism and capitalism were bound to eventually clash anyway. There are good reasons to believe this, since both sides<br>  feared and hated the opposing ideology. Take for example the McCarthy era in the US or how nazi criminals in trials early after the war tried to justify what they had done by describing themselves as anti-communist (sometimes, that even worked).<br>  As for the USSR, communist theory calls for a revolution against capitalism. Thus, the arguably most capitalist nation, the US, becomes a logical enemy for any communist state.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	First of all it started at the end of World War II, not WWI, which was 1945. But the Russian Revolution was during WWI, in 1917, and that  war ended in 1918.<br>  <br>  It's easy to say it was the USSR's fault, but both sides were to blame. Germany had invaded Russia during the early part of WWII, but the Russians fought back and beat the Germans all the way back to Berlin. But they wanted everything they conquered in Eastern Europe, Poland, Hungary, etc. As soon as the war ended, or really even before,(Yalta Conference-Feb. 1945, war ended in Europe in May, 1945; and Japan in Sept. 1945, after we dropped the Atomic bombs on Japan in AUgust)  America and the allies, who included the SOviet Union were dividing up Europe and the rest of the world, including Germany, and Berlin, within East Germany; Korea, VietNam, etc. All of these either resulted in or in the case of Germany nearly resulted in war (Aug 1961 Berlin Wall was built, this was a time of great tension and could have been war)<br>  <br>  I think inevitable is probably the right term. Both sides were paranoid during that time, especially in the 40's, 50's and early 60's. The SOviets got 'The Bomb" in 1949 and then it was real paranoia. (Even the 50's Monster movies were poking fun at Cold War hysteria with monsters standing in for Russians) <br>  <br>   In the 1950's and 60's, Americans were accusing anybody they did not like of being "Communists' when the real Communists were ready to bomb us, and we were ready to bomb them at any second.

jvPToF4Laa	Unless you are one of the world's top ten cellists, you need to be a complete musician. You will need to teach, be in a symphony, be in a school or university.<br>  <br>  For cello, increase to 5 hours per week. Listen to lots of music. Learn to sing, and plan to take up a wind instrument, and piano. If you find this is really where you want to go, you will wind up working on music for at least 20 hours per week.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Don't push too hard, too soon. Find some people to make a string quartet, if you can. More small group experience is a great way to learn music theory.
jRWYVZ5vaa	Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus was a leader of the senatorial party. As consul  he conducted the Numidian War against Jugurtha. He antagonized his legate, General Marius Marius, Caius . While serving as censor , Numidicus tried to remove Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, of the popular party, from the senate. In 100 B.C., Saturninus and Marius took revenge by passing a law requiring senators to swear acceptance of an agrarian law; they tricked Numidicus into refusing to swear and succeeded in having him exiled for it.

If it is terrific, then I don't think it's ruined at all. However, if it's Edward or Bella, I can't STAND the names anymore. I laugh at people named Edward.

5p4TKogxaa	I'm 13, too and I self-published a novel (Pollywood 156 pages). I also finished a second novel, but I haven't published it yet.<br>  <br>  It's been doing okay. Pretty good for a self-published book I guess, but publishers are better. Plenty of publishers would take young authors and advertise their age in order to get book sales, but most publishers won't even look at you if you don't have an agent. I'm still working on finding a good, trustworthy literary agent, but if you look on Google there are a number of books and websites (sorry I can't remember any names off the top of my head) that give tips on finding good literary agents and avoiding scammers.<br>  <br>  If you look on the websites of many of your favorite authors, they might list information about a literary agent or they might have an e-mail so that you can contact them and ask about literary agents.<br>  <br>  Penguin, Simon and Schulster, Little Brown, and Knopf are all excellent and popular publishing companies that accept a wide variety of books because they have different publishing sections (mini publishing companies sort of) under them for different genres. Most publishing companies have this, but you want to choose a publishing company that you know has sold very many books specifically in your genre of writing. For example, if you like writing fantasy you DON'T want to sign a contract with a publishing company that has been mostly succesful with biographys and not with fantasy.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped! Visit my website: www.mackenzielowry.webs.com<br>  <br>  Or maybe my blog: mackenzielowry.blogspot.com<br>  <br>  PS: I write for my own age group because those are the type of books that I read so it's easier for me. Don't be afraid to let everything out in your writing just because of your age. If you feel you might want to include something in your story like rape, but you are afriad people will get angry with you for it, put it down anyway. I find it works better that way and you have nothing to fear. I was afraid to even include one curse in my book (my second one which is now completed) but I did anyway and my dad, who went over it for spell check and grammar, loved it and didn't say anything about the curses. It doesn't really matter. Just be yourself in your writing.|`|ogUyrukYaa	The best advice I can give you is to write whatever YOU want to write.  Like you could be in the middle of writing the book when suddenly inspiration for the short story could strike you.  So start whichever one you feel you could write the best at.  Though be careful if you do do both at the same time you still keep the stories separate and don't mix them up.  Though I've heard that some people write short stories that have been what inspired them for a novel.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck! :D|`|oOU6XJOqaa	I think that you should stick with righting a book for your own age group. It will be easy to connect to since your childhood may be a little blurry.<br>  <br>  P.S. Scholastic publishes almost any book.<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|S5xwCthGaa	Okay.  Fact only 20% of novels only get published, so if you are writing to get published...it's kinda the wrong idea.  If you are writing because you love it, well then, you might have a chance.<br>  If you really believe in you current story, dont let it go! <br>  Got luck.
8ygky5g4aa	A skit is basically a short comedy scene.  So why can't you use dance to tell a short funny story?  After all ballet tells a story, right?<br>  <br>  I think that would be extremely creative!  Just be sure to use simple exaggerated movements that everyone will understand!

That would have taken many, many more supporters and a much larger lobby from the American Nazi Party. Also, a seat or two in congress might have helped. I'm sure Japan and the US would have been fine (assuming Japan never bombed Pearl Harbor). After all, Hitler was no lover of Japan or it's citizens, but he realized the political necessity. If Japan had bombed Pearl Harbor, but the US was an axis country, that would have split the Axis up and ended the war a lot sooner.|`|0YUUK97naa	There would have to be crazy people and politicians to do that

MI22i1Bwaa	It is certainly a dramatic beginning.  A very powerful example of how the Nazis used mass rallies and spectacular settings as tools of propaganda.  Looking forward to seeing where you go next - perhaps you could juxtapose how people were treated by the Nazis.|`|AA11668123	The only improvement you can make at this point is to spell Nazism correctly.

xJoMSkI5aa	The most interesting commentary is on how the whole world watched and did nothing as the Nazi's were systematically murdering millions of Jews. The lesson learned is that if a situation exists today that cries for attention, people should now sit by. This can be everything from a schoolyard bully picking on a kid to planned murder, as in the case of the Nazi's.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Night
0lwGsRNqaa	Mainly because it wasn't affecting us. America only helped because Japan attacked us at Pearl Harbor. If it wasn't for that we would have never helped.|`|GcMdjREaaa	none of the other nations cared (especially america) because it didn't affect them. the greatest powers in the world have never really cared about the rest of the world unless it affected them somehow. when pearl harbor was bombed, then we got involved and actually helped to stop the war with D-Day. the only reason why the russians got involved was because they were attacked by nazi germany in 1940 and the city of Leningrad was blockaded, etc... so basically, what i'm trying to say here is that no country really truly cares about another-and if it does, it does a really bad job showing it. proof of this is the Armenian Genocide (the first genocide of the 20th century). no one did anything to stop it because it was being perpetrated within the Ottoman Empire and thus, didn't really affect Europe nor the USA. the US still refuses to acknowledge today that the killings of over 1.5 million Armenians and another 2 million or so Greeks and Assyrians was a genocide because of its strong political ties to Turkey. and today, no one is doing anything about the ongoing genocide in Darfur. hell, has that even making any news since 2 years ago? i mean, it's been going on for over 4 years and the UN stated it the situation as "characterized by gross and systematic violations of human rights and grave breaches of international law". and called for the UN Security Council to take "urgent" action to protect Darfur's civilians. what the **** is all thus "urgent" action??|`|6e5b848f7fef4c024d3e0ddc434039fbaa	One reason, and really the main is reason is because nobody knew it was happening. Nobody believed  that the Jews and the other Undesirables, like the gypsies, the homosexuals and the handicapped, were being killed off in concentration camps. You have to remember that when they took the people away, nobody came back. Very few people escaped the camps. It was not indifference, it was ignorance to the situation.  the systematic way that it was carried out also was a factor in nobody knowing what was really happening. First they were moved to the Ghettos to live and then they started getting called out to labor camps which weren't really labor camps but death camps. Some of the camps did operate off of the slave labor from the Jews. The plan was smooth and allayed suspicion  from all the outside world. hope this helps.|`|QnYYXRkBaa	at the beginning it was kept more secret. hitler denied anyone being killed and so nations didn't interfere. <br>  and, i even know some people today who completely believe that the holocaust NEVER happened; it's just a hard thing to believe. so most countries stuck their heads in the sand and tried to act like it wasn't happening<br>  hitler's forces restricted foreigmilitaryes anentrancece at most big locations.<br>  <br>  <br>  that's all i can think of. we learned about all of those reasons last semester, so it's kindof been forgotten hah. hope i helped!|`|vWXDvWJfaa	Hitler's actions really had no effect on us until Pearl Harbor, and The Zimmerman note.<br>  <br>  The Zimmerman note was intercepted, and it was a letter asking Mexico to attack America on behalf of Germany.<br>  <br>  The Monroe Doctrine was also somewhat in effect, saying that America was going to be self sufficient, and close off it's borders to everyone except France and Britain for some trade.<br>  <br>  It was also very hush hush when it first started. All germany had to do, was deny the accusations, and it was done.<br>  <br>  The meeting discussing the final solution was held in such secrecy, and all documents were burned from that meeting, except for the person who kept documents for himself, and was discovered.|`|A9nBzN3Daa	that movie  band of brothers, theres a part where they beat the germans somewhere and then some how some soldiers stumbled upon a camp littered with jews . the  reaction of the american soldiers where like damm!! look at these people who need help. they litterly gave them what ever they could (food) i guess you can say just by the soldiers reaction everybody wanted to do something about it. if we would have sent spys earlier we could have caught it quicker

Soon Will learns that becoming a ranger is more difficult, dangerous, and worthwhile than he had imagined.

auJiPMAmaa	Reed Brennan<br>  The collected, curious protagonist, Reed is a brown-haired girl from Pennsylvania who enters Easton Academy on a scholarship at the beginning of the first book. Her troubled family background and otherwise placid past makes her overly ambitious and docile when presented with exciting opportunities. Though gifted both academically and athletically, her first major aspiration at Easton is to get into Billings House, which holds the allure of great social privileges and respect. She manages to get the attention of the Billings Girls, and a series of initiations to test her credibility follows.<br>  <br>  Noelle Lange<br>  Noelle is a brown-haired, dark-eyed young woman who initially serves as 'leader' of the girls in Billings House. Fiercely loyal to her friends, she is the implied counterpart to Reed, being similarly skilled in lacrosse and soccer, and apparently coming from a shaken family of her own. However, her privileged upbringing tends to make her blunt and sometimes insensitive, as she enjoys intimidating other students as well as the Easton staff. According to some classmates, she can't live without drama in her life. She tends to know everything about everyone, even the things no one else knows. Noelle possesses a mysterious long, red scar along her stomach, just above her hipbone. She has an unstable longtime romantic relationship with another senior named Dash McCafferty.<br>  <br>  Ariana Osgood<br>  The series' muse, Ariana is the quietest member of the group, possessing blue eyes, ethereal white-blond hair, and a penetrating stare. She is known for always having her nose in a book, and is considered to be Reed's first friend in Billings, as it was Ariana who introduced Reed to the others. Beneath her exterior, Ariana is eventually revealed to have darker issues as the series progresses. She becomes the lead character of the prequel and spin-off.<br>  <br>  Josh Hollis<br>  Reed's primary romantic interest, Joshua (often called Josh by his fellow schoolmates and friends) is a blond-curled, green/blue-eyed roommate and best friend of Thomas Pearson in Private. He later becomes Reed's boyfriend in Untouchable. They break up at the end of Legacy. He has a number of medical conditions that require him to take pills daily. Later he develops a relationship with fellow student Ivy Slade.<br>  <br>  Kiran Hayes<br>  The most glamourous Billings Girl, Kiran is a model with green eyes and light-brown hair. She has extremely good sense in fashion, and is capable of turning people into superstar lookalikes. She is also known to be shallow and 'bratty' to others. Beneath the surface, Kiran is troubled by alcoholism, which can lead to repercussions for herself and the others. <br>  <br>   Taylor Bell<br>  A brainy, sensitive member of the group who possesses messy dark blonde curls and blue eyes; Reed's first impression of her is of a "cherub." She claims to have a photographic memory, and possesses a sweeter and more innocent nature than that of her three friends, as she is often visibly sensitive to others' feelings.<br>  <br>  Cheyenne Martin<br>  A series antagonist, Cheyenne is a controlling girl whose ambition is more aggressive than Reed's. She has a public feud with Noelle, and seeks to take her spot as leader of Billings House. Despite being on opposing 'sides,' Cheyenne and Reed tolerate each other at first, but they are thrown into conflict during the events of the fifth book, Inner Circle, when the new year at Easton begins.<br>  <br>  Thomas Pearson<br>  Reed's first boyfriend at Easton, Thomas is a good-looking, mysterious senior with anger management and alcoholism issues. Reed looses her virginity to him. He carries a sense of recklessness and danger, which automatically attracts Reed and several other girls at Easton. In Private, Reed discovers that Thomas is a drug dealer and that he comes from a wealthy yet dysfunctional family. He disappears at the end of the first book, a development that Reed does not take kindly.<br>  <br>  Sabine Dulac<br>  Introduced in the fifth book, Sabine comes from Martinique and has a French accent. Like most of the Billings Girls, Sabine possesses physical beauty. She becomes Reed's roommate, and the two of them form a friendship. In Legacy Noelle returns to Easton and Sabine grows jealous of Reed and Noelle's relationship. She is one of the few to stand up to Noelle, though it usually goes unnoticed by the former. In Revelation, it is revealed that Sabine has more than a few skeletons in her closet.<br>  <br>  Dash McCafferty<br>  Described as having Abercrombie & Fitch good-looks, Dash is Noelle's on-again off-again boyfriend. Dash has had an unsteady relationship with Noelle Lange for years. He has a short fling with Reed Brennan at the Legacy party in Reed's junior year.<br>  <br>  Ivy Slade<br>  The primary antagonist during books 6 and 7, Ivy Slade harbors a widespread vendetta throughout the series—mainly directed at Cheyenne Martin, Noelle Lange, and all things associated with Billings House. Physically beautiful, she is described as a match for the Billings Girls in terms of glamour. However, she is the only character known to have declined an invitation to join the dorm. In Ambition, it is explained that she is driven in part by a family-related grudge.

Not just any, but one who comes with a good track record.  Only a live teacher can show you the hands on techniques that you will be much longer in perfecting on your own,  let alone the bad habits that you'll have to correct later.  You may wish to augment this instruction, by studies in music reading, theory, etc. with library and on line texts.

How would you know when you've got it? Sounds like unconditional is conditional upon my choosing of what unconditional means at any given time.

AA12135515	Kids are *already* taught 'just history' (aka European) in school from Day One. Been that way since forever here in the US.

The reason why it was *started* was a reaction to racism.<br>  At least looking at it from a past point of view. We've come a long way since the 40s & I think it *would* be a good idea to teach about contributions ....from Everyone. The idea of including the Black experience is relatively recent.<br>   But people who see racism in that have to remember that they didn't teach *jack* about *any* other group for Ages. It's different today.<br>  <br>  How many of us can go into any detail about contributions from Asians, Latinos, or Native Americans?<br>  <br>  Not many, is my guess. Because it's never taught. or at least not stressed. <br>  But ask about guys like Columbus, Thomas Edison, Lewis & Clark, etc & you can talk for days.<br>  <br>  I do think the time has come to do Amercian History right & include Everyone.|`|4Vmlf902aa	Black history month was created to honor past african american leaders,etc. Then again the Canadians celebrate BHM too, so I guess to honor past AA, and black canadian leaders.

In the same way that Mount Rushmore honors the achievements of three presidents (and not ALL the presidents just "to be fair"), it's not really a form of discrimination. It is not snubbing other ethnicities. Black History Month simply honors certain events, people, and accomplishments that forwarded the nation, and it does educate more people about these events. At any rate, if it's increasing people's knowledge about a piece of American history, respecting great people, and increasing nationalism/pride in some small way, I would say it's a positive force and not as bad as challenging the very basis of equality in America. Frankly, I'd say there's a lot more immediate and severe problems about discrimination against ethnicities than having a Black History Month.<br>  <br>  And trying to have a month dedicated to every cultural group just because African Americans have one sounds more like a fad than equality. You don't need a month to appreciate the history of a people.|`|mUUMaOs4aa	i totally agree, i think their is a bit of racism in that<br>  <br>  <br>  we are all equal so we shouldn't divide it as "black history" and "history"<br>  i mean heck if this is the case where is the "mexican history" or "hispanic history?"<br>  <br>  since this day in age, we are all equal, everything thing should be considered history in my opinion.|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	I have no idea, but if there is black history month, I want hispanic history month, native American history month, german history month, AMERICAN history month, etc...<br>  <br>  Having all of these division are separating us futher and further.

Otherwise I am gonna simply expand on his comment)<br>  <br>  While it WAS started to help circumvent Racism, we are at a point in history (with a Black President and such) where I beleive it actually does promote some racism now, as we will NOT overcome racism until we no longer feel a need to label everything.<br>  <br>  20 years ago, they talked about BLACK Quarterbacks, now its jsut a Quarterback, and it he's Black...so what?<br>  <br>  There was time where it was a BLACK person in a Metal Band.  Now... no one really notices. <br>  <br>  So I do suggest that while it certainly served a purpose for it's time, that now it does more to divide than to unite.<br>  <br>  Why no wAsian History Month?  Hispnanic?  Irish? (cause guess what...my Irish ancestors were on those same railroads as the Asian and Black peoples were).  Jewish?<br>  <br>  When do we stop with the labels?  Today, they just furhter agendas.  The NAACP is one of the MOST racist orginaztions in the country today.  And it behooves their leaders to keep race simmering in the headlines, or they lose money.<br>  <br>  Why is OK today for a United Negro College Fund, but not a United Asian one?  Or a United Gay Fund?  <br>  <br>  I am not supporting or attackingit, but I do believe that it does have the ability to be a two edged sword, and that maybe it's time as a neccastiy is done.  "Blackk" histroy should simp.ly be incorporated with the rest of history, becasue only then will it become the "norm", instead of further isolating races.<br>  <br>  Which is really stupid, btw, as the only difference in the end is some folk get better tans than others.  There is no superiority of one over the other...so why do people dwell on Color so much.<br>  <br>  Until we become colorblind, problems will persist.<br>  <br>  ***WOW..

MllOMmnUaa	The inside of a pioneer wagon, or ‘prairie schooner’ as they were often called, was designed first for utility and then for comfort. Enough supplies to last the occupants for up to six months had to be packed into an area usually ten feet long and four feet wide (about the same amount of room as the inside of a VW van). <br>  <br>  The labor involved in preparing for a journey west was generally divided equally between women and men. The men built the wagons and prepared the livestock, while the women prepared and stocked food and clothing for the journey, as well as decided what household essentials to pack. Keturah and George Belknap, who traveled overland from Iowa to Oregon in 1848, outfitted their wagon with a minimum of space and maximum storage in mind. <br>  <br>  George put together a sturdy traveling wagon, making by hand the bent wood bows, probably four or five, to support the top cover. The cover was made by Keturah, who spun the linen for it in the long winter evenings leading up to the trip. Most likely she treated the material with linseed oil to make it waterproof. Next, George built a box at the front on which he would sit while driving the wagon, and in which Keturah stored bacon, salt and other staples. The top of the box was made with holes in each corner so that it could be lifted off and used as a table when sharpened sticks were inserted into the holes for legs. <br>  <br>  Keturah filled an old chest with clothing and other items for use along the way. “Will start with some old clothes on and when we can’t wear them any longer will leave them on the road,” she wrote in her diary. Before the journey began, she washed and packed everything suitable the Belknaps owned, and also spent most of the winter cutting and sewing several new suits of clothes for them to use when they arrived in Oregon. (Some women recorded cutting material beforehand to save room in packing, others carried bolts of uncut cloth in order to be prepared to meet whatever need arose). <br>  <br>   <br>  The clothing chest was packed in behind the food storage box, and to keep it from slipping around in transit, George fastened a system of cleats to the bottom of the wagon bed. Then Keturah put in a chair to ride in, leaving a small space on the floor for her son to occupy while he played. After that another trunk was put in containing dishes (most likely china) and household goods set aside for use when they reached Oregon. A washtub and a basket containing the dishes she planned to use on the trip (most likely tin) were stowed in a corner. Then George loaded four 125 lb. sacks of flour and one of corn meal, then bags of dried apples and peaches, beans, rice, sugar and coffee. <br>  <br>  “The wagon looks so nice,” Keturah wrote. “The nice white cover drawn down tight to the side boards with a good ridge to keep from sagging. It’s high enough for me to stand straight under the roof with a curtain to put down in front and one at the back end...I have made 4 nice little table cloths so am going to live just like I was at home.” <br>  <br>  Her iron ware was stashed in a box that hung outside the wagon, and her butter churn was put in by the washtub. When all was packed and ready, she added a feather mattress and pillows, which would be laid on top of the boxes and over a side of shoe leather at night, with two comforters on top “and we have a good enough bed for anyone to sleep on”. <br>  <br>  Keturah spent the last few days before their departure from Iowa in her kitchen, making provisions to get them through the first week of travel–baking bread, frying doughnuts, stewing dried fruit and cooking a chicken and a ham. <br>  <br>  Keturah Belknap’s preparations for the journey were typical of most travelers. Large amounts of staple food like flour, corn meal, and bacon, were the foundation of any wagon outfit. “Put nothing in your wagon except provisions and clothing and such articles as are indispensably necessary on the road,” cautioned Louisiana Strentzel, after surviving a harrowing overland journey in 1849. Many travelers who packed luxury items would end up throwing them overboard along the way to lighten the burden of the overworked oxen or horses. <br>  <br>  Wagons were typically arranged in a similar fashion to the Belknaps’, with boxes or trunks filling the floor space and providing a flat surface on which to make up a bed for sleeping at night. Margaret Frink, who traveled west with her husband, searching for gold in 1849, could afford to spruce up her wagon a little. “The wagon was lined with green cloth, to make it pleasant and soft for the eye, with three or four large pockets on each side, to hold many little conveniences–looking glasses, combs, brushes, and so on.” <br>  <br>  One other important item mentioned in most diaries of the overland westward journeys is the ‘India rubber water bottle’ (somewhat similar to a very large hot water bottle). Margaret Frink carried two, each with five gallon capacity, in her wagon. She also carried an India rubber mattress, which could be filled.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.emints.org/ethemes/resources/S00000482.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.emints.org/ethemes/resources/...</a><br>  (has sites that explain the different types of covered wagons that were used by pioneers to traverse the Oregon Trail in the late 19th century.

When high-status people (mostly women) needed to travel over long distances, it was usually in covered wagons that looked very much like the wagons of later US pioneers.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I've seen many pictures of medieval and ancient Roman covered wagons, but I don't have any links I can give you.|`|MMFUS9Yhaa	go to

Fill flash can be tricky as you have to be sure your shutter speed is not beyond your flash sync speed. Also, the flash output power is usually set to -1 EV.

I just thought I would add some examples below for you to see the effects. <br>  <br>  Also if you do not have a hot shoe mounted flash, your max shutter speed will only be about 1/200th of a second. SO if you are not careful of what you place in the background, something with the same light value as the foreground and darker like trees and such, you will run the risk of blowing out your background.<br>  <br>  If you do have a hot shoe mounted flash, you can place it into high speed sync, and can then fire the flash at whatever your shutter speeds are capable of.<br>  <br>  Here are a couple of examples.....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bc-photo.smugmug.com/gallery/1802564_xFo8n#463023491_L5CR8-A-LB" rel="nofollow">http://bc-photo.smugmug.com/gallery/1802...</a><br>  <a href="http://bc-photo.smugmug.com/gallery/1802564_xFo8n#90034075_eBJPs-A-LB" rel="nofollow">http://bc-photo.smugmug.com/gallery/1802...</a><br>  <a href="http://bc-photo.smugmug.com/gallery/1802564_xFo8n#90034076_Qtg2c-A-LB" rel="nofollow">http://bc-photo.smugmug.com/gallery/1802...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://freephotographytutorials.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://freephotographytutorials.blogspot...</a>

All you had to do was look and see that the Continentals were poor, ill-equipped, inexperienced and ill-led.<br>  3)  The complaints, however real and important, could still be negotiated.  Ministries change in England, and there was always the chance that a favorable Prime Minister might advance the interests of the colonies.|`|t79pLOCUaa	Because they were either from England themselves or descended from English immigrants, and they remained loyal to the King because North America was an English colony, and governed by England with English Laws and English social customs.<br>  They saw no reason to become an independent nation.<br>  .|`|BjBkO0CSaa	It's a matter of loyalty.  Though the emotion is not as strongly seen in people today, back in the time of the American Revolution, people were extremely loyal to their rulers and countries.  The American colonists were very hesitant in separating from England for this very reason; they tried a number of compromises until they realized they had no choice but to declare independence.  Some colonists did not relate to the cause, and thus, remained loyal to the king.  It can happen today, too, in any cause.  If you feel that supporting a side is not to your best interest, would you support it?  Though many colonists were hurt by the taxes and oppression brought on by the British, many were not.  Boston, MA was one of the colonies that was extremely enraged by British policies; however, there were colonies that weren't as severely affected by taxes and quartering, so they didn't see the issue as the Bostonians did.  Therefore, they did what seemed right: they kept their loyalty to the king.  Unfortunately for these loyalists, the American colonists won the war, and they were forced to either leave America or give up their loyalty to the king.|`|KHSOVxViaa	Where?  Which colonists?

BD5WT4uZaa	the future is uncertain, <br>  but can be influenced by the past definitely, but not necessarily thanks to free will...<br>  <br>  having specific goals and being positive about the future can definitely influence your present which is moment by moment becoming your past...<br>  <br>  it's all about the decisions that are made and carried out...|`|KqwloDo7aa	How does the future influence the present just as much as the past?  <br>  <br>  The only thing the ideas we call "past", "present", and "future" influence is one's perception of Reality.<br>  <br>  The ideas you ASSIGN to your experience, DEFINE your experience......until you change them...<br>  <br>  We think that because we've agreed that there is a Tuesday on our calendars that there really IS a span of time called Tuesday. Similarly we think that because the hands of our clocks are oriented with the longer one pointing in one direction while the shorter hand points in another, we actually believe that designates a real "hour" in a real day ("it's 3 o'clock").<br>  <br>  In the commonly accepted definition of how we refer to days and hours in our language, this implies the concept of calendars and partitions of time that we arbitrarily agree to designate as days, in portions or increasing exponents thereof (a day, 10 minutes, .03 seconds, 9 weeks, 16 months). However, the truth that we habitually and conveniently overlook in our use of language is in mistaking the map for the territory.<br>  <br>  To further clarify the perspective, we must consider that the ONLY reason we CAN act as if there are passing days and nights is BECAUSE the rotation of the Earth on its axis makes the sun APPEAR to be rising in the east and setting in the west. Outside of this rotation, there IS NO occurrence called night OR day. Ironically, if the Earth were rotating in the OTHER direction, we would STILL act as if days and nights occur in succession. <br>  <br>  Consider the following ramifications of this dilemma rhetorically:<br>  <br>  Why does Western culture celebrate the passage of a New Year at a different "date" than when Chinese New Year is celebrated? <br>  <br>  Why do we use the terms BC and AD? Was Time “marking time” when Jesus was born?<br>  <br>  Are you any younger or older when "Daylight Savings Time" ends or begins? <br>  <br>  If we, on Earth, designate "a year" as the period it takes the earth to revolve around the Sun, does that mean that astronauts living on Mars (someday) would be OLDER than their colleagues living on Earth because it takes Mars longer to orbit the Sun than the Earth does? Whose "measure" of a day or a year is more valid?<br>  <br>  Let's get personal. Do you REALLY, ACTUALLY think you are 30 years old (or ANY number you prefer) because the Earth rotates on its axis while revolving around the Sun....just because you've celebrated a certain number of birthdays recorded on an artifact filled with made-up designations called dates ??? <br>  <br>  In the "territory" in which we TRULY live, RIGHT NOW WHILE YOU ARE READING THIS, there is NO SUCH THING as an hour, or a second, or a minute, or a day, or night, or Tuesday, or 2012, or beginnings or ends. The designation of these concepts is merely a mutual, cultural agreement amongst ourselves to partition a Reality which itself CANNOT BE DIVIDED into parts......because God is ONE ! <br>  <br>  The designations are MADE UP in order for us to pretend that there IS a "before" and an "after", "here" and "there", a "going away from...." and a "return to...", or a Friday the 13th!! The map of "designations" we utilize is NOT the "territory" in which we live, move, and have OUR BEING.<br>  <br>  Don't believe me?<br>  <br>  Let's bring the point closer home. Spatially, is there REALLY a border ANYWHERE on Planet Earth, except as we "designate" on a map, or act as if the "designation" is a real border on an Earth that is ONE, indivisible planet? <br>  <br>  One may even protest, "That's not true. Here are the actual markers located at such and such longitude and such and such latitude! Touch these, doubter. That's where the border is....."<br>  <br>  Need we even reply that the obvious truth about the "markers" is that they, too, are merely artifacts; extensions of yet another artifact, which is the "map" which "points" to their locations.....on ground that is wholly, inseparably connected to the WHOLE PLANET itself?<br>  <br>  As author Baird Spalding says in the reference, ”Becoming aware of yourself as a spiritual being, offspring of an infinite spiritual system and one with all the powers and capacities within that system, is the very essence of attainment. To grow from the present state of awareness of himself as a material being and into the consciousness that he is a spiritual being contains the full secret of man's attainment.' Man's nature cannot be reversed for he always remains a spiritual being. He can only reverse his notion of himself. Instead of doing this, he should reverse his mistaken idea that he is a material being and retain the truth that he is a spiritual being created in the image and likeness of God."<br>  <br>  The Creator Himself IS the VERY pattern by which mankind was made. Jesus' message and reason for coming to this earthly dimension was to show us, in as stark, as uncompromising, and as definitive a manner as possible, that we are as He is, which is as our Creator endowed us all to be, and that is as immortal, Spiritual beings who are the Spirit and Image of our Creator.<br>  <br>  We are NOT physical beings. We are Spiritual Beings like He is! Our Father created Jesus just as He created us...the exact Spirit and Likeness of Himself. Jesus is, even TODAY, trying to show us what is possible for ANY OF US, not what is ONLY possible for Him. <br>  <br>  As there are NO real "borders" spatially, there are NO real "borders" temporally, either, called past, present, future.....except as designated on our "cultural maps"!<br>  <br>  Are time and space separate from one another? Not after Einstein !! <br>  <br>  Is the Earth still flat? Ask Erickson, Columbus, or Magellan for the answer !!<br>  <br>  Neither are YOU limited by erroneous ideas of time or space (much like a Nobel laureate or sea-going adventurers whose breakthrough observations changed previously sacrosanct paradigms). <br>  <br>  The Creator's "omnipresence" means being everywhere and everywhen AT ONCE, whether we see only the miniscule portion of His presence appreciable to the limited capability of our physical sense capacity. <br>  <br>  We live, move, and have our Being in Him....<br>  <br>  As Spiritual Beings, there are NO temporal OR spatial "borders" for us, either. As Spiritual Beings, being every where and every when AT ONCE means there are no partitions called "past", "present" OR "future". <br>  <br>  Again, those designations of past, present, future are what WE utilize to pretend that the ONE is divisible into those designations.<br>  <br>  THIS is Who we are and THIS is what IS perfect, as well as natural, to us in our proper estate. Not after we die! I mean right NOW as you read these very words. <br>  <br>  "I and my Father are one"....is just as true of you as it is of all !!<br>  <br>  …..Created as the very Spirit and Image of God, Himself, we ALREADY live with our Creator in the "territory" of Eternity.....NOW !!<br>  <br>  Orin|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G Humans anticipate.

The feelings and/or memories associated are it, and whatever story you've attached is it. Conceptually if you froze this second in time and your mind froze too, everything happening is the only thing happening. There is nothing beyond that door, nobody typing these words all that is simply just is. If the story behind that were happening, then THAT's what is happening, and not everything else that isn't happening. <br>  <br>  We can't know anything for sure, and I'm simply asking we stop acting like it.
9ZQnd2rmaa	At one time it was thought there was a massive invasion of celts to the British Isles in about 500 BC,coming from central Europe.  As long as 25 years ago archaeologists began calling this theory  into question, and recent dna studies have shown that most native Britons and Irish are descended from post-Ice age settlers and neolithic farmers who were here long before that time. Many of these came from Iberia, following the western seaboard. the celtic languages probably arrived with the farmers, certainly no later than the bronze age,and the iron age developed out of the preceding bronze age.<br>      The earliest people in the British isles and Ireland after the ice age were hunter gatherers. Some lived in the caves at Cheddar Gorge. The dna found in the bones has recently been matched to people still living in the area today!  We know they had some kind of shamanic or sympathetic magic--antler headdresses have been found (think of Herne the Hunter) and they may have occasionally had some kind of timber monuments or totem poles (3 huge mesolithic posts possibly aligned on the moon were set up not far from where Stonehenge would be built thousands of years later!)<br>   The neolithic peoples,some of whom had a near eastern origin, brought farming and herdingand also the clearance of forests. The hunters gradually abandoned their lifestyle and started to farm too. The first massive monuments were  built--the causewayed enclosures and the communal graves known as long barrows, and then henge monuments. in Ireland some of the tombs were particularly enormous and complex (see Newgrange), with alignments on solstice sunrises, and covered in enigmatic art. The people, from their bones, seem to be of a slender graceful type (used to be called Mediterranean) with long skulls and high cheekbones. men average about 5ft5/6 and women 5ft to 5ft2.<br>     During the bronze  age henge and stone circle building continued and of course this is the era of the most famous stone circle of all, Stonehenge, which appears to be a weird hybrid with possibly native and Breton traits intermingled and a design firmly rooted in woodworking.<br>      Other people in small numbers arrived in the british isles at this time (they made it to ireland too but in not such great numbers) known as beaker people because of their ornate pottery which may have been used in a male drinking cult. At one  time it was thought they were an 'invasion' but it was more likely to have been small groups of traders/settlers.They were taller than the natives with rounder heads and broader more rugged faces,and came from anywhere from Holland through germany, the Alps and down to Spain. They were the first gold workers in Britain--one of these men, with his tiny anvil and golden earrings was buried just 3 mi from Stonehenge. When his teeth were tested for isotopes it was found he'd grown up around the Alps.The beaker folk were archers and buried their  dead either  in oak coffins in flat graves or under small mounds.<br>     Within 500 years the bronze age was at its height, with the rich Wessex culture in full swing and Stonehenge at the peak of its power. People were sunworshippers and the wealthy wore clothes fastened with gold discs with crosses on them set into jet and amber. They had short daggers and chieftains might have a gold breast plate covered  in mystic symbols and a mace (bush barrow.) Poeople were now somewhaat taller than in the neolithic, roughly the average height of people today, with even six footers sometimes found. they buried the dead in singular round mounds which seemed to have developed from beaker  customs. certainly it was now a warrior society of the individual rather than a communal monument.|`|JS3Zy6ASaa	DNA evidence has blown previous answers, and even previous questions, to smithereens.|`|AA10904201	Briefly.<br>  Neolithic farmers; They were hunter gatherers, they hunted and gathered berries, etc.<br>  Then you had the bronze age, then the iron age.

ANzszvWRaa	This is a battle that has been waged for almost as long as there have been people studying the medieval period.<br>  <br>  I have a very rare and out-of-print copy of "Feudal England" by J. H. Round, M.A., in which he mainly concentrates on shooting down various theories put forward by other historians of his day (the book was published in 1895). One chapter covers the idea of burghal hideage in some depth and no doubt his opponents disagreed with every word.<br>  <br>  One thing that Round makes very clear is that the wording of charters and chronicle accounts is open to debate, since we can have no way of knowing what was actually in the original author's mind. When a particular 12th century Latin term is used, the author knew which particular meaning he intended, but today we can not know. He also makes the point that the "Hide" was a unit of assessment, not of measurement and it probably varied radically from shire to shire.<br>  <br>  Yes, the issue is still hotly debated, but today historians take a more pragmatic view. If one historian holds an opposing view on a subject to the mainstream view, they will usually make a channel 4 documentary and have a couple of day's publicity - then they vanish again into complete obscurity.

HAEjoPVRaa	Sparta's decline began when it attempted to become and empire and began using money. When Sparta was a simple city-state, although very powerful, they never attempted to conquer more land than they needed. Messenia was really their only true conquest before the Pelopennesian War. <br>  <br>  During the war with Athens Sparta became the most powerful city-state in Greece. they had the backing of the Persians, who supported them with money and ships, and ultimately conquered Athens and its allies. they then set up oligarchic systems of government in each place. <br>  <br>  Ironically it was Athens who first revolted against the Spartans and succeeded and kicking them out of the city. Following this Sparta began to have defeats against some of the other city-states, most notably Thebes. Finally a battle took place near Lacedaemon and after that Spartan influence was greatly diminished. Never again did they wield as much power as they had earlier and Alexander did not need to conquer them.<br>  <br>  In review, it was the attempt to gain an empire that ultimately ended the reign of Sparta. For further information read Paul Cartledge's book The Spartans|`|MllOMmnUaa	Sparta was generally referred to by the ancient Greeks as Lakedaimon.  Lacedaemon is now the name of a province in the modern Greek prefecture of Laconia. <br>  <br>  Sparta entered its long-term decline after a severe military defeat to Epaminondas of Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra.|`|8tVMmzvoaa	They eventually just started to decline and they lost some major battles against other Greek city states.<br>  <br>  Alexander didn't even try to conquer Sparta, as it was supposedly not worth his time.

CLB32006aa	You study the history of philosophy because if we didn't have the foundation of the historical philosophers we would be in the same space as they were.

Whats the use of a geek who can repeat the entire life and quotes of socrates or any other philosopher but cannot reason or make decisions of his own. On the other hand history can help you understand the mind of your philosopher(which would contribute to the understanding of his philosophy),the contribution not being great if you aren't looking up specifically to understand his mind.  I guess this answers the questions that followed the first.Those who study 'history' without knowing  why they have to know it aren't doing philosophy at all.|`|GOKlnTfbaa	That applies to everything. For example the study of the history of man as compared to studying man. Or studying the history of weather as compared to studying weather. studying the history of philosophy gives you insight to how philosophy was started. Modern day philosophy has roots to "old" philosophy and some of them are still the same.
BjBkO0CSaa	Okay, so a quick background of World War II.  It officially started in 1939, when Britain & France declared war on Germany.  (Hitler had just invaded Poland, and had violated many terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I).  America did not get in until Dec. 1941, and it was only because Japan bombed Pearl Harbor (a major naval base, in Hawaii).  During World War II, it was the Axis (Germany, Italy and Japan) vs. the Allies (Great Britain, USSR, America, and occupied France).  During most of the war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the president of the US >  he was a good president (elected to 4 terms), but he was paralyzed by polio.  He passed away in April 1945.  VP Truman took over.  The war against Japan continued through 1945.  In August, Truman decided to use the atom bomb to end the war.  Thus, the US used 2 atom bombs on Japan: one on Hiroshima and one on Nagasaki.  The two bombs killed over 150,000 people, and affected more through radiation and such.  All in all, the US used the bombs to end the war: neither country wanted to surrender, and Japan was slowly losing ground.  But by using the bombs, Japan surrendered, and the war ended.  By the way, as a side note: the US remains the only country to have ever used an atom bomb on another country.  The use of those two bombs remains a controversy (should they have used them?  why/why not?)  You can make your decision.  Oh and you can find TONS of more info using Google Search.  Good luck!|`|KHSOVxViaa	It was towards the end of WW II, and it was intended to end the war and prevent the need to invade the Japanese mainland.<br>  <br>  The Japanese forces had fought almost to the last man in Iwo Jima and Okinawa, causing a huge toll amongst US forces.  Any invasion of the Japanese heartland was liable to be much more costly, and the bombs were regarded as a way of avoiding this.<br>  <br>  Depending on how you calculate or accept the projected figures, it could well be the case that less lives were lost as a result of the bombs ending the war than if the invasion had happened.|`|SEH6iTIoaa	it was world war ii.  us bombed nagasaki in order to end world war ii, and it was also retaliation for the pearl harbor bombing.|`|So7lXdBKaa	the japs bombed pearl harbour  so the americans drop ed 2 atomic bombs on japan one on Hiroshima and one on nagasaki as a show of might forcing the japs into surrendering|`|PvpP6tGNaa	World war 2 was going on. America wanted to bring it to a close as quickly as possible to prevent massive losses on both sides if they had to invade Japan. Hiroshima was the first to be bombed on Aug 6th 1945, and Nagasaki on the 9th. Both were strategic military targets, although Nagasaki was unlucky as it was only a back up target. Japan surrendered less than a week later|`|NIOF5Oliaa	Surrender was not in the Japanese way of life.They believed that people who surrendered were sub human.so they would fight to the last man on their home islands.So to save tens of thousands of allied troops it was decided to scare them into submission.|`|6IooffjFaa	"Obviously there must have been a war going on?"  Are you really that stupid?  Have you been asleep your whole life?|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	As a massive show of force to make the Japanese **** their britches and back off thus causing an end to the conflict in the Pacific. The Japanese culturally do not 'surrender' they die, the attack with such a fearsome weapon showed them that they were the weaker party, a scenario which made surrender their only option allowing them to save face and to save the lives of their citizens.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  The Japanese declared war on the US by launching a sneak attack on Pearl Harbour in Hawai'i. It took the war in Europe as an indicator that Asia would be ripe for the picking, as noone would be able to step in and help defend it.|`|tiABWrkeaa	Why was it bombed? Aside from the war, clouds, I kid you not. After Hiroshima, the second target was to be Kokura. However, the landmark  that was to be used as a target (chosen to maximize the bomb's effect) couldn't be seen due to clouds and smoke from a nearby city that was firebombed. So, the bomber, Bockscar, moved onto its secondary target, Nagasaki.<br>  <br>  And it's really sad when World War II is skipped over. It did set up the world for the next 50 years.

To grow from the present state of awareness of himself as a material being and into the consciousness that he is a spiritual being contains the full secret of man's attainment.' Man's nature cannot be reversed for he always remains a spiritual being. He can only reverse his notion of himself. Instead of doing this, he should reverse his mistaken idea that he is a material being and retain the truth that he is a spiritual being created in the image and likeness of God."<br>  <br>  I believe that we still "reside" in the highest vibratory sphere (called heaven) as the eternal, immortal, spiritual beings our Father/Mother created us to be, even while we partake of the "views" available, from amongst an infinitely diverse range of vibratory views, of an expression we've chosen to call human experience. I believe that as such beings, we haven't "fallen" at all, any more than our "home" is forever lost to us; in exactly the same way that the sky is always blue above the clouds.

It's designed for advanced amateurs and professional users. It lacks many features of the double-digit Nikon dSLRs (d40/50/60/70/80/90), such as scene modes, in order to give controls that more advanced users find handy,  such as a button to set the ISO, rather than having to dive the menus.<br>  <br>  To be quite honest, it's a camera a beginner could be overwhelmed with, and have some serious buyer's remorse.<br>  <br>  That's not to say you can't learn, but realize that this is a serious tool for serious photographers, and it might not be as good a match for you as some other camera.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|24tOkze1aa	I have an OLDDDD Nikon Camera with A bunch of different lenses!

Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.<br>  <br>  Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.<br>  <br>  However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.<br>  <br>  Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.<br>  <br>  A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know. Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.<br>  <br>  Rootsweb and FamilySearch.org are 2 free sites but remember verify information in family trees with documents/records. If you don't you don't know whether it is accurate or not.
qUr5P7hgaa	I like it. I think of it differently then you do though... I think of a girl in a trapped loveless relationship until she find a man she truly loves and thinks about what life would be like without him and what life would be like if she stayed in her loveless relationship..

XvO4iLk0aa	G The current rate of depletion and change will result in hundreds of millions of people facing lack of water, food and space as the planet dries up and the oceans rise. Technology may be too late, or not. <br>  That is one of the main reasons SGI is pushing so hard to expand. More people need to be cleared of the delusions that have created, and are continuing to create these problems. Read the LDK. It is a start.<br>  Life Decryption Key-Shortest<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first decision is; do we want to control our lives, or rely on outside forces. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  This document is intended for those who want to control their lives and accept that causes produce effects. The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be based on what is pragmatically verifiable, yet universally true. <br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed as well in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life. <br>  <br>  This formulation serves as a life decryption key.<br>  Add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This, spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together, focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy. It works best when conducted together with other people, who are also trying to have great lives by training their mind-heart-bodies by using the LDK. <br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

This world has seen so much worse than it is seeing now, and the only reason it seems we are "doomed" is because the people nowadays are much, much more materialistic, so having to deal with the lack of high tech "necessities" is causing us to have a sort of withdrawal.

WZNaNvplaa	the British, and American point of view about Lusitania was that she was a passenger liner, and very obviously so. Since she was carrying civilians, they felt that Lusitania was not a valid target, and sinking her was a violation of the rules of war.<br>     The Germans, on the other hand, believed that the British were using the cover of civilian shipping to move armaments and other war supplies into England.  So Germany took the steps of announcing to all parties that the Lusitania was considered a valid target for German U-Boats. There was even a newspaper ad warning Americans that sailing on the ship might result in them being sunk. <br>     After the sinking, there was outrage on the Allied side over the loss of life. The ship did sink incredibly fast. The Germans pointed to both their prior warnings, and stated that the speed at which Lusitania sunk must have been caused by munitions illegally carried aboard her, and thus the rapid sinking was proof of their suspicions. The evidence to date seems to show that something other than munitions triggered the secondary explosion that sank the ship. However, the public outcry was so bad that the Germans canceled the policy of indiscriminate attacks on British ships.|`|lgwdJWgaaa	It was controversial on Germany's part because the Lusitania was a passenger ship meaning it was full of innocent people. But on the other hand the Germans only fired ONE torpedo and there were TWO explosions meaning there were explosives on the ship which was illegal.

But how?  Well, when it is in your mind, it remains subjective.  Once you communicate it, you make it an object of your communication, you "objectivize" it, you make it objective.

QyDo2pOYaa	the texas revolution.|`|kCSJyM8Laa	San Antonio and the Alamo played a critical role in the Texas Revolution. In December 1835, Ben Milam led Texian and Tejano volunteers against Mexican troops quartered in the city. After five days of house-to-house fighting, they forced General Marín Perfecto de Cós and his soldiers to surrender. The victorious volunteers then occupied the Alamo — already fortified prior to the battle by Cós' men — and strengthened its defenses.<br>  <br>  On February 23, 1836, the arrival of General Antonio López de Santa Anna's army outside San Antonio nearly caught them by surprise. Undaunted, the Texians and Tejanos prepared to defend the Alamo together. The defenders held out for 13 days against Santa Anna's army. William B. Travis, the commander of the Alamo sent forth couriers carrying pleas for help to communities in Texas. On the eighth day of the siege, a band of 32 volunteers from Gonzales arrived, bringing the number of defenders to nearly two hundred. Legend holds that with the possibility of additional help fading, Colonel Travis drew a line on the ground and asked any man willing to stay and fight to step over — all except one did. As the defenders saw it, the Alamo was the key to the defense of Texas, and they were ready to give their lives rather than surrender their position to General Santa Anna. Among the Alamo's garrison were Jim Bowie, renowned knife fighter, and David Crockett, famed frontiersman and former congressman from Tennessee.<br>  <br>  The final assault came before daybreak on the morning of March 6, 1836, as columns of Mexican soldiers emerged from the predawn darkness and headed for the Alamo's walls. Cannon and small arms fire from inside the Alamo beat back several attacks. Regrouping, the Mexicans scaled the walls and rushed into the compound. Once inside, they turned a captured cannon on the Long Barrack and church, blasting open the barricaded doors. The desperate struggle continued until the defenders were overwhelmed. By sunrise, the battle had ended and Santa Anna entered the Alamo compound to survey the scene of his victory.

They found it inefficient because it took too long and used a lot of petrol.<br>  <br>  Zyklon B caused suffocation and panic usually ensued as people found they could not breathe.  Many times the gas chamber doors would be piled high with bodies as people tried to escape and many people were trampled in the panic.  <br>  <br>  Gas is not a pleasant way to die no matter what kind of gas is used.|`|W1XZ4kAVaa	well i think what they did was that they gased yout and then like your chest started hurting and then you just fell and you passed away|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	The gasses of choice to the Nazis were cyanide (Zyklon B, an insecticide) and phosgene.  Both were easily produced in quantity at a very low price.  And both cause an agonizing and painful death.  Death takes 5 to 15 minutes where the victim literally drowns in their own blood as the alveoli rupture allowing blood (pulmonary edema) to enter the lungs.  Don't confuse it with nitrous oxide at the dentist's office.<br>  <br>  Cyanide interferes with the body's ability to absorb oxygen.  Imagine being able to draw in lungs full of air but getting nothing from it.  As the body violently tries to extract oxygen from the air, breathing becomes deeper and more panicked, resulting in alveolar rupture and literally drowning in your own pulmonary edema.<br>  <br>  Phosgene, also known as mustard gas, burns the airways in the lungs, causing direct alveolar rupture and drowning in pulmonary edema.  Even in very light concentrations, phosgene is extremely irritating to the mucosa -- think pepper spray times 100 -- and very painful.  In lethal concentrations the agony on a scale of 1 to 10 is probably somewhere around 1000.|`|XqS5DxR9aa	I spent my formative years as a guest of Mr. Hitler at one of his "resort" camps.

If you are going to develop it yourself, you would need to make sure it is "true" black&white film (developed in regular black & white chemistry)  Since you are going to have a lab develop it, you would probably have an easier time using either regular color film, or "chromogenic" or "C-41" black and white film, which is actually a color film that only records B&W images.  <br>  <br>  Q. Does cutting the film disable it from being developed at a local store?<br>  A. Yes.  If you have a fairly long strip still intact, some stores will develop it, but not all.  And if you only have a short strip, like a few inches in length, it probably won't work in a machine and would need to be done by hand.  <br>  <br>  What you might do instead of cutting the film is pulling out the leader and taping it to the camera, but with the film canister still attached to it, maybe off to the side so it won't obstruct the exposure.  That way you can wind the film back into the canister when you're done exposing and take the whole roll to get developed.  If you do that, you might need something bigger than a juice box so there's room for the film canister.
40c85b996c134163f45223b2c362cd80aa	Yes and no. <br>  <br>  They weren't above using tactics that are vicious by our standards (such as attacking churches and undefended monestaries), but their opponents could be just as vicious.  <br>  <br>  For instance, the viking Sven Forkbeard only attacked England after the Anglo-Saxon King Ethred the Unready ordered the St. Brice's Day Massacre of "all the Danish men (women and children) who were in England" in 1002.  Ethnic cleansing wasn't an invention of the 20th century!  Among the atrocities committed that day, a group of Danes took refuge in a church in Oxford which was then burned down around them.  The dead included Sven's sister Gunhilde.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, several specific practices attributed to the Vikings cannot be proven to have even been committed and appear to be the fabrication of later writers - this includes the infamous "blood eagle" method of execution.<br>  <br>  Also, we have copies of various Viking-era Norse law codes and these serve to balance the view of Norse life.  Some things do seem "vicious" like the fact that a man convicted of murder was made an outlaw and as a outlaw anyone could kill him on sight without reprecussion.  The flipside is that were strong legal provisions to compensate the family of someone who was killed accidentally which shows a sense of compassion.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Worse - but then they settled down and were assimilated.  End of the Vikings!|`|jvPToF4Laa	The people who were writing about the attacks were Christian churchmen, monks and priests. Not too many others were literate at that time.<br>  <br>     The Vikings picked on churches to loot, because that was where the money was, and churches were poorly defended. It is not hard to see why the only writers of the time complained, when they were being picked on especially.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, they established colonies in Ireland, Canute conquered and held much on northern Europe, and they had long lived kingdoms. Not too bloodthirsty sounding to me.

QAvuORejaa	That sounds like it sucks. I would be devastated if anyone started copying one of my characters and claimed it as their own. It happens, so stay strong and don't show her that you're upset. Since you sit beside this friend, talk to her. Ask how the characters she drew came to be. If yours was original you'd have a back story for it right? If she claims that she made them herself, ask her to show you|`|wrI7VwmLaa	I'm sorry, but do you even know grammar?  It was hard to even tell what you were trying to ask, seeing as how it's just one long sentence.<br>  <br>  If someone is copying your drawings, then maybe they admire you or your artwork.  Grow up.|`|P5oNOdS1aa	Don't ask her to stop, it's fine if she wants to draw anime too. You obviously copied someone else at drawing anime first, so you did the exact same thing as her. Be glad you inspired her to draw.|`|kr34vLJkaa	What?  You think this is bad?<br>  Imitation is one of the highest forms of flattery.  She isn’t trying to steal anything, but she does admire you.  So, if you want to abuse her for her admiration then what does that make you?  Rather, bring her closer and draw together.  Think of what you can learn together.  There is one fact in life, and that is that we are all connected.  Stop being selfish and all the emotions and actions that that one character trait spawns.|`|d7ditT4Iaa	Tell her its your drawings and that its really rude to steal other peoples ideas.curse at her,do anything|`|rwtiLgH1aa	I would actually be flattered if someone was fond of my drawing style and trying to imitate it. It would be nice to have a friend who likes drawing also. <br>  <br>  If I were you I would get over your own pride, and try to become closer with her and don't be afraid to draw together and help each other, but ask her to give you some credit since your kind of her teacher.|`|bU6jX38Vaa	my advice to you is that you don't have to draw when she's around because if she know and found out that you are drawing then she will take the credit out of your work. Just keep your drawing out of her cite and keep it safe somewhere where your friend cannot able to know or find, only you are able to know. Don't tell anyone about it if you do then they will tell your friend and she will definitely going take your work that you love.

If you had a TON of money, and could afford a $35,000 all-gold Brannen - it still would be the WRONG flute for someone your age.

1hvrQYWiaa	2 main aims, one domestic, one foreign.<br>   Domestically, Henry was desperate to have a legitimate son to secure the future of the Tudor dynasty (his father took the crown by force from Richard III, last Plantagenet king).<br>   Foreign policy - England had been out of mainstream European affairs for over 50 years when Henry became king. He described himself as "A little king in a corner" in terms of foreign prestige and influence. So,in the early years of his reign he wanted to make England an important European power again. To this end he invaded France, had a war with Scotland, joined alliances such as the Holy League to try to make England more powerful in Europe.
ciz0qYwnaa	By 'Russian style' do you mean the Vaganova method? <br>  <br>  Anyways, your studio should be able to help you out there. Most studios help their advanced students go onto more prestigious and 'better' schools. If you find a larger studio that is affiliated with a ballet company, all the better. It doesn't matter if the studio is an hour or so away from where you live. There's a girl in my class who has to wake up at 9am to get to her classes at 11:30am. You have to have passion for ballet, without it you won't reach anywhere. <br>  <br>  There are also certain companies (near me there is the National Ballet of Canada and Les grands ballets canadiens that I know of) that offer apprentice programs. This is usually the first step to becoming a professional. You spend the year with the dance company and, if you're good enough, maybe they'll offer you a job in the corps. <br>  <br>  There are many others ways to go pro, but check with your studio first. Your teachers are bound to have some sort of experience : )|`|uYJdvnqxaa	You need to go to a very professional studio.<br>  One that really knows what they're doing.<br>  And you need to be dancing several hours a week.<br>  So it might be time to leave the small studio behind.<br>  It's all about auditions,competitions,meeting the right people,etc...<br>  So once you move to the new studio,ask your instructor the steps you need to do,how to get where you need to be,etc..|`|XNNjFb4Laa	If you stay at a studio it is wise to find one that has a former professional ballerina as your instructor. If you can find such a studio, you really need to dance every day for several hours (at least 2) if you want a chance at an audition. <br>  If you want a more sure way of getting a job, I suggest you find the nearest ballet company and see if they offer classes, or if there is a school that they prefer to accept students from.<br>  Most companies (including the one I dance for) will offer the students small parts in performances or make them understudies. <br>  Once you have done this in a few years you can audition for corps de ballet. Dedication is the key to becoming a professional ballet dancer.

It doesn't really have to be anything life changing .

I guess its normal to fear the unwalked roads in life but its sure does make life more sweeter.

tsjLHXzUaa	No.  They're not.<br>  <br>  Its human nature to have your own taste and preference... not everyone is attracted to the same type of people.<br>  <br>  Beleive it or not, there is no objective definition of feminine sex appeal. Does that insult you? It does most women... to tug the rug out from under them... undermine their entire view of male-predictability... forcing them to question their own belief that they can meet what it takes to "be sexy". Most women want to believe there is a single explicit definition of sex appeal... it gives them something to work toward, justifies their lack of self-esteem, and above all strokes their ego when they believe they meet the standard.  If men have different tastes in women, women have no reason to try, no reason to sexually objectify themselves any more... and certainly no standard to meet... how then can they have self-confidence?<br>  <br>  Are all women attracted to the same type of guy?<br>  <br>  I recommend not being so stereotypical and sexist...<br>  <br>  What makes you think that being fat as a horse isnt more naturally healthy and a better indication of reproductive ability?  What you think of as the standard now is jsut a social construct.  What makes fat women nowadays unhealthy isnt the fact that they are fat... but why they are.... the doughnut-based glutenous diet, and the slovenly couch-potato lifestyles... that is why they are unhealthy and unattractive... not the mere fact that they have a thorough supply of burnable food storage.<br>  <br>  Evolutionarily speaking, fatter women have always been regarded as more attractive... they burn less energy for the same work (efficient), and store more for winter like a good squirrel... perfect.  As society evolved and the needs have changed, particularly in this post-renaissance industrial age, there was less and less need for fat storage.  Those women who were fat ended up being tooo fat, and for unhealthy reasons... and above all the excess weight itself proved to be the greater disadvantage in the long run.  But again, its a social construct, not a universal truth and certainly not a biological fact... So what is male opinion driven by?  Im sure a combination of social and biological factors, and without consistency.<br>  <br>  ====<br>  <br>  I never said that my statement wasnt stereotypical... but did I make my point?<br>  <br>  Why are you defending fat women now when you originally questioned the mentality of the men who like them?<br>  <br>  <br>  ====<br>  <br>  I asked a question a while back on why "its okay for men to like breasts, but not okay for men to like feet".  It was a question about sexual quirks... and societies acceptance of some of them as standard, expected, and natural... while society rejects others offhand as gross perversions.<br>  <br>  I believe the BA (voted) on that question was something to the effect of "feet and such are not sexual objects to begin with, while breasts are".<br>  <br>  Anyway... to combine that question with yours... fat isnt a sexual object either, so why should sex appeal be based off of it?<br>  <br>  Why is it okay for men to like thin women and not fat women?  Why is it okay for men to *not like* fat women, but not okay for men to like feet?  Or any other combination you can think of.  Of all the things men like and men dont like (stereotypically), why is it such a shock to find variation? Why is it so insulting and why should it be so "wrong". I think I already answered that in my first paragraph.|`|44ujDxwqaa	No..<br>  <br>  What about women who like fat men? i am one of them.. i think they are cute and cuddly.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Men have been attracted to Rubenesque women throughout human history. The ancient Greeks and the moderns (late 20th century) are the only exceptions. What they share in common is an extraordinarily high standard of living (the Greeks for example had 100 slaves to every man woman and child who were citizens)<br>  <br>  Finding anorexic women appealing is just an upper middle class phenomenon. Once the middle class vanishes (FOREVER?) the interest in gaunt women will fade away. And Greek art will look funny again.|`|AA10729675	The two are unrelated.  Evolution is one thing, and taste is another thing.<br>  Men have their own tastes, and women have their own tastes.<br>  It is as simple as that.<br>  If everyone had the same taste, it would be boring, so I think.|`|QAwwmDuDaa	That's just not true,in Neolithic times big women were considered as the best child bearers and so were more desirable,good child baring hips you see.|`|c7pbvYmpaa	It is their nature to like what they like|`|rxItXYk8aa	wow, that really got me thinking(:<br>  I think that male genes are all different.  Some men may have a gene where they like the extra meat, and some men might prefer a slimmer figure.  These genes are passed down.  For example, on Oprah I saw that in Mauritania, men love bigger women.  Skinny woman are considered disgusting, in a sense.  If these men moved to America, they'd like the same type of girl, and that would influence their children into it (i'm guessing).<br>  Now, if an American moved to Mauritania, he'd most likely seek out a slimmer woman.<br>  Human nature is all about genes and influence.  It's the decsisions made around you that shape you. It's not human nature to prefer slimmer woman.<br>  I hope I answered your question right... I might've gone a little off topic :/|`|XfSJZCEyaa	Well there is more to attraction than mere bodyweight. <br>  <br>  Whether we decide to be with someone depends on:<br>  1) their kindness; a giving personality is better able to raise offsprings<br>  2) facial features; females with bigger eyes and rounder faces have more estrogen<br>  <br>  3) fat women have energy reserves, and thus have enough nutrients not to compromise the baby's development<br>  <br>  4) Fat women signify living in an abundance of food. So if a person has abundance of food, they would probably make good providers for the offsprings.<br>  <br>  5) lastly, status. Whether you're fat or skinny, status means you are worthy in the community, and thus have certain power. Power usually means your offsprings will have privileges and higher chance of survival.|`|caH2oKsHaa	Ive never heard for a gene that codes for like or dislike towards fat people. The mechanism by which somebody chooses a mate may be of many different factors coming together. However, there is definitely an innate preference for a specific body type that has arisen from evolution. For example, studies have shown that a very specific hip to waist ratio is more attractive to men than all other ratios, but this isnt set in stone. That being said a woman who is fat, but with certain proportions, might be more attractive than another woman with other proportions, or one who is even skinner.|`|d265DZbHaa	No - indeed, it is an evolutionary advantage to be over weight. This is because for six million years of our evolution food was difficult to come by. So a woman who carried their reserves on their body was good breed stock.<br>  <br>  It is indeed the person who is unable to put weight on that is the genetic mutation.|`|63W48oo6aa	What you like or any other person likes depends on you or there taste.  For example, in Africa the men like the bigger woman because they are believed to be more fertile which means better babies for them.  <br>  That could be why (stereotypically speaking) African Americans present day like the girls that have a lot more to offer than most.  <br>  Who knows? There is never really one answer for this type of thing because everyone has there own opinions :-) Hope that helped :-O<br>  <br>  -Momo~*|`|8ekoa6szaa	That is a ridiculous statement.  We are what we are and I'd rather be fat that bulimic any day.  Women who look like concentration camp survivors are in as much trouble physically as are their fat sisters.  <br>  <br>  Being too fat, or being too skinny, is not healthy, male or female.|`|DeLeJZyDaa	Actually men are attracted to a certain hips to waist ratio. Whether their society is attracted to smaller or bigger women all societies around the world find this ration the most attractive.

oCC9UhLJaa	Like a lot of poems this one though seemingly simple is again open-ended ( at least in my belief :) )<br>  <br>  Instead of directly jumping onto the meaning of the last two lines, may I please give my interpretation of the whole poem ?<br>  <br>  It starts off with the impersonation of "HOPE" and how aptly given the form of a bird. A bird, the tune of which keeps you going, alternatively, hope never failing you and never expecting anything back from the receiver of it.<br>  <br>  On retrospect, the last stanza specially sounds "past-tense-like". <br>  <br>  You have heard the tune of the bird-shaped-hope in situations as portrayed by chillest land and strangest sea, but none of them were extreme enough to have bashed your bird down, without asking anything ever from you ( probably because even a bird needs crumbs to survive upon ); and now that it has been though( probably by the unfortunate storm ), her feathers now stand tattered.
mFSXWmyjaa	I use to work at Guitar Center.<br>  <br>  The first thing they will ask you is, "How much were you looking for."<br>  <br>  Do NOT say, "I want the most I can get." They will then reply something like, "Ok, I'll give you $5!"<br>  <br>  They do this to break you down.<br>  <br>  Tell them you want $600 or $550 for it, make them barter with you. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd put the guitar on Craig's List so you could get the most money out of it.<br>  <br>  Guitar Center will usually try to give 1/4 of what the guitar is worth. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|W1h3w5gdaa	Don't even define a range. Establish your price, something you have settles on as the guitar's real value. (For your guitar, I wouldn't trade it in for less that $535.)<br>  <br>  1) Walk in.<br>  <br>  2) Tell them you will sell them the guitar for that price. <br>  <br>  3) If they try to haggle, walk out. <br>  <br>  Sell it on eBay, at flea market, use Craigslist. You'll definitely get more money this way, since Guitar Center's not just buying the guitar. They're also buying a profit margin that you pay for.<br>  <br>  You have myriad options; don't settle for some wannabe slickster sales dude at Guitar Center.|`|nDcSY8UQaa	not much. I got a 58 byrdland that I can play anything with because I know how to play, wonder what guitar center would give me for that?

ceBTTCPwaa	The Grapes of Wrath is a novel published in 1939 and written by John Steinbeck, who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize for Literature. It is frequently read in American high school and college literature classes. A celebrated Hollywood film version, starring Henry Fonda and directed by John Ford, was made in 1940; however, the endings of the book and the movie differ greatly.<br>  <br>  Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath at his home, 16250 Greenwood Lane, in what is now Monte Sereno, California. Set during the Great Depression, the novel focuses on a poor family of sharecroppers, the Joads, driven from their home by drought, economic hardship, and changes in the agriculture industry. In a nearly hopeless situation, they set out for California's Central Valley along with thousands of other "Okies" in search of land, jobs, and dignity.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/grapesofwr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/grapesofwr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/TheGrapesofWra..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/TheGrapesofWra...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/TheGrapesofWra..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/TheGrapesofWra...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/G..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/G...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/grapes2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/grapes2.html</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	[Casy:] "They's gonna come somepin outa all these folks goin'  ...  wes' – outa all their farms lef' lonely.

NBBRWd5Gaa	i used to, but not any more, i learned to be more open minded over the years and not judge people based on their appearance.  i realized that someone's integrity and character had nothing to do with tattoo's and piercings.  it's like how some people tend to shy away from those who do not believe in God.  this fear is blind and unfounded, and to have it is prejudice.  however when it comes to certain professions, i agree with the need for maintaining a professional appearance which would mean covering up your tattoos and piercings, otherwise, you might not get taken seriously or get the respect you deserve.  it's biased and unfair, but it's the way things are right now.|`|FoIxsunVaa	After seeing movies from the Holocaust several times, and the serial number tattoos and the lampshades made out of tattooed human skin, I get grossed out at the mere sight of them.

If you were a criminal you got a tat as I sign saying in essence "I am tough.  Leave me alone. Don't mess with me."  If  you had served in the military, you usually got one while drunk and regretted it the rest of your life.  Tats were not socially accepted then and they are not accepted now.  Those with tats have for years been criminals, bikers belonging to gangs or trashy people.  You would not see anyone with any class in an evening gown in which a tattoo was showing.

No noble person would be associated with it. But now a days everyone can get or give a tattoo. But still the psyhcological mindset that a tattoo or pericing is someting evil is still programed into a lot of peoples brains. Its just how they were raised.

W1h3w5gdaa	Most people don't know this, but Epiphone used to be its own company and competed with Gibson. Somewhere along the line, Gibson bought Epiphone. <br>  <br>  This is important because it is NOT like Fender's Squire line of guitars. Squires are crap because they're designed to be crap. They are an entry-level brand conceived of by Fender (well, made from a purchased string company called Squire) so they could mass market to the Wal-Mart oriented shopping public.<br>  <br>  Epiphone, however, has a long and rich tradition of guitar crafting, and is a very reliable brand. The difference between Epiphone and Gibson branded units is pretty slight, and is not worth the markup. With Gibson, you're paying at least 30% for the writing on the headstock. Which is kinda dumb if you ask me.<br>  <br>  So if you weren't 100% sure about Epi before, I hope you are now. :)<br>  <br>  That's a decent model you're looking at there, but don't buy off the Internet. The same rule applies: go shopping. Play some guitars, and buy the one you fall in love with. Not one "just like it" but that exact one.<br>  <br>  It is untrue that any guitar will last if you take good care of it. Some guitars (*cough* *cough* *SQUIRE* *cough*) just die because they get old and the mechanics aren't designed to hold tension correctly. <br>  <br>  The Epi you're looking at, however, is not one of those guitars and should provide you with a few decades of good play.<br>  <br>  Happy hunting!|`|681bw4g0aa	yeh but u should be able to get it cheaper|`|KBBonf97aa	Epiphone Les Pauls are fantastic guitars.  They're built like rocks, sound amazing, and play just like their more expensive Gibson cousins.  Since you already know you want a Les Paul, the one you've chosen is an excellent choice.<br>  <br>  I've always been partial to Fenders because I've got really small hands and find it's easier to move around between notes and chords comfortably on thin necks.  A couple years ago, I bought an Epiphone Les Paul Jr. because it was on sale for $99 and I just had an itch to buy a new guitar.  Because it was so cheap, I expected it to be a glorified toy, but it's actually a great guitar.  I've used it for live shows as well as recording and it hasn't given me a moment of trouble.  I've played friends' higher-end Epiphone Les Pauls, as well, and they're beautiful.  If you choose any guitar from Epiphone's Les Paul line, you'll have a great guitar that will serve you well for decades.  And since they play just like Gibsons, you won't have to worry about "outgrowing" your guitar.  You have great taste.  Enjoy your new guitar!|`|qif1TQtnaa	yes, a guitar will last forever if you treat it right. why epiphones' les pauls are a fourth of the price of gibsons, i do not know.

W1h3w5gdaa	George Harrison wrote the song, words and all, and as he was a very accomplished and brilliant musician, this song is somewhat complex.

Nothing spectacularly difficult, but you would need to already be pretty familiar with scales. Otherwise, it'll be a long, painstaking process. <br>  <br>  The song is in 4/4, but there's also a wacky rhythmic shift in the bridge that changes the time signature every measure:  6/8 - 5/8 - 4/4 - 7/8 (x3.) Just another testament to George's genius.<br>  <br>  Blackbird, oddly, was not written by Harrison, but by McCartney.

Earth has a countdown timer of 4 billion years. That may seem very distant. But what will happen then? Life as we know it will be completely nonexistent. The great world of Man will collapse. But not if we do something about it. I want to guarantee interstellar travel to let the human race inhabit many more systems, so that if something happens to Earth, the human race does not fall with it.<br>  <br>  3) Humanity has a problem with dealing with disagreement. War results in not just permanent hate and disgust, but also many lives, all of which are forgotten in a second generation. I believe all arguments can be settled without war. In order to reinforce this, I wish to have the world blanketed under one government. This is not the same idea as conquering the world. This means that a single government rises to power, eventually having the world, but without the loss of a single life.<br>  <br>  4) Language has always been a huge drawback to this world. Misunderstanding or failure to interpret have resulted becuase of diverse language. My goal, therefore, is to teach the entire upcoming generation Latin, the language upon many more have sprouted. I hope that all other languages can diminish, but that may be asking too much. If the Latin idea works well, it could be made international law that every know the language.<br>  <br>  5) I am a puzzler. I love puzzles. I have solved every single purchasable puzzle, and used a computer-simulation to solve all the others. In other words, I have managed to solve all of the world's puzzles. My goal is to construct the Ultimate Puzzle, the one that is possible, yet no one can solve. This may seem like it's the easiest of the goals, but by far, it's the hardest.

cxDbdhELaa	Science rests upon wisdom.  Science is a "Chip Off The Ol' Block" of wisdom.<br>  <br>  Were it not for man's love of wisdom, science would die.  Wisdom is in science, indirectly.|`|t5Nrj6Txaa	Without science, wisdom has no hands.  Without wisdom, science has no purpose.|`|Om7OhWRUaa	I don't think so. It seems that science provides us with information that we can use to form and evaluate our wisdom, but contains none in and of itself.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...no, science is exact no leeway to slip in some philosophy of life...|`|az2ZBy3iaa	Wisdom is usually defined in terms of knowledge in the fields of religion, ethics, history, and philosophy.Science includes physics, chemistry, biology, etc. So as you can see, the two fields do not overlap.|`|VgdytFTzaa	i think so..|`|FoIxsunVaa	No scientist ever says "I am going to prove 1+1=2." Scientists, at least the real ones, imagine a new idea, way of being, possibility and then investigate it. This process of intuition is neither scientific nor is it practical. But the whole advance of science, the whole possibility of better things and ideas rests upon it. A true scientist has the wisdom to step out of what is known and open themselves up to new ways of understanding.<br>  <br>  In THAT there is much wisdom and humility.|`|c7pbvYmpaa	The more you know, the less you know...because the more you know, the more questions you ask, and it never ends. Science is only a fraction of wisdom.
4jyAH75vaa	try practicing in front of a mirror- if your body is tensing up without you noticing, seeing yourself while you play will make you aware when you do, and you'll be able to correct yourself.<br>  <br>  Also handle the guitar when you're not playing.  Just walk around with it with the strap on, or when you're sitting watching TV hold it as if you were playing.  This will train your body to be at ease with the instrument in hand.<br>  <br>  And also, relax!  If your shoulders are tensing up and you're playing too fast, it might just be nerves, I play too fast when I'm nervous as well.|`|VCvfJvTcaa	It's just something you have to teach your body not to do.

eezP5wQ2aa	...death and taxes are facts...<br>  ...every thing else is how you make it...|`|CLB32006aa	I think about that all the time, what if WE are just characters in another beings dream, or imagination. What if our consciousnesses are just electronic impulses being generated in some simulated reality. My feeling is that despite life's uncertainty the only thing we can do is make the best of whatever this existence really is.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Keep thinking :)|`|dlGP3iZ6aa	I'm not sure I understand your question.  First, instead of "fragment" I think you mean "figment."  "Fragment" means that reality is part of our imagination, where what you seem to mean is the possibility that reality is just something we made up along the way.<br>  <br>  I think it is fair to say that if there were no thinkers, that there would still be a universe.  If humans perished, then it is possible that everything would remain standing.  The difference, however, is that things wouldn't have meanings.  A certain structure that was once recognized as a "chair" would become just a lump of matter that has no meaning for anyone.<br>  <br>  I have no idea what you mean by "we all know by now that our thoughts dreams and desired manifest int our future, into how we perceive things."  We think about the future, and plan for it, and this in some way colors the way we see things.  I look at a bank and see it as "a place I will go to tomorrow." However, this does not mean that the bank is ONLY something I think about, and that it has no reality outside of our thoughts.  Regardless of whether I (or anyone) think about the world and its contents, it will continue to be there even without us.<br>  <br>  It's part of who we are to place meaning on things, and some meanings that we have we did not create ourselves: a smell that reminds us of grandma's baking, a song that reminds us of a person.  These are not things we choose, but meanings that happen to us; they are passively acquired without our choice (this is what the existentialists overlook).  <br>  <br>  We sometimes tend to be excessive in how we understand the world.  Sometimes we take the world more seriously than we take ourselves.  This does not mean we or the world are any less real.  It just means we have to re-evaluate our relationship to it.  Whether "God" has anything to do with it is really a matter of taste.<br>  <br>  Regards.|`|oylb7RNBaa	What are you talking about? It's all about my well-being!<br>  <br>  But that's exactly true, to me, but not to you. Yes, the world is part of our imagination, to be more specific, the INPUT part. Then our reality is whatever we process the world as individually. Believe it or not, everyone's thought processes are completely diverse. Nothing could be as unique, except of course the statue of a cyclops Peter got with Meg's pension money.<br>  {Run video="FamGuy-Ep344-Flashback3" Target="Self"}|`|XfSJZCEyaa	No i don't think we have that much power. We are merely beings existing in the universe, end of story. <br>  <br>  It may be possible that there is no meaning at all. We're just here because we are. Maybe God just found it boring to have this huge universe without anything moving around and doing things. <br>  <br>  Like how when you get an empty fish tank, and just feel that maybe you should put some fish in there.|`|az2ZBy3iaa	We understand the world through our perception of it. There is no way for us to input information other than through our sensory organs. Therefore, the universe technically only exists in our minds.|`|B3nl3A1saa	"Existence exists—and the act of grasping that statement implies two corollary axioms: that something exists which one perceives and that one exists possessing consciousness, consciousness being the faculty of perceiving that which exists.<br>  <br>  If nothing exists, there can be no consciousness: a consciousness with nothing to be conscious of is a contradiction in terms. A consciousness conscious of nothing but itself is a contradiction in terms: before it could identify itself as consciousness, it had to be conscious of something. If that which you claim to perceive does not exist, what you possess is not consciousness.<br>  <br>  Whatever the degree of your knowledge, these two—existence and consciousness—are axioms you cannot escape, these two are the irreducible primaries implied in any action you undertake, in any part of your knowledge and in its sum, from the first ray of light you perceive at the start of your life to the widest erudition you might acquire at its end. Whether you know the shape of a pebble or the structure of a solar system, the axioms remain the same: that IT exists and that YOU know it.<br>  <br>  To exist is to be something, as distinguished from the nothing of nonexistence, it is to be an entity of a specific nature made of specific attributes. Centuries ago, the man who was—no matter what his errors —the greatest of your philosophers, has stated the formula defining the concept of existence and the rule of all knowledge: A is A. A thing is itself. Existence is Identity, Consciousness is Identification.<br>  <br>  Whatever you choose to consider, be it an object, an attribute, or an action, the law of identity remains the same. a leaf cannot be a stone at the same time. It cannot be all red & all green at the same time. It cannot freeze & burn at the same time.<br>  <br>  A is A."|`|AA11342530	If everything is a fantasy and we are all mind decived by a dream so complex and real alike then theres no way that we can be "awakened" and see the "truth".

az2ZBy3iaa	That would be a bad idea. As romantic as the idea sounds, our society is built on order and structure. Even if certain processes (such as the legal process) may seem inefficient or unnecessary, they undoubtedly benefit the society as a whole by providing a standard procedure that everyone can go through. Costumed heroes may seem efficient, etc, but having these people operating outside the normal boundaries of human law is dangerously anarchistic.|`|bdttDnlwaa	Well, the World is all ready made of fully dressed Heroes, because of the many Countries, and diversity of Cultures, and all the Ceremonials, Festivities, and Rituals, not necessarily Religious, that inhabit and nurture those Cultures.<br>  <br>  One has also to bear in mind that not every one likes Hero types. <br>  It would be a bit too overwhelming and overbearing.<br>  <br>  Having said that, if Humanity continues to unveil like this the true secret of what it is to have Power, for the benefit of all, then a great number of us are actually Heroes in formation. <br>  <br>  But think also  that in Times to come, there could be nobody that needs to be rescued anyway. <br>  Unless if by then, we have made the passage into the Multi Dimensional reality, and we go back in Time.<br>  <br>  It is quite possible.<br>  <br>  It is possible that our Heroes are us in the future.<br>  <br>  Take care.|`|yr0UZVZAaa	No, because then there would be costumed villains as well.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...they are actors and wouldn't know what is real...|`|CI3PEjOTaa	hmmmm.... i dunno i don't really think so. imagine allways having to wear a tight suit, stockings and an anoying cape 24/7.... imagine having to see some ppl wear that, the thought makes me gag. ok u r now officaly responsible for a very disturbing image in my head. oh gosh yuck, thx alot man!

obpDap72aa	If you really want this part, then I would send a small letter of apology and specify that I unfortunately forgot to dress the part, but I am very interested in the part that I auditioned for.

I would recommend sending her a brief email, if you have her email address. Anything more than that would be unnecessary.

wX0rAXOYaa	Play with the lighting for the second picture, and with the hue/saturation for the first. <br>  <br>  I don't have Photoshop 7, but I assume the controls are pretty much the same on all versions of Photoshop. In my version (CS2), you go to image >> adjustments >> Brightness/Contrast (or Shadow/Highlight, or Curves, or Levels or Hue/Saturation, or Variations).<br>  <br>  Regarding other tips: Always make your edits on a copy of the original photo; that way, if you mess up and cannot undo the changes anymore, you will still have the original to fall back on. Also, play around with filters to give photos different looks. Use brushes to add stamp-like images to your photos (you can download free brushes from brusheezy.com).

Some of us don't.|`|CLB32006aa	First of all not all atheists are subjectivists, secondly there is no way that you make all of your decisions entirely based off of scriptural guidance, you must make some based on logic, common sense, feelings for others. If you concede that you do make moral decisions that are not 100% based on what god would do then you are proof in point that morality is possible without god. If you think that if god ceased to exist that you would immediately go out and start raping women and killing people then you are making a unfalsifiable claim and on top of that a ridiculous one.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Keep thinking :)|`|UDQqY3pHaa	God is not the final arbiter of "goodness' or ethical behavior. If He was then we would have to resort to asking Him for guidance whenever we have a thorny ethical dilemma to decide, which we cannot. Everyone who  prays knows that God does not literally speak to us but rather prayer is a for of reflection that allows us to wok through the pros and cons of each issue as it arises. Reason is the final arbiter of ethics or 'goodness'.<br>  <br>  <br>  God in fact cannot be the final arbiter because He too must resort to some sort of reasoning through of ethical issues If He doesn't then his brand of 'goodness, must by definition be arbitrary which it cannot be.<br>  If we accept the arbitrary nature of God's 'goodness'  then we would be permitted to model God's practice and use any means at our disposal to decide goodness, arbitrary or not, like a coin toss.|`|Om7OhWRUaa	Perhaps not "God", but some kind of objective grounding *is* necessary if you want to use the word "moral" and have it imply a systematic behavioral code. The random and greatly varying systems that individuals come up with for themselves cannot rightly be called "morality".|`|c7pbvYmpaa	What is good to one is bad to another|`|BVf2eAWnaa	I don't really think there is something absolute good. Good is learned through social conditioning. So even if we have no God it seems we will learn what is considered preferrable/unpreferrable.  <br>  <br>  I don't think any actions are good if you include the reasons for acting in such and such way. The action can be conisdered good according to the religious/social standards, but the reasons for acting good aren't really good (not selfless/ there's always a reason).|`|0lEdqFlVaa	If there was no god we would be savages still. if you look at the American justice system and laws it is based on the ten commandments. Nothing in the bible says you can't go to heaven by doing only good things, quite the opposite. All it says is that You have to accept Jesus Christ into your heart and life, nothing less nothing more. Any bad is punished here unless you don't believe. Even if we created a god by our own imagination at least it gave us motivation to live. Just thank God that you have something called freedom of will.|`|d265DZbHaa	We do not need any supernatural threat to keep us in line. This is shown by Buddhism, which does not have a god yet are very moral.<br>  <br>  To add superstition to morality is just about social control not morality. <br>  <br>  ...And what happens when people see though the con that is all deistic religion? It will completely undermine the basis for the moral control. This will happen more and more as people become educated, they will reject the obvious political control that is Christianity, Islam, Judaism etc. <br>  <br>  So It is now imperative that morality is formulated, not from the archaic and social control religions to a secular and person centred morality.<br>  <br>  ...And as this question is razed in philosophy this is a great place to start as it is the home of morality, where as R&S is the center of oppression.|`|AA11342530	Who says that they aren't kept out? Nobody knows how that next place works and when he does it's too late!<br>  For most people doing the wrong thing is more charming. Good deeds are too boring! There is a percentage that is swept by the public opinions and as they feel like doing the right thing they finaly tend to do the worst. And finally the "good" people are thiose who are never visible to that public eye and you will never hear of them.<br>  God isn't needed for good. Man is programmed for excitement and good is too boring. If you reprograme everything will be GOOD! <br>  I think..!|`|uHgp5tebaa	One would like to think that no, we don't.<br>  However, we all know that there are those of us who need extra 'incentive' to behave and be good people; often, fellow human beings cannot provide this.

tsjLHXzUaa	You cant change your gender, and have no ethical right to try.  You can try to make yourself look however you like... but it wont change what you are.<br>  <br>  As for your remark on "You pretty much can do anything a boy can do, and still look good doing it"... I find that this is not a healthy remark....<br>  <br>  Whether or not someone "looks good" is not dependent on their gender... its dependent on other peoples attraction to them.  I suspect that I, as a man, look great to women doing what I do.  Just as a girl looks great to a guy, doing what she does.  Its not a gender thing... its a sexually attractive thing... which the observer decides, not the person being observed.<br>  <br>  I find your remark perverse.  Youre not interested in being a woman, youre interested in being a sex object... you want attention... this is typical of most all male to female transvestites... its not about sexual identity for you, its a perverse need for sexual attention.  Try a little domination by women, you might get your kicks just the same.  Quite frequently psychologists will determine that a male is just twisted and not really transsexual.  After all, if you think women "look good" doing anything, you sound like you appreciate women enough to be a straight man... you cannot be attracted to women and want to be a woman... (what would that make you? A lesbian in a mans body?)|`|d265DZbHaa	No god = no problem. Any question that presupposes the existence of a god is highly questionable. It certainly is not philosophy.<br>  <br>  Our sex is determined by biological and environmental factors.

I mean after all God,based on this logic, already predetermined that someone should be born with a physical problem. <br>  <br>  You maybe a true transsexual, or just a transvestite, so go to a psychologist and find out. <br>  <br>  On a side note, one of the other answerers said no one has an ethical right to change their gender but offers no argument to back it up. Anyone can just make a statement and say that is the way it is but that's not philosophy. I hold it's ethical to do anything that makes you happy as long as it does not physically harm another. Basically it's ethical to do anything you want as you don't don't use force or fraud. it would be unethical for anyone to stop you from doing what would make you happy. This is not saying that you're a transsexual --you still need to go a psychologist and work on these issues.|`|APAPoOQwaa	gender isn't predetermined<br>  and i think you should stick with being a guy.

Empire have come into existence for a whole variety of reasons.<br>  <br>  The key is acceptance.  If people can be persuaded to accept the reality of an empire, then it will survive.

Sometimes both are present, and empires evolve through time.<br>  <br>  It's certainly true that some of the harshest and most militant empires have failed due to the opposition getting their act together, and turning the vast discontent into support.

Certainly art and theater spread throughout the Roman Empire, as evidenced by widespread Roman theaters and artwork all over Europe.  The ancient Olympics never left Greece, though Greece did become part of Rome, so it is likely that the games would have gained some fame throughout the Empire.

Agents ONLY make money when you do (10% for film/tv/commercials, 20% for commercial print)<br>  <br>  AGENTS<br>  To get an agent, you need to get GREAT headshots, a good resume, and training from the best. These are enough to get you a commercial agent at least. Getting a GOOD theatrical agent (Film/tv) takes longer. Most good theatrical agents won't see you unless you're SAG, have a polished resume, and a demo reel. Commercial agents are more lenient about that. What the best Commercial agents want to see on your resume are good commercial classes, improv, and cold reading.<br>  <br>  You can get an agent multiple ways. Here are a few common ways:<br>  -Mail in an unsealed manilla envelope with a CONCISE coverletter and headshot with the resume stapled on the back. If you have a demoreel include that too.<br>  -Get a referral from a friend who is with the agency that you're interested in<br>  -Attend a showcase and impress them<br>  <br>  DON'T<br>  -Email them unless they tell you to. IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Call unless they tell you to. ALSO UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Walk in and ask for a meeting. UNPROFESSIONAL THREE!<br>  -Sign with them if they ask for upfront money, make you take new photos with THEIR photographer, or take THEIR classes. Agent's ONLY make money when you do. Agents usually make 10% on film/tv and commercials and 20% on commercial print<br>  <br>  There are also FAKE agencies like JRP, John Casablancas, and Barbizon!<br>  <br>  John Robert Powers, John Casablancas, and Barbizon are all SCAMS! They are NOT agencies! They MISLEAD people into thinking that they are, but are NOT. LEGIT Agencies only make money when you do (10% for film/tv and commercials, 20% for commercial print). REAL AGENTS DON'T take $2000 upfront and DON'T make you take their subpar classes.<br>  <br>  A school for modeling is the biggest scam, period! When you get picked up by a LEGIT agency like Ford or Elite, they will teach you or hire coaches. They're not going to reject your resume because "oh, you don't have any modeling classes." <br>  <br>  If you don't think they're scams, then go waste thousands of dollars that could go towards good headshots and training from the BEST schools (JRP, JC, and Barb. are NOT the best!) Also, go to a major market like L.A. or N.Y. with those schools on your resume. You'll get LAUGHED out!<br>  <br>  Schools like Barbizon, JRP, and JC still exist because there are a lot of suckers trying to get into acting and for the money. They think that going to one school will be the answer and it's not. It's these schools that give them and feed off of those false promises. For every 100 people that go through these scammy schools and lose their money, there will always be that naturally talented kid that gets work and that these scammy schools take credit for. <br>  <br>  JRP-Banks on the name of a very famous and DEAD agent. They say that Lucille Ball, John Wayne, Barbara Walters, Heather Locklear, Peter Fonda, Jane Fonda, and many other famous actors went to the school, when NONE of them did! Some of those celebs even threatened legal action for using their names. So you see, they use bait and switch tactics.<br>  <br>  John Casablancas-The franchises have been known for unethical business practices and really have nothing to do with the founder's original intentions.<br>  <br>  Barbizon-It was legit back in the 70s and 80s. Now these franchises have been known for unethical business practices and false promises.<br>  <br>  These schools are OVERPRICED and DON'T provide the caliber training that more affordable and REPUTABLE schools like Howard Fine Studios, Ivanna Chubbuck, TVI Studios, Groundlings, Second City, Beverly Hills Playhouse, Stella Adler, William Esper Studios, Tom Todoroff, Joanne Baron/D.W. Brown, Margie Haber, etc. do.<br>  <br>  Go look those schools up! They are all respected by the industry and LEGIT!|`|S01zIagOaa	First of all you do not pay agents money to be part of an agency. Agents earn commission when an actor works. That is it. Because you are a child, your parents need to take the lead on pushing you into a career as a child actor. There is no other way.

The city sits on Lake Cado witch is a natural lake that had access to the Gulf of Mexico. Much of the supplies for the Confederacy was shipped in and out of there. Food and supply's was grown and made there. Cotton that was traded to France for ships and supply's was grown there. Texas was far from the front lines and so she sent troops al over the south. So as to keep the war from coming to Texas.Texas played a big part in the war of Northern Aggression. It just was not the scene of a lot of battles.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Um - flunked history, did ya?|`|KTNqah9eaa	There weren't enough Texans about to be involved and those that were there decided it was best to keep neutral.|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	Simply because at that time Texas was the back of beyond- sparsely populated and with absolutely no industry.

But the "heart" of the Confederacy was in places like Georgia- which had enough industry to support the CSA army for a considerable time. So instead of attacking a huge but empty state like texas, it was far more worthwhile for Sherman to demolish Georgia (which lay just behind the frontlines of the CSA) and de-facto end the war|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	Actually they did, check out the battle of Glorieta pass.

HlQCmCG0aa	If you mean something like a union scale type pricing, there are no set prices that photographers charge .<br>  For big group happenings, like reunions they can charge according to their market. Different regional areas demand different moneys. A good photog in LA may charge $300-500 as a flat fee and $2-3 for each printable file plus if prints are wanted, a fee on those according to size of print. A photog in say  Bandon, Oregon, may only be able to charge $150-400 flat rate and less per print and/or file.<br>  Check your area. Ask to see a portfolio of the photogs works, try to get a feel for the person, 'invite' him/her to the affair by saying they are welcome to the buffet table and such.<br>  Try to pick a person that is closer to the age group you are wishing to capture. Not that a 22 year old couldn't do nice work but if this is your 60th high school reunion, it may be a little awkward for both parties, but if it's only your 10th, well I hope you see what I mean.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	I have done reunions for years and never charged the committee.

c4r6jwLjaa	If you are talking about a "fish flop," then put your right leg straight in front of you with your left leg bent as you are sitting on the floor. I think what would help is if you went in slow motion until you got the hang of it. Lean forward to get momentum, lean back and lift up your legs...once you get to the point that you have to go on your shoulder, lean a little to the right so you are forced to put weight on your right shoulder. From there, just flip out of it and your right foot should land on the floor first.|`|uYJdvnqxaa	Do you mean you just can't do a fishrole,or you can but not to the right?|`|l0ydHpKqaa	start with ur left foot and front its just like the left roll but reversed! lmao

05e0c89d259c567203ac41de8d961e11aa	It's basically what many teen girls dream about. Not all of course---it excludes me and a few other sane people. Edward Cullen was created to be the paragon of perfection. Since he is *perfect* (supposedly) and unreal, immortal and chivalrous (supposedly), girls squeal over him left and right.<br>  <br>  It's primarily a hormonal rush that they are experiencing. As a book, the writing sucks. It's all abuse of the thesaurus, purple prose, and Mary Sue-ism. Too many plotholes, and if you love reading, it will get boring and annoying, repetitive and overly-cliched. It's a quick read and will disappear in a decade, easily.<br>  <br>  So you aren't missing out in the next great American novel. Don't freak.<br>  <br>  ~Zara Amithra 007, a teen girl who does NOT freak over Twilight or Edward Cullen.<br>  <br>  EDIT: The sparkling thing? Well, the story is a vampire story. But Meyer doesn't stick with the traditional vampire phenotype. Instead of vampires burning in the sun, she has them *sparkle* in the sun (yes, lame, I know). That's all.|`|daza5A4vaa	There isn't one.|`|uhHfm3Azaa	the big deal about twilight?<br>  that's like asking what's the big deal with breathing.<br>  <br>  people need to breathe.<br>  and people need to flip out over twilight.<br>  <br>  it might be edward, or the vampire thing in general...<br>  i don't know...<br>  <br>  it's just amazing.|`|EXQzhRBjaa	I read Twilight and I dont even SEE how anyone could even love the books!

Also, Stephenie Meyer brought something new to the table about vampires. She created her own vampires and they do actually go to school, with humans, so it is a new take on vampires. I personally believe that it is very well written, it is actually one of my favourite books. Why people like Edward? I don't know, maybe it is because he is romantic or cares very much for Bella, that only someone who likes Edward can tell you. People are allowed to like fiction characters, there isn't a rule against it. As I said, I love Twilight very much, I am very glad that I read it!|`|AA11310817	The author makes Edward "a perfect gentleman", very romantic.<br>  To be truthful, I didn't want to read the books till I saw the movie. I'm a sucker for romance! I loved the sweetness, and tender-loving his character displayed towards the damsel in (constant) distress.<br>  Then I read the books, and though they were NOT the best ever written, and have many plot flaws, I just needed to know how it all ended. And so I read all four books within 12 days of watching the movie...<br>  I'd like to see what comes next. <br>  It wasn't "the best ever", but it was interesting enough to me. To each his own, right?<br>  <br>  As for Edward Sparkling... In Stephenie Meyer's books the reason why vampires don't come out in plain sunlight, is because the light gets reflected off their skin in intense sparkles, like on the multiple facets of a diamond... Kind of funny, really... And you've probably heard about him dazzeling people too... It's because everything about a vampire's physical self (eyes, aroma...) is "made" to sort of hypnotise or dazzle their prey for easy capture.... <br>  Hope that answered your questions...|`|1kIP1q71aa	okay, listen up!<br>  <br>   I've read Twilight and believe me, it isn't even that good. I honestly think the movie is so much better. the girls in my school that like twilight are the girls that never read before, thank you very much. they just like it cause it's the first decent book they've ever read that is long, so they seem smart. Like, if they were to actually READ other books, maybe they'd see that twilight isn't so great. Really, dont read it. It's not all good like they claim it to be.|`|PYUVHnfMaa	Well it is very well written.  Stephenie Meyer did a really good job when writing it. The story is unique, and girls can relate to Bella. The reason some of the girls are in love with Edward is because he is sweet, cute, he sparkles, & is cool.|`|yhQ3LT4haa	It's a forbidden love, and Stephenie make it where you feel your in Bella's shoes.

The story-line is interesting, though it is repetitive and drags on a little. The characters, though well-defined, can be annoying. For instance, Bella, who is supposed to be this plain uninteresting girl has the attention of all the male population - they all ADORE her for some reason. I find that annoying. It's just too unbelievable, but then again, it is a fantasy novel.<br>  I know all these girls are going crazy over Edward, and I admit I am fascinated by him, too, because who wouldn't be if there was a supposedly gorgeous vampire? But what some of these girls don't seem to realize - and I'm quite disturbed by it - is that Edward is JUST a fictional character and isn't and never will be real. <br>  Despite all this I would recommend reading it. It is a good book and the series is good. The movie, however, is really bad. I hate it. The special effects are really bad, and applied with some of the casts bad acting make it a real let down, especially to those who have read the books.|`|k277YG8paa	it's an exciting page turner....until you finished the books. It gets boring and more annoying the more you read it, and the 'cullen perfection' get's old|`|ZLCPulYKaa	I don't know, but same here, all the girls at my school are going crazy over it and its killing me. No way a single book can live up to all they say it is.

I usually just work on the middle part of the story first, unless I have a really good idea for the beginning. Try not to go over your beginning too much because you might think that it isn't good and tempted to write it over many times.

How can he MAKE someone rape his wife repeatedly. I personally think he just spent countless hours finding them and then just exploiting their situation. That softened the ending for me. I just kind of twisted what he said. <br>  <br>  But yes I love love loved the books. My favourite was the old lady. She made me so sad :( I also loved the running girl. He wrote her beautifully. Have you read The Book Thief, Zusak's other novel, it's even better (with an amazing ending)|`|iokyiSauaa	i agree with you. to reconcile myself i just said : if i was an author id do what i want with my book and so that's how i figured it. The ending was horrible and heart wrenching. i think the author might have been angry or something. I hate reading horrific endings like that so i wont be reading anymore of those|`|GKJsgVe9aa	i love that book, it is now my favorite. but yea i didnt like the ending, the book was so meaningful, i could talk about how it moved me forever, with milla and sophie and the priest. but the ending didnt fulfill the book, it didnt make sense that some random guy would set up all of that, just because he can. but a least ed and audery got together-- he taught her to love, and marven with his daughter.
ODIuKYdfaa	The easiest way to do this without having to download a program is to go to Picnik.com and upload your pictures. If you want 9 photos like that you have to find a way to get around the 5 limit upload that the website allows. Anyways, then go to the collage feature and drag and drop the selected pictures. Hope that helps.|`|R3UVYaHtaa	use one of these editing programs all are pro<br>  <br>  Corel Paint Shop Pro x2<br>  Adobe Photoshop Cs 2 or 3 or 4<br>  <br>  good luck|`|C77c0OE2aa	Combining two or more photos into a single photo is actually very simple. Imagine having actual prints of your photos and say they are 8 inches width x 10 inches height in size. Then imagine laying out a piece of paper large enough to hold each print. If you wanted to place the photos side by side, you would need a sheet of paper that would be twice as wide as your prints, so you would need a sheet 16 inches wide by 10 inches high. If you wanted to place the photos on top of each other, you would need a sheet of paper twice as high as your photos, so that would be a piece of paper 20 inches high and 8 inches wide.<br>  <br>  You will do the same thing in the computer. In Photoshop or GIMP <a href="http://www.gimp.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.gimp.org</a> you will go to FILE - NEW and enter the dimensions of you new "canvas size". You can either do this in inches or pixels or any other unit of measure. There is a drop down list beside the size boxes where you can select units of measure. Again, you will create a new canvas that is large enough to contain your photos you want to place into it. You will need to know the exact size of your photos. You can go to IMAGE - SIZE and see the dimensions of your photos and then from those numbers you will know how large to make your new canvas.<br>  <br>  Be SURE, however, when you are creating your new canvas, that you set the resolution (DPI) to the same number as your original photos, otherwise there will be a huge size difference between your new canvas and the photos you drop into it.<br>  <br>  You can also make the new canvas larger than your photos if you want to add borders or a different color background or text or design embellishment. Only your skill and imagination are the limiting factors as to what you can do.<br>  <br>  steve|`|645f18865ac05bd21df6fca545da961daa	there are some sites on,line that you can use to upload set, and combine,<br>  <br>  Mosaic Maker:  <br>  <a href="http://www.bighugelabs.com/flickr/mosaic.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.bighugelabs.com/flickr/mosaic...</a><br>  Collagr.com -  <br>  <a href="http://www.collagr.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.collagr.com/</a><br>  <br>  FotoFlexer you can use layers to place beside each other, <br>  <a href="http://fotoflexer.com/" rel="nofollow">http://fotoflexer.com/</a><br>  ________<br>  <br>  in paint , you can make large canvas 3x by 3x, then open new paint for images to copy and paste then place in order, save as new mosaic collage,<br>  <br>  Photoscape :  with combine option<br>  <a href="http://www.photoscape.org/ps/main/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.photoscape.org/ps/main/index....</a><br>   <br>  Picasa Album viewer with collage option.<br>  <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" rel="nofollow">http://picasa.google.com/</a><br>   <br>  Photofiltre , you could use like paint and copy and paste sets<br>  <a href="http://photofiltre.free.fr/frames_en.htm" rel="nofollow">http://photofiltre.free.fr/frames_en.htm</a><br>  ..

He was on the verge of completing/creating nuclear weapons and if he had, we probably would not be here now or if we were, we'd be speaking German.|`|TL1Jkqunaa	Hitler declared war in September 1939.  And no, he never thought to invade the USA.  He did hope to keep the USA neutral, which he really failed to do although he did manage to keep the USA from declaring war openly.   The Lend Lease program and the open recruitment of US citizens into Canadian services (and other empire  services) were obvious violations of the intent of neutrality.  THat he did not respond directly to the violations shows he knew he had some limits.|`|tiABWrkeaa	if I remember correctly, he did plan on it. He hoped to defeat Britain and the Soviet Union, consolidate his territories and resources, and attack by 1947. Hitler would have liked to have obtain the Royal Navy, but that was highly unlikely as it would haved sailed for Canada or India and Australia. Instead, he decided on depend on air power such as the proposed Amerika bomber. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerika_Bomber" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerika_Bom...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  There is a book on this:<br>  TARGET: AMERICA: Hitler's Plan to Attack the United States by James Duffy.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/TARGET-AMERICA-Hitlers-Attack-United/dp/0275966844" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/TARGET-AMERICA-Hit...</a><br>  <br>  Also, the History Channel made a special on it, called "Hitler's Lost Plan"<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hitlers-Lost-Plan-Conor-Timmis/dp/B0019KAQ8Q/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1236471112&sr=8-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Hitlers-Lost-Plan-...</a>|`|94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	No, his main intention was to conquer the USSR; as only the USSR was large enough to provide enough leibensraum (room to live) for the German people.<br>  <br>  But interestingly, almost every country has invasion plans drawn up to invade another, in case of emergency...The US has plans drawn up to invade Iceland, etc.  This is a matter of advance planning; and does not illustrate any actual desire to invade.|`|xfqHi1tRaa	His spies did -- this is an interesting book on it:<br>  Hitler's Undercover War : the Nazi espionage invasion of the U.S.A. by William Breuer<br>  I'm not sure I ever heard much about a massive military landing, but I could be wrong.

I really want to see the movie.|`|oo1bOj9caa	For me it was the change in the way he judged her and equally the way oneself as the reader judged her differently at the end of the book vs the beginning. The question of 'can one love someone who is a cruel person' or 'a person with different morals and or different intellect' is another fascinating aspect of the book.

Adding -ly to something to make it sound "deeper" is a cheap trick and one that lessens the overall writing.  It took me a few years to really understand what they meant by that.<br>  <br>  In a lot of writing tip sites, you will see similar advice about -ly words.  Many of them are overbearing in the context or outright useless to the overall writing (they can be removed from the sentance and never missed).<br>  <br>  For what it's worth, I'd probably write, "she paused, desparate to catch her breath, but the sound ...urged her on." then, "Brushing...brow, she continued on to her destination."|`|Uiew8yuCaa	I think I like involuntarily.|`|bnXhtB5baa	Yee<br>  <br>  <br>  x|`|ZNNot5WGaa	yeperdoodles XDD|`|hl4kkvXhaa	It's a word, but here it kind of breaks the flow of the story.  It's sort of awkward.  Part of the problem is because, in your attempt to make the story deeper, you shift words into what is technically grammatically correct, but at the same time awkward and gives the flow a bit of a lag.  Start with "She" first.  <br>  <br>  Maybe another word, such as "She involuntarily..." or "She stopped to catch her breath even though she didn't want to."  I know you may want to punch it up with as much depth and volume as possible, but remember that you are wanting people to read it and enjoy it rather than stare at it and ask "Who talks like that?!" then put it down unfinished.   Your character "voice" should be a compliment to the story.  If you try to write in a fashion that you think people will find more thrilling or adult, it usually comes off as amateurish.<br>  <br>  No...not calling you or your story amateurish.

1404d9070bb3e8dbdfa989926c402b0eaa	"The Book of Frank" by Simon Black<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Book-Frank-Simon-Black/dp/1880909286" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Book-Frank-Simon-B...</a><br>  "Frank Mann is an embittered, self-loathing civil servant who, as a character, would make Samuel Beckett proud. One day he quits going to work. Penniless, he is soon evicted and thrown out onto the Manhattan streets, where he falls in love with an East Village performance art dilletante. Determined to win her, he smashes a mirror, chants, and sets his head on fire in his debut as a New York performance artist, and, when this tactic fails, decides to have himself crucified on stage as the ultimate sacrifice to art. He dies, is resurrected, and never gets the girl. If the plot sounds absurd and funny, it is. The Book of Frank is comic relief, a much-needed, blistering satire of any "local art" performance scene, not just the Big Apple's. Black hilariously excoriates the piercings, psychic violence, and banal pretensions of local art communities, with their stars, sycophants, and wannabes. Though Black's novel is a welcome deflation of hip aesthetic pretensions and inanities, his satire is not generous enough to portray the "artists" in the book as genuine human beings, treating them instead, for all their superficial posings, as paper targets for rightly-aimed shots."
Nhgkaepkaa	Well he thought that he was the best and once his hand was crippled he was nothing.
xfqHi1tRaa	Yes -- Europeans and the Native Americans.<br>  You are overlooking the fact that MUCH of Africa, especially North Africa, was the home of very ancient civilizations and you are also falling into the trap of stereotyping all African peoples and cultures as the same.|`|AA12095483	Well, Asia and Europe didn't have much in common either. <br>  I don't think racism comes from the cultures being far apart, but rather from slavery. The whites who enslaved the blacks brought them to the US and treated them like sub-humans. Whites were encouraged to feel superior to the blacks - and I beleive THAT is where racism originated.|`|4ilM2hCwaa	Yes, any Asian culture vs any African culture just to start.<br>  <br>  Edit: Nonsense, Old Lady.  Every culture has had slaves throughout history.  Black Africans held each other as slaves North African held each other and sub-Saharan, Romans held Greeks (both Caucasoid), Asians held each other, and so on.  Racism is based upon fear of the unknown and differences from self just like any other hate based fear.  The OP is leaning in the right direction, just over simplifiying.
IvkZNs0caa	Yes, It would solve the problem but it is difficult to get a long duration electronic flash.  In the "old days" we used slow burning flash bulbs that would fire before the shutter opened and burn evenly through the entire time any part of a Focal Plane shutter was open.  Some old cameras and lenses had separate connections or switches to select between "FP" and "X" mode to accommodate these bulbs.<br>  <br>  Some modern cameras are solving this problem with electronic flash by having a rapid series of bursts fired during the exposure.  But this requires the camera and flash to be configured to communicate with one another so that the flash "knows" the shutter speed and can allocate the available power to match the shutter speed.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	How slow is the sync speed?  All modern cameras sync faster than 1/90th second, most 1/125th or faster.<br>  <br>  If you are attempting to shoot using flash in daylight, you use an ND filter and place the flash in the TTL mode.<br>  <br>  The flash is instantaneous, so it is important that the shutter is fully open when it goes off.<br>  <br>  You may have to be a little more specific in describing your problem.  Focal plane shutters with vertical curtains can sync up to 1/200th of a second and those with electronic shutters up to 1/500th like the original Canon 1D and Nikon D70s.<br>  <br>  Leaf shutters like those found on medium format and view cameras can sync at the fastest shutter speed on the lens, usually 1/500th second, however, most leaf shutters are not that accurate at those speeds.
KHSOVxViaa	The superpowers sometimes tried to gain allies in Africa by supplying money and arms.  These usually went to military strongmen, and the people saw no benefit.  Aspiring strongmen could gain more power by siding with a superpower and offering to fight their opponents, in return for money and arms of course!<br>  <br>  These strongmen became the typical leaders of Africa in the 1970/80s, and are still fairly common today.  Powerful and unscrupulous local, often tribal leaders could play on their tribe's mistrust of other tribes and succeed in overthrowing democratic governments, aided by arms from elsewhere.<br>  <br>  There was nobody to stop this - the superpowers and others were usually prepared to deal with the new leadership, and neighbouring countries were often suffering their own similar internal problems.  Democratic presidents decided to abolish democratic process and become lifelong leaders; they could get away with this through being bolstered with arms from a superpower or an unregulated international arms trade.<br>  <br>  However, by far the most devastating effect were the proxy wars.  This is where the two superpowers backed sides in a civil war, or sometimes a cross-border war.<br>  <br>  Examples include Angola, where Cuba and the USSR supported one faction (MPLA) after independence, so the USA (and South Africa) supported their opponents FNLA and UNITA.  While the MPLA quickly beat the FNLA and took power in the capital, the war with UNITA continued for decades, devastating and impoverishing much of the country.  Even after the cold war when the outsiders lost interest, this war continued as a personal struggle between strongmen until the UNITA leader, Jonas Savimbi, was killed in a gunfight.  This finally brought the war to an end and reconstruction could begin.<br>  <br>  There have been other examples of harrowing civil wars where the superpowers played a part - Mozambique, Rhodesia/Zimbabwe, Ethiopia & Eritrea and Somalia.  Morocco got support despite its invasion and occupation of Western Sahara.  The more recent civil wars in Zaire/Congo(DRC) and the lakes region come from a time when the arch-kleptocrat, Mobutu, was paid off by certain backers to keep the other side at bay.  They didn't care that he ran his country like a shell-state, selling off everything that moved and putting it all in Swiss banks.<br>  <br>  The Cold War meant that bad guys could get away with bad things in Africa, commerce, trade and economies suffered greatly as a result.  The end of the Cold War has allowed big improvements to happen.  The proxy wars have gone, though there are still some very damaging conflicts.  There are still many dictators and autocrats, but there are also outbreaks of democracy.  Bad leaders are often tolerated by their neighbours, but some peer-pressure criticism has started to appear.<br>  <br>  The situation is far from perfect, but things are considerably better than the 70s and 80s.
TL1Jkqunaa	The word history means written history.  Egypt was one of the earliest areas to have developed and preserved their writing.  (through luck and the desert dryness)<br>  Most of the rest of Africa did not have writing until much later.  And most of  the rest of Africa is wet.  SO very little is preserved.  SO there just is not too much material to work with, it is almost all lost.  Even a lot of modern history and its artefact's are lost.  Since the 1500's Europeans have described many amazing civilizations and usually the battles they had with large African groups and cities (a lot of this is related to the slave trade.)  But the physical evidence of most of these cities are gone- almost completely in just 500 hundred years.  Even many of the so called modern buildings of the Europeans, built in the 1800's are gone with almost no trace. <br>  The only sources go back to about the early 1400s in most of Africa and usually by the Portuguese and the Arabs.  As both mostly were in Africa for slavery the records are not all that good,  they made almost no effort to learn the conditions of the moment, let alone the Africans earlier history.|`|94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	Egypt is the only one that connected directly to European civilization; as it had great influence on Greece or Rome.  That's why we study it.<br>  <br>  The others are interesting but OFTEN had little connection to Western civilization - or unfortunately, as in the case of Zimbabwe which was 'discovered' by archaeologists - really left no lasting legacy.  The main reason to study them is to create pride and include those of non-European ancestry, and for this reason their acheivements should be studied, but not more than this is necessary.|`|nQVM3ry4aa	I can only second what dougger said. But to make it more clearly : civilizations which did not leave any written sources simply do not exist for historians. That is because historians work with very little else but written sources (historians are not archaeologists). This not only applies to the civilizations you mentioned but to others as well, for example lots of germanic and celtic tribes.<br>  And btw., no history scholar would miss the once-in-a-lifetime-chance to write about a civilization no other scholar has ever written about just because they were black.|`|xfqHi1tRaa	Yes we KNOW that Egypt is in Africa. And no it's NOT the only African civilization to be studied -- those in Ethiopia and other places are also extensively studied -- however their current governments do not lead to a welcoming academic atmosphere. Also, a great many civilizations in Africa were nomadic -- not leaving behind much TO study.<br>  <br>  Quit trying to cause trouble.|`|MllOMmnUaa	Are you implying that people who read this section of Answers won't know that Egypt is in Africa???<br>  <br>  Other civilizations in Africa are studied and explored (explored as much as possible). When I taught ancient cultures, I taught not only Egypt but Kush, Zimbabwe, the Kingdoms of Gold, etc. as well as the ancient civilizations of Europe, Asia, and the Americas.|`|eY0MhGfmaa	Unlike Egypt, which has a rich and fascinating history, most of Africa was still living in the stone age until the Europeans showed up.<br>  <br>  And stop trying to make it a racial issue, people are tired of that lame old tune.

5Ho518J9aa	I think it's safe to say that if we hadn't SUPPORTED foreign made products, the Globalists would've failed fairly quickly when they sent their products off to be manufactured overseas, and for years that was the case. In the late 80's, this began to change, largely because during the recession of 1987, these companies ditched their home country like a hot potato, and most Americans never noticed the Taiwanese or Japanese tags, trusting their good American name brands to not sell out their own people. We were wrong. Not only were they more than willing to sell out their own Nation when the chips were down, they saw their profits rise. Enter Bill Clinton, and the NWO decision to give China "Most Favored Nation" trade status. This decision was made years before by Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller, back when Kissinger was hailing China's eugenics program as "The model of the world in population control". When we stop listening to the proponents of mass murder, we will all be better off. These "people" are NOT concerned about the men and women who work for them, or the excellent jobs they do. When the CEOs of all of the world's Globalist Corporations met in Davos, Switzerland in February, they partied it up in posh luxury, and schemed on how to salvage their precious profits while dining on 5-star meals. Don't get me wrong, I am all for being profitable, so long as you don't lead your own nation into a Great Depression, and leave millions of breadwinners unemployed, and without health insurance in the process. If anyone thinks GM was making crappy cars, I highly recommend you go check out the new Cadillac lineup. The Ford trucks they just came out with last year are once AGAIN the best full-size trucks in the world, and if you have some work to do, they WILL get it done. Over at Chrysler, the 300, the Charger, and the all-new Challenger are mind blowing. If you talk down the American car makers, you haven't seen one lately.|`|GGGpVvjBaa	No.<br>  It is our choice.|`|rxItXYk8aa	it's our duty as an American.<br>  it's our duty as humans, however, to find what's best for us.

A classic coming-of-age story in the tradition of THE CATCHER IN THE RYE and A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN, Kincaid's novel focuses on a universal, tragic, and often comic theme: the loss of childhood. Annie's voice --- urgent, demanding to be heard --- is one that will not soon be forgotten.<br>  <br>  THE BEAN TREES Looking to escape an oppressive upbringing in rural Kentucky, Marietta Greer heads west in a beat-up Volkswagen. By the time her car breaks down in Tucson, she has with her a stunned, silent three-year-old Cherokee girl who was, literally, dropped into her arms one night and who Marietta names Turtle. Here in Tucson, among a group of fellow travelers, Marietta and Turtle create new lives and redefine the meanings of home and family.<br>  <br>  BELOVED At the center of Toni Morrison's Pulitzer Prize-winning fifth novel is an almost unspeakable act of horror and heroism: a woman brutally kills her infant daughter rather than allow her to be enslaved.

Caroline is beautiful. Caroline is talented. Caroline is better. Growing up on the small island of Rass in Chesapeake Bay, Caroline seems to do nothing but take from Louise: their parents' love, Louise's chances for an education, her dreams for the future. They have spent their lives entwined --- sleeping in the same room, eating at the same table, learning in the same classroom --- and yet somehow nothing can bring them together. Louise's only hope lies in seeking a place for herself beyond the stretch of Rass's shores and her sister's shadow. What will it take for her to break free?|`|WTXvmcxcaa	I agree.

Have you ever heard of Jane Austen? She was a regency period author and her books are romantic, satire, and and have very good story lines. Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensiblilty are my favorites. They both have good movies: Pride and Prejudice has Keira Knightly in it and for Sense and Sensibilty try the BBC one. <br>  <br>  There is also a really good book by Charlotte Bronte who wrote in the same period as Jane Austen. My favorite by her is called Jane Eyre. That is dark romantic kind of book and very good. The Masterpeice Theater movie is best for that one.<br>  <br>  Ok well that's my suggestions for you. They are 19th century romance's and I'm not sure if thats what your into. But try these ones out! I really liked them and I'm 14 too!|`|FeQpvEp6aa	Read "To Kill a Mockingbird," it's a great book and an amazing movie.

One of my favourites has been 'nineteen eighty-four' by George Orwell; very interesting when looking at politics or history. I also enjoyed Fight Club (yes, the book of the film); it explores the darker impulses in the human condition and highlights the 'crisis of manhood' in modern society. It retains the shock value of the film (if you haven't seen the film) while, in my opinion, adding to the nature of the story's probe into the human condition. It isn't an uplifting read though!<br>  Also, one of my all-time favourites is the classic of classics; the Iliad by Homer. You may well class this as being in the genre of fantasy, so it might be of interest to you. It is the original adventure story and, while some translations retain more of the poetic nature of the original verses (it is a poem by nature, after all), but some translations do away with much of the poetry and have it written more like a novel, albeit an archaic one. The Odyssey is also a good read, although I have not yet finished it, but I would say that the Iliad is more epic, more a story of big battles, great duels and legendary deeds, while the Odyssey is more of a simple swashbuckling tale of the protagonist's journey home after the events of the Iliad. <br>  Hope that helps!|`|93b9efecd6ca82bff2f4e552457b1bd7aa	You might try a series by Raymond Feist  It is the Riftwar saga and the books are Magician: Apprentice, Magician: Master, Silverthorn and A Darkenss at Sethanon. Mr. Feist has a LOT more books set in the world of these four books so, if you like them you can go on for several more series.<br>  <br>  The Wheel of Time Series by Robert Jordan first book is called Eye of the World. There are about 12 books in the series and the last book is being written by author Brandon Sanderson as Mr Jordan has passed on.<br>  <br>  Elantris and Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson. Mistborn is a series so there are two more books after that one.<br>  <br>  Assassins Apprentice by Robin Hobb this series is written from the perspective of someone who is not the hero of the book. It is for someone who wants something darker. <br>  <br>  Terry Pratchett writes some good books however the first book in the series called The Color of Magic is more of a collection of stories and is possibly his weakest book set in the discworld.<br>  <br>  There are the Dresden Files which are kind of darker fantasy by Jim Butcher and the first one is Storm Front<br>  <br>  Moving into simply literature there is The Road by Cormac McCarthy. You need to be careful with this one, it is really dark there is not a whole lot of action and there are some scenes that are disturbing. Oh, and the author doesn't believe in punctuation so, if you have a problem with that...<br>  <br>  Time Travelers Wife is also a good book it is by Audrey Niffenegger|`|URjirGu7aa	Well, I read these books and loved them:<br>  Valiant.

The tapes contain the 13 reasons why she did it and are sent to the 13 people on the tapes.<br>  <br>  Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold: Story about a girl who was raped and murdered and how she looks down on her family after her death. It's very good and the author puts an interesting view on life and relationships with other people.<br>  <br>  Marked by P.C. & Kristin Cast: This book was pretty good, but it was girly and kind of cheesy. It is a vampire book sort of Twilight-esq, but it's different.<br>  <br>  So B.

tAv7ciloaa	I'd say this is excellent writing for someone your age. I'll admit I only read the first chapter but that isn't because your writing is poor. You have a lot of style and each of your characters have their own voice. Your dialogue is believable and flows really well.<br>  <br>  You probably won't be too broken up if I pointed out that you make some mistakes with spelling and grammar, but at the moment that's really nothing to worry about. That can all be taught. What can't be taught are the things you do well and that's to have a sense of your characters and a sense of style.

The ones I have are the three above, The Vampire Armand, Pandora, Vittorio & Blood and Gold.<br>  <br>  Terry Pratchett has a couple about vampires. Maskerade and  Carpe Jugulum. I'm not sure if there are any more.|`|9YUmSw62aa	I saw an add for this new book called<br>  "Marked"<br>  its written by P.C and Kristen Cast.<br>  They have other books out soon called<br>  "Betrayed"<br>  and<br>  "Chosen"<br>  <br>  And Anne Rice has a v nice selection.<br>  <br>  xox|`|hPt0hLyXaa	<a href="http://www.monsterlibrarian.com/vampiresya.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.monsterlibrarian.com/vampires...</a><br>  There is a big list of them here.|`|e3bbea72940dc8ddb89cf1c33bdc265aaa	How about the original Dracula...?<br>  Or as others have stated Anne Rice|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Try anything by Anne Rice.|`|05e0c89d259c567203ac41de8d961e11aa	Vampire Chronicles (a series) by Anne Rice.<br>  <br>  The first book, Interview with a Vampire, is very, very good.

daza5A4vaa	I really don't feel like it's put together very well, and it didn't catch my interest.<br>  But I think with some editing it could be really good.<br>  So..<br>  Edit, edit, edit, and come back (:|`|GNf3tmguaa	thats super awesome fantasticly good. lol keep writing|`|5p4TKogxaa	Well it does seem interesting, but there is just a few things you might want to improve.<br>  1- How does she back flip when he grabs her hair? Maybe she would just fall back?<br>  <br>  2-You should include more adjectives to describe what's going on.<br>  <br>  3-If Ronald didn't know who Jane was, how could he have told her no to see or speak to this other person? It's a bit confusing so you should edit that some more. Make sure everything makes sense.|`|rKwLUahTaa	I really do like idea<br>  <br>  1.

UrgUnBqOaa	Fifteen-year-old Callie is confined to a mental hospital (Sea Pines, also nicknamed "Sick Minds") after the nurse at her school sees her scars in an attempt to take her pulse. Although Callie refuses to speak due to trauma, she does make several friends among her fellow patients: Sydney and Tiffany, who are recovering drug addicts; Becca, Tara, and Debbie, who suffer from weight issues, and Amanda, who also cuts herself. Over the course of the story, the reasons for Callie's self-harm and subsequent incarceration are slowly revealed through therapy sessions.|`|EXQzhRBjaa	Cut by Patricia Mccormick <br>  <br>  Cut is a book about a girl named Callie. She is a 15 year old girl who lives in a residential treatment facility and doesn?t speak to anybody. Her parents and doctor sent her to Sea Pines after finding out that she cuts herself, but she doesn't know why she does it. As she recovers her voice, she confronts the family with her destructive behavior. She also starts to understand all the other issues that the other young women?s are confronting with. I would rate this book as a 10 because this could really happen and it put you in the shoes as one of the characters and that makes you understand what Callie is going through. I enjoyed this book because I like to see the main character in different point of views.|`|hPt0hLyXaa	I believe that the book is about a girl who cuts herself, to relieve her herself or to make her feel better. I haven't read it before, but I want to!

They are each dealing with different problems. The main character cuts herself, and the other girls have eating disorders and drug problems.<br>  <br>  It's by Patricia McCormick.
jqyTUuPHaa	Well first off, I just want to say your NOT copying Twilight.  Just because you have an idea including LOVE or VAMPIRES, or FORBIDDEN LOVE, or CREATURES, does not make it like Twilight.  That is so absurd and annoying when people are harsh on other people's works.  Twilight had some help.  They're are other love/vampire stories out there.  I think it sounds cool.<br>  I don't think you should name it straightaway.  Get into the book, and possibly finish it first.  That's what I did.  That way you can get a general gist of how you really want the book to turn out, and an appropriate title.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  WIll you PLEASE answer my question?? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnwHAqCIxdliF2MDMZ3O1efsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304150715AAc7Dwh">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|b5B53eTPaa	The title should be called this: Accident<br>  <br>  I mean the guy bit her by accident.<br>  <br>  Anyway isn't this basically the book Twilight, just some things are mixed up?|`|jhJ6AGkVaa	You are almost copying Twilight.

PWPLrUFZaa	The double framed narrative is one technique, but within that is also a biased narrator.<br>  <br>  Also the story is told "in media res" which means to enter in the middle. Although when we enter Frankenstein's tale it could be more properly said that we enter at the end, much like in Bronte's Wuthering Heights.<br>  <br>  The "in media res" technique allows the author to have their characters recount their stories in flashback as it were. Meaning that we are already aware of certain events and the narrator (Frankenstein in this instance) can drop several ominous hints about what has happened before we reach these points in his story, thus increasing the dramatic tension within the novel.<br>  <br>  I loved this book, it truly becomes a work of art when read with a feminist perspective.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|KlSjISoQaa	the whole point of education is to get educated isn't it?

Keep it up. <br>  <br>  The bit where you talk about the boy stuttering etc use your words like a camera show the reader the boys body language that gives away he's mood. Plus the bit on slamming the door and the house shaking isn't believable I know what your trying to say, explain how the window shuddered as he slammed the door or something like that.<br>  Ps.

There are persons who have committed  more horrible acts -- bullying, cheating, stealing, unnatural sexual acts -- than you. <br>  <br>  >>The most important thing in Life, is to learn from your errors, and avoid repeating them. Get one or two soul-mates for support. Do some kind and positive things, like volunteering -- such deeds will erase some negative orguilty feelings you may be harbouring.<br>  <br>  >>Surround yourself with a couple of really positive, mature and trusty friends who are capable of motivating you. Speak and get more advice from your parents, grand-parents and favorite uncles or aunties -- they have tons of precious experience and wisdom, i believe. Grab the chance to learn from them, before they are gone.<br>  <br>  >>Organize your life and if you are still studying, follow a rough routine that you can adhere to, at least 75% of the time. One way for your exam scores to advance 15 - 25% each time. And you shall get a lot of confidence and self-esteem.

To do that, use the LDK.<br>  Life Decryption Key-Shortest<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first decision is; do we want to control our lives, or rely on outside forces. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  This document is intended for those who want to control their lives and accept that causes produce effects. The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be based on what is pragmatically verifiable, yet universally true. <br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed as well in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life. <br>  <br>  This formulation serves as a life decryption key.<br>  Add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This, spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together, focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy. It works best when conducted together with other people, who are also trying to have great lives by training their mind-heart-bodies by using the LDK. <br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

NjqxS9WAaa	Are you serious?  Read it out loud to yourself or get someone to read it to you and you will soon discover there's a lot wrong with it.<br>  <br>  For example, the first sentence:<br>  "We lived in at countryside, in a village which was very fine by its old age and green surrounding, with full of trees and flowers."   Can you hear how it doesn't make sense?<br>  <br>  It may be that English is not your first language. That would explain everything.<br>  <br>  Keep to one tense - past or present, not both. Trying to keep to your description as much as possible, I've written this suggestion in the present tense.:<br>  <br>  We live in the countryside in a fine old village surrounded by trees and green fields, rich with meadow flowers. It's early morning and snow covers the landscape. Everywhere is dazzling white and my eyes quiver and wobble as I blink at the glittering brightness. I still have to attend school ... and so on<br>  <br>  You have a good imagination though, which is an excellent start for future creative writing. Master the english language and I think you could do well.|`|JPYFTgrEaa	It has a nice start and all, but I personally find it a tad confusing in the first two sentences. You describe 'green surroundings' 'full of trees and flowers', but then you skip all of the sudden over to 'snow covers everywhere' 'white and it's dazzling and glittering whiteness'. I think that you'd do alright if you fixed this up a little bit, and instead of saying 'snows covers everywehre in white and it's dazzling and glittering whiteness' you might try something like 'a blanket of glittering whiteness covered the usually green flowery landscape in the early winter season.' Y'know? Just might wanna try it out, something like that. Hope this helped!|`|QezKyRJqaa	Its not bad, the order of words needs changing a bit, it sounds better like this!<br>  <br>  We lived in the countryside, in a village which was very grand by its old age, surrounded by trees and flowers.

In every book, a new problem faces Sookie, usually involving Supernatural beings, and she is forced to take action to solve the mystery/crime/issue.  Sookie is always tough, takes a stand for what she believes in and has right on her side.<br>  <br>  Lots of times she gets hurt.  She usually has tons of men/vamps/creatures falling in love with her and she solves the crime/mystery/issue in plenty of time.
Pt7UlHzEaa	Are you kidding me.<br>  <br>  Death<br>  <br>  Who wants to live here forever.|`|mMnRmYvNaa	Cake.<br>  <br>  Good things are to be preferred over bad things.<br>  <br>  On average "cake" is good, death not so good.<br>  <br>  Even bad cake is to be preferred over even a good death, most of the time. It really depends on the alternatives. If the alternative to bad cake is good cake, then either one is generally preferable to death.<br>  <br>  The exception would be if the alternative to good death is a bad death. In that case, a good death might be preferred, even over a piece of cake -- whether good or bad cake.<br>  <br>  Basically, these are quibbles though. I'm with you -- in general, I'll take cake over death (but not over liberty).|`|GGGpVvjBaa	Always cake!|`|jvPToF4Laa	Or better yet, read "The Deathday Cake".|`|m6ZFQV1qaa	Sure, you can have your cake but you can't eat it too.

myq34zlHaa	I don't know about putting polarizing material *under* the subject being photographed, but besides for a polarizing filter on your lens, you can also get polarizing gels to put in front of your lights.  I believe with some, extremely reflective objects, or some particular lighting set-ups, just the lens filter isn't enough.  The polarizing gels are fairly expensive, and can be bought either at a pro photo store, or probably online at calumet or b+h photo.<br>  <br>  From the description, it sounds like you are supposed to use the polarizing gel, which comes in sheets usually from 8" square to 16" square or so.|`|R4WX5twzaa	"I read in one of my photography books that you can find polarizing material (not polarizing material)"<br>  <br>  That doesn't make sense.<br>  <br>  Why don't you just go to a photo place and buy a polarizing filter? I think it'd be a lot easier than trying to figure out how to get "polarizing material not polarizing material" to stay on your lens.<br>  <br>  *EDIT* If you put two polarizing filters on top of each other, all you will get is black.

However it had been mooted before that. How was it isolated? By observation. Before Freud and Co. it was assumed that behaviour, motivation and emotions were driven by spirits or god or demons. They liberated us from this. The answer was the subconscious. <br>  <br>  This knowledge brings liberation because we now know, not only how to repair problems but also to (by the use of NLP and other tools) use the area of the brain which is the seat of the subconscious.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subconscious" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subconsciou...</a>|`|Om7OhWRUaa	Well, I wouldn't be too sure of myself in stating that it *does* exist in the way we conceive of it.

Where there any characters you identified with?  If so talk about them.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with not liking a book.  As a writer, I  do often share my writings.  The other day, I had an acquaintance returning one of my books same day after I had given it to her.  I was surprised, I couldn't understand why.  The woman was kind enough to tell me she read the first two chapters.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, Sandra and I have been published in Sexuality of Latinas, edited by Norma Alarcon.  I have also done readings with her at UC Berkeley.  However, I am not as well know as she is.

r9s0VyJgaa	1.  When your playing gets good enough that you start becoming dissatisfied with your present guitar's sound.  Maybe you start noticing that your current guitar doesn't have the warmth or richness of sound that you want, or that its too tinny or trebly sounding for what you want.  Maybe you start noticing that your present guitar is too bottom-heavy and muddy sounding for the kind of music you want to play and that you would prefer a brighter, clearer tone.  Then its time to start thinking about what you want and start doing some comparison shopping to find your next new guitar. <br>  <br>  2.  When you walk into a music store, see a guitar hanging on the rack, pick it up and try it out, and are totally BLOWN AWAY by the sound, feel and playability. That's it, you're in love, and you have to have THIS guitar. It just speaks to you, somehow.  No other guitar will do, and you know that if you leave the store without buying it, you'll regret it for years afterwards. <br>  <br>  FWIW, every instrument I've ever bought and continue to play -- guitars, mandolins, banjos, fiddles -- was bought as a result of reason #2 :-)|`|KBBonf97aa	Unless your guitar is falling apart and can't be repaired, the decision to buy a new one is purely emotional.  The beauty of being a guitarist is you can always justify the purchase of a new guitar.  I've added guitars to my collection for many reasons, none of which would hold up under oath.  I started with a Fender Bullet that was my primary guitar for more than a decade.  But two years after buying it, I felt compelled to buy a Stratocaster -- because it had a tremolo (I never use tremolo, but desperately needed an excuse to buy the Strat).  Then I convinced myself I needed a 12-string Rickenbacker copy so I'd be able to explore my inner Byrd (though I'm clearly in the Chrissie Hynde vein).  A Les Paul followed (I needed crunch and suddenly found my distortion pedals unsatisfying), as did an Ibanez jass box, a Telecaster Thinline, etc.  Every time I bought one, I'd think, "This will be the last guitar I'll ever need!"  Happy at last?  Hardly!  You can never be too thin, too rich, or have too many guitars.  Life is short, so trust your instincts.  Think of your next guitar as Ms. Right Now, rather than Ms. Right.  That way, you'll still have a clean conscience when you sleep in a bed completely surrounded by guitars whose individual traits make each one a necessity, rather than a member of a collection.|`|tTaDBaM4aa	If you are a guitar junkie anytime is a good time to buy a new guitar! I hope you get what you want.  Just pay cash for it and make sure you can afford it.  They always play and sound better under those circumstances.

QMYNDtHgaa	Harry Potter is all ready remembered, what's it been over 10 years since the first book was published?  When the film Twilight Came out, hundreds of thousands of peoples said...whats Twilight?  If it was as popular as its desperate fan base wanted it to be, everyone would all ready know.  The producers of the films themselves no its all just a Fad, that's why they are rushing filming and production with 2 separate directors and cheap location and SFX.  <br>  <br>  It also doesn't help that every single author with credibility masters of literature have called it garbage.  <br>  <br>  Because Edward is Hot is not a good enough reason to place something as a master piece of Literature.  Sorry Tween Girls. I'm gonna say Harry Potter.|`|w3yrnDEiaa	Neither will be remembered 100 years from now. This question also compares two series which should never be compared. Harry Potter was well written with round dynamic characters and Twilight was poorly written (and edited) and had cardboard cutouts and Mary Sues. <br>  Both are just widely popular although Harry Potter is much more popular and has sold many more books worldwide. Popularity now doesn't mean that they will be epic masterpieces. I don't think either series is an epic masterpiece. <br>  <br>  TL;DR Neither series is an epic masterpiece and neither will be remembered 100 years from now.|`|b6cd9d6fe5a0ec1d495444c45c2b75f2aa	I wish I had a dollar for every time this question was asked.

I'm personally not an HP fan, but it has a much larger target audience (for exaple, my 40 year old aunt loves it, while so do several friends of mine, guy and girl) and there are more of the books. Also, I think the HP movies are much nicer/better than the Twilight was. After a while of reading the Twilight series, it got a little cheesy. I still do like Twilight though, I just think Harry Potter has more depth.|`|ot6OJ7JWaa	HARRY POTTER. <br>  I believe that Stephen King said something alone the lines of: J.K.

It's... well... more intelligent. <br>  I agree with you; Twilight was created for females to read their dream romantic lives out on paper. They want mindless pages of hormones and romance.|`|UcZO5MGpaa	ahhhh!! i LOVE both.. but i'd have to say Twilight series!! The characters are just more realistic or something! Both series are alike in loads of ways like the trying to fit 'a whole different world into the world we live in without us even realising it'!!

Harry Potter symbolizes love and a lot of other motifs too<br>  <br>  twilight appeals to more females than it does to males. harry potter appeals to BOTH males and females and even a music craze, a theme park and merchandise has been set up<br>  Twilight has several million plot holes. the book itself is a huge hole<br>  <br>  Edward Cullen has no protein, because his body doesn’t need it. Protein is a component of DNA, which is also found in sperm. Edward has no sperm, so how the **** did he conceive Renessme? Sperm are living cells that need to be reproduced, and if you’ve been dead for a hundred years, I do believe that your sperm would be long dead. It is also physically impossible for a baby to be produced in a few short months. Bella’s body should have rejected the fetus.<br>  <br>  Imprinting is when you find your best genetic match, right? So Jacob’s best genetic match is a mortal-vampire hybrid. Now that is droll. Oh and 23 chromosomes and 24 chromosomes does not produce a viable kid. Nessie should have down syndrome or should be dead. GAH!!<br>  <br>  Another fault – Alice saw the Volturi invasion right, even though werewolves were involved? What happened to her not being able to see things when wolves were there?<br>  <br>  Oh and why the **** does Jasper go to school when he can’t be around people? I mean, they could have hid him well enough. They don’t even have to go to school!!!<br>  <br>  Also, Edward’s really scared about getting venom in Bella’s mouth when he kisses her. And if she didn’t get preggers off his sperm, she got pregnant off his venom??? WHAT? I think her moot would have been deformed, if getting venom in her mouth would have transformed her into a<br>  vampire.<br>  <br>  And my favourite one - Carlisle was hiding in the London sewers in the 1700’s … London didn’t have sewers in the 1700’s lol.<br>  <br>  Apart from the ridiculous amount of plot holes, Twilight has a poor structure and a storyline with no trail. The novel is basically made up of – “I love you Edward”<br>  “I love you, but I’m dangerous”<br>  “I still love you”<br>  “I’m still dangerous”<br>  The most amusing thing I found about Twilight however is that Edward sparkles… HAHAHAHA<br>  I’ve never heard anything more illogical and uninspiring in my entire life … And how Bella finds it “mesmerizing?” Hahahaha<br>  <br>  The novel consists of Edward and Bella propagating their love for each other for 2000 pages and 4 books and that’s it. Oh and throw in a potential war, a baseball game and him leaving her for a few months. He should have just left forever – dumb *****.<br>  <br>  I also find it really entertaining that people describe Edward Cullen as “the epitome of perfection,” when he is anything but. Edward Cullen is depicted as impossibly beautiful and can somewhat be compared to the god Adonis. His skin is "like marble"—very pale, ice cold, and sparkles in the sunlight. He has perfect facial features and impossibly captivating eyes. I can pretty much hear the words “***, ***, ***, Gary-Stu”, being screamed at me as I write those words.<br>  <br>  But Edward Cullen is a stalking, pedophiliac, abusive son-of-a-*****. What kind of boyfriend disables his girlfriend’s car so she can’t visit her best friend, who’s having a hard time? What kind of boyfriend beats up his girlfriend while they have sex? What kind of boyfriend blames himself when his girlfriend falls over? WHAT KIND OF BOYFRIEND WATCHES HIS GIRLFRIEND SLEEP? AND HE WASN’T EVEN HER BOYFRIEND WHEN HE DID IT!!!<br>  <br>  Also, what kind of sick **** gives his wife a cesarean with his teeth? The answer is apparently a guy who fills the hormonal fantasies of millions of preteen/teenage girls and possibly gender confused boys.<br>  <br>  The one thing that really shits me about Twilight though, is the fan base. Harry Potter's fan base is just a normal bunch of kids and adults, not hormonal teenage fangirls If you saw a kid with down syndrome and saw a Twitard, you’d think the Twitard was more retarded. Unless you ARE a Twitard. Then I hope you take offense.<br>  <br>  Here are some typical examples of Twitards:<br>  <br>  *<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  *<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  *<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  *<a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus..." rel="nofollow">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus...</a><br>  <br>  ^^ HAHAHAHA<br>  <br>  <br>  twilight has scarce details. harry potter has seven books. twilight only has four. a lot more details can be interpreted through seven books than four.<br>  Harry Potter has better characters...

Dance next to another couple who look like they know what they are doing and then try to copy their every move.  Thank them for it.   If no one is dancing then just go out there by yourselves and be prepared to make fools of yourselves and notice how it loosens others to join you out on the dance floor.  Dance the night away.  It would suck to not dance.  You get better every time you do it.  It is only the slow dances that feel awkward.  When slow dancing talk in her ear about how you wish you had things to talk about in her ear - that would have to be the only subject is how you like to talk in her ear.  Everyone will notice how you talk to each other when you slow dance and it will look like romance and then everyone else will feel awkward by comparison.  Be sure to wear dancing shoes, smooth on the bottom, tell her to kick off her heels if her feet are uncomfortable.  Tell her to wear a red dress, you wear black.  Mix it up a little, tell her there are a couple other girls you want to dance with, tell your friends they can dance with her.  Always save the last dance for her.  Applaud after each song.  Get down and roll on the floor once.  Own it.|`|cyt7oh97aa	I don't know if you've watched Hitch, but basically keep your elbows to your side and dance behind your girlfriend and move around to the music.

AA12343309	There is no such thing as a family crest. A crest is part of a coat of arms. Coats of arms do not belong to surnames. They were granted to or assumed by an individual man.  Each country has its own laws about them.  In the U.K. a man has to have one granted to him by the College of Arms.<br>  <br>  See the link below:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/Faq.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/Faq.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Also in Scotland they have to be granted by the Lord Lyon. The link below regarding Bothwell coats of arms gives you details<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bothwell.cx/arms.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bothwell.cx/arms.shtml</a><br>  <br>  Now in some countries they were/are assumed by an individual man.<br>  <br>  The only way you can know if your father or your husband is entitled to a coat of arms is to trace your ancestry back to the individual that was granted one and then check with the heraldry authority in that country to see if you are entitled to display it.<br>  <br>  People who buy coats of arms from peddlers (they are usually called bucket shops) on the internet, at shopping malls, in airports, in magazines buy valid coats of arms.  What isn't valid is that they are sold like they belongs to everyone with the same surname and they do not.  If a person displays one of their walnut plaques, key chains, tshirts, coffee mugs or whatever like the coat of arms on it belong to them, they are guilty of usurping another person's identity.  You can understand that if you have pride in yourself and your family, you certainly don't want to take on another's identity.<br>  <br>  Now if you see a little kiosk at a mall selling them, don't accuse them of dishonesty, even though they are in a dishonest business. Some people buy a franchise and they really don't understand the rules of heraldry.<br>  <br>  What is so bad about these businesses is that a family history comes with the coats of arms they sell.  That family history will not be the family history of everyone with the same surname.  There have been people misled when starting their genealogy because of that.  <br>  <br>  Here are some other links to various countries.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.heraldry.ws/info/article10.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.heraldry.ws/info/article10.ht...</a><br>  regarding Irish herldry<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.regalis.com/onom.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.regalis.com/onom.htm</a><br>  regarding Italian heraldry<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.szlachta.org/heraldry.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.szlachta.org/heraldry.htm</a><br>  Polish heraldry<br>  <br>  Now you might have more than one in your family tree. That doesn't mean you are entitled to any one of them.  It just means that after doing research you find more than one ancestor that were granted a coat of arms and if you have a book printed or even published on your family history, it is quite valid for you to put pictures of your ancestors' coats of arms in your book.  It would not be valid, however, for you to put in your book, pictures of ones that happened to be granted to persons with the same surname as your ancestors.<br>  <br>  If you have any English lines that goes back to early colonial days in the American South even if you are of humble means, you have an excellent opportunity of finding several.<br>  Some in the South have the one their ancestor brought over from England 300-400 years ago.<br>  As a rule, they don't display them. Now, since the colonies rebelled against King George, I don't know if they have continued to apply to the College of Arms to use them down through the generations..  Each descendant that inherits one has to do that. They aren't any good for buying groceries or gasoline. Nor do they help their 401K.|`|lmVDvmMCaa	What makes a coat of arms REAL?  I am assuming that you mean you want to find a coat of arms that is REAL heraldry and is REALLY yours.    <br>  <br>  REAL HERALDRY: A coat of arms is REAL heraldry if you can describe it in traditional heraldic language (it can be "blazoned") and it does not break too many rules of good heraldic design (contrast, layout, etc.).  Most of the coats of arms on the internet are REAL heraldry.<br>  <br>  REALLY YOURS: A coat of arms is REALLY yours if you acquired it without breaking any laws (applies only to the UK) and either you acquired it by designing your own or by inheriting it from your patrilineal ancestor. There are no surname coats of arms which are owned by everyone with the same surname.   The coats of arms on the internet  associated with your surname are (99.9% of the time) ***NOT***  REALLY YOURS.<br>  <br>  DIRT FARMERS:  I need to reply to a poster who says dirt farmers in Norway can't have arms.  They do, and a lot of them did!  There is no country where coat of arms are limited to knights and nobility.  In fact, the vast majority of  arms are owned by common folk.<br>  <br>  FINDING YOURS:  You  need to research your male-line ancestry.  You might find that your ancestor did bear arms, and thus you would inherit them.   Another option is to design your own.  It's perfectly legal and people do it all the time.  There are groups, such as the IAAH, who help people with designs, for free! www.amateurheralds.org<br>  <br>  CONCLUSION:  Don't buy surname arms.  That's stealing.  And don't think that heraldry is for the upper class -- most countries don't see it that way.|`|gb1BGP8xaa	You don't have one, unless you have created it yourself.<br>  Crests were awarded to individuals, not families.<br>  <br>  I bought one years ago for my dad, who was thrilled with it.   <br>  But know I know that a dirt poor farm family from Norway would not ever have crest, and the crest on the certificate was for a city in Holland.

t9mHCugUaa	I disagree. The Russo-Jap War of 1904-05 was the first major turning point of the 20th century. It led to the collapse of tsarist Russia and shifted the balance of power in East Asia which eventually led to Japanese involvement in WWII.<br>  <br>  WWI was a global conflict because it involved almost all of the major wold powers at the time.|`|AA10725882	Agree.<br>  WWI led to WWII which led to the Cold War and the Bipolar World which lasted until 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed.  History builds on previous events/experiences.<br>  <br>  Was WWI global ? - of course it was.<br>  <br>  In 1914 European countries controlled all of Africa except Ethiopia and Liberia.  India and Southeast Asia were European satellites.  China was being exploited by every major European power plus Japan.<br>  <br>  The suicidal war between European powers sucked in everyone except South Americans.<br>  <br>  WWI did not end with a surrender - only an armistice.<br>  Hostilities were renewed in Europe in 1939 (1931 in Asia).<br>  <br>  <br>  Indian and African troops fought on the Western front in WWII.  Why should these men care who won?<br>  <br>  And I neglected to mention the Middle East which was also a theater of war in WWI.  The result was European domination of the entire Middle East by 1919 - when oil production was in its early years.  Iraq was created by Great Britain after WWI.<br>  <br>  Added note - "IamCount" below also has a good idea.  The battle of the Tsushima Strait in May 1905 did announce to the world that the Japanese were catching up on military technology and that the European hegemony over the world would not go on undisputed in the 20th century.|`|KHSOVxViaa	I disagree.<br>  <br>  I think the first successful manned flight was a major turning point, well before the war.<br>  <br>  It's consequences have greatly affected mankind, and will continue to do so long after the wars of the 20th century have faded from view.|`|q9D1mCJnaa	Disagree<br>  the Panama Channel change the world for ever

Therefore adults know more than kids do because they have been both.<br>  This is why.<br>  I DONT AGREE.|`|LGidAYDwaa	Because adults have the experience and knowledge to know whether an idea will work or not. They also have a hard time explaining why the kid's idea won't work, just because you can't exactly sum up 20 or 30 years of life in a five-minute speech.|`|8a6npzfKaa	Because adults beilve that our minds havent matured enough yet to fully understand and act on a certain subject.<br>  <br>  I agree|`|kTc3bfrRaa	only  when  they  are  acting   and  talking in  a  mature  manner  can that happen..<br>  <br>   Otherwise..  its  not  worth the  effort.

There are several different books, kind of like the Icewind Dale books. <br>  <br>  The authors are Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis. <br>  <br>  Books<br>  Chronicles: Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Dragons of Winter Night, Dragons of Spring Dawning, Dragons of Summer Flame<br>  Legends Trilogy: Time of the Twins, War of the Twins, Test of the Twins<br>  Other: Second Generation

Uiew8yuCaa	I believe there are sites for dna testing. Have you thought about asking your parents? I know this is sensitive for some of them so I wouldn't push it. Your father might surprise you, who knows, maybe he didn't even know about you.<br>  <br>  It's important for you to know your heritage. Keep on looking. I have a nephew that was given up for adoption about 45 years ago. Things were different then, good luck.|`|AA11053540	Blond(e) hair/blue eyes are normally associated with the Nordlanders, Scandinavians, Swedes, Danes, etc. However, they can come from many parts of the world.<br>  You don't "need help deciding"; just have a DNA test done and it will provide you with information regarding whence your paternal ancestors and maternal ancestors originated.<br>  The site I used is www.familytreedna.com, the best, biggest, and oldest. They also do DNA testing for the Narional Geographics Genotype Program.<br>  Good luck!|`|AA12343309	You sound like a Northern European.<br>  <br>  DNA testing might help. However, a company that only uses Y & Mitochondrial will only give you results for a tiny part of your ancestry.<br>  <br>  There are 3 types of DNA tests.<br>  <br>  Y which goes from father to son only<br>  <br>  Mitochondrial which goes from mother to both sons and daughters but only the daughters pass it on to their children.<br>  <br>  Autosomal which is what most of your DNA is and you get it 50-50 from both parents.<br>  <br>  If you only have your Y & Mitochondrial done, right off the bat it will exclude your paternal grandmother and maternal grandfather.  If you get back to your 6xgreat grandparents, you come from 510 individuals. Of those 510 individuals you get your Y from only 8 and your Mitochondrial from only 8 leaving out 494 people.  <br>  <br>  Y & Mitochondrial are good for people in family history who want to match themselves with other family trees as they both go back in a straight line virtually unchanged.  One company that only uses Y & Mitochondrial advertises that they will help you discover "your deep ancestral roots."  It is true they will show you the origin of your nomadic ancestors going back thousands of years, but it is ONLY in 2 lines and they can tell you specifically in those 2 lines ONLY where your ancestors came from.  You come from a myriad of family lines, not just the 2 that you get your Y & Mitochondrial. <br>  <br>  There is one company that will take your Autosomal DNA and match you with population groups throughout the world and show you your top matches.  They won't tell you you are 1/2 of something, 1/4 of something else and 1/4 of another something else.  What they will do is show you your top matches. The same DNA crosses national, ethnic and racial boundaries.  FamilyTreeDNA does do Autosomal testing but they won't give you an analysis.  I think at one time they did.  I had to send my Autosomal results from FamilyTreeDNA to DNATribes to get an analysis.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.DNAtribes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.DNAtribes.com</a><br>  <br>  When you go into their website if you go under "feedback" there is a way you can email them and ask questions.<br>  <br>  I asked DNATribes if my sister with whom I share both parents had the same Autosomal test would her results be the same and they replied.<br>  <br>  "Two siblings will each obtain unique results.  Family members do typically share some regional or ethnic affiliations, but in some cases matches can vary substantially between siblings."<br>  <br>  While you get your Autosomal 50-50 from both parents, you don't get it 25-25-25-25 from grandparents.  You get 50% from your paternal grandparents and the same from your maternal grandparents, but it isn't even steven between grandfather and grandmother.<br>  <br>  Now, I can see if there is more than one company doing this type of Autosomal testing you can get different results if one company does not have some population samples that another company has.|`|E11fB7iAaa	You very well could be Scandinavian. Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and even Germany have a lot of blond-haired, blue-eyed fair people. Although, the European Spanish side of my family are blond, blue-eyed with fair skin.  <br>  <br>  Go figure.|`|gb1BGP8xaa	You certainly sound like your heritage is Northern European, especially Swedish.  There are lots of Swede descendants here in Minnesota with the same coloring, including me.<br>  You can research on your mother if you know her name.  <br>  You can also get an DNA heritage test.|`|weEXCCfXaa	i would guess scandinavian, german, or english...the english resemble germans in many ways.  DNA tests will tell you.|`|XwV1bar5aa	you do sound scandanavian, most probably swedish, but it is pretty difficult to decifer someone's heritage based on looks since there isn't really a set look for every country. i suggest you get some more info from the apoption agancy

They are tiny mythical folk of diminutive human form and possessing magical powers (according to my dictionary).<br>  My mother swears she saw some in the bottom of her garden when she was a child. (She is not a mentally unstable person, far, far from it!)<br>  I think just because you haven't seen something doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't or cannot exist.<br>  I certainly like the concept of fairies Shakespeare employed in A Midsummer Night's Dream.
