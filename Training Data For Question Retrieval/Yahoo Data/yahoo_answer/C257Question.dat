20090205191503AAnY0wO	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Strange one for ya, all you oasis fans?	This is quite genuine i promise you, its something i found in one of my books on Dreams, you know the ones, when i wake up i look up what ive seen etc etc anyway one morning i woke with the desire to look up the word OASIS, i must of seen it or heard it or whatever, so i looked up the word and this is what it said word for word i havent added anything or tampered with it in any way and i quote OASIS. All around the world an oasis is viewed as a place of sanctuary,where we may live forever in peace and contentment whilst receiving emotional invigoration. Our worries and anxieties should cast no shadow,until they eventually fade away into a distant blur. We then feel fully refreshed and can come together to stepout and roll with whatever life throws at us.         Now thats it, but what do you SEE? I saw something right away, so is it a big coincidence? You tell me folks.

20090205192036AAP8Ygf	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	When an Aries says I love you?	When an Aries guy tells you he loves you after not seeing him for so long, does he mean it? We've been together before in a way well more like we were aware of the feelings we had for each other. Even though we haven't seen each other for 2 years he'd come out of nowhere to say hello and stuff. Then suddenly he started tellin me how we should hang out sometime and that he wishes that our families knew each other so he can spend some time with me. He's always telling me to call and that the only reason he doesn't call me because I told him not to call me (over-protective dad).       So when he tells me all of this, what is he trying to say?      Does he truly love me like he says?      I'm a pisces sun, pisces moon, virgo rising, aries venus, pisces mars and a lot of water.      He's an aries sun, sag moon, taurus rising, aries venus, mars pisces and has a lot of water in his chart.      Please give me answers from experience, observations, internet sources, or simply how you feel about the situation.      Thank you. =)

20090205192325AAtsD8Z	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	What's up with the two fansubbers or editers of the anime Chrono Crusade?	Anime: Chrno Crusade or Chrono Crusade.      Two Fansubbers: AtwO vs Ani-Kraze.      I think Ani-Kraze subs the older video of Chrno Crusade.   I think AtwO subs a remastered version of Chrno Crusade.   (Note: remastered = the video was cleaned to make it look new).      So, the problem is the remastered version has Sister Rosette's hair colour all wrong!  Instead of yellow, they had it to be more into orange.      I'm having a conflict/dilemma.     choose Ani-Kraze ----> watch a bit-blurry video with the correct colour of Rosette's hair.   choose AtwO ----> watch a clear video but have Rosette's hair all wrong.      See, my eyes hurt when watching blurry videos, my eyes also hurt when watching a wrongly coloured character.  Rosette is an awesome character and its hard to see her ruined.      Anyway, just wondering why these people ruined an awesome character like Rosette.      Is there any other subbers I could get whose video is clean and with the correct colour of Rosette hair?      sorry, just frustrated 'cause i'm wasting my money and time buying both and then watching both.

If there is anyone on here that can shed some light on this issue, please answer this because i am REALLY looking forward to a season 3. Thanks in advance. ^_^

20090205193447AAfpaXx	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Falling in love with love. I thought this was suppose to be a Libra-only trait? I'm an Aquarius though.. Help!?	I have this small dilemma, you see, I tend to fall in love with the idea of being in love. A person I am attracted to sparks those thoughts and I somehow get stuck inside them and the idea of being in love. Obviously I don't love that person since I don't know them.      My sun is under Aquarius   Moon and Mars under Sagittarius   Mercury and Venus under Capricorn   Ascendant under... well, Libra... (this could be my problem)      It doesn't help that my Sun sign is a Fixed sign which makes me rather stubborn. Not to mention my Venus under Capricorn adds to that stubborness by being selfless and faithful. Lastly, my Libra Ascendant... perfect combination for a hopeless romantic. Anyone have any advice? How can I get over my crush? Or better yet, how can I approach my crush? In all honesty, my logical side and rational self tells me to let it all go and move on before I make a fool out of myself.

20090205182016AAh8a0A	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	THE HILLS. - who's right? LC or Audrina?	The nasty rumor about Lauren (that she had sex with Justin Bobby)was spread around in details and Audrina heard about it. I noticed how when Audrina confronted Lauren, she got mad and almost insulted that her bff would actually doubt their friendship, yet she never said "No, I did not sleep with JB" (Justin Bobby) So, hmmmm.       I agree with Audrina in a way cause you can never be too sure about your friendships these days. Plus, its happened to me so I know how she feels and a little reassurance never hurts anyone..except, of course, Lauren. I think she kinda over reacted and took the whole ordeal completely out of propotion. If it was the other way around, Lauren would be going crazy on Audrina "omg I cant believe this is happening did u or did u not sleep with him blah blah blah" I can only imagineeee. Besides, Lauren confronted Heidi when she thought she was the one spreading the sex tape rumors so if Lauren has the right to doubt Heidi then why cant Audrina doubt Lauren? Thats just MY opinon. Feel free to give me yours.          I LOVEEEE THE HILLS. <3

20090205194436AA7Q7oV	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	What's your favorite band?	Just a question to see peoples answers. Mine is 10 Years. I really love that band. They're one of the few bands that I can listen to over and over and over again and never get sick of them. The lyrics with the music and the vocals is f-ucking amazing and indescribable. They do not have a song out that I don't like. I actually got to meet the lead singer, Jesse, at a concert in December. I got a picture and his autograph on their album Killing All That Holds You along with one of the guitarists, Matt's, autograph. Their concert was definitely the best I've ever been to. Definitely my favorite band in the world.      So what's your favorite band?   And do you like 10 Years?

I read this manga called One and this girl is a really famous teen pop star and she says that in the industry you have to be who they tell you to be. And like, even if you hate another celebrity you still have to act like you like them and what not. In the story, she's a whole other person than what people think she is. She has to look like this sweet innocent girl that likes classical music and stuff but she really isn't that nice and she secretly likes punk rock. So, do you really have to be who the producers tell you to be in order to make it in the entertainment industry? of course this took place in Korea; I don't know how different the industry is in Korea

Okay, there's this song I've heard at Old Navy while I was working, and I've only ever heard it twice.   The music sounds vaguely arabian/middle eastern, and it's really sad sounding. There are no words or sounds of humans anywhere in it.   Then there's another one that sounds vaguely arabian/middle eastern, but it had singing. There are no words, because it is just a man wailing, but it's a really beautiful song. It's driving me crazy, because I can't look up his wailing.   It switches into a minor key a lot, and basically sounds like the most agonizing thing I've ever heard, but I love it and I can't find it anywhere. It's kind of...tribal chant-esque.      Does anyone know what I'm talking about?!

20090205195357AA2XY8d	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Is Lil' Mama from America's Best Dance Crew mentally retarded?	I don't watch the show that often, just when my friends are drunk and want to watch it.  But, every time I see the show, I sincerely feel embarrassed for her.  When she speaks, I try to comprehend what she is saying, but I just can't.  Her critiques of the dancing crews aren't really critiques, but rather just a random string of words that aren't even English.  I think I remember her saying she's from Brooklyn (or so I think that's what those words meant), but honestly, does that mean she has to use the present tense when speaking in the past (and vice-versa)?  adding random "t's" and other letters to the ends of words? and generally sounding like a retard who is only capable of talking in ghetto-speak Ebonics?  Also, what made her famous?  I mean, honestly.  Is this what our culture has come to?!

Made by Casio.          http://www.casio.com/products/Musical_In...       or       http://www.casio.com/products/Musical_In...       I figure the 88-key keyboard will give me more sound choices when i play, but it might be hard learning without lighted keys? and im unsure of getting the 61 lighted key keyboard because it won't give me as many sound choices? I'm interested in eventually making my own music at home. Not like a big time person, but just for some fun-at-home-freestyling with a musical keyboard.

20090205204632AAFedKp	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Cancers Please tell me if it sounds like my Cancer is in love with me?	We've been dating for 2 month and I know that he cares about me a lot, he shows it, but he never told me "I love you". So I've been wondering how he feels about me. Few weeks ago we were having sex, after I made him a nice dinner and I said "Isn't your girlfriend awesome?" and his response was "She is, I love her a lot." That caught me off guard so I stopped and just looked at him, after which he changed it and said "I like her a lot." I didn't pay attention to that just because he said it with his pants off and never said it before or after. But lately when we are chatting online he's referring to me as "Hi Love." and everything has been really good between us.      So when we were talking today, at the end he said "Kisses honey, I lo..... miss you" I definitely heard I lo..... but I just said bye. He knows that I'm very careful with his words, but I wonder if he loves me or not. What do you think from the examples that I gave?

I honestly don't believe Beyonce went out there to be disrespectful to Etta. If Etta was asked to do the same rendition of another great artist's song in the same situation, I believe she would've jumped at the opportunity. I just think Etta is letting her insecurities get the best of her and it's time she does some soul searching and grow up.

I took my 11 year old daughter to see them in concert, and was REALLY dreading it, but was actually surprised at how talented they actually are. It's not my kind of music, but I can see why teen girls like them.      They remind me of another bubble gum teen pop band that came out in the early 60's. Singing about love and holding hands. Young long haired guys that write their own music, play their own instruments, all of the young teen girls scream and cry every time they see them. Taking the country by storm......give them a break, they just might be around 20 years from now. Who knows!?!?      FYI....They had a recording contract BEFORE Disney put them on TV, so please don't bring that up.

Yes, this is a real school assignment. Who do you think would win and why?      The most common argument is that Batman could just use kryptonite. But how many of Superman's villains have used kryptonite and Superman has always come out on top? In Superman Returns, he even lifts a large land mass that's infected with kryptonite and tosses it into space.      Your thoughts?

Umm, all of the songs from this title are amazing but still the probably most simple song of them all catches my heart. It stunned me the first time I heard it and I felt like humming along in the theaters xD   It is referred to several times in the movie:   - At the boab tree during the time when Jackman and Kidman dances the chinese guy, Sing Song plays on his guitar while humming a melody.   - Again at the boab tree when the two split and Jackman walks around the tree getting sort of flashbacks from their time there, his buddy whistles, first the song from Wizard of Oz and then this tune I'm looking for.   - One last time it is heard in the end of the movie when the text appears about some facts about the government and the aboriginals. This version is the same as the first one at the boab tree.      I truely love this song, and I wanna know who wrote it or if it's just a normal Australian melody or something. If you could please tell me the name or maybe a link to get it it would be nice.      And the song goes like 'nana na na nana na na' there's no lyrics besides some humming.

I think he makes a deal with him so she can get all her red orbs back back too.And somewhere between then and the end he takes here to one of those wishing trees that has one of those white and black ribbons around it and tells her that if you tie a ribbon to it or make a wish it ll come true.  and the last thing i can remember is the warrior getting all of the red balls and riding in her pet or weapon and they plunge into a ocean from outer space and her weapon sounds like a squeal squeal when it talks.

I can't think of anything good, I'm low on cash. I've missed him so much and I want to do something thoughtful to show him what he means to me.        Any ideas? Nothing too cheesy please, he's a bit on the serious side! Thanks!

They say "Its no big deal she was just playing around" Or "shes a teenager, its ok there is an asian person in the picture" because i think that this does not make it okay. Its is not okay for anyone to be racist to anyone even if they are a popular celebrity at the time. I think this is stupid and people shouldnt say its okay cause its not and it is offensive.

No one was there even when she was alive.   She was not seen or heard.   But I knew she was there.      Chorus:   I went to a funeral today.   While there were no mourners to pray.   The casket was empty, but I could see:   The girl in there was me.      Verse:   She wanted to be heard and yelled in my ear.   Her words were sh*t; she was not there.   I snuffed her out.   Because there just wasn't room.      Chorus      Bridge:    Why wouldn't I listen?   Because when she'd gone   I lost a part of me.      Chorus 2x, then fades.

Please don't talk to me about expensive tickets.....People don't drive 35,000 dollar cars and not be able to afford concert tickets.   Also Bon Jovi does not suck...It was actually one of the best concerts I have been to.

Little David was in his 5th grade class when the teacher asked the children what their fathers did for a living.All the typical answers came up - fireman, policeman, salesman,etc. David was being uncharacteristically quiet and so the teacher asked him about his father 'My father's an exotic dancer in a gay bar and takes off all his clothes in front of other men. Sometimes, if the offer's really good, he'll go out to the alley with some guy and make love with him for money.' The teacher, obviously shaken by this statement, hurriedly set the other children to work on some colouring, and took little David aside to ask him, 'Is that really true about your father?' 'No,' said David, 'He plays for Toronto Maple Leafs but I was too embarrassed to say that in front of the other kids.'

20090205214256AAT62nx	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Do you find yourself listening to the radio less as you get older?	I remember listening to the radio a lot when I was a kid all the way up to my freshman year in college.  However, I rarely listen to the radio anymore.  It seems like the only times I'm listening to the radio are when I'm in someone else's car or when I'm helping my Mom in the kitchen.        I'm 21 years old now and I pretty much listen to music on my ipod everywhere I go...at school, in the bathroom, in the kitchen, when I'm exercising, etc.  Even when I'm in the car, I always play a cd and rarely listen to the radio.  I know the radio is a good way to discover new songs and artists, but I do that through itunes and youtube and I also watch 106 & Park.       Does technology have any influence why we listen to the radio less?  Maybe it's because of the commercials, or the clarity of the reception, or just because some dj's talk a lot?

It seemed find but after plugging it in it at first made a loud engine revving sound that slowly sunk down to silence.  Then, without playing anything, a continuous and rhythmic beating sound began to come out of the amp.  When I play with any of the pickups on the sound comes through very harshly and only in this rhythmic timing (the sound cuts off and on in time). I've never seen this type of problem before and am wondering where it could come from, and how much it would cost to fix.

20090205213102AAB9jk8	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	What is your opinion on this song I wrote?!?	The story on this song is, today I was having a very bad emotional day, and my mom told me that my hormones are acting up. So I went up to my room, and just started writing, and I came up with this song.       Mainly this song is about those times in a teenager's life (or maybe even adults) when hormones and emotions are running wild, and its just one of those depressing days when you feel like no one cares, and you're all alone, and I tried to capture that feeling when writing this. SO BE HONEST !!      [I don't have a verse 2, because its not quite finished yet]   SO here it is: [deep breath, lol]      --------------------------------------...      Verse 1:   They all say things would be better, if you look on the bright side.   The bright side's filled with shadows, of the things you want to hide.   I decide my life, I must have made a mistake along the way   to make me regret every single day.   I dream of being pleased, dream of finding love.   I dream that I find happiness without the push and shove.   I hope that would day I, would shine like the sky   flying in the air, and not wanting to die.   Maybe its teenage hormones, maybe its just life & strife   Maybe I kept my eyes closed to long ; and missed the happiness in this life.      Climb/ Pre Chorus :   Call in the white doves   I want to feel the rush of delight, the joy of being loved.   The feeling of satisfaction   the one we all dream of,    but i guess dreaming aint enough.      Chorus:   Will there ever be a time when things are alright,   will you ever help me through the night ?   Would you hold on to me so close and tight?   Make me think twice, about keeping my life,   dealing with the pain, wishing things would change, fighting through the rain.      Verse 2:   (haven't written yet, sorry!)      Climb/ Pre Chorus :   Call in the white doves   I want to feel the rush of delight, the joy of being loved.   The feeling of satisfaction   the one we all dream of,    but i guess dreaming aint enough.      Chorus:   Will there ever be a time when things are alright,   will you ever help me through the night ?   Would you hold on to me so close and tight?   Make me think twice, about keeping my life,   dealing with the pain, wishing things would change, fighting through the rain.      Bridge:   I'll hold my breath, and wait till it happens   the moment when everything is in my hands   The point in life when joy and love takes over   from where i'm going, to where i've been   when I find myself, and make this end.

However, he wakes up the next morning and is alive! He looks into a mirror and unbuttons his shirt and says "bullet holes?" I think he even inserted a finger in it, but it wasn't bleeding. He was just confusingly looking into the mirror wondering why he was still alive or how they got there. No idea, but his mom is calling his name from another room for some reason. Wierd I know, but I was 5 so I cant remember much more.
