044IeGstaa	A. It doesn't matter what the graphics ram is for the graphics card, because the graphics card runs independent, of the computer system resources.    Graphics card's have their own graphics processor (GPU) and graphics ram. This is why they are the thing to use, because they don't need to borrow from the system processor and ram resources.     Borrowing from the system resources slows the computer down.    B.Doesn't matter, if you have a graphics card with DDR2, GDDR3, GDDR4, or GDDR5 graphics ram. As long as you have the correct graphics expansion slot, (Like the PCI-Express x16 slot you mentioned), AND enough wattage, plus 12 volt Amps, you can run that graphics card.    If your system processor isn't up to the task, however, it will 'bottleneck' graphics info (Data) coming to it.      However for an Nvidia GeForce 8600GT, you should have no worries here, just watch the power supply -> power needed.    Edit: Oh Yeah. You asked what the difference is between DDR2 and DDR3.  Let's start with basic ram knowledge,  1.http://computer.howstuffworks.com/ram.ht...

NAGiNKFWaa	I am currently typing on an HP Pavilion, I don't remember how many years I have had it.  For what I use it for it is just fine, except for yahoo answers.  I apparently bump something when I type the word "you" and whatever I typed vanishes into outer space, however, my husband can type on it with no problem.  He uses a lap top at work.  It takes me longer to answer questions on the lap top than it does a regular computer, but our regular computer is down right now.  However, since I am potty training a puppy, it is nice to move the lap top to the room she decides we are going to train in that day.  I would suggest that you look into a company that has tech support that speaks English clearly, so if you have a dilemma, you won't kill anyone.  I think Dell might still have tech support.  One of the things I don't like about the lap tops is that the ones I have had get really hot, compared to a regular computer.  I guess I like this computer simply for the programs I have installed on it, I don't know that for me, a brand matters, as much as the software I happen to use.  Still praying for you all and Zoe.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	I have an HP lap top that my grandmas husband gave to me. I like it because it works like it is brand new and it is about 7 years old.

If your image is in the root folder for your website there is no need to put in the location, however if your image is in a sub folder, ie. called images, you will need to put in images/background.jpg.

Hybrid sleep saves any open documents and programs to memory and to your hard disk, and then puts your computer into a low-power state.     Unlike mobile PCs, desktop computers typically don't have battery-based power backup. So if a sudden power failure occurs to a desktop computer in standard sleep mode, data loss could occur.    But with hybrid sleep turned on, Windows can restore your work from your hard disk. On desktop computers, hybrid sleep is typically turned on by default.    When hybrid sleep is turned on, clicking Sleep automatically puts your computer into hybrid sleep. When hybrid sleep is turned off, or if your computer doesn't support hybrid sleep, clicking Sleep puts the computer to sleep.|`|uYUGdcfzaa	Go to control panel/power options.

UWce18YYaa	The best motherboard is one that suits your purposes. Generally, I'd look for ones that had the most features possible, and the most RAM supported, for the least cost.        For gaming in particular, if your case allows it, I'd get a full-size ATX mobo (most room for components). High FSB speed, support for the latest & greatest processors (Intel socket 775/core i7, or AMD AM2/AM2+)  gigabit LAN, and multiple PCI (preferably PCI Express) slots for your sound and video cards.         Granted, there are some mobo's with pretty good onboard audio and video, but choosing a couple of good cards will give you exactly what you want, they'll take some of the load off the CPU and memory, and you'll have the onboard stuff as a backup if your card(s) fail.      I prefer to make it as upgradeable as possible to get the most life out of it, so to me it's worth it to spend a little extra for a board which supports the latest processors and faster memory, in other words something that will still be around and affordable in a couple of years and will let me upgrade as well (amount of RAM, for example). Oh, and if you have a clear-sided case, something with a bunch of bright colors doesn't hurt either. Depending on where you shop, you can get a decent mobo from the $75 dollar range on up that will last for a while.|`|af3a28b07826dce8ecfc28a5eaa91e13aa	Look for one with 4 ram slots, and total amount of ram supported, fast FSB-1000 to 1333. It should have 1 or 2 pci express slots, 2 if you want to run dual video cards.

dkpIjt5jaa	Two things come to my mind, as you mentioned using Limewire, getting a page cannot be displayed browser error but still being able to have a signal.    1) Your driver may be faulty so uninstall the one you have and reinstall the latest version. ( Download the latest on an USB stick )    2) It could be the new nasty breed of virus called Malware. ( I've answered a few questions with the same problem on different computers )    So an affirmation to start: 1) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware, do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned and DO NOT REFORMAT unless it is your last resort.    Now for the main part: Malware is one of the worst kind of viral infection, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in router's firmware). Virus scanners (which are mostly blind to it) and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    So DON'T take chances with it !!!    Get the programs I listed from another computer ( Public Library ) onto a USB stick. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If something blocks you from using MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, make sure your virus scanner database is updated.    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again. Also check if your wireless card can be reset.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !    And as a bonus, your computer will be cleaner and probably a bit zippier ( all that for free ! )|`|iE2sDxDAaa	Refresh the connection (Disconnect and reconnect).

ivoF1c3Kaa	OK first off you need somewhere to host your website, to get a good host with your own personal domain name you will need to pay for a host, you will also need to buy the domain name for your web page, you can buy these at GoDaddy.com, some websites will give you the hosting space and domain at the same time which saves a bit of hassle.    Then when you get all that you will need to learn how to create web pages. Web pages are most commonly and easily made using HTML, there are many different HTML tutorials on the internet. The one which I have found the best is w3schools.net.

VPlzkvSGaa	Sounds like a bandwidth issue to me. The video link will slow down if network bandwidth is limited.    Probably there's congestion issues in parts of the internet service provider's network. You'll get good performance when your video link happens to avoid the congested areas, but when you hit a congestion spot the frame rates drop.    If my assumption is correct, there's unfortunately not much you can do about it. You may get better performance with a different ISP... but on the other hand, you may not.    If Windows Live Messenger has a setting to adjust video resolution, you should try reducing it. You'll get lower video fidelity but hopefully higher frame rates.|`|uKaYB5oYaa	buya logitech webcam i wont lie to you i have  a 0.3mp webcam from logitech and i get 27.9 frames

7vh5fOeRaa	GHz is simply a measurement of speed.  When used in association with your processor, the GHz is meant as an expression of how many computations your processor can perform over a given period of time.  Generally speaking, the more GHz, the faster the processor.    Think of the comparison to a car.  Let's say that car X has two different models; one with a 300hp engine and another with a 500hp engine.  Obviously, the one with the 500hp engine will be faster.  GHz in processors works in generally the same fashion.    That's not to say that this is the only determining factor you should use.  Using the car example again... if the only driving you ever do is to go back and forth to work on a crowded highway at 45mph, then do you really need the 500hp car?  In this case, it would be wise to save money, buy the cheaper car, and put the cash you save into something else.    With a computer, you have to ask yourself, "What am I going to use this computer for?"  If all you are going to use it for is to surf the net and read some e-mail, you can save your money and buy the 2.0GHz model.  However, if you are going to be doing video editing, sound editing, gaming, or any other high-end task, then I'd recommend spending the money and getting the faster computer.    Now GHz isn't the end-all be-all of computer speed.  The amount of memory, bus speed, and a host of other factors can also contribute to the overall speed of a computer... but the speed of the processor is the generally accepted standard where most people look first.    Given that the price difference between the two computers is only $200 and you are getting 400MHz more (a 20% speed increase) AND you are also getting 90GB more drive space, I'd say it would be worth it to spend the extra $200.  In the long run, you'll find the extra speed and drive space very worthwhile.    Hope that helped you out!|`|9mVjm7K1aa	gigahertz    (g?g'?-h?rtz', j?g'-)  Pronunciation Key    n.   Abbr. GHz   A unit of frequency equal to one billion (109) hertz. Also called gigacycle.      Means you'll be either be doing 2 billion cycles per second or 2.4 billion cycles per second.  2.4 is a much faster cycle but you may not notice it at all.  Could be significant depending on what you are using it for.  Would recommend the 2.4 just to get the latest.    harddrive space - 160gb is good but 250 is much more.  :)  160 gb is sufficient for 80% of computer users out there.  You can always supplement later with an external harddrive which I'd recommend anyway to back up important files.|`|877735ce9e7f40eb68b7e0b4ac7b0c9faa	Hello..Ghz is the processor frequency..Giga hertz..the .4 for 200 bucks is crazy...and unless your doing movies or have a crap load of music..then the extra 90 gig of hard drive space..is going to be a waste..Hope this helps..

I presume you want to play some games with it as you want a dedicated GPU. So that comes down to which games and how much are you prepared to spend.    At the top end: playing Crysis and other GPU intensive games on a laptop, you'd be looking at a 8800m gts or gtx GPU or the ATI equivalent. In the UK novotech recently had a special offer of such a laptop for only under 700 which is stunning.    less intensive stuff and you'll get away with an 8400m/8600m but the visuals will be less stunning.    Older retro games from Y2K till 2K4 will probably play on a rig with integrated GPU which has 3D capacity.    If it's just for watching vids/DVDs, don't worry about dedicated GFX.    Possible links in the UK:    http://www.amazon.co.uk/Toshiba-Satellit...    http://direct.tesco.com/q/R.204-6446.asp...    http://www.ebuyer.com/product/151290/sho...    http://www.ebuyer.com/search/?qfind=6735    The last link shows a few variations of the HP 6735s which is probably a good bet if you aren't gaming at all or going for some older games - read the reviews of the 419 model somebody says they've been playing left 4 dead on it at playable FPS. If a game will play at 30fps on it, it is playable. At less than 25 fps it would be a bit jittery and irritating.    If I get one I'll post frame rates and detail levels of any games run on it    So what do you need it for? And why not a desktop?

Database is for Microsoft Access lol), write the formula on one box only, and to make this formula apply for a whole row/column (but still corresponding to the right boxes), just click that little box on the bottom right corner and drag.    I think this will work, so when you enter new row/column the formula auto goes there.    Otherwise, just tell that technologically challenged to make that new row, highlight the row you want copy, and right click > Copy. Go to new row, Right Click > Paste.

(The sound that you here from your speakers)  Microphone recording.  http://www.download.com/Jing-Project/300...    The downside is that most free screen recorders are with limited editing feature or no editing features at all. If you are going to make some software tutorials, I would suggetst DemoCreator.   http://www.sameshow.com/demo-creator.htm...
QdJNKB3jaa	http://www.modthesims2.com/wiki.php?titl...    also  not sure if this will help with your active x  http://www.compatdb.org/support/topics/1...    I can only suggest, going to EA for a game fix,   lowering your graffic card settings, switching off everything else that you are not using, ram savers, anti virus etc (be off line when u play),   Is your power supply unit powerful enough for you new graffic card ?  Does your graffic card work fine with other games ?    Am sure some companies release games with bugs on them just so you have to go back to their pages to get fixes,   a sort of checking up on who is using original games and who is not type thing,   only in computing can u release sub standard goods onto the market and get away with it.   Good luck, have never played sims, so can not help more. x

DyRWGPYIaa	Right, it sounds to me as though you have onboard graphics. Basically,  you're graphics driver is either out of date or theirs a fault with it.    If you can find out what graphics adapter you have, then just simply google the name of it, and you should find quite a few drivers free to download and install.    Then simply restart your PC and it will work :)    If you need more of a "walkthrough" then feel free to email me on    tommm2142@live.com

His exploits have become so renowned that a French word has been coined to describe the act of being creamed: entarter.    Perhaps one of the most famous men in the French-speaking world, Godin himself is called "L'entarteur," or "the Pieman." He often appears on TV shows and films and is an author of a book about his exploits.    Those who take Godin's public creamings with good humor are never bothered again. However, L'entarteur has been known to repeatedly target people who react with ill humor to his antics, what he calls the "revolt of laughter."|`|3cae1a173ced8370d2a6d3af83b9b006aa	If I remember right, lol, it had something to do with the expression 'pie in the face' and the release of the Service Pack for the new Windows 98...   ;-)  As soon as you bought the new Windows you had to update it...!

npipQ5Tyaa	A notebook should never be always be in charge or plugged in because there is something called Battery Memory, if the computer is new, charge it only when its completely out and when it fully charged again take it off charge. Trust me, this will let your battery last longer, and if you don't want the screen to get dark you can go to battery options and choose high performance, but the battery won't last that longer anymore. I'm so upset that labtops are like this...they should make labtops that when they are plugged in, they should get energy from the plug and when you take it off it goes with battery. I messed up my labtop because of this problem, my battery lasts like 30 minutes because i didn't do that. Next time i get a new labtop i should do it.|`|rMs4WBfcaa	No it won't hurt it to leave it plugged in|`|ixsEoSVDaa	No, that's the joy of having a laptop. So you can move around with it.

Usually the "gears" are located on the arrow keys, but you may have to look for them  Hope this helps

If the file name is not the same, I know that certain characters can cause video player to not able to play that file, you may want to change the file name.  If even the file name is the same, it is possible some other program already using the file, try reboot the computer or rename the file to some other name and see what happen.  Or may be the file permission is not set right.  Try check the file Properties/Security.

If you want to do that, Flash CS3 or CS4 is the ticket - with a reasonable amount of time, you can design a custom player for your videos that includes all kinds of buttons (even full screen). The timers are not included in the premade players, but you could write one fairly easily in actionscript.     It's important to note that playing flash videos requires two things:   1. The .swf containing your player  2. The .flv video file (this is the actual video)    so when you implement this on your website, you place the player in your html page, and then make sure that the .flv is in the same directory as the player.

dfwi5rClaa	Actually, WoW should run pretty decent.    The Acer Aspire ONE actually has a GMA 950 in it, and that DOES run fast enough to run WoW. Also, 1 GB of ram, and 120 GB hard drive makes it pretty decent for WoW. Not many other games will run very well. Although Wolfenstien will run good as well.    All in all, you're better off with a regular notebook though.    The Aluminium Macbooks run WoW at very high frame rate on high settings ;)|`|48e9baf113e4951f779199c900a19f63aa	If a netbook runs Vista and only has 1GB of RAM, have fun trying to play WoW. My boyfriend has 3GB of RAM w/ Vista and has to run WoW at extremely low settings. Even better is that if the server has lag, it gets so slow that it's unplayable. I'm not exaggerating.  I would highly recommend against doing it. Also because Netbooks have low end video cards in them and the game graphics would be blobs of color.|`|VPlzkvSGaa	With computers, you usually get what you pay for. Netbooks are cheap because they don't have great performance. They're intended for people who want good mobility and don't require great performance.    WoW and DotA don't require top of the line hardware, but I think you'll want something more powerful than a netbook. Performance costs money, there's no way around it!|`|ngSkGNdCaa	NO netbooks are made for gaming. they will not meet the minimum requirements for most games, so you probably won't even be able to install WoW. this is why they're called NETbooks. they're for the internet.

BMConIedaa	First of all, did you bother running the code in the problem?  What error messages did you get?  If you have, this should be painfully obvious, if you've been paying any attention at all in class.    P1 and P2 are both structures that contain two ints.  They have different names, and their members have different names as well.  They both will contain the exact amount of space in memory.  But you're going to get an error when you recompile the code with the comments un-commented.  What should that mean?|`|HAgd5asNaa	I'm sorry, but I'm not sure how many people understand this kind of stuff.

Alternatively you could use iWork09 with keynote 09 which is much better and works with Powerpoint - or use iWork08 which you should have.
dfwi5rClaa	Every G3 Model DOES have a USB port. Although it is only USB 1.1-  not fast enough for video.    If the USB ports are not working however, you can use a PCMIA to USB adaptor, then plug a USB capture device in.    However, I doubt a G3 could input live video very well.    the ram would have to be maxed out.    Remember, a 9-year old laptop usually won't run all that great.    Unless you upgrade the G3 daughter card to a G4 as well.    but then you're paying entirely too much money.    my recomendation-- buy a refurbished Macbook. The Intel models are sooo much faster!

AA11703028	hi kacper             allthough the amount of memory that a graphic card has is a major factor when buying there are more important factors to take into consideration such as memory clock and bandwidth,core clock and memory bus interface            the 1GB ATI Radeon 2400PRO is a pretty weak card and only has a inferior 64bit memory bus interface and a poor 800mhz memory clock speed,in games like need for speed most wanted this would suffer badly and this card should be avoided             the Sapphire ATI Radeon HD4850 on the other hand is a excellent peice of hardware and dont be confused with the 512mb memory,this is just the amount of graphic memory and is the standard memory size in the majority of gaming cards these days,the only reason cards like the 2400pro have larger memorys is to make up for the abysmal core and memory clocks             as for the Sapphire ATI Radeon HD4850 this has some amazing specifications including a 625mhz core clock and 512mb of gddr3 memory running at 993mhz( 1986mhz ddr effective) and combined with the excellent 256bit memory bus interface this equates to a memory bandwidth of 63.5gb/sec,this is awesome especially when compared to the miniscule 6.4gb/sec found in the 2400pro              as for gaming the Sapphire ATI Radeon HD4850 will allow you to run need for speed most wanted on high detail settings and also at higher resolutions             however i have a 3.2ghz pentium 4,2gb ram and a geforce 7900gs and i still experience lag in this title,and from forums were i have discussed this i have discovered its a problem with the way all the "need for speed" titles have been coded(written),and also the need for speed series was primarily designed for the console platform              my main concern with your specifications is the 1.4ghz processor,this is borderline for the required cpu speed required to run this game,so allthough the Sapphire ATI Radeon HD4850 would significanly improve the frame rates and performance you may still find a little under-performance in the game              summary : so basically the 2400pro is a budget card that uses a small 64bit memory bus interface and is only designed as a entry level upgrade for pc owners moving from a onboard graphics solution               however the Sapphire ATI Radeon HD4850 is a excellent mid to high end gaming card that will improve your gaming experience significantly and with a 256bit memory bus thats four times better than the radeon 2400pro this is why this card is more expensive,and in my opinion worth every penny            in short : the amount of memory built into a card is no good if the rest of the specifications are poor,its a bit like having a porsche car with a ford escort engine inside,the car may look good but its main engine(specs) are pretty basic               i hope this helps,,however any problems let me know            good luck kacper !|`|48e9baf113e4951f779199c900a19f63aa	The top one is better because it's of a later generation than the second one down. It's from the 4000 series versus the 2000 series.  I don't know much of anything about ATI but I think they work in generations like NVidia.  The top one is better due to it being newer and better technology, to answer your question.|`|6UwEH15Raa	yes, the top one for 122 is a very capable card, the ebay one is rubbish, no comparison, dont worry about the 1 gig of mem, the other card wipes the floor with it for many reasons.      *********** ok, the top one uses gddr3 mem, the other gddr2, the memory bandwidth and speed of the top one is far superior to the other, the top one has shader model 4 where the other doesnt, the gpu clock speed is higher, it has support for dx10.1 the other doesn't, the top one will play all the current games with the exception of crysis on high, the other one will not, the top one has more pipes and they are faster, there are so many reasons why the top one is better.|`|tFoFchuEaa	Tom's Hardware has a good comparison for video cards if you want to compare the differences between the two.

BUT there is an option that allows you to revert back to your previous operating system so that you can get whatever you need on the internet; a pain in the ****, but kind of helpful at the same time.    if you can't go back to whatever system you had been using before, and you can still get to your internet, (i'm assuming you can, DUH) you can go to all the websites for all the stuff you need, and download drivers.     your old disks that came with your stuff are more than likely no good, as they aren't digitally signed.    if you don't know what models and brands and all that, then you should download either "aida 32" or "everest".    run a system test with either one of those programs, and they will tell you what hardware you are working with, and even provide you with a link to the site where you can get the drivers that you need.    the afore mentioned programs are available for free at:    http://www.download.com  or  http://www.majorgeeks.net    good luck.|`|63a000ca12c0d95732cc2e67d89b7c14aa	Goto Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Computer Management and Disk Management.

There is a simple way to make lost or stolen cell phones useless.    First,  check your cell phone's serial number by keying in the following on your phone:   star-pound-zero-six-pound ( *   0 6   )     The fifteen digit serial number will appear on the screen.   This is unique to your phone. Write it down and keep it safe. Should your cell phone get stolen or lost, you can phone your service provider and give them this code. They will then be able to block your phone, so even if the thief changes the sim card, your phone will be totally useless.    You won't get your phone back, but at least you will get satisfaction knowing that whoever stole it or finds it can't use or sell it.|`|AA11110297	not unless you purchased such a feature when you bought your phone..... otherwise you can call your cell and see if anyone answers and is kind enough to return it ....        just shut off the service to that phone and get a new one...|`|1cc090b8658d514968848b8049791cb9aa	no. people (experts) can change IMEA code and nobody would ever know that it was your phone.|`|AA12155298	There seems no way at this moment but to get a new cell and be more careful

It disables Registry Editor and Task Manager. It changes the Internet Explorer (IE) home page and also modifies registry such that you cannot change the homepage address.      Here are simple steps following which you can get the worm removed from your system:    1) Download this file: http://avsharath.googlepages.com/Disable...    2) Double click on the downloaded file, it will execute to restore from the damage done to registry by the worm.    3) Restart your system.    4) Delete the file svhost32.exe from your Windows folder( If it is present).    5) Delete the file svhost.exe from your Windows folder( If it is present).

Es muy raro que eso suceda en Windows XP... si eso te sucede en Windows 95 o 98 puedes ir a opciones de carpeta y modificar la forma en que se vern las ventanas diciendo que las vers todas como si fuera solo una tal como el de Windows XP. Si estas usando Windows XP entonces tienes un error muy grave talves producido por algun virus o un malware. Limpia tu pc con un buen antivirus (te recomiendo NOD32) o que trates de restaurar systema desde tu panel de control para volver al estado en que si te funcionaba todo bien. Eso que se te cierren solas las ventanas no es normal, si se te cierran las de internet entonces tienes un programa que te est sobreprotegiendo mucho y que impide que aparescan ventanas nuevas cerrandolas automaticamente, pero para que sirve?... se cierran solas para evitar publicidad no deseada o para que no aparescan como 500 ventanas al abrir un dominio TK :p.

I told my dad that it's sort of like an email program where you could see people's faces. I also told him my profile is set to private (which it is) and i swore not to talk to anyone else who i've never met in the public, eye to eye. Also, how old is you're sister? if she's not much older than you etc.. one year i would just wait until your'e old enough.. but my friends say myspace is very tempting so tell him you'll get good grades and you'll sign on when you need homework help from other people (like how most people just chat instead of calling or going over to the other person's house) and any other excuses will be fine. Just don't lie to your dad or he's going to demand you to delete it.|`|AA11626656	tell him that you will be careful and not put any "personally identifiable imformation" on your page. tell him you can and will set your profile to "private" (so that only people added to your friends list can view your full profile) and that you only want one so you can stay in touch with your friends.    good luck!|`|f02b3bb84a4b417fb349320f9ed725f5aa	well that depends on how old you are  if your under the age of 13 you shouldn't have a myspace sorry  children get abducted all the time because of myspace  since they don't know the signs to look for in case they are talking to an online predator.  even a lot of kids over the age of 13 don't know what to look for even.

f2965e441df60cdef10ee6f9bbc43638aa	Once extracted, look in the folder for a "setup" file with an extension of ".exe" if it is an application. If it is a single file, you need to know the extension of the file (such as .pdf) and download the appropriate viewer (check google)  if you do not have the program to run the file. You can find out the extension of the file by right clicking a file in the "unzipped" folder and choosing "Properties". When Windows asks you which program you want to use, it usually means that you DO NOT have the program to view or run the file.    EXAMPLE: Sometimes I get an attachment of .ppt (Powerpoint) in an email. I do not own Powerpoint, but Microsoft makes a "viewer" which I downloaded at their site.

UAYzLyN4aa	There is a six-pin power connector on the video card. This is needed to supply the current required by modern GPUs.     If your power supply does not already have a matching connector, the power cable they provide lets you use two hard drive connectors to supply it. If you do this it's best if you use drive connectors from two different "legs" (wire runs) from the power supply.|`|MxculX2Daa	I'm guessing you mean the blck connector at the lop right corner of the circuit board.

AA10592411	The first poster was right... you need to use PHP programming language (different than normal HTML). This can be a big task, but you can easily make a site using programs called CMS (content management systems).     These CMS's are all built in solutions to web design for people who cant bother to study PHP, MySQL, etc.    Here's a couple links to get you started!    http://www.joomla.com  http://www.drupal.org  http://www.xoops.com  http://www.wordpress.com (blog oriented)    i think these should help get you started!|`|a923b5df4d6f2d4f0486f95bb8d73788aa	You are probably going to need PHP combined with JAVA, Actionscript for FLASH and some HTML/XML...    Check out sites that you like and in your browser, click:  VIEW / SOURCE from the menu. This will give you some samples and you can copy or save the file under your testing area and make changes before you put into production.    I would suggest Dreamweaver because you can manage your site within that and create all the modules to make the whole thing connect.

You can export your pagemaker file as pdf and open it in Illustrator or Photoshop. Using Illustrator, convert all font to outline, save as a illustrator 7 file and open it up (or import) in CorelDraw. Using Photoshop, open the pdf, select a dpi of 300 or higher (be careful with file size).    You can also Print-To-File in Pagemaker 6.5 using an Adobe PS Driver (I believe free from Adobe.com). This would create a postscript file which you can open in CorelDraw. (Under "Options" you can also print to file as a eps file and open that in CorelDraw) These are generalized instructions so go over the options on screen carefully as you do each step.|`|AA10592411	i dont use coral, but i know photoshop uses the file extension of .psd    i am sure that coral is different. so, as far as I know, you cannot change a .psd into a coral file.

To call any piece of software "bug free" is naive at best, ignorant at worst.     The simple fact is that IE7 - even in its current infant state - is a damned site less buggy and more secure that IE6 EVER was. You also DO NOT want to uninstall IE7, as given the way Internet Explorer (and any bugs inherent to it) is so tightly integrated into Windows as a whole, you can basically think of IE7 as a SYSTEM WIDE security update, even if you do not use it.    Now, to try and explain the situation. If your site was specifically designed for IE6, then chances are that some things WILL break. Why? IE7 sees a couple of MAJOR changes - it is now moving much closer to standards compliancy - something which IE6 definitely was not. Also IE6 was far more intuitive, meaning that many poorly designed/coded sites were still able to function - IE7 moves away from this thinking, finally forcing site developers to fix their sites - which is a good thing really as this will help sites to move toward functioning in ALL browsers, not just a specific one.    Advice - if the website is your own, then you'll need to update your site, as if it is broken now, it will remain so in its current state. If the website is NOT your own, try downloading and installing either Firefox and Opera - if nothing else, this will provide you with another option until such time as the site is updated|`|a238c9f4f3b39e560b25f7251781c2e1aa	Just get firefox.

AA11495466	Hi there,    Whilst Spoolsv.exe CAN be related to your printer, it is also used by spyware & adware so to look like a legitimate file, when it is in fact an infection on your computer.    Here's some detailed information a BAD version of spoolsv.exe:  http://spywarefiles.prevx.com/RRDAJJ6304...

To be the safest possible check for any registry entries linking to this file.  (go to start > run > msconfig and go to the startup tab.)...   If there are any entries that has this file name in there you need to remove them.  Also run your anti-spyware and antivirus programs.  If you don't have either there are free tools you can use.  Before downloading an antivirus program make sure your pc is free from them buy using an online scanner.  Kaspersky.com has one.  After using that download and install avast from avast.com.  After installing it, you will be protected from future viruses and worms.  For antispy the 3 best are Ad-Aware, SpyBot Search and Destroy, and Windows Defender.

First, if you had spent more time studying while you were in school, you wouldnt have to ask questions about myspace. If you spent more time on your homework and less worrying about why so-and-so has more internet friends you might be less concerned with the proxy server bypass that will let you use your schools computer for non-school related activities. When you graduate and get a job so you can afford to buy a computer and pay for internet access I guarantee you myspace will be the least of your concerns. Until said time (if you graduate) quit wasting my tax money by studying myspace more than you study your grammar. Yes, it is my tax money that pays for your education. Chances of you being a prep-school/private school kid and not having one-on-one supervision while you update your myspace is about 4 million to 1. If it really is that important that you have to access it during school hours, why even go to school? Ask mommy and daddy if you can stay home tomorrow and flirt with child predators online. I am sure they wont mind. Lastly, if this standard format response does not apply to your particular myspace question, oh well, I guess I wont have you on my , huh?

5f7e24745b6cd823ea2e888dade20cddaa	Great Question and thank you for participating. It's great that we have the ability to enable and disable the system restore as there are many trojans, viruses and other malicious programs that have the ability hide in particular places so that even if you restore your computer back to a certain date when everything was working well or even completely remove your Windows Program so that they can rewrite themselves into the new changes just as soon as you boot up for the first time. By disabling the system restore, those malicious programs cant follow you if you completely format the hard drive and put in a new, fresh copy of Windows XP or whatever Platform you're using. By enabling the system restore, you'll be able to restore the computer back to a date when everything was working fine. This will end any new or arising issues due to conflicts in any hardware or software that you may have added recently and is now causing problems. You will of course lose any and all programs and changes you've made since the date you choose to restore back to so be sure to think it all out before hitting buttons.

La correspondencia o mapeo entre los mensajes que representan y el cdigo de barras se denomina simbologa.

Los caracteres en las simbologas discretas comienzan y terminan con barras; el espacio entre caracteres es ignorado, en cuanto no es lo suficientemente ancho para parecerse al final del cdigo.   Bidimensional frente a multidimensional: las barras en las simbologas bidimensionales son anchas o estrechas; cuanto sean de anchas, no importa y pueden variar de un carcter al siguiente.

2SSA9e9Naa	Ok, what you want to do is have a checkbox on your form and then put a handler for the checkbox_click event.    In there you would do:  if (checkbox.value = 1) then  ' if the checkbox is 1 then allow plywood      checkPlywood.enable = 1  else      checkPlywood.enable = 0  end    I'm assuming checkPlywood is a checkbox for allowing the use to select the plywood option. You should make it disabled in the form by default and then enable it based on the value of checkbox in your form.    You shouldn't hide it (use the visible property) as that is not good form for a GUI interface.    Hope that helps. Send me an email if you need more information.    P.S.

elhRdmuFaa	The Arduino boards actually use an ATmega Atmel microcontroller.    If you look here in specs, you will see the Microcontroller is an ATmega 168V:  http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product...    I have never used an Arduino board, but I know it comes with an IDE. You program them using their own Processing/Wiring C-like language:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_...    It is a simple and easy to use language from what I hear. We decided to just buy the ATmega Microcontroller by itself, along with a programmer/debugger, and write our firmware from scratch using libraries that come with AVR Studio. AVR Studio is available for free and is used to program/debug Atmel's microcontrollers.     The only other microcontroller I have ever used is ColdFire which is made by Freescale and based off of the Motorola 68K:  http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site...    That demo board comes with their CodeWarrior IDE. It is a bit of a pain in the *** to use, but the Microcontroller is very powerful.    If I were you, I would either get an AVR Development board or an Arduino board to start with.

If you're a gamer though, many games aren't available on Mac, or they are released for PC first, so PC does have that strong point.

Vw5hR0Pyaa	Many times I have stared at my computer thinking "How do I fix my pc because it keeps crashing?"  Unfortunately there is no simple answer! I used to think this problem was related to buying cheap computers but after buying various laptops and desktops at different price ranges there is one common theme, eventually they will all crash at some stage!   Friends will often think I am a pc expert and will call me asking "How do I fix my pc when it keeps crashing?" Well start by asking yourself these questions...  Have your children be on the pc? Kids are great at downloading spyware by mistake! They will also click on numerous pop up pages and will often change your settings!  Another possible reason your pc keeps crashing is that you have overloaded it! If your pc only has 64mb RAM memory and you install graphic, gaming and other software the chances are that your system will not be able to cope with your software! Most PC's now come with at least 512mb RAM so it is worth upgrading if your pc is not at this level.  However the most common reason that your pc keeps crashing is that it has a virus! Many trojan virus can cause your computer to reboot immediately once all programs have been launched, this can drive you mad and it is not fun as you are helpless!  Best option is to install anti virus software and make sure you only visit trusted websites. If all else fails it is time to reformat your hard drive and wipe your pc clean, this can take hours and you will probably need the data recovery disc that you should have got when you bought the pc.  Recommend tool:  http://toptenantispywareviews.com [if you do not have one]|`|rMs4WBfcaa	Take the battery out and reinstall|`|IGJGUfjNaa	Load your computer into SAFE MODE(F8 or F6 during startup). Then check the event viewer to see what is causing the problem. The event viewer is a detailed tree that will allow you to view all files or applications that were accessed within a specified period. The two sections that you should pay special attention are Critical and Error    1.Click Start  2.Click Control Panel  3. Click System and Maintenance  4. Click Administrative Tools  5. Double-Click Event Viewer.  6. Under Windows logs, Click System tab  7. Check for red errors icons and the exclamation icons.    Hope this helps!  http://www.delete-computer-history.com/c...
3ssbf8diaa	The only way I know of (which doesn't mean it is THE ONLY way, lol) would be starting from scratch again. If you need an Office program, check out Open Office, it's open source which means it's free, and it's compatible with Microsoft Office documents as well as it's own format. Hope this helps.|`|HOq5Urn1aa	When the only reason for not reinstalling xp; from scratch is because you will not be able to install MS Office again, then you should install Open Office after you reinstalled xp. Open Office is very much like MS Office but it is completely free  http://www.filehippo.com/download_openof...  Now you have the original xp with activation code. you should start complertely fresh.   Just place your cd in cd-rom, restart computer, starting up from cd and not hard drive. You change that in the bios. Change there first boot sequence to CD-Rom  Then when you are asked will you reboot from cd press any key.  press any key. Istallation of windows starts , Just follow instructions.  At the end you will be akse to activat online. Say yes.  When thet failles you have to do ti by phone within 30 days.

b81H0vlYaa	It could be several different issues causing this.  And thus, several solutions.      Can you boot in safe mode?  What did you do the last time you used it?  Can you boot using the last known good configurations?  Are you getting an error message at all?    Based on the knowledge I have of your situation, and making a few assumptions I would recommend:    You can bring it to a computer shop and they will be able to fix it for you more than likely save your information, but it will probably cost you quite a bit.    If you want a recovery disk, call your manufacturer, they should send it to you.  If you are no longer under warranty, they will probably just charge you for shipping.  If they say they won't send you one, argue with them a bit, then if still no, call back later and talk to a different rep.    You will lose your information doing this, but if you don't know how to fix it, this would be the cheapest way to fix it on your own.|`|KuowAMEZaa	you probably have a virus that is preventing the laptop from starting up.You should contact the manufacturer and request that they send you a new restore disc|`|Y5j2Cr14aa	Sounds like a virus. The first thing I would do is start windows in safe mode and run a virus scan. If that doesn't work you will need to get a copy of windows and reinstall it.

Then find a mirror download to a previous version.|`|lS9J9Nrpaa	Yes, you should be able to. But first you will need to uninstall Messenger 9 or the installation will give you an error message saying that you already have a later version installed.    To uninstall Messenger 9, you need to go into your Control Panel and select 'Add/Remove Programs' if you're using XP, or 'Uninstall a program' if you're using Vista.    When the list of programs displays, be aware that Messenger 9 is now cleverly disguised! It will be under 'Windows Live Essentials' instead of Messenger, like previous versions used to show up as. So you can only really get rid of it by uninstalling Windows Live Essentials. The bad news with this is that this will also uninstall any other Windows Live programs that you downloaded at the same time, ie. Live Mail, Live Writer or Live Photo Gallery. But you can always go back to re-download the other programs if it also removes anything else.    The only other way to remove it involves deleting registry keys, etc. and this is not something you should attempt unless you know exactly what you're doing where computers are concerned.    Restart your PC after uninstalling Messenger 9 (this must be done before downloading the older version), and then download the previous version - Messenger 8. I found a link here for you to download the older version: http://www.brothersoft.com/windows-live-...  However, watch out for messages from Windows as you install it - it will probably tell you that a newer version is available and would you like to download it, so make sure you click 'No'!|`|uGP2fNWbaa	I had the same problem.

DjGEJfaPaa	Defraggler and CCleaner both made by Piriform (both free programs).    CCleaner is a freeware system optimization and privacy tool. It removes unused files from your system - allowing Windows to run faster and freeing up valuable hard disk space. It also cleans traces of your online activities such as your Internet history. CCleaner also fixes your registry. But the best part is that it's fast (normally taking less than a second to run) and contains NO Spyware or Adware.    There's no point to pay for a defrager. The increase in performance will be hardly noticeable. The best thing you can do is to increase your RAM.    Crucial memory advisor: http://www.crucial.com|`|c59aa0746b771ce4755726e1da6772d1aa	The best defragmenters in my opinion are either Raxco PerfectDisk  http://www.perfectdisk.com/products/home...  or my preferred choice O&O Defrag  http://www.oo-software.com/home/en/produ...    although Jk DefragGUI is free and worth checking out.    Best Registry Repair tool - hard to say - I do like Comodo Registry Repair as mentioned above because it points out registry entries that should not be deleted and auto backs up the registry before repairing - not bad for free!  I do like Registry Mechanic because it is reliable and has a good user interface  http://www.pctools.com/registry-mechanic...  and I have also used Amust Registry Cleaner which is good too  http://www.amustsoft.com/registrycleaner...

5zSSGKBpaa	When you say it will not turn on I assume you mean that it will not do ANYTHING: no beeps, no LEDs, no fans, no noise, no lights no nothing.   The computer would not suffer any harm by not being used for 10 years or more. After you dust out the inside carefully so as not to knock anything loose, and then check that the power cable from the wall to the computer is not broken/cracked, and well inserted into the sockets. If there is a small switch on the rear that says I/O that it is set to I and another small switch set to 120 volts (in U.S.).  If all of the above is o.k. I would suspect the power supply. Since the computer is that old it may not be worth the expense to buy a new power supply. It would be possible to copy files from the hard drive if you wanted.  Good luck|`|VwxzEkLnaa	if it wont turn on most cases its the power supply    before u buy a new one try getting some air duster and clean out the dust in the pc, if that doesnt work u will have to buy a new power supply    their not too expensive|`|TRNknCAtaa	?????????do you expect us to have an answer to that?????????did u think of phoning the company or something more intelligent than asking it on ""yahoo questions"""????????no??? i thought so.......

Then again, you said current estimate, so maybe you guessed that already.    Anyway, if haven't tried already, you can try using a Burn Wizard program, those sometimes let you change the speed.  Sometimes changing the file type can help.  Also, if you are just intending to transfer them from one computer to another, you can create an archive or zip the files together.    The main problem is, though, that there is a limit to disc burn speeds, and if you are already at it, you may be SOL.  You can always try just using USB drives, those work well too.

Theres a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)  click on the Troubleshooting link.  Heres my advice from it:    1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.    2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.       * McAfee Stinger  a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.     * SpyBot Search & Destroy  a spyware/adware scanner     * Lavasoft Adaware  for spyware/adware    Note  it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.

Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???

So do not use more than one virus scanner on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one good cleaner, two or three Anti Adware/Spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one) but have at least one of each (for security).     You can only use one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one) but, if you have a router, you can also activate its built-in Firewall as they use different methods.    So just complement by adding what is missing in your computer based on this rule !    Here are my suggestions for free software you can mix and match to your liking according to the rule (I tried all personally):    Anti-Malware/Spyware/Adware scanners suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly and keep it updated.    Virus scanners suggestions:    Don't go for AVG free, it may be free but it has hiccups like the error that made the news late last year on CNET, it advised to remove a key component of Windows causing those who did to lose the use of their Windows system.    Avast is good but takes a lot of resources in the computer.    If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, then the Comodo firewall http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... is the top contender.     Use it in combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.    The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing, whereas the free versions of Kerio and ZoneAlarm do not. Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS ( Host-based Intrusion-Prevention System ) disabled.     If you just want to use Comodo as a Firewall (or don't want a Firewall) then for Virus scanning, use Avira instead http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... It is very light on resources and the detection rate of viruses and rootkits is outstanding.    However, it does not include Email, Malware, Spyware or Adware scanners so complement by choosing from other suggestions on this page    Email scanner suggestions:    Spamdel: http://www.spamdel.com/    OR    Inbox: http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi...

However, it does not include Email, Malware, Spyware or Adware scanners so complement by choosing from other suggestions on this page    Email scanner suggestions:    Spamdel: http://www.spamdel.com/    OR    Inbox: http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi...    Cleaner suggestion:     Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).      And of course, NEVER have them working scans at the same time.    When you scan, only the Firewall should be running alongside (in learn mode if need be).    Use a methodic "one after the other" kind of scan !      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|DjGEJfaPaa	If you want a free anti-virus I recommend in order of popularity, but please choose the right one for you (install only one):    1. AVG Free  a. A simple interface (easier to use than Avast! and Avira)  b. Can detect about 82.82% of viruses  Cons: low virus detection    2. Avast!  a. Real-time protection  b. It has an option to delete a virus once found  c. Can detect about 87.46% of viruses.  Cons: Too many icons and confusing user interface    3. Avira AntiVir  a. It can detect malware better than Avast and AVG  b. It's cute umbrella icon  c.

Another good one is AVG Free Edition. I have tried both and I have to say Avast is better. Along with anti-virus protection you should also have anti-spyware (spyware can steal personal information and online accounts). Good free anti spywares are Spybot Search and Destroy, and Spyware doctor Starter Edition. A combination of these free antiviruses and anti-spyare can effectively protect your computer from infections. Hope this helps.|`|gNIuzscMaa	I dont recommend using freeware AV  I would recommend NOD32.     its cheap.|`|SqzvEbOFaa	I suggest Norton Anti-Virus. It's pretty efficient.

f3bb70dee35ef28e84fcc054691669dbaa	Do you really need to sync, it has more problems then it is worth.  Note: if the music has copy protect on then it may not play on the other computer.    If the computers are network together then you can just share the folder on the upstairs computer and then just work out of that folder, this works only if the upstairs computer is on.    If you like two copies then after it is shared you can copy the folder to the downstairs computer.  This method will make an exact copy of the files but after that the folders are not sync. Except for that one moment in time.    If the computer are not shared then you will need an external hard drive (USB most likely) and copy the folder to that drive then take the drive downstairs and copy to the computer.  Still not sync.    This is the step by step to sync in Vista and my not work in all editions of Vista only if you  REALLY have to.    http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows...    http://www.petri.co.il/windows_vista_syn...

The CPU, Memory and video will consume perhaps 400Watts under load. The drive is light except when spinning up. Both supplies feature Active Power Control (very important) and have fairly decent specs for power conversion efficiency. The OCZ may run a bit quieter.    As for drives, I would purchase ONLY SATA drives from here forward. CD/DVD and hard drives are all available as SATA today. Just a better use of your $$$

Theres a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)  click on the Troubleshooting link.  Heres my advice from it:    1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.    2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.       * McAfee Stinger  a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.     * SpyBot Search & Destroy  a spyware/adware scanner     * Lavasoft Adaware  for spyware/adware    Note  it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!|`|x9S6wLwqaa	antivirus 2010, the new name os antivirus 2009.

If you could list what you got for your comp it'll help out a bit.    GC|`|HHrE2hgBaa	There are many ways you can speed up you computer but the most effective ways are expensive.     Some cleanup tools I have mentioned in here can cause damage to some systems but most systems don't have the problem and my computer hasn't had problems but I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER. YOU ARE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THAT GOES WRONG. You are an adult, you should take responsibility.    Cost: You can buy RAM for your computer. 1GB will speed up your computer if you  have XP. 2GB will speed Vista up but more the merrier with Vista after all. You can also clean out your fans and the whole computer by purchasing a can of compressed air. Spray out the air into the fans and throughout the system and it will speed up your fans so it will cool the CPU and allow it to work faster.    Free: Download CCleaner from Grisoft (Google It). This is a free program and has various tools to speed up your computer. There is a cleanup tool which will cleanup junk that is not needed in your hard-drive and it also has a registry cleaner. Registry is what installed programs store on your computer so your computer reads that the program is there. There is also an uninstall tool. "But Windows does that anyway!" Yeah, you might say that, it's true, but with CCleaner you can run multiple uninstallation so your faster at getting rid of those programs. Also, run Disk Cleanup (from Windows) because sometimes CCleaner doesn't get it all. Running a disk defragment also helps. Also, I recommend you scan your computer with your anti-virus software to scan for spyware which a 7-9 year old computer would probably have that is slowing it down.     Another Free Way: This is a very important text that you must read through carefully or you might damage your system (I don't hold responsibility for it as you would have seen above).    Go to Run or in the Search Box (For Vista) and type in msconfig. Then, go to services. Do various searches on the services in google and untick the ones you don't need or the ones that start anyway. Then, go to start up and run google searches of the start up programs and decide what ones you need or you don't need and untick various start up programs. Leave your anti-virus services and start up programs ON or you will not be protected!    EXTRA INFORMATION: I noticed everyones responses are pretty basic so I'd read over this on first then try theirs. I basically talk about what everyone else has said anyway but mine is all in one.|`|da2WhoWFaa	You can try adding Memory (RAM) to your computer.

NOTE: When the ink level for the print cartridge is low, a message appears on your  computer screen. You can also check the ink levels by using the software installed  with the HP All-in-One.  When you receive a low-ink warning message, make sure you have a replacement print  cartridge available. You should also replace the print cartridges when you see faded text  or if you experience print quality issues related to the print cartridges.  To order print cartridges for the HP All-in-One, go to www.hp.com/buy/supplies. If  prompted, choose your country/region, follow the prompts to select your product, and  then click one of the shopping links on the page.

eZNuuFrJaa	Actually Avira is better than either one!    I highly recommend Avira, working in the tech industry I asked other techs what they used and I got an overwhelming answer to install Avira. It's free and can find viruses others have missed including Norton and AVG. I used to use those a number of years ago before I discovered Avira. In fact Norton not only missed some infections it placed a fake infection on my system which kept telling me I was infected and needed to send in a payment to Norton to get rid of the virus. I instead chose to install the free version of Avira. Imagine my surprise when Avira notified me that I had a Norton Trojan, which I removed and never got the notice again.  I have set up several computer systems and have chosen to install Avira in all of them. Every client has been totally satisfied and I have never had to go back and redo a single one. In fact if a new laptop comes in with bloatware including the Norton trial I quickly delete all of the bloat including the Norton and install the Avira before I ever let it go out. Still every customer is 100% satisfied.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Don't go for AVG free, it may be free but it has hiccups like the error that made the news late last year on CNET, it advised to remove a key component of Windows causing those who did to lose the use of their Windows system.    Avast is better but still takes a lot of resources in the computer.        There are still better free ones out there that are less resources hungry but your question was about AVG and Avast so !|`|uuDloQnCaa	Avast Home Edition:     Avast home edition is free and effective, it protects your PC from infected webpages, scans your downloads and emails for viruses (AVG free does neither) and has built in anti-rootkit and anti-spyware, plus it gives you the option to run a boot scan, there are very few anti-virus's that can do this paid or otherwise and this is free.    Avast works for 60 days from installation after which you will need to register to get your free product key which is valid for a year after which you get another free key, so it always free.    I use Avast along side Comodo firewall both are free, light on memory and have been independently tested and proven to be more effective then Norton or Mcafee.    Avast: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    Comodo: http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/    Why Avast is better then AVG:    On AVGs official website it states that their free anti-virus software does not protect you from poison webpages or scan downloads and emails for viruses (Avast free edition does all 3), I've also tested both AVG and Avast using the EICAR test viruses, AVG allowed all the viruses onto the computer without a single warning Avast either blocked them instantly or shorty after preventing all from running, Avast is much lighter and offers far superior protection.    What AVG does not do: http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-vi...|`|HZubplhvaa	AVG!|`|ojEkgJoqaa	i would say avg|`|ye1tS9a2aa	avast is abit more entertaining when it discovers a virus when downloading, espeacially torrents, it sounds an alarm, avg just prompts with access denied.|`|e29AeC1Qaa	avg is better, i have tried both|`|6fExAsdSaa	I've tried both, I like AVG a bit better.

Everybody else is lacking in the Anti-Virus protection field.    I love it and the cost is amazing for full protection.    I recommend it to everyone who needs some protection out there.|`|BHS3GUhKaa	Hi.  Avast and AVG are both very excellent 'free' anti virus programmes.  Both provide good basic protection.  I personally use AVG because while being active in the background it doesn't slow down the web pages loading.  I find Avast scans web pages while loading on ur system... therefor it somewhat slows down your system.  Which is the best!!  Both good.|`|cwJrCcguaa	I have had AVG for a few years now and find it ok.|`|Cd24MFOtaa	Avast is far superior then AVG since AVG is classed by many as a placebo that does more damage then it does protecting your system from actual threats instead of what it thinks of as threats (and once it get's to work classing your clean programs as viruses the only way to regain access to them is to remove AVG completely since AVG doesn't have an exception filter like avast does).

Go to Start, Run, and type devmgmt.msc (in Vista just type it in the Search box).  This will open Device Manager.    Click the category called Sound, Video, Game Controllers.  Right-click your sound card (it will be the one not called Legacy, or Codecs.  From the popup menu choose "Remove" or "Uninstall".  Click OK, and then reboot your computer.  As it reboots you'll see a message similar to:  "Windows has found new hardware and will install the drivers".  Give it a few minutes to install - you'll probably see a message saying "your new hardware is ready to use".  Hope that fixes it.  Good luck,  Donk
DjGEJfaPaa	DVD-R is more compatible but DVD+R burns more reliably and could be considered superior.    The DVD-R format was developed by Pioneer in the autumn of 1997. It is supported by most DVD players, and is approved by the DVD Forum.    In 2002 a new format was developed called DVD+R (or "plus" R). Created by a coalition called the DVD+RW Alliance, this format uses a number of improved technologies that, while generally unnoticeable to the end user, make a more reliable technology. One example is the ADIP system of tracking and speed control used by DVD+R being less susceptible to interference and error than the LPP system used by DVD-R, which makes the ADIP system more accurate at higher speeds. In addition, DVD+R(W) has a more robust error management system than DVD-R(W), allowing for more accurate burning to media independent of the quality of the media. Additional session linking methods are more accurate with DVD+R(W) versus DVD-R(W), resulting in fewer damaged or unusable discs due to buffer under-run and multi-session disks with fewer PI/PO errors.    However, because the DVD-R format has been in use since 1997, it has had a five-year lead on DVD+R. As such, older or cheaper DVD players (up to 2004 vintage) are more likely to favour the DVD-R standard exclusively, and when creating DVDs for distribution (where the playing unit is unknown or older) the DVD-R format would normally be preferable.|`|68987bf06c72365658d1b5e20bc9b5e8aa	there regestered formats of different companies, and in modern players it dosen,t matter
xFJ2zjIVaa	yes you get the faster speed  better battery life  and such  BUT  its to expensive right now  i would wait for a year or 2  for the price to level out at Hard drive prices now|`|XJGp4AxHaa	I think that it is worth. The drive is going to be faster. The drive since it has no moving parts is going to be a lot quieter and also it is going to use less energy. This means that you charge is going to last a lot longer if you have to get something from your hd. Another point is that this drive is going to be a lot more reliable since it does not use magnets and moving parts. I would get it, but that just my opinion.|`|MHlHcoTsaa	dont buy a mac those are only for noobs who dont know what theyre buying. i.e. you. solid states shouldnt be costing 700 more apple is ripping you off|`|5CnFXw4Zaa	Except for process intensive servers, I see no need for the use of solid state drives.     The technology on the regular hard drives has evolved so much that I wouldn't even bother with solid state with general use. It uses 4watts of energy.|`|Vk2OrbsIaa	i would say no, it is true that your will get longer battery life, but it's alot cheaper to just buy a larger battery for a standard hard drive computer than fork out the extra 700 for a solid state.    as for the faster startup speed, it's definately not worth the extra money. the average computer user would be none the wiser and if you're running your laptop on maximum performance settings (plugged into mains power) then the hard drive would probably not need to spin up because it doesn't turn off in the first place.

A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share.. The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,    If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is a Mac worth buying for OS X?    I say:  NO... for the following reasons...    ADVANTAGES WINDOWS :  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows and most PCs have windows already pre-installed.  1) Some websites require Internet Explorer, to run IE on Mac you really get ies4osx which is the Windows version of IE running really buggy and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows.  2)  Supports devices (printers and other things you hook into the computer).  3) More business software/games  4) Want the dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.  5) Used by businesses.    ADVANTAGES LINUX :  1) FREE (most versions are)  2) Install software by eitjher 1) Synaptic Package Manager,  2) Add/Remove   3) Opening a .deb or .rpm file (depending on distribution)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION which can do any cool effect a Mac can do and many ore....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gkX9HDf...

QUALITY/PROBLEMS  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.    Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts.

k5KuYkkKaa	I ordered one on 12/10/08 and received it on 12/22/08. I live in Florida, and it was shipped from Lavergne, TN. It took almost a week for them to assemble it (they aren't shelf items, they build it when the order is placed) and it was shipped form Dell, on 12/17/08. They will e-mail you and confirm your order, and the order number in the e-mail will let you track it's progress, in my case, it said "In Production" for a week. Then when it ships from the assembly plant, Dell will send another e-mail telling you it has shipped, and give you info on the carrier (delivery method) and tracking number. Then you can check from time to time and find out where your order is. They sometimes change trucks at distribution hubs to make sure the package goes to the right destination.  You can pay for it to ship faster, but I wasn't in a hurry, besides, I'd rather that they took their time so that everything was right when I got it, and it was.|`|AA11704973	check the tracking details in your account that should tell you

UqUz2aASaa	A laptop is a portable version of a computer. The vast majority of laptops  are integrated with sound, video, network and modems directly on the motherboard. Traditional desktops have separate cards that plug into the motherboard to fulfill these duties. Laptops are also designed to be as power efficient as possible unlike most desktops.|`|5mqWIRPuaa	Really?!  Size for main thing.  And portability.|`|gkgY5absaa	Are you wanting to know which you should buy? It depends on what you will use it for and where you want to use it.   A laptop obviously is better if you want to take it places.   I find a laptop works better with my bifocal glasses.   A desktop can have a larger screen and might be better if you will be sharing it with teenagers. (They can't take it away and hide it under their bed.) I have a wireless DSL connection so I can use my laptop by my fireplace or on my patio. If you want to save as much $ as possible, get a desktop.
DjGEJfaPaa	I recommend GIMP, it has many features of Photoshop and costs nothing.    GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is a freely distributed piece of software for such tasks as photo retouching, image composition and image authoring.
AA11997985	Picnik or Lunapic are great all round web based and FREE editing tools. Adobe Photoshop is expensive by they too have a free website version in Photoshop Express.  If you need/want more features downloading GIMP is a great options.  Still free, but you have to download the software. There are also free tools to add text blurbs, to make collages, to put your photo into other images. There are a number of tools that allow you to put the image of a face into other photos for some fun creations.

j3Px4JXfaa	Hi Bianca C,    My names Ron. Im a member of the Windows Outreach Team and thought Id jump in and help you out with your Windows Movie Maker situation.    I recently had the same query with my Windows Movie Maker v6.0 and found that if you actually drag that movie clip into the Audio/Music line, rather than the Video line, you only get the audio. Its one of these good little tidbits that you wouldnt really think of doing!    Once youve done that, go back up and re-input the same file into the Video line. When you do this it will input the audio into the Audio line. From there, just right-click the Audio line and click mute. Once you do that, youre ready to shorten the length of the video clip.    Let me know if that helps out. It should do the trick.    Cheers,  Ron  Windows Outreach Team|`|HgerM8pMaa	Drag the video at the "Audio/Music" timeline, the video will turn to audio only and you could slice the sound by playing the video and pausing at the right time, then press Ctrl+L.|`|KpoR3MiQaa	First you need to split the clip (Little icon underneath preview window) at the point you need to cut the video    At the end of the video clip is a little diamond shape.

dkpIjt5jaa	An affirmation to start: 1) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware, do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned and DO NOT REFORMAT unless it is your last resort.    Now for the main part: Malware is one of the worst kind of viral infection, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners (which are mostly blind to it) and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    So DON'T take chances with it !!!    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, make sure your virus scanner database is updated.    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !

Of course, I don't suggest you use either of those methods. Buy your music legally through a service like iTunes or at an actual record shop.

I also have the local weather forecast for where I live as well as current weather conditions, and a whole bunch of other stuff.     Also, try Google-ing this- Find Chuck Norris. Instead of pressing enter, though, hit the I'm Feeling Lucky button instead. :P     Did you know Google has a built in calculator? Seriously! type 5*5 in the search box and hit enter, and it'll say 25. You can also type in What Time Is It and it'll pop up with what time it is in your area as well as a bunch of other cities around the world. It's pretty cool.     Another thing I enjoy doing when I'm bored is going to Google Maps, type in my address or a friend's address. After it locates your house, click on the yellow dude above the zoom controls and drag the green circle that'll appear to your house. You'll be able to see a street view of your house!

The user name should be left blank and the password will be: admin    once you are in there, you will have to find the section that asks if the routers wireless connection should be on (assuming your going to use wireless, you need it on).  And in another section the router will ask if it should allow wireless administration.  You'll want to turn that on too.  Next head over to your security section, and set that up.  You NEED to use security, even if you don't store passwords and stuff on your computer.  Because you won't want to redo all of this when someone logs into your router, and changes your settings on you.  Nor do you want to share your bandwidth speed with the neighbors WII system.    OK, once thats done, you can disconnect that cable and hook it up between your cable/DSL modem and the router.  This is the best part about linksys, no real set up!  Your going to unplug your router, and the modem, make sure to remove the battery if your modem has one, many cable modems do.  Wait a few minutes, then in order, turn on your modem, wait for it to come all the way on, lights and all.  Then do the same thing with your Router, waiting again for everything to light up.  And lastly start your computer again.    The only set up at this point you may need, is to tell your computer to connect wireless.  Which it should pop up and tell you wireless is available and walk you through it, its easy.    The ONLY difference between this set of instructions, and setting up for a wired connection, is that you will need 2 cables for wired, you will have to leave the computer hooked up, and you will not need to turn on the wireless stuff.    As for which cable, go to circuit city, they are going out of business and it will be cheap, and tell them its for a router, they'll give you the right cable.  I've never seen anyone get the wrong cable, as most places don't stock other ones (like the cross cable for directly wiring two computers together without using a router between them).|`|AQgr5lQYaa	You wouldn't need anything special, just a regular cat-5 ethernet cable will work in any situation.    Not sure why it's saying you absolutely need two though, you should only need the one going from your broadband modem into the router, and then configure the router through the wireless link with it's default settings, but if it's saying you need two in the instructions, may as well follow them.|`|yCFj1gLqaa	you need two if its wired because one from modem two router them one to computer if wired

TXJXcVu0aa	Your firewall may be blocking this, by using restricted settings unfortunately i do not have a step by step for this as im unaware of what firewall software you are using.    Only thing i can suggest at this time is to ensure that you have enables sharing library items from windows media player 11 to your xbox which is done in the options panel in windows media player.     For advice on getting your firewall to allow communication between the two then search in google for your firewall software and put "and xbox 360" at the end    i.e. ZoneAlarm and XBOX 360 or McAfee and xbox 360    EDIT: Ensure you have all the latest windows updates from http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com|`|t4FBtIsTaa	You have to make sure your pc will allow your xbox to access it's files, you do that through the settings in media player.|`|c5970b6d0473b0b3521f3e63e6e094e9aa	You cant do it with XP pro, you need vista or windows XP media center edition.|`|usppmQkVaa	you can use xp pro as i do it myself :)    what you need to do is get wmp11 which you have open it go too library>media sharing and make sure your 360 is on and connect via a router wirelessly or ethernet. your problem is with setting up the wmp and allowing the pc to connect to your 360.    you gotta have all your movies stored on the public videos folder on your harddrive too make them viewable when you connect to your 360.  make sure you have the optional media update installed also    If you need any more help just pm or whatever.

VdHKQMeXaa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.    1. De-Fragmenting  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.   a) Right click of C Disk.   b) Click properties.   c) Click tools tab.   d) Click "Defragment now".   e) Click Defragment.    2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.    3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.   a) Open your Start menu.   b) Click Run   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.   f) Click "OK"    4. Check for Spyware and Adware  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.  Get the best one from: http://toptenantispywareviews.com to scan your pc    5. Clean your Registry  Microsoft Registry Problems = Slow Computer!  Use the tool:  http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere...

If you have less than 2 GIG you need to upgrade. It's true, virus scanners do slow down a computer. They should not slow it down to where it stops. Because the computer does not keep good time signals it is working overtime doing something. I would download spybot search and destroy to check for viruses.

m9pXE9Puaa	download VLC    http://www.videolan.org/vlc/    This will have the codec you need|`|AmKE5JPJaa	nout do what u done before after installing its done|`|71Lq1qpkaa	Ok first thing, after installing your codec, it's often best to reboot the system to allow for the codecs to completely register.    Next, try installing the KLite Media Codec Pack and DivX, These are freee codec packs that support just about every known video encoding out there. You can never have too many codecs.    No doubt you will hear people say GET THE VLC PLAYER. While the VLC Player is a very good player, it too is codec dependent and does NOT contain any major codecs. Obtaining KLITE or DivX will give you the needed codecs and register them so all players and video software may use the footage.  CODEC = Short for Code Decode, codecs are much like an interpreter that translates the video and audio interlace source tracks so that Windows can understand them. Codecs are used during the time of video creation and the same of compatible codec is required for playback on other machines.

gDs87Nchaa	There's not much mention of your problem on the web, but appears to be a firewall issue.    If you have a firewall installed on your PC, or your router has a built in one, you may need to configure it to allow msn messenger to connect.    As I'm unsure if you do have a firewall, and if you do, don't know the make, I can't give much more advice. However you could try temporary disabling your firewall and seeing if MSN will connect. If it does, it's obviously your firewall blocking the connection.    You could also try using the msn connection test thing, that checks for problems and if you have a router, try rebooting it.|`|jIccV2sOaa	Google for it.|`|mzhFrm5Taa	It means that there has been an error and the code for that error is ...

DoKiaNt1aa	%First, you have to find the text file. Remember the path where you put %it, and then simply change the path to where the text file is.  cd c:\examplePath    % Now you can use fopen to open the file  fileID = fopen('yourTextFile.txt');  % the fileID is what Matlab uses to address this file. Fopen also tags the file as 'in use', so you will not be able to delete it at the moment.    % read the content of the file with fseek, which takes three inputs: the fileID, the number of entries to read and the format. You have obtained the fileID already. You want to read everything, so you say fseek should read an infinite amount of characters (or however many there are), and format-wise, you want to convert from characters to integers.  In Matlab, you write this as such:    v = fread(fileID,inf,'char=>int');    % fread returns the transpose of the vector you're supposed to get, so if the teacher is picky, transpose v. Now do not forget to close the file, so that some other program can have its way with it.    fclose(fileID)      [edit]  How do import the text file I wish to decode? Do I save it to some specific folder so when I run Matlab it can find it? or do I use some Matlab function to ask the user of the m-file to point it out?    There are three ways:  1. Within Matlab, change the current directory to the directory where the file is located (for example using the menu bar)  2. Instead of fopen('yourFile.txt'), pass the file name including the path name, i.e. fopen('c:\some\path\yourFile.text')  3. Ask for the file/path name interactively:  [fileName,pathName] = uigetfile;  fopen(fullfile(pathName,fileName));|`|aHN5fDwQaa	You don't need to do that.  If your text file is "XYZ.txt", then all you need to do is say    load 'XYZ.txt';    The program will read the file and assign the name XYZ to a variable containing the contents of the text file.    Note the single quotes on the file name    Edit:  OK, use Sedrin's method then.    The easiest place to put your file is in the work subfolder of Matlab. Matlab will always look to the work folder when searching for files.    Using the path function, you can add other folders to Matlab's path so it will see your files.    Finally, you can always use a full file specification within the function to tell Matlab exactly where to look.
SJM0rzHtaa	The highest AGP card from nVidia still readily available on the market today is the 7200GS.  Pretty crappy.    In the past they had 7600GS available in AGP, which was a low midrange card, but those have disappeared from the retail channel.    If you want an AGP graphics card built on a more current GPU capable of things like DirectX10, HDCP, etc., then you want something like the ATI Radeon HD3650 AGP.

9oeHuGGOaa	You'll want to learn a little bit about CSS.    Before CSS, the HTML code included the format (color, spacing, etc...). But with CSS, there is a separate file (file.css) that includes all of the formatting. Alternatively, the CSS might actually be in the HTML file (again in the head section).    TopPart is a label. If you opened the css file for your html code (a link to the css file will be in the head section at the top of the html page) you can search for the word TopPart and you'll see all of the formatting that is applied to the div labeled TopPart.    JMK  http://realjobdescriptions.com|`|meqrA9ZZaa	TopPart is not a reserved word, setting the class attribute of an element makes it distinguishable in relation to style sheets, so you can use a style sheet to set certain attributes of all elements of the same class at once.
qRx3ynKdaa	Normally people want the same header on every page, at least within a chapter. If they want the header to change, they use fields within the header.    For example, if they want a page number to appear within a header, they can place the mouse pointer where they want the page number to appear and select from the main menu Insert  Fields  Page Number.    I think what you want is what is described here to be added to OpenOffice.org. See http://www.nabble.com/Feature-Request:-D... .    Actually, this can be done now.    I am assuming your names are actually something like dictionary headers. So they can be considered to be the same as chapter headings for very small chapters. Let us use number 5 as the level for these names.    Choose Tools  Outline Numbering....    In the Outline Numbering box that comes up, under the Numbering tab select 5' under Level'' and Heading 5 under. The numbers dont have to match up, but it is somewhat easier to describe if they do.    In the After box you might want to include a space.    Then select all your names so that they are highlighted, Press F11, select the first icon among the icons at the top which is for paragraph styles. If you don't see Heading 5 in the list below, select All Styles at the bottom. Then click on Heading 5. Right click on Heading 5 and modify the attributes of the Heading 5 style to whatever you want them to be, probably a bold font for one thing.    Now you have a number of Level 5 title headings in your document.    Place your mouse pointer in the header where you want the information to appear. Select Insert  Fields  Other... and select the Document Tab''. Select Chapter" under the Type list and select Chapter Name under the Format" list and 5 under the Level list. Mouse-press Insert''.    A field will now appear in the header which contains the text of the first Level 5 heading on each page. In short, each page will contain in the header the first name on the page.    If you want the last name to appear, you have to do the same thing but now place the field into the footer. If you want the last name to appear in the header instead of the first name or as well as the first name, then insert a frame into the footer, and insert the Level 5 heading field into the frame. Then you can drag the fame out of the footer on top of the header. But it will still act as a Level 5 footer frame, and contain the text of the last name on the page.    See headers'' and chapter information in OpenOffice.org Help for a more general description. See also chapter 14 in the Writer Guide'' at http://documentation.openoffice.org/manu...

298f53028838b8c79f30ac0f6b2c75d6aa	One of two primary ways:    The first is to scroll over your Inbox at the top of the page and click on Compose New Message. Type the name of the person you would like to send a message to in the To: field and your message in the Message: field, then click Send. This only works for people that you are already friends with.    Alternatively, you can send someone a message from either their profile or profile badge. From their profile, click on Send {username} a message. A little window will pop up with the person's name already in the To: field, you just have to enter the message and hit send. If you found someone that you would like to message in a search, click on Send Message on the right side of their profile badge. If you don't see that link for the person, you can't send them a message.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	You just go somewhere to that Person's profile on facebook, and you just message.

If that doesnt work try clicking the start button, (start search) run, then type msconfig. Hit ok and continue. Click the start up tab and look for a start up item without a name, or maybe a virus like name. You can also disable any other apps that you dont want to load when your computer starts. This doesnt get rid of the virus but stops it from starting on computer start up (almost as good). ***Also if you dont know much about computers dont mess with to much stuff in msconfig for you can mess up your computer.

jU8CX1veaa	No because each key is validated to a single computer so when you try to use it on a different computer it would not work    When you install the software after 60d you have to validate the software, program reads the hardware state of the current PC and generates a code which is sent to Microsoft. The hardware state is unique to that PC. A validation code it transmitted to the software or by telephone if you phone microsoft (you have to give them a number sequence that is generated by the software first) so they know whether the software has been installed on a PC with a particular hardware profile.    There are cracked keys available but they are obviously illegal|`|KNYF1hnhaa	When you use a key to get the full version of office, they key that is used is registered with Microsoft so that you can get updates.  Using a hacked or already used key on a product that was developed in the USA by an American company is illegal regardless of the country you are in.      Unless you purchase the actual key, you could get in trouble for piracy and hacking no matter what country you are in.  If you want to risk it, go for it.|`|SVCtlCzBaa	If the other person is using it probably not.  If its a cracked key, then yes, you will be able to.|`|g62ATenqaa	If the key has been used by another individual you will be unable to activate it on your computer and why should you. If more people went out and bought the products instead of thinking its their right to get things for free, companies like Microsoft wouldnt lose so much money from pirated versions and be able to reduce prices.    You say its not illegal in your country - what world are you living in! It's Microsofts rights we are talking about here and what you want to do is totally illegal in the computer world.|`|rLd29is7aa	If you have a valid key, then yes.  it will work and stay.    .*love*.|`|GvEBe5ULaa	If you get a working key, you could have office on your computer for an unlimited amount of time.

HOq5Urn1aa	There is no defination of what a crack is.  No and can not be used on multple computers many times.  A crack you can use to illegally bypass official regstration of a program and with the right crack you can use the software as fully registered.  It is very illegal, but that should be clear to you, reading this anwer.  Also is it not only illegal, but also very risky, Most cracks, keygen etc are infected with a virus|`|FZzIZ5GWaa	If you're talking about software then it's basically a mathematically calculated number block used to 'unlock' games or applications.    a "crack" refers to a program designed to bypass security on applications.

VMVW3E7Aaa	Lets say photo A is your background, photo B is your subject. Open both photos.  Work on photo B - erase all the background (make sure it is on a proper layer so you can have transparency) until you only have your subject left.  Now click on the layer thumbnail of photo B and drag that on top of the actual image of Photo A.    Now B is a layer on top of A.    With layer B active, use the transform tool to size it properly and the move tool to put it in position. Consider using a drop shadow to make it more realistic (if that applies in your case).    P.S. it would always help to link to examples, makes answering so much easier!|`|eoUHF4x2aa	I think I understand what youre trying to do   First I assume youve dragged the picture you want onto your background.  You can move the picture to the position you want as well as resize it using the scale option (Edit>Transform>Scale). All those options under scale are fun too.  To delete the background from your picture over your main background Id usually use the Pen tool (P) over the Lasso, to neatly cut the picture the way you want it and deleting the rest or copy via layer encase you want to keep the original picture.  If you want to stick the picture to your background when youre done hit Ctrl+E.
qmWEGycFaa	Yes. For basic computing, a single core is sufficient.|`|mQ7ZAFd6aa	A single core is fine for that    you only need a dual or more if you play games or like to do more than one thing alot.|`|7Z2JWAaoaa	A single core processor is not very common anymore as computing has made advancements, but if you can find one that is cheap then yes it will be fine for those things, but if a dual core processor is slightly more expensive it may be cost effective in the long run to buy that.     Hope that helps|`|ajvSggX1aa	yes, most likely as long as it is a decent GHZ rating.    As long as there isnt any gaming or anything you will be fine.

If you plan to use microsoft vista, use at least 1gb of ram (memory) otherwise with Windows Xp, 512mb will give decent performance.

CTGHeMwPaa	When you saw the part about "nameservers", you were in the right place.    A nameserver converts a name like www.rearviewminor.com into an IP address that the computer can actually connect to.         In the Nameserver/DNS settings there are two kinds of records that you need to be concerned about.      The first kind is an A record.    An A record associates a name like www.rearviewmirror.com into an IP address.    You would want to set the IP address to that of your boss's server.     You can get the IP address from him.    the second kind is a CNAME record.   You can set a name to be the alias for the name for your boss's host machine.   This is another possibility for you.     Here's some sites on GoDaddy to explain this better:  http://help.godaddy.com/topic/163  http://help.godaddy.com/topic/163/articl...  http://help.godaddy.com/topic/163/articl...  http://help.godaddy.com/topic/163/articl...

6W4ZWOetaa	A layout for what?  Myspace, a regular web page?      Myspace layouts you can't really do from scratch; Myspace is created in such a way that a lot of their stuff is the way it is, and you can style it, but you can't just create one from a blank page.    If it's a regular web page you're wanting to make:    1) You need a domain somewhere.  You can find one at godaddy.com, 1and1.com, aplus.net, or somewhere similar.  People will tell you freewebs, but no if you want to make a site COMPLETELY from scratch you need an actual domain that doesn't have a WYSIWYG editor (what you see is what you get).  Domain names cost $10-$15 a year if you want something good.    2) You need a host.  Places like GoDaddy host and do domain registration.  The company I work for hosts websites as well.  Hosting costs between $3 and $150 a month (or more in some places!) depending on what kind of site you want.  There are places that say they host for free, but they always have some sort of catch or stipulation.  If you want a real website from scratch, don't fall for any of that.    3) You'll need an FTP client.  A good free one that I recommend is FileZilla.    http://filezilla-project.org/    There are even tutorials to help you with FTP out there.  You might want to get a text editor, but you can use notepad on your computer.  I use Komodo and notepad++ myself.        4) You will need to know at the very least HTML.  A great tutorial that I recommend is the one from W3schools.    http://www.w3schools.com/    Start with the HTML tutorial.  They even have a "try it here for free" editor that you can play with!  It's really cool!      Once you know HTML well enough you can get into learning CSS (Cascading style sheets), Javascript, PHP, etc etc to make your site more dynamic.      lastly:  GOOD FOR YOU for wanting to learn how to make websites from scratch.  It's ultimately better in the long run than using editors, website software like Dreamweaver, etc.  It will always work in all browsers, it's much more flexible, and hey, you'll look really smart :)    Hope this helps!

4yo0xxp0aa	When installing windows 7, it practically is REQUIRED for you to perform a clean install, if you want your system to work correctly.    Once you have booted into Windows 7, go to Start >> and search "MSCONFIG". when you see the msconfig icon pull up, click on it. This will open the System Configuration Utility.    In msconfig, go to the BOOT tab. here will show you all of the operating system choices registered in the boot.ini file. You should see vista, and 7.      Click on the vista choice once. then click the DELETE button. Then click OK. A message will pop up saying to restart. Check the box that says "Dont show this message again". Then click Restart Now.    This should clear it out of the system for good. If it doesn't then you may have other issues possibly caused by an improper installation.    One good thing to note here (especially with Beta operating systems) is to make sure that you perform a CLEAN install with a blank hard drive and a bootable DVD. This will always give the best possible results for the operating system that is being installed - whether it be a beta OR a public release.    Good Luck. Hope this helps.

Now for the main part: Malware is one of the worst kind of viral infection, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners (which are mostly blind to it) and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    So DON'T take chances with it !!!    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.

zorYTX59aa	If your YouTube is getting bombarded with "JavaScript" and   "Flash Player" messages, and people are telling you to get  or install something, DON'T TOUCH A THING.    You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java",   "Flash" or various web browsers -- and definitely stay away  from software that salespeople (disguised as answerers on  Yahoo) are trying to "sucker" you into buying.    None of those things will help you, because your computer   and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right?   The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add,   change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.    I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a   lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why   in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good   for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).    Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of  their own servers every single day without warning anybody,   in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions,   it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or   "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.    If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing   you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages,   it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet   files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.    "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get   permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay   there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer   much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of   them. The solution to that is to clear your "cache" of all the   "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" and "history". Then reboot.    Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it;   do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts   my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever.   (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)    Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales   pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are   really disguised salespeople and peddlers. Their "answers"   have nothing to do with your problem, and their wares may  worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of selfish answer   is that? [my paraphrase] "Although you cannot even watch   or access videos, buy our downloader."    Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|k4dQsHKkaa	javascript is usually turned on by default...so, it might be your flash player is outdated..    you can try a different browser...    these will help you...    1.

OR..    2. It could be due to slow connection or high traffic.  Try watching it during off peak hours, the video will be smoother.

QEEweJUaaa	(This may help)  .  Using Nero 6.x, under the Recorder menu, chose Burn Image and select the iso file that you downloaded.     You also need to go into your BIOS and change the boot options so that it will boot from CD-Rom before harddisk.     Memtest will cycle continuously by default until you press the Esc key to end it. The available commands are listed at the bottom of your screen.     You should let it run for at least 2 complete cycles (last test number is eight). Time to run a complete cycle depends on the speed of your CPU (for my 3GHz P4, it takes about 15mins to do a cycle).

I have Avira on one PC and Avast on another, and out of the two I slightly prefer Avast, although I have read that Avira has a higher detection rate.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Virus scanners suggestions:    If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, then the Comodo firewall http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... is the top contender. Use it in combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.    The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing, whereas the free versions of Kerio and ZoneAlarm do not. Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS ( Host-based Intrusion-Prevention System ) disabled.     If you just want to use Comodo as a Firewall (or don't want a Firewall) then for Virus scanning, use Avira instead http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... It is very light on resources and the detection rate of viruses and rootkits is outstanding.    However, it does not include Email, Malware, Spyware or Adware scanners so complement by choosing from other suggestions on this page      Here are my suggestions for free software you can mix and match to your liking according to the rule (I tried all personally):    Anti-Malware/Spyware/Adware scanners suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.

Cleaner suggestion:     Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).

The rule of thumbs for security is to have a multi-layered protection approach !    So do not use more than one virus scanner on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one good cleaner, two or three Anti Adware/Spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one) but have at least one of each (for security).     You can only use one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one) but, if you have a router, you can also activate its built-in Firewall as they use different methods.      And of course, NEVER have them working scans at the same time.    When you scan, only the Firewall should be running alongside (in learn mode if need be).    Use a methodic "one after the other" kind of scan !

Option 2:  Go Virtual  Why give over an entire PC to a single OS when most are powerful enough to run two OSes side-by-side. To do this download and install Microsofts free Virtual PC 2007. Once youve installed it run the application and it will guide you through creating a new virtual machine.    Most of the default settings will work for you but when asked for the operating system, pick Windows Vista, and when asked about virtual hard disk options, create a new virtual hard disk. Then, from the Virtual PC Console select the virtual machine you created and click on Start. As soon as the virtual machine fires up, click on CD from the menu and choose Capture ISO Image  and select the Windows 7 .ISO and click Open. Now click on Action and then Reset to kick off the Windows 7 install process.

For 'hasNext' and 'next' model in Java, it is assuming you call once nextXXX method after calling once hasNextXXX method. Also, I think your code is locating maximum value in scanner, so your while loop should look like:    while (s.hasNextDouble())  {      double dTmp = s.nextDouble();      if (dTmp > result) result = dTmp;  }    return result;|`|AA11124184	you call s.nextDouble() too many times.

I'm a network security consultant and I can assure you that any and all wireless traffic that's unprotected or protected with WEP can be read quite easily!    Basically, a program like airsnare or kismet will run and capture wireless packets to a file that's being read by protocol analyser like wireshark. That's it!

It's unlikely though as most people/companies that buy those routers are smart enough to secure them.|`|11d83268c3a193378b87223d27e8542daa	In short, no. Not unless you were hacked somehow. All the unsecure network does is open up the internet connection to users without a password.    Just to add - The chances are very slim, as the comment below suggests. It is very simple however to set up a secure network. Your router should have an IP address you can go to using IE or whatever browser you use. Once logged on you can set up a secure WEP passkey.    If you do this I advise setting it up using a wired connection (ie; connect an ethernet cable between the PC and the router) first, so that you do not lose a connection during setup!    Oh right, well obviously the danger is always there I suppose, I wouldnt get too caught up in the hype of hackers and what not, it's not nearly as dangerous as you may be led to believe!

Usually when you buy a dvd rw drive, it comes with a software like Roxio.  Roxio is really good for all kinds of media creation ... creates mp3s even.    Most dvds are copyright protected and you need another program to decrypt the dvd.  You can get some free programs on the internet and one of them is called DVD43.  It is small program and works for most dvds.      With DVD43 it decrypts the DVD as it reads it and it can be copied immediately.  If you have a dvd/cd drive, play the dvd there, and you can use your external dvd writer to copy it straight .. that is, from one drive to the next ... no need to save on your hard drive.    Another dvd decrypter that is free is called DVD Decrypter.  This one decrypts files individually and after that the dvd is ready for copying.    Hope this helps.

Just check the specs online if you are building a PC and it will tell you right there whether it supports ATI or Nvidia.    EDIT - I guess you could use a Nvidia GPU on an ATI board, I wouldn't suggest it, but that's your choice. The only thing I care about is the fact that you won't be able to use SLI if your board is ATI and you decided not to go the crossfire route.|`|MHlHcoTsaa	ur such a noob

Et64pO37aa	Well, it all depends. You must factor in the distance from the main box, the quality of the line, the quality of the overall connection, etc. But 3Mbps = 384Kb/sec. Down. But when you factor in distance, quality, etc., it will probably be around 285-310Kb/sec. But it also depends on the server/host you download from or upload to.    I have a 1.5Mbps DSL connection through our local phone provider. 1.5Mbps = 192Kb/sec. After all the factors, I can download from a major server like Microsoft.com anywhere from 135Kb/sec. to ~175Kb/sec.    The results from SpeakEasy.net's speed test will vary as well. It depends on which server you use. How close the server is, the density of the traffic on that server when you test, etc.    I'm in the middle part of TN, and the Atlanta, GA server yields the best results for me:    1,318Kbps Down = 164.75Kb/sec.  418Kbps Up = 52.25Kb/sec.|`|aXC7elejaa	I used to have the 3MBps service. It use to take me like 12-15 hours to download a a movie because DSL is very limited. Now with Road Runner, it takes me like 3-4 hours.

I have 5MBps and this is my speeds based on Speakeasy:    Last Result:  Download Speed: 29884 kbps (3735.5 KB/sec transfer rate)  Upload Speed: 976 kbps (122 KB/sec transfer rate)|`|E5mFWOqqaa	3mbps would mean that they would get a transfer rate of about 3000kbps, although that number would vary.    Your download rate would be about 375KB/s, max.     It doesn't take a Verizon customer to tell you the transfer rates.

I offer this letter as a contribution to that struggle and debate in hopes of helping to illustrate the virtues that Apple lackscourage, truthfulness, courtesy, honesty, diligence, chivalry, loyalty, and industry. You see, I surely believe that Apple's commentaries have led to date rape, domestic violence, pornography, and other social ills. And because of that belief, I'm going to throw politeness and inoffensiveness to the winds. In this letter, I'm going to be as rude and crude as I know how, to reinforce the point that Apple is like a magician who produces a dove in one hand while the other hand is busy trying to manipulate public understanding of expansionism. Even Apple's representatives couldn't deal with the full impact of Apple's memoirs. That's why they created "Apple-ism," which is just an offensive excuse to make our country spiritually blind.    Apple is filled with unrighteousness, wickedness, and maliciousness. How does Apple deal with this fascinating piece of information? It completely ignores it. Apple will make people weak and dependent by the next full moonnot necessarily by direct action, but by convincing its factotums to respond to this letter with hyperbolic and uncorroborated accusations and assaults on free speech.    It's not that I have anything against poltroons in general. It's just that Apple's codices can be subtle. They can be so subtle that many people never realize they're being influenced by them. That's why we must proactively notify humanity that Apple's stories about boosterism are particularly ridden with errors and distortions, even leaving aside the concept's initial implausibility.    Is there a chance that Apple isn't narcissism-oriented, impulsive, and purblind? From what I've seen, I doubt it. As everyone who has access to reliable information knows, now that I've been exposed to Apple's bruta fulmina I must admit that I don't completely understand them. Perhaps I need to get out more. Or perhaps society must soon decide either to address the real issues faced by mankind or else to let Apple create some fickle, pseudo-psychological profile of me to discredit my opinions. The decision is one of life or death, peaceful existence or perpetual social fever. I can hope only that those in charge realize that Apple yields to the mammalian desire to assert individuality by attracting attention. Unfortunately, for Apple, "attract attention" usually implies "eat our nation to its bones".    The space remaining in this letter will not suffice even to enumerate the ways in which Apple has tried to overthrow the government and eliminate the money system. The important point here is not that Apple's adherents form a naive organization devoted to harassment and barratry. The vital matter is that Apple accuses me of being narrow-minded. Does it suspect I'm narrow-minded because I refuse to accept its claim that things have never been better? If so, then I guess I'm as narrow-minded as I could possibly be.    Apple's half-measures have caused widespread social alienation and from this alienation a thousand social pathologies have sprung. Apple's "I'm right and you're wrong" attitude is revolting because it leaves no room for compromise. To tell you the truth, Apple's admirers are quick to point out that because Apple is hated, persecuted, and repeatedly laughed at, it is the real victim here. The truth is that, if anything, Apple is a victim of its own successa success that enables Apple to make people suspicious of those who speak the truth. One thing to keep in mind is that Apple's cronies argue that the ancient Egyptians used psychic powers to build the pyramids. These are the same vindictive brutal-types who sweep its peccadillos under the rug. This is no coincidence; Apple's co-conspirators have been staggering around like punch-drunk fighters hit too many timesstunned, confused, betrayed, and trying desperately to rationalize Apple's mean-spirited, irritable press releases. It is not a pretty sight.    I am hurt, furious, and embarrassed. Why am I hurt? Because "Apple" has now become part of my vocabulary. Whenever I see someone take us all on a totally reckless ride into the unknown, I tell him or her to stop "Apple-ing". Why am I furious? Because Apple likes to quote all of the saccharine, sticky moralisms about "human rights" and the evils of interdenominationalism. But as soon as we stop paying attention, it invariably instructs its vicegerents to rip off everyone and his brother. Then, when someone notices, the pattern repeats from the beginning. Though this game may seem perverse beyond belief to any sane individual it makes perfect sense in light of Apple's crass subliminal psywar campaigns. And why am I embarrassed? Because wherever you look, you'll see Apple enforcing intolerance in the name of tolerance. You'll see it suppressi
nV3CTelWaa	Self Discipline: The Key to Get Rid of Internet Addiction Getting rid of Internet addiction is quite simple but very hard to do. In a nutshell, it is all about discipline, limiting the use of the Internet so that it will allow other things to be done. Here is a simple way to reduce the hours you spend online:   Start by listing the things you do online. Organize them according to importance. Probably the one at the top of your list is not that important but is the major cause of your addiction.   Now list the benefits you will get if you reduce the time you are on the Internet. These could be increasing productivity, better relationship with family and friends, or becoming healthier.   Set the limits. If you have household chores, tasks at work, or anything that you need to do, do them first, then allot time to spend online each day. Don't forget to allot enough time to sleep as well.   Strictly follow the schedule. Make a punishment if you don't follow it. It can be as severe as having your Internet connection at home cut off or not logging on the Internet for a day. The use of the Internet is not really evil, but it can turn that way if its use is not kept in check. It surely is difficult to quit spending a lot of time on the Internet, that is why you must have other things to do like going out with friends, or engaging in a new sport.

LkY8Kpljaa	The jumping isn't usually related to the megapixels.  pixels increase the resolution (more tiny squares per inch) and how clear something looks, more pixels, less jaggy (old videogames like atari vs new systems).    The jumping that I think you are talking about is caused by the video stopping and starting and looking more like a bunch of pictures at times then a movie.  There is no way I know of to prevent the jumping because it is caused by the stop-and-go traffic of the internet.    you can save a video and then email it to someone, but live video will always look choppy.  Another reason is that to make it appear live, it needs to drop frames now and then to catch up with the actual view.  If it didn't, it would lag way behind.    so, get as many megapixels as you want but realize that megapixels are really only important when you want to take a picture in for prints.|`|AA11161317	as large as your webcam can, in a good result, or depends of how good your webcam is.

The results can be sold for profit, but original authors retain copyright and you must provide the source to your modifications.     Because it comes with source code to the kernel, it is quite portable. Linux runs on more CPUs and platforms than any other computer operating system. The recent direction of the software and hardware industry is to push consumers to purchase faster computers with more system memory and hard drive storage. Linux systems are not affected by those industries orientation because of it capacity to run on any kind of computers, even aging x486-based computers with limited amounts of RAM.     Linux is a true multi-tasking operating system similar to its brother UNIX. It uses sophisticated, state-of-the-art memory management to control all system processes. That means that if a program crashes you can kill it and continue working with confidence.     Another benefit is that Linux is practically immunized against all kinds of viruses that we find in other operating systems. To date we have found only two viruses that were effective on Linux sLinux does not believe in slavery: Free software stands for freedom and liberty. Like, free, as in freedom. It does not have the restrictions imposed by the licenses from software from commercial and greedy businessmen. It gives one and all, an equal and fair opportiunity. No invisible handcuffs, fetters, and chains, to straitjacket you, and make you a helpless slave.      Linux is NOT fliMSy or cluMSy, and does NOT have any pathetic record of security like this other OS. Only huts are made of dung and clay. Forts are built with stone and concrete.       Linux makes economic sense : Although the free in Free Software like Linux, implies "liberty" and not "gratis", the "Total cost of ownership" of Linux is much lesser than this other OS ! This aspect, makes Linux particularly attractive for academic institutions and intellectuals (who are not always part of the economically pampered tribe). Products which these people make, are naturally superior to those made by greedy, short-sighted swindlers.       Linux is robust and secure : unlike this other so-called OS, which has to depend on Linux for survival !

The one thing that you should be aware of is that you do not need to have anti-virus software as Linux does not get in fected.

It has a $50 big brother, Linspire, which has been installed on computers sold by walmart and dell. at the time is was called Lindows, but was sued by microsoft and had to change their name. With the fifty bucks you get tech support. Freespire and Linspire have all the codecs installed so your audio and video files will work on a clean install.    http://www.ubuntu.com/ for the favorite of most of the linux geeks...    http://www.freespire.org/ for freespire, free version of linspire    http://www.linspire.com/ for linspire, $50 commercial version|`|znlj1PDBaa	Linux is free!

K0Qk6Qmyaa	No es problema de tu cuenta de MSN, sino de tu equipo que ha sido infectado.    Tienes varias opciones:    a) Instala un buen antivirus como Panda o Norton. Olvdate de software gratuito, no sirve de nada y da ms problemas.    b) Salva en un DVD, pendrive o CD los archivos que quieras mantener y formatea tu disco duro.    c) Convive con el virus.    La primera es la mejor opcin. Hoy por hoy, y ms an con Windows, es esencial disponer de un buen antivirus.    Si adems de ese virus tienes otros problemas 'raros', lo has hecho hace mucho tiempo, o no lo has hecho nunca, formatea tu disco duro.    Si no te importa, convive con l. Nada recomendable.|`|BMgDzeWYaa	Amigo es muy sencillo, estos son tipos de infecciones propagadas por msn.  Para solucionar esto le recomendaria bajar algun antivirus.

esPsOf2qaa	Depends on how big your crash was and what had to be done to fix it.     If you didn't have to do a complete wipe of your hard drive, then your music files should still be on your hard drive. Just go to   File >  Add Folder to Library    and select the drive and/or folder that your music was stored on. It will search that drive/folder for any music files still hanging around.    If you had to reformat the hard drive, it will be harder. You can go to Store > Check for Purchases   for your iTunes purchases, but all your other music will need to be reloaded from its original location.

AA12303431	You need an image editor that has either a grid or a 'snap to grid' function. That way you make a new document thats A4, add the grid, then keep dragging and dropping copies of the tile onto the new image, and the grid shows you where to place them.  I think that PaintdotNet has a grid, and The Gimp does but it doesn't support printing, so you'll need to print from the folder the file sits in. (XP has a 'print this file' option in the task pane on the left of the folder, click the file to highlight it and the option will appear on the left.    Both The Gimp and PaintdotNet are freeware.  http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/paint.net/  -Paint.net Paint with layers.  http://www.gimp.org - Like Photoshop 7

75474c6a87f579ca9691df16561e80c1aa	For the most affordable, have a look here     http://computers.search.ebay.com/laptop_...    Hundreds of laptops sell every day for less than a quarter of the price in stores, so whatever you see in computer shops, have a look at the above link before buying as you will get them muc cheaper.    Acer is a fantastic model, I personally have an Acer Aspire 3050 and it is the most wonderful thing I have ever had!!! If running Windows XP then 256 is actually fine for the RAM, I have 14 windows open on here right now with that amount of RAM and never once has it said it is low on the virtual memory. Vista eats RAM and therefore 1GB would be the minimum for that - there are many glitches and problems with Vista right now (I've used it and hate it) so I would recommend going for XP and the upgrading in the future when they bring out the next version Service Pack of Vista.    Depending on your use of the laptop 80-160GB should be enough hard drive space, you can always get external USB drives again on eBay for nest to nothing and it is far cheaper than buying a laptop with a huge hard drive from the start. A CD rewriter and DVD rewriter are best to have so that you can back up large amounts of data quickly.|`|AA10906058	it depends on what you do with your laptop, and what type of computing power you need.    Assuming a PC version, Vista I think requires at least 1 MB of ram, but you might be better off with 2 MB  if you are working with big files, or lots of pictures/music, you might want a larger hard drive.  If you play graphic intensive games, you might want an upgraded graphics card.  I went with a big screen (17 inch) HP, I like it, but it is not as portable due to the size.|`|THhD48Pxaa	Dell are probably your best bet.

Best advice would be to check out cnet.net  there give you reviews on the best laptops in your price range, and catorgized by what you would use it for.

Si no aparece ningun adaptador, pues hay dos causas. Primera es que el sistema operativo no ha "sentido" al adaptador integrado en su placa base (muy raro, ademas para un asus) y eso le pasa a vecez a los windows 98. Segunda puede ser una causa de mala configuracion en la BIOS, es muy probable q alli esta elejida la opcion de INICIAR con una video AGP quer UD. (todavia) no la metido. Por eso el windows no la vea (creo yo....) Al final se queda una configuracion muy baja, en 4 o 8 bits, muy lenta y con un monitor predeterminado. Que le recomiendo, que identifique y busque en google su placa asus y sus controladores (por tipo, modelo, seria....etc.) Despues pregunte otra vez aqui mismo, pero con mas detalles (version de windows, tipo y modelo de la placa base) para q tenga la gente ideas sobre el aspecto concreto.

bbdb6a92d21fe4a0e544ced198d2a05faa	I agree with Snowmaniac except if you don't have svideo on your tv, you can always get a svideo to RCA cable.  Pretty much all you need is the yellow cable for video. The red and white is for stereo sound. But if you want to use the speakers on the TV then you will need a 1/8 stereo jack to RCA cable.  So to sum it all up, to connect your laptop to your TV, you need 2 cables.  S-Video to RCA cable (yellow)  1/8 stereo jack to RCA cable (red and white)    Make sure you have S-Video on your laptop too. Also once you have this set up, you need to configure your video card to go to the TV.  Usually there is a setting to force TV detection, depending on your Graphics Card.  Also, when switch your TV, you go to Video instead of going to channel 3 or 4.    Good luck.|`|58becf004bd36eb415740a85b3bbb41eaa	Go to radio shack and take your laptop with you.|`|AA11725285	red , yellow and white cable is Rca... but most computers do not have RCA output.   most have S-video ---make sure your TV has S-video in and you should be set|`|AA10581662	RCA Cable

ZkELw9wzaa	Your school filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually. The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.    There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.    Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network. Read more on the dangers of proxy's below.|`|uAEZeyAAaa	Best Advice  create your own anonymous proxy server using the instructions from this site  http://www.ghacks.net/2006/04/07/setting...|`|FgsRcuDpaa	Let's initially establish: Proxies are not a requirement.  There is nothing that important that you have to bypass the internet filter that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences; that you really don't want to. It's honestly not worth the repercussions involved.  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time.  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible.

ksWyiJJ9aa	The way to make them is simple but can be quite long    You use an image creator like paint or even photoshop  Here you have to make separate images for the sequence you want    so example you want a little face that smiles and then goes sad    You have to draw this in transition, meaning you draw separate images for each stage of the face change.  1 big grin  2not so big grin  3 normal flat mouth  4slightly sad face  5very sad face    Get it?    Now when you finish the images you want you put them in a gif creator such as Easy Gif Animator and set how long you want to show each image for    Here is a tutorial for making a gif (emoticon)  http://www.htmlgoodies.com/tutorials/web...    you follow the same steps to create anything you want      hope that helps! :D

pUzJiMUcaa	My first semester after core classes, I took a line up similar...mine was .NET Programming, Database Management with SQL, and Intro to WebDev, along with an elective.    It kicked my butt, that much I'll tell you. I'd been exposed to programming before, though. I'd written programs in BASIC, VBA, and wrote some basic web apps in PHP, using SQL. Even with all of that, it was an exhausting semester.    All that said, it depends on how well you learn. I still managed to get an A in every course, but it was a lot of work. If you are also working more than 20 hours or so a week, I'd cut back on either working or throw an easy class in there (I took photoshop in my next hard semester...it was a great stress reliever of a class).|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	If you've already taken computer programming, VB and Javascript can be taken together.

DMS is the basics of databases - not much programming, but you should understand the basics of programming (and probably accounting) first.

j3Px4JXfaa	Hi rrrachie,    My names Ron. Im a part of the Windows Outreach Team. I thought Id just throw in my two cents here.    Judging by what you said, you might want to first try uninstalling and reinstalling Windows Live Messenger. Try that, then re-try syncing your iTunes with your Windows Live Messenger.     If that doesnt work, then Id try the following:    Click on START > Click on CONTROL PANEL > Click on CLASSIC VIEW > Click on DEFAULT PROGRAMS > Click on SET DEFAULT PROGRAMS. From there you can select iTunes from the menu on the left and click the Set this program as default on the right-hand side. This should, in most cases work around any problems with syncing the two.    Hope this helps.    Cheers,  Ron  Windows Outreach Team|`|Hc82C7Lyaa	Your first problem is your horrible taste in software    second, trust me, no-one cares what your listening too|`|vYTlYQfRaa	Windows Live Messenger 2009 (and previous versions) will display the song youre listening to in whatever program you have set as your Default Audio Player in Default Programs under Windows Control Panel.   So go there and make sure you have iTunes selected to play all files it can.      Good luck.|`|AWx6GAB3aa	You can get the NowWatching, plugin. You should google it!
4a3e0ab4ecb4787c195a06580c2aa131aa	no, that's impossible. Store bought disks are finalized so nothing can be written to them.    Now and then you hear of commercial software being distributed (I mean proper distributions not the pirate copies which often contain viruses) with a virus but these cases are very, very rare.|`|lLiQzJjBaa	It is *possible* but highly unlikely as the virus would have to be explicitly programmed to do so and it would only work if the disk in question was a blank DvD.|`|EmgiGg17aa	No.  The disc is a hardcopy.   What you installed on your computer is a copy of the information that was on the disc.    At that point the stuff in your computer is the stuff that can be modified.|`|aZ3UBG5eaa	No, no virus that I know of can do that. (I have even transferred files from an infected PC to another HDD and the virus didn't come along for the ride)|`|2KfQYXaiaa	No, you can not just add a virus or any files to a CD.|`|6LW8h4rTaa	Recordable CD's have a layer of ink that can be burnt.  Mass produced CD's are etched before assembly, and don't have the ink to burn.    Software from smaller companies might be on recordable media, but not on re-recordable media (it's cheaper, more reliable, and lasts longer).   A Trojan might be able to add files to the disk, but it couldn't CHANGE any of the files already there. Since the program wouldn't access these new files, you would have to open the CD folder and choose to run the infected file. The odds of a user doing this on a uninfected computer after the CD was infected on the first one is so slim that most Trojan writers wouldn't waste the time creating a virus that would be useful less than .01% of the time.|`|BZdUHUbPaa	No. CD and DVD media cannot be infected in that way.|`|YESUhp8gaa	No, cd and dvd that are bought from a store are not rewritable, so a virus could not effect them.    Now if you were burning a cd or dvd, a virus could get in during the burning process.|`|AA11340085	Yes really, first scan your PC then copy the data on CD/DVD.|`|ydHc4Bemaa	Unless you place the exact infected files onto that disk and then opened them on another computer you would not have any risk.  There is also protection in the form of antivirus programs looking for this sort of thing.  In addition many viruses need to be installed and not simply opened to work properly
NkbhHcIAaa	in the cmd prompt     type ipconfig /flushdns       this should help , sounds like you leave your modem on 24 - 7|`|oDFiqogfaa	There are different speed levels for internet, so having Comcast does not automatically make your internet 'fast.' Also, having multiple users on the same internet connection will slow it down, so if you have other people downloading files, playing games, etc. your internet will be slower. You should also make sure you have a password up so that your internet isn't being used by anyone else.     Try running this internet speed test and compare the speed to what Comcast says you should be getting.  http://performance.toast.net/  It will probably be around .5 - 1mb slower than advertised, but that's expected. If it's any higher and you have a password already and other people aren't on the internet, you should check with Comcast and make sure they're providing you with the correct speed.|`|Dr9ACCzPaa	Besides bandwidth and other connections on your router, you should clean out your temp internet files and cookies and history which can slow your browser down.

However, you mentioned that it is a DVD-ROM.  Is that really true?  ROM stands for Read Only Memory, which means it can't write data.  Double-check to make sure that it has write capabilities.    If it does, check with the manufacturer's web site and reinstall the drivers from there.
Vw5hR0Pyaa	Many times I have stared at my computer thinking "How do I fix my pc because it keeps crashing?"  Unfortunately there is no simple answer! I used to think this problem was related to buying cheap computers but after buying various laptops and desktops at different price ranges there is one common theme, eventually they will all crash at some stage!   Friends will often think I am a pc expert and will call me asking "How do I fix my pc when it keeps crashing?" Well start by asking yourself these questions...  Have your children be on the pc? Kids are great at downloading spyware by mistake! They will also click on numerous pop up pages and will often change your settings!  Another possible reason your pc keeps crashing is that you have overloaded it! If your pc only has 64mb RAM memory and you install graphic, gaming and other software the chances are that your system will not be able to cope with your software! Most PC's now come with at least 512mb RAM so it is worth upgrading if your pc is not at this level.  However the most common reason that your pc keeps crashing is that it has a virus! Many trojan virus can cause your computer to reboot immediately once all programs have been launched, this can drive you mad and it is not fun as you are helpless!  Best option is to install anti virus software and make sure you only visit trusted websites. If all else fails it is time to reformat your hard drive and wipe your pc clean, this can take hours and you will probably need the data recovery disc that you should have got when you bought the pc.  Recommend tool:  http://toptenantispywareviews.com [if you do not have one]|`|rMs4WBfcaa	See if it will boot in safe mode and run spybot|`|3werhIURaa	You have to reformat your Hard Disk Drive, and then Wipe it.

Luckily this already had a flanged end on it which bolted neatly over the hole I'd cut in the side of the pc case. I also cut slotted vents in the opposite side of the case, under the motherboard.

Your computer may hang the first time you boot-up...and never start.    If you're driving a brand spanking new beast, the only one that will really slow you down noteably is McAfee's offering. The ones least likely to slow you down are the ones everyone seems to love (Avast!, AVG, etc), and that is because they don't work.    Good Luck!    EDIT: Re: Norton...if you're going to go with the $20 program that will be an issue, since while based on an excellent program, it is the "poor cousin" and doesn't have the resources.

I was so stressed out after spending multiple days trying to remove the spyware with no luck. I gave up and decided to throw in the towel. I called geek squad. They came and looked at my computer, but wanted $300 to fix it. I really didn't have that much, so I told them I couldn't afford to fix it at this time. The technician must have seen the frustration I was going through. Because he pulled me aside and told me how I could fix it for under $60.     He told me to go to  http://www.honestspywarereview.com    So I checked into it, and found the best product, AdwareAlert is also capable of removing Trojans.    I quickly downloaded AdwareAlert and scanned my computer. It removed my malware infection, and also a couple spyware infections I didn't even know I had.    It has kept my computer running fast, and spyware free for a couple of months now. I highly recommend it.  I would suggest you give it a shot. It worked for me.

How to stop pop-ups and remove fake software, spyware, trojans and viruses:    Download, install, update and scan your computer with both Malwarebytes and SuperantiSpyware, delete anything they find, if this fails to completely remove the virus/spyware download then update Avast and run a boot scan (click schedule boot-time scan and restart your PC), all the software below is free and safe to use.    Malwarebytes: http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php    SuperantiSpyware: http://www.superantispyware.com/    Avast Anti-Virus: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    To protect your PC in the future you'll need to install anti-virus software and a firewall, id recommend using Avast and Comodo Pro firewall both are very effective and completely free, you should also switch to Firefox 3 if you are browsing with IE as its much safer and a lot easier to use. (links on my profile)    If you are unable to download the above software then its likely you are being redirected or blocked from downloading security software by a trojan called TDSSserv.sys follow the instructions below and you will be able to download Malwarebytes and SuperantiSpyware which will remove your virus.    start > run > type: devmgmt.msc > enter > view > show hidden devices > non-plug and play drivers > TDSSserv.sys > right click > disable > restart computer.

Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups. If possible, back up your entire installation (using Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image)|`|2ijxKbCKaa	First, try an online virus scanner like:   http://housecall.trendmicro.com/    If this doesn't fix the issue, try putting in the operating system CD from your computer and using the repair option.

If you weren't provided with recovery CDs, call Dell/HP/etc. and ask them to mail you them.|`|x1YZgCCnaa	Press F8 as your computer starts and use the arrow keys to select Safe Mode with networking, run your scans here and then run a system restore, if it comes down to it use your recovery disk that came with your PC.|`|xVbUwhZoaa	back up all your important data (music, pictures, movies, documents) and reinstall the operating system.    pop the disk in, boot from the disk, wipe the hard drive clean and start from scratch.     easiest, quickest, safest.|`|xJZSpsRhaa	the last thing you need to do is do a system restore...     1. Run your computer in safe mode.  This is done by pressing F8 (it might be F3 depending on the bios) on the load up screen.  Then select RUN Computer in safe mode with NO NETWORK. (disconnect your cord from the computer or turn off your router).  This will run all the essential programs to run your computer.  Minus all the viruses that keep popping up.      2. Your antivirus program should work now.  Run the scan.  When it finds all the viruses delete them and then restart your computer normally.      3.  If your problem continues repeat step 1 but with NETWORK ACCESS.  Update your antivirus software. and run the scan again.  Continue with all the proper steps on deleting your file.      4.  If the computer STILL doesn't run properly, download Spybot and this can be done in SAFEMODE WITH NETWORK ACCESS.  Install the program and run and delete all the viruse.  Spybot is a free program that is amazing to delet things like pop-ups and unwanted spyware.  Restart your computer and run it normally.      5.  now, if the problem is STILL there... well, then you may have to reformat.  You'll need to go into the bios and change how your compture loads.  Instead of it reading the HardDrive first, you need to switch it to read the CD/DVD-rom driver first.  After that is complete, put in the XP/VISTA disk and turn off your computer then turn it back on again.  It will give you the option to run the installation disk.

Variations of older viruses, designed to evade detection, are also more easily detected with updated definitions.    Update your antivirus program. Before some viruses can be detected, an update to the antivirus program is required. Check the antivirus software for an automatic update feature or visit the program's website to find updates.    Scan your computer for viruses. Doing a full scan can take a long time, so it's better to leave the computer and come back when it's finished. If you know which virus you have and which files it's infected, you can do a specialized scan of those files. That may remove that one virus, but you should then perform a full scan to detect others.    Remove the virus. Your antivirus program should do this automatically or with little interaction from you. Some files may be repaired, meaning the virus has been removed without harming the file. However, others may have to be removed or "quarantined" in a special folder or archive where they can't do any harm.    Repair the damage. Look at the list of infected files and try to restore any files you need. If they are executable files, reinstall the program that contained them. If they're document files, request new copies from the person who sent them to you. Scan and repair them before opening.|`|PuMsIIL6aa	Format your hard drive

Vw5hR0Pyaa	Many times I have stared at my computer thinking "How do I fix my pc because it keeps crashing?"  Unfortunately there is no simple answer! I used to think this problem was related to buying cheap computers but after buying various laptops and desktops at different price ranges there is one common theme, eventually they will all crash at some stage!   Friends will often think I am a pc expert and will call me asking "How do I fix my pc when it keeps crashing?" Well start by asking yourself these questions...  Have your children be on the pc? Kids are great at downloading spyware by mistake! They will also click on numerous pop up pages and will often change your settings!  Another possible reason your pc keeps crashing is that you have overloaded it! If your pc only has 64mb RAM memory and you install graphic, gaming and other software the chances are that your system will not be able to cope with your software! Most PC's now come with at least 512mb RAM so it is worth upgrading if your pc is not at this level.  However the most common reason that your pc keeps crashing is that it has a virus! Many trojan virus can cause your computer to reboot immediately once all programs have been launched, this can drive you mad and it is not fun as you are helpless!  Best option is to install anti virus software and make sure you only visit trusted websites. If all else fails it is time to reformat your hard drive and wipe your pc clean, this can take hours and you will probably need the data recovery disc that you should have got when you bought the pc.

FEQMb7wIaa	You may be running a lot of programs at once, causing your memory usage to spike. Restarting the computer will help, but it may only be temporarily. I believe this will work in Win '98:    Hit Shift+Ctrl+Esc to bring up the task manager ('98 may want you to do alt+ctrl+del). Under processes, there shouldn't be more than 30 or so running at once. Anything over that suggests you have computer bugs running rampant in your computer. The best suggestion for that is to get a program like Spybot, Ad-Aware and/or AVG to remove the bugs.|`|AA11802572	When you say memory, I assume that you mean hard drive space.  If so, I would do the following:    1. Go to add / remove programs in Control Panel, and remove every application that you do not use. (Especially the ones that take up the most space.)  2. Follow that with a disc clean up. Accessories, system tools, disc clean up.  3. De frag the hard drive. Accessories, system tools, disc defragment.    That is about all you can do, however, if you are determined to keep an old laptop, you could purchase a larger hard drive, clone it to the internal drive, and then swap out the drives.|`|15zapV8daa	Simple...

Now go to the start up tab and uncheck any programs that you don't use,  just make sure that the program is not used by Windows.  Now restart.

bxV80Clnaa	The Q6600 and Phenom II are about the same, performance wise. The Q6600 is well known as an overclockers dream, I'm not sure about the Phenom II though.|`|QYPrM3GPaa	Between the choices, I think you should drop any consideration of a dual core processor which eliminates the Athlon 64 X2 6400.  That is a good processor, by the way, I had one of them.  However, dual core is quickly going to go bye-bye and you would be buying into an aging technology.      My suggestion is to go only with a quad core processor, so that gets us to the Intel Q processors or the AMD Phenom series, both of which are quad core...now what do we do?    First of all, the Phenom has only ONE advantage, really, over the Intel Q processor - the Q processors still have a Front Side Bus, and the Intel Q processors are really two dual core chips "glued" together.  Sandwiched in between these two pieces is the FSB which allows both pieces to communicate with each other.  The Phenom though is a TRUE 100% quad processor because it is made from one single die and it does not have nor does it need a FSB.  As a result, the Phenom runs faster internally, executes more code than the Q processors do.  So this sounds like its smarter to go with the AMD processor than the Intel, and besides, the Intel is more expensive - however, and of course, there is always a however, right?    However - you only have limited choices when it comes to motherboards for the AMD processors - motherboard manufacturers are just not making nearly as many choices.  Granted, there are enough of them, but the fact is, this limits your choice of platform.  And the choice of a motherboard, as far as I am concerned is even MORE important than the processor itself.  This is because the motherboard and specifically, the Northbridge chip, called the "chipset" significantly dictates how the entire computer is going to work - so what I am saying is, you have less choices for features on your computer, less flexibility and consequently, less cost control, on an AMD based computer.  There is one further drawback of the AMD processors - they do NOT overclock as well as the Intel's do.    So if you are building this computer in hopes of overclocking to get better performance for games, I would stick with the Intel processor.  You have a much wider choice of motherboards for LGA775, and that means, you get more features on your motherboard for less money.  So the cost of an Intel processor is reduced when you go to buy your motherboard - unless, of course, you just have to have the most bleeding edge board available - which often is NOT necessary to do gaming with.  Only people who really have to tweak every last little detail need $350 - $400 motherboards - I don't think you really need that much power unless you just have to go to LAN parties all the time.    I would say a really good LGA775 motherboard runs somewhere in the neighborhood of $150 (plus or minus about $25).  For this kind of money, you can get a very nice motherboard from ASUS or Gigabyte, with all the features you want and need and the BIOS in these boards usually has sufficient overclocking features to satisfy most people (only the extreme overclockers find it insufficient for their needs).    My suggestion, is to go with the Intel processor, offset the higher cost processor with a modestly priced motherboard and I think you come out ahead of the game.  I recently built such a computer based on Intel Q9550 and I have an ASUS P5QC motherboard, running Vista Home Premium 64 bit and I have 8 gigabytes of RAM!  This is just a single PCIe mobo, and it was perfect for me because I had no need or desire to run SLI or Crossfire.  I may play an occassional game, but I don't need all that video power that Crysis demands on high resolution either.      I also think, after my recent experience here, that Intel has a more stable processor.  This is purely subjective, its just the "feel" that I get from working with the processor and the software.  I think Microsoft gears Windows towards Intel processors and Windows appears more stable as a result, things seem to work better - although I think AMD has a very transparent processor line, I just like the feel of the Intel processor a lot more.    Go for the Quad Core Intel processor - that is my recommendation to you.|`|af3a28b07826dce8ecfc28a5eaa91e13aa	All 3 are good for gaming which is a combination of the processor, video card, motherboard FSB, chipset speeds, and amount of ram and ram speeds.|`|VnCvn1mnaa	if your gonna get 4 cores get an intel i7 if you dont wanna pay for that I highly reccomend an e8500 from intel, 2 cores at 3.16ghz and higher bus speed than any q series.

Your previous question in Yahoo    I've studied him for years and I'm pretty close to my end results that I worked hard for, and I'm quite proud. A friend of my family's, he's a preacher, thinks Dr. Lecter is possessing me and teaching me these things and I should stop before something happens.  At first his warnings didn't bug me, but now they are just starting to irritate me and get to me. I don't want his stupid religion, but he's still trying to shove it down my throat. Should I be worried about what he says? I mean, Dr. Lecter is the only one that I have that doesn't criticize me or treat me bad or insult me or hurt me, and I come to think of him as a father and teacher as well as a savior from modern Society. He gave me back my confidence and many of my other senses too. Should I listen the the crazy preacher, or go the route I want to go? Oh and please don't say bad things about Dr. Lecter, it really makes me cry when someone insults him! Thanks!    What next your family talked and decided that you are related to King Louise of France also knowing as the Sun king. Dream on!

zorYTX59aa	If your YouTube is getting bombarded with "JavaScript" and   "Flash Player" messages, and people are telling you to get  or install something, DON'T TOUCH A THING.    You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java",   "Flash" or various web browsers -- and definitely stay away  from software that salespeople (disguised as answerers on  Yahoo) are trying to "sucker" you into buying.    None of those things will help you, because your computer   and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right?   The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add,   change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.    I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a   lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why   in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good   for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).    Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of  their own servers every single day without warning anybody,   in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions,   it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or   "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.    If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing   you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages,   it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet   files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.    "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get   permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay   there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer   much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of   them. The solution to that is to clear your "cache" of all the   "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" and "history". Then reboot.    If you're not sure how to clear your "cache", or if you would  like more tips on making YouTube run even better, (without   having to buy or install anything), click my avatar and send  send me a note, ideally with your YouTube or regular email   address. I'll guide you step-by-step on how to clear "cache"   (plus my tips) in plain English, with full explanations.    Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it;   do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts   my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever.   (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)    Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales   pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are   really disguised salespeople and peddlers. Their "answers"   have nothing to do with your problem, and their wares may  worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of selfish answer   is that? [my paraphrase] "Although you cannot even watch   or access videos, buy our downloader."    Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").    Note 4: If you truly believe that "Flash" is the problem, you  should perhaps consider 9.45 or 9.47. I have never strayed   away from 9.47, and lots of "flashers" swear by 9.45. Think  of those two as you would Windows XP compared to Vista.  Please consider this previous "Best Answer" of mine, then  check out the Asker's comments afterwards:    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...

zorYTX59aa	If you are telling us your sound works fine but not YouTube,  I don't think I have ever seen a more stupid and self-serving  reply than the one from answerer   2:  -- might have turned the volume down  -- or you might have muted it before  -- a cookie might have kept it that way  -- it could be due to slow connection  -- or it could be due to high traffic  -- try watching it during off peak hours  -- solution: BUY OUR DOWNLOADER.  By the way, 'cookies' are tiny files that websites plunk onto   your computer about your viewing preferences, such as the  features that you have enabled on your YouTube homepage.   Cookies do not affect sound whatsoever.    I see questions similar to yours every few days on Y!A now,  so I recently did a whole lot of Googling, searching, reading  and going through dozens of websites, only to discover that   there's no definitive answer out there.     The only semblance of a part solution which kind of worked  for a few people would require you to either:  1 -- mess around with your registry (which I would be totally   deadset against because that could really screw things up);   2 -- download some strange "utility" (which I'd be even more  against, because that kind of stuff is what probably created  your problem in the first place).    Thus, my first piece of advice to you: shutdown then reboot.  If that doesn't work, this is what I advise many other people  when YouTube is slow, stuck or weird:....Clear your "cache"  of all its "Temporary Internet Files". While you're doing that,  you should also clear your "History" and your "Cookies", in   order to make your computer "fresh". My famous triple-cure  seemingly resolves many people's YouTube problems, thus  why not yours. Please reboot after doing this:    Internet Explorer 6:   Tools  Internet Options    Delete Cookies  OK   Delete Files  OK   Clear History  Yes    OK    Internet Explorer 7:   Tools  Internet Options  Delete...   Delete files  Yes   Delete cookies  OK   Delete history  OK   Close (browsing history window)   OK    Mozilla Firefox   Tools  Clear Private Data  [x] Browsing History  [x] Download History  [x] Saved Form and Search History  [x] Cache  [x] Cookies   Clear Private Data Now    If that doesn't do the trick, here are some other suggestions:    ? If you've got "Google Web Accelerator" or anything similar,  uninstall it immediately. GWA destroys YouTube.    ? Long videos require both "Flash" and "Shockwave" to play  properly. Shockwave includes Flash, but not vice versa.    ? The most recent versions of "Flash" are frustrating quite a  lot of YouTubers. Most updates are typically good for only 1  thing: software conflicts. If you're using one of the 5 different   versions of version 10 (yes, there are 5), perhaps you would  want to consider this other "Best Answer" of mine:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...    ? Avoid crappy add-ons, downloaders and converters. There   are a lot of answerers on Yahoo! who are actually disguised   salespeople. If anyone's solution is for you to buy/install/get  something, please keep in mind that their answers probably  have nothing to do with your question, and that the products  they're peddling will no doubt worsen your problem. Besides,   what kind of boffo and self-serving answer is that? "Although   you cannot listen to YouTube videos or watch them properly,  buy our downloader". [my paraphrase]    ? Depending on which version of "Flash" you got, every new  session starts off with the volume is set to zero -- by default.   Maybe the only thing you need to do is scroll up the volume   of the video player.    ? Who knows why it works, but sometimes things go better  when you change the web URL from "www.youtube.com" to  just "youtube.com", or you could even try "ca.youtube.com".    ? A few people found success by closing their web browser,   then restarting it. A couple others simply rebooted, and one   person said that everything magically started working again  just like that on the following day -- with no effort on his part.  Thus your problem might just be a temporary glitch.    If you're able to find the "cause" and the "cure", I would very  much appreciate it if you could click on my avatar and write   to me, so that I may include it in my future Yahoo! Answers.  (Thus far, one apparent cause seems to be if you download  music from "Torrents".)    I wish you luck and hope that something in my long answer   does the trick for you.

zehv602Raa	You probably have the wrong security method selected.  The wireless network will be using either WEP, WPA, or WPA2 security.  If it's a WEP key, there would be a "passphrase" (passphrase is user created) and several "keys" that are generated from the passphrase.  Some wireless adapters will allow you to use just the passkey, some will require the key.  If it is WPA, it will be using either TKIP or AES encryption, in which case the key could have been generated or user created.      In either case, try configuring the network settings manually as windows often assumes wrong.  Go into "View Wireless Networks" in windows XP, and on the left common tasks pane go to "Change Advanced Settings." Go to the "Wireless Networks" tab.  Go to "Add."

zorYTX59aa	Let me guess:....1) You're using Firefox.  2) Videos stop after barely two seconds.  3) Videos work fine on Internet Explorer.  It sounds like it may be another case of   the "Firefox Blues".    But, I think I have your answer. Actually,  I have several possioble solutions:    1 -- FLASH PLAYER:  Many YouTubers are having headaches  with Flash version 9,0,115,0; and some  are having it more tough with version 10.    I, myself, have never strayed away from   Flash 9,0,47,0, and numerous "flashers"  swear by 9,0,45,0. You should consider   reverting back to an older version. If you   want a computer analogy, it's like going  from error-filled Vista to smooth-running   Windows XP. Please check out these 2  forum discussion boards:    forums . mozilla zine . org / view topic . php ? p = 3249140   3249140  http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic....    www . adobe . com / cfusion / web forums / forum / message view . cfm ?   forum id = 44 & cat id = 184 & thread id = 1330412 & enter thread = y  http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/webforums/f...    2 -- MOZILLA PLUG-IN  There have been many instances where  Mozilla's subdirectories folders seem to  be missing a vitally important ".DLL" file  for a lot of Flash players.    Look in "C:\ Windows \ System32 \ Macromed \ Flash" for file: "wpswf32.dll"  Copy-&-paste that file into "C:\ ProgramFiles \ Mozilla \ Firefox \ Plugins"  or  Look in "C:\ Windows \ System32 \ Macromed \ Flash" for file: "npswf32.dll"  Copy-&-paste that file into "C:\ ProgramFiles \ MozillaFirefox3Beta5 \ Plugins"    support . mozilla . com / tiki - view _ forum _ thread . php ?   locale = en - US & comments _ parent Id = 16131 & forum Id = 1  http://support.mozilla.com/tiki-view_for...    3 -- QUICKTIME PLAYER  If you click on my avatar and then open  up my Yahoo! "Q&A" profile of answers,   you'll see that I've answered a whole lot  of questions about slow/stuck YouTube.  I usually tell people to get rid of Google  Web Accelerator, and/or disable "Flash   Hardware Acceleration". Quicktime has  it's own version, and the above principle  should also apply here. Simply click on  the following:     Start  Programs  QuickTime  QuickTime Player   Edit  Preferences  QuickTime Preferences  Streaming    Inside the 2nd box that's called "Enable  Instant-on", get rid of the checkmark by  clicking it off. After that, simply click on   "Apply", followed by "OK".    4 -- DIFFERENT WINDOW  If you visited many sites while using the   the same "window" (sites like MySpace  and/or Yahoo!Answers), it's been known   to affect the functioning of YouTube. Try  opening up a new window, or exit out of  MySpace and/or Y!A altogether.    5 -- RESTART FIREFOX  Believe it or not, a few people were able  to resolve their problem just by shutting   down Firefox, and then restarting it.    6 -- CLEARING CACHE  I have saved my favorite solution for last.  For me, YouTube runs at its peak when   you delete your "cache" of all temporary   internet files, cookies and history. Even  if 1 of the above 5 does the trick for you,   absolutely nothing beats "starting fresh"   out of the shower and "unclogging" your   computer's memory:     Tools  Clear Private Data  [x] Browsing History  [x] Download History  [x] Saved Form and Search History  [x] Cache  [x] Cookies   Clear Private Data Now    I hope that my multiple answer is helpful  to you. If you are capable of determining  the "cause" and its "cure", I'd appreciate  it if you could please let me know, either  by clicking on my avatar, or emailing me  at "inukjuak90@yahoo.com".|`|AA11503678	you could reinstall flash player,  clean all offline content and internet cache.|`|7sRPS6hPaa	Try restarting your browser.

1RRO32Y6aa	Demonoid registrations are open right NOW!!!    If you do not see this post in time and the registration closes, download Tracker Checker 2 (Win) or Tracker Spy (Mac). It's a software that alerts you on when private tracker sites like Demonoid have open registrations and registers you automatically when they are open. ;)|`|2cep886Waa	http://bonerpwner.com|`|67a03774b3647b0531fb9965b58ec6d6aa	You will struggle to find someone that will give you an invite unless they know you. If you get warned or banned, they do too.  Your best option would to sign up when they open their doors to the public.  I saw it open for a few hours a day from 26th to 29th Jan, a shame you missed it. Previous to this it was open for for 2 days that ended on the 21st Jan.  Open Registration days can be any day of the week, are not necessarily every month and can last hours or days.  I'd advise you to check the site EVERY day and eventually you will get there.  If you can't get an invite you will need to follow this path, good luck.  Please try and keep your share ratio above 1.1 when you get in.    You may find this tool useful, it's called Tracker Checker and you can leave it running in the background - http://www.stamcar.com/2007/07/25/tracke...  If you use this tool you will need to edit a few trackers, the Demonoid one needs the 'find string' changing from 'sername' to 'Desired username'    Hope this helps.

(like u said to me  :P|`|5fkqsnBJaa	Good security can be had for free, its just not in a neat all-in-one "security suite"    For good computer security and to prevent virus you need to do a minimum of 4 things.    1. Run a firewall.    2. Use a good anti-virus with real-time protection.    3. Do a regular scan with a dedicated anti-spyware,    4. Keep Windows and all your other installed software, 100% updated and patched with all important and security updates.  ______________________________________...    My recommendations:    1. For the typical home user of XP or Vista, Windows Firewall is adequate, even more so if one is using a router, which is a very good firewall in itself. Make sure your Windows Firewall is turned "on".    2. For your Anti-Virus......(Always use only 1 A-V...You must NEVER use more than one anti-virus, Even an expired anti-virus can cause a major conflict...did I mention that you MUST uninstall any and all, old anti-virus products?)    I would suggest Avast, the newest version 4.8. Avast now includes anti-virus, some anti-spyware capability and anti-rootkit components. And all for the low low price of free. You can get it here:  http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    3.  For your Anti-Adware and Anti-Spyware needs...  SUPERAntiSpyware:  http://www.superantispyware.com/    They have a free version.    4. Use Secunia PSI to insure that all your software is kept always updated and patched against vulnerabilities that are often exploited to compromise computers. Very important.     http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scannin...    Its free as is everything else here. Saving cash these days is important!|`|SCwaLz43aa	The previous commenter is right AVG from GRIsoft is very good.  here is the url ---> http://free.avg.com/    Also, many others like AVAST ----> http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...      Most of the commercial (subscription) AV vendors have a free on line virus checker, just make sure you are actually on the vendors web site.  Don't just assume a hit from a search engine is a legitimate service that seems to be associated with a popular brand name like Symantec, McAfee, Sophos, Trend or Panda

With Comodo Firewall you can check your Network Zones.    If you are running a Vista-based computer then it is best to switch of Network Sharing.  Normally changing a network type to Public or Work helps - happens when the computer first detects the network.    >> Found in Control Panel > "Classic View" > Network and Sharing Center  >> Switch off: Network Discovery, File Sharing, Public Folder Sharing, Media Sharing and (?)Printer Sharing.  >> Keep Password-protected sharing ON.    Also you might want to switch OFF Remote Access  >> Control Panel > "Classic View" > System > Advanced System Settings (in the left-hand side column) > Remote tab > uncheck 'Allow Remote Assistance...' > Apply > OK    Hope this helps.

zehv602Raa	Check the permissions of both the computer and the user in Active Directory Users and Computers.  Easy thing to do is compare the properties window of an account you know works against the one that doesn't.  Also check Domain Security Policy and make sure the computer or user is not blocked by some security policy under Local Policies or under Restricted Groups.  Also make sure that there is not an IP conflict with the computer by going to DHCP managment.  Sometimes DHCP can assign two computers (or a computer and printer) the same IP.

Here's what I did.     I downloaded and SAVED not RAN, the removal tool from the Symantec website, and ran my computer in SafeMode. To get to SafeMode, just press F8 when the computer is starting up and croll down to SafeMode and hit enter. It will boot the computer up and SafeMode is like a big doofy version of regular Windows, and it has the word SafeMode in all four corners of the screen. Now when you've done this, you will open the file to wherever you saved the removal tool, preferrably your desktop, and run it. It may or may not tell you that you don't have permission, if it doesn't and doesn't run then, just right-click on the FixBrisv icon and Run as Administrator, or if you can't do that then when you are regular Windows, not SafeModde, disable User Account Control by going into Control Panel and User Accounts there's an option to turn UAC on or off, click it and turn it off by unchecking the box there. Back in SafeMode, when you get to run the tool, it will load and scan. When it finishes scanning what happened to me was that it told me that there was no virus to remove. But there was. Then I rebooted my computer and because I have Norton, there is something called AutoDetect or Protect, can't remember which, that will detect and remove the trojan. Just like that. No details left out whatsoever. Should this not work for you, then I'm sorry to say that I don't know what else to do. But I did do something before I ran the scan in regular Windows. I went into my Norton, went to the History, and clicked on the virus' name. It had the option to review, remove, and something else that isn't important. Hit the review button and sen it to Symantec for review. It will open an Window about the virus and what you can do to get it off. After a while a messgae popped up that said that my inquiry had been sent to Symantec for review. I don't know if that is what did it, but try that too BEFORE you use the removal tool scan in SafeMode. Then go on about everything else EXACTLY as I typed. This should work, but if you are not certain, run a full system scan with Norton, just to make sure.     Strange though, I know what the virus does, but it did not affect my computer in any way. I was still able to use Limewire, and listen to all of my media. I guess it was a matter of time before it did something, luckily I got rid of it in time.    I wish you the best of luck! Should you need anything, you can just let me know by editing your question in response. I'll be back to check if your answer was resolved.

ajvSggX1aa	Is your laptop wireless N?  If not you will need the adapter to get wireless N speeds.  If your laptop is wireless N then you will not get any faster speeds with the adapter    I guess I misunderstood. As long as your desktop is connected via Ethernet cable to your router. Then there is no need for wireless N adapter as that would be slower than Ethernet speeds.     Wired is still faster than Wireless.    The Only reason you would need this Adapter is if you want to have your desktop wireless. Which in most situations is not needed as desktops aren't very portable.      Hope this Helps    Gumby

H0gEUeNjaa	How to Remove Trojan.Brisv.A!inf Malware Press here http://thecooltools.blogspot.com/2009/02...|`|pYGjF6Guaa	Download and run Malwarebytes which will delete this obvious virus:      http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant...|`|lb0bYSgUaa	In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  Theres a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)  click on the Troubleshooting link.  Heres my advice from it:    1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.    2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.       * McAfee Stinger  a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.     * SpyBot Search & Destroy  a spyware/adware scanner     * Lavasoft Adaware  for spyware/adware    Note  it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!
