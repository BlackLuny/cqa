20090128091858AAFB8o0	Local Businesses;United States;New York City	How can I start my own limosine / taxi company in NJ?	My wife and I would like to start our own business and we came up with the idea of a limo service company would be a real good one to benefit from. We all know that a limo or a taxi is always going to be needed no matter if the economy is up or down. I was thinking of maybe finding a job with one just to see how it all works. (which i don't think its rocket science either but who knows) So if any one who knows and can break it down for me as far as where would i get a license or certificate, is there a limit to how many cars, possible cost of insurance, equipment needed for the base and cars, etc.... Thanx so much :)
