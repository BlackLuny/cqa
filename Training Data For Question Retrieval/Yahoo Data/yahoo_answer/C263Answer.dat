BpcAVgEeaa	I'm only a sophomore, but high school definitely is not what I thought it would be. I hate all of the cliques and popularity contests that go on for no apparent reason. Last year, I was sort of the "new girl" and since I didn't play any sports, people immediately shunned me. I didn't understand it, but I went on to make friends in other things: like choir and the drama department. :)

Find a style that suits your face, there are plenty of short hair pics posted all over the Internet. Then take it to a stylist and get it cut. And you can still have your left over hair put in good use by donating it to cancer patients.|`|950f09b4f4e23c03823f94b1474abdedaa	I would suggest keeping your hair, only because I know how much you love it, and how awesome you tell everyone your hair is! It's just one more bragging right you have! <br>  <br>  But.. you're pretty and wonderful enough to get away with no hair if you wanted! :-)|`|YdXhZka8aa	I always thought short haired girls looked smart.  You can cut your hair but if you want to increase your smartieness, buy some glasses and get a breast reduction.|`|TUi2BBCraa	I think it's possible.

They have different rules 2, i hope u kno, so i think u r the unaware one!|`|uqLUKbMbaa	The Muslim religion is what it is.  You do what your religion dictates.  The Politically correct people and the Media are giving Muslims very bad press.  Especially with what is written today in the daily mail.  That Muslims consider it sin to play chess, ludo etc.  That Muslim schools are teaching the children to hate the western World.  An insurmountable wall is being built between Muslims and non-Muslims.  Wars have been fought over less than this.  I live amongst Muslims and find them all to be friendly people.  My neighbours have taught me how to make good curry. They have their ways and we have ours.  Just last year it was a Muslim gentleman that insisted on mowing my lawn.  I can do it myself, but he said that an 80 year-old man should be taking life easy.  Was he talking about me?  He and I are very good friends.  We do not want these politically correct people or the media stirring up trouble amongst us.  Think very carefully about converting.  It is not the Muslim religion that is causing rifts between us.  If you should convert, you know you will get a lot of flak from family and friends.  I wouldn't want that to happen.|`|NHqtf4sXaa	If you are a true Muslim you wouldn't think like this, you been thinking like this because u r weak and poor Muslim. Otherwise, all the religions in the world are believed and make people respecting each other. I am Muslim and I respect all the religion in the world be the Islam taught me that.

"burka" is infact NOT forced...in the quraan it said women can show their FACES and hands.. you dont want to cover your self dont but the burkaa is NOT forced..  so chill about that k? <br>  and not to be rude or anything but how can u call ur self a true muslim if you go on complaining about your FAITH! come on! please if you have somthing to say about islam dont go giving out wrong information and complaining about it! <br>  life is like a test, we have rules ..  break them and you have consequences... follow them and you will be praised. <br>  <br>  thanks, <br>  peace&love

FZKFLTyLaa	We could sell Michigan to the Koreans, so to keep the auto industry afloat. That would also save a lot of energy, as Koreans need less heating resources when they eat kimchee.<br>  Sell Hawaii to the Japanese. They could do marine salvage and bring millions of tons of steel from Pearl Harbor to the US to bolster the flagging steel industry.<br>  Next, let's annex Texas and Arizona to Mexico. It seems only fitting and proper, plus a lot of  that steel could be incorporated in new<br>   fences.<br>  A French/Netherlands consortium could purchase Louisiana and built mightier dikes for flood prevention.<br>  All the Rocky Mountain state might be ceded to Germany. With their amazing engineers, they could rearrange the mountains across the border with Canada, thus preventing Arctic winter winds invading the US.<br>  A portion of Illinois might be sold to the Palestinians - whatever geographical area  where one finds East Palestine -  thus solving the Middle East crisis.|`|DA5ZbYjlaa	As a gesture of good will, I am willing to sell off my home state of Pennsylvania.

It's clear to me that we need to hold on to our high-value states, like Alaska, Hawaii, Florida and California (resources, tourism, ports) for as long as humanly possible to drive the auction price up.  However, we do need cash *right now*, so....<br>  <br>  We sell off the territories and half-states first--Guam and Puerto Rico.  Yes, it sounds insulting, but being a mere "territory" or "commonwealth" after all this time is likely just as bad an insult.  Sell them to Venezuela in exchange for privileged oil rights, to get some leverage on OPEC and Big Oil both.  At the very least Puerto Rico will thank us for selling them off to a left-leaning, socialist nation that might be more *helpful* to them.<br>  <br>  After that?  ^__^  I think the key is to start small.  Think *cities*, not whole entire states.  One could make a convincing case that selling New Orleans and Detroit to Quebec at a fire-sale price would hurt us the least, and while it might not *pull in* a ton of money right off, being relieved of the burden of *caring for* those cities will pay back dividends in saved money in short order.<br>  <br>  And since doing this would make those cities de facto Canadian, living conditions might actually improve there...again, a win-win on the cheap.  ^__^  What?  It isn't like most "American" made cars aren't half-Canadian already....<br>  <br>  But yeah, think small...and think of the Benjamin Franklin saying, "A penny saved, a penny earned."  Selling cities, versus whole states, lets us keep resources while we're relieved of spending money on urban renewal and rebuilding.<br>  <br>  ^__^  Like this is ever happening, but ok...  *lol*  Edit:  And the next stage?  The obvious one: selling cities to companies.  One could submit that Microsoft already owns a chunk of Redmond, Seattle, etc.  And that Wal-Mart has a chokehold on places in Arkansas, Alabama and Mississippi.|`|IKCfT9tnaa	The heck with sellin' em off...let's buy more!!<br>  Buy Mexico and all of South America and make them pay taxes...finally!<br>  Buy Canada and tax that cold air they continue to want to send down here...maybe they will decide to keep it up there and save our heating bills!<br>  Besides, both have good beers and I would no longer have to pay import tax..<br>  see it's a win-win<br>  BUY MORE!!|`|ef019cfbfac8800f4935b6a537172515aa	The State of Confusion, State of Indecision, State of the Art, these three seem to be of little use to anyone..<br>  <br>   We might have a hard time finding one buyer for all three, but, if we could unload them, think how we could move forward..|`|7ZzwbCd1aa	Cute, but we're the UNITED States of America.<br>  <br>  United we stand, divided we fall.|`|c9a60fdb57c6d0b3e097f61fc57c9d3daa	I think we should sell some of those states like Montana and Wyoming and Idaho.

BpcAVgEeaa	I think she is trying to be something she is not. She died her hair black, wears tons of makeup and crazy vintage clothes, and most of her songs are nothing more than catchy digitalized pop songs. Before she was Katy Perry, she was Katy Hudson, a blonde Christian singer. I just don't know who she really is.

Sometimes, when I'm happy I will smile and that's about it and when I'm sad I pretend everything's alright (well, just because I don't want anyone to worry about me)... and it's sort of hard when I'm like that because then the person I like will never know...|`|dLt5mVHRaa	nah i pretty much hide everthing inside. but i dont really have anyone so i ahve nobody to talk to even if i needed it.|`|maWfU0LNaa	i keep all my emotions to myself, i don't think it's healthy though b/c i can cry out of nowhere without even being sad, it's strange|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I prefer to mask them a bit.

Especially the legendary ones.  I'm always telling my wife who this person or that person is.  A lot of these newest ones, though, I don't know that well.  You know, I took this question to mean "Did I know actors and actresses when I seen them on T.V.?"  I guess, that was a logical perspective that anyone could have taken with this question.  But, when I looked at the question again after going the whole weekend and coming back, I seen the perspective that your other answerers seen.  Personally, I don't know any actors and actresses in real life.  It would be cool to know some though.  I met Emma Kelly, the old pianist that was in "The Midnight of Good and Evil."   She gave me one of her CDs and autographed it for me.|`|2e8927a3f6a8ce1bcb8c36d3d86c7439aa	Yah my friend Nat , he is a D- List actor <br>  Real down to earth guy has'nt went to his head yet . <br>  Ill actually be hanging with him tonight , alot of people dont know he is so he is still able to go out in public. his only Major Motion picture so far was The Great Debaters with Denzel Washington he was in the Harvard seen if you saw the movie|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I actually do know a few of "smaller" time ones.

This used to be uncommon but its become more popular because of the economy. I personally don't understand how you cannot be married to the person but you can continue to live with them? Its not possible for you to throw away the years of marriage, and ignore them as if they never occurred then live together as roommates. There is going to be some type of residual feelings no matter how hard they try.<br>  I think if the two had an amicable divorce, its more likely to work than if it was a difficult or contested one.|`|qXMQDi5Haa	Like the people say, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  But it happens a lot.  Depends on the personality types of the couples.  I know of many people who have done this for years & it works out well for them.

d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	I wouldn't call myself a hardcore fan but for a performer that seems to have been around the airwaves forever, he at least has a lot more creativity going for him than say the similarly overplayed Foo Fighters for example.

He also is one of the best showmen I've ever seen. <br>  <br>  Favorite tune is kind of tough. I know my favorite record is Mutations. I think I would maybe go with hmm... Right this second I think I would take Pay No Mind (Snoozer). Part of me feels like taking Guess I'm Doing Fine, but I know that is more of a momentary instinct. <br>  <br>  Novacaine is pretty awesome too. There are just a ton of good ones. I also think Modern Guilt was a lot better than the buzz around it seemed to credit it. It may not have had a single song that blew my socks off, but it was a very consistent and strong record. Really good.<br>  <br>  ***************<br>  Hi Rckts.<br>  I'm doing good man, really glad at the prospects of sleeping in tomorrow. How about you buddy?

oiNkygNtaa	i agree with you 100%|`|KkRb3paPaa	yeah i would like to have kids someday<br>  <br>  edit: i read it wrong, why would i want to have kids? Because I think it's a bit selfish i mean to get married but not have kids for some reason. I get it if you can't have kids but if you can and you don't want to i think it's mean. besides I want to be a mom someday and I would like to raise a child.. the right way, and be a good mom, and I would want to have generations of my family and I would want them to make a difference and live their dreams and accomplish great things.<br>  <br>  woo that's a bit long and all over the place.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	tax benefits|`|sHgWtEA0aa	to carry on my last name|`|AA12280291	I already have kids...<br>  But, in the next life...<br>  I just want to be responsible for "ME" ONLY!<br>  No one else!|`|AA11016425	Well I already have them so I might as well want them.|`|9CCtt077aa	What makes you think that I want kids?

r59SRbKIaa	Girl, ask yourself this:<br>  <br>  Why do you want someone who has lied to you and is sleeping with with someone else? How can you call this "love"?<br>  <br>  My wife has two words for this. "Ewww" and "Ick."|`|xGyL7eRZaa	how old is the guy?|`|jiOohUa0aa	Look, this guy is a pervert, he only wants to play with you, he's a player, he might force you to do things and that will be considered rape. If you're with this guy, you might end up pregnant, and you'll get in trouble, he will say he's not the dad, you'll cry because you know he is the dad, you'll go to Oprah to do the DNA test, your mom is going to slap you, your dad is going to kill this guy, he will deny everything, he will go to jail, but you'll be considered the *****, because you knew he had a relationship and you'll be a single mom, all because you decided to be with this perv. Dump him first before he do anything to you!|`|mVNMgaQBaa	well, he was probably lieing about divorcing his wife, everyone that cheats on there wives say oh yea, im married, but im divorcing her but then they dont you should tell his wife, maybe they really are divorcing but you need to find that out from both sides first|`|QXnZy9m2aa	oh this is just what we need.... get out of this ... no good will come of it you confront the wife... he is just using you for "fun time"|`|XCn2dK1laa	Either you're a troll or you're serious.<br>  either way,wtf is a 15 year old doing with a married guy in the first place?!?
xwIcuEaXaa	To make it look better or sound better? <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there isn't a cheap way to do either. When I decomissioned my crappy guitar, to make it look better,  bought some luthier books and added inlays and repainted it. it was kinda fun, but expensive.<br>  <br>  If you're looking to upgrade sound, then you're probably going to have to buy some new pickups for it. The cheapest (and best in my opinion) are DiMarzio pickups. As to what type you want is up to you. They have alot of sound bytes on their page, so you can pick and choose. <br>  <br>  Long and short of it though, to fix up your guitar sonically, it's going to cost you anywhere from 70-250 bucks. :/

Once I was given a really  nasty nick name, and my wonderful friends called themselves the same, with pride...it really backfired on the jealous girls who started it. Rumors are just an unfortunate side effect of having a social life...If you are a decent person and have integrity with your friends, it will blow over and whoever started it will move to er next victim. Remember, she won't get away with it forever...People don't trust or like girls like that...|`|p03Jc7eHaa	sure,but who cares,just tell them its all true|`|d5ug5W5kaa	yea..just ignore it..they will stop.|`|bEwk1i4Baa	yeah, I just tried to ignore it.|`|XDfrSfrvaa	yes, and yes|`|Qih2hKqkaa	I prayed for them!|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I think everyone has at one point or another.

No one likes to see themselves being an A&& even if they are an addict.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if he is on a sedative and that is why he is so mellow these days or it just might be a matter of him really concentrating on his own sobriety - thats my hope anyway :)|`|ExyPc0vMaa	He's FFFFucked, he needs to go on disability|`|NwYwLdsNaa	In the summer of 2008, he entered the Pasadena Recovery Center to participate in the second season of Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew.[24] He also participated in Sober House, a Celebrity Rehab spin-off focusing on a sober living environment.

Poor Rihanna. <br>  <br>  After TMZ posted this picture, I really didn't think anything wrong of it. It shows the public the severity of this crime and act of hypocrisy. This increases support very drastically for Rihanna, the poor victim of wretched domestic abuse.|`|KAkiPY3kaa	Honestly its expected... and its our (the publics) fault because everyone wanted to see it. Its all about money.... disgraceful but expected|`|nuLroEjraa	it's effed up, really.<br>  violation of the girl's privacy, she's been through plenty already.<br>  but at least there's a face to domestic violence, people should see how damaging these situations can be, both physically and emotionally.|`|AA11596713	actually i think it'll make rihanna a great public figure.. it's good publicity for her. chris brown is gonna go down.

It's the fermentation process--much the same thing happens with cold cuts, especially salami and pepperoni.  It concentrates a mono-amine called tyramine that at night stimulates the brain and digestive system, triggering weird dreams.<br>  <br>  Serious here.  ^_^  This is why some drugs have food-drug interactions with cheeses, cold cuts and fermented beverages--tyramine among other things raises blood pressure, and the drugs in question (like the old-school MAO inhibitors for depression) could let it rise up in an uncontrolled spike.  O_O<br>  <br>  So yeah, it does....but if you're on a budget, your highest-percentage option is to snag a double pepperoni pizza late at night.  That does it too, and a bit more cheaply.  ^_^  Thanks for your time!

A little creepy at the same time, but so funny to me when the robot's arms fall off..... <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYk0787MIw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYk0787M...</a>|`|5pj25lL4aa	i was outside playing volleyball with a part of my class. the ball was served and in the reach of one of my friends. instead of reaching  out to hit the ball, she ducked and landed on her knees. the ball hit her on the head. it was really funny.|`|NJv2zKxnaa	You don't want to know.<br>  <br>  ;]|`|UIzaamJ7aa	Cat jumping off the car because of the alarm.|`|LpMGGmFuaa	A group of high-school gals were in the Subway Sandwich shop and two of them had flip-flops on...<br>  This is vermont, and there is snow on the ground and those kids had frigging FLIP FLOPS on...<br>  <br>  hahahahahaha|`|EvMZJ6eyaa	Your profile picture.|`|lDi8nbKKaa	I saw someone fall over in the snow today,It was hilarious to watch lol|`|5eSSAT69aa	cute kid.

A girl was wearing Daisy Duke shorts, a spaghetti strap t-shirt and Uggs.  It was only about 45 this morning, she must have been freezing. But several boys were looking at her. Mission accomplished I guess.|`|95uXmC94aa	LOL ;) That's cute. I haven't seen anything funny since it's only 10:23 am right now but I will sooner or later!|`|m9tWBMBJaa	awww thats adorable!<br>  your daughter seems like a fun girl to be around.<br>  :D|`|Qih2hKqkaa	Nipples on a man!

FZKFLTyLaa	Admit it and if anyone makes a big deal out of it, ask for a show of hands from those who have never vomited.|`|AA12318686	Hi Jewel!<br>  I hope that you're feeling better! <br>  Did you get sick ... during .... classes? Were the classroom doors open or closed? If they were closed, probably nobody even knew that it was ...you ... who got sick. The same with the other areas that you mentioned, if it was during class time, probably very few people knew about it. If a friend mentions it, you could smile and say,  "Yeah, where's my get well card?" or if they are not a friend, you could tell them that they are soooooo immature and not tell them whether you got sick or not. Kids can be cruel, I know. By Monday, however, it will not be an issue. Please don't you make an issue about it, otherwise it will remind people about it and they will talk about it. Just drop the subject. Try to forget about it. Think about and talk about something positive and interesting. Enjoy your life !|`|rjsfiWt9aa	yeah you admit that its yours, if u say no everyone will be like "yeah it sooo was urs!" and then its gunna be a scene. Just be like "eww yeah, worst moment of my life" then the subject will change and everything will be fine.|`|jQbKPzX0aa	Say you were sick and that it was an accident. I don't see what the big deal is, I mean every one throws up (at least once in their life). and its probably cleaned up by now.|`|WZe1D2jaaa	Why should people care? It's not like they had to clean it up. <br>  <br>  Just ignore them. Shrug and walk off.

1A4klmh7aa	30 Hours might be a little early....<br>  <br>  I know that any major audition I've ever had (I'm a musician not an actor so it may be a bit different) they like us to be there about half an hour early if we have an appointment or are on a schedule (in case they're running ahead and to give us time to settle in with the surroundings). If it's an open audition, try and take into consideration how many other people may be auditioning and try to go by that. Two hours would probably be sufficient, but if you're exceptionally paranoid you may want to get there three or more hours early. <br>  <br>  There is no reason for you to need to camp out for it or anything, unless it were American Idol which is madness. <br>  <br>  Most importantly you just want to make sure that you are professionally on time.|`|uBkvqcY6aa	If your audition is scheduled.  Go 30 min ahead.  If it's an open audition maybe 2 or more hours.

CV4dIYaeaa	um...<br>  well, i am not sure if this counts, but in the manga love hina the main girl, naru, is trying to get into tokyo university. <br>  and she dosent have everything in the palm of her hand.<br>  however, its also a fan service manga (if you catch my drift)<br>  sorry if i am not helpful, but i hope this helps?|`|QlAj0Braaa	Creamy mami is the only other one i can think of. Its a cute eighties anime about a little girl who can turn into a beautiful lady with magical powers and a great singing voice.
NGNeT3rYaa	Yes, she is back to the old Kendall who didn't take crap from anyone. SHe didn't like Bianca when she first came to town and it looks like she doesn't like her again. She does have good reason this time but if she cuts her out she has to do Zach too!|`|AA11202477	Not really. She still loves Zach. She's just mad at him. And you're right - she does have good reason. If I woke up froma  3-month coma, the last thing I'd want to hear is that my husband delivered his baby by my Lesbian sister. Talk about a wake-up call. What Im afraid of is that she's going to revert to the "old Kendall", and trust me - the old Kendall was so tough, she drove Erica crazy. I like her more since she's more human, but I've got a feeling we're going to see a little of the O/K before things settle down.|`|ADBMrG87aa	Yes my opinion has changed.  I didn't like the new improved sweet kind Kendall, was way too much sugar for my liking but I'm starting to like today's Kendall; bring out the cat claws and let them have it!  LOL|`|mIUjnujeaa	I love love love kendall. I think she goes overboard a bit but what woman scorned wouldn't?|`|D3Fyxj0raa	not really i still cant stand her|`|6kBAj12gaa	She definitely has a lot of fight in her, I guess after surviving and fighting for her life to get out of the coma really builds her up to think "why stop there?" I think she really is stronger than she was before but there is a big change in her...<br>  <br>  I do believe she has every right to be as ticked off and resentful as she is....i know i would be... <br>  <br>  She is a bit hypocritical in the fact that she SLEPT with Aiden while Zack just kissed Reese...i hate reese but if Zack can forgive kendal for SLEEPING with Aiden she should be able to forgive a kiss...but that kiss did cause the reason for Greenlee being on the road that night.<br>  <br>  <br>  I wonder if it is related to her having her brothers heart and that is why she is a little more spitful now..?|`|XnYkROf3aa	ive all ways liked kendall. don't get me wrong there were times i wanted to knock her block off. but i have all ways liked her. im still trying to figure out the new kendall. some how i just know she will be here old self again.|`|aaUogxkHaa	I can not stand Kendall, not before, not now.<br>  I think she over acts.  <br>  She sticks her nose in everyone's business.<br>  This story line is working on my last nerve.|`|jHDeIPEfaa	I have always loved Kendall. She adds spice to the show. When she's bad, the show is even better. Hope she keeps her grudge with Bianca and Reese for a long time. But I hope she soon forgives Zach. They have a beautiful love story.

But the bruising, etc probably really showed up the next day.  He choked her out and then left her there when she passed out.  Then his bodyguards came back and gave him a ride.  He might be charged with attempted murder because while choking her, he said "NOW I'm gonna kill you."|`|a5dPOyNbaa	damage|`|tmckNa4baa	They got in a fight after chris got a bad text message i think. Rihanna threw his car keys out the door and chris couldnt find it so he started beating rihanna up. Rihanna called 911 and chris fled. Btw chris is not in jail anymore, he got a 50,000 dollar bail out.|`|ztb1F35Xaa	Aparently ya it was worst than a tiny slap|`|k39bNUgeaa	Did you not see the picture?<br>  <br>  It was a lot more then a slap. It was several hard hits|`|cIqpL3tGaa	a beat down, and good too cause she gave him the herpes.

I've got to say though, i'm sceptical as to whether it'll be as good as we remember (is anything? we always build stuff up in our mind over time, then when we see/hear/taste it again, it's never as good as we remember) I have to say this though, when i saw them doing this show, they were like a team that had never been apart, both sparking jokes off one and other, so FINGERS CROSSED|`|hkLOvwFGaa	I heard that they (the Red Dwarf producers etc.)<br>  were making a 'back to Earth' series.<br>  <br>  As a fan of Red Dwarf, I look forward to it returning<br>  to our TV screens.|`|sm2RK9Nxaa	WOW!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Is it with the original cast??<br>  <br>  Whos Holly??|`|1EHX6fQ7aa	Seriously? wow.

Keep it going Miley.|`|0O3JvmE7aa	Personally,I could care less.<br>  <br>  I just find it extremely funny how butt hurt fangirls go out of their way to find fault with everything she does.|`|1f4c803984defdfd24e382289f4e3180aa	No thanks. I'd rather watch paint dry..|`|6lkNOFNlaa	She wrote that song which you should give her credit for. Also, she is a much better singer than me and probably all of you lot, and as for acting,  she is most definitely better than any of you so give her a break.|`|a5dPOyNbaa	i'm not gonna watch it..but I HATE miley cyrus.
gLWcR12Naa	yea i am too...her whole face is scratched and bruised up. Her forehead, cheeks, and her lips...I don't why some of those crazy fangirls of his are still standing by him. Must have not been abused before or are just plain stupid. Sorry...no offensive but thats what I think.|`|x4kP6FGLaa	yea i just saw them!! poor girl! i thought he beat her a lot less...but gosh he like ruined her whole entire face<br>  and to think i actually liked that guy...|`|VS62RJQSaa	i saw them i feel bad 4 her im shocked to who would've thunk|`|iWwsOK5Baa	Yes!

AA12376180	Sometimes I wonder about the education level of the people asking the question. The term "sheet music" seems to be unknown to these people. "Where can i find the notes for Bella's lullaby?"<br>  <br>  I will confess my education level is questionable because I have no idea who Bella is.<br>  <br>  When I buy a piece of sheet music, it is because I want to own it. I plan to have it for many years. I do not understand people who go the library and xerox a Beethoven Sonata, it's like they are going to work on it and then throw it away. My memory is not that good, I need to reference the music occasionally and would not like making new copies each time. We have two different sets of values, I guess.<br>  <br>  The problem with actually purchasing sheet music, I now have stacks of music cluttering the music room. The upside is friends think I am much smarter than I am.|`|w0RFhzvVaa	are'nt you also annoyed my illeagal song downloading,<br>  I mean as a musician those extra pennys off cd's did their good.<br>  <br>  but no, personally i'm not annoyed by free sheet music as I use it myself =p<br>  maybe if they had sheet music libraries, that would fix the problem for us broke musicians, and we wouldnt need free sheets.|`|ziz0xURoaa	I'm not annoyed but rather find it amusing. Why do people download and print sheet music so much? My friend does it and his piano is a mess, there is a stack of paper, all unorganized by composers, basically a huge mess.<br>  <br>  I'd rather buy the sheets and keep all of my pieces in an organized binder or book. If I want Chopin etudes then I can turn to my Chopin sheet book of etudes, that way they're all there and organized. If I want the Schubert impromptus (my favorite I might add) then they're perfectly there. <br>  <br>  But then again I bet many of the composers who are now long gone would oppose copyrights such as Liszt, whom gave free piano lessons and hated charging for music.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	YES! I get tired of everybody on Y!A wanting published works for free -- sheet music AND recorded music alike. <br>  <br>  You're not entitled to this stuff for free, people. Publishers have to make a living, too, just as the questioner said.<br>  <br>  My typical reply is usually something like: "I'll tell you where to find the stuff for free ... right after you let me come into your house and steal something that you worked hard to acquire."|`|ca64f074806522d41931e7a2676ce936aa	I think they are silly and show a total lack of inability to use the internet - which is surprising as most of the enquirers appear to be the young who I thought knew about these things. But get annoyed? Not really, there are far more things in life to get annoyed about than people asking daft questions on Y!A. Such repetitive and mindless questions seem to appear on all sections of the board (well at least those that I follow with any regularity). E.g. endless silly questions about Hitler/The Holocaust on History, 'what are the stones for around railway tracks' in railways (coupled with 'how do I get from A to B and how much will it cost' - the answer could be found in 1 minute by checking one of the many travel sites)  and 'how do I make a picture in black and white with just one colour' (look at the 1000s of answers already given) and 'do I look pretty' in photography. It seems, sadly, that despite all the millions of money thrown at education in the civilized world we still seem to be raising a generation of idiots. That makes me more annoyed than the silly questions asked.|`|qswrz268aa	Its stupid. <br>  <br>  "I need to fnd ths song now cn u fnd it 4 me thnx" <br>  <br>  It makes me so mad. Its lazy, often Illegal, and very immature.|`|e4b32e33b8c5f290f2ac40c695f487f2aa	Dunno.  I don't bother to answer those questions.  Although it is pretty easy to get sheet music for classical composers for free, legally|`|I3CNklLKaa	Yes - a Mr Brian McTavish of 56 Glenshee Drive, Paisly, Glagow gets very cross indeed about it.|`|jbAr62ybaa	I generally just ignore such requests.  But since you've raised the question, just for the heck of it, I googled it - only typed in the three words: "free sheet music", and look what came up1<br>  <br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?fr=ush_mailm&ei=UTF-8&p=free+sheet+music">http://search.yahoo.com/search?fr=ush_ma...</a><br>  <br>       And in all honesty, I can't claim to be exhausted from the effort.<br>  <br>                                                     Alberich|`|vsy4QMHMaa	The ones that are in the public domain, I don't mind so much. Yes, I'd much rather have a bound printed work from a publisher, but half (or more) of that business is also on-line as a pay and download now too.<br>  <br>  <edit><br>  Free PD down loadable sheet music is a godsend when looking for music that sells in insufficient quantities to make it viable for publishers to print ... probably less of an issue in the digital world, than it was in the lead type and presses world ... just a thought<br>  </edit><br>  <br>  It is most bothersome, though, when people ask here first _before_ doing any research and assume that we will point them to the right source. Then everyone gets thumbs-down for suggesting that illegal activities are, well, illegal.<br>  <br>  ... I find it interesting that one of my answers was removed (probably reported by PPCC) about transcribing a piece for a Bb instrument. While the piece was one of the loathsome ones commonly asked about, the information about transposition, and transposing instruments certainly qualified as a topic of interest.|`|xcPzZvsraa	I would imagine it would all depend on what piece they were asking about in the first place?<br>  Of course hell yes if,as Malcolm points out,it's the usual infernal choices like Bella's Lullaby etc etc but if they were asking lets say for free sheet music for Beethoven's Tempest then I'd be rather delighted!<br>  I wouldn't even be particularly vexed if it was only for the usual Moonlight & Fur Therese choices as long as it's Beethoven or any other proper composer for that matter.<br>  Besides from my understanding there are websites you can join in which you can access free printable classical sheet music.|`|rNqF4gIVaa	I'm right there with you Doc.<br>  It seems over half the questions we are getting these days are requests for sheet music, which:<br>  a) Is still undercopyright<br>  b) Not classical music by any stretch of the imagination.<br>  c)  are for Bella's damned lullaby.<br>  d) the askers want you to do their searching for them (because I assume they are incapable or too lazy to do for themselves.).<br>  <br>  Need I continue?|`|ThKkn5fKaa	I'm far more annoyed by the illegal downloading of music.  This is probably incredibly hypocritical of me since publishers and musicians are not all that different, but when a piece is public domain, I really don't have too much of an issue with it.  People spend their own time and effort to notate music that the law says they are allowed to use, so if they want to make it available, then so be it.<br>  <br>  We need to remember that there is another side to this though.  Publishers might lose money to public domain music, but when there is more music made available to new and curious future musicians, that has to be a good thing.  The fact that some music can legally be obtained for free allows more people to be introduced to classical music at an early age, which will eventually lead to more sales for publishers.  I don't know of any serious musician who uses downloaded public domain music for performances or serious study.  Nearly everyone goes for the real published and edited stuff once it comes time to really learn a piece of music.  That obviously translates into sales for the publishers, but the more important factor here is that a greater number of people will be introduced to art music.|`|qWNdhGVXaa	I haven't found any site with FREE sheet music, so yes.  It doesn't exist

0vlm2OZcaa	It's a band that has to be found like a scavenger hunt with clues.|`|TLCo2bU7aa	yes it's a band, it was in the movie|`|Xwx8mUnYaa	It's a band in the movie that just does random concerts. Its meant as a surprise , mybe to get more fans, i dunno|`|r8ST3cFIaa	Where's fluffy is a band in the movie
5g0zCTqMaa	Wow good question definetly a toss-up between Make Yourself and Morning View and I'd have to say Morning View but Make Yourself is right there. My favorite song has got to be Wish You Were Here it is such a great summer song and it always reminds me of summer and the beach both of which I love.|`|yRE2HDr3aa	The only Incubus album I like is S.C.I.E.N.C.E.<br>  <br>  I liked the hidden track and Magic Medicine.|`|1UkTem4Waa	Toss up between Morning View and Make Yourself. <br>  <br>  My favorite song is definitely The Warmth|`|64qRgtrBaa	I agree that it's a toss-up between "Make Yourself" and "Morning View."  They both remind me of summer time, going to the beach, having pool parties, ect. Both albums are solid from beginning to end. Picking a favorite song is hard, but one that comes to mind is "Pistola," which was actually on A Crow Left Of The Murder.|`|f3x2q0iDaa	My favorite album is Morning View and Make Yourself<br>  My favorite song is Echo|`|fvIXGXopaa	Morning View was an awesome album.  I also liked Make Yourself but not as much. Favorite song would have to be Just  A Phase.

d3e50521e19f17b9f2f8250119424a60aa	I suppose, though the only network that would pick it up is C-SPAN.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	i could make a tv show out of my life. but not all the times. And it would have  to be on cable though. But then again i think anybody single and in college with a car could make a reality show on their life. At least up where i live. Theres nothing to do but go to school, drink, have sex and work.|`|196b73911133c4d75053bfa6ae887857aa	Yeah, for a million bucks I'd do it.

dff02092af2c2cb3aef56ed17c602327aa	I love their songs <br>  especially "sara beth"<br>  <br>  the music video for that song is just touching<br>  Yes the lead singer does have a bit of a girlish voice, but I don't mind it.<br>  <br>  Maybe that's because i love that genre of music (country)<br>  <br>  I love their music because, I feel, it comes from the heart. When you look at the music videos the lead sing (i think) sings the songs with passion and emotion. Kind of like how Gerard Way does.|`|8WT4gqcdaa	i never used to think the lead singer (Gary Levox) had a whiny voice, i just thought he could go higher than other guys.  and that is one of the reasons i like the band so much. because it's easy for me-as a girl-to sing along to.  i like their lyrics. and i like their harmony. and i think their songs are catchy.<br>  i've never thought of them as a boy band... they don't dance around on stage.|`|WA8feS8taa	They're really good, they have a song for everything really, it's great. I love them because of their lyrics and their music in general is just really good.|`|WO1JyRRgaa	I really like Rascal Flatts and their music. I think they have great songs and sing them well. Their songs have lots of meaning in them, that is why I like them.|`|Aoj0croZaa	I luv the lyrics, seems they have a song for every occasion!!!|`|LqlHpiOraa	they are not my taylor swift but i still think they are good|`|7cei5ifNaa	Can u sing better ??|`|AA11306089	I used to love them, then one day  I heard them on the radio and couldn't stand them. They are killing country music.. They're mixing the genres too much.. putting pop in my country. I hate it.|`|5LAFteSAaa	i think the rascal flatts are some of the biggest faggots in country music. there songs are are really gay and i think they are a disgrace to the look of a country singer. they all might actually be gay, idk. not a fan at all.  they are more of a girly band. idk many guys who are big fans.|`|duLdw1csaa	Love RF, lyrics of the songs, their harmonies, and I personally like Gary's voice. I saw them in concert last year and it was the best live show I have ever seen. They are great showmen, and good guys.|`|2Ys6pUg9aa	I love Rascal Flatts.They are my favorite band besides The Fray. Their songs are amazing and I think his voice fits. I know a lot of people don't like his voice, but i do.|`|W1XZ4kAVaa	i love Rascal Flatts i want to go to one of their concerts

Between the Buried and Me mixes some great screaming with some really melodic clean vocals, check them out, esp songs like Mordecai/Alaska (more brutal, less singing) and Sun of Nothing (lots of melodic parts).<br>  <br>  edit: opeth is sick! i definitely second them!|`|3005d3b9180d1ef915398a770d0e19f2aa	Opeth - Mikael Akefeldt (sp?) is a great singer going from death growls to clean vocals flawlessly<br>  <br>  I would recommend the album Damnation - all clean vocals - a beautiful album!|`|wQpdot1Raa	Boltdown<br>  <br>  ^^  wtf 3OH!3 isn't heavy metal you fool!|`|eurqDxKCaa	GodSmack.|`|mWv1Ql6vaa	Well, I really like Slipknot, but you have heard of them. Have you ever listened to Killswitch Engage? Their singer is amazing. Also Five Finger Death Punch, you might like them.|`|mKtnY4Lhaa	black dahlia murder, goatwhore, nechrophagist, sepultura, job for a cowboy, napalm death, and maybe meshuggah the list goes on thats jsut a few i can think of|`|6rvzeOsqaa	Arch Enemy (female death metal vocalist)<br>  <br>  In Flames<br>  <br>  and my favourite - <br>  <br>  The Haunted (these guys are awesome)|`|tUxm2YYKaa	Try Trivium... Chelsea Grin...|`|0vm66wlcaa	Some good Metalcore (mixture of screaming and singing)<br>  - All That Remains [The album 'The Fall of Ideals']<br>  - Machinemade God<br>  - Trivium<br>  <br>  Post-Hardcore (mixture of screaming and singing, but less heavy than metalcore)<br>  - Every Time I Die<br>  <br>  Some others:<br>  Pantera<br>  Valient Thorr<br>  <br>  I would suggest Bang Camaro too. They have approximately 17 singers. I would suggest their first album, Bang Camaro, if you like awesome guitar riffs. I would suggest their second album, Bang Camaro II, if you are more focused on lyrics/vocals.
4qCSPz27aa	She is already a hit here in the US. I think she will be accepted there. She has  great voice. She is young (19), so she has a lot of time to get even better!<br>  <br>  Here's is one of her recent songs "Love Story" which is a big hit here:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlbB7qt6v_0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlbB7qt6v...</a>|`|fboC1N7gaa	She's already a huge hit in the US.  I really like her.  Check out her website at www.myspace.com/taylorswift and <a href="http://taylorswift.com/" rel="nofollow">http://taylorswift.com/</a>|`|4c874e283dd92b6b16b07e3f459300f8aa	She is some what of a unattractive girl who sings horribly.Hopefully you fine folk in the UK never has to be tortured by being forced to listen to her like we are here in the US.|`|xE6nrLbfaa	sofia, I just went to the site and heard her singing. I liked what I heard, yep, I like her!<br>  <br>  Did someone say she was ugly?  I don't think so!<br>  <br>  No,  someone said she was unattractive, again, I don't think so.|`|QE0U6iPKaa	Yes the UK will take to country music...We have taken to country music for years ...Where have you been..???..I saw this lady on breakfast television the other morning in the UK..She has a beautiful voice and I am sure she will take off in the UK...|`|HWkXDSqkaa	Shes a huge hit here.<br>  I wouldn't doubt the UK will accept her.|`|OwznjQ9daa	An amazing singer! you should go to her concert! =]|`|eeKlogL4aa	Her first song released in the UK is "Love Story" and that isn't very country-sounding so I think the UK may take to that. I think she will divide opinions in the UK. I don't know many bands/singers who sang country to break it in the UK.|`|90Gf3ajvaa	Yh, I've been listening to her for a few months. Shes not bad. I'm not sure if a country singer could break it here though. <br>  I've been hearing her song 'love story' around. I don't know if it was a hit|`|8WT4gqcdaa	she will take over the world.<br>  haha, i'm joking.
hfigZbx5aa	I agree with Aqua... Deja Vu that you can't place that often is not "psychic". If you get "Deja vu" and then remember "oh yeah, I dreamed this earlier", that's a premonition lived. But deja vu..... that's a whole different thing. If it developes sometimes into "Jamais vu" then that's another warning sign. Jamais vu is when you are in a place you're in all the time and it's like you've never been there before. IE- you live in the same house for ten years and you get out of bed and don't recognise the possessions or rooms and don't know where the restroom or kitchen are only to remember a couple minutes later... These can happen with epilepsy. If you're a teenager, you could be developing JAE (Jouvenile Absence Epilepsy) which is a lot like CAE (childhood) but develops later, obviously.. can't tell you how it feels different, I've had "blank-outs" and automatisms my whole life as far as I can remember. But you should go to a neurologist. <br>  <br>  Just ask yourself-<br>  What exactly happened before, during, and after the event? <br>  Did you lose consciousness? (You do NOT always lose consciousness, but you can have vagueness or amnesia)<br>  Were you confused before or after the event? <br>  Did any parts of your body shake? If so, for how long, and in what way? <br>  Did you bite your tongue or lose control of any body function? <br>  How long did it last? <br>  Did you have any unusual feelings, sensations, or emotions before the event? <br>  Do you have any other symptoms at all, even apparently unrelated? <br>  Had you taken any alcohol, medicines, or street drugs before the event? <br>  Has anything like this ever happened before? <br>  Does anyone in the family have epilepsy? <br>  Have you had any head injuries or illnesses affecting your brain in the past? <br>  Did you feel well before the event, or did you feel poorly, light headed, hot, or distressed? <br>  Can you think of anything to explain what happened?<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't take this to mean you can't have a gift too... Intuition is a powerful thing and you should NOT quit listening to it. Try to figure out what triggers these things to happen and meditate, try to force yourself to feel the predictions. Once you know how your mind works, you can tap into your own intuition. However, if it's something big, your skills don't have to be honed. I decided to change my flight plans after a nightmare about a crash. I thought I was being paranoid until I was watching the news and getting ready to go with my old ticket to exchange it and the news flashed on with a breaking story- the plane I was going to be on had crashed. No survivors. Another friend had a bad feeling about going to work one night and she still went. Someone robbed it and she was shot execution style. <br>  Moral- if you feel your gut is telling you something LISTEN! I don't necessarily think I'm "psychic" but I think every person has some capability to perceive things beyond their understanding to different extents.|`|fVuuIyu2aa	I don't know that much about psychics but I do believe that the mind is a powerful thing and that sometimes it is possible for you to "sense" things that are going to happen, maybe it is intuition or instinct. About the dream thing, it could either be that you fell asleep thinking about something and that's why you dreamt about it or it is also possible that maybe you sleep-walk and don't even know it and that's why you feel like you've seen text messages in your dreams because maybe you glanced at your phone while you were asleep. I think that's happened to me before.|`|821bd483afcea62cd9c3a4d1aa91236caa	i'm not going to say that i think you are full blown psychic.. i think you probably have some sort of level of it.<br>  psychics do exist...<br>  i do not think i am a full blown psychic, but i know what you mean, i have thoughts in my head about somethings, and then about 2 hours later it comes true. its kind of mind blowing, if you know what i mean..<br>  i can't tell you if you're psychic or not, that is something you have to ask yourself.|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	More psychic than most of the psychics on here already.

Otherwise, I'd keep your day job.|`|32P3hG0Laa	You certainly sound very intuitive, and you seem to have a gift. You may want to try and meditate a couple of times a week. Or you may want to keep track of all your successful impressions in a notebook, so you can get an idea of how often you sense these things...<br>  <br>  Like any talent or skill, practicing can improve your abilities.|`|B7WIZdglaa	If your having deja vu alot... you should honestly see a doctor. Deja vu is basically a small seizure in a sense. There are a ton of electrons in your brains firing up, and although it's nothing dangerous... if it happens alot, then I heard you should see a doctor. Just be careful.

You are extremely good at seeing through people's superficiality, and you are very intelligent. <br>  <br>  Moon in Capricorn- emotionally, you are cold and hard. you react to your emotions by being unemotional. You care about money and success greatly. You are a hard worker, but you need to learn to be more approachable and warm. <br>  <br>  Leo Rising- People see you as a person who loves to be the center of attention. You appear to be charming and have many friends. This is how others see you, not necessarily how you are. Rising sign is the "mask" you wear

You can pay me a billion dollars and I would never do HALF of what they did.|`|vRxx6Oegaa	In the masterful modern work 2girls1cup, the feminist genre is reexamined through a series of reversals of expectations. The prevalent ideologies of our culture are filtered through the lens of the pornographic genre - and, in true modern form - the work tends to raise more questions than it answers.<br>  <br>  The opening image, that of the stenciled "MFX 1209" suggests a confusing misunderstanding - the 1209 seems as some sort of date, yet the aesthetic of the number lends itself to a futuristic association. This blurring of past and future, mixed with the confusion of the assumed-to-be acronym primes the audience for the confusion to come.<br>  <br>  The first image with the two primary characters (who, for the sake of this reading, I will consider to be the "2girls" that are referred to in the title) is seemingly innocuous - the cross-cultural, lesbian interaction defines the equal-rights (both feminine and racial) within the genre of pornography.<br>  <br>  The gentle background music lulls the audience to sleep, and the timely but gradual change into the next shot at :11 goes by largely unnoticed by the audience. The eyes are immediately drawn to the "Cup" (also presumed to be that mentioned in the title), the inversion of the phallus and perhaps one of the most overarcing symbols for feminine spirituality and sexuality in antiquity.<br>  <br>  The gentle piano concerto will continue as the cup is suddenly and ironically filled with a steaming shot of fecal matter from the anus of our primary character. In this way, the masculinist, derogatory nature of the pornographic genre returns in a surprising, explosive manner. The fecal matter "penetrates" the sacred chalice, which raises a number of interesting questions. Many of these questions pertains to lesbian sexuality - is womanly love possible without the masculine grotesque? Is the pornographic genre doomed to exist within the realm of humiliating acts, even when the only participants are an innocuous 2 girls, and 1 cup? The later image of the two characters attempting to kiss through the feces of the masculine grotesque (as well as the literal feces) will only support this theme.<br>  <br>  The excited but hesitant tonguing suggests a sort of apprehension on the part of the lead characters, but by :25, any hope for redemption has been lost. This transition from playful tonguing to full fecal consumption happens as suddenly as the transition to the original defecatory act - why do these central thematic moments happen offstage? There is no dramatic dialogue, neither character gives voice to the greater internal struggles that surely must precede the decision to consume another's feces. This central thematic crux is internalized in both the characters, and thus is obscured from the audience's perception as well.<br>  <br>  This notion of blurring will evolve into a diluting and contamination of sorts by :40, where the vomit of disgust begins to obscure even the original thematic feces of the work. It is worth noting that the secondary character does not vomit into the cup (while our original character does), yet vomits directly onto the other woman. This further develops the motif of the masculine invading lesbian relationships - does one woman have a monopoly on the feminine cup, while the other woman becomes masculine, and begins to fill the role of the oppressor as she symbolically vomits down onto the kneeling lover? Even this notion isn't safe from the postmodern genre-confusion, as the roles are reversed and the other's mouth is vomited into in return.<br>  <br>  It is hard to read this work in any constructive manner, as evidenced by the final image of the piece. The characters present themselves to the audience, effectively breaking the fourth wall. The difficulties of untangling the thematic mess of the genre to find sentence are reflected in the physical mess on the characters faces. Hopefully, with further examination and daring works such as 2girls1cup, we will be able to break free of many of these domineering and ultimately oppressing ideological structures which are maintained by societal forces, genre restrictions, and our own perceptions of reality.|`|cn0ALwwLaa	Because people like to watch TV to see this stuff.

She shook it, held it overhead, and said, "I bet I know what it is. Some flowers." "That's right" the boy said, "but how did you know?" "Oh, just a wild guess," she said. <br>  <br>  The next pupil was the candy shop owner's daughter. The teacher held her gift overhead, shook it, and said, "I bet I can guess what it is. A box of sweets." "That's right, but how did you know?" asked the girl. "Oh, just a wild guess," said the teacher. <br>  <br>  The next gift was from the son of the liquor store owner. The teacher held the package overhead, but it was leaking. She touched a drop of the leakage with her finger and touched it to her tongue. "Is it wine?" she asked. "No," the boy replied, with some excitement. <br>  <br>  The teacher repeated the process, taking a larger drop of the leakage to her tongue. "Is it champagne?" she asked. "No," the boy replied, with more excitement. The teacher took one more taste before declaring, "I give up, what is it?"

That Tuesday, he goes to the cemetery and waits for the nun. Right on schedule, the nun shows up.

"I am God, I have heard your prayers and I will answer them but you must have sex with me first," he says. <br>  <br>  The nun agrees but asks for anal sex so she might keep her virginity.

You have to watch the rest of the seasons!!!|`|Wc1z4Kvdaa	This is the 5th season of Lost. Up to now, we still don't know what the black smoke monster really is.

The Black smoke is supposed to be some sort of poltergeist that keeps people from leaving the Island.<br>  <br>  BEST ANSWER!?!?!|`|ibiO4VEQaa	there's going to be 6 season 5 has been going for a month.<br>  The monster can be blocked, and summoned by Ben, but you don't know how yet.<br>  It's been revealed it's some kind of security system for The Temple, another DHARMA station, that is mentioned in Season 4 a breifly seen in Season 5 so far.|`|fd3969820c20a4244842f433a5e6eee6aa	There are 5 seasons.

0vlm2OZcaa	It is not known but it is described as an ancient, guttural language.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  What language do the vampires speak?<br>  <br>  There has been much discussion about possible languages on which the vampires' language may have been based. Because of what some describe as a "guttural" aspect to the vampires' speech, various languages in the Slavic, Germanic, and Scandinavian tongues have been suggested. Others have noticed clicks in the speech and have suggested Native American, tribal, or Australian aboriginal languages. Because the vampires' language in the comic series was described as an "ancient unknown" language, some have suggested ancient Egyptian, Celtic, or Mayan. Even fictional languages such as Klingon, Wookie, or the raptors in Jurassic Park have been proffered. However, in a first screening Q-A interview, director David Slade admits that it is a purely fictional language designed by himself, Danny Huston (who played the lead vampire), and a linguist. They did not base it on human speech at all but meant for it to be animalistic in nature, based on sounds made while feeding, eating, and expressing hatred.|`|Cx9pdQ1Zaa	vampires comes from Transylvania...so I think it is a sort of imitation made by cry and words...I study latin so I m sure that is not latin|`|vCidaEbCaa	latin

They can mostly eat and eat and not gain an ounce ~ they love food to an art and revere it as such, but will binge on junk too ~ never once forgetting their palates...oh sooooooo gourmet! I know of FOUR Taurus who have become chefs. They adore fine food....so indulgent....strangely they simply love being fed and watered more so than anyone else. They willprepare an amazing meal and then stash the chips, licorice and truffles...they have a taste for life through a layering of the senses.

Apparently, those ruled by Venus (Taurus and Libra) tend to have a significantly higher sweet tooth. ^.^ <br>  <br>  <br>  Me being a Capricorn, I don't really eat a lot at all.

Q5qpMLOVaa	Yep. 87$.<br>  <br>  They couldn't do anything about it because it was simply too late. Had payed through paypal, and the money was gone. Probably near 50 users got ripped by that seller. When I made the purchase, the user had a good record...<br>  <br>  I still use Ebay though.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	My account was compromised.. someone ran up 600 dollars with of ebay fee's and put my paypal account into the negative 1,600...they also were able to jack my bank account. <br>  <br>  Ebay and paypal both refuse to investigate and if I want to have it fixed I have to pay a lawyer.<br>  <br>  Ebay and paypal has sent me into collections over it and I still refuse to pay it.<br>  <br>  Ebay and Paypal are scams.<br>  <br>  No I don't use them anymore. I use to love it when they first came out and I even worked for two different ebay consignement shops and after seeing alot of the "behind the scene's" I might as well be out selling hot parts at the flea market.<br>  <br>  Horrible Horrible Horrible!!<br>  <br>  I can't wait for ebay to crash!|`|2k8TEiRtaa	No, But when you buy something and it does not arrive or it is not what you expected, by paying through Paypal, you can ask for a refund or put a claim on the item through Paypal. If you just pay with a credit card , you can possibly get burned.|`|lUO6wLGAaa	I've been both a buyer and seller, and have never had a problem.  I admit that I may be just lucky.  But I do check feedback ratings, and I try to buy from sellers who obviously put some effort into their description and photography.  I mean, if the description is full of misspelled words, and the photo is blurry, what are the chances of the item being perfect?|`|AA11025703	Sure I've been "burned" by eBay, I think most long time users have been.<br>  <br>  I've lost out TONS of times.  But I think, in my case, the amount of money I've saved outweighs the amount lost.|`|YWQdsoOMaa	No and yes I still use ebay.|`|d23F89ECaa	Well kind of.  I purchased a soldering iron and burnt my thumb with it.<br>  <br>  But, <br>  <br>  in terms of your issue, I have had one problem being that I purchased a belt buckle.  When receiving the item in the mail, it was broken.  The seller with no questions asked sent me a new one.  I even got to keep the broken one.  Which is why I got the soldering iron :)|`|59Rd381caa	No. I haven't ordered too much off of there except for 1 video game, and an iPod case.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You really do need to look at the feedback and read some of it. I would buy anything if it were 98% or lower. Usually I never look for anything unless it's 100% positive feedback.|`|RSv2E2KNaa	Nope. I used to use ebay but not now.|`|cBxG0BbZaa	I have never been "burned"...........but if i did i would stop using ebay|`|4Vk8H69laa	No.|`|AA10745377	no|`|7769bb12a9339d6add718a4ad2b9363caa	never ussed it, too scared of this happening....sorry it happended to u...maybe u can stop charge or something.|`|J3XYn718aa	Yep.

Usually only when I'm having a bad day and a complete stereotype starts irritating me.|`|FNwxcBPpaa	No I haven't. I wasn't aware I was suppose too.|`|aKBqMLuhaa	Probably. I grew up using the word colored for any one who had any color to their skin. Which still pretty much makes sence to me, since I'm so friggin white my skin is nearly transparent. And I have called some people ******* and crackers, (and canooks). Before I get bombarded with nasty emails and td's please understand that its mostly white Assholes that I have called this, and its based on their personality not race. Its based on the context of a cracker/****** being a degenerate dick head. Which we have in all races. BTW: I picked this up from my black and other colored friends. A person of any color can be a ****** or a cracker IMHO.<br>  <br>  I try my best to be politically correct but to be honest, political correctness is over rated and nearly impossible to over come. I personally think people are to easily offended these days by taking things out of context.<br>  Ex: I work with (and care deeply for) mentally retarded people... yet I'm not suppose to call them retarded..... now THAT to me is retarded! They have 'Mental Retardation" as thier official diagnosis, and yet I can not say it? The word retarded has been deemed as nonacceptable in any context and yet if you look it up in the dictionary it does not mean "a dumb person" (like many would like to think it does); but it means to be stunted..... which is what MR (that's the PC term we mental health workers now use) is in the first place.<br>  There is a reason that the American Association on Mental Retardation refuses to change its name... because there should be no shame attatched to the name of a real diagnosis. We (AAMR and I) feel that 'typical' people don't feel comfortable around retarded people and therefor they mask the issue that the person is retarded. Its just stupid that we put so much emphasis on individual words and not the context in which they are stated.<br>  <br>  IMHO Words should only hurt when they are said in a derogetory and demeaning manner<br>  Ok bring on the TD's. At least I'm honest.<br>  <br>  *UGh! See-  they'll let me write asshole but I can't write n*gg*r!|`|p03Jc7eHaa	at times but not in a hateful way|`|YBQvzEhGaa	No I don't.

p4kbPcOjaa	Ichabod Crane will have to brave the nearby woods to win the heart of Katrina Van Tassel, even though several decapitated bodies have been found. And then the legend of the axe wielding headless horsemen come together to make this movie. Written by Chris Barker <br>  <br>  In the early United States of America, young policeman Ichabod Crane is sent to from New York to the fledgling settlement of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of ghoulish murders. On his arrival, the town council informs him that the three victims were killed in open ground, and the heads had disappeared - taken by a headless ghost that is supposedly responsible. Ichabod is unconvinced of this, but learns more about the ghostly horseman - it is the ghost of a Hessian sent by the British during the revolutionary war, and he was caught by redcoats and decapitated with his own sword. When Ichabod sees the ghost kill one of the town council members, his skepticism evaporates - and he soon discovers that the horseman's ghost has an unholy connection to Balthus Van Tassel, a wealthy farmer - and whose daughter Ichabod is falling in love with... Written by Derek O'Cain <br>  <br>  1799: Ichabod Crane is a constable from New York who is most concerned with all the new scientific gadgets that will allow him to do his job better. However, he is quite squeamish about his latest assignment: traveling to the town of Sleepy Hollow, where there have been a series of murders involving people whose heads have been cut off. The locals believe it is the work of the legendary Headless Horseman. Ichabod does not believe this, but with the help of the fair Katrina Van Tassel and the young son of one of the victims, he uncovers some very interesting evidence that would suggest otherwise. Written by Tommy Peter <br>  <br>  Constable Ichabod Crane of the New York police arrives in the small village of Sleepy Hollow in 1799 to solve a mystery of murders. With all the victims found with their heads missing, everybody in Sleepy Hollow is talking about the ghost of the "headless horseman" who is out in the woods seeking revenge for his murder many years ago. Crane, believing only in logic, refuses to believe the public's theory about the horseman and begins his investigations, only to find his faith shattered when he himself encounters the headless horseman. A magical tale of sense against myth. Written by Chris Makrozahopoulos {makzax@hotmail.com} <br>  <br>  After the head of a Hessian horseman is stolen, the horseman returns from hell to take the heads of the people of Sleepy Hallow until its own is returned. Constable Ichabod Crane is called in to investigate three murders. Through his investigation he learns of the legend of the Headless Horseman, but he doesn't believe that the stories are true...until the horseman takes off the head of one of the elders right in front of his very eyes. Now he must race to find out the origins of the horseman in order to send him back to his grave for good. But the question remains...if the head was stolen once, how safe is it?

3UL23OlVaa	My favorite is Ian vs Allan (Jurassic Park) -- Alan was the winner though Ellie Sattler didn't end up with either of them, she remained close to Alan. On Han vs Luke (Star Wars) -- I'd say Luke is the winner but Leia wouldn't marry her relative. On Sawyer vs Jack (Lost) -- No clear winner at this time. Kate is confusing.|`|4q2LISKJaa	FaceOff|`|dsf5hGGnaa	Sawyer and Jack is a pretty good one I just love Sawyer! and I love how unglued Jack gets over everything haha|`|71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	Gone With The Wind<br>  Rhett Butler vs. Ashley Wilkes
jCHcjJ9Baa	Collen had better be careful she is no match for Victor even with Jack in the background.  She will be a thorn in his side for abit but he will chew her up and spit her out.<br>  Ashley will be mad when she finds out that Jackie instigated the scenario but I suspect that she already knows that|`|uVwPykXlaa	she will be devastated that his bro threw her under the bus and victor dd the same.<br>  am sure the whole og genoa city is waiting to say.WE TOLD U SO.<br>  she might end up leaving the show for good or unemployed n living in the famous athletic club.<br>  seems every reject ends up there.<br>  they shuld call it the rejects club|`|4kuWOZowaa	I liked this...Its Awesome that Colleen Standing up to victor..somebody should.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I think Victor will handle her. & When he knows Jack is behind it. he won't be happy.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	If Colleen was doing all of that on her own, bravo, but l'm getting tired of Jack pulling her strings and her just going along with it. Victor will deal with this in his usual way l guess.<br>  Because Ashley had accepted the seat and l'm sure she's pissed with Brad for not leaving Abby's inheritance in her care and when she finds out that Jack set up Colleen to do that, she's going to flip!|`|qAoM2Jp5aa	I think Victor is going to handle it like he always does...with revenge!  I like how Collen talks to him, its great!
KNWhomNkaa	Sharon is playing Nick and Jack.<br>  She likes how the two of then are running to her every need.<br>  She is not the only one that is hurting right now because of <br>  Brad`s passing.She should get on with her life.<br>  She has a son to think of.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I guess they are taking her character to a low. I didn't feel sorry for her.|`|4kuWOZowaa	Nah...i like them showing sharons whorish true colors.|`|uVwPykXlaa	she cant be the perfect one.<br>  let her be like ol of them....<br>  tramps...lool|`|3pqWRz71aa	I am so sorry for her. She is one of my favourite characters in that show. I think there should be some adjustment in the script.|`|2uZRYZ1Naa	i think she needs to get a grip! they should do SOMETHING with her besides boo-hoo, im sharon and i luv nick, blah blah blah....|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Well Sharon's character has never been of the best, she's always having sex somewhere and then crying and whining all over town after. Sharon always wants to do what pleases her at the moment then try to guilt other people into feeling sorry for her, thing is they do!|`|qAoM2Jp5aa	Yes they are! I hate it! Things need to start looking up for her...I think it all started when Cassy died, everything slowly started going down hill for her...  :(
EPPb5pRBaa	I guess, he wants a baby so bad & he is in denial.|`|2uZRYZ1Naa	i think he should have talked more with Billy and made a decision with him. Cane would give the baby a better life, but Billy needs to man up and face the diapers...lol|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Cane is not taking this crap from Billy/Chloe. He already feels slighted since Jill gave Billy the post at Jabot and he's had enough of Billy's nonchallant behavior so, l think he did that for spite but hey, he's entitled to be pissed about the whole thing!|`|uVwPykXlaa	i hate him 4 that,he shuld move on.<br>  he was dumb not to really find out if he was the dad.<br>  now hes after divorcing chloe,we dnt blame him but gosh asking for shared custody of lil booga...plizzz|`|b95adf9df97c91be72d1af840c313197aa	i guess he thinks a signature on paper makes his the daddy, but time and DNA tests will lead to another birth certificate to be issued....<br>  <br>  i can't tell you how many men in his place would have celebrated and taken offf running the other way....but maybe, he can be the godfather ;)|`|mIUjnujeaa	He loves the baby and if he signed even having the inkling its Billy's he would have the rights to the baby along with being married to its mother. It is going to make it harder for Billy to get her now.|`|4kuWOZowaa	No..but his whole obsession with it do seems sorta creepy. but it is good that he stepping up but billy stepped up to.|`|VAp5ICaBaa	I hate Cane
cNdkNYKOaa	my cousin (mom's sister's daughter) and i look like siblings<br>  most mistake her for my little sister<br>  i am the oldest of this generation of family members<br>  i was there to see my aunt pregnant, so i know she was not my mom's child<br>  my mom was fixed by then, she had her tubes tied after my little brother was born|`|rlvrgwWvaa	Well, if you look like your moms sibling, that means that your grandparent carried the genetic and your mom just didn't get that gene. Like if you and your uncle both have big noses, but your mom doesn't, then it means that you grandparents (very far back even) carried the gene. It does not have to show up in them either.|`|CXgPkEPFaa	yeah easy|`|TsmqhvZHaa	what a complicated question|`|AA11552865	I think so too. I look alot like  my dad and my sister looks like my mum and my mums sister. I also have cousins who look similar to various blood-related aunts and uncles.<br>  <br>  But i also know people who look nothing like their parents.|`|zwi5vdYuaa	well my sister looks like my mams sister sooo yea it is possible|`|W0J5IhSPaa	yeah i think so because they are your family and they might have gotten the same traits or looks. it runs in genes|`|mGvpcZrFaa	Sure I think so.|`|mSt1LGfjaa	i think my kids look like my side of the family,, and i can see me in them too,,certain ways they move .act,,and expressions they make its amazing how we all look alike,,|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	For sure it is. It`s quite common.   Family `traits` (facial and characteristics)  can reappear after many generations.
MRoF4VO3aa	Although not directly the same as Memento, I would recommend:<br>  <br>  The Lookout -- it's about a young man who suffers memory loss, and who is preyed upon by a group of guys wanting to rob the bank that he works at.<br>  <br>  Donnie Darko -- this movie revolves around an alternate tangent universe which is doomed to make the real world non-existent.<br>  <br>  The Usual Suspects -- it's regarded as having one of the best twist endings of all time.  Kevin Spacey is amazing in this movie.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	I'm not sure what that movies about but if you're looking for a good mystery suspense with a great ending kind of twisting try: hide and seek (dekota fanning), fracture (ryan gossling), and the number 23 (jim carry).  These are a few of my favorites that pop into my head that have a great ending/twist!!|`|QEqGukjZaa	well not same story..but some of the same effects..of going back in time..<br>  <br>  *Before the Devil Knows Your Dead*<br>  *Vantage Point*<br>  *The Air I Breathe*|`|b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	The first movie by director Christopher Nolan is good, The Following, it's about a writer that likes watching people. Eventually he begins following them how, but the rule was to never follow the same person twice, never follow women after dark and something else I forget. He was following a man that realized it, the man was a house burglar and they went to a house together. They were interested in the personal mementos of the people that lived there to pry into their lives, but they also got involved with a woman that had been dating a dangerous mobster. He gets in trouble when he breaks a rule for the first time. Very interesting and independent, like Memento, I'd tell you it was black and white but then you might not want to see it... oops. Aha doesn't bother me anyway you might not mind. Peace|`|tLI94qWNaa	The mechanist <br>  He was a quiet man <br>  A scanner darkly<br>  Vanilla Sky <br>  Irreversible<br>  Identity<br>  Cube

That's just something you would NOT be able to lie about.

The girl is dying of cancer and for that reason alone at least deserves sympathy. The thing that really does pee me off though is how Max Clifford has got the media in a feeding frenzy about it.  <br>  <br>  I find it a sad inditement of our society that a young lass of little education, zero talent, a foul mouth and racist viewpoint makes full front page news in national newspapers due to her affliction. To me these media crocodile tears demean every other young cancer patient in the country whose illness and final passing will go un-commented upon by anyone but their loved ones.<br>  <br>  That the media circus are likely to fork out a million quid for this 'romantic' last minute wedding between Jade and her convicted criminal boyfriend is a farce beyond belief.  You would not want to live next door to this couple so why would you want to see their nuptials?<br>  <br>  There has been precious little in the way of dignity in Jades life to date and i find it sad that she does not choose to spent her final weeks quietly surrounded by her family in a dignified manner, rather than in full view of the whole population.|`|6xiwiiIzaa	Not at all , Jade is very ill and only has weeks to live , i think the :Whore :Bit ,, is a bit out of order Ok ,

They may occasionally have little accidents.<br>  1.  Length.....My brother can just about get the National Anthem out except for the last couple of bars.<br>  2.  Stinkiness.....Even the dogs will leave the room.<br>  3.

TX8mHpqzaa	the problem is your laptop speakers more than likey..i had the same problem recording my demo album..so i went to best buy and bought some top-of-the-line speakers and i fell in love with them..you don't have to buy pricey ones but just get a higher grade or adjust your sound when recording, that will also help improve your sound...btw good luck..i don't know what it is your working on but good luck and if you ever have any questions, feel free to email me...<br>  <br>  volcomchick15@yahoo.com|`|geih5vR8aa	Dude, you said it in your post... You installed a good sound card and everything sounds great. Then when you take it out, the sound sucks. I don't know how you can't put two and two together here. Your computer needs that sound card to make everything sound good, whether you're recording something on it, or simply playing it back. When you take the soundcard out, your computer reverts back to your old sound card, and it will make everything sound bad. PLUS, laptops have crappy speakers anyways.  <br>  <br>  Record studios have expensive equipment to record on. That's all they can control. The quality of the recording. They can't control whether or not people are going to listen to music through a good stereo, or piece of crap laptop speaker.<br>  <br>  You're going to have to leave that sound card plugged in, to get the best sound quality. I suggest getting some monitors or external speakers for your laptop as well. <br>  <br>  Also, if you're going to be recording guitars, or vocals or anything like that, you're going to need quality mic's, and in order to use those mic's, you're going to need an interface to plug them into. They have decent priced USB interfaces available for recording, but those interfaces usually bypass that nice sound card you just got... that doesn't mean you don't need the sound card, because when you play your music back on iTunes or something else, your going to need that external sound card.

YHu0TUxdaa	They eat the weaker pokemon they beat!|`|HLqzrBNmaa	They eat themselves.|`|I2iNfYCyaa	Pokemon food..or bait...|`|l6NpeG3Oaa	I only watched the first Pokemon show.  I remember that there was one episode that someone said that Farfetch'd D was rare because it was being hunted and eaten, and that it especially taste good if cooked with it's onion stick weapon.  I think this was said when Ash used pokedex on Farfetch'd D.<br>  <br>  Also, another episode was when Ash caught Crabby, it was teleported because he already has 6 pokemon with him (limit of carrying 6 pokemon only).  So, he called Professor Oak with that phone that has a computer screen and he was surprised when the professor was eating, he thought that his Crabby pokemon was eaten but he saw Crabby in the background so Ash was relieved.  This means that Crabby pokemons are food too.<br>  <br>  There was also an episode where Meowth tried to eat James' Magikarp when they were stranded somewhere (i think in a boat).  But, Meowth failed because Magikarp's scale are super hard.<br>  <br>  So, what they eat are pokemon.|`|Xf8Z6rJfaa	Hmm i never really thought of that lol. I only ever saw them eat rice balls.

Clint Eastwood is the reason to watch this movie. Watching his character open up, examine his own racial prejudice and grow as a person, makes this a good film. Most of the criticism comes from actor/director Eastwood's choice to use the young, inexperienced, Asian, supporting cast. They do seem realistic and that is the problem. Their scenes come off as though they are real people in a documentary movie, because they don't really seem to be acting. Their scenes make the movie seem like college film or a low budget indie film, shot by handheld camera at a friend's house. In contrast, Eastwood is a very solid, experienced, film actor with a great theatrical style. He creates a larger than life character and a performance that towers over the other actors in the film. They end up looking very amateur doing scenes with Eastwood and that weakens the film. Eastwood's performance is so good, it makes the movie worth watching. That was my opinion
d55D0Ci4aa	First I think he did not believe her because he knew how much she loved Angel. But I also believe that he did not think he was worth loving. He considered hisself a monster and even though he chose to win back his soul (Angel got his through a curse, and did not ask for it), he found it hard to believe that he had it. It was not till the very end when he actually felt it, that he knew it was there.<br>  <br>  And yes, I believe she meant it. She loved Angel, but she also loved Spike, it was a different kind of love. She had that wild, passionate, I don't want to live without you kind of love for Angel. Spike was more a partner, friend, someone she could depend on to be there when she needed him.  Actually in the end, I think in her own way, she loved Spike as much as Angel, they were just different kinds of love.<br>  <br>  And yes, she appears on Angel.....|`|mvKDbb2uaa	I think Spike didn't believe Buffy because Buffy had been carrying this torch for Angel for so long and initially Buffy and Spike got together because Buffy needed the attention and someone who she didn't have to hide who she really is from.  So, the basis of their relationship was really all about the physical attraction.|`|1hS27eJuaa	I think that she did mean it, as for why he didn't he felt like she could never love him for everything he had done to her. no she does not appear in season 5 of angel.|`|380005ccc93660e0c4b3254e590b4b37aa	I think that she wanted to say something to him that ment the world to him.<br>  I think Buffy really wanted to say thank you, but those words didn't seem like enough for the thing he was doing, so her saying I LOVE YOU, was her way of saying "Thank you very very very much". She could never love Spike, I mean he almost raped her, and she knew him when he didn't have a soul first, as to Angel, who when she fell in love with him, she had only heard of Angulis.<br>  <br>  And Sorry, buffy does come out in some seasons of Angel, but not the last one.|`|zovrJ0yXaa	i think that she did mean it, because she had finally forgiven him for all the bad things he had done to her, but he was still wallowing in his self loathing and so denied it was true. he was prepared to die, it was more about him redeeming himself in that moment to be honest. buffy doesnt appear in season 5 of angel|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	Oh you know how girls are..They will say anything if they think it will get a guy in the sack. They have absolutely no respect for us guys at all.|`|3657c844f4c5e492cafceadf18dfa610aa	You mean when Spike sacrificed himself to save them all? (That was a great episode btw) I believe it was because he knew that Buffy didn't have anything to lose by saying it then, because he would be dead, and he knew there was something about him that was keeping her from being honest before, so she may have thought she was telling the truth at the end, but he knew it was just because he was being so heroic and it was an emotional moment, so she thought she loved him, but he knew that all along it was only him that loved her.  Not sure about Angel, anyway hope that helped!

d3wh7Ubqaa	Are you being serious? Suicide isn't a joke.<br>  I've been through rough periods all my life, even in my childhood. I didn't like it and, of course like any other person would, I considered suicide. Gather the strength to carry on and wait for good things to happen. It's an awful world to live in, I know, but you can make something great out of it. You think it sounds ridiculous when I say it now but, you'll miss all the great parts of life if you end it at a young age like yours.|`|sIJ6jxNdaa	suicide is stupid i can tell you that i had a bad childhood and other problems but i never lost hope i april may 2008 i also had bad luck but since feb 13 it was a friday bad luck day i felt very lucky i am aquarius|`|f11c2617b2709e882657207faf8c78b7aa	i have bad luck too, my dob is 12/7 which makes me a sagittarius <br>  but i try to be happy by telling myself that one day things will get better... suicide is not worth it. bad luck can change into good luck if u think of good things...<br>  <br>  <br>  bye|`|siuC4LNWaa	it'll probably go away. just relax and calm down, try to get your life back together. but suicide is not the answer to all your problems.

3BfmNEdPaa	Well you do have a good point. I'm trying to figure that out myself, but I think it's because he's to busy sobbing and healing from the past that he doesn't take the time to stop and think about where he is in life at this point. And he doesn't always act like no one cares because remember when they were going up against Zabuza and Kakashi said 'Sasuke, relax, I won't let any thing happen to you, swear it on my life...' or something. The point was that he calmed down and trusted him and regained his strenth and balls to fight. And to anwser that last battle question. I heard that Naruto kills Sasuke in the end.|`|RThxTnHZaa	Ok so you said you love saskue I have to be honest and say he is my least favorite character I can't stand him! When he left I thought he was soooo stupid but he acts all cool and acts like he's actually better than naruto. I don't think he is Naruto is definitely stronger and even though he might not be right now I think he'll end up becoming one of the strongest btu I still can't stand saskue. Not trying to be mean or rude just my opinion.|`|7ee556ba7650ff56026b0b693cf6cd72aa	sasuke doesn't want to destroy konoha. he wants to destroy itatchi. But what i dont understand is what will he do after he kills itatchi? where will he go? Atkatsuki? He's just an ***!|`|AwOi6U2Taa	i dont know?<br>  I. Naruto wins<br>  2.I LUV HIM TOOand he is<br>  3.sasuke lover|`|H6GIYDdzaa	He doesn't believe that, he puts on that impression because he believes if he does then it will become the truth.<br>  <br>  To him the revenge isn't stupid, he saw his own brother murder his entire village. All his family and friends killed by his brother who he always looked up to. I guess wanting revenge for that is stupid isn't it?<br>  <br>  Yes he is acting stupid but it's not because he is an idiot it's because he's so full of grief and shame for not being able to stop his brother. He feels guilty.<br>  <br>  Naruto will obviously win the final fight but I don't see why you have to sound so bothered by the outcome. You're setting yourself up for disappointment in one way or another.|`|MEbRr5uTaa	he's not dumb nor weak...he wants to kill his brother and the two elders from konoha, and to be honest i think i would left konoha too if i was in his situation, and if he didn't care about his friends he would've kill naruto till now but he didn't, u guys have to read the manga...and see that he cares, if he didn't care about himself he wouldn't be alive now..and he is strong, he kills itachi  in the "end" *spoiler *|`|7gmdPXc4aa	Just to point it out - his goal is NOT to destroy Konoha!! Its to kill his brother Uchiha Itachi! A Sasuke fan really?? Where did you get this idea from? It is Orochimaru that wants to detroy Konoha, Akatsuki who wants the bijous to rule over all the countries and Sasuke to avenge the deaths of his parents and entire clan by killing his brother!!<br>  <br>  And he is the way he is because he comes straight out of some other guys imagination, and this guy decided to make him a self-involved prick, that looks good on paper/screen!! Lol<br>  <br>  I heard in the end Sasuke returns to Konoha after fighting Naruto, Sauske loses but escapes with his life obviously, but runs back to Konoha after he kills Orochimaru... There is a war against Konoha at the time and he fights on there side. Then he finally shows off against Itachi. (This is what I've heard, don't quote me on it).|`|zNPGaZRHaa	Sasuke is a f****t.

This must be the most ridiculous and the most smart question I have ever seen around here!<br>  <br>  Obviously, Chuck doesn't make mistakes, therefore, he could not create an army that would kill himself.

The original Chuck Norris has more experience than the clones and he will eventually take advantage of that, and win.<br>  <br>  3. One invincible guy vs. a bunch of invincible guys is a tie. They would keep fighting forever.<br>  <br>  I bet on the 3rd.<br>  Since fighting is the story of the life of Chuck, I believe he would be in heaven!|`|0haWIfVMaa	As with sequels, the original is always better.

39OVFs5Raa	Being funny is generally seen as a desirable quality in the dating world, and it can also help you make friends or fit in in many social situations...lets see if I can walk you through some basic steps!<br>  <br>  Think beyond jokes. Jokes can be funny, but being funny is about much more than being able to tell jokes. While jokes are a valuable addition to your funny replertoire, if you simply repeat jokes that you've heard, you're not so much being funny as repeating something that somebody funny thought of. That said, joke-telling is an art itself, and there are good joke tellers and bad joke tellers.  To be funny you must be a good joke teller.<br>  <br>  Broaden your base of material. In everyday conversation, being funny is mostly about having something funny to say about something that comes up in the course of the conversation. Sometimes this can be a prefabricated joke, but more often you're on your own, and if you're to have any hope of thinking up something funny, you've got to know something about the subject of the conversation--the more you know, the better. If you know lets say a tremendous amount women you've probably got a good chance of saying something funny when that comes up in conversation.  In a way, being funny is simply showing that you are intelligent enough and know enough about something (hopefully a great many things) to find the humorous nuances that others miss. <br>  <br>  Learn from the best. In the same way that good writers are almost always prolific readers, really funny people usually are familiar with the techniques of other funny people. Watch funny movies and shows, read funny books, and go see some stand-up comedians. If you have very funny acquaintances, pay attention to what makes them funny. Immerse yourself in humor and you'll develop a toolbox of techniques you can use to be funny. <br>  <br>  Be observant:  Look for the humor in everyday situations, and see what others don't.<br>  <br>  Know your audience. If you want to be funny to other people, you need to have at least some idea of what they find funny. <br>  <br>  Be quick.  People can appreciate even a slightly funny comment if it's said at the right time (usually as soon as possible after the event that precipitated the comment). If you wait too long, however, even very funny comments will lose their impact. For example, if someone says something to you and you think of a witty comeback two hours later, you're probably better off just keeping it to yourself. It won't be funny anymore, and you'll look slow, and sometimes, really stupid. <br>  <br>  Develop a comedic personality. Be yourself. You can't be all things to all people, so you should develop your own unique brand of humor. In other words, learn from comedians and friends, but don't try to duplicate them (unless you're doing impressions, which can be funny). <br>  <br>  Take it easy. Don't tell 10 jokes over a 2 minute period. Be conservative and tell the jokes at the right time. <br>  <br>  Don't give up. Sometimes a joke will fall flat, or an observation that cracks you up will just make others groan. Don't be discouraged. Learn from your comedic errors, and keep trying.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!!!.|`|zLcYfde4aa	You just have to be naturally funny. I'm the most boring person ever and i can't tell jokes to save my life.|`|AA10565295	Are they long stand up jokes?<br>  <br>  If you want to be funny, make every word count. Also, just bring up strange ideas. Like what if we went over to the principal and asked him where to buy drugs? Not that that's funny, but just peculiar ideas, you know?|`|ItQOLOSXaa	tell it as fluently as possible, no stumbling over your words, and try animated. but some jokes work told deadpan. comics know the science from years of guaging reactions and using voices, hand expressions and timing, etc.|`|fMKPp6qkaa	dood, ya jus qodda hav the qene of funny. n if ya don't qot it, ya don't qot it. qot it?|`|ul2zaaPNaa	Jazz it up a little bit.

I miss the old kanye.hopefully that 808 is a phase. he also needs to stop being so full of himself.|`|zOjXxLftaa	I know Kanye West.<br>  I like Heartless a lot!<br>  Also, there is Love Lockdown (Good To Dance To)<br>  <br>  But he does have a Big Ego, and not many people are fans of him.<br>  <br>  Hope This Helps!!!! :)|`|yDtKj4dhaa	i like "street lights" and "see u n my nightmares" but his attitude is rude and he thinks hes all that so i wont ever buy his music but ill limewire it =) 50 cent vs a punk like him... who woulda thought he'd win?!|`|lDC0PNFTaa	I think Kanye's crooked for making that 808's and Heartbreaks album, but I must say, College Dropout + Late Registration were hot.|`|AweHXAjLaa	Nobody|`|tefmLFmWaa	Heartless for me was his best but that album was his worst!|`|MVeuYU0Yaa	champion.|`|mtDllLYVaa	I do, I like Can't Tell Me Nothing and Through The Wire

iWwsOK5Baa	Yes! I can't stand men who abuse women!!|`|1f4c803984defdfd24e382289f4e3180aa	No because it doesn't do anything in the long run. <br>  <br>  I'm however telling everyone to stop buying his music, no more downloads, no albums or to buy any products that he endorses in the future.<br>  <br>  I'd rather hurt him in his pockets at this point by killing his career. I also suggest that if your local radio station is still playing his music to call them and ask them to stop. The more people who request it, the better the chance they'll stop playing it. Hopefully this will serve as an example that if you think it's okay to hit women, then your career will be over.|`|FClC80XPaa	I just hope people open their eyes to see the real Chris Brown. Not the  shiny clean cut celebrity, but the person he just let the world know he is deep down. I don't care what happened between them, NOTHING warrants what he did to her! I am so sick of reading posts of people saying she must have done something really bad. That is shear ignorance. Apparently this world is full of rednecks! Wake up and realize no one is above the law, not even Chris Brown.|`|pfJorlTIaa	NO... Because who are we to judge??  WE have no idea what happened.  I'm not a teen, i am older and seen many things in the world.  I dont condone domestic violence. But I dont condone it either way.  Rhianna is no angel, regardless.  In the real world, her nasty attitude and nasty ways about her would have gotten her Azz kicked many a times.  This may not be politicly correct, but do we know if she hit him first? No.  <br>  He appologized, give him a break.<br>  Hearing Many Many men speak about this at work, believe it or not, many of them say they would kick her Azz even worse.<br>  Maybe she should fix herself and check her better than thou attitude.<br>  <br>  Sorry to offend truley abused females!!  there is a difference.|`|b5mYb5praa	i think there is always two sides to the story we should most deifnintley wair for more information from both parties rih and breezy are my fave artiists so im thinkin we shuld wait till we know more about it though chris should never have hit rihanna  so hard he should be punished and beg for forgiveness to err is human but to apologise is divne|`|raAHre0raa	honestly i always disliked Chris brown. know. i just don't know what to say. the guy is a dumb ***. plain out stupid. especially to a girl like rihannna. disgusting.|`|RwZLTC6aaa	No because that's just stooping down to his level. I think wat comes around goes around so he will get wat he deserves when justice is served.... jay z is fair pissed off with him any way|`|a1d7539ac2479c53542542eef301b5dbaa	I hope the girls now know what kinda man he is!!!|`|G7bDuuZ8aa	No|`|LRLu1ofNaa	Yes.|`|AA11850523	No<br>  <br>  I felt like finding him guilty and sentencing him to time in jail
207dFmdHaa	I am hoping when you say hit, you mean flirt with or ask out...not hit and cause harm?  If you mean to flirt and ask out of coarse, pregnant women need love too.|`|blwDnJy4aa	You wanna be her baby's daddy?|`|q02UN23aaa	if you wanna be a Baby Daddy then yes|`|9nymzoOXaa	no.|`|NBi07o6zaa	It's kind of vulgar...if she's single, then chances are she might not be ready to start a new relationship while she's pregnant, but you never know. If it's someone you really like, and you're willing to be the father of her baby or take care of her while she's pregnant, go right ahead.|`|nDSLNnguaa	ROTFL!!!!!<br>  <br>  You can try, but having been one I can tell you she probably won't be interested!|`|A8nHjEzmaa	Only a self-proclaimed genius would ask a question like that!|`|aNrjfpyaaa	I'd say it depends on if she is with her childs father or not. If she is not then I see no problem with it.|`|qBz0ZfzFaa	Sure. As long as you don't mind when her babydaddy comes to beat you up.|`|Rodj52Swaa	unless if you wanna be the father then yeah sure go riiiiiight ahead|`|9qo6dSLAaa	yes it is ok to flirt (just not if shes married lol)<br>  ^.^|`|G4Clnn6paa	er, prolly not|`|uIZDd3y5aa	Probably not|`|wprjWR1Kaa	NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|lt7gcuw0aa	Not if shes dating or married.

Mzu9bHbmaa	Heroic Age is the anime that you are looking for. It's kind of a mix of both SciFi and Fantasy. The story is a bit complicated to explain(It's more complicated to read than it is to watch): The basic idea is that since the Golden Tribe(A group of God like beings that use to rule the universe) have left to explore a new Universe and the Heroic Tribe(The strongest beings in the universe) have killed each other off in a war, the Iron Tribe(Humans) have been hunted almost to extinction by the Silver Tribe(The dominant tribe in the Universe) and the Brozen Tribe(the slaves of the Silver Tribe). Mankinds last hope is a Nodes known as A.G.E. A nodes is a person raised by the Golden Tribe that posses the power of The Heroic Tribe inside of them. The Silver Tribe has 4 Nodes under their control and the Iron Tribe has 1(who is the strongest Nodes).<br>  <br>  Anyways the story is set in space. The War is between the Silver Tribe and Iron Tribe. And the Nodes look like giant monsters or Mechs(but they look nothing like Gundams) and there is magic involved. The action is epic and the characters are pretty likeable.|`|IGu36Iwwaa	HA! you couldnt have asked an easier question.<br>  Space Battleship anime.<br>  <br>  Space Battleship Yamato(Be Forever Yamato)<br>  Super Dimensional Fortress Macross(Stay away from Robotech, its horrible)<br>  Captain Harlock<br>  Blue Sub 6 (Yes its in the ocean not space but it still works)<br>  Cowboy Bebop(More of a sci-fi spaghetti western)<br>  Glass Fleet<br>  Irresponsible Captain Tylor<br>  Crest of the Stars<br>  Legend of Galactic Heroes(Never released in US, fansub may be hard to find)<br>  Martian Successor Nadesico<br>  Outlaw Star<br>  Toward the Terra<br>  Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise(Brilliant)<br>  <br>  Oh and if you like big ships and things exploding<br>  Zipang is about a Japanese Nuclear AEGIS cruiser that gets sent back to WW2.

5m3WOFamaa	Basically, you could cut out the whole exposition and development and have just the opening, recapitulation and coda. By doing this you could cut out about 7 minutes of a 14 minute long performance, giving you 7 minutes to play with. You could do a slow cadenza and a slow second subject to compensate perhaps? Not sure but might be worth a try? To make up the extra minutes if this is a problem, you could play the  opening and principle subject of the exposition, and then, when you are about to modulate to the major second subject, don't. Keep in the minor key and go straught to the recapitulation. Hope this helps.|`|rNqF4gIVaa	There is no good way to do this. However the final movement is slightly more than ten minutes... just play that.

The two main characters are in a gay relationship, but it focuses more on the romance and comedy of the relationship.  It also has a lot to do with music.  There's 13 episodes total with some OVA's.<br>  <br>  Yaoi is much more intense with maybe some "mature" parts in it.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped some. :)|`|ZII6YCk1aa	It's yaoi.|`|GhhbZphuaa	yes... but it's refered to shounen-ai, which means boys' love, all you see is boys kiss and stuff...and yes i've seen it and i like it! yay! :D|`|P9wB5Epdaa	Well its a romance and music anime.. If you're into that stuff go ahead.|`|iAVx3IZ7aa	Yes. But if you like music and romance check it out.|`|I2iNfYCyaa	I don't think so.
bsnnEsp5aa	Angel Tales (harem, fantasy, romance, angels)<br>  Angel's Tail is a harem comedy with an interesting twist. Goro Mutsumi is a 20-something single guy who's had a run of bad luck. One day, the Goddess tells his fortune and that luck is coming his way. Over the next few days, twelve former pets of his come back as Guardian Angels, all girls of various ages from Kindergarten to Mid-20's.<br>  <br>  Chobits (romance, ecchi, robots, fantasy, comedy, drama)<br>  Having failed to earn admission to a university, Hideki Motosuwa has moved to the big city, determined to study his hardest for next year's exams. However, an unusual distraction presents itself one unsuspecting day in the form of Chii, a robotic young girl that has been discarded in the trash. In a world where an increasing number of people turn to these 'persocons' for company, the bonds and limits of human relationships are tested as flesh manages to fall in love with the machine itself...<br>  <br>  Happy World (romance, angels, supernatural, comedy)<br>  After his apartment burning to the ground and almost being killed by a falling metal object, Ohmura Takeshi is ready for the afterlife. Luckily, a beautiful angel appears to heal his wounds and inform him that if he stays with her, no harm will come to him. The catch? His long-lost deadbeat dad has passed along a curse: he will experience nothing but sadness in his life. Now, after changing to a human to maintain close contact, Elle will stop at nothing to make sure that a bit of happiness comes into Takeshi's life, but not before first learning how to be a human!<br>  <br>  Zero No Tsukaima (romance, fantasy, witches, supernatural)<br>  In a world where magic is a reality, the young Louise is at the bottom of her class. Dubbed "Zero" by her classmates at Tristein Academy (due to her zero success rate for magic), Louise (along with all first year students) was charged with summoning a familiar; and instead of a cute magical creature, the familiar arrived in the form of... Saito Hiraga, a normal Japanese boy who was abruptly teleported from his own world?! Can both Louise and Saito come to terms with their new and complicated "relationship" and (more importantly) help Saito find a way home?<br>  <br>  Final Approach (romance, drama, comedy, harem) <br>  In present-day Japan, a rising decline in the birth rate has prompted the government to intervene, thus forming the R.T.P. committee whose goal is to promote arranged marriages. Due to the sensitive nature of the issue, however, a test run was deemed mandatory, and young Ryo Mizuhara (chosen by the world's best supercomputer) was selected as the test subject, much to his own dismay. With the megalomaniac Shizuka Masuda appointed as his fiancee and secret agents in his face at every turn, can Ryo manage to save his sanity, let alone his bachelor lifestyle of the past?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :D|`|O01oFg3Eaa	They don't exist<br>  ;] haha|`|N1stgM5Aaa	Hm, try some of these romantic fantasies:<br>  <br>  <> Spice and Wolf ::: 13 episodes <><br>  <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=8537" rel="nofollow">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...</a><br>  <> Fate/stay night ::: 24 episodes <><br>  <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=5394" rel="nofollow">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...</a><br>  <> Shakugan no Shana ::: 24 episodes <><br>  <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=5943" rel="nofollow">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...</a><br>  <> Escaflowne ::: 26 episodes <><br>  <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=240" rel="nofollow">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...</a><br>  <> Zero no Tsukaima ::: 13 episodes <><br>  <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6660" rel="nofollow">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...</a><br>  <> Mai-HiME ::: 26 episodes <><br>  <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=4155" rel="nofollow">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...</a><br>  <> Romeo x Juliet ::: 24 episodes <><br>  <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=7087" rel="nofollow">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...</a><br>  <> Tsubasa Chronicle ::: 26 episodes <><br>  <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=4591" rel="nofollow">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...</a><br>  <> Fushigi Yuugi ::: 52 episodes <><br>  <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=178" rel="nofollow">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...</a><br>  <br>  I hope that helps ^_^|`|HgVLhCr9aa	Clannad might fit the bill.

f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	The Oscars and all those awards are so fixed. They don't care whether or not a movie is any good or if people liked it or not. They only seem to allow certain types of movies to be nominated, particularly ones with dead actors in them, or washed up actors trying to make comebacks, or actors who were formerly in rehab etc. They don't give a flying fig about the actual movie.|`|56bNLJykaa	First off, Academy Award nominations are already questionable- we do not want even worse movies to be nominated. Marley and Me (highly recommend the book) was not a serious movie.. Its not "obviously worthy" of a best picture nomination thats one of the craziest things i;ve ever heard.. Um, tell me what was great about the direction, cinematography, script, score (if there was one), acting that would deserve it of any award nomination. It was a feel good film, big hollywood blockbuster, NOT intended for an Oscar.<br>  <br>  Please, before you say such things research and watch some quality movies (M, The Passion of Joan of Arc, Fellini;s 8 1/2, Citizen Kane, In the Mood for Love) so you know what makes a good movie.|`|hat60KYXaa	That movie isn't as good as any of the nominees this year, and I can easily name 5 more that are more deserving of a nomination than Marley & Me.|`|q6uyloYdaa	It's certainly eligible, but that movie was a fluff feel-good movie for Christmas. Even if it were nominated, it wouldn't be picked for Best Picture. Besides, that category is generally reserved for serious dramas.|`|sfUUml0Daa	D: idk, but thats one of my faveoritist movies <3|`|807fcae559f0d52cb9c4a617e1ab098aaa	IT WASNT ANY GOOD.|`|xYgQ6TSOaa	...how old are you-10? First all films are "eligible" but come on, the acting in the film was WAY below par and I love Jen Aniston. Additionally, just like one other person said, it was clearly a puff piece for a feel good family film and those never get a nomination. It was a "cute" film but trust me, it wasn't even considered.|`|NI5HchZ4aa	I don't know but it almost broke my streak of not crying at the movies since i saw My Girl. "Thomas Jay needs his glasses!"

0vlm2OZcaa	How to Attend a Movie Premiere<br>  <br>  1- Know where to look.<br>  <br>  Movie screening locations will be advertised in the entertainment section of local newspapers or online. Newspaper ads will require you to RSVP to an email or pick up the tickets from a physical location. Online movie screening recruitment companies such as Movie Filler provide information, news and a movie screening locator about free movie tickets to screenings and movie premieres.<br>  <br>  2- Check back frequently.<br>  <br>  If you thought discount airline tickets were tough to get your hands on, wait until trying to get movie screening tickets. Although tickets are generally free, they have a tendency to sell out quickly. Checking websites that distribute screening tickets on a regular basis provides a higher chance of reserving a ticket. In addition, make sure to sign up for any electronic newsletters to keep informed as new screenings are posted.<br>  <br>  3- Update personal information.<br>  <br>  Make sure any personal information you provide is updated and correct. Tickets are often distributed based on specific demographic. Having your information correct will increase your chances for getting invited to world premiers and movie screenings you would actually want to attend.<br>  <br>  4- Plan to arrive early.<br>  <br>  Movie premieres and screenings are often overbooked to ensure that the theater is full. Those that arrive early will have the best chance to get available seating inside the theater. A general rule of thumb is to arrive around 60 minutes before a movie screening and at least 120 minutes before a movie premiere.<br>  <br>  5- Leave camera phones in the car.<br>  <br>  When it comes to piracy, studios take no chances. Recording devices will not be allowed into movie screenings. There will usually be several security officers performing a search as you enter the event. If you have a camera phone, they will ask you to return it to your car. Avoid losing your place in line and make sure to leave it in your vehicle.<br>  <br>  6- Prepare your review.<br>  <br>  Audience interviews won't happen at every screening. However, if you see a film crew, be assertive and volunteer to be interviewed. Remember to be as descriptive as possible when describing your thoughts about the movie and steer away from one-word answers. After the shoot, monitor online video sites like YouTube and MySpace Videos, then brag to your friends.|`|71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	Mostly by invitation. Sometimes there are promotions with radio and tv stations.
0vlm2OZcaa	You can actually buy them you don't have to be celebrity to attend.<br>  <br>  Step1 Be in the right city. The fact is that most movie premieres take place in Los Angeles (Hollywood). There are other movie premieres in New York and sometimes there are smaller premieres in different cities. You have to be in the right city to even get a chance to go to a movie premiere.<br>  <br>  Step2 Know the right people. Another fact is that the easiest way to get tickets to a movie premiere is to know someone related to the movie. If you can rub shoulders with filmmakers, movie stars or their family and friends, you’ll get those tickets without any problems.<br>  <br>  Step3 Keep your radar out for charity movie premieres. In some cases, tickets are sold to movie premieres in order to raise money for a charity. You can buy a ticket and probably get a tax deduction later.<br>  <br>  Step4 Register with websites that give away movie premiere tickets. There are various websites that let you sign up for tickets either by agreeing to receive free offers or by using a lottery system (see resources).<br>  <br>  Step5 Listen to the radio. There are sometimes radio contests for movie premiere tickets.<br>  <br>  Step6 Start a film blog. If you can get yourself established as a film blogger, you might get tickets to movie premieres. It’s easiest to get them to independent and local film premieres but you might eventually work your way up to the bigtime. You have to blog regularly and promote your blog for this method to work.<br>  Step7 Subscribe to film blogs. Sometimes major entertainment sites will offer tickets or information about tickets on their blogs. Staying on top of the news is the only way to know if movie premiere tickets are even available.<br>  <br>  Tips & Warnings<br>  Premieres usually happen a few days before the release date of the film, during an evening on a weekday.|`|6PNuFgTJaa	I would think you could just get tickets. I always wanted to go to one!
HmZwX1djaa	Wikipedia is good for mainstream well known (and even some not so well-known) stuff.<br>  <br>  But I'm very surprised to find that noone mentioned allmusic.com.<br>  <a href="http://www.allmusic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.allmusic.com</a><br>  <br>  For me it has very dependable and only verrrrry rarley do i not find stuff that I'm looking for. <br>  Genre, length, composer, album; the site mentions it all.

weVBPfmoaa	Man, imagine that, you are not the only otaku in the world... I am too LOL. And the animes or cartoons that are done with this kind of theme are paid the rights to be used... I think.  It is totally legal.|`|dfjIBHe3aa	It's been published during enlightened times.  Les Daniel's book Comix had some examples of eight pagers from the twenties and thirties which had sexually explicit images of cartoon characters and movies stars (published in Mexico though).  It's almost certainly not technically illegal but as the case of 2 live crew shows just because it's not pornography doesn't mean you won't be prosecuted.|`|L4rlu2BDaa	As far as i know it's no different then adult porn so i would persume its legal. It could be seen as a little different if the cartoon character was based on an underage child, someone like kim possible. But not illegal.
XQvLV5imaa	Listening to this tune, your mind is meant to wander back to the days of old Scotland... The composer, Percy Grainger, devoted himself not just to creating new music, but also to capturing and immortalizing a little bit of the old world.  From 1901 to 1914 he actually dwelled between England and Scotland to better document the old folk songs sung by the "peasants" of the time.  In his music, he hoped to convey not a classical sound, but a sound that was true; a sound that had all the tone and texture of a hunter's song as he walked through the woods.  He wrote this piece in the Autumn of 1901, and originally titled it "The Caledonian Hunt's Delight." (Caldonia being the green hilly region to the Southern half of Scotland)<br>  <br>  To give the tune added meaning and authenticity, lyrics were added, taken from a poem by Robert Burns, a native Scotsman.  The poem, set on the lush banks of the River Doon (also in Southern Scotland), paints a tragic tale of a heartbroken lover.  Wandering along the banks of the river, he spots a bird perched in a nearby tree, happily singing with its mate.  He reminisces about the love he once had, true as the little bird's song... but then recalls how the rose of their love was snatched away, and he was left with only thorns in his heart.  (lyrics --> <a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/ye-banks-and-braes-o-bonnie-doon/" rel="nofollow">http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/ye-banks-...</a> )<br>  <br>  So as you play this song, listen for the sound of a lover's sad harmonies and the restful tune of the river flowing by...  Maybe even picture yourself there, in the lonely hills of Scotland.  (picture --> <a href="http://www.aawp.org.uk/images/trees/PC%2002%20-%20Ness%20Glen%20Scots%20Pine.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.aawp.org.uk/images/trees/PC%2...</a> )

mD7eAAoNaa	I think it depends on the persons views. Some people don't mind their partners who have been around, some people have been around but want to settle with a virgin, etc. I think a guy or girl who is a virgin, has some self-respect. It would be very rare to find a guy who is a virgin. The good thing about being a Virgin is that you are not carrying any STDs, so your significant other should appreciate that and not pass it on to you if they aren't virgins. But as someone answered earlier, I think most guys would appreciate an experienced girl.|`|I2iNfYCyaa	I really believe so..|`|47l1Sumeaa	Well, I'm a virgin *blush* and I'm 20 years old. I dated my ex-boyfriend for 5 or 6 years on and off (he's significantly older than me; he is 26 almost 27 in April) and I told him that I was going to wait for the right moment. Unfortunately, me and him had a lot of issues and problems in our relationship that we never found that "moment". I believe I was ready but we just had too many issues. And we broke up last year. It was a really painful and bad breakup for me. He was physically abusive towards me and very possessive and controlling. These problems drifted us apart and therefore, I haven't lost my virginity.....yet.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm hoping that I find the right guy to lose my virginity to because it really is my most prized possession (my virginity). I'm very pleased with myself for being able to maintain my self-control and dignity.|`|f11c2617b2709e882657207faf8c78b7aa	yes! it's hard finding 1 it's so "normal" to not be 1 anymore<br>  but guys will respect u more like ur husband for actually being 1<br>  <br>  im a 20 yr old V = ) and proud. i've had so many admirers and it's very tempting to do stuff... but im waiting for that special guy to lose it with after marriage! (if he exist) <br>  <br>  sagittarius|`|tvWm1e4naa	yes. it's easy to be devirginized but once you lost it, you can't have it back.<br>  you can only give it once. so make sure it's with the right person and better wait to do it until you are married.|`|BP7SfeGPaa	i think these days a virgin guy is special dont ya think so?|`|eT6SsCaraa	I'm seventeen this March, and I'm still a virgin. ^_^  <br>  <br>  And I'm not about to just give it away.. My virginity is important to me, one of the most important things I have. It is a sacred thing, and should not be lost until after marriage. And I would only lose it to the one I love, and will be with forever... and only him...<br>  <br>  Also, the thought of sharing partners is sick to me... <br>  <br>  Anyway, I would say..in this day and age, they are rare or special. Even in high school there's a high rate of underage stuff...|`|R1Fc344laa	not really.<br>  ok so when i lost my virginity i thought oh wow this is gonna b awesome for him cuz i'm a virgin and it was lame cuz i didnt knwo how to do a lot of sex moves so i was really awkward. second boyfriend i was still fairly unexperienced so our love life was mediocre also. NOW i have been having sex for many years and trust me, MEN PREFER AN EXPERIENCED WOMAN they say they want a virgin but the truth is they want someone who knowswhat theyre doing. yeah it's hot to date an 18yr old who will be new to everything but to date a 24 yr oldl ike me that knows tricks and manuveurs, is much better. plus i'm less awkward in bed. yes it is possible to be awkward and confused in bed especially for a girl. <br>  and also reading about sex positions and stuff is VERY different from actually trying them out, practice makes perfect. BUT DONT BE A SLUT just let the experience come naturally with the guys that u end up dating and in time you'll be a great sex partner, it's the only way. no one is a great sex partner their first 10 times, it's impossible.|`|gg2Ao9fSaa	I thought they were extinct like dinosaurs?  But my honest answer is yes why waste on someone that you meet in high school who probaly isn't even worth it or do they know any sexually?  <br>  <br>  Wait it won't hurt.|`|824be40cc48c5da175daa324af3f7074aa	I am going to say that a virgin girl is just as special as a virgin boy. That will give everyone something to mull over.|`|pDLZ6BGyaa	Not to me personally. But then again I don't believe a woman's worth is based on an intact hymen. But better you than me!<br>  <br>  Sag Sun/Leo Moon/Gemini Rising|`|1g78klvYaa	yes, special!|`|S8UQkH3Qaa	i would not care, so long as she remains faithful as i am, after we get together.

Scarface (1983) stars Al Pacino as a fictional character named Tony Montana.  However, there is an old movie about Al Capone called Scarface, but that was filmed in 1932.  Al Capone is, for me, best depicted in the 1987 film The Untouchables with Robert De Niro as Capone.  <br>  <br>  Curiously enough, both the 1983 film Scarface, and the 1987 film The Untouchables, were both directed by the same person...Brian De Palma.|`|f5821d0eb9486d7586aa71ba68cdecc8aa	The original 1932 version was based on Capone.

An example in a sentence is 'It is nearly impossible to escape from one's dogging fears'. <br>  <br>  Dogging is also a term in British slang. It alludes to sexual intercourse in public or semi public places. These could include car parks, parks, or dim movie theatre. Usually these acts take place with spectators present as it is believed that being watched will heighten the sexual pleasure. Exhibitionism and Voyeurism are closely linked with dogging. <br>  <br>  Dogging could involve several people simultaneously and group orgies are not uncommon. It was publicized to such an extent when the footballer Stan Collymore participated that it became impossible for innocent couples to park their vehicles in dogging 'sites' without being instantly surrounded by a circle of mainly male onlookers.|`|uKSsXz2iaa	Lol, I'm going to say never|`|UgFmbeZpaa	just before they closed the dog track down LOL|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	what exactly is dogging? whats the rules? u mean like doggie style??|`|5XyBxxYAaa	Have never done it|`|v0Bk9fWGaa	im only a child of 82 could you explain it lmao~]|`|I2iNfYCyaa	Never b/c I never heard of such a thing..|`|3Uq2tXliaa	I think it's funny the number of people that aren't even aware of the meaning of the term!<br>  <br>  The last time I went dogging was about 2 years ago, I stopped going as I was sick of getting arrested for 20 weeks and then finding out I was to father *another* child!|`|B0dX0GCiaa	before i lost my license from hit and run|`|ODvnyAdlaa	im a dogging virgin :( x|`|Wy3wddFlaa	dogging???? hu|`|GwHxPCPgaa	isnt that were we met|`|VhWll8Vjaa	I'm going tonight.<br>  <br>  Meet you at eppington forest, just off foles street! at about 10:30pm|`|zRUHryuraa	9 out of 10 people enjoy gang rape!|`|Hdvy9zkraa	Last night ...took a couple of manc coppers with me...they knew all the routes ;)|`|wam93FEdaa	mostly in junes|`|S0Clu20aaa	For everyone who doesn't know what it means soooooooooo funny !!!<br>  Never !!!<br>  My fella satisfies me in a way I need nothing more...<br>  But each to there own ...Happy dogging !!!<br>  Peek-a-boo!!|`|c4q4lpr0aa	I've never gone dogging or swinging.....|`|awio5lIjaa	dogging??? what the heck does that mean?|`|Tt61Vp92aa	i do it when i can|`|aYZXi6ffaa	When me and snoop still bashed Eazy|`|ec9cd1a19bba30708d858894d59d9cb2aa	in epping forest a few years back .|`|B0wtzW3taa	whatwadda??|`|Gz9449J5aa	hmm yesterday|`|wprjWR1Kaa	2 years ago|`|0VbAMZccaa	what is "dogging"?|`|9SSO454taa	i always wanted to try it but never had the guts to|`|WjIqICg3aa	copenhagen dog street 85 full of em,,,,,,,,|`|Ne5PQ09oaa	you should know .... i saw you there

e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	I think you want less techno and more of the sub-genre, electro.  Lately I've noticed Paul Oakenfold and BT move in that direction (check out Oakenfold's remix of Britney Spears' "Gimme More").  Yeah, they're old to the scene now, but no less relevant.<br>  <br>  See if you can't get your hands on a torrent of the Ministry of Sound's Annual: The Electro-House Sessions from 2008.  It's really good.<br>  <br>  As far as Euro DJ's I have no idea off the top of my head who would fit the bill for you.  Paul Woolford and Roman Flugel on my iPod from the MOS Electro-House CD's.  DJ Mangoo, Otzi, & Sona might be good to look up.  Dunno where DJ Tiesto is from, but he's one of my faves, too. Gigi D'agostino?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|BA2pSQYOaa	i really like millions by jordan and baker here's a link to it a long with a few other techno tunes (some german songs in it as well)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8zlG04LCGk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8zlG04LC...</a>|`|Rsr8nngWaa	Go to DI.fm and listen to a couple of their stations for a while, they play a lot of good stuff, then see what you like.|`|0Dv91Ymnaa	Techno Rocker - Base Attack<br>  Turn Me Up - Benassi Bros <br>  Change Style - Benny Benassi<br>  The Whistle Song - Pulsedriver
YUjVFkocaa	Here's the best movies (in order from best to worst) from each genre. This was decided between best movies of all time according to critics, best movies by people's ratings, and my personal preference.<br>  <br>  Chick-flicks: The Notebook, The Titanic, 50 first dates, fools gold, and theres something about mary. (Don't have too much for this)<br>  <br>  Action: Terminator 2, Die Hard 1, Batman: The Dark Knight, Rambo: First Blood, Apocalypto, Gladiator, Eraser, Predator, Aliens, Mission: Impossible.<br>  <br>  Futuristic/Dystopian (these are the ones Im best with- REALLY good movies): A Clockwork Orange, The Island, Brazil, Minority Report, Wings of Desire, Children of Men, Ghost In The Shell, 1984, V for Vendetta, Blade Runner, Planet of the Apes, Mad Max.<br>  <br>  Comedy: Ace Ventura: Pet detective, Liar Liar, Rat Race, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, American Pie 1 & 2, Animal House, Dodgeball, Caddyshack, Dumb and Dumber.<br>  <br>  Boxing/gangs/city movies: Rocky, The Godfather, Scarface, Goodfellas, Dirty Harry, Raging Bull (boxing), Resorvoir Dogs, American Gangster, The Usual Suspects, Boondock Saints (if you're Irish), Million Dollar Baby, Training Day.<br>  <br>  Sports/racial films: Remember the Titans, American History X, Hoosiers, Bull Durham, The Natural, Friday Night Lights, Hoop Dreams, Visionquest, Caddyshack, White Men Can't Jump, Rudy, Slap Shot, Coach Carter. (These are actually ALL REALLY CLOSE and all are extremely good... see them all!)<br>  <br>  Scary/Horror movies (great at these too): The Shining, Psycho, It, 28 days later (and 28 weeks later is also good), The Exorcist, The Thing, The Butterfly Effect, Silence of the Lambs, The Ring, The Grudge, Se7en, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Night of the Living Dead.<br>  <br>  War Movies (ill only list a few great ones): Saving Private Ryan, Enemy At The Gates, Braveheart, Schindlers List, We Were Soldiers, Full Metal Jacket, The Patriot, The Hunt for Red October, The great escape.<br>  <br>  Martial Arts Movies:  Enter the Dragon, Bloodsport, The Chinese Connection, Fearless, Ong Bak: Thai Warrior, Drunken Master, Fists of Fury, the Shaolin Temple, Game of Death, Hero, Iron Monkey.<br>  <br>  Fantasy: Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia, (and then Twilight is even worse than the many movies NOT mentioned lol).<br>  <br>  Superhero Movies: batman begins, batman: dark knight, spiderman 1 and 2, iron man, X2: Xmen United, Superman: The movie, The Incredibles.|`|6CztVG3xaa	Based on your list and recommendations, I have a few you'd probably like.  <br>  <br>  1. Layer Cake - directed by Matthew Vaughn and starring Daniel Craig<br>  2. Boondock Saints - directed by Troy Duffy and starring Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus<br>  3. Man on Fire - directed by Tony Scott (Domino) and starring Denzel Washington<br>  4. Deja Vu - also directed by Tony Scott and starring Denzel Washington and Jim Caviezel<br>  5. Fight Club - directed by David Fincher and starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton<br>  6. Die Hard - directed by John McTiernan and starring Bruce Willis<br>  7. The Bourne Ultimatum directed by Paul Greengrass and starring Matt Damon<br>  8. Terminator 2: Judgement Day - directed by James Cameron and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger<br>  9. Reservoir Dogs - directed by Quentin Tarantino and starring Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Steve Buscemi<br>  <br>  and since you like Trainspotting.<br>  <br>  10-12. Sunshine, Slumdog Millionaire, and 28 Days Later - all directed by Danny Boyle.  Sunshine is more suspense action, Slumdog is kind of a feel good movie, done in a very innovative style, and 28 Days is more or less a zombie flick.  <br>  <br>  You may have already seen a number of them, but check out the ones you haven't.|`|56bNLJykaa	based off of your interests i'd recommend: The Boondock Saints, Oldboy, Amores Perros, Taxi Driver, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (actually part of the Oldboy series), Leon: The Professional, Mean Streets, Ichi the Killer, City of God (cidade de deus) and Layer Cake. I hope the Funny Games you were referring to was the original - German, if not then see it.. I wouldn't even bother seeing the American version. Have fun watching|`|6d35e41181c09dfb7e7d8361032636d4aa	Trainspotting is a good one.|`|tLI94qWNaa	Oldboy <br>  Unleashed<br>  Natural Born Killers <br>  Lost highway<br>  Fight club<br>  The Doom Generation <br>  Man Bites Dog<br>  Straw dogs|`|JSryPP8faa	Blow<br>  Mystic River<br>  Seven<br>  The Sting
y8WBcehmaa	Amy Adams<br>  <br>  2nd: Taraji Henson|`|qJ9o3iQnaa	This one is also hard for me.  I would like to see Marisa Tomei get it. (I'm biased and I like her best)<br>  <br>  But I think Amy Adams and Penelope Cruz did magnificent jobs.  <br>  <br>  Who will get it? Amy Adams for doubt|`|XJRYAhZVaa	I like Viola, Taraji and Marisa.<br>  <br>  But I am stuck between Viola and Taraji. I think both are underrated especially Viola. I always tend to root for the underdog so I am going with Viola!|`|ieiseiv4aa	Marisa T - shock 'em all again baby!<br>  <br>                        or <br>  <br>  Taraji Henson - should have won for Hustle & Flow
qJ9o3iQnaa	Ok I know I'm sure I'll be the only one who answers this way, but:<br>  <br>  Robert Downey Jr.<br>  <br>  He was AMAZING in Tropic Thunder.  And it's such an honor for him to be nominated in this type of film because they are NEVER nominated for academy awards.<br>  <br>  Since I know he won't win.. I think my second choice would be Josh Brolin<br>  <br>  I think that the others did great too, but Heath Ledger will probably get it even though, honestly he wasn't the best. I think he is an amazing actor and he brought new life to an old role, but I don't think he was the best in this category|`|1YV3e1ZEaa	I, for one, think it is so tough to decide this year.<br>  <br>  Phillip Seymour Hoffman is an amazing actor. And Doubt was a great movie. Very thought provoking. <br>  <br>  Heath Ledger obviously did an amazing job as The Joker. Especially for being such a shy, introvert type person. It's amazing how well he played someone the complete opposite of his own personality so well.<br>  <br>  And Revolutionary Road was the best movie I have seen in a very, very, long time. Mr. Shannon was incredible in his short part. One of the first characters in a long time that I wished was in the movie way more than he was.<br>  <br>  So, I really can't decide between those three. That being said, Josh and Robert did a wonderful job, too.<br>  <br>  And, regardless of who deserves it the most, my bet is that it goes to Heath.|`|XJRYAhZVaa	I am stuck between Josh Brolin and Heath Ledger. Both did amazing performances but....I feel like Heath put more into his role and really got into it which sorta lead to his death. In an interview he talked about how this role was disturbing and how it was hard for him to sleep.<br>  <br>  I am not saying just because he died he should get it...but, I feel in many ways that he deserves it.|`|MRoF4VO3aa	I've only seen three of the nominated performances so far (Josh Brolin, Robert Downey Jr., and Heath Ledger), but Heath is my favourite, and will likely win.|`|ieiseiv4aa	I'd like RD Jr win, but Ledger will most likely win it

ioNTTqKfaa	How many Lil Wayne questions are there on here? He's brought up here more than any other rapper. I state my opinion on here because y'all keep bringing him up. If you stop talking about him, I'll stop hating on him.<br>  <br>  And I agree with what HHRC said. His stans are the most annoying people on the planet and are probably responsible for 90% of the hate he gets. He wasn't getting hated a year ago because those fans weren't being annoying. (Plus there are a bunch of borderline trolls on here like ATL who ask questions intentionally to get people riled up)<br>  <br>  EDIT: you are one of the few fans who can actually form a cohesive argument. Most of his fans on here are as unintelligent as the so-called haters you describe. If more of his fans were like you, he wouldn't be getting nearly as much hate.|`|1lvyUwo7aa	I don't hate on Lil Wayne fans...I PRAY for them. I feel bad for them because they haven't found out about music with lyrics that have a point to them! So God BLESS you with some Real Hip-Hop with a point to it.|`|oJfBZ8wOaa	who the **** is gonna read this|`|bc92692e5171a576e30283eb2faec88eaa	Yeah, I'm not even gonna bother reading that... <br>  <br>  I don't hate Lil Wayne, I hate the dickriders that come on here and don't let us forget that they know what Lil Wayne's penis tastes like.|`|TrPySdXFaa	u think ima rea dis big *** ***** essay and **** <br>  <br>  i only id it 4 2 pts haha<br>  <br>  stop whining!!!|`|9wUrbqT3aa	Would u like some bread with your Whine....?|`|OpBFc27iaa	you are the one whining.|`|5dc42237ea103510238126df59d3a8daaa	The reason they get mad is because not only is a a talentless idiot making millions doing something that should be done by someone that actually knows anything about what tey are doing. It's because he is contributing to the influencing of the next generation to put out this wack here today gone tomorrow B.S. Most people now adays don't even know what the foundation is or what it sounds like. The people that are whining  about lil wayne probably take this **** more serious than you. WU- TANG!|`|ArzbT9pzaa	Oh but he IS gay :) Bahaha!<br>  <br>  I whine because of the Lil' Gayne Stans that are all like, 'Oh he sold a million in a week' like he's the first person who's ever done that, lol. Eminem (a better rapper) sold nearly twice that - 1.7mil in a week with The Marshall Mathers LP, but do you see me ejaculating over it? NO.|`|b232ef03f269af8ca3e7e8e02c2b57ddaa	I personally don't like Lil Wayne a lot, but I agree. I personally don't like him because whenever I used to hear him rap, he would say some random **** that wouldn't make a lick of sense, and just leave me stranded trying to make sense of it. A lot of his own fans agree that he does that a lot because he always records when he's baked (going by fans' words on that one) so he might get a little retarded at times. <br>  <br>  True, some people on here hate on Lil Wayne a lot, calling him names and slandering his reputation and whatnot. Some just blame him for destroying Hip Hop, even thought no one thing or person could single-handedly destroy Hip Hop. <br>  <br>  However, some of us just get tired of reading about how some people think Lil Wayne is the best thing ever without providing and real evidence to support (lines, songs, albums other than Tha Carter III, or anything else they can legitimately relate to) their opinion, and then just call us haters because we disagree. He's also one of the many rappers keeps talking about how much money while the rest of the nation has none.<br>  <br>  If you think Lil Wayne is the best, that's fine. If you want me to agree with you, however, you've got to say something other than "He says he 's the best" or "Go listen to his best-selling album Tha Carter III. It sold 1,000,000 the first week so it must be good!". You lumped all the people who don't like Lil Wayne together. I can only speak for myself but I'm much less likely to come around to something if everybody I see oversells it but complains when I don't like it.|`|gJoVBtnqaa	you know, it's funny how you're talking about us whining but at the same time, you're whining about us.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Read Havoc M, probably the best comment here|`|xUxUwloPaa	I share your sentiment.<br>  <br>  Many people who denounce Lil Wayne as a musician don't hate his music, they hate his fans. There are a large pack of "stans" that swear that Lil Wayne is the best thing to happen to hip hop since KRS-ONE. These fans need to stop. I have also seen posts on this site such as; "I wish Lil Wayne was dead." or "Lil Wayne doesn't make any good music." and none of these are true/necessary.|`|oKckkzz9aa	LEt me say this, I do not hate!<br>  <br>  But Havoc has  a point he robs lyrics from some of my favorite rappers.|`|zLBDmcsnaa	word.|`|U7Dd1mVFaa	about time someone said this i mean like dang people really do be doin dat and i was looking at what other people said someone said dat dey dont like him cuz he says he is the best rapper alive lil wayne didnt give himself dat title MTV gave lil wayne dat title so dont come around here wit da bull nd havoc m shut da hell up if you dont like lil wayne for dat den you dont like a whole lot of artist becuz in da hip hop world dat is called sampling if you aint know nd a whole lot of people do dat so does dat make dem fake??? nd plus most of da people who say lil wayne is da best rapper alive wasnt born in dat generation wit all dat tribe called west or sum stuff like dat nd sum of yall say lil wayne is taking away from hip hop out of all yall favorite rappers in da best 10 years please tell me how many of them sold a milli nd a week i can use 1 hand ta count dat on nd i know for a fact dat all yall wont say it to lil waynes face so yall jus some triflin people im thru|`|bmv05Tk6aa	I understand where you're coming from.<br>  <br>  I personally can't stand Lil Wayne, but not for a simple reason.<br>  <br>  <br>  When a person WHO HATES "Hip-Hop" because of what they hear on the radio/MTV, I start to "hate" on Lil Wayne...because he said he's the best alive, and those who don't know much about rap/Hip-Hop probably accept that statement. They'll never see the deeper meaning behind the music and culture, because meaningless raps are all that they've been exposed to. He sort of represents the commercial ideas that overshadow true Hip-Hop.<br>  <br>  I'll admit, he is sort of the "scapegoat" for all of the (I hate saying this >) mainstream, but that's because he's put himself at the head of the Dumb-Down movement hahaha<br>  <br>  Make any sense?? I dunno, I tried lol.<br>  <br>  I guess a lot of 'em "whine" because they are pissed at how Hip-Hop always has this negative aura around it now, and they/we want the true essence revealed.|`|hQbUwLvwaa	Lil Wayne has stole so many peoples lyrics, like biggie smalls, jay z, and eve alyiah. He also doesnt even write his lyrics. His lyrics make no sense, he mumble when he raps, all he raps about is how good and how rich he is. Hip hop isnt about money oor boasting, u might know that if you were a true fan of hip hop. So all these ignorant people like you saying he is the best rapper alive and buying his albums is like taking a **** on the face of hip hop, it is the biggest disgrace in music history and why so many people hate rap, cuz they listen to gay **** like lil wayne and never hear good hip hop like tribe called quest, rakim, nas. etc.|`|jhMkBqk7aa	We whine because people like you automatically assume he is the GOAT despite having very little talent.  He shows no ability to make a decent metaphor, his rhyme structure is basic, his rhymes aren't deliberate he just chooses words that rhyme even if they don't make sense, his punch lines are elementary, and he is incapable of social commentary what so ever.  Listen to Lupe for rhyme structure and metaphors and Talib Kweli for social commentary.  I think one of the reasons people think Wayne is so good is because everything he says is easy to understand even for the mentally retarded as opposed to Lupe who raps about a giant robot that is actually a metaphor for a project building.|`|wfZhkZO0aa	Umm, this isn't English Composition guy you don't need to write me an essay.

yjSGVfdiaa	This is how I read the newspaper every day.<br>  <br>  There's clearly an intent here. And this was before the existence of 24-hour celebrity surveillance in the forms of reality television, E!, and TMZ.  Although, at this point the "anti-paparazzi" song has been done to death by teen starlets.<br>  This is different though - I'm not putting this in the same category, because those girls would hate it if the paparazzi stopped following hem - they would no longer have any continued relevance. <br>  This is a similar statement, but more absurd, and more appreciated in it's subtle expression.  <br>  <br>  The second part is fun, and especially interesting in juxtaposition with the lilting lullaby of the first.<br>  <br>  I look forward to what this is setting up.|`|9RTuRPviaa	I can't get the video to load!

But, as with a lot of acoustic, folky, singer/songwriter stuff, I'd have to hear more of it in order to really lay down an opinion. I'll have to put them on my list.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	HI! Great song makes me want to lay out in the hammock, with a nice cold drink and a cool breeze. Thanks for the feeling<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|nYqtw9DWaa	Hey there Kristy, how are you? :)<br>  <br>  That was a good song, I like it!|`|AA12301664	haven't i heard this before somewhere?<br>  <br>  i like it.<br>  hits the spot - beautifully<br>  <br>  :)

Most rock music has a lot of guitar/drums/bass in it.  It wouldn't be that hard to find.  But whatever I'll help you.  My first suggestion is Avenged Sevenfold.  Best band IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Okay uh... Metalica, trapt, seether, rise against.  if you want A LOT A LOT of guitar then go for Dragonforce.  way way way fast.  Good?
Klw3Ke3Haa	I am not sure but you can probably try a blog site or use the power of google to find plenty of useful and helpful sites for you to use. Good Luck!
TT0rCi8kaa	A Gorgon, is Aunty, when poked,<br>  as the Baddest of Beasts often joked,<br>  she's a bit of a dish,<br>  but she smells like a fish,<br>  (which is weird, 'cos she looks like a Goat!)|`|UnEQAsEEaa	Gorgon, darling.

2i6TPlauaa	John Cale and Melt-Banana, you are now on! Wait, Cale is too busy 'aving his way with them in the bathroom, hence the moaning wails. I see E.T. is back, and he brought the aliens from "Close Encounters..." with him. It sounds as though we are in a car going 1,000 miles an hour and we are just zipping past everything. And Jonny Greenwood is still there...does anything kill him and his self-indulgent ways? It does mellow a bit in part four, though; like a demented lullaby hummed by Charles Manson or a possessed music box, courtesy of John Wayne Gacy. Or a ringing phone (the British kind) played at different pitches? Fantastic, in an 'I am not even going to act like I actually understand this kind of way'. Superb. I love it.

blqaXArhaa	I have the PERFECT idea for you! Do you have itunes? If you do, download Genius. ( it's free ) It's like a mini DJ because once your listening to a song, click on the Genius icon and a playlist will appear with songs that go perfect with the one you selected.
WSUzvYtsaa	Yes, but it was OK because I fetched my wife to get rid of it. One of the reasons I perhaps shouldn't have divorced her.|`|VI2LzM7taa	Yeah, I hate spiders and they always corner me in the shower. I have to get out, put a towel on, and then try to push it down the drain with the water from the shower head. Once it's in the drain, I hold the water over it for a couple of minutes so it won't crawl back up!|`|mYeq5AvFaa	yeah i killed it before i took the shower|`|mfMBPPn9aa	I once saw a centipede/millipede (I don't know the difference) sitting right in the middle of the tub after I pulled the shower curtains to the side. I refused to shower until my dad got rid of it. Lol|`|RaLiLTT9aa	No, but I've seen them throughout my home. And spiders freak me out too, I can't stand them.|`|AA10196709	No, but I did see one on my bed once...I killed it but I was so freaked out when I went to bed that night! I thought I felt stuff crawling all over me...and then of course my stupid brain decided to remember the  obscure fact that you swallow approximately 3 spiders a year in your sleep...<br>  <br>  Ugh, I did not sleep for a few days...|`|Y8fDJcekaa	Yes its so freaking scary!!!!!!!! but i wack it until it dies with soap and then go up stairs to take my shower (just in case it layed eggs :)   )|`|y7lUgd3aaa	Yes it has but I wasnt in it thank god!  I was sitting on the toilet and happened to see one crawl out of the drain.  I would have been so scared if I was in there.  I hate bugs|`|MuyCChKaaa	Gosh, yes! And I screamed. I was so frightened, that I fell back into the curtain and knocked it down!<br>  Very, very Embarrassing ((to myself))|`|NBi07o6zaa	Yeah, sometimes. Usually they come from your body or just from outside the bathroom.<br>  <br>  Ugh, I hate spiders.|`|rCnYXtqTaa	I have seen a spider in the shower once. I just waited till he was done toweling off and then took mine. I hope he did crawl on your barefeet!|`|AA10745377	yes. it was the scariest experience of my life.|`|mKmjBEVUaa	OH FUDGE YEAH dude i cry when ever i  see a bug any bug lol... but seriously i have a insectaphobia if thats what u call it and aracnaphobia|`|KDD3OfrUaa	its happened to everyone, buddy.|`|AA11609300	Yes I have.  I just splashed it with water and huddled in the corner until it went down the drain.|`|VvTY8dHNaa	Yeah. I just throw some water on it and back out of the way until I see it go down the drain.|`|LSXdwRDUaa	Like Twice in my whole life. It was  on the ceiling and when i looked up. I Freaked out|`|OLtP7mupaa	Haha!<br>  Not really...<br>  Well one appeared in the bath just as I was about to get in and it was huuge!!!<br>  Like the legs were massssively long!!!<br>  =]|`|j6poSs16aa	yeah I have, and it was one of those "daddy longleg" spiders|`|iHVU9Ffpaa	ive seen them in my bathroom but not while i was taking a shower i can see how it would scare you!|`|j92keMANaa	yes|`|UdemZ27caa	yes & i screamed.|`|nucQYOf3aa	Yep...It was creepy...!|`|9Epea6vaaa	yes it freaked me out i opened up my eyes and seen a blur hang at the tip of my nose and then i screamed jumped back|`|QkzxVTikaa	Yeah, but it didn't scare me because I killed it instantly.|`|49GfjLhqaa	lol yeah it scared the sh*t outta me|`|FoIxsunVaa	It is an old Irish superstition that the spider represents the Irish mother (who stereotypically was always spinning LACE.) So to kill a spider is like stepping on a crack, in American superstition.<br>  <br>  Once time, after a very nasty visit with my parents in Florida, I came home and suddenly found a spider in my shower with me. I killed it without a second thought.<br>  <br>  I guess it was a really bad trip to Florida.|`|c7ad7b42e9c7f9eddfdacceddd9f9287aa	yes but not recently.. i've also seen a frog in the shower|`|YmtNel5haa	Omg! I have a story, a few years ago I worked at a Stewarts shop (gas, coffee, ice cream) the bathroom was outside.  I told the person I was working with I had to go and I be right back.  I got in covered the seat and hovered when this ugly huge brown spider came dangling down in front of me.  It was almost like it knew I wasn't fond of spiders, the way it just dangled up and down.  I screamed at the top of my lungs.  within like 2 minutes a policeman opened the door and I had my pants down!!! I quickly pulled them up.  He bawled me out for yelling when it was just a spider.  But he did kill the spider.<br>  I feel guilty for killing them, but I hate spiders.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	Yes! And I screamed really loud.|`|rtucR0Vhaa	Yes I have. Spiders are soo ICKY!!!!|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Yes.|`|tDU347knaa	Yes. It doesn't bother me.<br>  <br>  My son, however, is a different story. He's absolutely hilarious, because here's this nearly six foot tall fourteen-year old boy running down the hallway screaming "kill it, kill it" at the top of his lungs. I laughed so hard!|`|Vh9P5P60aa	No, but every so often one of those slimy little silverfish crawl out of<br>  the drain, and if I catch one, I squirt bleach on it, watch it dissolve<br>  into a tiny puddle of crud, and then wash it back down the drain.|`|AA10716061	Not that I can recall|`|rcHnA1iQaa	YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS|`|Orx9cTJJaa	No, I always knock.|`|G1lSbvAQaa	yes and I throw water on it and watch it twirl around and eventually fall in the drain. woot|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	um yes. every house whether you see them or not, is filled with bugs.|`|wzue5Xzbaa	Yes.

HA3CUl0Jaa	Based on the guitar, I'm guessing you play hard rock or metal, and from the problems, you're looking for a metal pickup with alot of clarity. Well I've got just the thing for you! I know a guy at my guitar center who popped these into his Ibanez and they've been working like a charm:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.guitarcenter.com/Seymour-Duncan-SH-13-Dimebucker-Pickup-101639623-i1127412.gc" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitarcenter.com/Seymour-Dunc...</a><br>  <br>  You can never go wrong with Duncan. Good Luck!|`|XzjNsij2aa	^ thats not a neck pickup<br>  <br>  He was right about seymour duncan pickups though. But get the SH11 Jazz.

1vCoaf08aa	Seeing as how mental issues, such as paranoia are a real problem.<br>  <br>  And cutting yourself and dressing like a moron is a retarded fad that has swept jr. high's all around America.<br>  <br>  I'd have to say no.|`|RxVvNvX8aa	"Eleanor Rigby" by The Beatles, though not emo was the first commercially successful song to deal with depression, lonliness, and death. So in a way The Beatles created emo rock.|`|NQ3XZElFaa	If you mean emo as in the genre that bands like Cap'n Jazz and Sunny Day Real Estate belong to, then no. "Paranoid" just doesn't have the hardcore punk influence.<br>  <br>  If you mean "emo" as in the genre that bands like My Chemical Romance and Fall Out Boy belong to, then no. "Paranoid" isn't mediocre pop punk.<br>  <br>  If you mean "emo" as in anything sad, then no. There has been sad music before "Paranoid."<br>  <br>  Emo (well real emo) music is perfectly valid, and it's too bad that a lot of stupid kids have corrupted the name of something that they don't even know exists and that because of those stupid kids, a lot of relatively intelligent people bash something that they don't really understand.<br>  <br>  By the way, Morrisey had nothing to do with emo.|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	So basically what your saying is that no one can write about anything sad or angry in music without being emo. Emo music is whiny, not just sad. Real stuff happens, like paranoia for instance and bands should be able to write about it and not be called emo by dumb people like you.|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	Next thing they'll be saying that Hammer Smashed Face by Cannibal Corpse was the 1st pop-punk song ever.|`|JyxNA1o0aa	You just f*cking insulted my God Ozzy Osbourne. HOw is Paranoid "emo"?!|`|uomYVsiLaa	Sabbath = Heavy metal nothing else but the love of metal! Been around probably longer then you and most of the people who answered this question! Emo is a made up brand of crap from a generation of punk rockers that wouldn't know a good song if it smacked them in the face. This other dude said it best with Elanor rig-by from the Beatles as the closest thing produced before people got so delusional about brands of music and had to separate different kinds of rock to make up a hundred different names for it to make them selves feel important!|`|kP0JGI1waa	wow i don't want to be harsh here but you are way off, my friend.  emo is about whining about your personal problems.  black sabbath's heavy slow power chords and lyrics created DOOM METAL, not emo music.  If anything, it was Candlemass's Solitude can be considered a slight bit of emo with the words "please let me die in solitude."<br>  <br>  Please do not associate my favorite band with emo music haha.|`|ObeBvtzgaa	That's an insult to Black Sabbath, Dio, Ozzy, and rock/metal in general in my opinion lol.<br>  They are NOT emo, and that song is NOT emo.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	this is the first emo song:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0hTtsqiFCc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0hTtsqiF...</a>|`|U48HUZ5Kaa	The thing I hate about kids nowadays is that to them anything different is automatically emo!

Least of which is the song Paranoid. Maybe had you said Sweet Leaf or The Wizard, but Paranoid? <br>  No Paranoid was not the first Emo song, all Emo is directly the fault of Morrisey or possibly Donovan.|`|WbMxgSXLaa	maybe the first METAL song ever, but heck no, it's NOT emo! I don't think I wanna cut myself while listening to Black Sabbath, I wanna headbang, that means its metal|`|y1xPK3Txaa	No....no....no.<br>  <br>  You should have to get a license to have an opinion.<br>  <br>  Did you seriously call the basis for generations of doom metal emo?|`|qUDas0R4aa	HELL NO!!!! black sabbath is not emo they are classic metal, big big BIG difference. Paint it black by The Rolling Stones might be considered the first emo song i guess|`|oeZodAyeaa	FUUUUUUUUUUUKK YOU! PLEASE JUST FUKKING DIE!

NQ37mnWkaa	Good afternoon, Prof :)<br>  {It's now Saturday ~ I'm late again!}<br>  <br>  I've seen you mention Dr. dog before, but this is the first time I've heard them, and it's really fitting with the 'nostalgia' mood I've been in this last week ~ there's a real early 1980's / late 1970's vibe running through my house right now {even though I wasn't alive in the 70's!}, and having played it once, I've just put it on again :)<br>  Reminds me a little of Wings...<br>  <br>  <br>  As for Paul simon, my favourite album is "Graceland" {thanks mum!}. <br>  Favourite song, however, is much more difficult, as I also like his work with Art Garfunkel. So...<br>  Solo : 'I Know What I Know' <br>  With AG : 'Scarborough Fair', '59th Street Bridge Song' and 'The Sound of Silence'|`|IatEdBpvaa	Hey Prof, hope you're doing great man!<br>  <br>  What's not to like?  Maybe it's not the most original thing out there but it's real freakin' catchy.  I like it, puts you in that kick-back mode where you just watch the world go by.  And lyrical-wise, it could be a great example for the soundtrack of life.<br>  <br>  Two thumbs up, more if I had extra hands!<br>  <br>  And favorite Paul Simon track?  I think you know this one - The Only Living Boy In New York.  And for the second, make it America.  Another great song although as far as I'm concerned, he never did anything bad.<br>  <br>  You as well.  I hope it treats you right.<br>  <br>  Hey Mr B., life's kind of up and down right now but I'm doing the best that I can and that's what counts.  Hope all is great with you!|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	Hey Prof Anger!<br>  <br>  Thanks for posting these links.  I enjoyed them all of them.  <br>  <br>  PS: You can re-add me if you want. See my profile.|`|0cc7b69ea6b5f359aa006de2a67d9086aa	Hi Prof, <br>  <br>  Loved it!!!<br>  <br>  Hey was that John and George on backup vocals? Yeah, they got that "Beatles backup" right on the money.  The intermediate bass sounds great.  The drums? Hmm...probably recorded in an elevator shaft like "The Who"?  These guys sound very 60's.  Kind of the intersection of Beatles and The Beach Boys.  <br>  <br>  Hi Huevo, doing okay, today? <br>  <br>  I will be definitely adding some of their songs to my  collection.   Any recommendations for starters?|`|Rmy8bWnsaa	Hey Prof, great song. I picked up their most recent album, Fate, a while ago and loved it. I really like their sound, I agree it's very retro. Favorite Paul Simon record is Graceland, of course!

Even when they're joking around, it's of the deadpan variety. In fact, plenty of very humorous people have Capricorn Ascendants. It's all in the timing...and the fact that they don't giggle before the joke is over. <br>  <br>  Capricorn Ascendant people project competence. They simply ooze it. They're generally very image-conscious people--the clothes they wear and their manner are a big deal to them. They want to appear successful, and they generally succeed! <br>  <br>  Often the Ascendant persona is the one that was forced upon us by family conditioning. For example, parents may label their Libra Ascendant child the "nice" one; their Aries Ascendant child the "independent" one; and their Pisces Ascendant child is generally the space cadet of the family. We adopt these roles as familiar ones, and often carry them with us as our defense mechanisms, in some way or another, for the rest of our lives. In the case of Capricorn Ascendants, these were the children who were considered the responsible ones. Sometimes, it was they themselves who looked around them and felt the need to be the structured, dependable, and responsible members of the family. So, often, Capricorn rising people adopted a strong sense of tradition, family, and responsibility at a very young age.<br>  <br>  Capricorn rising people are generally big on family, and forever worry about security--for themselves and their dependents. They come across to others as hard-working, competent, and dependable people. What others may not see under that cool, even suave, exterior, is an inner struggle: they often ask themselves, "Am I doing enough?", "Do I deserve all of this?", "How can I make things better?" They worry a lot about the future.<br>  <br>  If success seemed to have come easy to these folks, it hasn't. They just made it look that way with a patient, hard-working, driven personality. Some Capricorn rising people practice some form of self-denial. They know how to do away with the frivolous. Still, they'll spend money on the clothes they really want (the ones with the right labels, that is), and other status symbols. Although they're rarely showy, their quiet air of success is often a result of conscious effort.<br>  <br>  More often than not, Capricorn rising individuals are success stories. Their childhoods may have been difficult, but they slowly but surely turn their lives around. Saturn rules this Ascendant, and this generally means a kind of backwards way of living--as children, they are serious and bear a lot of responsibility; and as they grow up, they age beautifully, learning how to loosen up. More on Capricorn Rising.<br>  <br>  MOON LIBRA:<br>  <br>  Those with the Moon in Libra have a breezy elegance that makes them sought-after companions. Their aesthetic standards are high, and they can’t help but turn their homes into showplaces, since they have such an eye for decorative harmony. This often translates into a tranquil domestic life as well, since they also know how to create an atmosphere of peaceful balance.<br>  <br>  There’s a light, airy quality to the Libra Moon nature that can be refreshing, especially in times when they're forced to put their nimble diplomacy into action. They know that there are two sides to every story, and they’re experts at finding a workable compromise. People often sense their innate fairness, and this leads them to win the trust of many.<br>  <br>  It’s natural for the Libra Moon to share, whether in a business relationship or in romance. They are happiest when part of a twosome, but sometimes this leads to a stifling dependence. If faced with a separation of any kind, they could act as if they’re very existence is threatened. That’s because more than any other Moon sign, their emotional identity is shaped by their relationships with others.<br>  <br>  The Libra Moon can claim to be a true “people person” because they often use the mirror of others to understand their own natures. But Libra is an air sign, and inhabiting the Moon, it often leads with the head, rather than the heart.<br>  <br>  To hear them talk about a potential mate might sound like they're interviewing for a job. But a focus on the lifestyle, appearance and manner of a person ranks high for someone looking for a pleasing overall package. They’re searching for someone they can glide with through life in glorious tandem while looking as polished and put-together as they are – in a word, perfection both inside and out.|`|B7WIZdglaa	<a href="http://www.0800-horoscope.com/birthchart.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.0800-horoscope.com/birthchart...</a>|`|cLgwmcfwaa	you can e-mail me and i will help you put whatever info you find on that link together.

5uvTte8Zaa	I got totally lost in the links you posted. So much I forgot what I was gonna say. Thanks for asking this question. Really good one.<br>  <br>  It's hard for me to seperate the individuals from the bands. It's also hard for me to compare them, I love them both so much. And every time I get started, a freakin customer comes up or the phone rings...<br>  <br>  First of all, Killing Is My Business is one of my favorite albums of all time. I get into it way more than just about anything out there.<br>  Apart from KIMB, I prefer Chuck. Especially Scream Bloody Gore and The Leprosy. Back in the day listening to it was eerie, almost scary. He was so way ahead of his time. Megadeth, as much as I like 'em, got very mainstream sounding right away with Peace Sells. Not that I don't enjoy it cause I do, it's just more of a novelty to me when I listen to Death. And it's way more brutal.<br>   I agree with you, everything up to and including Individual Thought Patterns has killer vocals plus ALL the music is right up my alley. <br>  <br>  The hardest part of answering your question was leaving the profanity out of it. If you were standing here in the room, I'd probably get up on my soap-box and preach a 45 minute sermon and use f**k every other word while yelling like an old-time Pentacostal preacher.<br>  <br>  I'm passionate about some Death and Megadeth.<br>  Overall I prefer Chuck to Dave, mostly for the pure Brutality and Gore but also his music is more technical to boot. Almost early math-metal if you will.|`|rFBypeEfaa	Hmmmm... I love both of these bands.<br>  <br>  I think Death's music is the more intricate of the two.<br>  <br>  I've met both guys at shows, and Chuck was definitely far more personable than Dave (and I didn't have to buy merchandise for admittance to a meet-and-greet like I did for Megadeth; Death were just hanging out by the video games at the venue...)<br>  <br>  So yeah, Chuck.<br>  <br>  Love Dave's work too, though.|`|eRVRWwkBaa	Dave Mustaine artistically better I believe. I think he could have been so much better if drugs & alcohol weren't his demons.<br>  Chuck Schuldiner may have an edge over Mustaine technically/guitar<br>  As for bands > Megadeth >Symphony of Destruction|`|76d0f42b082dd7b4403317013a48817eaa	I would have replied quicker, but I was enjoying the links. Thanx<br>  <br>  MA: I think Chuck was better but I dig Mega-Dave more.<br>  <br>  BA: That is a tossup.|`|7nkQyM0Laa	Too close to call. They are both great bands and great vocalists/guitarists.<br>  One is thrash/heavy metal, the other is death/progressive death metal.<br>  This does include Control Denied?<br>  The only difference is that Mustaine is still able to release more material.|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	Damn you for making such a hard question! lol<br>  <br>  MQ: It's really hard for me to pick between either of them. I love Chucks voice but I love Dave's too and the same goes for on the guitar.<br>  If I have to pick between them for who I like better I say Dave but they are so close to each other for me. <br>  <br>  BQ: I say Dave for this one. But again, very close for me. I think they both had great musicians to work with.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you can't already tell from my answer, I'm a big fan of both bands.|`|TBZK5q78aa	David Mustaine hands down... ( I also don't know much about the other guy...)<br>  <br>  By the way may I add that he is ranked #2 as the best guitarists according to Rolling Stones....<br>  <br>  BA: Again Dave because he was the former lead guitarist for Metallica so I think that's a pretty good group to work with... Too bad it didn't last long...|`|wNbK0i9Naa	Chuck Schuldiner is another name of God <br>  Honestly i dont think there is any comparison between two Chuck is far ahead then Dave .Chuck was a Guy who cared only about intense extreme metal right from Mantas days to Control Denied who was careless of money aspect who stayed true to what he believed .technically much better equipped .guy who pioneered the Death Metal Genre .bar was raised with each subsequent album even though later albums weren't as raw as Scream Bloody Gore but still brutal and musically far more superior then their precede .guy who never compromised on music .  honestly tron i don't think chuck mellowed down on music as much as mustaine did even sound of perseverance was quite extreme .yeah its other fact that chuck took totally different after leprosy which was last album where he talked about gore.later on putting far more emphasis on technicality then brutality trying to incorporate jazz with metal result you can see with Human one of the best record in progressive death metal can be argued with unquestionable presence by atheist by far more superior then anything by dave did with megadeth<br>  <br>  on the other hand Dave yeah i wont deny all the albums t`ll Rust in peace were good but what happened afterwards band turned out into nothing more then money grasper mustaine turned it into some kinda joke trying to please masses with pathetic sloppy albums one after another even ended up creating a pop album in form of risk.calling it as disco wont be inappropriate .even albums after risk are below average <br>  <br>  when you compare  chuck`s vocals  were intense full of power and emotion much suited to music .<br>  .where as mustaine vocals are as irritating as it can get its a torture on ear drums <br>  <br>  <br>  even when you compare their writing capablity chuck`s lyrics were far more practical something that everyone can relate themselves with  . through his lyrics there was a sense of social awareness i guess anyone who has listen to death albums would know what im talking about .Chuck was a Philosopher<br>  <br>  primary focus on all death albums were multiple guitar riffs .each and every song had that memorable solo which you cant get out of your head which were supported by incredible drumming by some of the best drummers and guitarist in the business  (Paul Masvidal ,Andy LaRocque, James Murphy ,Ralph Santolla...honestly this list is much better then megadeth ) <br>  <br>  MASTER............R.I.P|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	Chuck S. hands down.<br>  <br>  Dave M. has good skills but Chucks skills are more technically orientated. Chuck also stuck to his guns and delivered killer technical riffage every single album up to the day he passed away.<br>  <br>  With Dave he delivered from KIMB up to Rust In Peace. Countdown was okay but not really technical at all, and anything post Countdown is garbage to me, Lame Metal at its finest no offense to hardcore Megadeth fans|`|1vCoaf08aa	Chuck is the better guitarist of the two.<br>  <br>  MA: Chuck, but I like Megadeth better<br>  BA: Dave, I remember watching my Death & Raw, Live In LA DVD the other day, and Shannon Hamm's (I think that's his name) solo was the most useless thing I've ever seen, all it was was simple trills with the whammy bar.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Chuck but, Dave gets the job done.<br>  And I to like Megadeath better overall I think they are the better band.|`|MXjvZMUXaa	Dave.|`|cUjcn2lsaa	Tough call. I'll go with Dave Mustaine.|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Man... this is tough.<br>  <br>  I happen to love both bands immensely, and respect what both accomplished.<br>  <br>  Plus it is hard nto to let some emotion bias me on this, as Chuck was a really really cool person, and Dave, well, we all know about Dave and playing well with others.<br>  <br>  <br>  For the most part, I think I would give the edge inactual Rhythm parts to Chuck, and as much as I never thought I would say it.. vocally, to Dave.<br>  <br>  Neither are exactly what I would call vocal powerhouses, ya know?<br>  <br>  For total musical package, I think I might actually give MegaDdetht he Edge over Death.  I like Death more overall, but I think I probably do listne to more Megadeth tracks in total than Death.<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't think your comparison is terribly offbase at all.  People forget, that the type of Death Metal Chuck played wasn't really THAT different from Thrash.  It ain't like we are comparing Bolt Thrower to Metallica or something.

Priyadarshan is a good director. So movie would have come out good.  Story is simple.  A barber and a superstar (Shah Rukh plays himself) are thick friends in childhood days. But they later get separated while pursuing their own careers. On one day the actor comes to the barber's village for shooting some scenes for his film. How the barber initially hesitant, finally meets such a big star forms the rest of the story!

7iC8Fz3Naa	Hey awkwardgirl! Its a tough industry to break into and quite frankly what you experienced with the modeling casting isn't unusual. I think its best that you didn't take it because they are often scams trying to play off your hopes and dreams. If you want to get into the industry the best way is to get yourself seen by as many people as possible via the internet. There are talent sites where you can post pictures and video. Some even have talent scouts who will contact you if they think you have that special something. Best of luck.

One day when I own property and maybe have children i'd like to have a good amout of land to grow a garden and be able to allow my children to spend most of their time outside and yet safe from many bad influences. I'd rather take the risk that they hurt themselves climbing trees than pick up needles in the city park. (this happened with a kid I use to watch)<br>  <br>  I thought I would not like the city... but there is no way I'm going anywhere else right now, except maybe closer into town.

iBGkSg50aa	Don't worry about how cool it makes you, it's about what you want. Not what everybody else wants.<br>  <br>  But in my opinion, they're equally cool. Try out the trumpet! It's fun!|`|dJEQJ60Aaa	saxophone is way better. Cause technically you can play both the clarinet and the saxophone, from what someone told me when I played clarinet.|`|4nD0833laa	Stick with the Sax. I know people who played both, and very much prefered the Sax.<br>  <br>  I play French Horn, but I'd much rather play Saxaphone.<br>  <br>  GO WITH THE SAX!|`|X1y5fbohaa	sax is sexy|`|kwxcU3ohaa	Go with the trumpet, get good, and join a drum and bugle corps (all brass and percussion)|`|2tovXDGQaa	i used to play both, and personally i think that trumpet is better.<br>  But guitar beats all.=]|`|TdLuyP7Zaa	All the cool people play alto saxophone. Like me. :)|`|PDJjy0bPaa	I think saxophone is cooler than trumpet...never really a fan of brass<br>  <br>  Sounds like my situation.  I got bored of alto and switched to bassoon though.  If you wanna do trumpet, go for it.|`|sY1SjHeJaa	lol, really just play what you want, or what your good at. since you've played sax for 3 years, i'm sure youre good at it.<br>  <br>  though i wouldnt consider an instrument "cooler" (the coolest is when you play it the best) trumpets get solos in marching band shows, that sax's dont.<br>  Since youre not going to be the best at trumpet, so you probably wont be good enough to get the solo, i'd stick to sax. if youre in jazz band and are good at sax, you can get that solo.<br>  <br>  oh and if you're the worst trumpet player, no one is going to think you're cool.

Go to an agency but you might have to have a few changes with hair and that.   Im 12 by the way.

rRCTvT7Saa	I'd recommend learning standard tuning first...and I mean EVERY note on the fretboard.  Plus, Drop C just seems unnecessary!|`|kP0JGI1waa	drop C, thats it? grow some balls and drop it to A!<br>  <br>  Haha i am only kidding, i don't play guitar so I don't know the fine points of tuning it.|`|PeuFnqQwaa	Tune your low E string (thick one) to C.  If it is already tuned to E, you want to slacken the string off (loosen it) until the needle in your tuner is in the middle (440Hz) and the Note C is diplayed on the LCD screen.

The man tees off, and he skews it straight into the rough.<br>  "O CRAP, I've missed!" cries the man.<br>  The priest shakes his head at the man's outburst, but keeps his silence.<br>  It goes well for the next two holes until on the third green, the man completely misses an easy putt.<br>  "O CRAP, I've missed!" he again exclaims in frustration.<br>  Again the priest is stunned but retains his composure at the man's temper and language.<br>  They play on and the man's game slightly improves, until he gets trapped in a sand bunker on an easy course. He uses at least five shots getting out of the bunker, on the fifth he loses it again.<br>  "Would you believe it? CRAP CRAP I've missed it again!"<br>  This time the priest feels compelled to speak up. "I'm sorry, but if you do not refrain from using such horrible profanities on this wonderful day then the Lord will truly strike you down!"<br>  Just as he spoke, the clouds darkened, and a bolt of lightning came out of the sky, striking the priest dead!<br>  From the midst of the rolling clouds, a booming voice could be heard above: "O CRAP I missed him!"|`|hrsNTNk2aa	One very good joke:<br>  <br>  Three men decided to eat together. One of them was Japanese the second one was Chinese and the third one was a Pakistani. There was a rule that everyone should bring something. The Chinese bought two cans of Pepsi. The Japanese brought Chicken Roast. The Pakistani bought two more men with him. HA HA HA HA HA!<br>  <br>  Another one:<br>  <br>  A teacher said to his student use the word "ice" in a sentence. The student said "The water is cold". The teacher said "Where is the word "ice" in this sentence?". The student said "The word "ice" is melted". <br>  <br>  Another one:<br>  <br>  The patient said to the doctor 'My cough has stopped but my breathe is choking.' The doctor said 'Your cough has stopped and your breathe will also stop.'<br>  <br>  Another one:<br>  <br>  A teacher said to his student 'A big genius cannot answer the<br>  questions of Foolish'; The student said 'You are saying right Sir. That is why i am not able to answer your questions.'<br>  <br>  Another one:<br>  <br>  First Child: Today i got a coin of 50 rupees.<br>  Second child: That coin was mine.<br>  First Child: Very good I got two coins of 25 rupees each.<br>  Second Child:My coin would have fallen down and have been broken.|`|mZOt8oURaa	Mean but funny as hell!|`|39OVFs5Raa	OMG!

OMG its so worth it. College is like a sleep over everyday. You just have to study...lol P.S. one word of advice I have is to try to be reserved for a few days...and get to know people by observing them. That way you know who to hang out with and who to distant yourself with.

PJZ3M3N5aa	I totally agree...I cannot see this as a movie at all. Even Stephenie Meyer was worried about this because she mentions it on her official site...  ******  I've heard you say that you think Breaking Dawn should be two movies. Why? Also, that it might be impossible to film. What does that mean?        If Breaking Dawn were ever made into a movie, it's hard to imagine it fitting into ninety minutes. The book is just so long! I can't imagine how to distill itif I could, the book would be shorter. But maybe a screenwriter can see a way to do it and still cover the crucial plot points.        When I said that Breaking Dawn might be impossible to film, it's because of Renesmee. You can do almost anything with CGI these daysrealistic dragons and dinosaurs and endless amounts of nonexistent creatures that blend right in with the real elements. Some of them look so real you forget they're not. However, the one thing that I've never seen is a CGI human being who truly looks real. An actress can't play Renesmee, at least not when she's a few days old; she's the size of a baby, but her expressions are totally controlled and aware. She would have to be a construct, and CGI isn't quite there yet. Of course, they develop amazing new technologies everyday, and we've got a little time left.  ******|`|o52pOyzKaa	there's a fan made trailer of all books    wanna look at it?    if you want, find it on youtube.com|`|dRCWdKBEaa	I don't know, I can't really imagine them doing it as a movie, it is a bit strange, and if they did, they would have to change a lot. I hope they don't make it into a movie, because (not because I don't like it) but I think they might spoil it.|`|7Cr2O7I4aa	Breaking dawn is such a great book, and i think it could deifnitely become a movie, but just not in the near future. summit entertainment and stephanie meyer might not make breaking dawn into a movie just yet, becuase of one of the reasons u mentioned. they are not sure that they cud have a baby that is that mature and alert as renesmee is. although they could deifintiely use specila effetcs and all that, it tkes away from the real beauty of the saga and the movies. i also think that kristen could play a pregnant woman, but i agree with you, the birth will be hard to do, if they decide to make breaking dawn a movie. as i was reading the book, though, i deinfitely saw a movie going on in my head, so i really hope they make it a movie, the best twilight one yet.|`|F7ubafH1aa	I heard that Stephenie Meyer said that it would have to be made into TWO movies. (My Robert Pattinson bio book) and that a lot of other people were saying that it possibly couldn't because of the content in it, and in my opinion would have to be like rated R or something. But I guess we'll see.|`|tOxkn5hQaa	whoa...  I've read it already and it is blahhh!  twilight is m0re interesting|`|Q7Ed9UHIaa	Yeah they can make it into a movie, they can cut A lot of the details out and still make it great!|`|8Bl3DvVqaa	i think Breaking Dawn could definitely be a movie.  Although I think it would have to be rated an 18 because of the Honeymoon and Bella giving birth to Renesmee, that would have to be a pretty gory scene.    But i agree with you on how they're going to have to do Renesemee, she won't be the same. and may ruin the movie.  But who knows? technology gets better every time so I do think that the directors and everyone will be able to pull it off by them time this film is made.|`|RKZHGqh7aa	I don't think the movies will make it that far, and I don't think Breaking Dawn would make a good movie. It's too farfetched (because the rest of the series is so realistic lol :-P).|`|UBHFJ01naa	I completely agree with you..  I mean, I love Breaking Dawn - it's a fantastic book, but I'm just worried about how it will translate into a movie.   I think Kristen Stewart is a good enough actress to play being pregnant, but the whole idea of it doesn't appeal to me.  Also, they  might have to cut out a LOT, and every part of BD is important (i feel). And if they make it into two movies, It might be a bit - cheesy?  Overall, I'm kinda excited, but scared at the same time!

ssoZ33XIaa	A legal site is the best way to go.  For free music that is legal to download, check out music.download.com.|`|71SjVwWNaa	you can download mp3's from youtube.com...or check with torrent sites...with torrents, the user has icons next to their name which say if they are a trusted member or a vip member, those are the one's that can be trusted|`|Q0dzzgomaa	I would suggest that instead of downloading from Rhapsody, Napster or Limewire, you use the Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter from www.dvdvideosoft.com for the following reasons:<br>  <br>  1) Sharing<br>  - With limewire, they want you to share the songs you download and the songs you have. Now you can turn this option off, but who wants to sit there for hours sifting through thousands of options for the sake of a couple of songs? With the software I recommended, you don't have to share sh*t (Excuse the language)<br>  <br>  2) Preview before you play<br>  - With limewire, you have to start downloading the song before you can preview it. Now this might not sound like a problem to most, but for people with super fast internet connections that can download songs at the speed of light, you won't have the time to preview it before it plays because it would be on your computer before your mouse could get anywhere near that play button. Now suppose it's a virus and not the song you wanted? You see, Youtube of course lets you play the video (they don't expect you to download, so playing the video is the only thing you can do), which not only allows you to check and see whether or not it's the right song, but you can check its quality as well. <br>  <br>  3) Virus Risks<br>  - See, Limewire downloads from other people's computers meaning that they could've downloaded that song from anywhere. So it could potentially be a virus. But ask yourself: when was the last time you heard about Youtube having a virus? Youtube performs maintanence nearly everyday, so even if they were to get a virus, they would detect it before it could do any serious damage to the site itself.  Plus, this is Google, the masters of coding/programming. Hell, they probably made their own anti virus software to scan the videos before they're actually uploaded. You have to realize: Google is a huge company. They wouldn't let some bad computer code cooked up by an amateur hacker destroy something they paid over $1 billion for. <br>  <br>  4) Settings<br>  - When you download Limewire for the first time, you don't automatically start downloading music. You have to first configure what seems like thousands of unnecessary settings. These range from turning it on and off as your torrent client, to the quality, to what types of files you would like to share (why is that even there?), to settings that talk about proxies (you're probably thinking "What the hell are proxies?"). Basically, it's too much of a hassle for those of us who simply want to download a couple of songs. Well, with the software I suggested, you only do four things:<br>  - Install<br>  - Select the folder<br>  - Select the quality<br>  - Download your songs<br>  <br>  5) Wider Variety of Music<br>  - True enough, Limewire, Napster and those other sharing sites have a pretty large collection of songs, but when it comes down to it, Youtube is the biggest. Admit it, every song that you couldn't find on Limewire or iTunes, you could easily find on Youtube. Not only new generation songs, but songs from commercials and old/new TV Shows, 80's hits, classic rock, Def Jam Poetry, exclusive remixes, underground rap, extremely rare tracks that you thought you would never find. You're in luck especially if you listen to Hip Hop or Rock simply because of the huge amount of remixes that can be found on Youtube. Most of which can't be found on Limewire, and certainly won't be found on iTunes. But you're thinking "I don't know how to download from Youtube!" Well, now you can. <br>  <br>  <br>  Now, for my last point (I'm almost done, stay with me), I would like to emphasize what I stated about sharing. Now even though Limewire claims to share only the folder you told it to, you have to understand the immense amount of skilled hackers there are. You see how people who have never even heard of Limewire get their computers hacked every day, and Limewire damn near provides the tools with all of this "folder sharing" business. Plus, Limewire shares your IP Address (just like torrents), which is basically the key to your internet connection. Basically, this program kicks Limewire's ***, but in case you need further proof, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages:<br>  <br>  Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter:<br>  <br>  Pros:<br>  1) Shares absolutely nothing, not even the IP Address. You're not required to share with anyone else.<br>  <br>  2) You don't have to configure 1000's of settings as soon as you start the software (as you do with limewire). You just pick the folder you want to save it to, and then start downloading<br>  <br>  3) No viruses.<br>  <br>  4) Preview before you play<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  n/a<br>  <br>  <br>  Limewire:<br>  Pros:<br>  - You can download free music<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  - Everything else<br>  <br>  Now as I said before, this software is completely free, and can be downloaded from www.dvdvideosoft.com|`|ObeBvtzgaa	I don't know of a place that is virus free and doesn't cost anything. <br>  But I also recommend buying CDs or paying for your downloads (example iTunes) if you must download.<br>  Downloading for free is stealing.|`|TzpYUWxoaa	iso hunt.com but there might be a virus on it so check the rates and check the comments to tell if there is or isn't one on there its illigal but eh its up to you|`|6c8c012e5f5de23c1d13e3d4ea286461aa	Im not sure if this is Illeagal or not<br>  but you might want to try limewire|`|BE1ntMkwaa	You could use lime-wire which is kinda illegal if you download it onto a CD but only if you get caught. Then there is imesh it's more private and you are more likely to be safe with downloading songs. Hope this helps! =)

Its great. Definitely worth seeing!|`|vh0yVJ7daa	I remember this movie as a kid still wouldn't mind watching it again all these years later id rate it an 8 out of 10,It's oldskool and will never die just wanna those movies that will always be around|`|AfbjU9Guaa	Great for the little kiddies, boring as hell for the big grown-ups!|`|B12rLQDAaa	It is particularly entertaining to kids, however, still as a near adult who has watched it again it is quite insightful to watch. The movie highlights racial integration (among many other things) by having the kids be the first generation to integrate with each other. The parents of the characters often take a "long necks travel and play with long necks, and tri horns with tri horns, spike tails with other spike tails" approach to live and this movie breaks that internal racial segregation barrier with child innocence/purity, just like what was starting to happen more and more in the US. The characters grow to accept each other and start to forget that each one of them is a different breed of dinosaur. Definitely watch the first one, I would rate it 10/10 stars as a kid, 9/10 stars as an adult. I wouldn't suggest taking the time to watch the whole series because i can't even remember what 2 through 6 were about, but the first one was unforgettable.

That would be a waste and silly...talking would be faster and easier than taking the time to text it.|`|AA11609300	I will if it's something I don't want anyone else in the room to hear.<br>  <br>  For instance, I'll text my husband that I'm ready to leave.|`|YrdUWtSCaa	Yes, if she doesn't say it out loud then she doesn't want you to hear...|`|A2iE43Enaa	yeah i do.<br>  but only if i want it to be secret from other people in the room.|`|KiDq2xNiaa	yes unfortunately its normal. no I don't do it, and I find it offensive when people call or text from less than 50ft away.|`|DHzwr1braa	Yeah its normal, she doesn't want you to hear her convo.|`|fP05U8Neaa	It's fun!

Either that or she just loves to text. But yeah it's completley normal don't worry.<br>  = )|`|xOKUpnZGaa	It is normal, Probably she is shy talking to her friends when you are around her.

cLgwmcfwaa	north node.<br>  i have the same thing<br>  <br>  North Node in Aquarius and/or in the Eleventh House<br>  <br>  With North Node in Aquarius, our South Node is in Leo. With North Node in the eleventh house, our South Node is in the fifth house.<br>  <br>  A tendency to become overly attached to the drama of romance and personal relationships, to be willful and overly focused on getting what we want, and to resist being "one of the crowd" in an effort to stand out as unique and special, are some of the issues this position suggests. With this position, we need to let go of our fears in relationships by offering freedom to our partners instead of expecting our partners to act as we want them to act, to accept that we are all equal and that we can still be special if we belong to a community, to move towards greater impartiality, and to cultivate sensitivity to the needs of others. By letting go of the strong desire of getting what we want in the here and now, satisfaction will come more easily as we find that we get what we need. Our personal relationships and romances will suffer when we take things too personally, and expect others to follow a certain script that we have unconsciously written for them. Learning to let go of the need for drama and attention, and moving towards a more objective approach to our lives, as well as cultivating true friendships, will help us to achieve a greater sense of balance. Our relationships with others—as well as our relationship with ourselves—will benefit.
cLgwmcfwaa	its not entirely important. Sun, Moon, Venus, Mercury, and Mars are the personal planets. the planets that affect your personality.<br>  <br>  Now, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune and Pluto are planets that affect your generation, but mean little to nothing about you specifically.<br>  <br>  however, because you asked, i will tell you... because i have the same thing, i know that Uranus in Capricorn means you are apart of a very rebellious generation which is rebellious in interesting ways.<br>  <br>  thats all i could ever find on it. i searched hard for a long time. We're just all more rebellious than those who came before us.

dSmoB64Yaa	Bob Wall did that for real and look what happened to him. On  the first take of the scene where Ohara is supposed to stab Lee with a broken bottle, Lee did a spin kick to Wall's hand and Wall failed to drop the bottle, when Lee's follow up punch came, he jammed his fist straight into the broken bottle that Wall was still holding. Bob Wall told Jim Kelly that Lee didn't kick his hand hard enough to make him drop the bottle. But that's why it's called acting, Bob! After the  incident, Lee was pretty angry, but he didn't do or say anything. He went and got his hand stitched up. A few days later, when they finished the scene, Lee kicked Wall so hard that a guy standing behind Wall, suffered a broken arm. When you watch Ohara fly back into the chairs, that kick was real. Lesson Learned? Don't try to stab Bruce Lee or he will kick your chest in.|`|qt2HMtLkaa	because he's bruce lee, nothing can stab and go through his body.<br>  <br>  besides he's too fast and evasive, so he doesnt get stabbed.|`|0a92a06fb2c7565638777b7ba8574ec0aa	...Because that would make for a terrible ending?<br>  <br>  Anyway, I suppose a thrust is more risky than a swipe, in terms of strategy.|`|BfmV2KpUaa	Same reason James Bond was never just shot in the head at the earliest oppurtunity by the bad guys.

I'd prefer to see the Japanese make an OVA out of it. You'd need at least 6 hours of footage to get most of it in and even then they'd have to censor it to get it a PG-13. I'm afraid that it's going to be all CGI and no plot.<br>  <br>  Their also stretching it a bit to call it the most celebrated graphics novel of all time. As far as I was aware that is Slam Dunk, which has a much wider audience and has been released in more countries and in morel languages so it's sold more copies to more people for a longer period of time.

fMKPp6qkaa	his an actor who does karate and he's on this old people show...nothing's great about him at all, that's why people always talk about him|`|T891gsHraa	Chuck Norris is an Executive Producer of "Walker, Texas Ranger" (1993) as well as the star. Norris is familiar to fans worldwide as the star of action films such as The Hitman (1991), The Delta Force (1986) and Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection (1990). He also starred in Missing in Action (1984) and its sequels, Firewalker (1986) and Sidekicks (1992). Norris was born Carlos Ray in Ryan, OK. The eldest of three children, he helped his mother raise his two younger brothers in Torrance, CA, where his family moved when he was 12. Norris joined the Air Force after graduating from high school. During a stint in Korea, he began to study the Asian martial art of Tang Soo Do. After returning home, he worked for Northrop Aviation and moonlighted as a karate instructor. Two years later he was teaching full-time and running a number of martial-arts schools. His students included Steve McQueen, Priscilla Presley and the Osmonds. In 1968, he became the Professional World Middleweight Karate Champion, holding the title undefeated until he retired in 1974. He is a black belt in Tang Soo Do and Tae Kwan Do, both Korean fighting arts, and knows all forms of the martial arts. In 1969, he earned the Triple Crown for the highest number of tournament wins, and was named Fighter of the Year by "Black Belt" magazine. By the time he was 34, Norris had established 32 karate schools and had been a champion for six years. In 1996, he became the first Westerner to be awarded an eighth-degree black belt in Tae Kwan Do. Norris, who was urged to get into acting by his friend Steve McQueen, skillfully incorporates his martial-arts knowledge into his series and feature film projects, stressing action and technique over violence. He is the author of the books "The Secret of Inner Strength" and "The Secret Power Within - Zen Solutions to Real Problems". He works for many charities, including the Funds for Kids, Veterans Administration National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans, the United Way, Make-a-Wish Foundation and KickStart, a nonprofit organization he created to help battle drugs and violence in schools. He also starred in the television movie Bound by Honor (1993), broadcast on CBS. He lives on a ranch when not filming. His birthday is March 10.|`|U3Wi5FAdaa	nothing|`|18K7ucsEaa	HE fought Bruce Lee in “Way of the Dragon”.... BRUCE LEE!!<br>  <br>  :-D|`|m9N4NVR6aa	The very first answer on this page was correct.

NBi07o6zaa	Christmas is my favorite holiday because I get to see my whole family, but also because during that time of year most people are in happy moods, and people seem to forget all of the bad stuff that's going on in their lives and in the world. Christmas raises my spirits, and it's a time of year when I can feel really happy and be thankful for what I have.

I go on winter break for two months and it is nothing but good! I love the lights the Christmas trees and the Christmas songs that come on the radio evey month of December. Since we are Mexican Americans we always have great food like menudo pozole tamales and goat meat.

rNqF4gIVaa	Nonsense - it no more classical music than any other Elton John pop song. (and don't get me wrong - I like Elton). Your basis for it being classical is the fact that Pavarotti is performing in it. Beethoven Sonatas are played on a piano - does that mean that every piece of music for the piano is classical. Obviously not.<br>  It is a contemprary pop piece.<br>  Pavarotti was no stranger to cross over given adequate incentive, whether that be a good cause or simply business.<br>  <br>  Edit: I generally define classical (with a small 'c' - the capitalized Classical refers to the period) as western art music. What constitutes art music however is constantly under debate - you only have to see some of the questions posted on this forum. It is a subject that literally volumes have been written on.|`|qswrz268aa	I would consider it Contemporary. Classical refers to music up to about the 1960's, the ending styles of impressionism, expressionism, and 12 tonism. Contemporary music refers to modern music, which in some aspects ignored classical traditions. Although it may be a classical performer, the song is contemporary. <br>  <br>  Well, you have a good day!|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Classical music is mid eighteenth century<br>  Contemporary means at the same time as..for example Bach was a contemporary of Haendel|`|ThKkn5fKaa	The band Apocolyptica plays entirely on cellos, but they would be the first to tell you that they play hard rock, not classical.  Instrumentation means nothing when compared to the music itself.  In the same way, if Bach's art of fugue were played on electric guitar, it would still be baroque music.  Even if Pavarotti were singing in his full operatic voice, this would still be entirely pop music.  It's all about the music.  Not the instrumentation.<br>  <br>  And just so you know, I wouldn't use the word contemporary, because that can refer to anything.  There is contemporary pop music just in the same way that there is contemporary jazz, and contemporary classical (western art) music.  Popular or pop is the more common terminology.

Ihi0lR1Taa	OMG! I was thinking the same thing last week. But I thought It was irking me so much b/c I was PMSing or something.  <br>  <br>  I watch both AMC and OLTL and the whole "Aunt Vicki makes me Campbell's Chicken Noodle soup when I feel sad" and "Fish, you really took one.  You look like you could use some of my healthy V8" is really annoying.  I thought that when the Go Red Ball was done the soaps would give it a rest.  <br>  <br>  I haven't noticed this with AMC but if OLTL gets paid a dime for everytime they mention a Campbell's heart healthy product they would have enough to pay their staff for a year.<br>  <br>  *EDIT* I agree 100% w/ Preet also.  When they mention the products it is soo out of place.  How many people come up to you and tell you how many vitamins are in a drink before they serve it to you?  And how often do you see these soap people eating canned food?|`|vsGc1UBoaa	Yeah, every show has this but it's like the writers on the soaps are trying to make it as obvious as possible. I mean seriously, "Campbells Chicken soup - it's good for your heart!" "I'll ask the chef to put some Prego Heart Healthy sauce on your pasta" "V8 VFusion has nutrients" and then Max unloading the groceries in a perfect little line with the labels visible while explaining each product! And it's really annoying how they keep saying the ENTIRE name of the prodcuts - who does that in real life? I would rather they just shorten the show and have extra commercials if they need the money that bad.|`|cr5TQgmUaa	If you want your favorite Soaps to continue to succeed, you should be happy. Otherwise, Soap Operas, in general, are on the road out. Many favorite Actors are being let go because they are being paid so much -- the studios are having to cut costs and/or find other ways of making money such as product placement.|`|YA4qCDukaa	it is annoying but they kinda for money. <br>  if you a product in story line then you get a curtain amount of money & if you mention it, like say the name of the product then you usually get more money. (like on an episode of 30 rock, they did this whole thing on snapuls drinks, where they did a little skit type thing & then tina fay looked into the camera & said "can we have our money now?")  i just can't tell if it's just for february being heart month or it's going to stick around. 'cause so far it's only the ''heart healthy" stuff that there doing it with. if it goes into march then i'll be really annoyed....|`|XnYkROf3aa	lol yeah i watch amc and i know there product is v8 juice. and so is oltl. that's all i have seen so far.|`|rCnYXtqTaa	I only watch AMC and dont see too much!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220125642AAvspHu">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I know it's so annoying.|`|GWV89XK8aa	V8 Fusion has nutrients! lol, it is a little annoying...it seems so misplaced in a soap opera|`|AA11451041	OMG, funny I just asked a question about All My Children and V-8.  I didn't understand what was going on.  Thanks for noticing too.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	The "Go Red for Women" campaign to increase awareness of women's heart health issues is, of course, a worthy cause. I'm glad that the ABC soaps have joined w/ Campbell's to get involved. But last year they had the "Go Red Ball" on AMC and kept the product placements a little more subtle on all the soaps.This year they're going way overboard and hitting us over the head with it non-stop. I think they're annoying people and, therefore, the message is getting lost (judging from the answers this question keeps getting). I hope ABC wises up next year and makes the product placements more subtle (and perhaps humorous).|`|jHDeIPEfaa	If the products were just shown, it would be better. But I don't care for the comments they make when the actors pick up the products.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I guess they are needing the money pretty bad but it is all for heart health month and raising awareness. They are sponsoring the show so they have too, but I agree it is a bit much!|`|AA12390047	"The Campbell Soup Co., in an integrated marketing campaign, will promote women’s heart health in all of ABC’s daytime programming during the month of February."<br>  Just another week to put up with it.|`|5tvM9T7vaa	I really don't understand why you would care.  Things like that do not make me mad because I don't care about them.|`|9e2edc13bc584b5dbeead19cad26ffb1aa	Yes especially on GH right now.. How much are they going to do this.. we get already.

I wish I was comfortable to walk around nude. We also have kids, so I wouldn't want to make them uncomfortable.

cLgwmcfwaa	in love, they suck. they have no pasion. they think "you're cool. but i'm independent."<br>  however, outside of love, they rock! they're eccentric, hilarious and fun. also they have good hearts and care about important stuff in life.<br>  thats why they make so many friends so easily. <br>  they're SOOO intelligent, even if they dont seem it on the surface. they just like to have fun.|`|IruqTmnbaa	Intelligent, strong personality,  always produce good idea,  very helpful and not expect return, loyal to partner, generous in love, fight for justice, good in analysis, keep informed in anything that directly affect them.<br>  <br>  Alway sceptical in everything, only believe in what they see and think, too realistic, care too much in love and money, not very generous in money, boring lifestyle, don't know abt art and leisure, doesn't care anything that don't directly affect them, expect good return in love, deep defence and counter-attack if being attacked.<br>  <br>  If you give them $1, they'll give you back $1.20.

I can't vouch for the other ones. We all differ from each other. <br>  <br>  I find myself rather loved by many people. I'm always there for them when they need help, I'm always there to offer a reassuring smile. In my circle of friends, they all look to me to lighten up the mood, because I'm really good at getting people to smile and laugh at themselves. I like myself. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, I have trouble with intimacy. Not because I'm not comfortable with it, but because I tend to get attached real easy, and that seems to make other people uncomfortable. I come off as really deep and emotional, forward and honest at the same time. <br>  <br>  I can be overly sensitive to say the least. I'm always looking for my soul mate. I'm always looking for true love, and I tend to get hurt because of it. So, I've learned to guard against my heart so that I don't. <br>  <br>  I'm pretty unpredictable, but I view it was rather charming. Charming for me, at least. It just means that I can't be easily manipulated. And even when someone is trying to manipulate me, I always catch them in the process and turn it around on them. They don't like it? They shouldn't have been trying in the first place.<br>  <br>  I like to be independent. However, it could also discourage any lover in my life. They might think that I don't need them around. But they don't get that I NEED to be independent all the time. I need my space, i need my alone time, and I think that's healthy. But I don't necessarily need THEM; I WANT them there. To me, the wanting part is something that they should appreciate more, because then I'm not using them for whatever I need. <br>  <br>  Yes, some people need to be needed, but I can't place that burden upon anyone. I find myself quite selfless, and I like that about me, but sometimes people can take advantage of me because of it, so I've learned to grow a little more selfish in the recent past. I gotta do what is right for ME and no one else.|`|ATSLuU12aa	They're really nice, intelligent, independent, aloof, distant.<br>  They make excellent friends.

f9igTxtTaa	Looks like 4 eyes. I saw it on facebook too and it's just bait for you to click on it to take you to this lame IQ quiz to get your cell number to send you a bunch of lame text messages. Don't rack your brains over it.|`|bXXvBmmjaa	It's all semantics. When referencing the above arguments...<br>  <br>  Just because something is a clone does not mean it doesn't count. If you clone a rat, wouldn't you then have two rats? Or would you still say it's only one rat, since it's an exact copy. If you xerox a document, then wouldn't you have two of the same document? This would argue the answer is 4.<br>  <br>  Since we're referencing to a picture, it can also be arguably said, it's just photoshop trick, and there really is only one set of eyes, that just because someone alters a photo, does not mean it changes the actual substance of the photo. This would argue the answer is 2.<br>  <br>  However, it is also a valid point that by technicality it is only a picture and not an actual organ. This would argue the answer is 0.<br>  <br>  In reality, there is no right answer. It's all about interpretation. The others are right about the marketing ploys, so do you really trust spam-ads to give you a true right answer? Or the fact that there really is a genuine survey that states a random selection sample pool was gathered to test this fact? <br>  <br>  In conclusion, it's how many you decide you want it to be. :)|`|PcN1sJj1aa	Answer: <br>  2 eyes<br>  <br>  Reason:<br>  Ok, so your first instinct is to look at the picture and see a double set of eyes. This is the trick of the question. The question clearly asks, "How many eyes are seen above." If you really think about it, since one pair of eyes is an identical copy of the other set of eyes, you are really only looking at 2 eyes. <br>  <br>  If the 2nd pair of eyes were different from the other, then the answer would be 4 eyes.|`|uyp0eO8aaa	It's a simple question designed to play on your ego.  First you say to yourself "Oh, there's four eyes. That's so easy.  I'll click this link and answer their question and show how smart I am."

SMM9dziSaa	I'll place them in three top power levels in general showing the best to next in the levels themselves.<br>  <br>  1) 4th Hokage > 1st Hokage > Madara: <br>  <br>  We with our own eyes did not get to see their powers but all three have the right hype and advantage of mystery surrounding  their outstanding accomplishments so we can assume that they were the best. <br>  <br>  2) Pain > Itachi<br>  <br>  Again the element of mystery. We never really get to see Itachi's true power nor Pain's, as of chap 436, but what Kishi did show us is enough to guess what they can be at their prime. Pain might fall one category below after his fight with Naruto is finished but being the Akashki leader he might be something really. <br>  <br>  <br>  3) Jiraiya => 3rd Hokage,  Orochimaro > Tsunade<br>  <br>  And in the end ofcourse Naruto will be the strongest by surpassing his father and Sasuke will be the 2nd best by surpassing Itachi. After all they both are main characters.|`|K8TCXwSuaa	I think that Kabuto is a lot stronger and more powerful/influential than we have been led to believe. <br>  <br>  -just my theory|`|frqfB0usaa	The Top 3 That I Would Pick Is<br>  1) Itachi Uchiha <--- *spoiler* If only he didn't have heart disease <br>  2) Naruto Uzumaki <-- The main character (whether or not he is the strongest right now) Should become stronger than most people if not all so he can become Hokage =3<br>  3) Madara Uchiha <-- Immortal with Sharingan .. He's really powerful so far.<br>  <br>  (These arn't in order)|`|6UgFvIqoaa	Naruto! they say sasuke is stronger but he isnt. hes second. and hard to believe Sakura is very strong. just because girls isnt very into things like naruto,doesnt mean they arent strong. you do realize you havent put any girl names in there?|`|MEbRr5uTaa	i would say Itachi/ Sasuke/ Naruto/ Pein/ Madara/ Kakashi|`|0ERFn9OZaa	naruto of coarse but sasuke could beat him if somehow he cheated but itachi is pretty strong and the fourth hokage is realy strong to so it's kind of a clash

e6jrBORRaa	Literally, it's "Black Film" in French.  It is a thriller with a very dark subject.<br>  <br>  A good example of a "Film Noir" (and my favorite of the genre) is D.O.A which is about a man who is looking for his murderer.  Somebody gave him a poison and he only has 24 hours to live.  The old black and white version with Edmund O'Brien was my favorite version.  There was a color version with Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan, also, but not as good.|`|YUjVFkocaa	You know that movie that came out really recently that had the guy with the mask on, and he was fighting the black Nazi who had those bald minion clones with the T-shirts,?  <br>  <br>  haha yeah dumb story plot, but anyyywayyys.....<br>  <br>  that is a good example of film noir.<br>  <br>  film noir is when its a darker film, with a lot of black and white with reds often mixed in, and rarely other colors... it's usually in a city, and its often abuot superheros, crime... it is usually very old-fashioned in styles and time period... etc|`|56bNLJykaa	They are stylized classic Hollywood crime films.

I will advise you to work with mainly R & B artist's though. I'm not trying to say that your sound isn't hard enough or good enough for rappers (there are a lot of amazing r&b producers), its just that I feel that your sound would go much better with a singer.

c4ffad35613c491307cfe58a126f710daa	2 Epiphone Les Paul This Best Kind  3> It's Awsome And I Own 3 Guitars But Thats By Pick|`|719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	I own a Gibson Les Paul Robot, a Gibson SG Robot, A Don Grosch Retro-Strat (a high end custom with the looks of a Fender Strat), Schecters, G&Ls, as well as Fender, Pedulla and Rickenbacker basses.<br>  <br>  Thre are three Fender Standard Telecasters on eBay right now for less than you pay for the junior league Squier version. So if you like the Tele, buy a real one. <br>  <br>  Although I play Gibson guitars, I like their Chinese cousins from Epiphone more than I'd like to admit. In fact I use Epiphone amps and speakerboxes on stage. But there is no chance whatever you will find a real Les Paul at even close to the price of the Chnese Epiphone version. However, you can find the Epiphone Les Pauls for under $100 on eBay. I've bought more than 20 guitars and basses on eBay and I have never been burned. So don't overpay.<br>  <br>  The Squier Tele plays a lot more like the Fender Tele than the Epiphone Les Paul plays like a Gibson. The Epiphone hollow bodies approximate the Gibson a lot closer than the solid bodies do in feel and tone. Versatility wise, you can do a lot more with the Les Paul style guitar that you can with a Tele, which to me, is okay for country and old rock like the Stones, but you won't be shredding with a Tele. <br>  <br>  The ultimate test is playability, i.e. can you play every note on every fret with a degree of ease and comfort? You only know that by trying them out. I can tell you this. Of all my guitars, and I can afford any guitar I want, and I've owned PRS and many others that people rave about, the Les Paul Robot tops them all, because it plays like a Les Paul without annoying me by having to manually tune all the damn time. Angled head stocks, like Gibsons, don't stay tuned with light gauge strings.  I've tuned that Don Grosch Strat twice this year and it's the same with Fenders.  I loaned the Don Grosch to a friend after it had sat in the cold in my car all day. He hooked it to a chromatic tuner and it was still dead on. That's the advantage of the straight headstock on the Fenders. And if you play on stage a lot, being out of tune after every solo blows.|`|Z5VCTFruaa	Definitely the Les Paul one!<br>  its such a nice guitar|`|DUGZa0Zgaa	Strats are cooler than Les Pauls, but Squier doesn't make great guitars.  Epiphone guitars are alright, so I guess that's the more obvious choice.

9yj1Gz4taa	I have the same problem! For those of you who are puzzling why someone could get ABC Family and not a local ABC affiliate station . . . at least in the US Pacific Northwest, Dish Network is having a contractual dispute with Seattle-based Fisher Communications, owner of KOMO TV in Seattle, KATU TV in Portland, and several other TV stations. Currently Fisher will not allow their stations' signals to be carried by Dish Network (basically, according to Dish Network, Fisher wants to double the rates Dish Network pays to carry what is supposed to be a "free" signal! Fisher has not been specific in their public responses so far.) So all of us Dish Network subscribers in the Pacific Northwest, who live too far away to pick up Fisher's ABC affiliates over the air, currently have no access to ABC network programming, other than through ABC Family, which Dish carries directly from ABC.<br>  <br>  All I can suggest for people in our position is that unless ABC Family will carry the Oscars (which from online searches, it does not look like they will), the only answer is to go to a friend or relative's house with either cable or DirectTV Satellite (whose contracts to carry Fisher signals are currently not expired), or that can receive an over-the-air signal from a local ABC affiliate station.|`|uGaivyoZaa	It might be on ABC Family, but its definietly on ABC... just check anyways|`|4vNpMZ4Vaa	no you wont be able to see it on family. but how do you not have the local channels. very weird...|`|cW9vQ5nbaa	yes|`|89gOV0dBaa	ya on sunday
TJBEeXO2aa	My choir instructor once told me that I was an alto and can never sing high notes. Rubbish. That fella didn't teach me how to use the head voice.<br>  <br>  The range given for each category is only a guide. To put it bluntly, that range is for the lousy singers of each category as one should be able to sing notes way above or below that category. <br>  <br>  Yes, a teacher should help. But I have never gone to a teacher and probably never would. I started off with two octaves before and now I have about 3 octaves. I would recommend you to try out the head voice or falsetto gently as they are extremely beneficial to both male and female singers. <br>  <br>  Sing scales daily I would say. Practice hitting the higher notes that you can hit daily until you know you can hit them well before going up a SEMI tone. Recommended: 2 weeks per note. Make sure your lower jaw really hangs lower as you reach for your higher notes and that your tongue rests at your bottom teeth without strain.<br>  <br>  NOTE: IF YOU FEEL A STRAIN, DO NOT CONTINUE. Hit the notes that you can without straining. I know that everyone is eager to have a bigger range, but going slow is better.|`|RrgmHGNMaa	Yes, it is, but neither easy nor simple, not even common; so take care: don′t force your vocal system as a whole so much; try little by little, under a good teacher′s assistance whenever possible. Moreover don′t expect so strongly you′ll reach so many notes/tones over your common ones. Anyway a bass′ voice sounds somewhat different of a HIGHER baritone one. - Did that teacher make any really good tests with you??? Look here below:<br>  .........................................<br>  ...............BASIC RANGES (male common limits) ...............<br>  .........................................<br>  Standard BASS = ........................................... F1 > E3<br>  "Cantante" BASS (most typical) = .................... E-flat1 > F3<br>  BARItone BASS (middle bass, nearly baritone) = .... F1 > G3<br>  Standard BARITONE = ........................................... G1 > A3<br>  BariTenor (HIGHER BARITONE [!], nearly tenor!) =  . G1 > B3<br>  Standard TENOR = ...........................................  C3 > A4<br>  .........................................<br>  As per your words, I presume then, you′re at "CANTANTE" BASS range (normally qualified as a normal bass, but pretty good for lyrical solos - they say), also depending on your lower limit!!! Well, maybe I′d better tell you, several teachers or instrumentists, just by hearing me speaking have yet soon said, I′m a tenor; anyway I can′t reach high notes, so I see myself as a 2nd (lower) baritone or even a 2nd (higher) bass (not as a soloist); that′s what I played in choirs (never as a professional, sure!... - I don′t sing often, indeed I seldom sing, even at home I don′t do, ah ha ha!...). I′d tell you not to play the fool, but keep in the musical suit that YOU feel more comfortable.|`|wKbRwH3haa	Practising scales is always a good thing to do, but do not attempt to go any higher without a professional tutor, there are ways of accessing higher notes, but you should never try to stretch your voice higher than its naturally capable of going, you can do yourself damage by forcing note out.  If you sing as a bass, but have told you could be a tenor, then it sounds to me as though you have a great range already.  As a singer I would suggest you concentrate on the quality of the notes you can sing and address reaching higher notes at a later date when someone is there to guide you through this, I also recommend cutting down on daily products and focusing on breathing techniques as this will help you also :)|`|OCCzu7bFaa	Okay.  Try this.  Pretend you are walking out of a building, and your car is parked at the very far end of the parking lot.  You see someone trying to steal your car and you can't run fast enough to catch them, so you yell as loud as you can, "HEY!!!"<br>   <br>  That shout is the best way to get your voice used to singing higher pitches while keeping your larynx in the right position.  Try yelling "HEY!", then try yelling and sustaining, like "HEYEYEY!" <br>  <br>  With practice, you will build up your stomach muscles and gain stamina and be able to yell with vibrato, which is what beginning singing is (in the male voice, anyway).<br>  <br>  It's silly, but it works!  The best way to learn anything is to relate it to something you are familiar with.

Sometimes these songs are even disguised as love songs ("One" for example, might be a song about two lovers, but really it's about the Protestant-Catholic wars in Ireland).<br>  <br>  Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails) wrote a whole album on his hatred for George Bush ("Year Zero") and often writes about how he hates Christiantity.  And also about killing himself.<br>  <br>  A lot of pop songs are strictly about people dancing.<br>  <br>  I love Evanescence's "Imaginary" off their first album.  It's about not wanting to get up in the morning and has lovely imagery about a dream world.<br>  <br>  Flyleaf has a song, "Cassie" about Cassie Bernall, the girl who answered "Yes" when the Columbine killers asked her if she believed in God, so they shot her.  Flyleaf in general sings of hope and faith in a non-preachy way.<br>  <br>  In fact, most Christian artists write worship songs, but I guess that is about love - love for God.|`|iBGkSg50aa	Songs can be about anything.

M1ymLE9Paa	The FBI has proof of Spinelli hacking into all sorts of government facilities, which is a federal crime.  And he's committed that crime over and over again.  So he's up poop creek w/o a paddle.  The FBI used their case against Spinelli as leverage against Jason.  They made a deal w/Jason that if he agreed to go undercover and work w/them, and turn in Sonny and Anthony, they would drop their case against Spinelli.  Jason agreed to turn in Anthony but he doesn't want to turn in Sonny and even warned Sonny that the FBI is using him to try and get him to turn them in.|`|ZmGOL8kCaa	Spinelli's done a bunch of illegal internet hacking stuff for Jason. And a couple of weeks ago, Spinelli's computer got hacked. It turns out that Winifred was the one who hacked him. She got evidence from his computer of all of the illegal stuff he did.<br>  <br>  The FBI said that if Jason doesn't give them information on Sonny and/or Anthony, they'll arrest Spinelli for all of the illegal stuff. So Jason's plan is to rat out Anthony and spare Sonny, but Anthony's missing, so Jason either has to find him, rat out Sonny, or let Spinelli go to jail.|`|ADBMrG87aa	Spinelli hacked into all sorts of computers including law enforcement's local and federal.|`|GrE1UM2Saa	he hacked into goverment files which is high treason against the country.|`|l3k21kTmaa	Spinelli hacked into federal websites and Winfred help the FBI nail Spin and that agent Ranyer is using Spin aainst Jason to take down Sonny and Anthony  but jason would not turn in sonny|`|NGNeT3rYaa	He hacked into accounts that he should not have and they were able to catch him.

wZa3qiSbaa	Well what I can for myself cause I'm a Pisces who's been with Taurus guy for 10yrs now, I notice that they like to take time apart sometimes it doesn't mean he's ignoring you.....just give him time to sort out whatever that it may be..he already likes you so don't assume the worst, just like it is in your caring nature just try be there for him|`|o2FJIXS9aa	I am a Pisces that used to be married to a Taurus. They are materialistic, in love with beauty, and call it as they see it. If you are looking for a guy to lie to you all the time and be in constant contact you picked the wrong person. They do what they want to do when they want to do it. They can be good partners but it takes trust on both parts.|`|nxHjSKTTaa	You should never persue a guy. Just go about your life and don't dwell on it. Try reverse psychology. It always works for me. Seem distant and don't pay him any attention. Go out with someone else. If this doesn't get his attention then he's just not interested. Men like the chase, not to be chased but to chase the women.  The harder they have to work for your attention the more they want you.  Good luck!|`|ErN3pbTeaa	No that's just how we are...We tend to neglect our relationships sometimes. Then after like a week or a month, we'll call you back and be like I LOVE YOU lol. weird huh..<br>  We tend to take awhile to make decisions. He is most likely debating this relationship or is just not interested.<br>  <br>  Keep pursuing him... we like that (if its not annoying)

nYUmhYbcaa	First before you start, miming is a ministry, not a performance. <br>  <br>  Both versions of "The Battle is the Lords" are sung by Yolanda Adams.  One version, the more "powerful" version is on her "Yolanda...Live in Washington" CD that came out in the late 90's.<br>  <br>  There is no set "uniform" for miming. Most people wear something similar to what you saw in the youtube video, but in my church, our mime team wears black tee shirts and jeans.  Other programs wear traditional mime wear (black and white striped tee, suspenders and black pants.)<br>  You also do not have to wear mime face. Some people wear half their face white or no makeup at all. I usually do no makeup when doing a mime with more than three people, but when miming alone I wear mime face.  You can get the makeup at any costume store, party supply, etc... If you can not find it order face paint online, but it is more expensive that way. You can also order a mime outfit online, but it is easier to use whatever you already have. When you first start, go for a minimal look. That is what sets miming apart. All black pants and a long sleeve black shirt is good to start out with. When doing any type of praise dance, mime, or interpretive worship, it is best to have your hair pulled back if it is long. SO that answers questions 1 and 2. I don't understand what you mean in your third question. What do you mean by "get noticed" mime is done to minister not get noticed if that's what you mean. Please explain and then I can try to help you.

VQzYYYaEaa	Topping the list is a tryst between Trent, the film's designated rich jerk, and Bree, one of the designated sexpots. Trent's girlfriend, Jenna, is off with Clay looking for his sister, so he takes advantage of the situation—and Bree—in a locked bedroom, where they engage in graphic sex. (There's a lot of movement and moaning; audiences see Bree's breasts and backside.) Trent crudely compliments critical parts of Bree's body all the while.<br>  <br>  Two other teens reveal their breasts before falling victim to Jason: One strips off her bra to entice her boyfriend into a round of sex inside a tent. (Again, a lot of graphic movement makes it onto the screen.) Another goes waterskiing topless.<br>  <br>  Among other tawdry things, a guy asks a mannequin whether she (the mannequin) remembers when she took his virginity. Another fellow buys condoms and references masturbation. A guy prepares to masturbate while looking at a clothes catalog. The camera scans a pornographic magazine as someone appears to lick sections of a foldout. Several folks make crude and obscene comments to each other, including the sexualized suggestion of someone being willing to drink someone else's urine. Obscene gestures are made. Women dance provocatively. Men ogle.|`|pfAv83FIaa	I have to admit, it's pretty bad. But think of the converse...

If you are not a fan, then you will probably not like it. It's got everything that makes a Friday the 13th movie great. Sex, boobs, drugs, funny dialogue, and awesome kill scenes. It's just an old fashioned slasher/horror. One that true fans will love and enjoy. There are tons of pop up moments that will make you jump.

FeygqXuWaa	The scale formulas you're talking about refer to the intervals between the notes in the scale, not the specific scale degrees.  In A harmonic minor, the distance between B and C is a half step, or H (also known as a minor second).  Between C and D is a two half steps: a whole step, or W (also known as a major second).  The "minor third" refers to the interval between the F and the G#: it's three half steps, which is defined as a minor third (the other person is right that this is technically an "augmented second," but that's not really worth worrying about).  If we were talking about the note F in a D minor scale, it would be called "flat-3" instead of "minor 3rd."<br>  <br>  There's a difference between intervals (minor 6th's, major 2nd's, perfect 4th's), scale degrees (in C major, E=3, B=7), and chords (G major is the 5 of C major), although they all use related numbers.  In speech, intervals are usually called by ordinal names (third, sixth, seventh, etc.), while both scale degrees and chords use regular, cardinal numbers (three, four, six, etc.).  To help with this, in written-out classical music theory we use regular numbers for intervals, Roman numerals for chords, and numbers with carets above them (^) for scale degrees.  The Solfege systems gets rid of some confusion, replacing scale degrees with syllables: Do Re Mi Fa and so on, with flat-3 being "Me" (meh), sharp 4 being "Fi," and all sorts of other fun syllables.<br>  <br>  I know this has a lot of extra information, but I hope you found the main part to be helpful.|`|DMpVSHvXaa	"A Harmonic minor is A B C D E F G? A. The Formula is W H W W H m3 H<br>  "<br>  <br>  Correction to that formula: It should be W H W W H Aug2 H<br>  <br>  Aug2= Augmented 2nd. It's to do with how the notes are spelled: G is one letter above F, therefore anything involving F-G will be a 2nd. It's augmented because it's a semitone wider than a major second.<br>  <br>  And yes, it does make a difference: augmented seconds function differently than minor thirds.<br>  <br>  A# would be part of the augmented 2nd in b harmonic minor, which is<br>  B C# D E F G A# B<br>  <br>  (G- A# is an augmented second.)<br>  <br>  In any harmonic minor scale, the notes forming an augmented second will be the 6th and 7th notes of the scale.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	if I read your question right you are trying to find the relationship of minor keys<br>  <br>  So when you say G# and A# are minor of what you are asking what is the relative major?<br>  as am relates to C: a#m relates to C#<br>  gm is in Bb so G# must be in B<br>  <br>  try to relate all the keys this way<br>  <br>  rel minor is a m3 below the rel major|`|ThKkn5fKaa	Yes, you did misunderstand.  No worries.  First off, just to reiterate, the minor 3rd, or augmented 2nd is simply an interval, just like a whole step or a half step.  This interval just consists of 3 half steps though.<br>  <br>  Harmonic Minor scales are very unique.  Of the standard scales (major, natural minor, harmonic minor, and melodic minor) harmonic minor scales are the only scales that use a minor 3rd. (Although Rachel correctly pointed out that it is actually an augmented second or A2) It's this large interval that gives the scales their "eastern" sounding flair.  <br>  <br>  So the problem with the C# scale that you listed is that it is a MAJOR scale.  The augmented 2nd jump is only to be found in a HARMONIC MINOR scale.  Thus, you should have written C# harmonic minor, which is C# D# E F# G# A B# C#.  You'll notice that the interval between A and B# is 3 half steps, or an augmented 2nd.<br>  <br>  Any scale in harmonic minor is always W H W W H A2 H.

You should be stoned for willing to be a gay porn star. Or have you renounced your faith?     Getting into the porn industry is very very difficult if you are a man. You must be able to get it up, keep it up, and then *** within 2 or 3 minutes of being asked. That is a given. You have to be at least 7 inches and very thick, preferably over eight. You have to be in some kind of physical shape, and you have to have stamina. You have to be willing to work with any girl in any situation, and be prepared for stop-start sex.    Sending pictures will get you nowhere. You have to actually GO to the studios and introduce yourself and then they will take naked polaroids of you and get back to you. But even then, your chances are minimal.    There is always a market for porn actors, regardless of your background and personal requirements, but at the same time you have to have (a) talent, (b) luck, and (c) you must be in a good location. New York, Miami, San Fran, London, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Prague, Budapest, Montreal, Toronto, Vegas, even Minneapolis all have decent porn-producing studios, but 95% of the top adult movies in the world today are produced in Porn Valley. That is the San Fernando Valley in NorthWest Los Angeles, California. If you don't live in or near that valley, your chances are automatically significantly smaller.    Once you're in the Valley, go to VCA Platinum, Elegant Angel, Metro or Wicked (in Chatsworth), Vivid (in Van Nuys) or Sin City (in Canoga Park). But as I said, your chances of getting hired as part of a walk-in are extremely low.    If you're looking for low-budget internet porn jobs, they are out there, and searching on yahoo and google and excite can be productive. Instead of looking for advertised jobs, look for actual sites which offer the kinds of porn you'd like to be involved in and think you have a chance of being involved in). Then, make sure the porn is made by and for the website itself, then contact the webmasters and owners of the site and try and strike up a negotiation for an appearance in a movie for them. Of course, you need to have your photographs and details online.    Now assuming you go to the Valley, or somewhere similar, the best advice is always to find a stunning girl who wants to be a pornstar, and go to a studio with her. The girl should specify that she wants to work with you and the - ouila - you have a job. They'll always hire a hot girl, and if she's only willing to work with you, you just received a free ticket into porn superstardom.    If you're looking to do gay porn, the girl is unneccessary and it will be ten times easier for you to get a job. Gay porn stars are always needed and if you're willing to do that, unless you're completely unattractive to most men, you will get work in LA.    The old/young/kinky/hardcore thing is vital, especially if you are not bringing a new female into the industry, as they call it. You have to be willing to do ANYTHING and they will often start you off on something gross. Naturally, you'll have to perform very well in your first few movies particularly, and then you'll also have to work for small amounts until you're well known.    If you're thinking of mainstream acting or what not, you almost certainly will be exposed by the paparazzi. Once you do porn, your ENTERTAINMENT career is permanently red-flagged. Just come up with an alias and make it clear that your identity is to be kept a secret. Many pornstars do that.    If you're looking to get into gay porn in particular, it's simple. Move to LA. Go to the gay porn studios (they're in the book, they're all over the place), and walk right in and audition. They'll know within five minutes if you're what they're looking for and they're ALWAYS hiring.    Agents and agencies are sometimes OK but usually not, be very careful. The best thing to do is to write to a few male porn stars and ask them how they got involved, and how to get involved, agency/agent/studio wise. They'll tell you. It will probably even be in their online bios.    If you have a girl with you, and she's hot, and she wants to do porn with you, I suggest you go to JIM SOUTH at World Modelling on Van Nuys Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, California. He's in the phone book.    Anyway... bottom line is... if you like the sun, go to Los Angeles. If you don't, go to Germany, the Czech Republic or Hungary. Because you're not going to find work anywhere else unless a miracle happens.

HIvDN7T0aa	You drank 120 ounces of water.    You didn't drink any water the first day - just juice.  But you added one ounce of water.  On the second day, you added 2 ounces of water.  On the third day, 3 ounces.  And so on.    How much you drink every day is irrelevant since you finish it all off at the end.      On the fifteenth day, you added 15 ounces of water.  Then, on the sixteenth day, you drank it all.    So the amount of water consumed is 15+14+13+12+11+10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 120.|`|aGl2p8dEaa	6 oz but you could have drank water without drinking the mixture|`|foXWUdJ5aa	All of it|`|KtWsBXSCaa	if u added water only for 3 days then u wud hav drunk 3oz.

That was their alternative solution. Just search your movie on http://www.flixplore.com (it's a free online movie search engine.)|`|M8YMxfEVaa	I think that they shut down that website.

XIkL2GmXaa	I think your analogy between Tim Treadwell and Chris Mccandless is a bit flawed. Clearly there are similarities. Both men lived there lives to the beat of a different drummer. They both found that they fit in better in nature than in the world of men. They both lived and died doing what they loved regardless of what the critics said.<br>  <br>  However they differ in many important ways, while I believe Treadwell truly loved bears and wanted to help protect them and their habitat, however, he was a bit of a primadonna and sought attention for himself. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it attracted attention to his cause, but it is very different from Mccandless. Mccandless was more of a visionary, and was on a soul searching journey to find himself and live a life in tune with nature. He was not motivated in the least by a drive for attention. <br>  <br>  Treadwell was also more niave and blinded by over confidence than Mccandless. Obviously, Treadwell was knowledgeable about living safely among bears as he survived living with wild Grizzlies for 13 years but I think he began to forget that he was not a bear and just how dangerous they were. Mccandless on the other hand, while a bit niave to be sure, took calculated risks knowing the dangers full well, it was a part of the challenge. He was trying to live his life as far from the rampant materialism of society as possible. Many fault him for it but fail to realize that it was the point of his journey, to take as little as possible to survive. <br>   <br>  Wile I think Treadwell merits respect for his passion he is not on the same level as Chris, who's legacy and set of lofty ideals give us a model on which to shape our lives, not so much to follow his actions to the letter, but to live lives more in tune with nature and less rooted in the material excesses of society|`|P6fT0LBiaa	I agree with the comment about McCandless.  Treadwell, was a high drinker, so make your own conclusions.|`|IVluzfZ0aa	Ahahahahaha!|`|9c2dac91545a93248f3b50c9ac2fae3faa	Well he definitely had passion for the bears, you can't fault him for that. And he was willing to do the field work to study them, which is very important for any wildlife research / study / conservation. <br>  <br>  But he seemed to be blinded by his infatuation with the bears, so much so it cost him his life. You need to respect anything in the wild, be it a bear, a shark, or even spider. Creatures have 2 things on their minds at all times; survive and reproduce. If they see you as a threat or food, you need to get the heII out.|`|reHRXlZCaa	I thought Grizzly Man was a tremendously compassionate piece of work by Mr Herzog.  Watching the documentary, maybe it only seemed that way to me, Timothy Treadwell may have been passionate about the bears but he clearly suffered from some form of mental illness, perhaps severe depression & was particularly adept at hiding it from his loved ones, or perhaps they weren't prepared to admit to it.

Not a fan of Luda though.|`|kuxVB76maa	I luv him!!! If I had more drink I'm gonna fucckk you is that what you want me to do hey shawty.|`|bribxhsdaa	EDIT - I'm a "Non RHH" guy. I only got into hip hop properly recently. Score one for assumptions though. And what makes you think I feel i'm superior to anyone? There are loads of people in this section who are older and wiser than me. Take a pop at them. Pull your skirt up and let it go. Once Again, I shouldn't have criticised your lyrics to the point where you had to delete your question. Please let me e-live now?<br>  <br>  He's a good artist. One of the south's finest and one of the most consistent featuring artists in mainstream hip hop. I do think the whole "look at how loud I can shout" thing kinda defeats the point of using a microphone.<br>  <br>  To take up your point on The Red Light District, I think some of his lyrical content can detract from his skill as an MC..If you're hearing him talking about "cars & hoes"...You're not gonna consider him lyrically but that said, He's not the kinda MC to be talking about "K.O.S." or the Darfur conflict..<br>  <br>  Makes good club tracks too. And has some of the most memorable punchlines in hip hop IMO. I think Lil Wayne has definitely tried to piggy-back Luda's use of memorable punchlines.<br>  <br>  I also think he short-changed his chops as an MC by making Theater Of Mind a weird pseudo-concept album feature-fest.|`|KF9751Lyaa	He's one of the best out there & probably the best from the South, he's underrated though =/|`|O1t0hY8Gaa	I've heard all his albums<br>  I'm not sure if I like him as much as the underground artist<br>  but in my opinion, his best album was theater of mind<br>  and the best track was MVP|`|SB5hdhM6aa	He'z a monster|`|2faae7b556bae8292adc7e81ca55ca8aaa	hes ok, i dont really listen to him|`|KoNHUcNUaa	A good rapper, punchline king, he gan spit mainstream stuff, but still have some great lyrics.|`|ioNTTqKfaa	He's alright, he's a good punchline rapper. He needs to work on releasing better albums. His last album suffered from way too many features, many of them by mediocre rappers. It was disappointing.|`|q4XUy0Duaa	I agree with you with the way he changed.  I never considered him to be a great rapper, but I always liked his rhymes because he was more funny than anything else, and his delivery is original.  I also give him props because he was a VJ turned rapper.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  @ The Scientist - Yeah, I can see that with the exaggeration and emphasis they put on certain words in their lines, but Pharoah's on another level.  I think he got more flows, and he's definitely been in the game longer.  LMAO @ all the hate you got.  Thumbs up for making a valid comparison.|`|gPuASwcWaa	He has sometimes corny lyrics, but he's an ok rapper.<br>  <br>  His humor in his lyrics takes that over, and sometimes he can have really good lyrics.|`|4hiMgHMCaa	Punchline king of the 2000s. Probably the most consistent rapper from the south of this decade.|`|93e0b2a4a6386ee080ab833cbe57167eaa	i think you either love him or hate him,i love him,his voice is dirty n sexy

84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Venus in Air, Mars in Air (Romantic Air, Airy Desires):  In love, you are youthful, intelligent, spirited, and mostly cool-headed, or you are drawn to partners with these qualities. You need a certain amount of space—freedom of movement, both physically and mentally—in any relationship, and restrictive or possessive partners turn you off. Your mind needs to be stimulated in order for your sexual passions to engage. Not as empathetic as some, you are really quite rational when it comes to expressing yourself romantically and sexually. You offer your partners a certain level of freedom to be who they are, and you appreciate the same in return. You value being friends with your partners as well as lovers, and you're a good friend, too! You are a playful, spontaneous, and light-hearted lover who considers communication to be a key "ingredient" in relationships. You respond most lovingly to verbal expressions of interest and affection. You are turned off by partners (or potential partners) who are uncommunicative. As long as there is what you consider to be an open and flowing communication between yourself and your partner, you feel loved and appreciated. You can be a real flirt, sometimes promising a little more than you can deliver. Your partners find you lively, intelligent, and fun, although a tad aloof at times. There is an ephemeral quality to you that keeps others guessing, and perhaps not always trusting that you will stick around. In truth, you do need plenty of stimulation in order to keep your interest. <br>  <br>  Venus and Mars in compatible signs: Your romantic and sexual natures are similar, but varied enough to make your love life quite exciting. For the most part, you know what you want in love relationships. Your charm is subtle and natural. While you don't generally come on strong, you don't need to. There is a buzz of understated sexual and romantic energy about you that promises a good time. You are vibrant and charismatic.

YUjVFkocaa	goblet of fire, and #1 also<br>  <br>  ================<br>  <br>  Here's the best movies (in order from best to worst) from each genre. This was decided between best movies of all time according to critics, best movies by people's ratings, and my personal preference.<br>  <br>  Chick-flicks: The Notebook, The Titanic, 50 first dates, fools gold, and theres something about mary. (Don't have too much for this)<br>  <br>  Action: Terminator 2, Die Hard 1, Batman: The Dark Knight, Rambo: First Blood, Apocalypto, Gladiator, Eraser, Predator, Aliens, Mission: Impossible.<br>  <br>  Futuristic/Dystopian (these are the ones Im best with- REALLY good movies): A Clockwork Orange, The Island, Brazil, Minority Report, Wings of Desire, Children of Men, Ghost In The Shell, 1984, V for Vendetta, Blade Runner, Planet of the Apes, Mad Max.<br>  <br>  Comedy: Liar Liar, Ace Ventura: Pet detective, Rat Race, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, American Pie 1 & 2, Blazing Saddles, Animal House, Dodgeball, Caddyshack, Dumb and Dumber, Ghostbusters, Superbad, The Big Lebowski.<br>  <br>  Boxing/gangs/city movies: Rocky, The Godfather, Scarface, Goodfellas, Dirty Harry, Raging Bull (boxing), Resorvoir Dogs, American Gangster, The Usual Suspects, Boondock Saints (if you're Irish), Million Dollar Baby, Training Day.<br>  <br>  Sports/racial films: Remember the Titans, American History X, Hoosiers, Bull Durham, The Natural, Friday Night Lights, Hoop Dreams, Visionquest, Caddyshack, White Men Can't Jump, Rudy, Slap Shot, Coach Carter. (These are actually ALL REALLY CLOSE and all are extremely good... see them all!)<br>  <br>  Scary/Horror movies (great at these too): The Shining, Psycho, It, 28 days later (and 28 weeks later is also good), The Exorcist, The Thing, The Butterfly Effect, Silence of the Lambs, The Ring, The Grudge, Se7en, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Night of the Living Dead.<br>  <br>  War Movies (ill only list a few great ones): Saving Private Ryan, Enemy At The Gates, Braveheart, Schindlers List, We Were Soldiers, Full Metal Jacket, The Patriot, The Hunt for Red October, The great escape.<br>  <br>  Martial Arts Movies: Enter the Dragon, Bloodsport, The Chinese Connection, Fearless, Ong Bak: Thai Warrior, Drunken Master, Fists of Fury, the Shaolin Temple, Game of Death, Hero, Iron Monkey.<br>  <br>  Fantasy: Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia, (and then Twilight is even worse than the many movies NOT mentioned lol).<br>  <br>  Superhero Movies: batman begins, batman: dark knight, spiderman 1 and 2, iron man, X2: Xmen United, Superman: The movie, The Incredibles.|`|kPMxo2MCaa	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. The acting was great, along with brilliant cinematography, special effects and the best translation from book to screen. <br>  <br>  The Goblet of Fire is another story. That was just complete garbage. Every scene felt wrong and out of place, and the acting was shockingly below par.  Every time Michael Gambon spoke I thought he was either tipsy or a gruntled old buffoon.<br>  <br>  This is also extremely disappointing: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flixster.com/news/2008/09/12/halfblood-prince-scores-low-with-early-screening" rel="nofollow">http://www.flixster.com/news/2008/09/12/...</a>|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	Prisoner of Azkaban had alot of great scenes, & i love Gary Oldman, so yeah, that should be my favorite. Order of the Phenoix was awesome too.|`|HTkGvWYAaa	harry potter and the prsoner of azkaban.<br>  <br>  luna, sirius, dobby, and cedric. i cried when sirius and cedric both died.|`|u4liwDhAaa	I have enjoyed all of the movies.  They are terrific.  My favorite would have to be the very first because of all this mystery and magic that's  unfolding around Harry.  It's like Christmas morning, looking at your Santa presents.  It's quite a wonderland!<br>  <br>  Hagrid is my favorite character next to Harry and Ron!  (I also love Harry's owl.)|`|bFJQyRusaa	So far the best one is The order of the phoenix. My favorite character is Harry Potter. But contest of the best one ever will be between The Half-Blood Prince and The Deathly Hollows. I have to say, J.K Rowling is a great writer, The Harry Potter series is her best work ever!!|`|fbe8face4c64fd238c4d4c3fd28046a7aa	Prisoner of Azkaban. I loved it so much.My favorite character is Ron. Also I had a crush on Cedric Diggory. Oddly enough he turned out to be Edward HHHHHHOOOOOOOOTTTTTTT|`|H66RHumIaa	All of the movies are good, but the books are even better...<br>  <br>  I like Harry, Sirius Black, Hagrid...|`|29d696b2b163821f5d4e2854064c4a2faa	I loved the Chamber of Secrets.

My favourite character is Sirius, I love him (and I also cried when he died T_T)|`|fOvsqhBHaa	my favorite was the goblet of fire. i loved some of the scenes that werent in the books. my favorite character is ron!! He's soo funni!!|`|r98mDSDxaa	Im in AUS so it was called philosophers stone in my neck of the woods.Yeah i have to agree with yo on that one except my fave characters were Draco Malfoy and Ron|`|7FfE1Gwbaa	probaly the prisoner of askaban. mine is probaly ron and sirius. i almost cried when sirius died too! and cedric!|`|e0338b9bb1dd97eb01a44cc65f8d7e7aaa	i like them all sorry<br>  but<br>  they are getting better as they go along<br>  i like the 2nd more than the 1st , then i like the 3rd more than the 2nd ect ect ect  <br>  LOL<br>  they are getting so dark is wicked<br>  professer moody|`|HNWLhXTfaa	the most recent.. this is because they have become more faithful and realistic to the books! my favourite characters have to be fred and george so funny... so sad in the last book though :'(|`|peQoyOC0aa	Harry potter and the goblet of fire it is amazing|`|YBigQ0Skaa	goblet of fire cedric is hott|`|XwZ8n1vtaa	The Prisoner of Azkaban my sister always bugs me about how we ALWAYS have to watch that one.

I absolutely HATED Goblet of Fire.  Compared to the book it was second rate tripe.  Half of the important story was left out or modified.  Such crap.  <br>  <br>  My favorite characters are Ginny, Fred and George Weasley.
TlSf43X4aa	Different reasons for different people. Some people just like the general sound of it. Some people like the dark meaning behind the lyrics.<br>  <br>  I personally just really like the way it sounds. It just has that awesome chilling effect on you. Theres something about the highly rasped vocals I just love. And on the more symphonic bands the orchestrals in the background sound SO epic. Overall it provides a really great feeling along with a message I personally can agree with most of.|`|7nkQyM0Laa	Because it reminds me of being in the forest in South Africa. Off course in England the forests are Idiot Forests.|`|W02qKX8Baa	its just their kind of music and sounds good to thier ears|`|Catsy82Caa	because of black metal i wouldn't be the grim and frostbitten eternal servant of satan that i am today

PHZUzww2aa	Shows usually get cancelled because they aren't getting enough views to be worth keeping.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of great shows worth watching these days, you could ask for suggestions. You could try and see if there are any shows made by the same directors or with the same actors in - since you may enjoy them too.<br>  <br>  Some shows do go on and on, they're called soaps, and in return for an ongoing story they suffer from terrible quality.|`|jPXjfn1iaa	Well, usually shows are canceled because they aren't very popular and people don't watch them. Or maybe the company can't make any new episodes.|`|ow1x7fHTaa	they are getting cancelled either because enough people aren't watching and they are losing money or another show want|`|AA12365169	They either have no more ideas, the ratings are low, or the actors and working cast don't want to do it anymore.|`|yQYP7yFuaa	same as this guy ^ and because sometimes actors want to move on with their lives.

He is however not  new. He has been around for quite a while now. His new album is quite eclectic with a new and fresh vibe that has much been needed. And as far as why Wayne got on it. Pleaseeee, everyone knows that when Wayne gets on a track everyone wants to hear that version. Artists as well as fans sit and wait for their chance to have Wayne on the remix.

Which is not caring.<br>  <br>  I dislike the grammys because they they ignore Rush whenever Rush is nominated (plus, I just disagree with the noms most times)<br>  <br>  I dislike the Oscars even more now because they won't nominate the Dark Knight for anything more than a best actor nom.  Just because it's a comic book movie.|`|kiJ0rUrVaa	i feel the same... never watch it...i hate all celebrities i mean they dont work as hard as half of us do and they get the highest pay... for example a builder or a brick layer or even a doctor have to work there butt off until they get a pay of less than ￡100 or so (maybe more for a doctor) whilst celebrities do a stupid concert or interview or a episode and they earn ￡20,000+ <br>  <br>  its unbelievable|`|yGQgdYNwaa	Usually i wouldn't care, i just want to know if my movie won, it's nominated for 10 awards.

Why would they care about anything else?|`|Iz1oTfKfaa	Right here!  <br>  BTW: Why are they still spending money on crap like that?

84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Well, I'm not a Virgo Rising, but your rising sun is a MASK. Unless it is strong in your chart, it only reflects what other people see you. Maybe you act a certain way in public. <br>  <br>  However, once they get to know you-- You have a lot of Libra in your chart- they will see the real you.|`|2CYfjPA6aa	Well the Virgo rising would make you appear innocent, since Virgo represents the virgin, and people under the virgo sign are usually very practical, innocent, good natured, down to earth, and obedient. But you also have Libra in your chart, and Libras are an air sign, which are more "wild" than an earth sign like virgo.|`|g0evAXSGaa	not for me, but people take me for being a little more... well, stupid then i am. idk why, maybe i am stupid<br>  rising- sagittarius<br>  sun- libra<br>  moon- sagittarius<br>  mars- scorpio<br>  venus- libra|`|7i9zha6Oaa	lol|`|cLgwmcfwaa	All About You<br>   Earth/Air (Sun in earth + Ascendant in air, or Sun in air + Ascendant in earth)<br>  These people are seldom at the mercy of their feelings, because they tend to face themselves and situations in an impersonal and sensible way. In any area of interest they are organized and systematic thinkers, yet capable of materializing ideas that seem vague and far-fetched. It would be wise for Earth/Air people to try to be more spontaneous and emotionally receptive, in order to experience things in a more authentic and all-embracing way. They shouldn't have to know everything in advance and foresee all eventualities, but instead discover the benefits of just going with the flow. Learning to be more intimate and personal and to trust their intuition will do wonders.<br>  --------------------<br>   Libra/Sagittarius <br>  The combination of the Sun and the Moon in your chart forms a nature that is aspiring and expansive. You are highly adventurous and apt to move about and seek a variety of experiences. You are open and accepting of others, and to you, people are people. No one is more openhearted and unbiased than you. You have a positive spirit and the feeling that your ideals are workable, and you hold to them until they are absolutely proved not to be. This extends to very much to people as you believe that everyone is essentially good, that good will triumph over evil, that dogs can live with cats, and so on. You expect happy endings as you're an incurable optimist. You are outgoing and eager to meet people, but often you give them the sense that you haven't much time for them. There is little that is stable or secure about you, and you seem so much on the go that roots are never sunk deeply in anyone or even in any social issue. You achieve success through charm and positive efforts, but being abstract in your thinking, you become visionary and impractical in business and personal affairs.<br>  ------------------<br>   Venus in Water, Mars in Air (Romantic Water, Airy Desires): You are a study in contradictions when it comes to love! You are a sensitive companion who enjoys amusing, comforting, and inspiring your partner. You don’t generally come across as sensitive as you truly are, tending to hide this sensitivity behind a playful and lighthearted manner. You are very respectful of a partner’s rights and individuality. You tend to fall in love easily, yet at the same time hesitantly. You are both a private person and a people person. This dichotomy may be confusing for a partner, and even for you at times! You view sex as an emotional release, yet you also tend to appraise it with intellectual detachment. As a result, you can come across as intimate and doting one day, and cool—even self-possessed—the next! You are a sensual lover, and you are forever drawn to relationships. You are extremely charming, as you are both playful and warm at once. You are not an easy lover to understand, however. You alternate between sexual adventurousness and vulnerability. Your lover will frequently wonder if it’s freedom you need most, or if it’s closeness and intimacy that is most important to you. The truth is, you need both, but it can be hard to know when you need what. <br>  -----------------------------<br>  Mars in Libra - Venus in Scorpio<br>  <br>  With Mars in Libra your energy in matters of achievement is more tempered than other signs. You're a lover, not a fighter. Since you are overly concerned with the other person and their needs with Mars in Libra, you can make an excellent, accommodating lover indeed. You must be assured that your partner is thrilled before you can enjoy yourself. At the same time however, you could suffer with some underlying anger and aggression if your own physical needs are being ignored. Although you won't come right out and say this, you expect your partner to know what to do to satisfy you since you go so out of the way to ensure their pleasure. Mars in Libra is concerned with energy balance and equality. <br>  If Venus is in the sign Scorpio then you have an intense need to love with more physical and emotional depth and commitment than perhaps any other sign. Love is not taken lightly and once love has infiltrated your soul it's there for good. Venus in Scorpio needs to be in control of this decision to fall in love however so it's likely you'll end up being initially guarded and slow to reveal yourself to a prospective lover as you size up the genuine potential of long term romance. Sex is the ultimate expression of love to Venus in Scorpio; however you're not interested in casual sex per se. You want intimacy. You want to know the good, bad and ugly when you're in love with someone and experience the ultimate pleasures and pain together.|`|zOU5fNHWaa	...sigh...your human. Humans have free will.

bribxhsdaa	That's a really well produced record. I think Cool n Dre are kinda hit and miss but that record was definitely a hit.<br>  <br>  I think that album is a classic...Especially if you look at the mainstream west coast material that was coming out before Game dropped...|`|TrPySdXFaa	games better|`|FAaePWPWaa	I thought50 cent's verse was pretty good that was the old 50 Cent that we used to know. "Coming up I Was confused, my mama kissing a girl. Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world. Daddy ain't around probably out commititing felonies my favorite rapper used to sing check check out my melody..." Now that I think about it that was a hot 50 verse reminds me of Hustler's Ambition where 50 was actually lyrical.<br>  <br>  Of course The Game's Verse was great. He was lyrical and spoke the truth. He wasn't rhymin about money and hoes. "10 G's will take your daughter out of air forces believe me homie I know all about losses. Im from Compton where the wrong colors be cautious one phone call have your brother dumped on morses" Nothing but lyrical. One of his best songs. The Documentary was a great album<br>  <br>  The beat is great. I love it. <br>  <br>  The song will be considered a classic under The Game's career resume. But as a classic in hip hop? I don't know. It's possible the song is great. If the song is ever considered a classic it definately won't be for like 5 or 10 more years|`|N8DZ81mkaa	i think its a great song period, but the fact that 50 and the game are performin together in it just makes it that much better. since they dont like each other anymore and they probably wont ever do another song together again that makes hate it or love it even better to me.|`|KF9751Lyaa	^^^ Cool & Dre, NOT Dr. Dre (To The Idiot Above Me) ^^^<br>  Yeah, It's A Great Song, The Game's Verse Was Better Than 50's<br>  The beat is sweet too =]|`|oKckkzz9aa	Most songs produced by Dre are classics.|`|6xRbnCISaa	that is one of my fav Game song.

hk6Lp6Vraa	I believe tattoo grew rapidly in popularity in the 1970s that kind of evolved as on of the anti-social antics of the 60s into a full blown fashion trend of the 80s, 90s, up until today.|`|jxbNUjuWaa	check this out :]<br>  <br>  1850 - 1900 - Tattoos used to be the bastion of carnival freak shows, with people flocking to the circus to see the amazing tattooed Lady.<br>  1900 - 1950 - Tattoos in the early 20th century indicated a Sailor or Marine.  In these cases, they did not have any social stigma, except that tattoos were generally indicative of enlisted men.  Few Navy or Marine officers dared to draw on their body.<br>  1950 - 1960 - In the early 1950's, tattoos became popular with the criminal element, mostly outlaw bikers, social outcasts and the mentally ill.  It was during this time tattoos took on a more ominous reputation.<br>  1960 - 1990 - This was the age of "prison tats" where having a tattoo indicated to some people that you were a tough, ignorant, convicted felon.<br>  1990-2008 - Today we see hordes of low-class young people drawing on themselves with free abandon, (almost 30% of people in the 1980's).  These people do not understand that a tattoo may effectively prohibit them from pursuing a professional career, regardless of their other qualifications.|`|KsyQ3SoMaa	I think it started as a tribal thing.

AA11346438	i'm not sure what to do to enunciate better, but drinking water and staying away from phlegm inducing foods before you rhyme can help. i wouldn't recommend yelling unless your music sounds like MOP or something. keep in mind that artists like Eric Sermon(and one of the dudes in MOP) have a lisp when they rap and can still hold it down.

tDaU7eYXaa	Go to City Music Store or Russo if there is one around. There should be a lot of instrument rental stores. They're very cheap, you can exchange for bigger sizes, and rent or buy. If you rent, you can exchange for bigger sizes and repair for free. If you buy, you can exchange sizes. The good thing is that they supply rosin, bow, and violin. If it is broken, exchange it. In fact, you can keep exchanging until you get the exact one you want. Also, buy a tuner and metronome. These are only around 20 bucks at the rental store. If a rental store doesn't have this whole package, forget it. Just buy one. But they're pretty expensive. You have to replace the bow every year. And make sure the music store explains EVERYTHING!!! Do your homework on how to care for violins.|`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	You have to try really hard to smash a quality violin.  Cheaper ones are easy to break.  Sure they'll scratch and chip, but you can sand & revarnish them later.  <br>  <br>  The important thing is to get her one small enough for her to handle.  They are made of hard wood, so they can be quite heavy.  You want to make sure the chin rest is the right size, too.<br>  <br>  Go to your local music shop/band supply store and rent one.  The store personnel will fit her for one and make sure she understands she needs to be careful with it.  Plus, as she gets older, you can exchange it for a bigger one.<br>  <br>  Also, get a hard case instead of a soft one.  I don't know why, but it seems in later years soft cases (like the ones for cellos) have become more common for violins, fiddles, & violas.  I don't get it.  <br>  <br>  The neck is the one thing you must be careful of.  A drop from a decent height just right will break the neck and  you will have to get it repaired.  The important thing is that she is taught to handle it properly and only has it out of its case while using it. The teacher you choose should make sure she understands proper handling.  <br>  <br>  Oh, and buy lots of strings.  They break a lot.   No way around that.|`|AA11294714	I'm a violin teacher for many decades, and in my opinion, you should not buy an expensive violin for a four year old.  I don't like the word "cheap," which implies poor quality.  I wouldn't go to ebay or spend $50 on some junk, but you can get a decent student violin for under $200.  You'll need a 1/16 size.

oMYGtqubaa	YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!!<br>  <br>  I agree 100%.   One is a misjudgement and a little perverted... but the other is SHEER VIOLENCE!!!<br>  <br>  But, that is kind of the way... especially American society is...  Sexual Misconduct is many times seen as worse than Violence... which makes absolutely NO SENSE.<br>  <br>  Look at the Janet Jackson fiasco... for a mili-second of boob, was this UNBELIEVABLE outcry....    But,  I watched an episode of "Third Watch" where there was 10 minutes of GRAPHIC VIOLENCE and I NEVER heard ANYBODY protesting or even being outraged by it.<br>  <br>  We are, for whatever reason, a violent culture & its disturbing we can try to EXCUSE violent behavior, because we like somebody's music or whatever...  but God forbid you do something sexually that we don't like....  that's another story.|`|ey8aWCPUaa	Eh, I think R. Kelly should have followed the law in that situation, regardless of the fact the girl wanted it. He should have realized she's a young girl, and they don't make very smart judgment calls.<br>  <br>  R. Kelly WAS at fault, he should have used his own common sense.<br>  <br>  But, I will say R. Kelly is not as bad as Chris Brown, since R. Kelly is just kinda pervish, and Chris Brown actually beat the **** out of his girlfriend.|`|3374675d4d1c946b84751d377b56cc7aaa	whatever your right its not the same. r. kelly is a perv. and chris messed up and no its not right but ppl do stupid stuff. i really think she provoked it or falsified some of it. her side is too sketchy.|`|SIaTnM5Qaa	ok?...|`|vGZEo8Dbaa	the minor thing is a tough one...some minors are mature enough and selfaware enough to make a decision like having sex with an older person....but most are not.  Sometimes, this decision is made because they fear they may disappoint the person or need their approval, or they are scared, or for many many other reasons...<br>  <br>  it has the potential to do life long damage to a kid...so its very possible that although what Chris Brown did was terrible...Rkelley might be equal or even worse.|`|I7OZ4glFaa	people jus bein stupid makin up rumors and just aint got nothin else betta to talk about yea it was wrong for R Kelly people change i think we all know he learned his lesson and chris brown i agree with u on that 1 men should never hit a girl thats worse cuz he could have beat her to death but rapin can give her stds pregnancy or aids which she could of died from either 1 so both situations are bad but i would say chris brown's is worse|`|ci6f63Ifaa	In our society, the public will forgive a wife/girlfriend beater over an alleged child molester any day.  In this country, having consensual sex with a minor is legally classified as third-degree rape. <br>  <br>  If you are convicted of this, not only do you go to jail but when you are released, you are required by law to register as a convicted sex offender and child molester. Not to mention the fact that while you are in jail, you will not be popular there either.  Rapists and child molesters are despised in prison even by other inmates (even convicts have mothers, sisters, daughters, etc.).<br>  <br>  In R. Kelly's case, he wasn't convicted in a court of law but he has been convicted (for the most part) in the court of public opinion (which is damaging by itself).  <br>  <br>  Chris Brown on the other hand, is seen as a wife/girlfriend beater.  This crime is not viewed favorably either but is seen by society as not being as bad as being a rapist/child molester.  <br>  <br>  Both of these guys are rich, spoiled, stars with huge egos and neither of them deserve sympathy. They both did some stupid stuff but Chris Brown gets more of a pass because of how society views their respective crimes.|`|eVK2zZsOaa	I would say they are both wrong. I don't think they are equal because they are two different crimes but both are violations against women (well in R.Kelly's case it was a minor). You can't say R. Kelly is better than Chris Brown because he didn't punch a girl in the face. The fact is Kelly has a rumored history of seeking out and dating underage girls and that in itself says that he has a problem. There is something wrong with a man who beats his wife/girlfriend but there is also something equally wrong with a grown man seeks out underage girls. And if you recall R.Kelly's wife (now ex-wife) did accuse him of domestic violence, she even got a restraining order against him so he is also an alleged woman beater. The fact is we don't know what happened that night between Rihanna and Chris Brown...I prefer to wait to hear them both give interviews before I pass judgment on the situation.<br>  <br>  And Chris Brown isn't getting a free pass. His career will definitely suffer (it won't end) but it will suffer. He will go through being labeled as a violent, crazy woman beater and will suffer the consequences of his actions greatly. Nobody is disputing the fact that what he did was wrong but it is only fair to him that we all at least let all the facts come out before we continue to crucify him.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	In Kelly's case it is considered statutory rape for having sex with a minor . Even if it's consensual. Go figure. They were willing to do it. But according to the law, he was supposed to say no. I personally think the "i would like to pee on you".is what brought him down .<br>   That's a pretty sick thing. <br>  Chris Brown on the other hand just let his temper flare and get out of hand. What if Rihanna beat the hell out of Chris Brown.? It would mean nothing then. The law is flawed. very flawed, man.
nnoMVbLkaa	I used to love Mad TV, but my interest for it has started to fade away. In my opinion they are not as funny as they used to be. I still have a weakness for Stuart(Michael McDonald) he always gets me. I love that character "Look what I can do." lol. They rarely ever show him anymore, maybe that's why I don't watch that much.<br>  <br>  I agree with you though it has became a little pointless.|`|JRKJ1w3Zaa	yes the ones back in the early 2000's and before was madtv's prime time.<br>  <br>  it's ok now though just not as hilarious as before.|`|ZUL3drNgaa	Bon Qui Qui<br>  Can I Have Your Number?<br>  <br>  those are both funny. but i dont watch it much.|`|3ZpMQjtpaa	I still find it a riot.

I actually prefer MadTv to SNL although SNL has more celebrity hosts. I think most of their skits are hilarious, some are  the line of inappropriate but that's comedy. : )|`|5u1G3Qb8aa	no way! <br>  <br>  maybe every once and a while "Can i have your number" "Bon Qui Qui"<br>  <br>  But thats like it!|`|rj0hJku1aa	my little croissant!<br>  <br>  haha.but thats the only one i like :/<br>  and bon qui qui lmao.<br>  but otherwise NO.

uUzbqGh5aa	Too many things are happening on Y&R at once. A s/l is created almost everyday without them tying up the hundreds that were going on before. <br>  I'm guessing Neil will be pissed with Karen for telling Tyra that lie she told today, then she'll reveal she knows about "the kiss" and then things will start to go downhill from there.........creating more drama!|`|RqeoCyzYaa	i hope that  tyra & anna stay gone, and anna,s singing  is gone forever!|`|75zggy81aa	yes- the whole storyline is boring and annoying and now its going to get worse! the only way for it to get better is if tyra and anna run away successfully and never come back to gc!|`|VAp5ICaBaa	Too long I can't stand Tyra or Ana the whole storyline is so boring I fast forward through it all the time|`|uKXgg9heaa	I love the whole Tyra and Neil story line, but I want Ana gone to boarding school somewhere.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Yeah, it is dragging..|`|FdNYv4D9aa	The storyline is the PRIMARY reason I bother watching Y&R, because I enjoy Eva Pigford, Nia Peeples, and Kristoff, as well as Jamia. It's DIFFERENT then the rest of the baggaged mess on the show and isn't really inter-connected to anything else, and has a love story at the center (with a beautiful young girl).<br>  <br>  I'm enjoying it, and I hope they keep it going until Drucilla returns, even if it takes another year. I have no problems with it at all and wish they'd show more of it each day!|`|WJW4qOlUaa	Seems like all the soaps I been watching are just dragging things out for so long! I am not happy with Neil and Tyra thing!
Klb4ZYcVaa	There really isn't real sex in a movie, that might be a legal issue. If there is EVER real sex in a movie, that would be considered porn.<br>  <br>  & NO, I saw Revolutionary Road, the sex was alittle heavy, but it was only one. Same thing with The Reader, yes, they were nude, the sex scenes are very heavy, but that's why they're called "actors". GOOD actors, at that.|`|29d696b2b163821f5d4e2854064c4a2faa	No, that would be Porn.|`|aYNoQvfMaa	It's simulated sex.<br>  <br>  Unsimulated sex in film is not necessarily porn, though. David Carradine has stated the sex scenes between him and Barbara Hershey in Scorsese's rather forgettable film "Boxcar Bertha," were unsimulated. Also, in Nagisa Oshima's "In the Realm of the Senses" the sex scenes are unsimulated. Neither is porn, but they are the exception not the rule.
M1ymLE9Paa	I don't know what Sonny has against Spinelli, but I find the way he treats him appalling.  I think it's partly b/c he just doesn't understand Spinelli.  And maybe he's also a bit jealous that his former best-friend Jason is now BFF w/Spinelli instead.  It really doesn't matter why, in my opinion.  It's just really wrong for Sonny to act that way.  <br>  <br>  I can't stand Kate.  She's a stuck-up snob.  I think the show would be better w/o her.|`|AA12315431	The way Sonny treats Spinelli is part of the reason why I can no longer stand Sonny. That day he bashed Spinelli's head into the wall at Kate's office was awful and I can't believe Kate wasn't appalled at that. I was also kind of disappointed that Jason didn't get pi$$ed about that either. Spinelli had never done anything to Sonny. I realize that Spinelli just annoys him but that is no reason to treat him wit the contempt that he does. Hell, Sonny treats Ric better than Spinelli and look at the awful things he has done to Sonny. I don't care if he is his brother. Ric is just a self-loathing douchebag.<br>  <br>  And yes, Kate is really annoying but I also feel a little bad for her because all she wanted to do is get married and have a life with Sonny (god knows why) and during her time with him she was shot twice, Carly was always in her face, and Sonny cheated on her with Carly. Do I like her no, but I try and be fair and she has been dealt a crappy hand ever since she came into Port Charles including what Trevor did to her.|`|ZmGOL8kCaa	Somebody asks this question every other week. You can't honestly say that if you knew Spinelli, you wouldn't find him annoying. I hate Spinelli, he's so annoying.<br>  <br>  I also hate Kate right now. She's so smug all the time when she has  no reason to be. She's so clingy and snobby. And when she suddenly fall back in love and want to get together with Sonny? And since when does it take more than a month to tell someone about a freaking video tape? These writers suck.|`|GrE1UM2Saa	don't like Kate she is unloyal to her family and doesn't give a crap about her family and I for one don't have time for people who are ashamed of their family and when the family did nothing wrong to her.  Also sonny just doesn't like people who are different I guess.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I like Kate. I believe Sonny is jealous that Spinelli came in and became friends with Jason and "replaced" him as the best friend. Simple as that, jealous and he is a moron right now too. Sonny shoudn't be talking to anyone like that, he got enough of it growing up with the step dad from Hell!|`|D3Fyxj0raa	i know sonny thinks hes better than everyone else and i hate kate she is so annoying but then again so is Olivia

9pLI73pqaa	This is a guess at an answer, since I do not know your abilities. If you are thinking about changing instruments, sooner is better than later. However you will likely need private lessons before you could play in a middle school band. Your director has reasons to take it seriously. His job rating probably depends to some extent on how well the band performs, especially in contests. On the other hand, really top-notch sax players are hard to find! You could refine the tone of your saxophone and become the best player in your state for about the same effort as learning a new instrument. (BTW, sax and trumpet are pitched differently. I presume your sax is an E^b and most trumpets are B^b.)|`|SdLveWtWaa	I Play Paino. I enjoy it alot. Once you get good and in audulthood you can just sit down and start playing. so i think piano would be good. If you are willing to put an a effort!!

XyOsRQvgaa	i thought it was alright. the way it's filmed gets really annoying, but it was okay. i wasn't particularly scared, but i don't scare easily (: and if you haven't seen it already, don't watch the trailer. i'd tell you why but then i'd be ruining the movie for you.|`|vVeWiYrSaa	It was a good movie........kind of if you seen cloverfeild then you seen this movie.|`|xXHiyuBaaa	it's not all that scary, but it was alright.|`|XCVFEAC8aa	it was alright, nothing special!
nmYokULsaa	When i first started to watch naruto it was pretty annoying. but if you continue on watching it trust me the show will get better. but naruto shippuuden is better than naruto. they were just 12-13 year olds. preteens are annoying but in shippuden they're 15-16 year olds so they matured. So you should give naruto a chance. Naruto barely say believe it later in the show. sakura will still be annoying but she'll get better.|`|WS1rqp0Gaa	If you don't like  Naruto,shut the **** up!!!<br>  Some people like it while some don't.It's their own problem.And let me tell you something...If you say that Naruto is no good,can you make a better anime than Naruto??If you can,prove it to me.If you cannot,shut the hell up because you have no right to judge other people's work.<br>  I really HATE people like you.<br>  <br>  And i can tell that you watch dubs.Go and watch subs and your option of the anime will change.|`|0LCCayaDaa	Believe it hasn't been a used catch phrase since the Chuunin exams in the Viz dub.<br>  <br>  Nothing is great, it's just the standard Shounen anime that's focused on action and cool hand symbols that the tween and early teen demographic dig. If you expect some deep intricate story, then that would be silly.|`|frqfB0usaa	When you first watch Naruto (I will admit i find it not as entertaining than later on) Its kinda boring. But once you get into the main story line (Not the fillers <--- They're annoying lol =3) But personally i find the manga much more intresting (Thats because its futher along the story and so far its exciting)|`|XkidpdPWaa	Yeah, I don't really like it either. Well I guess it's personal preference.|`|wic6ut7Qaa	It's pretty dang overrated, if you asked me. I used to like it a lot, but the more I branced out and got into other anime like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Monster, and One Piece, I started to realize just how played out and cliched Naruto really is.<br>  <br>  The only times it's actually worth watching is whenever Norio Matsumoto directs the animation*, which is like in 4 episodes, and 1 more in shippuden. <br>  <br>  And let's not forget how much it rips off of Hunter x Hunter, a much better series.<br>  <br>  The Chuunin Exam on Naruto is almost a complete ripoff of the Hunter Exams in HxH. <br>  <br>  [[taken from another source]]<br>  <br>  * Both anime starts off with the main characters’ childhood where each orphan lead character are twelve-year old boys <br>  <br>  * Gon Freecs (HxH) eventually gains 3 friends on his quest to be a hunter while Naruto Uzumaki (Naruto) becomes part of Team 7 in ninja school and also gains 3 main friends in the process <br>  <br>  * While Gon starts to develop a deeper friendship with Killua (an assassin), Naruto starts off as a rival with Sasuke (from another clan); each pair eventually becoming best friends <br>  <br>  * Gon goes all out to take Killua away from his own deadly assassin family, Naruto goes all out to retrieve Sasuke from his best friend’s very powerful and dangerous mentor <br>  <br>  * Both undergo different skill trainings and studies, for one to become a Hunter, and the other to become a Ninja <br>  <br>  * Both anime deal with certain energies or powers: the concept of Nen (Chi) and Jutsu (Chakra). Each learns of these at some point in their training and use these energies and related concepts when the need arises, thus making it their source of power. <br>  [[end source]]<br>  <br>  It also rips off Ninku, another older fighting anime. Tell me if this move looks familiar:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmEDEw7GWd0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmEDEw7GW...</a><br>  <br>  And to anyone who's seen the latest chapters where he uses the RasenShuriken, remember this?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTYB0wtgNLQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTYB0wtgN...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  * Norio Matsumoto directed:<br>  -Sasuke vs. Orochimaru<br>  -Lee vs. Gaara<br>  -Hokage vs. Orochimaru<br>  -Naruto vs. Sasuke<br>  -Kakashi/Shikamaru** vs. Hidan/Kazuku (Shippuden)<br>  <br>  ** These two are among the few worthy characters in this series.<br>  <br>  Matsumoto works on other anime as well, so keep an eye out for his name. He draws amazing fights.|`|Ggqchtb1aa	There actually is nothing great about it.<br>  <br>  The catchphrase itself "Believe it" is just something thrown in there in the english version, because whenever Naruto talks he usually says "Dattebayo" which is just a little thing you can put at the end of a sentence in Japanese basically, so the english translators had to fill in the mouth movements with something.<br>  <br>  Other than that, nothing in it is good. It's all so cliche. Fight. Main character starts losing. He gets mad. He uses a super big attack. He wins.<br>  <br>  All the characters are immensely annoying and overdone, much like the story.|`|6UgFvIqoaa	first of all.... lol. its about i boy named naruto whos and orphan. he wants to be hokage even though hes a demon called the nine tail fox. people doubt him and all that so thats why the "catch phrase" is there. Sakura is the girl Naruto likes and Sakura loves Saskue. Saskue holds an grudge on his brother because his brother,Itachi killed the Uchia clan which is both of their families. Saskue hates everybody. But heres a spoiler *itachi had no choice because of 2 elederly people of the whole Green village*. anywho Naruto wants to be hokage. he has great strenght and everything. Sakura is really strong. I mean she was taught by the 5th hokage and all that and defeated one of the Hakaske. but thats the whole point. hes kinda annoying though. the great thing about is that it makes you think. everything is a puzzle and you have to figure it out. Naruto is a ninja and so is everyone else. What im trying to say is...   watch everything from the beggining and find evrything out. or watch cartoon network on saturdays at 9 o c|`|Krs6O0T7aa	Naruto is a cool show, in my opinion. <br>  Sasuke doesn't treat sakura like that. It's not true. They help each other at times.<br>  But it's true that Sasuke is emo...<br>  Naruto's voice is annoying, yeah, but it's cool.<br>  "Believe it" hasn't been heard in a while. In the Japanese version, it's "Dattebayo."<br>  <br>  Right now, actually, people are starting to like Naruto more than yugioh. it's more complicated to them>.|`|3BfmNEdPaa	The good thing about it is that is has to do with a kid that grew up rejected and it's kind of like looking at someone that grew up in the ghetto and is working their way to the top. He has changed lives of snotty people. And it talks about real things that happen in life. if you took the time to watch it you'd see that it is a very engaging series.|`|7gmdPXc4aa	Watch the Jap version, voices are always better in Jap. But if its not for you then don't watch it!! <br>  <br>  Seriously! Why do you feel the need to come on here and b**** and moan about it?!! Just to annoy fans of the anime? Or, to get others who don't like the anime to agree with you?? POINTLESS!! <br>  <br>  Look I shouldn't have to point this out, most people learn this as a child - everyone is different, we all have different likes and dislikes. You do not need to come on here and b**** because your not into an anime that alot of other people are!!|`|3fEfuPWOaa	Bright colors + indecipherable plot = Ratings gold|`|jInNKopIaa	nothing, it sucks|`|A5ZVXcVzaa	man no offence but naruo is not that bad  i watch it my self
MRoF4VO3aa	It's one of my favourite movies of all time, and I'm a tough reviewer when it comes to films.<br>  <br>  The scenes between Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger are mostly kissing, although you do see a scene of them thrusting against each other (clothed).  That only lasts for about five seconds.<br>  <br>  The scenes between the main characters and their wives are more graphic; bare breasts are shown.|`|3ZpMQjtpaa	It's good, the gay scenes aren't too graphic, but the straight sex scenes, without showing nudity, are a bit intense. But that shouldn't stop you (unless you're too young); it's an amazing movie and had me crying at the end.|`|kXxaUnSUaa	Yep, it's a really great movie, very powerful, I'd definitely recommend it.<br>  <br>  The gay love scenes are not really graphic at all.|`|qFIFJFhdaa	You can find all your answers here"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388795/parentalguide" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388795/pare...</a>|`|EGR1BQxOaa	It is not that graphic but very emotional flick. Good story|`|VQzYYYaEaa	The sexual interaction shared by Jack and Ennis is usually rough-and-tumble. Newsweek calls it "fierce and full-blooded." There's lots of pushing, shoving, grappling and holding. In fact, one bit of foreplay/horseplay gets so physical that it ends up in a short-lived fistfight. Several scenes show the two men groping each other and kissing. (Half the time it looks more like forceful mashing than kissing.) Once, the camera keeps staring as kisses give way to anal sex. (There's no nudity shown, but the sequence is explicit; it includes sexual motions and sounds.)<br>  <br>  Ennis and Jack both have heterosexual sex, too. Ennis and Alma get physical twice. Both scenes are graphic; one includes breast nudity. The day they meet, Jack and Lureen make out and prepare to go further. Lureen is so eager to make it happen that she strips off her shirt and bra to show Jack (and moviegoers) her breasts.<br>  <br>  But those straight relationships are shown to ultimately matter little to Jack and Ennis. They just can't wait to cheat on their wives when the opportunities present themselves.<br>  <br>  Also, we see Jack washing his clothes—all of them. (He's seen nude from the side and back.) Jack and Ennis jump naked into the water for a swim (seen from a distance).

Women can tend to be weaker than men, that's just life.

I don't know why everyone is taking this way out of proportion. Sure he beat up Rhianna and I believe he should be charged just as much as a regular person should be. He made a mistake and we all do. He should be charged but everyone makes mistakes. Celebs have done way worse things like drinking and driving so none of them actually have killed anyone yet, but I think drinking and driving is a much more serious offence then assault. When you drink and drive you have an impaired judgement and a weapon at your hands. Overall, I think he should be charged just as anyone else would but people should leave him alone and let him deal with his problems.|`|3ff7fbbf6ec3ee979b59d7290a91816daa	I gladly will...!

4vQZ3kv7aa	If your drama teacher says that you should work in leadership and doesn't let you to do any of the available roles, then it means that this is not your thing. Your teacher was at the uni to do what she does. She knows what she does, too. She tries to suggest you that you don't really have anything to offer SO FAR. In this case, try the leadership position and see if you like it. If you didn't do anything like that before and you just THINK it's rubbish then you're probably wrong. What if the leadership is good fun? How do you know? Maybe this time (if you did it before) it will be great! Try and see. There's nothing to lose, really. However of you really cannot stand it and want to be an actress then work on your acting skills even more and more. You'll improve and then you will have an experience. Then, your teacher will notice your determination, hard work and improvements in acting. If this will help, then get prepared for next year! By having a leadership position now, you'll know next time what is rubbish and what's not (leadership or acting?). Go on Monday. Good luck!|`|SfUOWfp5aa	they've  given you a leadership because he/she or your director thinks that you can handle the job properly so it could be the reason why your director wants to 2 put in the particular job.<br>  <br>  have a go!!! nothing wrong in just trying<br>  Best Of Luck|`|NnkcTBpjaa	hmmmmmmm, why would anyone want to be in a play that bad? let me guess, theres a boy u like in the play, and a kissing seen with him RIGHTTTTTTTT.....|`|dpYfLgMWaa	if its really something you want you should go for it or you may end up asking what if about it
AA11202477	Well my vote will always go for Sawyer. I liked Jack at the beginning of the show, but then he wore thin. Now I watch the reruns late at night on SciFi and I understand why. Jack always had a self-righteousness about him that got on my nerves quickly. It was like "me great doctor, you kneel down". The best example I saw of that was last night when Shannon had an asthma attack, no inhaler and Jack agreed Sawyer should be tortured because of course he had them, right? Well, Sawyer didn't, and then along comes Sun, and makes a paste of eucalyptus leaves which she rubs on Shannon's chest and has her inhale, and lo and behold, asthma attack all gone. Some doctor! Sawyer, on the other hand, has always known and accepted his limitations, but will come through for anybody when its needed. Considering Kate's history, she needs a man who is truly strong, not just strong in his own eyes.|`|zovrJ0yXaa	kate shares different things with jack and sawyer. sawyer obviously gets her better, but the show set jack and kate up from the beginning, and its continued that way. i'd vote for sawyer, but thats only because jack has been very annoying of late|`|nU858xQxaa	sawyers a jackass, but at least he's not a drug addict like jack. i'd say sawyer. jack and kate are too "meant for each other" but sawyer and kate are more alike and they seem to have a much easier to like each other relationship. sawyer.|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	I love Sawyer and if I cant get stranded with him ,,my next choice would be Kate > I think they have better chemistry together .

So is he all by himself though too!|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	I think they're both bad for her...she fights a lot with both of them. But I think Sawyer is currently less of a mess.|`|AA10954273	Neither.  She has no chemistry with either of them.<br>  <br>  Jack is often dull by himself.  When he's with Kate the two of them are enough to induce a coma.<br>  <br>  Sawyer is great with everyone.  He sparkles with Hurley, Sayid, even Juliet.  But when he's with Kate he's as boring as Jack.<br>  <br>  Kate kills every scene she's in.  Sayid is the only guy she has any chemistry at all with.  This stupid triangle is the worst part of the show.|`|14c690b99c03a819fd4f7cbcd14bac5eaa	I think that she'd be good with either of them, but I personally like Sawyer better anyway, so I'll say that she should be with him.

Y1aAGPURaa	Hope you all enjoy this cutie:<br>  <br>  A baby turtle was standing at the bottom of a large tree and with a deep sigh, started to climb. About an hour later, he reached a very high branch and walked along to the end. He turned and spread all four flippers and launched himself off the branch. On landing at the bottom in a pile of soft, dead leaves, he shook himself off, walked back to the bottom of the tree and with a sigh started to climb.<br>  <br>  About an hour later, he again reached the very high branch, walked along, turned, spread his flippers and flung himself off the branch. Again, he landed on the bottom, shook himself off, went to the bottom of the tree, sighed and started climbing. <br>  <br>  Watching these proceedings from the end of the branch were two little birds.

zovrJ0yXaa	*spoilers*<br>  <br>  a large part of the shows mythology is the nature of destiny. a lot of the characters are pawns of destiny, and it was meant for them to end up on the island. charlies destiny was to die. he escapes a few times but he gets it in the end|`|BtK9nSalaa	I loveee Charlie he was my favorite!!!! ok well when the hatch blew up Desmond could see the future and he saw Charlie dying: drowning,being shot in the throat in the arrow, slipping on a rock and breaking his neck and being electrocuted, when the vessel is 80 miles of the shores they cannot make contact because an underwater Dharma station called the looking glass is blocking all signals to and from the island. so some1 has 2 flip the switch so it can be unblocked. that person ,Desmond saw was Charlie and things wouldn't be the same if he ddidn'tdie and do it,. charlie flips it, talks to Desmond's gf Penny who says that vessel is not hers.

lpyWVR2oaa	You probably enjoy the thrill of a new attraction and lose interest just as easily with this placement BUT it has to do with more than the Venus sign. Although Venus in Aries is in its detrimental position and not considered positive in general, there is not enough evidence to point to your inability to keep relationships.<br>  <br>  What is your Moon sign - what do you need to feel emotionally secure, safe? This is also how you instinctively retreat when you're feeling threatened. If the Moon faces hard aspects from the other planets, this is a sure sign of having trouble keeping relationships too. also, look to Venus to see if there are harsh aspects to it.|`|cLgwmcfwaa	taurus. very even-tempered and not too emotional or too unemotional.<br>  Aries, very strong, quick-tempered, Choleric-like, demanding, definately decisive and always has its mind made up.|`|zbTpERMWaa	In GENERAL Venus in Aries, or any first house position inh your natal birth chart is politely called "freight train to hell." Meaning you chug head on full speed ahead, and like the symbol for Aries, the ram you end up butting your head! U can change partners alot & get involved too soon. Think first & take it slow.Determine if u really want to get involved with this person. Now, u do not state what your ascendant or rising is, as that would place that Venus in Aries in one of the 12 astrological houses & could alter it either way.Being a Sun sign Taurus female tends toward stubborness, so learn to  be the sweet, soft, sensual side of Taurus female. Hope I helped.|`|m9MMxjyjaa	lol...

P8gGMlbIaa	Which anime devil lady? I believe there are several if you count the Japanese word Oni to be demon, devil or ogre.<br>  <br>  Or do you mean the actually anime titled Devil Lady by Go Nagai creator of Devilman.<br>  <br>  I haven't seen much of it, but I am familiar with Go Nagai's work. He's known as the bad boy of anime and manga. I believe Devil Lady started from the pages of Devilman and Go Nagai just gave her, her own short series.<br>  <br>  Very violent and sexual to near pornographic levels, which is why Go Nagai is the bad boy. The anime differs from the manga. It's ok if you're into that sort of stuff.

KjYxk1S2aa	'Invader Zim' is easily my favourite cartoon of all time--it's hilarious. My older brother is 20 and I'm 17, and we're still way into it.<br>  <br>  My favourite animated movie is 'Tekkonkinkreet'--but it's hard to find and a bit violent/disturbing at parts, so not appropriate as a fun 'cartoon', persay, and definitely not good for kids.<br>  <br>  Also, 'Chowder' and 'The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack' are just great. They're newer.<br>  <br>  If you like anime, try 'Fullmetal Alchemist' (easily one of the better ones) or 'Wolf's Rain'. They're great.<br>  <br>  Hope these help!<br>  <br>  ~Jen|`|Tn8HSLzuaa	South Park is the funniest program I've ever watched - if you're not easily offended watch the episodes online they're hilarious|`|F3KkB4GWaa	Chowder and the Wondrous Misadventures of Flapjack are the two most arsome cartoons ever!

VHxZuaOfaa	he's a celebrity so he will be charged lightly, maybe 2 or 3 yrs in prison. he will come out and make a "comeback" and do all good then he will be on Oprah, talking about how he got help and is currently doing rehab.

YHu0TUxdaa	They left it so it was up to you to decide.|`|ZII6YCk1aa	Well I saw the whole series and Lelouch dies(even though he takes over the world and plans his death) Im not gonna tell you who kills him though!|`|6a212c9c778993f0ddb7d1f87cefdc91aa	Lelouch is not dead.<br>  <br>  If your on the first season it makes it look like he dies. <br>  <br>  *****SPOLIER!*****<br>  <br>  Suzaku just caught him and to him to his father. Charles (Lelouch's dad) got geass from V.V. Charles erased Lelouch's memory and replaces his little sister with a boy named Rollo. <br>  <br>  If you wanna know more then just watch the show.<br>  <br>  Sorry if i'm wrong. I'm not quite done with the show yet.|`|gb6Y6UZHaa	Yes he's alive, due to the following reasons: <br>  <br>  1)When nunnally touched lelouch she was able to see his past memories, such as lelouch did in the first series when he touch CC while she was mind raping suzaku ;p<br>  <br>  2) Back in the world of C, Lelouch matured his geass, and "killed" a person with immortality, his father. This probably transferred his CODE to lelouch for once one has a mature geass they gain the power to get immortality.<br>  <br>  In episode 15 Charles said "Defeat me with the power of Kings, and you shall surpass the power of Kings" He defeated charles with the power of the kings (geass) and surpassed it, got immortality.<br>  <br>  3) No way CC would smile if Lelouch was dead, she loved him, and he was supposed to make her smile. If he died she'd return to that lonesome chick who just wants it all to end. In the entire anime you see a repeated saying of, "youre my"..."im your"...yeah, stuff like that. Its called love folks.<br>  <br>  <br>  4)Throughout the entire series sunrise tries to negotiate nunnally with cranes.<br>  -She began making them in the first season<br>  -In the R2 intro she is seen with a crane flying a rainbow<br>  -In some episode in r2 lelouch is seen playing chess with himself and a crane lying on the chess board.<br>  -At the end there is a crane on the carriage that CC is in<br>  -There isnt a reason for CC to carry a crane really...and if you note its position, it isnt even close to her is far ahead near the driver<br>  -yeah its totally lelouch, and its what reminds him of nunally<br>  <br>  <br>  5) CC couldnt have been speaking with lelouch in the end because<br>  -You cannot speak to the dead unless you are in the world of C, for example as charles did when clovis died<br>  -CC could only speak to Marianna because her geass allowed her to. She had to become dormant in Anya's body to do so, as stated in R2 ep 21.|`|0LCCayaDaa	Unless the show doesn't take its own plot points seriously (and I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't), Lelouch is fine.|`|7a2efb9a491bf91f2d2a622649572fdfaa	hes dead...thats what i think.it makes it more gripping if you think of it that way i think.|`|SY2dabbzaa	dead

gIjnoEi5aa	So, after the completion of Hollywood week the judges chose 36 semi-finalists and divided them into 3 groups. Group one performed on Tuesday and group 2 and 3 will perform in the upcoming two weeks. The highest voted girl, guy, and the third highest voted contestant (regardless of gender), will make it to the top 12. Then from what I understand, Ken Warwick, Idol's executive producer, will allow the judges to bring back about 9-10 of their favorites from the previous semi-finalists on March 5. Each wild card contestant will perform and then the judges will choose the three best to complete the top 12.<br>  <br>  And yes, I'm pretty upset that Michael Sarver beat Anoop out for the 3rd spot in the top 12. (Alexis Grace was the highest voted girl and Danny Gokey was the highest voted guy). Now, Michael IS very likable, but Anoop has a MUCH stronger voice. I just wish he had chosen a song other than, "Angel of Mine," because it didn't showcase his amazing vocal ability. After Anoop's initial auditioned I searched for clips of him on You Tube and I found out that he sang in an all male a cappella (sp?) group for the University of North Carolina. After watching those clips it made me want him to succeed even more. Therefore, I'm going to pray that he makes it in the wild card round because I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY want to see him in the top 12!|`|zdrXmriAaa	Ok so it goes like this.<br>  <br>  The next 3 highest vote-getters (4th 5th and 6th placers) from each group will go back on March 5 for the wild card. They will have a sing-off, and then from their group the judges will chose the last three contestants of the top 12.<br>  <br>  I know, I wanted Anoop to go through too! But then I like Michael too, and I'm pretty sure Anoop's gonna be part of the wild card. :)|`|YxwA5sjwaa	I thought Ricky was one of the best singers in the whole process.  "Song for you" was the best rendition I've heard since Elliot a few seasons back.

DnDXqFTXaa	Will There Really Be A Morning was the name of her biography. The name of the movie about her (very loosely based on the book: if you've read the book you'd know why) is called "Frances" (1982) starring Jessica Lang.

VXQFT341aa	Wow is this a piano piece or guitar? Need more info. Ok I'm usually not that technical. I get the music together then fit the lyrics in after. Or vise verse. If you can sing it then sing the song for her. That's what I did in my band I was in when the lead guitarist and I would write something. We would give the singer an idea of how to sing it then let him put his style so to speak on it. Maybe try that. I wish I could have helped more.

You may want to save your "offering to the porcelain gods" until a day in which case the words "free" or "clear" appear in your horoscope, as these indicate that everything will come out alright.  If it's absolutely necessary that you launch a butt shuttle today, go for it, but be warned that this would not be the advisable course of action.  <br>  <br>  The vibes I'm getting from this particular horoscope get vague after that, so I can't say for sure what the consequences would be if you went against the advice you were given and decide to push some brown, but they could be dire.  If you can hold it, do.

jHDeIPEfaa	I really don't believe she did. I think it could be Miles Laurence whom we haven't seen for quite some time. However, he has never officially left Llanview. He loves Marty and would want to kill anyone that hurts her.<br>  I like Jess and Brody together also. Nash was my favorite guy with her, but I really like Brody also.<br>  You are right about Blair. I had read though that she was supposed to return to her b****y ways.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	No, the killer will not be a major character. It will be someone expendable to the show.|`|ADBMrG87aa	Unfortunately it won't be Marty who turns out to be the killer although it would be funny if it was.  The one logical suspect in my opinion is Miles Lawrence (he's always been obsessed with Marty and he'd hurt anyone who has hurt Marty in anyway).<br>  Which rock have you been living under that you've just this week realized that Blair is such a B**ch?   In all fairness though, if any of us were in Blair's shoes and dating John and he was behaving that way towards Marty, we'd feel threatened by Marty too and would do almost anything to try and get her out of the picture; let's be honest.<br>  I would like to see Jessica and Brody become a couple.|`|AA12390047	I think there's a serial killer in town.  Marty didn't kill anyone. When Blair is truly being a b****, she's at her best.  So convincing.  I think Jessica needs sometime to learn how to be a good mother to her kids and take some time for that, but it looks like she and Brody will be a couple.  She always puts a man ahead of her kids.|`|fab4d863aae6c11ee1163077586edcdaaa	No, I don't think Marty killed Wes.

Put it all together people. He looks exactly like the guy in the promo who was stabbing Blair.  When Ray was on today with the knife and the coat he is obliviously the killer who stabbed Wes to death.  What are you people taking stupid pills.|`|541a474ab7a5993c12cad8067af53dc7aa	I COULDN'T STAND SARAH. ALTHOUGH I LOVED HER AS FLASH.

6NZeItMAaa	Three great evils are apt to dominate Scorpio people when on the animal plane.<br>   <br>  These are anger, jealousy, and passion, and if permitted to hold sway will de-stroy their integrity and ruin their lives. This sign is the natural propagative centre, and the unawakened Scorpio per-son is sometimes a monster of lust. The intense love of praise and flattery is an-other great weakness.<br>  <br>   The husband who does not coax and praise his Scorpio wife has not infrequently a very hard time of it. The education of the male has been different, therefore they are not always so exacting in small things, but when their suspicion and jealousy are fully aroused they want to kill, and sometimes do. <br>  <br>  The undeveloped Scorpio man is very hard to live with peaceably. He will also nag, and pick things and motives to pieces, and throw the whole family into a state of nervousness and fear. <br>  <br>  So it will depend on his personnal development.|`|q3KCDrMAaa	I wish you had given the houses all these things are located in...

You have to be direct when you speak to him. Don't drop hints. He is very honest and loves truth, very 'justice' driven. Very loyal!<br>  <br>  Negative: Horrible temper. If he does get mad at you, he won't speak to you for days, and when he does, he will blow up... Very physical about things, so possibly aggressive in that area. (He needs something active to do when he gets angry or he may start hitting people...) Can get bored easily with people. Opinionated. Doesn't handle someone crying with him well...|`|ZUEocleNaa	He will be very passionate and romantic, considering his Venus and Mars signs. Scorpio is fiercely romantic and sensual. He will expect intelligent and lively discussions with you with Aquarius Moon. Mars in Libra is a bit passive/aggressive in that it comes on strong but then loses some of the energy or something dampens his excitement.

xTioPxaVaa	What's best to one person is not to another, regardless of price.<br>  <br>  A lot of guys lean towards EMG active pickup for metal.  Seymour Duncan now has their Live Wire active pickups.<br>  <br>  For passives, I've always used Duncans, but that's just a personal choice.  I'd look at the Dimebucker (Dimebag Darrell's model), the Invader, or the Distortion Distortion.<br>  <br>  From DiMarzzio, the X2N is about the hottest thing they have as far as output goes.  I've heard a Hamer Standard guitar with a  Tone Zone in the bridge, and it sounds really good with a decent amount of output.<br>  <br>  The thing to remember with passive pickups is that there will always be a trade off between output and frequency response.  The hotter the pickup gets, the higher the inductance and the less high frequency information it's able to put out.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|oM7zA7Jhaa	Go Active man, can't go wrong with EMGs , seymour duncan also have the new blackouts which are the same thing.

OWXI806qaa	The last time we saw Jack's daughter (Kim) was in Season <br>  Five. She basically told Jack that because of who her father was<br>  that she couldn't be around him anymore & that she never<br>  wanted to see him again. <br>  ( I guess that Jack is a dangerous sort of<br>  person to be around, but she was still being pretty selfish in<br>  my opinion )<br>  <br>  But it has been confirmed that Kim will return at the end of this<br>  season. (season 7) And she is apparently going to have a baby<br>  with her. No one knows who the father is yet.<br>  <br>  That's what has been going on with Kim lately, but if you <br>  want her complete history on 24 you can check out<br>  the link below.<br>  <br>  Hope I could help.|`|c3aa57022072b568691d1c70334ad437aa	Kim will return towards the end of the seventh season for 5 episodes.

zLilrd1Haa	No offense....but only the Jonas Brother and Demi Lovato's music videos are good.  In fact, they are really the only really good talent in your list, maybe taylor swift, but definetly look on their official youtube channels.  I know the Jonases and Demi have one but I don't know about Taylor.  O u can also find the JoBros and Demi's music videos on the hollywood records channel too. FYI - Everyone else on this list had their voice changed electronically, so unfortunately they can't sing well.  : (   But they are good actors.

ik7afC7Haa	Well some times, you can sing not as well because if you are singing from your throat it is straining the notes. If you sing from your stomach and sit up and have a good posture then it is most likely you will be singing better due to the air in your lungs and you are not straining to get the notes out.<br>  <br>  I do hope the answer helps in some way. :)|`|RVqw1C8baa	ok well first you need to support your diaphragm by expanding your stomach because that helps you project the sound more so it doesnt get strained from your throat.<br>  im confused, do you want to sound more whiny or no?<br>  if so:<br>  to sound more whiny you have to sing your emotions into the song and you have to make it feel like you wrote the song and you're singing your emotions.<br>  if you dont want to sound whiny:<br>  it's simple just dont use a whiny voice when you sing
ZUL3drNgaa	Harry Potter. It just . . . is more original. Vampire romance . . . so old. It's been done, and better, too.|`|S5CFL3F1aa	Harry potter!!!!  Harry potter is so much more original...if you see where im coming from. Theres lots more to harry potter than twilight.<br>  thats just my opinion though.|`|0OtHu9Zmaa	I read both and I choose Harry Potter. The writing is better, there are less unanswered questions and loopy characters....And at least everything that JKR came up with, she gave you an explanation how it was possible. Instead of SM just telling you that vampires can have kids with human women - right!!<br>  <br>  And oh, I did not like Bella's character - too dependable on Edward, on Jacob, on everybody and a bit not self sufficient. I mean while she was human she just waited for things to happen to her, a bit too passive for my taste. <br>  <br>  But this is one person's opinion. Can't wait for all of the Twilight fans to come and bite my head off.|`|QxcRUl9haa	I don't think they're even really comparable. Two completely different types of stories. JK Rowling's writing is much better, and her stories are more complicated and thought out. I guess I'd have to give the prize to Harry Potter for being better overall, but as far as my preference, I love them both.|`|MfPkdrAzaa	Without a doubt, harry potter. Better written, better read, better entertainment, basically BETTER. I god damn hate twilight anyway|`|qzkWahFeaa	Twilight. Harry Potter just isn't good, I've never liked them. I only got through the first two, then fell asleep repeatedly when I started the third.|`|dxpAcsG5aa	Harry Potter. My friend will so kill me for saying it though.<br>  Harry Potter is better I think. It's soooo much more original.<br>  Twilight... some of the stuff Edward does is just creepy. And really, it's basically like Bella's first love. You're really not supposed to marry your first love. (sorry to give that away - but it's predictable) Twilight to me would be much better if it focused on Alice & Jasper's relationship or Carlilse (sp?) & Esme's relationship than Edward & Bella's.<br>  So yeah, Harry Potter.<br>  Just what I think though.|`|QroCDTR6aa	TWILIGHT!!<br>  <br>  I love Stephanie Meyer i think she is an excellent writer i read the whole Twilght Saga in one week and i hardly ever read. Her other book The Host is great too<br>  <br>  Oh just thought i'd add i read Twilight before i saw the film.<br>  <br>  :)|`|Hl3c08mWaa	i like twiligh tbu t harry potter is good to . hp is action an dadventure and magic. twiligh tis amazing- suspense full, romantic and captivating. read both. i no u don't want to know about the movies but they are good|`|JZWzG04Gaa	Harry Potter!!!!! without a doubt, its more enteraining the characters r cooler, magic beats love anytime, and its waaaay more entertaining to read|`|KJ2W9SH0aa	harry potter rocks!!!!!!!|`|1iOsKZvIaa	Harry Potter, I'm going to read Twilight soon, so I'll get back to you.|`|SMv0Xj20aa	harry potter sux...... i loved twilight =)|`|NnkcTBpjaa	none, ihate reading xP|`|zLilrd1Haa	harry potter is more original.  so....HARRY POTTER

cLgwmcfwaa	if you're suductive, you can blame that sexy scorpio moon. i've got it too BABAY!!<br>  <br>  Virgo/Scorpio <br>  The combination of your Sun sign and your Moon sign produces one that looks and acts like an intellectual, but with an emotional nature that is truly the driving force. This is perhaps the most emotional of the quiet Virgo breed. The quick mind and common sense that is so notable in all with Virgo Sun, is charged with an intense rashness and impulsiveness common to Scorpio. Your ability to reason and rationalize is well developed, but you often seem almost incapable of believing what is foreign to your internal emotional bias. Thus, you become very partisan in whatever causes or ideas light you fire. These you may rationalize and try to give intellectual status, but you usually color judgments with intuition rather than logic. You are facile at thinking up reasons why your ideas are right and always persuasive at putting them across. At times you appear near genius, and at other times, way off base. You are often to be found among the theoretical and radical thinkers, able to prove nearly anything on paper with diagrams to show how it should work. Whether it really will or not in real life may be another thing. Your intellectual powers are strong, but you're often less than realistic. You have a certain zeal that makes it hard for you to remain still and listen to what others have to say, and you can be dominating in your approach to group endeavors. Underneath, you have a somewhat brooding personality that is forever probing, turning over stones and delving for ideas with which you can either feel affinity or enmity. In business you are likely to be successful and valuable to your employer because you do possess powerful leadership qualities. In this environment you seem to become more objective and less emotional. Nonetheless, learning to restrain the natural tendencies of this configuration will make life and relationships much easier. <br>  --------------------------------<br>  Earth/Water (Sun in earth + Ascendant in water, or Sun in water + Ascendant in earth)<br>  Earth/water individuals are sensitive and receptive to other people, and usually creative in a relaxed but productive way. Their greatest issues are those of lethargy and lack of enthusiasm - sometimes these people really need to struggle to get themselves going. Since they are introspective and composed they usually have great potential for self-knowledge, but it is difficult for them to communicate some of their feelings and desires. Pessimism may be a problem, as may the tendency to find unnecessary problems where there isn't any just for the sake of safeguarding and being prepared. At best, they can establish dreams and visions in a concrete way. Their patience and insight let them reach deep into issues.|`|bvwYVGJOaa	I'm a Virgo too with Sag rising, Aqua moon and VENUS in Scorpio and MARS in Capricorn.<br>  <br>  As a whole person i am analytical, free spirited and open minded but all cos of my Venus and Mars moon i am also sexual person. go figure.<br>  <br>  Plus i do attract lots of men because of my personality and when men look at me, i think "why?" still haven't found the answer!!|`|g0evAXSGaa	moon in scorpio- that's why you're so... seductive. scorpio is a sexual sign. your rising sign is what other people first percieve you as- a fun happy person [for gemini] and your moon sign is kinda the real you.

Also there are two movies that go with it: "Death and Rebirth" and "The End of Evangelion". I would recommend skipping Death and Rebirth though; it's just a recap of the series and the 1st half of End. Fair warning though: the End movie is violent, has some nudity & "bad language", and I think it gets controversial. <br>  <br>  Also, there's Serial Experiments:lain.  It has a lot of NGE's themes, but doesn't copy it (unlike RahXephon). <br>  <br>  Read more about these shows at these links (warning: there are spoilers): <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion_(TV_series)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesi...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Evangelion" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Expe...</a>|`|3ZpMQjtpaa	Death Note, Death Note, Death Note...<br>  <br>  Naruto, if you wanna try getting in to that.<br>  <br>  I remember Kikaider being pretty sad.<br>  <br>  Neon Genesis Evangelion is good.<br>  <br>  Loveless is good, albeit it is shounen-ai.<br>  <br>  Ghost In The Shell is though-provoking.<br>  <br>  Appleseed is good, but it's a movie.<br>  <br>  Ummm...

Watch 5 Centimeters Per Second, it's meaningful, sends out a harsh realistic message, and it's sad, very sad. <br>  <br>  And if you want something meaningful, depressing and deep, served alongside with explosive amounts of angst, you may want to check out Neon Genesis Evangelion.<br>  <br>  Kino's Journey is extremely philosophical and a beautiful series.

kL41a5Bnaa	Shoutcast has the documentation and program for you to set up your own server. However, you'll probably only be able to have a couple listeners at a time, it depends on your internet upload. <br>  <br>  Also, in the US (and several other countries) you have to licensed with ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, and soundexchange to broadcast music online. <br>  <br>  You can chose to go to each one and do this or sign up with a site like live365 or loudcity.net. I'm more familar with loudcity as I used to broadcast with them and still visit the forums.

ug2PnhAIaa	I'm not sure if they have announced any tours yet. If they did, it would have been up on their official site. They probably won't go on tour again until they've finish preparing their new album and then release it at the end of the year. They'll probably go on a Europe tour first and then a US tour. I also live close to NYC and am dying to see them live. Keep an eye on their official website for any tour announcements. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.muse.mu/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.muse.mu/index.php</a>

F0UF9DDeaa	Is this a question? To pick a horror movie from your list or are you just wanting to make a statement of your own favorite horror movie?However I love your selections.. Those all are very awesome movies. I guess if you make a statement it is okay for one to answer you with a question right! <br>  Okay, from your list... Alfered Hitchcock - Psycho <br>  <br>  My personal all time horror movie that actually got to me ( Most horror movies just amuse me) Is.... In The Mouth of Madness ... This was an awesome movie. If you have never seen it and enjoy the occasional horror flick it is a must see. 2> Fear... Not the one with Mrs. Silverstone, But the one where the guy has a dummy and they go to a cabin it may be THE FEAR, anyway it was excellent. Old horror would be.. The Hand, Thing, Storm of the Century  and of course Poltergeist.|`|BKybwvF5aa	Jurassic Park<br>  The Mummy<br>  Signs<br>  The Chronicles of Riddick<br>  Spider-man Movies<br>  Pitch Black<br>  Aliens|`|jcL7gDMKaa	haha yeah sci fi and horror are my 2 favourite film genres!

qzkWahFeaa	I agree with everything. I got sick of the eyebrow thing very quickly, and what you said about the characters was how I felt. I thought they followed the story well though, and kept true to how the characters were supposed to feel. I think that they kind of overdid the clothes though, and could have done more with the makeup. For example, when TPC enters the school for the first time in the movie, and are waking through the halls in semi-slow mo, they each have on about 4 visible layers. Not that it looked bad, just a bit over-the-top. Layne was not like I pictured her (and where were Meena and Heather??), and ChrisAbeley would have been cute if not for his greased-up hair. =P|`|8vxFr3Khaa	it wasn't what i expected, and an extremely short movie<br>  when it's over you're just like ... ???<br>  because it sort of just ends out of nowhere<br>  i thought they were all cute though, true about dylan being a lot smaller<br>  it wasn't bad though<br>  i feel like a little girl for watching it haha<br>  but it was good enough<br>  movies and the book that goes with it are never exactly the same|`|f3xNSnGkaa	i so agree with the clothes and hair. you seem to got it down quite well. congrats :)|`|K6KIfZb7aa	I feel the same way!!! with dylan alicia massie was horrible i read all the books i hated the movie claire did not look like wat i thought she would look like she was like 2 nerdish cus when u think about it she was goin out with cam amd cam and her r idk??? u kno.ohh yah and layne kinda reminded me of a really like always happy peppy girl but in the movie he was like emo!! :P

I hope that no one took it, but if you do keep calling it and it's turned on instead of being turned off, call up your phone company and see if there is call activity on the phone and just report it lost or stolen.

The scene in the movie when the song was sung was at a funeral. The story was about a black woman who had a daughter who was half white and also looked white. She raised her daughter in the home where she worked as a maid to a white family who also had a child who was raised with her daughter. When her child started  school she realized that she was not like considered a white person but a black person. she was ashamed of this fact and despised her mother. As she went through life living as a white person she disowned her mother and kept her out of her life, but when her mother died all the emotions and love that she never showed her mother when she was alive came out at her mother's funeral with the song Amazing Grace playing.Anyone that I know who have seen this movie were brought to tears man woman and child.|`|5fQH1V44aa	Concrete angel~Martina McBride<br>  OMG this song is really sad...but the music video is SO SAD! i couldnt stop crying!|`|IUrPYyoCaa	Unchained Melody by the Righteous Brothers|`|TdLuyP7Zaa	Who Knew by P!nk|`|zNtdObyHaa	everybody hurts- REM

Hope this helped you.|`|ZJoLtLrFaa	Seems like the last chapter I read of  the manga explains all and yet there could be more added onto the manga...but then it would be dragging it out. I think the anime got way ahead of the manga...I'm thinking ...and I'm like 98% sure there will be no more seasons :*(<br>  If there is...I hope it will be good :)|`|0pUkVcGIaa	The Manga and the Anime are different at some parts. The end of Vampire Knight Guilty is different from the mangas but the mangas hint that there's more to the story and at the bottom of the last chapter it says the next release date is feb 24th.|`|iAVx3IZ7aa	There's no confirmed news for a Season 3.

cr5TQgmUaa	No. He's more of a mentalist -- one who creates the impression in the minds of the audience that the he possesses special powers to read thoughts, predict events, control other minds, and other similar feats.<br>  <br>  Shawn Spencer (James Roday) hails from a family of cops, and was fully expected to carry the torch by his father, Henry, who meticulously schooled his son from a very young age in the finer points of detective work. But while Henry made him a detective, he can't make Shawn be a detective.<br>  <br>  It soon becomes clear that Shawn's extraordinary powers of observation and deduction are still no match for his overdeveloped sense of fun, as he takes a string of random jobs strictly for enjoyment and entertains himself calling in tips to the police hotline for crimes he sees on television.<br>  <br>  And then one night, one of Shawn's tips lead police somewhere he never imagined -- back to him. It seems detectives believe information this accurate could only have come from the inside, and Shawn is the suspect.<br>  <br>  Desperate to avoid jail time, Shawn hastily explains that his insight is really second sight - he's a psychic. And though skeptical, the department is impressed and Shawn is hired on as a "psychic consultant".<br>  <br>  Immediately enlisting the assistance of his reluctant best friend, Gus, Shawn opens his own agency, PSYCH, taking his talent for detective work -- and fun -- in a new direction.|`|q8YJYqtcaa	No he has just been taught to observe every little detail, he fools people that he is pshycic(pardon my spellin)          <br>  "Gus, don't be this crevise in my arm!"|`|4oI9FyJRaa	thats a dumb question.<br>  btw he's mexican!<br>  no wonder he can do the impressions so well<br>  imdb.com<br>  check!|`|oYmZUO8Caa	No, he just observes people and notices their little habits.|`|2Ys6pUg9aa	No, he just has a photographic memory and then he solves the problem.|`|AeVnK1igaa	Shawn Spencer is hyper-observant and has a photographic memory. He pretends to be a psychic for the Santa Barbara Police Department because when he called in a tip to the police department, he was suspected of being an accomplice to the crime. Shawn's father, Henry, used to be a cop and was very strict with Shawn, testing him about the restaurant around him if he wanted desert.<br>  <br>  :3 I love Psych.
