I'm only in recreational soccer but another team recruited me for WAGS division 5. My parents didn't want me to go because it was a travel team. Any way, I'm an okay player I have good ball control and some moves. My juggling isn't bad but it's not like I can do 40 of them(i would love to).Last year I made the soccer team and I was 2nd string. this year I want to be 1st and I think I have a great chance.But there are sssooo many people trying out! I know for sure there are going to be 10 definite spots for these 10 girls who are on WAGS and play 24/7. the other...oh idk...30 girls are ok. About 20 aren't good at all and 5-10 are almost as good as me. I'm scared that they might beat me out thoug.What should I do to improve and beat them out? what skills can I improve on? I usually play full back and sweeper because I'm fast and can get back easily and sprint out th eother players. So what should I work on. Not just for full back but for soccer in general. Tryouts are in two day so...yeah. Thanks!!

20090309181832AAAK1iO	Sports;Wrestling	Does anyone else feel like the WWE Main event scene is full of Mid-Carders?	Seriously.  John Cena vs. Big Show vs. Edge?  The hell is that, Summerslam 04' IC Title match?  Orton vs. HHH, for what, the 50th time?  MITB is full of Mid-Carders too.  And if you look at the Mid-Card scene. it's full of house show jobbers.  Wrestling writers need to understand that a wrestlers popularity and freshness comes from his ability to go back and forth between Main Event and Mid-Card.  Look at Taker, he doesn't need to Main Event every single freaking Wrestlemania to stay fresh, and nor does HBK (although I bet he'd like to).  Same goes for Jericho.  Look at those chumps HHH and Cena.  If they aren't in the Main Event, they are worthless.

We did about 7 laps (200m I think .. each lap is half a mile) with a BUNCH of other running workouts. It was so intense and while we were running laps we didn't get a single break and at times I truly thought I couldn't move any further at times. I am overweight so will my body truly adjust? How long do you think it will take? PS: We do about 70 minutes of workout a day. Half my time quit because it is so difficult. I won't give up though, but answer my Q's please thank you

20070519192919AAH2zl8	Sports;Baseball	Are Tigers fans STUPID?	If Tigers fans are indeed not STUPID, then they're cheaters! The cardinals just lost to the Tigers after a nail biting game in Detriot. Aaron Miles represented the tieing run on first base with Scott Spezio at the plate. Jones, the Tigers star closer, had Scott at a 2-2 count when Mr. Spezio ripped one down the line fair. Now Aaron Miles is no Ricky Henderson, but has a bit of speed keep that in mind as he takes off from first and would have high hopes of going first to home on the Spezio double. Instead, the whole cluster of Tigers fan blatenly reach over and one grabs the ball. Make no mistake about it, the fans had every intention of taking the live ball out of play. So, either the fans didn't know the rule, or they're cheaters! Further more they should have been kicked out of the game. I am going to follow up and make sure they had to leave. Such a bad way to end a great game. Tigers fans should be ashamed. I thought Doug Jones was going to through another ball. Freaking cheaters.

The Steelers returned 19 of their 22 starters from the 2005 Super Bowl team for the 2006 season and will more than likely miss the playoffs.

Do you agree?	1b Derrick Lee   2b Mike Fontenot   ss Ryan Theriot   3b Aramis Ramirez   Lf Alfonso Soriano   Cf Kosuke Fukudome   Rf Bobby Abreu      starting Rotation   Carlos Zambrano   Rich Harden   Ryan Dempster   C.C. Sabathia   Sean Marshall      Bullpen   Neal Cotts   Will Ohman    Carlos Marmol   Kevin Harrt   Kerry Wood   Closer Jeff Smardzja      Bench    Ronny Cedeno   Daryle Ward    Henry Blanco   Wilson Betemit   Felix Pie      If the CUbs sign Bobby Abreu he would add much need left handed power.   They could bring back Will Ohman to be a situaltional left hander in the bullpen to complement Neal Cotts.  I thought Ohman did a good job with Atlanta.   Wilson Betemit would add a veteran to the bench and much needed versatility as he could play anywhere and is a switch hitter which is key in a double switch.     Felix Pie could be a pinch runner / defensive replacement late in the game for Abreu but don't count on his hitting.     Sign C.C. Sabathia and dump Lillie as he gives up too many home runs.   Move Marshall into the rotation and dump Jason Marquis.      Batting Order:      1 Fukudome   2 Theriot   3 Lee   4 Abreu   5 Ramirez   6 Soriano   7 Fontenot   8 pitcher's spot   9 Soto      The left handers are evenly divided and it would be difficult to mix and match lefties out of the bullpen.  Soto hitting 9th but he could realistically hire.  Maybe against lefties he could hit in Abreu's spot.   Theriot was a great 2 hitter this year so leave him there.  Fukudome can leadoff because his speed and patience at the plate.   Fontenot 7th to leadoff the 3rd assuming the Cubs go in order in the first 2.  Can get on to setup a bunt by the pitcher and Soto to drive him in.

20070716090809AAQnS2n	Sports;Fantasy Sports	Do you think my Deroit Tigers can win the Wild Card?	Opinions. Im in a MLB2K7 league where the schedule is more similar to the NFL so every game matters. Right now Im 5-7 and 1 back of Boston for the WC. We started th year 0-7 but have won 5 staight and the scheduling should bring the WC down to us and them. The pitching has been outrageous lately and Boston has been getting carried by Ramirez. Everyone is hitting for us which is why I think we are better. The other teams in the WC I expect to take their division so Im focused on BOS. Heres my schedule, all these teams are above or at .500 so it will be tough but weve been lights out lately. And  Boston only plays below .500 teams. Their 3 opponents are 1-13 combined.      2 vs KC (won game 1)   1 vs Oakland    3 vs Angels      REDSOX Schedule   1 vs Orioles    3 vs Devil Rays    3 vs Minnesota
