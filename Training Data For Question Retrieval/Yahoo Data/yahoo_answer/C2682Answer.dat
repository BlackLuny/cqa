F2za35wLaa	I'm guessing its a tank of cichlids??<br>  <br>  <br>  You can try to add a schooling fish, in some cases it makes aggressive fish more passive.<br>  <br>  There is no way to prevent aggressiveness 100% in a aggressive fish, so the best you can do is to add live plant (which you should do because of your algae problem anyways) so the other fish have more things to hide in.<br>  <br>  <br>  I couldn't give you a good example as to what type of schooling fish you should get as I don't know your tank size, and the types of fish in it.. <br>  <br>  If you ever choose a best answer, please post the url to another question you make, which should ask "Is there a compatible schooling fish for my aquarium" (Listing the other fish you currently have)<br>  <br>  For one example, if its a single tiger oscar that is causing the chaos, then it is beneficial to add a second oscar around the identical size (once again depending on your tank size)
GDGoQlZ9aa	Here's the reason, fishes with small eyeballs are usually the ones that are out during the daylight hours and at night they are sleeping while the fishes that has big eyes are usually the fishes that come out during the night to feed.<br>  <br>  A primary example is the squirrelfish. They come out during the night to feed and during the day, they are hiding in caves.<br>  <br>  You will notice that in fishes out during the day and fishes that are feeding out during the night.<br>  <br>  Thanks for asking................|`|AA10585364	most fish species are food for others, so they need a really large eyesite range. their eyes allows them to see almost behind them. same applies to predators when they are hunting for other fish for food in general.|`|PIrVZw8raa	SYMPTOMS:One or both eyes appear to be, protruding abnormally, "popping" or sticking out.<br>  <br>  TREATMENT:This is usually the result of a bacterial infection. Try to give your fish the best water possible by performing frequent water changes. To treat this problem you can use a treatment such as Tetracycline from Mardel Labs. If possible, increase the quality of food given. Supplement with vitamin enriched foods. More information on FISH POP EYE|`|qqw78uw4aa	I guess to see better underwater... I mean human eyes aren't big enough for us to see clearly underwater... and plus to see a wider range.|`|6aB9w8hTaa	Probably so they can see in nearly all directions so they don't get eaten.|`|Ew2rhaZWaa	fish have big eyeballs because they are not able to sleep... they cannot sleep in the ocean.
AA10585364	it's not possible breeding with dividers, they need physicaly contact in order to spawn and fertilize the eggs. if the male roughs up the female or eats the eggs, then it's not a likely candidate for breeding.|`|U3MoXe2uaa	He might eat the eggs because he cannot fertilize them, because he is starile? A lot of male FH's are.
LmZLo52vaa	Maybe you have a big critter in there and they are trying to get out! I don't know. How is the oxygen level? What about temperature? Try calling your local extension agent if you have one. If not, maybe an agricultural school or something of that type. Check the library or web sites on pond maintenance. Sorry I'm no help but these are the only things I can think of.|`|AA10585364	maybe an algae bloom is starving the lake of some oxygen? or maybe some wild animal is taking them out of the lake and putting it there to mess with you.|`|U1kQMAUcaa	it could be that they are jumping at bugs and landing out on the grass. There might not be enuff food source in the pond for them and they are trying to catch bugs. Also another thing is that since you found them all in one place that someone took them out and placed them in the grass. Unless you actully saw them jump then i say its the bugs. If you didn't see them jump I say someone is messing with you.

Rsrsrs também!<br>  <br>  Excelente; meus Parabéns pela escolha, e veja só estas daqui:<br>  <br>  <br>  NUM PAIS SOCIALISTA<br>  <br>  ========================<br>  <br>  Num determinado pais, regido pelo regime socialista, havia um grande<br>  <br>  incentivo à natalidade. Necessitando de m?o-de-obra, criaram uma lei que<br>  <br>  obrigava os casais a terem um determinado numero de filhos. Previram também<br>  <br>  uma tolerancia de cinco anos. Essa tolerancia consistia do fato de que, para<br>  <br>  os casais que completassem 5 anos de casamento sem terem filhos, ao menos UM,<br>  <br>  o governo destacaria um agente que iria auxilia-los. Num dia desses, aconteceu<br>  <br>  o seguinte dialogo entre um marido e sua mulher:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mulher: Querido, hoje completamos o quinto aniversário de casamento!<br>  <br>  Marido: E, infelizmente n?o tivemos um herdeiro.<br>  <br>  Mulher: Será que "eles" v?o enviar o tal "agente"?<br>  <br>  Marido: Eu n?o sei...<br>  <br>  Mulher: E se ele vier?<br>  <br>  Marido: Bem, eu n?o tenho nada a fazer...<br>  <br>  Mulher: Eu, menos ainda...<br>  <br>  Marido: Vou sair, pois já estou atrasado para o trabalho.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Logo após a saída do marido, batem à porta. A mulher abre a porta e encontra<br>  <br>  um homem à sua frente. Era um FOTOGRAFO que se enganara de endere?o.<br>  <br>  Homem : Bom dia, eu sou...<br>  <br>  Mulher: Ah, já sei... pode entrar...<br>  <br>  Homem : Seu marido está em casa?<br>  <br>  Mulher: N?o, ele foi trabalhar.<br>  <br>  Homem : Presumo que ele esteja a par...<br>  <br>  Mulher: Sim, ele está a par e também concorda.<br>  <br>  Homem : Otimo, ent?o vamos come?ar?<br>  <br>  Mulher: Mas já? Assim t?o rápido?<br>  <br>  Homem : Preciso ser breve pois ainda tenho cinco casais para visitar.<br>  <br>  Mulher: Puxa! O senhor agüenta?<br>  <br>  Homem : Sim, agüento porque gosto do meu trabalho. Ele me da muito prazer.<br>  <br>  Mulher: Ent?o, como vamos fazer?<br>  <br>  Homem : Permita-me sugerir: uma no quarto, duas no tapete, duas no sofá, uma<br>  <br>  no corredor, duas na cozinha e a ultima no banheiro.<br>  <br>  Mulher: Nossa!!! N?o é muito?<br>  <br>  Homem : Minha senhora, nem o melhor artista da nossa profiss?o consegue na<br>  <br>  primeira tentativa. Numa dessas, a gente acerta bem na mosca!<br>  <br>  Mulher: O senhor já visitou alguma casa neste bairro?<br>  <br>  Homem : N?o, mas tenho comigo algumas amostras dos meus últimos trabalhos.<br>  <br>  Veja. N?o s?o lindas? (Mostrando fotos de crian?as.)<br>  <br>  Mulher: Como s?o belos esses bebês! O senhor mesmo quem fez?<br>  <br>  Homem : Sim. Veja esse aqui. (Mostrando outra foto.) Foi conseguido na porta<br>  <br>  de um super-mercado.<br>  <br>  Mulher: Nossa!!! N?o lhe parece um tanto público?<br>  <br>  Homem : Sim, mas a m?e era artista de cinema e queria publicidade.<br>  <br>  Mulher: Eu n?o teria coragem de fazer isso...<br>  <br>  Homem : Este aqui foi em cima de um ?nibus.<br>  <br>  Mulher: Que horror!!!<br>  <br>  Homem : E. Foi um servi?o dos mais duros que eu já fiz.<br>  <br>  Mulher: Eu imagino...<br>  <br>  Homem : Veja. Este foi feito num parque de diversoes em pleno inverno.<br>  <br>  Mulher: Credo! Como o senhor conseguiu?<br>  <br>  Homem : N?o foi fácil. Como se n?o bastasse a neve caindo, havia uma multid?o<br>  <br>  em cima de nós. Eu nunca teria conseguido acabar...<br>  <br>  Mulher: Ainda bem que sou discreta e n?o quero que ninguém nos veja.<br>  <br>  Homem : Otimo. Eu também prefiro assim. Agora, se a senhora me der licen?a, eu<br>  <br>  vou armar o TRIPé.<br>  <br>  Mulher: Tripé? Para que?<br>  <br>  Homem : Bem, madame. E necessário.

No decorrer de um de seus passeios, os membros da<br>  <br>  referida família perceberam uma pequena casa de campo, que lhes<br>  <br>  pareceu boa para passarem as ferias de verao. Falaram com o<br>  <br>  proprietário, que era um pastor protestante, e combinaram ficar<br>  <br>  com ela para o verao. Regressando à Inglaterra, discutiram<br>  <br>  muito sobre os problemas da casa. De repente, a senhora<br>  <br>  lembrou-se de n?o ter visto o W.C..<br>  <br>  Confirmando o sentido pratico dos britanicos,<br>  <br>  escreveram ao pastor protestante para obter tal informa?ao. A<br>  <br>  carta foi assim redigida:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Gentil Pastor. Sou membro da família que há pouco vi-<br>  <br>  sitou-o com o fim de alugar a sua propriedade no próximo verao,<br>  <br>  mas esquecemos de um detalhe e agradeceríamos se nos informasse<br>  <br>  onde se encontra o W. C.."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  O Pastor alem?o, n?o compreendendo bem o sentido exato<br>  <br>  da abreviatura W.

b2cc3d0e96e4bf7a1a66e6b43bf8ba6caa	Les pétitions ne servent à rien. C'est un piège à con. Désolé d'être brusque mais c'est ainsi.<br>  <br>  Une pétition qui ne pla?t pas sera jetée à la poubelle en moins de dix secondes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ce qui est vraiment efficace est de poser problème à ceux qui vont recevoir les signatures :<br>  <br>  1° choisissez vos cibles : Importateurs, revendeurs, politiciens, journalistes, mais aussi agences de tourismes proposant des voyages dans ces contrées et médias lus par les clients potentiels de celles-ci, magasins vendant des produits venus de ces contrées, commerces tenus par des gens originaires de ces contrées (ils s'indigneront d'être ciblés, mais ?a se saura dans leur pays d'origine d'autant plus facilement), etc.<br>  <br>  2° Diffuser une liste de ces cibles, avec leurs adresses<br>  <br>  3° Chacun d'entre vous choisit une ou plusieurs cibles.<br>  <br>  4° Chacun écrit une lettre (pas besoin de dépasser une page) indiquant que vous désaprouver ces méthodes et que vous aller boycotter et faire boycotter ces salopards et ceux qui commercent avec eux.<br>  <br>  5° Mettez ce courrier dans une enveloppe, adressez, timbrez, envoyez. Aucun signe distinctif sur l'enveloppe : La personne qui l'ouvrira ne doit pas pouvoir en deviner le contenu avant de l'avoir ouverte et lue.<br>  <br>  6° C'est pourquoi aussi il vaut mieux éviter les lettres toutes faites à l'en-tête de telle ou telle association : Elles sont plus facilement repérées dès l'ouverture.<br>  <br>  7° Choisissez une cible craignant pour sa notoriété ou celle de ce qu'il représente (en règle générale, un politicien).<br>  <br>  8° Envoyez-lui une carte postale disant en deux mots ce que vous reprochez, et ce que vous allez faire si rien ne change (boycott, par exemple).<br>  Une carte postale a l'inconvénient d'être repérée rapidement, mais celui de pouvoir être lue par toutes les personnes l'ayant entre les mains : Fonctionnaires des postes, peut-être douane, voisins, concierge, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  L'intéret des lettres est celui de l'ennui : Une pétition de cinq cent noms reste une simple et vulgaire rame de papier sur laquelle vont, excuser du mot, pisser vos destinataires.<br>  Nous sommes au XXIe siècle, ils sont blindés : Elle n'aura probablement pas le moindre effet.<br>  Une secrétaire la mettra à la corbeille en quelques secondes. Une secrétaire un peu expérimentée ne la laissera sans doute même pas atteindre son supérieur.<br>  <br>  Par contre, imaginez l'impact de 500 lettres...<br>  500 lettres qu'il vaut recevoir, qu'il faut toutes ouvrir...<br>  Même la meilleure des secrétaire DOIT toutes les ouvrir afin d'au moins savoir de quoi il s'agit.<br>  Tous ces gens sont très occupés. Un grand nombre de lettres vont considérablement les ennuyer, et même leur co?ter de l'argent (le temps de les ouvrir, d'en prendre connaissance, et au besoin de les jeter n'est pas mince, et et forcément multiplié par le nombre de lettres. Comme le savent toutes les bonnes secrétaires, le temps de prendre connaissance d'un courrier co?te réellement de l'argent).<br>  <br>  Si les lettres arrivent souvent, s'ils ont connaissance que d'autres en re?oivent, ils vont y prêter attention.<br>  <br>  C'est beaucoup plus efficace : 50 lettres d'une signature auront plus d'impact qu'une seule lettre de 500 signatures, parce qu'elles auront plus d'impact *physique*.|`|07160e1ee2e04847a214c2a064ba7b1faa	Je n'arrive pas a coller, mais tu peux me rajouter : Jean Secret.|`|7e938f25e8d5e5eced22fc3dad643a0baa	j'ai déjà signé sur un autre mail pour ?à ou il y avait déjà plus de 300 signatures|`|ea95165cb0fe58c5f6bd849c2216c749aa	je ne vois pas comment 500 ou 1 000 ou encore 100 000 signatures pourraient changer quoique ce soit dans ce domaine, car cela traduit une réaction démocratique ("il y a plein de gens qui disent que c'est pas bien de faire ?a, donc on va arrêter") ; or les pays concernés ne sont pas démocratiques la plupart du temps, ou en tout cas, pas au sens auquel on l'entend "chez nous".<br>  <br>  c'est un peu comme l'ONU qui dit à la Corée du Nord : "Dis donc, c'est pas bien d'avoir des armes nucléaires !

CyWFEUjTaa	This is good advice, but I have just a few things to add:<br>  <br>  1) Letting new tap water sit out for 24 hours only removes the chlorine and chloramine from water but not other heavy metals. It is better to use a water conditioner. This will take care of all of those things. Most conditioners will also help build the fish's slime coat, which helps prevent disease. I personally use API Stress Coat, but there are other brands as well.<br>  <br>  2) Male bettas cannot be together, but FEMALES can get along. It is best to keep them in groups of 3 or more, in odd numbers so they can establish a pecking order. All bettas can be kept with the fish you mentioned (although males should not be kept with guppies as they usually mistake the guppy for another betta because of the guppy's tail. Female bettas can usually get along with guppies)  as well as danios. minnows, mollies, platies, rainbowfish, rasboras, swordtails, plecostamus, tetras, and african dwarf frogs. Unless your betta is in at least a 5 gallon tank, you should not add any other fish because the tank will be too small.<br>  <br>  3) It is always better to have a filter and do 25 % water changes once a week than to change part of the water every 3 days. Changing the water that frequently will stress your fish more than is necessary. The tank size should be at least 1 gallon, preferably larger.<br>  <br>  4) Instead of using live foods, you can also feed them frozen or freeze-dried foods. Bettas should be fed once a day or every other day, as much as they can eat in 30 seconds to 1 minute (depending on how fast the fish eats). This prevents over feeding which is a common cause of death in bettas.<br>  <br>  5) Bettas are tropical fish and the water temperature should stay between 75 and 80 Farenheit.<br>  <br>  I have 5 bettas (4 males, 1 female). The males all have their own 2 gallon tanks and the female is in a 5 gallon with 2 african dwarf frogs. The water stays at 78 Farenheit.  I feed them Hikari Bio Gold Betta Pellets and HBH Betta Flakes as the main diet (switching at every other feeding), and Freeze-Dried Blood worms and Freeze-Dried Brine Shrimp once a week each. I also feed them Tetra Algae Crisps (believe it or not mine actually like these!) once a week. They are fed once every day as much as they eat in 30 seconds. I do partial water changes once a week with API Stress Coat water conditioner.|`|2eMBozIKaa	i did ; died like in 2 weeks, oh well lol .|`|gYegDDuBaa	i got a crowntail betta fish thats blue and red. i feed him bugs and pellets and his name is Mr. Berry (my sister named him). and one thing to correct you about is that bettas cant live with guppys because the guppys look like a male betta so the betta will attack the guppy. other than that this is very good.|`|AA10585364	i used to have betta fish, they are great to have and using your tips, they should live a long and happy life. |`|ZuRjSHq2aa	bettas can survive in water with ph higher than 7.0 unless you have a RO system just use tap itll have the dissolved solids that fish need. Water aged 24hrs is not enough nowadays chloramine has now become the standard and will stay in water for up to a week. Other than that you seem to treat fish better than most and HOW ARE YOU OVER 30!!!<br>  <br>  My new fish setup has made me broke............gorgeous though|`|wbRjrV4baa	I'd love to be able to say great tips! :-)<br>  <br>  Unfortunately I can't because you start things off by saying 'bowl' yes they can survive in one but thats all they do survive, they don't thrive its not natural its unhealthy -it's cruel!<br>  A filtration system is a great benefit to any fish would you like to be trapped in a cupboard with your own faeces and urine building up around you by the hour?<br>  If a betta is kept in a bowl it can't be kept with anything else, a bowl isn't big enough for a betta alone so how can it be shared with more fish?<br>  If you have a filter you wont need a turkey baster to remove debris and there should never be any particles of uneaten food its a sure sign of overfeeding<br>  Yes the pH should be stable but it doesn't have to be rigidly fixed at 7. Telling people to use chemicals to adjust it is a sure fire way of helping people poison their fish with a horrible chemical soup<br>  Telling people to keep things covered is never a good idea because some idiots will use things to create an airtight seal<br>  <br>  Apart from that it's an acceptable entry.|`|5279ee0835c87e0bde29f0b67889f521aa	Your Awesome thanks for the tip|`|0dpwdsSiaa	I recently got a Betta and its doing fine with normal tap water.|`|GxuhBswoaa	I have had a betta fish for a year now and he is doing great!<br>  EVERYBODY LISTEN TO THIS THIS IS GOOD INFO!|`|fYmQqdyQaa	pretty good advice, but i wouldnt reocmend a bowl/jar. they need space. im talking 5G+. i have 2 bettas ATM, one in a heated filtered 10g tank, the other in a heated filtered 5g tank. i perform routine water changes on both and feed them a good quality pellet food, along with bloodworms, brine shrimp and tubifex worms :)

As long as you  raise the pit bull in a kind and gentle manner should be a wonderful dog. its the people who make the dog bad not the dog itself. this goes for any breed and any type of animal.

BUT ya got to read the headlines-they DO turn-Why?-no one knows,perhaps breeding,perhaps training,perhaps it's just the unpredictable nature of the pit.To the other end-chows(as a little dog) also is very well known to turn on even their owners who have had them for years.

R8BFzkzPaa	it could be a number of things. first test the ph of the water. if it is too high for them it can cause this. it is possible they have fought. is it a big patch of scales, or just a few scales here and there? if it's just a few then i would say it is most likely they are juist growing. when goldfish grow they sometimes lose a few scales, but they should grow back eventually.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|AA10585364	quite possibly they might have had a fight? netting should not be able to remove the scale of a fish. depending on what kind of goldfish it is, it may be best to keep it indoors. Koi's are better adapted to colder winter weather and months of "hibernating". if the goldfish and koi look fine, then just keep taking care of them normally. 
CyWFEUjTaa	Definately an Albino Corydora Catfish (also refered to as an Albino Cory). The "mustache" is actually called barbels, they are like whiskers. They are bottom feeders and will eat the fish food that falls to the bottom of the tank. You can also feed them sinking wafers and shrimp pellets to make sure they are getting enough food. <br>  <br>  They do best in schools of at least 3 of their own species. Be careful if you ever have to medicate your tank as they are sensitve fish and cannot deal with medications that contain Copper Sulfate or Malachite Green. They are peaceful tropical fish and get along with other tropical fish that won't try to eat them.|`|YhCPSYGzaa	Albino cory catfish|`|jesaDOJEaa	its an albino cory catfish<br>  <br>  Albino Cory Catfish<br>  <br>  Corydoras paleatus<br>  <br>  <br>  The Corydoras genus is well known among aquarists for its many ornamental species. They are well suited to tropical freshwater community aquariums, as they get along well with other species and are not at all aggressive. Corys are shy fish and it is recommended to keep them in groups of at least 4-6, but more is better. Corys are mostly bottom feeders, so they should be offered sinking pellets as well as supplements of live and frozen foods. If flake foods are used, care should be taken to prevent all the food from being eaten by faster moving fish at the higher levels of the tank.<br>  <br>  Most corys prefer soft, acidic water. They can, however, tolerate a wide range of water conditions, including temperatures that are cooler than tropical. They do not do well in fish tanks with high nitrate levels. This ion leads to the infection of the barbels, which will shorten and become useless. The barbels may also be affected by constant contact with a sharp substrate. They are more likely to thrive if there is an open area of substrate on the bottom of the tank where they can obtain submerged food.<br>  <br>  These fish are easy to keep, being peaceful, small, hardy, active, and entertaining. Occasionally they will dart to the surface, sticking their snout above the water for an instant to take a "breath" of air. This behavior is perfectly normal and is not an indication that anything is wrong with the fish. If done in excess, this behavior may indicate poor water conditions.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|ytGdMcQsaa	Thats a Corydora AKA cory cat, Albino cory cat.Believe it or not, there are more that 160 species of them<br>  <br>  Here is a website to stdy about them. <br>  <a href="http://www.fishlore.com/Profiles-Corydoras.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishlore.com/Profiles-Corydor...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/corydoras/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/corydora...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ratemyfishtank.com/freshwater_fish.php/6" rel="nofollow">http://www.ratemyfishtank.com/freshwater...</a>|`|3fEEnsiZaa	He looks like an albino Corydoras catfish.

If she likes to go for walks take her on more walks, car rides, trips to the park, playing ball or fetch.  Keep her active and give her more attention.  You could try taking her to the dog park where she could interact with some dogs, since she is more then likely missing her buddy.|`|YoZZDqq9aa	You answered your own question.

697645ffe5e2de53343807c734ec2ca2aa	Roll over:<br>  <br>  Teach your dog to lie down. It makes it a little easier. <br>  <br>  Say "down", or "lie down", after you say one of those, help your dog to lie down. If they get up right after you help them to lie down, say "down" again. After a little while, your dog will begin to understand what it is that you want him or her to do. It might help to have a tasty treat in your hand and lower it to the ground to attract him/her there. <br>  Use treats. When your dog's on the ground, put the treat by his/her rear, or, alternatively, around the back of his/her neck. He/She should roll over to get it. Do this a few times, saying rollover as he/she does it. After a while, try doing it without the treat. <br>  <br>  Snap your fingers for attention. As he's/she's on his back, snap your fingers to the left side of him/her, and say "roll over", then snap to the right. <br>  <br>  Keep helping him/her to roll over, and keep working with him/her. |`|YoZZDqq9aa	 I would respectfully recommend that you read a couple of books, and watch some videos on raising and training dogs. In addition, I recommend the TV shows "The Dog Whisperer," with Cesar Millan on National Geographic channel, and "It's Me or the Dog," with Victoria Stillwell, on Animal Planet. Both programs are excellent and often cover the issues you raise here. Best wishes|`|zF8H7THFaa	Dog training takes lots of patience and persistence.  I would advise getting some yummy pieces of cut up hot dog, in a quiet area away from distractions, after he's had time to potty and romp.  This way he's more likely to pay attention to you without being overly hyper.  Also, make sure he is on a leash.  Start by letting him smell the food in your hand.  <br>  <br>  The easiset trick to learn is sit.<br>  you want to use the food to incourage him to lift his head and lower his rump into a sit.  If you lift the food too high he will begin jumping up vs putting his rump down.  Think up and backwards with the food.  Once he has this figured out and is doing it with the motion you can put the command word with it.  I like to use "yes" or "good" as a cue word they did the right thing and give them the food.<br>  <br>  Once sit is mastered you can start on down from the sit position and get them to follow follow your hand down for a small treat.  It's very common for the rump to pop up in the beginning.  Just keep working at it and it will come.|`|uGp6mZepaa	Buy or Check out a book on tricks. . .<br>  You can buy one from a book store. . .<br>  Check one out at the Library. . .<br>  <br>  Here's one (To Shake):<br>  <br>  1) Show him a food. . .<br>  2) Keep it in hands (Closed) and (No openings). . .<br>  3) When your dog puts his hand on it (They will try to scratch it out) say "Good" (He should know what "Good" means. . .<br>  4) Keep doing that a few times. . .<br>  5) Then when he gets the hang of it. . .

It helps you bond and they teach easy ways to get your dog to do tricks.
ydshiNrKaa	Start by hand feeding her from her bowl.  Put a small amount of her food in her bowl, hold the bowl in your hand, and remove the food from the bowl and give it to the pup.  Let her see you taking the food from the bowl to give to her.  Do this for several feedings, then start taking the food in your hand and place your hand and food into her bowl.  Let her eat it while your hand is in the bowl and then slowly remove your hand.  Get another handful of food and place it in the bowl, let her eat some, remove your hand.  She should gradually realize that your hand is what is feeding her and she should get comfortable with your hand being where her food is.  This may take some time but with time and patience she should stop the aggressive behavior with her food.|`|YoZZDqq9aa	Presuming she eats dry dibble, feed her one piece at a time from your hand until she's calmer. Then hold the bowl on your lap, and feed her by hand from it. Slowly adjust the process until she's eating out of the bowl herself. When she doe eat out of her bowl, be sure you've touched all the food, so your scent remains.|`|t8KM7CZXaa	I feel their is a problem with her stomach if she is still vomiting after she eats. She might need a trip to the vet. She might not be getting enough nutrition from her food. I wish I knew how much she eats, does she vomit after every meal, is she skinny or fat only in the belly, does she poop good? I would take her to the Vet.|`|Pg6I1Tbzaa	Starting now with a trainer would be probably the best solution.|`|697645ffe5e2de53343807c734ec2ca2aa	If the dog you're working with is very shy or aggressive, you need it to trust you enough to let you approach it and touch it. If the dog cowers or tries to bite when you come near, and you're acting in a nonthreatening manner, the dog has a temperament problem and will need a lot of patient work to train. <br>  <br>  Never shout at a dog, throw things at it, or hit it for any reason. You will only upset the dog and it will not be more inclined to obey you. Besides, this is animal cruelty and it's bad for you as well as the dog. <br>  |`|mnIChQ71aa	lower her food intake during feedings.......restrict  other animals during her feeding time... hopefully she grows out of the temperment.... the vomiting is probably from stress...  you have to remove any and all  that might cause the aggression...... good luck|`|fFrw6ykFaa	This is not a good sign, i would see your vet |`|zF8H7THFaa	You need to find a local trainer who can deal with aggression issues to help you.<br>  <br>  The eating quickly and then vomiting it and eating it again is normal for an animal worried about how much food they are getting.  She is hording down as much as she can and then goes some place safe to re eat it where she doesn't have to worry about someone taking it.<br>  <br>  How does she act if you feed her a treat from your hand?  You may try feeding her from your hand only.  This way she learns the food comes from you.  If she gets growly, snappy, or nasty the food goes away and she would go into a crate.  You can also use the food to train her.  This way she is earning her dinner and learning manners along with the issue you supply the food.<br>  <br>  Please be careful, I would hate to see anyone bit badly.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	She has to realize that everything, and I mean everything she gets in this world comes from you.  So at meal time, you sit beside her bowl and put 1 piece of kibble at a time in her bowl and eats it with you sitting right there with your hand at the bowl.<br>  <br>  Do that for a few days, then start putting a bit of food in her bowl, come back while she's eating and add just a bit more, repeating several times.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, it's reasonable for a dog to be allowed to defend their food from other animals - keep them away.  Each dog or cat should have their own bowl and they should stay away from every other animals' food.<br>  <br>  This puppy isn't a sweet girl, by the way, she's biting.  She'd benefit from puppy kindergarten classes before she gets any older so you can get her socialized and get all her issues under control before she gets worse - which she will without help.

This breaks down the fleas' waxy coating, and they will dehydrate and die. <br>  Vacuum all areas of your home including hardwoods every other day. The spinning bristles of the vacuum break down the fleas waxy coating and cause them to dehydrate and die. <br>  Wash all other bedding (including yours), couch covers, carpet, and any clothes that were out in the open (where fleas could have gotten into or onto them). <br>  Purchase vermiculite at your local hardware store or pet store. Sprinkle on your carpet, then vacuum up. Be sure to vacuum very thoroughly. Fleas love dark warm places like behind doors and under furniture. <br>  Buy a good quality flea control product. Frontline Plus and Advantage are good topical products. Program is an alternative to pesticides; it prevents the fleas from forming chitin. Avoid products containing permethrin, which is highly toxic to cats. <br>  Give your pet a bath using flea shampoo. Read the instructions for how long the shampoo should stay on the animal before rinsing (if you have no flea shampoo, regular or baby shampoo will do the trick, but be careful with essential oils on cats, some can cause serious reactions). <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|Pg6I1Tbzaa	breaking the tick apart it should be dead.<br>  <br>  i suggest now to visit your vet and discuss about flea/tick prevention for your dog if you havent done so already.|`|YoZZDqq9aa	Alcohol may.<br>  <br>  Call and ask your vet.|`|jmz0VTR7aa	Do not do anything to get the head out. If you try all the traditional "methods" or getting it out, there is the possibility that the tick will become irritated and vomit into your dog's bloodstream. This will cause any harmful diseases he is carrying to be released into your dog. You don't want that! Also, if you dig and try to get the head out you could cause infection in the skin from all the irritation.<br>  <br>  Just leave it alone and your dog's body will natural take care of it.

If not, then use alcohol to clean it well.  There's no major health risk by leaving the head in if the tick is dead.  Any harm would've already been done, but chances are he'll be just fine and the skin will dry up and push the head out in a few days time.
z37Aiucdaa	For a puppy of this age you should try them with 3 small meals a day. stay with them while they eat. any food left over after around 20 minutes should be thrown away, and if there is any food left over this should give you a good indication of whether you are giving her too much.<br>  <br>  As she grows gradually decrease her meals to 2 main meals a day and stick to the 20 minute rule. Don't leave food out for her to graze on throughout the day. Don't worry if she has not eaten any at all. stay with the 20 minute rule and she will soon get to learn that there are set meal times for her, as there is for you, and that food is not just available all the time.<br>  <br>  Other factors which affect a dogs appetite are it's exercise and alertness levels.

A good quantity would be 3/4 in the morning and 3/4 for supper. Hills Science Diet is a good company because it is AAFCO approved (Association of American Feed Control Officials). This means that the food does not contain stuff we would not eat, like animal by-prodcuts, and contains everything your dog would need to grow up healthily. If she is active, a cup and a half is the perfect quantity. Once/if she gets fixed, it would be a good idea to reduce that quantity and change to adult food because the digestive slows down and puppy food contains more fat than adult food.|`|WBig0pcnaa	She is a growing puppy needing excess vitamins and needs to eat properly and its going to be a rather medium- large dog.

p9ebJtnjaa	Your previous fish died of accumulative shock and stress caused by full water changes every time you changed their water.  <br>  <br>  Let me explain:<br>  Fish stress easily, and one thing guaranteed to stress them, is being moved.  Generally, moving fish should be a one-way trip, unless you're segregating an ailing fish from healthy stock and moving it back once treatment is over and the fish has fully recovered.  Then you have the chasing the fish around the tank thing - fish aren't like dogs - if you chase them, they don't think you're playing with them - they think you're going to kill them.  So you get the fish out of the tank, move them to another container and leave them there for 2 days.  The fish have only 2 days to de-stress, then the chasing/catching/moving them starts all over again - only this time, they go into water that has completely different chemistry, which shocks them.  They just readjust to the new conditions, when it starts all over again.  Your fish were living in a perpetual state of stress, shock and panic.  That's not healthy for anyone.<br>  <br>  So!  Here's how to get it right:<br>  <br>  Firstly - never, ever change 100% of the water.  It's completely unnecessary.   Instead, change around 10-25% every week, depending on nitrate levels.<br>  <br>  Secondly - never move the fish out of the tank just to change the water - again, it's unnecessary.  They'll get used to your hand being in the water and taking some of the water away, but they'll never get used to you constantly moving them.<br>  <br>  Thirdly - Use a gravel vacuum to clean the gravel/sand at the same time as syphoning off the water (much easier than using a jug for all but the tiniest of tanks).<br>  <br>  Fourthly - Don't leave the water for 2 days.  Temperature match the replacement water and the tank water to reduce shock.  Add the dechloronator, leave it for around 5 minutes, check the temperature with a thermometer, and then slowly pour the water into the tank.<br>  <br>  Do you have a filter and heater?  If not, you need both.  ALL fish need a filter, and bettas are tropical fish that like their water a bit on the warm side for most tropicals.  They don't make their own bubbles to breathe - the bubbles that you refer to are the male's bubble nest, which acts like the aquatic equivelant of a birds nest.  He'll place eggs in there and attend to the eggs and fry until the fry are free-swimming.  Bettas do have a labrynth organ which acts like a primitive lung, meaning the fish can take air directly from the surface, but it's designed as a back-up organ and not for permanent use, so an air pump is still a good idea.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.  If you need any more advice, please feel free to email me.|`|5SmX1oLlaa	im always killing betas too, not on purpose but not sure what i am doing wrong either but i would think you have to let the beta stay in the bag that long, put some of the water from your tank into the bag wait about 15 min. then add it all to the tank that might help good luck.|`|QL56syElaa	Explore this website.. it will answer all your questions<br>  <a href="http://www.bettatalk.com/housing.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bettatalk.com/housing.htm</a><br>  Good Luck!|`|svrFBaENaa	Ok, first, the smaller the tank, the more difficult it's going to be to maintain water parameters. One of the best things to do if your fish are suffering due to water changes is get a bigger tank. The water in a bigger tank is far more stable.<br>  <br>  Second, when doing water changes, you don't need to change all the water. This can shock fish. Try not to go over 50%.. and only do 50% when it's absolutely needed. The only time you should ever change more than half the water is in an emergency.<br>  <br>  One thing you can do with a bigger tank is leave the fish in as you give them a water change. It's far less stressful. Just make sure the water temperature is as close as you can get it. Within 2 degrees. <br>  <br>  If you still opt to remove them and float them, spending 48 hours in a small container causes problems. Small amounts of water build up toxins fast. The water could be toxic in under 48 hours. And never use a container that has been washed with any kind of soap.<br>  <br>  Doubt you do this, but just to be sure, never clean the fish's tank with a cleaner... Soap is deadly to fish... as are things like windex.<br>  <br>  Bettas can live with or without a bubble stone. Bubble stones don't add oxygen to the water from the bubbles, but more from the surface agitation they create. If you have another source of surface agitation, such as a filter, you don't need a bubble stone. However, if you like the look of them, they're fine. Just keep in mind, they do create some current and Bettas prefer low currents due to their long, flowing fins.<br>  <br>  If you have any more questions, feel free to send me an email.|`|xUNwC1B8aa	Well with the Beta it will be different than with most other fish.<br>  <br>  First go to your local pet store and get some water conditioner.  It should say on it that it makes tap water safe for your fish.  OR  Go to a grocery store and get filtered or spring water.<br>  <br>  Take your Beta out of the tank it is in and put it in a container with some of the clean water and make sure it can not jump out.<br>  <br>  Clean your Beta's tank very well.  This type of cleaning will basically be just a first as a restart to your Beta's tank.  To clean again when there is noticeable algae or other growth on the tank walls just use a tank brush or a NON CHEMICALLY TREATED sponge on the walls when needed.<br>  <br>  After your tank is clean rinse some gravel off for the tank and put about 1 inch of gravel on the bottom.  I recommend  gravel made for fish because it has been "smoothed" and will be better for your fish to not get scratched on it and invite disease or infection if they play in or against the gravel.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have a heater for the tank and put it in the tank but do not turn it on yet.  You need to keep your Beta's water about 78 degrees for your Beta.  <br>  <br>  Add your water now then turn on your heater. Beta's are a very resilient fish and hardy so as long as the water is close to the same temp (room temp now that both have been sitting) then you can add your fish to the newly cleaned tank. Normally when adding a fish you would put it in a bag and let it float for about 15 min to get the temp of the water the same in the bag as in the tank to prevent the fish going into shock when introduced into a very different water suddenly.<br>  <br>  With almost every fish or aquatic animal out there you will need a good filter. But with the Beta you do not.  So no worries about that here.<br>  <br>  Your tank should be good to go now.  Just keep the temp stable and change about 25% of the water once weekly in your Beta's tank with the filtered and/or treated water and keep the walls of the tank clean as well and if needed when the gravel gets to horrible you can either do a siphon type gravel vacuum or with a Beta just change the water and rinse off the gravel.  But if it were any other type of fish you would not want to change all the water at once ever. at the most 50% of the water at a time.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck to you,<br>  Rusty aka Abilifys|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	It would have been nice if you would have spaced things out so it didnt hurt so much. But oh well. Ill try.<br>  <br>  My betta tanks are 2.5 gallons. I think they are 12" x 6" x 4". Not sure on that one though. Bettas do best in at LEAST 2.5 gallons of water. They need a filter and a heater. Most pet shops give wrong information out about these fish and they die constantly because of it. Most people actually recommend a 5 gallon tank for them.<br>  <br>  Heres a big thing. You need to actually research fish care. You never change 100% of the water in a tank. You say you would clean the tank, and I hope you werent using any cleaners at all. Well regardless, you shouldnt have changed all the water at once anyways. If you have a proper tank, you should only change 15-20% of the water once a week.<br>  <br>  Another thing. When you do water changes with water conditioner, you shouldnt take the fish out and make him wait to go in his tank because of the conditioner. You should get the water ready for him days before. Take out some of the water, and replace it with the conditioned water.<br>  <br>  When letting fish float, temperature is usually the most important thing, but if you take them out of one type of water, and completely change everything all of a sudden, its going to shock them. I let my bettas float for 15-30 minutes when I first get them. But after that, they are in the tank to stay, so they dont need to float again.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: Never take the fish out of his tank. Never put a betta in a tank smaller than 2.5 gallons. Bettas need filters and heaters. Research proper fish care and proper betta care.<br>  <br>  Bettas should be living in aquariums. Theres no other place for them to live when in our care. And if someone thinks of something, its the wrong answer. I have 8 female bettas in a 29 gallon tank. My male bettas are in separate 2.5 gallon tanks.<br>  <br>  (And bettas dont make bubbles to breathe. They do however make bubblenests that used so the female lays eggs, he places the eggs in the nest so he can care for them. Healthy bettas randomly create bubblenests. Two of mine currently have a bubblenest thats either finished, or they are working on.)|`|pcvcMePXaa	ok well first get the betta a fish tank not a bowl airstones always help, and when clean put the betta is a container and clean out the tank and add new water and add some dechlorinater  to the water and let it sit for about 20 minutes then put the betta in the tank and it should be good just make sure the water is around room temperature.
fZCfJWpOaa	It sounds like there was something traumatic that happened in her life, for her to act this way.  <br>  <br>  I would find a professional trainer that has experience with traumatized dogs.  You'll probably have to do a lot of interviews before finding the right person (there's a lot of fraud "trainers" out there), but it will be worth it in the end.  He/she may be able to give guidance on how to help the dog overcome her fear of people.  Sometimes actions that we as humans do actually reinforce these behaviors, something I had no idea about until I went to my first trainer.  For example, when a dog gets scared and we hold, pet, or comfort them while they're frightened, this reinforces that fearful response.  In a pack the alpha male would only reward behavior it saw as good, so petting a dog that is frightened is telling it "Acting fearful is a good thing".  I had no idea before I talked to our trainer.<br>  <br>  A trainer can also give you individual training with your husband and you, as well as socialization with other pet owners and pets in a controlled environment.  I would stay away from Petsmart or pet store hired trainers.  I used to work there and their training techniques are poor and trainers (usually) not well trained.  Look for someone who has experience with showing their dogs in obedience and agility, and who has certifications with professional organizations such as the American Kennel Club (AKC).|`|ZVIU7QE0aa	Might be a sign that he was abused by a man that's why he is afraid of your husband.

Here's a story.  I got a toy poodle when I was 17.  Tiger matched your dogs symptoms almost exactly with one addition.  He was also terrified of his water bowl.  I tried all kinds of bowls over the years to no avail.  Sometimes I'd just let him drink out of a cup so he wouldn't have to stress out about getting a drink.  When I met my husband and got married, Tiger hated him.  Like your husband, my husband never handled Tiger .  Ever.  My vet thought that Tiger was a litter runt therefore explaining his skidish behavior.  Maybe, who knows.  Anyway the good news is that when I had babies, Tiger loved them.  How bout that.  Over time (years) he even learned to come out and play a little but I remained his complete focus until he was 16 and I had to have him put down.  Sad day.  Good luck and don't give up on him.  If it helps you at all, Tiger has been gone now for (I'm dating myself now) 25 years and we still get a laugh out of talking about him.|`|L5jjhYnNaa	Sounds like she was either neglected by previous owners or abused (possibly by a male since she is hesitant to go to your husband).Its not your fault unless you do nothing about this.Watch cezar Milan the dog whisperer and get some ideas to help curb her fear and socialize her.I wish you the best of luck!|`|hbj6vGE4aa	This sounds more like a sign that the dog has never been socialized, never been trained, and never had confidence boosting interaction with anything.  Also sounds like the breeder may have been breeding dogs with very poor temperaments.  Yorkies are supposed to be brave little things.  <br>  <br>  Start her training right now.  Use a treat to teach the basic commands sit, down, stay, come, etc.  Then move on to tricks.  Knowing what is expected of her is going to boost her confidence.  Then you can start going for walks outside.  Don't make a big deal of it, just leash her, walk down the driveway, then walk back.  She needs to get out and get some socializing.  <br>  <br>  BTW, her nails shouldn't be long enough that they are clicking on the floor... they ought to be shorter.

5191590e3bfb249b99d9737a8504d1e2aa	Dudo que sea adictivo, lo que pasa es que tiene un sabor muy agradable para los gatos, en casa viven muchos gatitos y comen Wiskas cuando las donan o Purina que es lo que yo les compro y generalmente le entran a todo, en ocasiones el abuso de Whiskas produce piedras en el ri?on o obstruccion urinaria, yo tuve ya 4 gatos con este problema por lo que cambié a Purina pero si de vez en cuando me regalan Whiskas no me hago del rogar se las doy y no he tenido problemas. Tengo un gato que a pesar de esto sigue cazando ratones y pajaritos, asi que no creo que esto afecte, el cazar para ellos se vuelve un deporte dado que no tienen hambre.|`|1ba2814838551d15839a83128682d0a5aa	Es cierto.

No es imposicion porque es facilmente reversible.    Tiempo despues de ser bautizado se puede ser prosèlito para orientarse en otras tesis o dogmas religiosas distintas a aquella en que se nació.  Cuando uno nace,no se es autonomo.  Es como confinar al recien nacido a la indefencion si no se le "protege"con las normas culturales que estan en una comunidad dada. Todas las culturas y pueblos hacen lo mismo con sus miembros,les inculcan sus costumbres para integrarlos a esa comunidad o sociedad y no es hasta cuando ya se tiene potestad de valerse por si mismo ,  que puede tomar el fuero religioso que quiera y date cuenta que,..... a veces aun naciendo abrigado bajo un juicio religioso, Jamas apelan a la secta o religion en la que nacen y mucho menos asistan a alguna actividad eclesiastica o religiosa. El bautizmo tiene una importancia relativa;cuantas personas  bautizadas ya adultos, son malacates,malos y hasta asesinos y en cambio personas que jamas  han asistidos a un rito religioso bautizadas o no, son  personas de bien y de mucha actividad y servicio a su comunidad ?   Hay familias que son plenamente seglares o laicas y han sabido orientar la conducta de sus hijos con buenos habitos y costumbres.<br>   Quien no sabe que en algunas familias donde la cabeza de familia(padre) es alcoholico y todos son hijos salen magnificos y  viceversa .  El baptisterio lo conoci en un diccionario(pila de bautismo) y ya bien crecido,me bautizaron en un estadio junto con miles de ni?os,luego asiti con evangelicos,de alli con Testigos de Geova y ahora voy a la iglesia cuando se santolea un pariente fallecido. La gente le teme mas a los vivos que a los muertos. Pienso que en los concilios romanos,se integran nuevas normas en el clero para hacer que la institucion se conserve como tal,es decir,que el objetivo tradicional de la iglesia sea el mismo de abastecer con todo lo que demanda para prevalecer como un poder. Sin embargo, no podemos dejar a un lado el hecho de que la religion asi como la conocemos,sirve para frenar impulsos desaforados de algunos ante la posibilidad de arder en el infierno como una tea inmarcesible y esto si es de suma importancia porque en cierta forma trae un poco de seguridad a la poblacion en general. La iglesia catolica ha perdido credibilidad,ha perdido terreno,pero los gobiernos saben que tienen que estar en contuvernio y complicidad con ella pues es mediante la fe que se influye en los animo a la hora de las elecciones y esto por la manipulacion de la fe de los curas que son sus alfiles(catolicos),pero aun con estos ya la gente no quieres ir al confesionario desde que han estado saliendo esos MANOSEADORES DE CHICOS.

They are very intelligent though, so make sure to plan on obedience classes and consider competing in obedience or agility or rally competitions.  Make sure you get them from a reputable PUREBRED breeder and avoid those in the "doodle" business (you know, the labradoodle, goldendoodles and such... they are just in it for $$$ and not for the breed).<br>  <br>  They are awesome with respectful children but wouldn't be above giving a disrespectful child (one who is pushy or physical with the dog) a good nip to put it in it's place!!|`|df762cb8513b1ad414004f93433a36fbaa	Standard poodles are ok. They to tend to have tempers. I would suggest a Retriever. Goldens are WONDERFUL with kids. I have a Golden and he is great with kids. My friends Standard Poodle was okay though she tend to nip at the kids. Also, Goldens dont get as large as Standard Poodles. Goldens are also great with other animals. Labs are also good dogs, but they tend to be more hyper. And may knock down the little ones. Good luck.|`|5811b97c3a5666d91aa593a94f79b223aa	Yes, It is a goog dog.|`|8b4d22d151235f1759cc6721c0505e62aa	Poodles can be high-strung and nervous; but if you were to insist on a poodle, you'd be doing the right thing in getting a standard poodle--these are much more calm than their smaller cousins.<br>  <br>  Still, I would not recommend a poodle for a family with very small children. Children are often loud, overwhelming, and unpredictable to a naturally nervous dog; and an enthusiastic child may end up getting nipped or even bitten.<br>  <br>  While poodles can't do a huge amount of damage with their small mouths, they can hurt a child; and they're one of the top five breeds when it comes to biting--probably because of that high-strung nature of theirs. Usually, it's fear aggression--you want a calm home for a poodle.<br>  <br>  While standard poodles aren't very small, a young child easily outweighs one, and can conceivably do damage to the poodle.<br>  <br>  If you can find a very, very confident poodle puppy, and you can train it well, treat it consistently and kindly, and teach the children how to handle a dog--then yes, it can work. Breeds aren't straitjackets when it comes to personality; a general tendency doesn't mean each individual dog will be like that.<br>  <br>  Instead of a poodle, you may consider a very good-natured breed such as a Golden Retriever, Lab, or beagle. (Each of these breeds has its own troubles: Beagles need a lot of exercise and can't be left alone in the yard; Goldens and Labs really need companionship and can suffer from separation anxiety and chewing problems.) Or you could get a garden-variety mutt; these are often rather well-adjusted dogs, since they don't have temperament problems caused by necessary inbreeding, which purebred dogs often do have.|`|dd3232144817febe6bb7af6ef029ccd1aa	Poodles are great family dogs if they are raised properly.<br>  They are extremely intelligent which can lead them to think that they are the dominant ones in the house.<br>  I would definately recommend some basic training and make sure that it spends lots of time around children & people in general. <br>  To ensure the dog doesn't get dominant over the children ensure the children know how to react around the dog by teaching them some of the basic training techniques the dog has learned and make sure they reward the dog with a treat!<br>  One of the easiest things to do is to always have the dog sit before the child pets the dog..the child can then give the dog a treat.|`|ea8a108e8ddb6115ca105b4a65148defaa	I don't know what the others are saying.  Standard poodles are crap dogs for old ladies.  They are overpriced inbred nasty dogs that have a tendency to bite.  There are several books on eBay that clearly list the demeanor and energy of dogs to help you select a breed.  Most of these books are available at the library as well.  Once you take a dog it is too late to find out that it doesn't fit your home and it will make your life miserable.|`|AA12306254	as long as the dog is playful and well trained|`|11255d813bf8db20b41cdcd51df49ac6aa	If I were you I would look into retrievers, labs, collies and also beagles they are all great with kids, steer clear of boxers though, they have been known to turn when least expected to do so.

RmSQIc0Vaa	Baby birds fledge (leave the nest) several days before they start to fly. They hop around on the ground, and they climb on low branches until their wings are strong enough for them to fly. The parent birds continue to feed and care for the fledglings until they are self-sufficient. If you see a baby bird on the ground, and the bird has most of his feathers, leave him alone. Do not think that he needs to be "rescued."<br>  <br>  If you see a baby bird on the ground, and the baby is naked or he has mostly fuzz, he is a nestling and is not ready to fledge. Try to put him back in the nest. Do not worry about your scent being on him. It won't bother the mother. Birds do not have an acute sense of smell, and the parents will not detect your scent on the baby.<br>  <br>  Wildlife biologists and bird banders handle baby birds all the time - they are licensed to do so - and the parent birds never abandon their babies because of this.<br>  <br>  If you can not get the nestling back into his own nest, hang a basket (like an easter basket) on a tree limb as close to the nest as you can reach. Place paper towel in the bottom of the basket, and put some grass and leaves in with the baby bird. The parents find their babies by sound, not by sight or smell, so as long as they can hear the baby, they will come and feed him. Placing it on a high limb will keep cats and other predators from getting it, as they would if you left it on the ground.<br>  <br>  If you find a baby bird on the ground, and it seem to have been injured by the fall - or if you find an injured adult bird - contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator. You should be able to find one here: <a href="http://www.tc.umn.edu/~devo0028/contact.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tc.umn.edu/~devo0028/contact....</a>  or here:  <a href="http://www.wildliferehabber.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wildliferehabber.org/</a><br>  <br>  Licensed wildlife rehabilitators have the specialized training to care for sick, injured and orphaned wild animals, and they have the required state and federal licenses that allow them to keep the wild animals until they are healthy enough to be released.<br>  <br>  Do not take the animal to a vet - vets are for pets, and most vets do not have the expertise to care for wild animals; nor do most vets have the proper licenses that would allow them to keep a recuperating wild animal.<br>  <br>  Do not attempt to keep a wild bird and care for it yourself. In the US, ALL native migratory birds - not just endangered species - are protected under federal law (Migratory Bird Treaty Act), and it is illegal to keep any protected bird unless you have the required permits. Penalties for violating this law include fines of up to $500 and/or up to 6 months in jail for each offense. <br>  <br>  You can see the list of birds protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act here:  <a href="http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/issues/nonnative/50CFR10.13.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/issues...</a><br>  <br>  If this is a fledgling, leave it alone.  If it is a nestling and you can not get it back to its own nest, or provide a substitute nest where its parents can care for it, you need to turn it over to a licensed wildlife rehabilitator immediately. All baby birds learn to recognize and find their own food by watching their parents. When a bird is raised in captivity, you do not just stop feeding it and let it go free - it will starve. A licensed rehabilitator will weigh the bird and assess its condition regularly. They will provide a flight cage for the bird, so it can exercise its wings and learn how to fly. They have a procedure for conditioning a bird to recognize and find its own food, so it can survive in the wild. There is also, depending on the species and the condition of the individual bird, an optimum time of the year, and time of the day, that it should be released, and a particular environment into which it should be released. You learn all this when you study to get your rehabber's license. This is why no untrained, unlicensed person should ever attempt to care for a sick, injured or orphaned wild bird - there is so much more to it than just "what do I feed it?" That is why the federal government requires that all persons who wish to care for native wild birds be licensed.|`|Jx213fn6aa	This is most likely not an emergency. Continue not to touch it or it will be rejected by all birds. I would suggest contacting your local animal hospital if it just stays on the ground and there are no parents around in a day or so, but as of now, just assume that the parents are there. Stay away from it, and maybe  watch from inside to see if the parents come down. If you can locate the nest, just keep an eye on it but DO NOT touch it or the bird.<br>  <br>  If you stay around the bird for too long, it will imprint on humans and not survive in the wild.|`|2wV7ZsUoaa	DONT TOUCH IT. wild birds will be rejected by their parents if they have any sort of human oil or sent on them. then the bird will die. if the mother does not come back for it, it means she already rejected it. dont touch it, dont pick it up. the SPCA wont come out for that, its not an emergency. leave it alone. if it dosnt take care of itself, it will die. if theirs no other birds, then its on its own. im sorry to say that. but its nature, and it takes its own course. if you feed it bread it will die. i dont know why everyone has 2 feed bread 2 birds.. it sticks in their intestine causing bowel problems and blockage.. yet everyone thinks its the #1 healer for all birds.

ec02b3b2ac0531db23e2884c415edc09aa	I would keep up the mixed food for about 6months. Then slowly eliminate the canned all together, until you are feeding only dry food.  It's much easier to store and handle, and the dogs do very well on it.|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	You can continue mixing canned food and dry food for her whole life. You can feed it with her dry twice per day.<br>  <br>  Canned food doesn't hurt the dog at all. Contrary to popular belief(even among some vets, thankfully not all) canned food doesn't cause tooth issues nor does dry help prevent them. Dogs do not chew their food like people..food is not in the mouth long enough to cause problems. Also canned food has a higher meat content then dry and it also has less carbohydrates..in other words it contains more of what dogs need..meat and less of what they don't need..grains.<br>  A Lab puppy is fine on a good qaulity puppy food until they are 6 mnoths old..then you can gradually switch over to adult food. Make sure to feed a good qaulity food that doesn't contain corn, wheat, soy, beet pulp.|`|5KZdTMPDaa	Keep mixing the wet food as long as your vet tells you to, but I would stop after about 7 or 8 months.  Slowly reduce the amount of wet food and replace it with dry food.  Do this every week until she is on all dry food.  <br>  <br>  Dry food helps keep dogs teeth and gums healthy by removing plaque and tarter.  Face it dogs do not brush as often as we do.  Plus, wet food tends to make dogs fat.  It is filled with fat and unecessary calories.|`|AA10182638	I would slowly start weaning her off of it right now.  Dogs don't need to eat canned food, unless for a medical problem.  Canned food in general isn't good for dogs.  It does not help their teeth at all, because they aren't crunching anything to remove plaque or tartar, and it gets lodged up in their teeth making their breath smell.  There is no reason to have a dog on canned food unless he or she really needs it.|`|BIXFVpVxaa	She should not be on canned food at this age. It creates builup on the teeth which can lead to many other problems if not corrected now. Dry food contains a better balance of the nutrients that she needs. Canned food is usually only used for puppies weaning off their mother or senior dogs who have dental problems. Start taking her off slowly gradually adding more dry food daily until she is eating just dry food. If you are concerned about feeding your dog canned food or stopping feeding her the food call your vet and ask what they reccomend.|`|afuuqpRUaa	As a long-time large dog owner, I actually would suggest you switch to an adult formula - we see less problems with Panosteitis (or Pano) in large breed dogs fed an adult maintenance formula as opposed to any puppy formula.<br>  Most vets and pet food folks push the puppy food as there are kick-backs, but talk to any GOOD breeder and most feed adult kibble. Raw diet is also highly recommended.

Como ves, la marea es baja y estas estrellas han quedado en la orilla si no las arrojo al mar morirán aquí en la arena.<br>  - Entiendo, le dije, pero hay miles de estrellas de mar sobre la playa. No puedes lanzarlas a todas. Son demasiadas. Además esto sucede en cientos de playas, ?No tiene sentido?<br>  El hombre se inclinó y tomó una estrella marina y mientras la lanzaba de vuelta al mar me respondió :<br>  - ?

Algunas estrellas de mar miden sólo de 1 a 2 cm de extremo a extremo cuando son adultas, pero otras alcanzan los 65 cm,cuerpo rígido y se mueven arrastrándose lentamente. La boca se encuentra en la parte inferior y está rodeada por una serie de brazos radiales,tienen sexos separados y liberan el esperma y los huevos en el agua, donde se producen la fecundación y las primeras fases de su desarrollo,tienen el poder de regenerar partes de su cuerpo, y en algunas especies esto se convierte en un medio habitual de reproducción asexual, en el que de cada fragmento de la estrella madre surgen nuevos individuos.<br>  Carecen de ano, y si lo tienen, éste se encuentra en la parte superior del cuerpo. La piel, rugosa y correosa, suele tener espinas. El animal tiene un intestino grande, un complejo sistema de cavidades corporales y un sistema nervioso sencillo y sin cerebro.Se alimentan de gran variedad de productos, como los depósitos del fondo oceánico. Pueden comerse enteros animales peque?os; en el caso de presas más grandes, sacan el estómago y las digieren fuera del cuerpo.|`|353739d93646c8abc79852adabcbe993aa	asexualmente|`|514a21f2e91e8061a4e5c15acc8f5d53aa	que buena pregunta ,gracias a ti investigue en internet jaja su reproduccion es asexual<br>  <br>  aqui hay una pagina interesante<br>  <a href="http://www.sheddaquarium.org/sea/fact_sheets_sp.cfm?id=101" rel="nofollow">http://www.sheddaquarium.org/sea/fact_sh...</a><br>  besos y feliz a?o|`|7230751c557c8bff9cc2aff956ea47b3aa	con reproduccion asexual|`|a41a3273c94111d27668bfe797fded3daa	Se reproducen asexualmente, por brotación, si una parte de la estrella se separa de dicha estrella, se regenera un nuevo ser(estrella).<br>  <br>  Suerte y Bye!<br>  <br>  Felices Fiestas!|`|22486230dd35f42f51a3e0be330cf2c7aa	sexo|`|257070287441810e9047bfef7939f0c7aa	Se reproducen asexualmente, no me acuerdo como se llama pero una parte de la estrella se separa de ella y de ahí sale un ser nuevo|`|48b2a2b1c1e08c38aaf3a034067ecd35aa	Los equinodermios(estrellas) presentan individuos masculinos y femeninos, y, tras la union en el agua de las celulas sexuales, ke producen unos y otros, se forma una larva nadadorake sufre metamorfosis hasta transformarse en adulto.|`|78fbaf4da05cdd1e213ea31bed32239daa	Hola que tal?

0b6691be66651a8e0f44ae92e9fce0a2aa	Hi there...after reading all your other questions relating to Smokey's injury it would be best to let the wound alone after it's been cleaned up.  The more you fuss with it the more likely you will keep irritating it and prevent it from healing.  Additionally, since your mother is a veterinarian it would be better to contact her for advice and entrust her with Smokey's care rather than any one of us who are total strangers to you.  Sometimes people may mean well and try to help, however we could accidentally advise you incorrectly and this may also cause Smokey more harm than good especially since we are not licenced medical veterinary doctors like your mother.|`|c178981b5b65aa5c946dfca53b95a9b7aa	srry i dont know.|`|3facdb279c4a64b151ac8a4aa751671daa	you shouldn't aply water to any wounds...animal or human because water has bactiria in it that dosn't bother us or anything else unless its on an open wound you could possibly hurt yoour cat more this way...try calling your vet maybe she/he will give you better advise! <br>             good luck smokey and good luck to you!|`|5811b97c3a5666d91aa593a94f79b223aa	I don't know about hot water because it probably will hurt more try cold water and put something on it to stop the pain and then wrap it up so it won't get infected.|`|737d4255923a5b3a111531d512ea1653aa	Sorry, don't have a cat and don't know much about cats.

Get him toys, and when he goes to nip hand him a toy he likes and praise him when he takes it. He is also going to be teething, so get him a toy called a Kong and fill it with peanut butter and give it to him. It will keep him busy for quite some time.<br>  Also, he should not be growling at strangers. A good way to introduce him to other people outside your household is to enroll him in obedience classes. Corgi's are also good at agility, so you may want to enroll him in that after a good obedience course. You'll have to keep him busy, so if you can, keep him enrolled in some type of activity. It should be fun for both of you. If you find a course is less than fun, than move on to a different course, or find a different association to help motivate and stimulate your dog's learning abilities. Take him with you whenever you can because it just helps in socializing him further.<br>  <br>  If you are not a professional breeder, consider seriously neutering him. Breeding is something left best in the hands of professionals for more reasons than I care to list.<br>  <br>  A good site for you to visit is:<br>  http:www.dogs.about.com<br>  Lots of tips on the overall care and training of dogs, plus oodles of links too!<br>  Good luck with your Corgi.

Anyone who breeds and sells puppies for the wholesale pet market (pet stores), is a wholesale breeder. <br>  A single puppy costs the importer $200.00 - $350.00 each which can sell for $1,200.00 to $3,500.00 or more here in the United States. A very large profit margin! These puppies are being imported into this country as young as 6 to 8 weeks old. Some puppies do not survive the long trip! The ones that do survive are often weakened and stressed and susceptible to serious diseases and deadly viruses which can kill or lead to a lifetime of chronic illnesses. Many of these puppies do not meet the AKC breed standard and are often poor specimens of the breed. There are a lot of brokers here in California! If the person has a lot of puppies and no parents on the premises that is a red flag. They will tell you that they have family over seas that they get there dogs from. It is all a lie. Please do not support this!|`|DLtj51ALaa	A puppy broker is a person who represents a company that performs the service of being the middleman between breeders (Usually breeders who are in it to make a buck) and pet stores.  If you purchase a puppy from a pet store in most cases a broker is involved.  The broker indicates the going rate for puppies of different breeds to breeders.  The broker takes all of the puppies he buys to a vet.  The vet works on behalf of the broker.  His job is to find anything he/she can find wrong with the puppies.  They are not concerned with the dog's health - only with what sells.  For example, the biggest healthiest puppy in the litter may be "overweight" at 8 weeks.  Genetics playa strong role in the adult weight of a puppy.  However, if the weight limit on a breed is 3 pounds and a breeder presents a healthy puppy that weighs in at 3 1/2 pounds - he is "docked" money.  In other words the check in the mail will be for less than what was promised even if a breeder tries his/her best to raise the healthiest puppies.  The breeder may only get $75 for a puppy you see in a pet store for $1000.  Many of the puppies sold to the broker are"puppy mill" puppies.  The bottom line is - the broker and the pet stores are the ones really making out.<br>  <br>  Also, the brokers drive these puppies all over creation on their rounds picking up puppies.  They take them to the vet and after they decide on a final price to give the breeder, they ship the puppies via plane.  This is all very stressful to an 8 week old puppy and is often why pet store puppies can be sick.|`|SpYgLhzUaa	It is a person who deals in puppies purely for financial gain. They very rarely breed and their only interest is in how much money they can get for a puppy. Never go through a dealer whether an individual or a shop. t is far better to contact the breed club of the breed you are interested in and find yourself a reputable breeder and buy direct from them.
62c54e8918bc0f3bd9e20d05e7de14c8aa	Las garras de las patas frontales son mucho más largas en los machos que en las hembras....<br>  Además algunas características sexuales en los machos notarás que la abertura de la cloaca se localiza externamente al borde del caparazón y en las hembras la abertura de la cloaca se localiza en el borde del caparazón. En los machos<br>  la cola es mas larga y gruesa que en las hembras, y el plastrón de los<br>  machos es cóncavo y en la hembra es plana.<br>  <br>  Aquì te pongo màs informaciòn :<br>  Algunas de las características más generales que se usan para diferenciar el sexo de las tortugas son las siguientes:<br>  <br>  EL TAMA?O: En muchas especies de tortugas acuáticas, y concretamente en las Tortugas de Orejas Rojas, la hembra adulta es considerablemente más grande que el macho. No obstante la diferencia del tama?o no es útil cuando se trata de individuos inmaduros.<br>  <br>  LA CON.CHA: El plastrón del macho es cóncavo, mientras que el de la hembra es liso o ligeramente convexo. La concavidad del macho es una ayuda para poder ponerse sobre la hembra en la copulación.<br>  <br>  LA COLA: En los machos la cola es bastante más grande y gruesa, que en las hembras, especialmente en la base, donde el pene está invertido.<br>  <br>  EL COLOR: Los machos tienen las manchas de las orejas más grandes y de un rojo más brillante e intenso que las hembras.<br>  <br>  LAS GARRAS: En los machos las garras (u?as) delanteras son increiblemente largas, y las usan para acariciar la cara de la hembra durante el cortejo.|`|257070287441810e9047bfef7939f0c7aa	Si tu tortuga tiene la base osea el caparazón de abajo liso quiere decir que es hembra y si tiene una curva por el extremo de las patas es macho, porque cuando tienen sexo el macho se sube arriva de la hembra y esta curva hace que se acomode con facilidad ya k si lo tuviera liso no pudiera.<br>  suerte!|`|44cb21fd57cb2775a40ed055b534fde4aa	Por su cola...

Hazle cari?itos cuando untes el shampoo y lo enjuagues (con un traste poco a poco le echas agua). Si lo haces despacio y hablándole, no se alteran, hasta lo disfrutan. Ya que si los nudos son muy resistentes, despues del shampoo intenta con un poco de acondicionador. Colócalo en su pelaje húmedo, déjalo actuar 2 minutos y rocia un poco más de agua.

27d2fe79dd9df7b907483b0eb75c1a39aa	Take the dog to the petstore to see the chinchillas.  I was told years ago I couldn't have a chinchilla and a cat.  They were best buds.  The chinchilla would drag a shoe string around and the cat would chase it.  When the chinchilla got sick the cat laid right next to him and actually mourned his death.|`|880bf414af7b60e5b70dcea0d1f788c4aa	When it comes to cages for a chinchilla the bigger the better, but a medium size cage approx 36x26x20 would be OK for a single chinchilla. I have 3 dogs and 2 chinchilla's and I would never let the dogs close to them. Chinchillas can be injured easily a jump to elude the dog or even the dog stepping on it could injure it. I just have one room where the dogs don't go and the chinchilla's can't get out, but I would never let them in the same room together.|`|1e5880c1c7c9c059ccb47a41d21e0336aa	That all depends on your dog.  I have a Boston Terrier that would probably kill it just because she would want to play and she plays very rough.  If your dog is mild mannered and has been around other animals it would probably leave it alone, although there may be some initial curriosity.|`|62269f46091acb9253bd8877713e550baa	I think the breed of the dog is important; any kind of terrier would instinctively kill it. Cages for chinchillas are pretty large. I think my old cage was about 3' x 4' x 3'. Chinchillas are pretty skittish creature. They can die of heart attacks if they get too scared. Even if the dog was friendly, it's probably not a good idea.|`|AA10895592	I had a chinchilla. You need a large cage that the animal has levels on. A huge ferrett cage works best. Do your homework on these animals. They can't be above 70 degrees so keep em in the basement. If you live in an apartment don't get one cuz you can't guarantee it does not get hot. Chinchillas don't sweat they rip their fur off then die from overheating. Don't put the animal around dogs. Even if your dog is nice to it , it could have a heartattack. Get one after you no longer have a dog. I love chinchilla's but have an apartment. I will get one when I have a basement. Believe me I came home to a dead chinchilla cause no book said they overheat

En mi caso tuvimos que poner la comida de la gata en un mueble alto para que el perrito no le quite su comida y ella siempre andaba subida a sitios donde el perro no podía llegar, el cachorro se ira acercando poco a poco a ellas, al perrito le gustara las gatas porque las ve asi como el animalitos pero eso cuando ya este un poco mas grandecito y las seguira y las molestara(tu sabes como son los gatos que les gusta tener su espacio). Pero por ejemplo mi gata cuando el perro se le acerca ya mucho le manda un zarpaso como alejándolo, así que siempre anda con todas las cachetadas que les da mi gata a mi perro, al principio yo estaba muy asustada y pensé que mejor devolvía al perrito pero después de los a?os puedo decir que no pasa nada malo y que terminaron conviviendo en un departamento de los mas tranquilos y hasta creo que ahora se quieren.|`|9ae3e61a0a72c9ad8c78586be05ba088aa	jajaja te va a costar bastante trabajo, io tengo una gata de 5 a?os y hace 2 meses que llego un perrito, huy no pues la gata cada que tiene oportunidad lo corretea... te va a costar trabajo para que se adapte, pero bueno si tienes al perrito en un lugar especifico, cuando no este el perro, con cuidado lleva a las gatitas a donde se duerme el cachorro, dejalas ahi para que olfateen, y bueno no les pierdas atencion a las gatitas a causa del perro... y lo reitero van a estar agresivas un ratito pero se terminaran acostumbrando..... otro consejo, si estubiste jugando con el cachorro, no vayas a acercarte al gato, primero siquiera labate las manos o algo asi porque si te olfatean con el olor del perro.. se van a poner todas locas. mucha suerte!!! la vas a necesitar! ciao|`|bbb30d6961c2806eaea4aa694eadef87aa	si eh pasado por  eso  y  te aseguro  que  con el tiempo ellos se  acostumbraran a la presencia  del perrito,es  solo un ajuste de  espacio pero veras  que  cuando menos  acuerdes  andaran correteando  con el perro,,los  animales  se adaptan al modo de vida de nosotros  y  si  tu los  tratas bien por  igual tendran una  gran familia de mascotas..|`|f5a8e94d0fa2756adb44b026bf597030aa	en realidad no podes nada mas que darles tiempo yo hace 10 a?os que tengo a mi perrita que siempre única en la casa, se llevo siempre mal con los perros de mi abuela y todo, yo traje hace dos meces una perrita a casa y los primeros días la odiaba ahora comen juntas del mismo plato y se la pasan jugando.

cfff2d6ddb55b875c70e1b73621e7391aa	It is best to introduce your Boxer to the new pug away from your home at first.  If your Boxer is socialized and deals with people well, ask the pug breeder if they mind you bringing the boxer over for a little introduction.  This way your boxer and pug get their first meeting on neutral ground.  <br>  Pugs are a wonderful breed and love to be loved. One of our neighbors has a boxer and pugs interact with him very well. Boxers can be very protective though.<br>  When we got our 2nd pug we were always trying to make sure we spent enough time with our 1st pug, making sure no one felt left out and we didn't try to over-do it with the puppy and our 1st pug.  Baby pugs can be a bit nippy and sometime are a little overwhelming for another dog, so we did try to separate them a bit just to keep the little nipper at bay for a little while.<br>  We kept our puppy food in a different room from the adult pug, different nutrition levels and puppy food always looks really interesting to the other dogs.<br>  Pugs are wonderful, you won't regret having one.  I have three!|`|AA11489053	I got my pug when he was 8 weeks, hardly could walk... I didn't use a leash with him and he was so afraid of the world he'd follow within 4 feet of where ever I went... pugs are great.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	Pick neutral territory, such as a neighbor's yard, or even walking down the block to the corner. Both dogs should be on leashes. If you have more than one dog already at home, introduce them one at a time to the puppy. Start with the most friendly, submissive of your dogs. You can start by having a friend (not a family member) holding the puppy in your arms and letting your adult dog take a good sniff. Then separate, put the puppy down and allow the dogs to approach one another at their own speed. Stay relaxed! The dogs can sense if you are tense. Verbal encouragement, such as "good dogs!" reinforce any good behavior. If there is any agression on either side, you will have to take a break and try again. If the agression continues, try this program  and/or consult a behaviorist or trainer. If all goes well, allow the dogs to spend five or ten minutes together|`|qK9AM1aHaa	Try not to pick favorites.|`|aff12ee9c8750e4530d3ac705c705347aa	Congrats!!! I have a pug and they are precious.

They are natural comedians!!|`|b19c2e6517aef1f94f4966c12f3ce530aa	I have a 1 1/2 year old pug that we love so much. I did a lot of research on what kind of dog we should get and we finally settled on a pug. Pugs are great all around, very friendly, loyal, great with kids (should they come in the future), energetic but mellow when necessary and they do good by themselves if you need to be gone for long periods of time. Cons: shedding!!! I suggest keeping her groomed with anice hair cut, snoring and snorting in your face (if you find that a con; I think it's cute). It's been a year and a half and we haven't encountered any of these things but I know they are prone to them, like knee probs, nasal probs, and they are prone to eye injuries. They are very easy to potty train and it only took us about 2 months if that. They are very smart and learn very easily.  Hope this helps. Enjoy your new pug!

It could be many things.|`|bIvQ1htJaa	If you don't like your particular vet, find another one, because this sounds serious (probably not life-threatening) and very uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  My dog has hot-spots too, and I just had an allergy test done on her Monday. We're still waiting for the results, but it's common for dogs to get allergies in the summer. Her itching started about two months ago, and the vet kept giving her the cortizone shot, which only helped for a couple days. On Monday, I just put my foot down and told him, "Listen, I'm tired of wasting my money on this shot. It's not working, and I want to know EXACTLY what is wrong with her." Needless to say, I got my way.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to change vets or seek a second opinion, then I suggest you lay down the law with your vet too. I'm no professional, but it sounds like your dog has allergies or some other skin reaction to the environment. Please take it to the doctor.|`|ckNiEP63aa	If your dog was out side for a period of time it might have gotten bitten by a bug. Clean the area and put some cream on it for 2days or so to see if it clears. Use a baby cream so if the dog licks it wont make him sick. Our min pin runs free on 1/2 acre and we bombed the yard because they kept eating her alive. Try these remedies and see if they work. If not seek a vets help.

Are they not  themselves playful etc? If your cat goes 1 more day take to the vet.  When cats do not eat for more then 2-3 days they are sick.  If your cat just gave birth, she needs to eat as she is nursing kittens right.

También puedes intentar asustarlo al golpearlo con un diario enrollado, este hace mucho ruido y poco da?o físico.<br>  <br>  Un perro sin ejercicio, sin juego, en lugares peque?os, amarrado, solitario y con poca atención desarrolla malos hábitos por aburrimiento y stress.<br>  <br>  Recuerda que en estado salvaje pertenecían a un grupo, con el cuál cazaban, exploraban, competían y se relacionaban. ?Que tanto completas sus necesidades?. Suerte, acercate más a él.|`|a53360fdb26e99ce45bfe7cfd1e2cc5aaa	mira la solucion es muy facil y efectiva, solo tienes que asustarlo, pero no tu sino algo inanimado que caiga justo a su lado y que haga mucho ruido justo en el momento en que el perro haga esa trastada. Si lo ri?es tu, el perro aprende a co.ger la ropa cuando tu no estas, si pones el tendedero mas algo, los saltos de tu perro tambien seran mas altos con el peligro que eso supone. Pues bien, la solucion es que te las ingenies para que justo en el momento en que tu perro salta o muerde la ropa, una tapa de una olla, el palo de una escoba o una silla plegada de jardin, caigan justo a su lado, sin herirlo. El se asustara mucho  y huira de alli, si lo haces bien te bastaran solo dos sesiones para que asocie que alli hay algo que lo ha asustado y no querra ni salir. Otra opcion es que cuando tendais entreis al perro o lo amarreis pero la tentacion seguira estando alli.

q1zqQfPJaa	Olá amiga.<br>  <br>  Ao longo de minha vida tive a oportunidade de conversar com uma pessoa super especial.. e que me contou uma coisa que mexeu comigo profundamente.<br>  <br>  O seu companheiro, ele sempre vai ser fiel a vc, vai sempre gostar de vc, e claro... o carinho dele é irreversível.<br>  <br>  Mas, pense bem, vale a pena ver sua amiga sofrendo, sentindo tanta dor, tomando tanto remédios, sendo submetida a tanto estresse só porue vc acha que pode controlar isso? essa pergunta me foi feita quando uma gatinha minha morreu. Depois disso escrevi um texto, que mostra o que eu realmente sinti e sinto no momento. As nossas dores se acalmam em poder saber que nossos amigos v?o embora em paz, pois se eles ficassem vivos por mais tempo sofreria... Qual animal quer fica inválido? eles s?o diferente de nós que podemos fazer terapias. O estresse pra um animal "deficiente" pode levar ele a uma melancolia profunda e levá-lo a morte.<br>  <br>  Desde ent?o, quando sei que n?o há o que fazer, e sei que o animal vai ficar sofrendo por mais tempo... converso com ele... e pergunto, pe?o a Deus que me dê um "sinal". <br>  N?o quero ter um cora??o criel exigindo que o animal sofra só pra suprir minhas deficiências emocionais.<br>  <br>  Pense bem. <br>  O primeiro animal que isso teve de ser feito, eu fiz o vet colocar MUITA anestesia, pq eu n?o queria que ele sentisse dor. <br>  Esse mesmo c?o me fez crer no qu?o hipócrita eu era em querer interferir nos propósitos de Deus. Ele me pediu pra que eu o deixasse ir, pois eu sei o quando ele lutou.<br>  <br>  Eles tem alma.

The F8 thrives in a lower salinity than the GSP however. The GSP has even be acclimated to full marine!<br>  <br>  2. The GSP needs 30 gallons so no GSP.

All Puffers can "puff up" to an extent, I've even heard of some doing it just to get attention and be fed, HOWEVER, the act of puffing up can cause internal damage and ultimately lead to the the death of the fish.

svrFBaENaa	There sure is.<br>  <br>  If you're trying to create a true brackish aquarium, you will need more than just salt. Oceans don't just contain salt, as I'm sure you're aware. There are a lot of trace elements floating around.<br>  <br>  Get some marine salt mix, a hydrometer, and shoot for a gravity of 1.008.. However, it depends a lot on what species of fish you're going to put in it.<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind, when you change the water, you're going to want to add water that's premixed with the proper amount of marine salt or you can severely stress your fish.<br>  <br>  Edit: No, Brackish water is not fresh water with a little bit of salt in it. That's fresh water with a little bit of salt in it. Brackish water is where fresh water and marine water mix. This is found in nature in coastal pools and where rivers and streams empty into the ocean. There is a difference.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Buffers.<br>  Brackish water tends to have a high pH, around 8.0 to 8.4, so if your source water doesn't start out in this range, some pH buffers are called for. However, if you use a commercial marine aquarium salt mix, most of these already contain buffers (read the label).|`|AA12347845	Brackish is not Marine - it is freshwater with a low amount of salt content. Fish like Scat, Mono-Angels & Mollies come in this category.<br>  <br>  You can the required quantity of 'untreated' (un-iodized salt ) with some mineral additive.Salt quantity depents on species - check the species profile for appropriate salt content.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|6979bf0ecfe9ee379c6d4efa120ff381aa	Brackish water aquariums usually have a higher pH and vary widely as to salt content. Many fish are bred in captivity . It's always a good idea to ask the place you buy your fish from what mix they are using and go with that.
EJpiaCMQaa	I actually prefer budgies and finches, which is why I have them as pets.  I prefer Parrots, although I enjoy rabbits, too.  Parrots are colorful and very intelligent.  They can become very good talkers.  I did some volunteer work with rabbits, where I helped socialize them at a local Petco so they would be ready for adoption.  The rabbits I socialized were very sweet and adorable.  The only thing I'm not crazy about is getting rabbit hair stuck all over me.  Other than that, it was alot of fun.|`|AA10129150	I've only ever owned a rabbit, but I've never really been fond of birds. Birds I think should be wild, and they can be very noisy, they also can be very smart.

I loved my rabbit a lot and that is who I would prefer!|`|SimAO1IUaa	rabbits they are cuter and they like to snuggle and their smart. parrots are cool because they can talk though.. and btw. rabbits dont hide all the time and they do not get scared easy if they have alot of interaction with humans they get used to it.|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	Parrots.

EJpiaCMQaa	I've had that happen with some of my budgies.  Sometimes it's due to having the nails too long or maybe getting a nail caught in something.  I make sure to keep my budgies' and finches' nails are trimmed on a timely basis so that doesn't happen.  You can take them to your local petshop or to the vet for a trimming.  The petshop will save you money because the vet always charges more.  You can have them show you how to trim them if you'd like.  I think Bud will be fine and that he's not in any pain.  Budgies in pain usually willl favor a leg or bite the affected leg.  If that would happen, then a visit to the vet would be in order.|`|dpLjlnuLaa	it just sounds like its need to be cut, but to be sure get your local pet shop to check it out, (their much cheaper than a vet).|`|OyNJTWaiaa	Damaged claw as a baby....no big deal.

It covers everything you need to know to have your Aussie ready to step into the show ring.  If  you cannot find a copy, a video on grooming the sheltie or the rough collie should be pretty similar.<br>  <br>  If  you just want him to look presentable as a pet,  brush him daily with a pin brush during shedding season and use a teflon coated undercoat rake to really pull the fluff out.  On a pet Aussie that has a great deal of coat I trim a "poop path" so he doesn't soil the fur of his rear.  I keep a pair of guillotine clippers to trim the nails (and a jar of stypic powder just in case).  As long as you keep up on the brushing  you probably won't have to worry about cutting  out or untangling mats.<br>  <br>  It's actually a great bonding time between you and your Aussie.  Most love to be brushed and will readily flop belly up to be brushed there also!  If you pair the clippers with a treat each time, you can train them to like nail trimming time.  It's also a great opportunity to go over him with your hands and quickly discover if he has painful burrs,  hot spots, or other lumps and bumps.|`|uqSbj8WQaa	I grew up with Aussies and their coats don't require excessive amounts of maintenance however, you have to brush them fairly often and trim their coats down.  If you don't their coats will clump up and mat up and it is a mess to straighten out.  We bought shears for ours and sheared their coats down every so often (especially around their hindquarters). They need bathed about as often as any other dog would.  Its fairly simple stuff, even shearing them down (although they may look a little goofy until you get the hang of it) is pretty simple and a groomer isn't required.  I don't know what the cost of a groomer would be if you wanted to go that direction, however I couldn't imagine that it would be that expensive or that your trips would be that frequent.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Brush the Aussie's coat weekly, perhaps more often during shedding season, to prevent matting. Before you start brushing, spritz the coat with a dog hair conditioner diluted with water to detangle.

There are 15 dogs born for every 1 human and there are 45 cats born for every one human. See why spaying and neutering pets is so important? We could really reduce the number of healthy pets euthanized every year.|`|LL3pUzKgaa	simple there are a lot more stray cats then dogs. cats breed alot more frequently than dogs. and not many people want to adopt a feral cat. it is very sad because alot of these cats are great pets.

We get in contact with millions of germs every day, and our immune system takes care of it. If we also take some hygiene measures, mostly washing ourselves, there is no problem. I kiss my animals all the time, but make sure to wash my face and hands often. That is enough to protect  you.|`|a841c5ab77bb35fb792282f811028661aa	oh gawd, i am so guilty of kissing and cuddling my pets...ferrets, cats, dogs, etc. i drive my daughter crazy. i don't think you can get a disease from swallowing a hair. but there are diseases and parasites you can get from animals that are not properly vaccinated and/or dewormed. stay away from kissing them directly on the mouth...saliva, etc. and you should be okay. vaccinate and deworm too.|`|gzwdEZcMaa	i see my pets as my baby so of course id kiss mine if i had a kid id kiss it so whats different about my pets|`|5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	I wouldn't let an animal lick my face, but that's just because it's a bit gross, not because I'm afraid of getting a disease.<br>  I always kiss my mum's cats and kissed my boyfriend's dog the other day.

AraBfesHaa	Since you have 4 mollies, if any of them are female, don't get any more fish.  You'll be overrun by mollies in the near future.  They are livebearers and will have up to 80+ fry in each batch (though their first batch is normally smaller), and each batch will come every 4 weeks or so after one mating, up to 6 months.  <br>  And that's just with ONE female.  Do the math if you have more than one.<br>  Mollies also prefer brackish water and stay healthier in it.|`|6979bf0ecfe9ee379c6d4efa120ff381aa	No , this sounds good you could have 2 angelfish .

jQpTKq3waa	DOBERMAN FOR CERTAIN!!!!<br>  I've owned both, my boxer was way to hyper and knocked over the kids all the time, but my dobermans are wonderful couch potatoes, great with my 8 yr son and 2 yr old daughter.  They are watchful and as active as I am.  I never have to worry about anyone snatching my kids out of the yard, just the mere presence of the Dobermans is enough to keep people away.  When visitors come over the Dobermans are like any other dog to welcome guests and when unwelcome guests invade my home (happened only once) the dobermans turn in dogs I thought I would never recognize.<br>  <br>  Not to mention the water mess, the boxer drinks and just leaves puddles all over the place they are just really sloppy drinkers.  On the other hand, the doberman is much more elegant and noble in that fashion.<br>  <br>  With any dog, it's important to research the breed and breeder.  It's the up-most importance to make certain you receive a well socialized pet, that is a mark of a good breeder.  Both my dobermans I purchased from a great breeder and I couldn't have asked for better family members. Both puppies came to me well socialized and easy to handle. Both my dobermans attended obedience training and were at the top of their classes and went on to get their CGC, advanced obedience.  The point is that they are easily trainable and eager to learn, according to my breeder this is typical of the dogs she sells.<br>  <br>  Good luck at choosing you next family pet, I hope it's a Doberman.|`|tbuNZqJsaa	Well, i have a puppy doberman named Steel.. (just wanted to say that)<br>  <br>  Usually guard dogs like that are only loyal to their owner, so if you have kids or even your family comes around to visit, things might get pretty dangerous..<br>  I chose a doberman because their slimmer then Boxers and when it gets hot the boxer gots hotter quicker, especially with the black hair too.<br>  Dobermans also look more 'chic' too me. Try and picture yourself standing next to your full gorwn puppy boxer, then picture yourself with full grown Doberman..<br>  I thinkDobermann suits the picture more   :0<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|UXuSI6EZaa	if you're looking for a guard dog, a doberman would be the right choice. however it looks like you're getting a pup for a pet, one you'd keep for life. a boxer would be a better choice as it's a tamer breed compared to a doberman. good luck|`|YB3ULPPeaa	Boxers are fantastic!

I love their playful personalities and how they always act like puppies. There's a saying that says "Once you go Boxer, you never go back!" I think it's true for the most part as well! They're always there to be your best friend and won't mind you playing a few games with them. Not to mention they're such cuties. But, I don't own one because I live in Arizona so it's hot out, and they're smushed noses won't do well at all. They're much better for a cooler climate. They need a place where it isn't cold or hot, but instead has even temperatures near-round. Also, they need a lot of exercise so they aren't maniacs in the house. Like a good hour or two of extreme exercise before you can have a tired Boxer! <br>  <br>  I would choose a Doberman if I wanted more of a guard dog. They're great at protecting their owners if need be, but are great with kids at the same time. I love their personalities and how they can be extremely tough, or they can be childish. They do well in heat, but not so good in cold. Plus, they make excellent jogging companions! I would choose a Doberman over a Boxer if I wanted a dog to exercise with and feel confident that a stranger wasn't going to come up and do anything 'bad' to me, to put it nicely. He's also great if you have family. At night you can be rest assured that this dog has your home under safe guard! Plus, they'll be the kid's best friend! <br>  <br>  It really just depends on your lifestyle. I prefer the Boxer over the Doberman because of their silly anitcs, but I would be better suited for a Doberman in my lifestyle. (I like jogging, need a companion & protector, enjoy the feeling of safety). <br>  <br>  Good luck!

They are not a great community fish. I would go with something else to put in with your guppies. How about cory cats?|`|GIeGVJRmaa	This freshwater rainbow sharks originates in Thailand and may not be a good choice for a community tank. They like to stake out their own territory in the tank. This territory can be in the form of small caves, rocks and even plants. They will become aggressive with smaller fish that invade this territory. Only keep one Rainbow Shark in your tank because they will not tolerate another Rainbow or Red Tail Sharks in the same tank. They may exist together for awhile, but one will end up chasing the other relentlessly until the other succumbs. Rainbow sharks are usually known as semi-aggressive and guppy tails are often the target of aggressive and semi-aggressive fish.

f0eGFKN9aa	I wouldn't be worried that they haven't lost weight, in fact, I think its kudos to you (and their mum) for looking after them well! The weight drop that is generally seen is due to their new environment, and all the new allergens they're exposed to (this is also the reason that the mother's first milk is so important for their health). Weight loss may also occur due to the 'exercise' the pups get moving around outside the womb, plus the energy they expend to regulate temperature since they haven't had to before. So hopefully the reason the pups haven't lost weight, is because their immune systems and digestive tracts are working well!|`|AA11457471	Normal? No.<br>  Good news?

bepZupAfaa	did you take your new ferrets to the vet when you brought them home? <br>  <br>  most first vet visits will include a de-worming medication given. now that you have had all the ferrets together in the same cage you will need to medicate all of them.  even if you hadn't had them in one cage just them playing with each other they all need to be treated as a precaution. <br>  <br>  i'd take all 4 ferrets to the vet so he/she can treat all of them for worms.<br>  <br>  don't think there is a wormer on the market (over the counter) that i would trust to give without a vets ok. you will need to know exactly how much eash ferret weighs to do this.<br>  <br>  since all of your ferrets have been expose to the worms i don't think it is necessary to keep them seperated. <br>  <br>  once you have had them treated clean you cage with a bleach and water solution this should get rid of any chances of them getting re-infected.do your litter pans too but be prepared for them to miss the litter pans for a while cause you had to rid the pans of the lingering poo scent. i'd wash their bedding ie: hammocks and cuddle beds if you use them.  <br>  <br>  hope this helps and good luck

Ik6WOcw3aa	There is no reason for any fish to ever be in a bowl. Bettas do best in at least 2.5 gallons of heated and filtered water. 5 gallons is preferable. They need filters. And since they are also tropical, they need a heater. And bowls cannot provide room for either of them.<br>  <br>  Putting a tropical fish in a bowl is just cruel.

You also need to have a filter, though not a powerful one, as bettas become stressed when the current is too strong. Get a low-power sponge filter. Also, make sure you have a good substrate, with a lot of plants. Java Ferns will do well, though they do better when attached to driftwood, and anubias are also hardy and inexpensive plants. Plants are important, as they improve water quality. Remember to dechlorinate your water, preferably with AmQuel, and also use aquarium salt. Although bettas are freshwater, they do a lot better with some aquarium salt in their water (you can buy this product from most pet stores) and put 1/2 teaspoon of aquarium salt crystals per gallon. Also, use NovAqua when first putting in your betta fish into your tank; it is not necessary after that if you take good care of your fish. Before you put your betta into the tank, MAKE SURE IT IS CYCLED (for more info on this email me). You can use StressZyme to speed up the cycling process.<br>  <br>  Heaters are a necessity for bettas. Bettas are tropical fish, and the temperature should always be 80 degrees for their tank. Here is a water heater that is suitable for a 3-5 gallon: <a href="http://www.aquariumguys.com/miniheater.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquariumguys.com/miniheater.h...</a> Anything more than that would heat the water too much. Because you need a heater, you also need a thermometer, to make sure you are not overheating/underheating.<br>  <br>  Once the tank is cycled, and your betta is in there, then you should remember to feed him 1-2 times a day (2 is better) with approximately 4 betta pellets daily, though it depends a lot on the individual betta. Just feed him what he can eat in 3 minutes. Supplement his diet OCCASIONALLY with bloodworms as a treat. DO NOT OVERFEED!!! If you overfeed, the leftover food will rot, and the ammonia levels will skyrocket. If you cycled properly, though, ammonia and nitrite should not be much of a problem. Nitrate won't be a problem if you remember to do a 25% water change EVERY WEEK, which is very important when taking care of fish. Also, remember: bettas need a tank with a good substrate (like fine smooth gravel) and live plant(s), as well as a heater, and a filter! (But a low-power one, like a very small sponge filter.) Bettas do not need an aerator because they are anabantids (for more info on this email me). So every week, you need to do a 30% water change, using a gravel vacuum to clean out dangerous debris that will cause bacteria growth that must be removed. Here is an example of a gravel vacuum: <a href="http://www.petsolutions.com/default.aspx?ItemId=10811551&EID=SZ10811551&SID=SHZIL" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsolutions.com/default.aspx...</a><br>  Also, if you have a filter with a filter cartridge, remember that that must be cleaned every week, and replaced every month. This is just a basic overview of how to care for a betta. I suggest you do a lot of reading. With proper care, your betta will live a long and healthy life.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  ---fish guy|`|lbyX0GOJaa	this all depends on the type of fish u have because some fish need more space then others. if its a goldfish it would need at least 10gallons or more. tropical fish need lots of space. a 2 gallon is good enough for a japanese fighting fish.|`|dB3Gu0Ypaa	2 to 10 gallons but nothing smaller than two trust me also plants are good it makes Oxygen|`|25CAIGfeaa	Get a 5 gallon tank

I honestly hope they're not doing it for the money.. too many scumbags doing this already. <br>  Familiarize yourself/themselves with the breed and with all corresponding Cat association rules and guidelines. Have a dependable Veterinary who is willing to make house calls or one that is extremely well familiar with your breeds and their needs. stay away from commercial foods  and focus more on food high in protein and low in grain or grain free. Raw diets if feasible.

When keeping any reptile, a thermal gradient is essential for proper function.  Appropriate hide areas are another important factor when keeping jungles.  These two factors may also be combined to allow proper thermoregulation while in secure hidespots.  This is done by stacking inverted shallow wooden boxes on top of one another.  The boxes should have an entry hole in the side where the snakes can enter.  The box should be shallow enough to allow the snakes to feel like they are secure.  Stacking the boxes creates a temperature gradient where the top box is directly under a light bulb and the temperature decreases with lower levels.  In the cage pictured, the temperature under the bulb is around 110 F, the first box is around 90 F, the lower box is 85 F and the cage floor is 80 F.  This allows the snakes to choose a temperature for a given job.  After the snakes have eaten they will generally be found in the upper boxes and move to the lower after digestion is complete.  Giving the snakes the temperatures they need when they need them will provide the pythons with the tools they need for proper growth and development. <br>      <br>      Food is provided weekly.  My jungles will come partially out of the nest box when hungry and extend their neck in an S-shape position waiting for a meal to pass by.  Jungles will often be picky feeders, refusing rats and preferring mice, but if introduced to rats early on, may be converted to the larger food items.  Jungles also relish chicks.  I feed a few mice a week to each jungle.  Small food items are also more easily digested which means that the energy from mice will be more quickly converted to usable energy.  A large water bowl is also provided for water and will also allow for some humidity in the enclosure.  Fresh water is given frequently.  For some reason, jungle show an aversion to rats, and generally will require that a jungle keeper have plenty of mice on hand.<br>     <br>     I once had a male that refused food for around 4 months.  He was an adult and started losing weight.  I tried every trick in the book with frozen/thawed and live mice to no avail.  He was in a large cage with the female.  During cleaning of the cage, I put him in a holding bin that was much too small for his size.  He squeezed inside and when I went to check on him he gave me the hungry look.  I happened to have some mice nearby and threw one in.  He ate it immediately.  He ate three more in succession and I stopped with four to allow him to digest well.  After that, I never had any problems with that male regardless of the cage he was in.  I guess it just takes a kick start sometimes.  He turned out to be a great breeder, with no adverse effects from his prolonged fast.  Snakes need to feel secure before they will feel comfortable in the captive environment.  Make sure any snake that is kept has a hide area where they barely fit in and feel secure.  It's best when they can feel something on top of their body and feel like they can not be pulled out.  Make sure you don't mess with them inside their hide area, so they will continually feel this is a safe place (in their minds) and can go there and feel secure. <br>  <br>  Breeding Jungle Carpet Pythons <br>      When jungles are in proper health and appropriate size they may ready for breeding.  I have tried breeding jungles a couple of different ways and both resulted in an equal amount of success.  One pair was cooled and not fed for a couple months during the winter, after which, they were maintained normally and fed well.  The female from this pair laid a clutch of 8 eggs with one infertile egg for her first clutch.  The other pair was maintained at normal temps.  There was a normal nightly temp drop down to the high 70's, but higher temps were offered for the duration of the cool months.  This pair was also fed regularly and otherwise normally maintained (i.e., there was no special cooling or cycling performed).  The female from this pair also laid a normal healthy first clutch of 9 eggs, all of which were fertile.  The eggs from this pair were incubated artificially, as I had not prepared the cage for maternal incubation.  I had 100% hatch rate (excluding the one infertile egg) from both clutches. <br>      <br>      I keep all pairs together year round and they will occasionally be observed copulating during the cooler months.  The reason for keeping pairs together year round is that they will be able to determine the proper time for productive breeding and the females cycling will not be missed.  I think it gives a better chance at success, as the animals know things that I definitely don't.  I was a little worried the first few years, because I would only observe breeding infrequently, but I have found that productive breeding does not need to be long and drawn out, and generally when jungles breed for days or weeks at a time, it is non-productive and may waste the males ener|`|OJGHWczaaa	i like the link xan sent but there is one thing on it that i don't believe is right on it. it says that the difficulty level is BEGINNER! <br>  <br>  i strongly don't believe that. when i bought mine it was VERY nippy and took every strike it could. to get him the way he is now took months! <br>  <br>  they get anywhere from 5-7ft and need to have a regulated humidity and heat level.<br>  <br>  as babies they eat small mice/rats (whatever u want to start off with) and quickly move up to eating chicks and baby rabbits. <br>  <br>  these snakes r simi-arboreal they need large branches and logs to support their massive muscular strength. <br>  <br>  as adults they well need either a 55-60 gallon or a custom enclosure.<br>  <br>  hope i helped this is just what i had to find out on my own as time went on.|`|UZYT8eMwaa	Here is a god care sheet<br>   It is more in depth than most <br>  By no means comprehensive<br>  <a href="http://www.acreptiles.com/carpet_python_care.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.acreptiles.com/carpet_python_...</a>|`|niztxto9aa	This is a pretty spot on care sheet-<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newenglandreptile.com/CareCarpet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.newenglandreptile.com/CareCar...</a>
1Qh9i9cWaa	All the other adivce here is very good so far. I have a couple things to add. <br>  <br>  I add lots of plastic bushy plants (not grass).  Alternatively cross stich plastic (#7) works quite good for hiding babies if you have gravel (you don't need gravel in a guppy tank). Just make a pit in the rocks and put it over them. The mom will birth the kids & they will hide below the mesh before she can eat them. <br>  <br>  ditto the sponge filter. Guppy babies are stupid & some will get sucked up.<br>  <br>  I recommend cheap sinking shrimp pellets (like the ones for catfish) as food. They will condition your guppies to breed faster. Even the cheapest brands work. <br>  <br>  Increased temperature can speed up the breeding process, or at least their metabolism making the young ones age to breeding time faster. Maintaining a temp of 78 to 80 will keep things rolling. <br>  <br>  Adult guppies do well with a little aquarium salt. Your tank would be between 2-3 tablespoons. <br>  <br>  It only takes a couple months for the girls to be able to have babies, so you don't need much more than time. They will breed and multiply beyond the bounds of your 15 gallon tank soon enough.|`|tShDXmgbaa	You just got one of the easiest breeders on this planet as these guys spit babies out every 21 days and I can assure you if you brought them from a pet store....the females have already been hit by a male. Should that be the case your females will continue to drop fry every 21 days without ever touching a male for the next couple of months.  The only thing I would suggest you do is feed the girls some freeze dried foods such as bloodworms or brine shrimp.  The amount of fry the females have will increase over time if you give them more than just regular Tropical flakes.|`|LCIcUTwNaa	It's quite easy but you are going to need a male.Let them do their thing and you will notice when they are pregnant.

AA12279950	No no no no no.  It's really not a good idea.  Any reputable pet shop will tell you to keep them separately.  As a previous answer said - they do get attracted to each other in the 'wrong' way!  I was given a male rabbit and a female guinea pig who had been living together but the guinea pig was always crying and the rabbit constantly pestered the guinea pig.  When I asked for advice, I was told that the rabbit could break the guinea pigs legs if he tried to mount her.  What a horrible thought!  I had to get a separate cage for the guinea pig.<br>  <br>  Please don't keep them together x|`|JGq9rKBOaa	No, rabbits and guinea pigs shouldn't be kept together. People do it, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea. A few people saying, "It worked for me," don't make the risks any less significant.<br>  <br>  Rabbits have very strong hind legs, and show their dominance by mounting. Rabbits kick. An excited or territorial rabbit, even a small one, could seriously injure or kill a guinea pig. <br>  <br>  Also, their dietary needs are different. Both need fresh hay all day, and veggies, but guinea pigs need a pellet that has added vitamin C. Rabbit food can also contain antibiotics that aren't good for pigs. <br>  <br>  But above all, their SOCIAL needs are different. A guinea pig and a rabbit will not socialize like two rabbits or two guinea pigs. They're different species - looking similar does not make them relate to each other in the same way. It's like speaking a different language - rabbit social behaviors are different than guinea pig social behaviors. Even the way they interact with humans is different.<br>  <br>  I have a rabbit and three guinea pigs. The guinea pigs are caged, the rabbit sleeps in a pen at night and is free range during the day. He doesn't have access to the guinea pigs, but sometimes he sees them through the bars of the cage - and they don't even seem to recognize the other species as another animal. My rabbit has had more social interactions with my CATS than he has with my guinea pigs. The guinea pigs don't acknowledge his presence at all - they're too busy acting like GUINEA PIGS amongst themselves! <br>  <br>  Guinea pigs vocalize a lot. Rabbits do not. Rabbits have a "potty corner" (which, in pet rabbits, can easily be a litterbox). Guinea pigs are messy. When let out for 'floor time," guinea pigs play "follow the leader," which I've never seen in rabbits. Basically, what I'm saying is, even if they don't kill each other, they won't be as happy together as they would  if you housed them properly.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend choosing between either guinea pigs and rabbits. If you get guinea pigs, get multiples. Most female-female pairs work well, as do female-neutered male pairs. Often two males can be kept together, but they might need a little extra space. Even neutered males will fight over females, so never try to house multiple males around females. I have a neutered male and two girls, and it works great. <br>  <br>  For information on guinea pigs, check out these sites:<br>  <a href="http://www.guineapigcages.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcages.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cavyspirit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cavyspirit.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.guinealynx.info/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guinealynx.info/</a><br>  <br>  If you get a rabbit, I'd recommend starting out with either one or an adult bonded pair. If you get two babies, they'll need to be neutered/spayed, and that means you'll have to separate them at some point and then reintroduce them. I wouldn't recommend trying to introduce rabbits unless you've already kept rabbits long enough to understand a bit about their personalities and social behaviors. <br>  <br>  Try <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com/</a> when looking for rabbits (or guinea pigs) to adopt. Many shelters have rabbits and guinea pigs, and there are also specialized rescues. Rescue rabbits will usually already be neutered/spayed, and if you want two, you can usually find bonded pairs or trios.<br>  <br>  For more information on rabbits, check out <a href="http://www.rabbit.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabbit.org/</a><br>  <br>  For both rabbits and guinea pigs, make sure you read the parts of the sites about their PERSONALITIES - it'll give you a better chance of choosing the one right for you! They're very different as pets, despite similar appearances. Don't get a guinea pig expecting it to act like a rabbit with smaller ears - people who do that are often the ones who label guinea pigs "boring."|`|vwC7klVVaa	No they are two different speices and need different dietry needs.

D5wZLk6faa	As long as the male is courting her meaning flaring his fins at her then he is ready. If the environment is not right then the male could very well have tried to make one but the bubbles pop. Is there humidity in the tank? What is the temperature? I need a little more information. Also if you have put a water stone in there it will prevent the bubble nest from forming despite the males best efforts.<br>  <br>  If she has vertical lines then she is ready. If he is courting her then you can release her with the male. If the environment is right he will begin building the bubble nest. It can take 4 - 5 days for them to actually mate. Give me a little more information.<br>  <br>  **For breeding purposes set the temperature around 80 degrees not to exceed 85 degrees. Also make sure the tank has a lid or is covered with plastic wrap to keep humidity in so the fry don't get sick when they "hatch."|`|upNfdhz9aa	if the male is showing off in front of the female, then you can let her out.

zqVDJxUIaa	Most snails eat anything that is on the bottom of the tank, or attached to the sides.They eat algae, uneaten flake food, and other microscopic organisms. There's no need to feed them, and you might harm your tank by doing do because the excess food will cause ammonia buildup. Don't worry about your snail, my snails periodically crawl into the shells and lay still  :)<br>  Snails are way easier to care for than fish, if you can manage fish then you can certainly manage snails. Snails like live plants as well.<br>  Snails will find food if you don't give food.<br>  Good luck!|`|XAsR6uPvaa	Hmmm<br>  <br>  I'm assuming its an Apple(Mystery) Snail?<br>  Its the most common snail sold at stores for freshwater tanks.<br>  <br>  Snails can get inactive at some points.<br>  They are supposed to be most active at night, although the big snails that i got move around all the time, but their activity does increase at night time.<br>  <br>  Dont move it around, dont worry if its "upside down" on the bottom of tank. They usually flip this way due to most of their weight being at the center/back of shell and because of their lungs being near the top/entrance to the shell.<br>  <br>  If it makes you feel any better, remember where it is at right now, then tomorow after you wake up see if he has moved around. <br>  <br>  Also,<br>  if you are worried about what they eat and if they have enough, well, they eat anything thats available.<br>  From regular uneatten fish foods that goes to the bottom, or algae in your tank.<br>  <br>  But if you would like to take on a more direct feeding method, buy them Algae Wafers.<br>  Just drop an algae wafer (or a piece of one since your snail is small at the moment) and it will eat it.<br>  Takes them a while, but they will eat it. (they love them <3)|`|OblSdMaaaa	No feeding required.  They will feed off any algae and stuff on the gravel, glass, decorations, plants, etc.|`|f8RBtCVAaa	its just a new tank mine did the same thing and it feeds off of algae and flake food that's at the bottom. they will survive better than i fish.
jpI3EfGpaa	I hope you take your poor cat to a Vet as soon as possible.  10 isn't that old for a cat.   Could be a bad infection or something and cats love to keep themselves clean and if your cat is smelly well something is definitely wrong.  Please take her to a Vet.  She may even have broken something.  Worming tablets might be the last thing she needed if she is feeling sick.  Please do the right thing by your cat.  No-one can diagnose her problem on this site.  It would just be guess-work.|`|Ka3fbxszaa	I think you need to check with a vet asap. It sounds like she is reacting to the dewormer.

RPTwjyjIaa	Huskies are great dogs....for the right owner. If you have done lots of research and still think this is the dog for you and are just looking for opinions from people who own them then great. If not please research them. <br>  <br>  As for the kind of dog they are and how much work is involved here is my opinion from owning a Husky mix (seems to take after the husky quite a bit). They are very intelligent dogs and need lots of mental stimulation. Mine learned to open the gate latch by four months and the fridge by two years. They need someone who knows dogs. They are not happy if no one is leader so they will step up if you cannot. They do shed a lot so you have to be prepared to brush and vacuum extra. They do require good exercise or they can become overweight and bored. They tend to be vocal, mine will talk to me (or talk back if I am scolding him).  They need to have very secure fencing as they love to wander and will if they get out. They are not one to just hang around your house and they are master escape artist. Mine got a microchip when he was neutered. On the plus side they can be very loving and are fantastic dogs. They will do fine with people (my dog thinks people were put on earth to pet him), other dogs (he is always up for a play date), and cats (we have two) if raised with them and sociolized (very important). They are smart, loving, happy, energetic dogs. I have been lucky enough to have two fantastic husky mixes in my life. One when I was a kid and one now. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped. :)|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Number 1; A husky dog isn't for a 16year old! They need experience dog owner!  They are NOT for the NOVICE, inexperience dog owners, i think i would wait a little or think if easy dog beed for 1st time owner.<br>  <br>  Number 2; Huskys are EXTREME energy-THEY REQUIRE 2KM DAILY WALKS-TWICE A DAY TOTALLING A MINIMUM OF 4KM -They Need a LARGE yard, 6 feet+ fence, and LOADS of mental and physical exercise. <br>  <br>  Number 3; Puppy need you to be with him most of the day, MAX time a puppy should be left on it own is 2hours. I doubtful they'll you'll be home. 1year old dogs can be left alone on their own MAX 8HOURS.<br>  <br>  Who should own this breed?<br>  This fun loving, affectionate, outgoing, breed requires an experienced, committed, stable owner that has educated themselves well on this breed's needs. Siberian owners should be aware of this dog's amazing natural abilities and desires. They should also know that those abilities and desires, if not channeled and use will become a problem. The Siberian Husky attracts a lot of people because of it's beauty. They are also adorable puppies and win people's hearts in an instant. Many uneducated, puppy smitten owners soon find out this is not the breed for everyone. This is a fantastic, but very specialized breed that requires a special owner to be successful.<br>  <br>  Siberian Huskies are high energy. Always look to a dogs historical roots and modern jobs for insight. These dogs were originally bred to run in sub zero temperatures for long distances and still do. Their endurance and desire to go is not the correct match for the average pet owner. But for many Siberian owners, this breed becomes a lifelong passion of the heart and they would own no other.<br>  They need the company of other dogs or of people at all times. If you work all day, or have room for only one dog, don't get a Siberian. Loneliness for this breed equals TROUBLE. A lonely Siberian Husky will display a full spectrum of undesirable behaviors.<br>  <br>  <br>  Siberian Huskies have a pretty common trait for digging holes in backyards. If you take great pride in your landscaping efforts, a Siberian is not for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  While capable of strong affection for his family, the Siberian Husky is also very friendly with strangers and make poor watch dogs. A Siberian will not alert his owner to strangers. They are usually pretty happy to see just about everyone. Which I see as a positive for the Siberian. An owner is not bothered with irritating barking every time someone enters or passes by his property.<br>  <br>  <br>  The breed in general is not good with: Cats or any small animals, rodents, birds or fowl, because of their prey drive instinct. There are of course exceptions, but don't count on it. If you desire to have or currently own such pets do not get a Siberian Husky.<br>  <br>  <br>  Siberian Huskies are vocal. They rarely bark, but will whine, or moan, and also chirp and howl. Head held high, they will produce one of the most haunting song like sounds. Now this Siberian song fest may be music to the ears of a Siberian and the Siberian Husky fancier, but the neighborhood may not agree.<br>  <br>  <br>  Siberian Huskies shed a lot. When they blow coat in the spring it is a lot like a doggie hair storm. Brushing helps and you can speed the shedding up with a warm bath. But if you don't like fur all over the house, the car, the furniture and if you don't want to match you wardrobe to you dogs coat color, you don't want to get a Siberian.<br>  <br>  <br>  Siberian Huskies need a lot of exercise. They have a high endurance level and need a owner that wants to keep up with them. Huskies love to do what they were bred for, so being involved in Siberian Husky sledding, carting and other events or breed clubs is a plus for the dog and the owner. Obedience and agility are also good outlets and activities for the Siberian Husky and owner. They can make good walking/running partners, if the weather is not to warm.<br>  <br>  <br>  Siberian Huskies have a tremendous desire to RUN. But the very first dash that a puppy makes could be it's last. These dogs should never be allowed to run at large. They face too many hazards in today's world: Cars, other dogs, guns, poison, antifreeze. In addition, they can come in contact with diseases: Parvo, distemper, corona, parasites. The clever Siberian Husky can surely add to that list, easily. They also have a strong prey drive. A gentle family Siberian Husky, at large can inflict, death or injury to livestock, fowl, cats, and wildlife. These mis-adventures could cost you some time in court , large sums of money and ultimately cost your dog, it's life. A Siberian, for their own protection, should be kept confined or under control at all times.<br>  <br>  <br>  Siberians are escape artists. Some can be contained in 6 foot fencing. Others can clear an 8 foot fence like they have wings. Most Siberian Huskies require completely enclosed kennels to keep them where they are safe when they are not being supervised. Each Siberian Husky varies, but in general this breed is a lot of work to contain. The Siberian is the "Houdini escape artist" of the dog world.<br>  <br>  Siberian Husky<br>  Providing enough exercise. Siberian Huskies MUST have regular opportunities to vent their energy. Otherwise they will become rambunctious and bored -- which they usually express by howling and destructive chewing. Bored Siberian Huskies are famous for chewing through drywall, ripping the stuffing out of sofas, and turning your yard into a moonscape of giant craters.<br>  <br>  Unless you specifically want an athletic dog for sledding, carting, backpacking, or other outdoor-related activities, preferably in a cool climate, I do not recommend this breed. Siberian Huskies were never intended to be simply pets. Trying to suppress their "hardwired" drive to work, without providing alternate outlets for their energy, can be difficult <br>  <br>  If you have small children, or if you or anyone who lives with you is elderly or infirm, I do not recommend Siberian Husky puppies. The temptation to play roughly is too strong in many young Siberian Huskies<br>  <br>  Stubbornness. Siberian Huskies are not Golden Retrievers. They have an independent mind of their own and are not pushovers to raise and train. They can be manipulative, and many are willful, obstinate, and dominant (they want to be the boss) and will make you prove that you can make them do things. You must show them, through absolute consistency, that you mean what you say.<br>  <br>  Frankly, most Siberian Huskies are "too much dog" for the average household. Very few people can provide the types of athletic activities that keep this breed satisfied.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	Let me ask you...what are you looking for in a pet dog?  I am talking specifically, what exactly are you looking for in regards to exercise, grooming, temperament, etc.<br>  <br>  Answer me those questions...then I will post my opinion of the husky breed.  Trust me, I know them well.  I was owned by a very typey ***** for 14 years.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Yes puppies are very time consuming and a lot of work.  If you are only 16 you are still in school and I doubt that the puppy will get the socialization or time it will need during his growing years.  Who will house train the dog, or teach him general manners and socialization skills?  If you are in school for 8 hours a day, who is going to be at the house to take the puppy out every 30 minutes or so to go to the bathroom and to walk and play with him.  Sorry but you need to wait until you will have more time to spend with the dog.|`|3YMETqStaa	Huskies are a LOT of work!  They stay puppies for about 2 years, need excessive amounts of exercise, a cooler climate, do best with a big yard(in my opinion with another dog), and need to be consistently trained from the moment the come home.  If you can handle all of that then Huskies are magnificent and beautiful dogs that if I didn't live in an apartment in Southern California would own in a second.<br>  <br>  I do not suggest on for someone your age.  Research a lot of different dog breeds to determine which fits your lifestyle best.  Do not base a dog on appearance because you will love your dog unconditionally.|`|53giV6PFaa	They do require quite bit of work.  They shed heavily or commonly called "blowing their coat" at least 2 times a year.  It's a lot of shedding.  Mine is going through it right now for the first time, and it is pretty bad.  You just have to groom and clean daily.<br>  <br>  Another thing is that they are very high-energy dogs.  If they don't get enough exercise they will be destructive.  They are also very smart dogs and are escape artist.  So make sure you have a really good enclosed yard for them.  We had to chase our pup down many times when he found some way to slip under the fence, etc. <br>  <br>  Even with all the work, I wouldn't trade my pup in for anything.  He's a really good dog.  You just have to be consistent and firm on the training.|`|1XLZdOcQaa	Getting any dog would really mean a lot of work (not to mention lots of vet  bills).

tMtBe1lKaa	Chihuahuas came from Mexico, so they are pretty far south. I'm pretty sure they would have them in Alabama. My grandmas toy poodle does the reverse caugh also, and she travels everywhere without any more problem than she has at home. Like you said, it is more about excitement. Does she have pollen allergies where you live or get worse in the spring? I wouldn't worry if she doesn't seem to. Chihuahuas are known for thier high anxiety and protecting thier owners, so if she is easily excited, you may not want to take her. I'd judge it by how anxious she is with strangers and travelling. good luck and enjoy your trip.|`|KqmBYTuNaa	Is that one of them little bitty fancy dawgs?

d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	it depends how long you are away for.there are ways to keep your fish fed,such as an automatic fish feeder. this fits on top of your tank and releases a set amount of food [this depends how much you load it with].there are vacation blocks which release food as the solution it is in disolves,or you can put live food such as dafnia-or bloodworm before you go away and it is there when they want it.in the wild no one feeds them and they browse on algae or plant live until a meal comes along.healthy fish can survive ok for an amazing length of time so if its a week or so there should be no problem.there is always bits in a tank.<br>   hope this is of help|`|yczbg2pKaa	only get the blocks if there are a bunch of fish   but if not the a auto fish feeder you can choose how much and how many times a day to feed fish i just have my dad feed them when im gone|`|OzK10hKxaa	Fish are fine not being fed for a week.

There's a few options.|`|FrTRmSzvaa	First of all, what I would do would be get a time relieve feeder and get it to feed them.

zqVDJxUIaa	This description is rather vague, but I'm quite sure it fits the description <br>  of a Serpae Tetra. The body of the Serpae tetra is tall and compressed and can reach a size of 1.5 inches (4 centimetres). The shades vary from a orangey color to reddish brown. The red body is decorated with a black comma-shaped mark that is found right behind the gill cover. Some Serpae tetra specimens have a very small marking or have no marking at all. As your Serpae tetra grows older, the marking will grow smaller. The anal fin, ventral fins and tail are all red, and the anal fin is fringed with black and white layers. The dorsal fin of the Serpae tetra is tall and black, and has a thin white fringe. This fringe can sometimes have a reddish hue. <br>  <br>  Also, It could be a red wagtail platy (which is orangey red) Look up both on the internet, and I'm sure one might be it.<br>  -Serpae Tetra<br>  -Red Wagtail Platy<br>  -Or maybe a kind of small goldfish...|`|pcvcMePXaa	A picture would help determine what kind of fish this is its hard to tell by a description
hQQuqyYcaa	It's best to have a male and 2 females when it comes to platies. If you get two, make sure both are females because males tend to pick on each other sometimes. As far as I know, they aren't schooling fish. Mainly tetras, danios, and barbs are schooling fish, not livebearers.|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	No, platys are not schooling fishes.

0Gyrecxxaa	When you put two Cockatiels together, even in the same room and even if they're the same sex, they can bond to one another. This is why they have no use for you. Chances are they won't breed unless you provide a next box but there are exceptions.<br>    I don't think wanting another bird is selfish at all. I have a lot more than two I assure you.

yNiad3lAaa	I have a male pug and my mom has one male and 3 girls, they all have similar personalities, my male doesn't pee in the house or anything but my mom's male is terrible about lifting his leg on everything. Her girls are very playful and sweet, so I would probably go with a girl, just because of the marking. I love my Cooper and wouldn't trade him for anything he is the best dog ever, he loves to play, swim & ride in the car.

Mzvp1LPFaa	Possible?  Absolutely.  As for appearance, that would depend on which genes dominated, or if you had codominance.  I'm sure the shape of the Pit's head would modify the needle nose of the collie.   I have seen an AmStaff x Belgian malinois used as a police K9.  In physique malinois are similar to collies, though not needle nosed.  The dog looked like a malinois but was much more heavily muscled and not quite as tall.|`|nFcl0BOsaa	It would look a lot like either breed or anything in between.

hKVOw1Sjaa	At this age it should be weaned off mUm and having proper food although l must admit there have been times when a litter which is small to be weaned although still have the occasional slurp from Mum.<br>  If the pups are actually having proper food constipation can  and does happen and at the practice l work for and l must admit an old remedy l use as l hate giving pups this young anything les is a few drops of paraffin oil.l have no idea where you buy it in your Country but l buy it from the pharmacy.read the instructions carefully you do not want to overdo it and it is only one or two drops.if this pup still has not passed anything then try some non lactose  milk to get it going again.l have found over all the years of breeding this does occasionally occur and usually not a worry but you can ring and ask your vet and if he or she is an old hand they will recommend what use.By the way have you wormed the pups yet?They need to be done at 2 weeks and then every 2 weeks after that until 12 weeks of age.That may be your issue  as you have not really given enough info for the site to help you.|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	go to the vet or ask the vet to come out to see the pup?<br>  if the other pups are OK, then im not sure what can be wrong?<br>  is the tummy really big?<br>  puppies need to be wormed from age of 4 weeks,after is every 10 days:some pups have tons of worms.<br>  they get it from the mothers milk.<br>  its OK, all pups have worms.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	Constipated or something doesn't really describe what is going on with the puppy but yes...if it is constipated at 4 and a half weeks old there is something seriously wrong with it as it shouldn't be constipated if it is just drinking from its mother. There is no food for it to be constipated with only liquid. You need to take it to the vet and they probably all need to be wormed.|`|7be554591e8c040c7b5bfa762a5a2560aa	Constipated...or something.  I don't know what the question is.  But  I don't know how you could possibly tell if one of them were constipated. If they are  still w/the mother...there is NO  way to tell.<br>   Since you cannot watch them  24/7,  you cannot possibly know if the pup  goes  or doesn't.  I could easily have pooped somewhere and you just didn't see it.  <br>  If you haven't wormed  yet...you might want to do it immed.  and then every 2 wks after til  12 wks.   So  what is the question?   I would be happy to try to answer it.
AA10270018	Yes, betta sleep at night so the light should be off.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	It's best to turn the light out at night. Fish don't exactly sleep like you and I do (no eyelids), but they do rest.

They do just die like that sometimes and it doesn't necessarily mean that there is a disease in your pond
1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	I would suggest training them to come to a whistle or squeaky toy. I don't hunt with mine, but have trained mine to, and have talked to hunters. They say it saves a lot of time if they learn that a whistle means food and they come out of the burrow instead of sleeping, with you having to wait.   <br>      I would also suggest getting them used to eating the types of prey they will find - in a couple weeks, give them some small, easy to kill, mice for food (at this age, maybe just pinkies or slightly older), and work your way up. I tried to feed my ferrets mice, and one would kill it and eat the skin, but not the meat. He killed it with instinct because he was a year old and never had to kill before. The others wouldn't touch the mouse.<br>       I have not hunted with ferrets, but it seems like it would be a good way to train them- as people train their dogs the same way.|`|pDSde3qdaa	With our ferrets we found they pretty much work on instinct.  They are super smart creatures and comprehend rather fast.
3BMBZtDxaa	Just call your local animal control. I would suggest the Humane Society since they make a more practical approach. Your actual animal control may ignore the complaint, euthanize the dog, or drop it in the pound. No of which are good!<br>  <br>  I wouldn't go to your neighbors first because then they would know you called. Just ring up animal control and explain that your neighbor has a dog that they let roam off-leash without supervision and you're concerned for the dog's safety. Add that you don't want a fight to break out with your dogs and you're concerned for your dog's health because it appears that the dog has mange as well. State that you would like to stay annonymous. They will take care of the rest!<br>  <br>  Honestly, if your neighbors are letting him off-leash by a busy road and he looks like he has mange, they don't care! For all we know they're using the home treatment method of dumping gasoline on the dog and he could suffer later on down the road. It's best just to stay out of it and get the authorities involved who can assess the situation and properly take care of it. By you stepping in it'll just cause a fight between you and your neighbor. I've heard of angry neighbors poisoning their neighbor's dogs! So don't chance it.<br>  <br>  If worst comes to worst and animal control doesn't fix the problem, drop on by your neighbor's house. Do not bring up the mange thing or treatment, but just suggest having their dog on a lead when outside. Tell them your dog is dominant and you don't want any fights to happen. Just say that and be polite and leave. The less information you give up, the less likely they'll be to connect the dots. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|nFcl0BOsaa	Anonymously report seeing a dog out loose that it had sores on its body. Give the address of the house you saw it at. Just decline to give your name.|`|AA10953999	Just call animal control. It's better to remain anonymous than have them start crap with you.|`|32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	call animal control and tell them what you're telling us<br>  maybe it will get hit by a car and that would take care of things|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Just call animal control with an anonymous complaint/concern and if the neighbours mention anything either own up to it or say that you had nothing to do with it. Between now and when you call them and the time they come and after it just act the same as you usually would. If you go around acting differently than they'll suspect. Or play the 'oh, wait happened i seen animal control at your house yesterday' line. Tends to make people turn the eye off you. Used to do it with the people across the road who mistreated a pitbull years back. They used to voice their opinion to us about how the stupid old so and so up the back probably dobbed them in. Wasnt nice on my behalf but it worked. That dog was trained and respected like a queen after the RSPCA call we made.|`|ZzUQ8Rn2aa	i agree with chimney and laughing the most :)|`|tMtBe1lKaa	It's a tough one.  As far as the health goes, if you know the neighbor, maybe just ask about the dog's health. It may have flea allergies that aren't reacting to treatment, or be a hairless variety. At least you would know.<br>  As far as the fencing goes, I would likely neighbors to talk to each other first, if you think they're reasonable people. Or drop off a run line and stake anonymously on thier door step. :) a friendly hint. This is only because Animal control doesn't follow up on health issues unless there are multiple complaints or the disease is communicable- i.e. rabies. They issue a warning the first time, and after a second complaint they charge fines. Often the dog ends up in the pound or euthanized by the second offense because the fines are so large (in our area anyway). But if the neighbors care for thier animal, they need to show it, and if you think them unreasonable, calling animal control will get the dog behind a fence one way or another.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	The humane society has to be called no way around it. best wishes.

ixFbNr4taa	You got to model and train the correct behavior.  So line up some friends to come over and have them do exactly what you ask of them.<br>  <br>  Here's a good article -- I'm going to cut & paste some of it -- but the whole thing is on the web......<br>  <br>  Some dogs are prone to urinating when excited. Greetings are a common time when this situational incontinence occurs in dogs, but simple training can stop the accidents.<br>  <br>  Some dogs exude a feeling of extreme excitement and happiness, especially during greetings. The excitement is visible in the dog's eyes, it's evidenced by the dog's body language and by the puddle of urine on the floor. Yes, some dogs are prone to something called excitement urination, an involuntary loss of bladder control in dogs who are extremely excited.<br>  <br>  Situational incontinence and urination due to excitement in dogs can be a messy and frustrating problem for dog owners to deal with, but a few simple dog training methods and some changes in routine on the humans' end can remedy the dog's tendency to urinate when excited.<br>  <br>  Why Does My Dog Urinate When Excited?<br>  Extreme emotion can elicit some powerful physical responses - adrenaline rushes through the blood stream, there's changes in muscle tone, the heart rate hastens. A loss of bladder control in dogs is one physical response that's commonly seen in a dog who's experiencing intense emotion, usually fear or excitement.<br>  <br>  Dogs who experience extreme excitement to the point where involuntary urination occurs tend to be dogs who experience very high "highs" and very low "lows." Dogs who become incontinent and urinate when excited tend to be submissive and less confident by nature; this promotes excitement urination because the dog lacks the ability to maintain a steady emotional state on his own. Instead he looks to humans and outward sources for confidence and happiness, leading to a great fluctuation in mood, with very high "highs" and very low "lows."<br>  <br>  How Do I Stop My Dog from Urinating When Excited<br>  A dog who urinates when he's excited does not do so intentionally - it's an involuntary action that's beyond his control. Therefore, a dog's excitement urination problem is not a traditional behavioral problem like housebreaking where the dog can be trained to stop urinating at a certain time and place.<br>  <br>  The key to resolving a dog's tendency to urinate when excited involves lessening the amount of extreme excitement that the dog experiences through changes in human habits and through boosting the dog's confidence level.<br>  <br>  Step One: Boost the Dog's Confidence Level<br>  A dog who is confident will be better equipped to regulate his emotional state. Confidence in a dog helps him to remain mentally stable, without the extreme fluctuations in mood that are seen in dogs who lack confidence. Dogs who lack confidence tend to rely on humans for happiness and a sense of well-being, so when the dog's human family members are not present, the dog's mood dips into feelings of anxiety and unhappiness. A confident dog will have a more stable mood and he'll be less apt to become incontinent when excited.<br>  <br>  The most effective way to increase a dog's confidence level is through training. Obedience training provides the dog with an opportunity to interact with the owner in a positive way where the dog learns a command and then receives a reward for performing the command. Three or four ten-minute training sessions per day are the simplest and most effective ways to improve a dog's confidence.<br>  <br>  Notably, improving a dog's confidence level will also help to resolve issues stemming from submission. Submissive urination is a separate, but related problem and many dogs who urinate as an act of submission will also urinate when excited.<br>  <br>  Step Two: Make Exciting Events Less Exciting<br>  Greetings are the most common time for excitement urination. Therefore, family members and guests must work to make the greetings less remarkable for the dog.<br>  <br>  When returning home, verbally acknowledge the dog in a calm voice, but avoid physical contact. Physical contact such as petting during a greeting can send a dog's excitement level through the roof, leading to involuntary urination on the dog's part. Use of an excited voice should also be avoided, as the dog picks up on this as a cue that says "This is a time to get excited!"<br>  <br>  Once the initial excitement of the family member or guest's arrival has waned - usually after five to ten minutes - it is acceptable to physically pet the dog for a physical greeting.<br>  <br>  Meal times are another time where a dog's excitement is high. Feeding more frequently with three or four small meals per day will help the dog to feel less hungry, which will remove some of the excitement. Preparing the meal and putting the food down when the dog is not present is another way to eliminate some of the excitement that's associated with the anticipation of the meal.<br>  <br>  These measures should resolve problems of excitement urination in the vast majority|`|AIol5omUaa	when plp walk in have them ignore her! it sound mean but it works<br>  she pees becuz she is so excited<br>  if no one gives her attetion until she calms down it will solve the problem trust me just walk by like she isnt there<br>  it sounds mean but once she sees she doesent get attetion right away she will stop gettin so excited and stop peeing|`|A5keqH5Aaa	That sounds like terror; I think you are asking the wrong question. <br>  Unless it's excitement.<br>  <br>  I would say unless you have specifically trained this in some way then it is an extreme emotion.<br>  Have you given positive reinforcement when she does it or is it the only way she gets attention?<br>  <br>  I’d guess;<br>  You need to figure out what the emotion is that is causing her to do this and then stop it from being such an extreme. <br>  If it is joy then I would suggest opening the door and calling her out without you entering. Cause joy at seeing you is a good thing and what she should feel when you come home. <br>  If it is terror though you need to figure out what you and other people are doing to cause it. <br>  <br>  Is her tail waging or is it down?<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  So many possible reasons so, so many ways that -could- work.|`|IEsudy2xaa	i have a jrt and she did the same thing igot alot of stick from people saying it was nerves also asking was there anyone at home scaring her i have three dogs one a yorkie bobby age 5 molly jrt age 4 and a puppy yorkie 14 weeks ihave dogs all my life but molly was the first i rescued and my first jack russel she is the most loveable dog and very clean in the house but still at times if she gets excited she might dribble i just ask people when they come to the door not to pay her to much attention and that helps a lot also dogs that bring things to you that is there way of bringing you presents to show they want to please you just show her love she will learn all the best|`|lXrDFWqDaa	my dog does the same thing i dont no if you can do much about it but when anyone comes over we just get our dog to greet the outside so she can just pee out there instead of inside

Yq2MWKMeaa	Such a cutie!  Little Yorkie babies can be very timid.  Since she is a year old already you will need to have patience and commitment in training her.  I thought I would go crazy trying to train our little female to go outside.<br>  <br>  I started by taking her outside every hour on the hour - I'd say "outside" and we'd go.  I'd walk around with her ... slowly walk around with her and watch her actions.  If she even looked like she was looking for a spot to do her thing, I'd stop and wait.  If she did, then she'd get a verbal praise, some petting and a treat.  Then, we'd go back inside.  I'd watch her while we were inside and if she even looked like she was looking to go, I'd swoop her up and take her outside to do the slow walk, watch and wait.<br>  <br>  This went on for a couple of weeks, then I went to every hour and a half and the watch while we were inside.  This went on for six weeks.  After a while, she started coming up to me and I'd say "Do you wanna go outside?"  She'd get excited and we'd go do the slow walk, watch and wait ... praise, pet and treat.<br>  <br>  When she started coming to me, we put her in a crate at night and she'd make it through the night without any accidents.  After 4 months more of crating at night, she was allowed to sleep outside her crate.<br>  <br>  Since then, we only had a few accidents when I wasn't paying attention to her asking to go outside.  Now, whenever she comes up to me, I always ask her if she wants to go outside ... sometimes she does and other times she just wants to be held.  When accidents happened, I'd just clean them up and use Nature's Miracle - NEVER EVER any hitting, yelling or smushing of the face in the boo boo.  I'd just put her outside and clean it up.<br>  <br>  No accidents since ...  Good Luck  =}|`|VT0YGdK2aa	go to petco or petsmart for some training.  or just get a schedule set up pee outside every hour or two and wean her to less pee breaks.  reward when done right|`|iIPDAgXJaa	This is a very common question and the answer is simple...boundaries. First rule if you don't see her do it you cannot punish her, sticking her nose in it will not make her remember doing it. A dog has a very short memory of only a few seconds. A crate is the best way to teach her. Use a crate that has a divider. First you give her only enough room to stand up turn around and lay down (Yes, we are going back to training a puppy) but make sure it is comfortable and throw in some familiar toys. As soon as she eats or drinks (which should be scheduled 2 times a day and only left for her to eat for about 15 minutes, give water more frequently) she should go out. Every time your puppy eats or drinks they will process it and need to relieve themselves within a 15 minute period. Keeping her on a schedule should help to eliminate accidents. As she starts to "get it" you can begin to give her more room, eventually letting her roam the house again but only if she behaves properly. If she starts to regress start to remove freedom. Good Luck!|`|9RItkm8yaa	I have a morkie and I must say training was a breeze, are you crating her???  I know nothing about crating however here is what I learned while training my little guy..  First off I use wee wee pads, especially with yorkies who are so delicate to cold or damp weather it is best to have them use to doing their business inside as well as out. You can not yell at the dog for soling a carpet or a floor unless you catch her in the act, then simply place her on her wee wee pad..  Everytime I used to catch my little guy doing number 2 on my rug, I would flip him upside down (as he was going) and put him on his pad.  If he would pee where i did not want him to and I caught him doing it I would simply say a firm NO then put him on his pad.  If you yell or slap their butt after the damage is done they have no idea why you are mad, and this cause them to fear you rather then trust and repec you.. you must be the alpha!!  Try this, it is a great system, My dog was a year old in June and he goes outside when I walk him, and on wee wee pads whenever we are inside, my house, my moms, my inlaws... it is a great system.  If you do decide to try to use wee wee pads, while she does pee pee tell her " go do potty", or whatever you want, if you say the same thing over and over everytime she pee's she will pee on command for you..  It is wonderful, when you are not home and you have her with you.  Also I would read up on Yorkie Climate control, they are very fragile with certain weather patterns,   Good luck, please let me know if this worked, or if you have any questions|`|xHwWTzCyaa	when training pick water up at night and no food. only during the day unless u want to get up several times in the night for walks.

8PmGHL4naa	As a dog trainer, you know that there are always certain individuals who will adamantly deny the potentially dangerous behaviors of their pet. How about a husky that recently lunged at me, teeth out, and the owner defended the behavior, saying he was just "curious." <br>  <br>  I can think of a lot of dog owners who would show up with red flag dogs wearing yellow flag handkerchiefs. And I personally would not want to be the one to inform them that their dog/child should exit the park!   <br>  <br>  Flags will not keep dogs from being animals either, even a group of yellow status dogs could react with each other and be the cause of an injury or dispute.<br>  <br>  I am just not in favor of dog parks, I have seen too many dogs who have been injured there....of all breeds and types. There are too many variables!|`|l86FRuhnaa	Yeah good idea, although some people wouldn't like to admit their dog is red-flag worthy.<br>  I would be a yellow in honesty!<br>  And i agree with the good people above me, people shouldn't bring aggressive or untrained dogs to the park if they know they pose a threat to others!|`|GIeGVJRmaa	That is a great idea.  Only problem is that some people won't be honest and use the red or yellow flag.  I've seen children that needed a red flag whose parents think they are angels.  It would work if we had a honest society but I'm afraid that won't happen this side of heaven.|`|AsEQWeilaa	That would be great as long as the owners are honest with themselves. <br>  <br>  I can hear it now. "My mini-doxie has only bit a few times, and it was because another dog sniffed her butt. How rude. Why shouldn't I have used green? Of course my precious baby is a green!"|`|iOJH7SP6aa	I think it could help, but from experience some people do not understand that dogs like to rough house.<br>  My theory is if you don't see blood or hear a yelp it's probably ok.<br>  I think most people would just be rude about it still.|`|TldYGEwuaa	It might help to an extent.<br>  <br>  I know people who think their little monsters are well behaved angels though, so they wouldn't put the right flag on their collar.|`|iyu3I1PBaa	Actually I would prefer not ot have ANY "red" dogs in my park. <br>  <br>  Quite honestly I feel dogs should have to pass a temperament test to be able to enter the dog park in the first place. I am SICK of people's untrained mongrels running amok of the place - There is NO excuse for creating a DANGEROUS situation be bringing your untrained or aggressive dog to a dog park. <br>  <br>  There are OTHER palces to socialize and train iffy dogs - such as in a group obedience class under the watchful eye of a professional.<br>  <br>  ETA: In my town we have 2 dog parks, both require the use of a "pooch pass" to gain entrance. It's like hotel room credit card key. To get one you have to send in your payment, proof of vaccination and spay/neuter (Dog doesn't HAVE to be altered it's just cheaper) It would be super easy to include a copy of a CGC certificate or recommendation letter from a vet or trainer... <br>  <br>  Me thinks I need to start a petition...|`|mpb07ADUaa	That idea does seem creative and well-thought-out, but how many owners do you think would actually be honest about their dog's temperament? I don't think very many would take that kind of system seriously. <br>  <br>  I personally do not think that any sensitive or reactive dogs should be taken to a dog park. It should always be a safe place for friendly dogs to interact - adult dogs in need of better socialization need to be taken to small play groups, to be easily supervised, until that dog's socialization skills have improved greatly enough to take on a dog park.<br>  <br>  I took Princess to the dog park once, because she's incredibly easy-going and loves everyone, of all shapes and sizes. I didn't take AnnaBelle because she can be a bit touchy around unruly dogs and does not like to be pushed too far, but not aggressive by any means. <br>  <br>  The ideas above about having to pass a temperament test - I think that'd be a bit more effective.|`|wJCAoBKmaa	i have been interested in taking my dog to the local dog park but was a little leary, wondering what I would do if a larger dog was in there and was tempermental. I think your idea is pretty smart.|`|gqQTCFJ5aa	in hopeing that pepole consider their dogs true personality its a great idea wish we could do it to parents and there bratty kids|`|jAsJJ8aVaa	I think it is a great  idea as long as people are honest.|`|64FGPvLTaa	That sounds like a VERY good idea!!!!|`|ahzL8uCKaa	i think it's a well thought out idea and it could go somewhere but will people actually want to waste time putting hankerchifs on their dogs and will it really work?|`|9gMQAWBNaa	I think the idea is a good one, but its sounds a bit too controlling for many owners. <br>  So many think their dogs are fantastic and often do not understand agressive posturing. Dogs of any breed are often unpredictable, they are most often non-agressive but it truly depends who they are with. In a pack situation, things can turn agressive with even the gentlest dogs. <br>  Dogs who are spayed and neutered placed with dogs who are not often lead to fights and posturing. <br>  Most days at the dog park are fun and everything goes well, I rarely enter when there are certain dogs there, running in threes or fours. <br>  I've learned to know which ones will get along with my dog and which ones will not. Some owners think their dogs are wonderful until they turn into little or big monsters. <br>  Some larger dogs are agressive only with smaller dogs. All of it really cannot be controlled they way one would like it to be. There are so many ifs involved.|`|ETcBRko3aa	Well, it is cute.  <br>  <br>  But really, people that have dogs that are "reactive" or aggressive SHOULD NOT be bringing their dogs to dog parks.  It is dangerous to other dogs and owners.<br>  <br>  People need to be responsible about their dogs.  If you have an aggressive dog, take it for a long walk instead.  Or get it training and then allow it in the dog park.<br>  <br>  I see this all the time, and some legal disputes have occurred because a dog bit another dog.  It is dangerous.|`|uKOYK1Lvaa	Could, as long as owners are willing to be honest about the temperment of their dogs.<br>  <br>  Another way (branching off) would be to have a trainer evaluate each dog (quickly, if possible) before they are allowed to enter. Give them a hankie and let them keep it--it is their entrance 'ticket'. If they want a green one, they have to pass a test.|`|Sy3OYhe8aa	that's how it is at the animal shelter where i volunteer at.  it's a very good idea unless whoever tagged them are wrong.  I walked into a cage to walk a dog and he jumped up onto my shoulders and tried to bite my face.  That was definately not a green sticker dog.|`|SKvahrYOaa	yes its a great thing
ayOyLgRGaa	Their front ones cant reach and they don't have thumbs, elbows, or fingers.|`|GIeGVJRmaa	Because they can get better leverage from the back feet and scratch more effectively.|`|UPoiZgjaaa	They do that because it's to hard to reach there ears with front legs...there arms can't bend like human's can.|`|EHF8yYwCaa	The same reason dogs lick their private parts:  Because they can :)|`|W02kTOqmaa	It's easier then scratching with their front feet, plus they can put more power behind the back feet and get a better scratch.<br>  <br>  Because using the front feet just isn't practical for a four legged animal
x8Vgu6acaa	I am very sorry your mom took your dog to the pound.  She should have either found it another home or taken it to a no kill rescue.  But it does sound like your family was not in a position to have a puppy.  Especially with your very young brother.  <br>  Your dog had no choice to eliminate in her crate.  She could not hold it that long.   I know you did the best you could.  But your family would be better off to not get another pet.  |`|Ai8NrXB8aa	You need an adult dog. Get an adult, low energy dog. Basset Hound may be good.|`|OrXEJow5aa	Get a small but not too small of a dog. An american eskimo perhaps. Don't use the crate as a punishment. Simply give it a little pop in the mouth and say no when it bites|`|GT6396BDaa	If you want a larger breed of dog, then a Labrador mix would be good.  They make great family dogs.    |`|I7IS3RU1aa	Honestly, I don't know what to say. You shouldn't have a dog if you're mom will take it back to the pound at the drop of a dime. The pounds kill dogs, so I hope she knows this & sleeps better at night. I really wish I had something to say. A dog isn't unsuiting for you, it's unsuiting for your lifestyle, mom included.|`|fa70fc6c0ebd4df17b301a1c34d3c0b0aa	Labs are generally very smart dogs, love to play but are also very snuggly dogs. They are easy to train/house break. They live to please their families. You will need to make sure they have toys when your not there to keep ther minds active as with any dog. But the dog park is a great place for active dogs. They need to run and play and need walks to explore. Good luck with this. Be patient with your mother it sounds as though things are stressful for her too. i know its hard to understand but she needs your support right now, in the same sense you feel you need a dog. help each other out....|`|NltbbLLNaa	You should get a Border Collie/German Shepherd mix.

She's not feeling well I'd say<br>  |`|JzqskJKIaa	When a dog is pregnant, they are very protective and they may try to keep away from people. When you rub her, it make her think that you might hurt the babies in some way. As her pregnancy goes on, these effects will become more and more noticeable. Give her a nice soft bed, and leave her alone for a little. She may disappear for a while, but she is just hiding. Don't worry. Just give her some space. She should feel better when se gives birth.|`|rZBPdlqgaa	I would watch her very closely. Is it a painful whine or an annoyed whine? If it's a painful whine, I'd take her in to see a vet. If she just seems annoyed, give her some space. But keep a close eye. |`|luG7ffFKaa	she probably doesnt like it when you touch her soo dont touch her!!! she probably thinks you want to take her babies away (i know it sounds silly!)

Turned out he hated my then boyfriend hasn't done it since the boyfriend and I broke up! He once pooped in his work boots! Guess that cat had a good judge of character! to bad It took me 3 years to figure it out! Ha Ha!<br>  |`|BYvAivz1aa	Litter tray???  Put it in a place where she can get to it all the time.<br>  Also if you catch her dumping, then squirt her with a TINY bit of water, but make sure she doesn't know where it came from. move hr to the litter tray.<br>  Litter training<br>  Easy: Place the cat in the litter tray when she wakes up, after food, before and after she plays....... until she realizes thats were she is supposed to go.<br>  My cat is litter trained, but she does also go for the dump outside|`|n6lgk2CAaa	We've had this problem with one of our cats for over a year now and he still hasn't quite got the hang of it!<br>  <br>  Max even poops NEXT to the litter tray!<br>  <br>  What i found worked with my other 2 cats is that if i catch them in the act i tell them off in a stern voice (usually along the lines of "NO") and then i give them 'quiet time' where i go and shut them in a room on their own for 5 minutes.  They seem to have got the hang of it, but the other one is hopeless!<br>  <br>  But please remember if you're going to tell them off, you must only do it if you see them doing it otherwise they don't understand what they are being told off for (e.g. if you come home from work and find they've pooped on the floor, you can't really tell them off because they won't understand).<br>  <br>  Usually if you've trained your cat to go outside to the toilet ok then they should soon get the hang of a litter tray.|`|643984eca85a1727daf5870ca0b9bebeaa	Whenever you see your cat about to do a 'poop', lift her up and put her in a litter tray.

2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Because some legislators retain some ridiculous notions about Americanized ferrets.  They label them as a danger to wildlife (they are 'pests'), they describe them as vicious wild animals, they believe  they contract and spread the rabies virus .<br>  <br>  These ideas are fallacies.  Americanized ferrets are so completely domesticated that they pose NO danger to wildlife.  In fact, they would not be able to survive in the wild (most US ferrets are kibble fed--where would they find a kibble-bush to eat from?  Mine are fed a raw diet, but they still can't see an unthawd prey item as food).<br>  As for being vicious, well, any animal can turn aggressive (especially if abused).  Ferrets are the least likely to do that and the damage is less severe than if someone was attacked by a dog or cat.<br>  For the rabies scare--ferrets actually have a slight natural immunity to it, already.  Getting bit doesn't guarentee transfer of the virus.  And for those ferrets that DO contract it, they get dumb rabies (they are passive).  Researchers have found that the virus doesn't even have time to make it to the salivatory glands before the ferret dies, so even IF they bit something or someone, they would not pass it on.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps answer your question.|`|pDSde3qdaa	Basically its due to ignorance.  The truth is domestic ferrets would not last 24 hours if let go.  They would die.  Their distance cousin the black-foot ferret is an endangered wild animal but they are totally separate animals.  The domesticated ferrets have been so for many years and no longer exists in the wild|`|yN8s1qevaa	Can devastate the local wildlife population if set free in the wild.|`|EfAzLkL9aa	Maybe because they're evil little buggers than bite you into oblivion?

1Qh9i9cWaa	Pics could help....<br>  <br>  Melafix will only help for minor fin/tail injuries.PimaFix is a little bit better for bacteria and fungus infections, but usually only when it's caught early. <br>  <br>  If you're seeing open sores, you're best bet is to go with an actual antibiotic. I would recommend Maracyn Two or tetracycline, because freshwater fish generally get gram negative bacterial infections, which those 2 meds will treat. The sulphur based meds, think it's Maracyn Plus(?) may work as well, but not for sure on that one....Also keep treating him in QT, since tetracycline will definitely kill off your beneficial bacteria. Good luck!<br>  <br>  It could also be an ammonia spike....<br>  <br>  People say that a goldfish should be in a 15 gallon tank at least for one.

You could also starve your goldfish for a day...

Try talking to him or not moving so fast by him|`|xGUmdy3Waa	is he new?  i guess its just his way of protecting himself, try saying hi to him everyday, that will really get him used to you.  but yes, its true, sometimes bettas view others as threats even though they see the same thing everyday.  heres my site if you need info<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aquariumexperts.webs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquariumexperts.webs.com</a> <br>  <br>  God bless =)|`|drzN1kkuaa	He feels threatened<br>  They usually do that when their about to attack<br>  Probably because your bigger then him.<br>  <br>  Dont worry, my beta use to do that.<br>  He grew out of it though after a while|`|MnmNl6Hiaa	he is saying stay away because he sees you as a threat but just take it as a hello and talk to him|`|22TnQ7vPaa	they do that when their ready to attack LOL good game to u.|`|Yztrofywaa	HAHA, thats normal among betas, they are naturally aggressive fish and it may see you as an intruder into "His" territory. It would do the same thing if you put a mirror in from of him. he's not happy or scared, he's letting you know you are in his space.|`|f1gmEmUTaa	The gill flare thing that bettas do is usually in response to a threat or a rival male. If you're just appearing in front of the tank then maybe he's just surprised. He may view you as a rival. Who knows, fish are weird.

SlQidKtqaa	Maybe you should try NOT hitting your cat? Usually a firm voice, or even clapping your hands together (and not on the animal) should do the trick to get him to stop doing whatever it is he's doing wrong. When cats don't feel well, they tend to hide. If he's still in pain, and surgery is needed and he has not yet had it, it is no wonder he is hiding. Your methods of scolding seem a tad harsh, and in his fragile state he may certainly be terrified. He only bit you because he doesn't want you to touch him where it hurts, and you responded by hurting him more. He sounds like a sick kitty, and needs to be loved, not hit, back to health.|`|1TiPo3Ezaa	He probably just feels more vulnerable to your punishments now that he's hurt.Or it could be a mixture of the meds/treatment.I suggest you go to a dollar store,and buy a little squirt gun to spray little water near him (not in his face) when he does something you don't like..then he'll fear the bottle not you (his mom)|`|1V5T6aXOaa	He was trying to protect himself (yes, from you) and you hit him?  And just how did the cat break his leg?  <br>  <br>  Leave him alone.  Take him to the vet, but you've abused him, and I don't see you regaining his trust anytime soon.  <br>  <br>  Why don't you ask the vet if he knows of a GOOD home for your cat. <br>  <br>  I am appalled by this.|`|3kBcHJIIaa	All of these things seem to be important factors in the situation. Usually when their ears flatten and they bow their head, it means they're scared. Maybe you could have been the cause of the fractured femure by accident, and if not I didn't mean to offend you. I believe a better form of punishment, other than hitting the animal, would be a spray bottle. The pain medications may also make you seem more harmful, so for now being gentle in his time of need is probably the best idea. I have a cat is scared to death by the slightest movement, but if your quiet and gentle, he'll come up to you and look for affection. It seems to me that the best idea it to be gentle, and try not to hit him. Try the spray bottle, or talking to him in a stern voice.|`|AA10912383	You're cat is scared of you because of the negative punishment you gave him - by hitting him. Doing that can erase (in their mind) all of the good things. That, and if his leg is hurting him, you need to take him to the vet as soon as possible!! Postponing the appointment could have made it a lot worse for your cat. But yeah, just because your cat bit you doesn't mean that you should hit him!!! If he does it again, just leave him alone, he'll be upset at the fact that you left him. And he probably sat in the spot because he needs/wants your attention!!! He's squinting his eyes, flattening his ears and bowing his head because he's terrified you're going to hit him again.<br>  <br>  To regain his trust, you need to show him a lot of love and affection, and let him come to you, especially after he's been taken care of at the vet. that's what I do with my cat. After I've scolded her for something, I ignore her and wait for her to come to me to 'apologize' (she licks me to death haha).|`|QLWPvFmuaa	Well, first, I hope your kitty gets better, because re-earning his trust will be somewhat easier once he stops hurting.  Next, find a way to discipline that does not include hitting.  I am afraid what happened was when you tried to remove him a second time, you hurt him.  He tried to defend himself and you punished him, making him hurt more and may have actually made the original injury worse.  So, you have taught him that you cannot be trusted not to hurt him.  Now, he is afraid he will be hurt any time you touch him and that is sad.  Unfortunately, it is much easier to lose an animal's trust than it is to regain it.  <br>  You have your work cut out for you.  You will need to take a lot of time with him and make it as non-threatening as you can.  Make the places that are off limits to him inaccessible to him so you don't recreate the break point.  I would confine him to a bedroom or some room where he is comfortable.  I would join him in that room with treats, sit down on the floor, well away from him, talk softly and gently toss a few treats one at a time, near him but not at him.  Just be with him.  (If is seems to help, sing to him.  I know it sounds silly, but I used to sing to some of my rescue horses while I was getting them used to me.)  Hopefully he will start looking forward to being with you.  As he begins to trust you again, toss the treats closer to you until he comes within petting range.  Do not, at this point, try to pet him.  Be patient.  When you can get him to take a treat right beside you, put a treat in your hand and offer it to him with your hand on the floor.  Once he seems comfortable taking a treat from your hand, try scratching him under the chin before removing your hand.  Over time, from scratching his chin, work up to scratching his neck and then to running your hand along his body.  Try to avoid the top of his head until you can comfortably pet the rest of him.  Last, work your way around from his chin to his ears and to the top of his head.  Good luck.  If he hasn't come around within a few months, you will probably have to have an animal behavorist help you out.  Ask your vet for recommendations.|`|kZ5wWUg2aa	Metacam for cats wont harm him, as long as its not given long term. These sorts of drugs are known to give cats kidney failure because they have to filter though the kidneys and cats are prone to kidney failure.<br>  <br>  He could also be avoiding you because he is in pain and wants to be left alone. Maybe try feliway spray  ( friendly cat pheromone) also to see if that calms him down, even spray your hands before you pick him up this will make him feel a bit happier.|`|AA11457471	What bothers me the most is that you felt it necessary to physically punish a cat that you knew already had a serious injury!!!<br>  You have some deep seated control &/or anger issues & probably should seek some counseling.<br>  No, I'm not being mean. Somewhere within yourself you've already realized this, I'm sure.<br>  BTW, how did the cat get his injury?<br>  <br>  Of course he's frightened! You would be, too, if someone 15 times your size was taking swats at you!<br>  Holding down a cat is not effective, either!<br>  <br>  PLEASE do some research on the proper training of cats!<br>  They are not little dogs & they are not good by nature of honoring your wishes for them to stay out of certain places. That comes with owning cats.<br>  You have to prevent access to those areas if it's that important to you.<br>  <br>  And for God's sake, give your cat the pain med!!! <br>  It's becoming more & more common for Metacam to be prescribed to cats.<br>  It has little taste so give it in a little canned food.|`|SnanuNKiaa	Your cat is scared of you. While i understand training a cat not to bite, you should not grab your cats face and Strike them. The better way to handle it is that when he's going for the bite, reach into his mouth and press his tounge to the bottom of his mouth, it doesn't hurt them and makes them realize this isn't something they want. after a while they stop. <br>  <br>  the only thing you can do is wait. Impatience will only make the cat resent you further, and will make living together unbearable. <br>  <br>  and don't try to give him away until you figure this out, either. i adopted an abused cat and she attacked my cousins foot as a reaction because her former owners kicked her into a wall.  it took her a year to realize we weren't going to hurt her. Moving to a new home in this conditions adds a lot of stress to a traumatised cat.|`|GHfuLXubaa	You should consider giving this cat up to a person capable of caring for him. You NEVER hit cats, they have extremely fragile bone structures...of course he's terrified of you - you abused him. I can't believe you hit him in the face and now you are wondering why he's afraid of you.  And if your vet prescribed medicine, why would you listen to anyone else about the meds. You really should reconsider ever owning a pet -|`|PmT0Bx21aa	i have one teeny tiny question for you..................WHY ARE YOU ABUSING YOUR CAT?!?!?! no wonder why shes afraid of you!! imagine giving your CHILD a black eye! use the tone in your voice, not your hands. next time your cat is misbehaving yell, but dont hit, STOP IT! and clap your hands loudly. if that doesn't work then just spritz JUST A LITTLE water on her from like a spray bottle or something. to gain the trust in your cat you have to be nice to it and just bond.|`|SBEnrRZPaa	Never ever hit a cat! It doesn't work and makes them timid and sly. Clapping your hands whilst at the same time saying "no" is sufficient. If not, use a spray gun to get them moving will do the trick. With biting and scratching behaviour, a sharp yelp of pain makes them realise that they are hurting you. I have never hit my cat. They do take a long time to forgive in any case. You will have to put in some serious hard work and never hit him again.|`|qOiv8d3Laa	GRABBED HIS FACE AND HIT HIM???  Are you NUTS?  You MIGHT consider rethinking your form of "discipline"... some may consider it ABUSE instead.<br>  <br>  How did he fracture his bone?  Did you throw him against the WALL to "discipline" him?<br>  <br>  After all he's been through, he needs the "Marlene Dietrich" treatment... you know.. "I want to be LEFT ALONE."  Leave the cat alone to heal at his own pace.  You might try leaving bits of treats out for him near where he "hides."  Try small bits of cheese. Most cats love cheese.  Maybe, sooner or later, he will begin to trust you and associate positive rewards with your presence.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, if he continues to cower, it may be too late for you.  You may need to find him another new home where he can be comfortable.<br>  <br>  <br>  Me... kittyslave23... I know my place.

ExyPc0vMaa	The cats evil, I wouldn't worry about|`|ydshiNrKaa	It's the high prey drive that some dogs have.  My german shepherd/malamute is the same way with cats, he goes ballistic when he sees them.|`|71i6IjdZaa	Most dogs are usually like this hun! When you walk past your neighbours house, give him a treat to distract him:)<br>  xx<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnC0abPBUGI261.VQTOigf7L7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090222220345AALVW6M">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Ge6WhCf7aa	it is normal for dogs to act like this just keep your dog indoors if possible. and it may not be the cat but something else.<br>  <br>  ask the owner to keep the pet indoors as well?|`|5SmX1oLlaa	thats what dogs do. you need to take him to obediance classes they can help with training him to stop.|`|2lNM2xBmaa	Wow! You are getting some pretty horrible answers. I don't understand why people have to be so rude. If they don't want to answer the question, then don't. There is no excuse for rudeness at all.<br>  <br>  Anyway, back to your question. You certainly don't want to encourage your dog to bark at your neighbor's cat. Nobody wants to hear a barking dog for any reason, plus it is rude to the cat. The cat is just sitting there. It certainly doesn't deserve to have a dog bark at it and scare it. <br>  <br>  I am guessing the dog doesn't know what he is doing is wrong. What you need to do is teach him another way. <br>  <br>  First what you need to do is to not alllow your dog to bark at the cat from your porch. Until your dog's problem is resolved, don't allow the dog in a location where he can see the cat and bark at it. Maybe the back yard for now or a side yard. But continuously allowing the dog to bark without correcting it is not solving the problem.<br>  <br>  Second, when the dog barks at the cat from the porch call the dog to you inside the house and out of sight of the cat and give him a tasty treat. You are distracting him from the cat. Don't give him the treat while he is barking at the cat. That would reinforce the barking at the cat. You are kind of teaching him an alternate behavior instead of barking at the cat. If you are consistent and everybody is consistent, the dog will start to think more about the tasty treat from you rather than barking at the cat.<br>  <br>  Do you know what a head halter is? Does you dog need one for his walks? Does you dog tend to pull hard while he is walking and not pay attention if he is on his flat collar. Take a look at this type of head halter on the bottom of this webpage: <a href="http://www.thesocialpet.com/dog_walking_grooming_transportation1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesocialpet.com/dog_walking_...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  When you walk past the cat, do something similar. Don't give the treat while he is pulling you toward the cat. Call him instead to you and then give him the treat. This will distract him from the cat and teach him that something fun and tasty is going to occur. He forgets about the cat and barking at the cat (a habit he has formed) and thinks about, instead, the tasty treat coming from you.|`|hMF3kg3Baa	I have beagels too, and they have a loud bark.

QnJvJ67uaa	So long as your stirrups are the correct length for your legs/ saddle/ style etc the important thing here is to build up the muscle in your calves. If you are only riding once a week it will take a long time for your heels to stay down naturally.<br>  When you have spare time do some exercise to help.<br>  Stand on a step (bottom, you don;t want to fall lol), place the ball of your feet on the step and push your heels down. You should feel the muscle pulling as you do this. Don't bounce, just push your heels down the rise slowly up amd repeat for as long as you like. This should help speed things along.<br>  Once you have the correct muscle keeping your heels down will become second nature and very soon you wont be hearing "HEELS DOWN" from your instructor every time its your turn ;)<br>  Good luck and happy riding :D x|`|8cikAYp3aa	for some reason people who cant keep their heels down, Can keep their toes Up..  try thinking about that.. <br>  <br>  Check your stirrup length. to long and your heels will come up no matter what you think or do<br>  <br>   Relax your leg.  From hip to ankle.  when your tight your leg tends to come up,  heel comes up.. horse goes faster, rider gets tighter, heel stays up<br>  <br>  Try this as well.  when you mount, stand in your stirups and let your heels drop as low as you can.  then softly sit down.  Do that several times a lesson  when you find your heels up.  It will help you relax, stretch and reposition your leg.|`|K4bJgTF4aa	jack your stirrups up jockey height.  and ride like that for a day or two and then bring them back down to normal length.  also don't pinch with your knees.  that is really bad and can throw you way off balance.  sit up straight in the saddle.  and make sure there is a line from your shoulders to hips to heels.|`|TA4Bvp4Kaa	1.Go to a step and push your heels down on the step <br>  2.in PC just evrey few minutes have a look and see if your heels are down<br>  3.Is your horse at your house?? if so pratise at home keep checking there down<br>  4.Make sure your stirrups arent too long<br>  5.try just keeping your heels down all the time <br>  <br>  There are a few suggustions :) hope this helps|`|ZB0VuKh8aa	Ride without stirrups as much as you can. This will "lengthen" your legs and you will then find it easier to keep your heels down. Also, when you are riding try to think "point my toes at the horses ears" that helps too!!!|`|e297ec36aa9e3904ff06e84dd4fce511aa	I normally tie my feet with either a good rope on hand, or custom made leather strap to keep foots in place while crazy glue-ing heels flat down to avoid them lifting while riding into the sunset.|`|pyEvNC8Taa	this is a thing you can do when you're on the horse and you have a teacher/friend/family member with<br>  <br>  1. Sit on the horse.. duuh<br>  2. Take your feet out of your stirrups<br>  3. Make someone lift your feet and take them a bit further back than they are<br>  4. Make the person hold your heel and toes and the person uses force to roll your toes in circles<br>  5. The person lifts your whole leg a bit further back and pretends that he/she puts your feet in a stirrup quite far behind<br>  6. From here he/she puts your feet in the stirrup<br>  This should all be done in slow movements where the rider sits still while the person does the activity.<br>  <br>  If it's done correctly you feel that you're packed around the horse and that there is no possible way to fall off. This should be done everytime you go on the horse and in the end it will be natural for your feet to be this way. Don't go crazy if it feels weird or tiring the first time..keep on going and it will be like normal after a couple of hours riding.<br>  <br>  Seriously...try it!! :O|`|uclZT4Enaa	What is your riding style?? If you're riding western you may have your stirrups adjusted too low and that will cause your heel to come up rather than down. I guess that would be the same for english. Make sure you're stirrups are at the right height when you're mounted by letting your feet out of them and they should hit right about your ankle bone.<br>  <br>  Now that you know that... perhaps you could make sure that you're foot is properly adjusted in the stirrup. It should never be in any further than the ball of your feet. Like when you stand on your tip toes to reach something on a tall shelf.<br>  <br>  Soo, I'm not really sure what this PC is that you say but if it's a riding school or a camp then I'm sure you already know the things that I have just told you.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you're sitting tall in the saddle with your shoulders square and your back strong. Also make sure that your seat bones are correctly positioned on the saddle and just kind of relax your legs.<br>  <br>  I hope that this information has helped you. =]|`|dBRxfRGqaa	riding without stirrups always helps, otherwise, i tell people to make their legs feel really long without putting too much weight in the stirrups. at first, it does take a lot of concentration, but after a while, it comes naturally. it might feel like you are stretching your calf muscles at first. you can try an exercise on the stairs, stand on a stair with only your toes, just like you put only toes in stirrups, and lower your heels. you will feel your leg muscles really stretch, hold it for a few seconds, and then straighten your feet (like your standing) again. do this a few times until you can lower your heels farther. it really helps, especially if you do it right before you ride.<br>  hope this helps :)|`|wfmtZBlaaa	leg back under you.. then you heel wont be down <br>  then open your knee out and relax it and your foot will be nice and flat<br>  you don't want you push your heel down to much, needs to look comfortable <br>  <br>  also check that the stirrups are the right length, that can effect how your foot/leg/ancle sits <br>  x

a2cjwMKcaa	If your new tank is big enough get some more clown loaches. They just do SO much better in a larger group. Be aware they do grow big, but it takes many years.<br>  <br>  Ian|`|AraBfesHaa	O.k. I have to speak up here.<br>  The ones that are recommending the livebearers (guppies, platys, mollies, swordtails etc) must never have had any.<br>  If you get just one female of any of these species, chances are astronomical that it will be pregnant when you buy it.  So in a month or less you're looking at up to 80+ fry in your tank.  And with that same mating that brought you those fry, will come up to 80+ more every month for up to 6 months.  That's for EACH female you guy.  So if you choose any of these species, make sure you only get MALES, or you'll be back on here in a couple of months asking how to make them stop.  (already seen it several times and I've only been on here for 2 months).  One batch will overcrowd your tank and diminish the water quality very quicklyl even though they are small.  And in a couple of months after they're born, they'll be reproducing also.   So unless you're prepared to buy several more tanks just to house all of them, stay away from them.  <br>  And also, mollies stay healthier in brackish water, even though they can live in fresh water, they prefer brackish and have less health problems in it.<br>  Just make sure whatever you choose, do some research and make sure they need the same temperature that you now have and the same ph, etc.  That will make for a healthier bunch of fish.<br>  You also don't say what size your new tank is/will be, so it's hard to say what and how many more fish you could add to the tank.  That makes a difference.|`|OGXYu8BZaa	hi <br>  i,m in the hobby for more then 25 years.<br>  how big the new tank is. the tank should be at least 3 ft in length and 1 by 1 ft in hight and breath. clown loach is a single spices tank fish and it will not mix with others. go for other tetras and barbs like tiger barb,rosy barb,neon tetra,cardinal tetra ect,  .the tetra which you have are serpe tetra.<br>  <br>  bye <br>  happy fish keeping.|`|j2VDYbeoaa	Mollies, guppies, swordtails, These are all good community fish.

8i90ov0Gaa	Both parents must be either 100% hets for piebald or actual piebalds. Breeding a 100% het male to a normal female will not give you any piebalds period. That's why the female hets aren't cheap, because you need them to create piebalds. <br>  <br>  However, if you bred the 100% het male to the normal female, approximately half of the offspring would receive the piebald gene from the father. But since there is no way to look at them and tell, the offspring would be called 50% possible hets for piebald. you could hold back several of the female offspring, raise them up, and breed them back to the father. One male can breed with 5 or 6 females. Since theoretically half of the female offspring may carry the gene, about half of your holdback females could give you a piebald. But this method would take an extra generation to see results. Also, breeding two hets together will only give about 25% of the offspring being actual piebalds, so considering females lay an average of 4 to 6 eggs, you may or may not see any piebalds from even the ones who actually have the gene.|`|ncWYvkheaa	The piebald morph is recessive which means that BOTH parents need to carry the gene to produce visible piebald offspring.  There are two definite ways of accomplishing this:  <br>  <br>  ((NOTE: Obviously you could breed 2 Piebalds together to get all piebald babies, but apart from being terribly expensive, many breeders don't like breeding two recessive traits together as it can sometimes produce defects as a result of inbreeding (for example "eyeless" albino boas))<br>  <br>  Anyway:<br>  <br>  1) Buy a male and female that are both 100% het for Piebald (this means there is a 100% chance that they each carry one Piebald allele but look totally normal...i.e. "heterozygous").  When bred together, 1/4 of the babies will be Piebalds, and the rest will be 66% het Piebalds (there is a 66% chance that they might carry the gene, but look normal otherwise).<br>  <br>  2)Buy a Piebald and a 100% het Piebald.  Half of the offspring from this breeding should be Piebalds, and the other half will be 100% het Piebalds. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|niztxto9aa	The Piebald is a recessive gene. You need to acquire a bp with the recessive gene to make pied's. Either that or get a bp HET for piebalds.

SimAO1IUaa	if its a baby its hard to determine the sex but look it up online and they will show you picture examples which is better than an explanation. also go to the store and get them rabbit pellets and lots of timothy hay or alfafaa hay. dont give it too many vegetables and things because they are considered treats and they are suppose to have alot. dont ever give it iceberg lettuce. just go to the petstore and you will find rabbit bedding. dont give it cedar bedding that could cause respiritory problems.

Or plead with your local vet.<br>  <br>  I understand you are doing your best, and you were kind to take her in.  However if she needs help (and if that kitten is still in the birth canal I wouldn't be waiting), then you have to get it for her, even if it means giving her up.  If that kitten is really stuck, she will die without help.  At the very least, please phone a vet for advice.<br>  <br>  Since this cat is in your care, you are legally obliged to provide health care for her.  Sorry, but that's the law...

For those I would buy the frozen mixed veggies that come in small chunks, let some warm to room temperature and then mush it up and give it to the tortoise. You can also see if there are tortoise breeders or vets that specialize in tortoises near you and they can tell you what it is for sure.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|irGi6YaWaa	basically you can give your pet soft green leaves . if he dose not eats it , see a vet.

Mine are giraffes and ducks. I don't...think it means anything, because I am nothing like a giraffe or a duck. <br>  <br>  It just means that those animals are your favorites because there is something about them that you seem to like. Probably that they're pretty, elusive, cool, or whatever.|`|AA11097657	I like wolves as you can see!<br>  <br>  I like them because they are free spirits, but with their families always close to them.<br>  <br>  That is what I would like.|`|AA11503426	At a guess, I think it means you like tigers.

svrFBaENaa	Your tank is pretty new.. have you tested your water? If you did not cycle your tank, with all those fish, you will have a pretty big build up of toxins in the water... ammonia and nitrites specifically.|`|AraBfesHaa	If your floating mollile is still alive, take it out of the tank ASAP.  Put it in another container filled with 1/2 the tank water, and 1/2 new dechlorinated water of the same temperature.  This will immediately reduce the ammonia and give it a fighting chance.  If you leave itin the tank, all the other fish will nip at it and start eating it, which will definitely kill it.<br>  You added too many fish at once, causing the ammonia to spike.  Once you've taken care of your mollie, do up to 1/2 water change in the tank and add new water (dechlorinated and same temperature so they're not stressed more, and chlorine and sudden temp changes will kill them).<br>  You then need to put an ammonia neutralizer in the tank.  If you have one that also neutralizes chlorine and chloramines, that's even better.  (I use Prime, I feel it's the best one, and can be used simultaneously with Stability, a tank conditioner).<br>  You don't say what temperature the tank is at.  Did you research those fish and make sure they all need the same temperature?  If not, that could cause a problem, and you need to do that.<br>  You also need an ammonia/nitrite/nitrates tester.  With that many fish in the tank you should be monitoring the ammonia probably every day, and if it's high, fix it before it gets worse.  ammonia should be at zero to have a healthy tank.<br>  And I agree, you need to go to a different pet shop next time you shop for fish.  And ask alot of questions, but don't believe everything they tell  you.  I do that, then I also go home and research the fish on the web before I buy.  Usually I find the facts are totally different from what the pet shop peeps say.<br>  Good luck, I hope they make it.<br>  Oh yeah, you need a lid for your tank before any more fish jump out.|`|AA12383579	That's quite a tank, and so many fishes. <br>  <br>  Fishes can be very territorial, and like people the smaller ones tend to be bullied. Looks like your tank will turn into a battle field later on... It's going to be a survival of the fittest competition. <br>  <br>  Better observe your fishes for the next days and check which of them are the possible assassins. Separate the aggressive ones if you want to have most of your fishes survive.|`|QIQ1fB0Haa	first a faii you should not keep all the fish togethere you should make a saprate tank for guppiesand mollies they are very delicate fishes i have lots and lots of guppies and mollies i have made a saperated pond for mollies and guppies and i have put some live aquatic plants they like this kind of ponds so they wont need oxygen pump and keep them in shade you see after a month they will have lots and loys of babies i have tried it at my house         ok     bye sneh cham|`|6979bf0ecfe9ee379c6d4efa120ff381aa	Your tank was not cycled . I wish you had just bought a few cheap fish to begin with . You may lose a few now then it will finally balance out . I'm keeping my fingers crossed that you do not lose your knife fish. If you know someone with a older aquarium that is not having any problems you might ask them for a cup of the gravel from their tank .This might save you . good luck|`|ZzUQ8Rn2aa	fighting?|`|Ls5KpZdxaa	Your tank setup is new, some fishes will fight and some will die just because of the water change. Look for the neons, they will be the next, as they are much smaller and with my experience dont last as the others. Nothing much to do, just keep a look out. Once a fish is injured it will not survive. Not all solutions are the same for every tank, experience tells you everything. Good Luck.
BJGudd52aa	Looking at your list of fish, there are two possible suspects I would narrow it down to - either your Black Widows or your Betta are picking on those fish. Black Widows are generally placid but sometimes when they're got a lot of smaller fish around them they can become incredibly aggressive. Bettas however, are typically always fairly aggressive in a communal situation, especially against livebearers like your Guppies and Mollies.<br>  <br>  Observe your tank, especially those two species and see if you can pick out which is the culprit. Have a backup plan ready, because more than likely you will need to remove it from your system.<br>  <br>  As for the jumpers, I would suggest either employing glass covers or eggcrate to stop the fish from finding a way out. They're not normally a problem, though it's better safe than sorry.|`|AA12310378	Unless you ran a fishless cycle the 4 weeks standing won't have got the tank ready for fish. You added a lot of fish at once and their wastes are accumulating and are toxic .<br>  ( The purpose of the fishless cycle is to develop colonies of bacteria to process these wastes. )<br>  Take back any fish you can to the store but if the store sold a black ghost knife & neons (black ghost knife food) to go in the same tank you need to start looking for a new store too.<br>  For now do a 40% water change using dechlorinator in the new water and repeat this daily for the next 5 weeks or find someone locally with a mature, healthy, tank and beg some of their filter media to seed yours.<br>  The shop will try and sell you bottles of stuff - they don't work!<br>  Do the water change and then read this;-<br>  <a href="http://www.aquahobby.com/articles/e_ciclo.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquahobby.com/articles/e_cicl...</a> & <a href="http://www.tropicaltankforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=13712" rel="nofollow">http://www.tropicaltankforum.com/viewtop...</a>|`|fjI8zadKaa	Sounds like you have added the fish wayyyy too quickly. The tank has probably spiked again at this sudden increase of bioload (fish) <br>  <br>  Unless you want to give, trade, whatever your fish back to the sop, your going to have to keep doing 50% water changes for the next 3 days to week....take some water to your local aquarium and they will test it for you and help you out.<br>  <br>  There are products you can buy to stablize the water parameters. One great one is 'Seachem Stability'<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

tMtBe1lKaa	I have a malamute and live in Oregon, Western USA. He's beautiful, but doesn't like it over 90. He just f-l-o-p-s over and hangs his cute little tongue out. He would have been an inside dog, except he is a well bred malamute, who feels him home is his castle, in which he should mark his territory. I have tried everything to get him to stop, but his royal majesty refuses. He also sheds. SHEDS. like 6-7 plastic bags in a month when the weather turns. Huge cotton balls of fur. And, we can't let him off the leash or he RUNS. MILES. has a good ol' time. doesn't chase anything, just goes for a road trip. It is really in thier blood. And, on that note, the first few years of his life we nicknamed him "dadini" (a draw on houdini) for his amazing escape acts.<br>  Except for those small drawbacks, he is a wonderful dog. He cares about you, always has a goofy sort of happiness and purpose, but it takes much determination to give him the full doggy life he deserves with such powerful instincts. But, I think I would suggest a bit tamer breed with short hair. Labs are my personal favorite, some people say everyone has them, but I think there's a reason everyone has them. They are a good all around (slightly high energy) dog. good luck!|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Depends on the dog hair. Siberian if they have their hair cut off, they actual feel more heat, sometime longer fur actual in summer and spring keeps the dog cooler, then having no fur! So Siberian Husky DON'T require Clipping.<br>  <br>  Poodles, Schnauzer on the other hand require 3-4monthly clipping. <br>  <br>   NEVER BUY A DOG AND MAKE IT ADAPT TO YOUR LIFESTYLE-MOST BREEDS DON'T ADAPT TO YOUR LIFESTYLE eg Doberman Pinscher would be the WRONG choice of dog for a person who only want a dog for occassional walks, Eg Pug would be the WRONG choice for a person who LOVES to jog daily, A Siberian Husky would be the WRONG choice of dog for someone that want an Apartment dog, A Labrador Retriver MAY be the WRONG choice for ELDERLY lady <br>  A Border Collie would be the WRONG choice for an apartment dog etc<br>  <br>  YOU NEED CHOOSE  A DOG BREED THAT SUIT YOUR LIFESTYLE ALREADY<br>  <br>  Scotch collie and Shetland sheepdog are probably the two breeds i know of that can adapt to VERY different lifestyle conditions from the country to the apartment-however these dogs thrive with a fenced in yard<br>  <br>  More importantly you have to see whether the husky fits your lifestyle, they are beautiful dogs, however require an experience, highly active owner and a 6feet+ fence & very large yard.<br>   Another problem with the husky being in the house all the time-is winter-having the heater on all the time may very well make this dog overly hot-either keep it inside and have the cooler on in the middle of winter or allow it be outside in the middle of winter & inside during the hot summer periods!! <br>  Sometimes we either have to make the dog inside and outside dog or make ourselve tolerate the natural climite of the breed we choose-I don't think many people would want a Air condtioner on in the MIDDLE of winter! Little too cold for us, however Siberian Husky are used to living well below 0 degrees! We all know Australia doesn't get below 0!<br>  <br>  Remember Siberian were bred to live outside in the snow-so they can tolerate Freezing temperature and Australia doesn't get anywhere near as cold as what their original country does!<br>  <br>  So they are ideally suited to cooler climated<br>  this is the typical husky personality, however not all husky will be like this- but as a general rule- Husky are NOT laid back or Calm, VERY, Very Very difficult to find a Calm & Laid BACK husky<br>  <br>  Who should own this breed? <br>  This fun loving, affectionate, outgoing, breed requires an experienced, committed, stable owner that has educated themselves well on this breed's needs. Siberian owners should be aware of this dog's amazing natural abilities and desires. They should also know that those abilities and desires, if not channeled and use will become a problem. The Siberian Husky attracts a lot of people because of it's beauty. They are also adorable puppies and win people's hearts in an instant. Many uneducated, puppy smitten owners soon find out this is not the breed for everyone. This is a fantastic, but very specialized breed that requires a special owner to be successful.<br>  <br>  Siberian Huskies are high energy. Always look to a dogs historical roots and modern jobs for insight. These dogs were originally bred to run in sub zero temperatures for long distances and still do. Their endurance and desire to go is not the correct match for the average pet owner. But for many Siberian owners, this breed becomes a lifelong passion of the heart and they would own no other.<br>  They need the company of other dogs or of people at all times. If you work all day, or have room for only one dog, don't get a Siberian. Loneliness for this breed equals TROUBLE. A lonely Siberian Husky will display a full spectrum of undesirable behaviors.<br>  <br>  <br>  Siberian Huskies have a pretty common trait for digging holes in backyards. If you take great pride in your landscaping efforts, a Siberian is not for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  While capable of strong affection for his family, the Siberian Husky is also very friendly with strangers and make poor watch dogs. A Siberian will not alert his owner to strangers. They are usually pretty happy to see just about everyone. Which I see as a positive for the Siberian. An owner is not bothered with irritating barking every time someone enters or passes by his property.<br>  <br>  <br>  The breed in general is not good with: Cats or any small animals, rodents, birds or fowl, because of their prey drive instinct. There are of course exceptions, but don't count on it. If you desire to have or currently own such pets do not get a Siberian Husky.<br>  <br>  <br>  Siberian Huskies are vocal. They rarely bark, but will whine, or moan, and also chirp and howl. Head held high, they will produce one of the most haunting song like sounds. Now this Siberian song fest may be music to the ears of a Siberian and the Siberian Husky fancier, but the neighborhood may not agree.<br>  <br>  <br>  Siberian Huskies shed a lot. When they blow coat in the spring it is a lot like a doggie hair storm. Brushing helps and you can speed the shedding up with a warm bath. But if you don't like fur all over the house, the car, the furniture and if you don't want to match you wardrobe to you dogs coat color, you don't want to get a Siberian.<br>  <br>  Siberian Huskies need a lot of exercise. They have a high endurance level and need a owner that wants to keep up with them. Huskies love to do what they were bred for, so being involved in Siberian Husky sledding, carting and other events or breed clubs is a plus for the dog and the owner. Obedience and agility are also good outlets and activities for the Siberian Husky and owner. They can make good walking/running partners, if the weather is not to warm. They need 2 LONG walks daily-minimum of 4km daily and LOADS of mental stimulation.<br>  <br>  <br>  Siberian Huskies have a tremendous desire to RUN. But the very first dash that a puppy makes could be it's last. These dogs should never be allowed to run at large. They face too many hazards in today's world: Cars, other dogs, guns, poison, antifreeze. In addition, they can come in contact with diseases: Parvo, distemper, corona, parasites. The clever Siberian Husky can surely add to that list, easily. They also have a strong prey drive. A gentle family Siberian Husky, at large can inflict, death or injury to livestock, fowl, cats, and wildlife. These mis-adventures could cost you some time in court , large sums of money and ultimately cost your dog, it's life. A Siberian, for their own protection, should be kept confined or under control at all times.<br>  <br>  <br>  Siberians are escape artists. Some can be contained in 6 foot fencing. Others can clear an 8 foot fence like they have wings. Most Siberian Huskies require completely enclosed kennels to keep them where they are safe when they are not being supervised. Each Siberian Husky varies, but in general this breed is a lot of work to contain. The Siberian is the "Houdini escape artist" of the dog world.<br>  <br>  Adopt from a shelter and save a life-remember aussie shelter won't have many "online pictures" as they want you to come and see the dogs in person-to make sure you pick the right dog for your lifestyle.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nswar.org.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nswar.org.au/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.renbury.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.renbury.com.au/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.paws.com.au/Adoption/Pounds.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.paws.com.au/Adoption/Pounds.h...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pawsnhooves.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pawsnhooves.net/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.petrescue.com.au/shelter_directory/nsw" rel="nofollow">http://www.petrescue.com.au/shelter_dire...</a><br>  <br>  There is currently a 2year old  Siberian Husky available for adoption in NSW<br>  <a href="http://www.adoptapet.com.au/animal/animalDetails.asp?animalid=85442&result=2&statusID=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.adoptapet.com.au/animal/anima...</a><br>  <br>  Another purebred Siberian Husky-12month old<br>  <a href="http://www.adoptapet.com.au/animal/animalDetails.asp?animalid=85177&result=13&statusID=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.adoptapet.com.au/animal/anima...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.adoptapet.com.au/search/searchResults.asp?tpage=1&pagesize=16&task=view&statusid=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.adoptapet.com.au/search/searc...</a>|`|LWEceVT4aa	Okay well first of all TULIP you are NEVER EVER supposed to cut or shave a Siberian Husky.<br>  <br>  Well, down here where I live in summer its usually 30 degrees celsius, and my Husky's fine, I don't know the temperatures in australia though... The good thing about a Husky's double coat it not only keeps them warm in cold weather but cool in warm weather also. They usually can adapt to the extremities of heat. Siberians can adapt to just about any lifestyle, and they can be great indoor dogs as long as they are raise that way. Your best bet would be to ask a vet near you if your Husky would be okay in the hot temps... Good luck they are a beautiful breed.<br>  <br>  ***Never mind what others are saying about their breed being so energetic and all these needs.  Most of the people saying this probably don't own  a husky. Like I said they will adapt to your lifestyle. My husky loves the sun he will go through the house and look for the warmest spot and lay in the sun. And he is extremely laid back, but loves to play any game when I ask... I'm gonna suggest a male as they end to be more affectionate towards family and strangers then females. Do however get him neutered this makes him a much better dog.<br>  <br>  ***What m&m says is so true, they are escape artists. Mine, is pretty good near th door, I canhold it open and he won't run out. The trouble I had was with him backing out of colars and harnesses.

The temp has been hot at times, (44) My Husky doesn't do much through the day. He gets walked and played with in the mornings and evenings when it's a bit cooler. He copes ok with the heat but not so good with high humidity. He doesn't get clipped. A  husky in Sydney would cope ok. I had a Blue Heeler cross that used to feel the heat more that the Husky.

tMtBe1lKaa	have you tried a small air horn, or watergun? (make sure it doesn't look like a gun)? that might help. Otherwise, throw doggy treats. That would side track them for a bit, but then you'd have a whole pack following you!|`|aCqSF87Raa	If you're having particular trouble with certain dogs (the same ones over and over) then i would go ahead and talk to the owners. Let them know "Hey, your dog keeps getting out and coming after me. i don't appreciate it." <br>  <br>  They may not realize what's going on and talking to them is by far a better option than hurting their pets. You DO have the right to refuse to stop by any house you don't feel safe.<br>  <br>  The ultrasonic devices (i assume that's what you're referring to) don't deter very determined dogs. However you COULD try an air horn or water pistol. Just be VERY careful - you could just annoy or upset the already excited dog, which could provoke an attack. <br>  <br>  I would also look into studying dog body language a bit - that can tell you right off if an approaching dog is friendly, excited, aggressive, territorial, etc. Depending on WHY the dog is approaching, a loud noise or sudden action like spraying may aggravate the situation.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pawsacrossamerica.com/interpret.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pawsacrossamerica.com/interpr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.diamondsintheruff.com/diagrams.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.diamondsintheruff.com/diagram...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kenkifer.com/bikepages/traffic/dogs.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenkifer.com/bikepages/traffi...</a>|`|4ab58a8654f438c9feb415c928245003aa	Make them like you, (I like the earlier answer, give them treats) so instead of chasing after you, they are actually welcoming you.

x0WZE0i4aa	As long as his poos are firm and he doesn't have any spots or scabs (which can be a sign of allergic reaction), then I guess it won't do him much harm to indulge him.  Though getting him 'cat milk' would probably be better for him and rule out the risks.<br>  <br>  What does worry me is you say he's drinking a lot.  Cats are desert-adapted animals.  It's normal for owners to hardly ever see them drink.  If he's drinking lots, plus milk on top, it could be a sign of serious illness, such as kidney disease or diabetes.  I think he needs a trip to the vet...|`|oDVx7nSxaa	If he's suffering no ill effects from the milk - some do and some do not - and you're using it as a treat, not as a food source, then it's fine.  One of my cats drinks the leftover milk from my cereal occasionally with no ill effects, but one can't have more than a lap or two before getting loose stool.  Each cat's different.|`|AA11488159	In the movies, cats love a bowl of cold milk. In the real world, giving a cat milk can do more harm than good. <br>  <br>  While milk might seem like a natural choice for your cat, the truth is that cow’s milk offers no nutritional value for cats, and it can cause digestive problems in many. The reason is that most cats develop intolerance to lactose shortly after they are weaned. This means that they are unable to digest the sugars that occur naturally in milk. This causes problems that include diarrhea and other unpleasant digestive problems. <br>  <br>  Some people think that cats need to have milk in order to get all the necessary nutrients. This is not true. In fact, cow’s milk does nothing to meet a cat’s nutritional needs. If a cat was fed only milk, it would not be able to survive. Feral cats provide proof that cats do not need milk to be healthy, as wild cats do not usually have the opportunity to drink cow’s milk. <br>  <br>  As long as your cat is eating a high quality food, and has access to clean fresh water, she is getting all that she needs. Milk alone is not a sufficient diet for any cat, and should never be given in place of food OR in place of water. Replacing a cat’s food or water with milk can cause your cat to become malnourished.|`|JXQKzl2xaa	Little amounts of milk a day is fine. You said it doesn't upset his stomach so he is probably used to it by now and would have shown a reaction. I have had tons of cats, some I have given milk to, some I haven't. Those I did were fine with it. They sell some really good, cheap cat's milk at pet stores and even at Wal-Mart. You could always try there. Hope this helps.|`|AA11589437	A small quantity is OK, if it doesn't give him diarrhea. However, I would ask a vet to check on him, because an older cat may have problems with kidneys, bladders stones, etc., and milk may be bad for that.|`|MKuDawP7aa	In the movies, cats love a bowl of cold milk.

Replacing a cat’s food or water with milk can cause your cat to become malnourished.<br>  <br>  Many cats do seem to enjoy milk, and this causes a dilemma for many cat owners who love to give their cat treats that they enjoy. While most cats are lactose intolerant, some are not. For these cats, milk as an occasional treat is fine. The only way to know how your cat will react to milk is to feed her some. If she does not develop diarrhea then it is safe to assume that she is not lactose intolerant, and you can continue to give her the treat she loves. Again, milk should never be given in place of food, but as a treat.<br>  <br>  If your cat IS lactose intolerant, but still seems to crave a bowl of milk now and then, there is a way to satisfy her without upsetting her digestive system. Milk substitute that is specially formulated for cats is sold in most pet food stores. Like regular milk, it should only be given as a treat and not as a replacement for meals. Even if you feed this “cats milk” on a regular basis, a high quality cat food and fresh water should always be available. Another option for lactose intolerant cats is to give lactose-free milk. This milk is available in the same aisle as regular milk in most grocery stores.<br>  <br>  In addition to cat’s milk, there are a lot of other ways to treat your cats to special food.<br>  <br>  If your cat normally eats dry food, give her some wet food once or twice a week as a special treat. Many makers of dry cat food also make wet food, so you can stick with your favorite brand if that is important to you.<br>  <br>  Another way to treat your cats is to find ways to make their dry food special. Pet stores sell special gravy that can be poured over dry food. Several flavors are available, so you can offer your cat a variety to keep her from becoming bored with her food. Another version of this is to pour the water from a can of tuna over the dry food. You can also feed your cat some tuna, in place of wet food, as an occasional treat.<br>  <br>  Take a trip down the treat aisle at the pet store, and you will see row after row of treats. While most of them are fine for your cat, keep in mind that treats should be given as such, and should not be fed to your cat in excess as this can cause an unhealthy weight gain.<br>  <br>  Kittens, unlike full grown cats, DO need milk, but the milk they need is their mother’s. The mother’s milk is full of all the fat, protein and antibodies that a kitten needs to grow and survive. Until a kitten is weaned, approximately four weeks after birth, a kitten should have only milk. NEVER give a kitten cow’s milk. Obviously, the ideal milk is that from the kitten’s mother. If this is not possible due the kitten being abandoned or orphaned, you will need to feed a substitute that should be available at your local pet store. The kitten will need to be fed this milk substitute several times a day. While the pet store personnel can probably answer most of your questions about caring for abandoned kitten, you should consult a veterinarian to be sure that the kitten is getting exactly what it needs.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that milk is not necessary for a cat, but as long as she seems able to tolerate it, an occasional bowl isn’t going to hurt.|`|7611568cd1fb1aeba735aa6d6382a1dfaa	I don't know that cow's milk would be too good for a cat, the lactose can upset their stomach.  If he does seem to enjoy it, which I'm betting he does because it's nice and rich. I would recommend getting an animal milk from the supermarket/vet that is for cats and dogs as it is lower in lactose than regular cows milk and has been modified to meet their needs.|`|uqSbj8WQaa	You shouldn't give cats the milk that we drink.  It will upset their stomachs.  You can buy milk from the pet store that is a treat for cats, though.
Z2vlRSzpaa	It depends what state the zoo is in.<br>  <br>  If they keep the animals in small spaces and hardly feed them, then it's beond prison!<br>  <br>  But if they are keep in good, clean exhibits and with good food, then they would be luckier than they would be on the wild.|`|0bPJnvFFaa	We are talking about good zoo/bad zoo, good hotel/bad hotel here.<br>  Read Zoo Misconceptions<br>  <a href="http://hubpages.com/_Y18/hub/Zoo-Misconceptions" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/_Y18/hub/Zoo-Misconc...</a>|`|IARPr7k5aa	it's not prison, they aren't deprived of anything, it's more like a habitat.|`|pyEvNC8Taa	this depends on the zoo;<br>  some zoo's are very small and don't have enough money to take good care of the animals they have causing the animals to feel worse and of course, look worse. If the zoo has more than enough money and the spaces the animals are in are big and looks like the animals natural habitat and they have friends to keep them company the zoo is of course, much better for the animal to live in than in a small zoo which some would probably call a prison for the animal. Personally i think that the animals are much better in the wild, where they came from. I have been on safaris in Tanzania and been in zoo's in different countries and the animals look much more happier in the wild, even though the fate is uncontrolled.|`|eyZhiXYpaa	What a great question.  This is a hard one to call these days.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, wild animals belong in the wild but circumstances have changed so much now due to animals being bred in captivity.  If we were to close all Zoo's and send the animals back to where they belong they would die (as they wouldn't know how to care for themselves against their wild ancestors).<br>  <br>  I am a huge animal rights activist but do not have a problem with Zoo's as long as the enclosures are suitable and the animals are cared for to the highest degree.  It is also very important that the animals are shown the respect they need and have shelter and protection available for them to hide away from public view should they so wish - I do not condone Zoo's that force animals out into their enclosures so that the public can see them.<br>  <br>  It's a tough one though - hope I don't sound too much like a hypocrite!|`|ezITigO5aa	It's really a personal opinion. In some cases they are left in very cruel conditions. Some places could be referred to as safer than their original habitat or even save a species from dying out.|`|QHkh1DPBaa	Yes and no.  It is a prison for some animals, and a paradise for others.  Take the noble elephant.  These animals are used to going hundreds of miles in a single day.  They can't do that in a cramped zoo.  In other words, they would be prisoners.  The same goes for the big cats.  Like lions, tigers, etc.  Then, you have animals or amphibians like penguins or seals.  They love it there.  All the free food they can get without going hunting, or being eaten by predators.  You really have to look at the history of each animal, and decide which animals are imprisoned, and which ones are on a permanent vacation.|`|tGmwqtr5aa	YES it most definitely is.

tMtBe1lKaa	I think that would be determined by the size, needs and energy level of your dogs, the size of your home and yard, and your ability to care for them. Are there several people in your family who spend time with them, or is it just you? I think if it's just you, 3 is probably a limit. If there are more people, who also want them, maybe you could go with more. Honestly, I have 2, and that is my limit. They are both wonderful, but more won't make anything better than it already is. If you are worried about abandoned dogs, you might try fostering another dog while it is placed. There is a huge need for that down there right now. <br>  You can check with your city or county animal control on the regulations regarding how many dogs you can own. good luck!|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	Ask your vet because they will know what is permitted.|`|e9i7RBrbaa	I live in southern California. There is no set rule. But if your renting then its up to the land lord, If you own then thats your business but you must have the adequate things all the dogs need.

So in your case four dogs is fine.|`|Rr2D2POcaa	I live in NorCal, I believe it is limited to four dogs, probably the same for you.
lsIHSdgeaa	You are probably better of either getting one rabbit or a rabbit and a guinea pig, that way there is no way that can can breed (pet shops are often wrong with the sexes). Or you could get 2 rabbits and get them de-sexed (where i live it costs about $50 AUD per rabbit/guinea pig)<br>  <br>  We have kept guinea pigs with rabbits before and they get along fine!<br>  Just a tip if you feed them lettuce they a prone to get diarrhea.|`|oGVWdnHraa	Keeping two rabbits is only a good idea if you are willing to get BOTH desexed as there will be constant dominance struggles, mounting, and urine spraying, all of which is not fun. I think you are best off adopting from a shelter as the buns already come desexed, so that will save you a bit of money, and will also save a life! :D Another fact I might just throw in is that unaltered female rabbits have an 80% chance of contraction reproductive cancers by age 5. :( Also, I recommend opposite sex pairs as it is more likely they will get along :)|`|k2vvT6glaa	I started out with one rabbit, I think that worked because I bonded really well with her.

And if you only want two, get two of the same sex!!|`|PP1D1kilaa	I think you should get two because some rabbits suffer from separation anxiety , definitely two of the same sex|`|A5keqH5Aaa	One and then another one later. This means that the first one gets really close to you when it is young. If you get them together they will have a strong bond with each other and not quite as strong one with you. Of coarse this all comes down to handling in the end. But if you only get one it will bond with you out of necessity.<br>  But she will get lonely, mine used to cry, like full on tears. So I would recommend getting the first one at the start of hols or some time when you will be around lots so she doesn't get lonely.<br>  <br>  I say she because I would recommend one. Females get along better. If you get males you need to get them at the same time or the older one could kill the younger. If you get a male and a female I would recommend desexing the male, rabbits have a tendency to breed like rabbits.<br>  <br>  Additional info, different breeds have different degrees of intelligents. So chose a breed that suits you and if it is likely to get out of the cat flap or outside another way maybe a big one that can’t be caught by cats. I had a Netherlands dwarf, he was beautiful. Could open the cage even if I pegged it shut, could open any number of types of doors new how to communicate reasonably well and had a killer attitude, and nothing described as small and fluffy should have attitude ever.<br>  <br>  Note: as much as rabbits and guinea pigs get along that is only because they are being put in a cage together and have to. They have opposite hygiene habits. You can train a rabbit to us a kitty litter box and put its self to bed at night. I’ve found that mine got REALLY distressed by the amount of mess guinea pigs make. Then he would he furious and throws tantrums. They also have totally different intelligents levels. I wouldn’t recommend it.<br>  <br>  He had also trained my dog. Totally whipped.|`|QHkh1DPBaa	If you get a rabbit, get two.  We had pet rabbits.  And this is what happened.  Mr. Bunny was lonely after Mrs. Bunny died.  And he cried a terrible sound after his female companion died.  She may have died of rat poison.  We're not sure.  But he was extremely lonely,  yes, get your bunny a companion, since Mr. rabbit was keeping our cat and dog company.  One day he saw another rabbit visiting the neighborhood.  He got out of the yard and was squashed by a car.  He was looking fort he other rabbit.  My brother's kids didn't do a good job of taking care of the rabbits.  They roamed freely in the back yard; and, they did have many children.  But the baby bunnies were taken up by crows in the air, dropped from the air until they died.  That is what we think happened.  Because a lot of the bunnies disappeared.  And we started finding their half eaten bodies all over the block.  If you get a rabbit, make sure it has companionship.  They're very social creatures.  Don't let it out of your sight when your outside.  A huge bird will come down trying to kill it for dinner.  Don't turn your back.  Taking care of a rabbits a huge responsibility.  Animals, whether it's a dog or a cat costs big bucks if they get sick.  But they are rewarding if kept healthy and out of birds, snakes, and some cats.  Depends on the size of the rabbit.  Wouldn't chance a bunny with a cat.  Our cat was unusual in that it protected the dog and rabbit, while the dog protected the bunny.   Good luck.|`|TiFDMWoEaa	First off, congrats and good luck with your decision! Rabbits are my favorite pet, and you’ll soon learn why for yourself. ;-)<br>  <br>  Addressing your question first: <br>  Rabbits are social animals, but it sounds like you're probably at home enough that your bunny wouldn't get lonely. However, if you're EVER planning to have 2 bunnies, get them together! Cats and dogs will generally put up with another cat/dog in the house. Rabbits, on the other hand, will attack any bunny that comes on "their territory." It's extremely difficult to find a second compatible rabbit after one has already established itself in the house. There are exceptions, of course, but the majority of rabbits are highly territorial. <br>  <br>  And because you’ve asked for any general advice, here we go!I've been working with domestic animals for 20 years, and rabbits have become my favorite pet. They're social, able to occupy, and they're quiet. They can be litter-trained and they love toys. (Plastic baby keys are one of the best.) The “Crinkle Cave” (a pop-up nylon tent you can get at Wal-mart) is another favorite. Paper grocery bags and old phone books are safe cheap toys that let your rabbit rip and chew without damaging your own stuff. Natural fibers like hemp, bamboo, and so on (such as in mats and rugs) are okay, as long as they haven’t been chemically treated. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that a rabbit is not a giant hamster; it's not a cage animal. Think of a rabbit more like a cat or a dog. They can be kept in a pen while you're away/sleeping, but they need plenty of out time. Rabbits that are locked up too long become cage-aggressive: they snarl, bite, and become anti-social. So make sure you can let your rabbit out for a few hours every day. Your rabbit will really look forward to its "out time." <br>  <br>  Training: Rabbits are smart and easy to train, but you have to be firm and consistent. They will learn your tone of voice first, so don’t yell at them when they’re not in trouble, and don’t speak gently when they are. Your rabbit will learn lots of human words, too—more than you’ll ever intend to teach them—but still try to use the same words with the same lesson. For example, if you’re rabbit is digging at the carpet, you need to give the same command—such as “No dig!”—every time. <br>          Rabbits are like toddlers; they’ll try to see what they can get away with. If you tell your rabbit not to do something, like dig the rug, and they stop but don’t leave the spot, keep watching them! 9 times out of 10, they’re just waiting for you to look away. Sometimes it comes down to a staring contest, with a few “no’s” thrown in for good measure. If the rabbit doesn’t move away—or if it keeps misbehaving in front you, it’s time for punishment. Locking them in their pen or cupping your hand around the muzzle for second are good punishments. I’ve found that the “time out” technique works best. <br>          Don’t forget about positive re-enforcement. When you’re bunny is good, tell them, and change your tone of voice to match. Give the bunny treats for obeying. If you have 2, this can encourage a miscreant to behave, when they see the other receiving a treat. <br>  <br>  Food: your rabbit's main source of food should be its timothy hay. The dry rabbit food is just filler to make sure they get enough nutrients; you should feed a healthy adult rabbit no more than 1/8 cup of rabbit food per day. Because bunnies come in all sizes, you may want to check with the vet about the amount for your bunny(s) in particular. DO NOT buy the "fancy" rabbit foods that have lots of seeds and nuts in them. These aren't good for your bunny; it's not a rodent. There are other types of hay you can offer as treats. Alfalfa-based treats are usually good, as is dried fruits and vegetables. (Though go easy on the dried fruit; it can give them the runs.) I give mine a couple raisins in the morning and a piece of dried papaya (for digestion) at night. Try to give your rabbit some fresh veges when you can. Romaine or green leaf lettuce, parsley, and carrot tops are good choices. Your rabbit may express an interest in foods like chocolate, pizza, even fish (I've seen it happen)--don't let them eat it! It's bad for the bunny's health.  <br>  <br>  Health - First of all, get your bunny(s) spayed/neutered asap. You'll save yourself a lot of problems later on. If you have a local chapter of the American House Rabbit Society, they might be able to help you get a discounted rate for the operation. <br>       Rabbits are one of those animals that hide bad health, so if you're rabbit starts behaving strangely--not eating, not grooming, staggering, hunched up, etc--take them to the vet at once. One of the most common rabbit ailments is a GI blockage. (Synthetic fibers like carpet, as well as fur and other materials cause the build up) It's like a hairball, except rabbits can't regurgitate. This can kill a rabbit in a matter of days; however, if treated quickly, is a minor problem. The most obvious symptom of this problem is the rab
oDVx7nSxaa	Your vet can make a good guess as to her age range, but since they use the teeth to determine age, it's hard for them to tell if you've got an older cat with good teeth, or a younger cat with bad teeth.  They'll look at the color, the condition, and the tarter build up.  He'll also look at her eyes (they change too as a cat ages) and her overall structure (older cats start to get a bit thin in their back end as they loose muscle).  Once a cat's over say 18 months, it becomes tougher.  They'll give you an age range, though.  They'll say 1-3, 2-4, 5-8, 8-10, 10+, 14+.  They can't get any more accurate than that.  If your vet gives you a specific age, he's only guessing.  For a cat like yours with a tough life, she will probably "age" higher than what she really is.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Cats teeth turn translucent and develop tartar as they age.  A vet can guesstimate age but only an estimation and there's not a huge difference between a cat of say 3 years to one of 8 years.  And if the cat's lived a hard life its teeth probably aren't in the best shape to start with so that can further throw the guess off.  It's not something you a non-vet could figure out.  Vets have seen hundreds if not thousands of animals and it's much easier for them to determine.  Get it to the vet ASAP.  <br>  <br>  I do hope you don't have this cat in your home interacting with other cats.  Cats can carry many diseases - some of which have no cure such as Feline Leukemia and FIV - and these can be transferred to other cats via saliva (sharing bowls, fighting) or blood (fighting).<br>  <br>  FYI the crooked tail probably isn't from being stepped on by a horse.  Feral cats or "barn cats" that someone hasn't bothered to spay and neuter have a limited gene pool which means inbreeding and inbreeding can lead to birth defects - one of which is crooked tails.|`|eyZhiXYpaa	You can sometimes get an idea of age by looking at their eyes i.e. how clear they are etc.<br>  <br>  Can I just say that I wish there were more people out there like you. The fact that you mentioned you are going to register her with a vet asap shows that you are a very caring, responsible person.<br>  <br>  Thank you for saving a life!|`|SBEnrRZPaa	Good for you for saving a life. Regarding estimating her age, the vet will be in a better position to advise. If she has been malnourished, her teeth or body development may not be normal.|`|3JwFqiWsaa	yeah by her teeth, my pets vet told me about that.. i think if they are like small shes under one year but if they are big shes older.. i think :D <br>  im happy you saved a life,god bless you <3|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Supposedly you can tell by the teeth, but I don't know exactly how.

We Aussies are amazing - very smart, loyal, dedicated to our people (we're called "velcro" dogs because we like to be right beside our people), medium sized, and very pretty (if I do say so myself!).  We are not necessarily the right dog for every person or family.  We are herding dogs and working dogs so we NEED to have a JOB!!!  I've given you a couple of  link belows: the first gives some good info about the Aussie breed, then I've given you my blog to give you  a better idea of how I think about life.<br>  As to the other answers -<br>  Roxas - right answer! way to go!; Fat Tay, whilemoonlighjt..., bRe..., - wrong!; tina b - well easy grooming isn't everything, and labs do shed - badly.  <br>  Fun question - but then I'd talk about Aussies all day long!|`|qzPZf2XPaa	Labrador.<br>  Sorry, I've been with Labradors and know how to handle them, so much preferred.<br>  But really...

cSOwqXKxaa	Breeders who advertise their dogs in this fashion are breeding substandard animals, generally with health problems that lower their quality of life and cost you hundreds and thousands of $$$ in the long run.  The best breeders have waiting lists for their puppies, and good breeders have waiting lists or puppies that are only available a short time before sold, because the parents are champion animals with no health problems.<br>  <br>  NEVER, EVER buy a dog over the internet, like groceries or clothes.  A good breeder will require you to visit the dogs, or at least want to visit you (if you're local), and will have so many questions for you that you may begin to feel you're adopting a human child, not a puppy.  But good breeders care about where their pups are going, not just who has the money to pay for them.<br>  <br>  Sorry, you're wasting your time.  Surely you can find a new friend through a responsible breeder or rescue group?  What kind of dog are you looking for?  I agree with the RSPCA stance because many people aren't careful about teaching their children proper animal handling and care, and then the children get bit, the dog is turned into a shelter, and shelters can't adopt out bite cases so they are killed.  A bad cycle and one that the RSPCA very much wants to prevent.<br>  <br>  Also, are you sure you have the time to properly raise a pup since you have a 4 and 1 year old?  I would highly encourage you to consider adopting an older dog, even a senior dog.  You'll be saving a life and putting them back into a home environment that they remember.  Rescue dogs know when they've been given a second chance and most come with basic manners and commands, as well as being potty-trained.  Just a thought.<br>  <br>  And I wouldn't rule out larger dogs.  Small breeds, especially terriers, can have just as much piss and vinegar as large breed dogs, and it is a natural human tendency to baby smaller animals, making them neurotic and unmanageable, which will turn them into snappy little demons not safe for your children.<br>  <br>  Check out these websites with information about shelters in the UK:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogstrust.org.uk/rehoming/adopt_a_dog/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogstrust.org.uk/rehoming/ado...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogpages.org.uk/adopting.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogpages.org.uk/adopting.htm</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.animalrescuers.co.uk/html/dogs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.animalrescuers.co.uk/html/dog...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bluecross.org.uk/web/site/home/home.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.bluecross.org.uk/web/site/hom...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.k9media.net/dogsblogcom-uk-dog-adoption-project-sponsorship-pr-marketing-opportunity-3/" rel="nofollow">http://www.k9media.net/dogsblogcom-uk-do...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this is helpful to you!

Here's a site, <a href="http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/ryh" rel="nofollow">http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/ryh</a> consisting of shelter lists in the US. Check out the one nearest you. I believe contact numbers and emails are included on the site.|`|AA12310378	That site is fiull of scams.<br>   No one gives away a free purebred puppy and the ads that look like they might be genuine, as in the puppies exist and are in the UK, are for overpriced, poor quality specimens.<br>  No reputable breeder, rescue or shelter will rehome a puppy with a toddler in the house. They may let you have an older dog.<br>  <br>  Try www.dogpages.org.uk and see if anyone has a dog being fostered that is used to children or try the breed rescues.
uvU5DnHcaa	Question : Did she pass all 5 after births ? Very important that she does or she will die of  peritonitis or shock.<br>  She may have lost her bubs through toxemia. Toxemia can happen during pregnancy when they are giving all to the bubs and mainly in hot weather. <br>  It is common for sows who deliver still born babies to suffer post natal depression.<br>  <br>  First get her warm, give her a heat bag of even a hot water bottle and you need to get  her temp up again. <br>  Definitely give the bubs back to the other sow. Your sick sow needs serious attention now.<br>  Secondly she needs liquid Calcium orally twice daily of 5mls. more if she will take it . If not give her sugar water to make up to 8mls. Also Vit C orally twice daily of 5 mls.( blackcurrent juice if there is nothing else available)<br>  Being boofed up as you put it ( fluffed up ) is a sign that there is something seriously wrong. Being swollen after birthing is also a bad sign. If she lives through the night I would not hold out much hope on a good recovery. Something had gone wrong leading up to the birthing.<br>  For her to be so exhausted there was problems during delivery. <br>  Sometimes when the 1st one is breach it holds up the rest and they die. Usually the one thats breach also dies as she has had trouble with its delivery.<br>  <br>  All I can suggest is get the above fluids into her asap and keep her warm and comfortable. Then take her to the vet as soon as you possibly can.<br>  <br>  If she does pull through ok don't breed her again as she will not survive another litter. <br>  Good Luck sweetie.|`|nPdKJyK4aa	Aww I'm so sorry for your and your piggys loss. Breeding guinea pigs is very dangerious. Its best not to do it. It contributes to the over population, and its risky. I would agree with the other people that you should take her to the vet. Personally I would NOT wait. I know from personal experience that giving birth IS very hard, tiring and painful. Take good care of her and PLEASE dont breed any more guinea pigs.|`|JHQiIl34aa	Take her to the vet immediately! She might have internal bleeding or still have some babies in there or the placenta might be stuck!!! If she cant feed the babies i would see if the other mother will take them back but be careful she doesn't attack them, Otherwise it could be good for her to be suckling some young|`|k2vvT6glaa	take her to the vet!|`|rIIJuVkmaa	yeah vet|`|UmXBLDoIaa	it sounds like this would be normal but call the vet to make sure she is okay and what your doing is okay, if you do keep the babies with her remember to keep an eye out for her to make sure she is feeding them and handling them alright. did you take the babies away from a mom who was refusing to feed them? if so its fine for what you did, if you took all of her babies away and she was feeding them still give them back to the mother. All tho it is sad for her having all of her babies unborn so i think you are just worried sense she just had babies and i would take the mother and the babies you gave her and the babies real mom to the vet to make sure everything is okay<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ILJy90VTaa	for safety reasons, take her to the vet. but i wouldn't advise you to keep on taking out and touching the babies until two to three days after their birth. <br>  <br>  The swollen part could just be the result of giving birth. My friend's guinea pig was depressed and VERY tired after it gave birth, but a few weeks later the guinea pig was OK.|`|lsIHSdgeaa	That sounds completely normal (as per your descriptioN) if you are very worried i would suggest calling a vet to make sure.<br>  If i were you i would leave the 2 babies with her or otherwise she might start to stress. She would be exhausted form labor, if she is cold make sure where you are keeping her is warm with insulating bedding.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|DdK97Ixcaa	i would take her to the vet because this could be very serious<br>  i would also take the other guineas out of the cage, they are not hers and the other mom misses them :( and it is really not safe for them to be in the other cage with her.<br>  and feed her some vegitables and salt wheels, they love those things, also hold her  a lot to comfort her.|`|2oS5qZq3aa	well if that was my piggie i would take her to the vet immediately|`|GvxFdve3aa	the best thing is to take er to a vet but my gf is a vet so i learnt some stuff of her <br>  <br>  it somtimes happens to all animals when they are giving birth the babys die and the mother crys<br>  kk she probably had them in there for too long and they eventually died they the pain of all this stuff is really painfull to the pig so she desides to get them outa there as she does the dead piglets somehow manage to scratch her thingy cuz their dead and cannot think <br>  <br>  it should be fine in about a week or 2 if it doesnt get beeter then you should take her to a vet|`|hmXWk90waa	Hi, i know what your going through! my guinea pig had 5 babies 4 were dead but one was still alive and we tryed to keep it alive but it died at 4 months old where not sure why! but it was deformed a bit it had a broken leg. The mother was sad and stressed i just left her alone she had the one baby left but she didnt want it she was so tired she was running away from it. so it wouldnt feed off her we then spoon fed him and he was fine after that. my suggestion is keep the babies in there and take her to the vet and ask them what you should do!

ukq76i5Iaa	one of my many goldfish now had red spots on its body (near the tail). each day, there were more and more until i had to search for answers on the internet. the temperature in my tank was way too high for the poor goldfish (82degreesF!) so i transferred it to a 65degree pond. the pond was established while the tank was not. id guess your problem is either temperature or ammonia levels - id check both. the problem with temperature is that<br>  1. goldfish cant tolerate more than 68 degreesF<br>  2. a high temperature means a higher pH<br>  3. there is less DO (dissolved oxygen) in water with higher temperatures and your fish may not be getting enough oxygen<br>  im happy to say the goldfish is almost cured of those horrible red spots.<br>  get well soon to your goldfish :D|`|wnnudNp5aa	Sounds like Dropsy. You can cure that with Maracyn-two. Just follow the directions on the package and all will be well. Good luck!|`|c8DjmWXxaa	Red spots and streaks sound like septicaemia, caused by bad water quality and an ammonia spike.<br>  <br>  What size tank? How many fish? What are the water parameter readings? When was the last water change? Goldfish need surprisingly large tanks, ideally at least 20 gallons each for fancies with a filter suitable for double the volume of the tank.<br>  <br>  Do a 50% water change with de chlorinated water initially. You will need to treat with something like Maracyn 2, it may or may not work however.Septicaemia can be fatal. Improved water quality however can significantly help.<br>  ask your nearest fish supplier for help, like i said before you just need to de chlorinate the water, but once your fish have red spot, not all of them can recover.|`|a6j7Bu9daa	it sounds like a parasite, fish can get something called "ich" which is white spots. I just looked it up and you can treat the red spots the same way you would treat ich. <br>  <br>  Have a look for "kordons rid ich", i used it to treat my fish and after 2 weeks he was fine. There are loads of other treatments out there but i had good sucess using rid ich. Be warned tho that it does turn the silicon in your tank green, you may want to buy cheap tank to treat your fish in.|`|pyEvNC8Taa	i have a big gold fish<br>  it used to be red and once it went completely orange and guess what.. now it's white!! but it's still alive .. so nothing dangerous,, probably not the same as your fish though
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	If those "algae fish" were Chinese Algae Eaters, then what they were doing was entirely natural and is one of the #1 reasons they shouldn't be kept with Goldfish. Even Plecos can act this way once they've got a taste for Goldfish slime-coat. Goldfish need Goldfish-only tanks.<br>  <br>  Rehome the "algae fish". Chinese Algae Eaters in particular can get over 8" long, and often once they hit 4" they turn off greens entirely and will become quite predatory. There are also some species of Pleco that are not herbivorous and lead a carnivorous lifestyle!|`|d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	you have a few problems here.<br>  <br>  1. You have a hideously overcrowded tank. Even fish that are normally not aggressive will be so in an overstocked tank. get a MUCH bigger tank, or loose all but 2 of those fish. <br>  <br>  2. Your algae eaters are killing your orandas because they are literally STARVING. sucking the slime coat off a fish is only done if the algae eater is otherwise not able to get food. <br>  <br>  these are fish that need real veggies sunken to the bottom of the tank to feed on, as well as sinking wafers, and algae disks.|`|C7DOTjhqaa	Nothing's "wrong" with them; it's just a bad mix of fish!  Algae eaters are known to be aggressive, and they're not recommended in a tank of passive fish like orandas or goldfish.<br>  <br>  If you want to have goldfish, try a plecostomus or snail next time instead of the classic algae eaters.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6979bf0ecfe9ee379c6d4efa120ff381aa	Large algae eaters can get quite aggressive , when they are small they are content to eat algae , but as they grow they become meat eaters. The previous poster is right.

These dogs are very happy in apartment life and do not need long walks due to the amount of stamina this breed has.  They are also very loving family dogs, don't shed and are easy to train - very good with children**.<br>  <br>  Please note ALL dogs need walks.  Especially one that is kept in an apartment as you will have to let the dog out a few times in the day and evening so it can poop etc.<br>  <br>  **NO dogs should be left ALONE in the care of children - for the safety of your child.<br>  <br>  I would have a really good think about it, although good for you that you are researching what they right breed will suit you.

Maybe you could consider adopting an older dog that has already had a certain amount of training.<br>  <br>  If you get a pup and are not prepared for the training, you will find owning a dog a horrible, stressful experience.<br>  <br>  Negative point about toy poodles - they can be quite yappy, but this makes them a good alert dog.

Even if you have to cut it down etc. <br>  <br>  Your tank still sounds like its cycling anyway you should of really let it cycle and added fish about a month later, but you cant do anything now cus you have the fish have a look for a product called "tetra fresh start" and add this to your tank it contains bacteria that will help your aquarium cycle instantly.
AA12083992	Don't put her out or stand there with her. Walk her. Put a leash on her and take her for as walk. When she does pee outside throw a praise party.
