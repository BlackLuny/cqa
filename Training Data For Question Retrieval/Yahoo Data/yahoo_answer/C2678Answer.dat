UPTu7uIVaa	No, I've not had that problem since I started giving my 3 cats Greenies.  The kitten had a little diarrhea when I first got him, which got in his hair (all 3 have long hair).  I just cut it out, but I haven't had this problem since I started giving them these treats.|`|Zyb2MENKaa	I don't give my cat greenies, but I have had kittens that got fecies stuck in the hairs near their tail. Is it a long haired kitten? They sometimes get fecal materiel stuck in the long hair. Just clip the hairs there so that their shorter and the fecies shouldn't get stuck there anymore.    CATS MEOW, Chipmunk, and Penny|`|HMhUKAgkaa	I can't get any of my cats (I have 3) to eat greenies. Sorry. They do throw up a lot though and I hate it!|`|VrjF986Aaa	No I've never had that problem at all giving greenies to all 5 of my cats.|`|I6vMxEU9aa	Probably a messy kitten problem. Our adult cats, like yours, won't eat Greenies, so I can't say for sure. But some cats are just kinda gross. Our one cat is quite gassy, and her bottom always smells. She's sweet as pie, but just not good with hygiene.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	My cats love them and they have had no problems with them.|`|AA10859773	You've got the right idea to stop them and see if things change.  Although I don't use these treats and haven't heard about them being a problem, it's quite possible they're the cause.    Since your kitty is eating Purina, then it seems unlikely that it's a grain sensitivity, unless it's to a particular one that doesn't happen to be in that food but is in the Greenies.  Or maybe it's a different ingredient, or just some combo that doesn't work for her.

9dcuaJeEaa	I am sorry for your loss. It is so hard saying goodbye. (Ignore the insensitive comments you have had.)  I would bury your cat in your garden (if you own it, don't do it in a rented property as if you move, someone may discover your pet in years to come.)  Or take the body to your vets to have him/her cremated. I had my dog cremated and I sprinkled her ashes in her favorite spot in the garden and a little on the beach.  Again I'm sorry. Hope this helps.....|`|VMY7No0eaa	Sorry for your loss. (I ans your other question)  I always bury them in my back yard and either plant a plant over them or put a stepping stone.  just wrap in cotton cloth rather than putting in a box.    I am really sorry your cat died...|`|d5ug5W5kaa	Bury him/her. I am sorry.|`|4dntstR9aa	You could put him in a box as a makeshift coffin and bury him|`|nPuZVGFRaa	Bury it somewhere you can go see him.. Or get its ashes cremated and put them under your bed... Unless you didn't like your cat|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	You can either bury it at home or take it to the Vet and they may offer cremation services if you want your cats ashes back.  If that's the way you want to go, call them first for prices...it can be expensive.|`|2pjRC0Kkaa	Well animals bodies are very important to keep. Now I don't mean keep in your house but somewhere safe like in a back/front yard. Bury your cat and just put some flowers and a big rock with his/her name on it. Just like a human, you should probably put it in a wooden box. Not card board because they dissolve in the rain easily. Don't just throw it away because when that shows you did not appreciate your cat or its body. If you bury your cat's body it shows it you loved it and respect him or her. So don't think for just one second that just because its dead it not imprtant!! Since the cat is dead its now just a dead body and spirit is probably floating somewhere around, but still give the body love and show love to it. Animal bodies deserve just as much as human bodies do. So make a funeral with your family, put some good-bye card you mad and put those things in the box with your cat. Or you can put your cat's toys in along with it too. Im really sorry! I know what it's like to loose a very cute and loving animal.    R.I.P|`|l3L5eYj4aa	Have it stuffed and mounted!|`|tE7lqUfoaa	you can Berry it if it was a well known and loved cat  if not just throw it in the trash|`|TiAK1629aa	Bury it in a nice place at the least.  I personally would have it cremated and put in a nice urn.|`|3yt0aeLLaa	Most vets or your local animal shelter or SPCA branch will be able to dispose of the body for you.|`|3FOmoaUZaa	Bury it or take it to a pet cremation service place. If u take it to the vet to be disposed of, they will put it n a body bag and throw it n the garbage. I worked at a vet clinic, and that's what we did. I always have my animals "planted"- I plant a tree on top of or next to the grave.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	A vet can arrange cremation, and you can get the ashes back for however you wish to memorialize your beloved departed cat.    If allowed in your area, and you have the room on your property, you can bury your cat.  If there is room, it is often suggested that you simply do it without advertising the fact.    This is never a comfortable situation, and there are no real solutions, only options.    An animal shelter can also guide you on cremation.|`|jHWEEZmCaa	don't rape it|`|LuPK5Skkaa	Freeze it and save it for later.
e2HW9iQ5aa	Exactly how did this vet determine there was "nothing wrong"? Was a FULL blood workup done? Urinalysis? A second opinion is a good idea. If YOU were sick, and your doctor said, "there's nothing wrong with you" wouldn't you see another doctor for a second opinion?    Also, how do you KNOW it's not the food?? It's possible it's a food allergy or reaction to something in the food like Gluten.|`|WFRVSU7eaa	Maybe she is was given something that makes her sick. Try taking her to an emergency vet or even calling your local pet store (ask for the experts if your calling the pet store) ask for an expert on like domestic animals like cats and dogs preferably.|`|x3o7cO7uaa	Maybe you should bring her to a better vet!!    XxSkyxX|`|bYPfFCr4aa	take her to other vet's to as one cannot fine a true thing for ur cat  so today u r gona take dnt go for money|`|WrUTuQdlaa	Get better cat food, or make your own (chicken-and assorted veggies).|`|45e02f98828bf1f1f04987f503111641aa	Taking your kitty to a different vet is a good idea. You should also look around your home for things she may be eating and making her sick. Do you have any potted plants in your home? Cats have a tendency to eat leaves on their owners flowers which can be very toxic. Some cats also eat non food items which can make them sick too. I would keep a close eye on her when your home and make sure she's not doing just that. If you don't see her getting into anything while you are home, put her in a cage when you leave or at night because she may be doing it when your not around. Did your vet do any x-rays or blood tests? I would have this done if the problem continues. Have it done by a vet that will actually listen to you and cares about making your kitty better. Good luck
khraNCphaa	guppys  platies  swordtails|`|oDmhyNJmaa	pacu, they are however a little hard to find. if not, try to get the tinyest cichlid you can find. I find that they (cichlids and pacu) grow faster on a diet of bloodworms than on a diet of flates, sticks, etc.|`|RTQZKJsHaa	You should obtain a clown loach.  In their early form, they're maybe 3-5 inches long but can grow up to a foot long.  Plus, they're really fun to observe thus their name.  : )|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Ya fish growth can't really be that drastic that fast. Just a regular old common goldfish or an Oscar or Jack Dempsey Cichlid will grow fast. You may get some results but not as much as you listed here. As always the fasted way to grow a fish is keep perfect water and Temperature of 80 degrees and feed twice a day. This will however not be possible unless the tank is cycled because that much food in a newly set up tank will kill the fish for sure. Even is you are able to keep the Ammonia,Nitrite and Nitrate in check the fish wil still be stressed and not grow as fast as he could.     Good Luck though|`|Qhdozm54aa	Most fish will take a lot longer than a month or two to grow to adult size, growth will depend on factors such as tank size, water quality and diet. To be honest I don't think you'll find any fish that grow at such an incredible rate.
Ws2QPD0Iaa	1. Gerbils are very playful!  They are so much fun to have around, and should never bite.  They are very funny and cute and love to be handled.    2. They don't poop nearly as much as hamsters or other rodents.  They are very neat, and they take a long time for their cage to stink.  They won't smell unless you don't clean their cage, otherwise they don't smell at all.    3. You should definatley get a pair of same sex gerbils.  Gerbils do not like to be alone, but make sure that you get 2 same sex gerbils from the same litter so they don't fight.    4. Gerbils don't take regular baths, but they do take sand baths.  You get a small bucket/bin and put some sand in it.  The gerbils will roll around and it is very good for their coats.  Not to mention, they really enjoy it!    5.They can drink tap.  Pretty simple to care for.    6.Gerbils shouldn't bite.  That is why they are much better pets for kids than hamsters because they rarely ever bite unless threatened.  However, you are much better off buying from a breeder instead of a pet store, because pet store gerbils sometimes bite due to improper handling.  Google AGS and they have a list of reputable gerbil breeders.  I breed gerbils if you are in the New England area!    7. They love anything they can get into.  However, they also LOVE to chew, so don't buy anything plastic.  You are best off just using old toilet paper rolls, because they will eventually eat them anyways.    8. Either get 2 males, or 2 females.  Gender doesn't really matter, they are all friendly.  I love males though, sometimes they seem a little sweeter.    9.They LOVE sunflower seeds and roasted peanut bits =]    10. I would just get a gerbil.  They bite less, smell less, and live longer.  They are also a lot more sociable and fun.|`|SzGyWKsPaa	1. Gerbils are energetic, but not necessarily the kinds of pets you can play with like a rat or dog.    2. They poop a bit, but don't stink too much. They're desert animals, which means they require less water. Less water = less urine. Less urine = less smell. I can easily go 2 weeks without changing my gerbil's bedding, and it still smells very little.    3. You should get two of the same gender. Gerbils are social and should be kept in same sex pairs.    4. No water baths. They can, however, take sand baths. You can get chinchilla SAND at the pet store. Powder is okay, but it's finer than sand and can more easily irritate their little noses.    5. They can drink tap water as long as your tap water is safe to drink. I wouldn't give my gerbils water I wouldn't drink myself.    6. Gerbils are, generally, very friendly. They shouldn't bite much, but of course, you'll have to tame them. As for scratching, not too much. They may scratch the corner of their cage/tank often, though, if they don't have stuff to keep them busy.    7. Sure, but no plastic. They can and will chew it up. If ingested, it can cause a blockage. They also love digging their own tunnels. Provide lots of aspen shavings for them to do this.    8. Both males and females are wonderful. There isn't too much of a difference. Males tend to be more laid back, larger, and have obvious testicles. Females tend to be more active, smaller, and more aggressive if kept in trios and more. Males are easier to keep in large groups. Males tend to scent mark more with the scent gland on their stomach, but it's not really that big of a deal. You probably won't notice.    9. Each gerbil has their own preference. Just find out what your gerbils will like. Be sure it's safe for them to eat, though!    10. I would recommend you research all three and choose the one that best fits your lifestyle, the care you can provide, and what you're looking for in a pet. A gerbil is not the pet for everyone, just as a hamster or mouse isn't either. Not every pet will be the one for you.
sUN7TVtzaa	yeah we bred a 6 1/2 inch female with a 8 1/2 inch male they can even live together with out a problem good luck!|`|c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	The issue I'd have is with the male being too aggressive with the female when breeding.  But that can happen with any pair.  As long as you're supervising them in the beginning and keeping an eye on them throughout the breeding, they should be fine.|`|2opWeKQBaa	Uuhm... not really sure, but i don't think it's a good idea...the giant might kill the female heh... so watch them very closely all day and i mean ALL DAY for at least a single day. if they fight, it's not gonna work, plus what if the giant's hemipenis doesn't fit in the normal sized female?

Not ones that go around peeing on every tree to be the one with the only correct answer and not ones ready to demean another person to better themselves.

40IUKsC2aa	Cowfish are slow moving fish due to their body shape. They protect themselves by releasing a toxin. Because they can't escape the confines of the aquarium if a cowfish becomes stressed it may release this toxin poisoning themselves and your other fish in the process. In addition, if it dies the toxin will be released. If your cowfish becomes ill you should move it into a tank by itself.   here is some info  http://www.petinfo4u.com/cowfish.htm  http://www.aboutfishonline.com/articles/...|`|hz0I0zFWaa	Cow-fish are easy going laid back fish. Cleaning your tank will not cause it to release it's poison.|`|Qhdozm54aa	The Cowfish's defensive mechanism of releasing toxin is usually triggered by stress, so long as you keep the water quality within acceptable limits and avoid fluctuations it should be fine. Cowfish can grow pretty big, up to 50cm, so you will need at least a 7ft tank once it is fully grown. The diet of this fish should consist of small, meaty foods such as whitefish, cockles and shrimp.|`|6L0tVhn7aa	Maybe you should have a bit more patience and wait for people to post on your other question of the same subject...

50azgKE8aa	Well a big part of it is like you said the breed has a bad name.  But let me tell you something there is nothing wrong with the breed itself.  But what people have used the breed for in the past.  The pit bulls mouth opens wider then a normal dogs mouth which is why people use them for watch dogs and such, they can bite people or other animals and do a lot more damage then a normal dog.  But my advice to you would be to do research on how to proerly train and treat a pit bull.  Thenif your family and friends still have an issue get into breeddynamics and history with them explain why they have a bad name and if they're trained properly then there is nothing to worry about|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	The myths have gone so far that the media makes people buy into it. I have an American Pit Bull Terrier myself, she came from an abusive case, but she is the sweetest dog out of my 3, once you pet her she will not leave you alone.|`|PGkbPBZmaa	Is your dog licensed? If not, you can get a dog license (it's illegal not too) for pretty cheap. There isn't much else they can do about it. Prove them wrong!|`|aDl1kZa6aa	Prove them wrong then! train him, love him and look after him and it'll be fine. Simple :)|`|MHW8j3rqaa	Sorry Pit Bulls are an insane breed of dog to commit to.  You were asking for trouble the day you decided to get one.  To bad you didn't  think of that before you made your decision.  Good luck with the neighbours.....you'll need it!|`|pFBaMlI8aa	most people stereotype pit bulls for being violent, aggressive, and dangerous. this is because the pit bull is one of the most energetic and exercise-needing breeds of dog today. since most people who adopt a pit bull are not prepared to take on the immense responsibility of caring for a pit bull (as in giving him TONS of exercise), the dog will need exercise constantly and will not be getting it, so to relieve this need for physical activity, the dog will act "crazy" around the house, running around, tearing up furniture, chewing on everything (tearing furniture and chewing are common side effects of lack of exercise for any type of dog), and the owner will obviously not know what to do since they were not prepared for this type of dog anyway, and either put him in a crate for most of the day, (which makes it worse), punish the dog, or put him outside on a chain. obviously, putting him in a crate is a very bad solution to the problem, punishing the dog is like putting a kid in their room for eating a lot of dinner if they didn't have any lunch, which is punishing natural needs and therefore would be done constantly, and putting the dog outside for most of the time is another bad idea, because even though he could run and dig out in the yard all he wanted, he wouldn't get any love or affection from his owner either, which is vital to a dog's happiness and well-being. as a result, the dog will get bad-tempered, depressed, and even start biting people, which is what people think all pit bulls' personalities are like.    so the problem is not with the pit bull that is aggressive, the problem is with the owner not meeting the needs of their dog. pit bulls that have been trained, exercised very often, and loved are some of the sweetest and most loyal dogs. most people just haven't seen or heard about these cases (the media only reports attacks), so subsequently they will think all pit bulls are like this. just make sure you exercise your pit bull enough, and give him lots of love - he might even change your neighbors' minds about pit bulls (at least yours anyway).|`|efc1sXwWaa	The public perception regarding Pitbulls is locked in place. When you purchase an APBT or Amstaff, this is what you will deal with, forever. No matter how freindly your dog is, if it ever gets lose, it will be proclaimed a menace.   When you get a dog of this breed you have also taken on the life long task of educating and you better have a thick skin.     I'm sorry, but honestly, you had to have known this was going to happen.     Many moons ago I used to show Amstaffs (APBT in a tux) and after my last show dog passed, I did not get another one, mainly because public sentiment was becoming increasingly hostile and I just did not want to deal with it. Beyond the fact that the breed was starting to attract thugs that perpetuated the problem.     Well, opinions are set, you will spend the rest of your dogs life defending it, no use getting bitter, just smile and plow forward.
VDP3pNCPaa	Well, I wouldn't get hung up on a specific diagnosis.  The more typical diagnosis is that he is being a jerk.    There are ways of getting him into legal problems for what he is doing, especially shooting blue jays.  Squirrels are often classified as pests but birds are a different issue.    You will have to decide if you want to escalate the matter.  There is a question as whether there is someone close to him that you can talk to about trying to redirect his behavior.    If I were in the same situation when that talk came up, I would firmly state the conversation is inappropriate, and try and direct it away from what he is on.  The problem is none of us have a choice when it comes to family. We are stuck.  Only you can decide if you want to sever it more than you already have.|`|AA12398420	Normally, when people talk like that (how they do terrible things) I just ignore it, but if it comes to abusing animals or children I don't. I let them know they are breaking the law and then I will report them if I have evidence.  I do not hold back on things like that and I don't care who it is. I beat my brother up once for torturing a frog when we were kids.   People like that you cannot talk to and the only thing that will stop them is to turn them in. So please do the right thing and be a voice for the animals...turn him in so that he won't hurt any more animals.|`|mRevWUxlaa	He sounds like my ex husband. Yes, I would have spoken up. Snaps for you!!!!!!|`|jgw1buUAaa	yes i would have said something. I LOVE cats and i wouldn't tolerate that kind of talk. Even if it were only the blue jays and squirrels, that's unacceptable. I am an animal lover and i would have the guy on some serious meds or something!|`|AA11935999	"I WOULD DEFINITELY SPEAK TO HIM"!:(  "AND THEN I WOULD KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON HIM AROUND ANIMALS, CHILDREN, AND THE ELDERLY"!:O  "YOUR FATHER HAS SOME SERIOUS ISSUES"!:O     (=^v^=)|`|YAwvszITaa	You did the right thing and he should be grateful that you even see him on those ocassions.|`|4TX26viFaa	Any of those actions would have gotten him arrested and charged with animal abuse.  The guy's an idiot.  I'd have as little contact as possible if it were me.      Is he seeing a professional for medical help?  It's scary to think this guy is out and semi-functional in society without moral restraints on his actions.|`|VwJ7o3ORaa	I would defiantly speak up...|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	He sounds like quite the sicko to me.Also,it is against the law to shoot blue jays.If I were you,I would report him.And I had two uncles ( by marriage only,thank God) who used to enjoy talking about how they would shoot or run over cats on purpose and I let them know that I did not approve and I avoided talking to them after that.I feel that people who enjoy torturing small,defenseless animals are also a potential danger to humans. But yes,I have and would speak up.
AA11618088	As you know, toy dogs are family oriented dogs.  You are looking at leaving the dog alone for roughly 8 hours every day + the time you are spending with your boyfriend.  This is not fair to the dog.  Find a doggie day care and get him in there.  Some are as inexpensive as $5 a day and chances are your furbaby will love it!  : )|`|6Yf6Jh7Faa	chihuahuas are extreamly social dogs and they will (I know this sounds silly) get mad at you and retaliate.    they will tear up everything, pee on the floor, bark, and anything else they could possibly do to get your attention and give them attention.  wether the attention be good or bad it doesn't matter to them.

He could devolp a thing called "seperation anxiety" this is were your dog can not STAND for u to be gone for long periods of time and will result in very very VERY bad behavior such as tearing up ANYTHING doing things he knows are wrong etc. My suggestion would to be live him with some1 who can check on him periodically such as a dog walker or pet sitter. work u cant really help but you could make your boyfriend come to your house? if not take the dog with you and on the weekends its ALL ABOUT THE DOG! lol|`|NrKL62I4aa	It may be bad for him. He may love you just as much as you love him and he might become ill of missing you so much. But it doesn't sound like your gone for long periods of time. So he should be okay. But make sure to give him lots of love!

OyNJTWaiaa	I recall you saying before you had a young first time Mum in an aviary with other birds.   Distraction from others will stop a hen staying with her nestbox. For instance if other birds sit in top of her nestbox and stop her coming and going to her chicks.   If she is too young and silly she wont be a good parent also. She must be older than 12 months for successful breeding.  Interference with her nestbox from you looking too may be a cause she wont go back to the nestbox. Its OK to check and you should when there are chicks of course but not too much.   If you work out other birds are the problem ...remove them.  If its her being too young then that should have been a consideration before beginning to try and breed.   You may contact me for more help of you like....and try my budgie forum for additional help  http://forums.budgiebreeders.asn.au

NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    When you first bring home a hamster, no matter what type (and Logan H, there are 5 "breeds" of pet hamsters, not one) you should let them settle into their cage for a full week.    They've just been moved to a new cage in a new place and they're surrounded by new smells and sounds.    It's cool to reach in to feed them and give them water.  But skip any treats or fresh food for the first week.     Once you're ready for the first weekly cage cleaning, start trying the steps below and you should be ready to rock :)    First thing I'd like to say to everyone is that ALL hamsters bite, they've only been "pets" since the 1930s so they're still quite wild.  Although a good breeder breeds for color and characteristics, they also breed for temperement and when you get an animal from a pet store - you're playing hamster roulette - so please don't say "All dwarfs are evil little biters and Syrians (Teddy Bear, Golden, Panda) hamsters are so much sweeter and nicer!    I've helped a lot of pet owners with handling over the years, and this is great for dwarf (any of the 4 breeds) or Syrian (aka Teddy Bear, Golden, Panda, etc)!    Remember to never wake your hamster up to play! They'll be calmer if they've been running in their wheel for a while as well, and lastly, just like a human -- they may not be in the mood to play some days!    1. Wash your hands carefully with a non-fruity or heavily scented soap - this will keep them from wanting to taste, and possibly bite your hand.  Others may advise you to wear gloves - this prevents the hamster from learning your scent, and you want them to know YOU when you're handling them, not the smells on a glove.    2. NEVER reach into the hamster cage and try to *grab* your hamster. Hamsters are quite protective of their homes and will try to defend them (aka bite you or flip over and scream -- which is a defense mechanism). Females tend to be more "cage aggressive" than males, although with time and patience, this will diminish with either one.    3. Hold a small cup or bowl in front of the cage door with a yummy treat in it - the hamster will crawl in almost every time.    4. Slide the lil guy out of the cup/bowl into your hand - and voila! You're holding your hamster and haven't been bitten!    Be careful as they will be a bit skittish (and dwarfs are little speed demons so it may try to run up your arm). Of course you'll want to be sure to be extra gentle as they are still animals and can bite when they get scared!  They may also lick/nibble your fingers, don't mistake this for biting, it just means they're curious.  Nibbling tickles - biting hurts ;)    Once your hamster gets more accustomed to you and how you smell, you'll be able to skip step 3 and they'll crawl right into your hand.    Best of luck - and if you'd like any additional help, please feel free to contact me, I'm open to questions anytime :)    Daisy|`|TrEDiWR7aa	play with it and make it feel at home but dont handle it too much it needs time to get used to things so leave it alone the first day|`|1oCUMOW7aa	for the first few days dont ti=ouch it. but talk to it. you want it to get used to its cage and THEN you.

27d2fe79dd9df7b907483b0eb75c1a39aa	I would think the presence of blood tells you what to do.  It may not be an emergency but a professional needs to see the pet.  No one can tell you anything here without seeing the pet.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Well... If I were to see a dog coughing up blood.. I would be concerned.. I would think either something was very wrong, or she had gotten something stuck in her throat... Then I would think ... You know what, this sounds like a job for Super Vet! He knows what to do... Then I would be out the door and on my way and with his super powers, he could fix my dog.. You should do the same thing.|`|LPEO6AsCaa	Well I would think this is a no brainier!  Get the dog to the vets.  She may have a ulcer of a obstruction in the throat or many other things.<br>  Your vet needs to see her right away.|`|6bd707c77ee82c3124346483484e89daaa	take it to the vet.  was she coughing for a while before there was blood?  it might just be something as simple as really bad kennel cough and the lungs are just irritated.|`|MaYQWweqaa	check out the answers in the question   Bringing up blood below yours.|`|f3azIGajaa	Coughing up blood can be deadly and should be treated as an emergency. Get the dog tot he vet ASAP!!!!!!!! Good Luck.|`|K9JjqV1Baa	oh my. BRING HER TO SEE A VET!!!!  since she's coughing  out blood you should seek professional help and see what's wrong with her. get help asap , the earlier the better! the vet would tell you should do after examining jecica. go now!|`|Z7W3oLvJaa	call a vet, your dog could have an ulcer, or swallowed something that cut her digestive tract, either way you need to seek help soon|`|d017f58bb532745b0e4bd7b62f98a7fdaa	There is only 1 responsible thing to do right now,... take her to your vet.  How long has this been going on? What is her age? Does she have a heart condition? What does she eat? Where does she live? Has she been exposed to a bordetella virus? Has she ever been dewormed? Does she swim in rivers, lakes or ponds? Probably the most important question for your sake is, How far are you able/can you afford to investigate this?  Your vet may want to do bloodwork, radiographs, a fecal, or an Echocardiogram or ECG, place her in hospital on IV fluids.  In an ideal world, there would be federally funded pet health, but since there is not, you will have to decide how much you can spend.  It is a sad question, but if you cannot afford to find out or fix her, then perhaps you may need to consider putting her down.  I would strongly suggest having a vet take a look at her first, don't let her life go for fear of what it will cost, find out first! Good luck, and I hope she gets better.<br>  Just so you get an idea,... here are some things it 'could' be (there is no way for me to know what it is, only a vet who has actually seen her can tell you that)<br>  -cardiac complications<br>  -heartworm<br>  -bordetella<br>  -lungworm<br>  -IMHA<br>  -collapsed Lung<br>  -cancer<br>  -severe pancreatitis<br>  please let a veterinarian help you to help her.|`|f80d9e0a1ca43a70bccd66d09d0037d0aa	TAKE HER TO THE VET A.S.A.P.!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sry bout that...|`|tJMTlzGRaa	Get off the computer and get her to the vet. It may not be serious but it is better safe than sorry.
AA10029366	Physically the dog can still breed, yes. However, mismarked color over a certain point is a disqualification in the Cocker Spaniel Standard <a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/cocker_spaniel/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/breeds/cocker_spaniel...</a><br>  <br>  If your breeder doesn't think the dog should be bred, you should listen to them.

The dogs are there because of people who want to breed their dogs "just because" or because they think this is an easy way to make a few bucks. Why would you want to add to the problem by deliberately breeding a dog that you've been told is not a good representative of the breed?|`|eb5f016fa5e5a78ae050b186fe276dddaa	No!you can still breed her just make sure you know people who would want the puppies first,<br>  and make sure shes not like 6 months old...did you want kids when you were 10?|`|wd3YtSAzaa	Never heard anything about not being able to breed a dog with bad markings. Personally that doesn't make sense. Do u want to bred the dog becuz if u bought the dog for that reason and u knew it then I don't know what to say but I don't believe it. If you did want to bred it make sure whoever ur breeding the dog with is aware of what ur dof looks like. Becuz they usually want the pick of the litter. See no problem, honestly.
3t2TLHcJaa	ogni quattro mesi e non prima...se riesci anche ogni sei mesi, perchè è molto meglio per lui...<br>  in compenso, puoi passargli salviettine igieniche ed un panno inumidito con acqua e aceto!!!<br>  <br>   Bagno e pulizia<br>  <br>  Quanto spesso bisogna fare il bagno al nostro cane? Un cane sporco o dal cattivo odore ci porta a dire che avrebbe proprio bisogno di un bagno! <br>  Una cosa basilare è spazzolare il pelo tutti i giorni, togliendo così lo strato di polvere che vi si è depositato. <br>  Lavare spesso il cane è controproducente perché la patina che si forma lo protegge dagli agenti esterni, per esempio dal freddo. <br>  Alcuni cani come gli Scottish Terrier, tendono ad avere la pelle sporca per un accumulo di forfora, e possono aver bisogno di un bagno ogni due-quattro settimane. Se questo diventa un problema, consultate il vostro veterinario. <br>  E' bene far precedere sempre la toelettatura al bagno, altrimenti potreste rendere i nodi ancora peggiori. <br>  Non usate mai un detersivo per la casa ne un sapone disinfettante; la pelle di molti cani reagisce male a queste sostanze.<br>  Potete usare un sapone leggero per uso umano, ma è meglio uno shampoo per cani o uno per bambini. <br>  Potete usare la vasca da bagno, purchéla laviate bene dopo l'uso. Lo shampoo secco è eccellente per una rapida pulizia. <br>  E' una polvere usata per asportare l'eccesso di sebo della pelliccia, un po' sporca o con cattivo odore. <br>  Esso ravviva il colore del pelo ed il talco in esso contenuto intensifica le zone bianche. Cospargete bene la polvere nel mantello e spazzolatela via. Successivamente non usate spazzole di setole sintetiche. <br>  Procuratevi l'aiuto di qualcuno che possa tenere fermo il cane mentre lo lavate. Togliete il collare e mettete il cane nella vasca. Usando la doccia o una brocca bagnategli la schiena e poi anche i fianchi. <br>  Mettete un po' di shampoo sulla schiena e fatelo penetrare strofinando e procedendo verso la parte posteriore del cane e giù per le gambe. Lavate la testa per ultima, stando attenti a non far entrare lo shampoo negli occhi. Al cane verrà sicuramente voglia di scrollarsi !!! <br>  Ora risciacquate accuratamente il cane dalla testa alla parte posteriore. Tamponatelo con un asciugamano e se siete all'aria aperta d'estate fatelo correre e poi spazzolatelo. <br>  D'inverno, asciugate il con un asciugamano e tenetelo in un luogo caldo affinché si asciughi completamente, altrimenti potrebbe prendere freddo. <br>  Potete usare un asciugacapelli, ma con molta prudenza le prime volte: il rumore e la sensazione del calore possono spaventare il cane. <br>  <br>   <br>    <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Questo articolo vi dà molte informazioni su come lavare, toelettare e spazzolare il vostro cane. La pazienza e la delicatezza sono importantissimi durante questi trattamenti! <br>  <br>   Lavaggio. <br>  è una buona idea aver preparato tutto l'occorrente per lavare il vostro cane prima di iniziare a bagnarlo, perché probabilmente tenterà di sottrarsi all'operazione! Quindi preparate la zona dove laverete il vostro cane con tutta l'attrezzatura necessaria anche per asciugarlo.<br>  I cani devono essere lavati solo quando sono decisamente sporchi o conformemente al parere del vostro veterinario. Assicuratevi sempre di fare questo con delle temperature esterne gradevoli, oppure fatelo all'interno di casa, per evitar loro freddo eccessivo. Usate solo prodotti specifici per cani, mai bagni schiuma o shampoo per umani né detergenti.<br>  Ogni volta che lavate il vostro cane, anche la sua cuccia dovrebbe essere lavata, ad intervalli comunque frequenti.<br>  Riempite una vasca con dell'acqua calda ed assicuratevi di avere un altro contenitore, sempre pieno d'acqua calda, per il risciacquo.<br>  Assicuratevi di avere un vecchio asciugamano pulito pronto per asciugare il cane una volta finito e, secondo la razza, un phon.<br>  <br>  Alzate delicatamente il cane e depositatelo nella vasca. Non tentate di fare questo da soli se il vostro cane è pesante, ma fatevi dare un aiuto. Iniziate versando l'acqua calda sopra il cane, partendo dal collo verso il basso, tenendo per ultima la testa.<br>  Passate ad insaponare con lo shampoo il corpo e le zampe, assicurandovi che lo shampoo permei bene il mantello e faccia adeguata schiuma. La testa dovrebbe essere fatta per ultima, assicurandovi che lo shampoo non entri in occhi e orecchie. Risciacquate poi con acqua calda versandola sempre dal collo verso il basso. Abbiate cura di ripetere questa operazione più volte per eliminare tutto lo shampoo dal corpo.<br>  Il vostro cane probabilmente si agiterà durante l'operazione e rimuoverà la maggior parte dell'acqua dal corpo scrollandosi vigorosamente. Usate il vecchio asciugamano per eliminare l'acqua rimanente. Potrete completare l'asciugatura utilizzando un phon ad una temperatura adeguata, utilizzando contemporaneamente una spazzola per velocizzare l'asciugatura. <br>  <br>  Spazzolatura dei cani a pelo corto. <br>  I cani a pelo corto hanno bisogno di essere spazzolati almeno una volta alla settimana, in funzione dello stato del loro mantello. Utilizzate una spazzola speciale, che potrete trovare in ogni negozio per animali, ed un pettine. Per cani di grossa taglia, è suggerito posizionarli su di un tavolo o un supporto per facilitarne la spazzolatura. Per i cani piccoli, farli sedere sulle proprie ginocchia può essere il modo migliore.<br>  Spazzolate il pelo verso l'esterno con l'aiuto del pettine, partendo dalla testa e proseguendo per tutto il corpo, la coda e le zampe. Prestate particolare attenzione al pelo irto del collo, specialmente in alcune razze come i Labrador. Una volta che avrete completato il mantello, passate alla spazzola per rimuovere il pelo in eccesso. <br>  <br>  Spazzolatura dei cani a pelo lungo. <br>  I cani a pelo lungo necessitano di maggiore attenzione riguardo la spazzolatura, che dovrebbe essere eseguita almeno due-tre volte alla settimana, lasciando trascorrere dei brevi lassi di tempo tra un trattamento e l'altro.<br>  Utilizzando sempre il pettine e la spazzola, e ricordando come posizionare il cane in funzione della sua taglia, partite dalla testa e scendete poi sul corpo, la coda e le zampe. Sollevate il mantello anche per spazzolare il sottopelo, facendo attenzione a rimuovere il pelo morto. Questa operazione vi permetterà di controllare anche lo stato di salute della pelle e verificare l'eventuale presenza di parassiti o di infezioni. Una volta conclusa l'operazione, ripassate il pettine per verificare che tutto il pelo in eccesso sia stato rimosso. <br>  <br>  Cuccioli. <br>  Il procedimento è uguale a quello dei cani adulti; la cosa più importante mentre laverete e spazzolerete il vostro cucciolo, sarà la vostra delicatezza. Se il cucciolo si ricorda questa operazione come un qualcosa di sgradevole, diventerà più difficile lavarlo successivamente. Potete utilizzare anche con il vostro cucciolo pettine, spazzola, phon e uno shampoo delicato adatto a lui.<br>  <br>  Ricordatevi che i cuccioli dovranno essere spazzolati in maniera dolce e delicata. Normalmente i cuccioli necessitano di una spazzolatura alla settimana, in funzione dello stato del mantello.|`|I4kenM7Saa	quello piccolo lo lavo ogni settimana (entra nel lavandino).<br>  Il pit bull (a meno che non si sia rotolato nel fango o peggio) una volta al mese! ^^|`|fd3fe256fc788817fa1d5008dfb55444aa	meno possibile senno' gli si sciupa il sottopelo che gli fa da protezione naturale, puoi ovviare con delle bagnature fatte con un asciugamano bagnato acqua e aceto che toglie la polvere e l odore di cane|`|xEo1I42waa	una volta al mese, salvo che si inzozzino in maniere assurda...<br>  hanno la fortuna di non sudare,perciò non occorre lavarlo sempre, sono solo problemi di pelo|`|0ot0O3BLaa	ti consiglio il giusto indispensabile!<br>  ossia il meno possibile!|`|244de8ec86e1407099265d241dabb866aa	Una volta ogni due mesi è sufficiente.

Basta un'energica spazzolata regolarmente tutti i giorni, due volte nel periodo della muta.<br>  Il fatto che a volte dia cattivo odore, dipende anche dall' alimentazione. Evita di dargli alimenti non adatti.<br>  Per una maggiore protezione, come tutti gli animali, del resto, è preferibile non tosarli  perchè hanno un ricambio naturale del pelo, la muta, e facendolo li esponiamo a eritemi e scottature dovute dal sole.

Infatti il pelo del cane è pressocchè autopulente: una volta che la terra si secca, viene via come niente!dipende poi dal tipo di pelo. Cani come il bovaro delle fiandre andrebbe( e dico andrebbe, poi prima o poi è inevitabile) lavato senza usare alcun tipo di shampi o saponi, perchè lo standard prevede un pelo opaco e gli shampi lo renderebbero lucido..i cani con sottopelo folto invece, basterebbe essere lavato due volte l'anno per aiutarlo con la muta..insomma..riserva il bagno solo in casi strettamente necessari(è proprio ricoperto di fango OVUNQUE, si è rotolato in una cacca, ecc..)per il resto, shampo a secco una volta a settimana. ciaooooo|`|b6c1d4e24f7a034e5b385874381651cfaa	Dipende dal tipo di cane, ci sono quelli che producono più sebo e quindi puzzano di più, e se lo tieni in casa o fuori.

e0af25a7a52f26cb654683cd39018a7faa	You haven't really bonded with your bird and that can only happen when she comes to you outside of her cage.

Good luck!|`|e5f04ca3c3014e50e1934956f32f941faa	She may come around, but then there is a chance that she never will.  I had two parakeets.  Both had very different personalities.  One was very social and loving and funny.  The other was distant and skittish and hated people in general.  Neither of them ever changed their personalities.|`|lLjDfc6laa	Sounds like a woman I once knew......face it, you're doomed to pander to this birds every whim with never any thanks, never any gratitude.

Then, she'll probably know that you ARE a good person to be around. Then after a while, decrease the amount of treats every few days, and she'll probably like you. But I am not an expert or anything, so, I am just spittin' out ideas.
z604ZWimaa	Dangerous!!! Your parakeet's beak is very strong and can easily break the beads and choke. Always buy a reccommended toy.  Old keys make a good toy, and remember not to put too many toys at once. They are often frightened of them at first so it is best to do one at a time. When he seems bored remove old toy and put new one in same spot. And wait for him to get used to that.  They like toys with feathers, it gives them a "buddy" to groom if they are alone.  Also mirrors for birds are veyry popular too. Gives them a reflective companion.|`|4cf35c900baf2aa599f838360f31396eaa	VERY dangerous!

8c4a38a8ce3faf7a19cef1661742500daa	Common in Cocker Spaniels - even those raised with lots of loving care. The best thing to do is to ask your guests not to even look at the dog as they come in. Let your guests get settled in (seated somewhere) and wait for the dog to come over to them on her own terms. Cockers seem to be overly submissive, especially when towered over by tall humans. Imagine how you would feel if you only came up to everyone's knees? Don't reach down to pet her when you are standing over her. Squat down to her level before you even make eye contact with her  - she will be less nervous if you aren't so imposing in size. This technique worked with my Cocker.|`|AA10370248	Just ask your vet. Vets can fix just about anything.....|`|0WyITp7zaa	She sounds like a submissive urinator. I think it can be fixed with a lot of patience. First, take her to the vet to rule out any medical problems. After all things are clear you can start working with her. When you have guests over, tell them to try not to pet her when they first come in. Tell your guests to not make any sudden movements towards her and reach out to pet her. Give her a little time to get used to the guest before they attempt to pet her. Have them get down on the ground, so that she doesn't see them as as much of a threat if they were standing up and leaning over her. You'll know things are going too fast when she urinates. Try taking her out on walks to meet new people and introduce her to new situations. I'm sure your dog will learn that it's okay to trust guests that enter your home. Good luck!|`|3d5aee811ce4fff53d3cc0bc359193d7aa	praise her when she allows someone to pet her and does not pee.  have strangers (to her, could be friends) greet her but to have her come up to them - they could have a treat in their hands to help her trust them and actually come up to them (it helped my pound dog be more trusting to my aunts and uncles, et cetera.  i also allowed her to roam the house when guests are around because she likes to do the approaching to strangers - honestly, she used to be so vicious that when my sister's friend came into the kitchen that my dog lunged for her face in anger, but now she is so humble that she greets everyone with a kiss and occasionally a toy).<br>  <br>  good luck to you and the pup!|`|6naotvs0aa	I think you can.My friends dog does that everytime.It is just because it gets over excited, I would ask your vet next time you go and see what you can do and other information if so.|`|z604ZWimaa	ecause of her abuse she probably suffers from lack of confidence. She is frightened of strangers and the peeing is a way she shows submissiveness. When dogs are in a pack, the submissive ones often urinate to show, "Hey, I know you are the head dog, you scare the piss out of me. You don't have to worry about me, I won't challenge your authority" That is what she is saying when she pees'|`|GIFIlzVRaa	Time, Love and Patience will help.<br>  <br>  #1}  MOST IMPORTANT<br>  do not punish or even acknowledge her peeing when you touch her.  Continue to make a great fuss over her.<br>  Reason is she is submissive peeing.<br>  In pack order; a submissive dog will pee to show they are not challenging and do not wish to get into any kind of confrontation.<br>  If you punish this then she will think it is not working so she must pee more to make you understand she is scared.<br>  <br>  If you ignore it and it will likely take her a long time to trust you it should go away.|`|e12abcb9499ef2d78e79ca383ce29671aa	My cocker used to pee when she was excited.  She quit doing it when she got older.  Have the vet make sure she doesn't have a bladder infection.
F45L2Ae7aa	You have a dominance issue. And a dominance struggle. It would seem as though you offer affection before offering discipline. Dogs see this as weakness. Dogs need rules, boundaries and limitations set forth consistantly on a daily basis in order to remain in a healthy mental state. Without proper discipline, you become a weaker pack member and the dogs will try to make up for what they see as your short comings by either erratically or constantly reacting to certain instances in a negative way.<br>  Dogs need exercise, discipline and affection, in that order. Many people make the mistake of offering affection first, exercise second and discipline last. Dogs love to be part of a pack, so walking them together, with You leading the walk, is great for both of them, mentally and physically. The proper walk consists of You leading the walk, and each dog either beside you or behind you during the walk. Never in front of you! From the moment you leave the house, you exit first, followed by them. And when you return, you enter the house first, followed by them. Discipline is not yelling at, getting angry with or hitting the dog. It's simply you correcting unwanted or unappropriate behaviors the moment they happen. Once the correction is made, we move on. Corrections for unwanted behaviors are simple, you just need a confident, calm and assertive mind set. If one does something you don't want, using your index and middle fingers give them a quick but firm touch to the side of the neck, followed by a "shhtt" sound. If they stop doing what they're doing, that's all of a correction you need. However, if they snap or growl at you, or continue to do what they were doing, stronger discipline is in order. Grab the pup by the scruff of the neck and pull them to the floor so that they're laying on their side and hold them there with your fingertips pressed against the side of the neck, and the fingertips of the other hand pressed on their hips. I assure you this does not hurt the dog, it's simply to mimic what a dominant pack member would do to a lower ranking pack member to correct it of unwanted behaviors. Hold them there firmly, if they yelp, squirm or try to get away, apply more pressure. Do Not give in and let them go, again, they see this as weakness and you have lost the battle, only solidifying your position as a lower ranking pack member. Hold them there until you feel them submit, as they begin to relax, the amount of pressure under your fingertips should lessen as well. When they are fully submitted, laying on their side, not trying to get up or struggle free, your hands should be completely off of them, and then a nice massage should be given as a reward for their submissive behavior. Affection should Only be given when the dog is in a calm and submissive state, or just after it has obeyed a command that you gave it. Affection should Always be earned, never just given for no reason, the dog will again see this as weakness. You need to let these dogs know that You are in control at all times - and as long as you're in control, they will not fight, bicker or argue about toys, affection or possessions. You shouldn't treat either dog differently from the other - they should feed at the same time, (which should be either after a walk or after play time or after a training session - dogs love to work for their food! - but if it's close to a time when You will be eating, you should eat first, and then feed them - in a pack the higher ranking members always eat first, followed by the lower ranking members.) discipline should be given in the same manner for the same behaviors and affection should be given for the same calm submissive behaviors. You Especially shouldn't allow the one who seems more dominant over the other to do anything before allowing the other to do something. You're only establishing his place as an alpha member of the pack. YOU are the alpha pack member, always. The other two should be at the same level rank in the pack to avoid conflict between the two of them, and its up to you to let them know where in the pack they stand.<br>  Hopefully I was able to help out in some way. If not, it may be a good idea to contact your vet and ask for the name of a recommended behavioralist who can show you the proper techniques that will help to rid you and you dogs of these issues before they develope into something more aggressive. Best of luck!|`|UPFl0lksaa	It sounds like a dominance issue. Dogs, like their wolf cousins, work in packs. If there is a discrepency about who is dominant then there can be problems. You are alpha dog and you must keep order. It sounds like the older dog is dominant but the younger dog is trying to become dominant. Observe which dog seems the most alpha. Whichever dog is most dominant is the one you should feed, pet, let walk into a room, etc. first. However, I do highly recommend you speak to an animal behaviorist about this issue.|`|M3jRtq2Aaa	Are they the same sex?  Bad choice if they are.  Two females will fight worse than two males.  Are they spayed?  It would help, but not solve the problem. They both want to be the alpha dog.  And the younger one is deferring to the older ones relationship to you.|`|f2UG5r1laa	try giving them both the same amount of attention <br>  Good LUCK

No lucha con peces de otras especies y puede todavía mostrarse intimidado con la presencia de otros peces. Se puede mantenerlo con varias hembras también. Las hembras poseen aletas menores y de coloración menos intensa que los machos. Son pacíficas y pueden mantenerse juntas en cualquier tipo de acuario.<br>  <br>  El mantenimiento del pez Betta se considera demasiado simple. Cuando se lo mantiene en peque?os acuarios, sin equipo de oxigenación y filtraje, deben realizarse cambios parciales (mitad del agua), una o dos veces a la semana. A cada dos semanas, debe llevarse a cabo una limpieza general, cambiando toda el agua. Utilizar agua del grifo, tras el tratamiento con Labcon Protect. El pH del agua debe monitorearse mediante utilización del Labcon Test pH Tropical, lo cual se debe mantener próximo del neutro (7,0). Otro cuidado importante es, durante el inverno, de mantener el acuario calentado a la temperatura de 25 a 28 oC. Para tanto, pueden utilizarse calentadores de peque?a potencia, adecuados a peque?os volúmenes de agua. <br>  <br>  Para la alimentación de los Bettas, ofrecer peque?as cantidades diarias de Alcon Mini Betta o Alcon Betta Mix F.D|`|1oTVDhq6aa	Ummppp..

HwjdXGLMaa	No soy veterinario pero si he tenido cachorros y he viajado casi doce horas y lo que les ha pasado es cansancio.<br>  creo que asi te lo vendieron o todavia no lo habian vacunado ya que esas enfermedades les pegan mas fuerte a los cachorros de raza pero cuando se les pone la vacuna no les pasa nada asi que despreocupate por eso debes de reclamar al que te lo vendio porque te lo mando indefenso al no ponerle las vacunas a tiempo .|`|85b9a3f56d4611ed9b02dea531574afbaa	yo tengo otra pregunta asi ?tienda?|`|FCjzMg8vaa	Qué pena..! bueno es cierto mejor comprarlos personalmente con los padres a la vista. Suerte la próxima!|`|vee6j3bjaa	Mira, he leido muy poco tu relato porque soy hipersensible a muchas cosas y esta es una de ellas.Te responderé de acuerdo a mi sentir y de acuerdo a mi leida super rauda , en forma muy pero muy breve.Si la ley funcionara en el lugar en que estas yo los denunciaria,Si no funcionara la ley los · escracharia" o sea pondría a esa cretina gente en evidencia ( el supuesto vendedor que  no le digo animal porque ofendo a los animales)Tu estas empe?ada en tener un perro de raza,y hay muchisimos animales en adopcion e incluso de la calle que son excelente compa?ia y en extremo agradecidos e incondicionales.Si de verdad amas a los animales y no quieres un  solo un toque de  distinción o de " status" eligiendo la " marca" o raza del perro,quizas puedas hacer una obra de bien al respectoGracias por el consejo,.....Yo tengo perritas  adoptivas y una tercera que  nació en mi casa  y con sus casi 15 a?os esta casi ciega y bastante sorda ,pero llena de amor y crease o no son mis amadas callejeras adoptadas que me asombran en su funcion de "lazarillos" permanentes y no  me explico como lo aprendieron.Chau y suerte|`|cPtJIWWXaa	Quién te dijo que tenía moquillo y diarrea con sangre por stress del viaje?, NO ES CIERTO!, te lo vendieron ya enfermo, obviamente ya tenía MOQUILLO y PARVOVIROSIS, reclámales a los vendedores!. Qué terrible, para tí, y para el pobre cachorro!. Hay gente mala...<br>  Consultá con veterinarios, verás que yo lo que te digo es muy veraz. Mucha suerte!.|`|c2b56df0bd7dfbed8f9b340516481af4aa	Lo siento, pero con los golpes aprendemos, lastima del cachorrito, pero bueno la vida continua y compra te otro donde vives o ve a buscarlo a otra ciudad tu haz le el transporte y no metido en una caja....|`|SDHvDNGJaa	No, mas bien pienso que ese peque?o cachorro ya iba enfermo e inmunosuprimido y por eso el viaje le causó ese efecto.
Pyb3Kc4oaa	que triste es enterarse de estas cosas, inocentes animalitos sufriendo, pero es así hay mucha injusticia, en esta dura vida, pero gracias a Dios hay todavía buenas personas como ustedes y de buen corazón dispuestos a darles una segunda oportunidad de vida y de disfrutar del calor de un hogar como tantos otros gatos, que quizás estos no tuvieron la msma suerte pero todavía están a tiempo gracias a uds.<br>  Bueno, mira yo te aconsejaría que los intentes atraer con bandejitas comida para gatitos de a poco y hablandoles muy dulcemnte, el sonido de la palabra "mishi" o "michi" es al que más responden todos los gatos, también con una soga, cuerda o hilo hacer movimientos para que se pongan a jugar y salgan de su escondite o algún juguetito a curda o baterías que llame su atención. Y si todo esto no funciona pedir ayuda de otras personas, ya sea de la construcción o algún servicio de rescate, también de la veterinaria, eso desde ya, vas con el veterinario que el te aconseje lo que cree mejor y tal vez ellos disponen de un personal capacitado para este tipo de tareas, ya que existen muchos casos como este. Esta sería la mejor solución ya que los pueden dormir por un ratito si son muy salvajes, y ahí los agarran y los llevan a la veterinaria, bueno y ahi ya es otra historia porque ya les pones sus vacunas, los mimas, los domesticas de vuelta y ya están listos para ser adoptados. Y no es cierto como dice la de arriba que "les gusta estar en la calle" por favor, que estupidez más grande!!! que ignorancia por Dios!!  es como decir que a los ni?os de la calle están ahi porque les gusta! Con la diferencia que estos pobres animalitos no pueden elegir ni pensar , dependen pura y exclusivamente de nosotros, de nuestra atención. Son nuestra responsabilidad. como leí una vez en un artículo informativo que decía "no hay razón para que un animal esté en la calle sin su due?o, nunca lo debería estar" y la verdad que es cierto hay que protegerlos mucho mucho, y no tengas remordimientos ni te arrepientas de lo que hicieron al contrario deberían de estar orgullosos por esa bondad que derraman y por ser tan excelentes peronas y comprometerse a ayudar a estos seres vivos que también son de Dios. Todavía están a tiempo de rescatarlos y como dice el dicho: "mas vale ma?a que fuerza", con ingenio los van a capturar a los pobrecitos mininos y darles la posibilidad de tener un hogar. Yo capturé a varios así, que eran ariscos y hura?os y ahora si los vieras, ronroneando en la cama. Yo sé que sí, fuerzas y sigues  mis consejos, hazte la distraída, ponles comida para que ganen confianza, llámalos dulcemente, ellos sienten tu amor y tu interés por ellos, ellos saben cuando los queremos y nos procupamos por ellos, ánimos y fuerza amiga que ya me contarás ... intenta y sientete orgullosa por sentir compasión de ellos y ayudarlos.<br>  Saludos cordiales|`|8vvXRom4aa	a mi tambien me encantan los gatos =]<br>  pero no siempre es posible hacerlo todo u_U<br>  sientete bien por lo q ia hicieron<br>  sus intensiones son muy buenas<br>  pero nada q hacer si no se dejan agarrar...<br>  eso es solo con el tiempo y de estar en contacto <br>  todos los dias|`|mmrzUfWdaa	Mira,acá en Argentina vienen unas tranperas para cazar gatos,pienso que sería lo mas adecuado en tu caso .Le pones comida dentro  y queda la puerta abierta ,ni bien entra el gato se cierra y lo atrapas,Luego la vuelves a colocar.,hasta completar con todos.Suerte.Caso contrariio deberías arrojarlecomida todos los días,|`|r3V9INlYaa	Hola! tu gata mudo a sus gatitos porque no se ha sentido a gusto en el lugar donde estaba, quizas le parecio inseguro, o muy solo, o con pocas probabilidades de conseguir comida (en una obra en construccion al menos hay ratones..)<br>  Lo que seria bueno que hicieras es qeu intenten agarrar a los gatitos y a su mama y te los lleves a la casa donde estas ahora, ya que con la compa?ia de ustedes los gatitos y su mama se sentiran mejor y comenzaran a comer y engordar. Si los cazas y los pones otra vez en la casa sola, se volveran a ir. Llevalos  a tu casa y cuando te mudes, los mudas contigo tambien; no creo que ellos quieran otra cosa por lo que se ve..<br>  Saludos|`|22q64xhNaa	yo lo que haria es darle allí comida mas atractiva para ellos y poco a poco intentar acercarse mas o darsela en la mano .<br>  No os sintais mal porque lo habeis hecho con la mejor intencion .  Os deseo suerte|`|94DgoEkYaa	hay que lastima de gatitos,pues yo creo que si te llevas asu mama al ser ella las que led  la leche y eso pues asi los atraeras y una  vez ke los tengas no los dejes en la casa sola ni nada llevatelas atu casa y dale mucha calor al parecer los gatitos lo que desean es estar contigo y con tu marido porque se sienten solos,pero vosotros no os sintais mal ni nada ni creais que le habeis hecho da?o al reves le disteis calor y estais haciendo todo lo p osibple por recuperarlos a no queda gente ai que se preocupe por los animales me allegro mucho por vuestro decision y vuestra forma de mirar las oss y por la compasion que tienes hacia ellos,de veras enhorabuena ojala todos fueran como tu!un besito y muchisima suerte tanto con los gatitos como tu bebe un besazo rasta!|`|EY74C3tdaa	Es m uy encomiable tu interés en los gatitos, pero por ahora pienza más en tu futuro bebé.<br>  Pregunta a tu médico y va a decirte que el pelo del gato (si son muchos gatos es peor), resulta peligroro para el bebé.<br>  <br>  Sería más sabio que hablaras a los Bomberos o a algún asilo para animales de la calle y pagar para que los recojan y les den atención apropiada, pues a eso se dedican algunos asilos.<br>  <br>  Así puedes ayudarlos de todas formas. Y no pones riesgos innecesarios en tu hogar.<br>  <br>  Los gatos y los bebés no es bueno tenerlos juntos.|`|XZHgC7lpaa	Mira yo creo que tienen que tratar de hacer que regresen con comida nose es posible que si ustedes se quedan con la mama ellos sientan deseo de volver a su casa porque en la calle ya no tienen a su mama que los cuide y eso. Nose sientan mal ustedes hagan lo que puedan ya son buenas personas por ese lindo gesto que hicieron para ayudar a los gatitos pero recuerda que son un poco salvajes y esos son sus instintos entonces contra eso no hay mucho que puedan hacer... bueno espero te sirvan mis consejos.. quisiera que ubiera mas gente como ustedes que se preocupan por los animalitos que estan en la calle son  grandes personas!<br>  muchisima suerte! Felicidades por el bebe que vas  a tener!|`|kgUat2MEaa	han probado, colarles comida atractiva y asi acostumbrarlos de nuevo,  mientras comen, se asecan poco a poco, para que no se espanten, acariciénlos, mientras comen y volverán a acustumbrarlos... en cuanto se hayan acustumbrado los podrán tomar y despulgarlos con algun medicamento que les recomienden.  Deben separarlos de los perros, porque si son muchos perros, tal vez esa fue la causa por la que se fueron.   Suerte|`|ltPrYejnaa	yo creo que pueden intentar atraerlos a ustedes con comida y asi llevarselos de nuevo, hay que dificil situacion pero los gatos son asi les encanta andar en la calle.<br>  espero que tengas suerte.|`|os8g8kueaa	pobres gatitos algo los asusto de tu casa mientras no los captures todos llevales comida para que no mueran  y puedes tratar  de agarralos con la comida que les llame la atencion jamon o pedazo de pescados se te acercaran  ojala los salves|`|1f5f6c20f070c5aab9a14e0479560a9daa	Saludos!!! Primero que nada no se seintan mal, tu esposo y tu hicieron lo correcto; yo creo que deben atraerlos con comida nuevamente, y según les vuelvan a agarrar confianza volver a cuidarlos y despulgar a los pobrecitos; y si rescatas solo a algunos, habrá valido la pena.<br>  Felicidades por ser tan buenas personas y pase lo que pase no se sientan mal.|`|M1hDOCDJaa	Pués, no creo que se hayan ido porque no les gustó la comida, sino más bien porque tienes muchos perros,<br>  La gatita se pudo sentir amenazada debido a que sientió peligro para ella y sus bebés.<br>  Sería bueno rescatarla con sus crías y buscarles un hogar adoptivo donde pueda terminar de amamantar a sus gatitos, después, si quieres te quedas con la madre.<br>  Es obvio que se llenaron de pulgas en una construcción, ya que donde hay mucha tierra y en su condición de abandono, recogen cuanto bicho haya en el suelo o en el aire.<br>  Pobrecitos, ahora están desconfiados de todo y por eso están ura?os, es urgenterayudarlos ya, o empezarás a encontrarlos muertos.

I conigli sono sì animali che vivono in colonie, ma sono anche molto territoriali.

PCuLn5c5aa	Yea i think any dog would get along with any dog just fine. Although sometimes, it might take a week or two for them to adjust but after that they'll play with each other no matter what. If your dog is a boy i say you should get a girl =) but get her spayed so that way she'll be healthy. THe animal shelter is a great place to look for a dog/puppy. They're inexpensive and they come with all the shots, a free vet exam, they get spayed/neutered and a 14 day exchange if anything happens or if it doesn't work out with your family/pets. Good luck!|`|AA11118856	Labs and Retrievers get a long great with Poodles too. They all love the water, and are hunting breeds.
wX3RzHaRaa	They are medium on shedding. No I get dog hair everywhere from my Boston. Checkout akc.org , you'll find useful info on Bostons health problems, history ect...|`|iVVen0Lgaa	Bostons have minimal shedding.  They usually shed twice a year --- late fall and late spring.  The rest of the time you just have a hair or two lost at a time.  If you go over them with a grooming glove or rubber brush every few days then there is no problem.  Even in their "big" sheds, it's not nearly as bad as dogs with fluffy coats.  Vacuum every couple of days and things are fine.  If you have hard flooring (hardwood or tile) you'll notice the hairs more.  But their shedding is the least of the worries you'll have with a Boston.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bostonterrierclubofamerica.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://bostonterrierclubofamerica.org/in...</a>|`|WearQDsIaa	When i adopted my pominese (they shed alot), i was told to get a wire brush and brush the dog backwards.<br>  which means brush from the tail toward the head.<br>  it helps get the loose fur and they shed a lot less after you do that.<br>  trust me, i tried it and it works really well.<br>  plus my dog loves it.<br>  <br>  good luck.

6ynHloQbaa	Che il latte provochi la dissenteria, è in parte vero; ma se avesse ingerito come sospetti cibo avvelenato, il latte è un ottimo strumento. Potrebbe essere anche una forma d'influenza (si lecca la bocca e il naso per pulirsi dal muco), portalo dal veterinario che con un antibiotico e una cura a base di vitamine lo rivedrai meglio di prima.

Does it really matter what he is other than loveable and sweet?|`|p40oeGG1aa	I've worked in the pet industry in vet offices and as a dog groomer for 4 years, and he looks like the classic definition of a pit bull or pit mix. I don't see the jack russell though, as their markings are usually different and are usually dominant over other color patterns, so if he is a J.R. mix I would think he would display more of that coloring, not to mention I don't see much in the body structure and he's much bigger than a J.R. at 4 mo. As for the Bulldog, doubtful. He doesn't look like an bulldog to me at all, not beefy enough, and doesn't have any sign of the short snout like bulldogs or boxers.|`|pQn6HhIXaa	Looks like your little one might have some pit bull in it.....the jaw shape is about right....he sure is a cutie|`|rUFmqWtkaa	I see pitbull....Not sure what else.

sMyovTSsaa	Que tal, espero que estes bien a pesar de las dificultades.<br>  <br>  Mira, para comenzar el problema SI es CONGéNITO, es decir, que se crea durante la gestación, que viene cuando está siendo creado.<br>  NO se confunda con GENéTICO, que quiere decir que viene en los genes, que se puede heredar y transmitir a través de.<br>  <br>  El padecimiento que tiene tu potro se le nombre "WRY NOSE" (en espa?ol, nariz torcida o nariz con mueca), es un transtorno congénito en el cual por:<br>  <br>  - EXCESO DE PRESIóN<br>  - MAL ACOMODO DEL PRODUCTO O<br>  - POR PRESIóN DEL CORDóN UMBLICAL<br>  <br>  causa una malformación y no permite el desarrollo simétrico de las estructuras del cuello y el cráneo, lo cual resulta en una mala función de la respiración o de la deglución principalmente, es decir, no se puede alimentar correctamente y no respira bien.<br>  <br>  Por desgracia el 80 % de los potros o potrancas no sobreviven en la primera semana, lo mas grave es la dificultad para mamar, ya que puede degenerar en bronco aspiración (que la leche vaya a los pulmones) y mas grave aun con la deformidad cervical, ya que es mucho mas incómodo para alimentarse por si mismo el neonato.<br>  <br>  La única esperanza es una cirugía, pero el pronóstico es reservado. Aparte es muy costoso y suele tener complicaciones.<br>  <br>  El los últimos a?os he tenido tres casos similares, el último en agosto, que fue de una potranca.<br>  <br>  Cabe tomar en cuenta que la mayor parte de los casos son de hembras primerizas, también la mayoría presentan desviación hacia el lado derecho del hueso nasal.<br>  <br>  Cómo prevención, puedes tomar precauciones descansando a la yegua gestante por lo menos al tercer mes de gestación, si, yo se que hay quienes las siguen montando y trabajando muy cercano al parto, pero es una forma de prevenir, lo mismo exceso de trabajo durante la gestación, cólicos, timpanismos recurrentes (estos hacen que se reduzca el espacio del útero y sea ocupado por visceras y aumenta la presión sobre el producto).<br>  <br>  Un colega y amigo junto con tu servidor, creamos una férula a manera de bozal para que te la imagines, la cual gradualmente ibamos apretando, se logró enderezar bastante pero es de muchisima disciplina y paciencia, eso es otra alternativa, cabe mencionar que este caso no era tan grave y no implicaba da?o en cervicales.<br>  <br>  Espero que te haya ayudado un poco, de eso se trata, cualquier otra duda con gusto, puedes escribir a: maximussdecimuss@yahoo.com.mx, estoy en México.<br>  <br>  detalle adicional:<br>  Leí una respuesta de otro participante acerca de la brucelosis, mira, la brucelosis en equinos  NO CAUSA ESE TIPO DE PROBLEMAS, puede ser portador el caballo pero el da?o de la bacteria se limita a lesiones en la región de la cruz, similares a las llamadas "mataduras" o irritaciones por fricción de la silla, bueno, eso es todo.|`|87b084359416e94bad5cada6b1ef5b22aa	Todo esto que tu comentas es preocupante.<br>  Lo más importante ahorita es que el potrillo tome los calostros de la madre.<br>  Tambien sería útil que descartes un posible problema infeccioso de la madre si es que dices que un posible problema congénito se ha descartado. Exactamente me refiero a un problema por Brucella melitensis o abortus. Te digo esto porque esta bacteria es capaz de causar malformaciones de esta naturaleza. Es cierto que en primera instancia trae abortos, pero una vez que las hembras (sean vacas, yeguas, cerdas, peros, o gatos) la han padecido en varias ocasiones, se vuelven resitentes y logran engendrar una cria, pero es posible que esta nazca con malformaciones como la que tu describes. Por eso es muy importante que quede descartada la presencia de esta bacteria que además se puede contagiar a ser humano.<br>  Respecto a las deformaciones, posiblemente solo sea el resultado de el parto tan largo ya que por lo que tu refieres la yegua debió quedar gestante  aproximademante  en septiembre 22 del 2006 y el parto debió ocurrir alrededor de<br>  agosto 27 o 28. La posición del potrillo dento del útero puede ser la causa de todo esto. Lo que se puede intentar es acomodarle el cuello en en posición correcta u ponerle una férula hecha de alambre y cinta adesiva. Con respecto al hueso nasal va a ser más dificil, pero esta deformidad es menos importante ya que no lo imposibilita para que lo puedas utilizar en un futuro.<br>  Como te digo, lo mas importante ahorita es que coma bien, y de preferencia de la madre.|`|KFymWYWOaa	losiento por ti y por tu potro no se que puedes hacer pero me da mucha pena .espero que tengas suerte y el potrillo tambien|`|rEjJxh8Gaa	Hola!!<br>  <br>  Yo te cuento lo que hacen en el Hospital Clinico Veterinario de la UCM (Universidad Complutense de Madrid). <br>  <br>  Creo que dices que ha nacido con el morro "torcido", que todos los huesos están torcidos, como si le hubieran doblado el morro, no? Entonces los potros que nacen con el hueso del tabique nasal desviado ( es decir, que tienen como el morro torcido), se pueden curar. Cómo?? Pues es algo siniestro y jodido: se le pone una vara de hierro a ambos lados de la cara y el hocico, y se atornilla al hueso. Esto se pone por cirugía. Y cada poco tiempo van tensando las varas para que el hueso vuelva a ponerse recto, aprovechando que son prácticamente cartilaginosos porque son potros. (Sinceramente, parecen Hannibal Lecter).<br>  Es un proceso arduo y difícil, y muy caro. <br>  El problema que tiene esta enfermedad, es que el potro tiene dificultad para mamar.  <br>  Por cierto, no se ponen de acuerdo en si es congénita ó  es debido a que el potro pasa más tiempo dentro de su madre, pero lo que sí se sabe es que los descendientes suelen nacer con ello, ahora bien, tampoco saben si porque es congénita o porque pasan más tiempo dentro del útero también, ya que este carácter sí es hereditario, por lo que no deberias cruzarlo, porque es probable que sus hijos, o sus nietos, también nazcan así. <br>  <br>  Lo del cuello sinceramente no sé, porque los potros que hemos tenido no tenían el cuello mal, asi que en eso no puedo indicarte. <br>  <br>  Yo te aconsejaría que te pusieras en contacto con tu veterinario (como ya habrás hecho, supongo yo) y que te cuento, porque como tampoco sé de dónde eres no puedo indicarte a nadie. <br>  <br>  1 saludo y muchísima suerte, ojalá me equivoque y no sea esa patología, sino otra más fácil de curar.|`|ns4pP87faa	yama al beterinario|`|21ef324839707a6a688c2b97dc1bbfeeaa	No te prometo el oro y el moro, pero creo que algo se puede hacer, o al menos intentarlo con muy poco esfuerzo y dinero.<br>  <br>  <br>  Te recomiendo que le administres lo siguiente de homeopatía:<br>  <br>  CALCAREA CARBONICA 30 CH<br>  CALCAREA PHOSPHORICA 30 CH<br>  CALCAREA FLUORICA 30 CH<br>  <br>  normalmente se vende en bolitas<br>  <br>  Dale una de cada al día (si por un casual te cae más de una, no hace falta que la devuelvas al bote; da lo mismo, se la puedes dar igualmente sin diferencia en el efecto)<br>  <br>  Ingéniatelas para darle algo tan peque?o.<br>  <br>  Se las puedes disolver en agua y absorberla con una jeringuilla e "inyectársela" en la boca (sin aguja)... por ejemplo<br>  <br>  En fin, los que tenéis caballos ya sabréis trucos para casos como este.<br>  <br>  Además a?adiría un poco de cloruro de magensio en el agua.<br>  <br>  Si bebe la madre de ahí no pasa nada; le irá bien.<br>  <br>  Poco es poco; más vale que le des de menos que de más.<br>  <br>  Prueba una pizca en un vaso de agua y te haces a la idea de lo poco que hay que echar, ?ok?

He will eventually lose interest after exploring and you getting him away from there. Kittens are always into something. It seems they go from one interest to the next. My kitten Jasper kept trying to get the betta out of the fish tank but after me getting him away from there and letting him be cause I finally realized he couldn't get him out then he finally lost interest and went onto something else.|`|1u9Kfbt2aa	I have a young active cat and she wants to spend time with my baby (older one).

Or I keep the curtains open during the day and he lays in the sun<br>  :-)|`|3AokFYbdaa	you won't have to pick one of them to get rid of. Just give the sugarglider a weapon to make it fair and let them battle it out.|`|zl66LPupaa	tell him no and pick the cat up and put him somewhere else. i did that with my kitten with ym guinea pigs and fish
PBBdapCWaa	It's possible what you are seeing is actually ammonia damage to the fins and not actual fin rot disease.  I would suggest you first check the ammonia in the tank or have it checked at a local pet store.  If the ammonia is slightly high, water changes until the biological filtration can catch up will be the best bet.<br>  <br>  Assuming the water checks out and it is actually fin rot, I would suggest you treat with Maracyn TC for no less than 10 days.  There are a few resistant strains of fin rot that will not respond well to this medication, but that very rare, but you should be ready to treat for longer than recommended on the package to insure they rot is completely killed off or it will only come back and be harder to kill the next time.<br>  <br>  MM|`|e49de377def7dc80a5baa53274275b3baa	here is a site about fin rot on bettas<br>  <a href="http://www.healthybetta.com/articles/Illness%20Diagonsis/finrot.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthybetta.com/articles/Ill...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps<br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  <br>  EB|`|1ogYnmdPaa	you cant do more than that just keep on checking on him|`|52WwM2vEaa	first, put a tablespoon of rock crystal sea salts into a gallon of water and bathe him for 15 minutes. then take another gallon or so tank of freshwater and put him in it with a bunch of iron wool, the scratchy copper cleaning pads for dishes and that should cure him. keep him and the iron wool in clean tank water until it heals<br>  p.s. hes probably stressed so move him to the old tank with fresh water|`|ozEtTonHaa	I'm no expert, but I would do a 50 percent water change a day until he got better. Also, when you're doing your water changes, add medication and a little bit of aquarium salt. Also, change the filter, too.

Trattandosi di una bestiola che custodisci in casa, puoi tranquillamente pulirlo con dello shampoo asciutto, da acquistare presso rivenditori specializzati, e spazzolarlo quando vuoi! Le parti "intime" fanno parte del suo corpo, quindi non vi è nulla di anormale; l'interessante è il naso e gli occhi.

Non usare salviette o shampoo a secco, potrebbe leccare i rimasugli di detergente.
yHjSYdBMaa	Hi, the only light you need is a night type bulb for them. They naturally nocturnal so a night heat bulb is great for them.|`|17ae4a617526fe80e437f120fdbbe2b5aa	Yes. But, provided that they are reptile bulbs. I have all my reptiles on energy saving reptile bulbs. You can get it at your local pet store.|`|UBPjM7xEaa	You really don't need a light as long as your room is well lit. The most important thing is to keep the UTH at about 89-92. To achieve proper heat, make sure you use a rheostat or thermostat as temps on UTHs can easily reach over a 100. Make sure you also measure the temps with a digital thermometer with a probe. Stick-ons can be up to 20 degrees off (I know this from experience and switching.) <br>  But to answer the original question, you can, but its kind of unnecessary as long as the room is well lit or a window open to let in light. You want to make sure they get at least 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of night time.|`|Xg21vh5Faa	you can, but its better if you use the reptile bulbs, they give off certain light that houser bulbs dont. if you do use normal bulbs, be sure to get a UVB strip to make up for the lost uv. the point of the lamp and bulb is to provide a basking spot, though ive since this is for a leo, you should get a night reptile bulb, purple, or red ($4-$7) and a normal bulb for day time will work perfect. the night bulb is to keep a constant air temp, something a heat pad doesn't do.
MzyeiQc1aa	well this turtles care is about the same as a spur thigh. if that helps. would i do for tortoise that need a high calcium diet like the greek is keep a cuttle bone in the cage at all times. that way it can eat as much as it needs. and the humidity should be  low dont go out of you way to raise the humidity. these tort. are terrestial species and like it dry. heres a care sheet that should help. good luck|`|17ae4a617526fe80e437f120fdbbe2b5aa	You can use a cuttlebone and leave it in the enclosure, so that he can munch on it when he feels like it. Ibera greek tortoise needs humidity. Go to World Chelonia Trust website and get the care sheet.|`|C1dsj74eaa	HOUSING: Golden Greeks tend to bury themselves in the topsoil or under the base of clumps of grass, regardless of being maintained indoors or out this ability to hide should be duplicated.  Unfortunately if they are being maintained in an area with a damp substrate this tendency to dig a "pad" results in them sitting in a very high humidity location (microclimate) for long periods of time.  Upon exposure to a humid environment, even if warm, many of these tortoises develop Upper Respiratory Tract Disease (URTD) and rapidly decline. To avoid this Golden Greeks should be housed in a dry, warm environment with low ambient humidity. 30-50%  This must be taken into consideration when arranging housing for them.   While most species of tortoises respond well and do much better with outdoor maintenance, this variant does better in indoor accommodations unless they are being maintained in a low humidity climatic zone or special consideration is given to providing a substrate that does not hold moisture. . <br>  <br>  Additional calcium supplementation is essential. Powdered calcium can be sprinkled all foods. It is suggested that the caregiver provide calcium supplemented with vitamin D3 if the animal is being maintained indoors and calcium without D3 if it is outdoors. Provision of a cuttlefish bone, which can be gnawed if desired, is also recommended.  In addition to this, occasional use of a multi-vitamin / mineral preparation will insure that the animal gets needed supplements that may be lacking in a captive diet.   <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chelonia.org/Articles/tiberagoldengreekcare.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chelonia.org/Articles/tiberag...</a>

Add more details. if its not its nno gangreen.<br>  It could just be bacterial build up if you forgot to clean the cage one day or something.

Xg21vh5Faa	itd do it a little better if it had a reptile bulb, but the black light can work. it cant be the only light though, it does need 12 hours cycles of day and night.(12 hours day, 12 hours night)|`|17ae4a617526fe80e437f120fdbbe2b5aa	Your gecko need reptile lights that emits uva and uvb rays.

P7f346v8aa	I always give my dogs 24 hours before becoming concerned and seeking out my vet.  <br>  <br>  This was after a long consult with her years ago on this very subject.  <br>  <br>  Tummy upset happens.  Heat can be an issue as well as the hotter weather killing appetite.  In such cases going without food for a day can help give the gut time to settle down and recover.<br>  <br>  For the first offered meal, I add yogurt for it's tummy buffering qualities as well as adding healthy cultures that aid in settling the tummy.|`|N0Tk90Btaa	I'm sure this isn't what you guys are going through, but when I take my dog camping, she's so excited to be outdoors, and there's so much going on around her, that she won't eat...I think she thinks she might miss something!  I just got back from a week-long camping trip with her, and she only ate a quarter as much as she usually does (she'd eat half a meal every other day).  Well, I assumed she wouldn't starve herself to death, and she was still being active and acting normal, and now we're back home and she's fine.<br>  <br>  I don't know how helpful this little story is, but maybe it'll keep you from panicking a little bit.

GKAZ8SKVaa	Probably it's meant simply as that's what they eat, of course having an enclosed area where the mouse or other rodent can't escape doesn't mimic nature.  Face it, when you have animals as pets, you can TRY to mimic nature for them, but the fact is they are living in a man made environment.  I myself buy frozen mice for my snake.  DEFINITELY not natural, but then again, neither is living in a glass aquarium with a lid.|`|tlM4v5dtaa	In a perfect world, captive reptiles should be offered a diet consisting of what they would eat if they were in their natural environment.  Some reptiles "prey" on small rodents including mice.... others are vegetarians.  Since it seems you have a problem offering live food, you should only keep dietary specialists in the herbivore group.  A green iguana would be a good reptile pet for you....they only eat vegetables.|`|R0QsQoafaa	I agree that it is not natural, the snake is not in the wild, it is effectively kept in a box, not what i would call natural. The mouse has zero chance of survival which is also not natural nor is it natural for the fact that the mouse or any other feeder animal was placed there in front of the snake.<br>  <br>  I feed my snakes frozen/thawed, there is a chance that the feeder animal can turn the tables and cause serious injury to the snake, it may not always happen but it is possible, there are some horrific pictures on google of snakes half eaten by there food. here's one example of the after effects of feeder animal attacking the snake <a href="http://bellsouthpwp.net/j/b/jbuncc/dont%20feed%20live1.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://bellsouthpwp.net/j/b/jbuncc/dont%...</a> <br>  <br>  In my country it is actually illegal to feed live, you risk prosecution for animal cruelty if you do so.

This is because of the Cocoa content of the chocolate.<br>  I think, white chocolate isn't bad for dogs as it doesn't contain the cocoa that other types of chocolate do.<br>  <br>  In fact, scratch what I said about white chocolate, the vet above me is absolutely right!|`|zvvNRg7Faa	yea!they r like poisons for them!all of the sweet things r!!|`|GQEWNd7haa	Yes, as well as garlic and some other things.<br>  <br>  While effects aren't initially seen, chemicals build up in them and eventually effect them.  This can also cause some to have issues like paralysis of their legs (Mine hard his hind legs go out).|`|S9B8Fr4daa	Yes, in LARGE quantities it is toxic.  They don't have the ability to digest the chemicals and ingredients of chocolate.|`|Ir9xWBm9aa	yes it is poisonous to them<br>  however you can get special dog chocolate that is okay for them to eat<br>  you will find it in any pet shop<br>  :)|`|qFOdHHCDaa	Yh its true, its poison to them, and it can even kill them, so don't feed your dog any chocolate whatsoever |`|AA11902885	Yes. In chocolate there is this thing called Theobromine. It's toxic to dogs. |`|SJGDtWROaa	Very True. Don't ever give doggys chocolate.|`|AA11335428	Yes, the darker the chocolate, the more toxic it is.  A small amount of baker's chocolate would kill a dog, while a greater quantity of milk chocolate may not even make the animal sick.  This is due to the dog being unable to digest the theobromine in the chocolate.  Err on the side of caution, and keep all chocolate away from dogs.  The same is true for horses, cats, birds and other animals.|`|pFuXUR89aa	Yes.  It is toxic to both dogs and cats.|`|4sicbuWLaa	it is more harmful to pedigree dogs than mongrels|`|f9111e474fecefa1458da0f25b04e18faa	It's NOT the sugar that's harmful... it's a chemical in the chocolate of theobromine.<br>  Ingesting even low doses of chocolate can be risky for pooches.<br>  A 50-pound dog eating 2 ounces of chocolate will likely experience gastrointestinal upset. If the dog eats 4.5 ounces, its heart<br>  rate will increase. Ingesting more than 5 ounces can lead to seizures, and eating over 9 ounces can cause death. Signs of<br>  theobromine poisoning will occur 4 to 6 hours after ingestion. |`|XNskIOWOaa	its true|`|oR77hDxxaa	yes its like poison to them.|`|0E0OaibEaa	Yes it is, but it is only one of many things that are harmful to dogs.  In addition to chocolate, here are 24 other types of human food which can cause your dog harm:<br>  <br>  1. Onions (Both onions and garlic contain the toxic ingredient Thiosulphate. But onions are more of a danger. Many dog biscuits contain *small* amounts of garlic – garlic contains less of this toxin so huge amounts would need to be consumed to be toxic. And, by the way, this poison builds up the system – it can be toxic in one large dose – or with repeated consumption of small amounts.)<br>  2. Chocolate (Chocolate contains Theobromine, a compound that is a cardiac stimulant and a diuretic. This can be fatal to dogs.)<br>  3. Grapes (Grapes are dangerous because of an unknown substance which is toxic to dogs – affects canine’s kidneys)<br>  4. Raisins (See above.)<br>  5. Most Fruit Pits and Seeds (Contain Cyanogenic Glycosides resulting in cyanide poisoning – though the fruit itself is OK.)<br>  6. Macadamia Nuts (Macadamia nuts contain an unknown substance that is toxic to dogs.)<br>  7. Most Bones should *not* be given (especially chicken bones) because they can splinter and cause laceration of the digestive system and/or become lodged in your pet’s throat – so they also pose a choking hazard.<br>  8. Potato Peelings and Green Potatoes (Contain Oxalates, which can affect the digestive, nervous, and urinary systems.)<br>  9. Rhubarb leaves (see above)<br>  10. Broccoli (Broccoli is only toxic in large quantities.)<br>  11. Green parts of Tomatoes or Green Potatoes(Contain oxalates, which can affect the digestive, nervous, and urinary systems.)<br>  12. Yeast Dough (Yeast Dough can produce gas and swell in your pet’s stomach – leading to rupture of the digestive system)<br>  13. Coffee/Coffee Grounds and Tea (are dangerous due to the caffeine.)<br>  14. Beer/Wine/Alcohol of any kind (Alcohol of any kind could lead to coma or even death.)<br>  15. Human Vitamins (Human vitamins, especially those containing iron, can cause damage to the lining of the digestive system as well as cause kidney and liver damage)<br>  16. Moldy or Spoiled Food (though I think this goes without saying.)<br>  17. Persimmons (Persimmons can cause intestinal blockage)<br>  18. Raw Eggs and Raw Fish (Raw eggs and some raw fish can cause Salmonella poisoning.)<br>  19. Salt, Baking Soda, Baking Powder (In large amounts these can cause an electrolyte imbalance – and severe electrolyte imbalances can lead to muscle spasm or even congestive heart failure.)<br>  20. Mushrooms (Mushrooms may contain toxins which could cause liver and kidney damage)<br>  21. Sugar-Free Foods (Sugar-free foods containing Xylitol have been found to cause liver failure in some dogs.)<br>  22. Nutmeg (Nutmeg can cause tremors, seizures, and central nervous system damage.)<br>  23. Excessive Fatty Foods (Excess fatty foods can cause Pancreatitis.)<br>  24. Avocado (All parts of the avocado and avocado tree are toxic to dogs.)<br>  25. Diary Products (Dairy products don’t usually pose a great danger; but many dairy product have high fat content (see number 23) – and many pets are lactose intolerant – some pets more than others. Lactose intolerance leads to gas and diarrhea; though small amounts of yogurt and cheese are usually fairly well tolerated.)<br>  <br>  There may be other foods that your dog can not consume (based on his health) so always ask your vet when you are unsure about anything concerning your pet. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.articlesbase.com/pets-articles/25-human-foods-toxic-to-your-pets-130312.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.articlesbase.com/pets-article...</a>|`|QHVZPWZsaa	YES...IT COULD KILL THEM |`|XclTAOyvaa	yes it is bad for them|`|nRXCCAJSaa	yes it is toxic|`|tRx0wDzgaa	Ask the 'experts' here and you will get <br>  <br>  50 % --- deadly to dogs<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  50 % --- no problems<br>  <br>   Do your self a favour and GOOGLE - "theobromine dog".

Yes it's not good for them, but they'd have to eat huge quantities of it to actually do them any serious harm.<br>  <br>  Last Xmas, my dog managed to knock the christmas tree over and eat all the chocs while we were out, we rang our vets panicking but the receptionist there just told us to make sure he had extra water as he'd be a bit dehydrated, and just keep an eye on him for a day or two. He was completely fine.|`|090e12392ae29e1e6da569bbe031aaf6aa	It is true. However certain kinds of chocolate are more toxic than others. Milk Chocolate, for example, will do very little harm so no need to fret too much if your dog stumbles upon a Hershey's bar. Dark chocolate, however, is "Take your dog to the vet NOW!" toxic.|`|kM14b5teaa	Yes. caffeine and bromethalin are the poisonous things in it. Dark chocolate is worse because it his higher in this, whereas milk or white chocolate takes a bit more. <br>  Even though it can lead to death, it isn't the most poisonous risk for your dog. It takes more than a bar to fatally affect your dog.|`|bYu2NNq2aa	Yes it is harmful to dogs because chocolate contains theobromine which, is a stimulant, it can effect the dogs nerves system and heart muscles as well as increasing the frequency of urination.<br>  |`|VOIOKYEvaa	It's true. They lack the ability to digest it and it is poison for them. |`|FRBJzGtYaa	No. in moderation its fine but if you feed them like a pound then yes. but just a little is fine just dont feed it to them on purpose|`|AzFhMYZAaa	Yes, chocolate is harmful to dogs.  Our home page has a section on chocolate and pets--PeMD.org|`|mP2nmhJyaa	yes sadly urm my dog died of it :( only 1 year back so dont loose yours|`|8vxEOIdUaa	Yes.RaisIns too.
AA11860101	It's called doing the right thing and having your dog neutered. <br>  <br>  95% of purebreds should be fixed (and ALL healthy mixes). Only purebred dogs who are two years old and up, have been titled, are ambassadors of their breed, and have passed through their genetic health screening with flying colours (a simple vet check doesn't cut it), should ever be bred. A new breeder should never attempt to breed if they do not have a mentor. Also, if you are serious about breeding; help out with rescue. A responsible breeder's knowledge of whelping comes in handy if there is ever a puppy mill bust, etc.<br>  <br>  Breeding information, and the realities of careless breeding:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pugsavers.com/breeding.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pugsavers.com/breeding.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.brightlion.com/InHope/InHope_en.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.brightlion.com/InHope/InHope_...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emGZBLVJmGI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emGZBLVJm...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bpDE6Vx_QU&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bpDE6Vx_...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.woodhavenlabs.com/breeding.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.woodhavenlabs.com/breeding.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/bluegracepwd/virtualbreeding.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/bluegracepwd/vi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.learntobreed.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.learntobreed.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.petfinder.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.org</a> has 304,306 pets in need, not all of them in safe no-kill shelters and breed rescues.

If you can't control you own dog...get some training or find it a new home with someone who can handle the dog.|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	Hmm - lob his balls off!!!<br>  <br>  Well get the vet to do it anyways!|`|X3bu0B8faa	You need to have him neutered right away! if cost is stopping you, there are clinics with reduced rates. Only top quality dogs should be bred to reproduce other top quality dogs- putting an end to euthanizing thousands of dogs each year. The next thing you do is get a chain on him ( not a log chain either) with a leash and sign up for an obedience class. These are the kind of dogs that bite and then get put to sleep because they are out of control and are doing what comes natural. take care of your dog if you love him Tell your sister to get her dog spayed. Be responsible. take charge of your pets, please.|`|s0j2v49aaa	Get him neuteredd or else he will want to have sex all the time!|`|4higWvgaaa	Get your frickin' dogs spayed and neutered. "If he seen" what kind of English is this?   How about "if he saw"..  <br>  |`|11ouJV3Haa	Get him neutured now!!|`|R0M1WCmZaa	my gosh these some people are suuccck!!!!! jezz............|`|3giaPYe8aa	Your kidding, right?

Sheesh.<br>  <br>  EDIT: We are not "rude", we're telling the truth to an irresponsible dog owner! And, btw, "smacking him in the face" does nothing but teach him not to trust you.
UrfIXYdwaa	He may settle down, it can take up to 6 weeks for some male bunnies to calm down after neutering.<br>  <br>  It may be a dominance thing, he wants the other one to know he's still in charge.<br>  <br>  Some rabbits do it anyway.  I have a male and a female (both been 'done') and I have noticed a few times they get frisky with each other, even seen the female trying to hump the male lol.  They do tend to do it when the weather gets a bit warmer (like if we've had a cold spell and then it warms up a bit). <br>  <br>  As long as there's no aggression involved I wouldn't worry too much about it.  Watch out though that the bunny being humped isn't getting injured on the back of the neck though, sometimes the rabbit humping will grab the fur there.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	It's probably a dominance thing more than for the sex. Most animals in the world do it eg monkeys, dogs etc simply to show their dominance over the lesser one in the pack.|`|aMVD5CHmaa	The hormones settle down about 6 weeks after its been done. Besides hormones it could be a dominance issue or just the way he plays.|`|1YqBYooLaa	A rabbit with a habbit ever thought of becoming a poet|`|oKWe4rueaa	Our rabbits still do it all the time...one is female & the other male.

B3ZU5FZXaa	The answer from Glenys was pretty spot on.  Some people also place a watch that ticks and can 'duplicate' a heartbeat and a hot water bottle in a dog bed with some blankets that have your smell (or the owners smell).  If you want you could always put the dog in bed with you till it calms down (not between the sheets!)  But if you do that you may risk teaching the dog to jump on the bed and cuddle with you when scared.  But if it's too much for you just get a dog bed, blanket, hot water bottle and maybe a watch.  The idea that anyone in your household will be getting up and playing with a puppy at 4-5 am just isn't practical.  Though you could make certain to exhaust the dog before bedtime.  But we are taking puppy so that could take a village!<br>  <br>  Just realize that this too will pass.  If it were a human baby would your neighbors complain about it crying?  It will be ok just know that when it's crying it needs comforting.  Create that in a space, if you get a crate don't lock it in when this happens.  The doggie is already freaked out, you don't want to heighten the fear for it.|`|emzQNo0Haa	Basically she will get used to it eventually but there are lots of things you can do to help limit it:<br>  -Keep her very active during the day so she'll be tired and sleep at night.<br>  -You can go sit in the same room with her, just don't play with her or anything, until she goes to sleep.<br>  -Give her a stuffed animal to sleep with.<br>  <br>  Hope these help!|`|6l4nMoLmaa	I just got an 8 week old puppy this past Sunday. The last few nights he has been up whining at 3 hour intervals. It is normal for the pups to miss their parents and siblings. Have you tried getting up to let her relieve herself? I have done that and mine seems to go right away and whines for abit but then back to sleep. Try that but do not play with her at all..just let her relieve herself outside and back to bed. Do you have a crate type thing for her to sleep in? I have read that dogs like "den" type spaces. Small cozy places for them to feel  safe and comfortable. Other then those tips just try to ignore her as best as you can until she gets used to it. Hope this helps...good luck :) |`|mSM48EMSaa	She just needs some time to get use to the changes. <br>  <br>  Try a rolled up newspaper and swat her butt (not hard) just enough to know what she's doing is bad. Then after about a week of this you wont even have to use the newspaper. Once the dog sees it she/he will stop. =]<br>  <br>  I hope this helped|`|iOlTQ8v5aa	my puppy used 2 be like that I'm afraid you'll hav 2 put up wit her goin 2 the toilet in the house 4 a while....until she gets used to sleeping QUIETLY!!! when my dog cried i gave him a little teddy and it made him stop...it's just because it's lonely trust me she will grow out of it!<br>  Hope I helped!!!|`|EWA7UoIPaa	I had this problem with my puppy when I first got him, although he was in a cage, I found that since I was the one spending the most time with him that at night time I took an old t-shirt that I wore around the house that day and placed it in his cage at night. He seemed to cry less and maybe he felt more secure. |`|VJnmHFR0aa	Just give it a few more days, if some one whipped you away from your mum and siblings when you were only a few weeks old you'd make noise too.|`|poyUrbQ1aa	Yh that is the problem!<br>  All so have she/he got some toys to play with?<br>  If you can't stop it perhaps get another day/puppy that mite be the answer too! <br>  <br>  I hope this help's<br>  <br>  x|`|YcLfAi6Qaa	Just throw her out of the window!|`|aCqSF87Raa	Before leaving her alone, exercise her so she doesn't have as much energy to howl and fuss. Leave SAFE toys for her to play with - Kongs with treats, Nylabone, etc. When she barks, do NOT go to her or you will re-enforce the barking (IE she barks, you come, she gets what she wants.)<br>  <br>  I would look into crate training. If pups or new dogs have too much space they tend to get nervous. By giving them a den, you give them a place that is secure and small. It will also help her learn how to hold her bowels/bladder for longer periods of time.|`|9kTejB0uaa	As I have said before to this kind of problem, if you saw your puppy as she was just a few days ago, in with her siblings, you would understand how she now feels her whole world has turned upside down. <br>  <br>  Yes, get a crate.  Put it in a quiet place, cover the top and three sides so it's a little den for her.   No, don't leave the back door open (dad when you leave at 4.30) - small wonder your neighbours don't appreciate that!!  By all means put her out to do her business, but then give her a biscuit and settle her down again.<br>  <br>  This too shall pass (once she's settled into her new routine).|`|it3ecbVEaa	Hi there, is she a puppy if so try putting a piece of clothing in her basket that you have worn or someone in the house has worn, or put a cuddly teddy in her bed with her, she is missing company and doesn't want to be on her own, she will eventually get used to being on her own, i have had 4 puppies over the last 3 years and found this to work.<br>  Hope all goes well for you.|`|f0egZ7Sdaa	More info please...<br>  <br>  Can you re-write this using a little more punctuation? I'm not exactly sure what the problem is, or what it is that you're trying to ask.|`|yLV3uOfwaa	It could just be that she is scared. When I got my puppy, my brother slept on the sofa near him for about four days, and then he slept alone.|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	It's seperation anxiety, she's crying because she misses the pack. There are several ways to get her used to it.<br>  The first is to start small, leave the room for five minutes & then come back in. Don't give her fuss until she calms down! Once she's calm pet her as nomal. Do this several times in the day. Gradually increase the length of time you are away from her & eventually she will get used to it. <br>  However it does require strong willpower, you really have to stick to your guns & the whole of the household will have to treat her the same!<br>  <br>  Another method (& the one that worked for me!) was to simply get another dog! That cured all my problems instantly!

It is probably a shemale, and is in dire need of some male kittay. Cats howl/yowl when they are in heat, to attract a nearby male. If you have cats inside the house, she can probably sense that, and is trying to get their attention. If you don't have a cat in the house, well your just the lucky recipiant of a horny cat call.
D1beU6MPaa	When my Yorkie was a small puppy, I would tilt her head back and kiss her on the neck very fast. She loved it and would jump up on my chest and put her neck over my mouth so I would kiss it. One night my husband had an out of town co-worker that came to our house. This poor guy went into the den and sat down on the couch. All of a sudden, Dolly came running in the room, jumped up on this mans chest, and put her neck across his mouth. I guess she thought he came all the way to our house just to kiss her neck. We all laughed so hard, and the poor guy had no idea what she was doing.

While my Uncle and my dad were repairing an electric fence, the dog began antagonizing the cattle, including the 1500 lb bull.  The bull became irritated at the tiny dog and started chasing her. The dog ran right over to my father and sat down between his feet...<br>  <br>  That's also about the time we found out my father could jump over a five foot electric fence with room to spare. <br>  <br>  ahhhh....memories.|`|g6Vci5SUaa	Last year I brought home a new kitty, Maine Coon,  who wasn't afraid of my dog (she's huge: German Shepherd/Great Dane mix. I call her my pony LOL).<br>  <br>  When my new kitty lays at the end of my bed, my dog will come up and poke her nose at the kitty until the kitty starts to hiss and scratch.  As soon as the claws come out, my dog turns around so kitty scratches her butt.  When kitty calms down, my dog turns, pokes her nose at her, waits for the hiss, then gets a butt scratch again.  This can go on for a while, and I find it hilarious!  |`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	When my dog Spike was out on a walk along the playing fields on a windy day we happened across the binmen changing the back in one of the public bins. The wind got up and the nice new (& empty) binback went flying across the field. Of course Spike, being a lurcher decided to chase it! This was funny enough to start off with but then managed to wrap the tie strings around his hind! Again he thought this was great fun until he discovered that he couldn't actually get rid of the bag. Then he started to try and run away but of course (as the bag was still attached to him) the bag followed scaring him even more! Of course by this time he was absolutely howling because he couldn't get away from the bag which I found to be hilarious! Eventually he managed to get rid of it though & came back to us crying his poor little heart out. So I comforted him a bit & everything was alright after that!<br>  <br>  Then of course there was my old dog Bruce who had one hell of an attitude against swimmers at the beach. I took my cousin & Bruce to the beach & noticed a fairly young couple who had just put their paddling gear on (it was a warm day!) & run down into the sea. They left their clothes on the sand so they could put them back on later. So I got out of the car & let the dog out. I then went to pick my cousin out of the car too & turn round to see my lovely dog make a beeline straight for this couples clothes. I thought nothing on it, I thought he was going to run right past their clothes & jump in the water like he always does, how wrong I was! He stopped at their clothes & lifted his leg! Not only that, he started to hop all round the pile of clothes making sure he peed on every last bit! Of course I was shouting at him to come back but his selective deafness kicked in & he completely ignored me until he was finished. Of course the couple turned round after hearing me shout, just in time to see Bruce do his thing! They were understandably peeved off & told me that my dog should have been on the lead! I apologised as best I could (in between fits of laughter!) & then attempted to tell the dog off. Of course I didn't manage, ( I was still killing myself laughing!) so all I could do was walk off & continue my walk lol.|`|d5cd40a9a7f4215411f86af9ca4cea4eaa	one evening i was taking my nightly bath, and marley, our 8 month old border collie was in the bathroom with me. i was reclining and reading as usual, when suddenly i feel a paw on my tummy, then another...and then i realise that marley his crawling completely onto me and she then curls up like im a big pillow!.....im holding my book out. one arm on either side of her so..<br>  a. she wont fall in<br>  b. she wont freak and jump off and scratch the heck out of me<br>  c. i wont drop my book in the water.<br>   i start to laugh, i mean REALLY laugh, and she suddenly has one paw on either side of my neck and is licking my face. i am laughing SO hard and then she is licking inside my mouth and i cant stop her!!!  i finally was able to get her off of me, but not after a good couple of minutes of pure hilarity!!|`|xT024KMsaa	It is nice to have a lighter hearted thread for once. <br>  <br>  I have a 130 lb great dane and a daughter that just turned one- it works out better than most people think.

Next thing I know, I have a whiney baby of a dane at my knee nudging, crying and just begging "She took it!!  Get it back mom! Bones aren't for HER!!! Mine!".

Also now he thinks that if he takes a running jump, he will have a better chance of making it, and again, he doesn't. |`|nym1vKt7aa	In the winter time, we kinda get big drifts of snow and snow that goes up to my dog's chest (she's a medium sized dog), when she was younger (she has arthritis now, unfortunately, but its not that bad...), she used to bound and leap through the snow chasing after a mouse or a little animal, it was sooo cute to see... and when she lost the scent or something, she would stick her whole head into the snow... now when she thought she had the little animal, she would lift her whole front up and bring her feet down onto where she thought it was (with her ears up and everything), she was so cute and adorable and funny when she did that... |`|AA12324195	When my daughter was little she had a lab/shepherd mix.  The dog was "in love with" a huge stuffed blue dinosauer that was in her room.  One day we came home and found the dog laying on the couch and Dino laying on the floor below him.  He had apparently been "loving" the dinosauer upstairs and his collar got hooked on a big bow around the stuffed animal's neck, so he drug it downstairs with him because he couldn't get loose.  It was hilarious.<br>  The dog we have now, who is 12 years old was just a little puppy when my husband was painting our front porch with barn red paint.  The dog stepped on the pan the paint was in and he was covered with red paint.   We have pictures of that little incident.|`|pFwMIMLAaa	My mini dachshund Willow (in my pic) loves to stand like a meercat/ penguin/ whatever stand up right. : ) She does this to beg for food, she is even doing it in my default picture! When she does it her long body sort of sways back and forth, which is really funny to watch. I love it when Willow and my sister's dachshund do zoomies together and chase eachother super fast around the house too.<br>  <br>  The last funny thing Willow does is when she sees a squirlle outside she goes berzerk. She rund to the back door and starts jumping straight up and down until I let her out then she bounds/hops as fast as her little legs can move over to where the squirell is and the squirell just sits there wagging his tail at Willow making her go even more insane running along the fence trying to get him to come down.<br>  <br>  : )|`|m5MdWyLOaa	I had a pekingese that had ...well...it's noogy sack was pink with black polka dots, and VERY visible.

I was totally shocked to see something strongly built getting knocked down like that!!!

I have heard this is an extremely common trait with German Shepards, I know it has been with the ones I have owned in the past.  I would recommend consulting with a professional in your area that subscribes to the same training beliefs you do (ie, agreement on training collar types, behaviour modification tactics, etc). If you already have someone call them up and ask them about this behaviour. You do not want to have to correct a behaviour later that you can nip in the bud now. I made quite a few mistakes with my dog and it's a nightmare now to try and fix them. But I love her and I can't foist my mistakes on someone else lol. Good Luck|`|f34f4f025cc56607001373270581d5b2aa	He's a puppy. They are usually scared of stuff bigger than them (like people), or submissive to large people, or men. I wouldn't worry about it.|`|1598e8aee404bafbfdd38271737251c0aa	Take your dog to a Vet or other liscensed individual...there is<br>  something wrong|`|5ab29bc1d518719aaa96bb570e6334a6aa	Spend time with the puppy.  German Shepards usually get really close to one person and is really protective of that person.  Being a puppy its goin to do things like bark and nip and sometimes be timid just like a child when they are young shy at first then warm up to someone, and children also can be possessive as along with dogs.  So just spend time with u're puppy and i can almost gurantee you'll have a wonderful dog.|`|cf85fc6dd024c60de9b5cb73ce4250eaaa	Most likely the little guy is just scared. Everything is larger than him,he's still probably not fully used to being away from Mom yet... And he's in obedience training. That's a lot of changes for a little puppy. Just try to make the little guy comfortable,but don't reinforce the behavior.|`|5601261c585df8725ecd0d2301493b5caa	I recommend you watch Ceasars show, The Dog Whisperer on National geographic channel. I have a feeling the reason he tries to nip at other dogs is because he is being aggressive, and take the role of "pack leader." I think you should try and be more assertive and dominant to show you are the "pack leader" and make sure to correct him when he barks or nips at another dog. Do this by making him get into a submissive state by making him sit or lie down. The reason he continues to be timid around people may be because of your actions. Around another person, just walk straight up to them if you want your dog to meet them or if you want to talk to them. Don't think that he will pull away or shy away because dogs can sense that and if their pack leader is shy, they are too. Get it? and make sure he isn't hyper when he meets the person. I suggest making your dog lie down next to the person before they meet and make eye contact. (meaning ignore your dog until he is completely calm and submissive.) I learned all these things from the Dog Whisperer. Try and watch the show! There are a lot of dogs just like yours! Good luck!|`|9839a971c3bbaedc2e91e1566c9bc424aa	hees beeing extreamly territorial he dosent feel comfortable sharing you with other dogs and thats the main problem you just need to take him near more people so he bcomes cofortable with sharing you
TRganQA4aa	For the Papillon, the Cavalier King Charles, the Samoyed, or the Bichon (mine would be German Shepherd) I would pay 1500 or more if it was a well-bred dog tested for genetic defects with Champions in the Bloodline. For the Cavachon - no since they are a mixed-breed I could find at a shelter for a lower price.|`|pGacaRuFaa	Designer dogs are high dollar mongrels. People pay thousands of dollars for some of these dogs, which were originally accidents. There is a whole litter of chipoms at our area shelter right now who will be put to sleep if no one adopts them. Never buy a dog without seeing the parents in a show ring. otherwise it isn't the real thing. Breeding is best left to the pros. Get a shelter dog and save a life, instead.|`|oChOlCqYaa	It depends on the source and quality, not the cuteness. I would not pay one single penny to a back yard breeder, pet store or puppy mill (which is what 100% of people selling pups on the internet are). You may be saving that puppy but you are condemning it's parents and probably many siblings to a living hell. If I wanted a pup from a responsible and reputable breeder who had titled & health tested dogs, then yes, I would pay $1500 for it. Or I would go through a shelter or breed rescue and get a loving pet in need of a home for a fraction of that. <br>  <br>  ETA- Your cavachon (cavalier x bichon)  is also 100% guaranteed to come from a byb or a puppy mill - responsible and reputable breeders don't create mixes for profit.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	I would not pay that kind of money for a dog.  I love all dogs and would love to see more adopted from shelters rather than bought at exorbitant prices from puppy mills.  I have adopted 2 dogs.  The first is a beautiful pure bred Shih Tzu that came with her papers.  The second is a rat terrier/min pin mix & he's absolutely adorable.  |`|4sjW4Ig5aa	Not for any of those.<br>  <br>  My most recent addition, Cindy, is a chihuahua. Paid a grand for her, and she's worth every penny in the enjoyment she brings me. Her personality shined from the first moment I  saw her. She was mine that instant. I've not regretted it. Never will.|`|AXjwFoFxaa	Never.<br>  <br>  I think the bigger the dog the more expensive it should be, the smaller the least.<br>  <br>  I wouldnt pay $1500 for a "dog" when I could get a cat the same size for much less/|`|f0egZ7Sdaa	I paid $1K for ours... and would have paid $2K + if we were looking for a Champion show dog.<br>  <br>  As it is, he's a great pet quality dog, from a reputable AKC registered breeder.|`|JTxb2HR2aa	For a well-bred dog?  I would pay much more than that if I needed to. |`|aqYGE9HSaa	I spend that much on my Bichon Frise puppy|`|AA10245205	I would be willing to spend any amount of money on a dog that I loved, but not to BUY a dog.  I would NEVER buy a dog.  Like others have said, there are millions of great dogs in shelters and rescues waiting for good homes, and millions more are put down every day.  Yet people just continue to breed as if there just aren't enough dogs to go around.  I care nothing about whether a dog is pure bred or mixed breed, all I care about is if the dog needs my love.<br>  You are talking about buying a dog like talking about buying a designer purse.  "What if it was adorable?" ".... if it lasts you ten years?"  A dog is not an object to look pretty and "last you" a while.  You used the word 'love', but it seems you meant it in the context of, "I 'love' these jeans", as opposed to "I 'love' my mother".  You mean love, like 'you just gotta have it', not real love.  You strike me as the kind of person who wouldn't 'love' a dog very much after the first time it craps on your floor.  As soon as it did something that wasn't "adorable", the love would be over.<br>  |`|AA10918706	I paid $2000.00 for my Portuguese Water dog.  I wanted a dog that didn't shed and that was great with kids.  From your list, let me tell you that the Samoyed will shed like crazy.  Bichon's never get fully housebroken.  From your list, I'd pick either the Cavalier King Charles of the Cavachon.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Also, please be aware that vet bills can  be exhorbitant.|`|dSInbVQKaa	No<br>  No<br>  No<br>  No<br>  No<br>  But i would pay what ever it takes to get a breed i had researched and found the one i wanted, i would not even ask the price as to me it is the least important question to ask the breeder.  if you do enough Research then you will be happy with your choice no matter what the price.<br>  |`|f9sypcVkaa	Yes i would be willing to pay 1500$ for a dog. For me to pay that price it must be very cute, have papers and be microchipped. If it does not include any of that i would not be willing to pay that price. Yes i would pay 1500$ for the cavalier king charles spaniel and the other ones no. |`|gYeQ7yQyaa	There are many millions of dogs  getting put to death every year that need good homes- why not try adopting rather than continuing on the inbreeding of a very small gene pool of dogs? Have you researched the major health problems that many of these "pure-bred" (in-bred) dogs suffer from due to the unnatural state of their gene-pool?|`|QBIqNrdIaa	I have to agree with waiting, it is truly deplorable how many dogs are euthanized each year because someone was careless in breeding practices, just want to "make money", or irresponsible owners. I recently adopted a puppy. I saw my guy online. I went in there and because he was in the back I couldn't find him in the regular kennels. I DID see hundreds of dogs looking at me with the same expression, just wanting to go home. It is possible to love a mixed breed dog the same as a purebred.  Do yourself and an animal a favor and head to your nearest shelter.  |`|9POUmVMGaa	I wouldn't pay that much unless it was purebred (with papers) had no undesirable features, and it or it's parents were champions (papers to prove it). Or it was raised for a certain thing (a good hunting puppy will easily sell for $300). I would say $1500 is a little much unless it is rare and a champion.|`|vobrfrLWaa	No, I wouldn't.  $1500 is a cheap car or a mortgage payment.  If somehow I had that kind of cash, that puppy better be show quality with a stellar pedigree and have extensively health tested parents.  Shelling out $1500 to support a back yard breeder or puppy miller? Heck no!<br>  <br>  If I was really into the breed, I would look into that breed's rescue groups and adopt one.  |`|U9Sx6uwJaa	If i had all the money in the world, I would be willing to spend whatever just as long as I could make it better.

I'm sure that someone like Bill Gates would be willing to pay more for a "pet" than I would, but I doubt that he has spent as much on dogs as I have.<br>  <br>  Here is an example of what some people spend on their dogs.<br>  This is "Uno" the Beagle that won Westminster.<br>  <a href="http://i396.photobucket.com/albums/pp43/blunderpic/dogs/127.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i396.photobucket.com/albums/pp43/...</a><br>  When he travels he gets his own seat on the plane just like you would.

kv42U6yraa	Here are my best tips to have prevent this:<br>  <br>  #1 don't make it a big deal when your coming home. Act like everything is normal, as if you never left.<br>  #2 ignore her completely. No touching, talking to eye contact. Give her the cold shoulder until she calms down---even if it takes all day!<br>  #3 don't let her do anything, such as get a treat, praise, belly rub, toy, etc. while she is excited. She must only get those "goodies" when she is calm<br>  #4 talk in a calm, low voice. No high-pitch praise or anything like that, which only increases the hyperness<br>  #5 when she is calm and sitting, that is when you give her praise. She'll soon catch on that that's when she needs to be a good girl|`|7ciDto6Daa	When you come into the door, don't quickly show her affection yet. wait until she calms down. ignore her for a few minutes.

Then when shes calm, you can show her love and affection.<br>  good luck.|`|ffd3Ac41aa	Every time anyone walks in just ignore her until she calms down. Do not talk to her or pet her until she's calm, this will show her the sooner she is calm the sooner the will get the attention.|`|n6YKy4dxaa	Where I go for puppy training, they teach the positive reinforcement method.  If it is possible, ignore your dog until she learns not to jump up.  She's looking for attention (even though she already gets plenty) and any kind of attention will do for her, whether she's in trouble or getting praise.  If possible, ignore her and go about your business like she's not there until she realizes she won't get attention by jumping.  Or if you don't like the positive reinforcement, spank her while saying no as she's in the act of jumping at you (you know with her front paws on you) and then make her sit and say good dog.  Make sure to distinguish between the 2 acts though. |`|KVButy80aa	here are some suggestions.<br>  -  Ignore the dog everytime you come home or been away for a while.<br>  -  Turn your back towards her and walk away from her when she begins to jump.<br>  -  Take her to obedience classes to help her with this issue.<br>  -  When she begins expressing acceptable behavior, then reward her with treats and affection.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	When she jumps and gets excited, point your finger at her and say "NO" in a harsh voice! (But never hit her!) Say "get down" also, when she goes crazy like this, give her a rawhide or bone or something to calm her  down and distract her. You might also want to check into "behavior classes" at a vet clinic or petsmart?!|`|c54a3eea4cd10ea9391a4f094b12dd72aa	don't make a big fuss of seeing her ever. for example, when you come home from work, quickly pet her on the head once or twice then ignore her for a few minutes. after she calms down, you can pay attention to her & be affectionate with her.|`|90bxpKCOaa	Get her a boyfriend to distract her.|`|87QWi3lWaa	You don't pay attention to her when she's try to leap up on you like that...only once she sits or calming walks up to you. You have to make sure both you and your children follow through with the method tho, because if you don't then it's pretty much like praising her for jumping up on you.<br>  <br>  I don't know if you've ever watched "It's Me or The Dog" on Animal Planet but Victoria Stilwell (the trainer) did an episode with a dog that had this behavior and it's amazing how well this type of training works!<br>  <br>  For more tips on this training method this website will be helpful...<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Stop-a-Dog-From-Jumping" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Stop-a-Dog-From-J...</a><br>  <br>  Also if your interested in finding that episode...<br>  <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/tv/its-me-or-dog/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://animal.discovery.com/tv/its-me-or...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this Works!<br>  |`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	Ignore her until she does calm down, the whole family will have to do this & you will have to be consistant with it! Once she calms down then give her some fuss & she should soon realise that she needs to stay calm for you!|`|H5vB645faa	Training, training, training.<br>  I have found that bringing your knee up along with a sharp no as she tries to jump helps. Keep working on it.  Don;t give up.  Sounds like she really loves you.  She simply needs to learn.
AA12237913	The best way is to ask your parents, relatives, parents' friends, and neighbors if they know someone who owns a ranch or something similar for you to apply to. Don't be afraid to ask and don't expect too much in terms of pay, but you have to start somewhere.<br>  <br>  If you don't know anyone, I'd look up in the phone book or internet for ranches. Then I would write a letter and send a resume explaining your passion and experience with horses or animals. Tell them your age and ask for a small salary.<br>  <br>  Be persistent and don't give up. Jobs don't come to you, you have to go find them. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|AA12002954	Why dont u go to one of the ranches out there in ur area and introduce urself...and then let them know that youre interested in working there.....you could just try...it wouldnt hurt|`|AA11112418	Well, first you would need a workers permit to be able to get a job. Then you have to just go around and ask the owners of local ranches and see if they have work you can do. Then you have to get your parents to drive you there or find alternate means of transportation. This is why companies usually don't hire 15 and younger is that the person has to depend on someone else for transportation.

hktbfRPWaa	Sadly a lot of owners can't control their dogs and other innocent dogs are hurt. But you can't always be worrying about that. It is unlikely to happen and if you train your dog well and avoid those who look bad (can't always tell, but you tend to learn who is nice and who isn't) you should be fine.<br>  <br>  When off their leads it is actually easier - your dog can run and/or defend itself. Otherwise you get wrapped up in it all and may not just be the dog who gets hurt.<br>  <br>  Just be careful, although never stop your dog being social. They tend to have good judgement.<br>  <br>  All owners who know their dogs are vicious should stay away from parks and open areas. Not always the case - some owners can be as bad as the dogs. But don't let this stop you taking it to the park and letting it run around. The dog will love you for it.<br>  <br>  Edit: Just something else I thought I should point out, don't show you are worried and don't show you have a fear of your dog meeting others because you will make the dog worry and really there is nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  Around where I live there are some dogs who I can tell would love to play, but their owners pick them up and walk away! They assume they'll be attacked or they have a purebred and refuse to let them be dogs. Why they walk them where they know other dogs will be I don't know. Point is you'll meet lovely people and complete idiots, but never make the dog feel insecure. Just let it be a dog.|`|afcLu9YMaa	If you decide to get a dog, then also book some training classes.<br>  My concern is that you seem to be worried about OTHER DOGS and their aggression. You need to concern yourself about your dog (you can't do anything about other peoples dogs)<br>  <br>  At a good training class you should be taught the basics in obedience, how to socialise your dog with dogs and people (and other animals...my class has cats at it too, who live at the centre...without any problems and sheep & horses sometimes where some lead obedience work is done across their fields). <br>  <br>  You also need good recall skills and learn how to deal with another dog coming in your direction. Not all bigger, stronger dogs are aggressive and by displaying this anxiety your dog will pick up on it and display fear<br>  <br>  Fear in a dog is displayed by : fighting, fleeing (running away) freezing or fooling around.<br>  <br>  I also have to say if your dog is off lead and is unfortunate enough to get attacked if will be safer than if you were holding onto it on a lead and the other dog was attacking, at least is has an option to run or defend, whereas on a lead people hang on to it and unfortunately I see many owners who have done just this and their dog was terribly injured, but they were too frightened to let go of the lead because they never bothered teaching good recalls or social skills in a training class and their dogs gave off negative body language to the dogs who attacked them.|`|hNCiw6Laaa	Most owners who have troublesome dogs will lead their dog up when they see you. But you can't rely on this! Bitches tend to be the more aggressive. This is always a worry of mine and you learn to look for troublesome signs. My ***** is real friendly when out but can be protective of her toys at home!!|`|4higWvgaaa	Yep, don't take your dog to the park, go somewhere else.|`|qyHSDsgVaa	Any aggressive dog should be on the lead and if they are not then the owner can be reported.  An aggressive dog would probably attack any other dog not just labs.  You do get some people saying their dog doesn't like big black dogs/small white dogs, whatever but 99% of people you'll meet in the park will be responsible dog owners who you'll get to know and chat with.<br>  <br>  If you want a dog then get one, labs are fantasic although they do eat everything that they can get lol<br>  |`|tudu6wjcaa	You shouldnt let your dog off the lead unless it comes back on command.<br>  <br>  That does my bloody head in!<br>  <br>  I have an akita cross who is pretty dam big for only being a year old. I let her run about but I know she will come back or stop on command.<br>  <br>  I keep an eye on her and if I see her eyeing up a lil child or another dog i get her to come back and stick the lead on her again.<br>  <br>  She wouldnt attack, she just loves to play, but if you are the owner of a small dog or a parent and you see my dog running towards you, you will get freaked out.<br>  <br>  I realise this and put myself in the other persons shoes, so if i think the park is too busy or she cant hear my commands, i dont let her off.<br>  <br>  A lot of other people however do not have that kind of control over their dogs and to be quite honest dont seem to give a f**k either.<br>  <br>  There was a post on here a while back by a girl whos dog was attacked on a beach and the attackers owner simply said something like "dogs will be dogs" to her and then walked off.<br>  <br>  Those are the kind of idiots you have to look out for.<br>  <br>  I say get yourself the dog, they are great companions, but make sure its trained up in basic obedience such as "stop" and "come back".<br>  <br>  I also say let it off the lead once in a while, but keep a close eye out tho for potential problems, be it small kids or idiots with dogs that they are clearly not in control of.<br>  <br>  You will soon be able to spot them a mile off.<br>  <br>  Have fun and I hope this helps!|`|0J1cYbXQaa	Go along to your park and watch other dogs playing happily together all off lead to reassure yourself that dogs are playing with each other in many parks across the country without any harm coming to them, dogs should be socialised well to enable them to mix with other dogs you will occasionally see a dog which is not socialised who is likely to be on a lead belonging to an owner who believes in not allowing dogs to mix with other dogs so keep your dog away from them. |`|Ufv79qBNaa	My 13stone French Mastiff was attacked by a Lab a couple of weeks ago. Him being a gentle giant didnt retaliate.<br>  My Point - Just because its a lab doesnt mean its a perfect pet, they can turn viscious as any dog. Keep yours on a lead you should be OK.

Any responsible dog owner will tell you that. Also if left off the lead dogs tend to get along better as there is more freedom of movement & they do not feel that they have to protect you (so much) rather than simply get along and meet eachother! You should just play it by ear, ensure that your dog is properly trained and socialise & above ALL, do not worry that every dog that they meet will attack them, they won't, but they are far more likely to if you start worrying about it! They can pick up on your emotional state & are more likely to react accordingly!<br>  <br>  You should also be careful not to label 'rough play' which is what most dogs do, as fighting. It's just the way that they socially interact with eachother!

WhBLb5Muaa	 <br>  la contingencia extraordinaria del mosquito;<br>  lo que se conoce generalmente del mosquito es que chupa sangre y se alimenta de ella.<br>  sin embargo esto no esta totalmente correcto porque no todos los mosquitos, sino solamente las hembras succionan sangre.ademas la hembra no lo hace porque necesite alimento, tanto el macho como la hembra se alimentan del nectar de las flores . la unica razon por lo que la hembra, a diferencia del macho, succiona sangre, es la necesidad que tiene de proteinas para ayudar al desarrollo de los huevos. en otras palabras , lo hace para asegurarse de la perpetuacion de la especie.<br>  el proceso de desarrollo es uno de los aspectos mas admirables y sorprendentes del mosquito, la historia resumida de la trasformacion de un ser viviente a partir de una peque?a larva, pasando por distintas etapas, en un mosquito, es de la manera que sigue.<br>  los huevos , alimentados con sangre para que se desarrollen, son depositados por la hembra sobre hojas humedas o charcas que se han secado durante el verano o el oto?o. antes de hacer eso la madre inspeciona el terreno totalmente por medio de delicados receptores ubicados bajo el abdomen . despues de encontrar el lugar conveniente, comienza a depositar los huevos, los cuales , de una longitud menor de un milimetro, son dispuestos en filas, uno por uno o en grupo, algunas especies depositan en forma de jangada unos 300 huevos...<br>  <br>  .........................................<br>  otro estudio , de porque pican los mosquitos..<br>  <br>  la respuesta al enigma de por que unas personas son mas propensas que otras a las picaduras de los mosquitos podria encontrarse en la emicion de ciertas se?ales quimicas, segun los resultados de la investigacion de un equipo de cientificos britanicos.<br>  los investigadores comprobaron que ciertas personas podrian emitir determinados olores ocultos que impedirian que los mosquitos las localizaran; ese hallazgo podria abrir nuevas vias para el desarrollo de productos repelentes.<br>  los cientificos desarrollaron esta investigacion con el respaldo del consejo de investigacion en ciencias biologicas y de biotecnologia(bbsrc,por sus siglas en ingles) del reino unido y se apoyaron en estudios cientificos previos dirigidos por el profesor jonh pickett,del instituto rothamsted research, en inglaterra.<br>  el profesor pickett habia demostrado que el volumen de mosquitos concentrados en torno a una manada de reses dependia de ciertas vacas y , en concreto, de ciertas se?ales quimicas emitidas y relacionadas con su olor, si las vacas eran alejadas del reba?o aumentaba el numero de insestos entre las restantes.<br>  con base en resultados , james logan, miembro investigador del bbsrc, trabajo junto con jenny mordue, de la universidad de aberdeen en escocia, en el analisis de las reacciones de los mosquitos de fiebre amarilla frente a los olores emitidos por un grupo de voluntarios.<br>  en el experimento, los mosquitos fueron colocados en un tubo con forma "y" con la posibilidad de moverse a lo largo de cualquiera de las dos ramas. por ambas fluia aire cargado con olor de las manos de voluntarios distintos.<br>  los resultados del estudio sugieren que los distintos grados de atraccion de una otra persona ante los mosquitos dependeria de la existencia de ciertos compuestos que actuarian como repelentes o simplemente "esconderian" los componentes atractivos del olor humano. esta teoria difiere de la postula que los individuos " no atractivos" carecen de los elementos de atraccion.<br>  " la identificacion de los componentes clave y la comprension de como funcionan puede favorecer el desarrollo de nuevos metodos de proteccion ante las picaduras de insectos,que transmiten enfermedades y causan perdidas en el ganado", explico logan.<br>  |`|arcMqp3Oaa	AHHH! NO AMIGO!! Tu pregunta esta mal no pican los mosquitos sino las mosquitas pican cuando estan embarazadas pues normalmente tanto macho como hembra comen frutas pero al estar la hembra mosquita embarazada necesita mas vitaminas y mas alimento por eso chupa sangre y no solo sangre humana tambien pica a los animales, no sabes tu q los alces de canada suelen morir cuando son crias porque se meten en los lagos a quitarles la comida a los castores y salen todos las mosquitas y pican al alce hasta dejarle sin gota de sangre?|`|koHR68mmaa	Realmente nos pican las hembras y nos pican cuando van a poner huevos. Es decir, despues de aparearse y antes de poner la puesta las hembras necesitan los nutrientes que tiene la sangre para poder poner los huevos y que de estos nazcan mosquitos sanos que puedan seguir reproduciendo la especie. La mayoria de los animales viven para poder seguir reproduciendo su especie y que esta no se extinga. como por ejemplo el amantis que en el apareamiento la hembra se come al macho y este se deja, es porque la finalidad de vida del macho es esta ya que dejandose comer la hembra coje muchos nutrientes para cuando ponga los huevos y aunque parezca cruel, ellos saben que han nacido para perpetuar su especie y morir. |`|7zx2ju32aa	por que se alimentan de la sangre|`|uoAyMWoqaa	El mosquito, ha sido llamado el "máximo asesino humano", ya que debido a sus picaduras transmiten enfermedades que llevan a la muerte a 25,000,000 de personas anualmente. La más importante es el paludismo. <br>  El porque pican: El mosquito pica para poder completar el ciclo reproductivo de sus huevecillos, los cuales incuba un cierto tiempo en su interior,necesita de las proteínas de la sangre para que de ellas se alimenten sus futuras crías. La sangre que succionan, le extraen el agua, y entonces vuelven a picar, por eso un mosquito parece que no se "sacia" y sigue insistiendo. Las únicas que pican son las hembras, el macho se alimenta de polen y jugos de frutas y flores, se reconocen porque tiene unas "plumas" en vez de prosbócide, que es como se le nombra a la "lanceta" de la hembra. Al picar inyecta un anticoagulante, para que no se cierren los capilares y así succionar la sangre. El prurito o "comezón" se produce cuando la saliva del mosquito queda en la piel, a su vez se produce una reacción histaminica, que es una subsatancia que se encuentra en la piel la que causa terible "comezón". Para seleccionar a sus "victimas", prefieren los colores oscuros, olores penetrantes, pican más a los animales que a los humanos, si quieres que no te piquen duerme con algún animal, prefieren las pieles oscuras, olorosas naturales, sudor, etc, más calientes (ejercicio, etc).<br>  Al picar pueden transmitir: paludismo, dengue, fiebre amarilla, oncocercosis, filiarasis, números parásitos (nemátodos),etc, lo que acumula muertes y lesiones por millones anuales.<br>  En algunos lugares como las estepas siberianas, son tan abundantes que pueden matar a un animal grande si lo ataca un enjambre  de mosquitos hambrientos. Por eso está muy limitada la conquista de esas zonas geográficas.|`|WsR2B0FBaa	holaa!!!!! por que ellos se alimentan de  nuestra sangre y tambien de la de los animales .. es  como que los mosquitos se preunten por que comen vacas? por que vivimos de eso ... entiendes ?? suerte chauu|`|YqqbOL4iaa	Jajja creo que es una pregunta muy obvia...<br>  Los mosquitos son insectos que se alimentan de la sangre, Obviamente no solamente de sangre humana, tambien se alimentan de sangre animal...<br>  <br>  Besoteeee|`|K0F8LGg3aa	si...la verdad que es muy obvio...ellos se alimentan de sangre y es muy interesante lo que dice la chica de arriba...asi que si no quieres que te piquen lavate bien las patas ;)|`|vtRWxijAaa	porque nomas anda viendo a quien fastidian.<br>  <a href="http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aq2CvQgVqlmYyLO7shZCt32Y8gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20080816122506AAD7mVL">http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|FTujvIWcaa	xk nuestra sangre es su alimento, igual k para nosotros la carne, vegetales,.. son nuestro alimento<br>  espero k haya resuelto tu duda<br>  <br>  xao|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Nos pican solamente los mosquitos hembras que son hematófagos, es decir se alimentan de sangre.

5SIF6XOHaa	perdonada.<br>  si sabrás todos los mamíferos producen leche.<br>  por esos se les llama mamífero por las MAMAS. a parte de que gestan a sus crías dentro del abdomen de la madre.<br>  ahora la cuestión es que nos han hecho creer que la leche es la única fuente de calcio de la que podríamos obtener, <br>  pero la verdad es que hay infinidad de alimentos que contiene calcio y que la leche no necesariamente seria indispensable.<br>  yo en lo personal creo que despuésde que se originaron las cd. y que la gente necesita más insumos alimenticios y que se dieron cuenta de que, preferentemente la producciónn de carne de res era o es de los machos, ya que las hembras las dedican para la reproduccion y que si vendian la leche, que en teoria se deberia de comer el becerro, le sacarian mas dinero a las vacas, que nada mas por las crias, por eso nos vendienro la idea de que la leche es indispensable y que hay que tomar diario leche.<br>  lo curios es que cuando menos en mexico la produccion de leche de todas las vacas se dedica a la produción de queso y sub productos como yogurt o suero de queseria, y no de leche para el consumo. asi que la leche que tomas, que te venede en la tienda en bote, refrigerada, botella o pasteurizada o en polvo no es de  las vacas sino que es con sub produtos de la preparacion de los quesos o en su defecto de leche de vegetales como la soya o quimicos.<br>  seguiras tomando leche?<br>  zimba medico veterinairo.|`|pj1uh35Oaa	es que las vacas son del genero bobino y por ende mamiferos. de esa forma para alimentar a sus crias lo hace por las mamas (de ahi el nombre) Ese alimento es el que denominamos leche,  el cual tiene distintos sabores dependiendo de la vaca.<br>  <br>  Ahora ocupamos esa leche ya que es la que mas se parece a la humana, proveniente de las mujeres.

Es como las madres que dan de mamar a sus hijos hasta los dos a?os, realmente si tu le sigues dando de mamar el cuerpo te sigue dando leche hasta que tu lo dejes y cuando dejas de darle de mamar no vuelve a subirte la leche, pues con las vacas es lo mismo lo que pasa que nunca dejan de orde?arlas. |`|m8UuY0t4aa	hola<br>  <br>  la verdad es que las vacas dan leche para sus crias , pero lo que hacemos los humanos es quitar la leche para el beneficio de nosotros ya que su leche es muy nutritiva<br>  <br>  saludos|`|RjgvfUF5aa	hola.<br>  para que den leche tiene que estar amamantado a su becerro.<br>  <br>  chao chao|`|hoL3kmc5aa	Ehhhhhhh si yo fuera mal pensado, pensaria en otra cosa 8======D<br>  jajajaja.

Milk and dark chocolate can be poisonous mainly due to the cocoa in the ingredients. It's definitely not a good idea to let him have any more & you should keep an eye on him just incase. <br>  <br>  for future reference, here's a list of dangerous substances straight from wikipedia:<br>  <br>  Dangerous substances<br>  Human food. Some foods commonly enjoyed by humans are dangerous to dogs, including chocolate (Theobromine poisoning), onions, grapes and raisins,[62] some types of gum, certain sweeteners[63] and Macadamia nuts. The only known dangerous substance in chocolate is cocoa, so the danger of white chocolate is uncertain. The acute danger from grapes and raisins was discovered around 2000, and has slowly been publicized since then. The cause is not known. Small quantities will induce acute renal failure. Sultanas and currants may also be dangerous. Alcoholic beverages pose comparable hazards to dogs as they do to humans, but due to low body weight and lack of alcohol tolerance they are toxic in much smaller portions. <br>  Plants. Plants such as caladium, dieffenbachia and philodendron will cause throat irritations that will burn the throat going down as well as coming up. Hops are particularly dangerous and even small quantities can lead to malignant hyperthermia.[64] Amaryllis, daffodil, english ivy, iris, and tulip (especially the bulbs) cause gastric irritation and sometimes central nervous system excitement followed by coma, and, in severe cases, even death. Ingesting foxglove, lily of the valley, larkspur and oleander can be life threatening because the cardiovascular system is affected. Yew is very dangerous because it affects the nervous system. Immediate veterinary treatment is required for dogs that ingest these. <br>  Household poisons. Many household cleaners such as ammonia, bleach, disinfectants, drain cleaner, soaps, detergents, and other cleaners, mothballs and matches are dangerous to dogs, as are cosmetics such as deodorants, hair coloring, nail polish and remover, home permanent lotion, and suntan lotion. Dogs find some poisons attractive, such as antifreeze (automotive coolant), slug and snail bait, insect bait, and rodent poisons. Antifreeze is insidious to dogs, either puddled or even partly cleaned residue, because of its sweet taste. A dog may pick up antifreeze on its fur and then lick it off. <br>  Animal feces. Dogs occasionally eat their own feces, or the feces of other dogs and other species if available, such as cats, deer, cows, or horses. This is known as coprophagia. Some dogs develop preferences for one type over another. There is no definitive reason known, although boredom, hunger, and nutritional needs have been suggested. Eating cat feces is common, possibly because of the high protein content of cat food. Dogs eating cat feces from a litter box may lead to Toxoplasmosis. Dogs seem to have different preferences in relation to eating feces. Some are attracted to the stools of deer, cows, or horses.[65] <br>  Other risks. Human medications may be toxic to dogs, for example paracetamol/acetaminophen (Tylenol). Zinc toxicity, mostly in the form of the ingestion of US cents minted after 1982, is commonly fatal in dogs where it causes a severe hemolytic anemia.[66] Some wet dog and cat food was recalled by Menu Foods in 2007 because it contained a dangerous substance.[67] |`|3SXBGIY7aa	This site (near the bottom) has a list of certain kinds of chocolate, and how much of each kind will affect your dog.  It also links to another page that describes what to do in case your dog has ingested a large amount of chocolate that may harm him.|`|i75IwOSMaa	chocolate can be very dangerous for dogs.

f0egZ7Sdaa	Any dog with teeth can bite. So, to answer your question... Yes.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	It really depends on how they are raised.  Also the temperment of the dam and sire.

P0Fjh59Eaa	You need to wait till her HEAT (not period) is over. they last about 3 weeks. then you can have her fixed.<br>  <br>  You can get these little dog covers called BitchBriches<br>  <br>  here is a link-<br>  <a href="http://www.kennelkomforts.net/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=BB1" rel="nofollow">http://www.kennelkomforts.net/Merchant2/...</a><br>  <br>  they are like dog "panties" and you use a regular human sanitary napkin (pad) in them. lol sounds silly but it's how you have to deal with the mess till you can get her fixed.|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	You can get "doggie diapers" at the pet store.  These are little panties that the female wears when she's in season.  <br>  <br>  The good news is that the extremely messy period only lasts a few days.  The entire heat cycle lasts about 21 days, but the copious bleeding doesn't.  <br>  <br>  And yes, unless your dog is an absolutely stellar example of her breed i.e., a show champion, you do need to get her fixed.  But not now.  Most vets recommend you wait until the dog is out of season before you have the spay surgery because everything is swollen and engorged and there is danger of excessive bleeding from the surgery.|`|Bw18seFqaa	She will be in heat for approx 3 weeks..  she may bleed during that entire time.<br>  <br>  If you can prevent a pregnancy, its not reccomended to spay during heat.  There's an increased risk of complications because of the swelling and bleeding.<br>  <br>  Its best to ride it out and spay her after her heat cycle.  You can invest in some dog panties to prevent her from bleeding everywhere..  most petshops sell them.|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	You only have to get her fixed if you don't plan on breeding her otherwise just leave her as she is. I'm pretty ssure that you can buy dog nappies now for this kind of thing or simply put a pair of crap underwear on her! |`|oChOlCqYaa	Yes, if you get her spayed she will not bleed any more. If you don't she will have 2 heat cycles a year, each lasting a few weeks. Plus you will risk her getting pregnant and contributing to the pet overpopulation problem. |`|AP3XIQLYaa	If u don't want to breed her u can get her spayed at the humane scioty for free.

U can't find themat petco, pet smart and places like that :)|`|1dc6e0c5f71ea21147ddb2e3e9b84a64aa	Most Vets won't spay her during her heat cycle, simply due to the fact that everything is swollen. You can put a diaper on her to contain the blood. You may try preemie diapers, those should be small enough.<br>  Just cut a small opening for the tail and whatever you do, don't let her near a male dog or she will most likely end up pregnant.<br>  After her heat cycle is over take her to a Vet and have her spayed, than you won't have that problem anymore.|`|fuLrdCHIaa	you can get puppy diapers they work wonders!!!!|`|VbNPlom3aa	Go to a pet store and get "bitches britches".  They are designed for dogs in heat so she is not bleeding all over the place.  Then please get her spayed.|`|vpnpR6Woaa	You think?  Of course she needs to be fixed!  I don't mean to sound harsh but if you're not planning on breeding her then please go get her spayed.
tJKLM9vbaa	I have two dogs which were done last year and from experience, I would guess that he probably wont be frantic lol. <br>  <br>  Your dog will most likely be very sleepy from the drugs and will have trouble getting in and out of the car when you take him home. Be very careful lifting him in and out of the car cos you could upset his stitches. <br>  If he is small, be careful for other things that may catch on his stitches such as the rim of his bed (if it plastic) and high doorsteps.<br>  <br>  Watch carefully how he reacts to his stitches. When my dogs were done, they kept trying to lick the area. If he has a go at them you could always buy one of those lamp shade collar things that you can buy them from the vet. Your obviously gonna be the best judge of this because you will know whether or not he will be left alone for a long time, and whether or not he will try and clean himself. I would recommend that you put a vet collar on him whenever your not there to supervise him.|`|gMsV1yIDaa	When you are home and can keep an eye on your dog to stop him licking his wound, keep the collar off, but never leave him on his own without it. My last dog used to walk into walls and just stand there stuck until someone rescued her, bless her!  He wil be ok I am sure, not too frantic. At least you have taken the responsible step and had your dog neutered.|`|6KyyhE0Xaa	It can take them a while to get used to it and at first he will whack it off everything, including your legs! - until he learns he's slightly wider than  normal.  <br>  <br>  Even if he really hates it, it's best to keep it on and only have it off when you can fully supervise him and stop him if he makes a move for the stitches.<br>  <br>  Your vet clinic should give you the rest of the instructions when you go in to collect hom tomorrow night . :)|`|xEXb96UKaa	i had my dog neutered 3 weeks ago and i was surprised when the vet said he didn't need the lampshade thing. i bought one at a petshop anyway in case he licked the would excessively, but it turned out that it really didn't bother him very much and left the stiches pretty much alone.<br>  but i suppose it depends on the dog.|`|AA11181101	usually they will sleep and its best to leave them to it your vet will give you all the after care you need to know <br>  he may be a little upset about having his lampshade on but if you can shout at him not lo lick himself then he will not need it. im in the uk and with all the dogs and cats we have had we have never been given a lampshade after a spey and this has never caused any problems they have never pulled stitches or any thing like that|`|mfXDUkRYaa	I've just had my dog spayed, which is a much bigger op but all went well.<br>  <br>  I bought her a 'Comfy Collar' - basically a rubber ring that attaches to her collar - to prevent her from licking the wound as she didn't like the buster collar (I think I didn't like it more though). I had to keep her really calm but I would imagine it is not so important with a boy dog. Just follow your vet's advice and you'll be fine. He'll be back to normal in no time.|`|EVQzvOodaa	They do seem pitiful when they have those things on but it is best to keep it on at least till the stitches are removes it you allow him to lick the area it can cause the incision to open back up or cause an infection |`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	When one of my dogs got done he would never accept the cone. All we could do was keep an eye on him and tell him off as soon as he went for the stitches. He soon got the hint and left them alone!|`|t1xQgysGaa	my dog got that and he tried to lick the area but you have to keep him form licking them or the stitches could come off
veDvtYhJaa	Well, to be honest, if he refuses to poop on leash, then HE is the Pack Leader, and YOU are NOT!  <br>  <br>  You need to google crate training and learn how to train him to a crate.  So long as he doesn't have worms, he should not poop or pee in his crate.  <br>  <br>  Victoria Stillwell says to not feed solids after the evening meal, at 6 or 7pm.  I believe in not restricting liquids, but I've heard her tell people to only allow the dogs liquids by leaving out some ice cubes for them at night.  This DOES reduce their liquid intake.  <br>  <br>  Age 3 is really awfully old to still be trying to housetrain the dog.  <br>  You should google house training a shar-pei and read the websites that come up -!-|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Start at the beginnig, crate at night, and set an alarm to take him out.<br>  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.<br>   <br>  REVISIONS: <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.<br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.<br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them. <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.|`|Qc0x3Ldaaa	Extend the lead.  You can do this by simply attaching one leash to another.  This gives him more room to navigate.<br>  |`|1QvJRmpHaa	always take him out to go to the toilet 10 minutes before u put him to bed<br>  <br>  and try taking him outside every hour and a half or so<br>  so he knows thats when he has to do<br>  <br>  when he poos inside say NO in a harsh tone but dont try to punish him coz dogs dont udnerstand what theyre being punished for<br>  <br>  talk to u vet if this doesnt help or take him to an obedience/toilet trainingclass|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	Why not take him somewhere where you can let him off the lead? Praise him when he does do his business outside, ignore him when he doesn't. Eventually he will take the hint!|`|YWUjeTnUaa	Have a set scheduled feeding time for your dog. I feed mine at 6 o'clock every evening, that way I can let them out before I go to bed. I do not leave the leftovers down either, when they walk away and lay down, their bowls get emptied. <br>  <br>  It will take a few evenings to retrain him, but he will get it, shar-pei are smart dogs! Start by getting a pet odor eliminator to mop the floors with. This will get rid of any "marked" spots to potty. If you own or can borrow a crate put him in it at night after his feedings. About 30 minutes after he eats, take him outside for a stroll. If he doesn't poop then, take him out every 30 minutes. My dogs won't potty close to the house, so get as close to the edge of the property as you can. Give him time too, sometimes it can take my dogs 15 minutes to find just the right spot! If he doesn't poop, put him back in the crate till the next walk, dogs seldom poop where they sleep. <br>  <br>  When he does finally poop outside, make sure to give him a treat immediately and praise him. He will associate pooping outside with good things.|`|Zd0MWKu2aa	If you can wake up during the night atleast once and take him out the less chance there is he'll pee on your floor. Eventually just lessen how much you take him out at night till you dont have to. He'll learn that its much better to wait and go pee outside. This might work, hope its helpful.|`|V6DL2dRvaa	go to a dog trainer..<br>  <br>  <br>  or just train him yourself<br>  you will need a lot of pateience<br>  <br>  but it shall b worth it<br>  <br>  each time he looks like he needs to pee you tell him where to go<br>  <br>  and sooner or later he will learn|`|qYOUJyFFaa	that shar pei is old. the older you dog, the lesser ability to lean.  you might have a dificulty on teaching

Water heaters are needed especially during winter and other cold months when the temperature in a room is lower than 20°C (68°F). On the other hand, usually all fish species should survive temperature about 20°C because of a simple reason; <br>  <br>  Water temperature in the wild usually varies from 18°C up to 30°C during 1 day! Bear in mind, that any creek or river is colder in the night and the temperature raises as the sun moves up in the skies. Of course, rooms usually offer stable conditions and very low temperature is very rare.<br>  <br>  The second reason why you maybe need a warmer is that the fish you keep need high temperature for breeding purposes. Generally, fish will breed at about 27°C. In my experience, there are more important factors which will determine if any fish will breed. For example, stable chemistry, water current, pressure or so. All of my fish have bred successfully at 25°C.<br>  <br>  I suggest For best fish tank heater product, you must go for >>><a href="http://www.agritura.com/index.php/cat/c362_Technical-Components.html/category/Technical-Components" rel="nofollow">http://www.agritura.com/index.php/cat/c3...</a>|`|dbZvPW3Haa	i have neon's, mollies, loaches and had a shark the temp will be fine at 26-30 my water is at about 26C 79F my fish are fine in fact better than fine I keep having loads of fry, so I believe they are quite happy.|`|OrrBFE1yaa	You don't need a heater for these fish.

Heartgard is the best heartworm preventative and it's cheap, but you will have to buy Frontline or Advantix to get any decent flea prevention, and those flea preventatives are extremely expensive!  Stay away from Revolution-- it is far inferior in both flea prevention AND heartworm prevention.  I work at a vet clinic and our docs only recommend either Sentinel or Heartgard and Frontline together.  Don't use the store bought stuff.  Worthless!
s76aC4G8aa	No unfortunately that's not it.  She must receive a certificate of heath from your vet a recent certificate. She must be up to date on ALL shots including rabies, dog must be microchipped and treated for ticks and tapeworm, a blood test is done and you cannot travel for six months after the blood test has been done providing it had satisfactory results to make sure the rabies vaccine sufficiently protected the dog.  There are customs forms that need to be filled out before being allowed into the UK, the pet must have a passport issued now I'm not sure if that's for animals leaving the UK to travel to other countries or not.  They can be quarantined for 6 months once they enter the UK, there are procedures to follow and forms to fill out to allow the dog into the UK without being quarantined.  the airlines that fly to the UK are British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, United Airlines & Delta.  check with one of these airlines, if they do the dog must be able to fit in a carrier that fits under the seat, if it's too big they will not permit the dog on board.  Also the trip to England is quite a long flight [up to 7 to 10 hours in duration].  Are you moving the the UK?  if not then don't take your dog with you, the stress and quarantine and paperwork required to bring your dog into the country is not worth it.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Here are the rules for taking a pet into the UK:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/quarantine/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/quaranti...</a><br>  <br>  It looks like as long as the dog is old enough for the rabies vaccine you should be ok.  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure of any airline that would allow you to take a pet in the cabin without purchasing a seat.  Even that is doubtful is that they have to consider that other passengers could have allergies.|`|gdJQxAPiaa	I think dogs/cats/ and puppies under 20lbs are allowed under your seat in their crate.<br>  <br>  I think there's a period of time that your pet had to be healthy before you can bring them to England, and there's probably other things to consider if you plan on bringing the pup back.<br>  <br>  Different places have different diseases so they may have rules that are more strict than you'd think.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here's a site for bringing the pup back to the us <a href="http://foreignborn.com/visas_imm/entering_us/2bringyourpet.htm" rel="nofollow">http://foreignborn.com/visas_imm/enterin...</a><br>  <br>  And these people say that they will transfer your pet without quarantine <a href="http://www.petmovers.com/?gclid=CL7orYy_rJYCFQQrFQodz2qkyg" rel="nofollow">http://www.petmovers.com/?gclid=CL7orYy_...</a>|`|5tnUKph5aa	If it is for a vacation, ask a travel agent. last I knew they still had 6 week quarantine period if you are moving there. And you will have to call airlines to find out if they will allow any dogs in the cabin, but due to people having dog allergies, the chances are most will not. Also the Airline should know if they will allow dogs to be brought into England.
yOz6GY44aa	Yes. Consistent water changes to keep the water pristine. This will help prevent secondary infections. If you have any tea tree oil, you can make a small mix of homemade Melafix. You use 1 milliliter oil to 100 milliliters of water. You need to really, really shake it up well and use asap because it won't have the emulsifiers that store-bought Melafix has. So, it will separate as soon as you stop shaking. Then dose with 1 tsp solution to 10 gallons water.  Here's the link to where I found it: <a href="http://www.thepufferforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=2511" rel="nofollow">http://www.thepufferforum.com/forum/view...</a>|`|79df02f6727268ac3d9c091da9bffbb1aa	well if its gold fish, make sure the water isnt too warm nor too cold, apparently gold fish cant breathe in warmish water so it has to be more cold then warm if you get what i mean? as for anything else you cant really do anything without going to the pet store, my fish had the same problem, if it has while scaly skin this means the gold fish is becoming sick.|`|1592c885f8b61569e0e0bc02442d574caa	you could try some salt, or when the wind subsides try MELAFIX,really good stuff.|`|jSwtmhmVaa	hey take it out from other two  fish and put it in tap cold water this will do the job no lights please it kills the fish |`|HRHPmjtVaa	You should look into a salt bath. There is something else where I think you dip the fish in bleach. Look into that too..Hope I helped!|`|G032Flc3aa	If it were my fish and there was no obvious sign of injury other than losing the scales and I had separated it from the other fish as you have already done, I would wait and see what happens next, it may be that he is shedding the damaged scales and there is a silvery colour showing through but that won't harm him although he might look a bit odd.  Similarly if some of his scales turn black don't worry too much because this is fish bruising and it takes about two weeks to wear off. I think with the attack and being moved to a bowl he will be stressed and he needs some time to settle down again and will most likely be fine.  BTW you mentioned he is in a bowl, if it's a traditional small goldfish bowl you must be sure to keep it extra clean and aerated so that it doesn't become toxic. 
ImPkYWhOaa	It would be helpful with more details! How old are the puppies? Why do you think they are blind?<br>  ------<br>  <br>  Greyhounds are not know to have very many breed specific diseases, and certainly not blindness from what I can figure out. <br>  <br>  Inbreeding would only be a prpper answer if the problematic genes actually ran in the breed. Inbreeding doesn't "create" faulty genes in itself.<br>  <br>  It doesn't seem likely to be inherited, unless it is a rare gene, and and if the puppy is otherwise healthy and all the siblings are fine, it is probably a fluke of nature, like a mutation or something that went wrong during prenatal development.<br>  <br>  Maybe you'll find some answers by entering "congenital blindness dogs " in Google or Yahoo or other search engine.<br>  <br>  Sorry I can't be of more help.|`|AspOKxsnaa	More than likely inbreeding (also known as line breeding)<br>  <br>  This link will help explain: <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=17966340" rel="nofollow">http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/article...</a>|`|Xy6h9bADaa	best asking the vet. the mother could have had a deficiency of some kind when she was pregnant or it could be poor breeding or in breeding|`|oo797fp9aa	Pepper|`|rXPcy0x1aa	worms in their eyes|`|9kTejB0uaa	Oh it's just GOT to be inbreeding .....  SO NOT!!   *sigh *<br>  <br>  Greyhounds are one breed that basically is healthy in terms of inheritable problems.  This blindness (what is actually wrong with this puppy? does he have absolutely no sight? can it be corrected?) is quite possibly something that was acquired at some stage of his development, or perhaps he had an accident?<br>  <br>  I'm actually amazed that this breeder rehomed him - although good for you if you were willing to take on  this challenging puppy.|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	Inbreeding probably. It's the main reason why I've always had mongrels (as you can almost guarantee that inbreeding hasn't occurred!)<br>  
lDXh0jRVaa	Yes especially if they are pinworms. Usually though you get it from inhaling the eggs. I work at a shelter and I did get worms once for inhaling the eggs since I have to clean out litter boxes (duh!) but if you're really worried keep your dog dewormed, deworm yourself (you can get this over the counter at CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens...whatever) and take care not to get too close to their poop. And start wearing pajamas!|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	The answer is that you can definitely get worms from your dog. It's unlikely that you will get it from his bum unless your face is stuck in there. However, you can get them if he licks your hands or fingers & you then put them in your mouth, or even if he simply licks your face!|`|quynjD7Paa	It depends on what kind of parasite it is, the vet can explain what kinds can get passed to humans.  I would just get everything taken care of and keep up on it so you won't have to worry at all|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Yes.  This is why you should keep your dog free of worms.|`|O2VZL8Praa	if he just ate wormy poop and then kissed your mouth, then yes, you could get worms.  <br>  <br>  Several worms that infect and reinfect dogs can also infect humans, so treatment and eradication of the worms in the environment are important. Remove dog feces from back yards at least weekly, use appropriate vermicides under veterinary supervision, and have the dog's feces checked frequently in persistent cases. Do not mix wormers and do not use any wormer if your dog is currently taking any other medication, including heartworm preventative, without consulting the veterinarian.<br>  <br>  
b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	Unfortunately it means that your dogs kidneys have pretty much shut down & are unable to do their job & remove excess fluid from the body. Unfortunately there is no cure for this (other than a kidney replacement which I'm not sure is possible for a dog). Dialysis may be possible, just like it is in humans but again I doubt it. The worst thing you could possibly do would be to let the dog suffer, dying through kidney failure is like drowning in your own body. Unless the vet has another solution the best thing you could do for your dog now is to simply let her go peacefully & have her put down.<br>  You need to speak to your dad & tell him what's wrong with the dog, he just as much as anyone should have a say in the decision. But there really is only one choice to make.<br>  <br>  I'm so sorry.|`|iLrp65oXaa	Any time any organ is in "failure" it is serious.  When humans go into renal failure they are given dialysis and sometimes kidney transplants.<br>  <br>  You need to get more information from your vet.  Is this an acute episode?  Does he think that it is reversible?  Does he know what is causing it?  What are the treatment options, if any?  <br>  <br>  After you get that information they you should call your father.  If your vet is not being helpful you should call another vet.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	oh you poor thing what a thing to have to deal with i would call your dad and tell him the  dog is ill and see what he says and explain the situation re the renal failure did the vet say how long she had  to live as if it was me i would want to know good luck with telling your dog and change the vet he sounds horrible |`|7e22a1b7de650843d2dd580cc4ddb41aaa	 that's sad i would just tell him the truth i would have thought that the vet would have said to put the dog down to spare him suffering  you need to tell him the truth . i know its painful but its the best way , and what is best for the dog should be his decision|`|AA11097657	I have had 2 dogs with renal failure and it depends how far gone it is before you decide to have them sadly put to sleep.They can survive months.<br>  In he mean time they need a special diet that the vet will provide.<br>  <br>  When they stop eating and the weight drops off then it is time. If Candy is still eating ok then there is no reason why you can't wait until your dad comes home.<br>  You can explain that her Kidneys are failing and it is only a matter of time before her quality of life will deteriorate.<br>  He can then make a decision about what he wants to do.<br>  |`|kCSJyM8Laa	Renal failure is kidney failure.  Hell with your dad. Do the right thing for the dog and have her put down humanely and shorten her suffering.<br>  <br>  A vet can not tell you what to do.  He/she can only give you facts and you decide.  I'd have the dog put down 
b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	It's probably a good thing, especially after you've seen him clean his bum!|`|YoZZDqq9aa	Correct. Some don't lick.|`|hT5xfEvQaa	you should be happy he does not lick, most people spend alot of money to stop dogs from doing so. you do know where their tongues have been and it is not nice, my dog thankfully is not a licker either.|`|EL5KhR6Baa	My dog is the same hugs but no kisses, she's 2. Anyway I suppose it's more hygenic to have a dog that doesn't lick you. She never does even when she's happy to see me. Best advice: Don't take it personally!! |`|yoaWcfGvaa	It could be that he isn't a licker (some dogs lick more than others) and it could be that you don't taste good.  Dogs often like the taste of lotion their owners wear.|`|vqVd29dWaa	hes gay<br>  |`|5V4sjPElaa	they're just like humans, they each hav different personalities (or dogalities if you wanna get technical) and some are just more affectionate than others. |`|PgAHwHnYaa	yeah some don't lick when told, and others do whenever,<br>  <br>  give it some time, maybe teach him "kisses"<br>  <br>  good luck|`|xovQppUFaa	First you have to be Engaged
AA12083992	Table scrap dogs are not healthy dogs. My advice is stop feeding him anything except his dog food. Nothing else, no table scraps, no hot dogs, no treats.

Table scraps are not.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	First, have him examined by the vet to rule out a medical issue.<br>  <br>  Then just pick a good quality food, and that's all he gets.<br>  <br>  When he gets hungry, he will eat it.<br>  <br>  You've taught him NOT to eat, by rewarding him with "better" food if he refuses.|`|RvddYKqjaa	Once you feed them people food, they are not happy with dog food. Who blames them?  |`|8IfePMa3aa	The raw or BARF diet could be a great option. He'll probably like it because it's meat, and you'll like it because it's healthy. It does take more time and commitment than kibble, but in my experience it really is the better option; my animals seem a lot better off than with the kibble, and my vet hands down agrees.|`|YoZZDqq9aa	Assuming your dog doesn't need to see a vet for anything, my response would be that you need to choose one type, one brand, of dog food and NOTHING else. If you are going to spoil your dog with human food, then you should expect your dog to act spoiled about his food.|`|5I01tsgYaa	Try making him work for it.  My girl was a really picky eater for a long time.  She would only eat mixed or canned and we had to change up the flavor every few days.  She also wouldn't drink water unless it was free-flowing.  What worked for me was making her work for it.  We would take a walk and then play ball for about an hour every day.  This worked immediately with the water issue, but still took a few days for the food.  I made her do tricks and would give her regular dog food as a reward.  Then I worked up the amount of food she got per trick.  After about a week, she started eating a full bowl for one trick.  Now she gobbles her food like she's starving to death.  It took time and patience, but it worked.  And we are both happier for it.|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	It's no wonder he doesn't eat his food if you and your parents keep feeding him table scraps. I mean what would you rather eat? Cheap food out of a tin, or human food?<br>  <br>  A healthy dog will not starve, so if you give him dog food & nothing else (no table scraps, no treats etc) he will learn that his food is in his bowl & he will either like it or lump it. Believe me, he will turn back to his dog food in a day or two. You will have to stick to it though, only give him treats after he has eaten his meal & NO HUMAN FOOD! It sounds cruel but it is the only way to teach him & it works! You should also vary the flavour of dog food that he gets for his meal as this will encourage him to return to his bowl too!|`|AA10920648	My My you've got a picky doggie.  He likes cat food so that can be a treat and help him maintain a good weight.  Table scraps are not a bad idea will he eat eggs, raw or cooked.  Some canines do enjoy raw eggs.

Good thing about this one is that my cats devour it as do my dogs.|`|pFuXUR89aa	Please check with your vet to be sure.<br>  <br>  We feed our dogs Science diet or Newman's own organic food and add canned tuna or other cooked fish at times.

I am concerned that he is not eating and losing weight...always check with your vet.<br>  Hope Brownie starts eating!|`|ggWzQkqzaa	give him a raw chicken wing and see what he does - bet u heel like it, no wonder hes not eating sum crap dog food - how would u like to eat a 'processed human food meal'  for the rest of ur life!? dogs are carnivores n need to eat as close as u cin get to a whole animal carcass|`|4z1gryIGaa	It's not him, Its u. You have to change and not just u anyone who feeds him. Everyone needs to be on the same page. No more human food start a regular feeding schedule whichever u prefer canned or dry..I prefer dry helps to keep their teeth clean. But anyway at his feeding time put his bowl down give him awhile if he doesn't eat it take his food up and wait until his next feeding time. Don't worry he won't starve to death. When he gets hungry enough he will eat it. |`|Gem96NQyaa	The reason he's not eating his dog food is likely because you've trained him not to.  If he knows you'll give him something better is he doesn't eat his dog food, why should he eat it?<br>  <br>  You might try warming his food before you give it to him.  It gives it a more appealing aroma.  Above all, stop feeding him other foods.  If he keeps getting away with it, he'll never stop.  It he still refuses to eat even when he's obviously hungry, take him to the vet.|`|jNN2mRTnaa	Take him to the vet along with a stool sample. Once any medical issue is rulled out, then go to the pet store and pick a good diet. I know you hate to pay for the more expensive food, but in the end you feed less and there is less poop. I think its natural choice that if your dog refuses to eat it, you get your money back? Try a pet supplies plus, or a petco? And dont give in, if he's hungry enough he will eat, you have just spoiled him with scraps. You cold try putting a spoonfull of plain yogurt and mixing it in. My dog loves it and it is good for their digestive tract. Canned food is high in sodium, and will make their teeth go bad quickly also.|`|zZZnQuQJaa	He's not eating dog food anymore because he knows he'll get something better if he holds out!<br>  <br>  Put dry dog food down and leave it down for 20 minutes.  If he doesn't eat it, pick up the bowl.  DO NOT GIVE HIM ANYTHING ELSE, no treats, nothing.  At his next scheduled feeding time, put the dry food back down and again, if he doesn't eat it in 20 minutes, pick it up.  Keep repeating until he eats it.<br>  <br>  A healthy adult dog will not starve itself if food is available to it.  Once he figures out that he won't get anything else if he holds out, he'll eat what you put in front of him.

If there is no safe way to move it without hurting the eggs, then maybe change your menu, if you can, or use a friend's grill, which also may not be desirable, but you'd probably have a bad conscience if you hurt the eggs. :(|`|gS02mbsvaa	i know what your saying, i love to cook but im animal person too. don't move the nest. if you move the nest any were the mother wont go back to it.  maybe...if you really need to bbq...maybe a few weeks after they have hatched you can move them right outside the bbq in a box or something and see if the mother gets to it, but that would be very risky. im sorry, but if i were you i wouldn't touch the nest at all, the only time you could of ever touched it was before the mother layed eggs, but i guess its too late.<br>  for your bbq, just use an open flame on the stove top, that's what i do sometimes<br>  good luck!!!|`|20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	You have a choice---- move the nest, destroy the nest  Or get another BBQ. The choice is yours. I would get a BBQ cover & cover the pit as soon as it is cool enough after cooking so the bird can't get in. If the eggs are just laid they arent developing yet .|`|fQgbBx7caa	Why don't you just go out and buy another cheap aluminum bbq just to get you buy until momma birds nursery flies away?  I would not have the heart to move it either, she will abandon the babies.
9e69114f630fc3a4f016dd297b420d47aa	Test for ammonia. That sounds a lot like ammonia toxicity.<br>  <br>  The biggest source of ammonia in your tank is probably uneaten fish food. Most likely, your tank is too big.<br>  <br>  What ... is it possible for a fish tank to be too big? Yes, when it comes to a fry tank, it is. Think about it: you have these little tiny guppy fry and this great big world they're living in. Fish food naturally spreads out on the surface due to its oil content, and then sinks all over the tank, wherever the fry aren't. So, the guppy fry miss a lot of it, and it sinks to the bottom and decays. The cory, who is really looking for some nice tasty algae wafers, can't get it all. That's where a lot of your ammonia is coming from.<br>  <br>  I've got guppy fry in tanks of every size from a half-gallon decorative tank meant for (but too cramped for!) bettas to 2.5 gallons. The latter is what I recommend.<br>  <br>  Your fry tank should have the following: one sponge filter (I recommend the Oxygen Plus Bio-Filter 11, available from Fosters & Smith if you can't find it locally), one small clump of Java moss spread out a lot, an air supply to the filter (a Whisper 10 air pump can power three of them), the guppy fry, and nothing else. No gravel, no decorations, no cory, no nothing.<br>  <br>  You should also have a very small siphon (I use a piece of airline tubing) to clean up detritus on the bottom without accidentally sucking up guppies, for when you're doing your water changes.<br>  <br>  I use Artificial Artemia and First Bites for the smallest and newest fry, but within a few days I move to Hikari Fancy Guppy Food, which comes in very small granules (crush it between your fingers if they're having trouble). I feed them at least twice daily, 4x when possible, in small amounts. Remember the rule: as much as they can eat in 5 minutes. They will also nibble around the Java moss, eating the microorganisms that make a home on its stems. If you want to get fancy, you can hatch out baby brine shrimp for them. I keep my fry at room temperature, but one of those little 7.5 watt heaters (the little flat ones) would be a better idea.<br>  <br>  Test your water. Test for ammonia, test for nitrites, test for nitrates. You NEED to know. Use Cycle (or any other bottled bacteria that you prefer) according to the directions on the bottle: a double dose to get started, and a weekly dose to maintain the populations in the face of competition from less beneficial varieties.<br>  <br>  Also, if you're using tap water, find out how your water supply is treated. If it has chloramine instead of just chlorine, you will need to use a water conditioner that specifically says it removes chloramine. Even a small amount remaining can build up and become toxic to the fish. My city water is so bad I just use bottled water for the fry; better safe than sorry, and the expense is minor compared to the chance of losing a whole brood of fry.|`|a32ed1608ae3fd2e1f7b6f62eb25fe7daa	Try to not change the water as often. Do you have a purifier, or what ever they are called in the tank to keep the water fresh?

Raw apples are good for constipation. In herbal medicine ripe, uncooked apples have traditionally been given to treat constipation. At least two apples should be taken daily for proper evacuation of bowels. Baked apples (which is what I suggested)are good for diarrhoea as the cooking process softens the cellulose and provides bulk to the faeces.Not forgetting apples are a great colon cleanser and will reduce the effects of infection which is often accompanied with stomach disorders.<br>  <br>  Anaemia<br>  Apples, being rich in Iron, Vitamin C and Phosphorus, are highly beneficial in the treatment of anemia. It will be particularly useful in the form of freshly prepared apple juice. It may be taken in quantities of 0.5 to 1 kg daily with beneficial results. The best time to take the juice is half an hour before meals and just before retiring to bed. The cider should be drawn from selected apples, which should be thoroughly washed before crushing.<br>  <br>  Dysentery<br>  Apples have been found useful in acute and chronic dysentery among children. Ripe and sweet apples should be crushed into pulp and given to the child several times a day, from one to four tablespoon full, according to age, in this disorder. The American Medical Association has also advocated the use of apples as therapeutic agent in dysentery.<br>  <br>  Stomach Disorders <br>  Slicing a whole apple and gently pounding it until it becomes slightly mashed prepare a natural ‘apple medicine’ for the disturbed stomach. It may be sprinkled with cinnamon or honey The entire mashed apple may be eaten except for the stem and seeds. It should be chewed thoroughly before swallowing. This preparation should be taken several times between meals for beneficial results. The all-natural medicinal substance, pectin, in the mashed apple works to create a protective coating action by virtue of its qualities as an absorbent and demulcent i.e. the soothing agent.<br>  <br>  Shredded apple, mixed with a tablespoonful of honey and sprinkled with sesame seeds, constitute an excellent stomach tonic and an appetizer. It should be taken before meals. It stimulates sluggish digestive juices and this facilitates assimilation of food for healthful results.'<br>  <br>  Headache<br>  Apples are highly beneficial in the treatment of all types of headache. A ripe apple, after removing the upper rind and the inner hard portion should be taken with a little salt every morning on empty stomach in such cases. This should be continued for about a week. It will yield good results even in cases of disgusting chronic headache. <br>  <br>   <br>  Colitis is an inflammation of the colon or lower bowel and is a complicated condition with many possible causes. The symptoms of colitis can also vary widely depending on the severity of the disease. When mild the symptoms of colitis may just be that the first motion of the day is firm but subsequent motions throughout the day or walk get softer. As the condition progresses you may start to see motions covered with mucus, jelly or slime. In moderate colitis the motions have mucus flecked with blood especially toward the end of the motion. The animal often strains unproductively after the passage of the motion. If the colitis is severe then the animal may pass a red to brown diarrhoea which will result in rapid dehydration and collapse. This may also be accompanied by vomiting. This is a life threatening situation and needs urgent attention.<br>  <br>  Causes  <br>  <br>  The most common causes of colitis are dietry indiscretion usually involving dairy products, and rich food sauces, fat or liver. A common cause of colitis in nervous animals is stress, this is often seen when such animals are kenneled for their owner's holidays. Less common causes of colitis are dietary intolerance.  Sometimes these dietary intolerances are temporary and sometimes they are permanent. The presentation of undigested food in the colon for whatever reason can result in colitis. In these situations it is important to address the cause of the food being undigested, be it a failure of digestion or a hypermotile bowel. Another uncommon cause of colitis like symptoms in the dog are bacterial overgrowths in the bowel, the most likely is a bacteria called Clostridia. If possible your veterinarian should decide what the most likely cause of colitis is in your dog before treating. The initial treatment for colitis is similar to that for vomiting and diarrhoea ie. starvation, water only then bland diets followed by a slow re-introduction of the normal diet. However if the symptoms return then you should repeat the process but re-consider a different normal diet. Diets which tend to protect against colitis fall into two types. <br>  Hypoallergenic diets ie. diets with unusual protein and carbohydrate sources that your dog is unlikely to be sensitive to. These diets do not contain the allergens to which dogs are most likely to be sensitive. In the case of dogs these are beef, dairy products and wheat. These diets are usually highly digestible. eg. Hills Canine d/d <br>  High fibre/low fat diets that result in an environment in the colon that encourages the growth of "friendly" bacteria. eg. Hills Canine w/d <br>  The choice of the diet depends on the individual. Occasionally dietary management alone is not enough to control the colitis and additional treatments may be necessary. Complimentary treatments include bowel regulators like Ispaghula Husk, homoeopathic remedies like Rhus Tox  nutriceuticals like Glycosamine, and Aloe Vera Conventional treatments include systemic and bowel active steroids and antibiotics.<br>  <br>  Remember to worm your dog at least twice yearly.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  To properly diagnose a food allergy, your veterinarian may recommend a change in your pet's diet to a novel food source of a protein and a carbohydrate that has never been previously eaten. Examples could be Duck & Potato, Venison and Pea, or Rabbit and Sweet Potato. The elimination diet needs to be conducted for at least 12 weeks as it may take that long for some pet to show signs of improvement. During this period, no table scraps, treats or chewable supplements can be given! Many owners switch to a lamb or rice diet with the belief that these are better for their pet's health and will also help to rule out food allergy. At one time, these diets were novel ingredients recommended by veterinary dermatologists for hypoallergenic trials, but due to their popularity the past decade, they are not useful for hypoallergenic food trials. Many lamb and rice diets contain a number of other ingredients that may cause food allergies, such as poultry and corn, as well as dyes and chemicals. Signs of food allergies should abate if your dog and cat is indeed food allergic.<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Recommended Pet Foods<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  IVD Limited Ingredient Diets<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Canine: Potato & Duck, Potatoes & Whitefish<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Feline: Rabbit Formula, Venison formula, Duck Formula<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Canine: Potato & Duck Formula, Sweet Potato & Fish Formula, Venison & Brown Rice Formula<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Feline: Venison & Green Pea Formula|`|5a3fe266cf6ca1246ffbbc6dbfee9cc3aa	Just as in people,  dogs know when something makes them sick.  It is not unusual if you have a sensitive dog for the dog to quit eating for a time if offered the same food.  Try putting a table spoon or two of plain yogurt on his food once a day for a few days.  This will help prevent further problems.  Also read the label of the food you are currently using,  you might need to change to a food with a higher meat content.

2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	Poodles really aren't hypoallergenic(nor is any breed of dog), Poodles do shed though minimally and they do produce dander. Dander is what causes allergic reactions not hair...all dogs have skin so therefore all dogs have dander.<br>  <br>  Now for your question  for some people  the amount of dander produced by Poodles doesn't cause allergic reactions... my guess would be because Poodles unlike most dogs are regualrly groomed because of the nature of their hair.|`|AA10987972	there coat is like wool on a lam not hair|`|8aaefbfd46388a1e36e523453aec57a3aa	On a much wiser note, hypo-allerginic which means less, not none.  These dogs in fact, do exist. Among these are poodles, which are dogs whose coat continues to grow, like human hair, rather than shedding regularly, thus shedding less dander and hair.  Below is a list of hypoallergenic dogs. If you are looking for a hypoallergenic dog for your family any of these dogs may be a good match.  Remember, no dog is 100% hypoallergenic, but people with allergies frequently react to supposedly hypoallergenic breeds differently and can even react to individual dogs differently. If your allergic family member has a reaction to a particular breed of dog that family member may be fine with dogs of another breed that is considered to be hypoallergenic. <br>  <br>  The following is a list of dogs considered to be hypoallergenic:<br>  <br>  American Hairless Terrier <br>  Airedale Terrier<br>  Basenji<br>  Bedlington Terrier<br>  Bichon Frise<br>  Border Terrier<br>  Cairn Terrier<br>  Chinese Crested (hairless)<br>  Havanese<br>  Kerry Blue Terrier<br>  Maltese<br>  Miniature Schnauzer<br>  Portuguese Water Dog<br>  Puli <br>  Shih-Tzu<br>  Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier<br>  Spanish Water Dog<br>  Standard Poodle<br>  Standard Schnauzer<br>  Tibetan Terrier<br>  Toy Poodle<br>  West Highland White Terrier<br>  Wirehaired Fox Terrier<br>  Yorkshire Terrier<br>  <br>  What coat-type makes the difference?<br>  There are two coat types that produce a lesser amount of allergens: single-coated dogs, who do not have a thick undercoat, and hairless dogs. However even hairless dogs (ewww gross) can produce enough dander to to affect a highly allergic person.<br>  <br>  Hair-less Dog Breeds:<br>  Xoloitzcuintle (Mexican Hairless) <br>  American Hairless Terrier <br>  Chinese Crested (Hairless) <br>  Peruvian Inca Orchid <br>  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that all dogs may carry small amounts of allergens or can pick up natural allergens in their fur when they go outside. To keep the allergy risk low even among hypoallergenic breeds, you should bath and groom as frequently as your vet or authorities on the breed suggest. (If a hypoallergenic dog's skin gets too dry from too much bathing, it make flake and cause allergic reations) If your family is super sensitive to pet hair you should be careful about having your pet groomed by a groomer with other breeds in the shop. To reduce the amount of loose hair on the dog, specify to your groomer that your dog should be rinsed after being clipped. (Most groomers bathe before clipping in order to not expose their clipper blades to marmful skin oils) Many groomers also spray a dog with a perfume after bathing which many asthmatics and allergy sufferers are allergic to. If this could be a concern for you ask your groomer in advance not to use any perfumes or colognes on your dog.<br>  <br>  Heres my story:<br>  My husband has bad pet dander allergies, and this is one of the reasons he hates cats so much, but dogs on the other hand, some have been ok with his nose.  I wanted a dog for companionship and protection.  With the craze of hypo-allergenic dogs started a few years ago at the time I was researching for a dog, I checked out the list, but all the dogs on it were to "foo-foo" for us, and required quite a bit of grooming every month.  I missed having a dog so bad, but wanted to (and had to) find one that agreed with his snozzle.  After shoving the hypo-allergenic dog list to the side and just about giving up, I decided to checkout short coated breeds next.  May not be officially hypo-allergenic but I did have only a little hair to deal with.  I wanted something med.-large sized and short coated and wasn't a "yappy" dog.  So I looked at The Gun Dogs, Hounds, and the Non-sporting respectfully.  And I fell in love with Rhodesian Ridgebacks.  They only bark if there is a reason to.  They don't have much hair, and only require a weekly brushing and bath once a month or a week if needed.  They are generally laid back in the home which was a big plus for us.  And they don't eat much despite their large size.  We lived in an apartment at the time, and they were just too big for it.  We decided we just couldn't have a dog yet because of financial reasons, and pet deposits are outrageous these days... then one day I saw her.  One dog at my local Petco that was in a rescue group.  Short coat, red (my husband loves red dogs) livernosed, beautiful yellow\amber eyes, and only weighed about 45 lbs.  She was called a Vizsla Mix.  We did get her and foster her for two weeks, and of course got attached.  We moved into a house shortly after fostering, and  we had her for about 3 years.  But sadly she went to another family members home last year.  I really originally had wanted a Rhodesian.  So we had thought about getting her a friend, and I researched the net, contacted breeders, we went to their homes, went to dog shows, I read books, watched tv shows on them, and printed out info from the net, and presented them to my husband frequently.  The more stuff I came up with, the more fascinated he became with the breed also.  We eventually found a Female livernose and our dogs then matched like sisters!  Well, as the Rhodesian got older, the two dogs fought alot.  The Vizsla Mix was very dominant, and also food, bone and toy posessive.  And the Vizsla Mix got to the point where she was actually biting my Rhodesian, and drawing blood.  And even turning on her when we were all in the room.  I had enough, and thats when sadly she went with family to another home.  Shes very happy now that she gets to be the only dog.  She a little brat I think, lol!  We also recently got a Male Rhodesian puppy.  My husband says these are they best dogs he has ever owned, and never ever sneezed around them.  I think they should be added to the list.  Better yet, I think big dogs should have their own catergory, which gives people another option besides the little dogs which need more grooming.  Of course, its bets to do as much research as you can, and find a dog that fits your lifestyle the best.  I know I did and hope you will too.  I hope I wasn't boring you with my story...and I hope this info answers any questions you had.|`|K5kPAMsCaa	They AREN'T!!!!<br>  <br>  That's just a LIE,spread by CROOKED pup-millers & believed by the ignorant/GULLIBLE!<br>  <br>  NO dog is "hypo-allergenic", mutt/mongrel OR pure bred.<br>  <br>  ALL DOGS SHED!!!|`|e8df5d066bf0a559c7effd890d98c04baa	Actually thats bull.

Pero si la deshidratacion puede estar causado por los vomitos, y producirle decaimiento! Es posible que los vomitos tengan que ver con el higado, con algo que comio y le cayo mal  o con parasitos. Para evitar que se deshidrate dale agua de a poco, para evitar que la vomite, y, de ser posible, con unos granitos de sal, y una cucharadita de azucar, para que no le resulte desagradable tomarlo. En el vomito se pierden gran cantidad de sales, por eso es necesario "devolverselas" en el agua. El tema es que beba de a poco, pero a cada ratito, cada media hora, por ejemplo. Y ma?ana al veterinario! Suerte!|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Suero, dale suero pediátrico. Eso permitirá hidratarla!

xo3wjLPraa	Espero esto te sirva.<br>  Los corales verdaderos segregan carbonato de calcio por la parte inferior del cuerpo de cada individuo o pólipo y forman unos cuencos esqueléticos a los que se anclan los pólipos, retrayéndose a su interior cuando hay peligro. En el disco oral aplanado de la parte superior del cuerpo se encuentra un orificio, bordeado de tentáculos plumosos y cilios filiformes, que hace las veces de boca y ano. Durante la noche, el animal extiende los tentáculos, atrapa plancton animal arrastrado hacia él por el agua, y se lleva el alimento a la boca. Las células urticantes o nematocistos de los tentáculos pueden también paralizar a la presa.<br>  Microsoft ? Encarta ? 2007. ? 1993-2006 Microsoft Corporation.

En el mismo se encuentra una serie de islas deshabitadas que llevan el nombre de Islas del mar del Coral, entre las que se encuentran los islotes de Willis, Coringa y Tregosse. El mar del Coral toma el nombre de su rasgo más característico, la Gran Barrera de Arrecifes, que es el mayor arrecife coralino del mundo.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar_del_Coral" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar_del_Cor...</a><br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  En el Caribe se encuentra un 9% de los arrecifes de coral del planeta cubriendo cerca de 20.000 millas cuadras, muchas de ellas localizadas fuera de las Islas del Caribe y la costa de Centroamérica. Entre ellos se destaca la Barrera del Arrecife de Belice, con una superficie de 96.300 ha, la cual fue declarada patrimonio de la humanidad en 1996, hace parte del Gran Arrecife Maya (también conocido como Sistema Arrecifal Mesoamericano), que con más de mil kilómetros de extensión es el segundo más grande del mundo,cubriendo las costas en el Caribe de México, Belice, Guatemala y Honduras. Actualmente las corrientes de agua caliente están poniendo en peligro los arrecifes de coral del Caribe. Los arrecifes de coral mantienen algunos de los más diversos hábitats en el mundo, pero son ecosistemas muy frágiles. Cuando las aguas tropicales superan los 85oF en un largo período de tiempo, las zooxantelas mueren. Estas plantas proveen de alimento a los corales y le dan su color. El blanqueamiento resultante en los arrecifes de coral los mata y da?a el ecosistema. Más de un 42% de las colonias de corales se han blanqueado completamente, mientras que un 95% están experimentando algún tipo de blanqueamiento.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar_Caribe" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar_Caribe</a><br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Saludos.

SDHvDNGJaa	Compra Ensure para bebés, cualquier sabor, excepto chocolate. Es importante que no le des de chocolate, pues el chocolate da?a el hígado de los perros. Si no encuentras Ensure, compra cualquier suplemento alimenticio líquido equivalente, pero para bebés. Compra jeringas de plástico de 3 ml. Si la medicina es una pastilla, macérala cuidadosamente hasta obtener un polvo fino. Luego mézclala con el Ensure (uno o dos mililitros). Si no es pastilla y es líquida, mézlcala igual con uno o dos mililitros de Ensure. Luego abre el hocico de tu cachorro y dale el Ensure con la medicina. De preferencia ponlo lo mas profundo que se pueda y cierra su hociquito para que no lo rejurgite. Puedes darle Ensure durante todo el día. Todo el que acepte. Verás como poco a poco tu cachorrito se va recuperando. Pero hay que dárselo muchas veces al día en poca cantidad.

de80830fc285f1be6d071e2cc102cbd3aa	Prevention is the best way. Take her where you want her to potty every time she wakes up after she eats after she drinks alot! I take my pup out every half hour and praise him alot when he goes. It can easily take 6 months for a pup to finally get it though some catch on quick. Limit food and water about 3 hours before you go to bed to help her to make it through the night. If you see her squat on the floor make a loud noise to startle her. Like scream HAY then bring her to the desired spot fast and when she finishes there praise her and maybe give her a treat. you want to avoid as many accidents as possible. My vet told me to keep the puppy on a leash in the house attached to me if I am doing something like dishes when you can't follow him around or put him in the crate. you can limit poops by feeding on a schedule sense they always poo shortly after they eat. If they have food all the time then as they nibble they are always ingesting and outputting with means you have to watch him more. Don't spank them or shove their nose in it after they have done it they will learn to hide it. If you don't catch the puppy in the act and there is poo on the floor just clean it up and hope to catch her or prevent it next time. You can't discipline them after the fact at all cause they just won't understand and you don't want her to become afraid of you.|`|tPmvKB8oaa	A general rule when potty training a pup (and this will require a lot of trips in and out of the house for you); when they wake up, take them to a designated spot that you want them to go potty in, then after they eat or drink.  It takes time, but can be done.  <br>  <br>  My husband and I have 3 dogs and we have a very large back yard that is fenced in but, they are not allowed to potty in the yard.  We have a fenced in kennel and that is where they were taught to go.  There is nothing worse then walking into your own back yard and stepping in a mess.  <br>  <br>  You might want to get some type of a portable fence and put that in a designated area to put your little pup in when it is time to go potty.  They will eventually get the idea to go.  And above all, when the puppy does his/her job, give it lots of praises.  Nothing pleases them more than to please their owner.  And remember too, be patient with your little one.  Every pup is different and some take longer than others to train.  And try to keep some type of schedule with your little baby, because that is what they are...a baby.<br>  <br>  This is just one of many sites where you can buy portable pens that can be used indoors and outdoors and they come in different heights, depending on the size of your little one.  We have one and I love it.  It can fold up easily and store away when not in use.

fFocO5vvaa	I have just read your question and follow up. I am so sorry to hear about your little one. The vet cannot do anything to help? I am very happy to hear that it was nothing fatal. When I read your original question my advice was, as the others to take him to the ER vet. They are not always easy to find and not cheap but you sound like a concerned owner and it sounded as though you were planning on doing just that. You did great. Since there was really no question left for me to answer I wanted to at least pull up some info on the disorder and pass it on in hopes that it might help.<br>  THE HEARTBREAK OF HOD<br>  by Bobbie Kelley<br>  Khan, a 4-month old Kuvasz puppy from our first litter (1985), had been in his new home for one month. I received a call from the concerned and anxious owner. The puppy, lethargic for a couple of days, now wouldn't rise, exhibiting excruciating pain all over. His hind legs had no strength. There was high fever, lack of appetite, and diarrhea. The veterinarian, uncertain of the diagnosis at first, treated Khan symptomatically for fever and pain, and prescribed a precautionary antibiotic. A radiographic and blood work-up was ordered. Over the next several months, the clinical signs would subside and flare up again episodically, showing a recurring pattern. Each relapse was often more severe than the last. The initial symptoms were so generic that proper diagnosis was difficult. Within several weeks of the onset of symptoms, however, diagnosis was simplified by the physical changes that occurred. Enlargement of the ends of the long bones (appearing as swollen joints), weakened pasterns, splayed feet, and stunting of the long bone growth were seen. The associated pain kept the pup relatively inactive, and when movement was required, his gait was restricted and mincing. Radiographs taken at this stage confirmed the problem: HYPERTROPHIC OSTEODYSTROPHY (H.O.D.) (1).<br>  HYPERTROPHIC OSTEODYSTROPHY IS A HEARTBREAKER<br>  Perhaps no other juvenile orthopedic disorder in dogs causes such intense pain. There is no known cure; one can only attempt to ease the suffering with anti-inflammatory medications and analgesics. Some puppies show gradual improvement over the course of several months and eventually recover fully, although some permanent stunting or bowing of the long bones may occur. Others get progressively worse and either succumb or are euthanized. Other than providing supportive care, the owner is relatively helpless, as the outcome of the disease seems independent of the treatment (2,3,4,5). Time drags as the owner waits, day by day, to see if the puppy will improve or worsen. Hopes soar as the pup seems to feel better, only to plummet at the next relapse. Khan's suffering ended at six months of age, when prolonged anorexia, dehydration, and fever caused by the HOD claimed his life. As breeders, our nightmare was far from over. By then, in Khan's litter of eleven puppies, two other confirmed (and one other suspected) cases of H.O.D had been diagnosed.<br>  THE CAUSE OF H.O.D. REMAINS UNKNOWN<br>  The cause of H.O.D. remains unknown (2,6,7). Hindered by a lack of research dollars available to study such a rare disease, veterinary researchers are unable to agree on the cause of H.O.D. A review of the scientific literature since the 1930's reveals that the cause of H.O.D. may be one or perhaps a combination of the following: genetics, nutrition, infection, trauma, autoimmune disease, hormone imbalance, or reaction to vaccination (1,2,5,6,8). Among affected puppies, there is little that can be pointed to as a common denominator.<br>  Genetics Seen only occasionally in the canine population, some breeds are more commonly afflicted with H.O.D., namely Great Danes, Boxers, Irish Setters, Weimaraners, and several other large, fast-growing breeds (1,4,5,6). The disease is sporadic, usually affecting only isolated puppies in a particular litter or line. However, there are reports of family clusters, entire litters, or significant numbers of littermates being affected (1,3). Some breeders have experienced consistently high percentages of pups with H.O.D. in related litters, suggesting genetic influences. This was the case in our own breeding program. Khan's dam produced two litters before she was spayed; 3 of 11 pups (27%) from the first litter and 3 of 8 (38%) in the second litter had H.O.D. An unaffected litter-sister to Khan was bred once, and 3 of 9 (33%) had HOD. By contrast, three unrelated bitches of ours have produced 26 puppies, none affected, raised with similar nutrition and management. These observations are suggestive of recessive genetic mechanisms. Yet when researchers twice bred two littermate Great Danes that had H.O.D. in puppyhood, two normal, unaffected litters were produced (8). Other breeders produce only one or two isolated cases from years of repeat breedings and/or line breedings of closely related individuals. These data raise questions about the genetic mode or transmission. It is unknown whether complicated genetic mechanisms result in a predisposition to the development of H.O.D. in certain individuals (1,2,5).<br>  Nutrition H.O.D. has occurred in puppies oversupplemented with vitamins, minerals (calcium), protein, and calories. It is well documented that overfeeding highly palatable diets free-choice promotes bone growth abnormalities (1,2,6). But experimental oversupplementation has not been shown to consistently reproduce H.O.D. in test puppies (1). Litters of puppies all fed and supplemented in the same way may have only one or two of the pups affected with H.O.D. Overnutrition may be an exacerbating factor but is probably not a direct cause, as pups in all nutritional states have been affected (1,2). Vitamin C deficiency has also been postulated to cause H.O.D.; the radiographic appearance of HOD in dogs is similar to human scurvy. But the studies are controversial and inconclusive at best, and there is no substantiated evidence to support Vitamin C deficiency as a cause of H.O.D. (1,6,7,9). Dogs synthesize their own Vitamin C; however, it has been suggested that certain breeds of dogs may be predisposed to faulty Vitamin C metabolism. Since puppies with H.O.D. rarely improve with dietary correction or Vitamin C therapy, the association between nutrition and H.O.D. is inconsistent (1,2,4,7).<br>  Infected puppies with H.O.D. commonly have high fever, diarrhea, and sometimes upper respiratory signs. There is suppurative inflammation within the metaphyses of the long bones, and often an elevated white blood cell count (1,7,8). The systemic clinical signs and the bilaterally symmetric inflammatory response seen histologically has led some investigators to look for an infectious agent as the culprit (1,5). To date, no causative organism has been found in H.O.D.- afflicted dogs, and attempts to transmit the disease from affected to unaffected dogs have been unsuccessful (1,5). Yet, some human diseases act in the same way; congenital syphilis in humans looks very similar radiographically to H.O.D. in puppies, and the causative microorganism in syphilis disappears from tissue very early in the course of the infection (1). More studies of infectious agents as a cause of H.O.D. are warranted.<br>  Various other theories on the cause of H.O.D. have been suggested, and these include trauma (overuse, overexercise), autoimmune disease, calciotropic hormone imbalance, and reaction to vaccination (1,5,8). We have noticed in our own experience (in all but one case) that the initial onset of symptoms occurred within 48 hours of the pup's final distemper vaccination. Whether this is a correlation, or simply coincidental with the typical age of onset of HOD (4 months of age), remains unknown.<br>  TALLY OF AFFECTED KUVASZOK IS HIGH<br>  Although as yet not considered by breeders to be a predominant disease in Kuvaszok, the tally of owners and breeders who have experienced the problem is surprisingly high. When one looks at the number of Kuvaszok affected relative to the Kuvasz population, and compares this with the occurrence of H.O.D. in the general dog population, there appears to be a disproportionately high occurrence in our breed. Regardless of the specific cause of HOD, there may be an underlying genetic predisposition for an animal to demonstrate the disease, thus explaining why some breed lines display the disease more often than others. Because of this possible heritability, until the cause of H.O.D. is verified, it would be prudent to cull affected lines from breeding, so that H.O.D does not become any more prevalent in the breed than it is already.<br>  BREEDERS MUST SHARE INFORMATION<br>  There has been an unfortunate tendency among breeders to minimize the problems encountered in their breeding programs, and to be reluctant to discuss them objectively. But when puppies are dying after a long-suffering illness, it is time to bury our egos. This is not simply a mild juvenile orthopedic problem which the dog, or surgery, can compensate for as in the case of the more commonly observed hip dysplasia (H.D.) and osteochondrosis (O.C.D.). While H.D. and O.C.D. are certainly problems of concern in our breed, they are normally not life-threatening. Though H.O.D is usually referred to as self- limiting and rarely terminal, five of the nine H.O.D-affected puppies we have produced (56%) have died from H.O.D or its complications. Breeder apathy will not only impede research efforts at understanding H.O.D, but because of the limited gene pool among Kuvaszok, could result in the proliferation of affected and carrier animals.<br>  In 1978, Dr. R. P. Wright, a veterinarian and breeder of Irish Setters, attempted to collect information from setter breeders and owners through their breed newsletter. Similarly, I attempted to compile information following the 1992 publication of an earlier version of this article in several Kuvasz newsletters. A team of veterinary researchers at the University of Florida was ready to assist me with this effort, and a private foundation had committed $30,000. We sought to compile information and conduct studies of affected puppies, with the goal of determining the cause, and thereby perhaps developing a treatment for H.O.D. Despite heart-wrenching stories of gorgeous puppies of distinguished breeding being crippled or dying from H.O.D., breeder and veterinary cooperation was minimal (5). I was unable to maintain the interest of the University or the private foundation with the paucity of data collected. Despite our disappointing progress in understanding H.O.D., I maintain a personal file on H.O.D., and I invite any of you with firsthand knowledge of H.O.D. to send me your case histories and pedigrees. Maybe someday they will prove useful.<br>  <a href="http://www.kuvasz.info/kuvaszhod.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kuvasz.info/kuvaszhod.htm</a><br>  <br>  For Your Veterinarian<br>  <br>  Understanding the problems and needs of the large/giant breeds can be difficult, and understandably so, if you have not had the experience of dealing with many in your practice. Great Danes in particular are a fragile breed and particularly prone to developmental orthopedic diseases, vaccine and antibiotic reactions as well as immune problems. All to often developmental orthopedic diseases get incorrectly diagnosed.<br>  <br>  In light of this information, I offer you this article to assist you in working with the large/giant breeds. First, I understand as a lay person you are hesitant to put much stock in an article brought to you by your client. On the other hand, let me give you some background to assure you my experience is worth considering. <br>  <br>  My name is Linda Arndt, I am a professor emeritus of a large mid-west university and owner of Blackwatch Great Dane Kennels and Blackwatch Canine Nutritional Consulting LLC. I have been involved in exhibiting, breeding, and training in conformation and obedience for 34 years. My last 20 years of involvement in dogs have been focused on the education of breeders and veterinarians, involving health issues and feeding programs, as it relates to the giant breeds. I work closely with the Great Dane Club of America's and their Health and Welfare Committee, to find solutions to the many problems within our breed. <br>  <br>  In 1989 - 1995 I conducted the National Bone Disease Survey in Great Danes, which supplied data from 5200 cases of veterinarian diagnosed DOD - Developmental Orthopedic Diseases. HOD, OCD and Pano where the primary focus of the survey.<br>  <br>  I gathered information on age, sex, diets - types and amounts, medications, vaccine protocols. Whereby this is not scientific research, it does give us the most extensive data on DOD problems within our breed. This survey also revealed antibiotic sensitivities in this breed, as well as a large number of vaccine reactions, which led to the current vaccine research being funded by the Great Dane Club of America, under the direction of Dr. Harm HoganEsch and Dr. Larry Glickman, at Purdue University. The research is in year 5 of a 7 year study on Vaccine Mediated Responses in Canines. <br>  <br>  I mention this information to you because there is evidence, based on the national survey, that vaccine reactions, allergic reactions to certain antibiotics, and septicemia (generally from cropping), are often misdiagnosed as HOD. These conditions can "mimic" the same symptoms as HOD , making it very difficult to diagnose. <br>  <br>  With that in mind, I offer this article to you for consideration - a check list of "things to consider" when searching for the answers to a potential developmental orthopedic disease.<br>  <br>  It is with the greatest respect that I offer this information. I have worked with many veterinarians and breeders in collective problem solving for the benefit of this breed. <br>  Feel free to contact me at any time that I can be of assistance.<br>  <br>  Linda Arndt<br>  GrDaneLady@aol.com<br>  <a href="http://www.greatdanelady.com/articles/guide_to_recognizing_bone_diseases.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatdanelady.com/articles/gu...</a><br>  <br>  W. Jean Dodds, DVM <br>  Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association <br>  May 1, 2001 <br>  <br>  W. Jean Dodds, DVM Keywords: Canine; Vaccination Protocols for Dogs; Vaccine Reactions <br>  <br>  GUEST Editorial <br>  There is increasing evidence in veterinary medicine that vaccines can trigger immune mediated and other chronic disorders (i. e., vaccinosis), especially in certain apparently predisposed breeds. 16 Accordingly, clinicians need to be aware of this potential and offer alternative approaches for preventing infectious diseases in these animals. Such alternatives to current vaccine practices include: measuring serum antibody titers; avoidance of unnecessary vaccines or over vaccinating; and using caution in vaccinating ill, geriatric, debilitated, or febrile individuals, and animals from breeds or families known to be at increased risk for immunological reactions. 3,58 Fortunately, the most common effect of vaccine administration is the stimulation of an immune response that conveys protection for that disease. This outcome has resulted in the widespread reduction in morbidity and mortality from the many infectious diseases that have plagued both animals and humans. An excellent example of this benefit is the global eradication of smallpox as the result of a comprehensive immunization program. Despite these intended benefits, however, vaccination does carry with it attendant risks.<br>  <br>  Adverse Effects of Vaccines <br>  As the most commonly recognized adverse effect of vaccination is an immediate hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction, practitioners are less familiar with the more rare but equally serious acute or chronic immune mediated syndromes that can occur. The veterinary profession and vaccine industry have traditionally emphasized the importance of giving a series of vaccinations to young animals to prevent infectious diseases, to the extent that this practice is considered routine and is generally safe for the majority of animals. Few clinicians are prepared, therefore, for encountering an adverse event and may overlook or even deny the possibility. <br>  <br>  Beyond the immediate hypersensitivity reactions, other acute events tend to occur 24 to 72 hours afterward, or 7 to 45 days later in a delayed type immunological response. 1,6,9,10 Even more delayed adverse effects include mortality from hightitered measles vaccine in infants, canine distemper antibodies in joint diseases of dogs, and feline injection site <br>  fibrosarcomas. 3,11 The increasing antigenic load presented to the host individual by modified live virus (MLV) vaccines is presumed to be responsible for the immunological challenge that can result in a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. 6,9 The clinical signs associated with nonanaphylactic vaccine reactions typically include fever, stiffness, sore joints and abdominal tenderness, susceptibility to infections, neurological disorders and encephalitis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) resulting in icterus, or immune mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) resulting in petechiae and ecchymotic hemorrhage. 14,9,10,1215 Hepatic enzymes may be markedly elevated, and liver or kidney failure may occur by itself or accompany bone marrow suppression. 3 Furthermore, MLV vaccination has been associated with the development of transient seizures in puppies and adult dogs of breeds or crossbreeds susceptible to immune mediated diseases, especially those involving hematological or endocrine tissues (e. g., AIHA, ITP, autoimmune thyroiditis). 13 Postvaccinal polyneuropathy is a recognized entity associated occasionally with the use of distemper, parvovirus, rabies, and possibly other vaccines. 3,6,9 This can result in various clinical signs, including muscular atrophy, inhibition or interruption of neuronal control of tissue and organ function, incoordination, and weakness. 3 Therefore, we have the responsibility to advise companion animal breeders and caregivers of the potential for genetically susceptible littermates and relatives that are at increased risk for similar adverse vaccine reactions. 15 Commercial vaccines, on rare occasion, can also be contaminated with other adventitious viral agents, 6,16 which can produce significant untoward effects such as occurred when a commercial canine parvovirus vaccine was contaminated by blue tongue virus. It produced abortion and death when given to pregnant dogs 16 and was linked causally to the ill advised but all too common practice of vaccinating pregnant animals. <br>  <br>  The potential for side effects such as promotion of chronic disease states in male and non pregnant female dogs receiving this lot of vaccine remains in question, although there have been anecdotal reports of reduced stamina and renal dysfunction in performance sled dogs. 3 Recently, a vaccine manufacturer had to recall all biological products containing a distemper component, because they were associated with a higher than expected rate of central nervous system postvaccinal reactions 1 to 2 weeks following administration. 3 <br>  <br>  If, as a profession, we conclude that we are over vaccinating, other issues come to bare, such as the needless client dollars spent on vaccines, despite the well intentioned solicitation of clients to encourage annual booster vaccinations so that pets also can receive a wellness examination. 5 Giving annual boosters when they are not necessary has the client paying for a service which is likely to be of little benefit to the pet’s existing level of protection against these infectious diseases. It also increases the risk of adverse reactions from the repeated exposure to foreign substances. <br>  Polyvalent MLV vaccines, which multiply in the host, elicit a stronger antigenic challenge to the animal and should mount a more effective and sustained immune response. 5,6,9 However, this can overwhelm the immune compromised or even healthy host that has ongoing exposure to other environmental stimuli as well as a genetic predisposition that promotes adverse response to viral challenge. 13,9,13 The recently weaned young puppy or kitten being placed in a new environment may be at particular risk. Furthermore, while the frequency of vaccinations is usually spaced 2 to 3 weeks apart, some veterinarians have advocated vaccination once a week in stressful situations. This practice makes little sense, scientifically or medically. 5 An augmented immune response to vaccination is seen in dogs with preexisting inhalant allergies (i. e., atopy) to pollens. 3 Furthermore, the increasing current problems with allergic and immunological diseases have been linked to the introduction of MLV vaccines more than 20 years ago. 6 While other environmental factors no doubt have a contributing role, the introduction of these vaccine antigens and their environmental shedding may provide the final insult that exceeds the immunological tolerance threshold of some individuals in the pet population. <br>  <br>  <br>  Predisposed Breeds <br>  Twenty years ago, this author began studying families of dogs with an apparent increased frequency of immune mediated hematological disease (i. e., AIHA, ITP, or both). 1,2 <br>  Among the more commonly recognized predisposed breeds were the Akita, American cocker spaniel, German shepherd dog, golden retriever, Irish setter, Great Dane, Kerry blue terrier, and all dachshund and poodle varieties; but predisposition was found especially in the standard poodle, longhaired dachshund, Old English sheepdog, Scottish terrier, Shetland sheepdog, shih tzu, vizsla, and Weimaraner, as well as breeds of white or predominantly white coat color or with coat color dilution (e. g., blue and fawn Doberman pinschers, the merle collie, Australian shepherd, Shetland sheepdog, and harlequin Great Dane). 13 Recently, other investigators have noted the relatively high frequency of AIHA, ITP, or both in American cocker spaniels 10 and Old English sheepdogs. 13 A significant proportion of these animals had been vaccinated with monovalent or polyvalent vaccines within the 30 to 45day period prior to the onset of their autoimmune disease. 1,2,10 Furthermore, the same breeds listed above appear to be more susceptible to other adverse vaccine reactions, particularly postvaccinal seizures, high fevers, and painful episodes of hypertrophic osteodystrophy (HOD). 3 For animals that have experienced an adverse vaccine reaction, the recommendation is often to refrain from vaccinating these animals until at least after puberty, and instead to measure serological antibody titers against the various diseases for which vaccination has been given. This recommendation raises an issue with the legal requirement for rabies vaccination. <br>  <br>  As rabies vaccines are strongly immunogenic and are known to elicit adverse neurological reactions, 3,5 it would be advisable to postpone rabies vaccination for such cases. A letter from the primary care veterinarian stating the reason for requesting a waiver of rabies vaccination for puppies or adults with documented serious adverse vaccine reactions should suffice. <br>  <br>  As further examples, findings from the author’s large, accumulated database of three susceptible breeds are summarized below. <br>  <br>  Vaccine Associated Disease in Old English Sheepdogs <br>  <br>  Old English sheepdogs appear to be predisposed to a variety of autoimmune diseases. 13,13 Of these, the most commonly seen are AIHA, ITP, thyroiditis, and Addison’s disease. 2,17 <br>  <br>  Between 1980 and 1990, this author studied 162 cases of immune mediated hematological diseases in this breed. One hundred twenty nine of these cases had AIHA, ITP, or both as a feature of their disease. Vaccination within the previous 30 days was the only identified triggering event in seven cases and was an apparent contributing factor in another 115 cases. 2 Thyroid disease was recognized as either a primary or secondary problem in 71 cases, which is likely an underestimate of the true incidence, as thyroid function tests were not run or were inconclusive in most of the other cases. <br>  <br>  Experience with a particular Old English sheepdog family supported a genetic predisposition to autoimmune thyroiditis, Addison’s disease, and AIHA or ITP or both? an example of the polyglandular autoimmune syndrome. 2,17 Pedigrees were available from 108 of the 162 Old English sheepdog cases of autoimmune disease; a close relationship was found among all but seven of the affected dogs. 2 Two of three pedigrees available from the studies of Day and Penhale 13 were also related to this large North American study group. <br>  <br>  Vaccine Associated Disease in Young Akitas <br>  Akitas also are subject to a variety of immune mediated disorders, including VogtKoyanagiHarada syndrome (VKH), pemphigus, and heritable juvenile onset immune mediated polyarthritis (IMPA). 3,14 Juvenile onset IMPA occurs in Akitas less than 8 months of age. Of 11 closely related puppies in the author’s case series, the mean age of onset was 14 weeks. 3 Initial signs appeared 3 to 29 days following vaccination with polyvalent MLV or killed virus or both, with a mean reaction time of 14 days. All had profound joint pain and cyclic febrile illness lasting 24 to 48 hours. Hemograms revealed mild non regenerative anemia, neutrophilic leukocytosis, and occasional thrombocytopenia. Joint aspiration and radiography indicated non septic, non erosive arthritis. Despite treatment for immune mediated disease and pyrexia, all eight dogs had relapsing illness and died or were euthanized by 2 years of age from progressive systemic amyloidosis and renal failure. Necropsies were performed on three dogs, two of which had glomerular amyloidosis and widespread evidence of vasculitis. The history, signs, and close association with immunization suggested that juvenile onset polyarthritis and subsequent amyloidosis in these Akitas may have been an autoimmune response triggered by the viral antigens or other components of vaccines. 3 The vaccine related history was reviewed for 129 puppies belonging to the family of Akitas discussed above. Polyvalent MLV vaccine was given to 104 of them, with 10 (9.8%) puppies showing adverse reactions and death. Another six puppies received a polyvalent all killed vaccine product (no longer commercially available) with no reactors, and 19 puppies received homeopathic nosodes initially followed by killed canine parvovirus (CPV) vaccine, with one reactor that died and one that became ill but survived. 3 A genetic basis for immune mediated diseases and immunodeficiencies states is well known. 1,2,12,13,15,17,18 The mechanism for triggering immune mediated disease is poorly understood, but predisposing factors have been implicated when genetically susceptible individuals encounter environmental agents that induce nonspecific inflammation, molecular mimicry, or both. 3,17 The combined effects of these genetic and environmental factors override normal self tolerance and are usually mediated by T cell imbalance or dys regulation. 17 Since the modern Akita arose from a relatively small gene pool, understanding the potential environmental triggers of juvenile onset IMPA has immediate importance. Numerous agents have been implicated, including drugs, vaccines, viruses, bacteria, chemicals, and other toxins. 13,10,11 Although the littermates from affected families typically end up in different locales, all undergo relatively standardized immunization procedures at a similar age.<br>  <br>  Vaccine Associated Disease in Young Weimaraners <br>  The Weimaraner breed appears to be especially prone to both immune deficiency and autoimmune diseases, which have been recognized with increasing frequency in related members of the breed over the past 15 years. 3 Autoimmune thyroiditis leading to clinically expressed hypothyroidism is probably the most common of these disorders, along with <br>  vaccine associated HOD of young Weimaraners. 2,3,17 During a 2year period (19861988), Couto evaluated 170 related Weimaraners, including affected puppies and their relatives, and the findings were relayed in a breed newsletter as discussed in an earlier reference. 3 Clinical signs of the affected dogs included high fevers, polyarthritis with pain and swelling typical of HOD, coughing and respiratory distress from pneumonia, enlarged lymph nodes, diarrhea, pyoderma, and mouth ulcers. In most cases, clinical signs were first detected shortly after vaccination with a second dose of polyvalent MLV vaccine when the puppies were between 2 and 5 months of age. This author has studied more than 60 Weimaraners with vaccine associated disease. In 24 cases described in a previous article, 3 the mean age of onset of clinical signs was 13.5 weeks, with a mean reaction time of 10.5 days post vaccination. Males were predominantly affected. All affected puppies showed high spiking fevers, cyclic episodes of pain, and polyarthritis (HOD)? a group of signs identical to those of the affected young Akitas described previously. Most affected puppies also showed leukocytosis (with neutrophilia or neutropenia), diarrhea, lethargy, anorexia, and enlarged lymph nodes. Some puppies also had levels of immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin M, or both below those expected for their age, and one puppy had immunoglobulin G (IgG) deficiency as well. Other signs included coughing, pneumonia, depression, seizures or ”spaced out” behavior, refusal to stand or move, and hyperesthesia (“ walking on eggshells”). The outcome for half of these cases was good (12 of the 24 are healthy adults), although two died, three were euthanized as puppies, and three remained chronically ill as adults. Another four cases were lost to follow up. <br>  <br>  Management of this clinical syndrome is best accomplished with an initial dose of parenteral corticosteroids followed by a tapering course of corticosteroids over 4 to 6 weeks. Systemic broad spectrum antibiotic may be given prophylactically, and vitamin C (500 to 1,000 mg daily) can be included to promote immune support. Recurring episodes are treated by increasing the corticosteroid dosage for a few days until the flare up has subsided. The response to initial corticosteroid treatment is always dramatic, with fever and joint pain usually subsiding within a matter of hours. <br>  Serological titers for canine distemper virus (CDV) and CPV were determined in 19 of the 24 affected Weimaraner puppies, and all were adequate. Upon reaching adulthood, serum antibody titers were reevaluated, and detectable CDV and CPV specific IgG persisted. Several of these dogs have subsequently developed hypothyroidism and are receiving thyroid replacement. 3,4,17 Thus, to avoid recurrence of adverse effects, which has been shown to be even more severe if another vaccine booster is given, serological titers for CDV and CPV are measured. 7 Another approach recommended by Weimaraner breeders and this author is to modify the vaccination protocol, especially for puppies from families known to have experienced adverse vaccine reactions. Examples would be to limit the number of antigens used in the vaccine series to those infectious agents of most clinical concern (i. e., CDV, CPV, and rabies virus), separating these and other antigens by 2to 3 week intervals, and giving rabies vaccine by itself at 6 months of age. A booster series is administered at 1 year by separating the CDV, CPV, rabies virus, and other vaccine components, where possible, and giving them on separate visits at least 2 weeks apart. Thereafter, serological antibody titers can be measured (except for those vaccines required by law, unless a specific exemption is made on an individual case basis). <br>  <br>  Recommendations <br>  Practitioners should be encouraged during the initial visit with a new puppy owner or breeder to review current information about the breed’s known congenital and heritable traits. Several databases, veterinary textbooks, and review articles contain the relevant information to assist here. 2 For those breeds at increased risk, the potential for adverse reactions to routine vaccinations should be discussed as part of this wellness program. Because breeders of atrisk breeds have likely alerted the new puppy buyer to this possibility, we should be mindful and respectful of their viewpoint, which may be more informed than ours about a specific breed or family issue. To ignore or dismiss these issues can jeopardize the client patient relationship and result in the client going elsewhere for veterinary services or even turning away from seeking professional care for these preventive health measures. As a minimum, if we are unaware of the particular concern expressed, we can research the matter or ask the client for any relevant scientific or medical documentation. The accumulated evidence indicates that vaccination protocols should no longer be considered as a “one size fits all” program. <br>  <br>  For these special cases, appropriate alternatives to current vaccine practices include: measuring serum antibody titers; avoidance of unnecessary vaccines or over vaccinating; using caution in vaccinating sick, very old, debilitated, or febrile individuals; and tailoring a specific minimal vaccination protocol for dogs of breeds or families known to be at increased risk for adverse reactions. 3,58 Considerations include starting the vaccination series later, such as at 9 or 10 weeks of age, when the immune system is more able to handle antigenic challenge; alerting the caregiver to pay particular attention to the puppy’s behavior and overall health after the second or subsequent boosters; and avoiding revaccination of individuals already experiencing a significant adverse event. Littermates of affected puppies should be closely monitored after receiving additional vaccines in a puppy series, as they, too, are at higher risk. Altering the puppy vaccination protocol, as suggested previously for the Weimaraner, is also advisable. <br>  <br>  Following these recommendations may be a prudent way for our profession to balance the need for individual patient disease prevention with the ageold physician’s adage, forwarded by Hippocrates, of “to help, or at least do no harm.” <br>  <a href="http://www.dogsadversereactions.com/vaccinePredisposed.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogsadversereactions.com/vacc...</a><br>  <br>  I hope that some of this will help.

Others may take as long as a year. Having him copy you as you whistle is a good first step. From there you can try to find a word or bunch of words that sound like the whistle.

AA12237913	Yes, RES will catch and eat any fish it's size or smaller. <br>  <br>  RES under 2" will not be able to catch the fish, but bigger ones will pick them off quite easily. Don't put expensive fish with them. If you really want to keep fish with RES, get a dozen feeder fish and put it in with the RES. Have the fish acclimate tot he tank surrondings for a day before the turtle is put in with them. If the turtle is used to the tank and the fisha re just dropped in, the fish will be confused and get slaughtered. <br>  <br>  Anyway, after the fish have gotten used to the tank, let the turtle in. The RES will catch and eat most of them leaving one or two. These couple of fish will often live a long time.<br>  <br>  Do not feed fish routinely, since they are fattening and may cause nutrient deficiencies (thiaminase).<br>  <br>  Check out these resources:<br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Care/care.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Care/ca...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Care/caresheet-red_ear_slider.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Care/ca...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.turtleforum.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.turtleforum.com</a>|`|30654961f1b41270da0c671bc35c1fdeaa	A turtle will eat a fish if it's small enough.

jElDgcCFaa	It does take quite some time especially because most of their colour is on their tails and that takes awhile to grow.|`|AA12237913	It takes 2-3 months, depending on temperature and food. If you don't keep your tank heated, it will take longer. As well, if you overfeed, they will grow quicker, but not the best practice.<br>  <br>  It takes platys and mollies all about the same time before they show colour.|`|e49de377def7dc80a5baa53274275b3baa	I think it depends if it is a male for a female, and what colors there are going to be.<br>  The females stay kinda grey, but the males get their colors really quick. My fry is only 2 weeks old, and the male has already vibrant colors.|`|ad58c73bba0bef03cc135a2e3b6734e8aa	It will be a couple of months before you see the color.  We had our guppies seperate from the rest of the tank for two months before color developed.  When they are big enough for you to see the color, they are also more than big enough to be back in the regular tank with the adult guppies.
AA12237913	Chances are they will fight, especially if you have a RES (red eared slider). When they're young, under 4", turtles get along very well, but as they reach maturity, they tend to be mroe aggressive, both males and females. It also depends on species and the turtle's temperment. RES are one of the most aggressive turtles and the most readily available. If you have a RES, it will bully all other turtles, same species or different.<br>  <br>  Generally, I find cooters to be the most sociable, but they get over 8-12" which is a pain to keep. I find male map turtles to be quite shy and stay small. You can try keeping another turtle with it, but if they fight, yoy must seperate or else some will get hurt (lose a limb).|`|4l7A5SE9aa	they will be fine together|`|7178b5eb3aeae9f55f07e95d66584a0aaa	I have seen snapping turtles and softshells snap at sliders and other basking turtles, especially at the legs during feeding times. However, you will most likely not have a problem, especially if they are of the same species. I recommend getting a turtle of the same size and species. Gender doesn't matter with small turtles, but large turtles should be opposite gender. Turtles are independent in the wild as soon as they hatch, however, I have had depressed turtles and found that giving them a companion livens them up (same species). And for exercise, give them minnows and small freshwater shrimp (as well as turtle food) and they will compete without biting each other to catch the prey (feeding frenzy) and its fun to watch. Sometimes they will tear a minnow in half. I highly recommend getting another turtle.|`|DXGX6tMIaa	I have had turtles and NO! Your turtle might actully want someone to play with!|`|q37VA2fsaa	They will most likely fight, especially if there is not enough room in the turtle tank. Make sure there is a water and dry area for them, at separate levels, so that each one can have their own space. If they have to struggle to get warm and dry, they will argue who basks long enough under the light. Get a good turtle book, or do some serious research on the net before getting a turtle. they bite, carry disease, small really bad when you don't clean them, and need special food and lighting, water conditions. I would always get in trouble with my bosses cuz i would never want to sell turtles. they are allot of work. i would tell the customers "buy a goldfish"|`|2e8a28c2e927f7d590e547745f8adbb6aa	they will prob not get on very well but shouldn't fight. make sure they are the same gender though.|`|G86jIhsbaa	That depends on what you have, and what you are planning to get.<br>  You really need to elaborate if you want a correct answer.
AA12237913	Turtles mate in water and females wander on land to find suitable lay sites, often walking a couple miles. Flooding would not get turtles to leave water. Very rarely will turtles migrate to another pond, but rather swim along waterways to find a new marsh/pond. The main reason you see turtles around is because they're laying eggs.<br>  <br>  If you're seeing a lot of box turtles, high domed land turtles, they will mate after it rains, but they are very secretive and hide in thick vegetation.|`|DLdSMWcYaa	Maybe we are doing a better job with the enviroment and they are starting to become more prevelent.|`|AA11593071	Probably mating season.|`|bZsrX0Ytaa	I asked our dept of fish and wildlife about it, they said that it was partially because of the rains we've gotten (Dallas area), but also because it's springtime and mating season.  This was about a month ago, but I would expect that turtles farther north are doing the same thing about now.<br>  <br>  Here's an article:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/05/20/turtle_lovers_tackle_road_kill_problem/" rel="nofollow">http://www.boston.com/news/local/article...</a>|`|hdojXU1eaa	At least you're seeing them! I've only seen ONE box turtle this year--any previous year I would've seen about a dozen turtles/tortoises by now! (And probably moved them out of the road.) In my area development is really doing a number on the wild turtle/tortoise population.<br>  <br>  Oh, and I think they come out at this time of year for mating season.
AA12237913	No, there are no health issues handling a turtle. It's like, is there a health issue for people handling raw chicken? Raw chicken, turtles and many animals carry salmonella, a type of bacteria. As long as you wash your hands with soap afterwards, you are fine and there is little or no risk of getting sick (i.e. uspet stomach, vomitting, etc). Treat a turtle like a piece of raw chicken.<br>  <br>  BTW, both CB (captive bred) and WC (wild caught) turtles may carry salmonella. It is not gauranteed all do and it's a stretch for breeders to say their turtles are salmonella free.<br>  <br>  Anyway, there is no health risk. I have kept over 75 turtles and tortoises, and I have tanks and set-ups everywhere, My wife has gone through two pregnancies, I have young children and my parents (seniors) come freuqently and nobody has had salmonellosis from touching my turtles, tanks and furniture in the house. <br>  <br>  Wash your hands and you'll be fine. :)|`|4THECwYjaa	It could do to salmonella, it could be really bad, that's why you have to wash hands thoroughly after handling turtles, and many other reptiles, make sure to clean anything that may also come into contact with the reptile, turtle, example counters, other bowls ect, wash with a bacterial soap.|`|AA11233242	I know that after handling turtles you are supposed to wash your hands, because you can get salmonella.  Not sure if that applies to baby turtles or just adult turtles.  As far as other health issues I have no idea that they cause any.|`|G56VIGXaaa	Yes but most likely no. There is a slight chance of salmonella but other than that there are really no issues. If you are really worried then 1. always wash your hands after handling.2 Make sure you have no open cuts or scrapes. If so any sickness is more likely to get in.3. I'm not totally sure bout this but I think you could go to the vet and get shots. Another tip is to make sure you buy it store bought for two reasons One, is that you have a better chance that you can't get anything and two it's illegal to keep wild turtles in captivity in some states. Hope this helps. Good luck. :)|`|KyOOX52oaa	Just make sure you wash your hands babys are more likely to carry salmonella than adult turtles.|`|XuiTACfjaa	If it's from a pet store, it shouldn't be a problem.  If caught in the wild - there's a greater chance for salmonella.  I've had a box turtle (from a pet store) for over 10 years now, but I still wash my hands after handling it - just to be safe.  Our dogs lick it every once in a while, and they are OK too.
Pp5juixDaa	A full grown female gets to be 12 inches in diameter and a full grown male gets to be 9 inches in diameter. A general rule of thumb is 10 gallons per square inch of shell plus a little extra for basking.  If you plan to house them together forever, you're looking at a tank that's over 200 gallons easily. I'm assuming you don't know sex, but if they are both females then the largest you'd need is about a 260 if you keep them together. Personally, I split my two RES into their own tanks. The male has a 120 gallon tank and the female has a 180 gallon tank.|`|6f78ae8cc00bcab14239ba0bee10d409aa	a 55 gal tank should give them plenty of room so that they can have an area of land as well as water.  make sure you get a really good pond type filter for them.  A cannister filter works great.  I would fill the tank a little more than half full.  Be sure to provide a sloping ramp for them to be able to get out of the water.|`|AA12237913	The male adult RES gets to 7-8" and female gets to 9-11". That will take 7-10 years or so to achieve those sizes.<br>  <br>  What size should you buy for your little turtles? 20G, 50G, 75G or a 100G? Well, a good guide is for every inch of turtle shell, you should provide 10 gallons of swimming water. That is fine for smaller turtles under 4-5". I find turtles when they get over 5", they need a lot more swimming room, and I would say 15-20 gallon per inch of turtle shell.<br>  <br>  If you have two RES at 2-3" each, you'd be looking at least 50-60 gallons, but that would not be enough, since by this time next year, they will have added another inch or two. Smaller habitants encourages them to fight and less places to hide and get away.<br>  <br>  Here is what I suggest. Look for a used 75 gallon tank in local classifieds (online, newspapers, pet stores, and fish groups). I say used, b/c you will need a bigger one when they are full grown. You'll also need a bigger filter. I highly recommend filstar xP3 or Fluval 404 (the new 405 is more expensive, and not better in quality). I'd buy these new, about $100 online shipped b/c new ones carry warranty and used ones often have leaks in their seals and various small problems.<br>  <br>  Anyway, if you have the dough, you can buy a 100G tank or bigger. Tanks larger than 75G use thicker glass and often they are more expensive. A used 75G tank should cost around $75-100, or less. I would not pay more than that.<br>  <br>  In the end, you'll need at least a 200 gallon tank for your two RES. If you keep them in a basement, you can consider using a preformed pond or a rubbermaid horse trough. You would use a pond filter for these. But this really provides them a great home.<br>  <br>  One more thing, RES are very aggressive and they will likely fight as they grow older. Both males and females can be the aggressors. Often you need to keep them apart. So, buying 200G plus tank right now, might not be your solution.<br>  <br>  I keep 1.2 RES (male.female) right now, 6", 8", and 10", and I keep them all alone. I also keep 12 other turtles as well in many, many set-ups throughout the house and in my classroom at school.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|83452feb5fa99a172290f21a90fb6daaaa	reptile critter cages by all glass have turtle cages i dont remember the dimensions but the one that has the bottem like a 55 gallon is perfect for them! make sure you provide enough uvb lights, heating lights, and night time lights and are doing a weekly 25% water change, not a full water change<br>  www.wnyherp.org has a great care sheat for res's

Your description now is quite broad as many turtles have orange on them.<br>  <br>  Really, you don't want a wild turtle, no matter what kind it is. They don't ever adjust to captivity, it is stressful for them, they die prematurely in captivity after being taken from the wild, it hurts the ecosystem, and you more than likely don't have the proper habitat for it as you don't even know what kind it is. Let it go where you found it. If for any reason, the happiness and wellbeing of the turtle. If you really want a turtle, do some research on them, provide the proper habitat, and then bring one home from a reputable breeder or trustable pet store.

Maybe you could find a kid that's in "FFA" that would like to show him in fairs. You didn't fail so don't worry about that. I know people that had critters that were just not suited for them.|`|0lf7MKIQaa	Well as i see it, you should have never taken the jump if it wasn't the right one.  But humans are not without error.  <br>  <br>  You need to do what is right for the animal.  What that is, is totally up to you.  If this were a child, could you just find it another home, NO!  Since you volunteer for a shelter you hear all the excuses that come with those animals.  Your excuse is no different then the ones you hear at the shelter.  I've heard them all to when i worked at one many years ago and i thought some of them were pretty lame too.   Asking for a home visit is like saying "oh i want to keep in touch with the rabbit after it goes into the new home" and we all know that never happens either!!    <br>  <br>  You've only had this rabbit for 5 months and you want to get rid of it and get a cat.  Will you do the same thing to the cat once you get that too?   This may sound harsh, i asure you it's not.   Rabbits life span are not long, about 5 yrs.  <br>  <br>  I say you took the responsibility of the rabbit, you should stick it out.  Whether you like it or not, you committed to the rabbit.  No harm in getting a cat along with it, unless parents say you can't.  <br>  <br>  Life is full of things we don't want to do.  This is just a part of life that we have to do things we don't want to do.  I don't think you will harm the rabbit while it's in your care, so i know the rabbit will be taken care of.  But you took on the responsibility of this animal and you need to follow it through, just like you would have to if you had a child, only a lot shorter time period.  <br>  <br>  Next time, think and research an animal before making that final leap.<br>  <br>  Although you may not like what my opinion is, you know it's the right one to make for the rabbits sake.  You know no one will take care of it like you truly do.  What would you do if you found a home and they didn't take care of it?<br>  <br>  Good Luck with your decision!
N3m6bjG1aa	anda con un veterinario y preguntale sobre eso|`|a53360fdb26e99ce45bfe7cfd1e2cc5aaa	bien, puede ser por varios motivos ella se cree la alfa y tiene que marcar su territorio, si las hembras tambien marcan. La solucion seria ponerla en su sitio. si picas mi nick doy muchos consejos de como hacerlo.<br>  otro motivo seria que esa es una manera para que tu le hagas caso, porque ella sabe que si hace eso enseguida tu vas y le ri?es, y la castigas en fin le haces caso.  la perra si no la pillas al segundo de hacerlo no sabe porque le ri?es , no entiende nada de lo que dices pero si que capta tu tono de voz, la postura de tu cuerpo y ella se doblega ante eso. Hay un metodo muy bueno para que no lo haga mas, primero es que cuando lo haga ignorale, si lo has leido bien, no le ri?as, no le pegues, tu haz como si nada y mira su acctitud, si descubres la meada lo mismo, actua como si no la vieras. Llega a casa y acaricia a tu perra como si nada, luego para que no lo haga, asustala, seguro que tiene lugares fijos para mear, en esos sitios tienes que atar la tapa de una olla, una lata de refresco con piedrecitas o lo que quieras, atalo con una cuerda y que al caer al suelo hagan mucho ruido. Lo has de poner de tal manera que cuando ella se acerque, se agache o lo que quieras, se enganche con esa cuerda y la tapa o lata caigan al suelo y ese ruido la asuste. Una cosa tu no has de estar presente, ella no te tiene que relacionar con el ruido. Ya veras, otra cosa para que ella no demande atencion de esa manera prueba a hacerle mas caso.  Y sigue con lo de la calle, premiala con comida si es necesario cuando lo haga en la calle.

AA11501528	First I'm sorry you are having to go through this, it very odd.  Second I have never heard of the bone with poison but I have heard of hamburger with anti-freeze.  That kills dogs quickly.  Good luck finding out who is doing this.|`|vf35spTGaa	I wouldn't doubt that someone would do that. Definitely keep the bones away from your dogs, and keep a watchful eye on them, it would be awful if something happened your dogs.|`|znf6Hte8aa	I know what you are going through. Last year my 2 dogs would bark like crazy at anyone they saw. Since my dogs won't eat anything from anyone except me I was lucky. There was a bag full of old chicken in it with lot of rat poison thrown over my fence in it my dogs didn't eat it since they won't eat anything when I'm not there. I trained my dog not you eat anything from strangers from puppy hood. I think you should train your dogs to never accept any treats from strangers. Don't let anyone give treats to your dog make sure you always do it . Test them ask you friend to feed them and make sure they don't eat it.|`|p7swtBYzaa	You should never leave your dogs outside alone while you are gone, very dangerous for them.<br>  <br>  Nothing you can do if someone decides to hurt them while you are gone - put them inside!!!!<br>  <br>  Certainly bones could have some sort of poison on them, why would you take a change on your neighbors getting angry enough to do that?<br>  Obviously your dogs disturb people with their constant barking, it's really not fair to the dogs or neighbors to leave them out there like that.|`|8Q3H49YSaa	i agree with stephanie|`|2rJONL48aa	Yeah I've heard of that and people getting chunks of steak and other stuff to poison dogs.

Then buy a cheap survalence system and put it around (Maybe motion detector ones) and make sure everytime you let them out go with them. If it doesn't work put a big 'ol sign in the yard saying you know whose doing it and if they do it again you'll hunt them down and beat them up.|`|bMW1u8DSaa	y dont u call the police and ask them if they could put a surveillance or something on ur house. or have a friend watch the house for a day and when someone goes to put up a note or throw a bone into the yard then ask them to confront them. it could be that the person is throwing the bones in hopes they will be quiet. but if u r nervous i would call the police or have a friend watch the house for a day.<br>  <br>  EDIT: also buy some kennels and keep ur dogs in the kennel in the house during the day. if u r worried do this

xJSYjKqBaa	Usualmente un loro africano usualmente debe tener mas de un a?o de edad para aprender a hablar, asi que tendras que tener paciencia. Peor puedes irlo estimulando desde ahora.<br>  <br>  Te doy algunas recomendaciones que te pueden ser utiles.<br>  <br>  1. Mucha paciencia. Tienes que darle confianza a tu mascota para que poco a poco se vaya entusiasmando.<br>  2. El animal debe tener la edad apropiada, entre 6 meses y 1 a?o para la mayoria de las especies. En tu caso como dijimos debe ser en promedio  mayor a un a?o de edad. <br>  3. El estimulo para hablar depende en gran medida de cuan bien se sienta el ave contigo. Crear un lazo de amistad y confianza con el ayuda mucho.<br>  4. Comienza a estimularlo (aun no tenga la edad mencionada) porque asi lo iras preparando gradualmente.<br>  5. Empieza con unas muy pocos palabras como: Hola, lorito, cotorra. Es preferibles las palabras cortas y que incluyan el uso de vocales fuertes y el sonido erre.<br>  6. repitele un poco varias veces al dia, pero no hagas sesiones muy largas porque acabarias aburriendo al animal.<br>  7. Al momento de las lecciones, procura que el lugar este tranquilo , sin mucho moviento de gente o ruido que distraigan la atencion del animal.<br>  8. Cuando veas que este intentando hablar, premialo dandole un mani o algo asi, pero no demasiado que llegue a distraerse.<br>  9. Mucha gente aconseja que nuestra linea visual este por encima de la linea visual del loro para que el sienta autoridad. Este detalle no lo considero relevante pero puedes intentarlo.<br>  Lo que si es cierto es que entre el animal y uno se establece una relacion de jerarquia, y sin maltratarlo, oprimirlo o estresarlo, hay que enviarle el mensaje de quien manda a quien.<br>  10. No sigas ese estupido consejo de embriagar al animal y que para que hable mas. No puedo decirte si el metodo sera efectivo o no pero el da?o a salud del animal puede ser irreparable.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Pronto, no te deseperes.

Si tú crees que cuando morimos nuestra alma se va al cielo, al edén o cualquier otro hermosos lugar;  o si crees que reencarnamos según nos hayamos comportado; o cualquier otra cosa. Si tú tienes la certeza de que los animales tienen sentimientos, sienten amor, tienen alma, pues sabrás qué ha sido del alma de tu perrita.<br>  Yo en lo particular creo que no es diferente de lo que sucede cuando una persona muere. Además, dicen que cuando estás a punto de morir, los perros  que hayas tenido en tu vida llegan a ayudarte a cruzar al otro lado. Mi abuelo cuando estaba muriendo (él murió muy lentamente) hablaba y hablaba y mencionó un camino, un río, y a dos de los perros que tuvo, que los quiso mucho.<br>  Entiendo tu dolor, y es necesario un período de duelo, pero la vida sigue y no se detiene por nadie, así que no te olvides de vivirla. Si sabes que le diste todo el amor a tu perrita, pues despreocúpate ya, seguro que ella está feliz ahora, y que así como tú la recuerdas y la llevas en tu corazón, ella también tiene tu recuerdo.<br>  Cuando estés listo, pues consigue otra perrita o perrito a gattia para compartir tu amor!|`|ba4302ef6749dae3af640f0e63667c19aa	eso me paso a mi, se lo que se siente, pero así es la vida,  pero si lloras por que el sol se fue cuando cae la noche, no podrás ver las estrellas; dale chance a otra perrita para que la ames y la cuides|`|lgcyE1IVaa	te comprendo también envenenaron a mi perrito adorado, odio a la gente estúpida que anda envenenando perro ajeno, lo amo, lo amé, y lo amaré... ya planearemos una venganza...<br>  yo sé que no es la solución, pero me compré un perro a los 15 días, no podía con el sufrimiento y la costumbre, que aunque no son iguales, tiene otras locuras y gracias, y es como empezar de nuevo, es muy gracioso y buena compa?ía, se que es diferente pero es alguien a quien le he dado apertura, además ya entiendo muchas conductas de mi anterior perro, es algo muy conductual de estímulo conducta... interesante, deja q pase el tiempo, súfrela sé que ha sido especial... y pide justicia.

One speak to the owner and ask that they keep the cats on their property or you will be forced to file a complaint with the police department.  Second option:  call animal control every time you see the cats and tell them they are trying to bite you!

Puede infectar cualquier casta del perro y aparece en perros ser similar a Tos canina (también llamado Tos de la perrera o Tracheobronchitis canino infeccioso). Sin embargo, los estudios tempranos de la gripe canina indican que la enfermedad se ha adaptado en el perro de una infección común en caballos. Es una gripe canina altamente contagiosa y a veces mortal que se está separando en perreras y en las pistas del perro alrededor del país. Se ha divulgado en galgos en las pistas en la Florida, Iowa, Massachusetts, el Arizona, Virginia Occidental, Wisconsin, y Tejas.<br>  <br>  Se parece actualmente haber tanta histeria e información falsa sobre esta infección que emerge en perros como difícilmente evidencia científica. Las rumores de centenares de perros que son afectados en perreras a través del país son unsubstantiated. La mejor fuente de la información sobre su área local con respecto hechos sobre gripe canina sea su asociación médica veterinaria del veterinario local y de su estado. La información presentó en esta página se significa ser terminantemente que… una actualización en la información reciente. Su veterinario debe ser consultado para la diagnosis apropiada, evaluación paciente, y la terapia individualizada para cualquier enfermedad o desorden su perro pudo haber adquirido. Hay una multiplicidad de desórdenes y las enfermedades que harán un perro toser y amordazar y cortar. ése es porqué el gravamen individual para su perro es imprescindible discernir la causa verdadera de las dificultades del perro.Toser es una forma importante de mantener la garganta y las vías respiratorias limpias o permeables. Sin embargo, una tos excesiva puede significar que existe una enfermedad o trastorno subyacente.<br>  <br>  Algunas veces, la tos puede ser seca, mientras que otras veces se considera productiva, en la cual se expulsa moco, también llamado flema o esputo.<br>  <br>  La tos puede ser aguda o crónica:<br>  <br>  Tos aguda: generalmente comienza de manera repentina; a menudo se debe a un resfriado , una gripe o una infección sinusal y por lo general desaparece después de dos a tres semanas. <br>  Tos crónica: dura más de dos o tres semanas. <br>  Causas comunes:<br>  Además de infecciones recientes de las vías respiratorias, tales como el resfriado común y la gripe, otras causas comunes de la tos abarcan:<br>  <br>  El asma y las alergias <br>  Las infecciones pulmonares como la neumonía o bronquitis aguda <br>  La enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva crónica ( enfisema o bronquitis crónica ) <br>  Sinusitis que lleva a un goteo retronasal <br>  Enfermedad pulmonar como bronquiectasia , enfermedad pulmonar intersticial o tumores <br>  Enfermedad por reflujo gastroesofágico (GERD) <br>  Consumo de cigarrillo <br>  Tabaquismo pasivo <br>  Exposición a contaminantes del aire <br>  Inhibidores ECA (medicamentos utilizados para controlar la presión arterial) <br>  Aunque la tos puede ser un síntoma problemático, generalmente es la forma de curación del cuerpo. A continuación se presentan algunos consejos para ayudar a aliviar la tos:<br>  <br>  Si la persona tiene tos seca con cosquilleo, puede ensayar con pastillas para la tos o caramelos duros, pero éstos nunca se deben dar a ni?os menores de tres a?os porque pueden provocar ahogamiento. <br>  Utilizar un vaporizador o tomar una ducha de vapor. Ambas cosas incrementan la humedad en el aire y pueden ayudar a aliviar una garganta seca. <br>  Tomar muchos líquidos, ya que éstos ayudan a diluir el moco en la garganta y facilitan la expectoración. <br>  NOTA: algunos expertos médicos han recomendado evitar el uso de antitusígenos en muchas situaciones. Se recomienda hablar con el médico antes de tomar cualquier tipo de antitusígeno de venta libre, incluyendo los que vienen específicamente etiquetados para los ni?os.<br>  <br>  Los medicamentos que pueden adquirirse sin receta médica incluyen:<br>  <br>  Guayafenesina que ayuda a disolver el moco. Se deben ingerir grandes cantidades de líquido con este medicamento. <br>  Descongestionantes que ayudan a resolver la rinorrea y aliviar el goteo retronasal. Sin embargo, estos medicamentos NO se deben administrar a ni?os menores de seis a?os, a menos que el médico lo haya indicado específicamente. De igual modo, las personas hipertensas no deben tomar descongestionantes. <br>  Para las infecciones virales, como el resfriado o la gripe, no se debe esperar que el médico prescriba antibióticos, ya que éstos no surten efecto con los virus ni tampoco ayudan a aliviar la tos a causa de las alergias.<br>  Como te dije sera mejor q lo lleve a tu veterinario.<br>  <br>  Una pronta mejoria a tu perrito|`|CpvXrG4Haa	Es aún un cachorro.

Felicidades.|`|2vTevtdkaa	pues aver adoptar lo que se dice adoptar no pero la reogi de la calle y bueno fue una de las mejores perras que e tenido la verdad esque no me acuerdo mucho porque era bastante peqe?a pero bueno de lo poco que me auerdo siempre me estava protegindo y de todo i cuando pasaba un perro garnde a mi lado o se aercaba se poni a dar vualtas al rededor mio  para protejerme y  muxas cosas parecidas  pero bueno no me acurdo casi ni de la mitad<br>  <br>  <br>  esopero que te ayude|`|577a04775dddb4978a953519c4340d06aa	Yo adopte un cocker de 3 a?o (o tres y medio, los due?os no se acordaban de la edad del perro)<br>  Porque ya no lo podían cuidar. y lo revacune porque tampoco me supieron decir cuando lo habían vacunado por ultima vez.<br>  Al mes de tenerlo tuve que ense?arle a jugar. Porque no jugaba. Le daban ganas como de perseguir la pelota pero no sabia que hacer con ella.<br>  Y era el mas desconfiado de todos, y el mas mal educado.<br>  Eso solo con paciencia se les quita, yo al mio lo eduque con reforzamiento positivo. Premio si haces lo que yo digo, nada si no obedeces. Y mucha paciencia.<br>  <br>  Los primeros meses me saco canas verdes porque como buen cocker estaba ofendidisimo de que lo echaran de su casa, y fuera de lugar en mi casa. Así que estaba enojado todo el día. Pero son perros y buscan a toda costa ser parte del grupo.<br>  <br>  Aún tan adulto se pudo educar y adaptar. Ya tengo cinco a?os con el, y es un perro agradecido y cari?oso, pero no es meloso, Y juega!<br>  <br>  Algunas de las cosas que hacen normalmente los perros (corretear lagartijas, ladrarle a los ′pájaros) las hace, otras cuantas no.  Pero eso pasa cuando han estado abandonados desde chicos, que no saben qué hacer. Y aprenden después.|`|DzuqaWklaa	hoal ypo adopte auna perrita callejera la lleve al veterinario porque e staba en muy mal estado nio me la mejoraron porque tieen diez a?os ya (tenia ocho cuando al recogi) y decian que por su edads y estado no era aconsejable operarla asi que no lo hice peor al eh cuidado y la lleve aotro veterinario hace uan semana y me repoitio lomismo epro me dijo que ocmo al he estado cuidando puede durar un `par d ea?os ams incluso tres , no te puedo decir que esagradecida epor de que e sfeliz lo es tieen comida agua y un hogar paar pasar su vejez es uan maltes mestiza y e smuy tarnquila pero parece que ela he cuidado demasiado bien porque ahoar si quiere algo exige con un ladrido jajajajajaj saludos|`|TbYll6Cqaa	Adopté una perra que tenía menos de un mes de nacida y la iban a sacrificar porque la madre murió en el parto.
