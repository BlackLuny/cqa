20080301184733AAPqxYp	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	I'm trying to decide what classes to take next year. Band or Chorus?	I want to learn about music-I write songs sometimes and want to learn how to put them into music. I really enjoy playing instruments, so I'm wondering if I should take band next year. If I don't take it next year, I can take it the year after, but only for one year. If I take it this year, I can take it the year after, too.   Our school has one of the best bands in the state.   I don't want to take band because it would take up a whole year. I want to take Spanish and also this class called Writer's Roundtable. The Chorus teacher says we will be learning a little bit about reading music next year, so I'm thinking I should take that. My dad also says I can learn how to play piano, maybe. So should I still take band, just because I'd enjoy it and I want to learn about music? Or should I sign up for piano lessons and do chorus, too?

No other primatologist or ethologist has made the cover of National Geographic more than Jane Goodall. Not even Louis Leaky gets more recognition. Her name is synonymous with the names Flo, Freud, and David Greybeard. Jane Goodall is more than just the "chimpanzee lady". Her work gives new insight to our own humanness and humaneness. We now have the knowledge to explore our own behaviours and emotions in a new light.     We share many things with chimpanzees. Jane Goodall has shown us this through her research at the Gombe National Reserve in Tanzania. We share 98% of our DNA with chimpanzees. They often use facial expressions that look uncannily human, although we will never know if they truly possess any emotions that correspond with the expression. Chimps often greet one another with a kiss, hug, or gentle hand touch. Babies stay with their mothers until they reach adulthood. Chimps are omnivorous. They can make and use tools. All of these behaviours were researched and observed by Dr. Jane Goodall for the last 38 years.    Jane was born in London, England on April 3, 1934. Her father, Mortimer, was an engineer. Her mother, Vanne, is an author. Jane grew up in a large house on the ocean near Bourenmouth, England. Two of Jane's aunts also shared the house with Jane's family (Uglow 1989).    Jane married Hugo van Lawick, a Dutch photographer, Hugo van Lawick, in 1964. In Gombe when Hugo was covering Jane for National Geographic. They had one son, named Hugo, better known as Grub (Goodall 1971).    Grub grew up in Tanzania as his mother did her research. Jane and Hugo wanted to raise their children in much the same manner as chimpanzees raise their babies. Jane admired the compassion and patience of Flo, an older chimp mother.   Jane and Hugo later divorced, and Jane remarried to Derek Bryceson, a politician and former head of the national parks in Tanzania. Unfortunately, Bryceson died in 1980 of cancer, after only five years of marriage (Nichols 1995).    Jane found her love of living things from her mother, and had her own passion of nature. She did not go to college, instead, she took secretarial courses, and waited tables to help pay for her first trip to Africa (Davies 1997). Soon her dreams of the African landscape would come true.    Jane, a young woman in her twenties, found herself in Africa. She took a secretarial job in Nairobi, Kenya to support herself. Jane didn't like the work much, but she was fulfilling a lifelong dream. It was only a year after her arrival before she heard that anthropologist Louis Leakey and his wife Mary were digging near her in Zaire. She made a trek to meet them. Leakey had been planning a research study of the great apes. He wanted to find more commonalties between them and humans. Leakey felt there was more to the great apes than we knew; our genetic link loomed large over us. What did it mean? He took Jane on as his secretary. She organized his research notes for the Natural Museum of History (Uglow, 1989). As his latest research project came into shape, Leakey thought Jane Goodall might be good for the project. It has been said that he wanted someone without a lot of training in field of ethology or primatology. He wanted an unbiased perspective on the subject. He chose Jane to start the project on Chimpanzees on the Gombe National Reserve in Tanzania. He funded the study, and told her in might take ten or more years to complete it. Jane thought possibly three.    Jane has been doing research at Gombe for 38 years now.?Jane went into the jungle, to explore the lives of chimpanzees. Gombe is in Tanzania which sits along Lake Tanganyika, and borders Burundi and the Congo. Jane made two very surprising discoveries during the first three months at Gombe.    Jane was very discouraged and depressed after only a few weeks at Gombe. The chimps would not let her within 50 yards of them, and she had observed very little.   Jane eventually grew very close to the chimps at Gombe. They would soon allow her to follow them, as they led the way. They greet her as they do each other, with a touch or a kiss. Her sense of patience and trust won them over.?Three months into the study Jane made her first big discovery. She was observing a male chimp, she named David Greybeard, up a tree with a baby bush pig in his hands. David Greybeard was eating meat. This astounded Jane; chimpanzees had been thought of as herbivores, who occasionally ate small bugs. Chimpanzees had never before been seen or recorded as eating meat. Like humans, chimps are omnivores (Goodall 1971).?   It was within weeks before Jane made another important discovery. David Greybeard was digging in a termite mound. He was us

Thank you to Yahoo friends who will help me improve my English writing skills in advance.   **********************************   Dear Mrs. xxx,       I was informed from a coordinator for foreign students that I have to pay a tuition fee for the next year by at the end of March to keep my niece’s seat at her school.  I wonder if you can send a written tuition fee notice for the next year by Fax to my home at 000-000-0000 on Monday.        Yujin is not a new student, so I wonder if we have to pay for the application fee or deposit this year as well.  I'd like to know how much total tuition fee we have to pay this year is.  Yujin is not belonging to any agent.  I know the school board pays ten percents of the tuition to an agent that a student comes from for kind of a fee-paying. However, we haven’t got any discount for her tuition. I worked on everything for her study in Canada.       I paid the payment for visa extension today and Yujin will bring the receipt to her school. I wonder if I have to pay a tuition fee for the next year prior to the visa renewal.       Prior to paying the tuition fee, I like to make an appointment with you next week but Monday.  I need your advice related to my niece education matter and her tuition for this as well.  My niece told me that she likes to go back to Korea in Feburary, 2010.      I look forward to hearing from you.

20090108045815AA87YzZ	Education & Reference;Trivia	Connaissez-vous la théorie du mouton....?	La théorie du mouton... scientifiquement prouvée !   Un troupeau de moutons ne peut se déplacer qu'à  la vitesse du mouton le plus lent.    Quand le troupeau est pourchassé, ce sont les plus lents et les plus faibles qui sont attaqués en premier. Cette sélection naturelle est bonne pour le troupeau en général, parce que la vitesse du troupeau augmente à  mesure que les plus lents et les plus faibles sont éliminés.     De la même fa?on, le cerveau humain ne peut fonctionner plus vite que ses cellules les plus lentes. Comme on le sait aujourd'hui, la consommation d'alcool détruit les cellules du cerveau. Naturellement ce sont les cellules les plus lentes et les plus faibles qui sont détruites en premier. On peut donc en déduire qu'une consommation d'alcool élimine les cellules les plus faibles, rendant ainsi notre cerveau de plus en plus performant.     Ce qui explique pourquoi on se sent toujours un peu plus intelligent après 4 ou 5 apéros.  J'le savais...

What i would like to know is; is there any place in Japan that would fulfill my educational needs (lol), that can teach me some aspect of Game Design and is based around international students like me?      Any advice/answers/suggestions appreciated!      Ash

I remember in The Autobiography of Malcolm X a part when he talks about his time in prison and mentions how it is an especially cruel punishment to lock a human being behind bars (with emphasis on the bars part). Though people who have never been in prison usually do not understand this, the image of endless vertical bars forever haunts most inmates even after they are released.   Could someone find the exact quote when he says that prison bars are a cruel punishment?
