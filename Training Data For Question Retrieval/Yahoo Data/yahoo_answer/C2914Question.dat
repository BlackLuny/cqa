20090219230455AAAdWgR	Environment;Global Warming	Where did the "it's called 'climate change' now" myth start?	Every day an AGW contrarian, during one of their rants, throws in something to the effect of "now they're calling it climate change because they were scared they might be wrong!"       A few people saying this could be ignored, but the sheer number of people who say it makes me think there must be some source for it, and a very convincing one at that--even some regular contributors to this site make this argument from time to time, which surprises me.      Of all of the skeptic arguments out there, this one has got to make the least sense to me, since it can so easily be understood to be false just by looking up the word 'climate' in a dictionary...      So anyway. To those fond of making this little argument, where did you first hear it?

20090203115445AAMqDib	Environment;Global Warming	Is "Global Warming" like seeing Religious Figures In Grilled Cheese Sandwiches?	If you really believe, then you can see the face clearly, just below the melted cheddar just like you can see climate temperatures increase even when there is a long cooling trend that drives temperatures below the considered average.      Are the two related?      Do people have such a vested interest in so-called "Global Warming" that they start seeing things that don't exist?

20081019125133AAQsoZt	Environment;Alternative Fuel Vehicles	What alternative fuels are out there for petrol-powered cars?	Hi! I love the bog old American muscle cars of the 1960s through to the 1970s but I am conscious of fuel consumption and environmental impact.       Nevertheless, I would one day like to have one of these cars as a weekend ride, to take me to the coast and back on a Sunday (about a fifty-mile round trip).       What is the MPG figure on something like a Camaro, Charger etc., and are there any other fuels the car can be converted to which would be better for Mother Nature but still offer the same or better performance, if money was no issue? Thanks!

20090203114133AApJtPH	Environment;Other - Environment	What are some alternative products I can use that don't test on animals?	I hate the horrors of the animal testing and didn't realize how many of my products were on PETA's animal testing list. I knew it was occurring but I never knew how many companies were actually doing it. I also noticed that the aromatherapy by bath and body works say "never tested on animals" so I am pretty happy about that. But unfortunately Infusium, Garnier, the cosmetics and other products I use do. I threw it all out and now I want to find some good alternatives to the products I got rid of. I am willing to spend a little extra for having products that don't test on animals. If you could also supply the store for any suggested alternatives I'd greatly appreciate it.

Amazingly, he is all in one peace. I want to hold him a funeral. But I am having a moral dilemma because I want to bury him, but I am not sure if it is safe for the earth. Would it be safe, or will it make my lawn grass die or will squirrels choke on it?
20081105081934AAgbXjA	Environment;Global Warming	Pirates and global warming speech?	I am doing a  15 min persuasive speech on global warming, and i would like to have at least 5 mins on the effect of pirates on the global climate.      The problem is i can only get about 1-2 mins worth of information and my info isn't very persuasive.      i already have some charts showing the correlation between the two, but i still need an explanation on how the decreased pirate population effects the global climate. (I am trying to leave the flying spaghetti monster out of this as much as possible due to the fact that my teacher most likely does not understand the beliefs of the CotFSM)
