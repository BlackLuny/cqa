I was gobby enough to convince them otherwise.

When a company is in default, no one will deal with it buy or sell its products, because no one knows if they will be paid.  So they file for bankruptcy, allow a judge to sort things out, and most of the time, they reemerge from bankruptcy.<br>  <br>  The price of a bankrupt company is speculation on how much it will be worth, when/if it comes out of bankruptcy.

This has always been applauded, and many will say to stay with that no matter what.  Question is, has the government been doing the conservative rational thing.  Is this just another bump in the road like the others that should be overlooked?<br>  Personally, I'm a trader vs an investor.  I was lucky that a retired financial field worker warned me of these times years before, and I sold off all my mutual funds. So my monies didn't go to hell via tha market, though I suffer with worker's pride unemployment...it doesn't take much to get me to quit and to tell the company what I really think about their methods.<br>  I keep most of my money in money market funds (but that may change soon), didn't buy a house at the height of the bubble though I was primed to, and keep a little money to the side to short-term and daytrade using long and short positions.  In retrospect, I wish I had bought the CDs that I was tempted with while the interest rates were higher.  I would still sell my mutual funds today if I had any left.<br>  Even though the money market funds are supposed to be almost the safest thing in the world and are guaranteed  for my time frame at most companies until April 30th, I still worry even about them.  But that's where most of my money is at.. even with the low rates.  <br>  For the conservative investor, short-term CDs might be the best bet at the moment.  Short-term because interest rates will likely go up.  Now, even these need to be checked to see that they're insured. (see link) People might recommend bond or Tips funds, but I'm not seeing the return in them right now.<br>  I think one has to ask their nervous system how much it can stand.

How is the credit repaid?<br>  <br>  A. The first-time homebuyer credit is similar to a 15-year interest-free loan. It is repaid in 15 equal annual installments beginning with the second tax year after the year the credit is claimed. You may need to adjust your withholding or make quarterly estimated tax payments to ensure you are not under-withheld.<br>  <br>  Some exceptions apply to the repayment rule:<br>  <br>  If you die, any remaining annual installments are not due. If you filed a joint return and then you die, your surviving spouse would be required to repay his or her half of the remaining repayment amount.<br>  If you stop using the home as your main home, all remaining annual installments become due on the return for the year that happens. This includes situations where the main home becomes a vacation home or is converted to business or rental property. There are special rules for involuntary conversions.  Taxpayers are urged to consult a professional to determine the tax consequences of an involuntary conversion.<br>  If you sell your home, all remaining annual installments become due on the return for the year of sale. The repayment is limited to the amount of gain on the sale, if the home is sold to an unrelated taxpayer. If there is no gain or if there is a loss on the sale, the remaining annual installments may be reduced or even eliminated. Taxpayers are urged to consult a professional to determine the tax consequences of a sale.<br>  If you transfer your home to your spouse, or, as part of a divorce settlement, to your former spouse, that person is responsible for making all subsequent installment payments.|`|AA11284831	An interest-free loan is pointless?  Really??  You do realize that the interest on a 15 year signature loan with a 2 year deferment on the first payment would work out to between $7,000 and $8,500.  That's interest that you would NOT be paying.  And unlike most below-market-rate loans you won't even pay tax on the imputed interest.<br>  <br>  While it's not as good a deal as the $8k real credit for purchases in 2009 is of course, calling it "pointless" is rather, well, POINTLESS.  <br>  <br>  Tell ya what.  You take the $7,500 credit and give it to me.  I'll cover the $500 payments AND give you a $50 kicker each year for your troubles.  No?  Hmmm...  Oh well, I tried!

Merely earning $12k doesn't in and of itself mean that you provided more than half of your own support.  What you did with that $12k is a BIG part of the equation.  See the support worksheet on page 20 of IRS Pub 501 <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p501.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p501.pdf</a> to see if you provided more than half of your own support.<br>  <br>  If you are age 19 or over and were NOT a full time student in 2008 then you cannot be claimed as a dependent because of your income.|`|4VsUKjQGaa	The question is who paid more than half of your support?  Support means your share of the fair market rent, the utilities, the groceries, your medical expenses, your education expenses (not counting scholarships), your clothing, transportation, entertainment...everything except savings.  If you provided more than half, then they cannot claim you.<br>  <br>  If you provided less than half, then it depends on your age, whether you're a student, whether you lived with them.  If you are under 19 or a student (and under 24), then they probably can.  Being away at school counts as living with them unless you have completely abandoned their home, changed your driver's license, your car registration, your voter registration, your medical insurance, everything.  If you are 19 or over (24 if you're a student), then they cannot claim you since you made more than $3,500 for the year.|`|7lmtBhdMaa	How old are you. If you aren't 18 you can't claim yourself..

AlJrVK8Gaa	The ATM fee is a convince or a transaction fee.  When you use another bank's ATM, the transaction has to go through a third party service that re-routs the money from your account to the bank that you got the money from.  That third party company charges a fee, and that is what you are paying.<br>  <br>  The fee that lenders charge is a processing fee.  They charge you this for 2 reasons.  First, the bank has to research on you and your credit, which costs them money, whether they give you the loan or not.  Secondly, the fee encourages only serious applications, so that they are not wasting their time and money.|`|dAjYPMg2aa	A bloody liberty!

You cant claim the gift money since they are not a charity with legal tax status of being one. So it does not lower your amount of income, you spent your money the way you wanted too. IF they filed, they could owe taxes on it possibly, why would you want them to owe up to half of it in taxes.|`|4VsUKjQGaa	If it was a gift, they do not need to report it.<br>  <br>  Did $800/mo cover more than half the support for ONE of them?  If so, perhaps you should claim one of them as a dependent.  The rules that you'd have to meet:<br>  <br>  a)  Be related to him or her<br>  b)  Pay more than half of the support for him or her<br>  c)  HE or SHE cannot make more than $3,500 (not counting social security)<br>  <br>  If you can claim one of them, then a quirk in the tax law may let you claim head of household (assuming you're single) as well.  If you provide more than half the cost of maintaining the home lived in by a dependent parent, then you can file as head-of-household.|`|moiMSUYYaa	Are they going to file a tax return?

Now, however, the U.S. economy is sinking faster than anyone thought possible, and respected economic authorities are suggesting that temporary bank nationalization, once the domain of Third World basket cases, could be the best solution.<br>  <br>  "It may be necessary to temporarily nationalize some banks in order to facilitate a swift and orderly restructuring," Greenspan, the long-revered sage of free-market theory, told London's Financial Times in an interview published Wednesday. "I understand that once in a hundred years this is what you do."<br>  <br>  When Bernanke was asked whether he shared his predecessor's views, he didn't distance himself from them during a question session Wednesday at the National Press Club. He answered as if nationalization were inevitable, after first listing some of the problems it would entail.<br>  <br>  "Well, I think as a general rule, it's very challenging for governments to manage banks for a protracted period. And there's the additional problem that if you have a government-run institution, that you tend to lose the franchise value, that the counterparties and others don't want to deal with you because they don't know your future," Bernanke said. "So I think whatever actions may need to be taken at one point or another, I think there's a very strong commitment on the part of the administration to try to return banks or keep banks private or return them to private hands as quickly as possible."<br>  <br>  The term "nationalization" conjures images of the communist Soviet Union or corrupt Latin American dictatorships, but advocates of nationalizing U.S. banks envision a seizure of big banks on the grounds that they're already insolvent except for some accounting sleight of hand.<br>  <br>  Banks are sitting on trillions of dollars worth of complex securities, backed by U.S. mortgages that are going into default as more and more homes are now worth less than the mortgages on them. If banks were forced to put present-day values on these securities instead of hold-to-maturity values, their liabilities would far exceed their assets. They'd be insolvent.<br>  <br>  What's needed, nationalization advocates argue, is for the government to seize Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and other large banks, carve out their bad assets, then break them into smaller pieces for quick sale to the private sector.<br>  <br>  "Nationalization is the only option that would permit us to solve the problem of toxic assets in an orderly fashion and finally allow lending to resume," Nouriel Roubini, a prominent New York University economist, wrote in an opinion piece Feb. 15 in The Washington Post. "Of course, the economy would still stink, but the death spiral we are in would end."<br>  <br>  Other analysts think that nationalization is all but inevitable.<br>  <br>  "It's very hard when you get to this point not to do that," said Adam Posen, the deputy director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a free-market research center. Posen thinks that nationalization is losing its stigma, and he envisions scenarios in which the government could seize the nation's 50 largest banks.<br>  <br>  Most depositors would be safe, since their deposits are insured up to $250,000. Stockholders probably would be wiped out, and bondholders eventually would get shares of any new company. The government could even make money on some seizures, if history is any guide.<br>  <br>  Roubini and Posen think that a bold, drastic step is inescapable, and that a failure to take it now would only make it costlier and more difficult later. Today's problem is the $1.2 trillion in assets whose underlying collateral is shoddy sub-prime mortgages, which have eroded faith in the broader U.S. housing market.<br>  <br>  Tomorrow's problems go far beyond housing.<br>  <br>  "Another $7 trillion - including commercial real estate loans, consumer credit-card debt and high-yield bonds and leveraged loans - is at risk of losing much of its value," Roubini wrote. "Then there are trillions more in high-grade corporate bonds and loans and jumbo prime mortgages, whose worth will also drop precipitously as the recession deepens and more firms and households default on their loans and mortgages."<br>  <br>  Translation: Address the problem of today's toxic assets or|`|xe2FpSbiaa	Thomas Jefferson The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not. <br>  <br>  Thomas Jefferson I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them. <br>   <br>  In light of the present financial crisis, it's  interesting to read what Thomas Jefferson said in 1802:<br>  <br>  Banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered. <br>  <br>  this next part is me:<br>  When the government controls everything about money, there will nothing they do not control.|`|MbzyriZ4aa	That would mean that they would really have to open up those books and explain what is going on... not a good idea when the banks are still busy covering up their losses with the bail out money...|`|chPwS1BIaa	i dunno but i do kno that th govt will own most of the banks in th us and it will be stricter regulations for all of us now|`|ELUvm4Liaa	One falls, they all fall.

The only way for you to claim him is with a completed form giving you permission to claim him, signed by her.  Since you don't have this you are SOL.  If you are friend, ask her how much money it will save her to claim him.  If it saved you more, offer to reimburse her for what she loses by not claiming him.  If you can't work anything out, amend your return and repay the money.|`|AA11284831	She can only surrender that permission in writing, using Form 8332 or a similarly worded written statement that you must attach to your return.

nzQw5jqXaa	First you have to instruct the broker to liquidate the amount. It takes 3 business days for the funds to clear if securities need to be sold. Secondly, in the meantime you have to submit signed documents to the broker indicating that you want the money. You should also advise whether you want to withhold some money for taxes. If you fill the papers out you probably could get the money in about 5 days.|`|MbzyriZ4aa	10% is just the "penalty" you will also have to pay taxes on it on your Tax Returns next year.<br>  <br>  If you are with a legit firm it will only take a couple of days to have the funds transferred into your account.|`|6aaCfPJiaa	ok|`|tdQTZPI7aa	3 business days  But remember that money also has to be reported on next years return as income.

If you need to sell stock first, you might need to wait for the sale to settle, which would take a few extra days.  Normally they won't withhold taxes if you ask them not to.

DAMZKbpDaa	The penalty for the person claiming the son "fraudulently" is they have to give the money back, plus penalty and interest if they don't do it by April 15. The IRS usually pursues civil penalties rather than criminal penalties in most cases because it is more cost effective.<br>  <br>  Additionally, if the IRS believes that the person who claimed your son did so deliberately, as opposed to by accident, they could be barred from the earned income tax credit in the future.<br>  <br>  Mail in your return on paper, and you will receive your money, because you have the evidence that your son lived with you, they don't.|`|UTto3fJvaa	for two years I got a letter from irs saying that more than one person was claiming the same ss# and if it was not me than to ignore notice. Well it wasn`t me but I had enough. I called the number and said I got this notice etc. She was snotty and short saying why call if wasn`t me. I ignored her and told her it was my ex-husband and the kids were mine. (he had done this while married so i knew) told he did more than once. She said basically fine. Within year they went back on all his tax returns and he is paying for what he did. Even though I was suppose to ignore. I called anyways and have never had a problem again|`|dekrghC8aa	It is quite possibe the other person did not do it intentionally and maybe the handwriting was of poor quality or just a couple of numbers transposed.

As far as what that will do to your credit rating, I don't know, but of course it will ding. <br>  <br>  First piece of advice is to STOP USING THE CARD if you haven't already. You don't live and die by your credit rating, unless of course you follow Suze Orman's advice.

For example, the formula would be "=Max(1000, 3% x  gross income).
XHhJ8ffRaa	If you are being audited by the IRS about the dependents and you have no rights to claim them, the IRS will have you pay back all tax benefits you gained from claiming the kids PLUS penalties and interests. This is only the best case. You will most likely be banned from claiming the Earned Income Credit for the next 10 years. The IRS may also post a fine on top of everything. The worst case is of course charging you of tax fraud. Not fun at all. You do know that the IRS is one of the worst US government departments to mess with right?|`|DAMZKbpDaa	Your main penalty is you will have to give the money back. If you do it before April 15, 2009, you will avoid penalty and interest.<br>  <br>  If the IRS thinks you did it deliberately, rather than, say, an accident or ignorance, you may be barred from the earned income tax credit in the future.<br>  <br>  If you have no money or job, what advantage is there to claiming kids? Was there some other refund fraud going on, like claiming fictitious income to claim the EIC? Or fictitious withholding? If so, you may be in more serious trouble. If they are investigating you for fraud, get a lawyer, NOT a CPA or EA (even though they would be better choices for doing taxes). The reason is a lawyer has client/lawyer immunity; a CPA or EA can be forced to testify against you.|`|AA10091923	first ---SKIP the audit and file a 1040X...an amended return.<br>  <br>  do this asap and send it off asap.....this should save your a...<br>  <br>  good luck  :)|`|Saul1Bhuaa	Here's the scoop.  Worst-case scenario:  You've filed a false tax return, so you're facing criminal charges that could lead to both a hefty fine and imprisonment.<br>  <br>  More likely-case scenario:  You will be hit with a revised tax bill, plus interest, plus a 25% penalty.  (If this is all that happens to you, be very, very, very, very, very happy)|`|aLZKicieaa	Go to a tax professional -- if you can't afford a CPA, look for an enrolled agent, they should be able to help you out.

RQvLrKMXaa	I opted to draw at 62.  Lost about 10.00 per month in doing so, no big deal.|`|9Br8ZY69aa	It use to be a no brainer, as people did not live as long.   However, times are changing, people live longer and well to be quite frank, we have serious financial problems in this country.  So now the best thing to consider is what would life be like if you had to live on the lesser amount for many years.  If you have other investments or a pension to make up a good part of your retirement income, then taking it early might make sense.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	Withdrawing at 62, and you receive a lower lifetime benefit. HOWEVER, there's an interesting fact -- if you change your mind at say, age 65, then you can make this adjustment.  You will need to repay all of the social security benefit payments you have received from age 62, and then you can start fresh at age 65.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	I plan to draw at age 62 instead of waiting until 67 (my normal retirement age). Simply file for benefits about 6 months ahead of time. Your benefit could be reduce by about 1/3 or more if you take early retirement benefits.

kho74FORaa	I think you meant he had a balloon payment due. This is a payment that is usually the balance of any more monies due at the time of paying off a note. For instance, say you borrowed 200,000 dollars and made payments for 10 years at 5% simple interest. Your total payments over the term of the loan didn't cover the entire cost or value of the loan once the time either expired or you decided to pay it off at a earlier time frame. The balloon payment would be that amount agreed by in contract of the original loan. This is usually done for reasons of giving lower rate of interest over a longer period of time to keep the payments manageable. When you do sell or want to pay this off or when the time comes that the loan is now due, the full remaining amount left is due in one lump sum including any unpaid interest. This is what gets people in trouble over the long haul of these type of loans. They seem to think that they will be making more money or things will somehow change in favor that they can afford this lump sum when the time comes. It is all so often when they cannot and loose everything that they put into the loan to purchase what they wanted. Cars, homes, whatever are then taken back by the person or institution that made the money available to them in the first place and have nothing to show for all the payments they made during the time of the loan. They might as well of just leased or rented.|`|acwqlfPUaa	A long-term loan, often a mortgage, that has one large payment (the balloon payment) due upon maturity. A balloon note will often have the advantage of very low interest payments, thus requiring very little capital outlay during the life of the loan. Since most of the repayment is deferred until the end of the payment period, the borrower has substantial flexibility to utilize the available capital during the life of the loan. The major problem with such a loan is that the borrower needs to be self-disciplined in preparing for the large single payment, since interim payments are not being made. Balloon notes are often undertaken when refinancing or when a major cash flow event is anticipated. also called bullet loan or balloon loan|`|eACZ1Rhjaa	A balloon mortgage has to be paid off at the end of a term when you still owe most of the money. <br>  <br>  So if I sold you my house and carried the paper I might give you a mortgage amortized over 30 years but due at the end of 7 years. So you need to refinance to pay me off or sell the house. It the markets are hot you might not have a problem but if your credit is bad, the house value is down or you took a second mortgage I might just need to foreclose to get my money.

eZKmubDBaa	The first question I would ask is "Can you pay me back? "
dPLkNRNuaa	I second what mbrcratz said.    I don't know where you are right now. But the insurance job market is pretty tight right now. There are a lot of experienced appraisers that have been laid off that are having a hard time finding a job.   There is a difference between an "appraiser" and an "adjuster".     The appraiser just writes estimates (usually on damaged cars). Auto Appraisers are usually former body shop owners/managers that leave the shop and come over to writing estimates for insurance companies.    It's probably one of the best jobs to have in the claims business. So there is very little turn over.     Adjusters handle the entire claim. They investigate, negotiate, deny/settle the claim. There are different types of adjusters. There is more turn over for adjusters than appraisers.    Is being an adjuster a good job? Yes. But it's hard and not for every one.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	If you already have a job offer from a local auto dealership or body shop or insurance company, it's fine.

But, let's be clear because it's more expensive so the question begs why you would want to be part of a group?|`|dRezbY31aa	There are none.     First off, group policies as a rule are more expensive than individual policies. Most people don't see this because the employer usually picks up a good percentage of the premium.    There are some companies that advertise "group" plans but this is just a marketing gimmick. These plans are individual plans and for most people are no cheaper than those companies that do not use this gimmick. There are also some companies that have associations that you must join to get on the policy. Again, this is just a gimmick and in my opinion have no real benefit for most people.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	You can't do this any more - it was a strategy about 10 years ago, but what happened was only the unhealthy people would join the group, which would skew the rates upwards, and the more healthier of those would drop out.      Group insurance works, because the healthy people subsidize the unhealthy ones.  Voluntary groups, it didn't happen that way.  Only the most unhealthy people ended up in the groups.|`|CKPMkfvfaa	A company with 2 or more employees that has been in business for at least 7 weeks.|`|3107eff81e034f42c46260a7949042b8aa	If it were only that easy.  You can get a job with any employer who offers health insurance and qualify for group coverage.  If you are self-employed, and can prove it with tax documents, you can, in some states, be your own group.    Best bet is to contact a local agent who specializes in health insurance.  Rules vary from state-to-state.    Your experience with health insurance is a misconception.  Group rates are higher, if you are a small group because it is guaranteed issue.  The reason it seemed lower is because most employers contribute to the cost of the insurance.  You may have only been paying half the premium, or less.      Individual and group insurance work the same, in that the doctor will accept the negotiated rate for the service and you cannot be "balance billed" for the difference.  It is not something specific to a group health plan.    Given that you are healthy and nearing retirement, I would recommend looking into an individual high deductible health plan, and open a health savings account.  This will allow you to put money away on a tax-advantaged basis to pay for any medical expenses that may arise, but any money you put into the account that is not used becomes a qualified retirement account at age 65.    Again, a local agent is your best bet.|`|15680cab74617a2ab2a60cccd198ec9eaa	What state are you in? In California, a company of 2 or more qualifies for group health insurance.

vCePK8gMaa	Not only should you let the landlord know, you should call the police. <br>  <br>  The landlady cannot take action against the offending tenants without undeniable proof.

DorePwVOaa	23 months. I used a credit card payoff calculator, but a loan is a loan (and a credit card is a loan!), so it works on pretty much the same principles.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	If you specifically designate the extra $250 to be applied to the principal ONLY, you will pay your car off sooner and save a lot of money in interest. I can't tell you how much sooner without seeing a amortization schedule that reflects the extra being applied to the principal. When a payment goes directly to reduce the principal, the interest you pay is less and with additional extra payments the principal will get lower and more of your regular payment will go to principal too because of the reduced interest. I hope that wasn't confusing.  Just be certain the lender is applying the extra money to the principal only.|`|IUQzWrb7aa	$5500. divided by $250 per month = 22 months, which is not much different than the current payments of $231.67, (23.74 months)

You will have to put it in a money market to get it monthly  If you put it in a CD then it will be a 6 month or 12 month before you get the interest.  If you live within your means then 2 million will be more than enough to live off..  That is what separate the rich from wealthy, the rich earn money, the wealthy let there money earn money|`|8xDOEr63aa	Very few banks award sufficient interest to overcome the corrosive power of inflation which averages 3.5 to 4 percent per year. That means if you are getting the typical 2 percent interest on a CD or savings account your money is losing about 1.5 to 2 percent of value per year in those accounts.     Add to that the decreasing balance of you living off the principle and you won't be wealthy for long.    By and large, the wealthy build their wealth by investing regularly in mutual funds and real estate which have an average return that is much better than inflation. A good mutual fund will get you about 10 percent annual yield.    As anyone knows after the past 12 months, such investments come with very real risk. But over the long term they are vastly superior over CDs, savings and money market accounts.     The benefit of savings account and CD's is they are very low-risk and usually FDIC insured, but their reward is insufficient to beat inflation and generate new wealth. It's really only good for money you will need very soon, not long-term investing.|`|qWaYbxcxaa	People of high wealth don't put all their money in basic savings accounts or CD's.    One would be taxed on the interest gained each year, which right now banks are paying between 0 to 1% on savings account.     At 1% that is $20,000 a year in interest before state and federal taxes - hardly enough to live on, unless this millionaire lives in a trailer or has no mortgage and lives nowhere near water (ocean).    The wealthy stay rich by NOT quitting work. Name any billionaire of any age who has stopped working?    The wealthy often keep money in US Treasuries, tax free bonds (often municipal tax free bonds), real estate, and depending on their age, and over all wealth picture, many still like to make a buck in the stock market and in private investments (hedge funds, private equity).    Those who inherit wealth, as opposed to being the creator of wealth are often a different type of person. There are exceptions, but that is another question.    $2MM is nothing to shake a stick at, but it is not really "wealthy" by today's standards.

One elderly guy retired, the next partnership broke up years after I was gone, two software companies went out of business then I was fired from a company.

I hope to retire from this one so I never have to explain why I don't have references again.<br>  <br>  With the recession many will be in your shoes so companies will understand.

AA11313555	Student Loans are pretty flexible, in that they will work something out in order to get some money, rather than getting nothing. I would contact the Loan holders and see what your options are. Explain to them the situation. I have found the people and systems associated with numerous Student Loan programs to be pretty flexible.|`|Hs62xbSbaa	Wow, are these private loans or Federal student loans?  Fed loans should have a lower interest rate than that.  Mine hovers somewhere around 4%.  I would just try to negotiate a forbearance and pay the $50 a month payment.  You can do this for up to ten years.  Remember, consolidation is only helpful if you have multiple loans.    For private loans (those held by private banks and companies other than the U.S. Department of Education, such as Subsidized and unsubsidized student loans) you may have no choice but to pay the monthly payment.  Check with your student loan provider.  I know one of mine has insurance built in, that if I cannot pay my monthly loan payment, this insurance kicks in, pays the balance, and then the insurance would take payments out of my paycheck.    I really hope these are Federal loans and that you are able to use forbearance.  Otherwise, with the recent credit crunch you are going to find that lenders want their money.|`|hmkz7Kp6aa	I Actually just delt with this situation and the lenders are usually very nice about it.

It's your home and the only way out is to sell the home and dis-place your aunt.    realtor.sailor|`|yHl7RIuOaa	So you have signed a promissory note to a bank promising to repay a loan.  And now you want to tell the bank you changed your mind and no longer wish to promise to repay the loan.    I think you can understand why the bank is not going to allow that.    If the property was deeded to you (you are the sole owner of property) then you can sell the property and you can pay off the note that way.  If you are sole individual on the deed then you do not need your Aunt's permission to sell the property. If your Aunt or her husband remain as co owners of the property they will have to agree to sell the house and co sign the deed at the closing transferring title to the buyer..

J5zj8dWRaa	I'm one of Those People that suck it up and show up even when I'm sick, especially since I'm the Office Manager (and the only non-salesperson working here).  I've haven't missed a day because of sickness, though I have taken my vacation days to get the hell out of Dodge for a while.  Even those are planned at least a week ahead.    You have to give everyone else advance notice that they need to pick up the slack, and do your work as well as their own.  When you are deathly ill and have to miss work, you should call HR, your boss, or whoever-is-in-charge the night before.  I get extremely annoyed if anyone calls up in the morning expecting me to be sympathetic (or worse, e-mails in that they're sick).  That's true even if they always show up on time/early for work, and stay late/don't skip out early.    Unless you're running to the bathroom every 5 minutes, are certifiably contagious, or have a high fever, take some medicine and stick it out.  Be "dedicated" and a "hard worker" who is worth their paycheck.  It's much better to go in and have the boss send you home than to call in for every little stomach twinge.  You do that, you're considered "lazy" or "a hypochondriac" (or other terms that aren't accepted by Y/A), and are fodder for the chopping block.|`|Td2G075Eaa	I missed only one day in four years due to illness.

Two times in a half year doesn't sound excessive to me....especially if you've called in to warn then or had a very good excuse.  Your job is pretty important and it needs to be covered, but things happen that we just can't help.  I think if you cover all your bases so the boss doesn't think you're taking advantage of him or abusing his good will, you'll be fine.  JMHO.|`|QikvnTnqaa	I'm a waitress and I've worked at two different chains of the same restaurant (moved). I worked at the first one for 4 1/2 months and was late once (my car broke down and then the person that was giving me a ride car did too-that was amazing). And I called in once because my house burned down. I went back to work the next day because, lets face it, it sucked, but I needed the money.    At the second chain I've been late once (was getting my tattoo touched up and it took a little longer then expected and I was ten min late). And I called in once because I was WAY sick, I usually go to work sick.    So in over a year I've called in twice and been late twice. But everyone knows they can count on me at work. That's why I always try to make it into work. :)|`|0fb9cfa7afed23044f4b019f2438ba2baa	You should always show up for your job unless you are unable to (you are too sick or emergency) or you have vacation or personal time to take. Whenever possible you should give notice - schedule in advance things like checking into school and use a vacation or personal day. If you don't have anytime to take then you should see if it is alright with your boss to arrange an unpaid day off. If you are too sick to go to work then you should notify your job as soon as possible before your start time. If you go to the Doctor it is a good idea to get a note to take to work so that your boss knows that you are honest about it.    In general I would say that you should not miss more that 2 occurrences per year that are not scheduled. Most jobs have an employee manual that lays out what they expect. (When I say occurrence it is because lets say you were sick and missed 2 days, but had a dr. note - I think of that as 1)    It does depend on the type of job sometimes. In your case if you are the only receptionist your not being there puts your responsibilities on other people. Which means it is going to cause issue with others if you are not there often.    Being early is a good idea regardless of your absences. It lets them know you are reliable and dependable and will help you out when they are considering your attendance. Good-Luck.|`|jVkdaV8aaa	It's usually acceptable to have 60 hours of sick time during a calender year but, you have only been there for 6 months,so your probably on someones crude list right now. I suggest not getting sick for a least 8 months to get off that list.The economy stinks right now and they fully realize they can get someone to replace you easily. If your thinking that your showing up early and on time will be taken into the equation. Think again, it won't be. That's not to say they don't care, because if you show up late too many times you'll be terminated to. All employers want a employee that shows up on time and report to work when scheduled. Instead right now for six months you have displayed you cannot be counted on. The main reasons are because you have'nt  been working there for 10 or more years. if you have been that then would be taken into factor. you have been there for 6 months that doesn't sit well with supervisors.

y4SUDnpaaa	If this is a joint account under both your names the money is equally available to either of you no matter who deposited the money. There would be no point in taking her to  Small Claims Court even with proof you are the one who put money in the account it makes no difference when it is a joint account...........check with your bank. Also you cannot  remove her name from the account without her permission........you can also check that with the bank. You can open up another account under just your name and make your deposits into it. The only snag is the account with the overdraft will have to be made whole before you can open a second account. You can tell your ex that you will not be making any more deposits into that account and hopefully she will stop writing bad checks. I think if I were you I would go to the bank, settle up the overdraft, and explain the situation to them. Maybe there is some way they can put a hold on that joint account or even close it since there is no money in it for either of you to withdrawal.....I hope for your sake they will. It sounds like your ex will make as much trouble for you as she can.

Legally, if one or the other does something to the account, no matter if positive or negative, you both or individually are responsible.  So, if she don't pay, they will be coming after you.  I would pay the money to the bank (or at least make payment arrangements to pay it as a gesture of good faith), keep all the receipts and statements of your transactions, then take her to small claims for the amount you had to pay and maybe a lil more ;)  Depends what state you are in.

If the amount of data is small you could even compromise by supplying the credit  card size CDs.    I would say do both, for the important potential clients.  There is little reason why the CD cannot be used visually [apart from printing costs]|`|qaD1jAQYaa	I don't even bother keeping cd's I'm not fully interested in.

Ch9TedMcaa	To rise?    Stock prices rise when more people are buying the stock, and vice versa when people are selling.|`|Mn1mODPzaa	You'll hear many people say supply and demand, but that does not explain the fluctuating price movements between a range of prices.    It is really all about perceived value. All the investors in a companies stock take a look at all the available data that they consider relevant and then decide how much they believe the stock is worth.    This is why stocks typically trade within a range, trading between a high (resistance) and a low (support). When a stock reaches the high range, people/traders re-evaluate the perceived value of the stock...if nothing significantly has changed to make the perceived value higher, then the stock will start to sell off.    The opposite happens at support, i.e. as the stock approaches support people/traders evaluate the perceived value of the stock and if nothing has changed then they start buying because they perceive the stock to be priced at it's lower range.    When this perception changes, usually due to some news event, is when these ranges break and the stock starts to trade higher or lower than the range previously defined.    Steve J.

(And technically the child doesn't receive ANY money -- the child's parents do.)|`|Hs62xbSbaa	You have not provided enough information in which to answer.  What State are you in?  Is anyone in the household working?  How many children and how big is your family?  All these questions will affect your answer.      Generally Welfare does not give out money to families, unless you receive TANF: http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/tanf...    Most local welfare (Social Services) agencies will help with food stamps and may even be able to make utility payments for you, and get you health insurance.  However, unless you are getting TANF or assistance from your State, I do not see how you would get any cash.  Wisconsin for instance does participate in TANF and also has what is called the W-2 program (help those on aid obtain a job, and pay them while they do it).  These programs load money right on to the recipients Wisconsin Quest card, which can be used at an ATM.  The Quest card is the Wisconsin equivalent to food stamps.

RcAofGkIaa	Unemployment benefits are administered by the State that you live in, Department of Labor.  If you have been found eligible for unemployment benefits, any action you take against your employer is pretty much separate from your benefits.  I suppose you could really put your foot in it by filing the complaint before you have been determined eligible, or making statements in your complaint that would affect your eligibility.  Remember, in order to be eligible for unemployment you have to meet some criteria:  1. You were separated from your employment through no fault of your own.  2. You are able to work.  3. You are willing to work.    If you quit your job, but say you have adequate reason, that becomes quite difficult to prove.|`|AA12071655	Of course you can. Employers pay into the unemployment fund but after that it is under the State's control.|`|Hs62xbSbaa	Yes, Federal law states that an employer cannot retaliate on an employee for these types of actions.  For instance, say a worker called OSHA to report a violation.  Is it legal for that company to fire the worker?  The answer is no.    Unemployment comes from the State you reside in.  Your employer merely pays into an unemployment account.  If your employer has already verified with UI that you have been terminated and you are receiving benefits, having your company go back and say you weren't fired for whatever reason would look bad on their part.  So no matter what you would still continue to receive unemployment benefits.      Here is a link that may help:  http://employeeissues.com/wrongful_termi...    As you can see from the information on that page, no matter how unfair you think it is there is probably nothing that you can do.  Best of luck to you.  I would start by researching the procedure for your State in regards to filing a complaint against an employer.  Believe it or not, a lot of States have a Department just for this issue.  Unemployment Insurance, Department of Labor, the States Department of Commerce.  So may avenues to explore...
eulMjLtPaa	Depends on your marital status, number of dependents if any, if you're a dependent of anyone else, and any other income you (or a spouse) have. Also depends if you are considered an independent contractor or not.    If you're working for an employer, are single with no dependents, last year you could earn $8200 before you even had to file. Anything under that you wouldn't owe taxes. You'd still get a W-2 from your employer at the end of the year showing your income and any withholding. If anything was withheld for income taxes, you would still want to file to get that money back. You might also be eligible for something called the Earned Income Credit which is a program that gives additional money to low income people who are working - if you don't file, you don't get that.|`|AA11284831	Depends upon many factors:    1.  Filing status  2.  Source of income  3.  Dependency status    See IRS Pub 501 for a complete discussion on filing requirements.

In most cases, there is a minimum to be required to file and if you make less than that amount, filing is optional.  However, that amount is not the same for everyone and depends on your marital status and whether another person is eligible to claim you as a dependent.    Under certain circumstances, there is no minimum and you must file regardless of how much or how little you made.|`|a78860b2cdf2c89664191c16471d2353aa	Read 2008 filing requirements for most taxpayers http://taxipay.blogspot.com/2008/10/2008...

47a13fa1a46c4511dc92b72ffaee1a6baa	Most people received an "Economic Stimulus Payment" last year.. ($600 per individual, $1200 per couple and $300 each child...).. However <br>  Some people may not have received it or didn't get the full amount they were entitled to in 2008 (it was based on your 2007 status/income) example if a child was born in 2008 and they weren't around in 2007 to get the stimulus payment they would be entitled to the "Recovery Rebate Credit",, A credit the Government has created "The Recovery Rebate Credit" which will be given to  people who have not received their entitlement under the stimulus plan. The "Recovery Rebate Credit" is offset by the amount of stimulus check received the prior year....  However , most tax preparation programs give everyone this credit and it must be subtracted out by entering the amount of stimulus check actually received in 2008 (based on your 2007 status/income its subtracted out on 1040 worksheet 5)... So the reason you probably didn't get the full amount you were expecting is because the IRS probably withheld your recovery rebate credit..since your stimulus check probably wasn't declared on your 2008 return..<br>  Hope that answers your  question..<br>  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=203035,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,i...</a>|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Report the IRS ?

AA11284831	Since the error was yours in not including the 1099 income when you had your return prepared you will have to pay to have the amended return prepared.

You will also have to pay any taxes that are due with the amended return.|`|f5f29f78cbffd9771950da5ad0141cafaa	Yes, you will have to pay again. To amend your return, you will be charged approx $88.

XdGjhbfMaa	I'm confused.  Are you saying that you were paying your roommate because he was on the lease and you weren't?  If that's the case the landlord can only go after him for the unpaid bills.  You're owed nothing back, since you were paying your portion of rent and utilities that you used, but as far as the landlord goes, it's your roommate that owes him, not you.<br>  <br>  If I'm wrong and you're on the lease, the landlord can hold you accountable, and thus you'd have to go after the roomie in small claims court for the money you're having to pay again because he didn't give it to the landlord.|`|PxoKseAiaa	You wouldn't get an attorney.  How much does the roommate owe you?  Or should I say, how much is the landlord going to come after YOU for the unpaid rent etc?  That is the amount you would be suing the roommate for.  Good thing you have receipts and cancelled checks to prove you were paying all along.  In court, it will be his burden to prove he paid the landlord, which, he can't because you will have eviction papers that were given to you! LOL
hQf0BwT2aa	Closing accounts is claimed to be adverse.  I closed and paid off 2 cards recently.<br>  I canceled the cards 1st and took 10 months to pay the balance.<br>  That didn't move my score. I don't know what to belive.<br>  I think because I maintained the balance for awhile may have made the difference<br>  <br>  Playing with credit cards for $30.00 incentives is NOT A WISE action..|`|XxUsLqXRaa	Wow....quite a few conflicting answers here.  When you open up a line of credit, and then quickly pay it off and cancel it, it can hurt your credit score because creditors want to see a HISTORY of your credit.  Believe it or not, they are not impressed with the fact that you paid the loan off quickly because, all that means to them, is that they might not be able to make any money off you.  People who pay off their credit balances before they have a chance to accrue any finance charges, are known (in the credit card industry) as "dead beats".  They aren't making any money from dead beats.  Creditors want to see that you have had a card for a long period of time, and that you have carried a balance but have paid it in a responsible manner.  So, yes, it will be considered as an undesirable entry onto your credit report, but likely wont affect your score by more than a point or two.  If Amazon makes you pay a yearly fee for their card, then it is worth the few lost points to go ahead and cancel it.  Otherwise, pay it off and then just chunk it in a drawer somewhere.  Keep the account open and make one or two purchases a year on it.  Even if you continue to pay them off right away, at least that may be balanced out by the length of time you've had the card.  In regards to the credit bureau, there is no way to win....no way to have a perfect score.  Any move you make can be interpreted as good or bad, and they are the ones who get to make that choice....not us.|`|2NhvZ6HRaa	Closing the account will not hurt the credit score, if it is paid in full.<br>  <br>  Better check the fine print.

G07o0cHPaa	When people give you money advice, take a good look at their financial situation, past, present, and future.  But sometimes it's not all bad.  Even people who have been or are in or are going in financial trouble, there are still lessons to be learned.  But as far as the emergency stash of cash and having savings, that is extremely important.  You just never know what's going to happen.  I watched the Suze Orman Show, a professional financial advisor.  She says you should have six months of savings you know you can live on.  I would agree with that.  Even if you have plenty of money on your paychecks, you're still living paycheck-to-paycheck if you never save and that just opens up new problems.  It would be great to open up a savings account in a financially strong bank especially in today's times.  Put six months of money in that account and just don't touch it.  Savings accounts also make you money.  You get an interest rate on savings accounts, and at the end of the year the bank puts money into that account based on its interest rate.  On top of that, if you aren't making much, it would be a good idea to save up for a month before you actually move.  This would be money you'd plan on spending.  It would just give a nice headstart.|`|iXgZHsXsaa	The best to invest money in your education and 401K that the best ways I think you should save your money.<br>  good luck!

kho74FORaa	Need more information. What state do you live in? Why won't he answer the phone? Do you have a lease or contract with the renter? Most of the time if the problem is going to cause severe damage to the structure and the landlord is unavailable in a 24 hour period, you have the right to call and have the situation appraised as to the cost of repairing. Also, you want to get a short statement from the appraiser as to what harm or what other problems will arise from not getting the problem fixed in a timely manner. ie: the leak may become more ruptured and flood the entire basement causing more damage to the structure, personal property etc. Most case the appraiser will be happy to do this and makes wonderful testimony in court if it comes to a future problem with any suit against you. One other question, is the landlord also occupy a portion of the building that you reside? Strange that he won't answer his phone. I bet he does when the rent is due!|`|440b5eeaa808017d23fb3beb1ec4fa73aa	I'm not sure if the landlord is required to reimburse you or not, because if he does his own repairs you might have a hard time getting the money out of him. You could check you lease.<br>  <br>  In the mean time, you could also put a bucket under where it's leaking, so if it's not that bad maybe that will hold until you get a hold of him. You could also look for a shut off valve that would turn off the water that would go to that pipe, but that means you would lose water to whatever that whole line feeds.

eACZ1Rhjaa	Save your money to buy something like a car or major piece of furniture then go to the place that sells it and offer more than 50% down and even as much as 90% down and pay it off in 3 monthly payments. That will go on your credit report, make sure first that they report to the agencies.<br>  Another way is a secured card at your bank. You deposit money in an account that is more than your credit limit. They have fees and low limits so the fees use up most of your limit. Pay it in full the as soon as you get it then pay in full once a month, Don't use more than 30% of your limit so you may not be able to buy more than a tank of gas with it.<br>  Then wait a year using it most months and ask the bank for a real credit card that isn't secured. Continue to pay in full each month and barely use it. No need to be in debt just to have credit.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	See if your bank has an account that offers a debit card with it.  The debit card is actually a visa card and, when you make purchases with it, you use it just as you would any other credit card.  In fact, when you go to Walmart and swipe it in their checkout machine, rather than enter it in as "debit" you enter it in as 'credit".  Be aware though, that (unlike an actual credit card) the money is immediately wired from your checking account to Walmart, and doesnt just build up like it does with a real credit card.  The benefit to having this card is that you get to use it as a stepping stone to applying for more credit cards.  Once creditors see that you have a "credit" card, they are more apt to grant you their own credit card.  Sometimes you have to resort to applying for a card that makes you pay a yearly fee, but it's worth it to hang onto it for about a year and apply for more fee-less cards in the process.  Then cancel that card.  But be careful....I used to get offers for a card that had a yearly fee, a documentation fee, a one-time new member fee, an account processing fee, and a whole bunch of other fees that sounded like they were all basically the same thing.  I figured it out that, before I even would get to use the card for the first time, I would already owe $240.  And the spending limit was only $300.  If I went over the limit, there were even more fees!!  Even if a late fee put me over the limit, I would have also been charged on over-the-limit fee.  Be sure to read the fine print.  Credit cards can ruin a persons credit rating in NO time but, if used properly, they can also raise the score.|`|Poht8MR9aa	If you are  still in school and work you can open a checking account as a "student account" and after you have been there a while and have not had any overdrafts you can apply for a small credit card. You have to get something in your name, and your parents should be able to help you like a cell phone, that you pay for. Its hard to get started maybe you can try and talk to someone at the bank and ask them what they would suggest.<br>  Bottom line you need to get some of those bills that you pay to your parents in your name.|`|lzTOlaqiaa	Maybe start with getting a cell phone under your name. Since your credit isnt that good, theyll probably ask you for a deposit but its good so you can get better credit and depending on the provider, youll get your money back with interest. (As far I know AT&T keeps it for a year and gives you interest back also) When I was 17 I got my first credit card, what I did was just change my year of birth and they gave me a $200 credit limit. (It was with Credit one Bank) You should look it up online, maybe you can get one with them. The only other thing I can tell you is dont use up all the credit.|`|t0VJFXNSaa	Get your hands on some bills for your self,<br>  <br>  And apply for a secured credit card with a low limit like.... 500$<br>  If its secured, then if you flake out, they can still pay it. IT will hurt your credit bad. Buts its the only way ot start.<br>  <br>  Unless you wanted to try for a student visa.<br>  Just stay away from bank of America.<br>  They are a shaky bank :]<br>  <br>  ( 2 years with them, And really regret it. )|`|hsEAdTw8aa	Apply for a low credit credit card where you don't have to have a credit rating. Everyone has to start somewhere without a credit rating. See the site below for help.
e6jrBORRaa	Yes, you can tell your bank to stop the bill collector from taking out money from your account.  The bank will charge you a stop payment fee, though.  <br>  <br>  Send a letter to the collection company telling them you would prefer to send payments and tell them not to take money out of your account anymore.  If they continue to do so, you can sue them.  (Wouldn't that be fun!)  <br>  <br>  Be sure the letter is certified with delivery notification so you know they got it.  <br>  <br>  By the way, I just had to do this myself.  It worked.  :-)  I actually called the bank because I thought they would have to change my account number, but they told me doing a stop payment would suffice.  OH, make sure you do it with enough notice:  For my bank it took 4 days processing time to do the stop payment.  Some banks don't take so long.|`|d36OrpbDaa	if MommyMe's answer doesn't work, then change your account number.  Just transfer your funds to the new account.  You should tell your bank why, though - tell them that a company may be attempting to make unauthorized withdrawals on your account, and you want to prevent it from happening.

WYjbuu6saa	Well, it wasn't because you wanted to get a job when you are done with your studies.<br>  <br>  Warning!  Jobs in the field of Law are drying up FAST!!  This is NOT a good field to invest in!!  Why?  Many reasons.  Main reason?.....We simply have WAY TOO MANY Lawyers - we have a GLUT of Attorneys!!!<br>  <br>  Which means.....even IF you finish your schooling, you won't be able to find a job when you are done - the jobs just aren't there.<br>  <br>  The law schools know this - the law schools know the economy is SATURATED, but they continue to churn out graduates.  Why?  Law students are easy money for law schools - they have to make very little investment in a law student.<br>  <br>  Now if you want a job......Look into and consider the field of HEALTHCARE!!  <<  LOTS of jobs there! and scholarships!|`|eflQHBK2aa	$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
14JQ11AUaa	I would go in and have them done! I did with mine, much easier and SO MUCH quicker!!! We went in and had them done because I only worked from Jan uary to April last year, so my fiance put me on his taxes as a dependent...and of course Jonathan. Then there was the income credit and that credit for Jonathan being born before the year was over. You are 17 and have your lil Bean :) so I would just go in and have it done and H&R Block.|`|snh9wzpnaa	You could do it yourself online if you know all the tax laws.  For example, in the little bit that you said, I see a potential problem.  You are 17 and you have a baby you are going to claim.  Are you sure you are legally qualified to take a dependent?  Somebody who is qualified to be somebody else's dependent cannot themselves take a dependent.  Are you sure you are not a dependent of somebody else - your parent(s) for example.  And before you say, "no, they told me I could take myself", that does not matter.  If they CAN take you as a dependent (whether they actually do or not doesn't matter), then you cannot take your own exemption nor can you take a dependent of your own.  If you are living with your parents, you and your child are probably both dependents of your parents.<br>  <br>  Just by sharing two sentences about yourself, you opened up a can of worms.  See why way over half of taxpayers pay a professional to do their taxes.  Same reason that I wouldn't do my own surgery on myself - for some things it pays to go to somebody with training and experience.|`|0qg1Ste0aa	Do them yourself.

AA10368727	There are many more things that determine the amount of tax you pay.  You'd have to know what deductions you're going to take.  You'd have to know what, if any, credits you're entitled to.  <br>  <br>  Simply saying, "I'm single and I made $80,000 last year" is not nearly enough information for anyone to go on. <br>  <br>  The bottom line is, after all the tax laws that apply to you have been considered, what is your TAXABLE INCOME?  If you know what your TAXABLE INCOME is, then we can use a table (or a mathematical calculation) to determine the amount of your federal income tax.  But until we know the amount of your taxable income, it is impossible to say what you would owe, and until we knew how much had been withheld or otherwise paid in advance, we wouldn't be able to tell how much you'd have to pay or how much you might get back.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	www.paycheckcity.com might be what you are wanting for budgeting purposes.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	look for the NY state dept of revenue website - you can probably download tax forms and instructions - it can vary depending on where you work and or live in NY/NYC|`|AA10622097	That's what H & R Block is for, we do not know if you are married, single, have dependents, own a home, itemize deductions, etc.

b2a385bb9ffa903e186351c0fe592310aa	Being a candy striper at a children's hospital is a great idea. If you live in a rural setting you may go check with the hospital administrator and see if your hospital has a summer internship. You will work rotations in various areas of a health care setting ( physical therapy, lab, radiology, nursing, respiratory therapy). <br>  To be a pediatric nurse you can get your associates degree in 3 years. One year for pre-reqs, and two for the program. You get an associates at a community college. The downfall is that there are usually long wait lists. You can also go to a university and get your bachelors degree. <br>   If your high school offers AP classes you will want to get some of your pre-reqs out of the way. Algebra, English comp, Speech, ect.  You should speak DON of the college you want to attend to help select the classes you can take now.<br>   Good Luck!!!|`|p0Xw8hLZaa	you can be an intern at a hospital like a candy striper at a children's hospital.  <br>  I'm trying to get into radiology, and focus it more on kids so I'm wondering if theres any such thing as pediatric radiology.<br>  In high school, focus toward your health classes, like if they have a class thats for Human growth and Development or Anatomy and Physiology.<br>  Good luck!!!|`|zGkqGZzYaa	Registered Nurse 4 years.

7QPv7ta7aa	Judgments are part of the public records section.  If the public record says you have that judgment, there is nothing you can do to remove it.  Judgments stay on your credit report 7 years of your state's statutory limit, which ever is longer.<br>  <br>  You could try hiring a lawyer and trying to get the judgment set aside but you need an actual legal reason -- like not being properly served.<br>  <br>  By the way, don't brag about gettting all those legit negative items removed from your credit report.  As long as they are still within the 7 year reporting period, they could very well show back up on your credit file.|`|f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	You can dispute anything you want.  However, know that if the Credit Reporting Agencies determine that you are just disputing without a valid reason they can consider any dispute from you frivolous.  If this happens it will make it very difficult to dispute an item that is actually incorrect, because they no longer are bound by the regulations in trying to validate any of your requests. <br>  <br>  If you have already disputed the judgment(more than once), this is probably what is happening to you and doing the same thing over and over is only doing you more harm.  <br>  <br>  Your only real chance would be to have that judgment vacated, but for that you would need valid legal grounds.  Without knowing all of the details you would have to take your judgment and have a lawer look over that as well as the original suit.  However, if you did somehow get it vacated, there is a possibility that the company could file suit against you again.

I found a site that reviews paid survey sites and they have lots of information for anyone who is interested in making money from surveys. I have been taking surveys for money for the last year or so, and I have been making 200-400 per month with just a few hours a week, I imagine if you were to sign up with lots of survey sites you could make a ton more but my situation doesn't allow the time.<br>  here is the site|`|mDnKPmibaa	<a href="http://cashcratereview.com" rel="nofollow">http://cashcratereview.com</a> Its what I do and it's worked out pretty well. What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time.
