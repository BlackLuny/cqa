I decided to use the wikipedia for the info.  I got Bunji, Machel, KMC but when i entered Faye-ann nothing came up, only that her name is mentioned in the bunji article as his wife!      Nothing on her, now thats an outrage.  She is one of the many woman icons in this country that is encouraging young womens-to-be to strive to actually be somebody.  She is pregnant, always in the spotlight and getting a set of critism about having a career and being pregnant and is dealing with it the correct way by making a name for herself and not giving a fart about what people have to say.      What do you think about this?

20090220080236AAe64UB	Travel;Africa & Middle East;United Arab Emirates	Your thoughts on all inclusive holiday in dubai?	Hey   Getting married next year in Mauritius (10 days there with all the family) however my fiance/husband are desperate not to have to spend the wedding and the honeymoon with all the wedding party.  Best place to twin centre honeymoon with Mauritius is Dubai but what are your thoughts on an all inclusive hotel.  Our budget will be mainly spent on the wedding, flights, 5 star accommodation in Mauritius however i have seen some nice all inclusives in dubai all be it not many of them.  One of the travel agents put me off by saying you wouldnt want to go to dubai all inclusive.  I know there is lots to see and do but basically the point of the twin centre is for somewhere we can go, let our hair down ALONE and not have to spend a small fortune.  The bars in the hotels in mauritius close at 11pm and the thought of 17 nights of little entertainment and constraints on when i have to stop enjoying a drinking doesnt exactly excite.  I know dubai isnt really about drinking as its not that culture however some of the all inc hotels say they have many bars and a lot of entertainment.  Please help with my dilemma   Have a great weekend folks   G

I know there was the listeriosis outbreak and it created massive measures to protect the public health.  But on the other hand, you have Quebec raw milk cheese producers who were not at all responsible for the outbreak, their cheeses are delicious, they make a living off this cheese.   I understand both arguments, but why can’t Canadian authorities and inspectors work with industry producers (especially when production is family-run and organic) like in the case of Quebec’s raw milk cheese market?

Please I really need some advice on what to do this summer o9.Ive never been to ibitha or thailand but heard there both amazing!Especially from people that have been to Ibiza and Thailand and from those that have worked in Ibiza for the summer months.   Basically I just want get away from the wet weather of Irl.So far was really up for going to Ibitha ,the idea of working in a buzzing atmosphere meeting differnt people and going to see some of the best DJs in the world really appealed to me but Ive been getting really mixed references from people lately some saying Ibiza sleazy and full of brit whatever no offence..just like every other spanish resort except hell alot more expensive. Then others saying Ibiza amazing and is actually a beautiful place.   As for Thailand some saying it was good but a very very different culture esp bangkok but I know myself that itwould be life changing to see however down side would be the cost to getting there keeping myself going for 3 weeks and all the injections that will have be taken.      So if I could get maybe some advice on what the better choice would be for me ..I am 21 and love travel ling partying meeting new people and doing new things,so would really appreciate some advise on whether I should   a) Go out in may get a job in Ibiza in a bar or something and have some craic on the party planet of the world for 3 months..      b)Stay in my country for a wet 2 months save up then go ibiza for 2 weeks for a holiday then go to Thailand for 3 weeks..      c)Leave Thailand for when Im on way to or fro from australia when am a bit older and need a break from Oz heard thats the in thing to do and just go ibiza on hols and maybe a bit of bagpacking arounf europe..      All comments appreciated !!   Thanks xxx   BaseBlondeC   Thanks!!

I know this sounds like an odd request but I LOVE the videos that are played on Disney's Magical Express going to and leaving the WDW resorts.  They're just so cute with the characters going in the hotels and all!  I always feel like the magic's truly begun when those videos start (and it helps me keep the magic with me as I go back to the airport to go home.)  It would be great if i could watch those magical videos anytime I wanted.  So I was wondering if someone who is going to WDW soon could possibly record both videos (to and from the resort) and post them on Google so I (and other people who are also big WDW fans) could download them.  Please let me know by answering and thank you again!

20090220094854AAPdJDu	Travel;Asia Pacific;Philippines	How would you feel if you gave a friend a lottery ticket... and then he wins A LOT of money with it?	Last week a friend of mine lost his wallet while jogging. What caused him to be depressed even more was the fact that inside his lost wallet were irreplacable pictures of his dead parents.   I didn't know what to do to help him, so I bought him 3 lottery tickets to cheer him up. He scratched the tickets and to my friggin surprise... he won ￡5,000!!! That's like 340,000 Philippine pesos!!!!   My jaw dropped to the floor when I saw him win it. Really it did, or at least it felt like it did.   As geniunely happy as I was for my friend's win, I still can't believe I had the chance to keep them damn tickets for myself.      Anyway, I guess he knows how I must be feeling. He decided to give me ￡500 from the prize. Oh great, now I'm the one who needs some cheering up.      How would you take it if this happened to you?

I'm traveling to mexico city on business and staying a pretty decent hotel in a pretty nice area from the research that I have done.  However, i have read alot about people getting kidnapped.  So I was wondering if people ever get kidnapped in hotels?  Do kidnappers actually ever try to  get people going into their rooms or worse have they ever been hidden in the rooms.  I'm always so paranoid that there will be someone hiding in my hotel room even when I'm in nice familiar towns in the US.  Also, I know your not suppose to travel alone but I am Catholic and would feel wrong not going to the Santuria de Guadalupe while I am there.  Would it be safe for me to go by myself to the santurio on a Sunday morning.  I guess I could schedule a taxi at the hotel to take me there but how would I get back?  Are there safe taxis at the church.

I go to a public school so people don't really bring in many expensive items. The bag I bought is a shoulder bag which is brown, real leather and it was ￡25 (quite expensive!) It looks rather large on me as i'm quite slim. It looks really grown up, like something my mum would buy, but i think its a good size for school also it's really strong so it can carry all my books easily!       I'm just not sure if my bag will be 'cool'. It's too late to buy another one i'm not sure if i'll stand out too much as most other girls have black cotton shoulder bags.       I think my bag sounds is a bit dorky! What do you think?      Also I don't know how to keep it safe when i go to lunch as all my friends just throw their bags down on the floor, but i don't think i want to leave my bag alone! Any suggestions? I could put it in my locker but I would need my bag as my lunch would be in it.      I know i'm making a big fuss out of nothing! lol but i need help!      Thanks. xx
