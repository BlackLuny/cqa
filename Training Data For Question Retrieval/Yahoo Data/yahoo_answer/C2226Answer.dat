lxmFCWmXaa	you have to have the original to play asian dynasties, because it is an expansion.<br>  <br>  If you already have the original, you MUST get TAD (the asian dynasties)<br>  <br>  I have been playing the AGE series since the beginning, when the elephants you tried to hunt would tusk your villagers to death. Oh those were the days, ok-enough reminiscing. <br>  <br>  If you get good and play online, then TAD balances the game really well. The game is INSANELY fun to play online.<br>  <br>  The campaign is a riot too. I suggest you pay the $20 and get the game. It is uber sweet.<br>  <br>  I believe the cheat is "give me liberty, or give me wood"
1mbO4UYiaa	If you cannot pick the DS game up cheaper from Game or Gamestation (maybe pre-owned!) - then you could always buy it from Play.com - they are selling Professor Layton for ï¿¡19.99 - delivery is quite quick - couple of days (in my experience!)
GZiJE9kTaa	In Sims 1, you can choose head in CAS (there are different heads with different hairstyles) and Sims have to live with it till the end of their life. You can't change it.<br>  <br>  You can change it in The Sims 2 though. Just click on any available mirror -> change appearance and that's it.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure about which Sims are you talking so I answered for both The Sims and The Sims 2.|`|AA10010715	To change their clothes buy a dresser.  For Sims 2 you'll have to send them to a store to buy clothes before you'll be able to change their clothes.

DtkLsetkaa	OK you listed in your subject Sims 2 PC< but in your question you say Sims2 PS2.  Since you mentioned University i would assume you meant for PC, so if so, that's the only way you are going to get an item like this.  That was probably made by the owner of that particular game or downloaded from a website.  The 2 best websites for downloads are TheSimsResource.com and ModtheSims.com (double check those sites).  Just do a search for the person you want the picture of and see if you find one.  If you don't you can still contact an artist that does that style work and request a special picture,  but you may have to pay for it.  Good luck and have fun!!!|`|dhJdAPn4aa	You shouldnt buy it now. o_o Sims 3 is coming out real soon!!|`|3uCRmoosaa	Most if not all of the downloads available for the Sims is for the PC or MAC sims.

7YBCPMWXaa	It may seem like a bit of a cop-out answer, but the best thing to do is to practice.<br>  <br>  The more time you spend playing a game, the more you'll learn. You'll learn the layout of all the maps; the locations where people will respawn, the most likely sniping/"camping" spots, the best places to defend objectives (bomb sites, flags, bases, etc.) without leaving yourself open to enemy fire and the like.<br>  <br>  Watching what people do is another way to get better. When you learn to anticipate the actions they're likely to take next, you'll be able to know the best way to intercept them in order to get the next kill.<br>  <br>  As you play, you'll train up your reflexes, which allow you to be quick on the draw, aiming and shooting people when you spot them.<br>  <br>  If possible, try and play against people as good as (or even better than) you. That way, you'll always be challenged, which acts as an incentive to become a better player. It starts out with little things - killing a certain player on the odd occasion but, slowly but surely, you'll kill them more often until, finally, you'll be able to predict their every move and be able to kill them before they do the same to you.<br>  <br>  In games like Call of Duty, Battlefield and Counterstrike, where you're able to choose from an array of different weapons (though it also applies to the Quake-style games where new weapons are picked up in the maps themselves), you'll soon find yourself favouring certain weapons over others, getting a "feel" for them, so to speak. You'll be able to make that tricky long-range shot with one gun, but find youself unable to make the same shot with another.<br>  <br>  Even while playing with your favourite weapon, it's an idea to practice with other guns (preferably as many as possible) too, that way, if you're caught without ammo, that discarded gun on the floor won't be entirely useless to you when you're in a firefight.<br>  <br>  Another thing to remember is (unless you're sniping or defending) keep moving as much as possible. If you can crouch or drop into a prone position, do that too if the situation warrants. A small(er), moving target is a lot tougher to hit than a large(r), stationary one.<br>  <br>  Within reason, of course, ignore the "rules". Too many times, I've seen servers (on Call of Duty 4, at least) that prohibit things such as "bunnyhopping" (despite their interpretation of the term being wrong nine times out of ten, but let's gloss over that) and "camping". If hitting the spacebar (or whatever button you use) to literally get the jump on someone or staying hidden in an advantageous location is working for you, keep doing it! If they whine at you, threatening to kick you off (or even ban you), then it's easy go and find somewhere else to play. There are literally thousands of servers out there.<br>  <br>  Once you get better, you'll start to get people in clans asking if you want to join up. It's entirely your choice which ones you do join, but the whole clan-based teamplay experience is an excellent way to get better. You'll be playing matches against comparable clans and even against ones better than you. Any experience, win or lose, is good experience.<br>  <br>  As you'd expect, getting better is something that won't happen overnight. It takes a lot of hard work, like learning to play a guitar. But stick at it and you'll eventually reap the rewards.|`|Y6f7HMqSaa	Most people who play and get good in first person shooters develop excellent reflex actions and good hand&eye coordination.  However this alone will not help you much over time.  Most of the best ones combine this with very detailed knowledge of the maps/areas they battle in and usually bottle up opponents in "kill zones".  <br>  <br>  A "kill zone" is generally when a player protects their rear and flanks (left/right)  well and focuses on killing enemies in front of him where a large number of enemies are exposed and cannot bring effective/accurate fire at them.<br>  <br>  Highly skilled players usually have at least 2 if not more "kill zone" locations and usually know the best route to avoid being everyone's favorite target.<br>  <br>  <br>  Except for maybe Counter-strike, most of my first person shooting is done with simulations, not arcade shoot em ups.  I battle in simulations where military tactics, training, and strategy must be rigorously followed in order to survive and win.<br>  <br>  I mostly now focus on playing modern combat flight simulations and modern naval warfare simulations.  Much more complex, detailed, and involving gameplay.  In short, I've moved on up to bigger targets...|`|gvguk8deaa	Honestly there is no quick fix you just have to learn the maps in your game of choice. Where to hide, where choke points usually are, and also people tend to take the same paths in every map. Use those kinds of behaviors to your advantage. Also, just keep practicing. Good Luck|`|Kqpqt69Vaa	all you can really do is practice,practice,practice there really isn't much else to do.its the same for any game like a racing game,to take a certain corner that your having trouble with you just keep doing it over and over until you get it right. hope this helps.|`|5p3ygCI8aa	The best thing for you to do is forget your life, grades, and girl friend.  Play the game 24/7 and PRACTICE ALOT.  Eventually you will get better.

The company that developed the game wanted to base the game on a actual donkey, escaped in Tokyo. He and his son saw a gorilla kick a barrel while he was being fed at the zoo and thought it was so funny that he would base his game on it. Since he registered the name Donkey Kong, he used the name Donkey Kong anway.|`|NnjhPnQXaa	she lied its cos in the past donkey kong was the true one on sega mega drive but now has been exchanged as it is been sued for ripping off a game Called DonkeyWarrior on dream cast and Snes and Sega so they have Sold the Donkey and earnned sewin earnings back and will now be doing little research as donkeykong is getting much better and it is a big guy but supposed to look like a donkey !!!<br>  Cholla  <br>  X

75107d92736ad6fea72a78e30303fbdaaa	if you have live or have updated your console using a disk with software downloaded from xbox.com then it will, if it doesn't, go to xbox.com and search for xbox backwards compatibility, then download the update, copy that to disk and put that on your 360.|`|hZIVKiFdaa	You can play Halo 2 on a 360. Go to bungie.com or xbox.com for download details, its a download feature that enables you to play all your xbox games on the 360. You burn it on a CD via you computer, play it on the 360 and it automatically installs it on the 360. If your 360 is online that would probably be a quicker process.|`|lvMRIu2xaa	Yes it will.
6GIrW5eWaa	based on the information that you have provided and based on Microsoft's extended warranty there is a chance that you might not get this repair done under warranty. Xbox increased the warranty to 3 years for RROD, you state that you have had your system for 5 years. You are 2 years beyond the extension of warranty. You can still go through the motions but right now you only have a video issue, if you put more issues into the system by creating the RROD and it isn't under warranty then it will cost more to repair than it would with one issue. It might even be so much to repair that it would be cheaper just to buy a new Arcade version. Good Luck<br>  <br>  Edit: go to www.xbox.com they have some online tools but I found that it is best to just call them. the number is on the website. Good Luck Dude|`|b7xOWvAcaa	Try having the system on and picking it up and shaking it up a bit. The RROD is essentially a hardware failure, most of the time dealing with the hard drive. not sure if this will work but its worth a try. 5years is a hella long time for a 360 to still be working. Ive had 360 for 5 years and went through 3, so consider urself lucky.|`|gvguk8deaa	I would still recommend calling Xbox to see if it's covered. They extended the warranties on their Xbox 360 by 3 years so you still may be covered. Good luck

KUcM5UDKaa	I can only vouch for Halo 3 since I've played it so much. <br>  <br>  And it's very different from when I first got it as well. There are new maps coming out all the time, the playlists change, constant updates. And that's just matchmaking. Saved films/clips/screenshots sharing, map editing, gametype creating, all of it can be shared through the file share or Bungie.net. There are just way too many features and more developer support than any game I've ever seen.

qbmkMWqeaa	Although the DS Lite regularly outsells the PSP, there are still some people who prefer the PSP's functionality over the DS' better games. Weird.  So Nintendo has added dual cameras, larger screen, and memory card support and removed the GBA slot.<br>  <br>  Since the DSI is just coming out here, I doubt there is any advanced notice of a system that will replace it. I doubt Nintendo would reveal anything since they delayed the DSi here in the states because the DS lite is still the best seller.|`|k32sOHLgaa	If you have the original DS then the DSi is a much better choice then the DS lite. Sure, you can't play GBA games on the DSi but you have a DS for that. In exchange the DSi is slimmer then the DS lite and it's screen is bigger. It also has better speaker that sounds great. It also has an internal feature that allows you to play mp4 music files directly from the DSi menu, and the camera is nice (in the future exclusive games for the DSi will use the camera). Any game for the DS works great on the DSi and it cost almost the same as a DS lite so it's a good buy!
434f04a6fde02d2e60610cacc58bd89eaa	If you have the codex you should be able to work it out easily enough by adding up the points for the various items. That's if what you're making is legal.<br>  <br>  If it's not legal, you will need to agree with your opponent that you can use it and what points value it should have.<br>  <br>  The points costs of the legal options are worked out based on the model as a whole and not just the sum of its parts. Putting the same upgrades on a different model might be overpowered or underpowered in comparison, and that's where the negotiation comes in i.e. should you use the same points value as each upgrade/option added together, or should it be more?

3m9DQuDRaa	The problem with CFL being in Madden is that the two leagues are considered competing leagues.  Madden USED to have the international NFL league teams in the game...  but that's because that was still owned by the NFLPA.<br>  <br>  CFL is a competing league and therefore can't be in the same game due to NFL's legal binding with EA Sports (if EA sports didn't have a binding agreement, they probably could have gotten a CFL contract by now...)<br>  <br>  As much as CFL has a following in Canada, I doubt it'd sell well anywhere else.  EA has a hard enough time selling NFL games to Europe and Japan.  I doubt a company would be willing to make a game that has a VERY small niche in the US, too...  especially when the US market is second only to Japan in game sales.

Wzws8v8daa	yes they are fleas, you should trap it with you net so you can donate it to the museum or sell it to tom nook.<br>  you have to have a net, and then take it out of your pocket and either swing your wii remote to catch it, or press the A button.   the only problem with using A button is that sometimes it will make you talk to the neighbor instead of swing the net, so swinging your wii remote is better.|`|g1ZH0iDlaa	They are fleas take a net and hit the person ok lol!!

vUVxS9Xhaa	Nope, it will not work. It has to be an official xbox hard drive.|`|EEcQelLxaa	I know there are ways to load files back and forth from a computer and a 360, I'm not exactly sure what it is called, but I don't think there's a way you are going to be able to put a computer hard drive in a 360. They contain Microsoft's technology... I'm not 100% on this, but I know there was software you could flash a Hard Drive with for your original XBox, but I've yet to open up the 360 (3 rings, don't really want to void the warranty). In any case, good luck. I'll edit this with some links if I can find any... but I'm fairly sure anything you do find would be borderline illegal, so- not really sure what I'm allowed to post here XD<br>  <br>  Never done this myself, so I can't be much help, but good luck if you are going to undertake it.

7YBCPMWXaa	The map pack for CoD5, featuring the new multiplayer maps "Nightfire", "Station" and "Knee-Deep" and the second Nazi Zombies map called "VerrÃ¼ckt" is said to be coming out in March. As for an exact release date, there hasn't been one announced yet but, as of March 4th, the map pack isn't out yet.|`|3eQhA8nraa	there is a free map, its available now
DfPyyDssaa	It can only be cast once the player has leveled up the materia.|`|uctxzjIIaa	Ultima, Shield, and a few other materia require you to level it up once before any ability is unlocked.|`|s385zhsHaa	Yes, you have to have the materia at rank 2.  Keep it equipped and do some grinding.
QwLlZ1M6aa	i have played both games and i perfer Midnight Club Los Angeles over burnout because its funner,looks amazing,plays great, and it's a blast online and also the new South central map is coming out so the map will be bigger if u pay 9.99 via PSN or 800 MS points via LIVE you get 9 more cars new stuff for the cars and a lot more races. burnout is alrite but it's just not that fun sure there crashing into the other cars and all but its just not that great and gameplay isn't the best but its easy to pick up and play. but in overall i would reconnmend Midnight Club Los Angeles over Burnout Paradise any day here's a link for a look at the upcoming DLC for Midnight Club Los Angeles|`|PTP8ptDbaa	midnight club! it's awesome!|`|vUVxS9Xhaa	Burnout Paradise 100%<br>  <br>  Dont just take my word for it...Burnout was nominated for game of the year on gamespot.com.<br>  <br>  Also my friend has both and he says burn out is much better.<br>  <br>  I have burnout and it is a lot of fun.|`|7dABdcqTaa	I haven't played Midnight Club, but the slow-mo in Burnout Paradise is obnoxious. I could never get into it. Best racing game I've played is NFS Underground 2. That, or F-Zero for the SNES, but no one likes playing SNES games anymore.|`|uzohDpBnaa	burnout paradise is a sweet game|`|IPMItFlMaa	id say burnout paradise because its more challenging than midnight club so get burnout.|`|GMS1oIdIaa	Midnight club is much better ! ! !
KUcM5UDKaa	on your keypad there are letters on every number. just push the number that has the letter on it. this is true in real life as well.<br>  <br>  555-OOPS is 555-6677, because the letter O is on the 6 key, and the letters P and S are on the 7 key.<br>  <br>  if you dont know this, it makes me wonder... are you old enough to be playing saints row?
vUVxS9Xhaa	Apparently if you finish the entire game on any difficulty only using a pistol and grenades as your weapon then you can unlock it.<br>  <br>  Personally i think its just a MYTH i doubt it really exists...why dont you try it and find out...people are claiming thats how you get it but i dont buy it.|`|5ae78c43139db27c6f3f486f9941164eaa	Yes, there is. But i have not yet found out how to get it yet.
5ae78c43139db27c6f3f486f9941164eaa	I don't think that they have made an english version of j.girl fight. If they had, you would have found it by now. So my guess is that it will never be made in english.
mvu0yrF8aa	Send it to the Company they will fix it for a charge, i think.|`|5ae78c43139db27c6f3f486f9941164eaa	If you call a game store or a store that sells the ps3, then they should have the answer for you. Just try and call game stop and ask them if a new hard drive will help it work. If they say yes, then buy a new one, if they say no, then you might have to buy a new ps3 or send the broken one in to get fixed if it still has the warranty on it.|`|r6pnDFKBaa	Sell it to me <br>  I'll buy it for $75
TNWk5rJkaa	no actually i don't but you can get one just go to bungie.net and search halo wars pc  and right below the cover picture there will be a couple codes|`|5ae78c43139db27c6f3f486f9941164eaa	No one who has the code will just give it to you for free. If they have used the code, then the code will no longer work for anyone else. You might have to just wait a couple of days to get the code.|`|2gzfW5TXaa	Nobody will give you a code I'm afraid. Not one that works anyway ;) It's out in a couple of days so you'll have to wait a bit longer.|`|joRFPV1Vaa	hahaha, sry, but No
Kwt7xLjUaa	hi ive played and beaten both games and i recommend american wasteland 100 %   hope this helps|`|5ae78c43139db27c6f3f486f9941164eaa	If you only have 2 hours to decide, then you better hurry up and go to the store and buy american wasteland. It is the better one of the two. Trust me and the first guy that answered your question.|`|mvu0yrF8aa	well personally i like American Wasteland, but Project 8 has better graphic (sorta) So I recommend American Wasteland.
Tk29jePpaa	Out of those two I would pick wasteland, but if it were me i would pick up Skate.....the orginal not skate 2 that is $60. I like skate alot more than i do hawk and I was a huge hawk fan back in the day.
Tk29jePpaa	The maps will not be on the market place for awhile since they are using it as a marketing scheme but they will be out a month or two down the road. I will be waiting and I suggest you do the same because halo wars is not worth it. (just my opinion)|`|NTrPoIeRaa	you have to buy halo wars <br>  LTD|`|YohRBy8naa	you need to buy halo wars its $60 at any walmart or game stop. and your good now get out there and buy it!!!!!!!!|`|cKvtKaRNaa	yes

wPnJekdqaa	You can only search on the GTS for PokÃ©mon you've already seen. It's pretty dumb but it does stop people from just going straight there and searching for Mewtwo or something and playing through the entire game with an overpowered or rare PokÃ©mon.<br>  <br>  If you want to search for a Bulbasaur, you either have to Pal Park one over first or get someone to trade you one via friend codes or local wifi first. It might sound like GTS is a waste of time because you already have to have a Bulbasaur to search one, but it can help if you accidently released it/messed up training or if your friend traded you one just for the Dex entry. <br>  <br>  If you want a Bulbasaur but can't search the GTS yet, your best bet would be to join a PokÃ©mon forum and ask around there if anyone has one to trade you.|`|613d5971b99debfdbfc4fe45b9e6f875aa	gts? never heard of it
uyt5M6gTaa	warlock ftw|`|5NpI6rLwaa	I think Rogues are more fun<br>  Warlocks are much better at PvP(i think so at least) they just fear and DoT :P<br>  PvE is pretty even between them<br>  For tanking druid, go rogue, both being melee clases, and rogues are kind of like cat form<br>  both can kill things fast for questing, but rogues i think can do it a little faster. but warlocks can probably deal with more at a time, though rogues can do well against a few targets<br>  <br>  Overall i prefer rogues over warlock|`|AA11707728	More fun/PvE (solo) - Warlock, definitely.  Warlocks kill in a variety of novel ways. Rogues basically grind.  Warlocks can kill multiple orange, even red con mobs.  Rogues can barely handle an add killing greens.  Warlock have no downtime.  Rogues have significant downtime if killing anythign except con greens.<br>  <br>  PvP - Low level, warlocks (fear owns all).  High level...rogues own all but classes with incredible amounts of hit points.  Paladins in particular are a problem (for everyone).<br>  <br>  Better with a bear - most definitely a rogue.  Warlocks kill with damage over time spells followed by conversion of life drains to mana.  Another player interupts the balance of this, requiring that you eat and drink between battles.  Of course, a druid could always pop out of bear and slap a heal over time on you while they are doing it to themselves.  However, you simply won't be doing anywhere near the damage to a mob that you would solo.  Warlock efficiency takes a MAJOR hit when paired with another, unless fighting mobs with tons of hit points.  Rogues, on the other hand, love being paired with druids.  Unlike any other tank in the game, druids can easily hold aggro against rogue dps.  Feel free to backstab the crap out of whatever mob the druid is tanking for very high dps.  Unlikely you will take aggro, or keep it for long.  If you are playing with a feral druid, this is the class you want to pair with them.  Also, there are times when you might want to stealth past stuff together.|`|3MrhyHTZaa	personally i would go priest... there is a new patch coming out (or so i hear) that you can dual spec... after you get to 80 and have all your talent points in one tree, you pay like 1000g and you get all your talent points back... but still have your full specialization... say you are a holy priest and then pay the 1000g thing, you could dual spec to holy/shadow... imagine the possibilities... <br>  however as far as the rouge warlock... id go rouge for the same reason... any combination of their three talent trees would be deadly|`|b9YVC7Mraa	i say go warlock. you get a minion which is a good thing especially if you solo a lot|`|FZjhVpQCaa	my opinion warlock im not saying that a rogue isnt fun but warlocks are funner|`|613d5971b99debfdbfc4fe45b9e6f875aa	let me know if u get any good one's|`|gA2op2YEaa	Pally ftw

On your Wi-Fi you could also let the PS3 port through, so you don't have to disable your firewall on the router.  Or if your PS3 is close to your internet cables, you could just run a wire directly to your PS3.  It will configure itself in some ways, but you have to run setup to get it going.

0af7c8af45c772ad750996038c21d9daaa	First of all, all jobs have their pros and cons, so there's no "best job" in the game. Choose whatever you feel more comfortable with.<br>  <br>  Now to answer your question. In the second job? No, clerics don't have better damage than others. Actually their damage is probably the least compared to all other jobs in the game (I'm talking about the 2nd job). But at the fourth job, clerics are probably the best when it comes to damage. If you want to be a cleric, think about this. Why do you need to hit high anyway? You'll always get EXP from partying with others. Your main job is to heal. Party with high level Dragon Knights and you'll level up in no time, faster than other mages soloing monsters with their high damage. Also, apart from Monster Carnival, clerics are almost always wanted in PQs and boss runs.
XtzBxxJBaa	When you get Nookingtons you'll also get Shampoodle and be able to change hair style/color there.  You don't get to pick your style/color, you answer questions that pick them for you.<br>  <br>  To get Nookingtons, besides spending tons of bells at Nook's, you'll also have to have someone else visit your town and come buy something from him.  In City Folk, that doesn't have to happen, just Wild World.|`|b9Rp0kbDaa	you have to wait for the hair stylist to move into town I believe it happens after tom nook's shop becomes a Nookingtons... but I could be wrong.  I haven't gotten his shop to that high of a level yet.

But im never mean to him hes my buddy|`|xdXfRcfGaa	the only disadvantage is that you'll be ridiculed the entire match... especially if your shots are falling SHORT|`|6cwJi5kxaa	Yes short people have the same advantage. if you want to stand on a crate then go ahead. just dont fall off.
BXOOnxXgaa	I don't beleive that you can play on LIVE.  You can chat and message but I think that is it|`|DXFs9VuSaa	Mr Moo is right you know. Chat and message that's your lot im afraid.

How are we supposed to know what games,movies, or saves you had on it?  Just to let you know, if you just want to put it back into your ps3 so you can use it, just pop it back in and format it, then it will be just like you just bought it.  You are being pretty vague about what you need.|`|0ZY2Lromaa	Dude you shouldn't of done that in the first place...|`|MBtC7hR9aa	i`m sample ... man just tell me what i can do PLEASEEE i just want it to work

hmfqzfO5aa	You will get your booklet for the 09 season in the mail it should have a form with your accepted position on it. Just bring that with you on the process in date. <br>  It usually takes about an hour or two to get everything done. If you drive you will have to fill out a form to get a sticker for you car. <br>  <br>  You get two sets of uniforms which you can go and trade in one set a day or you can wash them yourself. <br>  <br>  The hardest part about the processing in is getting into housing. There is three different housing options though.<br>  1. You have dorms which fit about 3 to 4 people in the room they cost about 30 to 36 dollars a week. AC is included. <br>  <br>  2. Apartments there is 5 different dorm style rooms in it containing two bathrooms in it and a full size kitchen. They cost around 20 to 24 a week. AC is only in the Living room which is also the kitchen.<br>  <br>  3 Then you have the cedars(Men)/or golds(Woman) This housing doesnt open up until June though. It is located on point so its nice because you can wake up about 10 mins before your shift and go to work. Its dorm style fits about 3 to 4 people in it. They cost around 14 to 17 a week. <br>  <br>  If you have a facebook we have a group for CP employees for 09.

Change the emulation speed to Realtime auto *2 (fastest). Change sound output to digital stereo. Change NDS Cartridge backup media to Flash 512k (so it can save ingame). Click controls and change controls to whatever. OK. Then options/ save options.<br>  3. Start new game. <br>  4. Play a bit and save as soon as you can (to check whether it can), with whatever you assigned the x key. <br>  5. Quit the emulator! If you don't the save file won't be generated!<br>  6. Open the rom again. If the continue option is there, it should be. If it isn't or something went wrong, email me. Before you do that, check whether you've done the steps right.<br>  7.

XxU94aKlaa	If a new system was coming out in 2010 we would have already heard about it by now plan and simple, developers tend to brag about their new systems for more than a year.<br>  We heard about the 360 in 2003 it was then released in 2005 (and that was the official "new gen is here" thing), we heard about the PS3 in May of 2005 and got it November of 2006, and we heard about the Wii very early back in 2001 but didn't get it until 2006. You can go back and look at the information from each generation and see the same pattern- It's always at least a year in advanced that the system is actually reviled to the public. <br>  I will admit we are in the fourth year where as most of the time something is coming out to replace the old stuff, heck I wouldn't be surprised if we hear an announcement on something new this year, but I would not be holding my breath on something new hitting the market this year.<br>  <br>  What I am seeing and expecting is more of those little "updates" we've been seeing lately: The PS3's minimum hard drive size increased, the 360's minimum hard drive size increased (Ignoring the Arcade), and I would bet the Wii will be coming out in new colors eventually (though with the sales their getting I doubt they need a gimmick like that at the moment).<br>  The handhelds are being even worse about this sort of thing- We had a PSP, then we had colored PSPs, then we got the 2000 series, we've gone on to the 3000 series- That's 4 types of PSPs to date.<br>  The DS has been just as bad (if not worse) about it- We went from a fatter clunker model to the DS Lite, the lite brought about a ton of color choices, and now their bringing out the DSi. People don't even know yet if the DSi is just a useless expansion or if it's going to take the place of the DS Lite (It can play games the DS can't, but there's no announcements for any DSi only games yet. It has a harddrive sure, but what are they going to use it for and when? There are a lot of questions yet to be answered on the DSi, we simply don't know what will happen with it yet).<br>  <br>  Add:<br>  It's impossible to tell. I personally think the Blue-ray player alone warrents the price of the PS3 but it's impossible to tell what will come out in the future at this point and when it'll come out for that matter.<br>  And yes I was quite annoyed when I went to work one day and they said the 360 now had a new minimum hard drive size- I felt cheated >_>|`|ktbyKKK9aa	The console's life span depends on its sales. You will NOT see any new home console from Microsoft, Sony or Nintendo in a few years. In 2012 the "New" Xbox might be released, though its just an estimation.
nYgUfUd7aa	Yes you can upgrade the internal drive to any SATA 2.5" drive (the maximum drive available as of this moment if 500 GB).  I have upgraded mine to 500 GB and it works great.  The drive can be formatted with the PS3 the next time you turn the PS3 on after upgrading...

The best Magic: The Gathering decks are played in Vintage and the average cost of one of these decks (even a cheap one like Charbelcher) is well over 4,000 dollars, with a combo Tendrils deck like Grim Long costs about 8,000. If you are interested in these, I would direct you to look at Vintage tourney results.<br>  <br>  If you want the current best decks, you can follow tournament results on any number of mainstream Magic websites like Star City Games or the official Magic site. You will find up to date versions of each of the main archetypes.<br>  <br>  If you want to see historical decks, you can often find the best of them posted at MTG Vortex. These decks represent the best decks of their respective formats in history.<br>  <br>  If you want even more tournament results, check out Deck Check. It has extensive listings of user-submitted tournament information.|`|3u1TrYH6aa	i played using a sliver deck, a magnificent, indestructible and wondrous. every creature you get out with the slivers adds power to all when others sou you begin weaving an invincible defense. when all your creatures have flying, protection from all colors, +6/+6, first strike and trample you know you've won. only problem is that a true sliver deck has it that is really requires all five colors and getting mana screwed is really easy early game when your weak to quick decks. <br>  <br>  also i had a very fun deck that destroyed land. there are quit a fey four mana destroy one land red cars so you can keep the deck pure red except for several dingus eggs [2 damage per dingus egg to a lands owner when a land gets destroyed] creatures like goblin gardener and flame serpentnt. also i used Aether flashes [every creature takes 2 damage per aether flash when it comes into play] so that when they have only a few land in play then they cant play creatures. i used ball lightning and skissiks (a bigger ball lightning) when i needed creature but in general four mana and they cant play anything.<br>  <br>  but if you're looking for pure humor in game play, look into the unhinged set.

I'll try and help.<br>  On the map screen on your PipBoy, place your marker on Rivet City (in the bottom right of the screen). The trail of dots leading from you to your marker should show you where you have to go to get to your desination (if it goes to a subway station, you need to travel through the subway to reach the marker). Don't cut across this trail, the simplest way (and quite often the only way) is to follow it exactly.<br>  If you are already at Rivet City, just climb the stairs and the guards should see you there and put out the bridge to let you in.

8hbm4uiPaa	It believe it will work, based on the most recent printing of the card.<br>  <br>  Animate Dead was last printed on Magic Online for the Master Series, and it uses the following text (<a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=animate_dead)" rel="nofollow">http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDeta...</a><br>  <br>  Animate Dead - 1B<br>  Enchantment - Aura<br>  Enchant creature card in a graveyard <br>  When Animate Dead comes into play, if it's in play, it loses "enchant creature card in a graveyard" and gains "enchant creature put into play with Animate Dead." Return enchanted creature card to play under your control and attach Animate Dead to it. When Animate Dead leaves play, that creature's controller sacrifices it. <br>  Enchanted creature gets -1/-0.<br>  <br>  Previous versions said 'when you play it', but that is no longer the case now that the card has been through errata.  So Annimate Dead will re-target when it comes back into play.<br>  <br>  If so, this is how it would work:<br>  <br>  You play Animate Dead targeting Worldgorger Dragon.  As the Worldgorger Dragon comes into play from the graveyard, Worldgorger Dragon's 'remove all permanent ability' goes on the stack on top of the Animate Dead trigger, but this won't matter, because Animate Dead will trigger regardless of whether or not it successfully attaches itself to the dragon.<br>  <br>  When Worldgorger Dragon's 'remove all permanents from the game' ability resolves, Animate Dead will be removed along with all other permanents (you can respond to the trigger by tapping all of your land for mana).  <br>  <br>  This will trigger Worldgorger Dragon to return to the graveyard due to Animate Dead's triggered ability, and thus will trigger Worldgorger Dragon's second triggered ability to bring all of those permanents back into play.<br>  <br>  One problem you could potentionally run into.  If no other creature is in a graveyard, you could create an endless loop unless you are using all of your infinate mana on a instant spell that will end the game when it is cast.  Otherwise, the loop will not stop, and the game will end in a draw.<br>  <br>  Your opponent could also create the endless loop if they were able to remove all other creatures in the graveyards while one of Worldgorger Dragon's abilities are on the stack.  They would only do this in a losing position though, because if they have the ability to do this, it is more likely they would simply remove Worldgorger Dragon itself.

j6MvCr6Naa	1. Fable<br>  <br>  Here's the average score from many different reviews of Fable:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbx/fable?q=fable" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 85% meaning this is an awesome game.<br>  <br>  This game pretty much revolutionised Action-RPG's. This is a wonderful adventure, the graphics are very bright, beautiful and the game world is lush and green. The character and game world design is unique and very appealing, your character's appearance changes over time depending on your actions. If you eat to much you will grow fat, if you perform evel deeds you will start to grow horns and other things and if you do good deeds your hair will get lighter etc. Another awesome thing about this game is that you can do so many different things, Fable really puts the role-playing into role-playin games. You can get drunk, get into fights, slaughter entire villages if you wish and pretty much anything else that crosses your mind. You really can't go wrong getting this wonderful game.<br>  <br>  2. Jade Empire<br>  <br>  Here's the average score from many different reviews of Jade Empire:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbx/jadeempire?q=jade%20empire" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 89% meaning it's brilliant.<br>  <br>  This game is also beautiful just like Fable, but lacks the style in my opinion as well as the humour and the awesome feeling of happiness you get while playing Fable. This game however has a better story than Fable in my opinion, it's also twice as long and the combat is much deeper and more satisfying. There are also moral choices you have to make in the game which are more powerful than what Fable has to offer. So, all in all this is technicaly a better game than Fable and once again you can't go wrong getting it.<br>  <br>  In the end it all depends on what kind of game you prefer. If you want a more light-hearted RPG with good humour, a happy atmosphere, a lot of freedom in what you do and a hell of a lot of fun, choose Fable. However, if you want something more serious, deeper, more hardcore and something a little more engaging than I suggest you go with Jade Empire.<br>  <br>  Personnaly I would go with Fable. But like I said, it all depends on what kind of game you prefer.|`|TsJIJGvJaa	fable is probably more original, but i've heard a lot of good things about jade empire, so i would say that.|`|eZaxteLMaa	im really sry but if i knew one then i wood help srry but ill look them  up in a few|`|267ebb0c52d6c8fb688b6be2e46e9af5aa	fable 2 idk it just is|`|6KXptMKBaa	fable is fun, but it gets pretty boring after awhile. if you like those types of game then i would say get fable not jade empire.

You can evolve haunter by trading it and getting this back.

Look up a walkthrough of the game on google though. It might help|`|fb4a8a151cda753e52ad1801c947f31eaa	well when i play i choose the things with the most points there first. when your on the part to choose your comebacks you can just pick choose for me because you will end up with all of them either way. so when your battling look at the 3 options you have and choose the one that has the most points. you can pretty much do that with all the battles...so yeah i dont think thats very helpful but i hope it does.

wPBfydYhaa	not at all, there are missions in which requires you to go help in a dire situation or escape or do anything else, but you are never on a timer. So while a buddy is requesting your help from becoming swiss cheese you can fiddle your thumbs in the shade by a tree for days in the game world and the mission will still be active. Kinda of a shame though i would have actually wanted a timer because it could have made missions abit more difficult, especially realistic. ironic because that's one of the game biggest emphasis: realism*
3ourvbHoaa	kill everyone you see(free for all)<br>  well just conserve your ammo and since you can ambush them shoot them when they pop out,or camp,hide,wait for your enemy to come kill them when they get close,have quick reflexes,reload as fast as you can,keep your maverick loaded when you run out of ammo for your primary gun,each time you shoot someone,and find another hiding spot.(this really depends if you have a big house or an open area with hiding places or something)|`|7045569549a16a88ad40754be0b4a6f3aa	Mavericks are only good in close combat.<br>  <br>  Get the nerf longshot then do a google search for nerf modification groups. They'll show you ways to increase the power & accuracy of the gun. With a little modification you'll turn it into a good sniper rifle that can hit them from way outside of their range. Find a good hiding spot & snipe away.<br>  <br>  P.S. it also comes with 2 - 6 shot clips which are easy to reload. You can out ammo them. Even in close quarters it's good.

I posted the entire game I invented online if you're into that.    <br>  <br>  I printed the game goals on paper I "parchmented" and then stuck them in old wine bottles for effect.  <br>  <br>  To date, it has been my most successful scavenger hunt.  Not only did everyone enjoy doing the hunt, they enjoyed re-telling the stories of the crazy things that happened and sharing the crazy photos of the things they had done and the things they had seen.

Xm5ab6F6aa	I am a power seller on ebay, hopefully I can help. First email the seller and ask them for the tracking number of the package, to email that to you so you can see the shipping date. Do all of this through ebay so there is ebay internal tracking of your e-mails. The seller ships not ebay. If you bought the item from the US it takes 5 to 7 days in customs, and then sometime. If you paid with Pay Pal as you hopefully did, if you get no responce at all file a complaint with them. They are very helpful. Also you can file with ebay as well. But first get the tracking number, did you check in shipping infor on your sale to see if they attached the tracking number to that, I always do that for my customers. Do your homework first, and leave e-mail tracks. best of luck. Let me know if I can be of anymore help, just email me I ve been selling for 9 plus years!|`|C8u2jBu7aa	i woudl honestly wait a few more days, unless you paid rush delivery.

CKS6QvgGaa	I'm not for sure, but it sounds like your emulator is configured with a US BIOS file, but the disk you want to use it the Japanese version so your emulator needs the Japanese version of the BIOS. Downloading the BIOS is usually illegal,so yeah, but you can usually find them anyway, if you do put it in the file usually labeled BIOS and your emulator should be able to run the Sonic ISO.

You are lucky!|`|dz5Og81Qaa	New reproduction fabric is available so if it looks new it probably is. Depending on the quality of the work it could be worth anywhere from $200 to $500. I've seen quilts (not necessarily the same pattern) in shops in Lancaster between $500 - $750. They were very high quality.<br>  <br>  You need to find a buyer that's looking for something like this. The biggest problem is that QVC sells Chinese made quilts w/ shams, etc. for under $100. These often fall apart if you wash them. The quality is totally different from a hand made quilt sewn by an experienced quilter.|`|AA11367901	Probably $250. It seemed $150. ten years ago.

OwHwu8hpaa	This is a copy and pasted answer from one of my answers. I got best answer.<br>  <br>  It could be from moving your xbox around while the game was inside it. Im not sure about how it could be ruined any other way than that and the scratches(which you say were already there). When I got a core system(T_T*sigh*) it came with free games. My mom had no idea how a 360 functioned so she picked it up when Kameo was inside and it made a bunch of crazy sounds. When i took it out there were rings around the disk that looked like smudges. Most of my disk have that but its the only one that dosent work. I suggest going to a video rental store maybe :S they sometimes have cd repair and its cheap(bout a dollar or two). Or you can contact microsoft and ask them about it :/.<br>  <br>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^...<br>  So you could have these light scratches and thats the cause and how to fix em :D|`|0rAgtGNgaa	are you playin on the xbox or the 360?  you cannot play an xbox game on a 360 unless that game is "backwards compatible"  or a 360 game on a xbox.

There's also lots of competitions for kills and stealing cars of course.<br>  <br>  I picked up Saints Row 2 cause it claimed to have more coop mode play and more different things you could do, but right off the bat when I started playing it with my friend just felt like a cheap knock off of GTA.  <br>  <br>  If you just want a quick thrill shooting some people up really quick, then maybe Saints Row 2 could be satisfying, actually if you've never played a GTA game before it probably would seem really good, but when you've played better......you know better.|`|gRXngD9aaa	GTA IV is certainly a polished game, but it's very grey and colourless looking, and there is a fun factor missing that SR2 delivers on.<br>  <br>  Really, you need both.<br>  <br>  Check this out - <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/ten-reasons-why-saints-row-2-is-better-than-grand-theft-auto-iv-109687.phtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.destructoid.com/ten-reasons-w...</a>|`|8FlSSQIGaa	saints row 2. i bought gta4 and was bored out of my mind! apparently the game picks up after the part i got to which was like 5 hours into the game but if it takes more than 5 hours to get into a game i just dont think its worth it.
j6MvCr6Naa	1. Street Fighter IV<br>  This is definitely Capcom's best Street Fighter game ever. The graphics are amazing, the characters are 3D and superbly animated while the fighting arenas are 2D which keeps the gameplay feeling classic and makes it feel like Street Fighter. The gameplay is also a very good mix of old Street Fighter's and there's also many new gampley mechanics that make it feel nice and fresh. So, if you've never played a Street Fighter game before and don't own any games I advice you go out and get this right away.<br>  <br>  Here's the average score from different reviewes for Street Fighter IV:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/streetfighter4?q=street%20fighter%20IV" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 93% meaning that this game is brilliant.<br>  <br>  2. Resident Evil 5<br>  Here's the problem with Resident Evil 5, it wasn't made by the same people that made Resident Evil 4 and the Resident Evil 4's lead designer was not even envolved in Resident Evil 5's development. So, let me just say that Resident Evil 5 is not as good as it's predecessor, and quite far from it to be honest. The level design is lacking, many places in the game can become frustrating and Sheva's A.I. is just not good enough. You would have more fun playing this game with a friend than by yourself. This game is also not even half as long as Resident Evil 5, it's singleplayer will take you less than 10 hours to complete. It's a sham really because I was really looking forward to do this and it really doesn't live up to Resident Evil 4. <br>  <br>  Here's the average score from different reviewes for Resident Evil 5:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ps3/residentevil5?q=resident%20evil%205" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 90%, it's still a very good game but not as good as Resident Evil 4 and a bit of a dissapointment.<br>  <br>  So, all in all, I do suggest you get Resident Evil 5 over Street Fighter IV, it will keep you busy for longer and because you're a big fan of Resident Evil (like me) you will overlook many of the game's faults, but it might also leave you feeling a little dissapointed.<br>  <br>  By the way, EA's Dead Space is another game just like Resident Evil 4, but on a scary ship, in spcae, with scary zombie monsters and much better controls than Resident Evil 5. You should consider it.<br>  <br>  Here's the average score from different reviewes for Dead Space:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/deadspace?q=dead%20space" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 89%, so it's pretty much the same as Resident Evil 5, but Dead Space something fresh with many new innovative ideas that Resident Evil 5 lacks.|`|EIwMDWwVaa	Resident Evil... no question. especially if you have played them all before. If you want a good fighting game get that new Mortal Kombat vs. DC or whatever it was called. That game was amazing.|`|RM9nfIt9aa	resident evil 5 for sure ive played street fighter and it sucked|`|yJek3Pwyaa	Get Resident evil 5 <br>  <br>  I bought street fighter 4 the day it came out and I was super excited, So i started to play the game and its the exact same game as the one released in the early 90's I beat it the first try. The characters are slow and clunky you can only have like 10 places to fight. Also I was in buyers denial that the game sucked until i had my roommates play me and they were like "you seriously paid 60 bucks for a crappy game that you could just play on the internet for free the same game"<br>  <br>  Only people who enjoy this game are 30 year old video geeks that when play the game brings them back to their childhood. But really this game sucks and if you never liked or played the old ones you will be EXTREMELY disappointed.<br>  <br>  At least RE5 took long then 10 days to develop making it worth the 60 bucks.|`|885720e9d71187c0db953823eac9e0a9aa	Get Resident Evil 5! I played the demo and pre-ordered it as soon as it was available for the PS3.<br>  <br>  A fighting game, in my opinion, would be Tekken that should be coming out sometime in June... I love that series|`|o6qd2D6haa	i would suggest you just try and get resident evil 5 when it comes out i played the demo and loved it.|`|tn5GU38raa	Resident evil 5|`|7S2hQhq9aa	hmmm Resident Evil FTW.<br>  But idk street fighter has a HUGE fan base<br>  On G4 they go nuts lol<br>  Im gonna get RE5.<br>  360 FTW|`|Fd0hvyoyaa	Why do you put a capital letter at the start of every word? It is annoying. Anyways if you like resident evil that much wait for it to come out. It comes out on march 13th. Go and read some reviews and watch some videos of both games and see what one you think is best. Personally i think street fight is better.|`|4e3bf5fad31a7ed3956b4bc2c191bba5aa	Get resident evil first.  My friends waste so much time on street fighter 4 online because so many people have bad connections and they can't get into a good match.

ycicDXWwaa	First off, visit boardgamegeek.com.  I'm guessing you already have, and that's where that list came from, but you're going to get a much bigger variety of answers there, with lots of reviews and comments available.<br>  <br>  Agricola is themed about farming.  You build up a farm, trying to improve your fields, house and herds while keeping the family fed.  Its all about managing resources - lots of resouces to try to accomplish lots of things.  Its a great game - lots of variety and depth.  Its got a family variant that's easy to learn, and a good solo varient.  It plays best with 2-4 players.  You can play with 5, but it slows down a lot with 5 new players.<br>  <br>  El Grande is about vying for control of Spain.  Its the most confrontational of these games; you try to get majority control in areas to score points.  There aren't really resources to manage here, but there's bidding for turn order and deciding which actions and abilities to use.<br>  <br>  Caylus is a very intense game with lots of long range planning.  Gather resources, build buildings that you or other players can use, cash in resources to score points.<br>  <br>  Power Grid has bidding and economic management.  You'll race against players from prime locations and resources, and struggle to pick the best power plants.<br>  <br>  All good games.<br>  <br>  My personal preference on those would be:<br>  1 - Agricola<br>  2 - El Grande<br>  3 - Power Grid<br>  4 - Caylus|`|AwZt6XZnaa	AGRICOLA<br>  <a href="http://www.boardgameratings.com/product_page.php?game_id=3202" rel="nofollow">http://www.boardgameratings.com/product_...</a><br>  <br>  EL GRANDE (note that it is out of stock, but you can request it)<br>  <a href="http://www.boardgameratings.com/product_page.php?game_id=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.boardgameratings.com/product_...</a><br>  <br>  CAYLUS <a href="http://www.boardgameratings.com/product_page.php?game_id=180" rel="nofollow">http://www.boardgameratings.com/product_...</a><br>  <br>  POWER GRID<br>  <a href="http://www.boardgameratings.com/product_page.php?game_id=143" rel="nofollow">http://www.boardgameratings.com/product_...</a>
hbCsywh0aa	i suppose if you take things into heart and go kill people like in games, then sur it bad. if you just enjoy the games, then it really wouldn't be.|`|3LQ4Dm0uaa	no, don't listen to your pastor.  Halo 3 is a strategy game above all else.  It doesn't really have much violence in it besides the killing, and even those aren't really gruesome.  And i think it's funny that the church has a problem with killing, since more deaths have been caused by religious struggles than any other save disease.  But i don't want to turn this into a religious battle.  that what R&S is for on this answer site.  As long as you don't go sniping people or killing them with an energy sword you should be fine.|`|GJycKc5Laa	no they arent|`|TmWTesu1aa	no because video games are just well video games it's like it never happened.You didn't kill anyone.|`|crZg76Hpaa	It's against the eleventh commandment.|`|JhOUUdEuaa	ARE YOU INSANE  NO!

YHu0s3JZaa	KillZone 2 has received a perfect score so far.<br>  It has an excellent story line. And the online multiplayer is excellent. <br>  In COD: WAW, the single player is also very good.

COD has all the ww2 guns obviously, But killzone 2 has all the modern day guns, except for the electric and jolt gun, but if you want online and a good campaign, you have to get killzone, because the online keeps you going forever, without ever actually stopping. They take all the online modes and mash it into one giant game, where if your done with one objective you just move onto the next, and the campaign is amazing, the characters arent all that great but otherwise that, its amazing!!! get killzone.|`|QwLlZ1M6aa	take it from someone who has played both online and campaign on both games. i would recommend Killzone 2 because its been one of the most anticipated games on the PS3 since it has came out and it has amazing graphics, a pretty good campaign with lots of action, and online is fun there's 8 maps with about 5 or 6 modes and since you like to play online a lot there's a lots of people online more then cod waw has right now i bet. cod waw is pretty good but the campaign is weird because its like a few mini stories together and online is pretty fun but not as great as cod4 or killzone 2. the only good thing about cod waw is that it has spilt screen and a zombie mode after you beat the game. but the one problem is that spilt screen is displayed weird it isn't half the screen like most games with spilt screen its just a small square on top of each other. but in overall i would recommend Killzone 2 because of its amazing graphics, good gameplay, and fun online modes. i hope this helped you make your decision and if you buy killzone 2 and need someone to play wit my PSN ID is Mexico619|`|akXn2IS9aa	I picked up killzone 2 yesterday and beat it before I went to bed...Killzone 2 is ok, If your used to cod you prolly won't like the movements or the button layout of killzone 2.

(story is pretty lame and no where near the brilliance of 4)<br>  Meanwhile KZ2 has an epic storyline (bit of a anit climax at the end. But the rest is amazing).<br>  Also online works really well, you just have to be patient to unlock better weps and abilities|`|4SPglPKnaa	Killzone 2 is so awsomely awsome!!! If you can only get one, get Killzone 2!! It is crazy awsome. The online is so crazy and the single player is awsome. It's really long too. Also the graphics are insane!|`|0g0Ju1Vgaa	You should get WAW very interactive. The online is also great, tip if your getting it for WII don't finish campain unless you cant Connect to internet cause the reward for the xbox verison (nazi zombies) is not available for wii.|`|26xMlqv5aa	dude i would get COD modern warfare. i have COD WAW and its kinda lame. there are fun parts in it but MW has a better story line and its just more fun. kill zone 2 is OK but i am a huge fan of COD|`|WzjNdNtoaa	Killzone 2, WITHOUT A DOUBT.<br>  <br>  Godly game... You will not regret it, and it just came out today so you better go get it! You might be able to snag yourself a copy before it's all sold out!

The blackglasses is near the nerd - you can either use the itemfinder to get for it or stand two steps below the stairs and take one step left and press A.<br>  5. You can show talk to the guy again <br>  6. and you get to keep it|`|VSHvyDozaa	1. Go to cave in Verdanturf Town- the Rusturf Tunnel. <br>  2. Don't go up the stairs but turn left and follow the road and go outside.<br>  3. You'll find the person.<br>  4.

You can show talk to the guy again and then he leaves.
odu4jOx3aa	its a great idea! you should defffff do it. theyre way fun.<br>  <br>  you get two teams and you both have the same list of things.  since you can't drive, that's gonna limit you... so you'll just have to be creative with your lists.  you have a set amount of time and at the end of that time you compare what you did and didnt do (with photographic evidence)... everything is worth pre-set point values.  and its just a way fun time
XDEqewDvaa	i don'tt think u can do that i know u can with cd like copy the songs into hard drive but all u can do with usb is hook it up and hear the songs like form it|`|qYsR9Drsaa	I'm going to try that today.

SVtZIBVxaa	not really, but on the show if u want to catch up, then you watch them on like youtube or sumin. But u don't really miss anything. But if it's talking about Chad Micheal Cooper (Sterling Knight), then u might want to go back..|`|kV49h0xzaa	No and yes.....you can figure out probley what happened in the last episode...its not like your totally lost if you miss one....you just might not get all the jokes....I have seen only 2 adne neither talk about past episodes....so Kinda NO|`|l8xi0rkvaa	maybe but just to let u know i dont want to be mean or anything but ur in game question catagory
AA12165015	Yahoo games and rooms open with a pop up.  Turning  off the pop up blockers like Yahoo  says doesn't work very well!  Most tool bars like yahoo and Internet explorer have pop up blockers! When you try getting in lounge or room and it doesn't work. click on pop up blocker on yahoo tool bar. On the drop down list click on Always allow tab it will say recent pop ups blocked. high light Yahoo.com then click allow. On Google  blocker click on blocker and  it will allow site.<br>  . IE browser settings to allow pop ups Right click on Tools, Internet options, privacy tab, cookie over ride. Type in www. Yahoo.com, allow then OK.  If your tool bar has a blue gear with tools beside it, Click on it and a drop down list will have pop up blocker listed.Type in www.yahoo.com, click allow.  It is rare but sometimes the demo can go bad. To check, click Tools, Internet Options, Click Browser settings ,Then view objects. If any are bad it will say corrupted instead of installed. If bad delete it  and load the new demo next time you play.<br>   This is the proper way to use the pop up blocker. I have never had a problem or had to hold  any keys down to get in.  1st thing you do when you get in lounge is check small windows in options box. Once in room make sure you expand it to see chat area. You only see top half of the cards but you can still play. This also gets rid of the big ads at the top of the rooms.
