Ok, so i am going on my first date since i left the father of my children and since i found out 3 years ago, a few months after i met the father of my children, that he gave me herpes. Now i know this is not something u address on a first date but should it come to the eventually i have no idea how to tell someone that i have it. i'm so afraid i'm going to be rejected because of it, like the guys is gunna freak out and not want anything to do with me, which i'm sure some people would do, but with 1 in 5 people having someone has to be accepting of it.... anyways does anyone have any suggestions about how to tell someone that i have it and hopefully not freak them out. Not that it makes a difference because u can still spread it even if your not having an out break but i haven't had any problems in three years. Does anyone have any personal experience with the same situation?

20090307195212AALZzRr	Health;Diet & Fitness	A question about mass/weight gainers.?	I do not want any posts saying " eat real food" "dont take mass gainers" and stuff like that. It will simply be ignored.      Hi, This is a question for bodybuilders and someone that knows what he or she is talking about.      I have been taking my mass gainer for a while now. I have been doing experiments.    On the label, it says to take your first serving in between meals, and second serving after your workout.      I have switched my first serving to morning, meaning I would drink one as soon as I wake up.      I believe drinking in the morning is better because your body needs nutrients in the morning, and the mass gainer will absorb into your body faster than solid food. I find it pointless to consume your gainer in between meals.      My question is, is it better to stick with the label.   Or my changes in taking my first serving to in the morning a more effective way than taking in between meals.      Thank you.      Tell me your thoughts, I appreciate it.

20090227101558AAfbYyR	Health;Diet & Fitness	What protein supplements would you recommend?	I have just started working out again with weights. I haven't for about 7 years now. I worked out with my dad from the time I was 15 until I was 19. I loved it and I have started back up again. The great thing is I haven't lost my muscle. It is still there, and still pretty firm. I have lost some of my of strength though. The bad thing is I have put on some weight. I have a layer of fat over my nice firm muscles. I am wanting to get rid of the fat, but I don't need to bulk up anymore. I just want to see the muscle tone I already have, and improve on it a bit. I bought the Weider Total Body 5000 which is awesome! I love it! I want to use a good supplement to help feed my muscles and burn up the fat. Any suggestions? Maybe a good protein shake for dinner before or after my work out?

20090227100244AAd5SgM	Health;Other - Health	How to overcome the fear of needles?	Ok, so first off, don't answer if you say needles don't hurt or anything else like that. Because i really don't care what you think if that's what your gonna say. I'm not so much afraid of the sight of a needle  it is more of the injection and pain. It hurts and i don't know if it's just because i'm sensitive or what ever, but i just start crying if you say i need to be injected or need blood drawn. I've tried to not think of it, count backwards, not look, ice my arm, and a bunch of other stuff. I don't look, and i try not to think about it but that doesn't work. I don't know what to do. I'm tired of being afraid, and i doubt i will be able to be hypnotized so that's not really an option.

When we went to change positions we noticed that the condom had broke! He had not yet ejaculated, but I've read way too many questions on here that refer back to "pre-***" and know that there is still the posibility that seman got into my vagina.      Anyways heres the problem I recently started the birth control patch, and have been on it for the past two weeks. Now the patch claims to be 99 % effective after one week of use  which is something I don't trust. Also during my first week on gan to the patch it began to come lose and as a result I had to keep it stuck which medical tape and am not sure how effective that method was.      Being so unsure of my birth control I decided to take plan be within about5-6 hours of the condom breaking. I know it's 95 perecent effective but Im still stressing out! Also this sounds horrible but a month ago our condom broke and seeing as I was not on BC I had to take Plan B.       What are the risks of taking Plan B so oftten? If there are any?       and do you think that I am pregnant?      ALL opinions and advice welcome!      Thank you in advance :)

Hi there guys,   I'd like to slim down my arms and stomach, they're fatty and very not proportioned to the rest of my body.   I generally hate exercising, especially ones that require running/jogging.    I was thinking of simple exercises such as walking for half an hour, doing jumping jacks, table tennis and hula-hooping. Yes i like low-key exercising routines.      But i'm not sure if they're effective to slim down arms? I know you can't aim to lose weight in just one area, but say, would hula hooping actually slim down arms?! O_O      And how long do i need to do these activities for? Thanks everyone!

20090227110617AAuraId	Health;Diet & Fitness	Help make my workouts work?	Hello all! I need tips, tricks, suggestions and answers to a bunch of questions I've had since I started to work out to get in shape (my new year's resolution.)      I'm 5'8.5", and started the year at 185lbs (in January.) I try to be at the gym every day (at least 5 times a week), and my usual routine involves 15 minutes of running (on a track, 3km), 33 minutes on the elliptical machine (500 calories), 30-45 minutes swimming (keeping good pace), and fencing practice (read: swordplay) 3 nights a week. Oh, and I eat fairly well, I'd say. Between 2000-2500 calories a day, home cooked and healthy.      Now, I've gotten a few questions. First off, my weight hasn't changed, pretty much at all. I've been at it almost two months, and still pretty much 185lbs. I can DEFINITELY perform a lot better athletically (my original workouts were nowhere near as long or intense as they are now), and I THINK I look slightly better and the clothes fit more nicely (I am really sorry I didn't actually measure dimensions before starting), but it's a bit annoying, since I'd like to drop weight (I have been down to 165-170 only a year or two ago.) Some friends keep quoting "Oh, you're probably gaining muscle, it weighs more than fat", but what are the odds I'm trading them off pound for pound? Any suggestions?      On a related note, should I be doing weights to lose weight? I'm pretty sure the majority of advice out there suggests aerobic exercise to lose weight, but I figured I'd ask anyways.      I'm strictly working out for weight loss, not trying to get big muscles or anything. Some places I've read say that you need to rest the muscles you work out, or alternate the areas you target, and shouldn't work them out every day, but is that just for 'bulking up', or is it actually a bad idea to be at the gym every day?      On the elliptical machine, the target heart rate for the 'weight loss' zone is WAY lower than for cardio. Am I actually reducing my weight loss by working out at a higher heart rate?      I know it's a long post. Thanks in advance!

Around half way I had a sudden headache, a really hurtful one too. I had to stop and hold on to my head because it hurt so bad. The pain lasted for around 30seconds - 2min. The pain was none that I have ever felt in my head before. The pain slowly died off..But even up to today, this morning, the pain lingers in my head and its annoying me. I already took some Advil, and that did not work at all.      Please help..

My husband has been given Vicodin hasn't actually started taking them. They are there for his arm he hurt. I want to switch them in case he ever starts taking them. Perhaps there is an Ibuprofen or other lesser addictive pill that looks like vicodin so I can switch it. For now he says he won't use them but he has a past history of drug abuse...please give me some suggestions!!!

I have had no luck.  Intercourse is painful in positions that allow for deeper penetration, my periods are off, usually get them every month and a half...and when i do get them they are heavy, clotted, and painful.  At any given time, even when im not on my period, I get slight pains that range from mild to severe, but just shooting pains, nothing thats is persistant.        Will my health insurance cover for me to get checked and cured if this is the case.. I really can't afford to spend a lot of money on medical at this time, but I want this to be over with and I want to conceive.       We have decided to wait for another 6 months to try again, as we are financially strapped at this time, so I want to be able to go into this knowing I am healthy and ready.

20090307203123AANlPLo	Health;Diet & Fitness	How did I gain this weight?	I do Crossfit three days a week, I run two days a week, and I stick to a healthy "grazing" style diet of lean meats, veggies, nuts and fruit.  I drink about four to five bottles of water per day.  The only other thing I drink is diet soda, about two per day, and coffee, one cup in the morning.  The sugar in the coffee (about two teaspoons) is the only processed sugar I eat.      I'm new to Crossfit, just started two weeks ago.      In those two weeks I've gained six pounds.        I'd love to think its all muscle, but I know that kind of gain is basically impossible.  Is it water weight?  Why?  Can't be body fat could it?  I probably only put down about 2200 - 2500 calories per day and I'm 6'2" tall.

(I'm 5'5) It’s been more than a month and I’m NOT losing anymore weight ! I’ve changed my exercise patterns, and increased my level of training and even joined boxfit classes which I didn’t do from October to January !   I exercise EVERY single day for about 45 mins. I used to do the same before, but I've made it more intense.      I’ve even changed my eating habits, I used to eat baked chicken, cooked veggies, special K cereal, fruits and eggs with yolk (from Oct-Jan). I thought I needed to change my diet to keep losing weight. So for about a month now I eat egg whites, chick peas, whole wheat bread, and fruits. I think I’ve changed so much in my diet and exercise that I should be out of the plateau by now! But it’s not working and I want to weigh 130 lbs by March 16th!      HELP ME PLEASE.. I HATE LOOKING IN THE MIRROR EVERYDAY =(
20090307204342AA71IP6	Health;Diet & Fitness	Easy question if you're a fitness expert?	Like many people, I want to lose weight as quickly as possible. I only need to lose 25 pounds, and I say "only" because some people need to lose 200+, so 25 shouldn't be hard, but it is.      I just want to know how I can lose weight. I can obviously find ways to do my own cardio, but how much daily and how many days per week?      Also, I can't do strength training with professional machines, so what daily exercises could help develop muscle (since it burns fat)? Push ups or something I can do without any special equipment?      Diet suggestions are welcome too, but not necessary. I know 64-84 ounces of water is good and fruits and veggies too.      Answer as much as you know to help me out. I want to look good for swimsuit season.      I am a female, 5'10" if that helps.

20090307204226AA5XDcI	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Can my poor posture be causing my occasional bouts of lower back pain?	Hi im 21, and I admit my posture is bad especially on the couch when laying down i tend to put lots of pressure on my back and even when i sit by habit i tend to lean forwards. I noticed that occasionally if i laid flat down and got up quickly id feel a quick snap in my lower back, and if i was in that bad lying position id feel it a bit. One day at work i lifted something heavy ( a huge box with a heavy printer) I lifted it wrong, and lost my balance and as the box fell, I felt a really bad pain in my lower back. It went a way after a few mins, but then a few days later I woke up with a strong backache. It was so strong that i could barely move, and when i was able to stand up it felt like all my body's weight was crashing down on my spine and as if i lost back support. After a day the pain went away though. A few months later i had a smiliar backache again, but since then my backs been fine, but when i do have bad posture i occasionally feel a little pain in the same spot. But over all my back is fine now and i dont really feel any pain at all. I was worried it coulda been something bad but id think the pain wouldnt go away if it was something serious. id go to a doctor but everytime i got to doctors with symptoms they just say its nothing im too young to be sick and cast me away lol. This ever happen to anyone? Backaches suck :/

Hello, I'm 15 years old, and all my life I've gotten straight A's, been a runner & very thin, and never felt pretty enough for other people.   I have a fraternal twin sister, and she and I look/act completely different (she plays the "popular sports", I do the ones no one cares about; she has dark brown hair, I have a lighter brown; guys can't stop talking to her due to her confidence and "outgoingness" where as guys sometimes talk to me since I'm shyer and more hidden).   Obviously, I unhealthily envy my sister but I don't think that quite all it.   For about a year and a half I've been diving in and out of depression and it's gotten worse since high school started, even though more guys are talking to me.   I constantly compare myself to other people which I know is bad, but isn't running supposed to make you feel good about yourself? I've gone to state in cross country as a freshman and run all year round, but still, I'm like this...   Honestly, I feel like everything about me is good (my grades, my running ability, my body shape, my weight) except my social life and appearance because I never seem to have it just right.   Some days I feel on top and the world and gorgeous, and others I feel incredibly worthless.   Sorry about this long post, but please tell me what's wrong and what can be done?

20090307204154AAxw6jU	Health;Mental Health	Years ago I was addicted to The Sims 2.. I think I can handle The Sims 3 but should I risk it?	Several years ago I was seriously addicted to The Sims 2.. I played it so much that I stopped taking steps to improve myself.. stopped reading, stopped writing, stopped eating well, stopped exercising. I also neglected pets and schoolwork, which I regret every day.  I think my addiction may have been one factor in a particularly bad bout of of major depression.      I'm 24 now, and I'm in college and have since developed healthy habits. I dropped pc/video games almost 100%.. I've had the sims 2 installed on my computer all this time and I haven't played it in over a year. I plan to only play a maximum of 2 hours of TS3 at a time, 3-4 times a week, after homework. I also plan to use it to reward myself after a job well done on exams, research papers, etc.      My husband isn't sure if it's a good idea, though he doesn't see a problem with my gaming hobby in general.. To quote him, he just doesn't want to "hear me whine" about how I'm wasting my life with video games. I do see his point.      I played World of Warcraft for a couple years but I stopped when it consumed too much of my time. However, I never actually became *addicted* to that game, I just played it a bunch because of guild obligations. I had no problems stopping.      I really want to try The Sims 3, but do you think I can handle it? Or do you think I'll fall back into old habits?

It feels almost like a brain freeze in my temples when i do. I have had headaches for years, and i have been told that if they continue much longer that i should get an MRI.

20090307210113AAMzlb3	Health;Mental Health	How can I get a guy who's depressed to listen?	An Ex who I really care about has had depression for over 8yrs now. I have known him for 12months. We never had a normal relationship because of his depression and we constantly argued and said things which really hurt us both.       He would ask for my help as he wanted to recover from his depression, however, it all got a bit too much for me from time to time as he would do and say things which would hurt me. I used to tell myself that he didn't mean to say or do those things and that it was his depression taking control of him and his thoughts. And after a while when I could no longer bare the hurt and pain I would snap and out of anger and hurt I would say really nasty things to him which I knew would hurt him and put him down. Though I never mean't what I said, I felt bad afterwards.       Sometimes I think that he's faking his condition but other times I think it's for real because I see him hit himself many times and that's not normal.      So anyway, now he hates me and wants me out of his life. And so do his family and friends. However, I really want to help him but I need him to forgive me and trust me. I want to send him to see a professional but how when he doesn't want to talk to me?      So how can I get him to listen to me and get him to understand that I want to help him, that I have been trying to help him and how can I get his trust back and get him to forgive me?

20090307214726AA4GhaH	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	What could this mean?	Back in the fall, i had a very bad case of bacteria pneumonia.   I even had a thin wall abscess in my right lung.   The doctors fought over whether i should be in  the hospital but since i looked okay and i could breathe fine, i was put on strong antibiotics for a month.      Earlier this week, i began to develop a cough.   This morning i cough into a tissue to see bright red blood.   About the size of a quarter.   i'm 17 so i went to the pediatrician and they put me back on antibiotics and told me to get a chest xray next week.      But they never really cleared up where the blood was coming from. Even now i'm still coughing up little dime sizes of blood.   could this be something from my previous pneumonia?      Also, i work at a vets office and wonder if this could have anything to do with my recent lung/health problems.   I worked there since june of 07       If anyone could offer help and put my mind at ease, i'd be so thankful

20090307215446AAFyNmV	Health;Dental	Recent fillings//possible infection? How can I tell? :(?	I recently had a silver filling done (upper right) - the tooth was broken, but my dentist was able to fix it up without having to extract the tooth.      Anyways, a few days later, my entire right side hurt - all my teeth ached, even the lower teeth which he didn't even touch. My gums on the right side also started aching, and all the teeth on the right were extra sensitive. I figured this was normal.      But a week passed and the pain got worse - the dentist put me on Clindamycin which i stopped taking (bad side effects). The clindamycin helped with the pain, but I couldn't handle it. It's been almost 3 weeks since and now, the entire right side is numb and achy.       Is it possible its infected, is it a side effect from the anesthesia? It aches, painkillers help, but it's bothersome.       Any advice//suggestions ?      Thank you :)

OKay so this has been going on for years now, I'm almost 16 and for about the past 2 years its really escalated. my mother is nice sometimes and tells me im a good kid and cooks and sometimes even cleans  a little. that could last for maybe a month or two if were lucky. however, this never lasts because she always ends up getting violently angry over literally nothing. for example, last thursday, i was sitting and watching tv in her room (which im allowed to and always have been so i wasnt doing anything rong) . i was tired from last night cuz i stayed up till 4 am doing an essay and studying for a test. (thats her fault because she put me in such a hard schooll) and she told me from her room to go make the salmon for dinner, which is not my job. i explained to her i was tired from being up so late. so she comes in and starts screaming, it turns scary. "GET OUT OF MY ROOM NOW GO U DONT DO ANYTHING FOR ME U SICK KIDS I HATE U SO MUCH I MUST HAVE SINNED SO MUCH THAT GOD MADE ME HAVE U AND UR SISTER I HATE YOU GET OUT RIGHT NOW" this doesnt scare me like it would someone else who isnt abused so much, so i said "what are u gonna do abt it" and then she starts BEATING ME with the remote control and punching me and it really hurt. now im bruised all over. she alwways screams at us and says things like "YOUR BROTHERS ARE THE ONLY GOOD ONES. U AND UR SISTER ARE SUCH BAD KIDS" but in actuallity, were wonderful kids, high avgs, no drugs, drinking, slutty behavior, or anything. and then after she stopped hitting me once i started crying she said "GET OUT NOW" she was so madd her eyes were litterally red and she was breathing really heavily and angrily, i said "No." very calmly. and then she said "WAT DO U WANT ME TO DO. HIT MYSELF?" and i said , rly sarcastically almost laughing "sure" so she starts hitting herself on the head REALLY HARD with the remote, and her head started to bleed then she starts screaming again "LOOK WAT U DID TO ME U WANT ME TO DIE. UD BE SO MUCH HAPPIER IF I JUST KILLED MYSELF" then she ran into her room , locked it, and started crying really loudly. it was really sad. she always talks abt killing herself and everyone hating her wen we NEVER EVER said she should commit suicide. she believes things ppl never said, and she always thinks shes right and has no flaws, which is the scariest thing. i really think shes insane, and i have talkd to her about it. i told her she needs therapy and she refuses and starts crying everytime i nicely tell her to get help b/c it could be good for her. oh and about a month every year for the past 5 years shes rented a place and moved out and says shes getting a divorce and comes in before she leaves and says to me  "ii want u to kno that im leaving because u abuse me and ud be much happier if i were dead" shes in the process of packing her stuff right now. and that type of scenario abt the beating and screaming happens everyday, witthout aggravation. my dad becomes severly depressed wenever she leaves even tho shes mean to him too, so he naturally, takes it out on me and my sister. he stops cooking and doing anything for us, just sits in the dark from the time he comes home, around 6 to the time he sleeps, 12. she came in and asked me today why i was mad at her and i told her abt the abuse and how she has no respect for me and never listens to anyone else and she says "I DONT HAVE TO RESPECT U. U GARBAGE KID U ALWAYS CALL ME CRAZY I WANT TO DIE." she thinks, me saying she needs mental help is worse than her saying she hopes i have a horrible life and wishing i was never born. i dont kno wat to do. is she insane or is this not that abnormal? ah.help =[

OK please DONT copy paste anxiety symptoms off a web site, I know most of them, but what I don't see on nearly every list is the particular problem I have, I have been "working" on my social anxiety issues, things like inderal work great but I don't take it often, natural remedies like a magnesium drink to relax muscles and a "nerve blend" with valerian, passion flower, chamomile etc. with ok results nothing great like inderal, I'm considering getting a Rx for xanax for really bad days I know I will have to go through "as needed", either way, I have gotten sweating heart pounding and tremors under control by working out and building up confidence, one thing I can't control which is the WORST thing about my anxiety is loss of facial muscle control, I can feel my cheek shake as I awkwardly smile, sometimes I have to tell myself to stop smiling, the only way I really control myself is by not getting involved in the conversation in a group at all, which I find difficult since I'm a talkative guy, but once I start talking and eyes are on me, I can't resist smiling, I believe my eyebrows shake, and that my cheeks shake too, anyone else experience this or seen or heard of this symptom or have a solution? (nobody has actually told me I have these "facial spasms" but I can feel my cheeks shaking, I can't feel my eyebrows move but I see people look directly at them and thats when I'm feeling anxious inside, it can't be a coincidence every time with several different people, I'm certain it is happening and please ASSUME it is when answering, have you actually seen/heard of/experienced this type of symptom with anxiety?).

Study:    Fellatio may significantly decrease the risk of breast cancer in women    Thursday, October 2, 2003 Posted: 9:19 AM EDT (1319 GMT)                                 (AP) -- Women who perform the act of fellatio and swallow semen on a regular basis, one to two times a week, may reduce their risk of breast cancer by up to 40 percent, a North Carolina State University study found.    Doctors had never suspected a link between the act of fellatio and breast cancer, but new research being performed at North Carolina State University is starting to suggest that there could be an important link between the two.    In a study of over 15,000 women suspected of having performed regular fellatio and swallowed the ejaculatory fluid, over the past ten years, the researchers found that those actually having performed the act regularly, one to two times a week, had a lower occurrence of breast cancer than those who had not. There was no increased risk, however, for those who did not regularly perform.    "I think it removes the last shade of doubt that fellatio is actually a healthy act," said Dr. A.J. Kramer of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. "I am surprised by these findings, but am also excited that the researchers may have discovered a relatively easy way to lower the occurrence of breast cancer in women."    The University researchers stressed that, though breast cancer is relatively uncommon, any steps taken to reduce the risk would be a wise decision.    "Only with regular occurrence will your chances be reduced, so I encourage all women out there to make fellatio an important part of their daily routine," said Dr.. Helena Shifteer, one of the researchers at the University. "Since the emergence of the research, I try to fellate at least once every other night to reduce my chances."    The study is reported in Friday's Journal of Medical Research.    In 1991, 43,582 women died of breast cancer, as reported by the National Cancer Institute.    Dr. Len Lictepeen, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said women should not overlook or "play down" these findings.    "This will hopefully change women's practice and patterns, resulting in a severe drop in the future number of cases," Lictepeen said.    Sooner said the research shows no increase in the risk of breast cancer in those who are, for whatever reason, not able to fellate regularly.    "There's definitely fertile ground for more research. Many have stepped forward to volunteer for related research now in the planning stages," he said.    Almost every woman is, at some point, going to perform the act of fellatio, but it is the frequency at which this event occurs that makes the difference, say researchers. Also key seems to be the protein and enzyme count in the semen, but researchers are again waiting for more test data.    The reasearch consisted of two groups, 6,246 women ages 25 to 45 who had performed fellatio and swallowed on a regular basis over the past five to ten years, and 9,728 women who had not or did not swallow. The group of women who had performed and swallowed had a breast cancer rate of 1.9 percent and the group who had not had a breast cancer rate of 10.4 percent.    "The findings do suggest that there are other causes for breast cancer besides the absence of regular fellatio," Shafteer said. "It's a cause, not THE cause."                                        --------------------------------------...               --------------------------------------...      8 Images | View Slideshow | Download Selected | Download All                 ATT332562.gif   (1KB)         ATT332563.gif   (2KB)         ATT332564.gif   (1KB)            ATT332566.gif   (1KB)         ATT332567.gif   (1KB)         ATT332568.gif   (1KB)            ATT332569.gif   (1KB)         ATT332570.gif   (2KB)

20090307212058AADM6XV	Health;Women's Health	3 day monistat treatment?	I used to get yeast infections a bit when I first hurt puberty. I had one about a year ago, and did the 1 day treatment. I was in such much pain after the treatment, but the infection seemed to go away. I promised myself, however, that I would NEVER do the 1day again.       So, it's been a rough couple of weeks. I had strep throat, had to take antibiotics for that. I was very good about having yogurts with acidophillus, but I still ended up with a yeast infection!!!!       Anyway, I started the Three day treatment today. I put it in and it was HURTING so bad. I put some lube on it, I am a virgin, and it hurts to insert it, so that is my first issue. Then, after...oh boy, it STUNG and itched so bad. For about 45 minutes after. It's now been over an hour, and I am finally starting to get some relief....      My question is---   This treatment was AWFUL, does the first tend to hurt more then the followups? In the future, if this happens again, would it be better for me to 7day (smaller dose at a time?) is this normal?       Thanks!

20090307212411AA5KCub	Health;Mental Health	Suicidal thoughts wont go away?	I have struggled with suicidal urges most of my life.  The earliest were when I was in 3rd grade.  As I got older, they became more and more prevalent.  High school got particularly bad and I began stock piling pills.  I kept putting it off, telling myself I didn't want to hurt my grand-parents, and I kept telling myself that adolescence sucks anyway so once I get into my 20's things will get better.  As I am nearing 30, my mental disposition has not changed.  Therapy hasn't helped much, the antidepressants made me a slug, incapable of working, school or even keeping a cohesive thought.  I have my good days, then I have my regular days...then there are the bad days.  But it doesn't matter how good my day is, that gnawing sensation is always there urging me to end my life, and practically screams at me on my bad days.  The thought of it used to make me sad, make me cry, but these days it doesn't and I feel more and more like giving in since it seems that's the only way it'll shut the hell up.  I feel totally alone;  tried to talk to my mother about it several times, with disastrous results; my counselor just put me on pills that made me incapable of feeling and doing anything (hard to go to work if you don't care about anything)      Am I crazy?  Am I alone? Is there a support group? some mystery diet to balance the brain chemistry and take this away?

Well, I started getting a headache when the aura started, and it had stayed with me and increased in pain for the past 10 hours.  I just sneezed and it hurt really bad.  Well, that is when it hurts the most.  I have heard that migraines are very painful constant nauseating headaches that are really intense.  Well, this one hasn't  been that, just a dull ache until I cough hard for sneeze or bend over then it stabs in same spot on the right side of me head.   So, is this actually a migraine that my aura warned me about or something else?

I do not know for sure if they are menstrual related, but they do occur about 2 days a week for the three weeks before my period (Will have period for 1 week w/o cramps, after period 1 week w/o cramps, but then 2-3 weeks w/ severe pain at least 2 days per week).

Also, after sitting in the same position for a long while I see the same dots. If I have a long shower (when I'm washing my hair, for example) I start to feel nauseus (I usually don't let myself take that long, though). As time passes I feel more and more nauseus until I start to feel dizzy and fatigued. I let this go too far once, and my vision started to blank out and my legs felt very weak. I've never passed out before but I knew I was about to faint, so I quickly ran to my room and fell onto my bed. I didn't pass out (because I layed down), and I fully recovered after lying down. I have very very pale skin that doesn't seem to change colour even when I'm sunburnt. It's apparenly been very hot, but I've been going around feeling cold with jumpers and long pants on. I didn't have a temperature. I get headaches more often than I should, sometimes every day. I often get sensations in my legs such as itching, tingling and stings which forces me to twitch or move or scratch my legs (could this be restless legs syndrome, often assosiated with anemia?) . When I run, or do other strenuous excerises I find it hard to breathe properly, like my throat is tight but it isn't....and I don't have asthma. sometimes I can't breathe in fully, I 'hit a brick wall' and can't get that satisfaction of breathing deeply. This often leads to constant yawning, in which I cannot complete the yawn. I have been depressed for no reason and I am incredibly irritable.   I'm sorry I made it so long...lol

So whatever, I went to the ER, they took blood tests, X-Rays, and EKGs and found no issues whatsoever.      So they told me to go to a physician. But I have no insurance and really low income so I don't know what to do at this point.         Does/Has anyone else had or have this problem?      Any feedback will help, please and thank you.

I just purchased new frames and lenses, now I could have gotten the very same frames online for $150 (no tax and after shipping) and then taken my frames to a costco and paid $115 for thin lenses with anti glare +$18 (for having my own frames!!!), totalling $283, INSTEAD I went into a local optometrists office in a mall near LA and bargained for the same frames with thin lenses (no anti glare) for $270, my size wasn't in the office so the lady "special ordered" them, which shipping means an extra $10 at MOST, I knew she would use it as an excuse to jack up the price, so she goes to $310, I stuck to $270 and she came down to $290 and we agree, so its 10 bucks more than if I was to do this online and with costco BUT WITHOUT anti glare which I would get with costco for $10 more, so today my frames came in and they are half framed glasses, so she lets me know it might end up a little thick, tells me for an extra 20 she can do thinner, I said that I thought the price negotiated WAS for the thin ones, she said yea those thin ones might still be thick for your prescription, the ones that are $20 more are polycarbonate "1" which she says are thinner than regular polycarbonate, so I'm like whatever and I agree, my total was supposed to be $270, became $290 and now its $310, then I think since I'm spending this kind of dough I'd might as well get anti glare, now I know anti glare is just a simple coating on the lenses, probably costs them next to NOTHING to put it on, - labor and materials, but they charge $80 for it, and I tell her to do it for $40 and I'll get it, she says $50, at at $45 we agree, so my total is $355!!! am I a moron? I don't like costco killing these private optometrists but damn $283---->$355, thats not a small amount of money for me, my frames were Jhane Barnes, with the optometrist I get peace of mind knowing the frames are real as opposed to online, and I worry about the quality of costco lenses   1) should I have gone with costco and the online shop instead?   2) have you bought eyeglass lenses from costco? is the quality any different from your average optometrists lenses?   3) is there different stages of thin lenses like "Polycarbonate 1" being thinner than polycarbonate? or did she just make it up to boost the price 20 bucks?   4) does the anti glare coating have any real value? this is a question that people who have worked for optometrists would know the "real" value of this coating, I'm betting even though its convenient and works great for people with glasses, the actual cost of doing it is nothing so its probably one of the most profitable things for an optometrists office charging $80 to coat lenses with anti glare, even at $45, did I get a fair price?   she mentioned several times that she could "get in trouble" for giving me such a good deal and it almost made me want to laugh (not just because I didn't believe her), but I could have sat there and explained that I would have saved $85 if I walked away and went to costco.

20090227111205AA0UwNk	Health;Diet & Fitness	What am I doing wrong?	I've been working out for about 6 weeks now and haven't lost any weight or noticed much improvement. My main concern is losing my belly fat and love handles so I focus on the treadmill. I always leave the incline to the maximum level. In the first few weeks I focused on jogging and increased my ability from 1 minute to about 4 minutes then I started about three weeks ago to run sprints where I would run 30 secs at one level and then 30 seconds at a higher level and 30 more at a higher taking breathers in between and then repeat these 3 levels and I've increased only slightly in my performance. I've lost no weight in these past 6 weeks and use this damn thing almost every day for at least 20 minutes a day. Does anyone have a suggestion to improve my routine? Is running on the incline always better? Any insight is much appreciated.

20090308000150AA6lWS7	Health;Mental Health	Is it possible for my mom to think she is having pain in her eyes that isn't real?	It isn't certain what psychological problems my mom has, as she leads a life of intense denial and absolutely refuses to get any sort of help, but we believe she is a paranoid schizophrenic among other things (depression, anxiety, etc) She also used to be an alcoholic and have a problem abusing prescription drugs. Anyway, during the last few years, my mom seems to be creating new problems to deal with that are increasingly worse. The last big thing I had to deal with from her was that she believes a priest from a church she used to go, was using his quote, "heightened spiritual abilities," to leave his body at night and stalk my mom, and force her to remember painful memories from her past. Anyway, for the last few months my mom barely leaves her room, and keeps all the lights off, and has furniture and paintings and what not stacked in front of her windows to keep out all light (why not just get curtains? Don't ask me), because she believes she suffered some sort of radiation damage from her cell phone or a doctor gave her a migraine problem from shining a light in her eye or some junk, and now it hurts her eyes to be exposed to light. I don't know what to make of it though, because she apparently really believes her eyes hurt, but five different doctors (two optometrists, two neurologists, and a physician) all don't know what is wrong with her. The optometrists said it must be a problem with her brain because her eyes were fine, but her MRI came back normal. The only thing she won't try, is seeing a psychiatrist. It only makes sense to me that this is all in her head, but I don't know if she can be creating the pain or if there isn't really any pain at all and she's just making it up? It's just very confusing to watch. I mean she has to really believe she is sick or really be depressed from this because she has lost like 40lbs. Sorry if I'm ranting, it's just very frustrating.

It has come and gone over a couple years now.  But recently (in the last 3 weeks to a month, the pain has gotten worse.  It is usually a pretty sharp pain when it really hurts, but a dull pain throughout the day.  I wake up with it and it is getting to be very frustrating.  I did notice that when i have an occasional cigarette the pain sometimes gets worse.  The pain is in both the left and right side, usually around the sternum but will also be in the upper region of my pecks.  I went to the ER in December to see if something was going on.  They did a EKG and chest X-rays and said that they we normal.  Ive had the same test before about a year ago and it was normal then too.  So, i dont know.  If the test were normal, then why are these pains still here.  Oh, and my trip to the doctor cost me $800+ because i dont have insurance.  so that is why i am posting on here, so hopefully you people are able to help, cuz i cant afford another $800 medical bill.  thanks everyone! sorry this is so long!

My girlfriend said that about 4 years ago she smoked weed and after doing it she has felt detatched from the world.  She said that after researching all of the symptoms she has, she realised she has a disorder called ''Derealization disorder'', in which she feels detatched from the world and her life.  She recently described her symptoms like this:   * spaciness * like looking through a gray veil * a sensory fog * spaced-out * being trapped in a glass bell jar * in a goldfish bowl * behind glass * in a Disney-world dream state * withdrawn * feeling cut off or distant from the immediate surroundings * like being a spectator at some strange and meaningless game * objects appear diminished in size etc.        I keep telling her to get help but she refuses, and says that professional doctors and therapists don't know about the disorder and will only give her drugs (something she is opposed too).  She often moans about how bad her life is, that she wants to die and she told me that there is no cure so theres no point in searching, and that she will be like that for the rest of her life.     I keep telling her that she needs to find the strength inside to just force herself to slowly do the things she doesn't want to (because to be honest, I think that her ''disorder'' has a lot to do with her current life situation, she is 21, with no job, no thoughts of her future, living with her mum in  a small trailer and no motivation to search for a job or get educated).  She refuses to do anything I tell her.  I tell her to try to search for a job, to try to think of the most beautiful life she could imagine having, and then slowly start pushing towards it, general things like that and she says theres no point because its uncurable (something she read on the internet), and that I don't understand how bad it is for her and how hard it is.  I tell her that it will always be hard unless she starts to take control of her life.  But all of the help I try to give never changes her.  What can I do?

The main reason for this, is sometimes 1mg does NOT take care of my panic attack. I frequently need to take 2 tablets for one of my attacks during the day, and only 1 for my attack at night. So anyways, I did the math.... and if i take 3 daily, it should be approx. a 13.3 day supply.      When I called in to get a refill the other day, the doctor ok'd it... but said my prescription should be lasting me 30 days? im confused.

20090307155903AA6bFtq	Health;Diet & Fitness	Losing the extra belly fat.?	I gave birth to my son 2 years ago, I gained about 30lbs when I was pregnant. I started out at 115lbs with a very flat stomach. I was a very athletic person played soccer, tennis, ran everyday you name it. After I had my son, my midsection stretched a bit. I managed to lose 25lbs in 3 months. I am so grateful for that...but I had a hard time dealing with my belly. It seems very "loose" and saggy at times.       Are there any type of exercises that help women that have given birth and are dealing with this type of midsection problem? I really would like to have my old stomach back and I have tried Pilates, crunches, and I haven't seen much improvement in that area. I know, some people will say that I am "thin" and what not but this is a goal I would love to achieve for myself. I am still quite athletic but I have never had midsection problems. Thanks to anyone that helps =)

20090307141932AAN1mBd	Health;Women's Health	Birth control help! Implanon and IUDs?	I decided to start using birth control for the first time. I am 20 years old and have never had a kid. After doing A LOT of research on different types i decided i had the most interest towards an IUD (particularily the Mirena one) or the new Implanon, mostly because of their effectiveness and because they last for years and you dont worry about it on a daily basis. However, i have read many user reviews on implanon and i became hesitant when many women said they had really irregular periods and many did not stop bleeding for weeks at a time. Implanon costs around 800 dlls and i really don't wanna spend that much and have these horrible side effects. However i do know that everyone is different and my body may not react that way, but i guess i wont know until i try. I just don't wanna spend all that money and later have the implant taken out because of its side effects.   As far as an IUD, i was really leaning towards it until i called to make an appointment at Planned Parenthood and the lady said that she only recommends it for women who have had a child. She said the insertion would be incredibly painful if they did it on me because i have never had any children, and the risk of the IUD moving is greater.   I guess if neither of these methods convince me i might as well get on the pill, although im not too excited about it because i know its efficiency is lower and that makes me a little nervous..   So basically my question is for women who use either of these methods. What do you think of it? Would you recommend it? Success/Horror stories?  Also for implanon users, how bad was your scarring/bruises after insertion?   Thanks for the help!
