hJP9y6kjaa	I think there's a few words/lines that could be modified a bit here and there.<br>  <br>  My mind it was so scared -> my mind was so scared<br>  <br>  (one of those grammar things)<br>  <br>  i turned my thoughts to shreds -> I tore my thoughts to shreds<br>  <br>  (just using a different word than "turned"... how do you "turn" something to shreds? perhaps a more appropriate/descriptive word?)<br>  <br>  is all whats beneath me -> is all that's beneath me<br>  <br>  (again, a more appropriate word)<br>  <br>  lets wait for what we will see<br>    -> to wait for what...<br>    -> waiting for what....<br>    -> hungry for what's left to see<br>  <br>    etc<br>  <br>  (personal preference)<br>  <br>  <br>  I would also eliminate all the punctuation at the end of your lines, except for the question mark. Too many of these lines use periods and commas at what I would consider to be odd times.<br>  <br>  I had some interesting images occur to me while I read it... so I liked the direction you went. Some of the rhyming is a little simplistic though, in all honesty. I wonder how it would turn out if you only rhymed every other line? Maybe that would help you free up your thoughts a little bit and not struggle to end each line with a rhyme that would work, instead of choosing words that would have more of an impact.<br>  <br>  For instance... if I was to rewrite this a little, I might start the first four lines off like this -<br>  <br>  Under the glint of an iron sea<br>  far beneath each sharp-edged wave<br>  a whale has come to swallow me<br>  and it didn't know my name<br>  <br>  alternatively, you could just rhyme the second line, ie<br>  <br>  within the grip of an iron-faced sea<br>  a depth that steals air from my lungs<br>  the warm belly of a whale for comfort<br>  and safety from a heartless sun<br>  <br>  I guess I'm just trying to suggest ways that don't keep you so locked in to rhythm AABB etc... because when you don't, it really stands out (ie prepared-dared-cared and cause-me).<br>  <br>  Keep writing!<br>  <br>  Saul|`|YzS16M9daa	I like it! : ) Can you play the guitar? caus if you can you should put it on youtube or something! good luck|`|cHF1PwRdaa	I think that was very creative.

Life is to be enjoyed. Life is to be cherished. Life is to be appreciated. Life is not to be suicidal (unless one is really out of his/her sanity). You can't feel alive because u live in your problems, get yourself stuck in your problems, look at the problems as things that make life worse, if not worst. The fact is none has no problem at all. Indeed, having difficulties is not a problem; but having no difficulties is a real problem. Enjoy what there is to enjoy, suffer what there is to suffer. Live life to the challenge and breakthrough the darkness of it. Self-belief, wisdom and courage are vitally pivotal. Try to live for others rather than living for just yourself. Just enjoy all that u have. Let's live it. (my 'you' refers indiscriminately to any of you)|`|eDVzT3I8aa	To feel alive you have to get to know yourself.  To know yourself you have to know how others behave.  I feel alive when I'm with a huge group of strangers, like at a concert or even a shopping mall, ore even a small group of close friends, and I watch how people relate to each other and how much happiness, bitterness, hatred and love there is out there, and I realize that I am the only person that can make me who I am.|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	I have a lot of health problems so I feel that way sometime.

cNdkNYKOaa	i haven't seen tropic thunder yet<br>  the movie i found very dissapointing was<br>  the nightmare before christmas<br>  i saw it in theaters after seeing some great previews<br>  i couldn't wait for it to come out <br>  while sitting there, i realized how much it sucked and i tried to get kicked out of the cinema|`|BJIo6twUaa	Too many to count.<br>  <br>  What i can think off hand was Scream, Shutter, Pulse 2 and 3 (no surprise there since they went to direct to dvd), there are more but cannot think of them.<br>  <br>  On yea, Blindness, silina r i agree with you there. Just over all that movie was terrible. 1 person can see and the rest of are blind, preview made it seem interesting but the movie was terrible, my friend that makes movie, walked out on this one. More so of what happen while they were in the ward, not going to go into details incase some people are interested in seeing it, but i would not recommend this movie to anyone and not suited for kids to watch either.|`|FDzCjeYtaa	Jumper.<br>  I saw the previews it looksed SO good.<br>  The minute I watched it, i hated it.<br>  :(|`|MHHy90D5aa	twilight|`|G3fQEJkVaa	Oh wow, so so many.

I heard SO many good things about that movie and then when I watched... I couldn't figure out why. And it wasn't the gay thing either, nor the acting. I just didn't like it at all. Maybe the storyline, I still don't know.|`|Z4LmvBJnaa	Blindness-it really didn't make sense to me.

PRg9UgOlaa	Tell them that you do not need assistance in browsing, but you will let him/her know if you need any help with anything. They should get the point.<br>  <br>  My husband used to work at a car dealership and I would meet him there to grab some lunch. The salesman would stand in all the available parking places until you pulled in. I once had my window cracked, told him that I was waiting for my husband who worked there and he still kept talking to me about trading my car in. THROUGH the cracked window. Those guys are a little too much.|`|AJEE8VfMaa	Just act like you're attracted to them... <br>  <br>  1) Stare at her when they walk towards you <br>  2) When she asks you a question, continue to stare at her while smiling <br>  3) Don't answer<br>  4) If she repeats her question, shake your head a little (like you were in a daze because of her beauty; remember to smile adoringly)<br>  5) say "no thanks"<br>  <br>  This way, she'll feel better about herself and you'll feel good that you made her feel good about herself<br>  <br>  It wouldn't work with the opposite sex because they might ask you out|`|X8riDZBqaa	Tell her you don't need her help right then, but if you do you will find her.

ubKdwVz8aa	Unfortunately probably not. I have to admit I liked Billy and Lily together. She brought out a really good side in him. I really admired how he told her about him and Chloe at the cabin. I felt kind of bad for him then. <br>  <br>  Cane is just upset right now but he does love her and will realize it was not her place to say anything. I personally have been upset with Cane every since this storyline came about. Why would you marry someone you have NO feelings for and don't even remember sleeping with. That...in my opinion....was a ignorant move.|`|rYA2KCnUaa	I am going to tell you what I know.  Cane and Lily are suppose to be getting back together. I was at the grocery store and I saw the spoiler that the two of them were going to have a secret wedding.  SO yes the two Of them are going to reunite.|`|nndflDc9aa	Cane have no right to get mad at Lily in my point view cause he should apologize to her for believing Chloe lies over & over again.

WWNWtzvDaa	okay why dont you date chris brown ..in fact by the time they are threw with him in jail ..he wont like women =) you get what i mean ..he will be batting for the pink corner|`|sVkBdQ28aa	Rihanna didn't write either of those songs. Nor 'Unfaithful' if you wanna bring that up. Ne-Yo wrote Take a Bow, and Chris Brown wrote Disturbia. I don't think there's any connection, but she must've been depressed to sing them.|`|1Cnaphybaa	chris brown beat her up so she has a right to be depressed.but unfortunately she doesnt write most of her songs.she has a beautiful voice tho.example of song writing:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_a_Bow_(Rihanna_song)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_a_Bow_...</a>|`|r5wLhpgqaa	Why do people read so much into song lyrics, she did not write these particular songs. Take a bow was a break up song to a guy that was cheating. No one really knows what happened with the incident between them so do not go trying to connect the songs with the incidents.|`|Ym5IX8ZVaa	I don't really think shes depressing she doesn't write them and well she looks happy to me.

I'm a cartoonist myself, i don't know why they've allowed to do that. But i hardly see those anymore.|`|fFoMiIbgaa	I have a younger brother and my mom has never once contemplated letting him watch Disney. What little they do show/do will not hurt children.|`|yXGlmUqlaa	yes i think they're fine. i'm only 18 and i don't have children but i never noticed that stuff when i watched those movies. i didn't realize it until i was older and people actually pointed it out. If your children aren't actually looking for them chances are that they won't see them.<br>  <br>  plus with the hypnosis and subliminal messages. they are just shows. <br>  <br>  people think that because something is on tv or in a movie all kids will think it's okay. my parents personally taught me the difference between real life and what i see on tv and in CARTOONS. i never confused the two.|`|spjDVZgzaa	I, too, worry about what my children watch, and yes, I have heard about these things before.  I think these Disney movies are perfectly fine for the little ones.  It's the PG-13, and R movies, that I hate so much.  Why do they have to produce such vulgar movies.  If only they would leave out the filth.  That's life, these days.  The best movies are the ones like The Lion King, Cars, Nemo, the Incredibles, toy story, etc.|`|MHa1XhWTaa	Are you being serious! <br>  I'm sixteen now but I've never once noticed any 'SEX' written in the sky! <br>  Hahahaaa!<br>  I do think disney movies are okay for children to watch though, disney is the best for children x|`|21eb1fee7277ed0dfc6c417c0a528dddaa	Well first off the Jessica Rabbit thing has to be freeze framed at a particular point to see that. Also, the newer DVDs most likely don't even have that on there anymore. That "scandal" happened years ago. The thing with the Little Mermaid cover made me laugh, because I would never have noticed it if those women hadn't said anything. Which also makes me question those women, because who looks at a movie cover and think that.<br>  <br>  I don't see how seeing a snake hypnotize a kid is bad for a child. I'm also not even aware of the Aladdin thing you mentioned.<br>  <br>  I remember when Wall-E came out, I saw someone say it was "too dark" for young children. Took my son to see it when he was 4, and he sat still in his seat the whole time. I'm also sure there are those that think The Incredibles was too violent for kids. My son likes them. He knows they are cartoons and not real. And that is where the problem is.<br>  <br>  You have parents that want everyone else to teach their kid's right from wrong, instead of doing it themselves.|`|Waa9PUalaa	I think it could go either way. You have to be selective of what you let your children watch. Most disney movies are good for children and on the newer/enhanced disney movies they cut all those parts out. When I was a kid I could watch all of them except Hercules and Fantasia because of the demonic aspect. Just be selective and your kids will be fine. Chances are they wouldn't even notice those parts.

ZzqWzFNiaa	Hi Mr. Bernstein. Happy Friday man.<br>  I'm trying to figure out if I'm from the end of Gen X or the beginning of Gen Y. I think I actually identify more with the sort of Generation Y rebellion against track housing and sort of overnormalsy, but I can tell you that the first band that came to mind when I saw the question was The Modern Lovers. The message isn't necessarily there, but I think soundwise it works.<br>  <br>  Astral Plane<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQA2OZPZO5k" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQA2OZPZO...</a><br>  Roadrunner<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDJShMk-r88" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDJShMk-r...</a><br>  <br>  How are things?<br>  <br>  *****************<br>  Hi Man,<br>  It's so true, this isn't the first time that our immense importance as glue to the universe.

It's Jonathon Richman's old band.<br>  I hope the weather clears up. That sounds like a really nice way to spend the day, oddly enough especially the soft taco part (couldn't tell you why, but for some reason those two words sent a really pleasant and strong message to my stomach). I'm just plugging away at the office for now, getting ready to get productive. It should be pretty nice though. I think my wife and I are going to grab some dinner with a couple friends, maybe play some cards afterwards. This week went by pretty fast. I'm really into the idea of sleeping in a bit tomorrow. A buddy of mine is playing at the Knitting Factory tomorrow night, looking forward to seeing that. Shaping up to be a nice weekend.<br>  <br>  ***********<br>  Hi Wire,<br>  Yeah man. They just jumped straight to mind. I haven't listened to it in quite a while, man it's a great record. Girlfriend is a really good tune. Is the self titled the only record?<br>  <br>  *****************<br>  Hi Wire. <br>  Thanks for the tip. I've been meaning to grab something from Jonathon Richman's for a while, but I wasn't sure where was a good place to start. This morning I picked up an interesting cover he did of Tom Waits' the Heart of Saturday Night. Kind of a fun version.<br>  I didn't know that Cale produced it, but I'm not surprised.

Probably because my parents and siblings were all older -- when I was born, my sibs were 16, 17, and 18 -- they all grew up in the '50s and '60s. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I guess if I had to pick one, it would be "Rusty Cage" by Soundgarden. Just because I can relate to feeling like an outsider, and wanting to break free from the things that hold me down and/or make me similar to other people.

rNqF4gIVaa	I have a feeling that you have opened the door and tossed in a grenade on this one...<br>  <br>  There have been numerous discussions on this forum over the last couple of years concerning the state of classical music (and I mean western art music). Composers of the past were artists and artisans... they were well versed in the technicalities of their craft and strived long and hard over many years to create their works. Both Mozart and Beethoven were well versed in the works of Bach and studied the intricacies of their predecessors.<br>  These composers over the course of several hundred years developed and push the boundaries of what could be achieved musically, whilst still staying within a framework of aesthetically acceptable standards producing music that I generally refer to as having a "beauty aesthetic."<br>  Shortly after the turn of the twentieth century it became apparent that the territory within these boundaries had been fully explored. So the likes of the second Viennese School decided to "re-define" these boundaries. This manifested itself in serialism and atonal works. In my view this is a blind alley, because it leads to the main thread of your question... when does this "devolve" from music to purely sound (or some might say 'noise'). Clearly we may have reached that point. I view Prokofiev* as the limit to which dissonance can be utilized without a descent into "unmusic." He uses dissonance and atonality as a spice in his music. Like all spices, too much leads to unpalatability. <br>  <br>  This has lead me (and others) to make controversial statements along the lines of "classical music is over... it died after WWII." A sweeping statement to be sure, but one has only to look at what followed the passing of composers such as Prokofiev, Vaughan Williams and Shostakovich. Frankly, music that is hard for even enthusiasts to endure and, at times verges on noise.<br>  Visual art has gone the same way and one could discuss at length when one compares a painting by Rembrandt to one by say Rothko. The artisanship is gone and is replaced by deconstructionism and an all overiding need to be "original."<br>  <br>  The beauty aesthetic has been replaced with a need to be considered "deep", but leads to no-one but the artist understanding the work. "How good is a joke though, when someone has to give you the punchline?"<br>  <br>  [Doubtless, edits will follow]<br>  <br>  Edit: I realize that the more progressive amongst our ranks will take issue with many of my points. I happen to believe that time is the filter that great music must pass through in order to realized as just that. I keep listening with an open mind for works that might be able to pass through such a filter, but alas little seems to measure up in my estimation. Much of what I have heard is, to say the least, ugly. Just as much is banal and unremarkable, as though the composer is just trying to be "original."<br>  I a humbly await the onslaught from Delicious Manager.<br>  <br>  * "I strive for greater simplicity and more melody... Music, in other words, has definitely reached and passed the greatest degree of discord and complexity that it is practicable to attain."  - Sergei Prokofiev (1891 - 1953)|`|hX00rdFyaa	Because it's easier. Writing melodies is difficult. Making random noises and calling it 'avant garde' or 'new' or 'experimental' is not.|`|c8aAM8vvaa	Probably lack of imagination with Music or cant make it sound right,|`|2RHAgGZiaa	The situation reflected in what you've stated here gives me serious concern.  Yes, Orchestral Music is ill-suited to the avant-garde, and Penderecki had one of the few avant-garde works that worked in Threnody: For The Victims of Hiroshima, for 78 Strings.  A lot of the instrumental technique involved in making a bass instrument do descant, e.g. in Klezmer and New Jazz, simply doesn't translate to the Classical field.<br>  <br>  In Threnody, Penderecki had the foresight to specify, for each of the 40 Violins, 20 Violae, 12 Violoncelli and 6 Contrabassi involved (all of which are needed for the "noise" chorus effects), a specific part that each of the involved musicians could handle.  This could be very well lost on the bleeding-edge composers of today, who are going into areas beyond the instruments' design capabilities.  I'm used to all-rhythmic stuff myself, even odd-time-signature stuff such as are encountered in New Jazz and Progressive Rock.  Never could get a usable 12-Tone work, though; Schonberg made it sound easy.  For me, it's difficult enough to develop a violin solo for the first lead break of Daniels et al.'s Southern Rock update composition "The Devil Comes Back to Georgia," a known piece in Dm/Em from Songs of Universal (BMI); but what today's conservatory professors are putting doctoral-level songwriters through?  Sorry, can't hack it.|`|jR8kyp0Taa	I think maybe it is because simple minds take a look at everything that has ever been written...and therefor think that all the good ideas have been taken up already, or that it is too hard to come up with something new, but comparable....therefore they think they have to come up with something totally off the wall to make it unique. <br>  <br>  That may be partially true, but there is a line between 'unique' and garbage. Schoenberg and Messiaen were the masters of creating new, modern forms of music, and did so tastefully, although I think a couple of you, including Duchess, may disagree on the latter part.<br>  <br>  I'm always open minded when it comes to new music. I will judge unbiased. <br>  <br>  Boy Wonder<br>  <br>  EDIT: Malcolm, you mention Prokofiev as the one in which whose music was the end of the line as far as atonal/serialism taken seriously into music, and that anything more is "unmusic". Ugh. <br>  <br>  I have a more liberal view of music. I think any sounds at all composed for the sake of art is music. That doesn't just necessarily mean you can throw together a bunch of pitches, write it down and call it music, just like you cant throw a bunch of random words or letters on paper and call it a story.<br>  <br>  I'm having a hard time trying to define what "music" is. It seems to be a subjective thing. Even as a logician and philosopher such as myself, I can't seem to figure out what one theme ALL music has in common, that makes it "music". <br>  <br>  The best I can do is to define it this way: that a piece of music is truly music if it is relevant within itself, and has a common theme within itself.<br>  <br>  Boy Wonder again.|`|mAjyNjV5aa	Everything today  has been dumbed right down.  Even in the art world there is no real definition anymore.  it is people's way of rebelling against order.  it is all about money and not the beauty of the craft.

My instrumentation is most often very simple one to five instruments, and has some texture. Instruments are intended to make music, an odd effect once in a great while might be effective, but when the whole piece is made up of effects I think of it as instrument abuse. And listener abuse. Ask which music will have the greater chance at success: "Safe but original," or "experimental."<br>  <br>  This sounds like an opportunity to stand up to your professor; carefully read the terms of the assignment, and if you've met them, make him aware of that. As you have said, it is your original music it isn't a copy of what his vision of all his students is. You are original -- keep it that way.<br>  <br>  ... I guess if it's available to you, dip some everyday objects in ink and drop them on a sheet of manuscript paper. Present that as an original work. Surely he cannot mark you off for not being original.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Because the genre has been fully worked out from a form point of view. They are desperate to be seen to be new. The situation is even more parlous in the pop world.|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	I was very surprised indeed to see you posing this question. Sorry to say, I think you need to listen to more 'new music'. A gross generalisation such as this shows little more than a lack of listening experience and prejudice. I can see your teacher's point: why would you want to write in a style which is nearly 300 years old? It's been done and music has moved on. It would be a little bit like writing a book in early 18th-century-style English or painting a portrait in the style of an early eighteenth-century artist.<br>  <br>  There is no 'trend'. Composers today are writing in a greater variety of styles than at any other period in musical history. That's a wonderful thing, surely. However, I'm not sure that anyone writing in a Baroque, Galant or Classical 'pastiche' style would have any relevance today. The demands made on musicians and their instruments has grown and evolved for hundreds of years. It is true that sometimes certain self-obsessed composers might make outrageous technical demands for the sake of effect, but, in the main, this is not the case.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you are listening to too much of the wrong type of music and not immersing yourself in the wonderful array of music being written today. Try seeking-out some music by composers like:<br>  <br>  Kalevi Aho<br>  John Corigliano<br>  Anders Eliasson<br>  Henri Dutilleux<br>  Peter Sculthorpe<br>  Mark Anthony Turnage<br>  John Woolrich|`|DMpVSHvXaa	As a composer of this "new music", I think that people shouldn't be too tied to the idea of music as something that has to be made up of specific pitches (I like being able to get dozens of pitches between the Western 12-notes-to-an-octave, which are, if you take the time to notice, very widely spaced), rhythms that you can tap your feet to (what about ones that you can't grasp immediately, and which offer the pleasure of having to work to make sense of them), and pretty melodies. Music is organised sound, and sound includes unpitched sounds and sounds not traditionally associated with music, and if people can't make sense out of music that goes beyond what they are used to hearing, then they need to hear more of it. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, I dislike it when people use extended instrumental techniques just to sound "modern". Anything that is used in a musical work should be used because it is what the music demands.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why it is necessary to have a program for music, or to understand "what's going on": unless it is a programmatic work, what is going on is that you are listening to sounds that have been arranged in a particular way by a composer. Try appreciating it as music-in-itself rather than trying to impose extramusical associations on it.<br>  <br>  I still think there's a place for beautiful melodies. There is no reason, though, why they shouldn't coexist with these new sounds that seem to have you so bothered: the new sounds are not a threat, all they are is another tool for composers to use.<br>  <br>  I don't like it when people are lazy about listening to music: they should take the time to make sense out of what they're hearing, rather than expecting everything to be immediately accessible (would you expect all literature to be written at the level of what you read in primary school? That's what most people expect of music.), and they shouldn't listen to modern classical music with the same expectations that they bring to 18th-century music: it is different music; not better or worse, just different.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  "Because it's easier. Writing melodies is difficult. Making random noises and calling it 'avant garde' or 'new' or 'experimental' is not."<br>  <br>  I disagree. Melody writing is simple once you know the principles, as we are immersed in melodic music right from when we are very small.  Writing avant garde music is more difficult, because you're trying to make sense with sounds that you and everyone else aren't as accustomed to hearing as music.<br>  I can write melodies in my sleep.<br>  <br>  Edit #2:<br>  <br>  "Perhaps I've been listening to too much conservatory majors' works - which most of the time sound like the student was just trying to squeeze in as many special effects as possible."<br>  <br>  Ha, yeah, this could be the problem, a lot of young composers get the idea that they have to sound "modern", while forgetting that it's probably a good thing to make sure that their music holds together as music. It takes a while to strike a balance between using the sonic resources that are available to you and over-using extended techniques in a special-effects type of way.|`|ThKkn5fKaa	The contemporary American composer John Adams once said (I'm paraphrasing) "In my darkest times I have occasionally wondered if I have chosen to compose for a medium (orchestral music) which has become obsolete."<br>  <br>  I find this fascinating because when compared to most contemporary composers, Adams uses very little in the way of extended techniques.  And yet he is probably the best composer America has seen since Copland, if not Gershwin or Ives.  It does point out the glaring fact that he has become a very successful composer without needing to resort to tricks up his sleeve if you will.<br>  <br>  I will add more to this later, because I have to get ready for a concert tonight.  We're performing Carmina Burana, ironically, a perfect example that it is still possible to create good, fresh music without sounding dated and/or relying on extended techniques.  Granted, I enjoy the occasional extended technique (Adam's used pre-recorded tape and quarter tones wonderfully in On the Transmigration of Souls), but way too many composers use them as a crutch.  Instead of moving an audience to thought or emotion, the heavy reliance on such concepts can often just be distracting.<br>  <br>  I'll have more later, but like was said, you opened a huge can of worms, and a very touchy subject.  Haha.

Not sure what you are insinuating, but he is very much alive and well. He was just let go from Guiding Light.<br>  <br>  Many times characters are killed off when their portrayers leave the show; however, many return as different actors.<br>  <br>  They don't actually show an actor dying on a soap; it is acting. When actors do die, when they are featured heavily into a storyline, their deaths are normally incorporated.|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	Michelle Thomas (played a small part on Y&R in 1998, Callie) died in 1998 and they didn't recast her - she just "left" Genoa City I think. She also played Myra (Urkel's girlfriend on Family Matters).

Like a while ago the actress who played Lila Quartermaine on general Hospital died and they gave her a funeral on the show. BUT sometimes if the actual actor isn't that important to the role they can just be replaced if they really die, so basically it all depends and the answer is yes & no....LOL|`|6FSdrlCtaa	yes they can. they then become walking zombies and eat the brains of other characters. this adds to the story line and makes the soap opera more intersting. another possibility is that they come back to life with super powers, stronger than ever, and defend the city from evil little mutant babies.|`|2kpr2arRaa	the character is dead the actor is not- he left the show<br>  <br>  occasionly if the actor has died in real life then they may have or say something like a "In Memorial" at the end of the show|`|ucSTZRqraa	The only time they die for real is when the actor or actress really dies in real life.

VJdQhyAsaa	http://board.okayplayer.com/okp.php?az=s...    stop trying to make people think you know hip hop. you stealing ideas shows that you try too much to impress the people on here.|`|bd1fcb5d764c68e35c6336cba1138542aa	Hmmm    I think I think the second one is worse.|`|AYkEwqRXaa	You provided options.  I didn't look at the other answers so I wonder how many chose an option that wasn't provided.  Anyhew, I would say overusing a sample.  A producer using the same sample wouldn't be that bad if they sampled different parts of the song.  For example, how many times has the Isley Bros. song "Between The Sheets" been sampled?  Jones used a different part of the song on "Summer With Miami."  I don't know of anybody that has used that portion of the song on a track.  Ingenious!  Or at least different.|`|u8hsZ7claa	It would greatly depend on how well the sample was usedI recall on one of Reds old albums he use the same Parliament song for what seemed like the entire album but I didnt really notice it that muchIf the sample is disguised well then to me you have a winner.|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	too many people using the same sample.    If one person uses the same sample multiple times it could become a signature. And the person typically knows which direction s/he took the sample previously and can appropriately deviate in subsequent attempts.|`|RavvDVpVaa	What bothered me about the DeBarge sample is Irv Gotti used it, the same way Rashad Smith did, but Irv Gotti like Puffy, is just a biter.     I can enjoy different usages of samples like michael jackson's I can't help it  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnhWML43N...  I love the way prince paul used it on breakadawn and I loved the way buckwild used it on Black Sheep's North South East West (remix)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqy6cdNo...  I think using the same sample sometimes is ok, as long as the producer used it in their own different, unique way and it's dope.    On the second one, if they sample the same record but use a different part of it it's not all that bad either. Pete Rock used the Nautilus sample a few times  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RATJgjqRA...  he used different parts of it on   Take You There  The Sun Won't Come Out  What's Next on the Menu?  &  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYTPeEmie...  &  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KWsXYYQd...    What bothers me about Nas is, it wasn't just the same sample it was the exact same instrumental, it wasn't even chopped up differently, it was the exact same beat and I'm not a big fan of recycled beats.     On Dilla, Q-Tip did the beat for lyrics to go, and can't hold the torch came out after dilla died, busta paid whoever is in charge of the estate for the look of love beat.     My answer is if the producer can do it in a way that's different from how the next person did it or they can do if differently than they did it before and it's dope than neither is that bad.|`|SB5hdhM6aa	David Banner sampling Lil Wayne - Lollipop  "Shawty Say"|`|8Xllb2MJaa	Good question, the first two piss me off equally .. It's like I couldn't get away from that Inside My Love sample (btw, Dilla didn't produce Lyrics to Go).    It sort of just comes down to the popularity of the sample, but using a sample years after someone else used it for a popular single, it's worse.    EDIT: In the liner notes of the album, it's listed as "A Tribe Called Quest" so I'm guessing Q-Tip and Ali Shaheed.|`|AA11346438	it's possible to use the same sample differently, provided it's chopped up, but in general i think the first is worse, especially if it was originally used for a big hit. a good related question might be, "what original songs have been sampled so many times that no one should be allowed to use them anymore (ie. bob james - nautilus)?"

Maybe its best to set up a club of sorts for movie fans to borrow DVDs based upon your own reviews? <br>  Sharing information is one thing..keeping it up to date is another...a full time job seeing so many releases. <br>  The information you want to share should be compact..and correct.<br>  <br>  I don't think that it's a pointless task at all. I think it's merely a task of gathering the data you want to share and dealing only with that. Get one right, the rest will follow suit.|`|QLp2iaHkaa	well to some people who didn't see the movie in theaters who would like to rent or buy the DVD its helpful to know what other people thought about it

40kCOPicaa	One Hour Photo was disturbing, and also Manhunter (the original prequel to Silence of the Lambs). They were disturbing - the first because it was pretty weird, esp. Robin Williams' character and what he does at the end, and the second because it is so scary.<br>  <br>  The Hotel Rwanda, The Killing Fields, Schindler's List, Blood Oath ...... movies based on true stories like these are also disturbing because it makes you think about what people do to each other and the injustice and inequality in the world (I agree with Lydia).<br>  <br>  I also found The Passion of The Christ disturbing, but not exactly in the same way - it is a very realistic, violent film, but if you are of Christian faith, it makes you confront what Jesus knowingly gave himself up to go through.|`|xMqgB2GDaa	I'm gonna say Killer Clowns from Outer Space.

Lots of graphic death scenes, including castration, and a finale that will make most women vomit...yes, that's right, the child is removed by the psycho.

While movies like "Dead Alive," "Ichi the Killer," or the like are over-the-top gory, they are not realistic scenarios and hence don't have a big impact in my opinion.<br>  <br>  "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" will probably be high on the list for me.  I don't ever need to see it again because it was that effective, for lack of a better word.  "Last House on the Left" was also very disturbing and hard to sit through.  There are many others that I haven't seen, such as "Cannibal Holocaust," which depicts real animal torture, mutilation, and death.  But some, such as the latter, disturb me enough that I don't need to see them in the first place.|`|8xabuUl6aa	My favorite "Leon:The Professional" international version<br>  It disturbed me for THREE whole months. Sorry to instigate hype, but it's really that shocking.|`|HVY2rqzfaa	Irreversible. <br>  <br>  A very very strong french film which deals with the subject of rape and revenge.|`|vTfEYeKQaa	The Devil's Rejects....it was way too weird for me.

I learned about it watching Bravo's Top 100 Scariest Movie Moments. It's about a man that holds an audition looking for a wife, telling the actresses that they are auditioning for a movie. He meets a girl that he thinks is absolutely perfect, and starts to court her. It goes downhill from there. This movie features one of the most creepy and shocking moments I have ever seen. I highly recommend it if you can find it. I found it at Blockbuster.|`|HKKu4CjEaa	I would have to say "Hellraiser" and its sequels.  Mannnn!  I had to get up and leave my brother and sisters watching that shittt!

0QXiPW9eaa	R.I.P <3<br>  <br>  He died on my birthday. :( 5th April '94. Sad day.|`|RKLFYS2Naa	YEA! Happy birthday wishes from me too! <br>  <br>  I  try to live life with as little regret as possible, but sometimes it’s just too much to ignore. It’s amazing to even myself how much regret I have as it pertains to one person. A person I never met. I’m not always sure how I feel about it myself. Sometimes I wonder if I should just let it go, but certain things hit you at a certain time in your life, and no matter what ups or downs you experience, they will be with you.<br>  <br>  Thirteen years ago today, on April 5th, 1994, Kurt Cobain, lead singer of Nirvana, and reluctant voice of a generation, died in his Lake Washington home due to a shotgun blast to the head. It would be three days until his body was discovered, three days until a legion of the most important music fans since the days of George, Paul, John, Ringo, Plant, Page, and Sabbath would be forever changed, three days until part of me would be dead, too.|`|sVkBdQ28aa	Thank god, I thought I was the only one who remembered this today.<br>  Happy birthday. I wish you were still here.|`|2DK4QoV9aa	Rest In Peace  ?|`|L4cfoavyaa	Kurt Cobain was a sad example of how even those that seem to have everything can actually have nothing of real importance. Drug abuse and mental illness cast it's shadow over his money, fame & talent. <br>   Just goes to show that you don't need those things to be truly happy and content. I think we all can too easily lose sight of that fact. <br>   RIP, In the Arms of the Angels.|`|1Cnaphybaa	thankyou for remebering.im glad someone did.nirvana was the first rock band i ever liked.<br>  R.I.P <3|`|AA11618168	At least he went out with a bang!|`|7R7e6yX5aa	ditto-intense sadness right now

There was a big fight between my mom and my aunt about what to play at my grandmother's funeral, and my mom even threatened not to come to the funeral. As the oldest grandkid, and the one that pretty much shared my grandmother's taste in music, I decided I would pick three perfect songs for her. I played this song for my mom, and she cried.

OCCzu7bFaa	It would still be two 8th notes.  If they were both quarter notes, there would be too many beats in the measure, and you wouldn't match up with the piano accompaniment.  The appogiatura and the "big" note have to fit in the same beat.|`|yJKEH4I3aa	Honestly I'm confused 2. I have no idea wat ur talking about but u cud check it up on a wevsite or sumting.

aCcRsh7uaa	I believe they only have the uncut versions, but they really aren't that bad.  DBZ never really has any nudity or harsh language at all - just a few "suggestive" themes dabbled here and there throughout the series.  Even the uncut episodes are approved for ages 8 and up.  Trust me, they've seen worse just on regular TV.

lb6VI8XRaa	Well, this song isn't really about the guy finding a perfect girlfriend, but about a guy leading a girl on only to hurt her.

PumYhJSvaa	Free Bird ending of Devil's Rejects.     Or the ending of Freaks. ONE OF US! ONE OF US!|`|tLI94qWNaa	My favorite ending to a thriller would have to have been The silence of the lambs when Dr hannibal lecter is talking to clarice starling on the phone and says  that he is having an old friend for dinner aka Dr. Frederick Chilton  Love that ending:D lol|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	Se7en.  That sort of peak with the speech and seeing John Doe's plan all come together. It's amazing. So perfectly executed and such an awesome way to end that flick.|`|KdUbGwaYaa	This is sort of a stupid one, but: Final destination3. It looks as if the 3 main characters are all going to live and be okay but then they're all in the same place at the same time and they die. It was so intense!|`|nci2WOYXaa	Usual Suspects has the best twist ending.     Horror- The Shining. I love the last shot.     Thriller- Memento and Dark Knight come to mind. Chris Nolan has a great way of packing an impact. Seven with the empty desert and the truck with the "gift" is amazing too.     Drama- Ever see a movie called Magnolia. Their is a certain rain storm that really makes you think. Fight Club has an interesting ending too.|`|AA12050629	Not specifically a horror, although it has some pretty scary moments, but the Sixth Sense has a great ending.|`|abfd8f4cc478728d19120d04f1712dcdaa	I think the best ending the horrors are the ones where the bad guys win.  Saw V had a good ending.  Actually all the Saw movies played out pretty well.

tlLoQUsuaa	you can't buy tickets until they have exact dates and venues posted.  which will be a while from now. you most certainly can't buy tickets anytime soon. especially not for concerts in 2010! so you don't need to worry about anything for a while. and there are no "rows" at tokio hotel concerts. its general admission, which means the earlier you get there and the farther up you are in line, the closer you'll be to the stage in the pit. when i bought tickets for their concert, i got them the morning they came out. so just check their site whenever you think to and see if they've updated anything about the concerts or the CD. good luck :]|`|kAIXDVu1aa	buy them as soon as they come out log in to ticket master or whereever ur buying it from and do it fast cuz it's gonna sell out fast|`|hpxc5szsaa	I would say buy a ticket ASAP...also by the way um...tokio hotel sucks so I mean ....yeah...lol|`|3kKlGfy7aa	as early as you can!!!!|`|kHY0eMVraa	Well you can't buy tickets until they post dates as to where the concert will be. And it also depends on where the concert is at most concerts have general admission which means you stand the whole time. Just make sure you pre buy your tickets or buy them the first day they go on sale because Tokio Hotel tickets will be sold out.
U3U0Kpimaa	who are they
ig2BDphqaa	well, i suppose it depends both on if you are a girl or a boy and what sort of labor. It depends so heavily on these variables that with out an example i couldn't say.

Oh3yVRQzaa	Nobody knows the full story - there are three sides to every one.     People think that actors sit around in their trailers all day sipping on champagne - when the reality is - they often spend 12 - 14 days on set in whatever conditions the movie takes place in - in make up - wardrobe (which can be intense depending on the movie) and it takes the perfect conditions to for a scene to be done right - so when this DP messed up the scene once bofore - I would be angry too.    This guy is the Director of Photography he should know his job (his job listings aren't that impressive anyways - Semi Pro, Drumline)     It is so easy to judge someone else's actions as opposed to our own. I have a bad temper and I know it and I've freaked out on people before (minus all the swear words)     What is important is how the person redeems themselves post their verbal expression. Obviously Bale didn't shut down production - so they must have kissed and made up.     People say a lot of things when they're angry.     If you buckled under pressure and got angry in a similar fashion would you want someone to give up on you?|`|j7wESGaDaa	i thought that yesterday too, but the director just came out and defended him. here's part of what he said: "It was the most emotional scene in the movie. And for him to get stopped in the middle of it - he is very intensely involved in his character." and he also said he was having a very bad day.    So if that was really the case, i would understand. I wouldn't want a guy pissing me off like that either. Put urself in his situation...|`|cSaRk1Ygaa	Well.... if you really think about it the poor guy was under a lot of pressure. With resent sucess with The Dark Knight, they guy just burst. I wouldn't have fired him, but I would have told him to take a few days off.
52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	This will sound crazy but, "Summer Wine" does it for me. It makes me think of the time I lost my silver spurs.<br>  I guess my favorite of all time is "Unchained Melody" by Bobby Hatfield of the Righteous Brothers. Bobby overdosed a few years ago. It made me mad. I had figured that one would have to sell their soul to the devil for a voice like his and he OD's.<br>  Also, the Elvis and Willie Nelson versions of "You Were Always On My Mind" is one that I hum or whistle. I just can't sing a note..|`|SQmHjyBKaa	Crazy On You by Heart always gets me pepped up :)

Evil Dead trilogy   Dead Alive   Monster Squad   Sleepaway Camp trilogy   Ginger Snaps trilogy   Nosferatu   The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari   Re-Animator   Friday the 13th (1-7, the other 3 are cheesy, but still awesome)   Bride of Re-Animator   Basket Case   Frankenhooker   Texas Chainsaw Massacre   Jaws   Freaks   The Raven   The Fly   Killer Klowns From Outer Space   Night of the Creeps   From Dusk Till Dawn|`|6qsTmMQaaa	Les Diaboliques|`|tLI94qWNaa	If you want classic I would go with The Exorcist or halloween, both great.  Also friday the thirteenth is a good one to go with.  I saw jeepers creepers and I really love that movie, not a classic yet but it will be.  If you want something newer go with the descent, really good horror movie.|`|rI53kWKmaa	friday the 13th is a good one or u could watch    The ring  The grudge 1&2  black X-mas  When a stranger calls|`|fGFO61JWaa	Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.|`|a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	The original Dracula|`|XpZumlkwaa	The Gremlins!|`|D3XQ5DoSaa	I really love The ORIGINAL Texas Chainsaw Massacre|`|39cDZ7Nvaa	jason movies are classic those are some of my favorites|`|5lsViwoOaa	watch something from the 70's when drive ins were big. watch like the last house on the left or even go into the eightys and watch the friday the 13th movies or nightmare on elmstreet. the hills have eyes either the originall or the remake. the origiall psycho by alfred hitchcock something to that effect would be good|`|M6x4mZpFaa	The best in my opinion is The Boogey Man which was thrilling yet scary all at the same time. There was another that I dont know the name of but its christmas time and they hear a noise on the roof it ws a very good movie. Oh yea it was Christmas night or Black Christmas or something like that|`|Rmy8bWnsaa	The Shining   The Birds  The Wicker Man (1973)|`|A9q3h6Lyaa	the exorcist, pumpkinhead or evil dead|`|nZCT32XCaa	Many good suggestions here, especially Kendra L's list.  Since I don't want to suggest the same things again, I'll add one that I haven't seen being mentioned: "The Innocents" with Deborah Kerr.|`|zSkUhkrKaa	The Old Friday the 13th movies... ahha the first 3 were good.   Then after you've done that, watch the sick new remake of Friday the 13th, opening on... Friday the 13th ;o!|`|fIlUtFkraa	I personally think Dead Silence is a really jumpy movie so this would make an excellent choice!|`|5XmUx22saa	FREDDY CRUGER!! all of them!
h59Bc4wfaa	Yeah, my Ex. That's a big part as to why he's an Ex.  Oh, wait...that's a limp noodle. Well, he was one of those too.|`|qlaZpHnPaa	huh??|`|C6ZJcNJjaa	Yes.

That sounds like something an Italian would say while watching food porn.    "Mama mia! Look at that wet noodle getting smothered in marinara!!!"|`|LpJ9TLNBaa	No, but I once met someone who had eight penii in different areas of their body, including one on their forehead!!   I also used to know a girl who had some kinda abnormal tissue growth which caused her to reproduce extra body parts continually. On both occasions twer kinda scary...|`|9SSO454taa	yeah i know loads people like that but i don't drink any more so i don't really see them types of people any more|`|0gXwrJ9Eaa	I never heard about it.

QAwwmDuDaa	The second one.|`|Kbgc6x5raa	lol  the second one by far duh!|`|sN4wTWJ4aa	I think the snoop dogg one is dumber its probably easier to fight off a few lions than it is to fight off that many umm "snoop dogg fans" for lack of being able to say any other word w/o getting shot lol|`|Orx9cTJJaa	Hahaha, oh my god, the last one.|`|AA11945637	1|`|TUBGXQkAaa	this question is dumber than the choices    i was jk people relax!|`|W3gpfzj2aa	The first one is dumber I think. But the second was really funny! :D|`|GlP7KECoaa	ahaha the first ones dumber but i laugh at the second|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	rubbing raw meat all over you and jumping into the Lion exhibit at the zoo|`|y9GsC7ogaa	Going to a Snoop Dog concert...thats way dumber|`|pj4agFiOaa	2  YOU HAVE NOT SEEN A BLACK MAN MAD!!!!|`|up363TZyaa	1st one is dumber.    second one sounds like fun.|`|jsS03HSNaa	the first one - the second is kind of funny|`|519f86c6bb67a03278f5cb12031d6128aa	They are both dumb but I would love to watch the Snoop one.    Tape it please|`|HEE1gATYaa	2|`|5pV4LiTMaa	snoop dogg concert|`|cgqgomawaa	******* hell i wouldn't like to do either! i would probably do the lion thing as i would hope that they had just eaten and weren't hungry.|`|hrsyPUwTaa	I'll say A since B would probably be a quick gunshot to head type death.|`|xoZeL7PSaa	Probably the second one.  If you did the first one, at least you'd have a chance to get away from the lions. I would think it would be harder to outrun the gunshots at the concert|`|Ep2uYJQDaa	Snoop one better than death!|`|6mf4yy92aa	rubbing raw meat on you and jumping in the lions exhibit.....yea ummm wouldn't you rather be called racist than be dead!|`|2Kry9RpKaa	the first one!!! Loooooooooooooooove it!!!|`|ZUL3drNgaa	ooo . . . probly  1.|`|73KnE9Kmaa	snoop dogg i should say......?|`|GhI9wYUiaa	theyre pretty much the same thing.|`|WyjRm10jaa	When you went for tour visiting war zone at Gaza last month..|`|oVRA1ze2aa	the first one    Because at a Snoop dog concert you'll blend in with all the other white people whom are there too see him in concert.He has more white fans than black fans.An his concerts are always full of white kids , Latinos , middle eastern , blacks. So screaming white power will only get you ignored by the loud bass and his rap music. So your not really making a point you just making a @ss out of yourself .|`|qI7T8jFeaa	lmfao.... both are funny.. but i say they both might get you killed.. the first would be faster and less painful.. so i have to say the second because it will take long to die from the pain|`|O3mxzQIiaa	there both stupid things to do but the 2nd one definitly made me laugh! thats amazing!!!     you should totally make up random things and answer peoples questions with them! you never know, they may choose you as best answe because there sosoSO funny!|`|Bn864omfaa	i don't no cause they both r dumb but i think the 1st 1 would be more painful because if u do that @ the concert if they shot u in the head then it would be over but @ the zoo u could feel the lion bite you b 4 u die|`|W1RUAUbPaa	the first one    although you'll die either way

The beat clashes a little as well.|`|dm1MuyYjaa	i dont like it at all|`|l01yTPHWaa	erm na, not exactly a brill song|`|nl7tkxc3aa	Hmm, not much.   (listens more .. ]    Its cool.

ykm74F0baa	Here are some possibilities:    Music Teacher (like me!)  Music Producer  Composer/Arranger  Conductor  Performer (on whatever your instrument is)  Church Music director  Music Salesperson  Music Typesetter/Publisher  Music Marketer    That's a start.  Lots more that I haven't thought of.|`|zewRBWE7aa	IT for a mortgage lender and now an internet company.
zxhCy80eaa	Wow, even though I'm sure sex is what he would REALLY want... Let's see. If you and your guy have the same fashion sense I know most guys I know would love a nice jacket or shirt or hat. Some would be happy with a six pack of beer. I'd probably steer clear of anything too "cutesy" like a teddy bear. A gift card is always good if you're really not sure. That way he could pick out whatever he likes. Whatever it is memories are what you'll remember most. I've been through 8 Valentine Days with my man now and honestly I couldn't tell you what he bought me for the first few, it's not what I remember.   (Congrats by the way. When are you due? I'm prego with baby  3.)|`|3ngp2L4Daa	not that complicated for guys. cook him food and give him "dessert"|`|MLRxQw44aa	Get Him Cologne or Body spray. Guys like to smell nice I know my bf loves Lucky for Men, at Wal-mart you can buy a decent size bottle for under 20 bucks.|`|5pGj2duQaa	Keep it simple. unless hes into something like sports, videos game or some other definite hobby, I`d recommend a card ( im sure you can find one that hits the spot at hallmart or  just simply get a blank one and fill it up with what you want it to say), and a watch( they come in every price range),|`|saUiyPBsaa	I think the most sexiest thing a couple can do to her or his partner is to buy her an underwear. like pants or breast wears  .|`|HgRYP3cJaa	his fav band t-shirt or cd  new guages  crazy valentine socks|`|k3Gzg3Kaaa	well is there something that he wants? idk... haha that's a good question!!!|`|DWJOMWQ8aa	A massage is a nice gift. My wife is a certified massage therapist who owns her own business, and around this time of year she sells a lot of massages to women buying for their men on Valentines.|`|6Uohf1h1aa	a hat|`|zyTrMeovaa	A nice steak dinner|`|B9QDJOxCaa	To get him something he'll truly appreciate, avoid anything that's labelled as a gift, like a "men's" gift set, a teddy with a heart that says "I love you thiiiis much"... any of that commercial crap. One of the worst things about Valentine's, and other holidays really, is that people buy and receive all these mass-produced, nonspecific gifts that aren't special. A gift is supposed to be special to the person it's for. Get him something only you would know about; we can't really tell you what he'd like, he's your boyfriend. And I guess that's more what Valentine's should be about than giant stuffed bears, it should be about how much a couple knows about and appreciates each other's tastes and feelings and dreams.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	pop|`|GlP7KECoaa	omg im having that same problem!!!|`|S0XArokKaa	Booze, good booze though, none of the cheap ****.|`|pbfkYJ2daa	i have been wondering that my entire life.|`|QAwwmDuDaa	Get him a ring,o show him you care.|`|DiBAWKPsaa	Well i'm getting my boyfriend a pack of lovehearts, a CD of all the songs that would remind him of me, me to him and some songs he likes. I'm also getting him a mini photo frame that's got a picture of us in it.     How about them, you can use them ideas if you want ^   x|`|TJBeyew5aa	my boyfriend tells me that spending time with him is gift enough. but if your man isn't that great, pay for dinner and surprise him. men always like it when the woman pays for dinner once in awhile.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	Guy's actually have their own version of Valentine's Day called National Steak and BJ day lol. You could go with that as a theme lol.    Actually, I'm making my man a sweet homemade card, cooking him a fanulous dinner (if he doesn't take me out that is) and letting him pick out some lingerie for me which I of course shall pay.|`|zRUHryuraa	man thong|`|pR860mw7aa	a hug|`|dQ99YWeoaa	I always just go with cards and write something cute inside. :)|`|n43DN6Duaa	I think you have already gave him the perfect valentines gift, he/she is sitting in ur tummy!|`|qVhqc019aa	A gift card or a coffee, lol =]    ?|`|OPNReaAaaa	i got my boyfriend this hugee card and wrote cute notes in it. buut i would get my boyfriend a chain for valentines day or something like tht|`|aR0bJqCdaa	Rent a movie he likes, get some munchies and watch it Saturday night.|`|IngripgMaa	Make him a coupon book with nice things you can do for him...cook dinner, rub feet, massage and sex too.|`|QJTOvC98aa	I'm taking my man to shoot skeet :P Which is spending plenty of money, between the shooting fee, the shells, etc.|`|alpDOHtkaa	a pheasant|`|wUaMEwSsaa	girls dont give guys stuff for valentines day  girls just get stuff|`|oVRA1ze2aa	gift card too his favorite electronics store|`|sn3ZJjgKaa	Dudes dont want cards, and Im sure flowers sound great but do you and he want to really do what EVERYBODY else is doing?    Go ask him, and if you have then let him be. Im sorry but I hate these questions. and I know, i know "then why did I answer it?" cause I wanted to.|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Ok ... I was gonna say SEX, but you knixed that.....     A picture of both of you together ... or hand make a card.|`|iGYGJfgsaa	id like just a funny card and dinner at  a BBQ restarunt.    Congrats on the baby!!!
71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	The big question I have concerns Stabuck. <br>  I think that when Ellen talks about making John in her father's image that her "father" is really her human creator. Could it be that the scientist who created the Final 5 has some connection to Starbuck? We don't know who Starbuck's father is. There are flashbacks of her as a little girl painting the swirls. Anders mentions the swirls when he is delusional in sick bay. The swirls are the key. Is Starbuck some advanced Cylon model? Like Rachael in Blade Runner, maybe her "father" created her as the perfect model, so perfect that she is essentially human. The Hybrid foretold that Starbuck would be the harbinger of the destruction of the human race. Maybe that's because everyone will evolve into whatever she is and there will be no more Humans and Cyclons.<br>  <br>  I've read that the new spin off series, Caprica, deals with the origin of the Cylons. It revolves around two families. One will be the about the scientist who research led to the Cylons the other will probably be the Adamas.

737YfQygaa	Scar by Missy Higgins.    There are four main chords in the verse and chorus (g, d, em, c) and another four chords in the prechorus (am, em, g, d). These all just repeat through out the song. You can pick it up by ear quite easily.  There is a piano part and guitar part with a piano riff that reoccurs throughout the song.  Not really a duet but you could divide the singing into parts and incorporate some harmonies.  It's a really, really easy song to learn.    Hope this helps :)|`|hDeNKwNpaa	play hey jude beatles|`|rfvRcOl9aa	idk get some chords together and make something up|`|sRIjVWCEaa	make up a band|`|jZikbLE3aa	just make up a band it depends if u want a band|`|6HgiNCmqaa	Guitar:  Titanic:  all on the 1st string, *thinnest string*  *when there is a parentheses hold that fret longer*    Frets:  (8),8,8,8,7 (8),8, 7,(8), 10, (12), (10), (8) 8,8,8,7, (8),8, (3)    ^^in order^^

m4PtEEDNaa	...although each and every one of their classic Hal Roach-produced short films are slapstick cinematic jewels, indeed, their feature films are also worth their weight in gold.  My personal favorites are "The Bohemian Girl", "Swiss Miss" and "Pardon Us"....<br>  <br>  ...I have the highest hopes that Genius Products, who recently released a beautiful and pristine box set of all of the classic Hal Roach-produced 'Little Rascal/Our Gang' short films, carries through with an equally exquisite box set of the Laural & Hardy shorts; the time has definitely come....|`|YZxc3SnSaa	I was tempted to buy the full series with extras yesterday , but too much ￡ <br>  I,m laughing now thinking about the one when Stan has a bat on his face lol <br>  <br>  "You're wanted on the phone"|`|707gOCvbaa	I totally agree esp March of the wooden soliders.

3JwN7nUWaa	only one has naturally curly hair, and i think it's jessa, so the other older girls (jana, jill, and jinger) perm their hair.  i don't recall them mentioning hair dye.  i don't think they dye their hair, they just perm it.  all their hair is the same color it was on the first specials on discovery (14 kids and pregnant again, 16 kids and movin in, raising 16 kids, and on the road with 16 kids).|`|YBQvzEhGaa	I would say none of them.  they would more than likely not allow perms or hair dye.
pISC6pphaa	The five of pentacles can mean (among other things) that you are going through a period of hardship, loneliness, and insecurity.  Some cards show two figures outside of a stained glass window, which must mean a church. They are that close to redemption and comfort, but they refuse to see it. It signifies carelessness, and not taking care of yourself, or in this case of your relationship.    My advice: focus on fixing your relationship, repairing your friendship, by using the resources that are already available to you.  You know what they are, but you have forgotten them.  Hope this helps!

Celebrities should get more privacy. But people are so nosy that we need to know what "famous" people are doing.

SIqFa1mzaa	I check out DVDs from the public library all the time.  It's way better than spending money on renting movies.

cSceVisnaa	Peter CAN absorb powers like Sylar but Sylar can cut off people's head and take their abilities|`|ETIyrPIsaa	I also enjoyed the new episode of heroes and It has me really excited for the rest of the season!  My first thought was that Peter could only absorb the ability's of others through direct contact opposed to just being in the general vicinity, but then my brother pointed out that he can only have one ability at a time.  This can clearly be seen when he is throwing the guards around on the plane but when he accidentally touches Tracy and takes her ability and goes to punch the guard he says "Ow" and then gets beat up by the guard.  This would not have happen if he would have still had Mohindars ability.|`|t9zEzx3naa	i thought it was really good. my only problem was that everyone seemed so easily caught. peter got conned by his brother (big surprise) and matt/claire were staring at the drawing of matt being shot for like 2 minutes! Seriously is everyone retarded?    anyway, i think pete can only get one power @ a time now. at least that way he isn't all powerful and a one man show.    8/10

f07926461bdcfe322b6a09357c11df76aa	Firslty, your recordings quality is poor. Secondly, your songs need to be more dynamic (add contrast and build tension with soft sections).  I've provided some suggestions.  1) Really poor sound quality. Save up $100 bucks and buy 2 decent mics (used on ebay or craigslist if you must) and a mixer (Behringer sells them for under $50). Get some old mattresses, blankets, pillows, or "borrow" insulation from a house being built and line the walls of your jam room. If you don't have carpet, buy a cheap rug or steal some carpet pieces. To get rid of that echo. You can use Garage Band or Audacity (free) to record. You might try recording the vocals, guitars, bass directly into the computer, rather than micing them. Then, have your drummer wear headphones and record the drums. If you do this, I suggest using a metronome to keep time.   2) Make sure your guitars are tuned, they seemed out of tune on a few of the songs.  3) Add a bass to your mix. This will allow you a fuller, more dynamic sound.  4) Buy a cheap effect pedal and try using different effects. You may find that it makes you a more dynamic (if not better) musician.   5) Even though you're a punk band, you don't have to follow that genre with all of your songs. A keyboard may be a good solution to not having a bass. You can buy them cheaply at pawn shops.   6) Have your drummer/guitarist learn different techniques, like jazz or classical. I played classical and jazz guitar and, even though I don't play either of those genres, it made me a better musician and provided me with more techniques to use in my songs.   7) Try adding backup vocals. Even if none of the other members have good vocal quality, as long as they can hold pitch, it will make the vocals more full. Also, the vocalist should try different techniques. Billy Corgan and Isaac Brock (in my opinion) have terrible vocal quality but they are able to produce a wide variety of sound, making them great singers.   8) Try listening to other genres for inspiration.   9) Buy better instruments. Most importantly are amplifyers, mics, cymbals and snare drums. If this equipment is poor, no matter how the quality of guitar, other drums and musicians, your sound will be poor. Craigslist and ebay are great places to find used equipment cheap. The other day, I found a marshal stack for $400.   10) Play some live shows for your friends. Find a youth center or church who will let you play and recruit other bands. This will provide inspiration.   11) Record your stuff and hand it out at school. Your friends can provide you with good feedback and support.  12) Practice at least twice/week and each of you practice by yourselves. If you don't have a place to play, find a church, youth center or storage unit where you can practice.    Now, if you don't mind, give me some feedback: http://www.myspace.com/jkljkfldsajkfldsa|`|ifB3p0pGaa	pretty good the sound quality sucks but you guys are pretty good we really need some more real punk bands like you guys these days|`|DUGZa0Zgaa	Hell yeah dude!

2XBptnJjaa	If you read Vampire knight manga, then i suggest you see the anime.<br>  You can see it at:<br>  <a href="http://anime-media.com/category/vampire-knight/" rel="nofollow">http://anime-media.com/category/vampire-...</a><br>  You should also read/watch vampire knight guilty if you haven't already.<br>  <br>  Manga like vampire knight:<br>  Karin - In the 21st century, a family of vampires settled down on the grounds of Japan and lived a modest life whilst sucking on the blood of humans discreetly. However, the eldest daughter of the family, Karin Maaka, has an embarassing secret which cannot be revealed to anyone. Even though she is a vampire, she does not lack blood like her family members. Instead, she overproduces blood to the extent that she transfuses the excess into her victims, hence increasing their blood levels. Despite her troubling body characteristic, she attends school like any other high school student, that is until a new transfer student, Kenta Usui, enters her life. <br>  <br>  absolute boyfriend - Riiko is a girl unlucky in love. One day a strange-looking salesman gives her a business card for a website that sells "love figures" (androids designed for love-making). On the spur of the moment and without really understanding the implications, Riiko orders one for a 3-day free trial. She forgets to return him before the deadline, and must then work out some way to return the one million debt she now owes without anyone discovering about this embarrassing secret. <br>  <br>  Elfen Lied - The Diclonius, a mutated homo sapien that is said to be selected by God and will eventually become the destruction of mankind, possesses two horns in their heads, and has a "sixth sense" which gives it telekinetic abilities. Due to this dangerous power, they have been captured and isolated in laboratories by the government. Lucy, a young and psychotic Diclonius, manages to break free of her confines and brutally murder most of the guards in the laboratory, only to get shot in the head as she makes her escape. She survives and manages to drift along to a beach, where two teenagers named Kouta and Yuka discovers her. Having lost her memories, she was named after the only thing that she can now say, "Nyuu," and the two allow her to stay at Kouta's home. However, it appears that the evil "Lucy" is not dead just yet... <br>  <br>  Ayashi no ceres (Ceres:celestial legend) - Ceres was a tennyo (Celestial maiden) who came down from the heavens to bathe in a stream. She hung her hagoromo (robe) on a tree nearby, which was her key to returning to the heavens. But the robe was stolen and the man who had stolen it forced her to become his wife, thus producing a family full of human and tennyo blood mixed. Now, in modern day time, Aya Mikage is a descendent of Ceres, and has quite an ammount tennyo blood. On her 16th birthday, she and her twin brother, Aki, are thrown a party. At the "party", Aya's grandpa plans to kill her, for she has tennyo powers unlike the rest of the family, and can actually become Ceres herself and destroy the Mikage family. Aya, however, can switch back, so this transformation happens quite frequently. With protector Yuuhi by her side, it is up to Aya to control Ceres and keep her from coming back, but her relationship with an ex-worker for her evil grandpa may be a distraction. <br>  <br>  Fruit basket - Tohru Honda is 16 year old orphaned girl who gets invited to live in the house of her classmate, the handsome boy Sohma Yuki, and his cousins, 16 year old Kyo and 27 year old Shigure. However, these young men and parts of the rest of their family (both close and distant) hold a curse; if they are hugged by the opposite gender, they transform into animals of the Chinese Zodiac. Everyday is an adventure for sweet Tohru, as she gets to know everyone in the large family better (especially Yuki and Kyo), in both common and bizarre situations. But, the Sohma Family curse is certainly no laughing matter... it also holds horrible cruelity and heartbreak. <br>  <br>  Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne - Marron seems to be a normal, ditsy kinda of school girl when in actuality she is the reincarnation of Joan of Arc. With her angel sidekick Finn, she attempts to seal demons which are hiding in pieces of art and possess weak-hearted people. However with sealing the demons the art disappears leaving the police and her best friend Miyako, the police chief's daughter, to suspect her to be nothing but a common art thief. More strange twists occur when a smooth talking new boy in school moves in next door along with the presence of a new "art thief" Sinbad, who races against Joan to seal demons. Now Marron must race against the police and Sinbad to seal the demons and manage just to make it through school and a strange homelife. <br>  <br>  Rosario + Vampire - Due to poor grades, Tsukune Aono, an average high school student, has been unable to get accepted into any private academy of his choice. By exceptional accident, the only school to accept him turns out to be anything but ordinary; the school is attended by youkai (monsters) disguised as humans.|`|qKJUb2qqaa	Not sure what you mean by, "Like Vampire Knight," but I'll give it a shot~!<br>  <br>  fruits Basket<br>  DNAngel<br>  Fushigi Yuugi

Y1aAGPURaa	Brilliant answers given by 2nd grade school children to the following questions:    Why did God make mothers?     1. She's the only one who knows where the scotch tape is.   2. Mostly to clean the house.   3. To help us out of there when we were getting born.     How did God make mothers?     1. He used dirt, just like for the rest of us.   2. Magic plus super powers and a lot of stirring   3. God made my mom just the same like he made me. He just used bigger parts.     What ingredients are mothers made of?     1. God makes mothers out of clouds and angel hair and everything nice in the world and one dab of mean.   2. They had to get their start from men's bones. Then they mostly use string, I think.     Why did God give you your mother and not some other mom?     1. We're related   2. God knew she likes me a lot more than other people's moms like me.     What kind of little girl was your mom?     1. My mom has always been my mom and none of that other stuff.   2. I don't know because I wasn't there, but my guess would be pretty bossy.   3. They say she used to be nice.     What did Mom need to know about Dad before she married him?     1. His last name.   2. She had to know his background. Like is he a crook? Does he get drunk on beer?   3. Does he make at least $800 a year? Did he say NO to drugs and YES to chores?     Why did your mom marry your dad?     1. My dad makes the best spaghetti in the world. And my mom eats a lot.   2. She got too old to do anything else with him.   3. My grandma says that mom didn't have her thinking cap on.     Who's the boss at your house?     1. Mom doesn't want to be boss, but she has to because dad's such a goof ball.   2. Mom. You can tell by room inspection. She sees the stuff under the bed.   3. I guess Mom is, but only because she has a lot more to do than Dad.     What's the difference between moms & dads?     1. Moms works at work and works at home & dads just go to work at work.   2. Moms know how to talk to teachers without scaring them.   3. Dads are taller & stronger, but moms have all the real power 'cause that's who you got to ask if you want to sleep over at your friend's.   4. Moms have magic; they make you feel better without medicine.     What does your mom do in her spare time?     1. My mom says she don't do spare time.   2. Nothing. She pays bills all day long.     What would it take to make your mom perfect?     1. On the inside she's already perfect. Outside, I think some kind of plastic surgery.   2. Diet. You know her hair. I'd diet, maybe blue.     If you could change one thing about your Mom, what would it be?     1. She has this weird thing about me keeping my room clean. I'd get rid of that.   2. I'd make my Mom smarter. Then she would know it was my sister who did it and not me.   3. I would like for her to get rid of those invisible eyes on the back of her head.|`|LBlqBHaGaa	Have you checked your drawers for midgets today?|`|Q4yDLqR2aa	Something embarrassing to you.

BT5QzRHgaa	Pre-sales are not necessarily always the best seats. They more guarantee you to at least get seats. Ticketmaster typically takes about 10-20% of venue and sells that off. They usually take a few rows from each section. So if you get on nice and early you still can get some awesome seats, but its hard.|`|qDfKGaE4aa	ME TOOO!     I have the same question! I'm dying to see them here in Vegas and the tix don't go on sale until Saturday.    I think the pre-sale is only for a percentage of the total and then that's it. I called ticketmaster and they said promo codes are sent out for premium buyers who buy (and resell) tons of tickets.
4JppzNYeaa	Ok, first thing, its not the colour your after, its the material (bronze, silver). Colored saxophones are those cheap ones off ebay.  Brand wise, its up to what you like, I have a yanigisawa 992 but i used to use a yamaha TS-100.  If you can, try out the different brands because they all have little things different about them.  If you have no limits to money, for a material, silver is really top stuff, but it doesn't matter too much, its how you play it that will affect the tone.  I probably wouldn't rrecommenda jupiter or a selmer, but its up to you.    Good luck,  Matt

thcr8Y5vaa	Carrie Underwood...|`|88uIjItaaa	CU - american girl|`|9aac52bd187a4c3278570171778a711baa	i like taylors songs better, but carrie has the more powerful voice.|`|WodlreGLaa	I really like love story by taylor swift.  But i like Just a dream and all american girl by carrie underwood more.|`|TUBGXQkAaa	Carrie Underwood is by far a better singer although i love both of them. Taylor is good too, but Carrie definitely has more talent. she can hit more notes and is just more talented. i don't mean to take anything away from Taylor though cause she is great and is successful because of it!    you can just tell carrie is more experienced to cause Taylor is not that great live, but she is fun.|`|mu5wW7Tkaa	Definitely Carrie.  I've seen her in concert 9 times, and she just keeps getting better and better.  My favorite song by her is Twisted. But I definitely suggest that you go out and buy both of her albums (Some Hearts and Carnival Ride) because they are both incredible.|`|61704ecd7110569d54ceeff103c4b277aa	I like carrie underwood a whole lot better. i like all her songs.|`|X9H77A9xaa	love story by taylor swift|`|YWgrU1k9aa	Carrie Underwood. Her voice is more controlled versus Taylor Swifts, as you may hear in a lot of her songs her voice is shaky. Carrie sounds more mature when she sings. (If that makes sence)    Jesus Take the Wheel -CU  Forever & Always -TS|`|EtSzqI0taa	Carrie Underwood is a good live performer and has a nice, distinguishable voice.    Taylor Swift's voice is young-sounding and pretty, but she is bad at singing live (ie at the Country Music Awards - her performance was disappointing).    They have their difference so it's hard to compare them, but I prefer Underwood.|`|jXXRf7Hyaa	i like taylor swift (she is the only country i don't mind listening to)    i like the song cold as you ( i only own her first cd)|`|EHtFxGxMaa	Carrie Underwood.    Taylor Swift sounds like Bobby Brady when his voice changed.

pf8OEAG6aa	no loool  sorry|`|AQFwSLgiaa	Well I'm not going to say your voice can be as good as like Amy lee or Katy perry  I don't think you can change your singing voice. Your voice is your voice and you won't be able to make it sound different but only to widen your range.  I know this cuz I am in voice lessons for rock/opera and I have a nautral talent so I'm just widen my range.  You could also be tone deaf. You're not matching your pitch. You're having trouble matching your pitch. get training for it and you will be good in no time.  Take voice lessons to see if you can sing but from what I hear, you really can't change the sound of your voice at all but to only widen your range  Most people have to be taught to learn to key change and thats another thing you need to learn.|`|oFTbqICiaa	I think you need a lottttt of practice.    Potential....?|`|AA10962298	Simon says...Sorry, but NO!|`|10AvUf8Jaa	I am a singer/songwriter (not famous by any means though) and to be honest, I really think that you would benefit from professional vocal lessons. Your voice is kind of flat and you need help to learn how to control your voice better. On a good note though, you are not tone deaf, and a lot of your notes were on pitch. Keep trying and look into getting lessons. You'll be glad that you did. =o) Good luck!|`|2qpzoNGpaa	need improvement.  alllootttt|`|VbUpMxrvaa	There is a big difference between singing a song..and speaking a song.|`|ojNHRsj7aa	no but you can improve|`|ayPAKhngaa	not trying 2 be mean but u aren't that great. you might be a great guitar player, but give up the signing dreams. again not tryin to hurt ur feelings. find a new hobby|`|JCVs8W6raa	Depend on your voice!! there is big different between singer and musician...Hope you will do it . It's easy if you smart...|`|bezgko8Zaa	sorry, but no your voice isnt flexible enough. good luck though... its just my opinion|`|zBxLb0Loaa	-.- oh my god|`|wbyVocSjaa	your voice is very young, so i cant tell yet but in the future perhaps|`|Y2A6e34Saa	Find a song more within your vocal range :]

'Up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky' is not the same as the end of the alphabet song. If it is, you're changing it.

jOdzofOAaa	The composers are Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. A very FEW are Hebrew with the rest of the vocals,(as Lisa Gerard comments in an interview) sung with sounds rather than in a conventional language, are an example of melismatic singing. "It's a language invented within the music, inherently, and the words mean more than I can say in English", she says. "The way I sing is not new; it's been around since the beginning of time, and it's something all children are born with. It's not unique to me, but for some reason I never lost the ability". <br>  <br>  So its a mix of hebrew and melismatic style sounds. The Hebrew of the title is sung at Passover seders every year, "'atah anu v'nei chorin". Here are the lyrics:<br>  <br>  Song: Now We Are Free  <br>  <br>  Anol shalom <br>  Anol sheh lay konnud de ne um {shaddai} <br>  Flavum <br>  Nom de leesh <br>  Ham de nam um das <br>  La um de <br>  Flavne… <br>  <br>  We de ze zu bu <br>  We de sooo a ru <br>  Un va-a pesh a lay <br>  Un vi-I bee <br>  Un da la pech ni sa <br>  (--Aaahh--) <br>  Un di-I lay na day <br>  Un ma la pech a nay <br>  Mee di nu ku <br>  <br>  (--Fast tempo, 4 times--) <br>  La la da pa da le na da na <br>  Ve va da pa da le na la dumda <br>  <br>  Anol shalom <br>  Anol sheh ley kon-nud de ne um. <br>  Flavum. <br>  Flavum. <br>  M-ai shondol-lee <br>  Flavu… {Live on…} <br>  Lof flesh lay <br>  Nof ne <br>  Nom de lis <br>  Ham de num um dass <br>  La um de <br>  Flavne… <br>  Flay <br>  Shom de nomm <br>  Ma-lun des <br>  Dwondi. <br>  Dwwoondi <br>  Alas sharum du koos <br>  Shaley koot-tum.<br>   <br>  hope this helps :) below is a rough but maybe not accurate translation:<br>  Almighty Freedom<br>  Almighty freer of the soul<br>  Be free<br>  Walk with me<br>  Through the golden fields<br>  So lovely<br>  Lovely<br>  <br>  We regret our sins, but...<br>  We sew our own fate and<br>  Under my face I remain feeble<br>  Under my face, I smile<br>  <br>  Aaahh)<br>  <br>  Even alone/afraid<br>  Under my face I will be waiting<br>  <br>  Run with me now soldier of Rome<br>  Run and play in the field with the ponies<br>  Run with me now soldier of Rome<br>  Run and play in the field with the ponies<br>  Run with me now soldier of Rome<br>  Run and play in the field with the ponies<br>  Run with me now soldier of Rome<br>  Run and play in the field with the ponies<br>  <br>  Almighty Freedom<br>  Almighty freeer of the soul<br>  Be free<br>  Be free<br>  And imagine<br>  Free with peace at last<br>  It's lovely<br>  It's lovely, this land<br>  No one can believe or understand<br>  How far I came just for my lovely family<br>  I should have been there<br>  with them when the world crashed down<br>  But now they rest with me.<br>  <br>  I'll never forget<br>  How I felt that moment<br>  I became free.|`|WNxTv08Taa	Old Celtic/ Gaelic<br>  <br>  <br>  lots of luck finding anything to translate that!

rnqgiRkWaa	moon sign:<br>  <br>  You may be familiar with your 'Sun Sign', but what is a 'Moon Sign'? The Moon is said to rule your personality, while the Sun rules your individuality, while the Ascendant Sun dictates our outer appearance and mannerisms<br>  <br>  moon sign is very important, everyone acts like their moon sign in personality, first comes off as their rising sign, and has some qualitys of their sun sign..<br>  <br>  take it from a person with moon in aries, it kinda takes over everything else.. let me cover the bad so you have a heads up: we are FIGHTERS and lovers but when we are mad i like to call it diahera of the mouth, sh!t just seems to keep coming out and when we are mad we are manipulative and mean with our words, we dont mean half the things we say though, our emotions are powerful, we get possesove and jealous. when we suspect someone is lieing we will do the same thing back. we are revenge motivated. and we are VERY loyal UNTIL we get F*ed over then all bets are off and its anyones game.. we love deep and we are afraid of feeling vulnrable, big egos so we are most likely the last to say im sorry. we do get mad easily but it leaves as quick as it came and when it comes to the person we love we can forgive but never forget because that fear and pain sticks with us<br>  <br>  hear is what the internet says <br>  <br>  Aries is the first sign of the Zodiac. If this is your Moon Sign your personality is likely to be spontaneous and excitable. You are also militantly hostile in your expression of anger. You may be prone to periods of ire and irritation. You are very self-reliant. You want to have everything your way, and refuse to be pushed around by anyone. You are self-disciplined, and refuse to have others impose discipline on you. People either like you or hate you because of your impulsive behavior. You like taking charge, and will likely end up in a position of authority in your career. You are a natural leader. You set the pace and terms for yourself, and will choose your own vocation (regardless of advice from friends and relatives). The relationship between you and your parents may be difficult. There is a lack of both sympathy, and communication there. Your actions are considered to be impulsive and unexpected by others who are watching you. The Moon in Aries is a good sign if you enjoy original plans, adventures, independence and military life. You may be attracted to the study of the occult, or mysticism. You like to keep secrets, and that drives some of your friends crazy. <br>  <br>  <br>  i mean we are physically aggressive to..<br>  <br>  <br>  rising sign, you can tell by the time he was born.. <br>  that what he first appears to be<br>  <br>  libra, he probably takes pride in the way her dress's and is very social, he likes a group of people and he has an airy mind..<br>  <br>  <br>  he will always hold that pain he felt when you were with rabbit..<br>  <br>  also if you are a scorpio then you maybe play games with him testing his love for you, seeing his reaction to things etc (could be wrong, goin on a lim) with aries moon we fight fire with fire so he may see that and play them right back which both of you find yourself in tug of war..

B7WIZdglaa	Honestly, what I read about myself from my birth chart interpretation is pretty exact! I am alot like Sagg- my rising sign. I do have a positive outlook on life and bounce back quickly from setbacks. They also say Saggs keep their sense of humor, even in bad situations- I feel im alot like that.  Also, i'm very much like my sun sign! I think I am more passionate/possesive than someone without alot of air in their chart though, because I have alot of scorpio. In one sense, I love independence and am aloof in love (aquarius) but in another, It's all or nothing w/me. I like stability and knowing where things are going (venus in capricorn).. so my chart fits me perfectly.|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	I would say my first five planets strongly influence,, I'm the most Taurus person i know it's incredible. which is probably explained by the fact that i was born in the first Taurus decan and also have my sun,moon and mercury in Taurus.<br>  Also can relate very very well with Pisces and it happens tobe my favorite sign after my own. I have Venus and Mars in Pisces and its very obvious in my rromantic relationships and the way i deal with people and also my physical energy towards others.|`|8yqxdNp0aa	u mus b new 2 astrology, cuz u dont know aspectz have an affect on u, not always signz. u have venus in scorpio, but if itz making an aspect to say uranus, u will have sum uranian traits to ur love stylez duhh

I like the game. but flo rida idk, his songs are cool to dance to, but not to listen to. and biggie and tupac talked about REAL **** that goes on and big L flows with his beats. The game 50 cent are good but flo rida and fabolous are ight, but definitely not the best. People just like them cuz there main stream. and theres alot of rappers that got more talent then them.|`|sTwTXixXaa	The Game is okay and Flo Rida isn't the worse rapper in the world.  People love to hate.  It's not like they are the only rappers who made commercial songs.  I actually think Flo Rida has a nice flow.  Just listen to low and just listen to his flow.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn2pbIYnaRo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn2pbIYna...</a>|`|oMYGtqubaa	I don't like Flo Rida....   but, The Game is cool to me.

Whoever said I hated Game. Most of us like Game, and Flo is too pop. I don't really like him, but I don't speak for Y!A<br>  2. Excuse me, I'd like to see you even try to rap just half as good as Pac, Biggie, and L. And your saying nobody cares about them? Every hip-hop head loves Pac, Biggie, and L. Stop d!ck riding|`|ID8w4y1Waa	Calm doooown!<br>  I think The Game is alright actually, I have one of his albums lol<br>  but NEVER say **** 2Pac, Biggie and Big L!<br>  They probably influenced all those people you just mentioned even if they don't sound like them, so you might not even be listening to them now if it wern't for them.|`|89530f341f281197db6bafb67e488388aa	i love flo rida's new song its so cool and im not a fan of anything else of his. right round sounds good.|`|yoVF60ORaa	you're stupid as f**k for hatin pac big and l, but i got game is sick, fab has his moments, 50 used to be alright, and so did flo
FcHplZtQaa	What, Edward Woodward The Equalizer???|`|aKhZNd7daa	He sure is P and it looks like it could be an interesting storyline !<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/news/news_20090218.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/news/new...</a>|`|Um8osMNuaa	He could do, all the other cast are a little wooden, so he'd fit in well...LOL|`|Jaw2sW3eaa	Yes he is.|`|499b2674aceaca4224f1e97ffb73d7f7aa	I thought he'd retired years ago. I once saw him in a West End musical based on A Tale of Two Cities. Think it was a flop, BUT he had a reasonable voice, so perhaps he'll turn up as a musical act in the Vic. LOL|`|Y5IUse1vaa	Yes, apparently he will be seen as a nice elderly gentleman, but will really be a rougue in disguise!! Looks like a lot of fun!!!!!

HkSSJXE9aa	Pointe break he played the role real well like it was made just for him...don't get me wrong i still like the matrix and all and the devil's advocate, he's cool with me|`|L2VjIGKIaa	Speed<br>  <br>  Not only did it launch his career (Post Bill & Ted), the dynamic of an action film allows his limited acting ability to be hidden and compensated for in the manner of a bus that can't go below 55 mph.  <br>  <br>  With Jeff Bridges and Dennis Hopper doing fantastic performances, and a new fresh face with an adorable bob haircut driving the bus (Ms. Bullock), Speed was by far the best Keeanu Reeves movie ever.|`|cIqpL3tGaa	I saw a indymovie with him in 87 he was in it, i think it was called Rivers Edge, or River Road, he was just a kid in a small town, their buddy murdered someone, and no one really cared.|`|o9GOoSJKaa	by far.. "Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure" because it's a golden classic and a great movie|`|aajzynKsaa	Come on people!  Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure.<br>  It's his only character that didn't seem forced and<br>  unnatural.|`|h1IYS0dbaa	I agree 100% with Cilla!<br>  <br>  Edit: Usually, I never give such answers in Y/A but Cilla said it better than anybody else. I couldn't say it better.<br>  <br>  10 points to him please!<br>  <br>  Bix|`|lILfQh6xaa	Bill and Teds adventure. Took no real acting ability at all to play that role.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	Chain Raction<br>  part of that filmed was shot not to far from where i once lived|`|bbac4b209c6357b6a03f3c7be7d03de6aa	" RIVERS EDGE"<br>  <br>    ABOUT 20 YEARS OLD, IT WAS HIS COMING OF AGE  MOVIE, ABOUT A BUNCH OF PUNKS, AND ONE OF THEM KILLS HIS GIRL FRIEND, AND HOW ALL OF THEM COULD CARE LESS. BY THE WAY I BELIEVE DENNIS HOPPER WAS IN IT ALSO.|`|74f8e743f8a3465fff1898d42967fe25aa	Easily the matrix. His somewhat different, I won't say bad but it occasionally borders on that, acting style seemed to work in that movie.|`|lLN8VD20aa	Me too with Cilla.<br>  <br>  His robotic actions were perfect for that series of movie ... he really would have a heard time acting his way out of a paper bag.|`|tLI94qWNaa	I would have to say The gift, he played such a mean terrible man, and he was actually a good actor in this movie.  You could actually see his acting skills.  I was extremely impressed with Keanu Reeves, who delivers a genuinely haunting performance. It's times like this where I just can't fathom why many people still insist on picking on Keanu, regarding him as dull and cardboard. Personally, I thought he was great ever since his emotional performance in "Permanent Record." But he better demonstrates his versatility as an actor as the abusive Donny. He made his debut, as a villain, in the throwaway thriller "The Watcher," but I found him much more haunting in this role. Plus, he sports a rugged look, totally shedding his pretty-boy image|`|PpWosZsIaa	Speed<br>  <br>  Under a Bus going over 60 MPH to defuse a Bomb.. Then he had the brain matter to place something on gas pedal to keep bus at set speed until he transferred everyone off the bus. He and Ms. Bullock transferred just as the bus ran out of road.|`|S9bEtVCSaa	Matrix - because it was the only movie he was in where his poor acting was drowned out by the awesomeness of the movie.|`|bNRUjnGZaa	Replacements - He showed a little humor in that one<br>  I also liked Constantine - He didn't seem so stiff in this one.<br>  I also liked Bill and Ted's Big Adventure.|`|FkhFIIsjaa	Fast Times at Ridgemont High

One Fine Day, for the sheer pleasure of watching him at his charming best.|`|FKaoaD2yaa	Syriana, of course, for his truely outstanding performance<br>  Intolerable Cruelty, and Ocean's  11 / 12 - for his oh so yummy looks :-)|`|x7vB4P5Naa	From Dusk Til Dawn was an awesome movie!!!

DUGZa0Zgaa	When I do it myself I use 2 condenser mics, 1 dynamic mic, an 8-channel mixer, and run it into my laptop (using audacity for tracking).  <br>  <br>  In my opinion, Audacity is pretty weak, but it's free and it'll get the job done.  The trick is to use it solely for recording your tracks.  Don't even bother trying to use the effects from the program--they will really kill your sound quality.  The best way to do it is to make sure you have any effects and levels set where you like them before recording the track in Audacity.  Mixing the volumes in Audacity isn't a problem, but adjusting any EQ stuff or effects will make it sound awful.<br>  <br>  The band I'm in has a studio at our bassists house.  He is the founder of Steamy Attic Records, so he as everything we need and then some stuff I wouldn't even think to equip a studio with.  I think he uses Adobe Audition when we record.  He's got everything mic'd up nicely (individual drum mics, etc...).  everything is hooked up through a PA in the studio, so we can playback what we just recorded and it's all very user-friendly the way he has it set up.|`|wqg3GrI2aa	The kit my band uses to record are as follows:<br>  <br>  Guitars:<br>  <br>  - Shure SM57 mic (usually angled slightly left of the cone)<br>  - Marshall JCM 2000 with 1960s cab - With stock 60s Celestions<br>  - BSS DI box (used to bump up the signal before the preamp)<br>  - Shure Pre-amp<br>  - Fostex MR-8 4-track recorder<br>  <br>  Vocals:<br>  <br>  - Shure SM58 mic<br>  - BSS DI box<br>  - Fostex MR-8<br>  <br>  Drums:<br>  <br>  - Shure PG52<br>  - Shure PG81<br>  - BSS DI box<br>  - Fostex MR-8<br>  <br>  We also use Shure XLR to XLR cables.|`|8ReUKb7Baa	Not doing any for a while.... I do though have a lot to do with<br>  my daughters music.... i will get her to read this and see if<br>  she would like to contribute.....<br>  <br>  She is one hard gal to catch though!  Always doing one thousand<br>  things at once.|`|71SjVwWNaa	I am not lucky enough to really have a "studio". But on the other hand I have a spare room that I consider my "music room" that has my instruments, a small video recorder if case we want to record something, a few amplifiers, microphone you know the normal...I play mostly acoustic guitar, bongo's and recently picked back up my harmonica and started playing again so I am usually playing unplugged instruments. A buddy of mine is very good with the electronic equipment so if I need something recorded he'll set me up the right way and bring his own equipment which is a little more professional than my equipment. I'll give him a ring and ask him about Audacity, sorry I just play for the love of the music more than trying to record a demo or get my name out there.|`|aKBqMLuhaa	I'm not in a band but I'm gonna give you a star so you might get some more answers. ~peace~
AA11101361	As the husband said, we can make another baby, we can't make another her (or him, as the case may be).<br>  As for the baby, I'd keep both parts and tell everyone girl (since the odds weigh in favor of it).  Then see how she develops and once she's old enough to feel one way or the other have the surgery.|`|HUQQzph2aa	I didn't see Private Practice but I can comment on Grey's. I thought it was a good story line.<br>  I would want the doctor's to save my life, if it was savable, without me having any brain damaged...if I had brain damaged, I would want the doctors to "pull the plug" and save the baby's life.  My husband feels the same way, especially since we have a daughter already.|`|NwYwLdsNaa	1.  I would save my wife.(I would hope my husband would feel the same way).<br>  <br>  2.  I would have them operate on the baby now.  I feel it would be too confusing later for anyone to deal with.  I would go female.|`|L2VjIGKIaa	We had the same experience watching last night<br>  <br>  1) My wife would rather we saved the baby, I'd ask to save whoever was more saveable!<br>  <br>  2) I'd go with the odds and change it to a girl!|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Good Question,, That would be a hard decision. I would do what i thought was best.|`|ZhCJaXINaa	I didnt pay 100% to either - so if I get facts wrong, sorry :)<br>  <br>  Greys - I would save the baby. They were going to take out like half her brain in an ATTEMPT to be able to save here - there were still no guarantees (right?). If thats the case, save the baby.....<br>  It would be selfish to save your wife, because it wouldnt be your wife anymore, it would just be a shell of your wife.<br>  <br>  Private Practice - I really dont know what I would do here. I think I would definitely turn the baby into something, it would just be a hard chioce to pick - because what if you got it wrong.|`|Nhje1U06aa	1- I would save the baby- but it would depend on the risks who had mor eof a chance<br>  <br>  2- with the baby I would probably make it a girl. Kids are cruel to not do it!!!|`|SNVauR3laa	I would ask them to save my wife. Although that is a hard decision, he didn't know the baby at all. His wife would share his grief, and then they could move on. <br>  <br>  If my baby had both organs, then he/she would keep both organs until old enough to decide. I have seen on the discovery channel documentaries about parents choosing the wrong sex, and the ramifications of this.

They always award the movies that have paid the academy the most in kick-back money anyways. It's a waste of time and just another way for untalented, rich people to inflate their egos and pat each other on the back for another crappy film.
Ew7hXGFtaa	I liked it. The only issue I had with it was that the singer (growler, vocalist, whatever you want to call him) didn't seem to have a lot of power behind his voice if you know what I mean, it almost seemed kind of emotionless, and that bugs me a little.

b9wICW1Paa	A documentary film is supposedly an objective piece that lays out the researched facts, interviews, and other information and lets the viewers decide for themselves how they feel about the subject matter.  Propaganda is designed to definitevely sway the observer's opinion one way or the other, with little, if any moderation or middle ground.<br>  <br>  Michael Moore's films would, without doubt, fall into the category of propaganda.  Although he certainly lays out some facts, his films are put together to support his viewpoints or to show the folly of another viewpoint.  There is very little objectivity involved.|`|FZHAgpkfaa	Good question, and I think Fraud touches on it with the very thin line involved. But I personally say that the majority of documentaries out there are essentially the same thing as propaganda films. Documentaries are supposed to document what is going on, and like Fraud said, portray the facts without bias. However, even as directors collect facts on film, most directors run into their personal biases in the editing room with their films as they edit their footage into a solid story line that makes you believe something they also believe in. Such as:<br>  <br>  The King of Kong - Billy Mitchell is an *** and Steve Wiebe is a lot more truthworthy.<br>  Our Town - The kids pulled off a successful play and drama will forever be a part of their high school.<br>  Anything Moore does - whatever Moore believes<br>  <br>  The truth of the matter is that all documentary films have objective means and purposes behind them. Is that bad? No, watch the film, enjoy it if you want, but then do your own research about the topic and come to your own conclusions.|`|AA12397532	Documentaries record FACTS, though these days some documentaries are fictionalised too - but ten, they are called Docu-dramas.<br>  Propaganda films are different genere altogether.... Advertising film, a bigger length film plugging a product, company or idea.<br>  Sometimes, the purists mix up both. The dividing edge is very thin|`|AA11828439	The purpose. Mr. Moore makes documentaries.
oBjQXtxCaa	The previous answers have said it all.  <br>  <br>  What about lazer treatment.  It's expensive (about ￡2,000) despite what the TV ad' says but it is worth it.

The treatment is painless and only takes a short while to complete.|`|j0EmrNOlaa	def contacts<br>  ive been wearing them for 3 years now and im only 14, they are really easy to use and alot clearer than glasses as you cant see the rim of the glasses when you wear them obviously.<br>  they take less than a minute to put in but make sure they are clean before you put them in the next day the optician will show you how to do all this , the lenses i wear protect my eyes from the sun and dirt and stuff , even though they are kinda more expensive (well my mum pays ￡50 every 3 months ) i find they are much better than glasses and improve confidence..<br>  <br>  i hope this has helped xxxxx<br>  good luck|`|cYsPx9sSaa	its more dangerous using contacts for example if you fall asleep wearing them and something happens you could end up blind, but with glasses its alot more hassle during the day whereas contacts are more hassle during the morning and night, when you have to put them in and take them out,|`|QTgm2ZTvaa	use glasses when you don't do much moving ^^<br>  <br>  contacts are better i think.. just put it on your eyes and voila everything is ok ^^<br>  <br>  you'll get discomfort at first like there is something on your eyes, but you will get used to it..|`|rjsfiWt9aa	I like contacts because i am a very active person, i play alot of sports and glasses were always getting in the way, i even broke them once in soccer. Contacts are also alot less bothersom and i feel free!|`|MsW2wctbaa	BOTH, then you have power x-ray vision|`|odKmX3qbaa	glasses|`|B97bBAJnaa	yes|`|zYogzbcpaa	glasses. i have heard that contact lenses are much harder to put in<br>  <br>  x|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Contact lenses are better|`|Orx9cTJJaa	When you first start using them it feels like you have something stuck in your eye, and they're extremely uncomfortable. But after a while you can't even notice it. They're A LOT better and clearer than glasses. Make sure you have eye drops in case you get something in your eye. Also, do not rub your eyes.<br>  <br>  My mom told me all of that^^^^, I wrote down what she said because she's used contacts for about thirty years. She loves them, and says they're way better(in her opinion). I would give it a try for sure.|`|toLCaFc9aa	contact lenses<br>  I have use them for like 7 years and I love them. I really hate glasses, the fall, you lose them, they break. Contacts are so easy and nothing dangerous about them since they are so soft. You can't really do it, but sometimes I even sleep with them on, and so far everything ok. Try the contacts, you won't go back to glasses after that :)|`|m1RTNmqsaa	I wear both now. However whenever I was younger I found myself wearing contacts more often. I never even knew they were there after I put them in!|`|IizPFrELaa	Easy to use, very comfortable, can be a little unnerving when you first put them in your eye, but it gets much easier over time.<br>  <br>  I love my contacts...|`|J7HTo1psaa	I don't wear contacts lens, i wear glasses, i only need glasses for tv and school, and things from a far. :].|`|XnTdmC5Naa	Contact Lenses>>>>Glasses<br>  <br>  For the first 20 years of my life, I relied on glasses when I need them. Just last March I made the transition to CLenses. And I wish I would ahve done this a long time ago.<br>  <br>  They are a ***** to put on for the first two days. But after that, they are easy to put on. Don't have to worry about losing glasses or looking nerdy.<br>  <br>  Only bad thing is you have to take them out before you go to bed and sometimes I will be laying in bed with them on, but too lazy to get up and take them out.|`|AA12094990	Putting contacts in is a little hard to get used to at first, but eventually you get used to it. Once you do, it's really easy to get them in and out, and they're much more convenient that glasses, to me at least.|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Contact lenses! Simply the best - You won't regret it. Easy, comfortable, and simple.|`|NnlL3usKaa	I personally prefer glasses, I think they are easier to use than contact lenses.|`|ZNr4o1EEaa	glasses|`|HnccCVlVaa	glasses.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	my contacts are comfy.. they dont get dry.. its acuve i think.. and i can wear them with sunglasses instead of being blinded with my glasses|`|n2LrFlxIaa	Contacts are pretty.

If not, your really missing out. It's an amazing epic seinen manga and anime. I have trouble finding anything bad to say about it.<br>  <br>  The manga itself is set in medieval Europe, and the art is just stunning; each panel is a masterpiece.<br>  <br>  The romance in Berserk is deep, but the series is very tragic. It's very difficult not to get extremely attached to the characters. Be warned, this series is the definition of tragedy.<br>  <br>  The only caveat I have in recommending Berserk, is that it is extremely graphic in violence, gore, sex, and other very adult situations. I do not recommend this manga for anyone under the age of 18.<br>  <br>  I realize that you asked for an anime, but I recommend the Berserk manga rather than the anime  for the fact that the anime covers only a very small piece of the manga.<br>  <br>  I hope I was of assistance to you.

We are in a resection and i doubt we are moving into a depression.  And before you blame Bush look at the stock markets while Bush was in office, and look at them now that Obama is in office.  And look at the stimulus, it has Socialist agenda's, whenever the government is controlling your money you know it's moving towards Socialism.  And in case you haven't noticed Obama has a lower approval rating (41) than Bush did at the same time, if it stays just below Bush's he will be considered the worst president in history.

(In retrospect I should have talked to him about appropriate times to call time out...lol) I have met all the members of 98degrees and Shinedown....98 Degrees where great guys..very polite and easy going...Shinedown was alright...everyone seemed pretty cool...I talked with them about their music after their concert only briefly...the lead singer is pretty short...well, most of that band is suprisingly on the short side (I am 5'10 and the lead singer came up to my chin)....I have also met a couple NFL players offensive linemen(cardinals, bills)but this was around 1993-1994...they came to a sports banquet and we all had beers afterwards.|`|EPK6FzCdaa	my dad met justin timberlake and cameron diaz before|`|B3N388wBaa	Well, he's not really that big of a celeb, but he was on American Idol<br>  <br>  Sundance Head from American Idol Season 6<br>  He's well known here in Texas.

2zym4J9xaa	I am too.  I think its the combination of beautiful women and power masculine features.  Because there are unattractive women with masculine or feminine features that I'm not attracted too.<br>  <br>  I think Aniston and Alba are both really attractive, but one has very masculine features while the other has very feminine features.  I do think Alba has a much softer look though, and that is a turn off for me.  I prefer the attractive person with the stronger demeanor, that is what Aniston portrays.|`|4a5c54fee393ae7e3c43b29899037c62aa	Well look at Kirsten Stewart, Edward liked her and she looked more like a man than he did|`|xGyL7eRZaa	no, not me|`|frwlypDWaa	OMG. I'm a chick. Who knew...|`|IjKndeVvaa	Yes. I'd say I'm more attracted to females with masculine features. With Jennifer Aniston, I think I'm more attracted to her body, though. She's beautiful, but that body makes me go "Daaaamn."|`|4IVWMgp7aa	I think you're over-analizing things a bit here.  Jennifer Aniston is all girl, dude!

My friends disagree with me but I've always thought she did.<br>  <br>  I have a feminine face (full lips, oval face, pointed chin, arched eyebrow) but muscular arms and legs (think of Linda Hamilton's arms in TERMINATOR 2) and there are definitely guys into muscular women.
nErAWfHxaa	I usually test out as INTJ. Sometimes I test out INTP or INFJ but I'm usually INTJ.<br>  <br>  Like the lady above me, I shocked everyone when I tested out as an introvert but, as I tell people, the I or E usually comes from how you "recharge your batteries."

I am not a Kerry fan but if she wants more publicity by going on the next series of DOI then that is her choice.  As for Jason saying he will leave the show, he will not do that because he would loose a nice pay packet.

71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	How Oscar received his nickname is not exactly clear. The most popular story is that Margaret Herrick, an Academy employee and eventual executive director, remarked that the statuette resembled her Uncle Oscar, and the Academy staff began to refer to it by that name. Whatever the actual origin of the nickname, it was well enough known by 1934 that Walt Disney supposedly used it during an acceptance speech that year. Although journalists used the nickname with increasing frequency during the late 1930s, the Academy did not officially use the name Oscar until 1939.<br>  <br>  As far as the "Red Carpet" reference goes, it goes back to the Mughal emperor from 1605 to 1627. Follow the link for an explanation.<br>  <br>  Wolfgang Puck looks like a Wolfgang. It's his real name.|`|nb3dnbG2aa	i have no idea but i wanna know!|`|wA1dkeWRaa	The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, are presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS)[1] to recognize excellence of professionals in the film industry, including directors, actors, and writers. The formal ceremony at which the awards are presented is one of the most prominent film award ceremonies in the world. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences itself was conceived by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio boss Louis B. Mayer.<br>  <br>  The 1st Academy Awards ceremony was held on Thursday, May 16, 1929, at the Hotel Roosevelt in Hollywood to honor outstanding film achievements of 1927 and 1928. It was hosted by actor Douglas Fairbanks and director William C. DeMille.<br>  <br>  The 81st Academy Awards honoring the best in film for 2008 will be held on Sunday, February 22, 2009 at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood with actor Hugh Jackman hosting the ceremony for the first time.<br>  <br>  The carpet is red because in Europe, whenever a gathering of Royals would get together they would walk a red carpet signifying their royal blood.<br>  <br>  As far as Wolfgang Puck..... I guess because that's what his mom and dad named him.|`|AA12397532	Joe has answered your question perfectly. He is absolutely right about how Oscar was named and even the years. At the meeting where she said it reminded her of her Uncle Oscar - Walt Disney was in the Chair... he was the President of the Academy that year.<br>  Red Carpet's color is RED..becayuse a Red carpet cannopt be BLUE r GREEN. Red sort of extends grandeur to the whole scheme..goes well with any other color, be iit cool like vlues or warm like yellows or neutrals like White and Black. On the RED CARPET everybody stands out.|`|JY5MW1Qgaa	The Oscar is a stupid story. There was some woman that worked for the academy awards and she mentioned one day that the statue looked like her uncle Oscar. For some reason it stuck and that's how the statue became called Oscar.<br>  <br>  Wolfgang Puck is his actual name. There is no story behind that one, unless you ask his parents.|`|XIdDFNVHaa	Why is the Red Carpet...Red...for the Oscars..and why is it called Oscar?<br>  <br>  right! <br>  I don't have the patience to sit and watch people walk down the red carpet.

Taurus, Sagittarius and Aquarius argue a lot in my experience.|`|CcgDj9GIaa	Geminis are very good at arguments, I used to date someone who was a gemini and he would always win arguments; he would somehow someway find a point to his logic. lol|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Yeah, I would agree that Gemini and Sagittarians are good debaters. If I am in the mood, I can be good at it. I also have an Aquarius ascendant. Gemini and Sagittarius both do tend to have similar tactics and are open minded and can see different points of view. I'm like that. <br>  <br>  I think Aries, Aquarius, Leo, and Libra can be good at debate too.|`|rnqgiRkWaa	gem and sag are exact opposites, every other person says they are either great for each other or horrible <br>  <br>  their minds are always dreaming and phylisophlic they both have stubborness to it so its natural for them to be good debaters. <br>  aries are also very good debaters and some of the worlds best are aries<br>  my favorite to watch: sag and aries. its always fun and non-stop! <br>  virgo is persuasive which makes them good debaters as well

wA8Dyhq7aa	That is "You Never Even Call Me By My Name," written by Steve Goodman (John Prine came up with the title but refused to take credit for the song because he claimed it was "goofy" and "made fun of country music").  Goodman recorded the song in 1971 (on the same album with his best-known composition, "City of New Orleans") without its infamous coda verse but featuring an ending that was just as funny.  Goodman, however, always performed the song live with the coda verse (which was NOT written at David Allan Coe's insistance as Coe claimed in his 1975 cover of the song, but was written in 1971 as well).<br>  <br>  Goodman once said he didn't know the song was funny (given his warped sense of humor, I think he said that as a joke).  There's no question the song was only a good-natured rib (along the lines of Reno & Smiley's "Jimmy Caught the Dickens" or Homer & Jethro's "I'm Movin' On #2") and not seriously mocking country music because Goodman was a die-hard country music fan who toured with Jethro Burns (of the aforementioned Homer & Jethro) for most of his career (and Goodman's last appearance on TV was with Jethro and Chet Atkins) and recorded several country songs.|`|AA11306089	"Backwards" - Rascal Flatts.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's the exact one your looking for, but if you like that one, you'll like this too.|`|Kz7BsZk6aa	David Allen Coe's song You Never Even Called Me By My Name.

t8gHU5Glaa	Hmm, I'm bout like you. I've got dark hair, brown eyes, && tan skin. [But not quite as tann.] Also, your really pretty already but, if you want color contacts then get green or just leave 'em brown. Your skin is too dark to go any lighter then green. && as for your hair it's pretty long so keep it long. And, so you don't get real bad roots you should get wide streaks through your hair almost like your coloring it all but not all of it. [It's hard to explain, sorry.] But, it'd look good as chocolate brown, but don't stray too far from your real hair color or else roots'll be too notice able. Also, maybe shorter side swoop bangs would look good? Also, if you go with this look don't wear any pastels or light colors or else it'll make you look way too dark.<br>  <br>  :] Good luck, I hoped I helped.|`|94b168e3b778f875c1c60bf262ec0752aa	Sorry no good answer if posted in wrong section.|`|Nc7clhzIaa	Well it all depends on what you will be wearing, skin tone, & hair color.  If you want to wear contacts that is your choice, but why?  With the right makeup & clothing there is no need to change your eye color unless you maybe going for something very unique.  I would go with something that still looks like you, not fake if you know what I mean.  Most of the time you can't go wrong with a lil shimmer on your eyelids & lips to make an outstanding appearance.  Color is always good but not too much.

lm77DuW3aa	OMG!! Are you kidding me?? It's one of the best movies ever.. okay may-be not the best, but you should still know of it! I'm just very surprised, lol. Anyways it's main focus is about a girl Holly Golightly played by Audrey Hepburn. It's the movie that made Audrey Hepburn famous. Holly is a very spontaneous character who is very eccentric in a sense, and is fun loving girl, but can't really deal with certain feelings such as love. It's the story of her, which is very amusing. I don't want to give much away, but it's about how she grows up and how she deals with her emotions. She's not crazy or anything, but Tiffany's gives her that sense of love, that sense that she is missing from her life. I forgot the EXACT reason, I guess I'll have to watch it again. (and so do YOU!!) Watch it, I promise you you'll like it. <br>  <br>  In the book it says it's a movie. Blair watches it with Nate and Serena at Nate's house. They wanted to see it, because they it was Nate's mother's favorite movies. It then becomes Blair's favorite movie and in the episode after "A Thin Line Between Nate and Chuck" or something like that, the beginning reenacts a famous scene where Holly goes looking for Cat her cat. In fact Blair named her kitten Kitty Minky because of the movie. You know a kitty having the "kitty" in it's name.|`|JxCXqKaVaa	its sad but true, it is just a movie.

GdEBdbOsaa	i just dont know why she wants her death to be made public, some say because for the good of her kids but there is the notion 'just because one sends its child to a private school it doesnt mean the child will end up smart or even appriciate it.' for all we know this money could be counter productive making her kids lazy and not hard working|`|j5Z9XKFtaa	She will be dead within weeks or even day's. There's no way in the world the media would be allowed to fake such a thing. It would be more than there jobs worth, Never in history has the media ever done such a thing so I don't know were you get this from. No this is to serious.

However, I do agree that it's quite tasteless. She must have racked up loads already, and I'm sure they could live off of it quite comfortably! I think she should stop the news now and focus on her family.<br>  But as for the people saying to treat her with more respect.. by broadcasting every detail of her illness, she is allowing us to judge her and speak about what is happening. Just because she is ill doesn't mean the public should change their feelings of her character. In saying that, although I found her irritating on TV, I don't think any young mother - or person for that matter - deserves to be in her circumstances.|`|HP1pToMOaa	Several weeks ago on 'This Morning', Dr Chris Steele and Professor Robert Winston were discussing her condition. They were both of the same opinion that her illness was terminal. Now you have obviously not known anyone with terminal cancer but I have, 4 in fact, and she does not have long to live. Do you really think in your bird brain and lack of knowledge in life, that she would be having all this treatment if it was just going to go away.

I say good luck to her, and I wish her all the best.|`|7101ca25abf1e27ea43268cf9eca7944aa	I wouldn't think that she is pretending, any how it's the doctors that say she is dieing.|`|e9vcseLlaa	Me personally i think that she is pretending a little. She is Very ill still and can die by the end of the year or early next year. The papers today make such a big deal and exaggerate things. I think that maybe she has more days to live then it says.  Its maily money that it pays. If she would of had the HPV injection like all us have to she would be ok. And it wouldnt be bad and she'd live longer. TBH its a shame, I think her "husband" Is trying to get her money because of her fame and her 2 little boys it must be terrible.

I agree with everything you saying to me it's not that damn serious.|`|OEHiuDTCaa	Well, I'm not really sure abt it but you've gotta admit, Chris Brown was a total IDIOT to hit a woman!!!! Well, I don't have much proof if he HIT her but if he did then he deserves Jail for at least three years. <br>  It might have been a mistake but what sort of mistake? I mean, was he drunk or smoking cannibals? If he has anger control issues, he should use all those top dollars he gets from those dorky songs he sings and take classes. <br>  Conclusions: Total IDIOTIC FOOL but still feel sorry for him.|`|9wUrbqT3aa	"100% pure igonarance" in regards to your question  & pure choc answer.<br>  <br>  "Out of proportion...." or "it's not that damn serious."<br>  Domestic violence is a serious matter, if a person is famous or not.|`|QmeDzmN8aa	You NEVER, EVER hit a woman.

Why don't all of the fans care about them?

GlFEINN9aa	Hi im Haley im 17 .  I  think you should email her and tell her how you feel about her than you and her could hangout sometime,  If you love her just tell  her  but if she has a boyfriend  just act like you are her Best friend around him and than when he 's not around you guys you could try to make a mood .
DbNbWQflaa	she doesnt want to loose you as a friend, cancers are clingy and do not want to give up on anything including long time family friends,you hurt her feelings when you didnt make a move so she got a boyfriend. you should have told her your feelings and been upfront, you shoould run and tell her you cant quit thinking of her ,be real romantic and mushy and say it like you mean it,, pronto,she is waiting on you,

It's also a good movie on morals. That would be the best choice for her.<br>  <br>  Just like Heaven<br>  That's a good movie, too, because since the girl's a ghost and can't ven touch him, it's perfect.<br>  <br>  A Cinderella Story<br>  You KNOW this one's good because Hilary Duff's in it. So it's obviously not very graphic<br>  <br>  A Cinderella Story (2? idk, it has Selena Gomez in it)<br>  This is probably better because it has Selena Gomez in it. I don't think it's very graphic. There are also a lot of sweet dance moves in it.<br>  <br>  Step Up (1 or 2)<br>  These movies are awesome, and everybody loves them. They fall in love too, so yeah.<br>  <br>  Alvin and the Chipmunks<br>  Okay, so it's not really that romantic (well... the guy falls in love with that girl, though!) but everybody LOVED this movie!

They are not as great today, but when they were younger their voices were amazing and nobody else could touch them. Their only competition was each other. <br>  <br>  As far as other great female singers go, I think Christina Aguilera, Leona Lewis, Kelly Clarkson, Beyonce, Faith Hill, Joss Stone, Leanne Rimes, Carrie Underwood, Jennifer Hudson, Rachelle Ferrell, Toni Braxton and Alicia Keys all have really great voices.<br>  <br>  Some of the great classic female singers are Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn, Billie Holiday, Etta James, Patsy Cline, Aretha Franklin, Barbera Streisand, Minnie Riperton and Jennifer Holiday.|`|II0A4Qwlaa	Personally, Carrie Underwood is my favorite. She came into the music industry in an unconventional way, and she's very successful. You don't hear about many people you won American Idol besides Carrie or Kelly Clarkson.

There're many good female singers in this world...|`|yJKEH4I3aa	Honestly those of y'all who said ppl like Rihanna and Miley Cyrus :P ur really shallow cuz they dont kno ne thing about music. I agree with Ann Wilson though, but honestly those others cannot even compare to some of the REAL best female singers of ALL TIME. u can pick one if u want: <br>  (1) Aretha Franklin- her vocals are crazy and she really does have an amazing voice <br>  (2) Whitney Houston- no comment at all. Listen to her voice and it will tell u everyting that I wanted 2 say<br>  (3) Mariah Carey- (Back in the day) On her first album (self-titled) her voice is really amazing. This was back b4 ppl could use technology to enhance their vocals. If u eva heard Mariah Carey sing Vision of Love, Vanishing or even Dont Wanna Cry, u'll know wat I'm talking about<br>  (4) Celine Dion- NO COMMENT she is Amazing. One of the best I kno of. Her voice jus captivates u.<br>  (5) Etta James- Best of the best in R&B and soul<br>  <br>  De list cud go on and on but trust me Rihanna and Miley will NEVER BE ON IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|fIEmi84Laa	Alot of people might hate me for saying this, but Christina Aguilera.

6eb65d4c43950c1dd4d925b156525610aa	it sounds like your strings are sitting low. you should be able to adjust the strings down by the bridge there should be some screws loosen them up a bit until the sound goes away. its called fret rub if that dont solve it then the neck is probably warped. you can adjust this with an allen wrench if your guitar has a truss rod in it look around on the internet on how to adjust differnt stuff|`|AA10609634	That sounds like a grounding problem in the electronics.  Is your amp grounded?  It may be the amp, actually.  Take the V to a store, and try a different amp or two, and a different patch cable maybe.  Just tell the guys there that you are shopping for amps. <br>  <br>  There is some kind of ground fault there, I think. <br>  <br>  If it still happens, then it is the guitar electronics.  Unless you are an expert at this, I wouldn't mess with it too much, and , yes, you will need to go to a guitar shop.|`|svQeIZHFaa	I think there's something wrong with the pick-up.|`|uPqtcXHvaa	Sounds like you've got a problem with your pickup.  Does that sound still exist when you don't have it plugged in?  When you're playing just acoustic?<br>  <br>  If the sound is just when you're playing electrically, then look into replacing first: the cable between guitar and amp, trying the guitar with a different amp, then finally replace the pickup of your guitar (hard, but not impossible if you're careful).<br>  <br>  If you're getting the sound even when you play acoustically, you may have a cracked guitar or some other body problem, which should be covered under warranty, really.  So then your guitar shop should be able to fix it (or better--replace it) at no cost to you.  Actually, fixing the guitar electronics should also be covered under the warranty, too.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	It appears the action has dropped dramatically. That could either be the bridge has dropped or the neck has warped. Either way pretty serious.|`|H4rEZ0rCaa	You've drenched it with your teardrops. :(

Wfa4IgzMaa	An Oldsmobile 98. The "98" refers to the name brand of the car, not the year it was produced.<br>  <br>  It was a fairly big luxury-type vehicle made in the 80s by Oldsmobile. Kind of a cheap version of a Cadillac.<br>  <br>  BTW, in "Welcome to the Terrordome," Chuck raps "My 98 was '87' on a wrecker, yo! So now I go Bronco." meaning his 98 broke down, so he bought a new car, a Ford Bronco.

AA10634007	The 3D movies in this day and age use a well-known technology called Tru3D.  Instead of piecing the movie together around the capability of the glasses, the glasses were eventually adapted to the screen.  In other words, instead of splitting the image into segments across a three-dimensional axis the glasses are designed to, figuratively, "dissolve" the screen in front of the image.  By doing that, supposedly, any given image sequence (or clip) isn't bound by the dimensions behind the screen.  Regular prescription eye glasses distort and control the amount of light and the direction of images that enters your retinas, making any given images "clearer", so to speak.  In matter of words, Tru3D dissolves the screen and YOUR glasses distort the light surrounding the image.  So if you're still reading, then yes, you should be able to wear your glasses underneath the 3D glasses, no problems.  Not to mention the fact that I have done it several times, myself.|`|21eb1fee7277ed0dfc6c417c0a528dddaa	I have gotten headaches wearing just the 3D glasses, and then wearing them over my prescription glasses.

AA11230018	Yes! There is this awesome application you download from the internet called Tooble. Don't worry, its completely safe. I have McAfee, and I did a virus scan, and nothing came up. But what you do it go to <a href="http://tooble.tv/" rel="nofollow">http://tooble.tv/</a> and download it, for Mac or PC, whichever one you have. When you have it downloaded, open the program and search for a video! If you have one specifically in mind, and you know what its called and who its by, then you click the little square next to the name, and click "download selected videos". BUT that's just how to save them to your computer. First, you have to the tooble settings and decide where it should save videos you download. Once you know where, then download!<br>  If you want to put videos on your iPod, follow these instructions:<br>  1. Connect iPod to computer<br>  2. Open iTunes<br>  3. Go to Movies, under Library<br>  4. Go to File<br>  5. Click "Add file to library..."<br>  6. Go to the place where your tooble videos are saved<br>  7. Select the video you wish to add to your library<br>  8. Click "Open"<br>  9. Repeat steps 1-8 until you have all the videos you want.<br>  10. Sync iPod. If syncing does not work, try setting your iPod to manually managing songs and videos, and to enable disk use. Then, select and drag all the videos you want to your iPod. <br>  <br>  If none of that works, then I'm afraid I don't know what to do. If it does, enjoy!!!|`|xS4R8fdwaa	you can't|`|7QEcLWuzaa	You can try YouTube tool, it can automatically download and convert youtube video to other video and audio formats for mobile phone, iPod, iPhone, Pocket PC, PSP, or Zune ect.<br>  Free download here:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtubetoipod.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtubetoipod.org/</a><br>  Also, you can find some other software:<br>  <a href="http://www.ask.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ask.com</a>|`|6yMzit3naa	<a href="http://www.dvdvideosoft.com/products/dvd/Free-YouTube-to-iPod-Converter.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dvdvideosoft.com/products/dvd...</a><br>  <br>  download that, its free.<br>  <br>  then you just copy the video link and it downloads.<br>  <br>  you choose where to save the video then click itunes<br>  and import the video and sync your ipod and you will have it.<br>  <br>  If syncing does not work, try setting your iPod to manually managing songs and videos, and to enable disk use.

54aec0bc2f9af8beb26e9a78a5518ba8aa	Keith Urban's shows range about 2-2.5 hours long.  Since Taylor Swift is the opener, I'd say her show would last about 30-50 minutes and she'd mainly do her singles...Keith will be doing new songs off of his record (MARCH 31ST, go get it) and his singles like You Look Good In My Shirt, You'll Think Of Me, Days Go By, Raining on Sunday, Once In a Lifetime...etc.  His show will be about 19 songs long with hopefully a few covers thrown in.  Either way, it'll be one heck of a show.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	OMG, if they released what songs they did, why go to the concert.  No one knows what they will do, so you just need to go and see.

5uvTte8Zaa	My favorite type of music. <br>  <br>  I feel like they don't like it for a number of reasons. It's too agressive. They don't get it. Too loud.<br>  Too heavy. They are scared. Their morals prevent them from enjoying it. They listen to stereotypes.|`|wDCjzuPraa	YEH I LIKE HEAVY METAL HAVE U HEARD OF FIREPROOF I LOVE THAT SONG!!!!<br>  <br>  ANYWAYZ I THNK PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HEAVY METAL CAUSE ITS TOO LOUD OR MAKES THEM FEEL SICK|`|7nPNlVrzaa	I like Metallica, but some heavy metal is too screamish/violent/scary sounding.|`|stMX5oAuaa	Heavy metal kicks a**<br>  <br>  I think people don't like it because they cant handle it|`|mk6Hjp1Zaa	I love metal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, Black Sabbath mainly. But theres somehting seriously wrong with anyone who doesnt like any kind of metal.|`|fdMFsw7aaa	i like any metal, except for the sanitarium cover by anthrax.  i think some people don't like it because they're gay|`|geih5vR8aa	do u like rap, or Classical, or Opera, or blues, and everyother music out there?  <br>  <br>  People have different tastes and preferences. They don't have to like everything out there.|`|SazPJ3iKaa	Its my religion.  If thrash metal was a religion..... <br>  <br>  Some people associate it with low lifes and stoners, and don't want to be as low as them. Also some people don't give it a chance, because 'Heavy Metal' is supposed to be bad.|`|52otNiElaa	eh', for me it crossed the music line. And it's hard to cross my music line.<br>  <br>  The Leprosy, you are such a metal head stereo type haha.|`|eurqDxKCaa	I like it, but don't know why other people don't like it, yet again i don't even know why people like rap.
eT6SsCaraa	My favorite colors are blue and white.. I think it shows my pure, innocent nature.. and blue fits since I'm a water sign.<br>  <br>  I also really like purples.. greens.. browns.. pinks... dark red...<br>  I really don't like black, orange, yellow, or very bright shades. <br>  <br>  I'm just a quiet, subtle person.. I prefer to blend in. ^_^;|`|SaPkXOCaaa	My favorite colors are in a constant transition...I'm not sure why that is, but they tend to change with the seasons. Must be something to do with my mood. Right now, for instance, I'm loving purple and I'm feeling funky lately. A couple months ago I had to have yellow around me at all times...I was feeling very optimistic, I had a very sunny outlook. <br>  My default color is fuchsia, though...I ALWAYS love it! I think it says that I am a passionate person, not afraid to show out a little, and always comfortable with myself. <br>  <br>  I'm a scorpio...I don't know any more detail than that on my sign, but I would like to know how to figure out the rest!|`|nmwdQ6bQaa	RED<br>  because i always were red on monday<br>  when go school my some of my friends <br>  think that  i am a beach from hell is like my <br>  my personality|`|xEWVqdwnaa	i like maroon burgundy and black<br>  because i just do<br>  scorpio rising<br>  scorpio sun<br>  capricorn moon|`|jQotNGFQaa	Im a Scorpio, fave color is red. Idk I suppose that means that im passionate?|`|lrwSiwY2aa	Green. I like being outside and see things grow<br>  Aries|`|rDFnsFf2aa	RED|`|siuC4LNWaa	mines is  black, blue, and green.|`|mWv1Ql6vaa	Blue and Green. I think what it says about me is I like colors that aren't girly ( i play sports a ton, I am extremely athletic) also that i am a nature person.<br>  <br>  --- Aries :] (my colors match when I was born, I am a spring baby)|`|AA11318863	black..i m Aquarius...n for me black is the colour of dawn... it tells that i have patience to wait for the better rather best part..it suits my personality|`|pvbzVlNNaa	White<br>  <br>  Baby Pink<br>  <br>  Black <br>  <br>  Cream <br>  <br>  Sign - Libra <br>  <br>  i donno wat it says about my personality lol|`|pDLZ6BGyaa	Purple!!<br>  I think it means I am eccentric like purple...<br>  yet calm like blue..<br>  <br>  Not sure though..<br>  <br>  Sag Sun/Leo Moon/Gemini Rising|`|St56Pb7Paa	/* green. nerd. *\|`|zXAM0untaa	You're quite narky mate.chill your beans.|`|mD7eAAoNaa	Black<br>  I read in a book that a person who likes the color black is understanding in a quiet way. Black is a color of that supplies dignity without false pride and demands respect. Black is strong chiefly in its own right.<br>  <br>  I like the color because it can be very mysterious and very deep.<br>  <br>  Virgo Sun<br>  Cancer Moon<br>  Scorpio Rising|`|6ELSwKKvaa	My favorite color is turquoise/teal.<br>  <br>  It is my favorite because it resembles tranquility and water. ( I love water) It is also a peaceful color. I am drawn to it because I prefer tranquility in my personal life.<br>  <br>  My sign is:<br>  Leo ( don't know any more than that because it's not what I am into)<br>  <br>  BTW: My animal is a lion. I am protective of my young like a lion would be of a cub but for the most part, I like to lay around in the sun. LOL<br>  <br>  EDIT: Black is actually a lack of color but I like that too because it doesn't draw attention to my very large behind!|`|zrHE78DCaa	my fav colours are yellow and black<br>  i think it says alot as they are 2 completely different colours that some people think <br>  black = death hate sadness<br>  yellow= happy postitive good<br>  but i think<br>  black = calm relax freeing your mind<br>  yellow= my sister says its my soul colour its just so calming it releases the badness<br>  also i have 2 sides of me the side everyone knows (yellow i guess) and the side which only i know and is alot deeper (black i think)<br>  <br>  my star sign is tauras|`|47l1Sumeaa	My favorite colors are blue and green. I think the fact that I like blue means that I'm a calm, cool and collected individual and also somewhat serious when I need to be (I'm kind of serious ^.^). And the fact that I favor green is because I do like finances and money (Capricorns love money! :D)|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	I like all shades of blue, especially teal and turquoise. I have no idea what they have to do with my personality since I'm terrified of water. I'm Aquarius so maybe it has to do with the water in my water jug. Idk.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I like yellow, red, pink, blue, and green. <br>  <br>  Lately, I've been liking yellow and red a lot.

AA10756859	I like this year's Top 5 better but as far as the Top 12 goes I liked last year's Top 12 season better than this year's Top 13 season, from last year most of my favorite contestants got voted off too early.<br>  <br>  My perfect idea of last year's Top 5 would've been David Cook, Carly, Amanda, Michael and Chikezie<br>  <br>  My perfect idea of this year's Top 5 would've been Adam, Allison, Danny, Alexis and Anoop.|`|9UqzRdLSaa	Aside from Syesha, I really prefer last year's top 5 over this year's generally.  Both Matt and Danny IMO shouldn't be anywhere near the top 5.<br>  <br>  And yeah, a lot of really good contestants last year left too early, but that was mostly because the Top 12 as a whole was vastly more talented than this year's Top 13 as a whole.|`|9c1d789d67250c60a2b2be0af364b219aa	Oh definitely! Last year I thought the only ones that deserved to be in the Top 5 were the final two, David Cook & David Archuleta. This year though, I love everyone! I'm pulling for either Adam or Danny to win the whole thing, though. Allison is a close one too. And so is Kris. And I don't want Matt G. to win, but I do think he's very talented. Soooo, I love this year.|`|4fca82268fb53ac14ab31b22c0bd8220aa	This year's top 5 is better than ANY season's top 5 and it's better than the entire Season 3.|`|fTrLtb1Vaa	Yes! Adam is great, Allison is great, Kris is ok, Matt is pretty good, Danny is ok. I can actually stand everyone in this season's top 5!!|`|CeLYfRsEaa	yepp i agreeee|`|aUyopOWiaa	I think this year's group beats last year's by a mile. I thought the only good three last year were the 2 Davids and Michael Johns, who didn't even make it to the top 5! <br>  <br>  Thie year's group is all SO talented! The five who are still there are crazy good. And some of the ones who have been voted off are still amazing and will have a career in music, like Noop Dog :)|`|AA11190660	i dont even remember last years top five, thats how much the made an impact on me

cy7freI8aa	I don't think you are listening to the right stuff.

6JnAOYCYaa	Hello Katrina<br>  <br>  I am an on line psychic, as well have having used such services. <br>  <br>  I have worked face to face & via phone also, both of which are wonderful means, with regard to psychic readings as long as a link is made it doesnt matter how it is conducted. <br>  <br>  The only draw back from e-mail readings is that you cannot have a conversation, so questions cannot be asked by the questioner etc as it goes along. <br>  <br>  Sadhara|`|OgaJqkSQaa	Researching for a job? What do you mean?!<br>  <br>  No, I would not use online tarot readers or psychics. There will be some good ones out there who work online, but it's not worth weeding through the others to find out who's good.<br>  <br>  I've seen a few different psychics. One or two were obviously not psychic at all, and tried to ask me questions. I've seen a couple who I heard about through word of mouth and they were both excellent. Neither of them advertise either, because they don't need to. They don't work online or via phonelines either.|`|811921e95b3795dad10075b3f9e12029aa	Just to mention that the online I Ching does not work at all.  I have used this myself forever and it works fine when I throw the coins myself, or if other people throw them for their questions, but the online versions don't work.
yD5pz3Cnaa	Totally rigged, heres proof:<br>  Season 1:<br>  JabbaWockeeZ: West<br>  Kaba Modern: West<br>  Status Quo: East<br>  Week 7, Kaba Modern and JabbaWockeeZ, the two best crews are put in the bottom 2. Status Quo gets the top spot. Kaba Modern gets eliminated and JabbaWockeeZ beat Status Quo next week.<br>  Season 2:<br>  Super Cr3w: West<br>  Fanny Pak: West<br>  SoReal Cru: South<br>  Week 8, Super Cr3w and Fanny Pak, the two best crews are put in the bottom, SoReal gets the top spot. Fanny Pak is eliminated, Super Cr3w goes on to beat SoReal Cru.<br>  <br>  They've rigged this season even more:<br>  Week 5: Fly Khicks (All girl group) And Dynamic Edition (All girls, with one guy) are in the bottom 2. Dynamic Edition give the better performance but Fly Khicks move on) Then, Mario announces that next week is the battle of the sexes. The only way they could have a battle of the sexes would be for Fly Khicks to make it that far. <br>  <br>  This week here's what will happen:<br>  Quest Crew: West<br>  Beat Freaks: West<br>  Fly Khicks: South<br>  <br>  Beat Freaks will be in the bottom with Quest. One of them will move on and beat Fly Khicks.<br>  <br>  MTV hates having two West Coast crews in the finale, nobody knows why.|`|xplSmeCYaa	I don't even waste my time watching it, the first season was the sh!t they made you want to watch. The second season was ok but when I saw the line up for this season I knew that it was gonna be bad.|`|76740ad28a40658e6b40499a8b2cb447aa	I'd kind of like to see Beat Freaks win; not just because they're girls, but because they're girls who can dance. So if they win, I think it would be sad if everyone thought it was just to be PC because I think they deserve it just as much as any male crew would, especially since they're better than most of the male crews and on par with Quest. But if Fly Khicks win, then there must seriously be something wrong with this show. They should've been gone a LONG time ago, WAY before Strikers. But as long as Quest or Beat Freaks takes it, I'll feel the show still has credibility.|`|kfz95y8Oaa	I agree with you completely. Its def rigged so a girl squad wins. I started having my doubts this season and they slowly got confirmed after last night. Are u kidding me?! Those chicks who have been in the bottom all season knocked off Strikers who have been on the top all along. The judges aren't really judging they just wanna give the show "diversity". I'm def not watching ne more or ne other upcoming seasons!!!

LcSwDbr4aa	As for songs, I'd leave that up to you, although anime theme songs would probably work best for the audience (being at an anime convention after all).  A random kid finding the game would probably work best, since I don't think too many Hellsing organization members or that Regenerator guy would be playing too many video games.  As for battling characters, I'd use Seras, then the Regenerator, then Allucard, then Intergra.  Although to make it more entertaining if possible I'd change it from GH Hellsing, to GH Otaku or something like that, and then the battling characters could be from other series, like Dante from Devil May Cry (he does play the electric guitar), Chad from Bleach (plays the electric guitar/bass), Haji from Blood+(plays the cello), Henritta from Gunslinger Girl (plays the violin), Sara from Samurai Champloo (plays a sitar like instrument, Jin also plays it very badly), Link from Ledgend of Zelda (plays a mean Oricrina), Tatouya from Naruto (plays the flute), Midvalley from Trigun (plays a mean Sax)<br>  or Maj. Armstrong's little sister from Full Metal Alchemist (who enjoys the piano, well using them as weights anyways).|`|IGu36Iwwaa	If you can find it, get the guitar version of Bloody Tears from Castlevania for at least one song, classic track.<br>  <br>  For the most part though Id go with mostly power metal, some Sonata Arctica, Aryeon, Kamelot, Nightwish, and maybe some Manowar.  I doubt the songs the other person posted would work seeing as how rap and hip-hop rarely if ever include guitar work. Oh and don't use Dragonforce, unless someone is actually playing on a REAL guitar.|`|Krs6O0T7aa	I have songs:<br>  Heartless- Kanye West<br>  Mad- Ne-Yo<br>  Hot N' Cold- Katy Perry<br>  Womanizer- Britney Spears<br>  Kiss Me Thru the Phone- Soulja Boy feat.

lm77DuW3aa	The answer is sort of obvious.. actually very obvious. Even if her family is the joking type... you want to make a good first impression. They need to get comfortable to you, and call this just assuming, but I think they'll find your nakedness a bit inappropiate. I mean even if they are, as previously stated the joking type, they want the best for their daughter and no family at least no dad wants their daughter going too fast into relationships. Dads are extremely protective of their girls, they know how guys are when they were young and they don't want any guy to touch their little girl. If they see your "little boys" I'm pretty sure it would give them the wrong idea of you.. they want a sincere guy to be dating their girl and if they see you naked they'll think you're just another horny guy after their daughter.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying you're not sincere, but try being a little bit more polite and courteous. Especially for the first time when seeing her family. Show in interest an them and flatter them, you know butt kiss butt kiss (just kidding)... BUT don't push it too far, don't make it seem like you're fake be yourself and be at ease.. just not that at ease. That would be crossing the line and trust me unless you want it to be the last time to see her family... go in some shorts or something or ask your girlfriend if you can go to the store quickly and buy some trunks.|`|008512e32e60fcef19c7029ae0dc4d45aa	do it up.. you will never be invited back!|`|X6as2nOAaa	Ask them.|`|khFGiA1iaa	Uhm, if you are meeting her family... NO! This would be considered rude and disrespectful and gross. I trust you'll make the right decision and NOT swim nude. Swim in your undies or shorts at least!|`|L9VnwBoAaa	um hello .. . .lets emphasize on the FAMILY part.  do you really want to swim naked in front of her dad?|`|zu0W6hCTaa	ask the parentals, tell them u lost a bet with their daughter and now u have to be naked|`|zdGpaFlfaa	i suppose if the family is ok with it. or just swim in ur boxers|`|XBKv57u6aa	Unless your pants are soldered on, yes, you have the physical ability to swim naked.|`|XsmPnMU4aa	Why would you wear a suit anyways. I never figured out the whole suit craze. I mean your underwater anyways its not like people will see your junk while your in the water.|`|LLNlyaFaaa	i suppose so i mean if her family is fine with you skinny dipping then okay but i would ask if i could borrow a pair from her dad or something first!!|`|IjKndeVvaa	The proper thing to do would be to borrow one of your girlfriend's bottoms and let your boys hang out the side.|`|NpqAbZqpaa	if her mom is ok swimming nude with you, it's a go.  <br>  Don't put out on the first swim though, make her wait.|`|PN7XMglOaa	Yes , it sounds great .|`|jMAn10NOaa	i don't see why not. but don't wiz in the pool.|`|e566c7b6d9b860034b1ffaf13f380ee7aa	I don't care; go ahead.|`|FhrCLLzFaa	Well that would be weird in front of her family so I would say no.<br>  You should just save that for when you're alone with her!<br>  That's good your boys are clean and trimmed I hate when my bf forgets.<br>  <br>  oh and, <br>  don't be a fool; wrap your tool!|`|WZe1D2jaaa	I guess it would depend on her family.

AA11848003	It was certainly enjoyable. The acting was somewhat weak on the part of many of the younger actors, and the film suffered from too many cliches. However, Robert DeNiro and Chazz Palminteri delivered beautifully understated performances, and De Niro and Palminteri's struggle for the heart of the young protagonist keeps the film from delving into a typical "good vs evil" battle, and makes this a rather complicated morality tale. I also enjoyed the way the film played out in day to day details of the character's lives, rather than with criminal intrigue. If nothing else, this is a deeply thought-provoking and memorable film.|`|AA11323680	It's on my top ten list. Awesome movie!|`|AA10876984	I enjoyed it very much.  Good movie.

43fe22f7b04157dae7a820c7007497b3aa	I'm not sure if this is the same one, but I used to have one called Dollhouse Murders, or something like that.<br>  <br>  A girl moves in with her Aunt, who has just moved back into her parents home (her parents are dead, the house has sat empty). Anyway, the parents had been murdered, and the girl finds a dollhouse in the attic. She plays with it a bit, then puts it back, but the Aunt finds it with all the dolls put into the same positions as they were found dead in years ago, and gets angry.<br>  <br>  The dolls were 're-enacting' the murder, to show that it wasn't how the police and daughter thought it was. It was aimed at ages 12-13ish, I think. It's a lot like the RL Stine books, but preceded those by many years. It was an older kids book when I read it about 15 years ago.|`|AA10839105	I have that book its the dollhouse murders Im a millon<br>  percent sure

UrdDt4uBaa	OLTL<br>  Marcy....<br>  omg I can't stand her! She annoyed the hell out of me all that time she was on the run lying and saying that she was Todd's baby's real mother.

He just has no story line except to insult others. I also don't like Kate, she drives me nuts, whining, being difficult, nosy in her family's lives. And of course, the infamous Dr. Jonas. who knew he could sleep with half the women in Salem in such a short amount of time and claim to be in love with all of them? He was even chasing after Lexie and Nicole for a while.|`|AA11202477	OLTL - you are so right about Noelle. I love the character, but she doesn't sound like any Texan I ever met, and both my parents and grandparents were from Texas; I've lived in Dallas and Abilene, my 1st husband was from Dallas, I went to college in Dallas. And no, Texas Hispanics don't sound like they're from GA. And while we're on Hispanics, have you noticed that Tea sounds totally Caucasian until she starts talking to Cristian or Antonio (or Carlotta), and then her accent completely changes.  I laugh every time because I never knew anyone Latino who turned their accent on and off like that.|`|cr5TQgmUaa	AMC: Kendell, Ryan, David, Krystal<br>  <br>  OLTL: Marty the Party Girl -- her son needs her <br>  Blair -- she's so vindictive and she think John will just overlook it.<br>  Stacy (absolutely) -- she's up to no good<br>  <br>  GH: Kate -- she is just boring.

IT IS R&B FOR EMO LOVERS. And it is an important song in his career, because it's the first that invests him with a time and place: In California, in 2006, and one of the first r&b singers to have come of age during third-wave emo and apply that influence to his own music. A native of Los Angeles, the O's voice has acquired a tinge of West Coast punky nasal, which serves him well on the dramatic chorus, which is straight out of New Found Glory's diary: "I GOT THIS ICE BOX WHERE MY HEART USED TO BE." A little goth, too, non? Timbaland, producer of the song's dramatic synths and the cavernous effects, helps O's cause immensely by adding a wrought back-up vocal: "I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold," he sings, and does, in fact, sound as if he were afflicted with hypothermia. The song is, of course, about a failing relationship, and features the melodrama and style of contemporary emo. But here's where the "r&b" of this R&Bemo trailblazer comes in: Instead of scapegoating or vilifying the ex-girlfriend, Omarion "really wanna work this out, damn girl, I'm trying," and lists all of her positive qualities. Pure 100% Omarion: he doesn't mean no disrespect. He even said as much in a song.

db063898487ddeb1588583cb8d319980aa	I haven't heard anything recently, but I know that about 4-5 years ago an artist (or band) generally made between 55 and 65 cents per album.  That's how much money the artist CLEARED from the album.  Out of the money that the artist "makes," from the album, they still have to pay for the actual making of the album, promotion, etc.  The label doesn't cover much.<br>  <br>  I know that for every I-Tunes download, the artist generally makes 10 cents per song, or $1 per album.<br>  <br>  If you really want to see how the whole money part of it breaks down, you should read "So You Wanna Be a Rock & Roll Star," by Jacob Slichter.  He was the drummer in the band Semisonic, and he does a good job of outlining who pays (artist or label) for what.<br>  <br>  The only real money an artist can make is through publishing rights.|`|9102de1bdd6e4835171cbb2aec5f66c1aa	it depends how many copies are sold...a percentage goes to the artist the rest to the label they are signed to...don't forget tours!!!|`|1fbc63a82fd7efbf828aae44f26a3473aa	around $4-5 goes to the actual artist, the rest is given to the company.|`|fc6f73fe044a19131da132d57700e402aa	They make millions out of 1 CD but they don't realy say how much they make.

SY5gxN5faa	hell yeah hes one of the nicest in the game right now... too bad he's locked up... YONKERS|`|mZOt8oURaa	Overrated-He never lived up to his potential.Before he dropped his first album,he had numerous guest appearances on everybody's cd.He was hardcore but,when it came tro his own albums he was soft.How you gonna be hard and sing ballads?|`|bc92692e5171a576e30283eb2faec88eaa	=/<br>  <br>  A lot of people like him on here.

He sort of fell off though.|`|hA5m65Waaa	He had his run..alot of nice records, but his time is over|`|ci6f63Ifaa	He's made some good records but his first album was his best.  He's one of the better rappers from the late 90's early 2000's but he is pretty irrelevant on the scene now.  The commercial rap scene (MTV, VH1, BET, radio, etc.) is generally garbage now anyway.  <br>  <br>  There are a few people making a few decent records but not many.  I'm starting to get more into the underground and alternative rap scene. Many of these guys spit good lyrics and have something of value to talk about other than their money, cars, women, etc.|`|mtDllLYVaa	He's dope, I like nearly every song by him.....
nF7g8nphaa	There is a theme of contradiction. the amusement park is supposed to be fun, the Fair is fun- but then we face dangerous dogs.<br>  <br>  The whole thing is hard to read, literally, because it is densely typed in all caps with no punctuation or paragraph breaks.<br>  <br>  There is also a theme of  trust Vs mistrust of advise from others (stay away from dogs) and your own gut reactions.... your fears come true in the dream but then things are not as they had seemed to you when you were consumed by fear. This indicates both doubt of reality of what is in front of you and  a "Self-Fulfilling Prophesy."

H04o6RIRaa	It's going to end the show.<br>  <br>  Season 3, which is showing right now, is going to be about her becoming more and more of a spoiled celebrity starlet, and the movie will act as the Season 3 finale, kind of like how the Lizzie McGuire movie was for that series.   <br>  <br>  It'll be difficult to continue the series after that, since she is choosing to be either Miley or Hannah at the end of the movie, and if they continue it afterwards, it'll be hard to make the show interesting since it was all about her double life.  I'm sure ratings will go down if it's just a show about a celebrity pop singer, or an average girl.<br>  <br>  Also, my guess is that she picks Miley, since Disney will probably try to make it less superficial to give kids the right message.|`|4j0MMKMbaa	IDK but i dont think she should because she is getting to old i liked her better when she waz younger|`|deEWD1k3aa	I personally think in the end she'll choose to be Miley Cyrus.  I assume it will be like some sort of outro for her Hannah Montana career because she feels she grew out of it.|`|G7oAaXnUaa	It HAS to continue because Hannah MOntana is Disney Channel's most high rated show that they have|`|GgNtB6j0aa	hopefully =]

d2dkgYRaaa	Nope. All the Arians I know actually respect people with intelligence. Not only that, Air and Fire get along great. They feed each other what the other craves. Fire signs crave mental stimulation despite their passionate drives, and Air signs crave the rambunctious energy of the fire signs. <br>  <br>  Aries however, has an ego problem, and an Air sign can feed right into their ego, especially Geminis and Libras. Aquarius is the exception because they shy away from their own egos and would rather live a more humble/modest existence than being a super ego. <br>  <br>  Aries says they don't fear anything. Yes, they do. We all have fears. They just are better at covering it up. The most common fear an Aries will have is being dominated. Therefore, THEY will try to dominate as much as possible so as not to give in to their fear. <br>  <br>  So to say an Aries is afraid of intelligence is basically calling an Aries insecure of their own abilities, when generally they are not. They ALWAYS want to learn something new, especially if it gets them ahead in life!|`|QNK2p7snaa	OBVIOUSLY NOT. Because Aries are intelligent themselves.Besides this Aquarius ,Gemini and Libra aren't better than Aries in the intelligence ladder.<br>  Many of the Libras I have seen are dumb.Aquarians are smart but they are also modest.Geminis are smart but you can't rely on their mind.Its like cat on a wall.The best brains of Zodiac<br>  Aries,Sagg,Virgo,Aqua and Cap.(not necessarily in that order)<br>  <br>  I am an intelligent Aries with an Intelligent Sagg girl and intelligent Aqua father.|`|sNqB4S3Eaa	I don't think it's fear, it's just that Aries do not like to deal with details, and sometimes an air sign like Libra or Aquarius will have all the facts practically memorized from reading books or newspapers. You are correct that Aries are not as complex.<br>  <br>  By the way, Albert Einstein was not an Aries. There are plenty of intelligent Aries, but Einstein was a Pisces born March 14, according to the Nobel Peace Prize Organization and several other sources. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein-bio.html" rel="nofollow">http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physi...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Eins...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/einstein.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.crystalinks.com/einstein.html</a>|`|8DN2jyRsaa	brave,courageous,boastful aries,who fights for the underdog,frightened?,no i don't believe so.air signs just think at a higher level than the rest of us,and can appear very aloof at times as a result.ive met many air and fire signs in my life,and being a leo,i have a little insight in to what drives them.|`|mL7sbCL8aa	I will admit to some awe of Gemini when it comes to retaining information learned, but I would not go so far as to call it fear. Do you consider awe the same as fear? Then I guess so.<br>  <br>  First Grade Rocks already gave you the best answer, lol.|`|VVqJ1jHCaa	yes but mostly because they wish they were that smart|`|20b4pc5Raa	first of all einstein was a pisces.<br>  <br>  secondly, i'm an aries and i will talk mostly about myself. oh, and libras and aquariuses are among the signs i'm ''afraid'' of the LEAST.<br>  <br>  i consider myself smart in many ways (in other ways not that much, like in math, lol) and my only fear when it comes to ''smartness'' is that i may not be able to answer back fast enough (and cleverly) when debating or such. and as someone said above, i respect smart people, i feel awe for them.<br>  <br>  now, contrary to what i said above (those are the signs i dislike the most among with tauruses, just from my experience, if this matters), i believe that ANY sign can be intelligent, and not particularly the ''mental'' signs. actually, i know many people with those ''mental'' signs that are complete idiots in many ways.|`|AQwoCjj3aa	Yeah, sometimes, however I like when people just stop thinking and just do, it's so much more fun.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Every sign is intelligent in their own way.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Ahhh...I see your point.  I've read this before, "The worst thing you could do to a Fire sign is to tell them something they didn't know".|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	Aries dominated people fear nothing including intelligence.

Sk2m5Pq9aa	To tell you the truth there is no easy way to stop them. Mind you they are after one thing, getting their money back. So the best way to stop those annoying calls is to pay them, or schedule a payment. Another way is to get a bankruptcy lawyer and file bankruptcy; when they call, refer them to your lawyer, or tell them you've filed for chapter 11 or 7. These are not a marketing calls, so the government or any other entity is not there to support you from getting annoying telemarketers. These are rather calls from companies who you owe money. Thus consider the debt collector phone calls courtesy calls before you get sued. On a different note, at this time of economic downfall, you can easily negotiate with the collectors to arranging monthly payments and paying back less than what you owe. They don't want to spend legal fees suing you, nor do they like annoying you every day.<br>  <br>  Having said all these, there are ways to stop/slow down those phone calls. Take their call and tell them that you do not wish to talk to them over the phone, but rather prefer to receive mail from them, because it helps you to keep account of who you owe and how much. If they continuously call you, they are in violation of Fair Depth Collection Practice Act (FDCPA). If you can prove that the collector honored your request to communicate via mail and continued to harass you over the phone, you may take them to court, which will favor your lawsuit. Please keep in mind that the depth collector does not have to honor your request to merely communicate via mail. In that case you need to:<br>  1. Ask them for their address (not PO Box), direct phone number (not 800 number), and their fax number. Tell them it's because you need to have their full information if you are going to commit to paying them back. Don't forget to ask for the agent's full name, and the full name of his/her manager.<br>  2. Get your account number, the bank/company they are collecting your debt from, and any other information they may have on you.<br>  3. Send the manager a certified cease and desist letter asking him to cease and desist any further contact to your account number, address, phone number. Don't forget to fax that same letter as well.<br>  4. While they stop contacting you, and before they take you to court, pay off your debt. You may have a long time before they send a creditor to your place, and eventually take you to court. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your debts :)|`|CCA0mTgsaa	CHANGE YOUR NUMBER TO 1800-FREDDY KRUGER|`|aKvxy3xBaa	If she owes them money and doesn't have it at the time they call, they are willing to talk and set up payment arrangements that you can afford.

xi6g6uHraa	Hatsu Inu is a love story about two class mates but it is a henti so there is a lot of $€X!! it is very romantic, especially in vol 2<br>  <br>  <br>  You can watch in on here <a href="http://www.megarotic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.megarotic.com</a><br>  <br>  but it is an anime ???? film, henti.|`|68MfVJwGaa	Skip Beat! and Ranma 1/2 (my two most favorite animes)|`|LcSwDbr4aa	I don't really watch too many (if at all) animes in this category, but some that series that I have seen that have some romance to them include Fate/Stay Night:  The way Shiro Emiya tries to protect his friends and gradually develops feelings for his Servant Saber, is awesome.  <br>  Eureka 7:  Right off the bat in episode 1, The hero Renton declares his love for the love of his life Eureka, and then tries to act on it, usually with some sort of disaster attached to it (Holland and Talho's relationship is also great to watch as it progresses)<br>  Fruits Basket:  Not Romantic as in what you're probably asking, but still I found it sweet how Torhu tries to find everything nice about the Sohma family members.<br>  Cowboy Bebop:  The Length Spike goes to try to be with Julia, and the sacrifices she makes so he can live, it doesn't get much better than that.<br>  The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya:  Kyon is the MAN!  Of course I'd kiss Haruhi like that too, if the fate of the world depended on it<br>  Samurai 7:  The battle of affection between her love for Kambei and Katshiro that goes on within Kiara provides a nice change to the action, plus the romance between Shichiroji and his 'wife' is really quite sweet, and of course there's the romance between Kikuchiyo and Komachi.<br>  .Hack/Sign:  The relationship that develops between Tsukasa and Lady Suburu both in 'The World' and eventually in reality is cute.<br>  That's about it, pretty weak sauce, not much to show for it, but like I said, I don't usually watch too many Romance animes|`|Krs6O0T7aa	I really LOVE Sand Chronicles, it's really adorable, Vampire Knight is better then Twilight, Absolute Boyfriend is both romantic and funny...

HhpRxYSLaa	Yes, he will.<br>  First off, he already says new goal is to go back and destroy Konoha.<br>  <br>  Well, sense Konoha's technically already destroyed, he still wants to get revenge of the Konoha elders, so he indeed will be returning back to what once was his village. <br>  <br>  The main plot revolves around the bond between Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto obviously has not forgotten Sasuke and sees him as a brother of the leaf. While as much as an arrogant, selfish, revenge/power-seeking d-ck Sasuke has become, he still has not completely cut off his bonds with Naruto like he says he did.<br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/411/01/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/411/01/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/414/16/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/414/16/</a><br>  Sasuke still hasn't forgotten about his bonds to Naruto, Sakura, etc.<br>  <br>  Sasuke may be a genius in battle, but he is very easily manipulated. Madara took advantage of Sasuke's influential personality to get Sasuke to his side.<br>  <br>  When he returns to Konoha, he and Naruto will fight. This has been foreshadowed since part 2. Naruto will protect the people and his friends.<br>  He knows what a bond is, but knowing him he won't be acknowledge it until he has an epiphany when fighting Naruto. At this, he will side with Naruto and they both will fight Madara together.<br>  <br>  (This is my prediction, anyway)<br>  <br>  <br>  There is nothing to suggest Sasuke will be restoring his clan with Sakura. First off, there are more hints anyway that Naruto and Sakura will end up getting together at the end of the manga anyway <br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/297/10/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/297/10/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/297/11/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/297/11/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/297/12/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/297/12/</a><br>  <br>  The only conclusions you can draw now are that Naruto will be indeed reuniting with Sasuke. Sasuke will not die a bad guy in the end, because that would completely ruin the flow of the entire manga; since it's based upon the bond Sasuke and Naruto share.<br>  <br>  So yes, Sasuke will be returning to Konoha, he will be reuniting with Naruto (whether under good or bad circumstances), he does still know what a bond is, but there is nothing suggesting who he will restore the clan with.<br>  <br>  :D Hope that helps.<br>  <br>  p.s. Aisha below me had a lot of good points too. I also forgot to point out Sasuke has a possibility of dying at the end trying to kill Madara after redeeming himself, but all there is now is speculation.<br>  <br>  p.p.s. Sasuke wants revenge on Konoha elders because they were the ones who ordered the deaths of the Uchiha clan members, because they were planning on throwing a coup d'etat on Konoha, and since Itachi was the only Uchiha who obeyed Konoha orders and was ANBU captain at the time, they relied on him to do it.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	How would he restore his clan when his entire family and clan members were wiped out by his older brother?<br>  <br>  He's not interested in any relationships.<br>  <br>  He'll return to Konoha when he's powerful enough to destroy it.|`|ndXvMLZ2aa	Well, he's about to attack Konoha so it doesn't seem like he's going to come back but maybe, just maybe, he'll change his mind? Well, I hope so! And, I'm sure there's a better chance of him restoring his clan with Sakura than Ino, that is, IF he does come back and doesn't destroy Konoha...Although, maybe I just want him to be with Sakura rather than Ino...I really don't care about Naruto anymore..I lost interest in it right after Sasuke left the village a long time ago..<br>  <br>  Well, he wants revenge on the Elders because after he kills Itachi in the manga, Madara Uchiha/Tobi tells him the entire story on why Itachi had killed the clan. He finds out that Itachi was spying onthe clan for Konoha (Cuz loyalty to the village comes before loyalty to the clan) and Itachi was ordered to kill the clan. Itachi did but he left Sasuke alive cuz he just couldn't kill him. Yeah, that's pretty much why Sasuke hates the elders.|`|PxFtO67Faa	no he wont return to konoha and if you ask me the uchiha clan will become extinct like the kayuga and the ice ones.|`|uMBSPuzDaa	Well... he said in the manga that when he will return to Konoha he will be the one who destroys it .. so ... Don't think he will marry anyone soon ...|`|SMM9dziSaa	1. Sasuke will return to Kohona but only and only to kill the elders. Now does he really want to kill everyone as he said? I'm not so sure but he is dead serious about elders and anyone who gets in the way.<br>  <br>  2. Due to the above reason Naruto and Sasuke will have another proper fight just like at the end of Part 1. Why I'm so sure about this is because Itachi gave some of his powers to Naruto which are to counter Sasuke if he does attack Kohona, and the plot did not include this power transfer part just to ignore it in the end.<br>  <br>  3. Now I think that finally towards the very end, Sasuke will consider their bond seriously and show his redeeming qualities. I don't think he will die a villains death. He is going to redeem himself somehow. Maybe by fighting alongside Naruto with Madara and getting killed in the process or something. But this will be at the end, for now Sasuke is what Neji says  "in the depths of darkness".<br>  <br>  Now my pov of why Sasuke has to redeem? Because if he doesn't then the whole manga will be pointless and the main character Naruto will totally fail. Oro, Kabuto and even Jiraiya will be proven right about Sasuke and Naruto utterly wrong, and since we know who the main character is, Naruto have to be "right" in the end and "save" Sasuke from complete darkness. That is just the way the story is progressing.<br>  <br>  4. Lastly there is no freakin chance of Sasuke and Sakura getting together to restore his clan. Period. If anything we will see Naruto/Sakura in the end. Sasuke has a high chance of dying by the end of the manga. So like someone said before Uchiha unfortunately might be extinct by the end. Though I hope this is not the case.<br>  <br>  Bottom line we will see Naruto/Sasuke fight and then Sasuke acknowledging the bond and redeeming.<br>  <br>  And oh yeah, he wants to kill the elders because they ordered Itachi to  kill his clan.<br>  <br>  edit:Anna you explained it better than me.|`|rmz9MpDnaa	Well Sasuke has always hated Naruto for absolutely no reason. But his background with Itachi has always been rivals. Since he is already with Orochimaru and he wants to kill his own brother, I don't think he will be coming back but that's just my opinion, it's all up to Masashi Kishimoto, lol.|`|LMUiqfj0aa	ARE U SERIOUS COME ON HE WANTS TO DESTROY KONOHA FOR WHAT THE HOKAGE AND HIS ADVISERS DID EVEN THOUGH IT WAS THE THING FOR THE VILLAGE BUT I THINK HE'LL DIE BY NARUTO'S HAND CAUSE THATS HOW LIFE IS :)

hmsCFQocaa	Songs aren't "normal". They are "art". You may, as an artist, put as many or as few (none?) in your song as you desire.<br>  <br>  If you're trying to write a formulaic pop song, it usually has two or three "stanzas" of 4-8 lines which fit a beat or rhythm. There is a "chorus" which repeats at least once in the song to allow identity and topical relevance. At some point, you may decide your idea isn't clear enough and you may opt for a "bridge", or a piece of lyrics and melody that offset the stanza and chorus, also defining the purpose of the song. The bridge can be in any position in the song, but isn't usually first or last.<br>  <br>  Couldn't be this detailed without an actual lyrics set I wrote. In this song, the stanzas and chorus are actually grafted together, and there are two bridges, one with lyrics and the other an instrumental point to build the ending:<br>  <br>  Now That I’m Ready For Love<br>  <br>  Another year wiser, another year older<br>  Another day empty, another night colder<br>  Another squandered opportunity<br>  But now that I’m ready for love, no one’s ready for me<br>  <br>  I sift through these streets, filled with aimless dancers<br>  In calm desperation, still searching for answers<br>  Leaves green and inviting, new rings on the tree<br>  But now that I’m ready for love, no one’s ready for me<br>  <br>  Young maidens sense some hot wave of emergency<br>  They marry and mate in a false sense of urgency<br>  As the hurried home crumbles, the fingers point blames<br>  And all hold back burned hearts as they re-alter names<br>  Never considering a cause holding true<br>  That someone like me could want someone like you<br>  That someone like me could need someone like you<br>  That someone like me could love someone like you<br>  <br>  INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE<br>  <br>  Another year wiser, another year older<br>  Another day empty, another night colder<br>  Another squandered opportunity<br>  But now that you’re ready for love, are you ready for me?<br>  Ready for me?<br>  Really ready for me?<br>  Now that you’re ready for love, are you ready for me....<br>  <br>  Laughing Dolphin Music<br>  12 March 2007|`|N0JfmGrNaa	i'm not sure. its not really that important. isn't more about quality than quantity? i mean i know some songs that are just 5 short lines.|`|nxZQKmjMaa	that doesn't matter, as long as you are sure that the ending of the song sounds good, that it doesn't end abruptly and that it makes sense to you and to those who might listen to it.

DMxfGWcXaa	I've been a Hollywood Undead fan from day one (and I'm not just saying that, if anyone remember's the songs "the kids" and "turn off the lights" or even just the "i must be emo song" on their myspace in the old days)<br>  I am so proud of this record, I bought it twice from them when it came out. the song "young" is my favorite of all but I still love the rest of the record.<br>  <br>  I can't really recommend any other band though since I only listen to HU and find the other kinda gross and inappropriate (I'm referring to ICP and Kottonmouth Kings really), at least I know HU's being real unlike the others in my mind. um, my friend has a band that's similar, if you want to check them out. they're called Scare Don't Fear and they're a local band from Rhode Island.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I just remembered some rap rock bands and albums:<br>  <br>  faith no more (the real pioneers)<br>  lostprophets (the cd called para todas las putas celosas)<br>  linkin park (an obvious one)|`|OO7vNLjQaa	Senses Fail<br>  I Am Ghost<br>  Brokencyde<br>  Escape the Fate<br>  From First To Last<br>  Hawthorne Heights<br>  A Skylit Drive<br>  Alesana<br>  Scary Kids Scaring Kids<br>  Chiodos<br>  Those bands are pretty similiar :D<br>  Hope that helps you.|`|ExbiiL18aa	I love the album, it's such a great mix of songs.

Also glad they didn't give in and censor the album.|`|Oz9dSr32aa	One Day as A Lion and Rage Against the Machine are two great examples of rapcore. Korn has been linked with rapcore too.

It was one of my most favourite movies<br>  I am glad someone agrees with the same parts of it as myself.<br>  I mention the movie to others and they don't seem to like it but they also haven't seen it and are judging by the title and that it is a musical   but so was Jesus Christ Superstar and it too had great music.

Steve Buscemi portrays him<br>  5. The way he jacks the car and runs away from the cops is bad-***<br>  6. He is the only character in the movie who we don't know is dead or alive in the end.

ufLR9gvTaa	Tom Hanks, Edward Norton and Johnny Depp.  <br>  Honorable mention to Sean Penn, especially for his role in I Am Sam|`|6lkNOFNlaa	Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio are amazing, and even better when they are together. I don't know what it is about them but together or not, they are mesmerizing. I feel the emotions they put into the part and no one has chemistry like these two!<br>  <br>  Johnny Depp is also amazing - Edward Scissorhands is one of my favorite films and he plays the part so real you forget that there isn't really a guy with hands like that. He's awesome. <br>  POTC is one of my favorites too. What I love about Johnny Depp is that he can play such a variety of different characters and still makes the part so real in every one.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	Heath Ledger I think was great<br>  Also<br>  Johnny Depp-everything<br>  Jeff Daniels-gettysburg, dumb & dumber|`|5ddd4386484c069cb057c57372828170aa	Scarlett Johansson, Helen Mirren, Tom Hanks, Juliett Lewis|`|JCJVi8Qraa	Peter Sellers, William Holden, Charles Chaplin, and Spencer Tracy.|`|00390bee0bdfb56e0334bd2845fadd9aaa	Tom Hanks|`|AbqkNfJoaa	Angelina Jolie - more specifically, her roles in "Gia" and "Girl, Interrupted".<br>  <br>  Those are probably the two most emotionally charged roles she's taken on over the span of her career, thus far. I think what made the films really work for her, is the fact that Angelina IS crazy... That is, she has a real wild, dark side that the roles supplemented. To say she is a great actress, is an understatement, especially when watching her in these two films; she quite literally, doesn't just 'become' Gia Carangi and Lisa Rowe, she practically IS Gia Carangi and Lisa Rowe.<br>  <br>  And for the males, I'm going with the late, great River Phoenix. Such a promising young actor, he was, and his role in "My Own Private Idaho", regardless of how many times I watch it, always makes me forget that I'm watching him portray this drug addicted male prostitute. Instead, I feel like I'm watching a documentary of a drug addicted male prostitute that just looks a whole lot like River. But then, River always got really into the characters he played.|`|d55D0Ci4aa	Heath Ledger was an incredible actor!<br>  <br>  I would also have to say:<br>  <br>  Christian Bale - The Dark Knight and Equlibrium, he is amazing.<br>  Gary Oldman - The Dark Knight and Bram Stokers Dracula, incredible!<br>  Gerard Butler - 300, P.S.

I'll explain in a minute I need fooood.<br>  :D xx<br>  <br>  Do me a favor and ignore MELLOW LOVERS... comment because he clearly dislikes Geminis...So he will have nothing positive to say... I'm sorry if you had a bad experience with one but you can't stereotype them all as selfish and rude.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jeez, haha anyway... The split personality thing is a side of a Gemini you wouldn't expect to see. It will seem like a different person, but it's not really. The "side" many people talk about is the selfish and manipulative one. But we just become very sly and cunning when we feel threatened. Often they are people pleasers, and will tell you exactly what they really think of you when angry (which can hurt). They can be sarcastic...They also have very sharp toungues...when it's a verbal war they will win hands down.<br>  <br>  I am a Gemini, I have a gemini cousin, best friend and a few other friends.<br>  <br>  xx|`|821bd483afcea62cd9c3a4d1aa91236caa	the gemini's i've been around are usually very funny, outgoing and just good company.<br>  <br>  the personality split refers to how their mood/feelings and their perspective on things change quickly.<br>  twins represent gemini, so thats why they're known for their split personality.|`|Ru3Y8Mhdaa	They are always talking about themselves, they are selfish, they don't have patience, they love to gossip,  they are rude, and sarcastic.  If you are looking for someone affectionate don't bother a Gemini.|`|JnnBiFK4aa	selfish people and very bitchy..<br>  <br>  well, from my experiences of being with them|`|R2hbZi1Faa	I've had some very bad experiences with gemini men and women. They tend to lie about the facts concerned with their personal accomplishments.Always embellishing the truth to come off as cool. Never stay focused on one thing for a long time, kind of ''superficially charming''. They somehow always tend to annoy the hell out of me because of their overly lively nature and the fact that they act like everything is a game to them. <br>  I'm an Aquarius btw.|`|OgaJqkSQaa	I don't know about a split personality but are certainly two faced and nasty. In my experience they're fun and interesting, but on a deeper level... they don't really have a deeper level. Selfish, superficial and lacking in any real emotion or compassion.|`|FHlA35BLaa	I don't know if I believe in this split personality thing.I`m a pretty quiet type and I would say I don`t have a split personality or very much mood swings.I change my plans pretty often though but I wouldn't`t say that all geminis are nasty two faced people...I really hope I′m not :)|`|2CYfjPA6aa	talkative, two faced, airy, social, outgoing, optimistic|`|lcuxD3qlaa	ONe day they are super sweet, the next they are troubled and always aggitated...(sorry can't spell that word)<br>  My sister is a Gemini..so I know all about this sign...she's my best friend|`|8b3c815cf7b6e25156af573b754735d0aa	If you had been married to one you would know!!!

She is immature and doesn't accept responsibility for anything. She has major anger issues.  She is laughing one minute, and ready to kill the next.  When you first meet her depending on her mood (or personality) she is warm, friendly and outgoing but it never last for long. Oh and she likes to be the center of attention. (is that the same as selfish) idk. <br>  She is not even capable of real love. She always feels sorry for herself and is very lazy. <br>  She likes everyone she meets for a little while and then she turns on them and stabs them in the back and does this with her family also. <br>  I hope this helps.|`|LyDd0m7Waa	I agree with LeA1702<br>  We do have an "overly lively nature" and we "act like everything is a game" <br>  My mom tells me that all the time haha :)<br>  But it's just because we are like children, carefree and playful, always full of life.<br>  <br>  Gemini's are not necessarily "two faced" they're rather just bi polar in a way. One second we'll be happy, laughing and having fun, the next second, we'll be quiet, observing the things around us and just thinking.<br>  <br>  They are observers and deep thinkers.<br>  They can't keep their mind on one single thing, they go from one place to another all the time. <br>  <br>  Restless, lively, energetic souls.<br>  <br>  ?

The movie Twighlight wasn't terrible, but I think most will agree that in most instances..The books are a lot better than movies. The books always go into more detail, your in more control, and the writer can put in as much as he wants without worry about going over the decent time limit like directors or producers. Eragon for example was a great book, sad sack movie.<br>  <br>  Twighligt was an incredible book, O K movie.|`|ZACMoCdWaa	Books are always better.

She winds up becoming their queen of sorts and is dethrowned by the old queen, when all of the students find out what these girls have been saying about them behind their backs. Caddy takes the blame for it all, but in a Solomon like gesture Caddy gives a piece of the homcoming crown to everybody and all is forgiven and the plastics are no more. The resocialization is how the girls change from petty back stabbing shrews to caring classmates and it is relevent in that Caddy is always comparing High School to the wild and saying it is worse than the wild.|`|6fe070b9f470d901c00fa7e2f19239b3aa	Heh, why should WE do YOUR homework?

09ef19bcffd6e1bd8722a4b9c56e2326aa	Christina Aguilera asked Perry to help her write a song about losing someone, as she felt that it was yet a subject to tackle in her music. Perry was very open with this idea and thought she could relate to it really well because she had just recently lost her father.<br>  <br>  Linda Perry wrote out most of the lyrics to "Hurt" before showing it to Aguilera. Aguilera however thought it was too much of a personal song for Perry, because of many references to Perry's dad loss. Christina then decided she wanted to change some of the lyrics, so she took the song, and re-wrote many of the words to make it more appealing to any listener who lost a loved one in their life. Although it is not known if the original version of Perry's song was ever recorded, the one that made the album cut was the version co-written by both Aguilera and Perry.|`|453a78bc25877e5159a924a56854565eaa	I think it's about someone who died,coz she never had problems whit boyfriends...........but it might not be related to her in any way,it might just be a plain song..............& of course it might be about how she felt when she was young & her father mistreated her ......... we'll never know lol|`|6fb78688f11331831f50ec698abd8f11aa	go to chirstinazone.com|`|90adc70d307e2ea672c98adbedad7186aa	I hate her music,  she is like a sl-u-t with plastic wings lol

54022bd1b8d1ac8042eb1f4e2dc21eaeaa	Famous singer, of course:<br>  <br>  In his native Mexico, Vicente Fernández is hailed as the "king of the rancheros." He was born and raised in Huentitán el Alto, Jalisco, Mexico on Feb. 17, 1940 to a poor family and had to work since his childhood to maintain himself. Fernandez worked as a shoeshine boy, a waiter and dishwasher. Later, he served as cashier and manager of his uncle's restaurant. During his youth he sung at a festival in Arandas, Jalisco. He was booed off the stage by the audience. That day he proclaimed, "I will never come and sing to the city again."[citation needed]<br>  <br>  Vicente got his start when he won a Guadalajara singing contest. At age 21 he was in the show "La Calandria Musical" where he received his first payment for singing. He earned 35 pesos. He and his ranchera music have become most popular in Latin America and in Spain.<br>  <br>  At 21, Fernandez decided to make his living by singing. Initially, he sang for tips at the Amanecer Tapatio, serenaded drivers who sat waiting to move in traffic, and continued with "La Calandria Musical." From there he went on to sing with some of Mexico's best-known mariachi groups, such as Amanacer de Pepe Mendoza and the Mariachi of Jose Luis Aguilar. It was through these groups that he met Felipe Arriaga.<br>  <br>  Arriaga encouraged Fernandez to move to Mexico City, where he became a major singer on Mexico's No. 1 XEX radio station. It was through this medium that Fernandez was able to reach larger audiences and achieve initial fame for himself.<br>  <br>  Fernandez believed in fulfilling his professional duties and not disappointing his audiences. The night his father died was one of those occasions. He was ready to go on stage when he received news that his father has died. Fernandez went on with the performance. That night, he expressed such deep feelings through his singing that audience members, who were not told of his father's death until after he had left the stage, were in awe. As a result of this performance, many people started to compare him to some of Mexico's great singers, such as Pedro Infante, Javier Solis, José Miguel Jimenez and Jorge Negrete.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  Fernandez said his greatest accomplishment was when he filled La Plaza de Mexico, He asked the Mexican authorities not to charge the public for this concert. So certain was Fernandez that he would attract a capacity crowd he vowed that if La Plaza did not get filled he would stop singing.<br>  <br>  The day of the concert was cold and rainy. However, that didn't stop his fans as 54,000 of them showed up to hear Fernandez. His record still stands today as the largest gathering of an audience of any concert at La Plaza.<br>  <br>  Fernandez has made 56 albums. One of his best-selling recordings was his tribute to Trio de los Panchos, who produced two top hits for him, "Miseria" and "No, No y No." He has also recorded many compositions by such Mexicans as Armando Manzanero and Augustin Lara. In 1995, his tribute to Mexico's beloved Trio Los Panchos, Recordando A Los Panchos, earned him considerable acclaim and produced two major hits, "Miseria" and "No, No, Y No."<br>  <br>  He owns and primarily lives in a huge ranch named "Los Tres Potrillos" located between the cities of Guadalajara and Chapala Jalisco, Mexico. It was named after his three sons. It is complete with stables, 2 houses, a lake, high bred horses and a church. During Christmas time thousands of children go to this ranch where hundreds of thousands of dollars in Christmas gifts are given out.<br>  <br>  In 2005, Fernández and his sons, Alejandro and Vicente Jr., made history by becoming the first Latin American singers to appear as cartoons in a video, for Vicente Sr.'s song, Al Mayor de los Fernandez (To the Oldest Fernández), dedicated to Vicente Sr.'s father.<br>  <br>  Vicente has been married to Maria del Refugio Abarca Villase?or since December 27, 1963. He has had three sons with her: Vicente Jr, Gerardo, and Alejandro. His fans and the media refer to him as "Chente", a diminutive of his name out of affection but in interviews and events he is also addressed as Don Vicente out of respect. In Mexico he is referred to as "El Rey" (the king) and as "El Charro de Huentitán" (the Charro of Huentitan). His wife is affectinately known as Do?a Cuca. Vicente, just like his son Alejandro, is notorious for being a ladies man and is often called a Don Juan. [1]<br>  <br>  Vicente was involved in a scandal when it was made public that he had maintained a relation for ten years with Patricia Rivera, whom he met in 1977 while filming "El Arracadas". Years later she declared that her son, Pablo Rodrigo, was a product of that relationship and Vicente recognized Rodrigo as his son, giving him the Fernandez name. Afterwards DNA testing proved that Pablo was not his son.[2]<br>  <br>  In 2004, while in concert in Miami's American Airlines Arena, Vicente had to pay $30,000 USD for having gone over the original scheduled time for the concert. He sang for three hours some of his all time hits as well as songs from his then new album "Se Me Hizo Tarde la Vida".[3]<br>  <br>  Vicente has a star in Hollywood's Walk of Fame and his ceremony there was attended by over 5,000 people, breaking all previous attendance records.[4]<br>  <br>  The success of Fernandez's recording career boosted his chances for success in the United States, where he has performed many concerts. Recently, Fernandez announced that he planned to open a mariachi theme casino in Las Vegas called Guadalajara, Guadalajara.<br>  <br>  Fernandez remains very active in his 60's, playing to large crowds and having an ample discography that makes him one of Latin music's highest-grossing artists.|`|8b183a99397d58e64cc865fda2a99ea9aa	He's a very good ranchera singer.|`|AA10876984	For his ranchera music.

This is not an accurate question.  Horror movies are generally rated "R" or "PG-13".  They are rated according to content such as language or sex, not the "scare" factor.

If he got off the island, he wouldn't have to worry about the hypocratic oath.  IF, what she's asking him to do is for real.

Granted it's been a while since he's done anything heroic being a prisoner and all.  Yes, his emotions tend to be his undoing, but he doesn't seem like he's going insane at all. I also wouldn't get to wrapped up in the previews either since they usually tend to be misleading.  And I am still holding out hope he will kick some serious Other *** before Season 3 ends next summer.|`|759b251cb1f96062263eb5c2b92cf46eaa	But that's exactly what the others are trying to do....break him. How can he be strong when he has no-one to back him up and is locked away in the Hydra. He has to back down, it is the only way he has a chance of getting free. HTH : )

aNVpme3qaa	I as an RBD fan, believe that it was a very brave thing to do, and that this will not affect his career. In fact, I believe he has gained more fame and it seems like most people are accepting him for who he is. A lot of well known actors have already expressed their support and even though I was shocked when I heard this I will still continue to support him and RBD.|`|fcbda33284fdb0059e5bc23162c684a6aa	OMG he is SOOO CUTE!<br>  <br>  I'm a gay guy also. And we always know 1 when we see 1. I'm glad he came out, I knew he was, but was kinda in doubt, because of the Novelas he was in and acting kissing girls and stuff, although he would dye his hair like, every month to a girly *** color.<br>  <br>  I sure hope RBD continues and they don't go SOLO or something, because they are a really good band. and now with that GAY GUY!!!!  <br>  <br>  Uy Uy Uy  PAPI!|`|0cea9d6631a7fa0f0aafdde8ab6e51bfaa	Because he is.|`|AA10683974	He just messed up his career because now when you see him in movies or any show the only way you will see him or picture him is being gay!

66f44248f1323a4c60e69e24c71ff3f6aa	yes, there was one at my work a year or so ago.  Everyone thought she hung the moon.  However, she never did any work at all, pushed it off on someone else, talked on the phone on personal phone calls all day with her feet propped up on her desk and many many more things.  Still, almost everyone thought she was a complete angel.  It wasn't until customer complaints started really pouring in that she was not following up and not returning calls that some people started to figure it out.  Even now after she's gone, a few people still talk about what a wonderful person she was.<br>  I don't get it.|`|41deec41034911ed8509d5782e97346daa	yep, i know exactly what you mean. There's this girl who looks like an angel, and she's really good at getting you on side, b ut i just felt this really evil sorta vibe any time i was near her. I told my husband but he said it was nothing. So when her ex-partner died, she tried to take EVERYTHING, even though he'd changed his will and all, and her true colours started to come out. everyone in the family hates her now, and can't believe i was right about her all along. I stopped short of saying "i told you so' though.|`|45e1c3fbb80d6531ecb393ac6e5e57f9aa	I have run into quite a few of those in my lifetime...|`|73fd9d05834adced7ae56ac0e322ce77aa	Yep, known a few and divorced one.|`|1d947215e95e28b9d3c4e50691d323d7aa	Yes of course, too many of them. I never say anything though, to those who like them because it isn't my business and in time they will know. I hang out with those that have seen my dark side, that way I won't surprise them much.|`|332a26d36855ec723e68f5a1e338d4ebaa	Yup and she was ex-best friend too. I knew all her tricks. Now she's knocked up with some guy's baby who she's only known for like four months.|`|AA10686855	Our last preacher and his wife were that way. Some of us could just tell right from the start that there was something not right about them. It took the rest of the church almost 5 yrs, but we finally got rid of them after they split us 80/30.

9b4651e62f050dc633c36beaeead336faa	escuche en un reportaje reciente en una radio local que los ojos de los anime son tan grandes inspirados en los personajes de walt disney, especialmente los ojos de Mickey Mouse, ademas del realismo que le imprimen a las emociones de estos personajes|`|2b50dbb4030756d9e72d7954417f4ddfaa	Tiene que ver con la psicología de la percepción.<br>  son técnicas usadas premeditad amente para atraer la atención , principalmente en los ni?os, los mismo ocurre con la mayoría de los dibujos animados, prestá atención, en los cartoon también y en cientos de animaciones. Y otros rasgos también se exageran a propósito.<br>  Saludos...........|`|6d0aa15b1b810615f473658ad64f85a0aa	Simplemente es el estilo del manga que adquirió en sus inicios y así ha seguido, se usa para dar más expresividad a las emociones.<br>  Y bueno, no es regla estricta que tengan que ser así, algunos mangas y animes no usan ese tipo de ojos|`|89de17e195b01eddd93504fae6a03c99aa	Jajaja... pues existía un mito de que los orientales dibujan a los personajes de animé con ojos grandes porque así nos ven al resto de los mortales de origen occidental... y otros decían que porque tienen complejo de tener los ojos peque?os y querer por eso representarse a sí mismos en personajes de ojos grandes... o quizs también es por cuestión de estética de los personajes para que luzcan más "guapos" con facciones finas y ojos grandes y expresivos...|`|ZTFZHDecaa	creo yo, que  es porque lo hicieron los orientales y están acomplejados|`|b52bf11b457de803aec627629b406945aa	Seguro estan acomplejados porque ellos tiene los ojos peque?itos y no muy bonitos en cambio en el anime son grandes y expresivos tambien he notado que las narices estan peque?itas y bien deliniadas en cambio en la realidad la gran cantidad la mayoria de orientales tiene la nariz redondeada y chata.|`|e595cd5e33dfc30589c2658d768c8429aa	Es por el pinche Walt Dysney y el put@ de Bambie|`|feccebb8263d7cc60e7592ff2022e626aa	en realidad creo que inspirados en los personajes de disney|`|2393fc7755cc3df7400449ddc38e4629aa	segun los japoneses los ojos son la ventana del alma ....<br>  asi que hacen los ojos grandes para que ves .... heeee.<br>  bueno .. por eso ^^ adiosin<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNcGhEZUKsY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNcGhEZUK...</a>|`|36633098a78f56f2aa36659074878994aa	La respuesta es muy simple... los ojos son grandes porque eso refleja el sue?o japones. Te explico: los japoneses son los que crean esos dibujos... los japoneses son petisos, tienen ojos chiquitos y las mujeres japonesas no tiene tetas, ni altura, ni figura...(sin ofender a nadie). De ahi viene que esos dibujos tengan los ojos grandes.<br>  Presta atencion y te vas a dar cuenta que tengo razon!|`|5a35d82e1c476842229334e36b6082c6aa	Los ojos grandes se utilian en el Anime proque dan mayor expresividad. El pueblo japonés no demuestra de forma tan intensa sus sentimientos (como sí se hace en Latinoamérica) por lo que los ojos son la mejor forma de expresar emociones y de dar ciertos toques de comicidad.<br>  Y no sólo los usan en el Anime, sino los dibujos de Disney serían japoneses.|`|76b05302e7200bf06b3ab854692a7b33aa	por el truma que tienen los orientales de que no tienen ojos grandes  como nosotros...jijiji...ademas de que sus dibujos son muy expresivos asi que necesitan unos ojotes para poder hacerlos divertidos que sosos se verian con ojo jalado...|`|7ab2550c00f0989d8864bc9e774794a9aa	Es 1 complejo q tienen los japoneses xq tienen los ojos peque?os .|`|b93fc9bfe2d7cf388b9315f4e7824ce0aa	Porque en la vida real los orientales tienen los ojos muy peque?os.|`|be978fe3bcd484aa9cdb98a6747e2c6aaa	A mi me han comentado que es así como nos ven los dibujantes japoneses a los occidentales ,Les gustan más los ojos redondos de los caucásicos que los rasgados de los orientales y como son dibujantes exageran el rasgo haciéndolos demasiado grandes,pero igual les parece algo hermoso ,incluso algunas japonesas se hacen la crujía estética para tener párpados ,,,|`|cfbbf14ea9b789d5477b0ff48b1398c2aa	Muchas veces se ha comentado que es por el complejo que tienen de que casi son más raya que otra cosa sus ojos x'D (sin llegar al extremo de los chinos =P) pero que yo sepa (y por que mi hermano tiene un libro de como dibujar manga) los utilizan así de grandes para realizar las expresiones y que se noten por completo (muertos de la risa, llanto exagerado, felicidad completa, todas esas expresiones) la página del libro está llena de diferentes ejemplos de expresión en la mirada... y yo creo que para eso va... por que por ejemplo... las mujeres dibujadas que salen en Batman o Superman no son tan expresivas que digamos x'D, aunque claro, hay sus excepciones como las Chicas Superpoderosas, con tama?otes ojos, pero poca expresión... en fin, esa es mi deducción.. a mí me gusta como se le ven los ojos a los dibujos ^_^ saludos!!! ^_____~|`|a069095500bb73da742f4937cc671f09aa	Y va de nuevo la explicación, no tiene que ver con acomplejamiento como dijeron algunos , es por la influencia de Walt Disney. Despues de la segunda guerra mundial los personajes como Mickey Mouse entraron al mercado oriental y les encanto que como por medio de estos ojos enormes podian transmitir muchisimas emociones. Osamu Tezuka el creador de Astroboy fue el primero en utilizarlo aparte de ser un gancho para entrar al mundo occidental el cuál resulto bastante bien ya que fue un éxito. Los demas mangakas empezaron a utilizar esta formula y funciono tan bien que se utiliza hasta hoy en día.<br>  <br>  Hay animes donde los personajes tienen ojos rasgados pero son de corte más dramatico.|`|074a98cddf0b1251339ff2210345beacaa	Me imagino, por que los animes representan mas emociones, sentimientos,dolor,etc.....<br>  es lo que pienso yo!!!!!<br>  saludos, espero que lo puedas averiguar....|`|0700e65fe4a2d65428dc671f07d42febaa	Porque si les hacían los ojos rasgados no los iban a poder poner en el mercado<br>  <br>  :-)|`|260bc3d825589dc0e6a0ab38bb3b45bbaa	bueno como ya van diceindo a va mi humilde opinion jeje n_n<br>  <br>  bueno creo que como los japonenes tienen los ojos un poco chicos porque algunos japoneses si los tienen grandes pero por chicos quieren hacer en sus animes como les gustaria tener los ojos grandes y se ven bonitos!! jeje<br>  <br>  <<<<Saludos-----KarLa>>>>|`|66b23c4fa112ee410b371e443f9530f4aa	los orientales los tienen muy peque?os asi que los hicieron como les gustaria tenerlos.<br>  bueno ese es el sello del anime|`|728c0f18d984e053263f7aac84f97b26aa	Es que si fueran chicos los americanos no los comprarìan.

Me pidió que le guardara el secreto, pero confío en tí para que siga siendo un secreto: se trata de un nuevo caso de corrupción urbanística. Ese chalecito no está en los Alpes, está en Marbella, en una zona boscosa de dificil acceso. En el tiempo que estuvo (no recuerdo el nombre... bueno, sí lo recuerdo pero no quiero decirlo... por si acaso) en la alcaldía de tal ciudad, él y el abuelo de Heidi se conocieron. Este alcalde prometió concederle la licencia de edificación al abuelo de Heidi a cambio de que guardara el secreto a dicho alcalde sobre una recalificaciones de terreno ilegales. Pero el abuelo de Heidi, después de conseguir la licencia, abrió la boquita y lo contó todo, de manera que ese alcalde está ahora en la cárcel.<br>  Lo dicho, guárdame el secreto, ?vale?

En cuyo caso Viruta y Capulina  tienen más experiencia por películas como "Batalla de los pasteles", "Cada quién su lucha ", " los Astronautas" y "Viruta y Capulina contra las mujeres lobo pasteleras de Guanajuato"....<br>  <br>  jejejejeje, la última la inventé yo, además recuerda que nos fué bien con la histórica "Guerra de los pasteles", contra Francia...<br>  por cierto que en esta guerra de pasteles el único y rotundo perdedor, sería el pastelero de la pastelería que lloraría de ver todos sus pasteles tirados ó el incauto que tuviera que pagar por los pasteles lanzados (espero que no sean estos cuatro chicos, porque de lo contrario la pérdida del pastelero sería peor si tuvieran que pagar trabajando en la pastelería)<br>  Yo espero queusted, su majestad, lord de los chocolates, Don Carlos V, se moche con la lana para que los pasteles sigan volando por los aires y estrellándose en las caras de estos 4 maravillosos cómicos y humoristas.|`|T6ya7X08aa	que pavada lo que preguntás!!!!!!|`|2ae39051167d14b854647ed2d8848b4daa	en arabia los que ganan son el gordo y capulina  y viruta y el flaco  pierden siempre|`|569be94991e60500e8c0272053375705aa	Mi estimado Charles ... por supuesto que nuestro heroes <br>  Viruta y Capulina, ya que sus pasteles incluiían los moldes., ja,ja o sea  tenían más pegue!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Saludos de nuevo|`|DGeNXQvRaa	JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA, QUE BUENA PREGUNTA!|`|b2d726b13c3d1eb5e5d56a83ee3980d8aa	Capulina y viruta!!!|`|bae7dc6d4ca4e91b1b89c163ec6593b5aa	definitivamente esta es la mejor pregunta que he leido yo no estoy seguro quien gane lo unico que se es que definitivamente seria muy chistoso al igual que si pusieran a charles chaplin y a cantinflas<br>  SALUDOS!!!|`|eKVsUpvMaa	Por supuesto que la pareja conformada por el rey del humorismo blanco y su pareja: Viruta y Capulina|`|dddb9e8c45796ce8dc711b5a86094803aa	me gusta mas el gordo y el flaco, hasta he buscado videos de ellos, sin existo!!|`|61560a4a5a0bda07e5e37976b28d915aaa	Viruta y Capulina<br>  <br>  SALUDOS

Y aun cuando nada de eso fuera tan complicado no te matarias por ser quien eres eso solo lo hacen quienes no saben quienes son, es como decir por que un leon no se suicida por ser un depredador, ni una presa se suicida por ser el alimento de otro el juego es la supervivencia, la sobrevivencia, ademas significaria que soy el equilibrio y por lo tanto mi suicidio seria mas peligroso que mi propia existencia.) (perdon creo que ya debraye demasiado el chiste es no me mataria y viviria el roll que me toco por que para  algo me permitieron existir deberia haber un motivo de ambos lados y tal vez no es el que el ser humano comun cree y talvezz me tocaria averiguarlo antes de auto determinarme solo por que los demas me pusieran en un paradigma)|`|6c64c372c9e631ad438f325952fc3de1aa	jaja mi familia me lo dice a cada rato y todavia sigo viva|`|a06442036ade4acb0e45ce99ed24b003aa	Les recomendaria que no fueran tan metafisicos.|`|d4c0818f3ebab42e2d964a9611013e87aa	No creo q sea tan mala como para merecer algo así!|`|db967d65039f971d78e4a2f4794ac3b6aa	Reírme un buen rato|`|eaca3f6b0325b110e9754d949d1c87ccaa	mataria  a satanas  y luego yo|`|ef9628d243fce7a4ba0ffbbc9809834baa	Cholo, como soy un buen creyente,  me cago de risa.|`|9dedf6219e0990398c91327014d46487aa	No me extra?aria... lo he venido pensando jejejeje ^-^ Asumo que hubiese preferido saberlo para saber que hacer conmigo.

Cannell, producer of the TV show, is also producing)<br>  <br>  Cast: None announced yet.<br>  <br>  Cast Notes: (10/6/06) There have been many rumors in the last ten years or so about who could possibly star in this remake, but the first real bit of news is that 'A-Team' creator Steven J. Cannell would like to see Bruce Willis starring as Hannibal Smith (source: IGN FilmForce).<br>  <br>  Original Cast: Mr. T (Sgt. Bosco "B.A." Baracus), Dwight Schultz (Captain H.M. "Howling Mad" Murdock), Dirk Benedict (Lt. Templeton "Face" Peck), George Peppard (1928-1994) (Col. John "Hannibal" Smith)<br>  <br>  Possible Cameos: (11/24/00) Though the original cast members might not return to star, the actors who played B.A. (Mr. T), Face (Dirk Benedict), and Murdock (Dwight Schultz) may appear as cameos (playing someone else). (7/12/02) Talking to UGO, Stephen J. Cannell confirmed that he would like Mr. T to be involved somehow, but not as B.A.<br>  <br>  Director: Unknown<br>  <br>  Screenwriter: Not announced yet.<br>  <br>  Screenwriter Note: (10/6/06) There have reportedly been several screenwriters who have worked on this movie, including Bruce Feirstein, writer of two of the James Bond movies, Kevin Brodbin ('The Glimmer Man', starring Steven Seagal) and Richard Hatem (cowriter of 'Under Siege 2: Dark Territory', also starring... Steven Seagal). A new writer is currently working on the project, but his name hasn't been announced yet.<br>  <br>  Based Upon: The NBC TV series (1983-1987) starring Mr. T, George Peppard, Dwight Schultz, and Dirk Benedict about four falsely convicted Vietnam vets who escape from prison, on the run, working as mercenaries.<br>  <br>  My Opinion: (11/24/00) The script is probably already written (or being rewritten), but my opinion is that fan favorite Mr. T should be brought back as B.A. as the link between the old team and the new team. B.A. was only a sergeant, so he couldn't be the leader, but I'd still rather see Mr. T as B.A. than someone else acting like Mr. T. It's only right. As long as B.A. is still afraid of flying, of course.<br>  <br>  Premise: The A-Team are a quartet of former Gulf War soldiers on the run, who travel the world acting as soldiers of fortune. Here's how the introduction to the TV show put it: "Ten years ago, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire... the A-Team."<br>  <br>  Filming: Production had been scheduled tentatively to start sometime in the spring of 2001. There's no current word about when this might get started.<br>  <br>  Premise Notes: (11/24/00) No details are known about this film's plot yet, except that it will bring the concept into the present day, ostensibly with a new team of military men on the run (and not the original four cast members), probably veterans of the Persian Gulf War. (2/16/04) Mr. Cannell recently confirmed that they will indeed by Gulf War vets (though it's unknown whether he means Gulf War I or Gulf War II). (10/6/06) A few years later, it's likely that the war in question is the current war in Iraq and/or the "War on Terrorism."<br>  <br>  Genre: Action, Comedy, Remake<br>  <br>  Status: In Development

AA10358193	Meredith's 1/2 sister is having a baby. Meredith's father left her and her mother and started a new life many years ago, mostly because Meredith's mother was involved with the chief surgeon at Seattle Grace Hospital ...thus a new step mom and 1/2 sister.

9Yyk1p2Saa	Yes. Spirited Away is about a spoiled little girl whose parents have been turned into pigs. In order to help her parents she has to work hard and learn responsibility. It isn't bloody like Princess Mononoke. It is also a completely different story line. I didn't like Princess Mononoke but I did like Spirited Away.|`|zcgDyQGIaa	How could you not like Princess Mononoke?  Give Spirited Away a chance. Same animation style, but totally diffrent story.|`|AA11204355	i love princess mononoke and didnt like spirited away. So maybe you will have the opposite effect.|`|AA12054896	Well the story line is different. I suppose it depends what you didn't like about Princess Mononoke, if it was the animation and how the characters look, it will be the same in Spirited Away minus the more adult content, If you have seen Howl Moving Castle, spirited away is similar. My daughter loved both of these movies(Howls Castle and Spirited away).|`|CvIQOOkxaa	I didn't like either one, but I would have to say that Princess Mononoke was more painful to sit through.|`|lOGs0kIHaa	I loved Spirited Away,but if you didn't like Princess Mononoke then I wouldn't watch cause they're a little bit alike.|`|KFG48T0Kaa	it depends on why you didn't like Princess Mononoke. if that kind of style isn't for you then fair enough. personally i love spirited away, and i think it is probably the best anime film out, and it ranks up their with Pixar in cartoon terms. <br>  it's so different from western cartoons, and it's so much more original, and generally better. it even won an Oscar<br>  <br>  i really recommend that you should see this film! it's fantastic!

También toca el tema de los valores como la confianza, el prejuicio y la unidad familiar. Me sorprendió por que el final es bueno pero no lo que se espera que sucedería en cualquier película, un milagro! pero no, el final es mas bien metódico.<br>  <br>  Ve a verla y disfrutarla de principio a fin, le doy un 8 de calificación, pero esa es mi opinión claro.|`|04a870eac196f3dce6bfc579ebc69d45aa	VALE LA PENA, ESTA MUY LINDA.|`|7ab2550c00f0989d8864bc9e774794a9aa	vALE LA PENA IR A VERLA .   y no ,no todo es musical.

POR DESGRACIA. <br>  <br>  ATT<br>     <br>     <br>     <br>  LOS ROCKEROS|`|fMBGjtIfaa	El reggaeton es música muy fácil de hacer en comparación con la del rock. El rock a parte de tener una instrumentación elaborada transmite cosas como tristeza, rabia... El reggaeton solo transmite "Ven que te arrime la cebolleta" y la única elaboración que tiene es poner una base rítmica de fondo todo el rato igual y una letra que no tiene mucho sentido. Yo creo que es por eso, porque es injusto que triunfen grupos de reggaeton y no grupos de rock, porque estos últimos lo tienen mucho más merecido.|`|0f53b9f3b6b2db168944b4f01a8eb768aa	Esto es porque el reggaetonero es tan inculto e ignorante que no tiene los elementos suficientes para defenderse, no podrian discutir de musica con un rockero :esto es porque si analizan las letras del reggaeton no tienen sentido, su forma de vestir es una copia de la cultura Hip-hop; las canciones tienen el mismo golpe de percusion y la misma mecanica y secuencia. Asi que, de donde pueden respaldarse para defender su musica? Solo diciendo "esta bien chido no carnal?"(aqui en Mexico)<br>  <br>  Lo que es mas, todo lo anterior los rokeros y metaleros lo saben, por eso hacen los comentarios. Los reggaetoneros deben aceptarlo: su musica es debil y puramente lucrativa, mientras el rock tiene unas bases y origenes bien marcadas (jazz),por lo que aunque intenten demeritar al rock y derivados, simplemente, por su misma falta de informacion, se quedan cortos.<br>  <br>  Ah, por cierto, he notado que muchos que oyen reggaeton tambien les gusta    Panda ...................van de mal en peor.<br>  .<br>  <br>  Nada personal. Y si les ha llegado a molestar mi postura a todos los regtoneros, pues demuestren lo contrario no?|`|0CJoHbQJaa	Porque son unos nacos de primera, el renegron nisiquiera es considerado como un genero musical|`|6b9317e1987a4943e466f39f923879c2aa	Pues no es por insultar prescisamente, pero pues supongo que como el reggaeton (o como se escriba) es un de los peores generos musicales creados por el hombre, es una pena que la musica vaya cada vez mas bajo y que la gente sea tan inculta musicalmente hablando para dejarse llevar tan bajo cantando y comprando discos de ese genero, luego aparte no entiendo como las mujeres bailan esa musica y luego se quejan de que los hombres las tratamos como objetos, entonces que paso? en mi parecer se me hacen denigrantes esos videos, ademas de que dan risa y pues la mujer deberia ponerse las pilas en contra de eso o de la imagen que proyectan los disque cantantes esos, primero que se metan a una escuela de musica, minimo 3 meses o algo asi, al entrar uno a una escuela de musica, ten por seguro que se le refina el gusto musical y no comprondrian esa basura de musica, letra, imagen, y todo lo demas.<br>  <br>  En conclusion el reggaeton es una basura.<br>  <br>  <br>  PD: y no soy rockero.|`|7ab2550c00f0989d8864bc9e774794a9aa	Persolalmente , en donde yo vivo todos son regguetoneros y ello se pasan hablando mal de mi ," q si soy diabolica , q eso es del diablo , q si soy bruja , q xq me gusta eso",y otras cosas mas. Yo no puedo decir nada xq ellos son mayoria .<br>  <br>    Ellos nunca tienen q escuchar rock , nosotros si , todo el tiempo xq es lo q mas abunde , nos jarta y no podemos decir nada. Aqui nos podemos desahogar y podemos decir lo q pensamos sobre eso . Ellos no nos dicen nada aqui xq no saben de lo q hablamos xq nunca tienen q escuchar esa musica y/o xq todo  lo q piensan d eso se lo han dicho a cualquier otro rockero.<br>  <br>   Si no nos respetan no respetamos , pero tampoco estoy diciendo q todos son asi , algunos si nos repetan . <br>  <br>  Q es lo q la gente le ve al reggueton . Y las mujeres no c dan cuenta q las estan ofendiendo , pero con todo y eso lo bailan ,lo escuchan, lo gosan.Ellas OYEN  la cancion no la ESCUCHAN . <br>  <br>   Cualquier pende.jo  escribe y canta reggueton . Eso no tiene sentido. Escucha la letra todo es lo mismo: " Dala PERRA , Te voy a AZOTAR , HAs lo q yo te diga y todo sale bien , etc. "<br>  Y esa mier,da pega . <br>  <br>  El rock  ( como Linkin Park)  habla de las cosas de la vida , (Evanescence) habla de las situaciones de uno , ( Avrl Lavigne ) habla de amores pasajeros q lo q hisieron fue lastimarte . Otros tambien hablan de las situaciones sociales  , entre otras cosas . <br>  <br>  Eso si solo 1 o 2 de 30 ( x ejemplo)  reperos si es bueno como , para mi , Vico C , no es reggeton como tal es como rap , el habla de los problemas de la sociedad . <br>  <br>    Y bailar reggeton es como tener sexo con ropa , es exactamente lo mismo . El rock ... no c pero , a diferencia del reggeton , no quedas pre?a x " bailarlo" . <br>  <br>   Para componer 1 cancion d rock , tienes q estar preciso del tema del cual vas a hablar , siente la cancion , q tenga sentido y muchas otras cosas ; para escribir 1 d reggeton , como dijeron aqui , pensar en sexo , la mafia , imaginate q le estas hablando a 1 palo de escoda xq asi se te hace mas facil dedicarle 1 cincion a 1 mujer en reggeton , entre otras  cosas . <br>  <br>  Si , en termino de sonido , el rock es como de salvajes , el reggeton es mejor pq la musica te deja llevar ( yo prefiero esa musica "salvaje" ) y es mas pegajosa. Pero si le hasemos caso a la letra el reggeton es mas salvaje q el rock ; el rock significa algo y tiene mas sentido.<br>  <br>  En conclucion: El reggeton , sera lo q esta a la moda pero no nos ayuda a evolucionar, como creen q vamos a seguir para a lante si tenemos canciones q habla d la mujer como algo , como 1 ramera , matar , de pegar cuernos " No digas na q mi novia no sabe na ; Dale vamos a " jugar " pa enfogonar a tu novio."<br>  <br>  El rock , aunque no este tanto , esta 1 poco mas evolucionado q el reggeton , habla de superacion, amor , pero tambien de lo malo , de deprecion , de algun familiar q murio ,etc . <br>  <br>   Prefiero , personal mente , escuchar musica de gente q hable de cosas malas , pero muy pocas cosa ( y depende del artista tambien) , pero tenbien cantan de cosas bien lindas ; A escuchar musica q SIEMPRE estan hablando de cosa negativas q lo q hace es da?arle la mente a los ni?os, como es lo mas escuchado y es lo q c escucha en todos los lugares .  <br>  <br>  <br>   Espero q te haya contestado bastante esta pregunta .|`|TT5blM5taa	"Como te ven, te tratan"|`|626e9a8b5bdb353ac585242b1b487768aa	adhiero.... toda la onda... pero da para que los ca guen a pu te adas... a mi me gusta el reggaton y el rock :D|`|BcDOosmUaa	bueno en mi pais es al reves  algunos raperos nos insultan a nosotros telo digo por que en la escula ami me in sultan mucho yo no tengo nada contra ellospero cada quien tiene su genero y cual que nosotro y devemos respetarnos mutuamaente|`|DlaC2Lp8aa	Mira a mi me gusta el rock y tengo amigos que escuchan mucho reegaeton , pero no por eso los insulto, vivimos una amistad muy agradable , claro que si les digo que tiene las mentes huecas y ellos saben que es verdad, pero ya , no mas , me agote de escribir tanto acercade esa porqueria en otra repuesta a otra pregunta tuya , perdon pero no me habia fijado de esta ,asi que: copio , pego y<br>  <br>  Con respecto al reegaeton, y mira , yo no estoy diociendote que escuches musica diabolica porque tambien la considero horrible , el que tu seas una ignorante y no conozcas de musica no es problema mio , te puedo recomendar que escuches rock , y este genero no es zatanico ni subliminal , solo por el hecho de que lo interpreten en ingles, yo lo que digo es que el reegaeton carece de sentido y es un insulto para la musica de verdad. Existen diversos tipos de rock , y si hay algunas bandas que zatanizan la musica pero eso conmigo no va , por o que me parece un insulto que digas que yo escucho esa clase de musica , vale la pena que escuches un grupo como Bon Jovi , tocan rock , pero un rock muy suave y agradable, y a veces romantico. Porque eso si es musica,los acordes de guitarra, las voces impecables, es simplemente admirable , en cambio el reegaeton no tiene nada de eso , que es sabroso bailarlo , bueno tal vez con mi novia , pero cantarlo no requiere de talento, lo unico que hay que hacer es hablar golpeado y con palabras vulgares, ademas de donde crees que salio daddy yankee, sino de un barrio de vagos,he?. Pero en fin si te agrada escuchar esa clase de insultos hacia tu genero , bueno que mas da , que pena , solo que como veo que eres una chica joven , pense que que podrias tener algo de neuronas, porque lo reitero el Reegaeton es una porqueria que solo entra en mentes huecas y podridas, ah y como no saber tanto de eso ? , si a donde quiera que voy solo hay personas brutas uqe escuchan esa basura. <br>  <br>  Psdt: No insistas mas el reegaeton es una basura, una porqueria, una mier..., bueno no acabaria de explicarte , ademas no entenderias.

La pirateria no esta limitada solo al internet o a la computacion, esta tambie llego a los li bros, ropa y muchos articulos mas, la llegada a internet solo fue un medio mas por el cual se puede distribur la pirateria.

It's a little annoying, but that's part of her heritage, so I'm guessing that it's just habit for her and something she doesn't realize she's doing.<br>  <br>  I have to say that she's had some great ideas.

The Earth's average near-surface atmospheric temperature rose 0.6 ± 0.2 °Celsius (1.1 ± 0.4 °Fahrenheit) in the 20th century [1].<br>  <br>  The current scientific consensus is that "most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been attributable to human activities"[2].<br>  <br>  The main cause of the human-induced component of warming is the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs), especially carbon dioxide (CO2), due to activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, land clearing, and agriculture.[3] Greenhouse gases are gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect. This effect was first described by Joseph Fourier in 1824, and was first investigated quantitatively in 1896 by the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius[4].<br>  <br>  Climate sensitivity is a measure of the equilibrium response to increased GHGs, and other anthropogenic and natural climate forcings. It is found by observational [5] and model studies. This sensitivity is usually expressed in terms of the temperature response expected from a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere, which, according to the 2001 IPCC report, is estimated to be between 1.5 and 4.5 °C (2.7–8.1 °F) (with a statistical likelihood of 66-90%)[6]. This should not be confused with the expected temperature change by a given date, which also includes a dependence on the future GHG emissions and a delayed response due to thermal lag, principally from the oceans. Models referenced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), using a range of SRES scenarios, project that global temperatures will increase between 1.4 and 5.8 °C (2.5 to 10.5 °F) between 1990 and 2100.<br>  <br>  An increase in global temperatures can in turn cause other changes, including a rising sea level and changes in the amount and pattern of precipitation. These changes may increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts, heat waves, hurricanes, and tornados. Other consequences include higher or lower agricultural yields, glacial retreat, reduced summer stream flows, species extinctions and increases in the ranges of disease vectors. Warming is expected to affect the number and magnitude of these events; however, it is difficult to connect particular events to global warming. Although most studies focus on the period up to 2100, warming (and sea level rise due to thermal expansion) is expected to continue past then, since CO2 has an estimated atmospheric lifetime of 50 to 200 years. [7]. Only a small minority of climate scientists disagree that humanity's actions have played a major role in recent warming. However, the uncertainty is more significant regarding how much climate change should be expected in the future, and there is a hotly contested political and public debate over implementation of policies that deal with predicted consequences, what, if anything, should be done to reduce or reverse future warming, and how to deal with the predicted consequences.

a2a3deaea4cb092073af2d2e24c1c175aa	Gotika.  La cadena Fox es lo mas azqueroso que hay.  Son muy republicanos, totalmente parciales, de derecha extrema. Peor que la CNN, y eso ya es bastante decir.  Seguramente se deben odiar mutuamente, pero ambos se necesitan. Fox hace mucho dinero con los Simpson, y como ellos son los due?os del programa, el creador de los simpson no puede irse a otro canal. Además a Fox esta crítica mucho no le afecta. Es como tirarles piedritas a un elefante.<br>  Ademas, tiene su gracia criticar a la misma cadena en que están.  Criticar otras cadenas es agredirlas, pudiendo crear conflictos y juicios, tal vez.  Fox no puede hacerse juicio a si mismo.<br>  Sds<br>  R.|`|38157f96d92bbe49db3a3378571f78c1aa	esa es la gracia!!hablar mal de los zurdos,ellos son zurdos!!! hablan mal de todo!!!|`|b1a61233f557025bc7b472cd4c5ad8f7aa	yo creo que es una manera de autocriticarse|`|da58909289c2efbfeca9b1157ba6b35eaa	hola, espero y estes bien, pues eso de hablar de la msima cadena donde se transmiten es en sentido irónico, y claro es burlarse de ellos mismois, para no ofender a teceros.... cuidate|`|8b71fc4c9c89ea84baa9023604e8aeffaa	Pues es otra más de esas excelentes ideas de su creador Matt Groening y de al final de cuentas seguir con una crítica en general a la sociedad actual y sobre todo a la sociedad americana, además de que puede ser más fácil criticar al vecino desde tu propia casa.<br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|90c604345991cbf33d36ab7a8616c554aa	PORQUE NO PUEDEN  criticar otra cadena so lo asen  en forma de broma pa chingarse en otras cadenas y es mas no pasa nada si es su propia cadena poreso lo asen ;) y es divertido jajajja|`|c7522a44d37e3e68e1e91a1ab0840822aa	es solo una parodia de los escritores hacia la cadena televisiva|`|t5mTBVWDaa	SOLO POR FASTIDIAR AL CANAL PERO NO ES NA MALO NI TAMPOCO LOS VA A SACAR DE LA PROGRAMACION POR ESO POR EJEMPLO EN QUE YO VI HOY FLANDER DIJO : OH DIOS ES VERDAD VEAN FOX Y SERAN CONDENADO Y CUANDO DIJO KRUSTY A LOS EJECUTIVOS DE FOX QUE ESTAVAN ACOSTUMBRADOS A PONER PROGRAMAS BASURA.

Se graduó en la Pulaski Academy en el a?o 2000. También estuvo un tiempo en la Middle Tennessee State University.<br>  <br>  En 1998 al hasta ese entonces duo, se integra David Hodges en los teclados y en el 2000 graban lo que para muchos es su primer CD llamado Origin, pero ella no lo considera así porque se editaron muy pocas copias, luego de esto David Hodges se retira e ingresan John LeComp y Rocky Gray.<br>  <br>  En 2003 se lanza el para ella primer CD Fallen, donde el primer single fue "Bring me to Life", que es un duo con Paul McCoy, vocalista de la banda 12 Stones, este duo fue una exigencia de la casa discográfica. Esta canción es el soundtrack de la película "Daredevil", al igual que "My Immortal", la balada más reconocida de Evanescence.<br>  <br>  Desde mayo de 2003, entabló una relación sentimental con Shaun Morgan del grupo Seether, colaborando con él en la canción "Broken" que es parte de la banda sonora de la película "The Punisher". Esta relación, sin embargo, terminó en septiembre de 2005, en muy malos términos.<br>  <br>  En diciembre del 2005 Amy fue demandada por su representante Dennis Rider, quien la acusó de incumplimiento de contrato. Amy contrademandó acusando al representante de acoso sexual y negligencia profesional, asegurando, entre otras cosas, que Rider tuvo acercamiento sexuales indeseados e impropios hacia ella y que había utilizado recursos laborales en asuntos personales.<br>  <br>  Su segundo álbum a nivel internacional,llamado Anywhere But Home, creado en el a?o 2004 contiene temas como Thoughtless(un cover de Korn), Farther Away, Breathe No More y Missing|`|7ab2550c00f0989d8864bc9e774794a9aa	No sabia q. ella tenia una hermana .  no lo puedo creer .

Un buen grupo tiene una trayectoria, que se a forjado por su talento y otras cosas, que ha trabajado y se ha esforzado por poder llegar a la gente y ganarse un lugar. Estos grupitos que producen sinteticamente (en especial Televisa y TV azteca) son simplemente marionetas, que pintan y que visten y les hacen proyectar cierta actitud que no tienen. No escriben sus canciones, no tocan instrumentos, usan pista cuando tienen que cantar en vivo y todavia tienen el cinismo de decir que toman en serio la musica, eso es enfermizo. Esto es simplemente comercio musical, y en mi opinion esta clase de grupos Si son parte del Show business, pero de ninguna manera los llamaria musicos. Si no lo creen esperense un tiempo mas y cuando exploten totalmente a estos chamacos van a salir otros nuevos y el ciclo maldito de la musica basura se repetira.

AA10697471	Jordan Nathaniel Marcel Knight (b. May 17, 1970, Worcester, Massachusetts) is best known as the lead singer & "heartthrob" of the boy band, New Kids On The Block (NKOTB). He is best known for his distinctive falsetto style of singing influenced by The Stylistics.<br>  <br>  <br>  Early career<br>  <br>  Jordan Knight was a member of New Kids On The Block along with his brother, Jonathan as well as Joey McIntyre, Donnie Wahlberg and Danny Wood. Assembled in Boston in 1984 by producer Maurice Starr.<br>  <br>  The group went on to sell over 70 million albums worldwide, generated hundreds of million of dollars of concert revenues, and roughly paved the way for acts like Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC. New Kids On The Block disbanded in 1994.<br>  <br>  1999 Comeback<br>  <br>  Jordan Knight made a comeback on 1999 by releasing his first solo single "Give It To You". The single reached #10 on Billboard Hot 100, it sold over 1 Million copies, and was nominated for a 1999 MTV Video Music Award for Best Dance Video. However, he didn't win. The album Jordan Knight won an Aspire Music Award for Best Male Album (Pop). He became a father on August 25, 1999 to a son, Dante Jordan. Jordan's debut album was then certified gold for sales of over 500,000 copies in the US.<br>  <br>  The Remix Album<br>  <br>  Jordan released a remix album Jordan Knight Performs New Kids on the Block in 2004 and he was on the television show "The Surreal Life" with other B-list celebrities in 2004.<br>  <br>  In 2005, Knight appeared on the British show "Hit Me Baby One More Time", where he performed "Give It To You", as well as a cover of "Let Me Love You" by Mario.<br>  <br>  In September 2005, he also starred in a British documentary on five in the UK called Trust Me - I’m A Holiday Rep. Six celebrities spent 10 days in the role of an Olympic Holidays holiday rep in Ayia Napa, Cyprus. He initially lacked enthusiasm for the role, which he blamed to some extent on his shyness, but came to enjoy it. In his final debriefing he earned praise from the head reps, who said they would (hypothetically) offer him a job as a children's and transfer rep. Throughout the show he remained intrigued by guests' topless sunbathing, which is not common in the USA.<br>  <br>  The Fix<br>  <br>  In 2005 Jordan released a new EP entitled The Fix with the lead single "Where is Your Heart Tonight" which reached its peak at #12 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary Chart. He continues to tour extensively in 2005/2006 promoting his EP The Fix.<br>  <br>  Love Songs<br>  <br>  September 2006, Jordan's long awaited new album "Love Songs" was released by Trans Continental Records. The first single was Say Goodbye featuring Deborah Gibson, which peaked at #24 on Billboard Adult Contemporary Chart.<br>  <br>  Trivia<br>  <br>      * He released his eponymous solo album in 1999, which was certified Gold by the RIAA in 2000.<br>      * Favorite artists are Prince, Teddy Riley, Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson.<br>      * He is left handed and used to have the annoying habit of biting his nails but had to stop when he started wearing braces.<br>      * He wore a long, braided rattail for years and chopped it off for his 21st birthday and gave it to his mother.<br>      * He collected hotel room keys.<br>      * He's scared of supernatural things.<br>      * His most prized possessions are his keyboards.<br>      * He adds ketchup on everything and enjoys Chinese food.<br>      * It makes him uneasy when people stare at him.<br>      * He loves to perform in front of admiring fans.<br>      * Brother of fellow New Kid Jonathan Knight.<br>      * Chosen by People magazine as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in the world (1990)<br>      * Wore a black rubber bracelet for good luck since he was a teenager and still wore when the NKOTB disappeared in 1991-92. It was not known when the bracelet was removed or whether it broke or he got tired of it. The rubber ring was originally used inside toilets and later on in the 1980s they became fashion for boys and girls.<br>      * Jordan's 1999 hit "Give It to You" was produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.<br>      * Jordan became a father on August 25, 1999 when his son Dante Jordan was born<br>      * Jordan And wife Evelyn are expecting their second child:-)|`|66f44248f1323a4c60e69e24c71ff3f6aa	I didn't realize he actually had a hit.

5f5c67702547759a870a4714ff59613daa	Es una leyenda viviente, un verdadero mito, una mujer de gran inteligencia y caracter fuertísimo que supo cumplir con todos los objetivos que se propuso, a nivel profesional y personal. La admiro enormemente, y creo que si se la critica hay que hacerlo con buenos argumentos, no como los estúpidos que escriben más arriba.<br>  Madonna es la mujer más triunfadora del mundo de la música, una de las mujeres empresarias más poderosas de todos los tiempos y uno de las artistas más exitosas de la historia de la música, y se mantiene en plena vigencia después de 23 a?os de carrera. Muy poca gente ha logrado eso. Las críticas hacia ella encierran una gran envidia de parte de gente fracasada que se siente poca cosa.<br>  Yo no la envidio: la admiro, es el mayor ídolo que tuve en toda mi vida. Todo lo que tiene se lo ganó con trabajo, profesionalismo, disciplina, y no le robó nada a nadie, y nadie le regaló nada. Es una ganadora absoluta: tiene fama, dinero a raudales, un cuerpazo escultural, un estado físico increíble, talento, éxito profesional, una familia, un esposo que la ama, dos hijos hermosos ...... y todo se lo ganó ella.

931cf24831a105755747ad37fa04b9d4aa	Allah is an arabic word which means god it is who the Muslims refer to as God. Christians refer to there god as God also Jehova or Yawah generaly refered to as God.The God of Muslims and the god of Christians are entirely different gods. <br>  <br>  <br>   As you already know why Muslims use the word Allah instead of other attributes most of the time but I will post it once again because I know some ignorant people will come here and say things like "fake god" and "moon god"<br>  <br>  Allah is used by Muslims is because there is no other word in the world can justify the true meanings of God Almighty.<br>  <br>  Word Allah is also used in ALL Arabic trasnlations of Bible for God.<br>  <br>  There is another word for fake god in Arabic and it's "ilah".<br>  <br>  All semetic languages have very similar word for God for example, Elohim (im is added for respect) in Hebrew. Also notice in Bible when Jesus was on the cross he used a very similar word "Eli".<br>  <br>  Allah is also used because of it's uniqueness, if there are five people who have never met each other and they all are from different faith, if they all use the word "God", the other person will think he/she is talking about the very same God, other person believes.<br>  <br>  Word Allah can not be played around and doesn't shows any gender or gives you any images what God looks like. For example, add "ess" with God and it becomes a "godess", as an "s" and it "gods", add "father and it becomes "godfahter".<br>  Also for a Hindu, when he says "God" he pictures a statue of a human with a head of elephent and has 8 hands, for many Christians, word "God" brings a picture of a middle eastern man with long beard and hair and is nailed on a cross.<br>  <br>  Hope this will help many understand the true meaning of the word Allah. <br>  <br>   <br>  --------------------------------------...|`|617901be11e15acce8d391039b4060c8aa	Allah is the god of Muslims.|`|84562fc1604052138cc52d7a6c43589faa	he is the arabic god the one that they believe in instead of god.he is the one that osama thinks is teh real god not our god.

AA11553932	Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I, for one, am a long time fan of Tool. They just recently finished their six week tour of Europe. In the latter half of January they are scheduled to play New Zealand and Australia (a couple of Tool shows but most dates as part of the Big Day Out festival) for a couple of weeks before going to Japan for a handful of shows, wrapping up on February 14th, 2007. After that I'm not sure if anything is certain regarding new albums and tours, but I hope they continue to provide us fans of theirs with more of what we have enjoyed for the past 15 or so years. And yes, "10,000 Days" was released this past May, and judging by the time between albums for the latest two releases (or overall for that matter), we may not get some new material for another 2.5-3.5 years. Lets hope that isn't the case. It is bad for a waiting period, but good for the fact they have never been a group to get as much out as fast as they can just because of popularity and sales, but actually put time into their releases. Too bad more people in the industry do not do the same.|`|4c715d961ca42475a1a31721d5e66612aa	Tool is an incredible band.

caf93371a3c25960d0c7c40ce71bd84eaa	If they are oiled and still sticking, chances are that you may have small dents in the valve casing.  The best thing you can do to make sure the valves are working as well as possible is to take them out of the valve casing.  Run them under warm water (don't soak them, the felt pads will eventually rot away) and run a snake through the holes in each valve (a snake is like a roto-rooter for brass instruments.  Most music stores carry them and they are cheap).  After you've snaked the valves, wash them off with warm water and let them dry.  <br>       While the valves are drying, run a soft cloth through the inside of the valve casing to make sure there is no gunk building up in the casing itself.  Oil the valves with a good synthetic oil (again, any music store will have some kind of synthetic oil) and replace.  If they are still sticking after all this, then you should probably have the instrument looked at by a repair tech.<br>       Side Note:  I would not use vasoline to oil your valves.  True most commercial valve oils are petroleum based, but vasoline is much thicker and the valves will not perform the way you need them to.  Synthetic oils are great because they will not evaporate and that means no mineral deposits left behind on the valves.  Definitely go synthetic.  I recommend using Hetman Classic Piston Oil.|`|66f44248f1323a4c60e69e24c71ff3f6aa	This used to happen to me.  I would take the valves out, wash them with warm soapy water and then put a thin layer of vaseline on there.  replace the valve and keep working with it until it doesn't stick anymore.|`|f2e791d8c9d64a1c5765f7de1992d168aa	Oil breaks down and becomes sticky over time - especially with moisture and humidity and that is probably what is happening with your valves.  Clean all the oil from your valves and valve body as best as you can.  You may need to use a detergent or something that breaks down oil. Fully dry them and re-apply the valve oil and you should be back in business.

Ma una palla da baseball, lanciata da qualcuno, all'improvviso rompe il suo specchio preferito... Stilly è arrabbiata, ma il colpevole, chiunque sia, sembra svanito nel nulla. La bambina è molto dispiaciuta, ma ecco che un uomo in smoking le compare davanti: l'uomo le dice di venire dal "paese degli specchi" e, per riparare alla perdita dello specchio rotto, regala alla bambina uno specchio nuovo... uno specchio magico. Se pronuncerà le parole magiche "Tekamaia maiacon", Stilly potrà trasformarsi in chi vorrà! Sparito l'uomo misterioso, la bambina ovviamente verifica le capacità magiche dello specchio e si trasforma subito in una bella ragazza! Incredula, con queste sembianze corre  incontro alla madre, che ovviamente non la riconosce: Stilly si affretta a ritornare se stessa e a fare subito le sue scuse alla mamma per aver messo in disordine tutta la casa... questo è solo l'inizio delle sue avventure. Attenzione: la sinossi appena data non rende *assolutamente* l'idea di cosa sia questo manga, che -se ne tenga conto- non è basato sulla magia, bensì sull'umorismo!

mfgskWNIaa	Hago las tres cosas. Lo que más trabajo me costó siempre es aprender a leer y escribir música, es realmente complicado y me llevó muchos a?os de audio perceptiva y tomar clases de lecto-escritura musical. Aquí el tema es que lees o no lees, no hay termino medio.<br>  En cambio podes tocar un instrumento en forma intuitiva y aprender rápidamente. Grandes músicos, sobre todo de jazz, no sabían leer música. Y algo parecido pasa con el canto, se puede ser naturalmente afinado y con muy poco esfuerzo cantar, o imitar a un cantante.<br>  Definitivamente en mi opinión lo más sencillo es cantar, luego tocar un instrumento y finalmente lo más difícil es leer música.|`|7ab2550c00f0989d8864bc9e774794a9aa	Para leer musica  ahi q estudiar, para tocarla, amenos q improvises bien , tambien ahi q estudiar ,  pero cantar cualquiera puede.|`|aq65r0afaa	Holasz!!!!!!!!<br>               Psz io dig0 q esz0 depende de cada kien, ia que algunasz pers0nasz szaben cantar muy bien y 0trasz t0car algun instrument0.<br>                Byebye =)|`|kLUrIWFFaa	Cantar|`|tMVcL38haa	tocar musica, para leer musica necesitas estudiar, para cantar necesitas una buena voz( aunqe podes cantar aunque tengas mala voz), podes tocar musica sin tener conocimientos|`|4d0f6c2e61bff64cb525493ccb14e1f8aa	Leer siento yo... por que te lo vas aprendiendo... con la diferencia de tocar o cantar.,.. son talentos natos siento yo...|`|fa942f15ad1b51723b913e88b4060c4daa	para tocar musica hay que leerla y para cantar hay que escuchar la musica|`|09ae09a3c34728b9a7b31098a892b0caaa	NINGUNA, TODO TIENE SU CHISTE, LO QUE SERá MáS FáCIL ES LA VOCACIóN O FACILIDAD QUE TENGAS PARA UNAS U OTRAS, ASí QUE ANALIZA TU TALENTO Y ESO HAZ.<br>  <br>  SALUDOS|`|2c9e7abe6833effac55d10b8af5e9106aa	yo creo que leer es más sencillo, aunque las tres se aprenden, el ejecutar un instrumento hasta sacarle la ultima gota de provecho necesita de muco tiempo y práctica y cantar pues depende de como eduques tu voz por mas fea que sea, al igual que el instrumento es muy dificil...|`|2f39061103a99946e78cd06c29de7885aa	yo creo que todo lo que dices tiene que tener dedicacion yo aprendi a tocar guitarra y piano leyendo partituras y estoy en el coro de la universidad y e afinado mucho pero de todas formas cada cosa es dependiendo de lo que te efuerzes ya que deje un poco la musica por mis estudios universitarios ....... :-) saludos|`|b9c6e5b754d5278ef6bdb24255f790a0aa	Toco el violin.

b02c0e9ddd863b39472e5875b5fee48caa	La música electrónica, por le enorme variedad que hay en subgéneros y manifestaciones, desde la mejor música de baile, como el trance de Paul van Dyk o DJ Tiesto, a maravillas indefinibles como Masive Attack o artistas que sin salir del "macro"género han creado sonidos de lo más diversos, como el genial Jean Michel Jarre, o artistas de la fusión, como Deep Forest con las voces étnicas o Rob Dougan con la música clásica, sin olvidarnos de manifestaciones cuasi pop, como Air, o buen Techno, como Daft Punk o B-12.

Tickets went on sale in 10 minutes they were sold out. They had a concert in LA  at the Coliseum that was sold out. They have sold more CD's than any other artist out there.   Tha's my opinion!!!

ee7b4508c5f4d59cc119fd0c3e945b93aa	Wow -- what happened to HER?!!  I thought she was rather cute/pretty last year, but the other night.............??  First, I think she already had a decent bust line, so she could have just been wearing a push-up bra.  But, her hairdresser must really have it in for her !!!! Was quite unflattering and made her look about 55.  I think Kelli seemed a little plumper all-around and didn't sing all that well either.  And, lastly, did you notice how Randy, Paula, and Simon barely acknowledged her?|`|0314d89449b4ad36adcad56dadc6fbeeaa	YES I NOTICED THAT TOO!<br>  @|`|0065b0baa5e0f045f82e538a80f371dbaa	yupp! totally agree|`|AA11758121	Yes; I noticed the change in her appearance, not for the better either.|`|f2bcf2a9827601be23d7b70f58184edaaa	Yeah, I think she got more than new shoes!!!!!  I thought she looked so strange....like a dolly parton wanna be or something..and I do think she has put on a few....but, I thought she sounded great.<br>  I went to see the idols on tour at the 3rd to last one they did and she looked like she had some extra junk in her trunk, but now looks like she is much boobier and alittle heavier, but she is still pickler....still cute....and I think it was a really bad choice of dress, but again...loved the song and her delivery!!!|`|f87bdf8404e183dca258babc57373c4caa	I thought the same about the Dolly Parton resemblance.  She looked really old and the boob job was gross (made her look unbalanced).  I was embarrassed for her because she never looked like a sex symbol and now she looks awkward.

Try them out...|`|da6c9efbd4e8009c0e5c49eb5607fe6faa	Make sure that your paper is in very small peices for the best result. You can buy glues that have anifungals and hardeners in them- or you can make the natural type (I have found that the home made ones just never seem to be quite as good). I suggest you buy the glues from a craft shop. You can use chicken wire or clay to make a base for your papier mache to create the shape.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! and do visit those papier mache sites....|`|qv09yrcqaa	hello. not sure how complicated you want to go, but basic steps are:<br>  <br>  chicken wire, oval shaped the size of your face, or<br>  balloon<br>  torn pieces of newspaper or tissue paper, about 1 - 2" square<br>  glue, made from flour water and a little salt (mix to a consistency of thick soup) or you can use commercial wallpaper paste<br>  <br>  mould the chicken wire into your mask shape - ie point a bit for your nose in the middle, round out the shape so it curves like your face, cut two holes for eyes, curve round a chin and your forehead.<br>  <br>  alternatively, use the balloon as the face template and build up the nose (read on!) etc.<br>  <br>  to make the papier mache, dip the squares of newspaper or tissue paper into the soupy glue - get them nice and wet, and lay them across your wire or balloon in a single layer. let dry completely, then add another layer. keep going until the mask is a good thickness. Burst the balloon once the mask is completely dry and then you can paint and varnish to your heart's content! <br>  <br>  to make the nose raised, simply add more wet paper at that point and raise it up, molding and shaping as you go. make sure you wrap the edges with the wet paper if you are using the wire frame.<br>  <br>  good luck!

The first time I did I got a really bad burn on my boobs, but a little forethought and SPF 30 to start the season now does wonders to avoid that problem.  <br>  <br>  The first few times I go every season i start off with 30 minutes of nothing but the sun, then apply SPF 30 for the rest of the day.  After that it's an hour without any sunscreen followed by SPF 15.  <br>  <br>  After a few weeks my tan is dark enough to go with only a single covering of SPF 4 or 8...then, nothing at all.<br>  <br>  Hope this is helpful to this year's crop of would-be nudies.

Um cora??o t?o lindo e cheio de amor, pode até ter mágoa junto do amor mas, tenho certeza que o percentual de amor é bem maior e pode derrotar qualquer tamanho de mágoa. Você foi feita para amar, supere as mágoas e deixe a vida te levar. Voe junto com as brisas do vento, se ele se transformar em tempestade voe o mais alto que puder pois, a tempestade é passageira e, quando tudo se acalma você poderá perceber que tudo n?o passou de um pequeno susto. A paz é um pretexto que cobi?amos eternamente, deixar você em paz é correr o risco de esquecê-la para sempre e isto eu n?o farei.

Meu grande Poeta! Hoje vou aproveitar o seu romantismo para um alerta real, é fundamental que prime o princípio de que a água é um bem comum de todos, indiscriminadamente, caso contrário, a letra de Chico Buarque será muito mais do que a trilha sonora de sua pe?a, ela será o nosso epitáfio. Por isso, no Dia Mundial da água, lembramos as premonitórias palavras do grande Chico:<br>  <br>  “Deixe em paz meu cora??o<br>  Que ele é um pote até aqui de mágoa <br>  E qualquer desaten??o, fa?a n?o<br>  Pode ser a gota d’água”...

9be6374e78d68c69f3c0e6a68f547775aa	On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd definitely give it a 10! It's one of my favorite movies of all time!<br>  <br>  I used to say GLADIATOR was my favorite film but I just saw 300 last weekend and I was totally blown away! What an awesome movie! I was fascinated every minute! The script, the costumes and sets, the music, everything was just PERFECT!!!<br>  <br>  I was most impressed by the action scenes, they were choreographed very nicely and looked pretty realistic. (OK, OK, the arterial spurt was wrong, there wasn't enough gushing blood and no sword, no matter how sharp, stays sharp long enough for you to hack that many people to death but let's overlook little details like that, OK?)<br>  <br>  I own swords and I know it's not easy to swing those babies for long, you really have to be in good shape and these guys really looked it! Like real warriors not the weekend warrior type. I mean, you could believe that they'd been training as warriors since they were kids.Those guys are HOT!<br>  <br>  OK, there was some gratuitous nudity (young "oracle" in flimsy gown, the Queen of Sparta flashing flesh, the king and queen in the bedchamber) to keep the young, testosterone laden men interested until the carnage but I guess that's only fair as we women were treated to the sight of all these buff guys in skimpy war outfits.<br>  <br>  The bad guys were suitably bad, LOL! It cracks me up to see the people posting here at YA that are saying it's an anti-Iranian film or whatever. It's fiction for Pete's sake and it's a good story!! Ah, it was just a spectacular feast for the eyes in many respects and was very inspiring. No doubt I'll go see it again while it's still in the theaters and immediately snap up a copy when it comes out on DVD!<br>  <br>  No question, 300 is the best movie of 2007 so far. I've seen several: WILD HOGS, 23, GHOST RIDER, CATCH & RELEASE, MUSIC & LYRICS.... um, some horror flick whose name I can't even remember now... in fact, several movies that I can't name now because they were so mundane but 300 is awesome! Both my boyfriend and I loved it! <br>  <br>  I am recommending this film to everyone!!!!!|`|423bf3f45a232d9163c040d153f7ad49aa	1 because it sucked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA10757238	9.. never thought it would be my type of movie but it was amazing.
NSGdnxQZaa	Simples....n?o é para entender!<br>  <br>  N?o estou desmerecendo a série, eu sou um grande f? de lost, no entanto cheguei a simples conclus?o que ele n?o foi feito para se compreender, os diretores simplesmente "jogam" problemas e mistérios aleatoriamente, sem se preocupar em como v?o resolve-los posteriormente.<br>  <br>  Essa é uma das principais causas da sua perda de audiência na 3a temporada nos EUA e uma das principais falhas da séria, uma pena!<br>  <br>  A hipótese mais plausível era a de que todos eles tivessem morrido na queda do avi?o. Neste ponto a hipótese se divide em duas:<br>  <br>  1- Algo os prende a terra, alguma miss?o ou algo que eles ainda precisam fazer antes de poderem se livrar desse plano. <br>  <br>  2- Eles n?o est?o mais na terra, mais sim em outro plano.<br>  <br>  No entanto, os criadores já descartaram a possibilidade deles estarem mortos.|`|QYn5r4Onaa	LOST n?o se entende, se assisste e fica corioso, é isso que causa o grande sucesso na tv....|`|c93315376f503cf3e49ebb9b66d3fe24aa	N?o há como falar de LOST sem que se entenda o que acontece para que tanta curiosidade seja despertada nas pessoas que assistem ao programa. <br>  <br>  A trama come?a em um misterioso acidente de avi?o, no qual 48 pessoas caem em uma ilha desconhecida. Essa é a chave para o suspense, já que durante vários episódios, os personagens v?o descobrindo aos poucos o que aconteceu com eles. Mas o mistério nunca acaba, já que sempre que um deles é desvendado, surge outro maior e mais fenomenal do que o primeiro. Depois de semanas presos na ilha, muitas descobertas s?o feitas, e devido à alta curiosidade que a trama desperta, diversas teorias s?o formuladas tentando explicar o que acontece nesse lugar. Ursos polares em zona tropical, máquinas desconhecidas dentro de uma ilha deserta, escotilhas com diversos mantimentos escondidas em baixo da terra, muitos s?o os fatores geniais que aparecem no desenvolver dos capítulos. <br>  <br>  A previs?o inicial é que existam em torno de 7 a 9 temporadas do seriado, assim perpetuando o desconhecimento do público por um bom tempo.|`|saNGWNctaa	eu ate achava legal, mas agora acho só besteira fazem isso pelo ibope um suspense agente acha uma coisa depois outra e pior que é coisas sem nexos|`|ce25338b55b1f9f4255eec8a00c96e73aa	eu n?o entendo mas queria muito estar com eles num paraiso como aqueles, pq eu quereria voltar pra casa e ter de aguentar meus irm?o bagunceiros?|`|daa2f7875fd642ec04e7a7f09530bbe9aa	é normal a série perder audiência, Arquivo X n?o era esse fen?meno que é Lost e tem muitos f?s mesmo depois do fim da série. As pessoas que deixam de assistir perderam a gra?a por que a série é uma das poucas a n?o explorar polêmicas "porque o povo gosta". Ela tem um objetivo, desde o come?o os produtores e criadores sabem o final; a gra?a está em assistir os episódios e ver o quebra-cabe?as ser montado, a cada inser??o de novos personagens, morte de personagens importantes, reviravoltas no enredo. Parece até jogo de tabuleiro, tipo Damas, Xadrez ou Mah-jongg...claro que acontecem trope?os no meio da série, personagens preciosos têm que sair (Michael, Walt , Bernard e Rose), mas outros chegam pra preencher o terreno, talvez até de forma mais direta e importante pra trama. Caso de Penelope, Ben, o homem do tapa olho, a filha da Rousseau...|`|0wk8Tgxvaa	Sinceramente os 3 primeiros episódios da primeira temporada, foram bons. Mas aí come?a as perguntas, e coisas estranhas acontecem, personagens que n?o podiam morrer morreram. Parece que o próprio J.J. Abrans está perdido. Ele misturou o mistério de arquivo X com a ilha dos birutas, mas sem a comédia. Acho que é um caso perdido. Muito coisa aí n?o faz mais sentido.  Ele tentou fazer um mistério misterioso e  acabou fazendo confus?o.|`|1df28389007f11d53cfceeeaab5082a6aa	Assistindo!!!!|`|5f413a06bdb884773821fce7761c1441aa	VC TEM QUE ESTA DE OLHO EM TUDO QUE ACONTECE...|`|wCdE2EGGaa	Nossa kra.. eu n?o entendo NADAAAAA...<br>  <br>  ent?o, por favor, se alguém responder esta pergunta de forma lógica, vc me passa??<br>  obrigada!!!<br>  <br>  bjs<br>  <br>  =]

What I liked best about Sanjaya's performance tonight was right before he sang they showed the clip where he said his goal tonight is to show America that he can really sing.  What that tells me is he knows he sucks.  He's got to realize that everyone is making fun of him why doesn't he just quit?  Sadly tonight was his best performance.  I know that's not saying much but it wasn't as horrible as usual.  Therefor I fear we will have to endure him yet another week.
