Today my boss told me that the bible says you will go to hell if you are not christian. I don't know the bible well, and i was wondering if this was true? Is there an exact line that quotes "all non Christians will go to hell" My dad says hes probably quoting john verse 3:16 -3:18. But this doesn't say you have to be christian, it only says you have to love jesus. So i was curious-is their anything in the bible that says you must be christian to go to heaven?         This is a repost-but the last time i asked i got a ton of really good answers. just looking for some more opinions!

20090220221319AAlxvrb	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Jehovah's Witnesses, Obey  The Organization Or Be Stoned Or Mauled To Death?	Is it stepping out of line to expect people to honor an organization as they would their God?  I am wondering why Jehovah's Witnesses do this?  Any idea why they demand godly devotion from their members?      Source:      “In case a man should happen to have a son who is stubborn and rebellious, he not listening to the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and they have corrected him but he will not listen to them, then .?.?. all the men of his city must stone him with stones and he must die.” (Deut. 21:18-21, NW)       Such honor and obedience was required not only as due the mmediate parents in the flesh but also as rightfully belonging to the older men of influence in Israel. Failure to render such proper respect to Elisha, the prophet of Jehovah, brought upon a gang of juvenile delinquents the just sentence of speedy execution. (2?Ki. 2:24) Today, also, God    requires and exacts from his children obedience, honor and respect. These must be rendered not only to the living God himself, but to his wifely organization as well. (WT 5/1/56 pg. 274 para. 4).      How can they demand this for themselves?

20090220164203AA1Rtck	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How to deal with rude McD's employees? What should i do about their attitude towards me? I'm autistic,too.?	Ok, here's the thing:  I am known to go to Wal-Mart alot. On average, about 2-3 times a week,some weeks.    Sometimes,i do not go at all,for a couple of weeks,as i have no need to go.   When i do go, i use the city transit system, as i don't drive,and the bus does not go to my destination,for about 4 hours, during the hours of 10 am and 3 pm, leaving me stranded either downtown,or at Wal-mart, til the bus will take me home from downtown.    I don't mind it,as i rather enjoy looking at tabloids,reading them,with my meal,and enjoying the free refills and ice. I chew ice chips,and yes,I know it is bad.   I always buy a meal,and it is usually the same one: A Big Mac meal, no onion, with three cookies: two oatmeal,and one choc. chip.   Sometimes,they will screw up my order, on purpose.     Or they make my burger really sloppily.   Ok, I have noticed, that over the last 6 or so months,the crew will not speak to me, unless they absolutley have to,and will NOT touch me to give me back my change.   They also do not make eye contact with me either.   At first, i thought it was just they way they were.    Then a friend, told me it was because they thought I was crazy.   That hurt, because this friend, who is also an employee, will not talk to me if any of the other crew is present.   It gets worse: if they are in Wal-Mart, in or out of their McD's uniform, they will not speak to me,smile or talk to me, even if I speak,smile or talk to them,first,either.   Then, it was'nt just the McDonald's employees,it was also the Wally world's employees,too.   They will not talk to me, unless they are the cashier,and usually hurry to get me out of their line.   Once, a person even closed her lane,making me go to another lane,and when I was leaving, she removed her "closed" sign.   That hurt.   I went to the manager,and he told me that several employees think i am crazy and are uncomfortable with me,and i have been seen "talking to myself,"   I don't talk to myself,i do,however, will whisper to myself if I am reading from a list or am looking at something,like a garment,to see if I can pair it up with what I have at home.   i am really into color coordination of my wardrobe.   i also knit and crochet and wear my creations. I get alot of positive comments on them.   I have gone out of my way to be friendly to these employees,and no amount of politeness,which I am NOT known for, works.   Also, I am Wiccan,and most of these people are "christian," and I have been told that I have caused a few employees to quit either Mcdonalds or wal-mart, because they are " uncomfortable dealing with a person from another,alternative religion".       What do I do?    I am not a people person,and frankly,go to wal-mart because I like the prices,it has all 3 things I can get at one place: a place to sit and eat at,grocery and shopping.   Plus, it is on the bus route,and since our car is broke down, i can go by myself and have some "me" time.      So, what do I do?   I am not crazy.   I am autistic,and these people don't know that,as I am not comfortable telling people I don't know that I am, for fear that they will think I AM crazy, or avoid me altogether,or think I am stupid or mentally challenged.   I mean, here, it is different: I don't know any of you personally,it is all online,so i feel ok about telling people.   But this is different.       What to do???   Do I stand up to these a$$holes and tell them that I think they are  being very rude and not at all treating people the way they should,or should I keep my mouth shut?      oh,and they aren't all teens: one manager is a woman that is in her 50's and another employee is in her 60's and some are young adults,married with families, and such.      What to do?       I have noticed,too,that some, if not all of these people will not look at me if I pass by in wal-mart.   To me, this is not a very "christian" thing to do.   So,yes,I am miffed that I am being treated this way,by people who are supposed to "love one another" and "do unto others as you would you have done unto you."       What to do?

20090220105649AAOM1xi	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do catholics excuse the crimes of their church?	The bloodstained history of the church under the excuse of humans being imperfect.      For the clergy to burn people alive on a stake for daring to own a Bible or to disagree with some of the dubious ways of church is not being imperfect. It is just down right evil.      I know other churches have done other things but the claim of Catholics is they are the true Church. Yet Jesus said by their fruits you will tell who they are. And that narrow is the gate to salvation few are the ones finding it.      With such blood guilty pasts how on earth can anyone justly think that Christ will want to be part of such a church? Even today politcal meddling is rife and who knows what goes on behind the closed doors of the Vatican.

20090220164332AAg94Ww	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Could she possibly know?	I really think my teacher knows more about me than I know of myself. She'll make sure that she does not look directly at me and when we are face to face and talking, she will. One time we had a one on one conversation and briefly she stared into my eyes and smiled as if she knew me and saw my soul, I was astounded.  Also, since I went last for presenting to the class she makes sure that she'll give my quiz last...       I don't know if it's just that she is concerned but she likes calling my name and only my name to make sure I have everything together, unlike other students.      I look down sometimes and cannot continue to look at her when she lectures, she is just beautiful and I cannot help but like her... I wish I did not have these feelings. I think she also knows this as she is possibly expert at reading body language, she has phd in speech communication and that includes non-verbal communication.      She is a free-lance journalist and has traveled and has made editorials in newspapers, she is also my professor. I read about her online and now I am even more nervous since knowing this...      She was raised to be strong in her country, she had to protect her siblings and carry a weapon at the age of 11. To me she seems more strong, I guess I like that quality...      Could she somehow know I find her attractive and that I also like girls?

So I like this guy and we were writing on each others facebooks the other day. Then a day later on valentines day he sent me a message and gave me his number. It was weird cuz the message was a response to something I had written to him like a month b4 saying if he needed any tutoring he should just let me know. (I used to tutor him hah but we just flirted the whole time) So he had to have been digging through his inbox, just to reply to it. So I kinda felt like he liked me back sorta. Anyway I replied saying that couldnt be his phone number cuz he gave 8 digits. So he responded with the correct 7.. After that I didnt respond. I was going to but I didnt have anything to say.. so yeah..       More info: We're always in the library talking and flirting during lunch, cuz we'd rather starve than sit with our fake friends. But anyways one day, I sat down in the library, and the seat he would usually sit in was taken so he walked in the library and sat somewhere else. then i look back at him and he winked at me. Also last year he liked me, his friend told me.      anyway, It's been 5 days now, and I noticed that he deleted everything I said to him off his wall. Why would he do that? He only deleted the comments I wrote, and nobody elses. I'm confused. Anybody have an explanation? Was it cuz I didn't reply and he got mad?    He doesnt have a girlfriend. In fact he hates his ex cuz like 3 months ago she cheated on him with his best friend. anyways. I noticed that not only did he delete my comments but he deleted his ex-girlfriend in the same day..   I don't wanna ask him why he did that.. cuz then it'd make me look like a stalker..   I'm confused. Why would he do that?

20090220181234AAHkRZY	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If we lived on a spaceship, cruising through space, would we have a religion free socialist system on board?	I mean, a big spaceship; the size of a city that can indefinitely support life for 10 million people. The idea being that, even if the spaceship travels at the speed of light, it would still take many generations before the spaceship reaches the nearest life supporting solar system. You might think, “So that means millions and millions of lives will be wasted just traveling on this spaceship and only one generation will be alive some time in the future when we reach the destination that we only hope can support life,” but it’s hardly different to what the majority of us are doing now. I mean, we’re all just sitting on this planet wasting our lives; the only thing of benefit we can do is procreate to keep the species alive.      I don’t think we could have religion on board the spaceship because religion has the potential to be so divisive and destructive and if we have a capitalist system on board, then that means social class system that inevitably results from capitalism has the potential to cause unrest. Do you think it would be like a dictatorial police state where the Captain has ultimate authority? And people would be assigned places within the ship. You know, there’d be a maintenance crew, a navigation crew, a food producing crew…what do you think?

We have exchanged email and phone contact info. She was inviting me over to her place a few times each week. She would make me coffee. We would chill, talk, and watch movies. Oneday, she told me that she was divorced. The same night, she seemed to be quite emotionally attracted to me. We kissed on the lips, cuddled, and held hands in bed. During the night, she said “I’ve been looking for a boyfriend that can care for me.” The following week we were hanging out a few times. However, the following month I was quite busy with completing final essays. She gave me a text on Jan/25th saying “You like my baby boy” along with a picture of her and a her baby boy. It’s a child from her previous marriage. Anyways, I still respect her as a friend and still feel the need to talk with her. I still am willing to chill with her but only on a friendly level….

I'm extremely grateful for these "small miracles" because I either would have not accepted my sexual orientation and been extremely depressed, or I might have even hurt myself if I hadn't discovered them.

(chatting online right now) sex before marriage is most likely against this guy's religion. but why do sme people make it seem like a crime when a woman gets pregnant without being married?

Sometimes when I look ahead, I can't really see where my life is going. Most heterosexuals (In my family at least) seem to have some sort of a "template" as to what their life would be like, you know the usual you finish your education, get a job, get married, have kids and live happily ever after. (I know gross generalization, but still with so many heterosexual success stories, it just seem like it works out at the end).      But I feel like being gay, I feel like I don't really have that. There isn't an "expected" path for me to follow. There don't really seem to be any clear cut "milestones" in life that I should be looking forward to. Sometimes this ambiguity gets to me. Not know what to expect in the future and all.

For example, when she says, "My husband is soooo immature!!! He never spends time with me!!! When he gets home from work, all he does is play video games!!! The only time that he talks to me is during dinner, but it's only about work!!!", which is, at the basic level, the same as saying, "I am so immature for not realizing that my husband works REALLY hard to put bread on the table and that he is making the necessary sacrifices, so that the two of us will have a happy life together. If I could understand what he puts up with on a daily basis, I would've realized that my husband plays video games as a way to destress, so that he doesn't turn into a serial killer. If I wasn't so self centered and needy, I would appreciate him for who he is and wouldn't try to change him because, ironically, trying to change him would be immature.". See what I mean?

I find it really offensive and inappropriate for a teacher to call a student 'lazy' and a 'liar' and she's the one who's lazy. She's the teacher, she should be grading the papers, not us. She also said I was using a "blue" pen when I was using a "BLACK" pen and she rolls her eyes at me when I told her that.      So anyways, today, I went to the counselor for some help and my counselor started to be completely brutal to me and say things like I change the story.... I don't know where she got that from. First, I told her the story and she kept interrupting me so obviously, she WOULD have problems understanding it when she didn't even let me finish. Then, she wants ME to TALK to the TEACHER.... Why on earth would I talk to a teacher who calls me a liar and lazy when that teacher herself falsely accuses me of things and refuses to listen when I defend myself. This counselor isn't even a counselor to start with. She was a kindergarten teacher for 9 years and this school hires her....      Anyways, please help. Idk what to do now. It seems like this no-brained counselor doesn't want to help and only want to criticize me and support the teacher because she USED to be a teacher..... Also, don't mention my parents because they abuse me and this is why I'm really sensitive not only to myself but to everyone around me.      I'm getting once-a-week counseling because of things with my parents and such so you don't have to worry and thanks for your concern.

20090220193644AA5jNO3	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	When you listen to Church's saying lets bring unity does this worry you?	With so many different Christian beliefs, unity only seems possible if the TRUTH is compromised.    Christian Church's are saying lets come together under the banner of Jesus and put our differences aside. So the Catholic Church and now a lot of Protestant Church's are joining hands, but it seems that the Protestant Church's are the ones sacrificing there beliefs to bring unity.    Most Protestant Church's were founded on the belief that the Pope/his position is the Anti Christ. Luther, Knox and Calvin all knew this.   What do you see happening? and do you think its good or do you think the Protestants will lose their identity in the long run?   If you are up to date on these happenings please respond.      I asked this before but would like to hear more answers.

20090220182947AAAc5mv	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do Asians stare at me even when I'm Asian too?	I'm Asian (Filipino) and it seems like I mostly get stares from other Asians (usually from Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese). I have tan skin, but my eyes and face look like any other Asians. When I talk to some Chinese they stare at me wide-eyed, and today a Japanese woman kept staring at me, even as I sat down next to her with her eyes like this (0_0). It kind of made me feel uneasy.      What I don't get is if in Asia it's considered rude to stare why some still do it anyways. I refer to Asia too because some Asians that do stare at me have accents, while most are from here (the US).      I'm not paranoid because I stare back at them and try to smile. Some do smile, but others just look pissy at times.

I am not racist (at all), I just really don't get this. Maybe it is just my "white" point of view, and if it is, maybe you can help me understand. To me these things would be racist if reversed, so I don't see how it is different. If I were black, I would be offended if someone thought I only made it to college because of the color of my skin (affirmative action) and not because I worked my butt off. Especially nowadays. Black people, white people, hispanic people- you name it- we are all smart and while there are less intelligent people in every race (because color doesn't affect that), we all have the privilege to attend college if we work for it.       Same goes for black history month.  i learned about important black people in history, right along with white people, but not because we had a month devoted to it- we just did.  i'm irish and although we weren't slaves, we were treated like trash when we immigrated over here.  i don't need a month.  to me, this type of thing is what seperates blacks from whites.  instead of saying we are all equal, we are saying "we are not, so let's have our own month and our own tv to try and raise awareness"  i don't know, i just don't think it's a good way to go about it.  i, personally, don't care what color someone is- i have friends and family from most races- i just don't like segraegation from any side of any type.      anyway, sorry- can you help me see another side of this?

My son has a GED and the high school diploma he will receive is not from an accredited school, therefore considered a Tier Two school.  He has been passionate about being a Marine since he was very young.  He has been in Job Corps and completed a 24 month welding trade in 16 months. He has been president of the student government as well as the treasurer, yet none of that seems to matter because he doesn't have a "high school diploma".  Job Corps told me that when he graduated, he would earn his GED as well as a high school diploma.  They never said that it was a "non-accredited" diploma! He is due to graduate in a few weeks and was led to believe the Marines were working getting him as a Tier Two, now they say he needs a HS diploma!

Not to say that I am not happy sometimes, but I can not come up with a time that I wasn't angry about something. I am 16 and I not that  stressed out, I have friends (that I like) and I'm happy around them sometimes. They know how I am. These are the things that everyone knows make me MAD! 1) Listing at me, like you need to clean your room, bring down the laundry, and finish that english assignment. 2) Repeating, like even to other people like if I'm with someone and they say the same thing twice to 2 different people while I 'm there, but especially to me. 3) I know this happens to everyone and that I should just get used to it but. When people don't understand what I'm saying like if I say something too fast or whatever and I have to repeat it, ohhh that's bad news.4) When people interrupt me, or don't listen to me. That's a big one!!! Again I just feel you should know that I enjoy being by myself and I have no patience for people. what people say is that I couldn't live without other people, but I like to ignore them and be unsocial, just to enjoy them being there not nesscesarily to listen or talk to them. I enjoy noise especially music(very loud) because then it is easy for people to ignore me. I am interested in studying people just not associating with them.

She came into the locker room and told me there was nothing she could do because the child was with his mother. She did say she would talk to her supervisor about it later.

I've met a ton of priests, missionaries and nuns, and for some reason, they all believe I will grow up to become a priest. Now my parents and family have the crazy idea I'll become a priest. I would always help the clergy and missionaries with simple things, and I know a ton about our church. The problem is, I don't want to become a priest. I've thought about it, but it doesn't exactly appeal to me. I know if people keep pressuring me, I'm going to grow up resenting the Catholic Church. What would be the nicest possible way without offending everyone to tell them I do not want to become a priest, and the life just doesn't appeal to me? The reasons I believe they think I'd make a priest are: I know a lot about the church at my age, I have a low libido(so I'm not one of those crazy horny teenage boys), and I am sterile(so I can't have kids). Any advice? Thanks beforehand.

I'm currently working on a small "for fun" project where I come up with some generalized names that are combinations of Chinese words for different concepts and animals.      I'm looking for someone who is familiar with Chinese and can double-check what I have so far. I just want to make sure the words I'm using mean what they think I mean, and that the combinations don't have any unwanted homophones... don't want to find out somewhere down the line that one of these names sounds like the Chinese word for "fart", or something like that!      Input on the structure would also be appreciated; I've kept the two-word structure ("sand box" as opposed to "sandbox") because I am unsure of how words are conjoined in Chinese, which word would be most likely to come first, etc. --if I could get any input on that, that would be great, but if not that's OK; mostly I'm concerned about the meaning/homophones.      The names I'm looking to get an opinion on are:         He Yong (crane forever)   Kirin Shi (unicorn scholar)   Li Yuen (carp destiny)   Lu Ping (stag evenness)   Shi Qi (lion Qi)      *Any* help would be greatly appreciated.

Doesn't this prove the Joseph was Jesus' father after all?  Genealogy is about physical bloodlines, not spiritual relationships.  They apparently use two different bloodlines.

That all these men were tortured horribly and gave their lives for a magic trick?  Would anyone do this for David Blaine?      Matthew suffered martyrdom in Ethopia, killed by a sword wound.      Mark died in Alexandria, Egypt, dragged by horses through the streets until he was dead.      Luke was hanged in Greece as a result of his tremendous preaching to the lost.      John was boiled in a huge basin of boiling oil during a wave of persecution in Rome. However, he was miraculously delivered from death. John was then sentenced to the mines on the prison island of Patmos where he wrote his prophetic Book of Revelation. The Apostle John was later freed and returned to serve as a bishop in modern Turkey. He died an old man, the only Apostle to die peacefully.      Peter,was crucified upside down on an x-shaped cross, according to Church tradition, because he told his tormentors that he felt unworthy to die the same way that Jesus Christ had died.      James the Just, the leader of the Church in Jerusalem and brother of Jesus, was thrown down more than a hundred feet from the southeast pinnacle of the Temple when he refused to deny his faith in Christ. When they discovered that he survived the fall, his enemies beat James to death with a fuller's club. This was the same pinnacle where Satan had taken Jesus during the Temptation.      James the Greater, a son of Zebedee, was a fisherman by trade when Jesus called him to a lifetime of ministry. As a strong leader of the Church, James was ultimately beheaded at Jerusalem. The Roman soldier who guarded James watched amazed as James defended his faith at his trial. Later, the officer walked beside James to the place of execution. Overcome by conviction, he declared his new faith to the judge and knelt beside James to accept beheading as a Christian.      Bartholomew, also known as Nathanael, was a missionary to Asia. He witnessed about our Lord in present day Turkey. He was whipped to death for his preaching in Armenia.      Thomas was speared and died on one of his missionary trips to establish the Church in India.      Jude, another brother of Jesus, was killed with arrows after refusing to deny his faith in Christ.      Matthias, the Apostle chosen to replace the traitor Judas Iscariot, was stoned and beheaded.      Barnabas, one of the group of seventy disciples, was stoned to death at Salonica.      Paul was tortured and then beheaded by the evil Emperor Nero at Rome in A.D. 67. Paul endured a lengthy imprisonment which allowed him to write his many epistles to the Churches he had formed throughout the Roman Empire. These letters, which taught many of the foundational doctrines of Christianity, from a large portion of the New Testament.      How does an Atheist explain this?

20090219082149AANI4lS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did God make a mistake, or is there some other explanation?	I would like some help on this Biblical prophecy, if there is anyone out there that can assist in explaining this to me...       In reading the Gospel of Matthew, at Matt 2:23, it is claimed that when Joseph took his family to Nazareth, he fulfilled that "which was spoken by the prophets, 'He shall be called a Nazarene.'"  http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...        The problem I have here is that NOWHERE in the Old Testament neither the word "Nazarene" nor the word "Nazareth" is even mentioned, so how exactly could it be true that the prophets predicted that the Messiah would be a Nazarene?       Now, before one attempts to explain this away by pointing out that Matthew said that this prophecy was "spoken" and not "written", I can point you to at least three other prophecies that Matthew wrote about in which he said that the prophets "had spoken", but they are in fact written prophecies... for instance, in Matt 3:3, speaking of John the Baptist, Matthew states that "For this is he who was SPOKEN of by the prophet Isaiah, saying:“ The voice of one crying in the wilderness:‘ Prepare the way of the LORD;Make His paths straight.’”  This is almost word for word what is WRITTEN in Isaiah 40:3  http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?boo...        So, it would appear that Matthew was in the habit of introducing written prophecies by stating that they were "spoken" by the prophets. Yet, this particular prophecy has no basis in OT Scripture.       So, did God make a mistake when he divinely inspired Matthew to write his Gospel?? Or, is it more likely that this is further proof that the Bible is a work of composite literature filled with mistakes and inconsistencies?

My take on it, is that he was trying to teach everyone that they can do the same things he can, bring the christ into manifestation.  I don't mean to offend or anything, but, is the way you look at it, like, jesus is better than the rest of us, and there will never be anyone as good as him and that's how god wants it?  Also, that Jesus died for your sins so that you could sit around and be lazy?  If that is what a person believes, i personally do not agree.  I find the physical incarnation known as jesus to have been an example, not a man to be worshiped.  Your take on it? (Not trying to argue, just give me your input please, thanks!)

20090220222045AATQszy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	This question is for believers ONLY?	ok so the bible doesn't mention that jesus was born on december 25.      luke 2:8-11 'mentions that when jesus was being born there were Shepherd's living out in the outfield and watching over their flock.      if you do your homework and look up when people do this in Bethlehem, judea it shows you how they do this around april or may.   in fact it's to cold in december and people don't even come out that much. so it's almost impossible that shepherd's would be living outside.   and the new catholic encyclopedia recognizes that the only reason that this date was chosen was because at the time people actually honored the sun.    so why do you believe that jesus was born in december?   is it something that you were brought up with?   what is your insight on this?

20090203103308AAVfL3B	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	What do I do when I've fallen in love with my best friend who happens to be straight?	About 4 years ago I met this boy Alex who became my first best friend I've ever had(I used to be really shy). Although I couldn't understand it at the time he truly wanted to be close friends with me regardless of my shyness and awkwardness. He was the popular jock type, and I was someone who actually didn't fit anywhere to be honest.       About a year after we became friends(we were attached to the hip) I came out to him. He took it so casually it winded me. He told me when I started crying he figured either I had a terminal illness or I was gay. Only he was able to make me laugh in that kind of situation. That was the moment when I realized I was truly deeply in love with him. It took me a full half hour to get myself composed enough to tell him I'm gay which I realized was because I was afraid of losing him.       After awhile I told him I was in love with him because I needed him to know that I can't bare seeing him and his girlfriend together. He cared about me enough to keep that part of his life away from me. I've dated other guys while I've known him, but in the end my feelings for him have always been stronger.       I know the difference between love and lust, and believe me I do lust for his body but that doesn't even compare to how much I love him.    Although he is straight he was always pretty open to me with our closeness. He used to cuddle with me, allow me to hold his hand in the movie theater, dance with me, and occasionally sleep with me(not sex). When we cuddled he was more often then not the "little spoon" which I figured was because of how insecure he truly was.       After awhile though our relationship became strained. Which could have been one of two things.   1. People assuming he's gay or making fun of him being so close with a gay guy started to bother him. As I said, he's extremely insecure.    2. He started to get feelings for me and that scared him.   I honestly think it's both.      So the question is, What do I do when I've fallen in love with my best friend who happens to be straight?

I hear loads of Christians ranting about how there is no evidence for evolution when in fact evidence is everywhere.  This notion of intelligent design would make the intelligent creator a complete moron.  Why design a worm that lives inside your stomach, why design a disease that eats your flesh and causes you terrible pain.      Christians laugh at atheists for thinking we came from primates and that we are not animals when that is exactly what we are.  We are no different from an animal, we decompose we feel pain, there is no differences between us and all the animals.      During foetal development the baby at one point has a tail which is a DNA print from our evolutionary past.  The only reason religion exists is to try and hide from the the brutal truth that we are nothing more than animals.       "maybe there is no reason, maybe there is just a big ball of rock and water floating about out there and we're just along for the ride" South Park.      There is no reason for us and that to me is amazing I am currently sat on a massive ball of rock spinning through space for no reason.  I would love to believe a loving God put me here but that makes no sense at all as nature is not love it is survival and pain.      Religion hides you from the harsh reality.

Israel was begging for the war to end after 33 days.      Israel could not stop any missle for 33 days.       Israel could not enter ONE village in Lebanon. They quickly met resistance.      Israel lost 30 soldiers trying to enter ONE village, residing on a mountain top.       Israel killed 1,191 civilians....60% being children...the rest Innocent women and Innocent men      Israel Carpet Bombed Lebanon      Sayyed Hassan told Israel, if you attack Beirut, we will attack Haifa, and beyond Haifa, and beyond that.       When Israel attacked...they weren't even able to count the number of missles that were flying into Haifa...it was Pouring rockets.      When Israel had besieged Beirut in the night (on the first day of war). Sayyed Hassan went on TV and said "Right Now, in the middle of the ocean, opposite to beirut, the Israel Military Warship, which assaulted our infrastructure, the peoples houses, and the civilians, look at it BURNING, and with it, the tens of the Israeli Zionist Soldiers."      When Sayyed Hassan said "look at it BURNING"...Lebanon saw and heard a big explosion...indeed it was burning.       That night we slept without interuption.       My best memories in Lebanon is that of the Lebanese war.      At first, America wouldn't stop the war, but after Israel lost soo much, America was forced to bring forth a truce.       Israel accepted the truce because on the last days of the war...Israel had experienced the most damage ever....tens of Soldiers, Airplanes, and Merkava tanks.      On the last day day of the war...Israel saw the most number of Rockets hitting Lebanon.       I guess Israel understands we wont take this **** anymore.      ?? ??? ????? ?????

There is also a culture of racism that exist inside gay clubs, and heterosexual white guys themselves have told me that gays hates black people.  What is behind the psychology of being gay and racist?  How would Freud interpret this phenomenon?       http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=g...           http://www.google.co.uk/search?    hl=en&q=gay+skinheads&meta=       http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=g...        http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=g...        http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=g...

20090220221338AAvRL23	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A question about reincarnation?	Why is is that people who believe in reincarnation always claim to have been a Roman senator, or an Indian chief, or Cleopatra?  Why don't they ever claim to have been, for example, a young Jewish immigrant who died in the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, impoverished and obscure?  Or an Irish immigrant who died of dysentary aboard a ship fleeing the potato famine, and 'buried' at sea (i.e., thrown overboard)?   Or, even, a Nazi camp guard who murdered dozens, and was then killed himself during a camp uprising?

20090220223039AArGmSA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do Christians hate gays?	I don't get it. Doesn't god teach you to be understanding and accepting? I know many different sections of the bible and it does talk about judgement. "I will judge you, your blood shall flow..". However, hasn't homosexuality been proven time and time again that it is biological? If we, as christians, should hate them, should we use the same logic and hate all people with genetic disorders? I believe homosexuality is a biological disorder, by definition. However, I DON"T THINK THAT IT IS WRONG. In general, peple don't choose to be gay. Why does this happen?

I think atheist and theist have been in conflict on this forum for too long, and I think that if both of us cooperate we can end this pointless battle once and for all. I think we should both respect each others religion, and try to help each other rather than claim our beliefs are the "right" one and claiming ours is true and the other one isn't. So I think that we should stop posting on questions that ask stuff like "How can christians prove god.." and "How can atheist disapprove god.." etc. Rather we should focus on people who truly have a question on religion. If anyone agrees, please step forward.

Any advice at all, give it to me. Hopefully this will be good, because I have over two years to plan something, possibly the greatest senior prank my school has ever seen. Because last year, all it was was a bunch of stupid guys throwing water balloons in the commons which got shot down after the third throw.

I also think that i am more on the confident side. I know that everyone judges everyone else but i really try to give everyone a chance.      Basically, i know a some people that really dislike me and they dont even know me...they'll call me a slut sometimes and i've never even had a boyfriend. It's rediculous.      Also, on my facebook people write in my honesty box about how they heard about me smoking and drinking and i've never done that in my life.      And honestly, i understand how people dislike others, but do they really have to go around and spread rumors and tell lies???
20090220223059AAeO1kO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Struggling christain, and i need your help?	In the past year or so, I feel like I'm getting further and further away from God. I feel like I've let him down. I used to go to church nearly every sunday, and at one point in my life I felt very close to Him. But now, I feel like no matter how hard I try, I just can't find that same passion in my heart to read his word, and to know him more. I've started going to church with my boyfriend on wednesday nights, and I can feel God calling to me, trying to bring me closer to Him, but it's almost like I've forgotten how to be a christain. What I'm asking for here is advice, prayer, and some support from other Christains. Also, any websites that I could look into to help, possibly like daily devotionals and things of that nature. Any Bible verses that you find particularly inspiring would be great as well. By the way I'm 16.       Thankyou so so very much. And please, no anti-God  answers please, only supportive ones. Thankyou!

20090220213003AArspit	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question about Judaism; for anyone, but I would like to hear from some Jews?	I am an atheist, who was raised atheist, and am very new to religion.  I have only taken interest in it very recently.  This question is probably very ignorant, but it is not meant to be offensive.      I have heard a lot of people, Jews and Christians, refer to the Jews as "Gods chosen people".  From my readings as of late, I have a basic understanding of the story behind this.  God chose Moses, a Jew, as his prophet, and lead them out of slavery to the promised land, and took care of them directly.  They are somehow very special in the eyes of god, and warrant different treatment, including a "promised land".  I once heard a Christian say "The Jews are god's children, and Christians are god's adopted children."  That gave me the basic idea.      So, my question is, is it the Jewish RACE that is the chosen people, or simply followers of the Jewish religion.  If I want to be one of god's chosen people, can just go read the Torah right now and become a Jew and one of the chosen people by the end of the week, or would I have to have been born as a member of the Jewish race.      Most Christians who go around saying that the Jews are god's chosen people do not ever convert convert to Judaism.  Unless they don't want to be ones of god's chosen people, (which seems unlikely to me) the only reason I can think of why all of these Christians wouldn't become Jews is that it is in fact the Jewish RACE that is chosen of god.  If that is the case, is Judaism an inherently racist religion, giving god's preference to those born of the race from which their religion came?

20090203095359AASgLHw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why human or call teacher of God's religion, normally get followers to care only their group? ?	In Malacca when we celebrate Chinese New Year, we order big amount of food from the Malay in the village. They are happy to earn money and we are very happy to eat the food. We are friends or brothers & sister in Malacca.      I admire the Malay family have bungalow Malay house, land to plant fruits and some have little ponds or river by the side. They do not need to travel far or work very hard to earn for shelter. Basically many work nearby and earn slightly lower but they have life like in paradise.       Chinese, Indian and other races sometime were force to travel far to earn,  work day and night or 2 jobs a day, have little time to see and concern their children. They work very hard to pay rental of shelter, earn for buying house and education fees for children.      I hope all religion extend their concern and care for all human.       I think everybody should concern, care, nice and respect each other regardless of their religion or race.       I wish to see all human living in peace and harmony.

Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went abroad.       At the right time he sent a servant to the farmers to collect from them a share of the produce from the vineyard.    But the farmers grabbed the servant, beat him, and sent him back empty-handed.       Again, the man sent another servant to them. They beat the servant over the head and treated him shamefully.       Then the man sent another, and that one they killed. So it was with many other servants. Some of these they beat, and others they killed.       He still had one more person to send, a son whom he loved. Finally, he sent him to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'    But those farmers said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come on, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours!'       So they grabbed him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.    Now what will the owner of the vineyard do?

Well, I live in a southern state where there's really no Transgendered support nearby and even trying to crossdress or any mention of what I am(M2F) is met with violence or possible murder, if i tried any of this.      Mostly cause i've see homosexuals getting beat up just because they were what they were, I don't want to die. But not being able to transition is killing me all on itself.      I've came across the site inhousepharmacy.com and was wondering if it's safe to get hormones through that site.      I know most of you will say it's dangerous but I know the risk of hormones and i'd take the lowest possible dose, i'm sure i could manage getting laser hair removal but that's about all that's available to me.         i've been goofed on before about having a feminine face when shaved(makes me feel good actually) so my plan would be to take the hormones secretly until I developed my other feminine features then I could kinda just slide into the full swing of things, when my breast are visible enough and fat distribution is good enough i'll go full time; to beat the look of being a guy in female clothing.        So what are the consequences of ordering hormones online beside the health side effects?        Like I said i'll be safe, I know taking a ton of hormones is dangerous and doesn't speed up the process so i'll be certain not to do that.      Trust me when I say I have absolutely no other option.          help is greatly appreciated

20090220232914AA1VhOb	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why in the HELL is cannabis (Pot) still illegal? Question only for those heavily debated in the issue.?	I want this to be an open argument between the guys and girls who are for it and those who are against it.  I'm pro cannabis and i'll give you a list of reasons why I believe it's still illegal:       1) D.E.A. employees over 500,000 agents nation wide.  Over 70% of arrests made are on cannabis smokers.  If we legalized pot, that's a good 400,000 thousand or so out of a job.      2) Hard to tax.  With so much pot coming into this country from that narco state below us (Mexico), it'd be too hard to control and tax in their eyes.        3) Racism. Racism was the reason it was made illegal in the first place, and is the reason it is still illegal.  Pot comes from brown skinned countries, where as alcohol and cigarettes are products of caucasian environment.

I ask because hes been one of my bestfriends forever, and i really have strong feelings and i dont want to be lead on. and i went him to feel comfortable telling me things.

20090219122549AAwqHvS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do some christians say Islam is sexist when Christanity is JUST AS sexist?	God gives some pretty sexist commands regarding female slaves and how to sell your daughter, in exodus 21:7-11.      Deuteronomy 22:23-34 orders that an engaged woman who is raped by a foreigner must be stoned to death, for not crying out for "help" loudly enough.      However, if the woman is not engaged, the rapist must pay the girl's father 50 shekels and marry his victim, never to divorce her. (Deut. 22:28-29)      Islam may allow a man to marry four women, but that's nothing on King Solomon, who had "700 wives and 200 concubines". (1 Kings 11:1-3)      As punishment for David sleeping with Bathsheba and killing off her husband Uriah. God says someone will rape David's wives in broad daylight (2 Samuel 12:11-12). This someone turns out to be David's own son, Absalom (16:22).      That's not enough punishment for God though, so he also kills off the son that Bathsheba conceived from her first encounter with David (2 Samuel 12:14-18).      Oh and David consoles her by getting her pregnant again (12:24-25) Children are replaceable!      God sets the monetary value of a man always higher than that of a woman (Leviticus 27:3-7)      God "destests" any woman who wears men's clothing, according to Deuteronomy 22:5.      Now some of you may be protesting. "but that's the old testament!" - as if it's no longer a part of the bible you claim to believe in.      No worries though! There is plenty of sexism in the New testament too!      Women should be silent in church, and can only ask questions at home, to their husbands, after church is over.   (1 Corinth. 14:34-35)      1 Corinthanians 11:3 says that "the head of the woman is man". meaning that in the christian religion, women are to be the subordinate to men.   Verses 5 & 6 also describe how woman in churches with uncovered heads should have them shaved.         Romans 1:27: Explains how the natural use of women should be for the sexual gratification of men, and not other women.      According to 1 Timothy, Women should dress modestly (2:9) and remain quiet, in submission to men (2:11-12).      "Adam was not the one decieved; it was the woman who was decieved and became a sinner. But women will be saved during childbearing..." -1 Timothy 2:14-15      1 Peter 3:1-7 and many other verses in the bible also reiterate the theme of women being submissive to their husbands, sound familiar?

20090219144557AA0vLfQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does America’s religious hypocrisy lead to hatred and disgust of Western culture in general?	America is the most religiously influenced of the developed Western nations. It is also the most decadent, immoral and socially corrupt Western nation. So clearly there’s a certain level of hypocrisy going on here and I’m just wondering if you think this hypocrisy is at least partly responsible for the hatred and disgust of Western culture in general? Keep in mind that communists, terrorists, Islamists etc, you know, enemies of the West, are able to generate support in their communities by fanning the flames of this hatred, mistrust and revulsion that people have of Western culture. Do you think America is the source of all that is corrupt, the diseased cancerous growth, that is the source of corruption and filth in Western culture?
20090219150929AA2AbMC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did the US government’s treatment of Episcopalians during the War of Independence lead to American religion?	Episcopalians are like the American version of the Church of England. When the US declared independence from Britain, the US government forced the Church of England practitioners to change their religion because at that time, the clergy of this church had to swear allegiance to the British monarch and if they did that when the US was at war with Britain, then it was treason.      So this leads me to conclude that the US leaders would have encouraged their people to distance themselves from older European religions and invent new American religions. And this was music to the American people’s ears because they took these instructions literally and invented religions reeking with good old American phoniness like Mormons, JW’s, Adventists, etc. and in the modern era, this philosophy still exists and we have Scientologists, Christian Science, Exclusive Brethren etc. But do you think American’s creativity regarding religions first began with the US government wanting to make a new nation with new everything even if it meant inventing a bunch of nonsense and calling it religion because at least it was an American religion?

20090219144210AAMzhOe	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Psychics, please help me. Questions about my love life....?	Ok, first, let me tell you a bit about myself since I know it's hard to do this kind of stuff over the internet with little information.      I'm a quiet, sympathetic, sensitive, 16 year old gay male. I don't really want to tell anyone I'm gay until I really trust them. I haven't even told my friend from grammar school and we knew each other for currently 4 years! I'm still not sure if I can trust him with my secret. The only people who currently know is my 2 cousins and possibly another one of my cousins. I told one of my gay friends that I was gay but me and him don't talk anymore. Our friendship grew distant. After that, I told one of my female friends that I was gay and me and her don't talk anymore because she keeps getting into fights and getting on punishment. She sometimes sneak on the computer at night so that we can talk.      One of my first major crushes was the friend from my grammar school who knew me for 4 years. He used to give me "hints" but probably he was just playing around, who knows? Even if he was bi-sexual and scared to tell anyone, he has a girlfriend and I accepted the fact that we can't be together if things are like this. I've got rid of my crush for him. Thank God I never told him I had a crush on him. I'm not even sure how he'd react to me telling him that I'm gay let alone that I like him.      There was this boy from grammar school who was so beautiful. He was light-skin, Puerto Rican, had nice eyes and a sexy voice. I could never speak to him though because I would always get shy around him. We do know each other though, I mean, he was in my class for a whole year in grammar school and we would say "what's up" to each other and stuff. In the summer time, I had a dream that me and him were dating which is weird since I wasn't even obsessing over him at that time. A few days later, he called my HOUSE phone. I was thinking to myself "How!? I've never given any friend my house phone number and he doesn't know any family members, so how!?". I send him a message on Myspace asking "did you call me?" but he never said anything back. He still says "what's up" to me when he sees me though but we don't see each other a lot.      Another recent crush was this boy who gave me a video game. He also got jealous that my best friend (a girl) was hanging out with me.      The most recent crush is my other friend. Let's call him "T". When I was in his class, T always tried to make me laugh. I asked my parents for a new video game system and they said "no", then I told T about it and someone heard. They started to make fun of me and T cracked on them for me. He told me that he'll give me some of his games. Also, he always tries to see who I'm texting. He even asked me if I had a girlfriend but I said "no".      On Friday, we hanged out. We hanged out from 3PM to 8PM, just me and him. He took me to his house but said that I couldn't go in because his sister was there and she is really, really mean. He was concerned that I was gonna get sick so he gave me one of his hats. He also payed my way for the bus and bought me headphones. Then, he told me that he entered a competition to win the game system that I wanted.      He is very concerned about me. He tells me to put on my hood in the cold. He got mad because I took off from school. He seems very concerned about my well being.      Also, when me and him were walking, I almost slipped because of the ice. He told me to watch out before I embarrass myself. Then he said "Never mind, I'll never let you fall but if you do...I'll fall down with you....". I tried calling him twice but he never called me back.      What's going on psychics? Why are these guys acting like this? Giving hints but never saying anything when I try to talk to them? Besides that why say something as romantic as " I'll never let you fall but if you do...I'll fall down with you...." but then don't even come in contact with me a lot anymore?      We he does come in contact at lunch time but I hang out with some other friends. After school, I wish I could see him and when I do HE is with some other friends.      I was mad that he told this gay guy that he was bi-curious but he hasn't told ME a thing. That just pissed me off. But, I'm not even going to make myself angry by thinking of it.      I'm being as positive as I can be...      I TRUST and EXPECT the God/Universe will one day arrange for me and my soul-mate to be together but I'm curious about these guys I've talked about here? Is there any future with any of them? Where do you see my love life going?         Where do you see my love life headed?

20090219144650AAYUuqn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did you know this about "irreverance"?	I found this to be a very telling thing about human nature, and I wanted to share it with others...      We humans use the word "irreverent" to describe an action that someone else takes towards our God - a lack of respect or reverence. So, from the first person POV, if someone lacks reverence or respect for your god, THEY are being irreverent.       However, there is no word in the human language to describe the act of the first person lacking respect for someone else's God... While you might think it would be the same "irreverence", it is only irreverent from the POV of the person whose God is being disrespected - not from the POV of the person doing the disrespecting...       What do you think it says about human nature when we cant even come up with a word for describing our own disrespect for someone else's God??

They listened to the voice of god and did as he asked.      So what happens if they kill somebody in the name of god? does that make them a good christian? i mean they listened to the voice of god and did as he asked, so was it a good thing that they took somebody's life or a bad thing?      Could somebody please clear this up for me?

20090219144633AAGgBno	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why don't churches enforce Corinthians 11:5 and 6 ?	The Bible says in Corinthians:   5 And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head—it is just as though her head were shaved.   6 If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head.      So, any woman who prays in church without covering her hair should have her head shaved by the other believers!      Why don't they do what the Bible says in any of the churches I've been to?

That people believe that the end is near, rather than believing that the world will continue for millions of more years and they are utterly forgotten seems to me to be nothing more than human vanity.  Unfortunately, such a worldview does not motivate people to be conscientious stewards of the Earth.

20090219121135AAzue7h	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is your spiritual/religious stance on animal treatment?	Bet this wasn't asked before...but I was going through a pamphlet which showed the horrors of how animals are treated in factories, in the way and manner pigs and chickens are caged up and slaughtered mercilessly and it made me wonder what do people of various beliefs feel about this?       I mean, many tenets in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam encourage peace and rightful treatment of people. Many New Age and various spiritual beliefs of the Native Americans and Pagans include respect for the earth and land.       So, should it be considered sinful/spiritually immoral to mistreat animals and have slaughterhouses that provide inhumane treatment when animals too are God's creation? (Of course, this assuming you believe in a higher power/God).       What's your stance on animal mistreatment? I'm mainly asking people who do have spiritual and/or religious beliefs and background, and if you do follow a religion and have a stance, please include the verses from your text that supports your claim.
20090219120120AAVUBY0	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Ask my co-workers to help with homeless people who walk into the office?	I work in an office building that doesn't always have a receptionist up front.  Sometimes homeless people, or semi-homeless people, or even sales people just wander into the building, up the stairs and come to my space.  How can I ask my fellow co-workers to help if they sense or see that some homeless person is standing around my space and begging me for a few dollars?  Most of my co-workers are male and they could easily come over and rescue me - but they don't.  This is a 10 person office with other smaller companies within the building.

We are a People for his name.........But let The Creator tell you he says it best at : Isaiah 43:6 Do not keep back. Bring my sons from far off, and my daughters from the extremity of the earth, 7 everyone that is called by my name and that I have created for my own glory, that I have formed, yes, that I have made.’      8 “Bring forth a people blind though eyes themselves exist, and the ones deaf though they have ears. 9 Let the nations all be collected together at one place, and let national groups be gathered together. Who is there among them that can tell this? Or can they cause us to hear even the first things? Let them furnish their witnesses, that they may be declared righteous, or let them hear and say, ‘It is the truth!’”      10 “YOU are my witnesses,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “even my servant whom I have chosen, in order that YOU may know and have faith in me, and that YOU may understand that I am the same One. Before me there was no God formed, and after me there continued to be none. 11 I—I am Jehovah, and besides me there is no savior.”      Jesus gave us a special work to do. The final Witness work, We read... . . .And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come. (Matthew 24:14)   Jesus wants us to knock on doors for he says: Look! I am standing at the door and knocking. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come into his [house] and take the evening meal with him and he with me.--Revelation 3:20      Here is a link...    http://watchtower.org/e/archives/index.h...

20090219142219AAOJ4QB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does God believe in atheists?	St. Paul weighed in on this question in Romans 1:18-20:  "The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse."      Is God's creative power so clearly stamped on his creation as to be unmistakable, so that God's reality is self-evident?  Or do atheists have a reasonable alternative explanation for the wonders of intelligent life in a designer world in a universe with an unmistakable beginning?

As a catholic, I would hope that people would understand that we give honor to Mary as the mother of Christ.

In my religion, it is said success is our birthright and we are born with three blessings.  Purity, sitting in the heart throne of the father, and peace.      I find it so unfathomable that a religion says that we are born with original sin...especially when Jesus died for your sins therefore from the beginning you are tainted and the only way is to accept Jesus and ask for forgiveness.  This to me destroys the concept of "salvation" and "repenting"

20090219142659AAC7pDi	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is faith just a following or a way of life?	Okay, sort of a follow up to my previous question where I got ripped by a lot of disagreeing fellow Christians.   Many quoted the bible to counter act my question and many said that those who aren't Christians have no hope of going to heaven.   I disagree. You can't possibly say that everyone who isn't Christian will go to hell. Even if these people match God's criteria for being good.   Surely if people who don't believe but still have Christ-like traits can gain entry into heaven.   I believe that you can be Christ-like without faith. And through this, God will recognize the good in you can grant you entry to heaven.   Opinions?

Paul of Tarsus is a FALSE teacher who preached to DESTROY the teachings of Christ. He succeeded through creating Christianity which abolished the true laws of God and preached it to the gentiles. CHRISTIANS SEEM TO FORGET THAT PAUL OF TARSUS WAS A JEW WHO HATED CHRIST and his glorious teachings.      No where in the scripture does Jesus say that Paul of Tarsus should be listened to. Christ himself said that MANY FALSE TEACHERS would come, and DENY HIS TEACHINGS and spread the false gospel to the world. This false gospel my Christian friends, is the false religion of Christianity which has destroyed and corrupted the teachings of Christ. Where in the Bible does it say that Paul should be listened to? Where in the Bible are there prophecies of Paul and his mission? Where in the Bible is the legitimacy of Paul? These questions cannot be answered adequately. The whole Christian faith collapses on enquiring on these questions. No flaming posts please. Thanks in advance

Could you please tell me how the following examples are mistranslated by non believers? Apparently we don't have the same eyes as you when we quote from the bible, and what we see really isn't as bad as we first think... just grabbed a couple as i couldn't fit them all in here..      "Take your son, your only son – yes, Isaac, whom you love so much – and go to the land of Moriah.  Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains, which I will point out to you."  (Genesis 22:1-18)      "I will make Mount Seir utterly desolate, killing off all who try to escape and any who return.  I will fill your mountains with the dead. Your hills, your valleys, and your streams will be filled with people slaughtered by the sword.  I will make you desolate forever. Your cities will never be rebuilt. Then you will know that I am the LORD.  (Ezekiel 35:7-9 NLT)      Now i am asking an honest question. When there is a discussion between the two groups, i have been told off for 'mis quoting' stuff or mis translating, or taking it too literally. I'd like it cleared up, what parts of the bible involving murder, rape, sacrifice etc should and shouldn't be taken literally?      TYVM.

20090219124222AAc3je7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do religious people present their faith as fact?	Many religious people say that they dont need evidence to support their beliefs because they have absolute faith in God/the Bible. The word "faith" is defined as: "Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence."  That being said, how is it that 'believers' can claim to be absolutely, 110 percent, beyond a shadow of a doubt, certain about what they believe?  I find this to be a huge flaw in theism.  Simply by the definition of the word faith, people who accept their beliefs without any proof MUST also accept that there is a possibility that they could be wrong. No matter how tiny that possibility may seem to 'believers', it is always there and it cannot be refuted.  Every single religious faith; be it Christian, Muslim, Jew or any other contains the same possibility of being wrong.  So what makes one faith more right than the other without facts or proof? I'll use an analogy. Using a deck of playing cards, I make you a wager that drawing one card at random, I would pick any other card except for the 2 of Hearts. "If I'm right," I say to you, "then you owe me a dollar. But if Im wrong, then I'll give you $1000".  Of course you say you would take that bet. And I reply, "Why would you? The odds arent in your favor. Just give me your dollar now because I know Im not going to draw the 2 of Hearts". But you respond, "How do you know? That card is in the deck and you could just as likely draw it." I smugly respond, "But I wont". You counter, "But you COULD". Again I claim, "But I WONT. Im absolutely sure of it. So strong is my faith and that Im willing to bet a large sum of money on it." I draw a card from the deck, and sure enough.....its the 2 of Hearts and Im $1000 poorer. My blunder was in denying the possibility that I could be wrong, no matter how unlikely it may have seemed.  My point being, there is no such thing as absolute certainty in faith because the possibility of an alternate explanation is and will always be there.  It is the very definition of the word "faith".  I believe Einstein was quoted as saying, "Facts do not cease to be facts simply because people choose to ignore them".  And for those people who say, "Well, I DO accept the possibility that I could be wrong in my faith, but I choose to believe it anyway, because I want to be saved".  My question to them is, do you TRULY have faith? or is it simply fear of repercussion? Fear of the unknown? Better safe than sorry? If you seriously believe that such a faith is going to save you, why would you choose to worship a God that would accept that kind of  pseudo-devotion in the first place?

20090219144627AAvcFWC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people think God created Evil?	You can not measure darkness.  Darkness is the absence of light.  It can not be measured.  You can only measure the amount of light not the lack of it.        There is no such thing as death.  Death is just the absence of life.  You can't be more dead.  Once your life is gone it is just death.        You can't measure cold.  There is no such thing as cold there is only absence of heat.        Like wise, the same principle applies to Evil.  There is no such thing as evil and bad.  Bad is the absence of good and Evil is the absence of God.  You can't measure how much God there isn't only how much God there is.      Then you say there is no such thing as God because he doesn't exist.  You can't see him or feel him or taste him, but I can assure you he is there.        and for you who are going to argue that statement.  Well you have no brains.  You can't see it, hear it, taste, touch, or feel it so be careful how you answer this one.      God Bless everyone who reads this :)

If he didn't exist then why is B.C. used?  I read these in history books, like in literature AND in things like school history books.  Why would history (something that really should only have facts, etc. rather than religious irrelevances) include something linked to religion like that to tell the date's of "non-religion" associated events?      Is that really what it stands for?  I'm asking out of curiosity.

20090219113639AA4VGb3	Society & Culture;Languages	Any fluent spanish speaker that can help me translate this please?	(please can you avoid using an online translator, as they are never right) thankyou       'Unemployment for Tenerifes inhabitants has almost doubled in the last year. There are two main factors that are influencing this. It is true that many jobs are being taken by people from overseas. Alot of the buisnesses in Tenerife are catering for tourists, these therefore are dominated by English, Itallian or Germans. In many cases they only employ workers of their own nationalities to fill seasonal job placements.      The other factor is the current economic recession the world is facing. Its hard not to notice how hard this is hitting the tourism industry in the south. You can see it on the street, when im driving to work many bars are empty and many are closed. Its scary, just walking around, the number of houses and apartments up for sale or rent is incredible. You can tell there is less work down in tourist land because the waiters aren't having their afterwork drinks in the bars. There is just very little money around and sadly, it's getting worse. By the time we get into April it is going to be desperate.

Although I can't take classes until I move to Holland I wanted to get a jump start on it.      I was wondering what other people did to learn another language. Did you study everyday for a certain amount of time? Was there anything in particular you started with (like just getting a basic vocabulary, or the sentence structure)?      Any tips would be very helpful!   Oh, and since you're here.. what other language do you know? ;)      Thank you~

I am Hebrew which is the same as Jew except that Hebrews are black. In school there is a day where you can dress in your native clothing. I wear a skirt and a shirt which is basically what we wear, she looks at me and says that what I am wearing isn't Jewish because I didn't cover my arms.  At first I didn't pay it any mind but later on in the day I felt as though she was calling me a liar because most people that I come across think that it is impossible to be  a black Jew. We hang out together and we talk all of the time. Should I blow it off or should I stop hanging with her?

I live in a town with three synagogues (none of which I attend) and a "Messianic" congregation, and on my way out of the Chabad house (where I was babysitting the rabbi's kids) a Messianic person stopped and told me that following the Talmud (which, being secular, I have never even seen) was false and the truth was in Jesus and the Torah. I asked him if his congregation lights Shabbos candles. He said yes. I asked him why he followed a Talmudic law if the Talmud is false. He changed the subject. So I am wondering if there are any here who know the answer.
