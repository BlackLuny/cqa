yr1hEsa0aa	The drunk its I ever seen some one is when I rode in the ambulance with them to the hospital and waited for their parents to get there. If I wouldn't have called 911 he would died.   Thats why you don't drink on an empty stomach and you stop when you throw up a couple times. He had to pump his stomach and he spent 2 days in hospital on a couple IVs.  It was one of the scariest moments of my life.   Everyone the whole time was telling me not to call 911 because they were to scared to get underages. But letting some one die would have been better?|`|xv3opX9Maa	my bro, he tried to go swimming in the fish tank at my grandparents house and he told some old lady to suck his **** and he said it in front of my grandparents and he broke a chair  that was actually the verry first time i everr seen somebody drunk in my life  ( =|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	My cousin is a complete rumaholic.

I wasnt able to hide it after week 15!!!  the doc said ill get huge around week 30! wow its almost here!

8NHm2KJ8aa	There isn't too much you can do, but you don't need to worry about it.  Believe it or not, a crib is a relatively soft material, and the distance from which your baby can fall to hit the side of the crib is not much, so the total impact will be at most a minor irritation for her.  My son is one and a half and we hear all kinds of bonks and bangs coming from his room when he sleeps.  It doesn't bother him and he has had much worse falls outside of his crib.

5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Sounds right.  She chose to move to Germany and have a daughter there.

Sure it sucks, but that's just how it is.    She was born in Germany, that makes her a german citizen, and her 'usual' residence germany.    My parents were born in england, i still had to apply for a passport/citizenship for europe once i was 18, because i am an australian. that's just how it works.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	Is she German or Belgian or Greek?|`|3haXFtx7aa	1 use proper english!  2 sounds ok to me. she was kinda stupid!|`|AA10246871	She broke the law. Obviously that was the finding not only of the German courts, but of the US Federal Judge who ruled on the case.    It doesn't matter who you are or where you are from. If you take your child without the agreement of the other parent, it's called kidnapping. And yes, most governments will rule against a parent who kidnaps a child, even if it's their child, and especially if the child is removed to another country. Her parental rights were terminated to guarantee that she doesn't pull the same stunt again.    If she'd stayed in Germany longer, and done it the legal way, she'd still have parental rights. Most likely, she would also have secured permission to take her daughter to the US for a set amount of time, and an agreement to share custody with the child's father. She chose to break the law, and now she has to pay the penalty.|`|CRVi3YsOaa	my sister-in-law lost her son, because she left her husband in the middle of the night with their son and crossed state lines from arkansas to texas. In Arkansas it is a felony to cross state lines, so I can only imagine the concequences for leaving the country. She was wrong for going about it the way she did. no matter where you are from you can not just exclude the other parent becuase you don't like where you are living. She could have went to court and got some kind of visitation set up and this whole situation would have been avoided.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	A mother can't lose paternal rights. Paternal means: of the father....    She did not have legal custody of the child before leaving the country.  Regardless of your nationality, this is called kidnapping.  When you kidnap your child, custody always reverts to the other parent.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i dont think that would really ever happen. the US government wouldnt let it.
NMjM2X4taa	I am a Christian, Jesus Christ is my Lord, my God, my All in All. though I grew up in church I always questioned the bible, and occasionally still do when I don't understand something. but my faith has found a resting place, not in device or creed, it is enough that Jesus died and that He died for me. this simple truth that I am not good enough and never will be good enough to enter heaven on my own finally sunk in to me one day. I began to study man's condition according to The Bible and why Jesus had to die the way he did. then I looked to the cross, and studied the execution of Jesus. I can never imagine the suffering that he went through, and that he did that in my place.     weather you believe in Jesus or not, you are a "bad person" just as I am, or anyone else in the world. and just believing that Jesus died is not enough ether. the Bible says "even the demons believe and tremble" what makes a difference is when you step back and give God full control of your life because He is and He is a rewarder of those that seek Him.     I am sorry you have seen such a twisted view of Christianity. In my home town we practice what we preach. I am 19, a virgin, never smoked, drunk, or cuss. look beyond that to the model of Christ, and find what you are seeking.|`|KbPrPuvhaa	im muslim   my whole family is but i dont cover my head. :]|`|ojTcrqAOaa	Catholic.

I have no idea if there is a higher power or not.  I grew up Lutheran though.|`|ynAXDyQDaa	I think i would be considered Agnostic, but I'm not sure.  Personally, I think Catholicism and Christianity are "make-believe" religions to me. My family is Catholic but I just can't agree with anything they say!

When I was first 'saved', I was attending a Presbyterian church.  I the church my (ex)wife's family was a member of when, I was 22.  We married at 25, separated at 29 and, divorced at 33.  During that whole time, I was a member of an ELCA(Evangelical Lutheran Churches of America) congregation.  When I moved into a house at 31, I took a long look at the ELCA 'Position Statements'.  I found that, I did not agree with a number of them.  That was due to the liberal stance of the ELCA.  I switched to an LCMS(Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod) congregation.  The LCMS is conservative in its' stance and, 'Position Statements'.|`|5D0KuT74aa	christian  i respect your choice of religion, as long as you respect mine  i have no idea what religion is true, i reaserched them all, and picked the one that made the most sense to me    Edit:  @miss dancer  you do bash other religions, by saying the virgin mary stuff is "crap"  thank you for contradicting yourself|`|QOukwuFhaa	i feel the same way. all of my fam. is christian, and i'm 14 too. lol  it sucks.    u can e-mail me if u want :)|`|SWsDa1iXaa	...uh, I already worship harry potter. -awkward-|`|drI1vsJdaa	I'm a Christian, and I believe in God and The Bible, because I have faith.    A lot of my friends are atheists though and I don't try to convert them, and they don't say anything bad about God either.|`|aaVod31Gaa	I was born into a Catholic family but do not believe in many of the things the religion teaches. I feel the religion is not open to diversity in any way, shape or form.  ..and it sticks to "old ways" that do not apply to these times.  I have come to believe things that Sylvia Browne www.sylvia.org teaches.  She claims she is a "gnostic"- and the reason I believe in her words is because it feels right in my heart. Her teachings, what she says about why we are here on this earth, our paths in life- they just seems "right."  It all just makes sense to me. She is not a cult leader- bec. she does not force or coerce anyone into her teachings. She even says, "take what you want, and leave the rest."  You should check her out.|`|eG8gJFRUaa	sometimes i believe im atheist and other times i believe im agnostic.  my family is split up between atheist, Christians, Methodists and a few other religions.|`|RAgWVuu4aa	I'm an atheist...I don't think I'm better than anyone, or smarter...I'm also fine with people who do follow a religion, so long as they don't impose their beliefs on others, or act intolerant toward others of different beliefs...    Anyway, I'm an atheist because I thought about different religions a lot, but none of them added up...Religion, to me, has MANY flaws that are just illogical...One of the main things that keeps religion alive is bind faith...Most of the people that follow a religion were raised from birth being taught that it was true, not that they should figure out what to believe for themselves...    I wasn't forced into any religion. My mom is Catholic and my dad is atheist. Neither of them ever tried to force their beliefs upon me...Of course, my mom DID teach me about Christianity, and I learned even more about it on my own, but in the end, I have turned out to be an atheist.    Please don't be ignorant and say we choose our beliefs...We don't. I have a horrible fear of death and wish I believed in an afterlife...But I don't get to choose that...If I could believe in one, I would, but I can't...    In all truth, I am happier not being restrained by doing things, or being made feel guilty about things I shouldn't feel guilty about...And my fear of death just makes me want to live life to the fullest and help the world as much as I can...You only live once (what I believe), so I want to live my life to the fullest and help others live their lives to the fullest...|`|IPXV1K1naa	I'm a Christian for so many reasons... Sometimes I think God's not there but I still believe in Him. I've always struggled with the Jesus thing, so I don't blame you.... =/    I grew up Christian, was atheist for a while and now I'm a Christian again. I do cuss, but I don't drink or do drugs, and I have very liberal views. (I'm against abortion, and I think cussing is okay in certain circumstances because they are just words, and I believe everyone goes to heaven eventually)...     I think the bible is a good book, and I think MOST of the things in it are  true, however I interpret stuff differently from others. For example, I don't think God "punishes" the world, I think He just backs off and stuff happens. I believe in a creator (I can't imagine it any other way), and I think Jesus was the son of God, but I'm not totally sure. And there are lots of things I don't understand.    But whatever, the way I see it, everyone will go to heaven in the end... No matter your belief...|`|2H6j4j8taa	I'm not religious, I am an atheist.    I am an atheist because there is no evidence that a "god" exists.
u0mZAPuDaa	My daughter does the same thing.    This biggest thing is that you don't pick him up and you don't say anything to him. It is described as an adult who sleep walks.  It is more than likely your child is not completely with it at the time and talking to him and picking him up only startles him more.    It is also said the main reason a baby gets night tremors is because they didn't get enough sleep during the day. You may have noticed this happening with him on a day that one of his naps got cut short or he stayed up a little longer before bed.    Here is an awesome website that really helped me!  http://www.babycenter.com/0_night-terror...|`|2SxBqNd2aa	I don't know if he is able to have night terrors or not, but he may just be scared when he awakes and does not see you. It would help to know if he sleeps through the night regularly, or if he wakes up all the time. I would try to monitor what he sees on the TV. A scary movie that he is not watching could still cause a nightmare.
niIKxoI5aa	No wonder you're sad.  You're dissapointed.  Ask your mom to sit with you and just listen, without judging.  She may feel guilty.  But this is no one's fault.  If you keep on feeling sad,  ask your mom to have your doctor evaluate you for depression.   Sadness is normal. Depression is not.  If people tell you to just "buck  up" they're probably pretty sad themselves.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Be thankful, for what you have.|`|uV2ql06Oaa	maybe you're ready for something new and the idea that you missed out on something fresh and exciting disappoints you... no worries (: you'll have plenty of opportunities to try out new things (:
cEXzXkqnaa	If you have had unprotected sex, then yes, there is a chance you could be prego...   DON"T have unprotected sex, and then you wouldn't be so worried all the time...|`|p0prrzf2aa	you could be. take a test to find out|`|WC4XTU4Daa	Stress and change in patterns (eating, sleeping, etc) can mess up your period. If you're freaking out, though, go to a planned parenthood or equivalent. They'll give you a pregnancy test totally confidentially. It happened to me when I was about 14. They just... changed. Nothing to necessarily freak out about, though.|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	I am not being ruede but instead of going on yahoo answers get you're butt to the doctor and see if you're pregnant!

Some women usually bleed lightly a month after their last period.  It's from the egg planting it self onto the side of the uterus.  Sometimes it's confused for their period.  This happened to me too and next thing you know I was already 2 1/2 months pregnant!   The only way to know for sure is to take a pregnancy test & remember to use your first pee of the day!  Good Luck!|`|cpjPt2Zeaa	pregnacnt test  or talk to ur doctor|`|C7frzO9Jaa	it's probably in your head. it's happened to me, it's called a phantom pregnancy. what you should do is eat a lot of junk food and work out a lot to induce your actual menstrual cycle. if you tell yourself it will come, it will come.    hope i helped =)|`|C4Z1vBkmaa	It is entirely possible, the best way to determine is a pregnancy test.

Love,  Chelsie|`|CRVi3YsOaa	my mother in law had two sets of twins back to back and her daughter had two sets of twins back to back. For some reason she thinks that I am going to have twins and I am TTC (if not already pg, but it's too early to tell) But i would say that you have a high chance of twins again, since yours were paternal twins then you over-ovulate and that gives you a high chance.
u0mZAPuDaa	I am in Knoxville, Tennessee.    It is about 10:50p here and my daughter Adalyn has been asleep for about a half of an hour.    I took the last 20 minutes to frost some cupcakes I made!|`|bd023cea955952a6366f0a9965ea13caaa	Lucky :) My almost four month old is still wide awake and not showing signs of sleeping any time soon!

It's just after 7 a.m.
NglVonEUaa	Well, contrary to what other posters are saying, I think your daughter has a beautiful name. And I like the name Kadence for a girl! It doesn't look trashy at all the way you spelled it. That being said....    My husband and I decided on the first name for our children just based on what we both liked. We honestly didn't totally decide until they were born, except for with our youngest daughter.     For my son, we had the names narrowed down to Grant, Drew and Dean. The middle name was to be Washington, after my great grandfather. When he was born, he just looked like a Grant. So Grant Washington was his name. We did that for our other son and for our first daughter too. Then with our youngest daughter, we used a name that had been a "runner up" for our first daughter's name. We both really liked Alaina, so that is what we started calling her when I was pregnant, as soon as we found out she was a girl. It would have been weird to call her anything else when she was actually here....lol.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Aisling is gorgeous. You ruined it with the masculine boy's name Cadence though, and a trashy spelling.    When I have children, the first name and first middle will be names I like. The second middle will be a family name of some sort.      [Edit] I fail to see how a K over a C makes it "feminine" when it clearly is masculine.|`|vwxmsUa2aa	We both wrote a list of boys names and a list of girls names we liked.     Then we took each others list and put a tick next to the names we liked, and a cross next to the names we definitely didn't like.    We both wanted Elizabeth as the girl's middle name as Elizabeth was my grandmother's name and Eliza is his mother's name.    We then played around to see which ones sounds good together.  We came up with:  Claire Elizabeth  James Noah|`|1H2sTpyKaa	Well, I'm not quite married yet, but I do love discussing names with my boyfriend.     We both came up with a list, and would rate each other's names... We could only give them a 1, 2, or 3. So the names that got a 1 were crossed off of our master list. The names with 2 were left for back-up consideration /or possible middle names. But we mostly considered the ones that we gave 3's to.     It worked good enough... but we don't exactly love each other's taste in names. So we've yet to find the "perfect" one, I think. But we'll keep looking. :)    Edit -- Haha, since when is Cadence masculine? Cadence (on every possible baby names website...every legit one, that is) isn't even considered unisex. It's full-blown feminine. And I happen to love the spelling "Kadence".     Also, her question was not if you liked the name or not. No, she was giving her example, and asking how you chose your names. I think Aisling Kadence is beautiful, and the baby is much more important than the name, anyway. All that matters is that she's loved and cared for, which she obviously is.|`|xJhwWJdmaa	We named our daughter Renee Nichole^^. We decided by writing down a list of names. Then we looked at each others lists and crossed off the ones we didn't like. Renee was the only name that was on both of our lists and it was both of our top names. Then Nichole is my mothers name. So Renee Nichole was perfect! Now for the quints. I think it's going to be a bit tougher. Haha. I really like Aisling Kadence by the way!|`|bmYvQveOaa	I am sorry but I just have to comment to bunny. Are you dumb or can you just not read? Kadence and Cadence are girl names like Candice. Kayden and Cayden are more of boy names.     My husband and I choice names based on many different factors. Heritage, family, and just names we heard and liked. The names we have picked are Gunnar Williem Kingsly Hien for a boy and Danikah Tyeler Mearie Hien.    Oh and I had a question how is Aisling pronounced. The name looks beautiful but I want to make sure I am pronouncing it right.|`|Oh75DqReaa	im only seventeen but we were fooling around and thought of baby names    i always loved my middle name rachalle [ra shell]  ans he likes it too  and one of his frineds/exes last name was chanel  so the girl will be rachalle chenel(:    and he was obsessed with the the band aiden   and it was a rly cool odd name   and i want my frined that died part of his name in there  witch is andrew  so aiden andrew(:    i wanted aiden michael   cuz its my bfs middle name but he doesnt like it lol      i see you chose aiden also(:|`|S5DxnCL4aa	Lol that's cute:] I don't have kids yet!    Why are you guys sharing your opinion on Aisling Kadence? She didn't even ask for it...=P|`|Elxuvon8aa	our youngest did not have a name until she was 5 days old.  the name we chose did not fit she was little and Elizabeth just did not fit her we kept the anne made it Anna for a first name and started looking in the baby name book I found Colleen it means girl  so we had our gracie girl|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Well daddy left it all up to me to do the naming so I combined both our names together & came up with her name|`|Qlx1r9XSaa	The first names were names we both liked and the middle names were family names.|`|SfwLF8j2aa	With our now 5 year old son it is kind of a funny story.We went out and got a baby book of thousands of names.When we got home we started to look at the book and on the cover it said "Beyond Jennifer and Jason" We both looked at each other and we knew...Jason was it lol We completely wasted our money! We ended up spelling it Jayson.His middle name is Leigh after his daddy:)|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	My hubby and I are TTC and already discussing baby names. I've had a little girl's name picked out for years that is very important to me; Julia Grace. Thankfully, my husband likes it okay, too. We were throwing around boy's names the other day and I said, "Malachi" and he said "Yes, that's the one". So if we have a boy his first name will definitely be Malachi. One of those you both just immediately know it's the right one.
aJLx0nhNaa	It does sound like he's depressed.  It doesn't excuse his behavior, but it does explain it.  Honestly, he'd probably feel a lot better about himself and the world if he was doing something.  Maybe you should give him a project?  Maybe not, right off the bat, something like get up with the kids.  But something to get his energy up again.  I don't know, when my husband gets stressy I usually suggest that he reorganize all the kitchen cabinets or something.  6 hours later, he's usually in a much better mood.  Obviously that's a short term solution, but maybe it would jump start his motivation.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Mine does the best he can. I'm a SAHM and he works 50+ hour weeks. During the week I pretty much have baby duty. I can deal with that though because he brings home the bacon and needs to be well rested for work. On the weekends though he gets up with the baby and lets me get some extra sleep.    You need to say something to your hubby. He isn't being fair to you at all. You have every right to be angry and frustrated with him. Do you think he may need to see a doctor? He's either really lazy or dealing with a real depression.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	Being justifyingly mad! My bf figures because he goes to work all day long and pays the rent that when he comes home he should have a clean house cooked meal and then vegitate on the computer...I have to ask him to watch her when I haven't taken a shower in 5 days! The sad thing is I am on maternity leave from work so I am getting money in, not much but it's better then nothing but he claims that he pays for everything when in turn when I get paid his money is his and my money is his or my whole pay goes on a bill...I have to beg for money for formula. He has taken up drinking a lot more now too it's driving me up the wall!! and then he comes out and complains about something or other    so nope you're not alone!|`|BY02DhfWaa	i can understand where your coming from ,and i can understand his point, but i have to say that is just plain laziness . he could get off his butt and help a little even if it is a couple hrs a day when mine was laid off he spent time with our boys now that he is back to work he misses them tell him how you feel talk to him dont yell i know you are frustrated but you need to talk .|`|47eiwyMLaa	I can see why you're mad. But I can also see a husband that needs some TLC like your kids do. He needs his best friend (you) to be understanding and to help him build up his self esteem. If you can put in that extra effort for him, he should reciprocate by helping you. Just encourage him to talk about how he really feels, compliment him on what he does right, and ask how you can help him. I know this sounds counter-intuitive to focus on him when you're feeling the stress. But helping him will help you in the long run :)|`|0cc5b5bbc5737c639788c13b8ae7e80daa	haha sorry not that its funny but you might as well get used to it thats just a man for ya... Good luck finding one that will help you for long......|`|DwTrJ9GTaa	your right hopefull hes looking for a job tell he finds one ask ( dont tell hell get but hurt) that you need him to help you make him feel needed sounds lame but its worked for me say i need your help|`|BMfn0D9gaa	oh dear, i know EXACTLY how you feel, i mean exactly!!  my husband thinks that since he works that i am supposted to have FULL responsibility of our daughter, day AND night!  i didn't make her all on my own, lol!  I love my daughter to pieces but a little free time would be nice|`|MtKqi5VBaa	My "husband" was no help. He worked and threw it in my face constantly, telling me I'm useless and I don't do anything. He worked and spent everything on weed. Then he left. I've never been happier.   So to answer your question of how much the partner helps with baby? Not at all. I'm sorry this is happening to you. It's the worst.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	my hub helps more than he probably should bc i am a sahm, but he insists...so i let him, does no good to argue with him|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	No, your completely right being mad!!  I'm not in that situation, cause I'm not even with my baby's daddy.  He didn't want to stop using drugs so I told him to take a hike!    Who ever's not getting up with him at night, should be getting up in the am with him.  Depression or not, what happens if you get depressed, then no onegetss up with him?  I know if I get depressed I still have to get up with my daughter!!!
mpGjPV6Xaa	Troy Jenkins|`|Elxuvon8aa	I do not think either is a manly name  I think Richard thomas James are all tougher|`|JYVuP6C5aa	Troy, i actually kinda love that name :)|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	Troy Jenkins|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Troy|`|bT4npA7Jaa	How about a cross between the two? Like Trey or Trevyn? I like those a bit better, and they aren't as common.|`|nzgZR6onaa	I always liked the name Trevor it reminds me of a cool cowboy type manly and handsome yet tuff!|`|Qlx1r9XSaa	I love the name Trevor!

I think Trevor definitely.  Trevor sounds like a strong guy but sweet and nice at the same time.  Troy is a bit too macho, in a stereotypical-bloodshed-violence-beefy way lol.

fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	Yes. We had been engaged but decided to get married sooner since the baby was coming. We got married January 26, 2008 and our son came February 4, 2008. I did it right, and I want my kids to do it right. I believe that people should be married before they have kids but I'm not here to judge anyone. Good luck|`|bO1gUExAaa	I was 8 weeks pregnant when I got married.|`|f1be279c2aa0afc42bfadf0346f18093aa	yes it was the wrong decision .if he hasn't asked 2 marry u till now, what makes u think it will b better with a piece of paper.|`|NAzAmFDnaa	My husband and I were living together before we got engaged.  He proposed on Christmas day and we found out 2 days later that we were pregnant!  We were kind of trying, but not trying hard because we thought it would take 8mon or so to get pregnant.  Well, it didn't take that long at all.  I was 5mon at the wedding, but wasn't showing yet.  I was a tiny bit sad about not being a "pure" bride, but on the other hand, this is a 2nd marraige for both of us and our baby has infused both our families with new energy and love.|`|FXPTeTcPaa	My fiance's cousin's wife was about 7 months pregnant when she got married. She looked very beautiful. Her dress was specially made to fit her expanding figure. It also came apart (shorter skirt) so she could be more comfortable for the reception as it was incredibly hot. She was going to wait, but her father was flying down for Christmas and she wanted to have him included in the wedding so she bumped it up.     She looked very beautiful, but unfortunately her ring did not fit her so she wore her engagement ring on her pinky finger until after she had the baby before sliding it on her ring finger alongside the wedding band.|`|gJlxZdL5aa	No but we had a scare back when we were engaged....but just a scare.    Honestly I'm glad we are married before I get pregnant.    I would hate for my kid to think the only reason Mommy and Daddy are together is because of him.    You know.    Anyways.  Good luck and if I were you I would go ahead and get married I mean if you've been together 10 years your technically commonlaw but make it real|`|uCnmYEPBaa	I was 6 months pregnant when I married my now ex.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I was 9 weeks pregnant when i got married.

But I agree I do like the fact I was married first, so if my daughter comes up to me one day and says well you had a baby with dad and you guys weren't married I wouldn't go uuuuuhhhhh. And put my foot in my mouth, lol but hey i wouldn't worry about it, alot of people these days think its a great thing to have kids before marriage , but whatever floats your boat.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Yes I married while about 12 weeks or so. We were engaged, but we found out I was pregnant wanted to be married before the baby came.

It has Vitamin C which boosts you and baby's immune system and it has folic acid which is important to fight any kind of defects.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	It's perfectly fine as long as the store bought juice is pasteurized.

The only time it can be bad is if you have really bad heartburn...  other than that, it's fine!|`|LWvh2g2maa	No it's not bad at all.  It may give you heartburn in the later stages of pregnancy so carry around some tums.|`|G94NlpZ0aa	You're fine. :)  I looooved orange juice during my first trimester.

FrLDHBLfaa	If that name holds significant meaning for you, he could always be Ajax on his birth certificate and A.J. or Jack to everyone else.|`|sW4N20cTaa	Kids can be cruel, I wouldn't go for anything that automatically singles him out. What about Jax? You still get the Greek feel with out him having to pronounce his name to EVERYONE for all time.|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Yes. It is a cleaning product. That's like saying I should go and name my daughter Janola. Perhaps Jaxon would be better?|`|oJ9NpqALaa	yes you will.  what about Izaac?

Hey quick question Do you have splotchyred and white hands, i do  just wondering if it's a preg symptom? I test the 11th! God bless and Baby Dust!!!!  Salina|`|C4Z1vBkmaa	It sure sounds promising...I would definitely take a pregnancy test...there are tests that you can take up to 5 days before your missed period...good luck!
VvJ1Zxozaa	I think that is normal, one of my friends had a baby boy who teeth upper teeth first. And yes I have heard stories behind it but I think it is far from truth,relax.|`|8NO8f2ffaa	what are you talking about?! baby teeth upper teeth first?! what?!
8ifHo5F3aa	you just comfort her be there get her favorite movies at blockbuster etc.....so she can get her mind of the pregnancy....  I wish my bf was around and worried about me>    Congrats!|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Ask her doctor if it's ok to see a chiropractor. She does need to do the bed rest unless the doctor says it's ok not to, but those people work miracles and you are much less likely to have back labor if you see a chiropractor, which seems to be what is threatening to happen with her. It alligns your pelvis and makes labor easier. Tell her to stay off her back to, and lay on her side with a pillow in betweeen her legs. No recliners!!! It will keep the baby from digging into her back. It's not the end of the world to be on bed rest, just tell her to remember that it is for the baby.|`|y5Ggaxf5aa	Tell her it's for the sake of the baby. If she truly cared about it she would listen to the doctor.|`|yipMDefBaa	Tell her that it is not for long and is best for the baby.  I presume there are other reason then back pain and pressure to put her on bed rest.  Do everything you can to make her comfortable.  Help her start or restart a old hobby she can do in bed.  If you have to work then get friends and relative to come over and keep her entertained.    She is probably scared more then upset by the bed rest order.  Just comfort her and tell her its going to be o.k and tha you will be there all the way through it and for the next 50 years.|`|YspTfI8Faa	tell her that when shes stressed out, which can be caused by pain, itsnt good for the baby, cause if shes stressed the baby can feel it....just say you care about her and the baby and she should listen to the doctor...Good Luck!!|`|AOfm8ey6aa	If she is already 36 weeks pregnant she has 1 more week to go. Babies born at 37 weeks of pregnancy are considered full term.|`|uOp2sdiQaa	2-3 weeks will go by fast, and its in the best interest for your unborn child=]|`|bJ0rUlqdaa	just tell her you'll be there for her and whatever she needs you'll get it and that it is best for the baby and that you know she loves the baby and she would do anything for him/her and this is one of those times tell her that you love her and that you want her to be happy and healthy and that you'll be by her side.it'll make her happy that your there for her and then maybe she wont be so scared.make sure that she has everything that she needs to keep her occupied it might be a rough couple last weeks but if you work together you can do it.good-luck and god-bless your family
vgR6i2t1aa	Well if when you had sex you were unprotected and let the guy ejaculate inside you while you were ovulating, it is a great possibility that you are pregnant.  Even if you are underweight, if you have periods now, you are capable of getting pregnant.  Although, your body takes two weeks after the fertilization of the egg for your hormones to start changing, so you probably wouldn't be able to notice any real signs of pregnancy yet.  My urethra never tingled when i got pregnant, hopefully its not an std.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	You can still get pregnant if underweight.  Take a pregnancy test in another week.
drI1vsJdaa	Are you a girl or a guy? You might be done growing, but who knows? It depends on if you're a boy or a girl because boy's are supposed to weigh more.|`|A5mkPwIqaa	I'd check with your doctor on that one. They track your height and weight throughout your life and have charts that show typical growth, so they can predict how tall you will get and if you are in a good weight range.
tt3NqROGaa	You really do need to show your mum your report card if she asks for it. By this point, she's most likely already expecting bad grades, so she won't be shocked by it.     She may be angry, but maybe you can discuss options for helping to bring your grades up. With that many C's, you're obviously having some issues with school.     I'm a junior in high school and in all honors classes, so if you want to remain in these classes, you're going to have to get help with writing. It's almost impossible to do well in high school if you're lacking in writing skills.    I would discuss maybe going to a tutor with your mum, and just show her the report card. Good luck.    If you're really afraid of being hit, you should talk to someone about it. From what you said, it doesn't sound like you're being abused. But I know my mum used to hit me when I was misbehaving as a child and I've never been afraid of her...|`|2FhPfxnsaa	Makes me glad that my parents aren't strict! I'd just give it to her, it's better that way.|`|drI1vsJdaa	The longer you wait, the madder she'll be. I'd get it over with so you can stop dreading it and feeling guilty.|`|WtzKQVGXaa	well your gonna have to give it to her sooner or later so you might as well give it to her but also discuss with her that you are working hard but still can't seem to get the grade up to where you want it. also don't decieve your parents by letting them think you are getting better grades than what you are because that is just gonna make it harder on you in the long run....    hold your chin up and talk to your parents

yCwPxulYaa	Too early for cereal.  You need to wait until at least 4 months (better 6) and at this time, cereal is not always needed.  My 5 month old still eats every 2 hours.  This is normal for babies.  Giving him cereal will upset his little tummy, and probably make him fussy.  Try swaddling him and laying him on his side or back.  Sleeping on his stomach greatly increases his risk for SIDS.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Kindly tell your mother to butt out.    At one month it's very normal for your baby to eat every 1-3 hours. The milk IS holding him, his stomach is just very small(about the size of his fist) so he gets hungry faster than you or I would. His digestive system also isn't ready for solids and won't be until around 6 months. Even then, it shouldn't be put into his bottle but fed to him with a spoon. Just do a simple google search and you'll find your mother's advice concerning this issue is very outdated.    As far as putting him on his belly it's not a good idea for sleeping. Naptime, as long as he's in your view, is fine and so is tummy time. But for sleeping he needs to be on his back to help decrease the chances of SIDS. Once he starts rolling over consistently then he can sleep on his belly.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I strongly suggest that you ignore your mother on these issues.  You're the mom now and it sounds like you know what you're doing.  It's tough.  But tell your mom that you're the mom now and she doesn't get to say what happens.    Do not put cereal in his formula.  At a month old, eating 4 ounces every 2 hours is perfectly normal.  Putting cereal in his bottle will not make him sleep more, and there's a danger that it might make him choke.    Put him down to sleep on his back.  If he's fussy, swaddle him.  Trust your own judgment here, you have the right instincts!|`|qyObFvz6aa	You need to increase the amount you give him per feeding Try 5 oz, it should hold him a bit longer. I would wait for the cereal.|`|rjVALevtaa	Tell your mother that her information is way outdated. Since the putting baby to sleep on their backs campaign in 1992, the SIDs rates have gone down by 40%!     Eating every 2 hours or so is completely normal. My youngest is 5 months old and he eats every 2 1/2 to 3 hours and he does eat cereal.     Your son is much too young for cereal. Just tell your mother that this is your baby and you're going to do things by the book.|`|SeAvCGlYaa	Maybe the little guy is just going through a growth spurt and NEEDS to eat every 2 hours... if you try to cut back, you may deprive him of much needed fats, calories, and nutrients that his little body is obviously craving right now. Just hang in there, Mommy, and soon enough, he won't be chowing down so often.     As far as sleeping on his tummy, it sounds like you might have given in to your mom's advice and spoiled him to sleeping on his stomach, which is not a good thing. He could smother, it increases risk of SIDS, and is, in general, just not safe. Please be patient with him, try swaddling him and things like that. Try putting him to sleep, then gently laying him down on his back. He may wake up several times and have to be put back to sleep, then laid down again, but eventually, he will get the message.    Good luck.|`|x5SJDvIraa	Your son is too young for cereal. If he is eating every 2 hrs, and only eats 4 oz or less, try giving him more. His little tummy just isn't ready for it. You can try using the baby rice that it made to be put in the formula. It helped sometimes in filling up my son when he was little.     The tummy sleeping thing is best to be talked about with your doctor, because every baby is different. Some babies are fine on there tummy. Some aren't.|`|MO2H26XOaa	i have a 6 week old baby girl, and i gave her a little bit of cereal into her formula. Its true they sleep better and it fills them up, but it got her really constipated and she didn't poop for 4 days. We had to give her karo syrup in her formula as a "laxative" and she is just now getting her bowels back in order. and we gave it to her about 2 weeks ago...honestly, to avoid discomfort, check the doctor. You may just have to give your son more formula at a time..try 6 oz. and im still learning about the whole tummy time so i cant help you there.. good luck!|`|0iGPAUBCaa	4 months I think is when you can start giving him cereal.He's too small! It doesn't matter that he eats every 2 hours, that's normal.|`|ZQLSXUnXaa	The latest research says to wait until around 6 months to start your baby on solids...many docs and books will tell you 4-6 months is okay, but one month old is too early...  As for him eating every 2 hours or less, that is completely normal. Babies' stomachs are tiny and breastmilk is easily absorbed so they eat very frequently. Don't sweat it you are doing great! Listen to your instincts as a mother. You probably know what is best for your baby. You will always get unsolicited gratuitous advice (from mothers, sisters, strangers, and here--even me haha!)|`|DwTrJ9GTaa	still to soon all mom say that mine did i would wait tell hes 4 month oldyou will have to tech him to sleep on his bach it well take time|`|uFjvl4JSaa	you should never give a baby cereal in a bottle and he does not need anything but formula or breastmilk until be is 4-6 months it's not a good idea!     "Like many Tribune readers, I look for and enjoy the lively and interesting discussions of health typically found in Julie Deardorff's blog, "Julie's Health Club."    However, as commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, I absolutely must challenge her implication that putting babies to sleep on their stomachs may actually be better than on their backs.    As Deardorff acknowledges, the statistics are well known and crystal clear. Since the launch of the national "Back to Sleep" campaign in 1994, rates of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in the U.S. -- as well as in Chicago -- have decreased by more than 50 percent, the equivalent of saving the lives of more than 3,500 babies each year.    Given that, how could she, a person in a position of journalistic responsibility -- and a mother, as well -- even consider advising a young mother to put her baby to sleep on the baby's stomach?    I disagree with Deardorff's reasoning that because sleeping on the stomach is, like cigarette smoke, a risk factor, not necessarily the cause, of SIDS, that stomach sleeping is acceptable.    That same flawed logic could be used to justify smoking around a baby, and in fact has by advocacy groups funded by the tobacco industry.    I have to say I was further astounded and disappointed when Deardorff implied that it is acceptable for a mother of an infant to ignore sound, proven medical advice in favor of folk, anecdotal advice from a mother or grandmother.    With all due respect, I encourage Deardorff to reconsider her position, and I urge all mothers, fathers and others who care for infants to put babies to sleep on their backs.    All of us should work together to prevent SIDS and promote healthier babies; and anyone who needs to know why should visit the Sudden Infant Death Services of Illinois Web site, click on "Family Memorials" and see the very human face of this public health issue|`|4tmHcIYlaa	Are you breast feeding your baby?  A baby doesn't need cereal until 4-6 months of age. These are guidelines that are from the American Academy of Paediatrics. A baby can have some tummy time for a few mins every day. A baby should sleep on his back as the Academy reccomends this incase of SIDs. (Sudden infant death). Babies like to be swaddled as it feels like being in the womb. Wrap him up tightly and try putting him down for a nap.Good Luck
ABOvm38Caa	Everyone has a small amount of protein and glucose in their urine, but when it is elevated it could be a sign of a bladder or kidney infection and when you become further along in your pregnancy, it can be a sign of preeclampsia.  They most likely sent your urine for a complete urinalysis which is a "UA" to see what might be going on.  Good luck to you.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Yeah I agree with the first answer.  You can get protein in your urine when you are under hydrated.  Make sure you are drinking enough water.  AU is believe stands for something like Aubum Urinary Excretion which is urine testing.  They will most probably test you for gestational diabetes as well.|`|jX5ooZdnaa	At times Protein can simply mean that you recently have eaten OR just that you need to hydrate more. Protein is always accompanied by an elevated blood sugar.
7MKmxkjlaa	um. my dad bugs me about my jeans being too tight ... but there the only jeans i own ... so yeah. im sure once i pull out the new pair of jean shorts i have for the summer hes gonna says something.....|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	When I was still in high school and living at home, I wasn't nagged a lot by my father, but I was by his wife. She kept on saying how my hair was too long, too wavy, how I study too much and I need to get a boyfriend so that I could marry him when I'm twenty (I'll still be in university then), etc...let's just say that she wasn't the greatest person in the world.     But yes, it's normal for parents to nag you about these things. They are just concerned about you.|`|RdatK8wlaa	No, my mom's cool.     Dad, on the other hand....|`|k9VvIG3gaa	No..because i dont wear tight jeans..or revealing clothing...|`|qRElKKjXaa	Rarely. I don't think jeans that are too tight are flattering, and I am super super skinny so it would be hard to find a pair that is tight anyway.    Only once did my dad want me to change, and that's when I was wearing really really REALLY short shorts.|`|VyuseWb2aa	My mom's cool with it, but when it comes to stepdad, well, not so cool...|`|tnhF5Gaiaa	My mom doesn't care, we share clothes all the time. But when ever I see my dad, which isn't very often, he always makes some comment on how I look like a **** and I need to change, he isn't nice about it he just says 'honey you look like a ****, do you really want guys to be staring at your ti.ts (or what ever body part is showing) all day long, you should change, I don't want my daughter looking like a ****' and people wonder why I don't get along with my dad, I see him for only a week every 4 months and this is normally one of the first things he says to me.|`|uV2ql06Oaa	my parents don't...I mean occasionally they'll be like "what are you wearing???" but usually...no|`|7qVv4Qi4aa	naw. i wear real short mini skirts and tube tops and all that stuff. but only when it is the appropriate. like beach or vacation you know.|`|drI1vsJdaa	Nah, I wear tight jeans because they look good.

Like pull your pants up, find another shirt, go put on some clothes, those are too small, that's too tight, who clothes do you have on,or  where are you going dressed like that.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	No.  The only time my mom ever nagged was when I'd try to wear a skirt out that showed my buttcheeks.|`|AmqQ9it5aa	My mom won't buy me clothes.

VVV7DSITaa	They don't need extra water. Babies are very susceptible to water intoxication. They get all they need from juice, breast milk or formula, and even the food they eat. If you use powdered formula and choose to put an extra half-ounce or so in the bottles to mix with the powdered formula since the whole "unpacked level scoop" thing can be varying, that's one thing, but they don't need full cups or bottles of water.    If your baby gets constipated, give some baby apple juice. It'll loosen your baby right up, and at 4 months, they're old enough to have juice.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	It helps constipation!  But you shouldn't be giving a baby that young water for no reason.  Their kidneys can't handle it, they can get very sick, and even die!|`|pwu9xzF8aa	no- water will only help constipation!!|`|MO2H26XOaa	no. i give my 6 week old baby water for hiccups. water actually helps with constipation. its perfectly fine for it!|`|BY02DhfWaa	no put a little sugar in it it keeps them fuller longer and keeps them going regular it is really good for them . thats what i had to give my son when he was a baby because he wanted to eat all the time and i could not feed him 24-7 so i had to fill in with the water on a regular basis .|`|3klIx1Egaa	no it helps with constipation. Just remember tho, if they are formula fed, they do get quiet a bit of water through there feedings, and excess water shouldnt be used because it can cause water intoxication and can be really fatal until 6 months of age. so an ounce or so a day is fine, any more and i would avoid it.|`|e63078da611dd632e9be5b8ddb768a5aaa	Not at all. Water can actually make it easier to go poop.

Cl4AfJPcaa	i nice warm bath or a hot compress with so IB profin works best. Takes the cramps away immediatly while your waiting for the IB profin to kick in. Ive always had really bad cramps to the point of crying so try it out and see how it works for you. theres nothing you need to avoid during a period. I would use pads if you dont jsut for the fact that it gets it out of your body instead of keepin it in which a tampon does.|`|Yg2iIneKaa	Medication|`|Bw18seFqaa	take some tylenol or motrin.. go lay down with a heating pad, or soak in the tub for abit.      avoid foods like caffiene, salty, fried, chocolate, etc ..  junk food in general, for the week before and during your period.  Drink more fluids..  keeping hydrated helps some.    Keeping active may also help relieve the cramping.      I would also reccomend you look into getting on a low-dose birth control, such as ortho-lo.  It makes a BIG difference in cramps!    I suffered for years with bad menstrual cramps.. I wish I would have known about using birth control to help control the cramping when I was a teen, I would have asked my mom about it.|`|2xWOBkYEaa	Im on my period ATM and I hae terribe cramps aswell.

wBpennsMaa	There is a chance you could be pregnant as there is anytime you have sex, even if it is protected. Go buy some condoms so you have them when you are in that situation. If you are old enough to be having sex you are old enough to be buying condoms. Condoms will prevent you from getting STDs. You don't have to be grubby to get an STD. Also, either ask your gaurdian to take you to a gynecologist to get on birth control or go to planned parenthood and ask them for it as they can give it to you for free (they ask for a donation) and its confidential. You don't want to end up pregnant as a teenager as the health risks are higher and you want to be financially stable.|`|5T9VSJbEaa	Im going to be honest, The chances that you are pregnant are relatively high. You could be shivering because you are nervous. Are you ovulating right now? (You know your ovulating when your vaginal mucous is clear and egg-white like, it appears more often in the morning and is a clear indicator of your body being fertile.)     The only way to prevent the actual pregnancy is to take the "Morning After pill" but it comes with alot of risks.    Just relax, everything will be okay. And if everything turns out to be okay, just be a little careful next time.     god bless|`|7kGwZ1Ntaa	Next time I suggest protection, not a lecture just a suggestion. You could use the 'morning after pill', or you could simply wait a bit for your period to show, and if it doesn't, take a pregnancy test. The pull out method isn't 100 percent, even contraceptives are 100 percent so the pull out method might only be like 40 percent. Next time you have sex, either use a condom or be prepared to be a mother. Good luck.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	understood.  there are no real symptoms of losing your virginity.  you would normally have some light bleeding the next days and some sore inner thighs, from the work.    (small lecture never have sex with a guy without a condom)   ^ because he didn't use a condom, there is a chance that pre-*** got in you, this contains sperm.  that right there is enough to cause pregnancy.    HOWEVER, you are clearly very nervous and it sounds like you might be a little upset with yourself.  you may be making yourself sick over this and that wont help you.  it will only make things worse, like a delayed period.    if you are pregnant, you wont get your period(most likely wont that is), your nipples will become sore, you'll start to have morning sickness which involves throwing up.    you can go to planned parenthood if you had sex just a day ago and get the plan B pill to help prevent possible pregnancy.    you could be pregnant, and it's really scary, i understand that.  you just need to try to stay calm and not make yourself sick over this, you need to think about what happened and learn from it, things will work out alright.  hopefully you aren't pregnant, honestly i doubt you are, but there is always that chance... you are going to have to go somewhere like planned parenthood to find out and figure out what your next step from there is.  everything will be okay though.    just calm down, step back and take a few deep breaths.  you will be okay.
U3jS5k9eaa	Hi. Yes it is possible you could be pregnant. I was on the contraceptive pill for 11 years and got pregnant after just one month. I am unsure of the red circle but tender breasts are normally one of the first signs of pregnancy.|`|zoyw8CRKaa	I fell pregnant withing the first month (a month of naivety) the pull out method is not  a good form of contraception pre *** can still get you pregnant.    You could be pregnant i would take a test and if that's neg wait 2 days to do another if your period does not arrive then go to the Dr and get a blood test done.    It could also be down to you coming off the pill just because 1st time round it came back ok and smoothly doesn't mean 2nd time round it will.    The only way to know for sure is take a test, 1st response or clearblue digital i recommend.    Good luck. xx|`|m0PVHJIvaa	You could be pregnant or it could be that you stopped taking birth control and thats causing side effects. Take a pregnancy test, or go to the doctor to make sure.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	yes you very well could be, people are often very fertile after stopping b/c|`|eU5Eth2aaa	The pull out method doesn't always work.    Your hormones could just be out of whack since you have just come off the pill.  Take a pregnancy test if you miss your period, just to be safe!    Good luck!|`|8IIVBPwkaa	Yes, you could be pregnant. Getting your partner to pull out is not a reliable form of birth control as some sperm can come out before he ejaculates. I am surprised your doctor did not discuss with you alternatives to the pill when you stopped taking it. My advice would be to see a doctor or do a home test asap to find out whether you are pregnant or not.     Good luck!
an8O7r4kaa	im 22 and i was adopted. i know i can find out now since im older then 21 and have thought about it. now i want to more then ever cause she was 22 when she gave me away and im 22 and pregnant. i have thought about what i would say to her over and over again, even thought maybe she could help me cause i was pregnant. Im telling you all this because i believe each case is different, i haven't found mine even though i can cause of how nervous i am about it. yes theres all those questions of, maybe she wont wanna see more, or what if she doesn't like me. they will all run through your head, but look at it this way. i am willing to bet on the fact that she gave you up wanting you to have a better life, so a part of her must love you, and what you first say wont matter. you need to also consider the fact that she might be shocked. you arnt supposed to be able to get those records till your 21 so it might be to soon for her, to hard for her to see you yet. there are also legal issues with it, what if she sees you and wants you back, your legally still a child. there are a lot of you need to think about other than what will she think of me. my advice to you honestly wait until ur at least 18 before you contact her. best of luck to you with whatever your decision is.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Tell her that you're glad she gave you a chance.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Tell her thanks for bring me into this world|`|Z0KQenm9aa	good for you. Its not a stupid question. examine why you want to find them... this may help you think of what you would say. do you know why they are not with you? youd probably want to know that... i hope your happy with the people you currently live with... pray|`|EJm0Oqc1aa	My sister was adopted and I wish I could find her Im 18 and I think she is 15 now.But I always wonder how much it would effect her life if she didn't know and I jsut showed up I don't know how it would be on her,it confuses me also.If you would like to talk some more just email me,I would love to have some more convo about this
l4mMBe5Aaa	I used to be against them, but our daughter was completely bald when she was born (ok, she's 14 months old now, and is STILL bald!), and sometimes she needs a little something to make her look less like a little boy in a dress!  Plus, less people ask "How old is he?" if she's wearing a headband!|`|B5MDTdtPaa	cute  i think theyre the cherry on top of any outfit,  plus it show the babys gender as so many babies get mistaken for the other gender and yeah if they havnt got hair it gives a nice addition to there heads  http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u198/...|`|2JRuhNyWaa	Lol my daughter looked like Mr Miagi(sp) from karate kid for a few weeks, so i get what you are saying. I think they are cute, but i don't use them much because of the mark they leave on her head. She is also a bald baby! Any suggestions as to a brand that doesn't do that?|`|C0GeEv7kaa	My daughter doesn't like anything on her head so she refuses to wear them, LOL. I have to fight to get her to even wear a hat! The only time I was able to keep a headband on her was when we took family pictures.|`|z2m9p1qdaa	SO, NOT EVERYONE WAS GRANTED A THIN BODY BY GOD LIKE YOU AND OTHER PEOPLE.  WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST IT HUH?|`|qgV7714laa	they are cute for all babies, but you are right!  when ur baby is bald, this does help you stop answering all the dumb questions, "is it a boy or a girl?"  Keep the head bands, she will appreciate you for it when she gets old enough to look back at pictures|`|3lV7ZY3raa	umm, considering that babies are the most beautiful things in the world, to say your child looks like a fat bald little old man. is just wrong.|`|2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	My daughter had lots of hair when she was born and I still put headbands on her.  I don't see what it hurts, so I don't have a problem using them.|`|jDjwb8seaa	don't like'em. never have.. never used them on my daughter when she was a baby.|`|IWinNj2saa	I personally hate them. But it's really a choice. If you like them, stick with em.|`|1dueLOdvaa	I don't think there is a need.     And a lot of the time they are too tight and leave marks around the babies head. It must be so uncomfortable for the baby.|`|ROJans2Taa	I never used them on my daughter, on some babies it looks cute if they have some hair, or if they look like a boy and you want people to know it's a girl, it does remind me of 1980's for some reason though, not sure why|`|62vCoDPjaa	haha..well i think they are cute.
S6F5MYX2aa	My daughter was born with two different size ears, and so was my niece (now in all honors classes in h.s.)  My daughter's ears seem to look really different in size around 3 - 4 months old.  She is nine months old and they are still different in size, but not as different as when she was younger.  I, too, seem to be the only one that really notices.  I was given advice to tape one down, lay her on the side of the one that was larger.  I did none of these things.  If your son is reaching milestones at appropriate ages, I don't think you have anything to worry about.    I asked my niece if she is ever bothered or teased because one ear is larger than the other, and she said her friends said they thought it looked "cool."|`|mO2oOqZ3aa	Well for the last 3 months you have done nothing but just stare at your little one in awe! So of course you are going to notice the littlest things about him!!! I'm guessing that it's not noticeable to anyone but you, and if one is in fact smaller than the other, then i'm sure as he grows everything will even out. Don't worry!!|`|QY10Hmq7aa	Don't worry.. My fiance's ears are the same way.|`|aPSDksshaa	awwwwwww   i bet its so cute!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I'm sorry, I think that's adorable!  You need to realize that as a mom you are much, much more inclined to notice tiny details about your baby than anyone else every will be.  And he's still growing.    My husband was convinced and slightly mad with worry that our son had the *slightest* of lazy eyes at birth.  I didn't even notice it and of course, whatever it was worked itself out.      Even if they were different sizes, it would be merely a cosmetic deformity and one of life's minor ones.|`|tQw6EDspaa	My baby's ears are different. I'm sure if your doctor said it's fine, it's fine. Who says ears must be the same size. He probably looks cute.    Have you gotten his hearing checked by a specialist. Pediatrician's tend to know nothing about hearing or sight. You should get them checked by a specialist. Ask your doctor to refer you.|`|HU4Kmi5vaa	its totally normal...|`|GGBDkOuFaa	I bet one foot is bigger than the other too!    totally normal
mjlhZAVxaa	Either way there isn't much they can do.  For allergies you will need to get him checked out, but they will probably just suggest you do that at your next check up.  You can call them and see if you can get an appointment tho, and see what the pedi says.  My son has had 3 colds in the last 2 months, really annoying, but that is the weather here.|`|33h5R8nTaa	When babies are new they snezze and cough alot because there are new allergins in the air, my daughter sneezed alot when she was a new born and i was concerned but the doc said it was normal. since its winter i would go out and buy  little noses sailine spray and do it under her nose so it doesnt get dry or bloody like you mentioned. Its just allergies when babies get sick they get fevers also so unless she has a fever then she is fine.|`|875c75a0a8def8650809ee2b5e589957aa	Yes call the doctor....better safe than sorry!
J6vd8Gsbaa	She is trying to get to know you again. She does not remember you honestly. I applaud you for coming back into her life and I pray you stay there. Spend alot of time with her and she will get to know and trust you. It takes time so try not to get frustrated. She will know you as daddy. I will pray that you stay on the right track. Good luck and God bless|`|s1utniuvaa	She just needs to get to know you. She isn't used to you yet and she needs to adjust. Be consistent and keep spending time with her and eventually she will warm up to you.    Great job cleaning up and doing the right thing. I wish you lots of luck!|`|53QQ9KXEaa	I'm not going to pass judgment, but I'm glad that you've cleaned up and changed your ways. It'll be great for you daughter to have both her mommy and daddy around :)     Anyway, I don't think it's that it's due to abandonment issues, but rather her just not knowing you. Give it a while and all should be well.    Good luck.|`|9IFF0vIoaa	Rather than abandonment issues...this may be an attachment issue.  She doesn't like that you have just tried to 'take' her away from mom...even if mom isn't holding her when you approach.  She isn't aware of parental responsibilities.  So the fact that you are dad doesn't mean anything at this point.  My first child responded to family 'strangers (grandparents/aunts/uncles) just fine.  She would go to just about anyone within a few minutes of meeting them.  My second...willingly went to my mom (her grandma) for the first time last summer...she was about 10 months old.  And my mother and I are VERY close.  We see each other every few days...and live just FIVE houses apart.  So it's not like she was a real stranger.    Give it time.  Don't push it.  The harder you push her...the harder she will push back.|`|e3fa2fb97cbca43e2c3086607351d4caaa	she doesn't know you as sad as it is...u just like my children's father...if i was her mom i would tell you to go away and leave her alone since you walked out on her|`|8WRnqs08aa	Abandonment & attachment disorders can follow a baby through life. My Mom is raising my cousin's 12 year old daughter. She was abused & abandoned @ age 16 months. My Mom has had her ever since CPS removed the child from her grandmother (my Mom's sister) who had her because my aunt's daughter (the baby's mother) was 15 and locked up in a Youth Detention Program.    This 12 year old still suffers to this day, but with counseling and patience, it has gotten easier for my mother to manage the child's issues.    I'm proud of you for cleaning up and returning into your baby's life. Too many parents walk away and never come back. My 7 year old step son's mother is a homeless drug addict. She rarely calls or sees him & I reap the effects of his sadness. We are all human & we make mistakes. It's when we don't learn from them that they become habit. I pray that for my step son's sake, his mother can clean up & return to him and his 2 other siblings (who have different father's).    Best Wishes to your family & your continued sobriety!|`|MDGRFBoRaa	She's 11 months old, that's pretty typical behavior for that age. Most infants don't get out of the just wanting mommy stage for awhile unless they're just being passed from person to person.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	just continue on your course.  Take good care of you and your family. Y'all will have a wonderful relationship.
MDGRFBoRaa	Cervix is generally not a good indicator of pregnancy until about a week after your missed period at least. Take a pee test to get definitive answers.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Take a blood test at your doc.
JvZY0ZS4aa	Assuming you're having a boy, I'd definitely go with the green and gray.    The red stands out nicely and the black has a nice classy look and the green is unique. I love all of them actually. My choice for choosing the green/gray...? It hides stains and spills!    As a baby, you'll have blankets and things around the baby which would likely clash color wise with the red. After the first couple months of use, you start to care less about the look and more about the functionality of the stroller.     Spit up, leaky diapers, spilled juice, crushed crackers and mushed food items/sauces are more of a concern and how on earth you're going to get that stuff cleaned off. The last thing you want is to put your baby on anything close to white (a least if you're a practical mom trying to cut DOWN on your laundry).     So for looks AND practicality, I'd personally buy the green & gray one if I was able to. You are truly blessed to have a friend able to get this for you. It's an absolutely awesome stroller!|`|mJ0qetDFaa	i would go with the green or the black  i would say the black  its super cute! :)|`|FoY5fgVwaa	The green is really cute, but black might be more practical because it will stay cleaner longer!|`|Cl0r1dofaa	BLACK WOULD BE BEST. IT WORKS FOR A BOY OR GIRL IF YOU EVER DECIDED TO HAVE ANOTHER IN THE FUTURE|`|MwFN3DfPaa	I would go with the green one.  Not only is it cute. But the inside color is what you need to be worried about. Its the part thats most likely to get dirty. From bottles, and well you know the baby routine. Eat and poop.|`|gEz5ICgLaa	i would get the black one|`|lfGdztzxaa	I would say that black. it would go with anything.. hehe.|`|YC9vnWCvaa	rrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeddddddddddddd  i would say green because its my fav color but it just looks awwfull on a stroller
MwFN3DfPaa	I can honestly say my boyfriend is hoping for a little boy. So am I. However, we have both came to the conclusion its going to be a girl because we wanted a boy.    We really want a girl now. We've picked out tons of little girl names, but only one boys name. We're excited. We want our daughter and maybe even a little sister for her, if my body can take all this again.|`|qlgvecs9aa	Yes !!  First my husband wanted a girl so badly but then he changed his mind (I don't know why) but I always wanted a boy, so  finally we had a gorgeous baby boy !!  and we are both super happy with our cutie pie.|`|euUZZcM3aa	My boyfriend was alllll about having a boy. Everyone thought I was going to have a boy because of all my symptoms, but at my 20wk u/s they confirmed that we're having a beautiful baby girl =] I don't think he's disappointed, he's very happy, but I think most men look forward to having a son they can have to be like them. But, now he can look forward to having a little girl who will be a "daddy's girl." =p|`|pwu9xzF8aa	we have a 10 month old girl, and are 4 months pregnant with bub  2. I want a little boy- and he is desperate for another little girl. I thought that was odd, lol, but he badly wants two little girls- which i would be extremely happy with also. I just always assumed he would want a boy.|`|b1WMcGQ0aa	Mine did want a girl because he thought we'd have a beautiful daughter. I have two boys, though, as you know.... So, as soon as we found out we were having a boy, the thought of having a girl just went away. I think we're finished having babies, too, so I we'll just be content with boys. I know a lot of men who want daughters. I know my brother-in-law wants a daughter next time they have a baby, and my brother's wife is currently pregnant, and I think he wants a girl, too.|`|agfiNdLraa	my hubby is Hoping for a Boy. and im hoping for a girl!...|`|WlU3NFu6aa	thats funny. my husband honestly didnt care either way as long as the baby was healthy. i thought it was weird cause, yeah, i figured most men want boys|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Hahaaa!!!  Not that my husband ONLY wanted a girl, but he really wanted a girl the first round and we had a boy, but he adores him.  He still REALLY wants a girl.  He wants a little daddy's girl.   So, I hope this next round I can give him his little Helena.  =)

zk3Bp9uNaa	Most women dont start showing until 4months (around 16-20weeks) esp for a first pregnancy.    Nothing to worry about, very normal    Congrats|`|AA11828121	I'm 15wks and not really showing. The top of my stomach is a little bigger but it's from the organs being moved up to make room for the baby. It's completely normal. Most women don't show until 3-5 months and you're not even in your 3rd yet so don't stress!!!|`|Hh4BORyzaa	Oh that is totally normal.  I just had my third Dr. appointment today, 18 weeks, and have only gained about 2.5 pounds since I've been preggo.  I didn't start wearing maternity clothes until just about a week ago, so don't worry about it.  If you are that worried, try asking your doctor just to get a confirmation from a professional.|`|sEihaeLNaa	very normal, i didnt show tll i was almost 7 months with my first and at 3 months with my 2nd.|`|ioZeveazaa	You are still quite early. Expect your bump to start showing more around 15 weeks or so. Good luck!|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	I didn't show until 6 months with my first....its totally normal. Everyone's body is different.|`|6avKnzkoaa	It's absolutely normal. People show at different times and different ways. Some don't show show until 7months and others show heaps earlier than that. It all depends on how the baby is positioned and your uterus and your built. As long as your baby is developing the way he/she is supposed to be developing then you're okay and normal.
U0KCmsKXaa	You need to quit being a bum and get your lazy butt out to get a job and your own place.  Quit mooching off your boyfriend's parents.  Sorry, to be so harsh, but you have absolutely no place to complain.|`|4AO2myzKaa	Ok you have been together for 3 years and are pregnant with his baby...definitely seems to be a great time to MOVE OUT.  I wouldn't have been able to handle an inlaw or parent when I'm pregnant, and by now you really should be on your own.|`|ecBx744aaa	Gsoh dont listen to these girls, so rude i swear!  just help around, if she trys to talk to you or ask you something just do it and try to smile and not be rude then talk sh*t about her to your husband later ;) lol.|`|zx8cVDqIaa	Maybe you should move out, get a cheap place until you can afford something better. I wouldn't take **** from anyone especially her.|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	sounds like no matter what you do or say shes going to be who she is, older people are really set in their ways and they dont often change, so my suggestion is for you and your boyfriend to seriously work on getting your own place. if he doesnt already, he should be working, and you also if you can. if you guys dont have sufficient income then he needs to look for a better job, i know times are hard, but you have to do what you have to do to get the things you want. Just keep the peace, take whatever she throws at  you and brush it off, its hard when you're pregnant i know, but it is her house and you cant afford to get kicked out right now|`|KozoNqpsaa	I'm not sure I understand where and with whom you live? Do you absolutely have to live there? If so, and you can't help but get mad at her, I would suggest ignoring her as much as possible and when you can't do that, just be nice as she's providing you with a roof over your head!    You're not giving out much info here as to what exactly the problem or situation is. If you really want some good advice, try adding more details about it.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Uh you could move out, that would be an option... or try to be more respectful to the people letting you live in their home.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	You are living under her roof which means you have to respect her and be polite. If you can't stand her, move out!!|`|B45065Plaa	Trust me best thing to do is give her and her house respect. Eventually she will get it.|`|zxk9pJ6Taa	Well you should have thought about this before you got pregnant   you are all full of hormones and that makes it hard to control your emotions  it is her house and you are unmarred and pregnant with her grandchild  maybe you need to grow up and start pulling your weight around the house   give her respect and she will respect you back   or get a job and move out|`|JsaEk8UAaa	Not really sure what you are asking here. If you are living in her house then she is able to set rules for you about her house. If you are pregnant with her grand baby you need to be talking to her son. If you are pregnant maybe you need to consider getting your own place so that you are able to do as you please without the conflict.|`|pmr65Sgraa	move out you can't deal with this stress right now|`|x3NIn6rSaa	confront her and make peace  she'll respect you  if not its her problem  and you were the bigger person|`|AA11758617	Suck it up. Be nice to her - it's her house and you chose her son with your eyes wide open, this will give you an incentive to save for a place of your own. Many of us lived with in-laws when we were younger - show kindness and respect to his parents while you are under their roof - and I know - it isn't fair if you aren't being respected back. I know this isn't what you want to hear, but you have a baby on the way and need a roof over your heads. She will notice that you are trying to be respectful, after a while perhaps you can talk with her woman to woman after all she'll be your baby's grandmother and most likely will want to have the child in her life too. Save, save, save for your own place. Best of luck.|`|nti4j9k2aa	It's her house. If you don't like her or the rules, grow up, get a job and get your own place.|`|j0zDQQG2aa	I don't know, stay with someone else.|`|3e6175bba38d844ea9a99e1eab5894b2aa	You are at her house.  Try to calm down because it is better for your baby.  Do not let her get you nervous because the stress is not worth it.  Try to be out of the house.  Go to a park for an hour or so to walk, or visit friends, get a part-time job or volunteer somewhere.  When you are at home try to take a nap and tell her you are exhausted.  You need to rest, exercise, eat, drink water to take care of your baby.  Good luck!!!!|`|gEz5ICgLaa	you should try to do the best for you and your baby|`|lfGdztzxaa	The best way to stop it is go to you local social security office and look for apartments and living head quarters that help people that don't have that much money. Must of the time they have list of places you can try. Just getting out of her house will help keep the peace...    If you have the money, then pack your bags and run for the door!|`|PwSzStJiaa	First I would like you to know that I know exactly what you are talking about. I live with my in-laws too. I love them and it has not been a smooth road. My advice is a lot of prayer. Each day that you wake up before you do anything else, get on your knees and ask God to help you with the daily trials, and that he would give you patience with your in-laws. I can testify that this has worked for me. Try it and watch God work. It also helps to get out of the house for even an hour a day. Go for a walk around the block or to the nearest mall or walmart and get out to clear your head. Moving out is probably not the answer right now but pray about that too. Remember God does love you and He wants your love too.|`|015q1IKQaa	YOU NEED TO MOVE OUT! You are pregnat you cant be going through all these stress. it is already stressful being pregnant and you could go into early labor that way.|`|AA11920812	Here`s my solution for you.    Sit down with her and have a heart to heart. Start by telling her how hard this is for you to open up to her. You know that you two have had your rough moments. And, its been hard for her having to put up with you...and you kind of invaded her space. Tell her you are sorry...then tell her how hard it is for you. Tell her that you feel like no one wants you...your mom left you...you have no one left...blah blah blah insert whatever you feel about the whole thing.    Just air it out. Let her talk about. My mother in law and I had real issues. I mean issues! She didn`t even speak English but I always left that channel open. I know she needs it and always will. The more transparent you are the more comfortable the bf`s mom will be.    It`s obvious you didn`t mean her any harm, your situation is a rough one right now. And, tell her that. I`d also show a bit of responsablity and look for some jobs. Does your boyfriend work? That may be what she is really upset about as well...
72iZuDjeaa	it's amazing there isn't rules for this sort of thing... i totally agree timmy...|`|FP8Avd3oaa	Yes I think that no unmarried woman should have 14 kids and expect her mother to be around to help her. Her oldest is 7, 7 years old aand she has 14 kids. That on average 2 kids a year for 7 years that is just too much too soon! But this is strictly my opinion to which I am intitled!|`|cowH0YOeaa	yeah i think shes crazy|`|b9f2e3a8dc363f474dc664216e1823b1aa	Yes and Yes|`|RJoy2QlAaa	well i want six weare on the second one and my mom in law had 10 i love big familys|`|AVcTCrSGaa	I think the whole situation is crazy.  I don't even understand how this can happen.  Did her doctor implant her with eight eggs?  Usually the most they implant is three.  So, if that's the case, that definitely raises an ethics issue.|`|jdRKZe18aa	I think this shows your extreme immaturity to say such a thing.  It's hardly anyone elses place to say how many kids anyone else can or should have.  SOME people actually have the emotional capability and GIFT to handle that many children - I know I sure don't - but some admirable people do.  AND for those who do - I say more power to you and BETTER you than me! ; )|`|oP504BtFaa	She makes me very upset, from what I've heard. Her mother is calling her 'obsessed with having babies' so without a husband, she has used in vitro to provide herself with literally dozens of babies! There is no humanly way for a single mother to provide for 14 children on her own, and the dangers of such a high order birth are INFINITE. I can't even believe the doctors implanted eight embryos. They thought there were seven? That's still too many. I had four babies at one time and I even I know how risky that is - DOUBLE THAT?! Yes, I'm a little peeved.|`|W8UZebRWaa	She sounds crazed but I don't know her personally. Maybe she's  not as bad as they are saying.  I don't know why someone would want that many kids and from what I read no father involved.  To each her own I guess.|`|lGg8AU1Yaa	hey the state is giving her free dipers and milk till there grown so thats cool|`|h6kTWuNVaa	her parents sure think so!    I just heard on Headline news she is a single mom!! WOW!!    Her parents said she has been obsessed with having kids since she was a teen & her dad is going to go back to iraq to work construction to send her $$$ to support her 14!    I THINK THATS CRAZY!!
145RUNQHaa	No at 14 she is still a child 18 is entering into adulthood.find someone your own age.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	You can like her, but that's it. Keep in mind that even if she is a willing partner, she or her parents can charge you with statutory rape if you have sex with her. This can happen even if she is not accusing you. Don't put yourself in that position, you don't want to go through life as a sex offender, and you really don't want to go to jail.|`|qPrMM2r6aa	I agree with all 3 answers. You can't really even touch her because it's against the law.|`|4c0zHQqWaa	I find it disturbing that an 18 year old is attracted to a 14 year old girl, considering that the average of those girls are just beginning puberty. I sense some kind of pervertedness in this. And that is wrong. Even if she is consensual, you can still get charged with statutory rape, and contributing to the delinquincy of a minor. 14 year old girls don't have good judgement either. She is way too young to be putting her into any bad position. If you cannot get someone your age at such a young age, then you do not need to be trying to mess around with a 14 year old. You are disgusting.|`|zLoyo24Taa	Can he? YES  Should he? NO|`|JdqDauEDaa	Sure. But what you do about it is another story.|`|xPgKWIigaa	Of course you can  BUT  It is very morally wrong. 14 is still a child, 18 is just about an adult.   What does a 14yr old know about life, love etc.....|`|n86J8erpaa	maybe......................................|`|FP8Avd3oaa	Can he? Yes! May he hope in bed with her, NO!|`|q7XSr1Lgaa	Your at 2 different stages in your life. Ones in college ones in high school! One is [probably] moving out in a couple years. One still can't drive a car or work a decent job!

RqM1TZXyaa	I really like the new series charachters,  well mainly just Effy and Freddie.    I liked the first episode, but the second was a little bit of a let down.  I just hope that they get better so that they get the ratings to make a 4th series of skins,  and develop the charachters a lot more.|`|h0HycfRnaa	i think that skins is a good show, but its not realy for children if itson at 10 , i think it kind of shows people wha happens when you do this kind of thing but thats my opinion realy|`|AA10183922	I miss the old characters, but I feel like I could get used to the new ones too.

Also, Feb. 6th is my birthday! Just thought I would share that...haha. :]|`|DnyyyGeEaa	I went all the way to 42 weeks! It was terrible, so I know how you feel! Just hold out though because your almost there! Congrats, and good luck! I hope everything goes great for you.|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	I've heard that eating very low-fat meals for a few days can trigger labor, because as the baby matures, it needs high-fat doses to mature the brain and such. Labor is naturally triggered when your body's fat sources and food sources can no longer give that to baby. There's even a popular restaurant in Hollywood that serves salads that are famous for sending women into labor.    It may be all nonsense, but at 40+ weeks, I bet you're willing to try anything! good luck

oA8Rtyxuaa	I don't see why they wouldn't let you, they let people use their laptops! I would do that if you want, coloring books, puzzles, picture books, also pack one small emergency toy, something new just in case you absolutely have to go there! I flew with my daughter when she was just three alone,  was a nervous wreck too! She did just fine! I think its thrilling for them to be on a plane! Good luck!|`|6RGnG1ukaa	Buying that is a very good idea! I might have to get my kids one too.   Get some coloring books and buy travel lap desks. The lap desks could be used for others things too.       http://www.organize.com/laptraywhite.htm...    You may be able to find cheaper ones but that's all I could find.|`|pYHfZODGaa	coloring books.|`|bd3d8e1920d596e5bd7fe432bdd8c312aa	2 hours is a short time. It'll pass before you know.  The waiting at the airport is more painful.     Anyway - you can take books, color pencils, a few small toys.  We play games on the plane.    I think the more important thing is that when the plane is about to land and take-off, ensure your kids open their mouths - so that the pressure difference does not cause their ears to ache.    I generally get a lollipop for my kids, so that they sucking and keep their mouths keep open.

I'm 19weeks exactly & I've noticed I can feel it move when I'm sitting down, it really does feel like there are butterflies trapped in your lower abdomen! Try having something to eat then sitting in a chair & focus on the area beneath your belly button but don't worry if it takes another several weeks until you do feel it as that's normal too! I wish you luck :)|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	I first felt my baby girl move around between 17 and 18 weeks. By week 22 they were stronger and I noticed her pattern. I also seen my belly "jump" as the baby kicked around 21/22 weeks.     My books say alot depends on how soon you can feel your baby, like your body shape/weight. But it also said that each pregnancy for each women is different and what one women experienced another may not.    Your only about 14 weeks along, you may feel them sooner then you think. I have heard of people feeling their baby as early as 14 and 15 weeks.|`|o2ehEqinaa	I felt her move at 17 weeks exactly - I was about 157lbs.|`|EAeffKqSaa	Well for me ...

Tc23KWgzaa	If you are only anemic, you can count yourself lucky.  Go see your doctor.  Today.    TX Mom|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	If you're passing out you need to see a doc! People on Y!A can't diagnose you.|`|9XzdTvdlaa	You could JUST be anemic, and not pregnant.      Let's start with a couple of options as your next steps - and will start with the most economical...    WAIT TWO WEEKS.  Then, find a 99 cent store, Dollar Tree, or dollar store of some kind and purchase ANOTHER pregnancy test.      or...    Go to the doctor.  Give the doctor your symptoms and tell him/her your thoughts.  The dr. will most likely order some blood tests.    DO NOT TAKE AN IRON SUPPLEMENT UNLESS DIRECTED BY YOUR DOCTOR... you CAN overdose on iron.    The first option mentioned is obviously the most cost-effective (then, of course, if the test is positive, you will need to seek quality prenatal care).  If you have no access to health insurance, you can visit a clinic inside your local supermarket or Walgreens (they are fairly new), and the visit is approximately $69, with lab costs billed to you directly after they are processed at an additional cost.  You can also contact your local Planned Parenthood for reduced fee/free assistance and well-woman exams.    Good luck to you, and take care of yourself!|`|4lpJRXYsaa	anemia doesnt develop until later in a pregnancy. If you got a negative then i wouldsay you are not pregnant. If you want to make for sure call your doctor to get a blood test done, becaise there could be something else going on, if you are passing out and getting sick constantly thats nothing to mess with|`|v0GwTTsVaa	I wouldn't buy a cheap test.........they didn't work for me.  When I found out I was pregnant with my daughter I had taken three cheap home tests.  When I went to the doctor the test came back possitive.  I got pregnant again 8 months after my daughter was born, took mid priced tests they came back negative, the doctor took two and the were positive.  I miscarried that pregnancy, but go to the doctor to be on the safe side.  And if you are not ready for children talk to your doctor or the health department about birth control as well as anemia problems.|`|cSOpcKOWaa	Please consult your doctor this is not a place for diagnosis.

DS2huIAkaa	White spots in the throat, as you say, is NOT bronchitis. White spots are small ulcers? White spots are on tonsils? Ask now for medical help for the poor baby. In the meantime, keep her forehead cool and generally try to get her temperature down (no overdressing, not have the heating too high). Give the baby water to drink or weak herbal tea. No acid fruit juices on an empty stomach. Taking no food for a couple of days will not do much harm but baby must have water. Priority is to get baby well so, forget about the party for now. Get proper medical help NOW.|`|oDswBDyAaa	Hospital straight away, don't hesitate,l do it now without delay. High temps in young children are not what I would call a good idea.

It's not that they are allergic or can't take the medicine. If she had a fever, it generally means there's an infection somewhere and the antibiotics should be treating that. In my experience, once they have had a solid 2 days of antibiotics they are generally much improved.    In the meantime, hang in there. We've all been through the sleepless nights and trust me, even when they're 20 years old..it doens't stop!|`|pOHVhVqgaa	If she has white "spots" on her throat that is infection not bronchitis, she may have strep throat and her throat is sore, can she talk?

Just thought I would share my own experience with you Im not a Doctor so of course I am not 100% sure even if we are talking about the same thing. I hope she gets better quick.|`|l7g5JBEEaa	If it gets worse take her immediately to emergency.  but follow your doctors orders.  at least if she is throwing up she is getting the bug out of her system.  feed her soup and easy foods on the tummy.  just keep her bundled up so she can sweat it out.|`|AA10833162	first of all ..mr sfdaff c. your a real jerk.. and dear im sure your baby will be ok but if she dosent keep any liquids down she needs to be in the hospital getting liquids from an i v .. hope all works dear|`|eHow24rNaa	Since you took her to the doctor this morning and the doctors gave her antibiotics, it might not be kicking in just yet. I would give it another day to kick in. Also, i wouldnt force her to eat anything big. As long as shes got liquids, she should be okay. Maybe go and buy some pedialite?? That always helped my daughter when she was your daughters age. I would also demand to see her original doctor...if you trust her normal doctor, i would make sure she sees that one. Good luck and try to calm down...i know its hard to but you have to remember, when your nervous, she will be. She can tell when her mommys upset and nervous. Take care and ill be praying for her to get better by her party....happy birthday!

A1QpwziEaa	if you're going to use the drop in system, then I say keep both sets.  you won't be using the 4oz and 8 oz bottles at the same time anyway.  If you're feeding formula, then all you need is to stock up on the liners.  it's up to you if you return the other regular bottles...if they're all different kinds, your baby not easily switch back and forth between nipples and bottles.  Personally, I use the original drop ins, but I'm breastfeeding so popping in a bag of milk into the nurser is awesome.|`|4IZisR5Jaa	I use drop ins and the good thing is you really only have to change the liner and the nipple for each feeding. I have 2 drop in bottles (4 oz) My baby is a week old. I just bought a variety of nipples, so I can just change out nipples and liners between feedings. I love the drop ins, makes life soo much easier.|`|z74wSbQoaa	If you plan to use the drop in style bottles, then 4 - 4 oz. and 4 - 8 oz. is not too many.  If you're bottle feeding and you plan to be on the go all day you'd likely pack 5 or 6 bottles.
A1QpwziEaa	i'm assuming your doctor prescribed you the mini-pill since you're breastfeeding, so if it is, you should take it as prescribed.  you may experience spotting.  I'm on the depo-provera shot since I'm breastfeeding and I started to spot about a month after I got the shot....it lasted 3 weeks!  if you have any doubts, call your doctor.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	The pill does not stop ovulation.  All it does is try to prevent the egg from implanting, so yes you are likely having your period right now.  And whether it is low dose or not those hormones are going straight to your baby through your milk.  I applaud you for breastfeeding though.  I do get very happy when people don't give in to formula thinking that it is the same as breast milk.|`|pVWk12oOaa	You shouldn't be taking the pill while breastfeeding!!!  Unless it is the new low-dose pill...  but personally I opted not to go on it, just to be safe.|`|Q9qno7EVaa	I have an 8 week old and just started birth control yesterday, I'm on the Minipill (progesterone only).

nKXTjqQWaa	Look in her mouth, she could have thrush. My son would pull off the breast while suckling and continue to latch and unlatch while nursing when he had thrush. Colic is when babies cry a lot for no reason. If she isn't eating you should get her to a new doctor as soon as possible.    EDIT.. If she were teething you would know. My son is fussy all the time now that he's teething, chews on everything (100 times more than before) drools a ton more than before. My son rubs his eyes when he's tired. Are her eyes pink in color? Maybe pink eye? Sounds like shes eating though.. Is she still having the same amount of diapers as before? If it were an allergy you  would see a rash or maybe slight swelling.    If she's eating enough I wouldn't worry so much. She's likely just doing it from habit.|`|oDswBDyAaa	Can I suggest that if your little one has colic lay her across your knees tummy down and rock her gently. We had one with colic and did this on a regular basis and found it worked.  May I suggest that when feeding her, give her half her feed, then sit her up on your knee, put you hand behind her head for support the other hand on her tummy and very gently lower her backwards almost to horizontal then sit her back up slowly and burp. this helps the air bubbles float to the top of the stomach.  Try these, they should work hopefully.    Lots of luck    UK based Mum

Also, if you're a girl (you didnt specify) use a foundation with a green undertone (helps hide red) pink will just make it show up more. Confidence is key|`|MdSU0s8Saa	this used to happen to me a lot but as you gain confidence hopefully it will die down. Work gradually at building your self esteem and you'll be fine =]|`|J3H3C5ksaa	I don't gaining confidence helps, I'm exactly like you too.  Even though I pretty confident, but not to the point I'm conceited,   I still blush like mad! I don't even know why! It's really annoying, nothing, in my opinion, you can do.
hw3OMoeZaa	This is not a gross answer but it may sound like it.  If you or your partner can stimulate your nipples that sometimes helps.  Like once the baby nurses it releases a chemical to contract and shrink your uterus back into shape, this works the same way.  Pinching the nips releases a chemical that will contract the uterus sometimes bringing on labor. Good Luck|`|LtfKwKQeaa	if you are near your due like a few days or so you can get induced by the hospital. or you can try walking every night to bring about the labor faster.|`|fZgoUty4aa	im a mum of 4 nan of 6 so caster oil and orange juice mixed ..and then walk up and down stairs or jump up and down it makes the head go down faster let us know what you have and when right start jumping or up and dawn stairs|`|aLkCxq5aaa	Get on a birthing ball!  Worked for me last pregnancy.

I bought the ebook, and I would be more than happy to email you a copy if you want. just shoot me an email, I check my hotmail more often, my address is megan_major@hotmail.com  The book is 53 pages long and has detailed instructions and pictures on how to find the correct spots and stuff like that.  I'm gonna try it myself!  You can go to www.maternityacupressure.com to read more about it, and reviews from women who've done it.|`|DnyyyGeEaa	Castor oil. You can find it at Walgreens. I took that in a rootbeer float on a friday and I had my baby on Monday. I also did alot of walking after that and some people say that matress mambo does the trick also.|`|LNnP3oAgaa	A bloody hot curry is supposed to work.  i wouldnt know though, Ive never had a baby.|`|xBd96wvRaa	If you whine enough to your doctor he will induce you. :)    But nipple stimulation and breast message helps along with unprotected sex, there is a hormone is semen that softens and encourages the cervix to dilate.    Castor oil will cause diarrhea and cramps. I tried it and did not go into labor totally not worth it.|`|S6JIqzjEaa	Nice warm bath and a small rum is an old fashioned remedy.

WWcaKZ7Qaa	I actually get that just at the regular grocery store. I don't know where you live, we have Kroger here, and I have gotten it there. I think I have seen it at Whole Foods as well. It's not too hard to find.    Also, if you put ginger in with apple juice it's actually pretty yummy. Like a spicy cider that settles your stomach! :)|`|hw3OMoeZaa	Fiesta food store if you have one ,  and our local grocery stores carry it.  Also go online and look for preggo pops, they are a sucker that has ginger in them and they work wonders.  Good Luck!|`|4AO2myzKaa	Just go to the grocery store, they sell regular ginger, and you would just need to use a mandolin or food processor to chop it smaller.  BTW, I found out if you drink a ton of water before eating, you typically will be able to keep your food down.  It's dehydration that makes you so sick.  Just thought I'd share!|`|f0e6bb08f78bda5965b94f88de6064f6aa	check the produce section of your regular grocery store, its sold as ginger root and you have to slice it.  I slice mine with a sharp knife
obN6p3Cgaa	May be you are you can get a blood test at your doc.|`|qkdaNCDxaa	no because if you was pregnant your period would have not come a couple time well for nine mouths|`|wqOTgbxmaa	if sounds like you are but to make sure get tested good luck|`|ad2e8345166a8759ec088befeab7e168aa	You could be. Just because you might be pregnant, doesn't mean you will not have your period. My Aunt had her period until May and my "niece" was born in July of that same year. Take a HPT and no matter what the result is, go to the dr. If u are it might not show positive kn the home test. Just go to your dr and get a test. And just relax. Lol.
Zsc1Esxvaa	You can be pregnant right now but you will not know for sure until the day your period is supposed to start. Take another test then.|`|4AO2myzKaa	You are pregnant, even if you got a very faint line.  Congrats!|`|ZWB0OvTXaa	a line is a line...even if it's faint...the closer to get to your period or once you miss it, the line will get darker. you are definitely pregnant!!  congrats!|`|qxnZXOVFaa	chances are good...even a faint positive is still positive.  test again if you miss your period.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	Congrats!!!! you are pregnant!!! You need to find and OB and get on prenatal vitamins for your and the baby!!!|`|KozoNqpsaa	You probably tested a little too early. Even at 5 days before AF, they are only about 50-60% accurate. However, false positives are really rare, so it sounds encouraging! Wait a few days and retest in the morning. Good luck!|`|6zVISNTZaa	I'd wait about a week and do another test, just to make sure, but if there was a line, it's a good indication.|`|8V39PymEaa	then you can be pregnant I think you are from what I've read|`|9XzdTvdlaa	Well, not very good.  Are you certain this is the ONLY time that you have had unprotected sex?  Think real hard - we all tend to forget this type of thing once in a while.    Why don't you wait a week and then test again...   If the line is darker, you need to get yourself to a doctor.    Everything will be okay.  Just relax and take care of yourself.    GOOD LUCK!|`|DO0DWnBPaa	That depends. For a home pregnancy test to give you a positive result, your body has to be making a detectable level of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). But not all pregnancy tests can detect the same amount of hCG; a sensitive test is one that turns positive even if a low amount of the hormone is present. The more sensitive a pregnancy test is, the earlier it will show a positive result.      If the test you're using is only faintly positive, it may not be very sensitive. If you still have the box, it should say somewhere what the test's sensitivity is  the lower the number, the better the test. For example, a test with a sensitivity of 20 IU/L (milliInternational Units per Liter) will tell if you're pregnant sooner than a test with a sensitivity of 50 IU/L. A good rule of thumb is that the more expensive a pregnancy test is, the more sensitive it's likely to be. But you should still read the side of the box to see what the kit says|`|jQDeTTVhaa	I believe you are pregnant I took a test 5 days before my period and It was positive so its very possible that you are pregnant.A faint line is still a positive|`|nluNSDI4aa	On every test they always say that whether the line is faint or clear as day, its accurate(depending on when you took the test) You are pregnant. If you want to be certain then just test again. simple.|`|d5e3g4LEaa	Those test that can pick up on the hormone before your missed period are pretty accurate and don't often give false positives.  If your period is supposed to be in 6 days and you've been doing the deed unprotected for 7 days, makes it 13 days before your period which is a pretty fertile time.  Might be time to make an appointment with your doctors office or a clinic.|`|MwOMTHkKaa	If the test you took was a home pregnancy test there is a chance that it is incorrect especially if it was a faint line. It could be too soon for the test to detect whether you are or not pregnant. My advice if you REALLY want to know the truth would be to make an appointment for the doctor and take a test there (you cant go wrong with that) if you dont have time to do that then take another home pregancy test and see how that goes just so that you can have a second answer. But if you REALLY want to know the truth GO TO THE CLINIC!!!  Good Luck|`|c514ab60d032cd502586ab20596643bdaa	Any positive is usually a positive.  Test again, or see your physician.|`|Ltb8K9YUaa	You are likely pregnant. Depending on the test that you used it could be an evaporation line. That happened to me a few times and I was not pregnant. You should test again tomorrow or the next day in the morning. If you are pregnant the line will get darker. Better yet you should take a blood test. Thats never wrong. Good luck!
4GnzqUxzaa	Post menstrual and pregnancy symptoms can be a lot a like. The best thing for you is to just wait until your period is due. If no signs of a period wait at least a week or so and the go get an at home pregnancy test.|`|nluNSDI4aa	Well why are you asking strangers for, take a hpt on the 10th or after you miss.
bAp35x7uaa	Oh sweetie, you poor things.  It sounds to me as though she's feeling hugely insecure - the thought of you being arrested and possibly jailed has completely scared and unsettled her which is why she's reacting this way.    Although, in saying that, she should have gotten over it by now so perhaps there may be an underlying issue - possibly she is prenatally depressed?    I know it may be difficult - and obviously the more clingy she is, the more you probably back off emotionally, which then makes her more clingy - but please try to be as supportive as you can (you sound like you're doing your best already - good bloke!).  I would strongly recommend making an appointment with her GP or midwife immediately to discuss this and to make sure there isn't anything more sinister at play.      The likelihood is there's nothing wrong, other than hormones and being scared, but it won't hurt to talk it through with someone.    Good luck and love to you both xxxx|`|euUZZcM3aa	She is feeling very vulnerable right now. When you got arrested, the thought of you not being there for here whether it's involuntary or voluntary, was very real to her and it probably freaked her out. She doesn't want to be alone, and that's probably how she felt and is afraid it'll happen, so she wants to be with you 24/7/365. Let her know that everything will be ok, assure her you would never leave her alone and that you'll do whatever it takes to make sure of that, and that you love her and your baby-to-be. All you can really do is sooth her and be patient. Women are exxxxtremely emotional during pregnancy. She's also close to popping, which puts her more on edge. If at all possible, there's no such thing as "you time" right now, as she seems to be in much need for you. I know it doesn't seem fair, but the health of your pregnant girlfriend and your baby are more important right now. Hang in there|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	It's most likely the hormones. Pregnancy is pretty rough on us ladies. She is probably just feeling very needy right now. It's pretty normal for pregnant women to have extreme emotions like that. She might even have a bout of depression going on.|`|8V39PymEaa	tell her how you feel and that everything is going to be fine|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	Pregnancy is a very tough time for us women, half of the emotions we feel can't be controlled, so it makes us a bit unstable, and I know that can be very hard for men to deal with all the time. Be patient and tell her very gently, very honestly, that while you adore her and will never abandon her, you need to do things alone and you hope she trusts you. Your fight probably scared her and she is afraid of being left to handle this child on her own, so she needs reassurance. Start small, leave for 5 minutes to walk to the gas station for some gum, then leave for 10 minutes the next day, and so on. If she can get in touch with you easily, she'll feel better, so carry a cell phone, and don't ignore it when she calls.|`|I08pH9Byaa	That sucks for you, but it is also very sweet.  She will laugh at herself after the baby gets here.  And it will be a very wonderful story for the baby to hear for many years to come.    However you handle it, remember that-  this little one will hear this nice sentimental story of how mommy wouldn't let daddy out of her sight...so sweet.  Can you imagine them telling that story to their kids?  It's up to you how you want it to end.  Dad put up with it although it was driving him insane.  Or Dad finally broke and went nuts.  Good Luck.|`|6zVISNTZaa	It's probably the shock of you getting arrested, even though you were innocent, it made her think of how it would be so easy to lose you when she needs you most, and her hormones would have amplified this because she is pregnant. Have you asked her how she is feeling?|`|xcPghcw9aa	pregnant woman do get very emotional. so its normal. and whats a flat?|`|6avKnzkoaa	It's probably partially emotions. She's already 8months pregnant. It won't be long before she's actually going to give birth. She's probably scared. It's normal for pregnant women and any women for that matter, to crave attention and love from their partners.   Either, sit her down and tell her that you need some space, or just be there for her until she delivers the baby, and it might ease off a bit. Good luck|`|JEfOxpzeaa	Her hormones are out of wack, shes 8 months already, shes probably scared that youll get arrested and shell have the baby without you..Give it a few days it may wear off, or it may not. You only have a little time left with her being pregnant, so just deal with it for now, the best you can, just be there for her. Good luck.|`|ITu6gONdaa	she is prob just emotional. You have to understand that while she is pregnant her emotions and hormones are going to be out of wack. You just have to be patient and understanding and try to talk to her.
tvF86mRDaa	Ignore the bad and praise the good! When the two elder ones are being good, praise them more, when the taunt you with "favouritism" - ignore it. They'll soon stop but they know it upsets you and gets a reaction. It will pass, but maybe try to spend a little extra time with just those two either together or separately so you can show you love them. Separately is probably better so they won't just wind each other up!  When I was younger I had eczema and my parents struggled not to treat me differently and not give me more attention. Only way round it is to give them some quality time with you (yes I am super nanny!) and give more praise to the good they do. But ignore the taunting at all costs - no matter how upsetting! Kids are smart little things, and once they know how to press your buttons they will!|`|jdRKZe18aa	You are being entirely too sensitive and too hard on yourself.  YOU love all your children.  WE all do as parents (I have 4 too!). and, no matter how many you have or who has what needs or issues - they ALL THINK you show favoritism towards the other or the younger or the older!  THEY ALL DO THIS... not just yours and NOT just because you have a child with some special needs.    As much as we LOVE EACH of them - we can't love them each in the same WAY because they are all unique and different.  They all have different LOVE Languages, different personalities, different areas that need more or less attention etc.  WE AREN'T PERFECT and all we can do is our BEST and love them ALL unconditionally.  LET this be THEIR PROBLEM not yours and just tell them that whatever they think or feel - that all you can and DO try to do is love ALL OF THEM the best you can.  At different times in each of their lives they each might need more or less from you and all you can do is ADJUST accordingly.  If they don't like that then tell them they are FREE TO GO LIVE ELSEWHERE with people who can NEVER LOVE THEM as much as you do!|`|N37Udp4Iaa	My little brother had speech problems and got a lot of attention which annoyed me but he needed the help and I understand that now but could never back then.    Kids can be really mean and not realise the emotional hurt they are causing. If I was in your position I would not react to their comments and they will soon get bored as its possibly their way of getting your attention    Chris  www.teech.org - UK based charity raising aid and running projects is some of the poorest parts of Eastern Europe such as Bucharest and Moldova|`|538c1fe1a2e40d8a0eeb8046985ef01eaa	They have found a way of playing the guilt card.  Sit them all down together and explain that you love them all equally but just as they are individuals each of them have different needs at different times, each of them may get more attention when needed but that is not favouritism.  If they want to have your attention when they need it they each are responsible in supporting you in allowing you to give it to the others when they need it.  Keep a mental note of when you help each and give them a GENTLE reminder when they start complaining.|`|q1nwoSh1aa	no offense but i would be mad if i were the older siblings too... treat them all the same, despite her speech problems... im13. deliah might become a brat when she's older... i knew a girl who had health problems & she was treated like you treat deliah & her sisters ended up disliking her etc. etc.  deliah will have to learn i guess another way because it sounds like your favoriting her to me.    im sorry i dont wanna be mean im just trying to help... :(|`|AA10943329	Tell them yes she is my favourite. She doesn't bully others because of their limitations and she isn't at me all the time about "favourites". Tell them that you love them all equally but their behaviour towards their sister does not make you like them as much as you want to. Explain that families stick together and help each other, not pick on when they have troubles.  Also try to have one on one time with each of them. Maybe on the weekend when your husband can look after the others go out with one child. Go have a milkshake and chat. Rotate Saturdays . One each Saturday.  Also try to have some time with each child at home. Even 10 minutes with each child would be great|`|cz4zO8wYaa	if this is not true you should ask them why they are accusing you of this. or they feel your doing somthing wrong in there life. maybe you should try doing a family activity that needs teamwork done, and try and be really fun and they will respect you hope things work out.|`|MG0TqatQaa	Well I'm not a parent but I am the youngest of my family and I've been through everything from being spoiled by mommy, to being scolded by my older siblings.  You should honestly give all of your children a little mommy time and discipline them when they scold each other and act hateful. I believe you're doing the right thing for your four year old, because i also had a speech problem (that's not so bad anymore) and careful management and encouragement will help her as she gets older to not become too self conscious. And if a good explanation doesn't get your 10 and 7 year old on the right track, then a good story about them that relates to the current situation will.  GOOD  LUCK : )|`|uq4ZuWnEaa	I am sorry to say that there is some jealousy here.   You need to get your older children more involved in trying to help Delilah at least in her speech.   My youngest daughter, who is now 36, was very slow in her speech nobody could understand her except my two elder daughters. Of course, the age gap was very small between the three the next up was only two years older and the elder three years older.   They acted as interpreters for her and tried very hard to get to pronounce her words.  They had a great responsibility at that young age and it made them feel that they were contributing something.   My youngest could sing nursery rhymes quite perfectly she just could not converse in normal English, her speech lent towards French for some reason.  I was told that she did not need speech therapy and that she will learn once she goes to school, they would not accept her in preschool in the 70's as the places were reserved for high risk children.   However, on her first day at school she came home and when I  asked if she like school she came out with "actually mummy" so clearly just like an adult I had to sit down from sheer shock.  Chin up tell them you love them all equally and perhaps they would like to help you help Delilah.  Good luck
h90ABQYaaa	take him to a doctor it could result in a seizure|`|ggETPqedaa	Go to the hospital, sounds like a seizure.|`|JP2h62qiaa	call your pediatrician. ASAP|`|xcPghcw9aa	Sounds like your baby might be having a seizure, take him to the ER and have them run some test on him. they are the only ones who can tell you. no one else on here.|`|rcdTluUjaa	Is it very brief or does it last for more than a second or two? Has this been going on since birth or did it just start? It sounds like you could be describing a startle reflex. However it could also be a seizure, so you definitely want to get him checked out.
AA12074662	Talk to your doctor.  If it is causing you back problems they maybe able to reduce them using your medical insurance.  Talk to the doctor and see if they can make a medical claim to have them reduced.  My mom had told me that a friend of hers in the military had her breast reduced for the same reasons that you have stated here.  Call and make an appointment with you primary doctor and see what they say.|`|GG1oN4rSaa	There are these special bra's and  there are belts for the back that could help out.    Goodluck with your young daughter ^^.|`|qlgvecs9aa	Are you still breast-feeding ??  I have a 1 year old and I am in a 36 , size 8/9 and have the same back problem and so far the only choice I have found is a breast surgery but I don't want to just yet.  Hopefully after you stop breast-feeding they will go back to your normal size.|`|hNHaNPeuaa	i think it really depends on what happens to you breasts after breast feeding. They could go back to your original size, maybe go down a size or stay at the current size you are now. I think you should really wait and see what happens post pregnancy.

We didn't want her to hurt herself while climbing out in the middle of the night.    She was about 18 mos|`|wBpennsMaa	15 months because thats what my daughter's crib safety manual suggests|`|Nd8kf0h8aa	round 1 1/2 or 2|`|ENANtueuaa	My daughter was 16 months when we switched her to a toddler bed. When it was time for bed, we'd have to put her back in it a few times a night before she actually fell asleep, but once she was asleep we had no problems at all. She did suprisingly well!|`|xGedX2rIaa	I changed my son into a toddler bed at 18 months. The signs to look for is if they are climbing out or attempting or when you need to start toilet training during the night ( they need to be able to go potty)|`|Fzn0ObQoaa	I attempted to switch my daughter from her toddler bed from her crib when she was about 18 months old. That was a bad idea, she freaked out and cried incessantly, grabbing at her crib, screaming that it was hers. Needless to say, she ended up sleeping in her toddler bed by the time she was 2 1/2. My son, on the other hand, had no problem at all switching when he was 21 months old and I ended up just taking the crib apart entirely before I set up his new bed.    I think the age varies, and a lot of parents say that their children start climbing out of their cribs. Maybe keep the toddler bed with new bedding in their room as you begin to transition and tell them how great it is to have a "big boy/girl" bed. I bought both of my children a special bed set that they weren't able to use until they started sleeping in their new beds as an incentive.|`|zLoyo24Taa	Around 1 1/2 - 2, or when they start to climb out of the crib.

Hopefully the babies father knows.|`|uGIFtFbCaa	First off she needs to go see a doctor. She needs to start taking care of herself and the baby. As far as telling her parents the sooner the better.

1c498d03fe9bb2e8719c81fe361b9912aa	it could be!! but u don't usually get the butterfly feelings (baby moving) until about 12 weeks, could just b getting ready for your period, but to be sure to a pregnancy test on friday (day after your periods due) to see, good luck|`|MojYmo5Jaa	Yes you could be, you get this weird feeling in your womb, like it feels quite tender. I suggest you buy a pregnancy tester pack as soon as possible to put your mind at rest.|`|QCN0VohQaa	I had quite a strong pain when I was unknowingly about 3 weeks pregnant, literally for a few hours one day, so it is possible. Best thing to do is buy a pregnancy test as soon as possible and eliminate it as a factor. I bought my test from Boots own brand and it worked perfectly well. From what I understand, if the test shows positive then there is very little possibility it is wrong as it detects a chemical which is only released when pregnant. Best of luck!
WWcaKZ7Qaa	Either it comes out on it's own or you have D&C or both. That's where they go into your uterus through your cervix and remove all the tissue.|`|T8zPA3FJaa	Depends on how early in your pregnancy you have a miscarriage. If it's quite early on, it may just seem like a period. With big blood clots.     I have never personally had a miscarriage, but my best friend had one not long ago at 16 weeks, she had to go to the hospital and they gave her a pill which started contractions and she had to give 'birth' to it in a sense.|`|nluNSDI4aa	D&C they can scrape the baby out or use some kind of suction thing( don't remember the name of it though)|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	If it's early enough, often the baby and tissue will pass like a very heavy period. Or they can dilate the cervix manually and scrape the insides of the uterus to remove the pregnancy, called a D &C or dilatation and curettage.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	A D&C is a dilation and curettage.  They dilate the cervix with a series of rods and use a currete to scrape the uterus.  In an early miscarriage, sometimes you just bleed heavily and that's it.  If everything is not expelled from the uterus, they do a D&C.  In a later miscarriage the woman will actually give birth to the baby, and again, if everything is not expelled on its own, like the placenta, they will do a D&C.  They will let you hold the baby and take pictures and foot prints.|`|jQDeTTVhaa	D&C  D&C, also known as dilation and curettage, is a surgical procedure often performed after a first trimester miscarriage. Dilation means to open up the cervix; curettage means to remove the contents of the uterus. Curettage may be performed by scraping the uterine wall with a curette instrument or by a suction curettage (also called vacuum aspiration), using a vacuum-type instrument.

I wouldn't sweat it, but if really want to get her to stop watching it.  The first thing you do is tell her no and tell her why she can't watch it. If she keeps throwing a fit and won't stop no matter where you go in the house.  Then leave the house.  take her window shopping or to a play ground to play.  It takes her mind off the tv, gives you control of how much tv she watches, and saves your insanity from the crying and fussing.|`|FdQD8H3qaa	In our house the tv is on most of the day... Not so much for the kids but more for me... I can't stand the quite!  My son has a few shows that he really likes but even when they are on he is still playing or doing something else at the same time.  I change the station all the time if I want to watch something or what not...  He doesn't care most of the time... I won't let my child be the one who is in charge of the tv  I know some people think that the tv is evil but I don't have a problem with it... It is mostly background noise in my house and if the tv isn't on the radio is so that I don't go crazy! Plus my son is really into music and loves to dance and sing to it and has sense he was born. I would have more then just one thing for her to watch and let her know that we don't just watch hi-5 and if she throws a fit then just turn it off and tell her that if she wants to throw a fit that she doesn't get any tv...|`|zLoyo24Taa	How old is she? I would limit her to an amount of time that you are comfortable with. If you think she likes the background noise, put on a kids music CD. Maybe you can allow her to watch one dvd a day and let her pick. Kids like repetition it helps them learn.|`|6bb5ab1593f2bb3b53c4348de44e9d3caa	you need to sit her down and explain to her the negative effects of TV    you're the parent, make her do her homework and read. there's nothing wrong with TV once in a while, like on weekends, but not everday especially school days|`|7SKVCPcSaa	ok, you're the parent, she is the kid.. turn the tv off and tell her no. but 2 hours really ins't that bad. especially if its educational. if you have her watching spongebob all day, then 2 hours is too much.|`|q7XSr1Lgaa	My brother is obsessed with the computer so my mom took away one of the cords that he needs to make the computer function. Also sign her up in activities so she doesn't even have time to watch t.v.|`|neBmSm0yaa	DO things in your house by the t.v like a card game or get her to color in front of it so then she'll want to do one of those things|`|DZCFD0p2aa	You let your kid dictate to you what she wants?!?!? just take away the TV. If you can't control a kid, she'll whoop your a$$ when she is a teenager.|`|28144eb29fc234a2e2c879b5109675a4aa	Maybe get her interested in books, that will build her own imagination.    I don't know how old she is, but the imagination is a wonderful thing to use.  I find the more creativity and imagination, the more well rounded the child.  That's my thoughts.    Your child is lucky to have a parent like you, who watches out for how she is developing.    You're on the right track...tv's shouldn't raise your (our) children.
hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Lish,    I think any loving parent who is not with their child(ren) has thoughts and dreams about and for their child(ren). We wonder what they look and act like, what their voices and laughter sound like, what inherited traits they might have from us, what they like to do, what their favorite color is, who their friends are, what kind of students they are,what it feels like to hug them, ...    Most of us struggle with birthdays, mother's/father's days, holidays with family gatherings, some of us have "remembrances", "rituals" or "reminders" that we think of/do/keep to hold on to a little piece of our children, many of us keep boxes, diaries, memory books, etc. of some sort to give to our children if we are ever able, lots of us write letters that have no address to be sent to...    I think most of us have a sometime or another imagined what our child(ren) are doing, if they are happy, what they look like when they are asleep and dreaming, what things they might enjoy, what kind of music they listen to, ....    I would even say many of us have pictured what it would be like to have them with us, to be there to sing them lullabies, to be able to put band-aids on skinned knees, to watch with pride their soccer matches, ballet recitals, graduation walks, to be at weddings and the births of our grandchildren...    I would bet quite a few of us have even squinted our eyes to imagine them into family photos, to guess their features from siblings, nieces and nephews and other relatives, to see our child(ren) walking towards us in the sunlight, to picture them next to us under the stars...    Most of us have imagined our child(ren) with their adoptive families, how much they are loved, how they are treated, what they are being taught, what they are being told...(and we hope it is all good)    The vast majority of us dream of reunions, of hugs, of building relationships, trying to make up/catch up for lost time, of apologizing, of being forgiven, of getting to tell our children we love them face to face and hoping desperately they will love us too...       "what is it like not knowing whether ur child is even alive or not?"  Agonizing, never-ending torture.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	My N mom said she always dreamed I would be on stage somewhere and she would instantly recognize me as her daughter. I am a performer, so it was pretty cool that she knew that, even though she had no idea, since my adoption was closed.      When I found her, she said there was never a day that went by that she didnt think of me .|`|9Ng5sqpnaa	Yes! I used to look at babies and then boys the age of my son - hoping that I would recognize him. Once I followed a young man around in a store in Ct. that I thought must look like my son. I stopped him and asked if he was born in pittsburgh and I think he thought i was a bit daft.   I was always sad on his birthday and holidays wishing that I could see him and know how he was.     It's horrible not knowing if your child is alive and well. It's like a physiological amputation - knowing that a part of you is out there somewhere.|`|7JEojMgQaa	I was my daughter, she was dark haired, dark skinned, dark eyed. that image stuck with me forever. I tried to visualize what she might look like at different stages of her life. I was wrong. Her skin lightened up, the hair went blond for a while in her early years, but the eyes stayed the same.    As far as that feeling of not knowing if your child is dead or alive, it is the most gut wrenching I have ever been through. Helpless comes to mind, even though I signed the papers to surrender my rights to her.    ETA: sorry, again, having lots of sleepless nights lately. That was I "SAW" my daughter, not I was my daughter. And I read it twice before posting.|`|HmkCFddAaa	I wondered about my mother didn't fantasize as I had seen pictures of her. But I always wondered how her life had turned out. Then I was told some information about her life and was happy for her. I honestly don't know if she ever did about me and my brothers. I only hoped that she has thought about us which I'm sure she has. I would think that any mother and hopefully a lot of fathers would wonder how their child was doing and  would hope they had a good life.|`|7oDK0w7qaa	You really should've rephrased that question.|`|DHyUnhS1aa	Some adoptees have fantasies.  The keyword is 'some'.  I imagine some birth parents do and some do not.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Sure, I imagined her to be happy with great parents and dancing lessons and a great singing voice.    Ya, it's hard not knowing if they are dead or alive.|`|AA11048627	i think it really depends on the person i know if it was me (even though it never will be) i would be thinking about them day in day out   i think about my 2 children even if im away from them for a few hours|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Depends on the person. If I had my child taken away I would spend every second of every day thinking about it. (That's from a woman who's baby hasn't even been born yet.)    But parents like my adopted sisters birth parents probably don't. They are given the chance to write to her twice a year, and, in the 7 years she has been living with my parents they have sent a grand total of one letter...which was scribbled in felt tip on the back of a piece of florescent pink gum paper.     It's sad that some people are like that towards their own children but it's a fact and for most the reason the kids were taken away in the first place. Of course if a woman was forced to give her child up for adoption because she was too young and her family were making her or whatever (as often happened as little as 50-60 years ago) I'm sure she'd constantly torture herself agonising over the thought of what her child was doing...|`|7uqOSZNKaa	love the way u generalise. not all parents of adopted children  'Gave them up'! some are forced to by the courts|`|vwTyihvvaa	Yes, both sides indeed have their fantasties about what the other looks like, what their hobbies are etc.     My biological parents, when they met me, I was everything they did not want. Chubby, a good student, etc. I could go on and on.     Before I met them, I wondered who I looked like, etc.     It is normal to wonder about stuff like this.|`|3X4i5Whvaa	This is a good question.    Yes, natural parents, if they have a closed adoption, do worry about their children's welfare.    And they wonder how their children have fared in life. they wonder about what traits and characteristics their children have inherited.    Because the natural parents already know their own heritage, they may have an  idea of what their children might look like.    I lost my son to adoption many years ago, and I knew that most of my family was very musical, so I expected my son to be musical and play the guitar. When I was reunited with him, he was, in fact a singer and guitar player and he and I played  guitar  together after we got to know each other.|`|oOzNMiKtaa	I think that all birth parents that gave their children up for adoption DO at some point in their life wonder about their children. Some think about it more then others in my opinion. Sometimes the parent can wonder so much that they try to find their child. The same goes with the child finding their parents.|`|bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	I know because my biological mother writes me letters that she did before I sent recent photos of her. She said she imagined me taller, with darker hair and darker skins (I'm practically an albino in disguise lol). So she must have had an image of me in her head for a while.
9Ng5sqpnaa	I named my son in 1966 and years later when we reunited, i got a copy of his obc.  The name i gave him was on it. Of course his adoptive parents changed his name totally.|`|1iGnpCukaa	I am sure, some do. My foster daughter named her son, even though she knew, she was giving him up for adoption.|`|AA10223196	Yes, my husband's birth name was Francis and his adoptive parents named him Charles.|`|bVRgrvDbaa	Not usually. The adoptive children that are named by biological parents are in the case where bio parents don't give up child until after they have baby and they decide they can't do it!|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	My daughter did and she has a birth certificate.  Then the adoptive parents named the baby when they took her home.|`|5c20d0d97944d554addc48e11c13abe3aa	It all depends on the birth parents. Some do and some don't, everyone is different. In my situation my biological parents split up shortly after my mom found out she was pregnant and the they both decided that they didn't want the each other to raise me on their own so my mom gave me up, but they had each chosen their own names for me.  My dad said he was thinking of Nichole and my mom was going to name my Shannon if she kept me.      Of course after my AP got me they named me Jennifer and immediately had my birth certificate changed and put their names on it. Apparently they didn't want me to have anything to do with my biological mom.      There's a good change that your BP chose a name for you but everyone is different so it's hard to say.      Ok I have a question for you now.   Have you ever considered looking for your birth parents?|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	I was told by the agency that I could not name her. I thought that was just the way it was.  So her name was baby girl G. She was in fostercare for 6 weeks due to a health problem (I had no idea) and she says her amom said she had a name but can't remember what it was. That was 37 years ago.|`|fdI8OtNeaa	I'd imagine they would, not on paper though, just in their own head|`|WoxMH0wZaa	I was given a name before I was adopted. It was Cherry....so as far as I'm concerned it's totally fine that my adoptive parents changed my name to Margarette (Maggie). Not that Cherry is a bad name, it's just not for me. I was not adopted until I was over a year old though...so it's kind of impossible to not give a child that old a name haha.|`|cnp21qZJaa	actually the mom to be can talk to the family who is going to adopt and they can decide what to call the child. i had a friend who gave her son up at birth, but she named him. she was (and still is) in contact with the adoptive family. he has started preschool and the family kept the name she gave him. most couples are so glad for the child they will gladly let you name it. and send you updates and photos if you want it.|`|vwTyihvvaa	My biological parents named me before I was put into foster care right after birth. Then when I was adopted by my foster parents I was still only two, then combined my first name, and middle name my biological parents gave me, then added their own choice for a middle name, after my adoptive mother's mom.     Some biological parents name the child, some do not.|`|NDEjwn6gaa	Yes and some times no it just depends|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Lish,    I named mine. The APs changed them. First, middle and (obviously) last as well. I use the names the APs chose but still think the ones I picked in my head.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Depends, my sister had a name. But she'd lived with her parents for 7 months before she was taken away...my parents changed her name and now she is old enough to have a say she tells us she much prefers the name my parents gave her to the one her biological mother did.|`|UVblLg4naa	Sometimes they do, and sometimes the adopted parents change it, because they want to make the baby their own.  Perhaps your birthparents gave you a name of their own, but let your adopted parents choose your official name.  I dunno if you could find it out through the agency or not.|`|bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	I was given my name by my biological family. I was with them for a short while, like about a month. I was named after my second cousin who died in a car accident ( I only just recently found that out).    My adoptive parents kept that name but gave me middle names and a surname that are all really long and impossible to spell!! I have five names in total. Gah I wish to change them one day.|`|j0xfBk5Caa	Justin Gage, I named him Justin Gage.|`|YkSPMvg5aa	Grapesgum-How do you know and how can you say that with such certainty?  I am an AP and ASKED to have the natural parents help name and asked if they had any ideas.  I also WANT my children to have connections with their natural family.  That isn't a fair statement all encompassing statement to make.    Yes, I believe most parents have an idea of what they'd like to name their child.|`|biqMTkWbaa	My sons first mother named him. The Only name that changed was his last name.|`|UO1QE8phaa	My mother did.    My a-parents gave me a completely different name but, as I was adopted in a CLOSED adoption (during the BSE), my APs didn't know the name my mother gave me.    I actually have 3 full names -- as my father also chose one that was different from the one my mother called me.    It's possible that I have another.  I have not, as yet, located my foster carers and I'm sure they must have called me something as I was with them for several weeks.    Things that make you go "Hmmmmmmm..."|`|yDWcYXl5aa	Some do, some don't.  Since we had an open adoption for our son, his first mom & I had chosen his name together, and she put it on his original birth certificate, along with my last name.  Ironically, we also chose a name together for his bio sister that she decided to keep, and she kept that name, even though it was after my Grandpa.    I've seen some birh cerificates filed, and basically, they'll have Baby Smith (or whatever the mother's name is).|`|HmkCFddAaa	My bio's parents named me and my adoptive parents kept my name. Just my last name was changed|`|xVahGNYyaa	In the UK when the natural mother registers the birth of her child she generally names her child at the same time.  I did even though my mother tried to persuade me not as we knew it was likely his name would changed.  As it turned out his first name was changed, middle name kept as it's his adad's first name.    My son searched for me but I found him as he joined a site and used his original name so within half an hour of me joining I found him.  I wasn't actively searching which made it even more special.  However I do call him by his adoptive first name, his original is private to me.|`|7JEojMgQaa	I didn't. I knew her parents were allowed to change it. I didn't want my daughter to grow up thinking I could have been a (insert name here) instead of who I am. As it turned out, her friends nicknamed her the name I would have probably given her. I say probably because I didn't actually do it. She now goes by both names anyway. Go figure.|`|SkDomhoXaa	i was given a name by my birth parent, but the middle name was dropped by my adoptive parents, mainly because i was 2yrs by the time the adoption went throught and they thought i would get confused by a name change at that age. that name was on my original birth certificate.|`|CRUNgkYVaa	when I gave birth to my son in 1966 I had every intention  of bring him home of course I named him he is my child,  just because I was coerced into signing the papers does not mean  I should not name him,on all the papers I have it has the name I gave him and my name also in the city of n.y. in the main library on 42st  they have a book for every year a child  is born in nyc in that book it is  MY NAME NEXT TO HIS  you can alter the obc but you can't alter  who the mother is|`|AkHj5xeSaa	I named mine. His AP's didn't keep the name, but they did use the first name I had chosen as one of his middle names.|`|Py1oiwYQaa	My daughter's mom chose not to name the baby, although she was asked if she wanted to. So the original birth certificate says "baby girl {last name}" . We named her the day after she was born, and she has always been called that, although it didn't become legal until her adoption was finalized at 8 mo. Her new birth certificate has the name we gave her (plus it looks like I gave birth to her in georgia - kind of wierd).|`|1uCZFaR2aa	My son was named at birth.  He was placed in a Guatemalan foster family at 3 days old.  I kept his birth-given first name.|`|dKK2Tjy6aa	Hi     My adoptive parents kept my original first and middle name, so just my surname changed.     I was adopted at 6 months|`|S5Lsbh0taa	Both of my kids first names were given to then by their birth mum. That's the way it stayed, they took on our surname. (They have beautiful names, carefully chose by her we figured why change it.)|`|EKfyEfC9aa	I named my daughter on her original birth certificate.  I gave her my mother's name (she passed away when I was 13) so no matter what she would always know she was loved that much.|`|jHZqOuVEaa	Yes, first parents usually give their babies a name before they give them away.  The adoptive parents usually change it.  Most adoptive parents do not want the child to have any connection to their natural family.|`|rbv1FH62aa	I gave birth to my daughter in 1964 when I was 18 yrs old...I was told in the hospital quite emphatically I was not allowed to name my daughter, because the aparents would do this (whoever they would be), even though I did have a name picked out for her.|`|2cj7Eai8aa	i named my child bcuz in the state of florida they have 2 birth certificates one with the birth parents name or baby & last name & one fo the a.ps when they choose it. It gives him apart of my family even though its just a name|`|bf3b2b9c36abf2f00330f6a72f6cedbaaa	I named my son. The adoptive parents changed it, of course, but all the records I have have the name I gave him on it.|`|WHAD4Ap2aa	my sister gave her little girl up for adoption, for protection of the child, her birth father was a drug addict and my sis was afraid of him coming to find her...anyway, she named her little girl emily but her adoptive parents renamed her april because she was born in april.|`|FUeW2EMUaa	yea my biologcal mother gave me the name Niamh when i was born and when my mother adopted me she chose to keep that name, she didn't have to but she did.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	First mothers have told me directly that they named their babies.  Sometimes that name wasn't officially documented, and put down as 'baby girl' or 'baby boy' despite the mother having given their child a name personally|`|XyU6oEVPaa	During the BSE, very few mothers got to name their babies.  We were told that we couldn't, didn't have the right.  I found upon reunion that my son was named by the Social Worker.|`|wsRCZ1Mtaa	yes, My mother named me, and my son's mother named him.    Most mothers name their babies-but especially in the 50's and 60's, and even into the 70's that name was never put on any paperwork.
G7DlDjJhaa	the bag thing is kind of weird no offense.  i just told her.|`|SWxBuzntaa	It was kinda hard telling my mom that I got my period I mean it was over the phone and she was drunk and I was alone at my house with my dad and older brothers... so it wasn't exactly tell my mom it was more of tell my dad which is SOOOO much more embarrassing and he made a lot more bigger a deal of it than a woman would.|`|cGRyDCpQaa	I called my mom on the phone  freaking out. I was so young I had no idea what it was. I thought I was dying, lol.|`|f4Ms77qzaa	I was 12, soon to be 13 and when I went to the washroom I saw a tiny bit of blood on my undies and I just told my mom that I had some blood on my undies and I asked her if I had my period and she said yeah...|`|HOdblqIkaa	That was quite a while ago but I don't think I ever actually told her. Were not that close so she would just buy pads and tampons for when my sister and I started and then buy more when she noticed we were low.|`|m5Qh7gYraa	I whispered it in her ear i told her there was blood in my underwear.|`|JERUmEFzaa	I was in the bathroom and I just told her LOL It`s no biggie :) I see it as peeing..|`|H4a6uSiyaa	Well, as a mother now, ust tell her! She does it too!|`|cnVUWDcUaa	Well, I was in my room and my dad came up to see me first. So I told him. He got all panicked and yelled down to my mom like I was dying or something. Then I went down and told her...    It was actually only a few days ago.|`|obN6p3Cgaa	Well that is not hard to do just tell her she was once your age too when she got hers.|`|nKSmgjylaa	I just came in and said "Nan, when I wiped down there there was blood. I think it's my period".  (:|`|D5NkT1dUaa	I was only 9 years old and didnt know about periods! I freaked out and said "MOM IM DYING IM BLEEDING ALL OVER!:'|`|0UOHex1Maa	Don't be scared! There's nothing to be scared of! Your mom knows that it'll come sooner or later.    I asked my mom how she told her mom, and then she looked over at me and asked if I had started. After that, she told me how it went, and then I got free ice cream! :D|`|rR5nIklWaa	dont be affraid to tell her  or even if u tell a older family member that u feel more cofterble with  then u both tell her its not a big deal   just remember that she was once ur age  just be like  ( mom we need to get  girl stuff at the drugstore ) i think shell get the hint|`|ozATw7s0aa	I threw my dirty underwear down the laundry shoot and she asked me if I did and I was like yeah and then it was over. lol.|`|ziCuHSy1aa	I recognized it, went to her room, and told her. Luckily it was just us home alone. Then she asked me if I knew how to put on a pad, which looked really easy, and she already bought me them. That was it.
aLAmvX5Naa	First of all teen mothers can give their kids a great life. If everyone who felt their child could have a better life with someone with more money, or someone who could be home more, or someone who had a better college degree, or whatever, no one would keep their kids. The reality of life is no matter how old your parents are, how much they are home, how much money they make, etc, doesn't matter. How much love you can give your child is the important thing.    Kids who grow up with second-hand clothes, store-brand food, and a small apartment can be just as happy as rich kids. Plus, you have 18 years to work on bettering yourself for your child's sake.    Ultimately it is your choice, but don't rush your decision. The other girls at this school are going through the same thing as you. The ones who already gave birth can help you prepare for it. Your friends at your current high school have a different life than you right now, they can't relate to what you are going through.    Plus, I bet at the other school you can get up to pee mid-class without a fight. They know pregnant women just gotta go sometimes!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It may be they want to ship you out so that you aren't a glamorous figure to the other teen girls in your school.   Make your choice, it would be a great option if you were keeping the baby - if not there is no reason to disrupt your school for a different option.|`|kwMA5I1iaa	How old are you?|`|T8zPA3FJaa	I was 15 when I fell pregnant with my son. I actually went to a school in Brisbane - Mable Park High, which had the POWER program from young mums, so you would be able to continue your education while you were pregnant/had a baby. It was essentially really good. Although I only went there for two terms, while I was pregnant and went right up until the day I was due. It helped tremendously, although after I gave birth I took a term off school and then went back to the school I went to before I went to mable park as I found my old school (Park Ridge), offered better quality education - I knew the teachers, my friends were there, so it made it much easier for me to finish my education. Finished my high school education was the best decision I ever made for myself and my son, as now I go to uni and am gaining a qualification so I can support my son without the help of centrelink. My son recently started prep - he is happy, healthy and we have a really close relationship. I am now pregnant with my second child (this one planned) and am engaged (not to my son's father).   All I can say is by finishing your education you can most definitely still give your baby a great life. And to me it sounds like you have really good support from your parents which also helps!!|`|21Lnhdfeaa	My sister was in this position with her first child when she was a senior in high school.  This is not a decision to enter into lightly, however, if you don't think that you can give the baby the kind of life you think he deserves, then I would definitely recommend adoption.  There are several options in this; including open adoption (which is what my sister did).  She got to choose the family that her son went to, name him, and even see him from time to time.  He knows that she's his birth mom, but his adopted mother is always mommy.  It turned out that she made the best decision for him as he had several health and developmental problems (which were unpredictable at the time) and could not have afforded to take care of him the way that he needed.  He's 15 years old now and is doing great.  We get pictures of him whenever his parents can't afford to actually bring him for a visit.  It was the best thing she could have done for him and herself.  But it's hard and it's not for everyone.  It might be worth looking into.|`|fMnzjULCaa	I don't really think age is irrelevant to the question. If you are 13 years old, I would probably tell you that adoption would be the best choice for you. If you are 17 years old (meaning you are almost an adult) I would tell you either way could work. There are plenty of loving families out there who are dying to adopt a child. Plus having a child will cause you to miss out on a lot. Depending on how old & if the school for mommies offers it, proms, formals, homecoming, ect. Graduating w/ the kids you've grown up w/. Probably going away to a good college (but not necessarily, I know a lot of moms who are in college). Turning 21 & partying (if you are into that thing). I did so much partying from the time I was 18-21 (not hardcore, just drinking), I was ready to give it up by the time I got pregnant w/ my first (at age 26). Also, I have a cousin who got pregnant at 18 & lives at home w/ her parents. One thing nobody ever realized would happen is that she never has a baby-sitter for time to herself. Her mom watches the baby when she goes to school (college) & lives w/ the baby full time, there are no relatives on the dad's side. So if mom & dad need a night out, it's too bad. My cousin faced a lot of strange looks from people & she was 18, but I don't think she's ever regretted keeping him. You are never going to experience the love like you have for a child. It may be tough at times but I don't think you will ever really wish you gave your baby up if you decide to keep him/her. I think the school sounds wonderful & if there is anyway you can figure out the financial situation, it would be so helpful. You should be very proud of yourself for the two options you have chosen. I would discuss w/ your parents & do what is best for you.|`|PN7ELn3aaa	You are handling a rough situation with a lot of maturity and responsibility! Kudos!    The special school will offer you loads of benefits, even if you aren't planning on keeping the baby after birth. They will be much more lenient with doctor's appointments, sick days and even general support.     You will be around other girls your age in the same situation, it will be nice to have people to relate to instead of girls who haven't the slightest idea of what you are going through.     It's up to you! But I can see benefits of going there.|`|bQk0vpfSaa	i would suggest it only if you are 15 or 16|`|AA10652271	You have to do what is right for both you and your baby. You have a big decision to make ( adoption) and I wish you the bst.|`|apUkTo3maa	I WAS 16 WHEN I GOT PREGO I WAS IN 11TH GRADE. I WAS WITH MY BF AND WE WANTED TO KEEP THE BABY. WE HAVE BEEN GOING OUT SINCE I HAD JUST TURNED 15. WE DECIDED TO KEEP HIM. AFTER I HAD MY SON I TOOK 6 WEEKS OUT OF SCHOOL. AND THEN WENT BACK TO SCHOOL. I MISSED ALOT OF SCHOOL BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE AT HOME WITH THE BABY I HAD GOTTEN A JOB AND MCDONALD'S ALSO. I ENDED UP HAVING TO MAKE UP 100 HOURS FOR SCHOOL. AND I DID IT AND ALSO GRADUATED AT 17. MY SON IS NOW MY PRIDE AND JOY. ME AND HIS FATHER ARE NOW MARRIED. I AM 21 NOW. MY SON IS 4. I LOVE HIM TO DEATH. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT FIND MY STORY INTRESTING.....|`|wZAeBisbaa	A lot depends on what your other options are.  My daughter is a teen mom who goes to her regular high school.  She is fortunate that I am able to provide some child care, and her baby goes to a day care the rest of the time.  Her teachers are all very willing to work with her by understanding that she must miss classes occasionally and by being flexible on accepting assignments and tests.  With this good support system, she is doing very well in a competitive academic environment.  Like you, she had no desire to attend a program for teen mothers, because they did not offer the college prep courses that she wanted.      I think if you're considering adoption, then you should definitely stay where you are.  If you do decide to give up your baby, you will need to have your friends and familiar environment for support, and you will want to be in a place where life is about something other than pregnancy and motherhood.       Good luck with your decision.  Having a baby does not mean the end of your education, regardless of where you go or what you decide to do.|`|x0Ftr35Laa	I got pregnant my senior year. I stayed the rest of year and graduate there. However I almost didn't graduate. I was sick and doctor's appointments and had too many absences and tardies. My case had to go before the school board.    If you are not keeping the baby and want to give it a good life, a school like this will still be beneficial. They will be more sensitive to your emotional needs as well doctor's appointments and stuff.     Adoption can be a very good thing and there are adoption agencies out there that will allow you to pick and meet the family that your baby goes to.     I wish you the best, I'm glad to hear that someone is trying to make the best out of a bad situation and trying to do the best for their baby and not just get an abortion.|`|ynZVkBcdaa	i think you should do whats best fro you and your baby adoption may be your pro choice but you have a wonderful life in you and you should think about keeping it i know a friend who gave her baby up for adoption and it breaks he heart everyday because she had a chance to get to know and love a little life that was a big part of her just like your baby is a big part of you just keep in mind that whenever you abort a baby or give it away your killing or giving that special part of you that could have made you smile and love so much. god luck tho with your choice.|`|cnp21qZJaa	ok i havent gone through it, but i did (and do) know some girls that did go through it. they went through school- when it was time for them to deliver- they did their studies from home, did recoup time, and came back to school. our school was willing to work with the girls. if yours isnt (im not saying this is so) then id check into the school. these girls are now successful women, that have some wonderfully cared for kids. ones a firefighter. dont let anyone try and convince you dont have any options. you always have options! there are all kinds of government programs available to help you.
qIHTmouhaa	Have it at your house. You can buy streamers and balloons at the dollar store for about a dollar or two. I dunno if Wal-Marts around your way do it but around here they give free cakes out for the first birthday. Get your ice cream from wal-mart also. I have noticed that anywhere I've went it has not beaten the price of Wal-Mart ice cream. Make your own drink at home or just buy a couple gallons of tea and a couple two liters of soda. Don't over do it with the invite list because then you'll have to many people to buy for just invite close friends and relatives. I hope I helped a little bit I'm planning a birthday party also my lil one will be one on the 18th (as you can see by my name) but his b-day party is on the 21st. So I know what your going through.    Good luck! And happy birthday to your little one.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	Have family and friends over for cake, ice cream, tea & coffee since one is an age that your baby can't do much, nor remember anything. It's more for you to celebrate, so have your family and friends come over! plus it'll only cost for cake and ice cream and they'll be gone in about 3 hours.|`|DnyyyGeEaa	You can buy like 4 medium pizzas at like dominoes for 20.00 then cut the slices again so they are smaller and go to the dollar store to get paper plates and decorations.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	make your own cakes. get cheap latex balloons, no need to go out on that. make your own confetti. make your own invitations! make your own finger foods instead of buying a bunch of expensive food. on the invitations specify that "snacks will be provided" that way you don't get landed with feeding everyone that comes an actual meal! have it between 2 and 4 that way lunch should have already been eaten and its still too early for dinner (i know it seems mean, but you gotta do what your wallet will let you!)    happy birthday to your little one!!|`|aSuUlxcsaa	I think that you should just have a little party at home but make it look big. Put up plenty of decorations. They sell cheap banners and streamers at any Dollar Store or Wal-Mart. Get low priced food at any grocery store with frequents sals, like Aldi's or Jewel's or Wal-Mart. Ask a friend to dress up as entertainment. A clown or princess, or wizard or something the kids will just have fun by looking at. Make the cake yourself. Make sure the icing on top is even and then just put colored icing in a Zip-lock bag and cut a small hole. You can squeeze it gentely and use it as a writing utincil to write "Happy Birthday".    Hope I helped.|`|ht8QH8XZaa	Any birthday should be focused around the birthday person therefore I suggest you not to do it because at one the baby will not have an idea what is going on. Instead save the money until he is three or four and make that his first birthday party when it will be much more meaning full.  It's what I did and was able to save lots of money and when the party happened I didn't hesitate to spend and invite lots of friends|`|AA11885437	We bought a pack of balloons for decorations and had them blown up at the local grocery store for pretty cheap.

ubo0HWtVaa	oh my, that baby should be coming very soon, like maybe today!!! basically your cervix need to be completely thinned out and your almost there and your water break even if your not efaced if i'm not mistaken. but usually you feel a pop in your belly before water breaks naturally. walk do squats and pay attention to your body- cramping like a period usually means contractions!!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Wow you're almost there! :) I was 2cm dilated, 80% effaced at 6am, and by Midday I was 10cm, 100% effaced!  No not necessarily. From what I can remember, my waters broke before I was 100% effaced. Good luck with everything!
8OyLAvxOaa	Use a proxy.    Try to find out the IP address for the site and use that.    Use an alternative site.    Use things such as BabelFish to 'translate' the website so you can view the videos.|`|wU5xINg4aa	oooooo That Sucks maybe have a talk with your dad?    go on a proxy server website and enter the website the problem is things like netnanny are cracking down on proxy servers|`|0UOHex1Maa	You don't have to go to the website.  Get a life.    Sicko.|`|kwMA5I1iaa	Deal with it. When you are 18, you will be able to do whatever you want...although when you are under your parents roof, you abide by their rules.

Wait until you are 18.|`|iZk9jEBpaa	I used to have net-nanny when i was a little kid, she must be the most hated nanny in the world haha.     At least you will learn some self control/patience|`|Kg5KX432aa	LOL   use a proxy server site    www.tophide.com  www.webproxylist.org  www.proxysites.net  www.proxystreet.com     that way he'll only see those sites and not the other ones you're going on|`|AA10064810	I have no idea what redtube is.  If you feel it is appropriate to look at it, show you dad what is on it.  Oops, just did a search.  House of Porn?    You will be better off not looking at this stuff until you are older.  Until then, you can daydream and find a girlfriend when the time is right.  You don't need to desensitize yourself and warp your view of women/sex/relationships.  You won't believe that, but it does happen.  What happened to sneaking Playboy?    As for getting around blocks, my nephew was able to get around all blocks but I think it ended up as a game to irritate his mom.  Her reasons were valid for a child living in her home, dependent on his parents.  My advice:  drop the porn until you are out on your own, supporting yourself, and have bought yourself a car and can make the payments, gas, and insurance.|`|9erSLvYMaa	It's not difficult to bypass those sorts of programs. Hell, had my parents ever put something like that on my computer I would have had it either uninstalled, deactivated, or otherwise rendered harmless (say by blocking its ports) within 5-10 minutes. Even if you don't know how to do that there's plenty of proxy sites out there that you can use, though it may flag those as well since no one ever goes to a proxy server for normal browsing purposes (well, except for extremely paranoid people at least).

WWcaKZ7Qaa	Orange juice got the baby moving a lot so that was neat to see. Also, even if your baby is not moving much they will probably still be able to tell unless they are in an awkward position. Good luck, have fun, it's so awesome to see them for the first time!!!|`|75l2smfCaa	I heard eating a chocolate candy bar so the baby is all hyped up on sugar :) You want the tyke to move and not be so stubborn.|`|DnyyyGeEaa	drink lots of water then right before you go in drink a really sugary juice and the baby will be awake|`|emf7RiPTaa	try orange juice|`|rR5nIklWaa	aww good luck thats the most exciting ultrasound to go to  but u really cant do any thing  that baby is going to be  the way  it wants to be  but the ulrasound person  will  push on ur tummy hard and  tell u to oll on ur side|`|IurAMoIDaa	hi,    drink plenty of water and don't go to the loo before you have your scan!    good luck!|`|AA11763588	Drink some OJ right before you go, usually caffine or sugar will wake the little one up and make them active.|`|B3jpU4Jraa	just let the doctor do it so you dont have to worry|`|v0GwTTsVaa	Organge Juice makes the baby move a lot.  Just make sure you have a full bladder when you go in.|`|P2iqvxw4aa	Well i know with mine she was able to tell no problem. It really depends on the position of the baby because if they close or cross their legs there's no way to see... best advice i have is doing a bit of walking around... other than that i don't think there is too much you can do except hope for the best :).|`|FdQD8H3qaa	I had some OJ before and I at some sweets..  We were able to tell both times but if the baby is in a bit of bad position try to push on your tummy to see if the baby will move or get up walk around the room a bit  and then try again...|`|GxlkhRfoaa	I haven't tried this myself but I saw an ultrasound video where the person doing the ultrasound wiggled the woman's stomach back and forth to uncross the baby's legs.  Good luck!
dPyfP0ijaa	Cold turkey. It'll be a pain for a few days, but she'll get over it. Introduce her to the sippy cup, let her take it to bed but only with water.    Another thing I tried was replacing milk with water in the bottle, they might get over it faster.    My son screamed so hard when I took his bottle away, he made the neighbors in our apartment think I was beating my child . . . the police came. He threw a huge fit, kicked the walls at bedtime, but it only lasted a few days. When they are that young, things like that become a thing of the past very quickly, but you have to get rid of them all, don't keep a "spare" around, don't give in.|`|bbtosxyJaa	you can either    1) explain to her that at 2 years old she is a "big girl" and they don't drink from bottles. You can take it away and give her a special cup instead    or    2) Slowly ease her off by cutting a bit of the nipple everyday until she can no longer suck out of it and will be forced to drink out of a cup.|`|2QM2k4U4aa	it takes time and patience but you will be able to do it , start with zippy cups let her know that she is becoming a big girl know and like mommy she need to drink from a cup     at least that's how it worked for me and my son !  good luck :D|`|IA5zVfk0aa	my mom would sit us by the trash can and say,.. " say bye bye to bottles, its time to be a big girl now" and threw them away and that was it. we cried for a little and got over it|`|E15fLONGaa	Throw them out and endure a couple days of crying.  Your pediatrician should have had you do this months ago.  Have your daughter help you throw them out, and try to treat her with something she likes since she is now a 'big girl'.|`|VNC6UieFaa	I would try just giving her a drink of water if she wants it if not then let her kick and scream and get angry because she will soon realise that she has too go to sleep with that or without and then she will calm down about it soon its not as rhough she is hungry and needing it so dont give up keep trying persivere goodluck!``

Babies should be when we are all ready and can enjoy them-I get your stress|`|6zVISNTZaa	It's very unlikely as you've had 2 periods and a negative test. Possibly it could be the stress from all this delaying your period. Go to the doctor, tell him the situation, and see what he suggests.

L5Fe4yvQaa	Abortion is a really hard topic. It's one of the things that people do and then immediately try to forget/act as though it didn't happen/block, and this can lead to serious depression on top of the obvious reasons. I had an abortion 3 years ago, and sometimes I still break into tears about it, but I let myself accept it, had family to support me, and I was able to grow from experience. How old is she? Did her family/friends/boyfriend support her decision or where they against it? Did she want to actually do it or was she forced (by herself or others)?   Maybe you should sit down with her and try and talk it out. She might just need someone who can hear her side completely, without bias. Maybe she was never able to vent it out, and it's been building inside for the past six months killing her more every day. She needs to know that yes it is natural to be depressed, but it is not natural to keep it all inside. History has shown that bottling things up always ends bad. If you cannot help her, then do try to convince her to go to a support group. If nothing can help her, maybe she should go on some temporary antidepressants until she is strong enough to face what has happened.    It's impossible to not have regrets, but that cannot be a reason to stop living your life because you couldn't give up your own for another at the time. Remind her of tomorrow, and hope for the best.   Hope this helps!|`|pJiTbIpYaa	I am Pro-choice so you wont get a lecture from me. Every woman has a right to have an abortion.  Now, i recommend that your friend seek Professional help. Even if she sees he GP to discuss the matter. It is a traumatic experience for many women and i believe quite a lot of them have these feelings after having an abortion. I have never had an abortion but i have supported many friends who have. Let me say that you are helping her already by being a friend and not hurling abuse at her like so many have and will. Try looking up Abortion Support Groups on your search bar on the internet.    Why don't you ladies just answer the question accordingly instead of being b!tches.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I think about mine all the time but do I regret it? No, I was 17 and I was not a very mature 17 year old. I did not drive, work, totally depended on my parents on everything, I was selfish. Me and my now husband had only been dating a few months he decided to join the army and was in boot camp when I found out I was pregnant. I think about how different my life would have been if I kept the baby. I know I made the right decision for my life and I love how my life has turned out. Now 4 years later we are expecting a little girl in May when we are ready and can handle having a child without any assistance from anyone. oponion|`|Td8XLuDkaa	I think she should seek medical help they tell you after you get an abortion were you can go for support groups but she shouldn't be depressed still it works kinda like a women going crazy over her hormones and she should definitely be back to normal either soon or about 3 months ago|`|FKf67HXaaa	i have never had one but i was thinking about it once. i heard everyone who gets one regrets it and sometimes if you get one you may never be able to have kids again. its normal for her to feel that way she did the wrong thing and now she is realizing it. srry but it da truth|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	she deserves every bit of pain and suffering she gets, i dont think anyone should help her.      (unless she got an abortion for a medical reson)       other then that I say LET HER SUFFER      and yea, you should post this in mental health and womans health, the bulk of answers your gonna get here arnt gonna be nice, 99% of us in this section are pregnant or trying to get pregnant. we dont wanna hear about baby killers|`|6bc1f629a527af3db8edd2c03bf1bc9caa	I don't regret it, but it does make me sad. It is a really hard choice to make, and even if it's truly for the best, it doesn't make it hurt any less. It's been four years since mine and it's still not something I can think about without being saddenned. If she's showing serious signs of depression, I suggest seeking a counselor. It's good that you're being there for her. Sometimes all it takes is someone to listen. Maybe she could try writing down what she's feeling too, sometimes that's easier than saying it.|`|3WSiJU5Raa	who wouldn't...i mean they are killing their child.|`|p68DUZhCaa	tell her its ok. everyone has the right to have an abortion. no one on the other hand has a right to judge unless they were in her shoes so ignore the unnecessary comments below. some advice from me is that she did it for a reason, it just wasn't the right time for her to have a child. having a baby is 24/7 job and of course its hard. if she is still dwelling on her abortion she had 6 months ago its time for some psychiatric help. she clearly is not even mentally stable to have a child so she did the right thing. no one can make her feel better but herself. she needs to let go and move on, she has plenty more eggs if she ever wants to get pregnant again lol. either way she needs to figure out her emotions and take it from there because it think its more of a "did i do the right thing" situation. good luck to both of you.

If you have sex, there's a good chance you'll get pregnant.  I'm assuming you had sex, but perhaps I'm mistaken.|`|UXCMonnDaa	Madeleine Faith & Benjamin Jackson are both lovely, sorry for your loss and wishing you a happy and healthy pregnancy|`|wi4XXfCEaa	Let's see, I like:  Andrew  Chase  Emmett  Noah  Tyler  Lucas  Ryan  Alexander  Cole  Sebastian  James  Eli  Landon  Scott  and Kristopher but spelled Christopher    For the boy, my overall favorites are:  Andrew Chase  Lucas Ryan  Sebastian James  Landon James    For the girl, I like:  Rose  Audrey  Kate  Emily  Elisabeth  Madeleine  Isabel/Isabelle over Isabella  Gracie instead of Grace  Catherine instead of Katherine  Nora instead of Norah  Ann instead of Anne    Overall I like Audrey Kate the best!!    Ideas;  Catherine Audrey  Elisabeth Holly  Nora Catherine  Deborah Ann    Great Names, I really like your taste!|`|CxRJwJsraa	First off, so sorry about your loss...But congrats on the pregnancy!! I've always heard that getting pregnant again soon is the best medicine for losing a baby. (I've also heard that you are like extra fertile after a m/c, so perhaps that could explain some things?)    on to names:  Boys:  Rylan Benjamin- I'm not big on Rylan, but I LOVE Benjamin!  Benjamin Dillon - I really like this!!  Declan Andrew- nice, but Andrew feels a bit boring.  Jackson Chase- nice enough, but both names feel popular.  Jacob Emmett- It's nice, but I'd prefer the reverse: Emmett Jacob  Zachary Noah- cute.  Andrew Chase- cute, but nothing that grabs me.  Christian Tyler- cute.  Lucas Ryan- cute.   Liam Ethan- I really like Liam...Ethan is cute. I'm just not sold on the combo.  Justin Alexander- I don't care for Justin, but Alexander makes a great middle.  Blake Adam- not big on Blake, but LOVE Adam as a middle name.  Tristan Cole- Really like Tristan. Cole is cute but feels a bit mismatched with Tristan.  Kristopher Glenn- I'd prefer Christopher. But I like the combo! (I also like Glen as a middle name for a girl)  Sebastian James- lovely. I usually prefer James as a first name and Sebastian as a middle name though.  Brian Patrick- aww, I really like this. I have a soft spot for the name Brian and Patrick is really sweet with it   Ryder Colton - I'm not a fan of Colton. But I like Ryder! Together the combo just feels a little overly horsey.   Jasper Eli- LOVE it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I really like Jasper (it's my kitty's name) and I know an adorably little Eli.  Riley August- cute! But I'd prefer the reverse: August Riley.  Aden Wyatt- cute. Aden (I prefer the spelling Aidan) is VERY common/popular though.  Landon James- cute.  Braden Scott- not a fan of Braden.  Benjamin Jackson- cute, even though I'm not big on Jackson, but as a mn, it's cute.    Girls:  Isabella Grace - Isabella is pretty, but Isabella Grace just sounds very expected.  Katharine Rose- I love this though.   Audrey Kate- cute. I get a very Hepburn feel too.  Gabrielle Hope- I like Hope, but prefer her as a first name. But I really dislike Gabrielle (don't really know why.)  Juliana Kai- cute.  Emily Addison- I like Emily, but I prefer her with sweet oldfashioned names. Addison just isn't my thing.  Sadie Elisabeth- cute.  Briony Autumn- LOVE LOVE LOVE Briony. Autumn is cute  Norah Amber- I kinda like this, even though I'm not big on Amber.  Evelyn Jade- I don't like Jade, but Evelyn is sweet.  Grace Angeline- cute. I'd really love Emily Angeline or Briony Angeline though...those are GAH-JUSS  Jillian Autumn- cute.  Madeleine Faith- not bad. I like Madeleine, but Faith does nothing for me.  Gemma Anne- cute. Though I prefer Anne as a first name.|`|CRvdmFwCaa	I like   Rylan Benjamin the best from the boys  Landon James too.    and    Madeleine Faith for the girls....

I really like "Aden Wyatt", but I would spell it "Aiden".  Also really like "Landon James" and "Braden Scott".  For the girls, maybe "Isabella Grace" - it sounds so angelic or innocent.  I always like "Jasmine" myself, and I don't have kids, so feel free to use it, lol...  ; )|`|15UZwW2laa	I love the name Isabella Grace...it's the same name I had picked out too.  LOL.

mCbe2a67aa	I'm married, but my husband works, so it's not exactly like your situation, but when our son was born I was convinced I'd be ok by myself taking care of the baby while my husband was away. After two weeks, I was all "Nope, not gonna happen". So I went to my mom's everyday for the first three months of my baby's life. It's not that I had my mom take care of him, but it was so much nicer and easier to have someone else around, just to be able to talk to. I found it very difficult being by myself without anyone around. Especailly in the early months when you're still dealing with hormones and sleep deprivation, it can seriously be draining. But, my mother was very supportive of our pregnancy from the outset, so I'm not sure what I would have done had she not been supportive. I just know that regardless of your marital status, whether you are a single parent or not, it's truly important to have people (other than your baby) around. You need to see other people and have adult interaction or you will get super burnt out, super quickly.     At least that's how it was for me. I needed people around to get me through the hardest part of parenthood.     Good Luck and congrats on your new addition.|`|LWwGW48Daa	Well, perhaps your new location will have people who are supportive of you. I agree get away from the non supporters

XNsqOcy6aa	It sounds like she is making her descend! I had to be induced with my first baby because he was warm and cozy and didn't want out! LOL    I have a friend who this has happened to. She was 32 weeks pregnant and the baby was "in her crotch." Sitting, sex and everything in between was uncomfortable.     Hopefully your doctor will be able to tell you what exactly is going on. Good Luck!
381bc01ff9a0d000383e935fd5d4d532aa	ok lets see...  he has a gf  hes mean to u  ...why do u care about what he thinks??  not worth it
3dSCbIcEaa	it all sepends on u and your baby.  i didnt start showing until 7 months with my first and with my second i was showing by 4 months.|`|nHpd4lRXaa	I was 124 pounds before pregnancy, and am 5' 3", I didn't start showing until about 6.5-7 months. I was a late shower...but by the time I was 41 weeks, I could hide a basketball behind my belly.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Everyone starts to show at different times.  I didn't start to show until I was 6 months along, but most people start to show with their first at 5 months.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	maybe around month 4 or 5 just depends really how fast and where the baby is sitting you will feel it in your pants though in about 2-3 months|`|386a963813ca4483b7e0c94d14801a97aa	That depends on how fast your baby grows and how much water you retain. Most times a person your size will show by 4 months but sometimes it takes longer. Everybody is different so its hard to say for sure. Good luck.|`|AOfm8ey6aa	Every woman is different. Some show very early, like 4 months, some never do! I was visibly pregnant since 7 months my first pregnancy and since about 5 months the second. I am not too overweight (just about 15 pounds over when i got pregnant both times), about average size woman.|`|cfdooGylaa	No one can give you a definite answer because its different with each person and each pregnancy. I am small like you. I started off at 5'3 and 117 lbs and began showing at 7 1/2 months. Good luck and congrats|`|LkRP4OKaaa	No later than the fourth-fith month.One of my friends didnt show till right at fith month.I started showing at about 3-4|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Usually around 5 months or so. Until about the 14th week your uterus is still behind your pelvic bone and is unable to push out your stomach. Anything before that is just normal bloating.|`|lA3FqLUfaa	Well, if this is your first pregnancy, you probably won't show until about 20 weeks, earlier if this is your second pregnancy or more. Good luck!|`|d1d16f976ab4af78c06d3dc29088aab7aa	honestly, if this is your first child. It can be up to 5-6 months before you start showing.     This is my first, i'm currently 13 weeks. and just barely getting a bump in my lower abdomen. but i was already a little thick in my waist area. so it's gonna be a while.  I read that it's because your muscles are stretching in your stomach area.. and my doctor told me it's completely normal. if you are really thin in your tummy area, you may start showing at about 4 months.|`|934af622bc1085e84a5e331e725d5a1caa	You can Start showing as early as 3 months along
Ybo6HS8Caa	Maybe sit down with her and make a list of everything she does.  Possibly if she could see it in black and white, it may make her realize how dangerously close to overload she really is.  However, if her grades aren't suffering, and she isn't becoming unhealthy over it, I personally wouldn't bug her about it too much.  The things she is doing now show great strength of character, and sounds to me like she is a very responsible young lady.  It is a proven fact that teens that are involved in activities such as these are less likely to experiment with drugs/alcohol, less likely to become teen parents, and more likely to succeed.  All the things you have mentioned will also look great on her college applications.|`|7ulaznL1aa	Just help her realize what she's doing and what she's getting into. If she believes she can handle it, let her. She can always quit something if it becomes too much. You are lucky that she wants to be so involved in extra curricular activities and not into other bad teenage things.  The things she's doing will look wonderful to future colleges as well.|`|8bf22a7b300866a77ba08f820aaefdcaaa	Honestly, if she can pull off the good grades and do all of this stuff, let her and support her immensely with all of this.    This will help her out greatly when college comes. She'll most likely get a full ride and get into whatever college she wants.    If her grades start to drop, then talk to her and tell her she needs to pick a certain amount of things max to do.
nvkTBThAaa	Taking the Morning After Pill completely changes your cycle.  So you can't really expect your period when you should have gotten it, and I'm not sure how taking it twice will affect you.  Reagardless, a pregnancy test is too early at this point.  Wait a couple weeks and if you haven't gotten your period then you can test, but as long as you took the morning after pill as directed, your chances of getting pregnant are drastically lessened.|`|ibJIXDOHaa	Are planning on marring this man if not than you missed up big time, do you see each other every six months, because that a lot of sex in two days and then to do it again knowing he didn't wear a condom the first time. You wanted to get pregnant. Not trying to be hard on you but a girl did this to my brother.|`|78g6hd2Caa	be more careful.  noone will be able to tell if you are pregnant, but yourself or a doctor.|`|Oq1YMErhaa	I honestly can't believe you put THAT MUCH DETAIL into that question... A simple "haven't had my period... I'm i screwed in the bad way or the good?" would have done just fine.    wowwowwowwowwowwowwowwowwowwowwowwow|`|U1h6Dntjaa	Knowing that semen can get you pregnant and not wanting to be pregnant and yet letting him come inside you what, eight? times is really absurd.  It's as if you want to be pregnant.  And how does a condom slip off?  They break, but the only way they fall off is if the erection goes bye-bye.      Too late for regrets.  If the morning after pill didn't work, then oh well.  Go get that abortion you always knew was waiting for you.  I mean it's not like you thought having unprotected sex was safe, was it?  Nawww.|`|AA11777322	You have probably messed yourself up you don't use the morning after pill as a form of birth control.  You need to see a doctor.  And if you are not trying to get pregnant then use protection.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	i think you should go on birth control, its not 50 collars every time  you boyfriend or whoever decides to c u m in you. sometimes the Dr give it to you free. also the morning after pill is really bad for you. you should NOT just take it because its available.|`|urJIlSBQaa	A "bigger problem?"  I think the problem is that you allow him to ejaculate inside of you.  You do know that is what causes conception !!    If you don't want babies, stop doing that!|`|AA12298409	Ouch I think you had better take another pregnancy test. Being it is so early take it first thing in the morning. Good Luck.|`|XEmYfHl2aa	ithink you might be pregnant .|`|yo0qnedIaa	Eeek, I think you may be preg.  Take another test asap.    Good luck hun !
AA12016833	Girl, if you want to use condoms as a back up for your birth control. Go right ahead! If your boyfriend finds out your on birth control and he can't respect that you still want to use condoms, then obviously there is a big problem. You are opening your legs for him, so he needs to respect you and what you feel comfortable with. Honestly, i was on birth control for 2 years without using a condom with my boyfriend and i never got pregnant because i never missed a pill. ever...but if pregnancy scares you that much then you need to tell your boyfriend how you feel and just be honest.|`|AA12342788	Ok so i have the same problem heres what happens,  unless you take the pill at the exact same time every day, like i mean exact same within 5 mins everyday then your not completely protected 100% from pregnancy. Yea its alot safer now, but I wouldnt risk not wearing a condom. Anyway, definatly lie, i just told my bf i was on acne medication, and it worked. Its really none of his business what medicine your on or arnt on.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	If you can't discuss the need for him to wear a condom and he doesn't respect you enough to wear one when he's with you maybe you should reconsider a sexual relationship with him.  He needs to be mature enough to understand that it protects both of you.    That being said, you can take the pill anytime of day, just make sure it's the same time every day.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	yeah just dont tell him about it. you can take it any time in the day or night that you want as long as you take it at approximatly the same time daily or nightly.       good luck|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	You can do whatever you want. It sounds like lying in this situation would be the most beneficial to everyone involved. If you don't want to lie you might consider letting him know that some women still get pregnant on the pill and that if he doesn't want to wear a condom, then you guys can't have sex. He'll choose the condom over no sex, trust me. Also, you have to keep in mind that you don't need to prevent just pregnancy but also STDs. People seem to forget about that. Even if you think you are in a monogamous relationship, sometimes you aren't.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	The pill is not 100% effective and you can still get pregnant (although rare that it does happen).  Just tell your b/f that you don't like the mess and that why you want him to wear one.  Either that or you could tell him that you cant be on the pill because it make you very sick, but still take it anyway.  It is very responsible of you to be asking him to wear a condom and very stupid of him to not want to.    Oh....and its complete bullsh*t about men saying that it "doesnt feel good" when wearing a condom.  They are so thin now that it feels like nothing at all.    Take the pill the same time every day.  This can be in the morning, at lunch or at night.  I really dont think that you would need to hide the pill from your mom.  She will be very happy that you are taking responsibility for your own life.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Good for you for wanting to be responsible.  This might sound awful, but I don't think that you should tell him.  You won't be lying to him, you just won't be telling him everything.  If he is so dead set against condoms, you could ask to be fitted for a diaphragm when you get your birth control, but I still wouldn't tell him about it.  You can take it at any time that works for you, as long as you are good about taking it at that same time every day.|`|3e638d6ab3495c81d3dddc1fcb75f972aa	if you feel strongly enough to ask us this ,then your minds made up i think, you going on the pill is a confidentiality issue between you and your GP so why tell anyone if you don't want too?,|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Yes, you can take it later. No lying. Tell him you do not want to get pregnant!!!  Pills alone are not 100%....neither are condoms. Both together sound like a plan to me.|`|z7w6xyOKaa	You could get the depo shot. That way you wouldn't have to worry about hiding anything and you'd be protected.|`|qFvHH6lUaa	You should be on the pill.  You should still make him wear a condom.  If you stop all of a sudden, he'll know somethings up anyway.  You can take the pill any time of day as long as you take it at the same time everyday.  Some women get a little nauseous so it helps to take it in the morning when you've got something in your stomach.      Also, don't fall for any of that I hate condoms crap.  Remind him that at this point his life, he'll probably dislike being a daddy more.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	You wont get pregnant on the pill if you take it correctly.
FNjUT8n4aa	personally, i had registered at the hospital i was delivering at prior to my due date so i didnt have to deal with the paper work so if u already did that, they'll take u into a check up kinda room to see if how often ur contracting, how dilated u are, and take info on how u feel basically, they'll check ur cervix, if they feel they need to keep u, then they'll hook u up to the IV and take u to the room ur gonna deliver at and if u want the epidural at that point they'll give it to u, if not then they just have u chill while they hook up all the machines to monitor ur contractions and ur baby's heart beat.    is that what u meant by what process?? lol sorry if its not.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	From my experience, I was shown to a room and made comfortable. I was checked to see how dilated and effaced I was, and then offered the relevant pain relief for how I far i'd progressed. I was then "left to it" and checked on every half hour or so. I was checked again to see how dilated I was every 2 hours.|`|HjyUoM8eaa	i think it depends on your hospital.  at my hospital you go to L&D and they put you in the triage room (your doctor has already called them by this point and told them you are coming).  then they hook you up to monitors and give you an internal exam to see if you really are in labor.  your spouse/partner goes to register you at this point.  if it is confirmed you are in labor then you are moved to a labor and delivery room.|`|AA11470437	That usually depends on the hospital. I got admitted and they periodically checked my cervic. They broke my water after a while and a few hours later, I had a baby. I tell you one thing though... after you have the baby, if they tell you to pee, then PEE!! Otherwise you'll be stuck with a catheter. Miserable thing, that. You usually get released after 24 hrs... 48 for a C sextion.
QCvh40NIaa	Sounds like something i experianced when I was around 16 weeks, not sure what it would be as baby is not able to reach that high yet.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	I got a weird "popping" sensation in my tummy several times throughout my first trimester...it wasn't quite as high up as my ribcage though.    I'm afraid I have no idea what it is, but my baby is fine so I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. Talk to your midwife (your first appointment should be about now?) and ask her if anybody has mentioned it before and if she knows what it is!     Congratulations and good luck! :o) x|`|WvWFmwQoaa	well it could be possible that you are more pregnant than what you think i remember when i found out i was pregnant the doctor took a blood test to make sure and he worked out that i was 3 weeks pregnant at the time but when i went for my ultrasound at 11 weeks they worked out from the measurements that i was really 13 weeks so it could be possible but the only way to be sure is by an ultrasound.  but im not sure about the popping under the rib cage i didn't experience any of that but EVERY pregnancy is different so it could be normal but then again whats normal in pregnancy lol so many times i have asked if something is normal to my doc/mid wife they say " yes it's totally normal" so i guess its normal lol but if you still not sure see your doc.  good luck and congrats on the pregnancy :))

mb1CZfuEaa	WHAT KIND OF CRAP IS THAT oops i had the caps on anyway where would you here something like that? and no its not true
3dSCbIcEaa	your stomach "hardening" during pregnancy is your uterus growing to fit the baby in it.  the uterus is a muscle so it feels hard.  as it grows week by week your stomach gets harder. by three months the uterus grows up and over the pubic bone, by month 5 the uterus should reach the belly button causing that pregnancy look.
AA11763588	Yes, it's normal.|`|nHpd4lRXaa	I was insanely gassy for the first 2-3 weeks with this pregnancy, it was also pretty much the only symptom I had. With my son I had no gas, hardly any symptoms either. Lucky pregnancies I suppose!|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Pregnancy can really make you gassy, especially in the first trimester.|`|IurAMoIDaa	hi, how r u?    when my friend was pregnant, i was scared to sit next to her as she was always letting them off, lol!    yes i think it is normal, so don't panic!!!|`|75l2smfCaa	Im 12 weeks and I havent noticed any difference...guess Im a lucky one, or should I say my hubby is :)|`|hqogf9oGaa	I suffered really badly from wind in early pregnancy which I think is quite common although it eased off soon enough and thankfully I have it back under control.

pwu9xzF8aa	it sounds like she really, really, needs some help!!  formula is fine- it is there for  a reason, and this would be as good as any!! she isnt saying she doesnt want to feed her baby, she is saying she doesnt have the energy- its not just 'complaining'- she has been through a hell of a ride, and she musn't be getting enough help. Someone needs to watch the baby for her so she can get some sleep- sleep deprivation is the worst thing, and when you have so much to worry about the mental drain doesnt help either.  Maybe you and your brother could do the washing for her, watch the baby, send her to have a nice long shower and a few hours sleep.  Keep an eye out for depression! feeling that overwhelmed puts her at risk. I dont think she is trying to harm the little one, but you can only do so much before your body burns out.  Good luck|`|miPubuDYaa	Yes, Its ok to both breast feed and bottle feed the baby. Actually it would be a great idea if she was planning on returning to work shortly.     However Your brother's girlfriend is suffering from post-partum depression. She needs help, honey. Not wanting to feed the baby because she is tired is unacceptable and actually child abuse. I suggest you talk with you brother. Maybe he can call her doctor/gyno and tell him. He can prescribe medicine that will help out untill this passes.|`|h6kTWuNVaa	you cant force someone to breastfeed, they have to want to do it. I am all for the breast, but if momma is unwilling, then it's gonna have to be a bottle.   A baby can live off of formula, and your brother can stand to wake up at night to feed the baby.  The mom is being selfish, BUT... nothing you can do about it.|`|uNgslkwwaa	I'm no expert but she's only a week into motherhood and she may not be coping that well. Her act during the day may just be a front to hide her fear. Maybe?     Also she may have Post-natal depression.     Hope you guys sort this out. sounds like she needs some help and support either way.|`|dPyfP0ijaa	She probably has post-partum depression. look it up, it's pretty serious.    I've known several mothers who have gone through this, it's not necessarily her fault, so getting mad at her and making her feel bad about it is only going to make things worse.     Some women have been known to kill themselves or their children because of this.    Just help care for the baby. Formula is totally fine, the babys doc can recommend what kind. Sometimes a soy based formula can be an easier transition from breast milk. The baby will be fine, many mothers never breastfeed to begin with.    She needs to see a therapist before it gets worse.|`|ArmOXDoaaa	It could be that she's selfish, it could be post pardom depression, she may or may not be an overall reasonable person.  Either way, you can't force her to breastfeed, since it is her choice.  You can't make someone do something "at their own will."|`|z5EDtgtyaa	no you can't force someone to breast feed. and there is nothing wrong with formula feeding, that's why it's there. why don't you tell your brother to buy a pump so she can pump milk during the day so at night he can be bottle feed breast milk. and lots of babies are feed on bottles there is nothing wrong with them. I was never breast feed. and I'm healthy|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Babies don't NEED to be breastfed.A lot are formula fed and are perfectly fine.    Babies can be bottle fed the first minutes they pop out of their mother.    Its ok to feed the baby day and night...babies do get hungry around the clock.|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	Has he asked her to pump extra milk during the day so he can feed at night?  If she doesn't have enough milk, there is nothing wrong with bottle (formula) feeding, that is what it is made for.|`|UtvBfdR3aa	She probably has ppd... but, you can't MAKE her.  Many babies are raised on formula.|`|HvALvdc7aa	I would just formula feed the baby. We started on Enfamil with iron right after my daughter was born. She has been formula fed the whole time and is 13lbs at only 8 weeks. Its better than the baby starving. She sounds like a real b*tch if she neglects her own baby b/c she is tired. I haven't slept more than 4 hours in a night since my baby was born and I love it.. I wouldn't change a thing.|`|tbwp9Ko8aa	You don't HAVE to breastfeed.  She's probably exhausted aswell.  Leave her alone god.  You'll probably be like that when you have a kid.|`|7ulaznL1aa	Maybe while she's feeling generous you can convince her to pump some breast milk and save it for later so that your brother can feed the baby that when the mother is feeling tired. It is horrible that she just refuses to feed him, but you've got to work with it and props to you for seeking advice.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	you dont  mind your own business  if she doesnt want to breast feed then thats her choice   butt out of it     i had bottle mix and i didnt die   maybe your brother should have thought about geting bottle mix during the day incase the mum was too tired|`|PRzmwFfgaa	You can't force her to breastfeed.  However, if they want their child to be raised on breast milk, she should consider buying a pump and pumping her breast milk when she isn't tired and putting it in the fridge.  This way the baby can be bottle fed so anyone can feed him, and he can still receive all the health benefits of breast milk.|`|OeD2sJt7aa	It's their choice and trust me, she may not sound rational and there may be lots of fights right now, but that's just because she has a newborn baby.  You really aren't rational for a few days and you get so tired that ALL you can think of is sleep.  If they want to feed the baby formula, that is up to them.  I think the nursing + formula at night is a good idea.  Sleep is important and very very scarce for those first few months.|`|VHHis05Naa	Wait...she won't breastfeed him OR bottle feed him?  *shocked*  She has to feed her child one way or the other.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	wow what a selfish biatch. i'd knock her out.|`|TN3Sthbwaa	you don;t force someone to breastfeed against their will.  Formula is there for a reason, it is her choice.    i answered you other one as well.|`|Irm5gynTaa	maybe she is having some postpartum depression, have your brother talk to her doctor about it. it is VERY serious isssue.  google it, and you can learn some more about it.  as far as breastfeeding, bottle feeding is fine also.  it's just as nutricious. just don't go from breast feeding, to bottle feeding to breast feeding. it will give the baby tummy problems.  so either she needs to breast feed, and take responsibility as a mother, or choose to do formula, where they can take turns feeding.  she is probably stressed and over whelmed, give her time, but make her see a doctor.
qxnZXOVFaa	why did you fail the assessment?  i understand that you want your children, every mother does, but maybe you should think about what's important in your life and make some changes.  then you might be able to get your children back and be a responsible mother.|`|8ndWUWxRaa	I think your best bet is by changing some things in your life so that you can show social services that it would be ok that your kids are near you. I mean they were taken away for a reason. So maybe fix some of those problems. There are courses that should be offered locally for certain substance abuses or places that can give you financial plans, or somewhere mayb e that gives parenting classes. So if it was deemed that you arn't fit at this time work on yourself to gain the trust of social services.|`|QGsYPJoKaa	I would say i understand what you're saying .. but I don't, i can't imagine the agony.  But i do understand your in a lot of pain, but they would have been taken off you for a just reason.   Whatever those reasons were, you need to move on from them and try and focus on the future and getting your children back.  But you also need to think whether you can cope with them and would they be getting a better way of life and a better future somewhere else, or if you make some changes and prove your capable can you give them all they have to offer and give them uncompromising love.    You need to ask some questions, make some changes an prove your capable.    As long as your sure you can guarantee them the best in life then thats fine, but if you can't then maybe you should consider putting their future first.
pzLDXL6gaa	Seems too heavy for implantation bleeding - probably your period. With bleeding and the negatives tests I doubt you're pregnant. However you can bleed in early pregnancy. So take another test in a week or two when it's been about 2 weeks since the sex.    Harriet
dPyfP0ijaa	If it's only a tiny bit, and you're not in pain, you can wait a little bit for your hubby to take you in.    BUT YOU NEED TO REST REST REST    If you are in pain or you continue bleeding, you need to call for an ambulance. don't feel embarrassed, it could save you and your baby.    My sis-in-law had bleeding during her pregnancy, they just put her on bed rest and kept a close eye on her.     It could truly be a number of things.    Most likely you're fine for now, wait 'till your hubby gets home.    Your doc should have a answering service that wll contact him for an emergency.    Also your heath insurance should have a nurse hotline you can call to get better advice.|`|nluNSDI4aa	GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM RIGHT AWAY! bleeding is not really normal and could mean potential miscarriage so hurry.|`|DkP14oJaaa	call the doctors.|`|irAlfTveaa	well i dont know much about this but it sounds scary and i hope everything works out!   I would call a neighbor or best friend and ask them what to do and possibly ask them for a ride to the doctor or emergency room|`|n7hezV5aaa	Well I know that spotting is perfectly normal in pregnancies, but I don't know about bright red blood. I would suggest calling your husband to come pick you up and take you to the emergency room, asap. If you can't find him, call an ambulance.|`|GTwVNeHraa	Oh, sorry, my mom had the same thing, if you continue to bleed to may have a miscarrage, but I read online that most women bleed a little during pregnancy so you are most likely fine, but there may be a possibility of you having a miscarrage, in that case (SORRY)|`|jJV4a5CUaa	CALL YOUR HUSBAND NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Your best be is to call the hospital and talk to a labor and delivery nurse.  They know more than we do.  They will tell you what to do so you don't worry should I go or not.  GOod luck hun|`|lfGdztzxaa	It's common for people at the beginning of your pregnancy to get light spotting. The best thing to do is call and leave a message for your doctor and wait until morning and after you received a call back from your doctor before acting upon it. Rushing into thing will cause you more stress and that's not good for the baby. If things get worst then you need to go to the doctor or ER.    I have the same problems at 11 weeks, I'm 14 weeks now.|`|AA11436955	what the hell woman, call a cab.    who is on this site that you think can give you immediate attention and medical advice, get off the computer.|`|xeMttZGdaa	Very likely not serious.     but i were you, I'll call my husband. Remember your kid comes first to anything else in your or your husband's life|`|c42a426f28c9fd509f9cc8dd1cb7d303aa	that miscarriage, my sister lost her baby two weeks ago!!|`|qrnAZ2wbaa	im 11wks preggo and i started to bleed last week.. thank god it only lasted a day.. i went to the emergency room.. they did an ultrasound and everything was okay... thank god!!! so yes please go to the emergency room.. something can be wrong and if ur stressed out real bad thats not good.. which can lead to bleeding.. trust me i know|`|o11QqyZdaa	This happened to my friend and she mis-carried. you need to be seen righ away|`|btRMWf5Taa	call you husband to come home  or call 911 and they'll take you to the emergency room.|`|AA12275027	yes you need to call your husband to take you to the er.    get off the comp. and call your husband now please.|`|511f36b32bab3f108f576850ec28ee32aa	Call him asap and tell him of the situation.  He should understand.|`|tqoZZUQJaa	Yes you should call him to take you call 911 if you are in pain but it maybe already to late. I hope all is well and you are just spotting ( some women do get full periods while pregnant)|`|ibyJMzMiaa	yes!! even if its just a little bit you should have your husband get you because you can never be too careful.  & stressing is definitely bad for the baby try doing some breathing exercises anything to help you, because whatever you feel the baby feels.
GrLIOUDgaa	Please don't take this the wrong way but you need to think of these things before you have unprotected sex, you are not naive because you have one child and a abortion behind you.Start using protection, you can;t just keep having abortions every time it doesn't fit into your plans, it can be very bad for your body and I won't comment on how I feel personally about abortion because that is your decision to make.I do agree with you that you and your bf need to finish your education and establish financial security before you bring more children into the world, good luck in whatever you decide.|`|5f6XnInEaa	Wow... how about stop having sex?  That often prevents situations like these.    As the first poster said, would you get rid of you 18 month old, just because times weren't convenient for you?    You've been together for 6 months...and are already engaged?  Talk about a winner!|`|9fb8dd613b6d7669a254e54dfa56167baa	just think would you get rid of your 18month old if he became an inconvenience? Could you look at your child and know you had killed his sibling?|`|VHHis05Naa	Get on some reliable birth control, geez!|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	I'm sorry but if you thought you needed to work on your relationship first & have you finish school why then wouldn't you go to extra lengths to protect yourself from becoming pregnant, that was a very unwise decision & now your baby may have to pay the price of that decision. The child isn't at fault and shouldn't have to be the brunt of poor decision making. If you're due to graduate in Dec & is due to have the baby in Oct that's only a 2 mth difference & shouldn't be a major factor|`|2gh84Ec6aa	you need to keep it.   having an abortion doesnt make you "not pregnant"  it makes you the mother of a dead child.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	You would have 2 kids for 2 months while you finish school. Some women have 2 kids before they even start school and still do it. I'm really surprised you're willing to get an abortion again, after you have your child. You should have the baby, it's not his fault you and your fiance rushed your relationship, got engaged and pregnant after 6 months. You have no good reasons for it, if you didn't want a baby, then you should have took precautions. i'm all for pro-choice, but you put yourself here.
DDYwnut6aa	The 14 day thing is simply an average.  Your body ovulates when it is ready, not by a calendar.    Your best bet in pinpointing ovulation, and your most fertile time of the month, is to start charting and watching your fertility signs. Buy a basal thermometer and take your temp first thing every morning - at the same time every day - before you even get out of bed. Before you do anything at all. Note the temp. When you ovulate, your temp will rise and stay elevated above the pattern you note for pre-ovulation temps.    Charting is so much better than using some online ovulation predictor. Those things don't know your body - you do. Every woman's body is different, and the calculators don't take that into consideration.    Your cervical mucus will typically tell you when ovulation is coming. It will be watery, or like egg whites. That's the fertile stuff that keeps sperm alive while you are waiting to ovulate. This is also why you're fertile for a few days 'before' ovulation. The sperm can live and lie in wait for the egg. Your egg will live for 12-24 hours after ovulation. And  You can also buy ovulation strips to test for lueteinizing hormone (you'll have a surge of it 12-36 hours before ovulation), but keep in mind that when you test for ovulation the test line must be *as dark or darker than the control line. * Two lines do not equal a positive on the ovulation tests.    Check out this site: http://www.fertilityfriend.com    There is a charting course there that you can take for free, and free software to chart your temps. The first day of your period is 'cycle day 1.' I typically ovulate on cycle day 12, but have actually ovulated on cycle day 10 before and as late as cycle day 15. This variation in ovulation days is why some women's cycle lengths vary. The time between ovulation and your period (the 'luteal' phase) will not vary more than a day, maybe two. But the time between your period and ovulation can vary more than that. Chart a few cycles and you'll see your own fertility pattern.    Good luck to you!|`|H74F8jxuaa	Could be cd 14-15.  Try using opk's to find out for sure.  Good luck!|`|wqOTgbxmaa	not enought info this mite help        http://www.momswhothink.com/index.php?op...      http://www.askdramy.com/ovulationcalc.ht...

The causes can be many and various and I don't intend to provoke a snowstorm (forgive the pun) of reaction.    It's just a shame that so much individual potential is diverted to childcare obligations when that person could be fulfilling more personal goals at that stage in their lives.    Best Wishes|`|xsS88IEpaa	its your life if you wanna waste it its up to you|`|5072c885a0d43b66b964ac86a027351faa	it is way too young! ever heard of safe sex? but just ignore people your life, your problems, I just hope the father is around to help.|`|75l2smfCaa	I think whats done is done. Who cares about age. My mom was 15 with my brother, 16 with me, 17 with my other brother, and 20 with my other brother! lol! All with the same guy and they are still married. 25 years and still in love. All the children are very successful. I graduated from college with a BA and work a great life and am now prego with number 1. My other brother owns his own home and is getting married soon. Dont listen to people who are negative. Yeah you may not have chose to be young and pregnant but you can do it :)|`|rIr781BXaa	if guys do things like that its considered cool.  but when girls do it there considered hoes, boppers, rollers ect.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.  im 17 too  i think its brave to continue with the pregnancy. yes sometimes pregnancy happens and its not the best at this age.  But babies are blessings :)   and no matter what they will always be blessings -->  Congratulation.s Same boat as you darling.    God bless x    Not every one has the same views on young pregnant ladies.  Thats wy people are like that.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	16 and 17 is way to young to be having baby's.  Not saying that you would be a terrible mother but there's where your life ends. You don't get to go out and have fun with your friends. having a baby at such a young age isn't a good idea but good luck and congrats with your blessing.|`|7Mhju1mEaa	i think it totally unacceptable and irresponsible!!!    young girls can't even look after themselves let alone a baby  &all the young girls i see pregnant are junkies and lo-lifers    who are basically just after the money!  and they smoke and party while pregnant  and the father usually doesn't stick around    i don't understand what's going on ur their heads!!!!!    live your life  get a job and make a good life for yourself so ur baby will be brought into one!!|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	No one can tell you what to do may be if we tell you don't do it you vex so up to you.........................|`|RrJnynJlaa	depends on the situation, it can be the right thing for some people but not for others.|`|AA10010715	Have you researched how much money it costs to raise a child plus support yourself?  It's unrealistic of you to expect your parents to raise your child so plan on going to work and not sleeping much until the child starts school.    It's not a good thing to do unless you have a large trust fund that you can live off of until the child is more independant and you can work full time to support yourself.|`|QCvh40NIaa	Im 16 and I am 30 weeks 3 days pregnant and i'm expecting a girl on the 9th April, the comments i've read on here made me feel sick.  Not everybody is the stereotypical teenage pregnant girl.  It doesnt mean your life ends just because you can't go out and get drunk, to me it's where my life will begin, having my baby will be the best thing thats ever happened to be and I cant wait.  I dont see what all the negativity is about, some people don't want to go out and get outrageously drunk every weekend, I certainly don't.   As for smoking in pregnany, yeah, I agree that that's wrong + it makes me angry when I see girls that do it, so I will agree with that point, but as for the rest of the negative comments, not all of us want to 'waste' our lives going out getting stupidly drunk on the weekend.|`|4JNRMAxBaa	The only thing that makes me happier than seeing a pregnant teenager, is seeing one with a Silk Cut in one hand and a Scrumpy Jacks tinny in the other.|`|sstNdyYVaa	fine as long as your in wedlock and upon the true deen|`|heFGOISVaa	i had by son when i was 15 one month before i was 16 but  they have never made fun of me...or at him...and if they do its nothing to be embarrassed about...|`|Ca5n28eVaa	i was 15 when i has my baby and i have never been happier|`|18PnBZaEaa	i think people should mind there own Business. because of you're age doesn't mean u are incapable of being a good parent.. its hard but its hard for any first time mums. if you feel ready for it and have a good support system then its all good.. i live in dundee which at one point is the highest for teenage pregnancies and a few of my friends had baby's this young and there kids are bit older now and doing great.. im 24 preg with my first to be honest i feel a bit old lol.. no one should judge you or friend for all they no you will be the best mum in the world.. im sure u will be great .. good luck
1c498d03fe9bb2e8719c81fe361b9912aa	what to look out for is: about 1-2 weeks before labour you cant sit down u have to keep cleaning even places u have just cleaned lol then a few day before u don't want to move u just have no energy what so ever, just going to the toilet is an effort, good luck with ur lil bundle of joy|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Honestly, I didn't. I was getting back contractions that were irregular, but I naively thought you couldn't get them in your back. It was only when I rang my maternity ward that I realised I was. Prior to getting them, I felt nauseous the day before and the day I went into labour, I was more tired than normal and slightly lethargic, and I also got my bloody show (but that isn't an indicator of labour happening soon). Good luck :)|`|SsfnitjXaa	It all depends on how in tune with your body.. with me.. I could tell it was happening.  Some women don't even know they are pregnant until the baby drops out (literally).  By this time you should be packed, phone numbers handy and ready to go.    You are not having weekly checkups... the doctor will let you know if you have not dropped if you can't tell.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	My water broke and then the contractions started.|`|A0NfgNEiaa	lots and lots of pain lol    it just starts no warning well for me it did.    good luck|`|QCN0VohQaa	I had a very dull period like pain for about 24 hours before giving birth. I did have an extremely quick labour, but I was searching for clues all that day and found it hard to work out if it was actually happening or not. I had a very small show (literally hardly anything) and my waters didnt break until minutes before my son was born. Its totally different for everyone, but when it's happening you will know about it.|`|s6RPiUE8aa	I'm a conservative myself.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	first time about 2 days before i could not sit down just pace wherever i was. on the night had lower backache and braxton hicks felt different more intense. i timed the contractions and they were every 20 mins and 45 secs. you will know when it happens. i hope it goes ok for you good luck.|`|o11QqyZdaa	I was getting painful contractions within minutes of eachother....you just know :)|`|8ELfnTODaa	well my water actually broke so it was pretty obvious lol. but the days leading up to my water breaking i started having extreme pressure on my cervix, (tmi) a lot of bowel movements, 3 days before i had one hours worth of 3 minute apart contractions,  and i lost my mucous plug the night before(but that can happen weeks before you go into labor).    good luck and congrats!!|`|LVhMZXtoaa	You'll feel restless and you just 'know' it's not indigestion!  you can't mistake the pain when it starts!!  unless you are one of the lucky few who don't have much pain!   your waters might break before you get any contractions.  labour affects everyone differently - it usually lasts longer for a 'prima gravida' (first timer).  Your partner often has more symptoms than you. They are in the bathroom throwing up while you calmly collect your overnight bag!    a very exciting time - all the best to you.  make the most of your leisure time - you won't have much of that after the baby is born! you sleep when they do.

Does that make sense? lol|`|HxbLwCEKaa	The second but only because the first girl is using too much make -up trying to look older. and failing.|`|sNr9Od89aa	you guys probably both think you're the prettier one, and are having an obnoxious tween girl fight over it. so you decide to ask a bunch of strangers (probably creepers) to decide it for you. get over yourselves, seriously.|`|BNXmmscmaa	errrrrrrr well none of u pretty but if i had to choose the first 1 errrrrrr that dont meen ur pretty but yeah   NEITHER but i dont like mexiacans so 1st 1 i hope that makes u fell bettrer about urself!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|sEihaeLNaa	1|`|f4Ms77qzaa	They're both pretty but I'd have the say the first one .

The syllables agree with each other, the names have positive meanings and the two names go well with each other, which will work in your favor, especially when the kids are older and you have to yell at them to quit *insert disruptive toddler activity here*  Make sure that the initials, with your last name added, don't spell anything insulting.
QXSFpMzDaa	Thank god for plan B huh?  That being said I hated it and the side effects.  It screwed my period all up for about 2-3 months and made me so sick.  Yes what you are experience is normal.
5dbb526c11e9e05fe0b995ed64c08f67aa	I suspect you have cholic (especially with the bubbly feeling) but do keep an eye on things.  I presume you have no bleeding - that of course would be a symptom you would have to go to hospital with regardless of weather conditions.    You're bound to be panicky, especially if it's your first pregnancy.    You could always ring NHS Direct for advice.    Good luck.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Have you been for a  2 lately? I used to feel like that and the pain normally went once i'd gone. Also, i'd drink a fizzy drink to help bring up some of the trapped wind. Please don't panic hun, i'm assuming you have no bleeding or cramping, just the pain from trapped wind. It's very very very normal in pregnancy, so please don't worry.  If you're still concerned, ring the NHS Direct for some professional reassurance :)|`|75l2smfCaa	Well, Id say maybe go number 2. I had those pains in early pregnancy and I usually went number 2 and was greatly releaved. They hurt so bad and I wanted to cry when I got them. You could probably call the ER and ask their advice on whether you should go in or not?|`|HUrYSp4oaa	if the pain is relieved by passing wind then it is unlikely to be anything to do with yr baby and if there was a problem with it u would likely be bleeding.    try to relax and not worry too much.   pregnancy does funny things to yr digestive system and i experienced similar pains with mine. if  it continues then mention to yr doc or midwife at next check up. good luck.|`|HYGPyxAHaa	Yeah i think your gassy and or maybe even kind of constipated.   When your pregnant your body slows down digesting so you can get really bad pains. I would drink lots of water and lay down on your left side for as long as you can and take it easy. Also eat some simple meals for a few days and try taking some mettamucil.   I dont think you need to go to ER but you should call your nurse or doc and get some advice. They might get you an early appntment to make you feel better   Take care|`|DXLfbKUBaa	Get checked out as soon as poss, it sound like it could be ectopic pregnancy where baby grows in Fallopian tube, please don't ignore this pain your body is telling you something is not right. It is possible it may be wind but better be safe, good luck x|`|L3QDn1cYaa	well its always best to be checked out, however i had that with my second child at 12 weeks i thought  i was miscarraging and went hospital and they said it can be normal and is quit comman all it  is that ur womb is stretching and contracting, so i wouldnt worry to much but i wld reccomend u c ur gp or midwife .
S00V7LYQaa	Pregnancy after tube ligation is very rare. It is posible when tube ligation becomes loose and sperm escapes to fertilize the egg.  But this is usually an ecoptic pregnancy. Sometimes fertilized eggs can also escape from tied tubes and become implanted in the uterus. So yes  it is possible, but a recent study (the Collaborative Review of Sterilization, or CREST, study) looked at 10,000 women who had undergone tubal ligation and found 143 failures (a failure rate of 1.4 percent). It can be higher when a tubal is done at the time of a C-section. The failure rate also tends to increase the longer it has been since one had a tubal ligation. The U.S. Collaborative Review of Sterilization (CREST) found the failure rate for tubal ligation (all occlusion methods) to be 1.85% after 10 years. If you want to know more, you can to this site to learn more about the actual procedure of tube litgation and how it's done. http://www.drspock.com/article/0,1510,54...  hope this helps.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Yes,rarely tubal pregnancies or ectopic pregnancies can happen and they never make it to the uterus. They must be removed to prevent infection or death of the woman,since they cannot grow into a fully developed baby and be born.|`|w1pbRmazaa	technically yes.... if the doctor screwd up!!!! lol|`|jNqf8HtDaa	nope|`|mpUsNchQaa	NO WAY|`|5TgTKrVwaa	mainly no.  THey may get untied or they may get loose. therefore there is always the possibility, although its a small chance it will.|`|5hM9bI1Naa	yes it can happen cause it happened to my aunt and she lost her child|`|4GnzqUxzaa	no.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	Nope,but it has been known for the tubes to come untied but it`s very rare.|`|Vp3FklU2aa	NO!|`|9nD6cW2aaa	nope|`|rNjTHr36aa	YES.    my mother has had her tubes tied since 1990 and recently had a miscarriage.|`|RCK7H7Guaa	Yes they can still get knocked up!!! Its kinda like a shoe coming un tied and you do not figure it out until you have fallen on your face!  HAHAHAHAHA  but seriously yes they can still get pregnant|`|Ib9E2MITaa	Um not usually but I know a woman that had her tubes tied and got pregnant about 7 years later because it did not fully take. So it is possible.|`|GyYHfopbaa	Yes But the chances are EXTREMLY LOW|`|gPrNqkVWaa	no|`|HW89eJEZaa	yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|WYmOlYTZaa	VERY  VERY VERY RARELY but yes|`|tZy6u61uaa	yes, it happened to my friends mom. Thats how my best friend is alive(:|`|JVPwpwYlaa	it is not a common occurrence but can happen as it did to my aunt 5 yrs after she had hers tied she gave birth.
rw9VL1Ymaa	My response is what on earth does a 14 yo and a 19 yo have in common. Even if he learned "late" that you were only 14, he would have to be dense not to see it. I think that guys who use the "I did not know her age or she lied about it" are just making excuses to get themselves out of a jam.     5 years of age difference when you are 14 vs 30 is a whole separate ball game. When you are 14 you are much more easily influenced by older guys to do things that you would not ordinarily do. I think that this guy is taking advantage of a girl who is not speaking up for herself.|`|Irm5gynTaa	well, i am 16 and my boyfriend is 19.  when we first started dating i was 14, and he was 17.  and then he was freaked out about the age thing, but he eventually got over it once he saw how mature i was, and so did everyone else.  however, i am VERY mature for most people my age, i am graduated from high school, we live together, i have a full time job and plan on starting college soon to be a rn. and he is in the police academy now training to be a police officer.  i would say it is all based on maturity, and commitment.  i think the not having sex part shows you are very responsible, my boyfriend and i did have sex earlyon, and i do ot regret it. i'm very informed about sex, and the repercussions.  i've grown up fast, but i wouldn't change it for the world.    btw, we legally live together, i am legally emancipated.!|`|838VJJGvaa	Sorry but yuck.|`|AA12275027	it's nasty...and perverted.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	No, no, no! That's just not a good idea. Do you understand the differences between a 14 and 19 year old? It's HUGE. You should find someone your own age hun. As much as you think this guy is not using you, he is! I know you won't understand me now, but you will 10 years from now.|`|vNWh1M3naa	nothing wrong with that  love knows no age difference|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Sex or no...I would not welcome that much an age difference in my daughter's life.     He's close to being an adult...and you quite simply are not.  It will be two years before you can drive...four before you are allowed to make basic decisions on your own.     The age difference between men and women fades in significance after the 30's...but I would ask myself why he is so comfortable with someone so much younger.    You can't get away from it...and this relationship could get him in a world of trouble.    Good luck  (You DID ask)|`|ps3N8YHMaa	ILLEGALLLL!!!!!!! If you have sex, he can be charged with rape. even if you wanted to.|`|NDQS5HJyaa	It's pretty common for younger girls to date older guys. I know I dated older when I was around that age, I've always found it... kind of weird, in my personal taste, to go younger, I guess. I suppose it also depends on if sex is involved or not. I know its hard sometimes to avoid it, but its worth it, especially when the older guy could get in some major trouble for it. Casual dating a slightly older guy is fine, most of the time, in my opinion. Especially when most relationships (I hope i don't offend you or both you with this) at around 14, don't really have much meaning later down the line. Like i said, just most. It's normally just casual dating, which can be fun, if you know you're limits.|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	That's way too big of an age difference! I would not be happy if I had a daughter in that situation. I'm 18 and I doubt I would even date a 23 year old - it's too weird!    What do you two have in common? You're practically still a kid and he (I would hope) is in college! I can imagine how much his friends probably make fun of him for dating a kid. Most parents don't even let their kids date when they're 14! I'm curious as to what your parent's think of you two dating.       Sorry, but if you were my daughter I would not allow it at all. You may not be having sex yet but I foresee it in your future. I'm in college and there's a woman who had her daughter when she was 14. You want that happening to you? A ton of girls I went to high school with are pregnant now. It's pathetic and hope it doesn't happen to you.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Five years difference may not mean much when you are 20 and 25 or 30 and 35, but there is a world of difference between a 14 year old and a 19 year old.  A 14 year old is just on the cusp of adolescence while a 19 year old is becoming an adult.  There are just too many potiential problems.      Wait a few years and see.|`|ArmOXDoaaa	It's funny because when I was 19, I knew of a guy who was dating a14 year old girl.  I didn't react well to him, his friends didn't react well to him, in fact I don't know a single person who reacted well to him.  NO ONE likes a 19 year old who would date a 14 year old, there are millions of reasons for that.    So there you have it, his friends all think he's a pervert.  Regardless of whether you're having sex or not, that doesn't mean it's not a recipe for disaster.   At 14 it's pretty much impossible to have legitimate dating experience, so I understand that you're happy with it now, but this will only bring you heartache.   I know you don't like my answer, but when you're 19 you will understand what I mean.      For the future:  When you're dating someone, you should have no reason to get defensive.  You immediately assumed how people would react to your question, but saying that "he asked you out first, okay??"  But if you were in a healthy relationship then you wouldn't have to do that.  If friends and family disagree with your relationship, they're probably right.    To your edit:     Unfortunately, you are too young to decide whether people should "leave your parents out of it."  Your parents are responsible for your well being, and if they pressed charges, the judge would not care about what you thought was best.  As I said before, if you have to get defensive when people tell you something, they're probably right.|`|I5P2bbgWaa	something is seriously wrong with a 19 yr old that is attracted to children.|`|dcovK6oqaa	I think she should date until she is seventeen. I think she is to young even if the guy would be her age.|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	Well in today's world, people assume dating= sex. If your having sex with your bf, then it would be illegal, because most states the age of consent is 16.    It's only a 5 year difference really. I've seen people marry/date guys/women 5-10 years older/younger. But your still a minor so that makes the difference. If you were 20 and he was 25 people wouldn't care.    Before I turned 18 I was dating a 18 year old guy( he turned 19, 2 months after my 18th). We didn't have sex or anything like that.  My mom allowed me to date him because  we both knew him and I dated/knew him when I turned 16.      I'll turn 19 in a month and we are still together.    As for me I don't date anyone younger then me :). I date guys 1-3 years older then I am.|`|XJzyTTbtaa	I think it's fine, as long as they both know the limits of the relationship then I see no problem with it;O|`|aY9v3SJKaa	Well alot of what im thinking has already been said. So I will just say that a 19 year old has no business being around or dating a 14 year old. He is in college and you are just out of junior high school. There are laws against it because it is wrong. They are in place to protect the CHILD.....which is what you are, from adult predators which is what he is. If he has sex with you it is called statutory rape, if he touches you sexually its called child molestation. When you are over 18 date whoever you want....until then you are a 14 year old CHILD. He is playing with fire being around you and risking jail/prison time and being labeled as a sexual predator, child molestor and registered sex offender which he will carry for the rest of his life. The ramifications for this are ENORMOUS!    You may think sex wont happen and you are dead WRONG....19 year old males have sexual urges. Obviously you are fast for your age or he wouldnt have thought you were older. He needs to run like hell in the other direction from you!!     I have a 24 year old daughter and never would have allowed it. I have a 16 year old daughter and would be stupid to think if she dated a 19 year old that sex would not happen. Of course the temptation is there. Where the hell are your parents at? I can almost say with 100% certainty your parents had you when they were very young, leave you alone unsupervised alot or you live in a single parent home. Sad....just sad!|`|SBBnWsJJaa	Sick and wrong.|`|0RWgk4DIaa	totally crazy, he is way to old and the maturity level is way off|`|prqrQcd1aa	It's not only illegal, but it is also wrong. As soon as he knew how old you were he should have ended the relationship. It doesn't matter if you are having sex or not, what would a 19 year old want to do with a 14 year old... unless he is really immature or something, but even then there are so many levels where this is wrong.  Why ARE your parents allowing it, do they think that you will not eventually want to have sex with him? Do they think that you don't have a chance at all of becomming a teenage mother? Do they not think there is a chance that he will really end up hurting you by cheating on you or finding someone his own age? I was young once too, but honestly a 19 year old MAN has no buisness being with a 14 year old GIRL.
TBNaPkl6aa	That is really nice of you to go to the effort to get this new mom a nice gift.  I have the following ideas, all things I would have appreciated after I gave birth:  -diapers  -wipes  -outfits that were not so gender-oriented (there are other colors for a girl besides pink and purple)  -someone to do my laundry or clean my house or bring over a meal  -a massage    Keep in mind that before you visit, please call the new mommy first and ask her when it would be a good time for HER to see you, and once she tells you, give her a concrete day and time when you'll come over.  (I had minor issues with relatives who indicated they wanted to come over and claimed they were but never verified anything with me).|`|723QHuicaa	A voucher for her to pamper herself - a massage, nails done, hair done. Or some nice bubble baths. Or simply say you will watch the baby so she can get out shopping herself for a bit.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	A gift cards.|`|AA12332167	honestly. DIAPERS every mommy needs lots and lots of diapers. Baby detergent is also pretty experience so if you can afford to get her some Deft baby detergent and softener I'm sure she would GREATLY appreciate it!|`|DApXuaJyaa	chocolates chocolates chocolate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   no one ever bought me them!!!!|`|A89ezcg5aa	Hire a cleaning service or offer to clean for her a few times.  A gift certificate to a hair salon. Also, diapers...and buy a size up (not size Newborn) because new babies grow fast.|`|0nb1rQhnaa	Pre-made meals that she can put in her freezer. Like Let's Dish, or something similar you may have in your area.|`|AA10158573	Meal certificates or home cooked meals.  i know we were so busy we would forget to eat and we just were too tired to cook.
BaXruEcqaa	I'm feeling the same as you, i'm 10dpo.  No sore boobs, but they feel very heavy.  slight back pain and slight cramps.  I'm due for AF in 5 days.  No other symptoms.  I dont want to test until after my expected period though, i'm so afraid of the negative.  And yes, I have a lot of CM....clear.  The only thing we can do is wait.|`|XTMNHuvDaa	i think ur to young for sex|`|AHLUW1HNaa	I think you could?|`|878535e89b442981887b8556d9fa7b67aa	is there anything that is impossible? no|`|Zkizt4EIaa	it's possible you could  be having a set back...i did that after i had my daughter at like two months post pardum...just take a test can't go wrong there|`|F6jBrNmuaa	I think you can't get pregnant because if you just had your kids 3-4 mounths ago i think something about the brest that they have like brest milk in them. Or something like that. :)
WGAFP6mSaa	No, he has to wait until the baby is born to get a paternity test.|`|sKmQVwQMaa	you have to wait till the baby is born so you can take a blood sample of the baby.|`|hstwNjNaaa	No, he'll have to wait until the baby is born.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	everything is possible.  if she is so well known, he needs to make sure it is his.  haven't you watched maury?  they are on all the time claiming one boy and not matching anyone up to 5-6 later.|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	No! You have to wait till the baby is born to get a paternety test.|`|85V6cHe4aa	Technically yes it is possible but its expensive and invasive and could cause a risk of miscarriage,i doubt he would find a doctor who would be happy to comply even if the girl is.    Better to wait until the baby is born,simple,safer and he will still get the same result.|`|ihA9ydaLaa	Call Maury and schedule an appointment after the baby is born|`|snsRyuqyaa	I don't think so
kFTtP4mraa	Im no doctor but it could be a miscarriage because i knew a girl once who told me the same thing. I'd reccomend to go see a doctor though.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Doesn't sound like one to me. If you are 5 days early that would make you approx 3 weeks and 2 days pregnant. (1 week and 2 days after conception) so any "baby" would still be practically microscopic.    I've had four miscarriages. All started out with incredible back and stomach pain, I started bleeding really heavily about 3-4 hours after the pain started, started passing "clots" within around 2 hours of the bleeding started and then ended up in such bad pain by about 5 hours after the start of the bleeding that I couldn't do anything but lie on the floor screaming in agony.    It's possibly just a normal period starting early (clots are pretty common) or implantation bleeding if you think you may have gotten pregnant in the last week or so. x|`|DApXuaJyaa	i have no idea but me personally would go doctors first thing, my mum had a miscarriage once and i think you would know cos im guessing you would bleed quite heavy, put your mind at rest book appointment good luck x|`|fdI8OtNeaa	it could be your period starting, that could have been a clot of blood.  don't panic, sometimes the pains are worse if your period is late, if your cramps persist visit your GP.|`|3WSiJU5Raa	no sounds like implation bleeding or some sort of period that is off balance..|`|602016aa7f99bac454bdfa2b02ce7b96aa	If youre period is five days early it won't be a miscarriage, an embryo at this point is not even the size of a pin-head.  It sounds like you're just having an early period to me.  If you are worried go to the drs  good luck
IFqY2w1Paa	I read about sharp pains from heartburn, ligaments, and strain. That might be what you were feeling. If not, were you feeling the pain intermittently as part of the BH contractions? If so, that could have been part of the contractions. I've personally never experienced that or heard about the pain being in the middle of the back during contractions. My back usually hurts right there because of strain. Usually, contractions in the back are felt in the lower back. They also feel like the pain is radiating from the lower back and it wraps around to the front of the belly. BH contractions usually don't hurt (they do for me sometimes, though), and they are only felt in the abdomen.    Regardless, ask your doctor about it. Good luck and congrats! =)

BUI9HnH1aa	breast feed ur baby and make sure u pump at least a days worth of feeds for the 4th july . While u are drinking u only need to " pump and dump" if u are engorged and need Relief . Alcohol leaves the breast milk after a certain amount of time ( like it leaves ur blood stream) . Give at least an hour for every drink u have . So when u have no alcohol left in ur blood it is safe to breast feed bub again.  This is what my doctor told me because i wanted to get trashed for christmas.  Only 2% of the alcohol u drink will make it to the breast milk .  u can store breast milk in the fridge for up to 5 days   if u deep freeze it for around 6 months . but once defrosted it must be use within 24 hrs|`|KozoNqpsaa	Wow. Liquor is that important to you that you would give up breastfeeding just to get tanked on one day?     But since it sounds like you are considering nursing, why not at least nurse your baby during the month of June then? You can also pump ahead of time and freeze breast milk.|`|tbZNMfAsaa	You are already planning on getting trashed on july 4th and it's only February 2nd? How old are you?|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	How can you not breastfeed. Don't get trashed. Lets not be selfish and think about your child. You might just get lucky and the baby might not like to breastfeed and want formula. My daughter hated the test of breast milk.|`|jHuQjrzOaa	DUHHH you shouldn't breastfeed if your going to let yourself loose...*REMEMBER* the baby is eating what ever you are when you breastfeeding as well as when your pregnant....|`|bVRgrvDbaa	you can still breastfeed. Don't breastfeed when you drink though. & depending on how much you do drink, maybe you shouldn't breastfeed the day after. You have to wait until all of the alcohol is out of your system.   If anything breastfeed & bottle feed.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	you can drink and still breastfeed you just have to be smart about it. I would say pump enough breast milk for the night BEFORE YOU drink and the alcohol will leave your system within a certain amount of time depending on how much you drink so ask your child's pediatrician how long you need to wait on breastfeeding after drinking. like i said if anything just pump enough milk for the day. and DO NT drink if you have to take care of the baby|`|IFqY2w1Paa	It's recommended that nursing mothers abstain from alcohol completely when breastfeeding, but an occasional drink has not been found to cause any harm. You shouldn't get completely intoxicated (it will affect your breastmilk), but having a drink should be fine.

HVXtd2Ryaa	The most important thing is that you, your boyfriend and your baby are happy and love each other, you'll find that in most cases there will be a family member against the relationship no matter what. It will only break you up if you allow it to get to you, your mother had her chance of loving and making a family with who she chose and now it's your turn.    And eight months pregnant! You only have a few weeks to go before you and your boyfriend are holding your gorgeous little baby in your arms! Also being pregnant your hormones are very unbalanced which could be another reason as to why you're feeling so sad.    I hope you feel better soon, remember that this is your life and your babies life, make it so that you are both happy, don't worry about what other people (even your mother) think.|`|EFXT4rj2aa	look your pregnate you should be happy. if you really love him stay with him. don't let anyone else make your choises for you.|`|GQEJVyDnaa	if he is willing to take care of you and your baby you dnt need your families approval.If this is someone yo uwant to be with then go for it, is she is raciest or not she is being judgmental on people she doesnt even know, dnt stress it, because in the end your already pregnant with his child.|`|Jjx90cCQaa	I know how u feel, my mom hates my boyfriend too when she has to reason to cuz she doesn't give him a chance. Don't worry, he must love u because he dropped out of college just to help support u and the baby. Just ignore what everyone says! They are just jealous because they don't have the love that u guys have! Calm down, it's not good for the baby just be grateful that u guys will share a beautiful baby together.
RT3Og4Oiaa	No matter what she was referring to ....she had no right commenting on your purchases like she did. And then turning around and telling you what she thought was better.   That is taught to you when you go into most retail jobs. Its called customer service training.   I know when I started with Safeway, I had to go through 2 days of nothing but "Superior Customer Service" Training, and one of the topics was, do not judge ANYONE on ANYTHING they buy..you know you are not even suppose to talk politics with the customer?  So what she did was far out of line, she had no right to even talk to you about that. And as far as her attitude, well they are the worst paid in retail..but still she is paid to do her job regardless, bad day or not.   If I was you, I would look at the receipt, call in the morning when you know the Big Boss man should be there and tell him exactly what happened, who the clerk was( register   and Employee name or ID should be on it) and tell them how rude she was..Im sorry that happen..I have met and worked with many people like that..and I admit, there have been maybe once or twice I have made my remarks, but a lot of times I was provoked.     And speaking of some RUDE people **Clears Throat* never mind!!!|`|14JQ11AUaa	Absolutely agree with you, I would have been upset with her!|`|SaRDq9iLaa	Yes, I agree it was rude.  I don't understand why people think they can just say anything to anyone!  They need to keep their opinions to themselves!  I do breastfeed my daughter but I don't go around telling people that they should... it's their decision and has nothing to do with me.  I'm sorry for her comment towards you!|`|AA11481889	Ya that was rude...but more importantly...it was unprofessional....as an employee on the job...it isn't her place to give parental advice while on the clock for walmart...and i would have told her as much.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	"too bad you aren't breastfeeding, it's much better...you know for your baby"  Your reply " I had no idea the role of a Walmart checkout chick was so versatile. You can scan items and give advice on infant health. Perhaps I should stop seeing my child's pediatrician and rely on your medical knowledge and expertise instead'?    Yes she was rude.  Yes, she should learn to mind her own business. But most mothers receive rude comments and unhelpful advice from strangers regardless of whether or not they, the mothers , are breast feeding or formula feeding. When it comes to motherhood you're damned if you do and your damned if you don't.   Regarding "do your own thinking's" sarcastic and ridiculous comparison. I'd think it were rude if a checkout operator made a comment on the fact that I was buying butter instead of olive oil. Because what I feed myself is nobody's business. What I feed my child is nobody's business. Either scenario would probably make me aggravated.|`|wKYdIaZVaa	Of course that's rude!!! If that would have been me, I would have flipped my lid! I would have told her, "It's none of your business how I decide to feed my child, and your opinion has no importance to me"... but then again.. people call me a b*%$! because I often speak my mind when it comes to people like that....    My latest rude encounter was the other day at Publix (local supermarket). This lady in front was purchasing her monthly supply of baby formula with her WIC coupons. I personally didn't care and took this time to read my magazine in line and entertain Chloe. It probably took close to ten minutes. When the lady leaves, the cashier says to me "Sorry about that, its that time of the month where you get all those people trying to buy food with the taxpayers money"    I looked at him in shock... I couldn't believe he'd say something like that. I responded, "I know being a Publix cashier must be sooo difficult, but I think ringing up customers like her IS part of your job. Maybe you would have rung her up faster if you knew how to do your job better." I then grabbed my purchases and walked away. I contemplated speaking to the manager, but he got lucky that Chloe was in the cart crying.     Yeah.. I have a problem when people who work in a field where good customer service is essential, yet have absolutely no common decency.|`|6jN3g0x8aa	If I had a dime for every rude person I met...hmmmm|`|AA10093245	Wow, that was rude. But you handled it in a very classy way.|`|kRui5wGtaa	That's when I would have made something up and said...too bad I take a medication that doesn't allow me too. And then I would have pretended to cry lol|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	as you say it was a comment  and since she saw you buying milk she just assume that you are not breastfeeding   her cooment may have been personal but it was just that a comment I don't think it was rude|`|Hm7DHFPJaa	I am currently 30 weeks with my first child and already have been asked about breastfeeding several times. I had pre-pregnancy hypertension and am unable to breastfeed due to medication. I know that I am not a mom yet, but I understand where you are coming from. I have never felt so much pressure from people on an issue. Of coarse I know breast milk is best, but mine will injure my child and when someone asks about if I will or not and I just say no without an explanation I get sneers and chastised by people that are perfect strangers. So, I understand the rudeness you encountered. People should really mind there own business.|`|BOWa3Abbaa	I don't think she meant it to be that way. She probably has a baby too and has opinion's about breastfeeding? The grumpy look probably has nothing to do with you but the fact that Walmart's pay is crap. You didnt say anything you thought was insulting back so I give you 1 Kudo.|`|5b3cd64667a391942de231867c44d64caa	lol complain to the manager - I would. That's personal.. let's see her frown her way out of that!    I had a similar thing where the guy at the counter said the same thing "that's expensive isn't it" then he said "I hope it's worth it". And I'm thinking yeah, actually. Feeding my baby IS worth it.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	I am a breastfeeding mommy and believe on should breastfeed but that was a really tacky thing for a complete stranger to say to someone who wasn't asking for her opinion...I would have said ya to bad I don't get WIC and get the stuff for free...|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	Yeah..well apparently just bc my son wasn't with me today when going to the laundry mat, to put my clothes in the dryer, MEANS that I am dumbass enough to leave MY SON in our apartment all by himself while I dry clothes. That's what some of my older elderly neighbors thought today. I just thought it was totally rude bc they perceived that I am stupid bc I am a younger mom.|`|uMIvRRjoaa	I guess I have a thick skin, because I've dealt with formula comments rather easily.   You should see the crap bargain shoppers go through. Talk about rude- managers try to make up rules on the spot so people can't safe a buck.    GinaP- not sure if you'll see this, but from what I know some hypertension meds are quite safe while bfing. I won't say all, but from the research I've done some of the common ones are:  http://66.230.33.248/discus/messages/45/...    Just something to think about.|`|sAAnquoTaa	I agree with you...she didn't have the right to say that to you.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Some people lack a common sense and tact.  I'm so sorry someone so rude to you.  Don't take it personally though.      I had the same thing happen when my son was a baby.  Due to medical reasons I had to switch him to formula.  One woman saw me loading up my cart with a couple cans of Enfimil and she had the gall to tell me that my baby would have a been better off breast fed.  I wasn't in such a great mood so ended up snapping at her telling her to "stick it".  Not my most shining moment, but my son was all of 6 weeks old and I was running on 3 hours of sleep.    "Do your own thinking"-  She's not looking for smart aleck remarks.  Take your sarcasm elsewhere!|`|EtCRnDJMaa	You have to understand that there are some women out there who are so gun ho on nursing.  Those who are bottle feeders sometimes don't understand those who are breast feeders; and the other way around.      You have to learn to be quick on your feet when you don't like what some stranger says to you, but you can do it in a nice way that gets the point across.  Don't let people get to you or you'll drive yourself crazy.      And another thing-  I always use the self check out for this reason!!!  Even with a cart full of stuff and with 3 girls.  I can't remember the last time I let a Wal*Mart cashier check check my stuff out.   My 8 yr old also loves to scan, so this can help sometimes and sometimes not!!!    Yes, I have run into someone rude.  I was looking for a new living room set and my 3 girls were with me.  They were so excited to check out all the furniture and sat on everything.  I even had a sales guy with me who was talking to my girls and helping out with trying to find something for us.  This lady came by and asked my girls if this is how they do their furniture at home.  My oldest girl said "yes, it is, don't you?"  Then the lady told me I should be ashamed and that i had rude misbehaved kids.  Then she walked away.  The sales guy and I were just speechless.  Then he went to find this lady to ask to her to leave the store.  I took my girls and went into the bathroom to cry.  I felt like staying in there forever.  I got over it though!|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Oh GAWD! I HATE Wal-mart and most of the employees! Honestly a lot of the patrons are horrid too! You should IM me sometimes and I can share my horror stories of Wal-mart. I always go back though. You can't beat the pricing!    If I were you I would say something to her manager! The NERVE!!!!!    ---------  LOL at the thumbs down. Obviously you've never been to the Wal-Mart in my town or you would be singing the same tune. LOL!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Personally, I don't think a store clerk should ever comment on the purchases of the customer.  Ever, it's ridiculous.    That said, the best response I ever heard to someone who hassles you about the way you feed your child was on another message board.  The mom said    "Oh...you must be confused.  We don't love *this* baby!"|`|ggETPqedaa	I honestly know what you mean. I don't breastfeed, I tried. But ended back up in the hospital after I got out and then ended with an infection.  I couldn't at the end, but all the remarks get to me.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I agree, it's rude. You generally don't talk about your breasts in public, so why should she?    She works at Walmart, wouldn't you be grouchy?|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	maybe she didnt mean it being rude and it was just a comment . you never know i doubt she wanted to upset you but people should think more about what they say .|`|XzV4bUeFaa	She probably is one of the ones who are really gung-ho about breast feeding.  I believe she was just trying to let you know that not only is it better but "cheaper", since you don't have to buy formula.  Today many people are rude.  Have you ever noticed in stores where the salespeople are talking on their cell phones on personal calls while you're waiting for help.  Or, talking about personal issues w/each other in full earshot of customers?  BTW I bottle fed too!|`|gGW7K9U5aa	Wow, that is rude! One time I was in Walmart and my son, who was about 1 1/2 at the time, was having a breakdown. I went to the dressing room while my husband was with him and the clerk there told the other worker that her grandchildren would never act that way in public. I didnt say anything because I knew I would of probably gotten thrown out of there for the things I truely wanted to say. But I got her name from the nametag and went to customer service and told them what she said. I gave them her name and said that she didnt know I was the mother but I was very disappointed with their employees.    I would really recommend you going to customer service. Walmart is very strict on how their workers treat their customers. My husband worked there when we were dating and he knows that for every complaint you get a warning, I think you only get 2 warnings and your fired.    That was very rude of her.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	Yes rude people are just people that we will have to deal with in our lifetime. And there will always be a good number of them. But you did the right thing, you answerd her kindly. And let it go. & That's all you can do...As long as you know your a good mother and you take care of your baby...Why does anyone esle's statements matter?|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	Actually yes, just a little while ago, but it wasn't in person.      I will add the link.    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    Edit:  Hint Hint = I would like some *cupcakes* right now.  =)    You can see I addressed her "comment".  I have no idea what would possess someone to say such a thing....ugh.    But I do agree that was rude of her.  I probably would have said something I shouldn't have lol.  I agree that people in customer service should keep their mouth shut to a customer's personal business, they have no idea what their life is like.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	i would be insulted by that.  i took my daughter to the doctors when she was about 3 months old. as i was sitting out in the waiting room she stirred and needed her bottle. I picked her up, and gave her the bottle i had bought as she was due then. A women across the waiting room glared at me and leaned towards the man next to her and said these days "there needs to be something done about these young girls who wont look after their babies and bottle feed".   some people have no tact!|`|Grmsgziaaa	I would have told her "I couldnt breastfeed for whatever reason (fill in the blank)" What a biznitch, and yes, here in Mexico the only thing is breastfeeding, I dont, and I get crap all the time, where were they when I needed the support at the beginning right? I get crap about it everywhere I go, when I whip out the bottle I get evil eyes, I have resorted to feeding her in the car.    I would have told her manager and or slapped her silly.      ETA: People are against anything you know, if your breastfeeding in public you get comments, or if you bottlefeed. Its annoying.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	she doesn't sound that rude to me by saying that. I was on WIC for awhile and used my voucher to get some formula at the grocery store Lucky's, and I made a comment to myself about how small it was---the powdered can---in surprise. the clerk heard me, and she said "yeah, well, breastfeeding is better cause it's free". I told her I AM breastfeeding and just supplement sometimes, and she nodded and said "that's good". I wasn't offended, I don't think she meant it to be rude at all.   I agree it was a little out of line for her to say that to you, and none of her business, but I honestly think she wasn't trying or intending to be rude, I think she was actually making conversation with you and in that sense being friendly. some people just say stuff to make small talk and they don't realize what they're saying might sound offensive. In fact she'd be more rude in my opinion if she just kept acting grumpy and didn't make small talk with you, and instead just rang you up and said the total in a  grumpy voice, in my opinion that would be far more rude.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	she wasn't being mean or rude. you are the one with the problem. she was just stating a fact and that is that. i mean hey she probably bresast fed her who knows and its ok for her to make a comment she really meant nothing by that statement you seem to be one to take everything off note i am sorry you are that way there are so many beautiful people ou t there to meet i meet them all the time.|`|AA12339451	You should of replied with something like "too bad you don't have a better job..a bank teller would be so much better ..you know for yourself!" lol    Walmart cashiers can come off as cocky know it alls..just the other day they wanted to see my daughters id for bottled water. WTH?|`|jNErU39iaa	OH MY GOD YES!  When I went for my 6 week check up, I took a bottle of expressed milk in with me incase my daughter needed a top up feed, and because I wore a dress (because I thought it would be easier for the check up) I couldn't breastfeed until I got home to change.    My own OB/GYN says 'Oh I see you've given up on breastfeeding, I expected that - most young mothers usually do.' I was SO insulted. But I just bit my tongue and replied 'It's actually expressed milk!'    Some people are so rude and just jump to conclusions, they have no idea what they are on about!|`|rAkWoweOaa	Next time you go, tell her since she knows it all, to quit walmart and become a la leche leader.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	You made me laugh, sorry! Not laughing at you mind you just at the description of choking her with her wlamart apron LOL   I agree it's very rude, and she doesnt know and doesnt have to know the reasons why you're not breastfeeding and it's none of her business!!  I hate when strangers meddle so much with one's life!!|`|FdQD8H3qaa	I know what you mean... Even if it is someone I know they aren't in my shoes so they need to shut-up...  When I had my son my nurse was a complete pain.  They asked me if I was going to nurse and I said no and my first nurse just said okay and put it in the notes... well when I had my son there had been a shift change. I know that the new nurse had read the file but once my son was born she asked me if I was going to nurse... I said no and she clicked her tongue at me and told be that it was so much better for my son to nurse.... I said thanks but we are going with the formula and she left the room... It took her over a half hr to go and get the bottle for my son and then she only brought one in....  I was so glade when I was moved into recovery because I had a really nice nurse there and she brought in a bunch of the ready to feed bottles...  I just couldn't believe that the first nurse was so rude!!!  People have no right to say anything about it... How do they know??  They don't!!  I didn't want to nurse because I have a history of depression and felt that it would be better for me to not have such the huge weight of being the only food source for my son.  I'm really glade that I went with the formula!  I was able to have a lot of help from my husband even with nighttime feedings!  And also it's not their right to judge because how do they know weather or not you did try and couldn't!?! People don't think before they speak... I mean if you had tried and wasn't able to nurse maybe you would have felt bad enough to be using formula and her saying anything would just remind you of all of the hardships you had gone through all ready!  As a mother I beat myself up enoughso I don't need others doing it to!!!|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	Yes. I have met many people at least that rude.|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I had to go to the ER for extreme abdominal pain (it was a ruptured cyst caused by unbalanced hormones 5 weeks after having had a miscarriage and subsequent DNC) and was asked if I had ever had surgery. I told the doctor that I had a DNC five weeks earlier and he asked me if it was elective (meaning he thought I had an abortion because DNC is the same procedure in some cases). It was elective but not for the reason that he thought. He then proceeded to asked me about my sexual partners and if I thought I could have an STD. I was horrified!    Seven hours later, after a pelvic, having my bladder filled with saline, an ultrasound, a CT scan, and many insulting remarks, they finally called my doctor and said I had a cyst that ruptured.     He did apologize, but I still couldn't believe how rude he was! Horrible bedside manner!|`|bL3rzrEYaa	It seems that when you have a new baby, everyone seems to think that they know better than you do (especially if you are a first time mom, such as myself). It drove me crazy, and I really snapped at people for telling me what they thought. I couldn't breastfeed my daughter due to her being premature, I saw a lactation consultant and everything and still couldn't get her to latch. So I pumped for 3 months (borrowed a pump from WIC), and then switched to formula because I will be returning to work soon and will have to time to pump. And everyone says, "Oh...you stopped breastfeeding, that's unfortunate". And I'm like okay is that a bad thing??? Some people don't breastfeed at all, and their children still grow and prosper so what is the big deal? Even the lady at the WIC place, when I asked to get help with formula b/c my husband was laid off, she said to me, "Well why aren't you breastfeeding, if you keep trying hard enough she will latch", and I was like omg I cannot believe this rude snot is trying to tell me what to do with my baby. Yes I tried, but if I hadn't, that's none of your business! She even made me try and breastfeed the baby there at the WIC office, before she would even give me my formula!!! Unreal, let me tell you. All of my friends have formula fed their children and they are perfectly healthy.    So yes lol I totally know what you mean.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	I would have found it rude as well.  It's none of her business.  I would have been offended even if it was an acquaintance that I knew.
4fIE3Eb2aa	It's very unique and very cute for a girl! And the whole matching her daddy's name is adorable. ? Good luck darling. xx|`|980cd82a18459010574ced1a4cc818f1aa	That's a pretty name.|`|SCc6f3Uraa	I love it.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I love the name Brylan Faith that is pretty. But I still like Brianna that is my daughters name.|`|AA11138222	Unless you call her by both her first and middle name, it sounds kinda masculine. :( I think I would have gone with Bryn, or Brya, or something else.|`|oVkeP1lvaa	Love it? ...very creative|`|YgggHhwuaa	I love it! It is a great unique take on Brian.
PAjHWRhsaa	Well, I'd start looking to be friend with older girls. I'm 22, and all my best girl friends are 28 or 29. I relate more to them because I grew up with older cousins and older siblings. Just be yourself. In class get in a group of people you don't know and act yourself and kinda introduce yourself and say what's up and stuff. Having a small party or cookout works wonders. Not necessarily a slumber party, but a grill out would be good. We have one like every other weekend and always new people coming around.|`|Dhsyroekaa	be careful tho, most girls can be b*tches.   Join a team or some club, there are girls there.   Or even at school.  when your old enough to go to the bar, its easy to meet girl friends there!|`|XQexuxy4aa	try out for a team ... rowing is awsome. maybe basketball .. or hockey , ringette if ur more girly .. maybe join dance lessons... if ur on a team u'll bond .. lessons u just laugh at each other when people fall on their *** so u become friends :P ...
4AO2myzKaa	Well, on occassions like this I would be taking a nap instead of going online...that's just me though (since your child is being cared for).  Your dad may be nice and keep watching her a little longer for you to get some shut eye.  Basically, take every opportunity to nap, and when you aren't napping, try to do low key activities, like watch a movie with your daughter.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	You just have to push through it.  Ask for help when you feel like you need it and get your sleep!  When I am really tired I take my daughter to the park first thing after breakfast and let her run around and get her energy out and then I lay down with her for a nap.  It does not always work since it seems like she has endless energy, but I know I can catch up on my sleep sooner or later.  Just enjoy her while she is young it won't last forever and those teenage years will creep up fast!  Before you know she will be slamming doors in your face!!! : )  Good luck.|`|VHHis05Naa	Starbucks, exercise, and getting a good night's sleep.|`|j2mRop0laa	I feel like that right now. I'm about to fall asleep, I don't feel good etc. My kids are older (6 and 10) and I probably could go take a 45 minutes nap and ask my oldest to wake me at exactly such and such time, but I still can't. I have to make dinner soon. Which I really don't feel like doing. I almost want to declare it *chicken nugget night*. But, instead I'll chug some diet coke and put in a movie for all of us on the couch.|`|d94d376d37270864191dbd4310431caaaa	I am not a single mom but have the same issue.  I have a 9 month old and he has been getting so many teeth, I haven't slept 8 hours in months.  I try to take a quick cat nap if I can or I drink green tea - good for you at least.  Maybe try getting some more help from family, and when you get it - rest instead of y/a   :  )|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	you should be napping right now while shes gone, just 20minutes, no longer. cat naps help restore your energy. eating healthy helps and coffee helps, if you dont like coffee, drink caffinated tea. see if your daughter will lay down with you to watch a movie and even if its for 15minutes, you can relax and rest your eyes, if she still naps, take a cat nap while she sleeps, and make sure you get enough sleep at night|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	If you are tired then just rest up at any opportunity you get.  When she naps you can nap too.  It is a hard job being a mommy!|`|apUkTo3maa	SIT DOWN AND WATCH A MOVIE WITH THEM AND THEN YOU CAN TAKE A LITTLE NAP. YOU HAVE TO PUT AN INTRESTING MOVIE ON FOR THEM|`|myEwHgI1aa	OK, you had someone pick your daughter up for a bit, and you didn't take a nap? Seriously, sometimes you need to give yourself that pleasure just to recharge. Does your little girl still take naps, or at least have quiet time? If she does, allow yourself to have some too. Also, try to get to bed sooner ,and eat a healthy diet with lots of protein and water, and take some vitamins. Exercise also can help give some energy, believe it or not.   Hope these suggestions can help.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I'm a single mom to so I know how hard it is and the night before last night my sister took my baby over night so that I could just get some sleep before work. I'm tired and I need rest, maybe someone could take your daughter for a while.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	When they are young it does seem to take more energy to keep up with them.  Now that my kids are 8 and 10 it doesn't seem to sap my energy as much as it's stressful helping with homework, after school activities, dinner, baths etc. (and I've got a very helpful husband).  I couldn't imagine going it alone!  Thank goodness for GRANDPA!!!!    Make sure you are getting enough sleep and eating healthy and if you can sneak in some kind of exercise every day, do it.  Truthfully, taking care of yourself makes a difference in your energy levels.    Good Luck!|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	I'm not a single mom but I also have a baby, house, and husband to look after as well as a full time job. My best advice is to take short naps whenever possible. Since my daughter is just under 4 months I have the luxury of allowing her to sleep on me while I pass out for a few minutes. Otherwise I just keep going hoping that one day I'll get rest. Good luck!|`|aMZ7IKysaa	I feel ya.  I have a 6 year old in school, but I am a nanny to a 12 month old and 22 month old from 7 am to 4 pm, every day..  At 4 pm my husband and daughter get home and its right into dinner and family time, no break for mom!  When I get really exhausted, I just crank up the music.  Trying to keep yourself busy and dancing around to music is the best way to stay up and keep your spirits up as well :)|`|AA12085256	First ask yourself why are you tired.  Are you eating right, exercising, taking vitamins, getting the rest you need, drinking enough water...?  Often times as a mother we tend to forget that we need to eat right and take care of our bodies too.  We feed our children healthy foods while we ourselves nibble on junk through out the day.  We give them Flintstone vitamins, while we leave our half empty bottle on the counter promising we will get to it later, but never do.  Also, what time is your little darling going to bed?  She must have a bed time that you two stick with.  You need "mommy me" alone time.  Give her a bath, read her a book and than put her in her own bed.  Make it a daily routine.  Good Luck!|`|TQW5E6olaa	If I was in your place, I'd be napping since she's with someone else. Then I'd get a latte with 2 shots of Espresso.    I'm pretty good about energy unless i'm sick. Make sure you drink plenty of water, being dehydrated will make you feel tired. Also, eat a balanced diet, so you have the fuel you need to do it all. Also, try to get at least 6 hours of sleep each night.     On those bad days where I am just soooo tired, I get a latte|`|OeD2sJt7aa	When I get like this I pop a Wiggles DVD in.  It's educational enough for me not to feel guilty and exciting enough to keep her glued!  I have the "Sailing Around the World" one and "Top of the Tots."  The Wiggles are one of the VERY FEW children entertainers that don't drive me crazy!
r7q8LW7Aaa	ah yer a handsome fella for sure. I'd say pregnancy is unlikely, but perhaps you should take a test!  Feck! ****! Drink!|`|LZagOwOKaa	You're a sweet natured retired (male?) priest who's thinking about annihilating a little ball of cells in your cobweb covered, or perhaps nonexistent womb?- Mate I think you had too much to drink. By the way, you're beautiful.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	You keep the alcohol levels in your blood much too high to ever get pregnant. You probably aren't having periods anymore because you are going through the menopause...sorry mate.

Will you let us know where you stuff the pregnancy tester.  With your looks no wonder she couldn't control herself.  If you have no month after pill the only way out is the cyanide pill.

What is the point in this really thanks for the 2 points tho|`|ygimTNzoaa	I think the few instances that that's happened you are DEFINITELY a pregnant man, and most likely will be having octuplets or even more. You're a sexy man so you'll have no problem finding a hott supermodel to support you and your large coming family.

d1027f6834f2f2660c8aa9290737073eaa	I started out at 100 lbs barely, and followed the diet that I was given by a health care professional. I followed it to a T and gained 65 lbs! It wasn't all baby and took a few months to drop but I got rid of it all!  I worked out my whole pregnancy too and didn't eat junk food so I don't know what made me gain so much weight.    Anyway, I have known many women to use the excuse of "I'm eating for 2" just to pig out. One lady I know gained about 120 lbs because of thinking like that.    So my answer is yes and no. Small people like me gain a lot of weight some times, maybe cuz we were given a stupid diet to follow, and other people gain a lot because they think they can.|`|SKJb6eLKaa	No, You can get dietbetes if you gain too much weight during your pregnancy.. I don't suppose that would be fun.    With my daughter I gained a lot.. I regretted it because it was mostly un-needed fat from MacDonalds! I weighed 100 before I got pregnant with my daughter, she's now 17 mos, my son is now 5 wks, and I'm 145|`|wMrR4gqYaa	You cant eat whatever you want, you only need about 300 extra calories, so yeah I guess if you eat whatever you want because your eating for two, you dont understand the other one your eating for isnt a whole person who needs a meal for every meal you eat especially early on when its sooo tiny. Or you can cause yourself to have serious problems, too much weight gain is very bad, high blood pressure, preeclampsia, gestinal diabetes  So moderate eating and watching what you are eating, say veggies instead of a whole box of cookies cause you can. Some women have trouble accepting that their bodies need more food then normal and adequate weight gain because of societies obsession with watching your weight or you spent your whole life trying to lose a couple of pounds, you may find it very difficult to get over that thinking, but your body will def let you know.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	No all of us do. And anyway. I think men should try creating a life and carrying it for nine months... Then we'll see if they complain about the small joys in life,like eating a medium pepperoni pizza all by ourselves!|`|AA11885437	well, the first 3 months of pregnancy even the smell of food makes you nauseous, and many women loose wight during this time, or gain very little then the next 3 months you can eat but I also had many food aversions so basically I was a picky eater. The last 3 months baby is taking up so much room you can only manage a few bites before you are full so any full meal in a sitting is out of the question. So women who are able to have an eating fest are lucky IMO.|`|AA10652271	I watched what I ate when I was pregnant so I would not have to lose that much weight after I had the baby.|`|0TW0zoZUaa	I don't think most women practice no holds bar eating habits while pregnant...we shouldn't generalize...with that being said though I think maybe a lot of women do eat a lot because of their cravings.  Women should follow a strict ADA diet to avoid risk factors for heavy weight gain and gestational diabetes. If a mother does contract gestational diabetes it also has a huge impact on weight gain.  So other than people overeating while they are pregnant...there are other factors that contribute to weight gain.  The average size woman is supposed to gain between 25-35lbs during their pregnancy.|`|veO1RXrCaa	Yes it can happen.  But most that I know are more likely to give into a craving here and there then go on a full out binge.  I would rather not gain a ton of weight bc its not good for you or the baby.  Its a old stereotype/wives tale that you eat for two when pregnant.|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	Some women do speaking from personal experience I'm on my second pregnancy all you need is an additional 500-600 calories a day on top of a normal well balanced diet some women just don't realize after you have the baby you lose about 25 lbs in baby and fluids everything above the 25lbs is yours to keep|`|RPszYGXkaa	No it isn't always just happy eating.  Many women are conscious of their food choices to be sure they are healthy and gain a normal amt of weight.  I tried to eat well and balanced, and gained about 18 lbs.  My cousin is currently pregnant, and was very fit and active prior to conceiving.  She has been eating more not just bc she feels like it, but honestly, when you think you are going to get sick, it helps to eat bread , crackers, etc....so she has gained 25 lbs in a few months.  Now my sis on the other hand did gain 80 lbs by eating whatever she wanted.  A few months after giving birth she found a grocery list from when she was pregnant ...the list was:  cake  ice cream  ice pops  chips  soda    we all had a nice chuckle about it afterwards!
wl7tlYOYaa	Lol thats too cute too bad u didnt have the cam corder u could of posted it it would of been so much fun to see it!
QXSFpMzDaa	Honey if you had sex...protected or not...or if he came or not....there is ALWAYS a chance.  If you decide to have sex you really need to ask yourself if you are ready to be a parent.  if you answer no than don't have sex.|`|JpH6FAlBaa	hahaha you ovulated a little bit hahaha...ANYTIME you have unprotected sex or don't use birth control there is a chance of pregnancy..do you honestly think that all the people in the world were conceived lets say the 3rd day after ovulation..heavens girl..go get the pill ..then you wont have to worry about it..you know soon your questions will be about cute names for baby if you are not careful..old enough to lay down old enough to get the pill|`|70c1c2e410f2cdd8e3cd8235784e9689aa	There is ALWAYS a chance you can get pregnant.  And, I'm not sure what you mean by saying you ovulated a little bit.  You either ovulated or you didn't.  It's not something that happens over time.|`|PfhoajH6aa	sorry for the cliche but there's always the chance.   On a more helpful note:  by ovulating do you mean having your period, because if you had your period after 21 days from the encounter it's highly unlikely that your pregnant as your shedding an egg, meaning it wasn't fertilized. Even if it was a little bit of blood, your body hormonally isn't coming across as pregnant.    Are you feeling any symptoms of pregnancy?(try to think back to the days just after the encounter). Nausea (but normally you throw-up), headaches, anything strange?    Recommend highly: Take home Pregnancy Test.(It's a stick with hormone indicator that you pee on.) About 13 bucks at rite aide for 3 or 4.
HNLskA4Aaa	when you say "ACCIDENTALLY" using commas, was it really obvious to you that she bumped into you in a fake way? Just get to know him. Asking him is fine, but i dont think you should make the first move.|`|NSXGQBkAaa	Just talk to him more. That's not enough hints to figure that out.|`|NuvKPl3naa	i would just talk to him, sounds like he likes you. if not no harm done in talking to him.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	why dont you ask him?  i dont know the guy, how am i supposed to know?
gT80ocBwaa	Yes, I did. A woman knows her body and she knows when she's pregnant.|`|UEHm04oUaa	Yes and no.  I was somewhat in denial before the test since my doctor had told me I'd never become pregnant, but when it showed positive I wasn't the least bit surprised.|`|qCj3BzWZaa	I didnt know but my dad told me 2 weeks before i knew that i was prego that i was.. its kinda werid.. he also told me 2 weeks b4 i could find out the baby's sex that it was a boy.. and it was true|`|Adq6y8tXaa	yes i was positive that i was pregnant before i took the test!|`|BIC5BlAHaa	yeah... i felt it also|`|1CgSVXxXaa	I did. I thought i was pregnant from a few days after conception lol. The test just confirmed what i already knew.|`|SKJb6eLKaa	With Presley, No because I wasn't worried about pregnancy because I was the average 14 y/o lol..  But with Anton, I KNEW. And I cried. And I cried. And I cired. Then I tested. And It was positive.     He's now 5 wks old and 1 of the 3 loves of my life ;)|`|HclKftzAaa	No. I had been TTC for 2 yrs, and there was NO WAY i was going to get my hopes up again. It took 3 HPTs, confirmation from my obgyn that provera doesn't cause false positives, a blood test and an early scan for me to start to enjoy the pregnancy! lol.    I took a test because provera didn't start my period. The only reasons i could find for this were pregnancy or sterility. I had convinced myself it couldn't possibly be pregnancy, and would not have been surprised if the test had been negative.     I had expected to be vomiting when i got pregnant. Haven't puked once and i'm 30 weeks now. Because i hadn't thrown up, i didn't believe i was pregnant at first. lol.
PFO1jxZGaa	If they are giving you an option to stay with them and to help with the baby and you love him then why would you even consider leaving him and having your grandma pay for an abortion? I think its pretty easy choice. Just tell your grand ma that you love him and they have offered to have you live with them and although you love her (grandma) you think its a better choice for you and the baby. And do it as soon as possible|`|wl7tlYOYaa	I understand u love ur grandma but if she wants u to have an abortion and leave the bf that u love when u dont want to that makes u wonder about how much ur happiness is important to her. At the end the road ur gonna regrett having an abortion and leaving him. Marry him have the baby be happy...Tell ur grandma u made a decision and if she loves u she will respect it. Good luck.|`|1WRB7RPNaa	it seems as if you already have your mind set.|`|5SHPRfUgaa	I think it would be a very wise choice if you went and married the father of your unborn baby. Plus you want too so why not?|`|EoawVhBTaa	be with your boyfriend. eventually if your grandmother truly loves you shell accept it and you wont lose her. tell her as soon as youre able. but make sure you feel ready|`|JsaEk8UAaa	You didn't mention where you live. Depending on where you live you might need parental consent to get married at 16. You are making some Huge decisions right now that will affect the rest of your life. Be sure to think out both sides before making a decision. Good Luck!!|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Well if your G Mother is happy to sign the papers for you to get married and your boyfriend is happy about the pregnancy, I don't really see any problem.  You can still do all the things you wanted such as get an education.  Im sure that your Gmother will be happy for you.  Congrats.|`|x0Ftr35Laa	Honestly ... you are an adult now. If your boyfriend wants to be loyal to you and be a good daddy and you love him then go for it. You are not a child anymore and your gma will have to realize that. You said that your BF's family said that it's ok if you marry him.  1 does he want to marry you?  2 you can't marry him without your the legal consent of your guardian, what about your mom and dad?|`|n5Sx4WwYaa	your grandmother said for you to make your own decisions and i think being with your boyfriend right now sounds to me like the best option and if his family is that willing to help i would say let them you know and just tell your grandmother i love you grandma but i made an adult decision to have sex now im going to do the adult thing to do and that is to have my baby and give it all the love and respect it deserves and i promise you ppl will say mean things starting with your family but you have to stick it out not only for yourself but for your new baby i hope everything works out for you i know what you are going through|`|nZPGdcKJaa	get an abortion kiddo  you're too young!  it isn't fair of you to expect your parents or grandparents to help you. They would basically do EVERYTHING! That's selfish. if THEY wanted another kid then THEY would have had one!    basics for being a successful parent- the ideal situation:  be at least 21 (25 or older is ideal)  be 100% independent  be married  both have careers (not jobs)  both have degrees  both want kids  both have cars  have at LEAST $5,000 extra in savings just for the baby    *any idiot can have sex, it takes MUCH more to be a responsible, financially stable, and mature parent    (I've had an abortion and I am thankful everyday I had that option)|`|0TW0zoZUaa	I think that you should follow your heart.  If you know that you can go somewhere and have the real support that you need then that's what you should do.  Eventually your grandmother will come around but if you want the baby and want a loving environment for the child then go with your heart.  If you do anything different you may regret it later.  You are an adult now and you will face a lot of tuff decisions in your life.  You seem capable of making them considering you have weighed out this dillema.  Trust your instinct you will be a great mom and I think it's wonderful that your boyfriend's family is willing to help you and him...they sound like people you can learn alot from!  Good Luck|`|XRLbqtUbaa	I wouldn't be in a rush to run out and marry a guy just because we are having a baby.  He can get benefits by claiming his child...he doesn't need to be married to do that.      Military does not have free daycare...they pay just like everyone else, it is based on pay grade and rank though..|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Go for it.   How old is he?  If your grandmother will sign the papers, go ahead.  Please stay in school though.   You will go through a lot as a military spouse.   I was pregnant at 15 myself. Not ready for marriage in any case.  Like I said, go for it.   Your boyfriend's parents are awesome!!  Make sure you thank them. (and honor them by respecting their rules.)|`|veIor0Hbaa	oh sweetie. i really feel for you. I was also 16 when I became pregnant. My grandparents were preachers, mom and dad were very important figures in the society and I was very well known through my academics... I really had no idea what to do. My boyfriend's parents said I could move in with them, they would help raise the baby while I finished school, and I really loved my boyfriend whom I had been with for the majority of my middle/high school life. I didn't want to disappoint my parents, but I knew having a baby would really change things for all of my family and my boyfriends family. I told my mom, who was furious with me... it really put a stress on our relationship. However, my boyfriend was willing to support me. He would take me to my doctor appointments and got a job working at a grocery store to save some money for baby things we needed... which we ended up getting through ebay or thrift shops. We ended up having tremendous support from both families once the baby got here... babies are life changing... I really don't know what to tell you. I am now a social worker and it's my responsibility to always give options to my clients. You need to see what YOU want. Do you want to keep the baby? Would you have support from your grandmother if you wanted to keep the baby? In my opinion honey, don't marry anyone right off the bat... talk with your boyfriend- see if he is willing to take you to the doctor and support you with baby finances. If so, talk to your grandma and let her know your feelings- chances are, she will want you to be happy. There are also many programs in the US that will help with expenses-  Medicaid for the doc visits and prenatals, hospital bills, etc. There is also WIC for formula, milk, cheese, cereals for you. Weigh your options carefully. Do you want to finish school? Will his family be supportive and help you care for the baby or buy diapers when needed? There's also the option of adoption. Research all of the pros and cons of each option you have before making a decision and concentrate on you and what you want. You are the one who has to change your life. I really hope that helped in some way. I will def pray for you bc I have been there and done that. My mom still hates my husband- my boyfriend from back then- to this day... but I am happy and wouldn't trade anything for my beautiful daughter. Best of luck to you and may God Bless you.|`|B0VHifDtaa	if you your second option then go for it. do what is going to make you happy. your grandma wil get over it and will love your baby and you no matter what.   good luck and have fun with your bf|`|MbmHripJaa	I think your second choice is best. although I am not sure if you can get married yet with you being 16. Your grandmother is just upset rght now.. she will get over it once you make a REAL decision and let her know what you are going to do.. show her you can be an adult.|`|weE5FxCfaa	marry your baby's father and have your baby.  if you had an abortion when you don't want one you will regret it for the rest of your life.  you have a solution here and seems like you have a great support system from your bf's family.  a lot of girls in you situation don' t have that much and they make it work.  also with military you will have free daycare so you can finish school!!  good luck.
HclKftzAaa	i've never lied about pain to get a scan. I insisted on an early scan to date the pregnancy as i had irregular periods, but just as well, they would have been 3 weeks off with my LMP.    I agree that lying about problems just to get a scan is deplorable. Not only for the reasons you've listed there, but the fact that you have had 'pain' or 'bleeding' can affect the care you receive. It is dangerous to lie to your health care provider.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	I have noticed this to.  I don't know why people do this but its a little over the top!  I had pregnancy induced high blood pressure and later on Pre-Clampsia.  I had to have an ultrasound once every two weeks with a specialist to check my placenta.  Under those real circumstances I would rather not have had to have ultrasounds so often and have a happy healthy pregnancy instead with a normal amount of ultrasounds!!!|`|sVn0Sy7taa	nope ive never heard of women doing this.  its a bit selfish considering the ultrasound machine is there for obvious reasons,   not just because you wanna see the baby!|`|ZCSOJUYVaa	Wow, I have never personally known anyone who has done that, and at that never would have done it myself. Too many ultrasounds can be bad, but anytime I requested or asked my doctor he was happy to oblige. It might come out of pocket, but if you arent really having pains save the doctors time for someone who actually is.
m7lga8jOaa	best thing to do is not get too stressed out worrying bout dates etc.. You are more likely to conceive if you are relaxed and not focusing on it too much.  I conceived number 1, the first month of trying (not too seriously, and having fun).  I have got so stressed out over trying for number two it took me a year to get pregnant then I miscarried at 6 weeks.  Just chill and it will happen.|`|PZv52KrNaa	you need to start taking folic acid. try in the next week. if you still have the baby book the midwife gives out look at the chart at the front - it has a guide to ovulation.  have fun|`|0VHolTVEaa	Keep trying, u can also use the ovultion calcultor to work out when u are likely to conceive|`|6zVISNTZaa	Start trying next week, a couple of times in the week, and see what happens. You may not get pregnant straight away, it can take upto a year with the healthiest of people.

kWF6heS0aa	Ask your girls what they want to do. At three, they'll know.  As for you, don't push it on them, and there are ways to do pageants that isn't negative.  Pageants on top of cheer leading and gymnastics sounds like a lot, but if they're not becoming worn out or cranky then keep it up, but if their personalities start changing --STOP!  Pageants are a great way to build confidence, but there can be negative consequences.|`|8DnIXwnyaa	I'm planning to put my 15 month old son in a little mall pageant next month just for fun.  a lady my husband works with said I am going to ruin his self esteem.  He's a baby he doesn't know what we are doing!  We just thought it would be fun.  He's very social and I can see him up there waving hi to everyone.    Anyway, I think it's fine in moderation.  I don't think its ok when it is taken to the extreme.  I don;t think little girl need makeup and grown up attire.  A little contest dressed up like children I don't see a problem with. (google sunburst pageants).|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Im sorry to say this but no. If your children go threw this there whole life they might become to competitive. My daughter is starting cheer-leading next year when she turns 5. You should try that.|`|sFGgPTk3aa	I agree with the first responder.  Let your little girls be little girls.  There are so many sick, perverted people out there, why give them more reasons to be interested in little girls.  It isn't right, but the way girls dress or are dressed really makes a difference.  I'm not a big believer it all things competitive either.  This is why so many young people are on medications for depression and anxiety.  Please let your kids be kids.  They only have once chance before they grow up in no time at all.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	Don't do that to them.  Watch Toddlers in Tiaras on TLC and I am sure you will change your mind when you realize everything those poor kids go through.  You should try and teach your kids that there are more important things then their looks.|`|FhzRbgFuaa	i think no because they might become too competitive and bratty see what your girls would like to do just dont force them or push them too far im not trying to be mean though|`|Kpn4xceEaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOO! You will mess them up, and by the way you asked the question, I have a feeling you know that. Please let them be little girls!|`|kNCCrjOeaa	i dont like to force my opinions on others, but ive always been strongly against those beauty pageants when you dress your child up like little barbie dolls and have older men looking at them like they are old enough to be goggled. and u you have to be careful not to be the kind of parent who forces their ideals and dreams on their child.      once again, im not trying to force my opinion or be disrespectful.|`|kdN0iRdtaa	ok i dont think you should at all bc it will ruin ur kids life|`|RrEc4ykbaa	that's disgusting. Those kids usually end up with anxiety and eating disorders their whole lives. Let them decide what they want to do.|`|SgOVFseaaa	Oh my God, no!

32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	I like Carolina better..|`|93b7b24cc4b3ba428911ea6130ff091aaa	Caroline--its gorgeous and feminine.     carolina makes me think of north and south carolina|`|7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	Carolina is more up to date. Caroline is a older name.|`|AA11138222	Carolina. I like that it isn't the most common name in the world, but can still be pronounced.|`|oVkeP1lvaa	Caroline?|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Caroline (Carolina is a state)|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Carolyn, because it's classier.|`|mFAJG2E8aa	Caraline!  SPELLED THAT WAY!  So you can call her Cara instead of Carol.|`|YgggHhwuaa	Caroline is classy. I had a student names Carolina and she was a little slow.|`|HivQdKgwaa	Caroline|`|ZPxmuy2Naa	caroline because carolina is a state  it just sounds not normal no offense pluse there are nicknames for caroline.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Carolina (if it's pronounced karo-LEE-nah) it's a bit more interesting.|`|CxRJwJsraa	Caroline. It just feels a bit less princessy and but still elegant.|`|BxpGdVTOaa	Caroline is my favorite...I think. Both are so pretty. I usually adore names with an a at the end, but I think of the state....  Of course, that might not matter to you.|`|HNLskA4Aaa	sorry, carolina sounds like a state. I choose caroline.|`|kdW99oHvaa	I prefere Caroline. Its not that I don't like Carolina, its just that it sounds more...well ok c'mon, its a state. But they're both beautiful, but Caroline is not a state :]|`|4fIE3Eb2aa	Caroline! It's more girly. :) Carolina reminds me of South and North Carolina ha ha. The name Caroline would be well suited with 'Rose' As a middle name. |`|G02vO6Jwaa	Caroline. that's a pretty name i never thought of it. ^.^|`|aa28bb262958273d4f28506dfa70dc7caa	Im sorry but both those names are just to old fashioned for me.|`|pLcUFBl2aa	Carolina?, because it's much prettier and unique. Also, Caroline is sort of plain.    Good Luck!|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I'm gonna have to go with Lilly. Most states used as names sound more natural but this one just makes me think of the state. I do like them both though.|`|xhVe918waa	Carolina.    But I'd say it differently in this case.    Regularly it would be pronounced Caro-line-uh, right?    Well I'd pronounce it this way:    Caro- leena.|`|3YZ8QF7waa	CAROLINE, 'CAUSE CAROLINA IS TOO MUCH LIKE THE STATE......................................|`|AA11105223	Caroline. Classic, cute and NOTa faddish name.|`|MjUentmjaa	CAROLINE|`|rWV2lRZpaa	my friend is named Carolina (care-o-leena not care-o-line-a) and shes Spanish.    I prefer Caroline|`|Hupx8wr0aa	my name is Caroline!    i like Caroline better because people always tell me i have a pretty name and sometimes old people sing Sweet Caroline to me, which is cute.    also, Carolina sounds like a state.  (but i do like the name Care-oh-lee-na, it's pretty also.)|`|v6nJaXZuaa	Caroline is one of my faves so I'd definitely stick with that one.    Hope I helped!! :)|`|U1juqahIaa	I like Caroline better.  Carolina sounds more like a place name to me.  Caroline looks and sounds classier.      Caroline could still go by Lina which I really love, or she could be called Cara, Coco (cute as a nickname, but not as a given name), or Callie.      Carolina isn't bad as long as it's pronounced Ca-ra-lee-na, but Ca-ro-line-ah is horrid.
AA11763588	It is possible for the baby to flip and get ready at 31 weeks. DR's say that it usually begins to occur at 33 weeks.    As for your second question it could be ligament pains, everything is getting stretched and this is your 2nd baby so you'll usually feel those pains a little more (because they have been stretched before)    Most women don't have a sex drive towards the end. If it's painful just refrain from it.    Hope it all works out!|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	I'm only 28 weeks pregnant with my first so I cant' answer the first 2 questions.  As for the sex, it hurts me alot now too!  How does it hurt exactly?  I feel like I'm so tight now it's like he's gonna tear me or something.  It takes like an hour of foreplay before I'll be able to have sex like normal.  Anyways, I feel like my belly is in the way so he has to come from behind which makes it seem even tighter if possible...  I dunno, I suggest mutual masturbation...
yrDqtazLaa	I don't think so, in fact, I was told by a reliable source that their doctor said coloring your hair while pregnant is not harmful. But, even if it is harmful, you are so early along that it will not do anything to the baby.|`|FEzmVmFjaa	no.  I am 37 weeks and I have dyed my hair like 5 times throughout my pregnancy. My baby is perfectly healthy.  Just make sure you try not to inhale the fumes, try and takes lots of deep, FRESH breaths!|`|5ieWhvYCaa	Lol, your life is now over.|`|DR2gal9Kaa	no but it you where smoking or drinking then. GOOD LUCK!|`|UaL28atDaa	Your baby will be fine, however beware that if you dye your hair anymore there is a chance it will not come out the colour you expect as a result of all the hormones. This video is really informative about hair care during pregnancy. Good Luck :)    http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...

But  me inperticular i would never name my child MAYBE.|`|FTqnjcriaa	definitely not!!!   If ever my child's name would be Maybe, it's like I'm giving her life a mess.. or her life would definitely be a mess.    Kids like teasing other kids if they found something strange about them..    Some kids tease other kids like "piggy", "oinky" or "coca cola can" if they are extremely fat..    Some kids tease others like, "skeleton warrior" or "kite" if they are thin!    Some would just laugh at you secretly... and so on and so forth...      I had so many friends that had these kinds of experiences, and i know how they felt..    Having Maybe as aname would just be one reason for other people to tease my kid... or it could be something that may bother my kid someday...      well this is just my opinion..  it's really up to you..  decide and love your decision!        goodluck! ^^|`|d3BZlRyhaa	No...|`|4fIE3Eb2aa	Maybe.|`|ApYYZoxoaa	no|`|Xsen794Aaa	If I had a child, I would definitely name him or her.  Definitely, not maybe.    If it's a girl, how about May-Bee?  Still, that's kind of cruel.  Children aren't dolls, and a sane person wouldn't even name a doll "Apple," Maybe or Evian.  That's messed up.  Actually, Evian might be kind of cool.|`|nZVmkZSBaa	Not really that bad spelled Maybie or something... L0l. Though, I much prefer Mae-Belle.

You also poop spaghetti noodles. Do you really think you could "pee" butterfly's? honestly? Please stay off yahoo!|`|B7zL81whaa	Completely true.|`|yOhGkcNjaa	no, i wasnt, but its common sence that you dont...|`|Q101YVPgaa	Thats so true, i heard the same thing.|`|VXuGqvLuaa	Yeah, and guess what else?! After the butterflys come out, they turn into caterpillars! Not vice versa! And you'll also have POd parents and a confused partner.    No scratch that, if you're under 13 and pregnant, and you believe this. Tell your boyfriend his girlfriend needs help.|`|LbNXxRXnaa	Yes. This has been scientifically proven.     Don't believe everyhing you here.|`|3bQaEVmTaa	cute *:~), but not true|`|105d8bb6a943a812def853bcae69c438aa	seriously no thats not true|`|ySKK7lCyaa	you can't pee butterfly's, wow you kids today are so gullible.     Maybe you miss understood her sometimes it feels like you have butterfly's in your tummy ( not latterly ) But that goes for anyone and you don't have to be pregnant to have the feeling.|`|d4b0db53e729c2238afeb4b26de95ff4aa	Oh Wow!

8ff1197fcf334cda2870e53b90edf1dbaa	Its a weird baby name
y5P4dY7aaa	Wow, good luck and you have a long long road ahead of you.  You need to tell them as soon as possible so you can get to a doctor and get taken care of.  They may be angry but no matter what your parents are gonna love you no matter what.|`|tu7aqUoxaa	GOOD LUCK TELLING THEM AND TAKING CARE OF THIS BABY|`|wVeaFp9Aaa	Get it over with, tell them both at the same time. Good luck to you. Hopefully they will be supportive, and you can get a doctors apt.|`|VMB15IQYaa	Alright. This is going to be extremely hard on you, your babys dad, and your parents. in the next nine months[if your keeping the baby] you are going to go through many changes, physically obviously and emotionaly. your parents need to know, they may be mad at first, but you need for them to understand that your sorry and that you are responsible. they LOVE you! they will forgive you, and trust you again, even if it takes time. Also you have many hormones, wich make you do crazy things; if you are thinking about abortion, be SURE that you are positive its what you want to do. I know people that have gotten abortions and the SECOND it is over, they regret it terribly. i dont know where you stand on abortion, but i am 100% against it. there is always adoption, and if you love this baby, you know that sometimes adoption is the best choice, because it gives the baby a chance to have everything it could ever want. But if your going to keep the baby, then that is great too. you need to tell your parents at the right time, and it is always better if you tell them. they will find out eventually. When i get into trouble, i tell my mom right when it happens if i think that it will affect me, or that i could be in serious danger or trouble. she always understands more, and trusts me when she knows i will tell her, and i think there is something she sees when i tell her right away; like that i know what i did was wrong. You need to be able to know that, and just remember; your parents will always LOVE you know matter WHAT.|`|3SIRKIBaaa	Well it can be tough, especially being so young but if I were you, I would just sit them down as an adult and explain the situation. Most likely you'll have their support. It'll be a lot easier on you to tell them, at least that way you have someone to lean on. Trust me, the first couple months of pregnancy can be tough. Try not to be afraid, it'll all work out for the best. Congratulations!|`|p9YrK5cMaa	I got pregnant when i was 17...  I knew it would have been better to tell them sooner then later...  you need to get them at the right time...  sit them down and tell them straight up...  it will be okay depending on how strict they are...  you life will change very much so...  what they will probably ask you is what about school   so be prepared with a reasonable answer...|`|sVxAM061aa	You need to tell them. Or if you can't, find someone else older than you who is responsible enough to give you sound advice. Try a pastor of a local church. If you need to talk to someone else you can email me. Please be careful to remember that you have a lot of hormones helping you to be extra confused. Don't make a decision too fast.  I am pregnant right now as well, I know the confusion that these hormones cause. Feel free to email me if there is anything that I can do to help you. conrads.mommy@yahoo.com   I will be praying for you.|`|zSABr7praa	DON'T WRITE A LETTER!  I knew two people in your situation who wrote letters, and it REALLY did not help the situation.  You need to show your parents right now, more than ever, that you can be responsible, and being responsible would be owning up to your actions face to face.  I suggest telling your mom first, she will help you tell your dad.  If you have sisters (brothers have a tendency to be just as protective as dads..even little brothers!) tell them too, so they can help support you.  Sit her down, and tell her.  Apologize for disappointing her, and remind her that everything happens for a reason.  Give her her time to be upset, it won't be as long as you think.   Best of luck!!|`|91ACjB5eaa	honey just try and calm down  i thought my life was over when i got pregnant at 17 2years ago.  i didn't want to tell my parents and my boyfriend was pushing me to get an Abortion that i didn't want, he Kept telling me he wasn't ready (even tho he was 19 and owned his own house!).  i hid my belly for 2 months. i cry-ed myself to sleep every night, then one night i woke up bleeding.  my doctor tolled me i lost it dew to stress  I didn't tell my boyfriend right away; he ended up wanting that baby and he got down on his knees and proposed to me. im married to him now.  i wish sooo bad now that i could have kept my cool, then id be holding my baby in my arms right now.  just stay calm tell your parents and make shure you see a doctor    it will all be ok, its not the end of your life and you will know that when you and your parents star down into the face of a blessing
X9JSlC6Iaa	I think you do drugs because you spelled doesn't wrong.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	That sounds typical.  Kids always have trouble with step-parents.|`|HXlsQ2LZaa	does the parent not let her go party or walk around town?  that might explain the "talk back" and if you are the parent  the "talk back" isnt its just answering you  like my parens ask something or say something and i answer them in the same exact voice i talk to my friends in, they say its talking back  if you are the teen then have fun.  im 15 also.|`|w1C5ThPRaa	if shes a good kid then juss give her space and dont always get in her face and she'll come around sooner or later
b7LI0jwXaa	I'm in the same situation.  You could try doing a test, but i'm not sure if it would show this early.   Unfortunately, for people like us, there's not really anything to do but wait it out :(       Best of luck!|`|C021mpLLaa	I think you're pregnant but go to the doctor to check.

yd8QWaSFaa	I would wait another 2 weeks.  Even if you are pregnant, the OB would use the 14th as the first date of your last period because that was the last bleeding regardless of how brief.  You will not test positive until the HCG levels are high enough and that will not happen until you are right at about to have or have missed a period.    Hang in there and wait another 2 weeks minimum. :)|`|Hhkk28U8aa	yea you might be  if u dont want 2 be dont have sex|`|1CgSVXxXaa	If you know you're irregular, the best thing to do would be talk to your doctor and have him/her schedule a blood test for you. That way you can find out if you're pregnant and if you are how far along you are. By the sounds of it you can be anywhere from 3-5 weeks pregnant.|`|gVlTlpb2aa	i would go see a doctor before asking on yahoo answers|`|f0356b2da1def71b56dea6c821b518d8aa	Yes you could be.    QUIT it with the unprotected sex!|`|O4JuH8zmaa	I'd say wait two to three weeks from that last time you had unprotected sex and you should get a pretty accurate answer whether you're irregular or not. Good luck!

AA11927140	If your last cycle began on the 18th, you should be able to test today!  I would buy one of those "early detection" tests, just because they are a bit more sensitive.  Good luck!|`|XzdY2HbGaa	There is a possibility you are pregnant and I would get a pregnancy test although they are unreliable or go to the doctor. But if it's only somewhat bloody when you only wipe it's probably just towards the end of your period.

He will respect you for that, and in return he will be that way with you =)    Good luck & lots of baby dust|`|7SKVCPcSaa	learn to spell first. and then just tell him you want to go ahead and start trying.|`|7jdvcrTKaa	Just tell him.  If he is really ready to be a father and you are REALLY ready to be a mother then he will be glad to know that you have pushed up the date.  Besides the best part of getting pregnant is the practice so tell him but only AFTER meditating on the decision BEFORE telling him.
tDaU7eYXaa	Wow! You have an awesome imagination. Don't see a psychologist. PLEASE. They just take your money and corrupt your mind. Try putting this great imagination of yours to good use. Write stories. Make your list of lies and put more detail. Maybe you'll be a great author some day. And if you lie, make yourself actually write that letter. Kep a journal. Then join maybe an acting class. It seems that you have so much great imagination and creativity and have nowhere to put it. MAKE it real. Draw pictures of your "memories". Put it in a book/ journal. And if you feel like your living a lie, it's not true. You are living YOUR life. Just.... enhanced? Man, I wish I had an imagination like yours.    But if you REALLY need to, you should see a doctor. They are very experienced... ok, ok, I lied. They are not just trying to take your money and corrupt your mind. They graduated college just to help people with problems. Ok... now try whatever you want!|`|RVeLHqe9aa	Yes for sure.  You need to see a doctor, being a pathological liar will hurt you and everybody else, and it will be very embarrassing.  Its good that you are seeing the wrong doing and you should consider the doctor.  Also, I am in the mental health field and In my experience I have noticed that sometimes a disorder like the one you have can lead to another one....then another..... then another....ya know. I hope you find the right path, good luck.... :)|`|nyylb6qUaa	You should probably see one, it sounds like you might be a compulsive liar. It is not your fault, you just have issues, and believe me, everyone in this world has issues. Please see someone. May God Bless You.|`|dzyJw0cvaa	Yes, you should see a professional.  You are a pathological liar and all you are going to do is hurt everyone around you and you will never be able to be in a happy relationship with ANYONE.  family, friends,or partners.      At least you see it and now you are wondering if you need help.  thats the first step.    My ex husband was a pathological liar.  i figured it out soon into our marriage and realized that he lied so often he bagn to believe his lies. he convinced himself he was telling the truth even though i knew it was a lie.  We are divorced now, needless to say.    But it will never get better without help. Good for you for reaching out. Now find a specialist and do what you need to do to get well!|`|yqCyTTPXaa	You should definitely see one and soon! People like you make life harder for the rest of us. I usually end up dating your type. If you ever want to have a happy and meaningful life like you deserve, you need to seek help. Otherwise you will just slowly destroy your life and everyone's around you. It seems to me like your lying is an insecurity issue. You make up lies to get attention from people. To either piss them off or to get them to show you affection, that they care about you. It may have stemmed from early childhood. Many attention seekers never got the attention they needed from their parents. But either way, you must get help to deal with the root of your issues. Honesty with others as well as yourself is the key to receiving the real love and affection that you are seeking.I also want to add, most liars don't realize how obvious most of their lies are. I dated this guy that made up stuff all the time and it was so obvious that they weren't true. He actually thought he seemed cool for his lies and "awesome" stories but in reality, he just looked like a fool.|`|xv2r0Gsdaa	yes you should see one. It will give you someone to talk to who can figure this out
reO9Dgmsaa	I'm glad you have decided not to get the MMR, as it's quite dangerous, and more so for genetically predisposed children.  As far as the other ones go, here are some links discussing the risks and their ingredients.  http://www.909shot.com/Diseases/mmr.htm  http://www.thinktwice.com/allvacs.htm  http://www.vaccination.inoz.com/ingredie...  http://www.vaccination.inoz.com/vacprote...  http://www.informedchoice.info/    This is your choice completely, and there is no harm in delaying shots while you research the issue.  :)   Good luck!|`|wlAmUQe3aa	Your nephew's doctor is a wally - there is no link between MMR & autism. Some children do develop autism later in life but it is a coincidence and even if they hadn't had the MMR, they would have developed the condition anyway.    The doctor responsible for the research that suggested there was a link has recently been shown as a fraud (he was being funded by a group that wanted him to find a link so it's not surprising that he did really - money was more important than facts).    What is more likely is that by not having the MMR you are putting your child and others he comes into contact with at risk. Each of the illnesses MMR protects against can be fatal.|`|AA11885437	If you are worried, but still want to protect your child from some serious diseases, you could ask about getting them split up and done separately instead of together. It is a bit more expensive, but worth it for piece of mind if you are concerned. Of course its your choice to vaccinate or not. I know it is a choice that comes with a lot of research and is not entered into lightly. We use a selective/delayed alternative schedule ourselves. Just wanted to let you know there was an "in between" option in case you didn't know already. Best of Luck.|`|g9U8ingcaa	Hi i had a friend who swore her son got it from the MMR, Boys are more likley too.    I have 3 son's and i paid to get all of there jabs done one at a time, I didnt trust the MMR, and im glad i did, why take the chance with the most important thing in the world!! your child.|`|hGNvbC6oaa	If you are so worried about it, why are you rushing to get it done at 12 months?  Why don't you hold off on it, it's your right as a parent, and do some research before blindly walking into the doctor's office and just doing it because they say.    And there are MANY other websites out there to check out.    The reason I say you are rushing, is because you are talking about getting them done tomorrow at 12 months.   There is no delay with that and just now asking about it.  The research done should take days to pour through.  Both sides.  THEN make your decision.  There's no reason medically, the MMR vaccine can't be spaced out over a long period of time.  And I'm talking up to 2 years.  And if you can't get it spaced out, then don't get it done.
EyKJ737daa	The quickest and most effective way to potty train is not to rush it.  Let her do it all in her own time.  The fact that she is telling you when she needs to wee is great as is actually getting a wee in the potty.  I have 3 girls and my hardest was my eldest who is now 5.  She took 14 months to train and drove us mad! My 2nd however took 8 weeks to train both 1 and 2's and she is now fully trained even at night and has been for about 3 months.  Take your daughter to the toilet every hour or so and get her to sit.  I know this sounds weird but I actually got a permanent marker and drew a couple of beetle pictures in the bottom of the potty and told me daughters to wee on them and they did, they loved it. My now 16 month old though is not yet ready and currently showing no signs of wanting to sit on the potty.  If your daughter can't go, don't make a fuss, just tell her, "ah well next time honey, we'll wee on the beetles then".  Make it fun for both of you and exciting when she does go to the potty. Always reward her with big hugs and kisses and lots of praise when she does go.  Over look accidents and tell her, "ah well sweetie, it was an accident. Next time we use the potty okay?"  Just don't be in a rush sweetie, she will get there when she's ready okay so don't worry.  Just enjoy watching her grow because before you know it, they are at school like my 5 year old is now!!  Good luck and all the very best.|`|m2aznd8xaa	my daughter is 20 months and fully potty trained.take her shopping for her own potty chair and undies and let her pick them. get books on potty training and movies too. once you start dont give up. if you want to use pull ups use them only at bed time and to go out,since they feel to much like a diaper.dont get upset if she has an accident let her know you know its tough and she is working hard at it.every hour sit her in her potty and let her know this is is where you go potty and when she is playing remind her every hour and ask her if she got to go. also its okay to not have to always have the potty in the washroom.its better to keep it close at all times until she gets the hang of it.they cant hold it as long as we can. with mine i had to let her watch cartoons when i sat her down that way she sat for a few extra minutes.and now she is a little pro . good luck  also buy lot of stickers my little one has them all over her potty for going potty like her big sister and mommy.|`|WtzKQVGXaa	I don't really think there is a quick way... it takes time have her go to the bathroom everytime you go and sit on her potty then she will get used to going to the bathroom when it is time... i have had 3 children 2 girls and 1 boy it took longer with my girls then it did my son but it just takes a lot of patience and working with her.... don't give up it will happen. Lots of Luck|`|iJPHtr0Jaa	Buy her underwear that brandishes her favorite cartoon character or band like the wiggles and she wont want to soil them.
SEzIkGNiaa	Rewarding for good behaviour usually works.  You could set up a chart with each of the children names, and put a star next to their name each day they are good.  And at the end of every month, you could give the child with the most stars could get a reward (toy, candy ect.)|`|KjF0p72naa	Maybe this is not the job for you. Or you can go online and find a forum or websight dedicated to helping children with disabilites. You'll find the most help from people who actually know about handling these moments day in and day out. It won't be something we can generally help with here.|`|cUCtK4zCaa	Read them a Book...

Get their attention in a creative, different way- use visual cues: a stop sign or go sign.|`|1j8mlvkkaa	I'm in a Behavior Modification class right now, and we were just discussing this actually. The best way to get a kid to do what you want, is not to use the word dont. The word don't is a challenge. Instead make it a positive instead of using the word dont, for example:    Please don't kick the seat --> Please keep your feet on the floor  Please don't scream --> Please use your inside voice  Don't hit your brother --> Please play nice with your brother or Please keep your hands to yourself.    Good luck!|`|xv2r0Gsdaa	sing songs that works for us in the car|`|dkJJFyrzaa	You said the crux of this whole problem: they're disabled! Depending on what's wrong with them independently, they don't have the faculties or the mentality to behave, let alone like a normal 4 to 6 year old.     Consistent lines need to be made as to what is and isn't permissible with as immediate of a response of "no." Don't try and reason with them... they're little kids, they'll walk a mile over you if you give them an inch.|`|Ki0uUdwOaa	I agree to try a reward system.  You get get thousands of stickers from Orientaltrading.com, and reward the kids each day with a sticker for behaving.      If singing works, try that, although make sure that this will not distract the driver of the bus...most importanly you want the kids to arrive home safely.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	Is it possible to do assigned seating? Put the kids who disrupt the most closest to you. Once you get to the school can you report the kids who misbehave to the principal?   I liked one poster who said to sing. Print out some eye spy or car bingo paper games.     This is the reason I think all school buses should have monitors who ride along. How they expect the driver to drive and babysit is beyond me. Get some parents to sign a petition and present it to the school board.|`|wvTI2XZSaa	bribe them with candy and give it to them as they get OFF the bus ;)

2DL4GMcgaa	You're probably pregnant but your not producing enough pregnancy hormone to get a positive result on your home tests. This has happened to me as well. I've gotten several negative home test results only to later find out I was pregnant. The home tests are not as strong as the ones issued in a doctors office. During the beginning you experience lots of cramps similar to your normal menstrual ones. You'll know what's up soon. Good luck with everything.|`|VFEjLgvuaa	just because they were negative doesnt mean youre not pregnant when I was prego with my first child none of the tests came up posotive I had to convince my doc to do an ultra sound to confirm it and I was 4 months and 17 days along when he finally did it so.... Do you have the symptoms? are your breasts sore and or swollen is your tummy tight and or swollen do  you have nausea and or vomiting cramping light headed or any other symptons? if so then you are propably pregnant I would have the doc do a blood test if it comes up negative then repeat it next month if you still havent had a period if it still comes up negative after that many missed cycles see if he will do an ultrasound because even if you arent prego something else could be wrong with you causing you to not have a cycle for a few months|`|Cjaphf0Iaa	ur doctor sucks get a new one...problem solved...good luck hun|`|MfIszBtZaa	Probably just some kind of sickness. You might want to keep checking though.|`|I2aoh7OMaa	ok first off you can go to your local heath department to get a pregnancy test done. You could be pregnant but not far enough to show on a pregnancy test yet. Make the appointment with your doctor and just see what the next few weeks bring.

96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	It depends on your body; right after getting off the pill you should concentrate on tracking your cycle and the different changes in your body to "get to know it" again. You will need to track your fertility signs, your period lenghts, averages, etc. in order to figure out when you start ovulating again and the periods of times when you may ovulate in the upcoming months. Some women can take a couple of months, others up to a year or more.    Potentially you can conceive any time you ovulate, but WHEN you will ovulate after getting off the pill is tricky, because your body will be out of whack for a while after taking the hormones away (aka 'the pill'). So try to relax, purchase a good OPK, start charting and lots of baby dust!!|`|vue9NOhYaa	It depends on your body.    Most women ovulate again within a few weeks of the last pill. So you could get pregnant within a few weeks.  Some women need a few months to start ovulating again. If that's you, you won't be able to get pregnant until you DO start ovulating.    (And it doesn't really matter how long you were on the pill. Most women become fertile again immediately, even if they've been on it for many years.  And some women need a few months to start ovulating, even if they were just on it for 6 months.)|`|7iMZ91K7aa	It really just depends on you. I was on the pill for 2 years, had irregular periods before getting on the pill. Then I got off about 9 months ago, and didnt have a period at all! I had to go to the doctor to be put on provera and clomid...|`|apUkTo3maa	I HAVE BEEN OFF THE IUD FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW AND WE TRIED FOR ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AND GAVE UP JUST SAID WHEN THE TIME COMES IT COMES. AND I STILL AM NOT PREGO. I WISH I WAS BUT NOT. I GUESS IT JUST DEPENDS ON YOUR BODY AND WHEN YOUR BODY IS READY. YOU KNOW AND WHEN GOD BLESSES YOU WITH THAT GIFT.|`|S1AuL4SOaa	I was on birth control pills and decided to go off of them and I must have been fertile immediately because I became pregnant with my daughter that month! I was really surprised because I thought it would take a while.    We are now trying for our second child. I went on the patch after my daughter was born and it must take longer to get fertile with the patch because it has been 3 months now. We are hoping this month is a lucky month! :)|`|XO4talxxaa	I just want to say i was on the pill for 7 years and as soon as i went off i went to my doctors and talked. He said as soon as you have your first natural period the pill is out of your system. It does not stay for 6 months! That is how some women get preggo on the pill! The doctor told me to start taking prenatal vitamins and just have fun! Usually women ovulate around cd 14 but that is not true for everyone! I ovulate early around cd 11-13. Are you going to take your temps or use opks? I am just tracking me CM! Good Luck and Baby Dust!|`|yB8djbeNaa	it depends on how long you were on the pill in the first place.... it could take up to 6 months before the pill effects wear off and you are able to conceive or it could be instantly

YESSSSS|`|8cLLhDrfaa	yes it can. and you know because when he has an erection it's the little bit of clear stuff that comes out of the tip of his penis. and it depends on the guy.|`|50245e5074843d3b781e05bd05ac05baaa	yes it absolutely can|`|bcd7737bcd35a4cdbfcc87efd6f62866aa	It's still ejaculate.  Regardless of if it's before he orgasms or not there is still sperm in it.  Get a test.|`|SKJb6eLKaa	YES. Precum can get you pregnant!    Don't listen to people saying "Ohhhh silly little teens.. Blah Blah" because that's what us teens who are more expirenced and adults are here for -- to teach you and make sure you know to use protection NO MATTER WHAT!    My boyfriend never knows if he "precums" .. So I'm not sure (he is the only sexual experience I've had..) but I do know that it does get you pregnant, and it varies from man to man how long they ejaculate and it isn't a specific time limit either.. one hour, 1 minute.. etc..|`|tu7aqUoxaa	YES YOU CAN, MY KIDS ARE LIVING PROOF OF THAT|`|MtOSX19Haa	YES, there can be seman in the precum.  No, it does it on its own.  Depends on the guy and how good it feels|`|tA8T4QYFaa	YES - YES - YES - she might be a mommy|`|uM962JSzaa	Yes it can happen at anytime during sex and though it's a small amount it still can contain live sperm, especially if he ejaculated recently beforehand. Use a condom and make him pee beforehand!|`|UiQ6V377aa	Precumm can get you pregnant. It has a higher count/equal of sperm than normal ejaculation.    Get educated before you have sex...well too late.    Tell your friend to do safe sex next time.|`|g9ZFjl6paa	yes pre c*m can get ur pregnant.    he doesnt know its happening|`|9IDDxwoaaa	Yes pre *** can get you pregnant because it is the *** before the actual ejaculation. A guy can precum the whole time he is having sex.  Good Luck|`|eMUSTCQfaa	Yes precum can get you pregnant.|`|6YJfHgksaa	if you dont know the answers to such basic questions about sex then you probably shouldnt be having sex at all. or at least use a condom..they are a little less expensive than a child is.|`|Ltb8K9YUaa	Yes yes yes it can happen!  And guys do not usually know if it comes out.|`|OuA2cQ8haa	hell yes !!!!!!!|`|NDsbqQWJaa	yes it can, and the time before ejaculate will vary.
K5TrkUhCaa	No, it will not lead to anything bad and will not cause any complications.|`|Qz3sii2caa	No it won't get in the way.|`|T8zPA3FJaa	it wont affect the baby coming out. the baby's head will part them.
pwu9xzF8aa	i didnt get my appetite back for a long time after my daughter was born.  I didnt eat anything at all for the first 5 days, i was just running of the adrenaline! It wasnt until about the 4month mark that i actually ate cuz i was hungry, not cuz i had to|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	I had the same problem unfortunately I can't say what to do to "fix" the matter as my appetite came back on it's own. You may want to speak with your Obstetrician|`|dPyfP0ijaa	Are you breastfeeding??    Your body is adjusting from some crazy sh**      You'll be fine. Just eat healthy, not so much sugar or sodas, coffee and crap.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	Amber's 5.5 months and I'm lucky if I eat once a day and I don't even feel hungry, I thought it was just me being weird but good to know I'm not the only one!|`|52bAHCaUaa	I'm with you. Except my daughter is 6 months old. I might eat once a day!     I think my problem is when I have a minute I do other things that need to be done, and eating is like last on my list. Which isn't good I know..
639b2178cbbecee8a881b09ae5058d5eaa	YES! Spank your kid!  I'm not advocating spanking that injures a child.  My daughter is almost 4 and rarely ever gets spanked because when she was younger and I spanked her when she was doing something she KNEW was wrong, I always made her understand why she got spanked.  She doesn't like being spanked and it keeps her from doing things she knows she shouldn't do.  Time out for kids that age doen't do much good.    **Always instruct before you punish!***  An example of this is: My daughter was laying on the cat.  I told her not to do that because she could hurt the cat.  She did it a second time and I reminded her she isn't to do that and she will get spanked the next time I see her doing it.  She gets caught laying on the cat again- she gets spanked.    **Always be consistent**  If you tell you kid they will get spanked for doing something, you must follow through- every time.  Then you must make sure they understand why they got spanked or it was useless to do so.  **The punishment must fit the crime** If my daughter is being picky about her food, she must wait until her next meal before she gets anything else- I do not spank her for this.  I reserve spankings for blatanly not doing what I told her to if I have to tell her more than twice, being mean to anyone or any animal, or braking a major rule such as messing with the computer.  **Never Spank out of anger!**  Spanking is a disciplinary tool.  If you abuse it- you start to create psychological problems (hitting too hard, being inconsistent about it, spanking too often, spanking  for minor infractions)|`|S2FhDtfSaa	The absolute only time you should ever swat a toddler on the bottom is when they do something that puts them in danger ! Running into the street, playing with the stove, etc. That's only because you should have already told them NO ! Otherwise, the most effective method to get you point across is toy removal. You just take the favorite toys away for a short time and give the child a "time out" Always take time to explain what they did wrong and what the punishment is. Be consistent. YOU are the parent, it is your obligation to properly instruct you children in acceptable behavior. They are a lot of work, be fair at all cost and set a good example in all aspects of your own actions. Make your mistakes, but learn from them.     Corporeal punishment isn't necessary except very rarely and if used in this manner, the kids actions are unlikely to repeat.|`|VFKn8Vqbaa	http://parenting.kaboose.com/behavior/sp...  read this article about it.  i recomend not doing it.  A simple time out or taking away priveledges is another method. i got both but i remmeber being terrified when being spanked. It teaches them that violence is okay, which is not something i want to teach my kids|`|3ay0KVVDaa	well I learned one thing with my 3 and that is that hitting NEVER works unless its like once every blue moon. Because hitting only leads to more and harder hitting and it teaches to hit too. I see what my sister does to her son and hes the BIGGEST jack AASS on earth and she beats and beats and he doesnt even make a face because he is immune. I LOVE nanny 911 and super nanny and I know it may seem boring but I watch them all teh time and they REALLY do help and do teach.|`|A5mkPwIqaa	I personally don't believe spanking is the best way to deal with a problem, but I don't think it ruins children's development. It just doesn't solve problems in a way children can benefit from. Sure, it dissuades them from doing that behavior again (although probably short-term), but they're not going to understand why and I don't think it strengthens your relationship with the child.    Instead of spanking, 2 year olds are old enough to start time-outs. If your child starts behaving in an inappropriate way, start with a verbal warning. Tell him/her firmly not to do that and why. (Ex. "Do not throw your toys. They will break or hurt someone.") Don't raise your voice, but be firm. If he/she continues that behavior, tell him/her that it's time for some alone time because he/she isn't playing with toys in a safe way (in the example). Set your child in a place away from toys and activity for 2 minutes. He/she will probably get up, but just keep putting him/her back in the same spot and explain that he/she needs to stay there because he/she wasn't playing with toys in a safe way. After your child has sat there for the full 2 minutes (continuously), give your child a hug and again explain that it's important not to throw toys so they don't break and everyone stays safe.    With the time-out method, the child is more likely to understand why you're punishing them and it's a more long-term solution.    Good luck!|`|rVsW4ESTaa	Well I have done it, even though I know it is wrong.  And for me, it doesn't work.  My daughter just gets more angry or uncontrollably upset.  It doesn't stop the behavior.  Time outs work much better.    I think hitting teaches violence (ok, I know I am a hypocrite here).  But if they see a parent lashing out in anger, what else can they take from it?    Take a deep breath - the terrible 2's don't last forever.  I think they should call it the terrible 3's.|`|VudhjHi2aa	Here is a Quot from a wise man who spanked his kids....    My Father....    I spanked my Three kids with a wooden paddle when they broke  the rule. Severity ranged from one smackers to a maximum of five smackers. I don't feel any regrets, because I never spanked them in anger, and the punishments were quick, followed by hugs. I have a question for people who think spanking is so bad.. What do you think is worse -- a few smacks on the bottom with a wooden paddle, or  verbal and psychological abuse?       I agree and I was the one on the other end of that paddle.    Spanking is ok if done with love, and a Hug, and explain what they did wrong.|`|wE5JMeesaa	I'm of the opinion that you should do what is right.  If you feel uncomfortable, then it's probably not for you.    For me, I feel like you cannot reason with a two year old.  Spankings produce immediate results.  It let's the child know the behaviour is not acceptable and needs to end immediately.      I was spanked as a child.  My parents were spanked.  My grand parents were spanked.  My great grand parents were spanked.  We are all normal, healthy, rational people.      Now, my Aunt Cindy wasn't spanked, and she's a total nutbag--if that's any indication of the effects of spankings.|`|eeRLckg5aa	I usually put my kids in time out...I find removing them from the situation works best. Although, I am not above spanking as long as it's used as discipline and not out of anger.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Spanking teaches nothing.|`|Jswomud7aa	Usually at 2 discipline is confusing and distressful for the child.    Redirect her attention from whatever the "bad" thing is that your child is doing. Pick him/her up and take her away from the problem area and get him/her to focus on something else.     I try to get my 2 year old to help me in some way, like picking up her toys and putting them in the toy box, or unloading the dishwasher (her favorite).     I know it's a lot of work at this age because they are so curious and getting into everything, but just take her from the situation you don't want him/her in. Always tell her that what he/she is doing is wrong and either correct it or take her out of the situation completely.    I find that redirection works a lot better and I've gotten much more positive results than from disciplining my daughter. Her attitude is better and she catches on to what I expect from her a lot more.     Good luck |`|mPTBU0QDaa	i think the best thing for a 2-year-old is to remove them from the behavior or take away what is causing the problem. however, in dangerous situations (like a child putting something in an electrical socket or playing with a knife) definitely calls for a good firm slap on the hand so that they never forget not to touch that thing again! i dont' think it should be used very often at that age, but definitely it is okay to use here and there.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	Do what you think is right....and legal.  Where I am, you can only spank a child on the bum or hand...and you can only use your open hand.    I havn't had to spank my daughter, other than a light tap on the hand...but it's different for everybody.
4vLt3SqFaa	Celebration of Life - prenatal massage and more    First Touch prenatal massage    Labor of Love - prenatal massage     Gentle Hands - prenatal massage and maternity center|`|9kPPmazoaa	Just a idea, don't know if you like it...

5de8ee8dcd420e5ed0003a1d8336e411aa	Congratulations! Now start preparing for your baby. Buy all the clothes you think the baby will need.   - Stay clear of alcohol  - Dont smoke  - Get enough sleep  - Eat healthy|`|Fr29Bteaaa	awww congrats!!! :)))  i had my baby 3 months ago ;)  found out in march, and my last pd was in feb, so he was born in nov.  uhm... hopefully yours is due sept, or october ;)  just uhm... let's c... lol  1-drink lots of liquids.  2-ZERO caffein.  3-if u dye ur hair, don't do it the 1st trimester.  4- sleep on your LEFT side.  5-enjoy!!!!   you'll miss that belly a little once your little one's born! lol    Congrats again! :D|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	without knowing how far along you are - there is no way to be able to tell when you conceived    walk! exercise at least 15 - 30 minutes|`|KOdLWJaQaa	First, make an appointment with you ob/gyn.  They will either tell you to continue taking the prenatals, or give you different ones to take.  They can also give you a better idea of exactly how far along you are.  Then, make sure you pick up a copy of "What to expect when your expecting" this book can answer many of your questions.  Congratulations!|`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	congratulations!!!!! Get a gynecologist now|`|bc07e210457d07686789bdd1b950122caa	Wow, when I was pregnant, there was no EPT.  Now you can tell in as little as 4 weeks?   Congrats. Enjoy pregnancy. Prayers for healthy baby and mom plus dad.|`|MwOMTHkKaa	I would say that you got pregnant right after your last cycle which would make u about 3- 4 weeks pregnant. The fact the you have already began taking prenatal pills is GREAT now just watch what you take in as far as caffine and things like that go. Also, you want to start buying maternity clothes, and pregnany pillows because you are going to need everything to make you feel comfortable. May I also suggest that you begin using Palmer's stretch mark cream in the early months up until you give birth it will help reduce your chances of getting stretch marks.  GOOD LUCK & CONGRATS|`|tpG1KBj4aa	omg congratulations!!!!! make sure you drink plenty of water, not alcohol. Dont pig out too.    congrats!!|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	Don't be afraid of anything. Enjoy having a baby while you can.|`|1fV8VZjLaa	now you poop out a baby  its simple!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA11689200	Go to the doctors and take a test..thats the best option...    and congratzx on the baby..|`|3AAtPzSaaa	well i suggest you speak to the doctor about this...they can tell by doing ultrasounds and things (they can even see your babys fingernails!)  my guess though is just after your period in early jan (i think your more likely to fall pregnant after your period as your fertile (new egg ect), incereased sex drive and its not possible u were pregnant before that other wise you would not have gotten your period.   do some yoga or pilates stuff ive heard thats meant to be good  also id suggest u use vitamine e oil or cocoa butter to prevent streatch marks on your stomach  GOOD LUCK!|`|hZuq2XT9aa	lol your title is shockingly amusing..    You say you do not know how far along you are,but you're expecting today?...wouldn't you have been like 39weeks-40 or maybe overdue...the last you would have remembered some pregnancy sympton's,also it would be hard to judge since your cycle's are irregular,but obviously from the first few line's i read i didn't know how to react...:) it just seem's like a hoax or you're just very confused right now....|`|Y8H2afL4aa	well im not really into the specifics but i do beleive you have a child when you are pregnant
JLoDcuUpaa	No I don't think your pregnant  This happens to me a lot, but i have never gotten the dark brown thing.  I usually bleed for 2 days stop for 1 day and then it finishes of in 1or2 days  Sometime you can get irregular routines and most of the time you get back on track but I would go and check or ask about the dark brown blood.   But it is probably nothing to worry about.    hope this helps a little|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	Tell adoctor before it gets worse.|`|AA11276156	Have  you taken a pregnancy test?|`|W70UXr42aa	nah your chill|`|cfdooGylaa	Take a test. If it says negative then seek further medical assistance. Good luck.|`|HNLskA4Aaa	nope. If you're pregnant, your mestrutional cycle, or w.e you call it would've completely stopped. Unless you had sex, you should consult with a docter. The docter knows best, y'know.|`|wrxs9Wblaa	i don't think you are pregnant - but you should just call the doc since this is different for you...how old are you?  sometimes fluctuating hormones when you are young can make your period do crazy things...Do you want to be pregnant?  I can't tell if you are an adult or a teen...don't panic, get a pregnancy test, call the gyno or reg doc and BE CAREFUL  If you want to be pregnant:  I don't think you ms, unless you are in pain...?    If you are not trying to get pregnant:  birth control is a WONDERFUL thing and it's widely available and inexpensive....use this as your sign to start using it.|`|RUFk8Vxeaa	Congrats! All this means is that you won'tbleed for an etire week.|`|WQjDQgB9aa	You should probably talk to your doctor.  It may be nothing, but you shouldn't take chances.
5f6XnInEaa	I'm sort of having the desire to have another baby, although am putting it off until we are more secure financially..much to my dismay.    All you really can do is talk to him.  If he doesn't want another child right now, he'd mind is probably not going to change for the time being.    To say it's breaking your heart is very extreme.  There is plenty of time to make a baby.    It sounds like you miss the nurturing of a newborn baby, so have you thought about a pet perhaps?  I know it in no way is the same, but as I said, if he doesn't want a baby, no amount of pleading will change it.|`|UqRNYDZ3aa	My husband and I miscarried several years ago and agreed on a time when we would try again.  When we got to that point, my husband no longer wanted to try - at all.  It was devastating for me.  It took a long time and heaps of patience I never thought I had, but eventually he came around.    Having a baby is always a choice that both parties have to be in agreement about.  If one isn't ready, then I believe it is best to wait.  My husband and I now have a beautiful 10mo. little boy and I am so happy and content with him.  I know I will want more one day, but for now, he's enough for me.      Showing your husband that you can be patient and work within the timing he's comfortable with will reaffirm that you are partners in this together.  He may also come around sooner than you expect.|`|0zrRBNXGaa	I think you should sit down and really discuss how you both real about another child he might be stresssed and you don't even kno it|`|oHO0XOQVaa	Just be happy you and him are still together. You really need to ask him why he doesn't want to have another child and tell him that this question has being weighing heavy on your mind. Don't let it turn into a big argument destroying your perfect life by telling him things like "why are you doing this to me" and "it's breaking my heart." You really don't want to sound like you're guilting him. Make it clear that you want to understand the reason for his decision above everything else.  Maybe he thinks it would overwhelm him.|`|cHbJxNmGaa	1.Tell what you typed here  2. yes it is tell him that.  3. not to my parents but to friends of mine  4. They just had a baby girl last year.|`|ROJans2Taa	I went through the same thing, I had my daughter young, then when she turned 6, I got this yearning for another, I felt like I needed a baby and we just shouldn't wait any longer, my husband wanted to wait, I cried and cried I didn't want to force him into it , I just wanted a baby, finally after a few months he said that he didn't want to "try" for a baby just if it happened it happens, finally I got pregnant and now my son is 5 mths, just give your husband some time, my whole thing was. im  not going to stay on the pill, if you wanna use protection you go ahead, but you know I want a baby, so Im not gonna try to stop it from it happening, he really might come around, best luck.
4DoXomHZaa	You would have no clue at this point. You would have absolutely no symptoms yet. It takes a week for a fertilized egg to journey to the uterus, implant, and begin producing the pregnancy hormone which gives you the symptoms.    You ovulate about 2 weeks before your next period. That's the only time you can get pregnant. The egg is only viable 24 hours and sperm can live at most 5 days inside a woman.    This is the information age, there are TONS of webistes with lots of great info on how reproduction works.    BTW pulling out DOES NOT WORK. It is as good as no method at all.|`|AA11763588	You would not have pregnancy symptoms one day later.|`|HNLskA4Aaa	i dont think ur pregnant. If so, you're due menstrual cycle would'nt be happening right now. I dont think you would bleed from not having sex in a long time. Unless you feel a sharp pain instead of cramps. If you feel cramps like you  would usually , then u may not be pregnant. But if you feel a sharp pain, consult a docter, or one of those genital docters.|`|oNXygeVZaa	I would say that you got your period.
fALkYOC1aa	if you had sex around the 16-19 then it would be to early for a pregnancy text to give you an accurate result.  it's pretty early to already be experiencing symptoms... but everyone's different.  just wait until your next period- if it doesn't come then take another pregnancy test. best wishes! :)|`|UxFJ4gcJaa	You're fine. Go see your doctor to see about the sickness.
cJfJd9yaaa	A D & C is "Dilation and Curette".  This is used when a fetus has died (miscarried) in the mothers cervix and cannot be passed naturally.  The cervix is opened and the contents removed to prevent infection.|`|UeDGiKSyaa	Are you drunk or mentally retarded|`|tj6MgJujaa	WHAT????????  i'm as lost as you are sweetie.|`|1SxVIZd7aa	its when they take all the leftover tissue from pregnancy out of your uterus. usually after a miscarriage.|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	D&C stands for dilation and curettage.

54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	The acid reflux could be causing the pains because I get them with heartburn at 34 weeks pregnant and the breathless is normal too because the baby is growing bigger and giving you and your lungs less room wait until it starts kicking your ribs really hard.|`|UeDGiKSyaa	all of that sounds normal  I am 13 weeks and I have to catch my breath all the time|`|IFqY2w1Paa	Acid reflux often causes pain in the chest. Feeling breathless is completely common during pregnancy, unfortunately. It is rather uncomfortable, isn't it? =) It happens to me all the time...and I first got it at the time you are at. Don't worry, everything is okay. Good luck and congrats on your little miracles! |`|A2wVXRHKaa	your body is moving your organ around so you cld have room for your twin..and yea you will feel pain|`|Bg6txvxqaa	I get this too, I started getting it around 14/15 weeks same as you. With twins, the pressure on your diaphram that you would normally experience later on with a singleton, comes around much earlier due to the increased size of the womb as it is trying to handle the growth of two babies.    This is my first pregnancy and also high risk as it's twins so I was anxious to find out about this. Apparently, another reason for it, is at this stage in the baby's development a hormone is produced which can make yoiu slightly breathless. Obviously, with twins, this is increased. Sometimes I feel like I can barely breathe and I on't have asthma nor anything like that. All you can do is sit up ad lean back a little so that your diaphram is stretched out to more or less full capacity (without straining the muscles in the stomach), or you could just sit up and put your arms above your head as you may do when having an asthma attack.     It passes after a while and somedays I don't experience it at all so I believe it may also have something to do with the babies positioning.
qN5iVvAFaa	it really depends on where you live... most of the time you can find a planned parent hood, or a pregnancy resource center... here is the number for the planned parent hood in beaverton, or (503) 646-8222. you can call them to get the number to a place in your town...|`|DauMaNUjaa	planned parenthood.|`|HXlsQ2LZaa	doctor  gyno   look for the pregnancy number for your town and talk to them

d1027f6834f2f2660c8aa9290737073eaa	Nope, men can get them too. And actually anyone can get hemorrhoids, especially if you're constipated and straining to have a bowel movement. Sounds as though you could benefit from water, fruits and veggies, exercise and fiber!    Good luck!|`|yrDqtazLaa	No, anyone can get hemorrhoids at any time, they aren't uncommon. Even men can get them, so that tells you right there you don't have to be pregnant to get hemorrhoids.    Try tucks pads (although they didn't help me at all), preparation H, and stool softener. I would also recommend letting hot water from the shower run over them, wash them thoroughly with dial soap, and then rinse thoroughly with hot water (that's all that helped me). That made them shrink very quickly.|`|p3d3E75oaa	ok stop pushing so hard when you go next time|`|lIpjuMTHaa	No, anyone could get them. And not all pregnant women get them anyway. Just some.|`|AA11006029	No not only pregnant people get hemorrhoids.  Men get 'em too so that answers that!  Actually yeah I know hemorrhoids are gross to talk about but I will admit I got them at 19 and I was not pregnant.|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	Are you serious? You saw the other question so now your asking this?      No pregnant women are not the only people who can get hemerroid. Everyone/Anyone can get them.
k0QRfQ00aa	Ok this is normal! Some guys are embarrassed about getting fertility testing done the thought of ejaculating in a cup causes them to be not so forthcoming on the sample. My husband wasn't reluctant but I thought he was going to be when I asked him. Some guys just aren't comfortable with the idea of it all. He would be in a room with a tv and adult novelties and is expected to handle his business in a doctor's office that would even make me nervous. Just give him some research on it and try to ease his mind about it. It is pretty hard to go further on finding out which one of you is having the problem if he isn't helping. I hope it works out for you good luck and tons of baby dust!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	He might see it as a tremendous possible blow to his manhood, if the tests should prove that it's something to do with him.     Try to understand his perspective and reassure him - but definitely talk to him first and find out why he is reluctant. At this stage in your relationship you should have everything out in the open and be honest; hiding things or nothing being truthful with each other is not a good way to begin life as possible parents. I've never had trouble conceiving, but I know that it can definitely take a lot of a couple, emotionally and psychologically.     Good luck.|`|sI0HbV68aa	try marriage first
PtqN5WM3aa	If you're old enough to have sex, you're old enough to have the sense to know how impregnation works and how to use birth control.  You seem to be neither.    I suggest you get a pregnancy test done and, if you are lucky and NOT pregnant, go ask at a family planning clinic and ask them to teach you basic reproductive biology.    A dick does't need to be in "that long". Precum contains sperm. Active semen contains sperm. If the guy ejaculates on his hand then touches your vagina, there is active sperm there.    For gods sake get some knowledge, advice and sense. If you have any kind of sexual activity with a guy who has precum or ejaculatory fluid any where near your vagina, you can and will get pregnant.|`|xOvPuyfHaa	I'm so worried for you kids, I'm telling you, being 13 and pregnant is something you do NOT want to go through, I'm not judging you one bit, I'm 15 years old and I'm 14 weeks pregnant, and I have made so many mistakes and I hate to see when a 13 year old posts these things. The only thing you can honestly really do is take a pregnancy test. Hope it is negative, this is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life and I really want to tell every girl on here thinking they are pregnant to really stop, having sex is fun, but it really does bring hard consicunses.|`|Ela3o96Raa	Your 13?? Oh my...    Buy a pregnancy test. How are we all going to know if your pregnant or not just by what your explaining. Boobsache headaches? I dont even know what you mean - your boobs have a headache?

7e45ea9e2cad770cb7a1dd48907df0a9aa	It probably means. The baby is getting in position to be delivered.  >|`|3VfviVGSaa	To drop means when you are close to your due date the baby "drops" into position to get ready for the birthing process.  Throughout your pregnacy your stomach is pretty high, when the baby changes postion it drops down to get ready to move into the birth canal so its ready for delivery.|`|H72YQiTMaa	I think it means hass ur vagina odropped.

lG1j8t2Aaa	My daughter had her adenoids removed over a year age and my son had tubes in his ears last week. My daughter also complained when ever she moved her neck after the surgery. I took her to several doctors and get no response. Finally I took her to a specialist and was told that it was due to the aggervating of the muscles in the nose and the way that they had her head layed that caused the problem. It went away with a little bit of neck rotating exercises in about 7-10 days. Good luck.|`|PW3hcVZiaa	If I were you, I would follow your instincts that something is wrong and get another (and another) opinion.  I couldn't imagine seeing my child in pain and a doctor not giving me a reason why or how to help it.  Use your mommy intuition and get some answers.  I hope she feels better!|`|zXCFGPhOaa	Oh my, i am so sorry! That must be terrible!  I would get a few more opinions, i would most definently figure out why she is saying this and why nothing is coming up wrong?! Don't just stop because they say its nothing, it could be and that wouldn't be good!|`|VHHis05Naa	How scary!  I'm so sorry she's having to endure such pain.  :(  I hope you can figure it out very soon.  Keep taking her to the doctor until someone figures it out and does something!  I can't imagine how awful it must feel to see your daughter in such pain and not being able to do anything about it.  Poor sweetheart!|`|FvhCUHjxaa	I've been on Zithromax but I've never had that happen; I'd just get fatigued easily and stuff. What about if her sinus' are blocked? I have major ear problems too and I'm supposed to get tubes in my ears for adults and the sinus pressure is so unbearable sometimes that I will feel miserable like your daughter. Maybe it was a really bad infection. Does she have a stuffy nose or does she have facial pain? I'd go see a specialist as most ER doctors are doc in the boxes if you know what I mean.|`|tDaU7eYXaa	Don't even worry. Remember, these doctors in the ER and the one giving her surgery have went through college. The have doctorates for God's sake. It's fine. Is she vomiting or having diarhea? If this is happening, don't worry. It is a common side effect.  Maybe your kid is just overreacting. Maybe she wants attention. Just wait and watch and keep an eye on her. No matter what you think, the doctor is ALWAYS right. My doctor's always right. It may be a side effect. Maybe she's allergic to something? If something happens though, sue the doctors!|`|8g7xed5gaa	My 4-year-old son had surgery 2 years ago.  It is so difficult to watch your child go through the recovery, almost as much as during the actual surgery.  The first words out of my son's mouth when he woke up were, "Mommy, they hurt me."  It was the worst moment of my life.  Anyhow, do you think perhaps some of your daughters symptoms are just her fears or memories of the surgery, even sedated, coming back to her.  3-year-olds have a difficult time expressing themselves, so maybe this is your daughter's way of telling you what she remembers from the surgery and in the recovery room.  I really hope she is better very, very soon.|`|cUCtK4zCaa	I'm so sorry for you're Little one my Son had tubes at 27 Months old and the day of he freaked out so they gave him what they call pre happy meds that made him almost look / feel drunk so that part went smooth. But when they came out with him he was so upset adn crying he cried for 3 hours till he passed out for 6 but woke on and off to get sick or just cry.. after this it was a lot better he was still fussy a lot and wanted to stay on my lap the hole day.. But before tubes he had always had ear infections on top of ear infections and so with the tubes he had clear ears he could also hear so much better to every thing around him.. New sounds made him more scared till he got used to them..      good Luck   Tonya
GYoNyoWtaa	She could if she isn't on any birth control method. But it's high unlikely for her to get pregnant that way. Expecially since you metioned that you cleaned up afterwards.|`|xOvPuyfHaa	If it went into the vagina, yes.|`|961dff0c7dd0bad1d20bcd8a9221b6ecaa	well it might be  or might not be all i can tell you is that u will think next time before you have sex with her or anybody so good luck|`|MqFeJiukaa	It is possible yes but I think its highly unlikely.  I wish you the best of luck!|`|ab2f66e8a13e1ac5cc285faefb061f12aa	All it takes is one strong swimmer,so yes there is a possibility. In the future double up on your protection use a spermicidal foam or film in addition to the condom. First time is no excuse for false hope, any small amount of sperm can get the job done. She is most likely OK but if she is "late" b sure to get her to a clinic for a blood test it is more accurate and the 2 of you can decide what to do next. If she isn't pregnant thank your lucky stars and use double protection even if she is on the pill there is a 1-2% chance of pregnancy with perfect dosing. Get in the habit of using 2 forms of protection to prevent these sweat sessions. Good Luck!|`|AA11785285	Don't they teach you guys any sex ed in school?   OMG, the Republicans made sure you never learned to protect her????????  8 years of those people.......Now we get to again teach sex ed to kids like you.    Sure, she can very well be pregnant... sex = babies.      It takes one swimmer.      Sperm live up to 4 hours outside the vagina, 10 days in the vagina.  One egg lives up to 5 and women often ovulate 2 or three times in one cycle, even during bleeding.  She can aget pregnant even during menstruation!!!!!    Are you getting the message???? we are forever fertile.    And did no one tell you two that bc pills are FREE at Planned Parenthood, and they don't even call your parents.... The Bush Administration hid that from you as well.    Google Planned Parenthood + your city and all the numbers are there.      If her period comes in 2 weeks, she could still be pregnant.  Many of us bleed up thru month 7.      A test two weeks later will show if she has enough hormones to test positive on a urine test.   There is no such thing as a false positive.  If it says sheps preggo, she in indeed preggo..    Cost about $15 at any drug store.  If this unprotected sex happened less than 72 hours ago, if she has a friend over 18,  that girl friend can buy her Plan B at any drug store.  Cost, about $35.  follow directions.  It comes with two pills.      If the test is positive a month from now, and she is pregnant, the abortion pill is by script only, at planned parenthood the cost is approx $350., as is a normal vacuum abortion.    print this all out hon.  ANd keep it.    You have ever single right to be scared, and angry.  Scared that you got your sweetie preggo, and angry that you did not learn in public school how to protect the two of you.

i69nprxXaa	If they tested for it then it will show.. Good luck to you...|`|VZaqk5CYaa	No they would have to have an order put in to know to check it. when it goes to a lab if they are not checking for other girl related things, they might not know if your bloos was even from a girl. :)    you have to ask for one specifically.|`|qHykYLQ6aa	They'd only see it if they were specifically testing for it, and they normally don't do that unless you're going to have a procedure done or take prescription meds.|`|0i8XxXG9aa	I'm not positive, but i'd assume it wouldn't. Usually when they send it off they test for specific things. I guess it would depend on what they were testing for.    I had a sample once and then had to keep going back for repeats to test for all sorts, so i know it doesn't cover everything!      -if you think you are pregnant, go back and check just to be sure :)

puCOYwMmaa	Talk to her.  The last thing she needs is to worry about you passing out during the birth.  Maybe you can come up with a signal if you feel dizzy or at the very least she'll understand why you've suddenly run out of the room!    Also, talk to her doc/midwife about it.

41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	You could be in early labor or you could just have diarrhea.  It happens.  As long as you are not spotting or having contractions, then relax and mention it to your doctor tomorrow.|`|SKJb6eLKaa	I was 34 weeks along when I got cramping, and Diarrhea.. and I started having contractions.. I thought they were just Braxton Hicks but nope, at 35 I was admitted into the hospital due to early labour.. My baby was too tiny and the lungs were underdeveloped so they kept me in for 2 weeks until the baby was a healthy weight, and the lungs were almost 95-100% .. We named him Anton James :)    Go to the hospital, they should be able to tell you what is going on! Believe me, hospital food is gross when you eat it for 2 wks, go get checked out!|`|198a20dc746be07d1a84a32346a3eab9aa	Anything is possible. The most important thing is to stay calm. Keep track of your cramping. If the cramps are regular, get closer together and last longer, that could be labor. If the cramps have no pattern, are better after you have a bowel movement, or lessen if you walk around or go to the bathroom, then they are probably from your diarrhea.    Best of luck to you.
4AO2myzKaa	It is very possible that you got pregnant right away afterwards.  I know someone that it happened to.  They are retesting to make sure the  s are going up to confirm that it's a new baby and not just hormones left from the previous baby.  Good luck!|`|BwGadO62aa	i think you might be pregnant again because usually the levels arnt that high after miscarriaging 5 weeks ago.
1E3MzC3Baa	Yes. Anytime you have unprotected sex you can get pregnant. Get a home pregnancy test if you are worried.|`|8V39PymEaa	yes you can it had contact with your vagina (the sperm) so take a blood test to see if you are or not|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Well, if he came all over your vagina, then there is a SMALL chance.

0Zfh77Vpaa	I had an induced MC at 15 weeks back in oct.  i had a period exactly 28 days later.  When I went for my genetic counselling 8 wks later (our baby had Turners Syndrome) I was preg again.  I was completely gobsmacked and didn't know how to react.  At the appointment with the consultant (he is one of the top dogs at our maternity hosp!) he told me that you are most fertile for the first 3 months after either giving birth full term or having an MC.  He also said the only reason some people are told to wait 3 months is so that they can give  more exact date of last menstrual cycle, thus give a clear due date without having to use NHS money and have an early scan.  He said from the moment you ovulate after having  an MC, your body is ready to do it again or you would not release an egg.  Of course it is entirely up to the individual tho when they choose emotionally to be ready.  I was really mixed up when we were told I was preg again then I felt guilty for feeling like that cos we were getting another chance.  I'm 12 weeks today and happy as can be.  I am sorry for your loss, it can be very difficult and lonely (even tho you have your partner) but when you feel ready, go for it, and if that means starting straight away then good for you......good luck....hope I've helped xxx|`|4d8yOK3iaa	I had a D & C done after a mc at 16wks. I was told to wait three weeks before having sex, after my doctor checked my cervix after three weeks to make sure it had closed back up. You can get an infection if its not healed and closed all the way. And he also told me to wait 2 normal menstrual cycles before getting pregnant again. He said this would give my body time to heal. ANd I listened to him and haven't had any complications. Im also 38wks pregnant today and hoping to go into labor soon. So, I would listen to the first doctor on waiting. Your body has been through a lot and needs time to adjust back to normal before getting pregnant again. Im sorry to hear about your loss, I know how painful it is. I still think about mine all the time. But you'll be pregnant again before you know it, and you'll just appreciate it that much more. Good luck and lots of baby dust to you.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	My doc said to wait 6-8 weeks when I had my D&C in order for my hormones to return to normal|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	You should follow what your family doctor said. If you pregnant before the 3 month mark you are at higher risk of another miscarriage.|`|yd8QWaSFaa	I just went through this.  We lost our baby at 16 weeks and had a DNC on Friday.  I was repeatedly told not to have sex or use tampons or put anything inside for 2 weeks.  This is my first DNC, but second miscarriage in 6 months.  Last time the loss was natural and at just 6 weeks.  Then I was told to wait for 2 cycles because you wanted to make sure all of the tissue had gone from the uterus before something would be growing there.  With the DNC they remove all the tissue, so it may be less of a wait, but I would still think it would be advised to wait atleast one cycle if not two.
OLW0Irbhaa	You don't want to soak. It's very hard on the fibers and will wear the diapers out faster.  When you change the baby put them in a dry pail (shaking big solids into the toilet-no dunking-but breastfed baby poo washes right out).  I wash every other night.  I run a cold wash/rinse, then a hot wash with small amount of an cloth diaper approved detergent then cold rinse and then another short hot wash (no detergent)/rinse.  Then toss in the dryer.
AA11503678	I am not sure if it is autism but I am sure you are a caring mother, health be with you all.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Sounds like the "bear crawl"!  Some kids just crawl like this, doesn't mean it's autism.  But if your really worried talk to your doctor, but I wouldn't worry, sounds normal!|`|YuVSDBkzaa	So he started crawling and now he's starting to walk, and you think that's a sign of autism? I would say he's perfectly normal. I child who is autistic has a hard time with making eye contact and understanding things. I have a friend with three boys, the eldest is high functioning autistic. For the longest time they thought all three boys were autistic but the younger two were misdiagnosed. I think this happens to many children.|`|r52rfBkeaa	My son did the same thing when he learned to crawl.  It looked like he was doing some army-man type of thing.  He didn't do it all the time, but only when it suited him instead of being on his knees.    I understand you worrying about autism, but I don't think you should give it too much thought just yet.  Babies develop at different rates and do things at their own pace, and their own way.  You mention he's a happy baby... did you know that smiling back at you when you smile is a sign that he probably doesn't have autism?  :)    My kid ignores me too sometimes - it's their job to drive us nuts!|`|HfBLQ4sQaa	I wouldn't be to concerned, he's only 9 months old, he's already crawling that's a good sign!  Most "Autisic" babies don't crawl for a while and don't talk until they get therapy.  If he doesnt start talking than I would be a little more concerned. He also recognizes his name so thats really good!|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Huh, I never heard that.  I have two sons with an autistic spectrum disorder, they did not crawl like that.  My 3 yr old son was dx at 9 months old, he didn't clap, he didn't respond to his name, avoided eyecontact, he would play with a piece of lint for hours, he would repetitively put toys in a bucket and remove them over and over and over again.    Here is a site that assesses autistic symptoms  http://www.childbrain.com/pddassess.html|`|o2YHnKXiaa	I wouldn't worry about it to much they really can't test for autism until your son turns a year old, I think to me it sounds like your baby is normal as can be.|`|Q40ekcUxaa	maybe you should take him to the doctors.|`|KtCE991Vaa	I don't think i would worry about it till he is over a year old....My son is 9 1/2 months and he crawls the same way.. I also have an 8 yr old autism child that did everything like...talk, walk,crawl,,etc... Till he was about 16 monthes old and he all of the sudden stopped talkin and quit associateing with us...I have to do research on Autism everyday just to cope....Research has taught me that autism USUALLY doesn't show till after a year.. just research on signs...i bet he will be fine....
5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Have you been to see a counselor?|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	It sounds like you need to seek the help of a counselor.  They help you to move through the grieving process of both occurrences in your life.    Good luck!|`|cj7sSPZEaa	It is not something that you will ever get over.  It was a hard thing that you experienced, and there are things that might be able to help, but nothing will ever make the pain go completely away.  Try joining a support group, or seeing a therapist.  You will have good days where the thought won't cross your mind, and you will have bad days where it is all you can think about.  You have to take those days one at a time.  Try doing something to get your mind on other things.  Maybe try going for a walk or doing a crossword puzzle.  Try hanging out with friends or family.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Your story confuses me.  You need to see a councilor.|`|5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	What's done is done. You need to see a counselor to work through your guilt and grief.  Even when we do things that aren't right, we still need to learn how to love ourselves again.  Forgive yourself and don't encourage others to make the same mistake.|`|m7lga8jOaa	I also think you need to see a councillor.  Personally though, it might seem harsh, but you need to realise that whats done is done and move on or you will never find future happiness.  I hope you find the help you need.|`|xeS8pUfbaa	you should share your story with women who are considering abortion. how far along were you?|`|giRRCXU4aa	As far as getting over a miscarriage, just take it one day at a time. It was something you couldn't control. Things happen and sometimes we don't know why. Just focus on what's to come. You'll never get over abortion either, but that was your choice. I'm not meaning to sound rude but I don't know how anyone can kill their child.|`|PZv52KrNaa	you need counselling and to give yourself time.|`|O4JuH8zmaa	I'm sorry your decision has haunted you. This is the main reason I am against abortion. Many women are never the same. You need to talk about it. There are support groups and therapists for this. It may take a little while to find a place you are most comfortable with but you will and you will be better for it. Good luck.|`|LClV32Vvaa	You will never forget the image of what happened that day. You will remember for the rest of your life and you will regret it for the rest of your life. But now to move on you should forgive yourself and realize everybody does something in their life that they regret, but we learn from our mistakes. And we tell our experiences to try to get other people not to make the same mistakes that we have made. Really that is the only way of  getting over it.|`|tvF86mRDaa	Hi,  I have been in a similar situation and I know its horrible thing to have to go through. I think you need to make peace with your decision, you cant change it so letting it control your life isn't healthy. See an abortion counsellor can help, so can the knowledge that when you finally have children, you'll be a fantastic mother and it's the right time to have kids. And when you say "i know the abortion is my fault", I find that really sad because it is NOT any easy decision and no-one ever knows what that feels like until they have to make the decision. Dont beat yourself up over it, try to look forward and know you will have children one day when the time is right and your body is ready for it. Try this website which will give you some ideas on counsellors.  Good luck.x    www.careconfidential.com|`|aL4UoRdTaa	Grief is an interesting monster.  It takes so long to deal with.  I've lost a baby myself.  Not through abortion but a miscarriage and a loss after giving birth due to a medical condition.  I really found it helped to find ways to honor my children.  Like set up an alter in your home. If you can find ways to honor your children your grief will progress.    If you want more information or if you want more support or want to talk more you can visit this message board I set up for women who have had a pregnancy or infant loss.

JUST TAKE A TEST|`|rR5nIklWaa	oaky am 18 and pregnat i no how you feel  if you were on birth control but not getting a period  are u sure you werent pregnat already ?  you should have gone to ur doctor when u 1st didnt get  ur pd.   but now u should really go to ur doc  cuz  what if u are pregnat and ur not  getting the right prenata car or  if u want to abort   i would never i dont belive in it but if u did  u would want to do it as early as possible   u should talk to ur doctor and take  a test   just to be sure|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	I dont think so, but if so at least you took responsibility and at least you aren't one of those 14 or younger girls who 'thinks' they are pregnant!    hope i helped =p
em8A42Bqaa	So he can cool off (his hormones)|`|vKEYa8aeaa	she was telling him to cool down, like he was getting "hot" as in sexual/romantic. that he needed to "wake up" and calm down.|`|NDQS5HJyaa	Cold water tends to shrivel up... the parts down there, on boys, if that makes sense. Although I don't quite understand how that plays into the conversation you overheard, maybe a bit inappropriate.|`|bQk0vpfSaa	cold water will make him shrink. if he had a ***** then it would go away with cold water|`|QR6IHIZxaa	make the ***** go aways.|`|A2XYCdOYaa	Lol it means the boy was getting aroused by the teacher and take a cold shower generally means to stop a erection....
l0R7BiJkaa	They all sound really complex and scientific. I understand you're going for something cool and new, but those names are pushing it.  Emma is a beautiful name, but Mycelex? Ehh, sounds like an antacid.    -Victoria  -Callixte  -Callista  -Rubia  -Andromeda  -Zepehenia (or Zephenya)  -Cecile  -Aphrodite (kinda mock-worthy, but...)    babynames.com is great, too :]|`|Z6NlNRLoaa	ewww.|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	wow really? what does your wife think?|`|mJm6VuwGaa	Most of the names you've listed seem a little out there.  I do like Samson, or Emma.  Mycelex sounds like a prescription drug name and so does Omeprazole.  I just see your child being made fun of so be careful on what you choose.    Good luck to you!!|`|Qd0sFMdHaa	how about Shabazz Delongone Jones for a boy    and Cutess Cucheever Kissit for a girl

And don't be all about UNEEK spellings. They're dumb. They say the same thing no matter how you spell it. Don't cheapen it.

rcdTluUjaa	Sounds like she just isn't ready yet. Both my son and my daughter absolutely refused to take a bottle, EVER. My son also refused to eat anything until he was 14 months old. My doctor told me to just offer it and not stress and that he would eat when he was ready, he was still active and healthy in every way so it wasn't a problem. The only thing that worked for us when I had to be away was to give pumped breastmilk out of a regular cup, not a sippy cup. It made meal times last longer and they were messier, but it was the only way to get them to take anything and avoid the all out screaming that came from being away from the breast. A doctor once told me that when they got hungry enough they would take a bottle. I guess it depends on the kid but mine were able to hold out over 48 hours (I had surgery and was completely unable to nurse) and I have to say it was probably the longest 48 hours of our life. Some kids just won't take them. You might try giving her juice in her bottle right now just to see if maybe the flavor gets her interested enough to try it. Good luck|`|74pfB2Bnaa	Maybe you could try giving her soft finger foods to play around with at mealtimes? Playing around with it might lead to eating it.|`|apUkTo3maa	THATS ODD MAYEB YOU SHOULD TRY REGULAR FOOS. CANNED FRUIT. REAL FRUIT. SOFT FOODS. MY SON HATED GERBER BABY FOOD HE ONLY LIKE THE REAL FOOD AND THE DOCTOR SAID IT WAS PERFECTLY FINE FOR HIM TO EAT REGULAR FOODS.
7CoVXfA1aa	Hi there,  my son is the same age as yours, is about the same height and weighs 9.5kg. I have been told that he is healthy. I think as long as your son is happy and developing normally then he should be healthy. You don't want a fat baby - it may be that he's just very active so burns a lot of energy. If he's not complaining of being hungry then I'd believe your Dr and keep doing what you're doing, sounds like you're feeding him well :-)  Oh just converted kg to lbs and my son's about 21lb.    My son's daily food intake is usually something like:    Breastfeed upon waking  Muesli and milk for breakfast at Daycare  Marmite sandwich, banana, raisins, yoghurt and biscuit for morning snack/lunch/afternoon snack at Daycare (sometimes he eats it all, sometimes not)  Dinner = whatever we have. Doesn't always eat much, if worried about it will give him some peaches or the like for dessert.  Breastfeed just before bed    Don't stress you sound like you have a happy healthy boy - he'll tell you if he's not getting enough to eat|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I've had experience with an underweight child - my daughter.  It was a very arduous experience.  If your son has continued to gain weight on a the curve and it has been semi consistent for him, I would not worry.  The range of normal is vast.  In my experience worrying begins when the child - a) doesn't gain weight between appointments or b) falls off the curve that doctors use.  if those things are fine, I would not worry.  Especially, since the doctor is not worried.  If you are still concerned, by all means, reiterate your concerns with the doctor and tell him about the ribs.  see what the doc says.  keep in mind you are seeing them when he stretches.  you could see mine when i stretch too.  but the best thing to do is have another talk with the doc to address your concerns.  you should feel better.  if you don't trust the doctor after that conversation, then seek a second opinion.  my opinion, based strictly on what is here - hes fine.  i wouldn't worry about trying to make him gain weight.  good luck!
r5OJyawnaa	They say 6 to 8 weeks, but I did after 2 weeks|`|BJERgbM5aa	As soon as possible.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	For the 1st 2 wks, no matter if you want to get out or not you need to be in bed resting. After that maybe a quick walk and stretch would be okay but you really shouldn't get into any heavy work for 6 wks.|`|01vMpHkWaa	after 6-8 weeks is what books and doctors told me|`|7xit1ogxaa	You can start working out after 6 weeks. If you start before then you may wind up overdoing it and it could cause you to start bleeding heavily.

What do they get by staring at a girl? I think it's because they're "admiring" their body in a "decent" way. Or they probally have staring problems.|`|EpOU7vGYaa	guys stare at girls cause guys have a real crush on those girls |`|bSkYYRrEaa	Because they see something they like: ***, boobs, or something else, and they're horny as hell.|`|v05RzzCEaa	aha im wondering the same thing!  i think they are just admiring the girl, but are too afraid to approach them.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	They like what they see,curiosity,staring problems...|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	Maybe the girl has a nice rack or shes just drop dead gorgeous.|`|xZvzLztZaa	Raging hormones haha.

It's really not good to lay and mope all day. I think you would be better off at school with your friends.|`|W7TLmkrNaa	I know that feeling, i did it thursday.  It helped me a lot.  I just sat at home and cried.  But, being with friends might also help!   good luck!|`|rIFqv8nvaa	No, life is hard. Its just another thing you must deal with.

It may not seem like it, but trust me.|`|0770fd55f95f18aa245026f830c7ded7aa	PLZ, go to school.|`|WtzKQVGXaa	i'm sorry but no that is not a good reason not to go to school..... I don't know all the details but if you got your heartbroken over a girlfriend/ boyfriend then your heart will heal and staying home being depressed is not gonna help anything you need to get back out there and spend time with your friends it will make you feel better... however if the reason is other than that... it may be a different story|`|kC37dRRIaa	Yes, I've done that many times. Lol. I have bipolar disorder though so I just get that way.  It helps though. When I go to school in that condition it just makes it worse. Staying at home on Yahoo Answers actually helps me :)|`|ccU5FNsmaa	i say you get your best outfit together, go to school and make whoever broke your heart regret it, thats what i did and i got my guy back and we are happier than ever!
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Most of the time, no. It's a fantasy. At young ages, we're only use to movies and tv shows. It shows a couple have one fight and then it's happy ending from there. It's crap. I had my first serious relationship at 15. Six years later, we're still together. It's hard though. We're going through a rough patch right now. Back as teenagers, it's a fantasy dream. A relationship isn't just about love, it's about everything. You're sharing a life together, and there is a lot to it. ??|`|uuceuyRyaa	I've been in love since I was 15 :)    I'm now 17 and still with the same guy. :)    He was18    now 20.|`|r39EDGhPaa	I think that you can meet your love when you're young, but you don't fall in love right away.    Say you start dating someone when you're 14, and when you're 20 you're still together and just as crazy about each other.  Then I would say yes, you can find love very young.|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	I do believe teens can find love but i think anything under the age of 13 is just a crush, I think 14+ are able to find someone they truly love, but as they get older there love for someone else will become stronger, Do i think that you can find the person your going to spend the rest of your life with at 15? Maybe, if your insanely in love with the person then yes, if not no, your eventually going to become an adult meat other people and find someone better fit your you/|`|r07BwhO1aa	I think you can meet your love when you are young BUT with that being said there are different levels of love.|`|v05RzzCEaa	Yes, i believe young love is real.  because my aunt and uncle first met in high school and have been married for over 25 years =]  i dont think it matters what age you are.|`|kC37dRRIaa	Yes, I believe so.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Some people do but it's very uncommon. When you're a teenager you're trying to figure out who you are and you change a lot from year to year. Sometimes you just fall out of love with someone or you move on. Most people end up with partners they met in their 20s and 30s.|`|AmqQ9it5aa	Sometimes,but it's rare and one in a million. I think that during the early years change is seasonal and we are always figuring out ourselves and wanting different thinks.|`|ccU5FNsmaa	welli know a girl whos been with a guy for 2yrs and theyre 16 now but they seem really happy so i guess so|`|VLr3jrutaa	my answer to that sort of question use to be always a big NO. but i saw a friend from high school and he told me that his little sister just got married. I asked who to and he told me. The funny thing is i knew of her at school and she was going out with the same guy she married since grade 9 or 10. And she would be at least 23 now. So i suppose you can meet mr right at any age.|`|wBpennsMaa	If you are lucky enough to find a person that great when you are that young of course you can spend the rest of your life with them. Anything is possible. There is no such thing as fake love. If you love someone, you love them.|`|h4R4Txjvaa	Yes it is possible but in our society it becomes rare chances because of the way we view it in our society and out thoughts about love|`|25bOvTYXaa	I think that it's totally possible for young love to last, I am still very convinced that the guy I like is my true love, and no matter how mean he is being, we'll get through it. So yeah definitely.|`|cTyNs4ckaa	good question... i guess we will never know, every relationship is different!|`|ev0SHwMyaa	My husband and I have been together since we were 16 and that was almost 14 years ago. We are very happy together and we have a 5 year old and one on the way. So as corny as it sounds it really can happen!|`|PAwqjxvaaa	nope....highschool relationships are VERY immature. it's just practice for the real thing....    they don't mean much because at that age everyone is still experimenting and don't know what they want...    but have fun a little, you don't need to worry about who you are going to marry for a while.......    make sure to be protected if having sex, and everything will work out smoothly|`|oj1TszL2aa	I would say that it depends on the type of love, I know that that sounds cryptic. As a young teen or even as a young child, your view of a relationship and your feelings about someone will be different from what they will be when you grow up. Whether or not that love will be 'real' and stand the test of time will depend on its ability to change and evolve as you both grow up.     If, for whatever reason, your relationship doesn't change as you do, chances are that it's not going to last. No love or relationship can be constant, it has to be continually changing, just as neither of you are the same from one day to the next.     My boyfriend and I first got together when we were 7. Yes, 7. It was one of those really stupid 'puppy love' type relationships where we thought we'd be together forever and yet didn't have a clue what love really was all about. Of course, that fizzled out. But then at 18 we got back together - and now our love and our views of the future are not the same as they were when we were 18, let alone when we were 7. We're now engaged, and planning to get married once we've both finished studying.     Don't pin all your hopes, dreams, and plans on one person, make sure that you keep some back for you too, just in case something goes horribly wrong. Enjoy what you have in the present. But in the same way, don't give up hope. It can happen.    Hope this helps.  x

UlEUWdhPaa	To work in Labor & Delivery you will need either an associates or bachelors degree in Nursing. An associates degree takes two years, a bachelors four.     In some areas it can be difficult to find a job in OB as a new grad. Many places will want you to have at least one year experience in Med/Surg first. This might help go to the OB message board they have tons of information on salary, what education you would need, and lots of other helpful books and links. Good Luck, go for what you love to do!    http://allnurses.com/ob-gyn-nursing/|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Rather than doing the whole L&D nurse, I would highly suggest becoming a direct entry midwife.  You can go online to find out more about it and it usually take four years.  It's much more rewarding and fulfilling.|`|yipMDefBaa	Npt sure how it works in the USA but in Australia you do your nursing degree then new graduate year.  I would try and get a placement in the maternity ward.  Then you get further education to become a midwife.
EULVtVDvaa	You can spot in your 1st Trimester and from my experience I did with my last pregnancy . It was only in the 1st 2 months and it was light brown as you stated . I did have implantation bleeding as well and it was 11 days after conception - but I think you passed that . I don't know . if you tested your hormone levels could still be low . Your best bet is to see your OB and have bleed work done . BUT take it easy since you are not sure until then and don't lift anything heavy . Good luck to you :)|`|7kGwZ1Ntaa	You're probably pregnant, or just having some rough sex. That's my opinion. Sometimes I bleed after me and my partner have some crazy sex. [TMI? Sorry.]|`|xq7S9H5Raa	I would take another pregnancy test.  My first pregnancy test says that I was not pregnant and two or three days later it says pregnant.  Why are you doing heavy lifting when you are not sure if you are pregnant.  Be careful!|`|Fq7FHQ44aa	i think u should read this article    http://babymed.com/faq/Content.aspx?1339...|`|GUEsVdaFaa	The test could have been faulty. Or, your cycle could be irregular. Or, if you've been having hormonal, stress level, diet or exorcise changes that could effect your cycle and make you spot. Sometimes the simplest of things can turn our cycles into unpredictable monsters.|`|n4YwNJViaa	Sometimes stress can cause your periods to be a little off, or make them stop. But, you could be having some implantation bleeding as well. You could wait a few days and test again, and then do the same in a week or two if the first one comes out negative. I had a lot of spotting with my first pregnancy. Good luck!!|`|MCTyWCu2aa	You could be pregnant but maybe Its just your period coming|`|9op65iQVaa	wow, i just posted a similar question.  It's possible WE might have tested too early, i think.  Everyone is different, and i hope someone here can tell you something that can ease your mind, even if its an opinion.  Bet you your preg.  Good luck.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Spotting after sex during pregnancy is extremely common. It could also be a little bit of implantation bleeding if you are pregnant. Take it easy until you see the doctor, and maybe lay off the sex for a little bit too, at least until you know what's going on with your body. Best of luck to you!

You don't mean hurting yourself in any way do you?    Please don't lose hope, keep trying, it gets better. And when you're through this difficult part of your life you'll be a MUCH stronger person.    Seek help- from a family member, a trusted friend, or 911 if it's that bad. Giving up is not the answer, I've tried it when I was a teen, it made things so much worse. I thought there was no hope, but life got better.

tdHIR9cLaa	well i think that you just have more milk now because when the baby nurses without the aid of a nipple shield your brain is getting more signals from the baby. if this is the case it should go away in a few days...     happy feeding! and good luck!|`|SwvpxMAuaa	I used a shield because my nipples were flatter... My son was just fine on it but then the nurse at my pediatricians office said not to use it anymore, i dont know why... but we stopped using it and i was in absolute pain and agony so sore and parts of my nipple were swollen and cut, i ended up getting an infection and finally had to stop breastfeeding. i wish i would have kept feeding but i just couldnt. If your nipple is sore you could use the nipple cream, i think it was called Lanolin... they sell it at the store near the bra pads for breastfeeding, its safe for baby too. If its your actual breast thats sore, i would take a wash cloth and wrap it in plastic wrap and put it in the microwave for a few secs to warm it up and that would take away some soreness, or you could go totally opposite with ice packs for swelling. Sorry that was alot or unhelpful... just unsure of exactly what you wanted to know!|`|TvYX1yXWaa	i only used it for a week but after my nipples really hurt|`|vpHhryPWaa	I used a shield for the first almost 3 months of my sons life - he was born early and wasn't able to stay on the breast without it. I slowly started weaning him off it and when I did my nipples became tender. The shield helped him latch on - so now he's figuring out how to get on and stay on without it - it'll take a little while for your nipples to 'toughen up' and become accustomed to his nursing. If your nipples are getting really sore and it is painful when nursing then he may not be latched on right - try to speak to a lactation consultant or health nurse who helps nursing mothers to see if they can help his latch.   Good luck!!|`|TvO3eVIMaa	i had to use a nipple shield THE WHOLE TIME I NURSED...ugh i hated that thing! But when i swiched my daughter to the bottle my breasts of course became engorged as i dried up, what you explained is what it felt like...but if your still nursing you shouldnt be engorged, i would call the dr.|`|t5tU3Xe8aa	You know something I had the SAME problem and it ended up being Mastitus!  I had to pump until their was NOTHING left every 2-3 hours till the pain went away!!  It was hard don't get me wrong but I was also trying to feed twins LOL now that we've got our routine we're set!  I'm all the way down to 1 feeding a day and that is the goodmorning feeding (I work nights so I do a morning feeding with the babies) : )|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	I only used it for a week I hated it. Have you tried feeding more or pump. Sounds like your full of milk.    I would talk to a lactation consultant|`|0tHYQHY7aa	I used a shield for a short time and when I stopped using it they were a sore after nursing but since then it has gotten better. I did have sores also and they eventually went away. I still get a little sore now but it is not as bad.
q1YDp1y3aa	You made a good decision when he was born. it would have hurt him then, and it will hurt him now. There's no reason to circumcise. There are NO benefits to your son now. The supposed reduction in UTIs only applies to the first year, and all other potential benefits do not come into play until he is a sexually active adult- by which time he will be old enough to make his own decision as to whether those potential benefits are worth it.     I would leave him be. If you decide to do it, he will likely be put under general anesthesia. That carries with it its own risks, including death, rarely. Risks of the procedure itself include removal of too much skin, and accidental damage to the penis, some of which could be disfiguring and disabling sexually. There are also psychological risks. Your son will be old enough to know what is going on, but not old enough to know why you let the doctors hurt him. There will be pain. If he is potty trained, expect relapses. He may also show signs of anxiety or fear, including clinginess or nightmares.     Here is some more info about circ to help you decide-    Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?    You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...    You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)    Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....  http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...    Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...    The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. http://www.icgi.org/    It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with. It was virtually unknown in this country until the 20th century. This slide show takes you through the rise of circumcision.... http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA|`|4arnbpUCaa	His father is right. He does not need to be circumcised.    Now that he's 3 years old, the procedure is riskier. There is a higher chance of complications.    There is nothing wrong with not being circumcised! Most men in the world aren't.    The best thing you can do now is read up on the procedure, and you'll realize how unnecessary it is. Here are some links to help:|`|VNAiB4v8aa	Why change your sons body. God made it perfect in every way. I really think circumcision  of a boy, unless there is  some medical problem, should be illegal.  When you remove a boys foreskin, it can never be replaced, if he wanted the additional Sexual pleasure it offers him later in life.  Leave it the way it is.|`|jC1Mdsefaa	I would not do it.  It is more painful after 6 months.  The best time to have done it would have been when he was first born.  I think your Husband is right.    There is no problem with him being uncut.  He will just need to keep it properly cleaned when he is older, to avoid getting an infection.    Leave it how it is.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	At 3 it is major surgery under a general anaesthetic.

There are a few studies that claim it raises the risk of STDs, but I say, teach the kid about condoms instead.    The American Acadamy of Pediatrics does not recommend circumcising boys anymore.    Why are you thinking of doing it now?|`|HwxBL1B1aa	uhmm. it's a pain that he will remember.  also i have herd that if a guy get circumcised he loses some feeling of pleasure during sex.|`|Yb99bIdnaa	Foreskin is not a birth defect! There's no medical justification for it, it's just a cultural tradition in some places.    80% of men worldwide are natural -- circumcision is only common in a few countries, and usually done as part of a religious ritual. In the US during a wave of puritan zealotry it became popular as a "cure" for the "sins" of masturbation and sexual pleasure. It became clear that circumcised boys still masturbated, so doctors made up other reasons to sell the (very profitable) surgery, but people are finally realizing that it's unnecessary, and circumcision rates are dropping.    You made the right choice when your son was born, to respect your son's right to self-determination, to keep him whole and let him keep all his parts. There's no reason to amputate a healthy foreskin, especially since it has so many benefits during sex. A lot of people aren't comfortable thinking about their kids' eventual adult sex lives, but trust me, as an uncircumcised guy I wouldn't give up my foreskin for the world.     You don't need to do a thing now, except maybe learn some more about the history of circumcision, I think it'll shock and horrify you like it has me.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	There's no need to do it and it would hurt him. IMHO 3 is the worst time to do it, he will remember but not understand the pain.    It's unnecessary except in the case of severe foreskin problems but those are really rare and can mostly be treated other ways. As he's having no problem, why remove a normal body part?    Harriet|`|K4zsztkRaa	There is nothing wrong with being circumcised. There is no reason to do it. It causes your child unneeded pain.     I advise you not to do it now  Your son is 3. He is giong to be terrified going into a hospital being put to sleep and waking up with his penis hurting extreemly bad. Then in his diapers or pull up he's going to be peeing and deficating in the wound for about 2-3 weeks. And because he is older, if it hurts he can refuse to go to the bathroom. That can causes serious problems and even infections.  Plus a doctor isn't going to want to do it at this point. He is going to want to wait untill he is older to do it, and at an older age it's cruel. (I personaly think it's cruel unless he choses it for himself)    He is fine, he doesn't need to be circmcised.    There are myths out there that say: It's cleaner, I'tshealthier, he will have a less chance of getting and infection or and STD if he is circumcised. And those are 100% false.  Your son is perfectly healthy the way he was born.  There is no need to put him through a really painfull surgery that alters his genitals without his permission.    Leave him as he is, if not you could really traumatize him.  He's perfect that way he was born.    -Connor|`|A5mkPwIqaa	Do you want to have him circumcised now? If you don't have a strong desire to have him circumcised, then I would just leave him how he is! Some babies are, some babies aren't, there aren't major risks either way or major benefits either way. It's just a preference/religious belief thing.|`|QYImE5DUaa	Don't get him circumcised!

My son is circumcided, my husband and i chose to do it.  If he does get circumcised at this age it will be a real surgery and he will have to be put under and will remember. He will probably be afraid of doctors for a while after...something to concider??? Im sure it will be painful after words for a while.  I would say, he is healthy so dont put him through it.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	My sons father is not circumcised and I'm not going to have it done to my son either.  After researching it and talking with my doctor, there are really no real health benefits of having it done and its really not necessary.  Also, at 3, its going to hurt and he'll more likely remember it than if you had done it when he was born.  I would say just to leave it as is.

She may be changing positions or something. Remember they are growing a lot now so you are going to feel more movements that feel like nudges and less like big kicks because they dont have as much room.

h9L1AtMsaa	I did the pump only and it worked very well for me!! The only con I really had with breastpumping period is you still have to pump in the middle of the night regardless if the baby is awake or not, otherwise you will leak right through the breast pads and all over yourself and you bed!! But other than that, I didn't have any problems with the pumping only. It is a bit painful at first but it does get better I promise you. Make sure you buy all the breast and nipple creams they sell, and lots and lots of nursing pads, believe me you will need them.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	It is possible, but it is much easier if you can breast feed for at least the first 6 weeks to get your milk supply established. I want to encourage you to try feeding your baby from the breast and see, you may find it to be not as weird as you fear. I was never able to picture myself breast feeding, but once I had my first child, it became natural. I want to stress that if you are very uncomfortable and it seems to interfere with bonding then breast feeding is not the right option and I'm glad you are thinking about pumping your milk instead of looking to formula. It will be very necessary to to purchase a good pump, The medela pump in style or other hospital grade pump would be best as the cheaper electric models will likely burn out if you are using them constantly. You will need to pump at least as often as you would be feeding (every 2 hours at first) and without latching baby on to the breast there is the possibility that your milk supply will not become adequate so again I stress the importance of at least trying to latch baby on to the breast to stimulate your milk production in the early weeks. A lactation consultant can help you a lot so I encourage you to talk to someone from La Leche League www.lllc.com and wish you the best of luck with your little one.|`|2G2KBV1Qaa	I feel the same way i have been pumping for 5 weeks now..my baby is in the Nicu but i am not planning to breastfeed just pump....it pretty easy it doesn't hurt at all you just need to have patience.because at first little milk was coming out then i started filling up bottles and now..barely any milk is coming out. I honestly thought about quitting a few times but i know this is better for my baby. I also only plan to pump until baby comes home or might give her formula and breast milk....If you have problem with your milk supply ask ur DR about reglan i heard it helps women who are having trouble breastfeeding. Also eat healthy and drink plenty of water...Remeber breast milk is the best for your baby|`|ui7waO1haa	Positive: The baby is able to get the full amount of nutrients from the mother's breast milk without actually having to breast-feed.     Negative: It takes time, but it is well worth it in the end!|`|tdHIR9cLaa	BREAST MILK  is breast milk no matter how they get it... so that is a pro... the con is if you pump only your milk will start to slow down.... it will take a while though! but there are ways to get your milk supply up... if you dont want to put the baby to breast which is the best way to up your milk, then take fenugreek, or i found that brewers yeast works great wonders.     Hope that helps           &  Happy feeding
jD8TxlLfaa	I don't want this to come across as rude or anything, I'm just curious. How come you can't buy baby clothes closer to where you live? Why can you only buy them when you "go away" to have the baby? How far do you have to travel for that? How are you getting pre-natal care?  Like I said, I really don't want that to come across as rude, I was just lost as to why you can't buy baby clothes closer to where you live and stuff.    To answer your question, though, I'd get a few sets of everything. Babies can make a lot of mess, it's nice to have extra sets so you don't have to do laundry even more often than you're going to have to. I don't believe newborns really need many toys. They need love and affection. I'd buy a car seat (infant and toddler), a stroller, a playpen, and a bouncer at least. Bouncers can be handy so you don't constantly have to carry the baby around. Maybe a baby sling as well. Buy different sizes for clothes and diapers because babies grow fast. Maybe some children's videos or something. I'm sure you'll do just fine. New mothers are always worried that they don't have enough for the baby. :)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	this is what i had/ sometimes more, but i had too much of a lot...    twelve bottles; buy the big ones, bc if u buy the little ones, u will have to go back and get more big ones when they start drinking more than four oz...    clothes; i would only buy a few nb and 0/3 size outfits; you won't need them often and baby may or may not fit in nb clothing depending on size/shape for very long, or may wear them quite a while, so until u have an idea how fast baby is growing, i wouldn't get anything bigger bc it may not be appropriate for the season..buy enough onesies/sleepnplays with feet to last about a week....if u are short on money, buy about seven, but you may have to wash more often due to clothing changes...ten should be great...buy a swaddler that closes with velcro, at least two...socks, hand mittens, hats, buy some long sleeved onesies, you can have them worn as shirts or under bedclothes or other clothes for an extra layer..buy some frag and dye free laundry detergent....  do you have a pad and covers for the changing table?bins or something to go on the shelves to hold supplies?  i would have at least 3 sheets, a waterproof mattress cover and at least 3 ultimate sheet savers...  ten swaddling weight blankets and at least four to five heavy weight blankets to cover baby when you go out...we don't use throw rugs...i would buy the same things for the bassinet, but i would use nightclothes and the swaddler and no blankets as that is a suffocation risk..i wouldn't feel comfortable without our monitors--start babyproofing when baby shows signs of getting ready to crawl or walk whichever comes first...  just get some of the little toys that hang from the plastic links in bright stimulating colors, an unbreakable mirror, and a boppy pillow to prop baby on for tummy time and to relieve your tired arms when you are holding baby and a few cotton covers....  towels/washcloths/baby tub  diaper genie2 is great; if u want email me and i will make out alist of things i like the most    a good thing to do to see if there are things you are missing is to go to babies r us website, and they have a page for ppl who are making their registry with lists of things that they suggest; of course u don't need everything on there, but it will give you a good idea if you look through it and they have links to things on their website so u get an idea of what you are looking for....|`|oDGpmkMaaa	I like the playtex drop in bottles.

I bought her clothes a size  up so they will last longer so instead of getting newborn i got 3- 6 months.  of course i got about 10 bottles with plenty of nipples. i stroller and car seat plenty of booties.  and a diaper genie..and that was it.  well of coures diapers other than that all that extra stuff was unnecessary and i think is a waste of money

After 3 months the baby starts to get on more of a normal schedule but till then you are on baby time.  If baby wants to stay up till 2 am you have to stay up too.      It is not fair for your mom to dump her baby on a 14 year old.  I hope you are not going to have to care for this baby and miss out on your teenage years.  But doing some baby sitting and helping out is good.|`|dTLTNZTzaa	I don't know about the rest but for me and for my husband it did not take long to get used to the baby.

I think you are doing a great thing helping your mom out. But MRS. Z plus 3 is right - you have to go to school and have your own life. Helping out one thing - ruining your life - completely different. You mom is responsible for the baby and your wellbeing. You will be responsible for your kids|`|7rCeCVl2aa	"we really cant afford daycare on top of all the things we have to buy for the baby"    Highlighting the WE part...this isn't YOUR problem hun... I think it is wonderful that you are so willing to help but this is your MOTHER'S baby, not yours.     Why are you taking on line high school classes? You should be IN high school...    Do not sell your self short. You are only 13 years old. This is not a WE situation and you shouldn't be worrying about things like daycare and what needs to be bought for the baby.    Do yourself a huge favor and GO to high school and make some friends. Let your mother worry about the baby. I know it is your sibling but it is not your responsibility to take care of that baby.|`|3klIx1Egaa	it took me a few days to get into the swing of things, but to be completely used to it was probably a month or so.
r39EDGhPaa	I think his hair sucks.|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	his blurred image is nice looking.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	the picture looks like it is 2 girls. he needs a haircut, i think he looks nice besides that though =]|`|WGAFP6mSaa	The 'guy' looks feminine.|`|ozATw7s0aa	maybe if he cut his hair|`|f3LrMhqWaa	that's a guy?i thought that was a girl!!!!|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	How are we meant to see the picture?

1c498d03fe9bb2e8719c81fe361b9912aa	yeah every women is different but yeah this is normal symptoms my whole boob ached like mad they were like lead weights!  good luck and congrats|`|lnUrm4sGaa	yes it is normal its your body preparing for when baby comes|`|rx0ekB9Paa	yes its normal. your breast are sore because they are preparing for the milk,and the veins are showing up because of the increased blood flow. nipples can get sore also.|`|cz4zO8wYaa	it does depend on age and what your diet is but i wouldn't worry your body is experiencing changes to it's normal life so it could be a reaction if not see a pregnancy doctor|`|zb91UfGCaa	yes it is normal. to relieve some of the discomfort yr feeling go to yr local maternity shop and be fitted with a good bra, can also be worn at night if needed. This should help a great deal. best wishes michelle x|`|ff4be252ca1bd5dd48919f16e87d90c2aa	Please note I'm using my husbands name has mine keeps signing out. ayli1984    No it's not just the nipple it's the full breast which becomes soar. The reason there tender and heavy is there filling with milk (yes already) and the veins are there because has they grow they need more blood supply. Everything you are saying is normal only thing is you didn't say how early. I noticed veins appear on my breasts not long after 20 weeks however every one and every pregnancy is different. Good luck.
F8KmTbqjaa	LOL YES it happens to my daughter ALL the time at least ten times a day.  She is 14 months old and has very little hair.  She can be dressed in pink from head to toe and people still call her a boy!  People always say "Well you should Peirce her ears or put a head band on her".  I have given up and just say thank you even if somebody says she is handsome!  I went through the mad stage and would yell at people that she is a GIRL, but got over it!  My husband and I just laugh and people get uncomfortable and take a closer look and realize she is a girl and feel stupid!    EDIT: LOL LOL HAHAHAHA  I told you, you got the head band and ear piercing suggestion!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|52bAHCaUaa	My daughter has a couple times. One time she was wearing blue jeans, pink shoes, pink shirt and a little pink headband. LOL...    Another time a man came over to tell me how beautiful she was, he accidentally said how old is he. I said, She is 5 months old! But I don't think he really meant to do that...|`|1s3nddaYaa	when my son was younger people used to think he was a girl. and as he got older people realized he was a boy and i got told. aww he is pretty enough to be a girl lol. or something like that|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	my daughter was always small and one day wore a purple ballerina out fit and a guy said how is he i was like its a girl shes in purple and he was like o at that age guys care wear pink and purple . people do not think|`|lwtBIBmoaa	well i mean they are babies   it happends   cause their faces are not fully developed so u can distinguish|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I still have my 2.5 year old confused with a girl, he just has such long eyelashes that it makes him look feminine.   Oh well, he's a boy in all the ways possible.   As for bald little girls, yeah...   I knew a little girl who did not get hair until she was in kindergarten, and even I was called a boy when I wore pants as a kid - and I had long flowing hair.   I think as long as you know and your child gets to decide who they are, it's no big deal.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	so many people have mistaken my daughter for a boy. its usually old people- which i guess explains it, cuz she has been dressed in the girliest little dresses and things since she was born, with pink blankies- the whole deal.    men dont really care about the sex lol. they just speak without thought lol|`|fyyfPEemaa	it's okay dont worry about it, it's a common mistake|`|2F5HNPqPaa	My son has been mistaken for a girl countless times... despite the boyish clothes and blue aeroplane pram blanket!!!      I think it's because he has such big eyes and long eyelashes which make him look more feminine.      Just correct people and hope they feel stupid!  I mean pink/blue... it's that simple with babies right?!|`|JP2h62qiaa	Hunter can be in ALL Blue and people will be like "She is so pretty" UGH! Im quick to correct. Then people are like"Oh, Im sorry" Then I just say "why would a girl be in all blue with a shirt saying Handsome?"  That was the shirt he was wearing last time someone said it. It pisses me off now!|`|UiQ6V377aa	I hate when people assume the sex of your baby. If the baby is in ALL pink or ALL blue you assume it's either a boy or girl. But if there is any question I'll ask "what's it's name?" or "boy or girl?"    Girls can wear blue and boys don't usually wear pink,but they can!    When they call your baby the wrong sex just smile and say "HER name is....." they should get the hint|`|4el3goYMaa	This happens to me all the time. My little girl is 15 months and has fine hair and is chubby. I got her ears pierced and started buying her those big headband bows off of ebay and most of the comments have stopped.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	My girls always seemed to wear pink when they were little bitty and most people would refer them them as boys. Hair bows, pierced ears, pink - nothing seems to get peoples attention that you are holding a girl.|`|vOgfAvMlaa	YES. people ask if our son is a boy or a girl even if he is dressed all in blue. plus he even looks like a boy.     a couple asked my mom if my sister was a boy or girl when she was in a pink dress.|`|AA11209024	This is a common thing that happens all the time.  Just politely correct them and soon people will be able to easily distinguish.  This happens to many.   Hang in there  G|`|z74wSbQoaa	Yes, it happens to me a lot.  I think a lot has to do with the bald headness.  My first child was a girl, but she had a ton of hair and no one ever assumed she was a boy.  My second daughter is pretty much bald and she can be in head to toe pink and people will say something in reference to her being a boy.  I saw a onsie the other day that had this crazy writing, looked like the statement was being yelled and it said, "I'm a girl!!"|`|VY4LqfLpaa	I was registering for college one day recently and I had our son with me.  He was wearing like blue and green I think it was...there was this one lady who came up to us and was asking if my baby was a boy or a girl.  Told her he was a boy...I can't remember how many more times I ran into that woman throughout the day and everytime she kept trying to make our son into a girl.  Drove me up the wall...I finally got tired of correcting her and would try to go the other way everytime she would come in my direction...|`|J87cQEuzaa	Yes!! My son had tons of hair when he was born and as he got older his hair started growing out a little bit. He was referred to as a girl so many times....even if he was wearing blue, brown, black....some people still referred to him as "he"....aargh!    Finally at 4 months old I went and took him to his very first haircut...it's been much better after then. Even tough at church last sunday I heard the mom next to me telling her daughter to be quiet or else she was going to wake "her up" referrring to my son.....uuhh oh well.|`|xeBO8Mjcaa	Don't have one :-||`|qxw1k0Kmaa	my little brother was always mistaken for a girl because he used to have long hair. And just to mess with people i used to tell people that he was a girl. my mom would get really angry and it was halairiuos when she had to explain to people that my bro was a boy|`|uBvgbSMsaa	It is not just guys. My oldest 2 were 18 months apart a boy and a girl. She would be in a pink frilly dress and him in an obvious boys outfit but because he was petite and she was huskier little old ladies would refer to them as a cute pair of twins and refer to her ( the younger of the 2) as a boy and him as a girl.|`|74pfB2Bnaa	It happens to me a lot. My little girl mostly wears clothing passed down from my nephew. It doesn't bother me though. I'm just so used to gender mix-ups: I used to wear my older brothers' clothes as kid and was frequently considered a boy until I was about 12 years old. I just laugh about it.|`|hdzlWALdaa	my son is alwys in BLUE n in very boyish clothes but ppl alwys tell me "ooo how pretty she is", "she looks just like you", "wat a princess!" it drives me insane! i get soo many comments like that, that now i gave up n go along n just say thanks instead of correctin them. he does look like a girl in a way but thats y i dress him very boyish but dsnt help.    ive noticed more boys are being born though than grls atm lol. all my frnds hav had boys or are preg with boys.|`|njLVIp55aa	YES...my daughter doesnt look anything like a boy...she will be dressed in a pink dress and in her pink carseat or stroller and people still ask..i just walk away now that she is 8 months old....its ridiculous...sometimes i think they are trying to be funny...|`|PBI3tCKaaa	Even when he is all in blue, Ezekiel gets mistaken for a girl because apparently "he is to good-looking to be a boy" which is what I get all the time. URGH!|`|8wnvhBQTaa	That's happenend to me a few times, I have boy / girl twins and they are 9months old and despite me always dressing my girl in pinks & purples & my boy usually blue or brown etc people ask me if it is 2 boys or what sex are they,  My girl definately looks like a girl and my boy a boy.|`|EiyCwOGOaa	this can be expected but just add a little headband or something girly onto her outfit|`|cwyMulZOaa	My cousin does. She is really pretty but has a short hair cut.I laugh about it, But her mom hates it.|`|5KdPRKIVaa	Yes. A lot of old women seem to think my daughter is a boy....even when she's wearing pink.|`|c87f27f0437532e03040d093f68f1231aa	trying piercing her ears...|`|10456fcb36c09d510c3f73faba95f075aa	My daughter was top to toe in pink. A man asked what her name was and when I said Jaymie, he said "Well, he's very handsome". !!!  Who dresses a boy in pink?!?!|`|u4NXQkq7aa	i have 3 daughters and when they where young they where always mistaken but i would say no way that baby there is gonna be the first female president now who looks like the moron take it instride they r only human|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Oh yes. I have only been out twice with my daughter since she was born, both times she was dressed head to toe in pink and i've been asked "is it a boy or a girl", "what's his name".... she also has very little hair. However it's been women in these cases!|`|ggETPqedaa	Yup, my baby was wrapped all in blue one day. Very cute little masculine outfit actually. I got...how is she doing? I just blinked and looked at them and went -HE'S- doing wonderfully. I simply try to let it slide right off of me, sometimes it doesn't work sometimes it does.|`|92VH41EZaa	I'm not a mum but i know mums that have this problem. its common yeah they're resulting into buying tshirt that were pink saying "mummy's little angel" and "princess" and stuff heh.     dont worry it wont last long =)  i'm sure she's beautiful x

65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	I started pumping a little when my daughter was 3 weeks.  I used the Medela hand pump and would get only 1 oz out of each side if I was lucky. It took my like 20 to 30 min to get just that.  With some practice and as your baby get bigger and your supply goes up the more you will get.  Now I can get 3 oz in 20 min and my daughter is 7 weeks.     Remember your baby can get more out of you then the pump can. Also your baby is still little and yes your body only makes as much as is needed.|`|huRnrj0Waa	THAT IS ABOUT HOW MUCH THE BABY SHOULD BE DRINKING. WHEN MY BABY WAS 1 MONTH I WAS ONLY GETTING ABOUT2 OZ. LET THE BABY EAT AND THEN WAIT ABOUT AN HOUR AND PUMP. BUT THE MORE YOU LET THE BABY SUCK THE MORE YOU WILL PRODUCE. LET THE BABY SUCK 24/7. IT'S BETTER THAN PUMPING!|`|Z67HkDKCaa	Yeah I think you're only getting what you need so it is not much. My son is 7 months and I only get an ounce or two after I feed him....|`|NAzAmFDnaa	When I pump, I get several let downs, so don't stop pumping so quickly.  I pump while watching a TV program that I enjoy.  It takes my mind off how much time is passing, and then when I look down a the bottles, I'm suprised at how much milk is there.  My pumping sessions are usually 15min.  Then I know I've gotten all the good hindmilk too.  Just try and relax, and pump a little longer.  I think you'll get more milk.|`|0tHYQHY7aa	When I first started pumping I did not get much. As time went on my milk production increased more and more and I was pumping about 1 1/2 bottles (6oz each) full. Just keep up the pumping and more milk will be produced with time. You can pump after feedings but I did not always do that.|`|aWkp6AJOaa	if you are breastfeeding first & then pumping you usually won't pump very much.  she is still young so you may be only producing what she needs.  one way to produce more milk is to pump more often, if you are only pumping 4-5x per day try 7-8x through the day.  when it seems that my milk has stopped i will move the pump a little to the side or towards my breast it causes a little more pressure & more comes out.  also make sure you are getting enough fluids & try to cut out caffeine as much as possible.  don't give up but don't get to discouraged this will reduce your milk supply also.  some women can't produce much & it's ok to also use formula.  don't make anyone feel like it's not ok to breastfeed.  it's your choice.  have fun with your new baby, they grow up so fast.  ;)
aKFhuIoWaa	it is really up to you, but it is recommended that you bath only once or twice a week when they are very little. Soaps etc strip the skin of natural oils which keep the skin soft and healthy. obviously you should wash bums and faces every day with water and cotton wool .  I only bathed my DD twice a week before she was mobile and it kept her skin really good.     But if you feel you should be bathing more often then do so.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	That's perfect! Make sure to use lotion on her to keep her skin from drying out. My son sweats and drools a lot and he smells if I don't bathe him daily.. Seriously. I figure a bathe is just as easy as a sponge bath..|`|4d4bc6d418e7f55703a46a017910893caa	My Doctor said that you shouldn't every day because it can dry out their sensitve skin! We bath her every other day too...I think that is good enough!|`|obN6p3Cgaa	No do what is best for you and your baby.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	2-3 times per week, same for my 5 yr old, unless there is a reason for an extra bath, like playing in the mud or getting oatmeal in the hair.|`|X2EPEEwbaa	I would say a little less.  When my son was born I bathed him every 3 or 4 days... now that he's a little older (10 months) he gets one every other day.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	my daughter is a water freak, so she has been having a bath every night since she was 2 days old.|`|JP2h62qiaa	you should wipe them down with a warm cloth daily but give them a full bath about 3 times a week. They don't have as many active oil glands so their skin can dry up fast. Use lotion.|`|mvKbfkhGaa	Definately less!! She could get sick! You can't bathe her everyday...her skin is still too fragile.|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	which ever works for you, with my second born I started off bathing him every other day and his skin got dry, so I bathed him every 3 to 4 days and he's much better now.|`|JXHy2EHQaa	Even with my reflux babies, they never had baths more than once a week.  They aren't playing in dirt, they aren't sweating, they aren't getting food in their hair.  It's just 'playtime' for you, and if you both enjoy it, that's great.  If she's not happy, then don't worry about giving full baths yet.  When my third was a little older, I had a mesh shower sling so she did get wet with me in the shower quite a bit :)
E7ViD8EWaa	O.O    That  is  wrong  on  SO  many  levels.|`|QSodlfMraa	WHAT DO YOU NEED HELP WITH?|`|1ZWNmQ8Iaa	ewwwww ur 14 and with ur step brother wow|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	2 pts....oy|`|2FhPfxnsaa	That's really unfortunate!

jcdey9cgaa	Just relax and enjoy this time.  I know it sounds hard to do but it is almost over.  Right now your baby is safe and protected from the world let that last as long as possible.  Fix things up for the baby.  Cook your husband a great meal. Sit and read to your baby.  (I know it sounds crazy but the research on how that stimulates the baby;s mind is amazing)  You may feel usless but right now you are doing way more than you can imagine and you are probably being more useful than anyone around you who isn't pregnant because of what you are doing for your baby.  Before you know up you will be up all night feeding and rocking and changing diapers so enjoy the rest.  I know you will be a great mother!|`|537b873668b83aa721d2aa3b05dd78c0aa	hormones, hormones, hormones the last couple of weeks all women, pregnant women go threw this, I was crying and wanted no one to touch me but the end result is wonderful because now my beautiful gift from heaven is 18yrs old and a very good person, to really get over this just enjoy being pregnant and eat a lot of food. talk to your stomach and the little person in their, give your tummy a massage, read your tummy a story, be lazy, sleep, watch tv shows you wouldn.t usually watch, just enjoy those last few weeks and oh get a toy gun with the sticky arrows to shot at people who piss you off THIS REALLY WORKS TO GET ALL YOUR FRUSTRATIONS OUT AND ITS FUN FOR YOU.|`|ElBIeRFNaa	how can you say you're useless?  you're growing a human being!  that's THE most important thing you can do!    i know how you feel...i was in sooo much discomfort the last few weeks of pregnancy and just felt like a bum, but i wasn't.  i was housing our daughter until she was ready to come into the world.  and trust me...the forgetfulness gets worse.  don't sweat it.  it comes with growing a human being inside you.|`|u0mZAPuDaa	I have to say I give you props for even thinking about initiating sex!    I couldn't have done it and wouldn't have wanted to.    I tell you, I didn't make it through the last few weeks. I went to the store at 37 weeks and two days and bought some castor oil.    My doctor said it was safe and my daughter wouldn't come out unless I she was ready.    At 10:30p I drank three tablespoons in some grape juice. I woke my husband up at 1:30am because my water had broke! My daughter, Adalyn Karen, was born at 7:47p that evening!    HAVE THAT BABY!|`|bO1gUExAaa	I am 37 weeks and the only reason I don't feel useless is because I have 2 young girls who rely on me otherwise all I want to do is sleep and be left alone, I get depressed because my husband doesn't even cuddle up to me, I asked him about it and he is worried he'll keep me awake, so he says.  Your hormones are raging right now and only time will help.
7HzfgRmwaa	oh yes.. I remember 20 weeks pregnant! I too loved being pregnant then! You can not care about pampering and getting dressed up but still be cute because you are pregnant and use the im pregnant excuse all you want even though things aren't that tough...    You just wait missy! :) Around 32 weeks prego things definitely changed for me!! I couldn't look good if i tried now. I can't move it hurts. I eat anything I gain 5 more pounds! UGH!!! I hate it  NOW and am soo ready for my body to be mine again! Haha! And trust me - NOBODY Is checking me out these days :)|`|yB5go5wbaa	I don't mind it most of the time.  My boyfriend brushes the snow off my car for me and takes out the trash right when I ask him to.  Oh, and rubs my feeeeeet, I don't know if I can milk it as much as I do after I have the baby :)|`|nHpd4lRXaa	Well I don't use pregnancy as an excuse.    However I absolutely love being pregnancy. I am 6-7 weeks with  2, and I can't wait until I have a big belly and can feel my baby moving.|`|YspTfI8Faa	yeah...I have to admit that I do lol.|`|SGeo7cqYaa	YES! I love being pregnant! I love the fact that their is a little life growing inside me! I love it, I love it, I love it!!!|`|01vMpHkWaa	i love it and i hate it  i love feeling my lil boy  but i hate always having to pee, not being able to bend, and the tiredness    9 months is long enough|`|fc9ecb5a900817a0bcf8f6fa3590baf3aa	No. I am constantly tired and some things that i like to eat now make me sick. I am tired of feeling constantly tired and sick.|`|rS7fh6pRaa	how far along are you? sounds like your just starting out..   I was that way.. now that im almost 40 weeks I feel like a whale.. and I can't sleep, I get heartburn backpains leg cramps! .. :(    So I hate being pregnant right now! I feeel like will this ever end!|`|gxlEqdclaa	Yeah just wait for the last 6 weeks or so. You will probably hate it! You won't be able to get comfortable sleeping, sitting, standing and walking.  Sounds like your in the early second trimester. I loved being pregnant then too. It goes down hill in the third trimester.|`|HcMvtMT7aa	I liked being pregnant because I knew I was growing a beautiful baby inside that was a mix of me and the only other person I love more than anything in the whole world.  But I also hated it!  I had sciatica (pinched nerve in spine that caused severe pain and numbness on my left thigh), severe heartburn, my back hurt all the time, my feet hurt all the time, I couldn't fit into ANYTHING, I couldn't stand on my feet for more than 10 minutes at a time.
PW3hcVZiaa	It is called ptyalism, and it isn't that common, but very irriating for those who have it.  A friend of mine has had it for both pregnancies, and she HATES it.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Like spitting on the floor like a camel, or just spraying a little while talking? Neither|`|G94NlpZ0aa	I produce alot of saliva now that I'm pregnant. lol :)    but I don't just spit in public.  usually in the bathroom.|`|x5SJDvIraa	I had a friend at work actually tell me she had the same thing going on. The second she gave birth, the urge to spit just left her. I had a bit of it, but mine was due to nausea. I just had to spit or I would throw up. I'm over it now, entering my third trimester.    But yes, its normal. And so embarrassing. But our bodies do weird things when pregnant. :)|`|f3n2zXG2aa	Good Lord what a dumb thing for a woman to do.  I see men doing this before they go in a door or come out the door of places.  Think they are marking their "territory" or something.  She needs to carry kleenex, and never be without them.  If she spit on the floor around me, she would be embarrassed in front of everyone for the rest of the day.|`|nHpd4lRXaa	That's not a symptom, you're friend just has no respect or manners and would rather look like a trucker then a respectable lady.|`|TGzOrftPaa	No, but increased saliva production is completely normal.|`|Ud871v3paa	never heard of being forced to spit, lol.
AA11471252	Have you considered homeschooling her?    If she does her work fine at home, then there should be no struggle with you her and another person. She can just do her work, adn move on at her own pace. She may be bored in the classroom and need to be learning at a different pace or level.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	My son has kind of been the same way- mainly around Thanksgiving he got like that. Truth is, he was just burned out and your daughter could be burned out too. I let him stay home sometimes just because I can tell that he could really use a day off to stay home with Mommy just like old times. We go to McDonald's playground and stay for an hour at lunch & watch our favorite shows. I don't know that this is what your daughter needs, but for me, I think him seeing that I noticed he was getting burned out and actually doing something to make him feel better about it meant a lot. He also took note that this was "his day" to give his mind a rest from schoolwork- none of the regular weekend activities, just a lazy day.|`|b6e3e5765ea9340b4ffd975bfca501aaaa	First,  the teacher should have a meeting with you.  As a teacher myself I would never "refuse" to meet with parents.      Second, it is very common for kids to start seeing what little they can get away with.  Especially after winter break.  Starting K is exciting, starting BACK to K isn't.  And it is very typical to get the "I don't know" answer from kids.  It's not that they can't - they just won't.    Second, when I saw that my son was getting very lazy about his work in K, I started having him redo anything he brought home that I knew he could do better on.    The first couple of times I just had him do it for me, but once it continued, then I started having him redo it and give it back to his teacher.  I wrote a note on it saying that I just wanted her to know that this was the quality of work that he was capable of.  Sometimes it is hard as a teacher to really know what a kid can be expected to do without pushing them to frustration.      I know it seems "severe" for K - but I did it in a very POSITIVE way.  In a way that made it something that boost his ego rather than made him feel badly.  However, he did not want to redo work so he stepped up his effort in class.  The trick is to show them they can and that you expect them to - but not make them feel stressed to be "perfect."    I found that this technique worked well in 1 as well & now in 2.  I only needed to do that once with my daughter who is now in K.    The last thing would be to try and take time and volunteer in the classroom - even if you have to take a day off and just do it one time.  Call the teacher and say that you have X day off, and you would really like to volunteer.  You will quickly get a feel for what is going on in the classroom.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	I do a combination of encouragement and discouragement.....take away privileges immediately, THAT DAY.  Then the next day is  a new day and a clean slate.    good luck|`|3DrMINppaa	I have a niece who is the same way, its almost like I have to force her to sit down and do her homework (not sure if thats in your problem or not), I'm not really sure how to help, but do you ever try working on homework with her? That may help. Have you tried speaking with her teachers? They may be able to give you more insite. Sorry I can't be of more help.|`|639b2178cbbecee8a881b09ae5058d5eaa	I would look into what changed between school before winter break and after.  Did something major change that is creating this such as a bully or social problems, or even her teacher?  Is something at school causing her stress? do you truly think she might have a learning disablility?    IF that is not the case you should show her why it is important to do good work.  Explain to her and show her that people who don't try hard and do a good job don't have money to do nice things or have nice things.  I know this sounds a little grown up for a kindergardener but you'd be surprised!      Show her all the nice things she has (that she probably takes for granted because she is only 6) including toys, tv privlidges, nice clothes, yummy snack foods.  Explain to her that if she wants to have these nice things, she must do a good job in school to earn them. If she isn't working hard in school and earning good grades, you will have to start taking the "luxury" items away from her and every day explain to her that she can have nice things if she is willing to work for them.     We are trying to teach my 11yr old step daughter this and I wish she could have truly understood this earlier in life!|`|G50ucmllaa	Most children this age cannot tell you what they did at school.  Their attention spans simply do not allow for it.  This does not mean they are learning nothing, just that the do not remember specific events.    The second half of the year tends to be the hardest.  The wishy-washy, getting used to school is over with.  Students have matured and teachers are down to business.  She may be struggling as a result.    I am a first grade teacher.  I knew this from child development but it really did not hit me as to how "in the moment" young children are until about half way through the year.  We were waiting for another class to leave the library so we could go in.  Now mind you we had had library at the same time (2:00) all year.  One of my little ones asked if we had had lunch yet.  I said "Yes, remember we had pizza"...inside my head I am thinking "I'm trying to teach this kid to read and he can't remember if he ate!"...but that is just how kids are.  They are in the moment.  They probably really did learn something, just don't remember actually being taught it.    If you have concerns about her progress talk to the teacher.  Email her, call her, etc.  She should talk to you.  If not talk to the principal.  All teachers, regardless of circumstance should talk to the parents at pretty much any time within 48 hours of contacted.
Spm9Raz9aa	yes your body shows sooner after your first pregnancy. its not that your body already knows what its doing its that your uterus has already been stretched so it doesn't have to work as hard to stretch the second time.|`|NI8D46J0aa	Yes, it's true. I am on my 5th and I think I started showing before I got the positive test. lol. I thought I was just getting thicker. Hmmm. Guess I was wrong.  Try getting those space bags for your clothes.  You vacuum seal the air out so they don't take up much space.|`|0cc5b5bbc5737c639788c13b8ae7e80daa	yes i am on my fifth baby and i look like i am 4-5 months pregnant already.... i am only 2-3 months|`|iKPSOMiSaa	yes! i had a son 15 months ago and am 13 weeks now and have started to show a little. ill probably be in maternity clothes in about 2 or 3 weeks|`|J4W68owgaa	I showed sooner with each one of my pregnancies. The muscles have stretched, your body knows what it's doing, etc.    It's not a myth sweetie.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Yes because your stomach muscles have already been stretched. For me I had a nice tight tummy when I was 18 and got pregnant and I swear you couldn't tell at all until 5 or 6 months but this one... 12 wks you could see the bump.|`|8ifHo5F3aa	Im 20 weeks and I gained 35lbs already!  so Im showing> I couldnt hide it after week 14 and my doc said I should be huge around week 30 ...  I do eat more and exercise less!...but the doc said you may enjoy it now bec ...no matter how much i eat if i dont eat enough the baby will take it from me! so im enjoyin my beatifull pregnancy!  YEAH>|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	With our first baby I was about 13 weeks when I started to show. With this pregnancy I was about 18 weeks. I think it's because I got pregnant again when AJ was only 3 months old so I hadn't burnt off all the baby fat although I was breastfeeding. I think if you've lost all the weight then you will start to show a few weeks sooner because your uterus has already been stretched.|`|d1027f6834f2f2660c8aa9290737073eaa	It certainly didn't work that way for me. I was showing way sooner with my first child than with my second child. So it varies from woman to woman.|`|kbdkOPHDaa	it was about the same with me. with my first i was smaller though so i showed faster. with my second i was a bit bigger so i actually showed a bit later.     LOL. i actually ended up having a 10 pounds child, lol. i had him in dec. and he is about 16 pounds, he is 2 months today! i was freaking miserable, lol.     so what is the story, are you already pregnant or are you trying? i was just curious cause i see you on here all the time and i wasnt sure if you were prego or not...
0rpN2419aa	Since I babysat my grand-kids, I was the one who potty trained them.  We didn't give them much much candy, preferring that they would eat healthier food.  Frustrated, I got a bag of M & M's. There were two grandchildren, one about 24 months and the other about 14 months.  I told the older, a boy, he could have one if he peed and two if he pooped.  Of course, I had to watch...you know the look they get in their eyes when they gotta go, and at other times I would just sit him on the potty.  He wanted that treat!  It didn't take a very long time.  Little sis, watching him too, wanted to sit on the potty so she could have a treat too and she was potty trained before she was two.  I know it's bribery and probably not the best thing to do, but as a grandma baby sitter, I didn't want to be changing poopy diapers on them when they were older.  I know you will get some great advice on this site.  Put all the ideas together and he will soon be potty trained.|`|m2aznd8xaa	i have a 20 month old and is fully potty trained. you have to let him have accidents in his undies.he will see how uncomfortable it feels.if you use pull ups use them only at night or when going out. they are too much like diapers and they will use them like diapers if you let them wear them all day. buy him his own potty and make him sit in it every hour .and when playing remind him everyhour if he has to go and that the potty is wherre he should go. he will eventually get tired of peeing hisself.take him shopping for his own potty and undies. buy potty books and movies. and keep the potty close. with mine i had to put on cartoons and shed sit for a few extra minutes, she fought me at first but once you make it a routine and they realize,,the pee will keep running down there legs  if they dont go to the potty.they do give in. kids like routine and hate change.so you need to turn this big change into a routine . dont give up ,dont go back to diapers .dont get discouraged. and always keep your cool. dont get upset when he has an accident let him know you know its been hard for him and that its tough work but he is doing great. it will eventually happen good luck to you. and also buy lots of stickers and little rewards and give him one when he goes. my little one has her potty covered in pretty stickers.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	On the peepee part throw cheerios in the toilet and tell him to sink them.  As for poopoo tell him to blow them up.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	You have already identified part of the issue, he needs to get out and see other kids doing it and then he will be more interested. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT force the issue, because then it will become a control issue for your son.    Is there a disney character he likes, or a TV show? Let him see the underwear for them and tell him when he can wear them and go pee in the potty he can have them. It worked for my newphew.|`|pJpk1aXFaa	i did a chart for mine, everytime he went  1 he got 1 piece of candy.  2 he gets 2. every 5 stickers, we went to the dollar store and got a prize.  when he was completely potty trained we had a "potty party" and he got with some of his friends and we went to chuckee cheese.  and let him see you go potty.  also you could try buying his favorite character underwear and if he uses the bathroom dont change him for a while.|`|wE5JMeesaa	Here are some things I've done and some things I've heard other people have done that have worked.    1.  Introduce the potty as a play thing.  Just set a potty among his toys and let him play with it, check it out, wear it on his head--get it all out of his system.  Then once he's used to it, it won't be such a hard feat to get him to sit on it and use it.    2.  100% in.  Tell him the time has come--they no longer make diapers in his size, he's just too big.  If he refuses to sit on the potty, he spends the day naked.  Let him turd on the floor--and he will be very uncomfortable.  I potty trained two girls this way.  Each time, it only took two days and four poos.  Picking up a turd off the floor for two days is well worth the success.    3.  Bribes.  Make a potty chart.  Give him real rewards.  Like--a trip with mommy to the zoo.  Or a brand new toy.  Buy the toy and put it on a shelf above the potty.  Let it be a constant reminder. Reward attempts, too.      4.  The book, "Everybody Poops." with the flushing sound.    Good luck.  I have to tell you.. three is a bit old for a stay-home child.  Usually, daycare kids take longer--and are usually trained by 3.  Home kids are usually trained by 2, 2.5.|`|BjY1iZS0aa	He may have no interest and if so then it will be impossible to train him at this point. My son was almost 4 before he was finally potty trained. I knew he could do it, and was just being stubborn. If that is the case with your son then my suggestion is to try and turn the power around a little bit. At age 3 they are just learning that they can have some power. As much as you want him to go, he realizes that he can have the 'power' by not going. With my son, I let him pick a friday in the following month and that was "no more pull up day" - we wrote it on his calender and we talked about it most nights before bed. On that morning he was excited to wear underwear. He actually did really good on day 1 and awful on day 2, but I didn't give up. I just had him help me clean up the mess, and told him how it's no more pull-ups. I had planned for a long weekend at home anyway. I would say it was a good 3 to 4 days before he just 'got it' and he has been trained ever since.     Good luck to you, I know this is one of the most frustrating times - for us and them.|`|6vC7bWfFaa	If he is just turned 3, I wouldn't worry too much about it.  It isn't uncommon for a 3 yr. old boy to not be trained yet.  My son was almost 4 before he stopped wetting his pants and started to go  2 on the potty and I'd been trying to train him since 18 months.  If he is not ready, then he is not ready.  I noticed a major difference in my son from the 3 year old that wasn't ready to be trained to the 3 1/2 year old that was.    At about 3 1/2 I became frustrated and started taking the pull-ups off while he was at home and letting him wear either pants or underpants.  Then if he had an accident he had to feel the wet.  Pull-ups and diapers wick away the wetness so the children can't tell the difference.      I also made him change himself when he had an accident and it really helped to start reading to him while he sat on the potty.  We would go sit on the potty every hour or two (make it a regular schedule) and read a short book.  If something happened he would get a sticker on his chart or a couple of M&Ms.  This worked for pee and poop.    My son has always gone to daycare so it did help to have other kids using the bathroom... maybe arrange for him to go to daycare or see if he can attend preschool in the mornings during the week.  He will get the socialization to help things along and you will get a few hours of time to get done what you need to.|`|8CPH9l0vaa	If there is one thing ive learned about potty training, it's that it can NOT be forced on the child. They have to be the ones to make up their minds about using the potty. He will come around soon enough. Just be patient. I promise.
AA11763588	Your boyfriend is a liar. He only wanted to have unprotected sex because he doesn't like what it feels like with a condom on.    You can get pregnant that way, and you can catch an STD that way.    If you want to have sex with him again, make him wear a condom if he refuses don't give in. When he leaves you, you'll know it was just for the sex.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    yes there is a posible chance that you could be,  since sex occured.  Always use protection. i know you didnt think of it at the time. but boyfriend could have std;s or infection that is passed through fluids that he doesnt know about.  you need to test if period is a no show or odd.    god bless x|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	yea you could be dont be stupid and let that guy tell you its ok since your together. if you are pregnant then looks like its time to grow up, if your not "no glove no love" dont have sex protected or unprotected unless you wanna be a mommy.    ABORTION IS NOT A FORM OF BIRTH CONTROL    you chose to have sex  you chose to have sex without a condom  dont punish a little life for your STUPID choices      oh and by the way the "pull out method dose not work"  and he didnt pull out all the way  condoms and birth control dont always work im pregnant now and i was on birth control (im 17) and i used a condom as well =) NOTHING IS 100%    although my situation is different cause im done school done college have a career and my own house, you need to grow up!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Your boyfriend used you and lied to you. Having unprotected sex not only risks you for pregnancy,but STD's as well. Go to the doctor and get checked out!|`|zIoWCX7vaa	yes i do|`|yipMDefBaa	you have a 50/50 chance of being pregnant.  secondly you also have a good chance of ending up with an STD.  Not using a condom because we are together is the stupidest thing I have ever heard.  Sure he might not being playing around with others now, but he might have in the past.    Don't panic.  Go and see your DR or go to a clinic and ask about your options.  I am not sure if you have to take an adult because you are 14.    If he really loves you or is that in to you he will wait for sex.  14 is to young.  Have sex when you are ready.  If he uses the line if you really liked me or all the other girls are doing it then dump him and find a better boyfriend|`|hGxKx2XSaa	theres a good chance you are. even if he didnt c.u.m, you can still get pregnant from prec.u.m. theres sperm in that too. i think youre pregnant.. and im not just tring to scare you..|`|7xit1ogxaa	Anytime you have unprotected sex you run the risk of becoming pregnant and contracting STDs. It doesn't matter how long it was for, or whether he pulled out or not. Pre-ejaculate contains sperm. If you miss your period then you need to take a test. It would also be a good idea to get tested for STDs.. If you aren't ready for the consequences, you really shouldn't be engaging in adult activities.|`|vrt8bMzVaa	sucker...well maybe not if you were don't guess you would be in this situation|`|qbMCd2myaa	Well don't stress about it. Stress can also make your period come late. I cant tell you how many times I stressed over being pregnant, then took a test, it'd be negative, then i'd get my period the next day. Stay calm and don't think the worst. It was a mistake for you to have sex ESPECIALLY UNPROTECTED!!! as such an early age. But, now you know the consequences and I'm sure you'll think twice. As for your boyfriend, he's an idiot. Just because you are together doesn't mean unprotected sex is okay. It's never okay unless you are committed and WANT a baby.|`|EhtANbIYaa	there's always a possibility, especially without protection|`|bO1gUExAaa	If you have unprotected sex  you can get pregnant.  You can also get aids, herpes, syphillis, genital warts, etc.  I would go to the doctor or local health department just to be checked for STD's and infections, and a pregnancy test.  If you don't want to disapoint your parents by getting pregnant don't have sex.  You are 14 you have the rest of your life to worry about that stuff, what are you gonna do with a baby in Jr. High?  and how would you feel having to tell your boyfriends for the rest of your life you have an STD so precautions can be taken not to pass it on to them?

HBgnkltfaa	Matthias Elliot is wonderful.  I also would like Matthias Avery or Matthias Harper.  Since Matthias and Christopher are undeniably masculine but the the other three names (Elliot, Avery, and Harper) have been used on girls, I would recommend including either Matthias or Christopher in your final combination so it's obvious that it's a boys' name.      Evelyn Rose is pretty, but it feels so predictable.  It's actually my husband's aunt's name.  If you use the old-fashioned Evelyn, I recommend pairing it with something a little fresher and less predictable.  If you use Rose, I love the idea of putting it in the first-name slot or pairing it with an uncommon first name.  Other ideas:    Evelyn Aurora  Caroline Aurora (I adore Caroline)  Norah Caroline  Audrey Caroline  Evangeline Rose  Rose Caroline    Good luck, and I hope this helps!|`|VHHis05Naa	I love both names!

For Mathias Elliot, there are a few extra syllables when saying it with the middle name.

96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	Go by the longest period (40 days). Your body is still readjusting; right now your shortest is 34 days, average 37 days, longest 40. So test by your longest so far; I would even wait a couple of days after just to make sure. So going by January 2nd, I'd say don't test until at least Friday, February 20th. That will give you 49 days since your last menstrual period, 9 days over your longest period and plenty of time for AF to show if she's going to. Good luck!|`|kwMA5I1iaa	If I were you, I'd wait 40 days from your last period since that is the longest so far. If you haven't seen AF around the middle/end of next week, take a test.    Good luck!!|`|YMf78Qteaa	I've been off the pill December 20th, and had irregular periods while i was on it, considering the doctors changed the type of pills 3 diff. times in 4 months. Now that I've been off the pills it's still a little irregular but slowly going back to what it used to be before i was on the pills. Strangely enough, my bleeding only lasted about 3 days with that nasty brown sht 1 day afterwards. I hate my periods come whenever they feels like it....every 25, 28 days. One time i didn't have my period for 2 months!! thought i was preg, scared me so much. i couldn't take a test either. turns out it was stress, but i didn't think so...life was going good i thought. well, i probably didn't answer yer question, but i hope sharing my story was helpful anyway.

xzh8r0jIaa	YES, BUT NO MORE THAN 3 CANS A WEEK|`|1CgSVXxXaa	we discussed this in my prenatal care class. Strangely enough the best type of tuna to eat would be the cheaper brands. The more expensive brands contain a higher level of mercury which can be harmful towards fetal brain development. The reason why is they "better" brands of tuna are cut from the larger tuna, and the larger the tuna, the longer they have lived in the ocean. The longer they live in the ocean, the higher their mercury levels become. Since the cheaper brands of canned tuna are made from smaller fish, the mercury levels are lower and it's more safe to consume.|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	i read its ok to eat it like once a month  not often|`|apUkTo3maa	I HEARD IT WASNT OKAY BUT I ALWAYS ATE IT WHEN I WAS PREGO WITH MY SON.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	You an eat it, just not all the time! Most things are okay in moderation.     Here's a list describing the mercury levels/ consumption guidelines:    http://www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnan...    Also, don't stop eating fish altogether just because you are confused on how much/often to eat it. It's full of DHA/Omega-3s which help your baby's brain and eyes develop. :)|`|X2EPEEwbaa	I was told I could eat it, but no more than one can per week, because of the potentially high mercury levels.|`|FNjUT8n4aa	im not sure, but it was ok when i had it my whole pregnancy. had a perfect pregnancy and a perfect healthy girl. i think its mainly sushi kind of fish stuff thats prob better to stay away from, idk.|`|LClV32Vvaa	I believe that the albacore is what is bad for you while pregnant.

My midwife gave me a list, but here is what WebMD said about it:  Most fish, in limitation, are safe in pregnancy and should be part of your regular, balanced diet. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning that four types of fish should not be eaten in pregnancy (and also while nursing) because they could contain enough mercury to damage a fetal brain. Mercury enters the environment naturally and through industrial pollution. Nearly all fish contain trace amounts of methylmercury, but longer-lived, larger fish that feed on other fish, such as shark or swordfish, accumulate the highest amounts of methylmercury and pose the greatest threat to people who eat them regularly.    The fish that should not be eaten during pregnancy, according to the FDA, include:    Shark  Swordfish  King mackerel  Tilefish  Women who had swordfish for dinner last night shouldn't panic, stresses FDA food chief Joseph Levitt in an advisory. The risk comes from mercury building up, not a single meal. "It is not a one-dose problem. They should just simply stop eating it from this time forward," Levitt says. "We want to empower women to protect the health of their unborn child, and the best way they can do that here is to avoid eating those four kinds of fish."      Tuna steak is not on this list, nor is canned tuna. Some states, however, have urged pregnant women to limit canned tuna consumption to 7 ounces a week. "You can safely eat 12 ounces per week of cooked fish," the FDA advisory states. "You can choose shellfish, canned fish, smaller ocean fish, or farm-raised fish -- just pick a variety of different species."      In addition, you may want to avoid prepared fish salads and smoked fish because of the increased risk of listeriosis infection.|`|tClYrQ1vaa	Tuna is perfectly okay. Although it is not recommended to eat more than 6 oz. of canned tuna per week... If you are still too scared, try eating at least after your third month of pregnancy as those months are the most critical in the baby's growth. Many fish contain higher amounts of mercury so please be careful.|`|O4JuH8zmaa	Chunk-light tuna is okay but no more than a couple servings a week. Stay away from Albacore. The types of fish you want to stay away from are actually the ones you probably wouldn't normally eat anyway, like shark, king maceral, swordfish, etc. babycenter.com will have a more complete list.|`|wFe7L1XJaa	Try visiting babycenter.com and they will tell you what is and isnt ok|`|yVAdjc6caa	You are allowed to have 6 oz. of fish/seafood a week. That is one can of tuna.|`|OM1zJPFtaa	I asked my doctor the same question, and she said that I could have one serving of tuna a week. Do not eat Shark, Swordfish, King Mackerel, or Tilefish because they contain high levels of mercury.   Five of the most commonly eaten fish that are low in mercury are shrimp, canned light tuna, salmon, pollock, and catfish.   Another commonly eaten fish, albacore ("white") tuna has more mercury than canned light tuna. Hope this helps.|`|PfYcKQHLaa	Hi    Tuna has a high mercury content - when eaten in major consumption will affect baby's nervous system..  I think the limit is 3 or 4 cans a week..Who eats this much anyway??  A tuna sandwich a week is fine....  See babycentre.co.uk

fkBZxZvCaa	I don't have children yet.      However, most people in general tend to be "harsh critics" and "very judgemental".      That's life...people don't know how to mind their own business.   We live in a society where everyone is critical of the next person.          I encounter people like this on a daily basis and I'm not a mom.   You will always encounter people who are rude, opinionated, and unkind.    Don't pay attention to what anyone says.      Parents have different methods...do what feels right in your case.   There will always be people who disagree.    That is not your problem.   Worry about raising a happy, healthy kid with love.|`|FdQD8H3qaa	My sister-in-law is really into reading everything new that the "experts" are saying and feels the need to be always telling me what is best for my son... I partly think that she is doing it to "help" but mostly I know it's because she is a sh!t disturber...  I just kinda say thanks and just ignore most of it!  If she wants to ask permission to do anything for her kid then all the power to her but I am the mother and don't feel the need to call my Dr. 100 times a day....|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I notice that a lot too, but in my home life, I plan to breastfeed and everybody keeps telling me "good luck" and "its harder than it looks!"....and when i told my mom I'm going to make my own baby food, she says "yeah right, you won't follow through, its too easy to just buy it"....geez louise!|`|GDLarTUTaa	I don't know if you have children of your own but don't feel the need to question your parenting skills just because some self-proclaimed "expert" makes an offhand remark.  That doesn't mean you can't consider a suggestion but, as you say, there's no blueprint for raising a child.  Most would agree that if your child is happy and kind hearted then you're doing something right.

The day I quit smoking. I lit up, felt nauseous, and didn't pick them up again. 2 months later I found out I was pregnant. After that though, I didn't get sick...my husband did. When I felt nauseous, he threw up and I felt better. Don't know why, and I still feel kinda bad for him! LOL
VHHis05Naa	I'd straight out tell them that you had the big V and that you and your wife are very happy being a family of two.  I have a ton of respect for you, since you admit you would resent kids.

Good for you and I wish you and your wife a life of happiness.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Tell your parents nicely if possible that you have decided not to bring kids into this world.

They grew up believing that is what all married couples desire. They really can't help how they feel. Just tell them the truth, you and yours do not want kids and there never will be kids. I am sure it will bear repeating and repeating.|`|wZAeBisbaa	Why not just tell them that you and your wife enjoy being child free and feel you can lead a fulfilling life without children?      I already have a grandchild, and it is even more wonderful than I imagined.  If my kids chose not to give me any more grandchildren, I would be disappointed, I suppose. Not so much for myself, but because I would love for my children to experience the joys and rewards of parenthood.   But it's their life.  I would respect whatever decision makes them happy.|`|JDxpjT34aa	I think its sad that they think the only reason people get married is to have kids, what does that say about their feelings on love itself? It sounds like you need to sit down and have a talk with them about how you don't think it's appropriate for them to keep pushing the subject. If you and your wife choose to not to have children that's your choice, not theirs. Perhaps if you make it very clear that it's not that you don't have children yet, but that you plan never to have children and that you've been "fixed' to make sure it never happens they'll leave you alone about it. On the other hand, if they want grandchildren they're going to have a hard time with that but it's better to tell them than to let them keep hoping for something that will never happen.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Tell them to STFU|`|e63078da611dd632e9be5b8ddb768a5aaa	Thank you for not bringing people into this world that you do not want.

Its your choice not theirs.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Just tell them the truth, mom, dad, I am too self involved to be a father. I think you should just put it out there as it is, why sugar coat it?

I'm just kidding... tell they your sterile or something, or you could grow up, be an adult and tell them you have been "fixed".|`|GIqACtxvaa	Tell them the truth. You'll probably tell them eventually one day so why not just get it over with.  It will be hard I'm sure for your Mother especially but the sooner they know the sooner the"healing" can start for your parents.      It really does have to be tough for them that they will never have Grandchildren from you,  so try to be understanding.  Everyone is entitled to their own destination and they will just have to except your decision.    Lots fo Luck!  :)|`|Ki0uUdwOaa	It is your choice and your life.  They are the ones with the problem, not you.  I think every parent always dreams of this perfect life for their kids that they are going to be a part of, I know I do that when I imagine my 5 yr old growing up.  I am already imagining spoiling grandkids and having a daughter in law that I love and has coffee with me once a week lol!    Those are my dreams for him, not his dreams for himself.  As long as he doesnt end up a serial killer, or end up doing things that may harm himself or others, I am ready to accept whatever lifestyle he chooses.|`|jcdey9cgaa	I would be honest and thel them that you and your wife choose not to have children and that you have been "fixed."  Maybe once they know it isn't possible they will leave you alone about it.  Let them know that you appreciate the fact that they care so much however, this is your choice and it is how it going to be weather they accept it or not.  I will be fine if my children never have kids as long as they are happy and not depending on me to take care of them.  If they get married and get a job and thier own house I will be happy!lol|`|796de2a4227333484ebac3deccc1937eaa	You simply say, "I had a vasectomy." That will end the "why no kids?" questions pretty quickly.    Brit
3CVfUiiJaa	I actually took 3 different brands over to the pharmacist months ago and asked him what the difference was.

I continue to buy Tylenol brand because my son doesn't like the taste of any other brands(of course lol) but you can definitely feel safe in purchasing the no name/cheaper brands.  They will work the same.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	generics are fine! i am a registered nurse and all we buy are the generics; the only diff is one may use a diff color or inactive ingredient, but unless ur child is allergic to it , which is very rare, generics are just as good, just cheaper bc they dont carry the brand name....we also use generics whenever they are available for prescription drugs...same thing...|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	same they are more than likely made at the same place also one for the rich and on For the poor they do that with alot of things saw it on a show once|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	Yes it does.

Please dont judge everyone the same because of bad stereotypes.     Me and my partner have been together for 4 years now and engaged for 2 we plan on getting married in 2011, he works 2 jobs and I am still on maternity leave from my work. We have our own home, own car, pay our own bills and taxes like many other hard working families.    I had amazing parents .. I couldnt of wanted for anything better so its not "bad parenting" My mum had an awful upbringing and she is a fantastic mum.     I dont feel I missed out on anything by having a child young, I feel more like I have gained something, we are great parents IMHO, our son is amazing and I wouldnt change him for the world. I still live my life, I dont want to be out partying anyway .. Im the happiest Ive ever been. I am also going to college next year to do access to nursing and hope to be a midwife. If I hadnt of had my son I would have no drive to do anything beyond what I am doing now (retail assistant) but now I want a career for him.    Yes I do agree that there are too many unplanned pregnancies to 14-15 year olds that are still too immature to be parents, but many do a damn good job. I think its a sad world when "children" feel the need to get pregnant to some loser who wont stick around because they want something to love etc Its such a shame.    It is not about age it is about the individual person, some people will still act childish at 30 .. Children are a blessing and shouldnt be used as some sort of commodity at any age not just teen parents.    Anyway my rant is over ..

I asked a Danish friend about why it doesn't seem to happen over there.  She said it's becuase talking about sex is so much more part of the normal everyday conversation that there is no taboo and if a young girl hears about it and birth control, she thinks "I had better go on the pill".    She says that over there people regard teenagers who get pregnant as rather stupid.  Why weren't they on the pill that everyone talks about?|`|TL6c0Ntcaa	I suppose life like drama's on television (Days of our Lives, Neighbours, Home and Away) may influence young girls to thinking that all will be ok when I have a kid, also, that almighty baby bonus that the Government pays out may give these young women the ok status. Unfortunately we have kids having kids these days without any real prospect of marriage or long term relationships. We live in an illegitimate world today. Nothing seems to be real anymore.   I believe there is to much emphasis on sex and the peer pressure that amounts from the kids comparing notes with whom they have had sex with and it isn't one, it is how many. Yep, I feel sorry for the naivety of these young people that say its ok to have sex with someone or anyone, fall pregnant and the rest is history.  Still, it makes me wonder, where are the parents of these kids. Support your children but don't condone stupid and irrational decisions that can eventually take away a lifetime.Being a parent is for life, not for a fun moment.|`|Gqtw683Waa	Hey,     I think your being to rude and making it seem like every young mum is the same.. yeah there are kids that go out and get pregnant but surely instead of criticising them you should support them, whats the point in making them feel bad about their decision when its actually none of your business.   I am a young mum i am 19 with a 14 month old and geuss what no i dont live off the government but i still get judged for being young and no1 really no's who I am. I have a house i pay for .. looking to get a mortgage and a new car that i pay for and run, and also look after my child.. and geuss what i do it all by myself, so just because there are young mums around we arnt all the same and you are judging every young mum to be the same in this qeustion and it is unfair.   support them for making that choice dont put them down about it as would you rather then they give up on their child?     Stop judging and think about yourselves and not others, there are kids living off the council but your never gonna stop it so maybe you should try and help it instead.|`|Lg3SNqW2aa	I don't understand it either, I'm almost 20 years old and I couldnt even contemplate having a child for at least another 5+ years but I guess it's everyones own choice.  Myself, I'd much rather wait to be in a stable long term relationship be financially stable and have lived my life a little.    For some people children have become like fashion accessories.|`|69DjSUVAaa	I think young single Mum's are given too much from the government these days i have heard some young girls say 'i am going to have a baby whilst young so i can get a house from the council' So ambitious.    Yet Mums like myself 29, happily married, have a mortgage, my own car and a good job, the government think you can manage when losing one salary! It is a joke, you spend your working life paying your tax and ni to be treated like this, yet someone who has never worked and come straight out of school is offered anything and everything.    Perhaps Gordon Brown should reduce the benefits for young single mums to encourage them to go get a job and build themselves a life before having a baby at the governments expense.    Sorry for the rant, just really gets to me, when i think i may have to go back to work early as i can not afford to stay off work for much longer yet these silly young girls don't EVER have to work and gets to spend as much time as they want with there children.   x|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Because they are young and dont understand how to have safe sex. Or they dont realize the consequences of sex.|`|84crzC80aa	Well they had bad parents I guess.|`|DHyUnhS1aa	It is cheaper and easier.  The parents of most underage pregnant teens allow the teens to mooch off them.  And it is easy for the teen to just dump the kid with their parents if they get bored with it considering most (not all) underage kids still live with their parents.|`|4kX61Y97aa	is it not the schools they go to fault for the lack of sex ed?? if they learned more about the situation they might think before considering under age sex. it may also not be the parents fault for this. when i was in year 8 (12 yrs old) a girl same age was pgregnant. and to be honest my school we had one lesson of sex ed and that was it.  some girls regret and some say it was the best thing they did. but just because they have a child doesnt mean to say they cant get back to having education. alot of girls go back to school/college.
vrt8bMzVaa	I wouldn't worry about it most time people are jealous.People have give me a hard time about my weight all my life I was 5'7 and weighed 94lbs up till I was almost 30 now I weigh 125lbs.people are mean they don't seem to realize that it is just as insulting to talk about thin people as it is to talk about fat ones.Just like the saying a big puff of wind would blow you away they don't see as an insult but walk up to fat *** and say your so fat if you fell down you would rock yourself to sleep before you could get up,and that's unacceptable.Don't let people get you down most of them would kill to be like you.|`|MigBOiUPaa	yea sound rly rly thin. theres this girl tht goes to my school who is like 100 pounds and she walks around thinkin shes all cute but everyone thinks she looks so nasty cuz she is wayy to skinny! and she doesnt eat.      it wont hurt u to gain 5 maybe 10 pounds so u look a little healtier!  good luck!|`|fxxLgQrdaa	ru a guy or a girl? drink some protein shakes and start eating fast foods but balance it out by working out and exercising|`|aSuLnvoSaa	Yes you are.      Try eating, five meals a day till you are full.      if that doesn't help, then you will have to live with it. you must have a mega metabolism|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	You seem a little on the skinny side, wich isnt bad... meat up a little.|`|AmqQ9it5aa	Everyone's body is different you have a leaner body type.    Skinny doesn't mean eating disorder. I hate that mindset people have.      I am obese ,but I will never talk about someone being too thin. I know it hurts just as much as being called too fat.|`|Qe9y6MnTaa	I would just eat a little more, to fill you out a little. Not because people say you're skinny, but because I think you're TOO skinny, as in unhealthy. I hope this helps :D good luck|`|RAgWVuu4aa	That is really thin...I can't see you, so I can't say...Different body shapes, different weights...    I would recommend that you go to your doctor to get that checked out...Even if you eat healthy, you could have some problem or a metabolism that's too fast...Haha...    Yeah...Just keep saying that you don't...The truth is the truth, even if they don't believe you...|`|nCwp355Naa	Yes, but you seem to be doing everything right, except....3 meals, should be the biggest (not BIG, but the largest of them all)  then, 2 snacks,  but remember its your metabolism, and you cant really help that =/  but dont listen to people anyways|`|61WM2dcAaa	Yucky.      Please eat some more.|`|xZvzLztZaa	You're fine. When i was in 10th grade I went out with a girl that was 16, 5'3, 85 lbs. She ate more than most people and never gained a pound - she had a hyperactive thyroid and a really high metabolism.    Which was kinda ironic because I have a very slow metabolism and I'm tall and heavier.    But you can talk to your doctor if you want but it's probably just you, and there's nothing wrong with it.    Hope that helps =)  Micah|`|vdPTAxmDaa	lose some weight tubby.|`|QdXi0mvXaa	are you single? cause i always wanted to bone a skeleton.
aWkp6AJOaa	i kinda like it.  it's very unique.  people wouldn't like it if wanted to name your baby something normal like david or michael.  you should name your baby whatever you like.|`|Elxuvon8aa	sounds like a juggler first and last name so I would veto it|`|doLyOac0aa	Awful!|`|GAj9hwWvaa	Sounds like a carnival performer...a little over the top!|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Is there a nice European last name to go with it?  Then I think this name is brilliant.  It will tie the child to his heritage for all his life.    TX Mom|`|4fIE3Eb2aa	It reminds me of Prince Caspian. I don't like it!  I love the name Landon or Jude for a boy.|`|SaHt5GXeaa	I LOVE IT.|`|MO2H26XOaa	if you guys like it then go for it..but if you want an HONEST opinion...no, i dont think its very good.|`|PGUAzLclaa	To long don't you think! I would try in the range of that name Alex or Alec something like that. You are welcome bye.|`|Qlx1r9XSaa	Don't like it, sorry.|`|hyN684hxaa	Sounds too fancy, like a fictional character who's like an I dunno, a pimp who fights crime on a magic carpet in Madrid.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	It's a little dated. I'd say ditch one or the other, both is too much!|`|qa4gjD52aa	sounds kinda dancrish
5DB6nOXkaa	I would definately wait, especially until your first son is more independent. If you are thinking about going back to school, take that into consideration, you probably won't be able to with another child.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I would wait. I wouldn't want to,because I am naturally a very stubborn person and it would be hard. I understand wanting another baby and wanting to have a big full family. But the reality is,your life just isn't prepared for it now. A two-bed room apartment,might be able to swing it until he's one,with the space issue. But with that you still don't have a lot of other money put aside for this. Not to mention since you only have two periods a year,on your own? Or is that with medication? If it is without,you most likely would need something to help you get pregnant. And that does cost a lot of money.   I think once your husband gets a job with his masters degree,that will help considerably. And then I think it would be a safe bet to try then. For right now. Weigh your options with your doctor. And go ahead and start your prenatal vitamins & folic acid.|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	I would wait to have another child, and focus on yourself, go to school learn more about yourself, enjoy life with your child you have now, then after your done school, your working, your husband is working and when you are more settled in life, then have another child.|`|kwMA5I1iaa	Is there any way to cut something out of your budget for a while so that you can put that into savings for having another child? Like cable tv or something? It won't be much, but anything will help. The last thing you want is to have another child and not be able to support them or put food on the table.     List the pros and cons of another baby right now. See if you can cut some things out of your budget for a while. That way you can determine if it's the right time.|`|ELeOcIsdaa	you also have to think that if you get preg. it takes 9 mts.  so if your son is really close to doing something don't think that you have to wait for him to do those things cuz it'll take a little bit for the new one to come.  I to am in a 2 bedroom and its a great size for one but with all the baby stuff back in place it is going to feel really small.  I'm a stay at home mom and the clutter gets to me everyday.  I know this cuz i went and had another one.  i cant wait to get rid of the crib.  anyway, I accual advise to you is if it's not in your budget wait.  Things have gotten more expensive in the last 3 years.  my oldest is 3 also.  I'd wait if $$ is a big factor.  cuz if you do have another one you are going to get stressed out about it.  Take some time and talk it over seriously with your hubby and Pray about it.|`|zLoyo24Taa	If you decide your going to have another, I would prepare your little guy ahead of time. I would start with social stories and perhaps doll play. It will be hard to explain all the changes that are going to happen, but the better prepared he is the happier he will be.
kj1md6t0aa	I was so scared to have my own up until I actually had him. In the hospital, I had a c-section and only saw him once before I was in the recovery room and he was a few hours old before I got to hold him .. and as soon as I did, mother-mode kicked in and all my fears of being a mother went away. HOWEVER - the fears of being a GOOD mother, being scared for your child all the time, etc., don't ever go away. Good luck, relax, and have one if you want to! :)|`|GUEsVdaFaa	You don't... you just get pregnant and deal with it. When it comes time for the baby to come out you'll be ready and over your fear. If you're not, then you'd better hurry it up because that baby won't stay there forever.|`|Jo3Ma2NOaa	its normal for people to fear having kids of there own because they wonder what kind of mother theyre gonna be and how they are gonna take care of them....the fear will subside when youre more ready to have kids....|`|aJLx0nhNaa	You mean you're afraid of having kids, even though you like them?    In my experience, you don't.  You're still afraid.  And then there they are, somehow, and it's different.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	nope i didnt|`|ElBIeRFNaa	i was TERRIFIED of being a mom.  when I was about 38 weeks pregnant, i was like, "I can't do this, I can't do this".  but you know what?  my daughter is almost 3 years old, and i CAN do this.  she's the best part of me.  sure it's tough...especially when she's throwing a tantrum or being a brat, but she's a great kid for the most part, and i make sure i hug her & cuddle & kiss her every day & ALWAYS tell her i love her.  that makes it easier for me.  i'm sooo madly in love with my daughter...that the fear kind of goes away.  when she says, "i love you mom" and when i pick her up from daycare, and she sees me & comes RUNNING down the hall calling, "MOMMY!"...THAT is how i know it's all worth it!|`|h4R4Txjvaa	Why are you afraid? And if you do become pregnant it can sometimes cause those feelings to go away...|`|xq7S9H5Raa	It's one of these things that you have to face heads on.  You just do it.  Initially you may be fearful, but with each day you will find yourself dealing with it a little bit better.  Your family and friends can be a great source of support.
VLr3jrutaa	The only reason i took a pregnancy test was because i was crying over literally nothing. I was sitting there watching the TV with my boyfriend and i just started crying. He said why are you crying??? i said i don't know. He said i bet your pregnant. Went and got a test and bobs your uncle. My son is now 22 months.  Hope this helps and congratulations if you are.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Yep, I've been a crybaby the whole time...mostly in the beginning and I'm starting to get worse now at 37 weeks|`|xq7S9H5Raa	i am also feeling very emotional.  You are not alone.
7rKUmK0qaa	when was the first day of your last period?  On my first son i didnt get a positive test result till 2 months later because i had a low HCG in my blood. Try to wait a wk or 2 or you can go for a blood test to make sure..    Goodluck|`|Fq7FHQ44aa	yes the test can be wrong.. these tests detect the presence of hcg (human chorionic gonadotropin) in the urine. hCG is a hormone released by the placenta right after the embryo begins implanting into the uterine lining, about one week after fertilization and ovulation.    Early pregnancy, the level is low but it increases almost double in around 48 hrs. I'll suggest u should wait for couple of days and do it again. and this time do it with first (morning) urine. the urine is not diluted and high in concentration of hcg at that time..    best of luck!|`|7kGwZ1Ntaa	You're in the same boat as me. Except I'm not 25, but most of the answers I got were you're pregnant or go to the doctor. So maybe we both just need to make some appointments! =D|`|oUFZPljBaa	wow its nice to know somebody out there is in the same boat as me....the only thing is im not 25 nor am i a 15 year old girl.  And also i don have the sore breasts.  But all i can tell you is to go ahead and make the doctors appointment that's the best way to tell.|`|Wh6DvhE6aa	See your GP for a better result.  I used to take the home pregnancy tests in the morning (1st pee of the day) - its more concentrated.  When I was trying to fall pregnant, I looked into things too much and would've sworn black and blue that I was pregnant when I wasn't.  What my GP told me is that negative tests can (maybe, but not often be wrong) but when they are positive, they are correct.  Do them as often as you want, but it may be cheaper going to the docs.  Signs:  everyone is different.  I used to get sore boobs even when I wasnt pregnant - I was just ovulating.|`|jC1Mdsefaa	Try testing with the morning urine or you could always go to the doc and get a blood test..  If it is negative, ask the doc what is the deal!|`|JdyRdLwVaa	yes its possible it could be wrong.You could be pregnant and there may  just not be enough pregnancy hormones in your system yet to show up on an home test.They say to wait another week and then take another one.Have you already missed you period?|`|bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	Wait and Take another one, Or go to doc and have a blood test done.|`|97JwSvUzaa	How late are you on my period? I would get another test, one that can sense pretty sensitive hormone levels (like First Response or Clear Blue). You should wait a day or 2 and test again first thing in the morning (thats the time of day that your urine will be the least diluted).     Good luck!
r07BwhO1aa	I wish I could give your mom a HUGE thumbs up!!    If you want to act like a baby, then she should treat you like one.      I know you wanted some support here but sorry hun. you get none because you were talking back.      You know you should not talk back so just don't do it.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	Hmmm... My guess would be that the best way to get her to stop would be for you to stop talking back.  I'm sure that's not what you wanted to hear, but them's the breaks.  Her threats are an attempt to get you to change your behavior.  The punishment needs to be bad enough for you not to do the behavior again.  If the idea of getting spanked in front of your friends is heinous enough to get you to stop, then I guess it worked.  Chill out, don't talk back, and everything will be fine.  And don't forget that your mom was a kid once too, and she knows what you are going through.  And on a scarier note, she also knows which threats will embarrass you into behaving as well.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	I think if your immature enough to backtalk to your mother then her threats are perfect for you. If you just stop back talking the embarrassing threats will stop. its as simple as that.|`|AJ38Xqyeaa	stop pushin her buttons or really tell her how you feel about those threats|`|jcdey9cgaa	The question was how do you get your mom to stop making these threat?  Stop back talking and doing things you at 15 should know better than doing!!!!!!  If you act like you are supposed to she won't have to embarrass you.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Same Troll, Different Name...|`|557274b151a9fd878998646fbecf57b3aa	So... you're disrespecting your Mom in front of friends. Guess what! You're embarrassing HER, so she's just giving you a little of it back. Be respectful, and you shouldn't have any more problems with this kind of thing--and a much better relationship with your Mom. :)|`|rid4brOnaa	The ONLY thing that I disagree with concerning your mother's threat is that is would not be done in private. However, a bare bottom paddling that leaves your bottom that red would certainly be noisy. The smacks and your yelps wouldn't leave too much to the imagination. She should follow through and paddle you the very next time you sass her. You've been warned. Learn to respect your mom.
bcZSIphUaa	Possible but no clear signs pointing either way YET.    Be patient and remembet that if you are fertile then you have 25% chance of conceiving each month.|`|mgiJVjaKaa	I believe the doctor would have needed to do an ultrasound to see if you're pregnant that early on.    The being really tired is definitely a symptom, and people can get pregnant first month off birth control (I know of several). Wait until the first week of February, if you have a normal 28 day cycle, and take a pregnancy test if you  haven't had your period.     Good luck!|`|2791882f90477b9699ca0a79e64b57caaa	I think it's pretty rare that you would conceive your first month off birth control but it's definitely possible. You have roughly a 20-25% chance of getting pregnant each month if you have perfect timing with intercourse and ovulation. I don't know that your Dr. would have been able to tell if you were pregnant.   Take a pregnancy test!|`|o1yy6KABaa	yes they can tell if you are pregnant by doing a physical exam - im sure he would have mentioned during it if he had noticed any changes or definite signs of pregnancy  Take a test to be sure.

54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	That is normal it is just your uterus stretching and the baby growing and making room for itself. I think what your feeling is normal though I had the same pains.|`|1UAuRQtfaa	i would mention is to your doctor but it is probably nothing i think i may have had a similar pain when i was prego!!!|`|IYLlupdkaa	its ok; Im pretty sure its the stretching of ligaments/muscles|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	I am 20 weeks pregnant and the same is happening to me.  I read on baby center it is very normal.|`|qX8EFFVtaa	You are probably just stretching.  When you get a little farther along, you'll be able to see that little line.  It'll get darker.  This is very normal, don't worry.|`|nJSVwAxMaa	im a dude but arent those things contractions or sumthin?|`|HcMvtMT7aa	Normal!  It could be that baby is pressing against that area.  It'll subside as your uterus grows.|`|YspTfI8Faa	call your doctor...but when I was having those little pains I found out  that its just my baby kicking and punching|`|57dcd8c9cd435a421ee284618e113a81aa	When it was pregnant I always had weird pains and I was always so itchy! ? Now that I gave birth things are going back to normal!|`|SWQyuVzGaa	i am 20 weeks prego and its happening to me too but i am not showing really at all an my doc said ill be popping soon because those are just stretching adn growing pains and they are very normal!|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	should be fine ask doc to be sure maybe because baby is getting bigger
Uy8ntukjaa	Well if you guys are friends I don't see why you wouldn't want to go to the dance with him. Lots of people go to dances with friends. Just tell him that you wanted to be sure he understood that you were going with him as a friend and that you hope there will be no hard feelings should you dance with other guys too. It's quite mean to back out on him. Just go and have fun.|`|QSG4yUQyaa	Ok well first of all I am sure I was this guy at one point or another a few times. I asked this girl to go with me just because she was pretty cool. Not in the popular kind of way, but she just seemed like I would have a lot of fun going with her. Well we went... she had no idea I was going to ask her by the way... and we had a great time. Funny story is... we have been dating for two years now and always look back and laugh. So basically, establish that your going as friends and that your going to dance with everyone. Who knows maybe this kid will prove himself to be pretty alright.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	He knows you don't like him that way more than likely. But sometimes going with friends is better than going alone.|`|AmqQ9it5aa	Just tell him you will go as friends. What harm will it do. Your not getting married it's one dance.
5Q8vMxuqaa	Hmm yea well you definitely gotta set him straight, seems like he might have feelings for you. Trust me the sooner the better before he starts getting too "prepared" for going to the dance with you. Just honestly let him know that you were caught off guard or you haven't had a girls night out in a while, and decided to go with your friends. It's best to be honest though so he won't think your making up excuses..just let him you had to much on your mind and it's been a busy week, let him know he's a nice guy (if that's true) and just that you'd rather go with your friends. hope that helped :) good luck.|`|gpON465Iaa	Tell him you would like to go with someone else and still be friends, maybe meet him there and dance or just hang out for a while because a freind in need is a friend indeed.  You just do not know what may happen, maybe introduce him to one of your friends or fall in love in the long run or maybe he will die and you would feel awful about it.|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	Tell him that you are sorry but and that you have changed your mind and would rather go with someone else or something like "Were already such good friends, I would rather go with someone I could get to know" say something that wont hurt his feelings.|`|Qe9y6MnTaa	Just tell him you're really sorry, but you were caught of guard when you said you would go. (REALLY nicely) and tell him that I still really want to be your friend(if you do) and say that I'll save a dance for you at the dance or something :D lol hope this helps|`|CbzP5Yegaa	You could just get out of it as easily and stupidly as you've gotten into it and just ditch him. Or you could be compassionate this time and explain to him exactly what happened.|`|l2mJxB1Caa	go with him, it would probably break his heart for you to break the date. next time think before you speak.|`|ccU5FNsmaa	jus dont go say you have a lot of reports to or something. just go home|`|EgsuMGLPaa	hahahahhaa this happened to me freshman year.    I just went with the girl because i felt bad.    good luck in your situation, i didn't have the heart(or lack thereof) to dump her :(|`|90xO7lpGaa	classic case of "something came up"    get "sick"  get a flat tire   have some unavoidable meeting to get to  say you got dragged in to bake cookies at somewhere  say you have to call bingo that day  have someone call and just fake conversation with them and then leave for the "emergency"  ..     then dont show up and ignore further advances|`|k9SrzQQgaa	Do you plan on going with someone else? To be honest, it would be harsh to ditch the guy who asked you for someone else.    If you really don't want to go with this guy, tell him you don't feel like going to the dance or that you have other plans more important.    But if you still want to go to the dance, then you have to tell him honestly that you were actually going with someone else, but you were caught off guard and said yes on accident.    Risky situation, but you must do what you must do and face the consequences in the end.|`|e5jQenasaa	GO WITH HIM. WHO CARES ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE MAY THINK. HE IS YOUR FRIEND, YOU SAID IT. BUT MAKE SURE YOU TELL HIM THAT YOU ARE JUST GOING WITH HIM AS A FRIEND.     HE IS A GUY HE WONT BE HURT, IF YOU ARE HONEST.|`|wI5SU7ykaa	Some would say make a lie like "when you suddenly asked me I was caught off guard and had made plans with someone before you" or "Sorry but I need to be somewhere else" (ie don't go to the dance)  If you are going to the dance and just don't want him to dance with you say, "Sorry I can't make that plan wit you- I need to( this is just if you are gonna go with someone else) cuz if you just want to go to the dance and not be with him- just say it either way its just gonna have to be brutal and direct.|`|BpXTEmqgaa	Try telling him you dont want to ruin you friend ship by taking things too far.    but i say that you should go with him and jusst try you never know what could happend|`|2lByIoqGaa	you can still go with him as friends (not as awkward)... let him know that's how you are going with him though. Cuz it's fine to go as friends (even though you don't know him all that well).|`|LCIcUTwNaa	ok...Say politely...I'm sorry that I said yes.I would really rather not go.You kind of caught me off guard but I just don't think I would be interested in going.|`|VyuseWb2aa	Think before you answer. You might break the poor boy's heart but I don't know how much you don't want to be with him. I don't want to sound so mean but you can always say, "Well, out of no where, some plans came up and I probably can't go."
AOfm8ey6aa	I guess it depends... my daughter says mama and dada and she is 2 years old. She just have not a right idea what those words mean. She calls many people that way. "Mama, mama" can be "hi" to a friend or she says "hi dada" to me. She says a lot of words but she seems to understand a little. She has been talking a lot since she was just few months old and seems that her speech is progressing very slowly. She babbles and people think it is cute, which it really is, but I start to be concerned a little bit myself. I see other kids making big progress in their speech around the 2 year milestone, but my daughter seems to be stuck. She talkes a LOT, she has been able to lead a long long conversation with people or with herself, but noone understand what she is saying.    And yes, we teach her "mama" "dada" and "daddy".|`|2a726b94b1136e6caf4d74c8981c9e24aa	My son just turned 8 months old, and he says da-da.

My daughter is starting to have problems too. Everything that fits her in the waist is too short or too long...its a pain and when it comes to dresses, i had to alter alot of them. Shirts werent really a problem tho. Shes finally starting to fit her clothes better and hopefully she will take after her daddy and his tallness..haha!!!! When we had problems with finding clothes for her, we would go to Old Navy and get the adjustable waist pants...and most of the dresses there fit her. I even tried Gymboree....that place always had clothes that fit my child. Good luck!
apUkTo3maa	I WOULD SAY FORM FOUR TO SIX MONTHS AND IT DEPENDS ON HOW BIG YOU ARE|`|4AO2myzKaa	Just because you feel it doesn't mean you can see it from the outside...I could feel it from 16.5 weeks on the inside and didn't feel it until I was 22-24 weeks.  Even then my hub couldn't feel it, men's hands just aren't as sensitive.  It wasn't until I was 25 weeks or so that he could feel it.  He first felt it on his back when we were snuggling in the morning and the baby kicked him.  Now he can feel even the subtlest movements, but that's because he's practically ready to meet the world.  =D|`|1s3nddaYaa	yes, they should be able to feel that baby kick. but sometimes they stop when you want someone to feel your tummy lol. just have to have good timing. and i dr how far along i was|`|3gXQPso5aa	about 5 in a half months|`|4QJpj7xgaa	i was 18weeks when i felt i and 22weeks when he could!  good luck tho!|`|HtHFHfDKaa	As long as you feel it kicking everything should be ok 4-6 months|`|fEF2WoaYaa	about four and a half months yes if you can see the baby move then he can feel it|`|xeS8pUfbaa	its hard to tell =/ you can have him put his hand there and just sit really still he may feel it. my boyfriend feels it a lot now but he didnt used to|`|LClV32Vvaa	Yes, if you can see it than he should be able to feel it. And I was around 6 months before i could feel it on the outside.|`|mdmSrQ5paa	i can currently and i am 21 weeks  i can't feel it consistently every time the baby kicks [or punches haha]  but i can usually feel a good little push   i'd say it started at about 18 weeks if not a little later  i am a petite girl, and this is my first pregnancy so it's really easy to  feel where my womb is, and how close it is to the skin   which makes it easy to feel movement  butt if you want my advice   the baby always moves the most when i lay on my back,sneeze,cough, or have an orgasm [sorry if you didn't want to hear that but it's very true, and the most effective]     well i hope the best for you and your baby  happy inquiring!|`|PfYcKQHLaa	Hi    I had first flutters at 16 weeks and visible movement on the outside of my tummy from bout 20 weeks..It very strange to see but i love watching him move around..    xx|`|AA10953561	The first time my honey was able to feel the baby kick was at 21 weeks pregnant. It only happened once, then he felt it her again a few weeks later. These days (28 weeks pregnant) he can feel her kicking pretty consistently, but that's only if she doesn't play hide and seek. I'll feel her kick, tell him, and position his hand in the right spot, then she stops kicking that spot and picks a spot about an inch away from his hand.     I've noticed that if I'm in a slightly reclined sitting position I can press on the top of my baby bump and then my baby girl will start kicking. just below where I'm pressing. Good luck!|`|2E2hHlCgaa	around 4 to 5 months.... and yes... you can feel the baby move, kick.. and turn... they do all these roller costers in there.. :) somtimes... when they are moving and kicking... he'll let you touch it but once his father comes around to feel it... they have this sence of it and just kinda stops.. or maybe its how you touch the belly...    my husband would always try to touch my belly long ago when i was pregnant.. but every pregnacy my kids would stop when he put his hands on it... but when he doesnt touch it... they would move... and he can only watch.. hehe... somtimes they would kick and put their feet soo high up to my ribs.... and thats the only time my husband would be able to feel them move.....    mother of 5...
apUkTo3maa	IF THE DOCTOR SAID PEDISURE IM SURE ITS SAFE|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Instead could you pump, if he's just weaning from nursing.  Also look into foods, like those high in C, that help iron absorb.  For instance when you drink oj, with an iron rich food.|`|JP2h62qiaa	yeah that is safe. That would be SUPER good for him if you can get him to even drink that. They make some yummy flavors. If he takes it he is taking a lot of needed calories and vitamins.|`|ZMYs9IIAaa	A friend of mine had the same problem - PediaSure is a good supplement and is very healthy and safe for baby - my friend had the same problem with her baby and at first i wasn't sure if i agreed with her methods but in the end it worked - what she did was cut down his "being held" and "cuddle" time to only when she went to feed him - at first he cried for attention but he began to learn that when he ate he got to be held so it was kind of an incentive and reward for him - i know people who have disagreed with what she did but others who have agreed - hope it helps :D|`|JXHy2EHQaa	A baby can't live on Pediasure.  Why wean him if he won't drink formula (and why would he if he can have breastmilk, LOL)?  Food is not nutritionally needed until a baby turns one.  Some babies are just not ready for 'real' food before then, and that's okay.  I'd keep up the breastfeeding and if his iron is actually low (blood tested), then give iron supplements.  Keep offering 'real' food with different textures...mashed banana one day, chopped banana later, applesauce one day, soft cooked chopped apple later.  He might not like mushy food, or he might not like more texture.  Experiment to find out what he likes.
4YIUxSlYaa	She needs to grow up.  It was on the cheek for crying out loud.|`|GNgp759Yaa	just sounds like jealousy to me, it was a friendly kiss and nothing serious so why is she so pissed off about it :S|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	He was just joking tell her that you are sorry and he is just a longtime friend.|`|E6T9DPT9aa	Is he gay?    And tell her you're really  not interested in each other.    Jealousy brings out the worst in people.    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|tdHIR9cLaa	tell her to get over it!!! your his friend.... i have guy friends that like to hug like crazy... she is just a jealous person....|`|EXhVHMAlaa	It has nothing to do with being insecure.  I would be upset if my fiance did that.  Even when we were just dating.   I would apologize to his girlfriend and explain to her it meant nothing.|`|HOdblqIkaa	If your friends with him then its fine its not like you were making a move on her man. Its just a friendly I'm sorry kiss no biggie eventually everyone will forget about it and move on and if she doesn't get over it then ignore the whole situation she's gonna think what she wants but eventually shell come around.|`|4JNRMAxBaa	did he touch you where you wee?|`|PZv52KrNaa	leave her to cool down.  she's clearly insecure

She never used it - baby came while she was out and ended up having it in hospital.|`|EXhVHMAlaa	Use a kiddie pool.  A cheap blow-up one you can buy from a store in your town.  They'll work just as well.

As well, I have seen people on Birth Story, and similar shows, use regular kiddie pools with a submersible heater-that might be another option if resources are limited where you live.    I wish you the best!|`|ff4be252ca1bd5dd48919f16e87d90c2aa	There's a brand new birthing pool and kit on ebay 10 with 20 delivery just follow the link.

They do have birthing pools from 30-120, depending on what you want.
zLoyo24Taa	Please do not punish her for not going "poop" on the potty. It is typical for this to take longer than peeing on the potty. She will be more successful if the experience is kept as positive as you can keep it. You could make a sticker chart and let her put a sticker on it for going on the potty. You could go someplace special or get a special treat. Talk to her and give her a few "rewards" to pick from, she will work harder for something she wants. Good Luck.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	only big girls can go to the "blank"  choose something she would really like doing.  Mom  of course doesnt like hauling around a diaper bag.  Its more of a life lesson, than a bribe, that once you try, and get good at something, such as the potty, you get new rewards.|`|q4T9xcEeaa	Tell when she feel like she going to pass gas or feel like pooping to go to the bathroom and soon she will get use to it. But make sure she's most of the time around the bathroom that way she will be use to it|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Don't punish her for accidents but DO reward her for using the potty.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	You don't want to make potty training a negative and giving her a punishment for something she may not be able to control is only going to make the process that much harder.  She just turned 3.  It takes some kids longer to recognize the signals their body gives them.   Try going bare bottom around the house.  And yes there will be accidents and messes but she will be much more aware of her body.  We also used a treasure box filled with little things from the Dollar Store.  Every successful poo in the potty he got to pick a treasure.  Those two things finally pushed the training over the edge and got the job done.|`|iNWlJg4Oaa	It's hard but you aren't doing anything wrong it just takes some kids longer then others and then all of a sudden they decide they are ready. You can't force her and sometimes by punishing them it makes it worse because they become afraid of the potty. rewarding her for going poop in the potty is the best way make a sticker chart. or a candy reward.|`|d1csiCLKaa	Well for starters you have to stop punishing her, thats just making the problem worse. You will now have to lay off her and she will do this in her own time, punishing a child for pooing themselves is just worng, i bet you done this when you where potty training.    You have brought this on yourself, lay off the poor wee lass and let her do it in her own time|`|AA12251362	Your mistake is punishing her. You can't ever punish a child for doing an act that they have down their entire lives. You just have to start with the rewards. Tell her if she can poop in the potty all day that you will take her somewhere that she would want to go as a special treat or you'll make her her special cookies, something like that.
WyUSyxuaaa	i think tis really cute and creative  i also like the way it sounds when you say it  and i like that it has a meaning behind it ^-^|`|qitXGd0qaa	I've only met one girl with that first name, hers was spelled Alycia which I think is a little prettier. But Alecia Simone is a great name, very pretty!|`|hOvTiyFDaa	its cute :)  i know some one that spells it Alyssia though, but you can choose whatever you like.|`|n3LU0Abpaa	I really like the name, but hink about changing the spelling of her first name. ALOT of people are going to call her *Alicia* I have a friendwhose name is (Alecia), and she spells her name *Alisia*  Simone is cute, I like it|`|qPd5G3dSaa	im not to fond of simone but whatever floats your boat :)  congrats!|`|2rOQyvaKaa	Alicia like Batgirl Alicia Silverstone.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Well it doesn't rhyme with anything obscene so I give it a thumbs up!|`|5sYzlAjPaa	It is a very pretty name.|`|pLcUFBl2aa	It's really pretty! I always like unique names, nix on Isabella and stuff like that, right? Yeah Alecia Simone is such a cute name!?|`|SKJb6eLKaa	If you like it, that's all that matters!  (Believe me, my sister hated the name Anton but um, we still chose it LOL!)    I personally adore the name Alecia Simone!|`|zLVZyfwUaa	If you think this is the one it shouldn't matter what we think.  I find Alecia is alright and I love Simone|`|rlqAgQ3Vaa	ohhhhhhhh i think it is really creative and different, i love it|`|F44b2np9aa	Really pretty combo! Go with your heart:)|`|5KdPRKIVaa	I would spell it "Alicia" otherwise people would be spelling her name wrong her whole life which could be annoying.
ff4be252ca1bd5dd48919f16e87d90c2aa	Please note I'm using my husbands name has mine keeps signing out. ayli1984    Is mylittlezanderman from this F*CKING planet? Put your faith in God. I think & hope everything is ok for you but come on the last thing a mum to be needs to hear at a time like this is don't go to hospital & put your faith in God. That's the most stupid F*CKING answer I have ever heard. I'm not saying people are wrong to believe in God & I don't mean to offend anyone but there stupid.    NO NO NO & NO call your local hospital NOW & tell them you need to speak to Labor suit. This is NOT normal in the slightest. She needs to get straight there. If she does not have transport ring the Labor Suit and they will send an ambulance out. Please do it quickly you would never forgive yourselves if anything (god help it) happens to that baby.|`|8ZgwtbwEaa	should never self diagnose in pregnancy, she should go doc|`|1CgSVXxXaa	The best thing would be to go see the doctor as soon as possible. If it continues tell her to call the hospital and describe her discharge. They might want her to come in to emergency or it could just be normal spotting. Either way consult a physician as soon as possible. With me, I went straight to emergency even when it turned out to be nothing. Better safe then sorry though.|`|e3fa2fb97cbca43e2c3086607351d4caaa	no she should go to the doctors right away|`|QMxEjCpiaa	I haven't had that - go see a doctor.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	She should go to the doctor to make sure everything is okay. Some bleeding is common in early pregnancy but if it were me I would see a doctor just to be sure.|`|tvF86mRDaa	Some light spotting of blood is normal with your body adjusting etc. If she's worried then definitely go to the docs as they will put your mind at rest.|`|QR6IHIZxaa	depends if its light or dark pink. they say that light spotting is normal in pregnancy just have to watch for bright red bleeding. i think shes fine but if shes concern she can go to the doctors to get a check up.    -- sri forgot to add if its around her period would normally be as well. its actually normal to have spotting,.|`|tClYrQ1vaa	well you have discharge so it could be that she is bleeding a little bit and that's what is making it a pink color she should just slow down and rest and if  she starts bleeding or spotting alot  then she should go to the doc|`|PZv52KrNaa	ring the midwife|`|nluNSDI4aa	That could be an indication of a potential miscarriage. Especially since she is in her first trimester and that is when miscarriages are mostly vulnerable to happen. She needs to go to her doctor right away!|`|om09b9UNaa	Ok first of all... Calm down, lol i know both of you are freaking out, i've been there. It is completly normal. Some people have a cycle throughout their whole pregnancy. I do suggest that you schedule and appt. with the obgyn but I do not think there is a need to rush to the ER. But one thing you should know for sure is that you should put your faith in God and everything will be ok. I will pray for a healthy pregnancy. good luck to you and your sister in law :)
PReJPa3laa	Yes. We live in America, where people are allowed to make their own choices..... legally.      I always hated it when pro-life people are like "YOU CAN'T GET AN ABORTION IT'S MURDERRRRRR!" .. when really it's not. The fetus isn't breathing, eating, or thinking on it's own.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	Nope. It's a living being. It breaths air from the mother, eats food from the mother, feels pain at 12 weeks and after 20 weeks, it's capable of surviving outside the mothers womb.|`|8ZgwtbwEaa	Maybe if its Damien?|`|1CgSVXxXaa	yes|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Yes|`|cj7sSPZEaa	What do you mean by a "viable option?"

Not a good one, but still an option.|`|J8lnNUakaa	no if they do the do they need to take care of the resolute|`|69kVQYEcaa	yeah.|`|zSABr7praa	No.  Do you think murdering toddlers is a viable option for other couples?  Good luck with your class.|`|mQdWhY2laa	No. Adoption is only an option if the mother's live is in danger.|`|s1utniuvaa	yes|`|mfRH2Wiiaa	No, it is cruel and you ever has an abortion should be put on a murder trial.

Other than that, there are much better options available, and nearly all problems can be worked through, especially financial ones. There's never an perfect time to have a child, you just have to make the best of the situation. Every child deserves the right to live. Adoption is much better option if you really feel you can't look after the child, although I don't think I could go through with that either. Good luck with your class!|`|HtHFHfDKaa	I don't think that anyone should abort a baby what did the baby ever do to deserve having its life taken. I think that they should put it up for adoption. Having an abortion has a tremendous life altering effect on a woman. I know someone who had an abortion and it nearly killed her. Plus having an abortion puts the woman at risk for complications for future children.    So no I don't think it is a viable option|`|LClV32Vvaa	NO WAY!!|`|X2EPEEwbaa	absolutely not.|`|zULJt7ctaa	Absolutely not. That is taking someones life.|`|qN6Bq0Emaa	yes. Each person and couple have different issues and require different decisions. I feach solution worked for everyone, we'd all be driving the same cars and drinking the same sodas.|`|myEwHgI1aa	never|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	yes, i think plenty of people simply do not want children or are pro-choice and opt to abort. this includes couples.|`|sIibbA8Baa	NO!!!! THE BIBLE SAYS NOT TOOO!|`|aoMGUhFNaa	no. i think that if a couple really can't raise the baby they should go for adoption. why kill it when someone else can be happy and raise it, and give it a chance at life?|`|e3fa2fb97cbca43e2c3086607351d4caaa	no its murder|`|IBu2melVaa	NO WAY IT WAS THE STUPID PEOPLES FAULT FOR GETTING PREGNANT SO WHY SHOULD THE BABY TO SUFER FOUL PEOPLE|`|AA11920812	No.|`|nluNSDI4aa	I for one do not support abortion AT ALL! that is killing another life. Its murder they just sugar coat it with the word "abortion"|`|yfPu5pcZaa	My boyfriend and I had a long talk before becoming sexually active with each other and agree that abortion is NOT an option. We will take responsibility for whatever may happen. There is no need to take someones life away because you made a mistake.|`|MGOmVeMfaa	yes|`|lUO6wLGAaa	Legally, it's a woman's right in the U.S.A.  Morally, however, I don't see how it could ever be considered acceptable.  If you're studying to be a doctor, I personally would admire you if you refused to perform abortions -- which is a right that you should always stand up for.|`|mdmSrQ5paa	definitely  everybody is different  and everybody has different choices, lives, and experiences   it definitely shouldn't be used as a birth control method   and should really make the woman or couple in question  think about the choices they have made   for some it is the safest healthiest most intelligent decision  there are others though who live unhealthy life styles and use abortion as as a scapegoat   those are types of mothers i wouldn't want in the world any way   i just wish it would open their eyes and make them realize that this is what having sex gets you and unless you want to be completely selfish horrible person for the rest of your life  you can't just keep getting abortions|`|VnK7sTHKaa	certainly not|`|w4ksNNJWaa	Yes, if a couple cannot afford to care for the baby and bring it up properly i think it is better to have an abortion than to bring a baby into a poor quality of life.|`|W1wDHUYoaa	the keyword here being "couples". If they are a couple who believes they are mature enough to have sex than the should be mature enough to take care of a child. If raising the child is out of the picture (such as homeless, or just flat out incapable) than there are thousands of people who would kill to adopt their child.|`|yoDWhQnhaa	Yes. It's the parents decision and it is a fetus by the way. Not yet a baby|`|Ghts0pt4aa	No is it okay to kill a living  human|`|Dzh3lEhKaa	No, I don't think it makes it OK just because it's a couple deciding rather than just a woman. There are so many people using abortion as their method of birth control and it's ridiculous! Either wrap it up don't put it in if you don't want a baby. A fetus is a LIVE being despite what some claim. A heartbeat is present and the baby deserves to live.|`|4CCJRrjDaa	No!  It's another word for murder.  It's not her body!  The baby has a different blood type and dna to the mother.    Also God is clearly against it so men should also be  Exodus 21 says even LIFE for LIFE. I pray all that have had an abortion would seek God's mercy in Christ Jesus.    "If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise." NIV|`|SqPorKz5aa	NO
Q9qno7EVaa	I had troubles breastfeeding, my little girl is 8 weeks now, she went on the bottle at about 5 days, with bottle and breast. Eventually she was completely on the bottle (with breastmilk) and refusing the breast all together (she was about 6 weeks when this happened). I gave up after a few days of both of us getting stressed out. The other day she was quite unsettled and a bit sleepy, not really hungry though and I laid in bed with her and attempted to give her the breast as a comfort (her dummy/pacifier didn't do the trick). And she took it really well, I've fed her in the same way a few more times, maybe we will get completely on the breast. My suggestion would be try to give him the breast before he is hungry, or try to express a little to get a let-down and then put your boy on it'll be an instant reward for him then. He might take it better in the middle of the night as well or when he's been alseep for a while. There is still plenty of time for him to re-learn. Good luck.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	it may sound cruel, but stop the bottle.     when he latches onto your breast, take the palm of your hand and starting at the egde of the breast, or ribcage, just push towards the nipple.  it will make the milk come out a little faster and once he starts getting the taste into his mouth again he will start sucking.   ( think if it as almost squirting the milk into his mouth )  Keep at it.  when you stop nursing, your body adjusts and will make less milk.  So, nurse every 2 hours, or  more for the first day. and drink lots of water, juice, milk.    good luck|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Have other people give him a bottle if he needs one (do not give him one yourself), nurse him frequently, eventually he'll learn that mommy, who he loves the most, has breasts.
471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	I find biting my son's nails off is easier than clipping them. I try and do a finger or two at every nursing session and get the whole hand done by the end of the day, then the next day I do the other hand. For toe nails I find it's easier to use adult nail clippers because it doesn't take as many clips to get the whole toe nail.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	how old is your bub?  when my girl was up to 9 months old, i used a nail file and just filed them until felt safe enough to use the nail clippers.  But, its worth a try|`|zlGb9NkZaa	i get my LO in my lap and hold her hand with a couple fingers in her grip & cut them with the nail scissors...  usually can only get a few at a time.|`|JP2h62qiaa	Put your finger in his palm so that way if he tries to ball up his fist his fingers wont get past your finger. Try it each time and you will find your own special way to hold his fingers and use your hands at the same time:)|`|2ZoUduoPaa	My little one likes to keep her fists balled too.  I usually cut them after a bath when they're softer.  I place two fingers in her hand to clutch, that way I can see the nail.  Then using the other fingers and hand I cut away.  It's a little tricky at first, but I get it done.  Good luck!!!|`|tapFZBowaa	OK, here is what we do.....

dq04utMoaa	I am sorry for your lost and congrads on your rainbow baby!!!    I am taking the baby aspirin daily due to the fact I have 2 blood clotting disorder. I am not sure what kind of tests your doctor ran after you had your miscarriage however this is the one my doctor ran after I lost my daughter at 19 weeks... I am also taking a daily shot of Lovenox...  I am sure your doctor is just trying to make sure you don't lose another baby.. you can always request to be screened by a high risk doctor to make sure the baby is growing on time etc...

Scared me to death!  And then the twinges went away and I had full blown pain in both hips- round ligament pain.

Wait till the end when it's 1000 times it's normal size. There really nothing to worry about. However if you experience period like pains then contact your local hospital and ask to speak to labor suit straight away. Other than that good luck.

apUkTo3maa	I ALWAYS SAID WHEN I HAD MY SON AT AGE 17 I WOULD NOT GET ONE. I DIDN'T I WENT THROUGH WITH IT. I FELT MORE OF A MOMMY DOING WITH OUT THAT MEDICINE. NOW THAT I LOOK BACK IT WASN'T EVEN THAT BAD IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE.|`|obN6p3Cgaa	No....................|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	not at all, have you ever thought that maybe the only reason you were able to push that baby out so easily was because you were able to rest and rebuild your strength? maybe if you had been awake all night in pain it would have taken twice as long to push your baby out because you had no energy, an epidural is not a bad thing, it helps labor progress, helps women get rest for the huge task they are about to perform, no one is a coward for chosing an epidural|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	No I dont feel it is wrong, I too am hoping to do labor without an epidural but everyone woman feels labor and delivery different and they feel pain different. Not all women can take the pain of labor and not all babies can either, it sometimes will stress the baby when the mother is in that kind of pain. Everyone makes their own choice on this but I dont feel anyone is a coward or wrong for getting one or not getting one.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	no you werent wrong. theres nothing wrong with getting pain medications. i look at it like getting numbed for a dental procedure...its great that they have the meds if you want them, but not everyone needs them, its just a pain tolerance thing. people give birth every day without pain medications, its just a personal choice whether you want them or not. i plan 100% on having an epidural when i give birth, anyone CAN give vaginal birth without one but its just nice to have one anyways. opposite of you, my mother did NOT have an epidural with me [only child] and she wishes to this day she would have had one =] but she has a low pain tolerance lol.|`|ROJans2Taa	you shouldn't ever feel guilty, for me my first I went natural because the anastigiolist(sp) was too busy and didn't make it to me in time, the second I was determined to do it natural since I did it with my first but got stuck at 5 cm for 6 hrs and they gave me pictocin which makes the contractions stronger and faster, I couldnt take it anymore and gave in and got the epidural, I honestly enjoyed my second labor alot more, my first I thought I was gonna die, it's a personal choice, and your baby didnt suffer one  bit. and yes, way back when women did it natural, but it wasnt by choice it was the only way, im sure alot of them would have taken the epidural, if they could have. best luck in the future|`|cj7sSPZEaa	No it's not wrong!  If it were wrong then it wouldn't be an option.  Child birth is painful!  Would you tell someone suffering from cancer that it is wrong for him to get pain meds?  NO sane person would tell a person with cancer pain that it is wrong for him to NOT want to be in pain.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Not at all.  I think it was smart to get one.  If you wouldn't have you would have been up all night and not have the strength in the morning to push.    I had an epidural with my daughter and i would never give birth without one.|`|d94d376d37270864191dbd4310431caaaa	No it is a personal decision for the mom.  No one can judge what a mom's pain is during birth.|`|llEdx8Q2aa	No, why does giving birth have to be painful? I would have taken the epidural too.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	You are asking for opinions? How you choose to deliver is a very personal choice, but in my opinion, no it's not "bad" at all. You didn't do any harm.|`|kwMA5I1iaa	No, it's not wrong to get an epidural. Some women can tolerate more pain then others. Also, if you weren't able to sleep without the epidural...it was a good idea that you got it or else you wouldn't have had the strength you did have. Giving birth, especially for the first time, could be quite scary and you don't know what to expect.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Of course it isn't wrong. Many women have gotten epidurals including myself. I got one without any harm to my baby or myself. Everyone has a different pain threshold..some can handle pain more than others. That doesn't make you a horrible person or a coward because you give in to having pain medication. Thats stupid to think that way!!|`|EmLgTW9Iaa	First, just because most people do something doesn't make it right.  Everything that happens to the mom also happens to the baby, meaning that the baby feels the effects of the epidural too.  These babies are more lethargic at birth and have a harder time bonding and learning to feed when compared to babies born with no medicine.      It surprises me that a mid-wife would urge you to get an epidural.  Most midwives are more into traditional medicine and like fewer interventions, at least in the states.      I believe though that you also have to weigh the risks against the benefits.  If you are getting exhausted after a long labor it may be more beneficial to get the epidural so that you can get some rest.  If you are too exhausted to "finish" your labor you might need to actually get a cesarean because with no progress your cervix can start to close back up.    I don't think it's wrong to have an epidural, and I don't think it cowardly.  Each situation is different, and what really matters is that at the end you finally get to look into the eyes of the baby you've been growing for 9 months.    Bravo to you for wanting to go au natural in the future.  I'm due in a month, have a mid-wife and am planning to give birth at home.  Whether in a hospital, birthing center, or at home, I think if possible to do so, a woman should give birth without medicine because it's better for the baby.  But the decision should be hers and hers alone whether or not to get medicine.  No one should pressure her to do what they think is right because only she KNOWS what is right for her.|`|7U3RQBLtaa	My sister got an epidural, her labia shriviled up and her clit fell off!|`|YlLmAADraa	no, labor is very painful. i had my son 8 weeks ago at the age of 19 and had an epidural after 17 hours of labor and was able to get some rest.|`|4lpJRXYsaa	no it is not wrong, more than 70% of women get an epidural|`|O4JuH8zmaa	If it's wrong, I don't want to be right. I had a great birthing experience because of the epidural and would NEVER do it any differently and I am 22.|`|kT7GVOosaa	LORD NO! I believe we were born in this day and age because we need medicine to get us through it. if god wanted us to all have natural labor we would have been born before the epidural!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	I dont think it is ever wrong for a woman to request pain relief if she needs it during labour/birth    It doesn't make you a coward.    I think it is perfectly acceptable to ask for help     I am hoping for an all natural birth, but if i cant do it or i feel i need it - i am happy to ask for pain relief|`|tClYrQ1vaa	no its not wrong that you got it|`|akB0gV20aa	I don't think it was wrong.  It was what was best for you at that time, and you had a good experience with it.  It is great to go natural, but don't feel bad if you can't..at least you still brought a beautiful baby into the world.    You are having 5 more kids?|`|1lUOOGl6aa	Not at all,  i got an epidural with my first baby and i will definately be getting one next time around, and earlier too...|`|H17FtEgKaa	NO! i have 5 kids, i dont know what i would have done without and Epidural. But i've had triplets, if you can avoid a c-section, i would. The pain after is worse than after the epidural.|`|3e6175bba38d844ea9a99e1eab5894b2aa	Absolutely not bad!!!!    You are not going to be a better mother because you get an epidural.  Childbirth is not a contest of who is the bravest.  I am not for drugs but childbirth is hard enough without having to have to have pain.  You will still feel pain.  I have given birth twice and both times I had an epidural.  Do not feel bad about it.  You are just a normal woman.|`|d8fSVX23aa	If you needed a tooth pulled because of decay and were in agony would you expect people to call you a coward if you asked for your gums to be frozen by injection.No! so why would you feel you are supposed to suffer the pain of labor just to show how brave you are ???    I don't see anyone walking out of the labor room with a bravery certificate. I'll take any pain relief that allows me to focus on the pleasure of greeting my new baby rather than the trauma of birth.|`|Knierqi9aa	It's not wrong at all.  You should do what makes the most sense to YOU at the time and don't worry about what somebody else would do or think.  Altho you may want all natural the next time, something might happen at the last minute and it might be safer to make make another choice. My 1st epidurial was sorta needed becasue they had to put me on pitocin, and the pit broke  thru most of it anyway.  My 2nd epidural was needed becasue there was no break between my contractions;ended up my baby was being squeezed to death, so had an emergeny c-section to save his life.  SO, think ahead, but don't nail yourself down before your chickens are hatched.  Having a child is a beautiful, yet  often painful, experience, no matter how it happens.|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	No it is not wrong. Since your first was not that bad why not try to go no drugs.I'm 26 just had my girl 7 weeks ago no drugs it was not that bad and I got to move around during labour to feel better and with all the moving around I did my baby flip from coming out face up to being perfectly positioned if I had not Been able to move I don't think she would have flipped.     Anyways my labour was only 8 hours and it was my first. It hurt but the pain never lasted long. So I say you can do it drug free it's amazing.    Do what feels right for me no drugs just felt right. As weird and crazy as it might sound I honestly wanted to feel what giving birth was like. And the thought of a needle in my spine freaked me out.

G9ywiLqvaa	in my sons' school, they have a notebook per child that gets to be brought home everyday.  here, parents can see the day-to-day activities and progress of their kids, and parents can pencil in their concerns and questions here, too.  i usually get quick, written responses to this.  they also have a quarterly PTC between the parent and the teacher with the school head present.  aside from getting your child's full progress report, you can also bring up critiques in the system or curriculum as you like.  it becomes a friendly bull session.  ideas are swapped.  and then together with the teacher and the school head, you can plan out a better educational/social program for your child.  everything in the discussion is documented so you have something to check back on to achieve your goal for the next quarter.  but of course, this is not as regular as a regular school might go.  personally, i appreciate the face-to-face critique technique rather than having scores to fill or essays to write.  a face-to-face calls for an immediate answer and solution to the concern.  i don't know.  i'm all for instant gratification.  lol!  hope i helped.|`|1hciyvKdaa	How do you keep your sanity with all these lil cuties running around!! I would ask you, and I hope you edit and could please answer this for me pretty please. When you have a student that is off in la la land, doesn't really take part in group settings for more than a few mins at a time, and doesn't respond to any suggestions or time outs, or whatever, how do you take control, and would you order any testing. My grandson is not starting kindergarten this year due to this. If the poor teacher can handle this next year, how will you handle it in your class? My daughter doesn't realize and wont hear gentle suggestions of possibly seeing a therapist or Dr regarding it, how can the school help parents identify if there is a known issue that needs special classes or therapy or further diagnosis. Thanks for any help!|`|x5SJDvIraa	I would like to be able to critique my child's teacher, but I don't think i would want to be asked.   Like, i would rather just have a card sent home with me in the beginning of the year asking for comments on ways to improve the classroom that can be turned in at anytime.   In my opinion, asking just seems like my child's teacher is not confident in themselves. Some would take this as something great, but I would personally find it a bit impolite and worrisome.   Sorry, i know i didn't help much, but i just wanted this out there that this is how some parents might feel.|`|89qgMZjiaa	I'm a parent of a 13 year old son and I'm currently undergoing teacher licensure in my state.  I have a number of issues with all my son's teachers as he is a special needs child and they repeatedly fail him.  The best thing I can say to any teacher advice-wise is that when you find yourself not able to spend the time each child needs to be educated, quit.  Get out of the profession and move on to something you can be happy and competent in that you can treat as just a job.  Teaching is so much more than what you do during the day that if you're not driven and moved by it, you should find something with less responsibility.  Best of luck in your career.|`|2f2051dc50672978e79faa67ebbf8c1caa	i don't like that the teacher doesn't let me know if there's a problem with my child, like behavior.its like pulling teeth to get her to talk.she doesn't send a note home,call me, nothing no effort.|`|LqimEAfWaa	Starred this question!  Very interesting indeed.    I'm currently in college and am majoring in elementary education, so I think that some of the answers you get might help me when I start my teaching career.    To get to the question...  I would maybe send home something during the first week of school where the parents can write down what their expectations are for the school year, for their child, and for you as a teacher.  Then have it be returned within the first month of school.  Send something similar to the parents after Christmas break again.  You can also ask the parents during parent/teacher conferences if there are any concerns they have, or if they have any feed back on how you are doing as a teacher.    Personally, if I was the parent who had to critique the teacher, I would prefer to have it set up where I could write in my own responses.  I feel you can get better feedback through that instead of a rating of 1-10.  Also, I would want to feel comfortable enough to be able to come and talk with the teacher about any concerns or issues my child might be having.  I would also want to be able to come and inform the teacher of things my child has said they like about school.    I think the important thing is keeping an open door for communication between you as a teacher and the parents of the students.  I think that if the parents feel they are able to come to you with concerns and stuff like that, then they are more apt to be honest.  But if they feel they will get shut out or ignored when voicing concerns, then they probably won't want to be as honest.    Hope this helps. :)

My wife tried for days we even went to a lactation specialist and my daughter refused and loved the bottle. She is perfectly healthy and is in great shape so I guess it was the right choice. Even if you pump to get the initial milk which has all of the things the baby will need it is just as good. It costs a lot more to bottle feed though.|`|HclKftzAaa	I want to breast feed. I am hoping my milk comes in. Once we've established a good routine for feeding, i will express milk and ALSO bottle feed (so that hubby, grandparents etc can bond with baby, and so i don't always have to be around).    bottle feeding does not necesarily mean formula feeding.    reasons for wanting to BF:  cheaper  easier  help lose weight/shrink womb  bond with baby  healthier (though formula IS getting very good nowadays)    At the same time, i would never judge a woman for not BF.

In addition to losing weight and having less pain in your breasts (when you're not feeding), it is best for the baby because it can provide nutrients to the baby that the baby cannot get from formula. The baby will have a stronger immune system, less gastronomical problems, will not develop as many allergies as an infant, and there's been psychological studies that say that children who were breast fed grow up to be smarter than children who were not.     If you cannot breast feed your child will still be fine on formula, but breast really is best for the child, and the mother.|`|rAkWoweOaa	What is best for my baby.

n1lZKTaYaa	Absolutely normal. Slightly annoying at times, but normal. When I was pregnant with my son that happened. I actually didn't know I was pregnant at the time that it was going on so I, like you, thought it was my period...or gas bubbles. Turns out it was just everything coming together, rearranging, etc. When I got to about 7-8 months pregnant you could actually see a foot or elbow poke out and roll around. Scared my friends, entertained my husband. He would actually play music louder just to see him wiggle.

You will find that with the iron in the prenatal vitamins and pregnancy in general, you will feel slightly constipated or "fuller" in your abdomen because of the slow movement of wastes and other juices in your body.  If it doesn't hurt, then don't worry about it.  Just make sure you mention it to your doctor during your first prenatal appointment.      Congratulations and good luck on your adventure!
91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	test|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	99.9 % sure you are probably pregnant you have all the symptoms!!! Why don't you take a home pregnancy test then if it says positive even negative go to the doctor because you can't fully trust a pregnancy test a doctor is better!!!   Love,  Chelsie   p.s good luck on trying to have a baby they are wonderful!
nqbv3Kqpaa	Yes you can.  Guys can secrete seamen prior to ejaculation (burst)    No lectures on being to young because obviously you are already sexually active.      You need to go to a planned parenthood TOMORROW and purchase Plan B (only small window of time for it to work), along with getting tested for STD's and going on some form of birth control.  PLEASE!!!    You are responsible for you!  Never trust a guy in matters dealing with your body and your future.  No matter what he says or claims. (unless he's your doctor)  Always use a condom, guys can get off just fine with them on, no matter what they claim.  This is for your own protection against diseases.  Look up STD images they're no joke!    Please protect yourself.|`|JMoehY2naa	YES, you can get pregnant. If your not using protection I really don't think your ready for sex.   My daughter is 13 this summer and I can't even begin to imagine she's anywhere near ready and she is quite mature for her age but still not mature enough for sex at 13!!   I'd advise to stop having sex until you know the answers to all sexual questions like these, like in your 20's!|`|t8H6XEyXaa	How do you know he didn't burst since this is your first time?|`|cf4edaf15617b46e94d234ea845ecdebaa	YOU ARE WAY TOO YOUNG TO BE HAVING SEX!!!!!  Now for your answer.  There is that possibility yes.. or getting a STD.  Neither one you are emotionally ready for the consequences of an unplanned pregnancy..  Even at 16,17, and 18 most people are not ready for that type of responsibility..  Pray you are not and don't rush growing up.  14years and a baby does not make sense..|`|CfpkOo5Oaa	OMG!!!your only 13!?  get your mom to get you plan B. (This will prevent Pregnacy.)    yes 13 year olds can get preggo.  so get your mom to get you Plan B|`|7xit1ogxaa	You are way too young to be having sex. Yes, you can become pregnant. Pre-ejaculate contains sperm, and it only takes one sperm to become pregnant.|`|G94NlpZ0aa	wow. I think I was still playing barbies and stuff when I was 13.    and yes you can get pregnant if he doesn't "burst" inside of you.|`|0cc5b5bbc5737c639788c13b8ae7e80daa	i was 12 years old with my first pregnancy and why would he have sex with you if he didnt *** ?????? Thats a mans man goal hunny they could care less about you and your needs....... and yes you can get pregnant from pre ejaculation... pls be very careful most men/boys just want to USE you for one thing.........Thats it......... there are too many std's out there and they want to share because they donot want to be the only ones with it..... just trying to give you advice from my own experiences in life ;) hope i helped
aL4UoRdTaa	I counted that you would be in your tenth week.  Or around that time. They count from the first day of your last period.  So you count that as week one even though you haven't conceived yet.  Just to make things even across the board they do that.  Dec. 17-19 would be just around the time of ovulation so it is possible you could have got pregnant.      Some women do have spotting during pregnancy and continue on to have a normal birth.  Having said that there is also the possibility of miscarriage.     If your preg. test is negative by this far along then it is possible that you are having a miscarriage.  God I hate saying that as i've had one and it is horrible.  Home preg. tests only register at about 50 HCG (hormone level).  When you have a miscarriage your HCG does go up and then eventually it goes back down to 0 because unfortunately the pregnancy was not successful.  If your HCG Is not at 0 yet then a doctor could tell you this for sure by having a blood test.  But it is likely that it is already at 0.  Can always get the blood test if you really want to know but then it might not tell you anything if it is 0.  So the thing is that by this far along a preg test should register positive.  But you never know.    But maybe you are having irregular periods for another reason.  There are women's conditions such as endometriosis or PCOS that cause irregular periods in women.  Usually they are accompanied by painful periods.  Also over excercise and stress can cause irregular periods.    For any of these scenarios you really should see your OBGYN.  Not because its desperately serious but just to help your body out and so you won't have to stress on knowing what is going on.    I am sending positive thoughts that all is well for you.  I hope this information helped you out.  Much Love!|`|IllWKAUGaa	Definitely make a doctors appointment...sounds like you could be definitely be pregnant....hpts aren't always accurate, sometimes there isnt enough hormones concentrated in your urine to show up positive. You need to get a blood test done to find out for sure....even if you aren't pregnant, you need to find out what's going on because it's not worth risking your health if something is up....    good luck...|`|Ndw34J0daa	I would say that there are times when people just skip periods and there's no good reason for it. I'm 10 weeks pregnant today, but I didn't know until about the 6 week because I skipped the period right before and I thought I was just doing it again. Luckily, my husband and I were trying to get pregnant so I was taking my vitamins and eating right. But the point is, sometimes just the fear of being pregnant (or not for me) is enough to cause you to be late or skip. Also, stress, lack of sleep, eating habits, etc can all cause a missed period.     The fact is that by now, you should get a positive pregnancy test, with any brand, if you were period. There is a chance that you might have been pregnant and have had an early abortion (25 - 30% of women experience this during the first trimester but most before they even know they are pregnant).    You should probably make an appointment with your doctor, have them run a serum test to make sure your hcg level is where it should be, and make sure everything is ok. If it's nothing, you'll at least feel better and that will probably be the best thing for regulating your periods again.
AFi5kTiEaa	I breastfed both my children.  I wore regular bras the whole time.  Just lifted them up or used the front closure ones.  The only time i wore nursing bras was at nite, they are more comfy for sleeping.  I bought new ones when i was done nursing.|`|EULVtVDvaa	Congrats 1st off :) . I had my baby girl 5 months ago and I'm nursing :). I am still wearing normal underwire bras - I'm sorry but those nursing bras do not have a bit of support to them even with the underwires . I bras that I have are from Dillard's and have a clasp in the front - lol most of the time even if it has a clasp in the back I will just pull the cup over my breast .    Edit *** You go MaryC :)|`|DBKV3g4baa	I was told by a lactation nurse at the hospital to avoid underwire bras.  The underwire can put too much pressure on the breast and cause clogged milk ducts (or eventually an infection), which are supposedly quite painful.|`|AgPDg010aa	Bravado and the blue canoe are the two nicer nursing bras that I would suggest. I think underwire just makes it harder for you to snap off the bra for feedings, these bras have a lot if support and various shapes|`|690279cb7caa51056d2e306c73dae94faa	I just use a sleep bra.  It works just as well as a nursing bra but better.  No fastenings. My bra size is so huge that I can't find it in stores.  Size J cup so I have trouble finding bras that fit me when I am not nursing.|`|n4eHbm6baa	i bought some great bras from motherhood maternty after my daughter was born and they had underwire and some had push up. but the push up really didnt matter because my breast were so big and with the breast pads gave it a lil more to....|`|Y3dFm6uGaa	I wore a "push up" for years before my 2 were born.  They were 13 months apart and I nursed both.  During that time, I wore a "nursing bra" until I realized that I really didn't need a bra at all.  The rest is history!...    I haven't worn a bra since 1975!  Every once in awhile, I get really dressed up and put on a bra, but for the most part, I don't wear one.  I find a bra to be uncomfortable and prefer not to wear one.      My 36-C's really haven't sagged much for the lack of support and I can still stuff them into a 'push up'' on occasion.  However, at my age, the only guys looking are WAY younger!  I'll stick with Papaw!    Unless you have a really comfortable bra, I'd suggest just losing it entirely!  Or not.  You be the judge!|`|HyknHVV5aa	I would look into this bra, its a nursing bra that is described as "Providing a slight push-up without padding." http://www.mybirthcare.com/apparel/eveal...|`|5EiShLZZaa	I used underwire bras during nursing, but I also suffered a LOT of PAINFUL clogged ducts because of it...I just didn't want to spend the extra money on more bras.  Victoria's secret now makes a nursing bra line!!! It's only available online, so I'd go to the store and get measured for one and maybe get some more info.  Also, I found that using regular front closure bras (rather than nursing bras) were just as accessible and much more flattering.  Good luck momma!
nzGdMWbZaa	Take a HPt with your early morning urine.|`|W1p6LetFaa	Pre*** DOES contain sperm and you CAN get pregnant from it.  This is why I am pregnant right now.|`|7xit1ogxaa	I don't know who told you that pre-ejacultate does not contain sperm. That is wrong. Pre-ejaculate does contain sperm. If pre-ejaculate didn't contain sperm then you wouldn't be able to become pregnant from the pull-out method. Yes, there is a chance you could be pregnant. Take a test if you miss your period.|`|bJ0rUlqdaa	pre *** definitely does contain sperm. whoever told you that it doesn't gave you false information. dont stress out over it beceause you can convince your body you are pregnant and if you stress out it will cause your period to come later which will make u think that you are pregnant|`|soFpywFcaa	sounds like your just running yourself crazy....relax because before your p day things like this always happen we just never notice until we are either  trying to conceive or just paranoid that we could be so relax ............good luck|`|vgR6i2t1aa	Precum has been proven to only get you pregnant 4% of the time.  This is the same as the pull out method not working only 4% of the time.  Go to plannedparenthood.org and read under birth control, it actually lists the pull out method as a form of birth control.
u0mZAPuDaa	That sounds great.    My pediatrician also encouraged to offer a bottle right before bed, because my daughter sleeps about 12 hours a night.    When my daughter was seven months she ate -   Breakfast - Cereal mixed with a fruit and four ounces of a bottle.  Lunch - Veggie and half of a fruit and four ounces of a bottle.  Dinner - Veggie mixed with cereal and four ounce bottle.  Bedtime - Offered a bottle, usually drank about four ounces.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	That sounds fine.|`|DwTrJ9GTaa	your doing good|`|twHXtMh6aa	It's always a good idea to discuss this with your doctor. :-)|`|BMfn0D9gaa	my daughter is 7 months and i feed her rice cereal for breakfast, a small stage 1 veggie for lunch, and half of stage 2 veggie and half stage 2 fruit for dinner.  also about 24-26 oz of formula!
u2hx0A1raa	Yeah, I always used them with both my kids. They were fine.|`|uFjvl4JSaa	I tried them but I didn't like them. They leaked through very quickly and my son got alot of rashes    to marissa, I have used pampers swaddlers with my second son and he has never leaked through them|`|wBpennsMaa	Use any diapers you get for free! Parents choice diapers are fine.|`|MO2H26XOaa	i think parents choice is a great brand! i use them now for my 6 week old baby girl, but just to warn you, if you switch, DO NOT use huggies. they may be a very popular brand and all, but everyone i have talked to, their babies pee right through them! everytime i changed my daughters diaper, i had to change her outfit too!|`|9X09kM4oaa	honestly it all depends... it can sometimes, then it cant sometimes. It isn't the best diaper in my book, but however it is useable. I found that I had to change my little ones clothes more because it didnt fit as snug as the other brands did. Since you have a boy you should try huggies, they work pretty well. But diapers are so expensive you may want to try luvs and see if that works. But hey since your getting the parents choice diapers for free- see if they work for your little man so you will know in the future.|`|c159efe1b44ee4b1b369d779c1d19521aa	OMG Those things are terrible. They are rough and my son started getting a rash when we used them. Personally, we liked the Pampers Swaddlers and switched to Luvs when he started wearing size one diapers.|`|zLVZyfwUaa	I found they leaked badly, but as everyone has said you got them free use them see if they work and go from there|`|EULVtVDvaa	With my 1st born I did use them but when he was close to being potty trained . I did try them when he was an infant but they leaked . But thats great you get them free so use them :)|`|u5BK6471aa	To jen,  just letting you know that i have used huggies for 10 months now and they have only leaked out the legs a couple of times when she did a really big poo. :) We switched her to a bigger size and she had no more problems. But huggies can be expensive. A brand i would recommend is snugglers as i used them for a while and found them as good as huggies and they are a lot cheaper.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	somebody gave us some so i tried them, but i threw them out bc they didn't keep the wet off her bum and i change her everytime she has anything in diaper and they always smelled strongly of the urine.we use swaddlers only|`|pXSKSS3daa	We also got some from our baby shower and tried them out with our son. I have never bought a pack since. They leaked horribly with Noah and just didn't seem to fit right.    That's just ME, though, and my son. For some parents they work fine. Try them out and see if they work. If they do, great, because that will save you money on diapers. Target's brand is what worked for us up until now. Our son is almost 10 months old and we just switched to Pampers cruisers the other day because he's moving around A LOT more and the Target brand diapers started to leak a bit too much for us.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I used them when my daughter was older and had no problems with them at all.|`|rjVALevtaa	I've used them a few times, never had any problems. Keep in mind, though, that newborn diapers tend to leak in the beginning no matter what brand you use.|`|SeAvCGlYaa	Congrats on your baby, first of all.    Secondly, hon, if you can get any kind of diaper for free, TAKE 'EM!! Believe me, diapers are sooooooooooo expensive. Not trying to scare you here, but the reality is, if you can get any brand for half off or at a great discount or even free, you shouldn't hesitate.     Personally, as far as this particular brand goes, I didn't like them at all. They seemed scratchy and stiff to me, not very soft at all. I thought they didn't fit as snugly, either, which bothered me. However, I wasn't the one actually wearing the diapers, so what really counted was the baby didn't seem to mind them at all. No rashes or complaints. So, I continued to use them.|`|IJaNGHcwaa	Oh lord no my son got a horrible rash from them and they always leak..
dA9Tcp8Qaa	??....showing your mom she ruined your life is very immature. So what she does this. Don't pay any attention to it....grow up. ??|`|yAsLhdp2aa	I am sure she is very stressed out..this economic situation we are in right now and the threat of losing our very birth rights (constitutional law) is tearing families apart and turning good people into bad. I dont know you personally but its kind of universal...just try to use her as an example in your life...good or bad, you will know who you want to be like and who you do not. You only have a couple years left to be in her household..you'll make it. not to discount emotional abuse, it is just as severe and brutal as physical.|`|RESEYeVlaa	I would give so much to hear my mom yell at me again...  she died a few months back.    i doubt what your telling us is the full story. I doubt she yells at you because you are a perfect little angel.  Tell her you love her and do what she says.|`|A5mkPwIqaa	It sounds like your mom could realllly use some family counseling. She can't be very happy with the situation either, but she probably doesn't know how to change. Is there another adult you could talk to about it, who could encourage her to see a family counselor? You need a mediator, someone who is unbiased and can help you both get along.    Edit: Tell your counselor! That's what she's there for. It doesn't matter if you feel fine when you're seeing her, she's there to help you through whatever challenges you're having. :)|`|fxxLgQrdaa	just think 2 more years and ull be out of the house and in college|`|4WWVsABqaa	tell her how much it hurts you. you shouldnt have to go threw that...and dont listen to those people who comment this only trying to hurt you. may i suggest mocing in with a family member or something? maybe she needs mental help.|`|h0lCiLH8aa	That's a tough one.  I don't know your mom.  I like to think all parents love their children and have the best of intentions but honestly some don't.  Lot's of parents don't give a crap about there children.  They are so busy self servicing there own needs and desirers that they often forget their children are actually people also.    I hope your mom isn't one of these people, but even if she is you have to be strong and learn from her mistakes.  Your young and soon will be out own your own.   If you have kids just remember the way you felt as you wrote this post.  Try to love, respect and not make the mistakes your mom has.   Life is short so try not to let things get you down.|`|2BoEjhA3aa	well u should tell her how you feel.
n4eHbm6baa	unfortunately the judge isnt going to care weather you went to parenting class or college or if u get good grades. my ex never went to any doctors appts for our baby and he still got partial custody of her even though ive been her primary care giver. the only good thing u have going for u is it sounds like he knew u were pregnant and didnt finacially contribute to it or the baby afterword. but the best thing u can do is not bad mouth or sound negative towards him infront of the judge and or mediator (which you'll probly have to go to) and try not to deny him visits with the child now because then her can say your allianating the baby and thats illegal and judges dont take it lightly.|`|Z0KQenm9aa	wish i could help you but you sound like you have it pretty much together... just make sure you never badmouth the daddy to your baby and keep the door open for liberal visitation... my sister kept the door open unless the dad was on drugs but she did badmouth the daddy and it is hurtful to the children. God bless you girl.|`|ffAnyNk2aa	Bring an attorney.
dPmK83UYaa	If she moves with you set up lots of rules and guidelines and have her pay rent. Make sure she knows it's only temporary! As she needs to maybe make a quick transition to learning to do it all herself. If u are watching the kids make sure she pays for that. She needs to learn that that is the way real life is.|`|G50ucmllaa	I am going to be very frank...I think she is using you.  You said you work.  So what is the difference in you working and she?  Isn't this more distracting and confusing to the little ones than just being in a new place?|`|a95e6422ed636e86d21c41cf555820beaa	Hmm. Most people put up with it for their children. But your sister needs to spend time with her children. Perhaps relocating would be better for her. You need to tell her that, although you're happy to help once in a while, you have a child of your own and need to de-stress every once in a while.|`|f27ac1251735cd69b33683d739d56466aa	As a mother you have your own responsibilities. You aren't your sister's keeper.  If you want to continue to take care of her children I hope it isn't for free.  She needs to compensate you for all this time you are spending taking care of her children otherwise she is just taking advantage of the situation.
VS8mactUaa	I think alot of them are maybe beacause when they were growing up it wasnt consideed proper, Personally I think Everyone has a right to knowledge,  And its not embarrasing and they shouldnt be afraid. Honesty is a wicked tool. :)|`|2FhPfxnsaa	I know my parents never really addressed it deeply and I am a smoker and a rare drinker/drug user and I'm just a teenager.

7xit1ogxaa	You will be 5 weeks tomorrow.  Pregnancy is counted from the first day of your last period, not when you conceived. Congrats!|`|aGdGNGbpaa	your 4 weeks going on 5 weeks my last day of my period was dec 27th and i found out im pregnant :) 5 weeks and 2 days at that so ur just shortly after me :) congrats.|`|j73bqzRAaa	your doctor should be able to tell by ultrasound|`|qX8EFFVtaa	You count from Dec. 30th.
hyN684hxaa	Look for a song he will like. If he likes vacuums than try looking for ocean sounds, or a noise maker, my dad still can't sleep with out one. Try warm milk but I could recommend a billion things but he's still your kid with his own unique quirks that only deep down a parent knows, whether its the way you have to breath as you hold him or rubbing his ears, sorry bud but you need to figure it out|`|sOVc08Dsaa	The age your baby is in.. misses the sounds of the womb.. holding them can take away that lonely feeling.. you can never spoil a child by holding them when they are little infants.. it actually teaches them to be independent.. what you can do is give him a nice warm shower.. he can be itchy somewhere and can not express it.. check his cloths .. the tag could be irritating him.. best bet is to do the bath or run a small fan so he can hear some sound... you can purchase a device for babies that attaches to the crib.. it plays sounds like heart beating and rain.. that might work.. but for now bath your baby and hold him close..|`|c5LNAi9Caa	Oh yes the ole vacuum cleaner trick. Yes, it is the "white noise" that will stop a baby from crying that is why those white noise machines are great to put next to their bed. They have ocean sounds or rain or wind, etc. You can get one online or I hear brookstone stores carry them. If the baby is fed, dry, burped, and all that, the white noise machine should help a lot and it's a lot more pleasant than the vacuum cleaner. Maybe then, everyone will get some sleep! good luck!|`|c159efe1b44ee4b1b369d779c1d19521aa	Most babies get fussy when they are sleepy. That's normal. My son likes to sit up on my knee while i bounce him a little before he will fall asleep. You just have to do what works to get them to go for awhile :-)|`|6HX4u0SRaa	is it usually dead quiet when you put him to bed if so then he needs some kind of noise to go to sleep not really loud just something to calm him some babies like the sound of the tv or music or traffic if you take that away then they fuss and can't get to sleep|`|ggETPqedaa	It's just white noise you are causing. Have you tried putting a radio in your baby's room? Try music or even simply try some static on some stations. The sound of the vacuum cleaner is simply causing all the other noises to go away for him and he is concentrating on that one noise.|`|AUWZJ8maaa	For me I always stand and just like go side to side and it really Calms the baby down a lot.
kZRTekoJaa	it took my son what seemed like forever before he started pooping on the potty. he even got so constipated from holding it in that he became afraid to even poop in a diaper b/c it hurt so bad. so first off you should make sure she is comfortable pooping even if it means she is pooping in a diaper.  what finally "worked" for my son was just making him sit on the potty until he pooped. ignoring his screams and cries as harsh as that may sound. when i first tried to do so it became a battle of wills and his stubbornness prevailed, but eventually he pooped. then repeated his screaming next night, but eventually he pooped. as the nights went on he screamed less before pooping. and now, no more screaming. i think he just needed to see that pooping on the potty was ok and not going to hurt or scare him. and now he is comfortable with it. of course we cheered for him when he pooped, and gave him a treat (candy, stickers, whatever) and we let him know how proud we were so encouragement is a must b/c kids that young just want to please their parents.   if she has to go but the urge goes away when she sits on the toilet, she is probably holding it in. let her sit there for as long as it takes (if you have that long) even if she is sitting in there for an hour or more. give her books to read to occupy her, or something similar. my son is a super picky eater so giving him a diet full of fiber was hard but they have great tasting cereal bars with extra fiber in them at walmart in the same aisle as other fiber supplements. also, try a kid safe stool softener. not a laxative since they can cause dependency. i found one from the whole foods store but it was expensive. maybe give her a stool or something to prop her feet on so she can sit more comfortably.    it's very frustrating, i know and it requires more patience then most parent's have lol so good luck, i hope i've helped.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Put a little basket of "potty" books in there. Could be the big toilet is just a little scary at first. Try cracking the door and sitting outside,but not in there with her. Someone watching her might make her unconsciously nervous.|`|hHQIUrNjaa	thats weird paristalisis, but let her watch tv on the toilet or something.|`|qGaTcEliaa	You should try something with colors kids love colors and attractive pictures like cartoons.|`|m2aznd8xaa	my little one is 20 months and is fully trained but when she goes poo i have to sit on the floor facing her and hug her and let her lean her head on me as she pushes away. i get the worst end of it because i get to smell it lol but at least she goes that way so thats  the only way she goes poo. with peeing she goes on her own. but for some reason she likes me to hold her while she goes poo. maybe  its just more comforting that way for her and she feels secure. i would just tell her mommy hold you and you push and she would. after she goes i have to take it away super fast because when she sees her poo she starts freaking out saying eeewww . so try it maybe it will help a little. good luck.

bd3d8e1920d596e5bd7fe432bdd8c312aa	Interaction, books, flash cards and playing are the key to kids learning. Any system may work:    1. As long as your child is ready for it - otherwise it'll be very frustrating for both you and your child.  2. You need to spend time with your child and interacting with them.    I use Galloping Minds DVDs and Flash Cards - and that worked. The flash cards are beautiful and my kids loved them.    Heres the website:    www.gallopingminds.com    Heres a discounted site:    www.gallopingminds.com/shop_discount.h...|`|DLl7qEWTaa	A friend bought this for my son and it was a wast of money. It is just pic the word of the pic and some one saying the word after about 5 or 6 things it repeats and repeats. There is not enough action to keep my sons interest. He watched it the first time for about 2 mins and that was it. Now if I put it in he will say NO NOT WATCH IT and he will not. He just turned 20 mths so I don't know if it will be any better when he is older.|`|dCewrtXaaa	I don't think you really need to buy a program. In 1964 I checked Glenn Doman's book "How To Teach Your Baby To Read" out of the library for free, made my own materials, and taught my two-year-old to read. The idea is that kids have the cognitive ability to read years before their eyes are able to focus on book-size type. So you make the letters very large, start with sight reading, and basically the kids teach themselves to read from there. They still can't really focus on book-size type till they are about five, but some of them seem to enjoy showing off with word cards or large-type stories when the grown-ups ooh and aah.     It is not exactly "helpful" at age two, but since it is more like a game than the way it is taught in school, they often pick it up readily and have fun with it. If they don't take a liking to the game, it would probably be counter-productive to push it. Some kids are shy and don't appreciate excessive expectations at that age, and that is normal too. If you are not too invested in the process, it probably will take some pressure off your toddler. You might want to play with library books before buying the program. Anything heavily advertised is rather suspect in my opinion. And it is never too soon to develop the weekly library habit. Toddler reading has to be backed up with the parent reading to them aloud daily.    For us the secret was to follow her own interests and let her pick out magazine illustrations for the words she wanted to learn, then later the books she wanted to read. Two-year-olds love choices. She also loved dictating stories to me, to be written down in large letters, illustrated and made into books, which she could read because they were her own words and ideas.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I saw the infomercial and my boyfriend has been bugging me about it.  I haven't even had my baby.  I dunno, I might try it.  I learned how to read when i was three from my mom just reading to me every day.  I was always ahead in my reading level and did very well with language arts.  You just have to spend time every day reading and showing your kid how to read.|`|0uhRgfcsaa	i saw an infomercial this morning and one lady was teachin an 8 month old to read. why should your child be able to read before he can speak? lol. but seeing yours is two, i think it looks like a great program. good luck if you try :)

4kfljeIGaa	Good and effective discipline is ALWAYS based in love.  Yet, I know how much children can test your patience.  I have two.  Here are some ideas:    1. Time-outs when necessary, one minute for each year of the child's life (i.e., 3 years=3 minutes of time-out).      2. Use statements like, "What you did was bad," instead of "You're a bad boy (or girl)."  This reinforces the idea that the youngster is still loved despite an occasional outburst, yet that he or she should be expected to behave appropriately and take responsibility for his or her own actions.      3. I've never spanked either of my daughters, but my parents did spank me occasionally whenever I did something dangerously naughty, like running in the street.  For them the key was danger.  Spanking advocates always say, "never, ever spank in anger," and I agree with that.      Hope those suggestions helped!  Best wishes to your friend!|`|E0KjlJLjaa	******* desciplene is acceptable|`|zu7lHvCdaa	who is to say what is acceptable? i believe only the parent decides that unless of course it causing the children harm. Instead of punishing we should be disciplining. talk to them let them know why they are being reprimanded. One thing i know is that you have to stay consistent in ur disciplining and get them into an active sport or an activity to act as an outlet for all that energy. There are many ways that's just my insight on things. Also try watching nanny 911 I love that show!  I have a friend with the same problem but I would never tell her how to raise or discipline her children. If they didn't ask 4 help and u want to hint it to them try telling them something like 'you should put him into sports with all that energy he has to burn!' or something light and spirited.|`|mrYCeWoMaa	nothing is. why do you think the prison's and jails are over maxed, kids are running house holds, teenagers are getting pregnant, teens and such are getting high, drinking, stealing cars, getting shot. because there is no discipline. Parents can't do it anymore because they are afraid that they will go to jail.|`|Z0KQenm9aa	screw the society, what does God say... He is the manufacturer ... and you dont PUNISH you correct children firmly in love... you dont scream at them and tell them they are bad... you tell them that God loves them and you love them but what they did was wrong and you use the rod of correction, on their bottom. a smooth ruler type object that is firmly applied to the seat of the pants in private... also dont blab your mouth about how you raise your family... do it Gods way or you are wasting your time and doing damage to your child.|`|MQKBTtG5aa	Wrap rope around the kids arms and legs, put a gag in their mouth, and lock 'em in a dark room...

jcdey9cgaa	be consistent.  If he is for example, jumping on the couch, say "If you jump on the couch one more time you are telling me that you want to go to time out (or whatever discipline you choose) and if and when he does it again send him to time out or whatever you have told him that he was asking for.  He will do it once or twice but will catch on very soon and when he realizes that by doing what he is doing he is asking for the punishment an it is in his control he will stop.  This works everytime  my kids.  However, if when they do whatever it is and you don't follow through, forget it.  You lost the game.  You have to be consistent|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Spank his butt, he'll stop misbehaving.|`|6DWJAaSeaa	What the parent says GOES, do not back down, do not give them more then 3 chances to stop doing what they are doing wrong. when your child does something wrong take 2 seconds, get down to their level and explain calmly why they shouldn't do what they are doing, if they continue take away a privilege and stand your ground, (under no circumstances may they have that privilege back that day ) if you allow it they will walk all over you!!    Stand your ground, say what you mean and do what you say... be consistent always

r07BwhO1aa	Look, grades are important, now wether or not they are going about it the right way that is a different question.    No you can not divorce your parents unless you have money for a lawyer and court costs and documented proof of extreme abuse.     B+ is not a bad grade unless you and your parents both know that you can do better.      Good Luck.|`|Qe9y6MnTaa	B+ is a great grade first of all. To get a scholarship into a top college, I would say that you would need A's though. ANd no, you cannot divorce your parents, but if you have proof of them hitting you(video or witness or recording) then you can show it to a cop or someone, and they may put you in foster care most likely. Sorry about your situation hun, hope this helps make things easier :D|`|wE5JMeesaa	What should you do?  Get good grades, get a good scholarship, go to school--move out of your parent's house...    B+ isn't a good grade.  I wouldn't say it's a bad grade, but it's not good.  I wouldn't be jumping for joy over my kid's B.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	I think a B+ is excellent. I don't know what grade you are in but I'm in College and I celebrate when I get a B because its so hard to when you really get in to college. I would talk to someone, like your school councilor or some one reliable like that about your parents. If they are hitting your because of your grades or something petty like that then they will get into some serious trouble. Also abuse doesn't always come physically it can also be verbal.|`|K9G6n17Oaa	First off, your parents shouldn't be hitting you or needing to hit you. If you feel that you are being abused (and careful about this, look up some legal definitions) than you may want to speak to a school counselor to see what avenues you have. You may just need some family counseling or some way to coomunicate your feelings to your parents. Now there are cultural considerations so not knowing your background it is difficult to give generic advice. However, abuse is abuse.    Now as far as grades, yes they are important, but not by themselves. You have to have balance in your life. In my opinion, there are many other things you have to learn at times outside of the classroom in order for you to have a balanced and fruitful life. Some examples:     Do you have social skills? -Being the smartest person in the room means nothing if you are unable to connect and communicate your thoughts and ideas.    Can you handle confrontation and trying situations that don't involve a book?- Do you have enough experience dealing with difficult people?    Can you multi-task things going on in life?- Can you get your studying done and still be involved in other things like a social life, volunterering, or working?    Grades just say that you can study, take tests, and reproduce information that the teachers want you to.    It is great that your parents are focused on your grades and push you. They want the best for you. Just make sure that you are developing in other ways as well. If your parents are abusing you and you turn into somebody that hates life or worse becomes and abuser yourself, then those good grades won't mean much in the long term. Just my opinion.|`|wBpennsMaa	Grades do matter. A B+ is not a bad grade.
lDqn5KICaa	I have a 2 year-old and a 5 month-old, and my house is always a mess. It seems like I just get something picked up, and it's a mess withing minutes. We have a dog who sheds, and as soon as I vacuum the play area, she rolls all over the rug and messes it up again. There are piles of laundry, the kitchen is in a constant state of chaos, and my toddler's room has now become riddled with toys.    I'm just trying not to worry too much about it, but it does bother me most days. The only advice I can give, since this is what I hear from others, is to enjoy the time with your kids and not worry too much. You won't look back and say, "I wish I had spent more time doing dishes," but you will look back fondly on the time spent with your babies. It's hard enough to make quality time with your babies when you suddenly have two of them. I was able to give much more to my daughter when it was just the two of us, but now I'm barely making it through most days. I can't spend the time worrying about anything but the kids.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	Put in a video once or twice a week for the three year old, just to get a few of the necessary  things done. Put the younger baby in an exer- saucer in the room with you. I just roll with the punches. I clean house and shower when my husband gets home from work. If my house gets out of control during the week, I send my husband to his mother's with our daughter on Saturday and go on a cleaning spree, making sure I add the time in to take a nice hot bubble bath.|`|FSZIzDsPaa	I have found that, you HAVE to cut corners. I dont turn the clothes right side out when i wash them anymore. little things like that really save a lot of time in the long run. You really just have to let go, and enjoy the time you have with your babies, instead of worrying about a messy house. i know its hard, but it can be done :)|`|eaFgbPD7aa	It's ok to have a messy house and it will get easier. I have an 8 yr old and almosy 3 yr old, dad lives almost 2 hours away, I work full time and go to school and still juggle it all. It will all work itself out in time, sounds crazy but jsut get a lil routine going like making a calendar, but remeber let somethings go, its ok. Leftovers are ok and vacuuming can wait. Good luck|`|p07RwZK2aa	hey,   I have two 6 year olds, a 3 year old and a 7 week old baby.     I am obsessive with keeping a tidy home!   I just do all the chores as I go along. I put aside a couple of hours in the morning to get things sorted. During this time my toddler plays with his train set or watches t.v, and sometimes I put my baby girl in the sling or I put her on her play mat until she cries.     My 3 year old also goes to nursery four days a week. Is your toddler not old enough yet? In the Uk they start nursery at age 2 and a half.|`|Isswygkpaa	Have your 3 year old lay down wwit you n watch a movie, I'm not sure how its done I jus lost my baby|`|QY10Hmq7aa	I feel the same way... I'd like to know too!|`|TycCeqtaaa	make a list starting from the most important chore to the less important. then do one or two things on that list a day and have your husband do two more when he comes home.if you guys have enough money then pay someone to come and clean your house for a day while you relax and be with your children and get the most rest as you can.|`|7Raehh4daa	I have found that if I awake an hour before anyone else, I have a great day.  (I have a 3 year old, 2 year old, and a 5 month old.)  Even if I'm extremely tired at 6 am, it's worth it to tough it out and get an early start.  This way, the dishes can be put away and laundry started without any distractions.  It also gives you some much needed "alone" time ( I spend it in prayer and reading).  If you can be mentally prepared and committed in the morning to be the best mom to your children, when they wake up you will not be overwhelmed!  Waking up to a crying baby can be a not-so-good way to start your day.  :)  Best wishes!|`|pJpk1aXFaa	im not a mom, but i have my nephews and niece a lot and i have lazy peopel that live in my house.  what i do is i vaccuum 2-3 times a week or as needed and dusting. i wash sheets once a week.  i have two big laundry days (mon and fri) and in between laundry i play game with the kids or chase or something.  while i clean the kitchen the kids are coloring and when the oldest gets home from school, i have the 4 year old do hw (she has a workbook and she does 1-2 pages a day).the 1 year old i think has outgrown his naps. the only thing i dont do is cook.
23MPcnNqaa	I smoked for the first 3 months of my pregnancy (I didn't know I was pregnant).   Quitting smoking is a very difficult thing to do.  But as soon as I found out that I was pregnant, I switched to Lights and tried my hardest to cut back on how many cigarettes I smoked daily.  Which led me to quitting completely.    Smoking while pregnant can be very harmful to the fetus.  If your friend is pregnant and a smoker, tell her to read up on the side effects and what it can do to her unborn baby.|`|a40380daa8f8c7c0761b53d6ecfddb40aa	My mom smoked cigarettes with me.|`|vn0DHMXWaa	Yes, I did.

I was working a high stress job, but I wanted to quit for the baby. When I did my blood pressure went through the roof and my ob told me that I needed to smoke at least three a day to keep the baby from going into distress. Had I had a planned pregnancy, I would have quit beforehand though.|`|kFEx2Bx0aa	Probably, but once you become pregnant you make a choice, conscious or not, who's going to be more important? my want's and needs, or my childs?  She's obviously chosen herself.|`|GlzVQclpaa	I had this friend that smoked throught her pregnancy and then when the baby came her and her boyfriend and his friends would smoke around the baby. The baby died of SIDS when it was only 2 months old. It was the saddest funeral ever. I blame the cigarettes and them for smoking around the baby.|`|SEfiw9Pfaa	i smoke during my pregnancy the whole 9 months but i only had one here and there my son was very healthy|`|wE5JMeesaa	I think it's irresponsible to smoke or drink while pregnant.  I know several women who have.  They all have healthy babies--so I can't say much about the effects just yet, but I still think it's a horrible thing to risk.    That said, to the person above me, smoking doesn't cause SIDS and maybe your friend really needed some comfort at the loss of her baby, rather than your unwarranted and presumptuous accusations as to why her baby died.    You should really be ashamed of yourself.|`|UiQ6V377aa	Cigarette smoke leads to lower birth weight and premature birth in SOME babies. Of course it varies with how much someone smokes and during which months. The first 4months are the most crucial,so smoking then will have worst effects then smoking from 5-9months.    EITHER way you should never smoke during pregnancy. I think women who do should be charged with child abuse. It is not healthy for you so it is not healthy for a baby. STAY AWAY FROM THE CIGS!|`|jQwYoRCXaa	i have 2 babies and am pregnant and i smoked through all of my pregnancies. i believe that smoking is a lot healthier for the baby then stress...however i do not smoke around my babies. it may cause lower birth weights but it didnt with mine, my daughter was 7 11 and my son was 7 5.|`|wmXb8A8maa	as soon as i found out i was pregnant...i pretty much quit right then and there...I had one smoke shortly after i found out, and the whole time i pictured my unborn fetus taking a drag..I felt horribly guilty and stopped right then and never picked one up again... How could mothers not have any guilt smoking while pregnant..so selfish they are..poor babies...|`|DLl7qEWTaa	I smoked over a pack a day till I was about 6 1/2 mths I didn't know I was pregnant. When I found out I did cut it back to only about 4 or 5 a day. When my son was born he was 8 lbs 6 ozs and healthy as a horse and never cried for the nicotine. The nurse at the hospital were I delivered said he might cry for it and if he did let him have a binky for comfort but he was great.

I wouldn't get too stressed out about it unless there are signs of a learning disability. If you are doing your part as far as reading to your child, teaching, and communicating with your child while they are developing then it shouldn't be a problem.    If everything is normal I would think a kid would start to be able to read simple words around kindergarden-first grade. My oldest son read when he was 4. My youngest, when he was 5 and 1/2.     If your kid gets into 2nd grade and higher I would start thinking about it a little.

After reading the story and looking at the pictures of Brandon, do you still think your parents are wrong ?    Brandon was a beautiful 15 year old Canadian boy.  He also was our neighbour.  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher Canada )|`|2rG7rYOWaa	tough mom|`|KbPrPuvhaa	yeah|`|VyuseWb2aa	Yes, it is. Respect her rules and limit your video game time for an hour or less. That's how people become addicts.|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	wow! thts a little too much! how in the world are you going to survive!!!|`|ccU5FNsmaa	ya you did the crime now do the time sorry hun|`|Uy8ntukjaa	I think a month is a little excessive, however I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson the first time she grounded you. I suggest you talk with her about your actions and come to a reasonable agreement about what time you will go to sleep each night. If you respect her rules, you'll find that you don't end up grounded.|`|2H6j4j8taa	No, I don't think it is a fair punishment. If I did that (well I wouldn't, but if I did) I might get banned for a day at the most. Probably not even banned, just discouraged from playing.     Was it a school night or not, though? If it was a school night then I think a suitable punishment might be like 3-5 days.|`|lu4fEFVLaa	Grounding you for a month?...How old are you? I believe your mom had a very good reason ,not only the video games.Anyway keeping up till 5am, just for a video game is worthless. Pay more attention on ur studies.How could you handle the next day?..  If you are really crazy over the video games..ask mom's permission first. And no one i mean NO ONE will ever say that your mom was unfair.   Take things eazy...Mom is always correct nd she loves her kids darely...|`|FiUprYsvaa	It's a little extreme.|`|8idhxYHaaa	not for a month. just take away the games 4 a week. and what are you doing playing halo till 5?? go read a book and expand your mind

I went through the checkout procedure until I saw the option of where to choose shipping and "United States" was one of them.

VVV7DSITaa	I love the name Jared.|`|Elxuvon8aa	I like it I really like double letters so I would spell it Jarred|`|32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	Jared is a nice Name,and I really like it..|`|4fIE3Eb2aa	Damien would be better.    Jared reminds me of the asshole that used to annoy me in middle school.    xx :)|`|SaHt5GXeaa	I LOVE IT.|`|GAj9hwWvaa	I like Garret better, I also really like Grant and Joel for a "strong, loving guy."|`|tHEBPDenaa	It's okay. If the character is lovable then the name will be perfect!|`|7Raehh4daa	The first thing that comes to mind is the Subway guy, then the jewelers commercials.  That's my honest first reaction.  If you like it, go for it!  J names are great.|`|0OsqCShHaa	i like it?|`|fZjHAxwHaa	Jared sounds like a very easygoing, playful guy (:    Really cute name too, my bestfriend is dating a Jared.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Looks better spelled Jarod. Lead characters are always more intriguing when they have uncommon names.|`|Qlx1r9XSaa	Sorry, but I really don't like the name Jared. "He went to Jared" haha
E2UXN7J1aa	During early pregnancy my breasts were extremely tender. Much more than the usually are before a period.|`|kLPaq30Eaa	Pregnancy can make breasts very tender and sore. And yes, you can have sore breasts before your missed period as well.|`|OOptQPnFaa	yeah|`|o1yy6KABaa	apparently they can - for me i get the hard road  and they are sore 3 weeks out of four in a month :(   It could be a sign of pregnancy or PMS.|`|5cSD8mcZaa	They become like separate entities with a life of their own. Remember your romance novels!     Seriously, they do get much more tender when you are pregnant.|`|Ndw34J0daa	My breasts were sore 5 days before I expected my period and have not stopped since. I'm 10 weeks along now and invested in a couple of cotton, no underwire, comfy bras for sleeping.
o1yy6KABaa	You could be testing too early - it depends on how many days your cycle usually is. I would wait another week and test agan with first morning urine to get an accurate reading..or if you are going to the gyno tomorrow ask for a blood test which can detect pregnancy earlier.  baby dust to you!!!|`|uuceuyRyaa	Might be    Might not be,    maybe it's just stress.|`|mY19PPlIaa	Hey are questions are very similar. I will be having a blood test done this week , I would recommend you take one too. Wishing you baby dust**********************|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	yes|`|qkldiEwuaa	uh well if its negative then ull be fine. if ur that worried maybe u should consider seeing a doctor. stress does make ur period late... maybe its just stress... relax.  do u feel sick or anything, feel different. ???|`|HP1I87RDaa	Since your period is in abnormal cycle and you had unprotected sex, it probably means your pregnant. There is a very high chance you are. Might be stress but im 90 pct sure your pregnant. And yes, it does mean you tested to early. Theres a reason why a box of pregnant tester comes in a box of 10 or something. I wish you best at luck!
7Raehh4daa	I'm so sorry to hear this.  I would suggest staying away from him unless you're accompanied by another adult.  People who abuse substances can be very unpredictable.  For your own safety, I would not make contact unless chaperoned.  Remember that your heavenly Father cares for you beyond fully understanding.|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	If hes is an abusive father and hasn't changed, stay away from him, if he has changed and is trying to apologize, and is broke and in need of money, I would forgive him if he could realize his mistakes. I think you should do what ever you feel you want to do, don't take someones advice just because you think its good advice, do what you really feel, if you make the wrong decision you will regret it. Do what you feel you want to do.|`|af43e8f6af5feac294cdbceeba67f982aa	I think you should talk to your mother about getting your named change. Also if you do no want to deal with your father at all-break all ties with him.  Along with your mother have him give up his rights as a father to you.  You have a reason not to want any part of him or just never speak to him all together.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	You need to not expose yourself to him if you don't think you can handle it. Just don't put yourself in situations where you will be around him. If you want to change your name then you should talk to your mother about it and see what she says. You can always do it when you're older so there isn't any rush.|`|Wt81sGW5aa	do wut u think is right|`|5IA9Qe2aaa	call steve wilkos.|`|y93pJSi1aa	That seems like a very difficult situation, some type of intervention maybe?|`|3GZz5iNFaa	Wait till your 18 atleast, so maybe mom can get some money out of him for you.  Just don't associate with him, if you don't have to.
VHHis05Naa	I picture several different people:  a cute little girl with blondish curls, a teenager with honey-colored hair, a mom with short brown hair and an older woman with grandchildren all around her.|`|Elxuvon8aa	Claire is kind of hard to me I like Clarissa with the nick name rissa|`|GAj9hwWvaa	Claire, for some reason, has always really annoyed me. I knew a girl when I was younger and she was a skanky stoner. A lot of people seem to think classy and rich, I don't reminds me of trashy trying to be rich!|`|HivQdKgwaa	Claire reminds me of someone who is sweet and innocent .|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	pretty stuck up   preppy  think she knws everything|`|TVC3mAP7aa	The first thing that came to mind was Claire from the Breakfast Club (Molly Ringwald's character).  :)|`|Uy8ntukjaa	I see a pretty, preppy, dainty girl. One who is classy but possibly snobby too.|`|4fIE3Eb2aa	Claire - Girly! :)     I actually love the name Claire. It's very cute and lovable sounding.  |`|uDqZ78Kfaa	I think of the store Claire's so pink, preppy, girly.|`|nCKdkYSyaa	Straight brown hair, blue eyed/Maybe glasses but has an artistic attitude and sweet and loves nature..|`|gu1sEQN8aa	Really pretty name. I picture a quiet, polite and smart girl kind of like a princess maybe a little girly :)|`|5G9m8ZAHaa	I think of the Cosby show lol.    Claire was the mom on there.|`|Qlx1r9XSaa	I really like the name Claire, but I prefer it as a middle name. It just doesn't seem complete enough to be a first name.
MCTyWCu2aa	Well if you were pregnant you wouldnt have very heavy bleeding unless you misscarried.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Sorry to say, but it sounds like you might be miscarrying. Or you're not pregnant and never were. Don't really know what else to say to it, except to go see a doctor. Best of luck to you.|`|vrt8bMzVaa	no sounds like a gross period you may have cysts on your ovaries|`|7kGwZ1Ntaa	Go to the doctor!|`|9op65iQVaa	You almost had me saying you were pregnant until the heavy bleeding part.  That doesnt sound too good.  that might be your period?
WWcaKZ7Qaa	Okay, I have never done this personally but, I am a Massage Therapist, so maybe I can help. There are plenty of areas on the body ( medial ankles, deep between shoulder blades, etc.) that reportedly can induce labor and are supposed to be avoided when working on pregnant women. however, I have had several friends who asked me at the end to massage these areas to help move things along. It didn't work for any of them! And that was with at least four people I know. And that was with me working on those areas for a very long time.    That might work if baby is definitely ready to come, but I just don't think it works well.|`|91ACjB5eaa	try saying real loud "ITS TIME TO COME OUT BABY!!!"...lol im just kidding.  my aunt said she drinks; but i wouldn't!! b.c it cant be good for the baby.   if your man and you ain't talking you could try a dildo that's the way i would do it. sex work's  I hope you have a healthy baby|`|Ghts0pt4aa	have you tried to pump brest milk some people say that that works|`|LJgAwJxEaa	Don't be selfish. The baby could be at risk if you do that! just listen to your doctor and get induced.|`|u0mZAPuDaa	I drank castor oil. I was 37 weeks and two days. I drank 3 tablespoons of castor oil in a glass of grape juice.    An hour and a half later my water broke and I had her the next day.    The side effect is some diarrhea, so my physician said if I tried to make sure I drank some extra water.  I had some loose stool, but nothing horrible.    My doctor also warned me, if she wasn't completely ready to come out they castor oil wouldn't work!    Good Luck!|`|j4lcMGmiaa	I don't know of any magic way to naturally induce a woman...seeing as none of the suggestions worked for me...but I can tell you unless its medically necessary I will never be medically induced again.  Reading that you are dilated to 3 and 80% effaced I'm gonna go with your doctor thinks it medically necessary.  Most women when they have reached passed 2 - 3centimeters they either progress very slowly over the next day or so...don't pass go, and head right to 10centimeters, or they stall and it could be days.  Stalling labor is usually not a problem unless it causes stress on your baby.  Before you decide anything I would have a serious talk with your doctor and if your baby is fine, you are fine, and he doesn't for see any complications tell him/her you would like to wait.  Good luck.
c3d9621b66bbf4d52837a662d4822489aa	It's always 50/50..but it is the sperm that decides what the sex is, not your body.|`|VHHis05Naa	That person is a jerk who had no idea what they are talking about.  You have just as much chance at having a girl as you do a boy.  I hope you get your girl!|`|FtBqmFDEaa	there is absolutely no way of telling, its a 50/50 chance each time, you get what comes along.|`|phwivaqNaa	No!  That makes no sense!  The sex of the baby is determined by which sperm gets there fastest.  Ive hear your chance for a boy are greater the closer you are to ovulation because they swim faster, but die faster.    That would be like saying your husband produces 75% male sperm/25% female sperm!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	There is always a 50% chance of either sex.    Just because you have boys or girls doesn't make it more likely to be that sex    People told my i would have a boy, as my husbands family is 7boys and only one girl - but we are having a girl|`|e1da3ff675cf372977d80c07d733416baa	its a 50/50 with each baby you have. The chances don't go up because you already have 2 other boys|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hey i have never heard that! your 50/50 on the sex. its determined by the stronger gene not by if you have had girls or boys in previous pregnancies. that has absoloutly nothing to do with it. good luck.|`|JZnRxPUCaa	I would say that is not accurate at all! I would say you should be sure to get a girl this time around :)  But for fun what I did when I was seeking the gender of my unborn baby I googled "chinese gender chart"   and it is just a fun way to figure out what you might be having.  It is based on your age and the month of conception.  It isn't an exact science, but it was right with me and everyone I know closest to me. ( quite crazy how accurate it is )  But for fun, I would check it out, it could better prepare you for what your baby will be!
Mq9LeKfuaa	i found out i was pregnant with baby   3 two days after i gave blood, i passed out while donating . and it was because i was pregnant, but you should be fine, im in my 8 month and this has been a fairly healthy pregnancy.  but if it turns out you are just make sure you let your doctor know cause it can affect the blood test they do. i let mine know and my levels came out low and they knew it was from donating. good luck and baby dust headed your way|`|VHHis05Naa	You should be fine.  I'm pregnant and they take blood at nearly every prenatal visit.  Your blood has replenished itself by now.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	Everything will be fine. Once you are pregnant you're a pin cushion anyways for giving blood for test etc. You're fine:) :) :)|`|7SKVCPcSaa	you should have waited until after the baby if you are TTC.. what if you are pregnant. you need to let your doctor know ASAP as soon as you find out if you are pregnant. just so he can keep an eye out.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	i dont think you will lose your baby or anything bad will happen. i think if your pregnant everything will be fine. good luck.|`|8ndWUWxRaa	The amount that they take while donating blood is not enough to affect the chance of pregnancy. Your period doesnt get any less flow if you donate so the implantation should not be affected. They would advise against it in the pre-screen if there were issues. But good luck and I hope you are preggo!|`|I08pH9Byaa	You should be fine.  Be sure to take your prenatals (with iron.)  Watch for symptoms of anemia.  Shortness of breath, paleness.  It will affect you- not the baby. [edit:  If it affects anyone it will be you and not the baby.] The baby will take what it needs from you one way or the other.   It is something you need to mention to your doctor if/when you find you are pregnant.  And I would mention it to them, before I donated again to see what he/she recommends.  It may be better for you to donate platlets.  Takes a lot longer, helps lots of people- especially cancer patients- and your body recovers much faster.  You can normally donate every 2 weeks.   Good Luck to you!  :)  Already thinking pregnant-  mmmmm- OJ and Pizza, think I will get the Pizza for dinner.

He1sIjeyaa	breastfeeding is best for the baby for as long as you can...at minimum you should do six months but if you cant than any bit is better than not at all.  its a wonderful experience for you and baby (for most of us nursing moms anyway) and you may find, like i have, that you wanna do it longer.  my son is nearing 6 months old now and i originally intended to do just 6 months but now that its approaching im still not sure about weaning him yet.  i work full time too and have to pump at work and that much is not so fun but i still don't wanna wean him yet... i keep reminding myself that its whats best for him. remember also that formula is NOT poison so even though breastfeeding is best its NOT bad to feed them formula!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I'm planning to breastfeed until at least 6 months.... i'm finding it really hard at the moment so I don't know for sure when i'll stop. It does annoy me when people tell me to formula feed, because even though I am finding it hard i'm not going to stop it. You're not wrong for thinking breastfeeding is better because it's proven that it is, but at the end of the day everyone is entitled to their own opinions on it.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	Breast feeding is the absolute best and healthiest thing you could do for you child.  You should breast feed for as long as you can.  If you have to go back to work start pumping your milk as soon as you start lactating and freeze it.  Hopefully you can get a supply stocked up to last you.  6 months is the least amount of time I would breast feed.  At 6 months your baby should be trying solid foods but not completely weaned from a bottle/breastfeeding until probably a year.  Just depends on what your Dr recommends time wise.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	he American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that babies be breastfed exclusively for the first six months, and then continue to be nursed at least for the first year and thereafter as long as the mother and child wish to continue.     it's not wrong to think that it is better, it's proven to be better. My mom is the same way about it, but I just ignore her. You will be fine and doing what you think is best. Plus, you will be saving a lot of money! :]|`|xGedX2rIaa	Breast feeding is BEST!!  I breast feed for 7 months, i had planned on doing it longer with at 7 months my son got sick and wouldnt drink much for a while and my milk dryed up.|`|d1d16f976ab4af78c06d3dc29088aab7aa	The longer the better.     I've heard up to 1 year or once the baby decides he no longer wants breast milk.  Once thing you can do is go on and off with Breastfeeding and bottlefeeding.  Or use a Breast Pump to get the baby used to the bottle.     That is my plan. pumping especially while at work and bottle feeding B/M.  One benefit of breastfeeding is that you loose the pregnancy weight a lot faster. =0)|`|HjyUoM8eaa	i believe the world health organization suggests one year.    but, it's totally up to you.  any amount of time that you are able to do it will benefit the baby.  many women struggle with having to go back to work and can't bf for longer than their maternity leave.    breast IS best....all the studies show that's true.  i say do it for as long as you can and then move on to bottle feeding.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	Your dad is right!  The longer the better.  and of course you are right, too - breastfeeding is best for your baby.    I breastfed all four of my children - but most didn't know I breastfed after the first few months.  You don't have to advertise it.  As for your mom - what can I say?  I'm glad you're more sensible.|`|oem5yEUDaa	You can breastfeed for as long as you want. When you start doing it your ideas about it might change and you may do it for longer or not as long as you had planned. It is true that breastfeeding is better for the baby but there is definately nothing wrong with formula feeding if you feel at some point you don't want to breastfeed anymore.|`|TJGpj9bgaa	Breastfeeding is best.  There are antibodies in breastmilk that can't be replaced by anything else.  I breastfed for 14 months.  I took great comfort in knowing that when my daughter had a little cold and wouldn't eat solids, she would still nurse and get an immunity boost.|`|7N7aEE73aa	i would breastfeed for about 6 months like everyone else has said but don't go overboard like this lady.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYN29bZ5d...
q7sgWqZ3aa	According to the Organization of Teratology Information Services (OTIS), a body temperature of 101o F and above can raise concerns during pregnancy. Some studies have shown an increased risk of birth defects in babies of women who had an increased body temperature during the first trimester of pregnancy.     You can raise your body temperature to this level by getting a fever, by exercising too strenuously, working outside on hot summer days, and so on.   You Should Not Use a Sauna, Hot Tub or Take Long Hot Baths   Hot tubs and hot baths have a tendency to raise your body temperature and therefore are to be avoided.     Before my pregnancy I liked to take very long hot baths. Now, I settle for a warm bath but sometimes I still have my relaxing hot baths while  I relax and read. Some say shower. I tried that once and the bottom of the shower got all slippery and I almost fell! So I'm sticking with my baths :).     A hot bath, which is not uncomfortable or scalding, is a safer way to relax. In a bath much of your upper body will remain out of the water, making you less likely to overheat. Additionally, the water in a bath begins to cool off, as opposed to a hot tub, further reducing any risk of overheating.    Regarding bubble baths, the concern is that in pregnancy, because of hormonal changes, our skin may develop new rashes or reactions to bubble baths that we've never experienced before. So bubble baths are also safe and fine in pregnancy as long as your skin is not reacting.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	As long as the water isn't scalding hot and as long as your water hasn't broken. Hot tubs, with high, prolonged temperatures, are not good; otherwise a hot bath is okay.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	My dr told me during the first trimester you want to be epically careful.  With that said she said it was fine for me to take a 100 degree bath.  Which sounded really cold to me.  And she said just pay attention to your body.  As long as your not getting that flushed feeling from being hot your fine.  It's just when you body temperature changes too much is it dangerous.  And yes bubble bath soap is fine.  I would look for some natural bubble bath soap just because your body takes in everything you put on it and since it will be covering your whole body it would be better.|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	Baths are fine as long as your core temp stays below 101.|`|xOvPuyfHaa	Go ahead and relax, taking a bath will be fine as long as you don't get the temperature over 100 or so degrees.|`|DnyyyGeEaa	Dont let anyoe tell you that it is unsafe! I love baths also and I bathed the whole time I was pregnant, even when I was in labor. Dont have your water scolding and if you do just lay on your back so your tummy is all the way in the water. Its really neat to take a bath when your pregnant, thats where I always felt the baby move the most.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	yes its safe just not too hot. ur not supposed to have ur temp above 100degrees|`|8ndWUWxRaa	Naw, a bath is fine. Just not too hot. Meaning dont sit in it all red faced and sweating. They actually recommend a nice bath later in pregnancy for relaxation and when your in early labour. They just advise against it because they dont want you to raise your core body temperature in which case your babies body temperature would raise too. So just keep them shorter less piping hot soaks.|`|nEDv5Qwaaa	yes, its very relaxing, just make sure its not scolding hot! warm temperature us perfect
qxnZXOVFaa	it may be an infection.  call your doctor and schedule an appointment to check for sure.  infections can be serious during pregnancy.  best wishes to you and your family!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	it could be a yeast infection, in which case I would consult with a doctor before using any antifungals, etc. Have them check or perhaps mention it at your next appointment.     If it smells fishy, it could either be that or bacterial vaginosis (BV). EIther way, are you having any weird discharge (other than what's normal in pregnancy)?     http://www.babycenter.com/0_bacterial-va...|`|euUZZcM3aa	Hey you're due 2 days after me =) do you know what you're having?    Anyways, it's not recommended to use anything before you consult a doctor. It sounds like you have an infection of some sort. Earlier in my pregnancy I had heavy BV, which made my discharged discolored and thick, and I smelled down thre too.    Go to your doctor, tell him what's going on, and he should be able to take a swab and/or urine sample to see what's up, and then give you the proper and safe medication for it =)    Good luck and congrats!|`|FtBqmFDEaa	Maybe you are washing too much, shower gels and douches destroy the natural flora of the vagina. You really don't need to wash down there every day your vagina is quite capable of keeping itself clean by the natural fluids it produces.     I would mention it to your midwife/GP you may need a swab to rule out thrush or bacterial vaginosis. These are easily treated so don't worry.|`|hw3OMoeZaa	If you have a bad smell it could very well be an infection, are you having any itching?  I use tucks wipes, they are mild and natural and  seem to sooth the itching and keep everything clean. Good Luck|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I am guessing that you have an infection, maybe a yeast infection, in your vagina.  Call your OB and describe your symptoms.  I'm sure they'll be able to take care of you.    TX Mom|`|qrnAZ2wbaa	some women tend to have a certain smell when they get preggers.. dont worry its normal.. you can get some vaginal wash and spray.. it wont harm the baby.. just dont douche|`|uGIFtFbCaa	You might go see your doctor. You could have a yeast infection, it's very common with pregnancy.|`|JZnRxPUCaa	I am 23 weeks so I know what you mean....I have noticed a different smell to my area down there also... (strange right) But I just use the Kleenex brand wet wipes after I use the restroom. It helps, but I think the odor is a hormonal thing, not a lack of cleanliness.  I have heard several other friends of mine who have noticed a different odor during the time they were pregnant.    I also was told you can try the a little bit of baby powder in your panties, it will just help with feeling fresh.
xhcDkCwcaa	I'm pretty sure if you've had two regular periods and you've taken 3 negative tests your probly not pregnant. The missed period is probly due to stress. Stress can delay your period. Although false negatives can happen and some women do have their period during pregnancy its unlikely that you have both. Good luck and try to relax!|`|XEmYfHl2aa	your not pregnant so chill out its ok just come down.|`|TnnFTLQXaa	go to a free pregnancy clinic  a women clinic  or see a doctor    I highly doubt it. if your from the age of 12 - 16/17 then its normal to be off, some times, when your body is growing and developing it happens a lot. to some women.    also if you used protection your fine    if you didn't start taking bc, and remember to do it.|`|x6G2wPjLaa	your period is probably late because your freaking out for no reason, if you dont want to be pregnant then use protection child.|`|f5yUbagpaa	there is a possibility your pregnant sweetie if you have been having unprotected sex . stress is probably whats causing your period to be  late. calm yourself and it will probably come on if not then you should go see a doctor right away.
S4pNsW3Taa	Good luck Lady!
GNXTe7hJaa	did he know you were???  since you dont wanna tell him dont. I know it might be hard to thnk about your baby not having a dad for him/her, but I personally think its better than having the baby in the middle of a relationship that might not work.or even worse if he's those type of guys who say they want you to abort. The best thing you can do is just have the baby, and be the best mother and father you can be to it.|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Well I moved on with my life, yes it was difficult like hell being a teen mom I cried many of days but through all the rough times I still made it through. 10 yrs later the bastard haven't accepted responsibility and I never once chased him down for $ I only asked him to be in her life but he still refused. I've grown over the yrs & am happy where I am today & could care less about him. I always say one of these days when the good lord is ready to deal with he'll know.|`|d68IGhgHaa	you let them know you are expecting if thy don't know, then you talk to them about plans to take car of the baby, financially and who will have custody and when the other parent will see them.|`|nluNSDI4aa	CHILD SUPPORT and get financial help|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Well if you broke up with them....... You screwed yourself. But the bright side. Once paternity is proven,your baby will still get taken care of.|`|yCR6qg0baa	Get a job? Collect child support? Love your child just as much as you would if the dad was around? Don't be a doormat?|`|phwivaqNaa	If you broke up with them, as you worded your question, they didnt leave you pregnant.  Obviously, something is wrong if you broke up.  You want to stay together now that your pregnant.  Sounds like a happy little family.
xa41bRrdaa	Yeah feet get sore when you're pregnant, but I'm surprised it's that sore at 11 weeks only on one foot.    Maybe you banged it in to something and you have a hidden bruise (the worst type!) Wait it out a couple more days, and if it gets worse or doesn't go away just give your doctor a call
Ltb8K9YUaa	You might be. You should take a test:). Good luck!|`|YuVSDBkzaa	Why are you asking us? Go buy a pregnancy test if you think you are pregnant. Sorry to be so blunt.|`|xhcDkCwcaa	Yea you could be pregnant. If your periods are lighter than normal that is a sign. Also a heightened sense of smell is a sign too! If certain smells make you sick then that could be a good sign of pregnancy! Good luck!|`|iNWlJg4Oaa	You could be.|`|nluNSDI4aa	Its possible. You should go test right away. Asking strangers online is'nt really gone answer your questions.|`|c33d94bc4bf7ce92a4a982d6c092b04caa	just go take a test...btw..your monthly cycles are NOT set in stone..they will be on different days and different flows on a whim.
44OH7Si6aa	You give her the milk and she will drink it when she gets thirsty. Limit the apple juice to a specific time each day. She'll learn that she's going to get the juice but she can't have it all the time. She may throw a fit at first, you can try offering her water instead of the milk but stay firm with her about the juice|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Uh...don't give her juice so often?    She's twelve months old. It's not like she'll help herself out of the fridge.    But if she really doesn't like drinking the milk,then you'll have to consider how else you can get sufficient dairy in her diet.|`|3klIx1Egaa	she might not take to the milk, just give her lots of dairy products, and if she wont eat them, get her some vitamins to make sure shes keeping up with the calcium :)|`|AA12380496	My son is 2 years old & refuses to drink milk, regular, 2% & soy.  He just can't get the taste of it.  Try to incorporate yogurt & cheeses as much as possible.    Good Luck
f9601547a805ddb55e2013699a5bcca0aa	That should get his attention. If I were you I would just do it since you have to tell him eventually before he finds out elsewhere.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	You don't need to text him you should talk to him in person or on the phone this is serious you should just let him know that you don't want him back because of the baby but you felt he needed to know that he has a baby on the way...Just be honest...You don't have to be with someone to have their child but you shouldn't have to have sole responsibility for a baby you both created!|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	yes|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	Please abort... we don't need another f-ed up kid in this country|`|lZ8VBYlgaa	Don't txt him.  Call him and tell him.  It doesn't matter what the situation is now.  He was part of the conception and this child will be his whether you or he wants it to be.  He still has a right to know.  It's in your best interest to get his information too so that he can help support it through child support.  Make sure he's listed on the birth  certificate.|`|Axcy1DYlaa	Do not text him.. you need to call him. send him a letter.. go see him. anything but texting! it's so informal and immature (not that youre immature)     He needs to know and he needs to take responsibility for his actions just as you are. Him having a gf shouldnt matter. It happened and he needs to face the facts and deal with it.     Hope for the best but also be prepared for the worst. He may want nothing to do with you. it's obviously very easy for a man to walk away from this situation. So prepare yourself emotionally for that. I do hope he steps up to the plate and does the right thing, but you never know.     Best of luck and congrats!|`|2G8lOPN8aa	Too many people these days have conversations via TXT that should be had face-to-face or at lease during a live phone conversation.  I know it is a difficult thing to have to tell someone with whom you are no longer in a relationship--but it really deserves a live conversation.      You are correct that he has a right to know about the baby--but in the end what you choose to do is your decision.  I have no idea how old you are as you do not say--but if you have the baby and raise it, he will have to be responsible for child support.  If you chose to terminate, you can ask him to help you cover the cost of the procedure.    The fact that he has a new girlfriend is irrelevant to your situation--this problem is his just as much as it is yours--it's only that the ultimate decision is yours alone.      It's not a great situation, to be sure, but you can't be afraid of telling him.  He needs to man up and take some responsibility for his actions.  Everyone knows that if you have unprotected sex this is a good possibility.  It his own fault as much as yours for not using a condom.  Don't just let him off the hook here.    But don't do it via TXT.. Texting is fine for "I'm on the way" or "I love you," or "I'm running 15 minutes late," but for difficult conversations--the two-way exchange of information is crucial.      If you get his voicemail because he doesn't want to answer your call--tell him it's in his own best interest to return the call ASAP.  If he doesn't call you back--then just leave him a voicemail and say "Congratulations!  You're going to be a daddy!"|`|X2G8EHBlaa	yes or call him and leave a message|`|28fNd725aa	Whatever you got to do to tell him... but be prepared he's prolly not going to take it lightly!  Good luck!|`|dsf5hGGnaa	Call him this is a huge deal he needs to know.|`|FdaKc4Dgaa	text him saying " i have something really important to tell you "    if he still doesnt respond txt him " im pregnant, i did try and tell you but you wouldnt respond to my other txts"    it will be like a slap in the face and by the sounds of it he deserves it.|`|T48smu01aa	UUHH CALL HIM DON'T TEXT HIM!|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I say ditch the whole texting thing. You are carrying his child!!!! You should tell him face to face!!! He has the right to know. If you tell him face to face then he doesnt have the option of running off or turning off his phone. CALL HIM and set a time and date on when to discuss this in person.|`|oK9WhUkiaa	he has the right to know so i think u should tell him but dont expect him to be there for u or ur baby hun, he's a guy, and he has a girlfriend, its very unlikely he'll care, guys make a run for it if they know they have responsibility that they dont want the hassell with. x|`|s1utniuvaa	Try calling him, if you don't get him, call his parents and ask if they know a way you can get him so you can tell him you are pregnant with his child. Make sure you have a DNA test lined up for when the baby is born because most likely he will claim it isn't his. Good luck!|`|FurFahkEaa	FFS, whats wrong with you people? Have you heard of CONDOMS?????????????????????????????????...|`|5nfqY9T7aa	If it's his child, it doesn't matter if both of you are dating or even married, he has the right to know! This isn't about you anymore, hun.    And be mature about it.  Pick up the phone and let him know.  Don't just text him!|`|6juYbfUVaa	yes, definitly text him, he is responsible for that baby.|`|wigtXCBTaa	Send him a present 'cause he sent you one|`|72JZHunmaa	You should have told him face to face. Now he is going to be mad that you didn't tell him face to face. What you should do is go to his house|`|leneiWBlaa	one word ................ banana . i rest my case|`|ojtINp2raa	Updating---- In contrast to others below me who are SCREAMING at you that you should be calling him instead of texting him with this news---I disagree.  You're not together anymore.  If you were, then I think a special voice-to-voice interaction would obviously the best option.  It makes it more personal and special.  However-------since you're NOT with this man anymore---what difference does it make ****how**** he finds out (phone call versus texting) as long as he DOES find out---that is of the utmost important.  You don't need to chit-chat with the guy to tell him news, sheesh people, give this girl a break!!    Of course you need to text him to tell him you're pregnant.  If he's dating someone else--so what?  His first responsibility is to his child, and if he refuses to stand up and be a man....well then it's off to the courthouse with him.|`|X2EPEEwbaa	This isn't the kind of news that should be texted.  CALL him and make sure you TALK to him.  Who cares if he has a girlfriend?  Now he has a child with you.  He needs to know.|`|iT3GOZwHaa	He definitely needs to know, regardless of the situation. Can't you call him? Use texting as a last resort.. this is kind of a big deal.|`|hA9MT605aa	Just be straight up in a short and to the point text..  Then just move on don't  get back with him just because your pregnant..  Are you planning on keeping the baby?|`|mHqVnPWJaa	you need to tell him!!! do whatever it takes but he HAS to know    from now on you should probably try using condoms and doing things to prevent this (unless you wanted a baby this way)    i hope everything works out!!!|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Yeah, you actually should call him I think, because he might think a text like that is just a desperate attempt to get him back.  OR  if you're not going to be together, you can just do it on your own and the state will take care of collecting child support anyway.  After you have baby and tell them who the father is, they will contact him for a paternity test *which he has to do,i'm pretty sure* and that will be the end of it.  Good luck.  A lot of people are going to put you down on here for your question.....|`|ygTr3fvVaa	This requires a phone call or face to face. Texting is out of the question.|`|mhSjwuntaa	Just text him and say look there is something you need to know...I'm pregnant and see what happens.  I really don't know what to do if he doesn't answer....I guess if he is sorry enough not to respond back then why bother even wanting him around.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	I'd try calling him wherever you can reach him... his house.. his cell... his parent's house.. anywhere... And say listen.. we seriously need to talk.. and if he wont.... tell him any way you can. Yell it at him.... Text him just "i'm pregnant".... Mail it to him in a letter if you have to!   Just tell him SOMEHOW. Try to make him listen first, but if he wont... Tell him anyways!|`|qeQVyLW7aa	if i were you i would tell him straight up. i am pregnant what should we do? if he doesn't want anything to do with the baby take him for child support. all you can do is be honest with him whether you are married, dating or even just messing around. don't text him and tell him call him or confront him in person and tell him.|`|8c93b08d0ef73b87abf803c1344c16e1aa	Yes. You two need to talk. Can you call/write him? Texting is NOT the only form of communication.|`|ZRCkJpPqaa	Umm.. I think you should just text him. he needs to know.|`|YmLIirIqaa	I dont think texting him and telling him your pregnant is the mature thing to do. I think you need to call him and if he doesnt answer your phone calls, call from someone elses phone. Ask to meet somewhere private maybe at your house and that theres something really important that he needs to know. Good Luck.|`|1553f5a78b13fec0789c55dcb9d0d0a3aa	CALL HIM, if he doesn't answer LEAVE A MESSAGE!  Or you can TEXT him and say "I'm PREGNANT.|`|bgGKsXmZaa	duh just text... IM PREGNANT!|`|P9oP8CS9aa	Meet in person to give him the news and be prepared for a SHOCK result. Make sure you tell him, he's supporting his kid too.|`|szqMXvlSaa	get prof then mail it to him.. with a letter|`|PGj469C0aa	Call him, call his girlfriend, any way you can get in touch with him do it!!! Even if this means calling his parents, I don't care. It's his fault for getting you pregnant, not yours at all. Don't worry, you'll get thru all of it!!|`|8XDM4LvCaa	Yes Missy, you need to let him know that you're pregnant with his child so he can start taking the responsibility -|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	Yah, I would try atleast once more to text him..and just say this.."you arent responding...but i need to talk to you...im pregnant"    If he stil doesnt say anything..when your baby is born..order dna test..prove he is the father..and then collect child support...you will most likely need it!|`|3RBU5TDPaa	you need to text him and just say u didnt give me the chance to tell you in a nice way so just was trying to tell you im pregnant.|`|Sk6lrUeXaa	Texting is perhaps not the perfect venue for giving news to someone such as being pregnant.  I would suggest you talk to this person face to face.|`|fmAgkHHQaa	yes definitely, you have to tell him, he has a right to know. you should tell him ASAP.|`|DsibcM5jaa	just call him and say im pregnant!|`|nIodhZrGaa	i think u should phone him! he needs to know!|`|3gfWNdYIaa	Just txt him saying " You don't have to reply... but your a daddy." Good Luck!!!|`|xnsoQzInaa	Well you gotta break it to him somehow. If he's not answering your text or calls then tell him in a text and leave him a voice mail. I'll put money down that he says its not his baby. Good luck|`|ylgNuE3uaa	The fact that he has a new girlfriend should have NO importance to the subject of you carrying his baby.    You don't have to be together for him to do his part as the father of your unborn baby. You share the consequences and the responsibilities for your actions because you didn't get yourself pregnant.    If he doesn't want to have anything to do with the baby, you can still make sure he does his part as the baby's father by applying for child support.    Make sure when you do talk to him, (I suggest CALLING HIM and leaving a voice mail if he won't answer) you let him know you're pregnant and that you will do what you have to do, with OR without him but that he is responsible for his part in this baby's future.    Just a word of advice, never tell someone something IMPORTANT throught texting.|`|bkOn30I1aa	I think this is not something you should say over a text. Call him and tell him you have something really important you need to talk to him about. You guys can meet somewhere and talk calmly about it and about what you guys want to do about the situation. Definitely meet with him, dont do it over the phone or over text messages.|`|5xpLqnokaa	Even if he has a girlfriend this is his issue too. You too need to be mature adults about this not just for your sake but for the sake of the unborn child involved. You should not text him, you should CALL him. You two should set up a meeting somewhere nuetral like a coffee shop and figure out what you two are going to do about this. If he continually won't respond  eventually you can file a paternity claim. If you are planning on keeping the baby he will have to pay child support and possibly partial pregnancy expenses. If you are giving the baby up for adoption depending on your state you may need his consent. There is  a possibility you could file for adoption and leave the father unknown but this could cause problems for the adoptive family in the future.  Hope this helps. Do you have family or friends who can help you get through this?|`|hJfaT4oOaa	It depends on how you think he will handle it.  Will he help out with the baby or will he just not care?  I have a beautiful 5 month old daughter and her dad and I were engaged last January.  He left 3 weeks after we found out I was pregnant.  He moved to CA (I live in MT) and he hardly wanted anything to do with the pregnancy or anything.  He never sent money to help with medical bills (which there were a lot of because I'm also diabetic).  Then once my baby was born he all of a sudden wanted to be "daddy of the year" and only be a father when it's convenient for him.  He to this day has not sent anything to help out.  But it doesn't work that way.  It takes more to being a parent than just being able to get someone pregnant.  He drinks way too much too so I wouldn't even trust him around my daughter.  So...in my personal opinion it depends on the kind of guy he is.  If he's going to step up and be a real man then tell him.  You guys don't have to be together for him to help take care of his child too.  But if he's irresponsible and immature, you're probably better off without him.  It's tough raising a kid on your own, but trust me...you can get through it and it's all worth it.  If I can do it, I'm sure you can.|`|PLK1p8cUaa	It depends. How long were you together?   Do you want him in your life?  Do you want him in your child's life?  He may know already if you have mutual friends.  Think long and hard about this.  If he puts his name of the birth certificate he has all rights and privileges to your child.   If he has a girlfriend she will be involved as well.    It is a difficult decision to make.  In the future use protection because now it will not only be your life you are changing but your child's.  Good luck.|`|o0UD2YvPaa	You need to call him and let him know, and that is all you can do.  If you are certain that it is his child he has a right to know.  Him knowing does not mean that he will be and active part of the child's life, but he should know and the rest is up to him.  I would not list him on the birth certificate, nor would I give that baby his last name.|`|buoqtZeFaa	I would say try giving him a call or even text him and tell him you have something important to tell him.  If all that fails I guess you have no choice but to text him at least that way he can never say you didnt tell him.  I would just suggest to try to get him on the phone first.    Good luck|`|AQkfW704aa	I think he needs to know and once you have told him you will feel a great load lifted off you. You need to remember that the child will want to know who his/her father is so be honest to yourself and your child. Swallow any pride if you have it, you owe it to yourself and your child. You don't know what the future holds. He could just tell you to keep your present and that will be a blessing to you.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	lol..how about a phone call?|`|Cd8kbh1Uaa	Call him, go to his house or something. He needs to know.. that way when you send him a bill for child support he can be somewhat expecting it. In these times.. that child support will be a big help!
PLK1p8cUaa	See a doctor for another exam.  Good luck.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	Talk to your doctor it most likely have to do with the cysts that was found. You are most likely not pregnant|`|AQkfW704aa	The chances of you being pregnant are there, you might need to visit your doctor maybe for a blood test that will check your hormonal levels.  Good Luck.
AA10953561	Oh yeah, I love this stage of pregnancy! I'm 28 weeks pregnant and my ankles, feet, hands, and wrists have all started swelling up. All my toe joints are sore, and I feel like I've almost got shin splits in my lower shins right above my ankles. It's uncomfortable but doesn't inhibit my days.    It sounds normal. If you start having sever stabbing pains, or extreme tingling for more than 15-30 minutes, you might call your doctor and confirm that what you're feeling is normal. Or if your face starts swelling.    Good luck!|`|vTPA5PXnaa	Yes, when i was pregnant with my twins my ankles started to swell around 4 months, I didn't even notice until my mom asked me. They stayed that size until i was about 7 months then they just blew up in size. They almost tripled the normal size. Again i still didn't notice until my boyfriend said something about it. After i gave birth the nurses put some kind of message culfs on my ankles and legs so i wouldn't get a blood clot, because i was not mobile and my ankles where so big. And they where the worst after i got HOME from the hospital. That's when they started to itch and feel really uncomfortable. But the swelling went down about  2 weeks after giving birth.
C55pji5Qaa	Hi. I have been on bed rest since 20 weeks. I am currently 30 weeks. How long is your cervix? If their is a change in your cervix they will probably watch you a lot more to take precautions. They may also put you on medicine for your contractions. That is what happened to me. I just had a fFN and it was negative, so I have at least another 2 weeks to go. Just keep your doctor informed and follow their order. You will be just fine.Good luck!|`|V5K66Xb4aa	i doubt that you are experiencing braxton hicks. they dont effect your cervix. go in because you are probably goig into preterm labor and you need medical attention.
wBpennsMaa	At 36 weeks and 4 days they told me my cervix was 30% thinned out.
1c498d03fe9bb2e8719c81fe361b9912aa	i had bleeding when i was 9 weeks pregnant but this was due to a low lying placenta, but my mums mate had regular periods all the way through her pregnancy, but if your worried get checked out good luck|`|AOfm8ey6aa	I had irregular bleeding during my 1st trimester in my first pregnancy. It was not regular like a period. But, I have heard stories of women, 2 of which I know personally who had periods all thru their pregnancies. One of them hasn't found out she was pregnant till she was 6 months along. I have also seen a story of a college girl on Discovery channel who gave birth suddenly, without knowing she was pregnant. She also said she had period all thru her pregnancy.|`|IGY2ofRBaa	my mum had periods for 6 months before she even realised she was pregnant because she never missed her period, they were all still very heavy like the usual period. women can have slight bleeding while pregnant however if you are pregnant and are bleeding its best to get checked out.|`|p99kr66kaa	I had a light bleed when i was 7 weeks pregnant. It was a brownish blood and then some light red spotting. If you are bleeding i would ring your doctor just to check that everything is ok. They will give you a scan to give you piece of mind. I was told when i bled that 50% of people bleed in the first trimester. I am now 11 weeks 4 days and everything is going well. If you have any concerns speak to your doctor or midwife to check everything is fine.   Good Luck

Your 19 yr old boyfried should be arrested though for being with you (no offense) but you are too young to be with him and if he is pressuring you to do drugs and other things you dont want to do you should get way from him. he is a sick person trying to get you to do things that you dont want to at your tender age. its already stressful enough being thirteen and having twins but him too that too much for any girl to handle plus it i llegal he cant marry you unless you have parent/guardian onsent but u shouldnt be with him anyway. you need to get some guidance and help. find someone to talk to SORRY|`|xBd96wvRaa	Move back in with your parents.|`|6UeGyxNcaa	holy sh8*t! your 13?! Hes 19? do you live in America? thats messed up, leave him, take the kids to an adoption center, and rethink your life before you get prgnangt again and do drugs...|`|w1pbRmazaa	WTF IS YOUR PROBLEM!?!?!?!?!?!?!? YOUR A LITTLE GIRL!!! wow i'm older than you and am not that bad! f*** no don't get married it could end really bad and don't you have to be 18? sorry if this offends you it's just that early marige is a sensitive topic and it's cool you had the babies.|`|IFGSOd16aa	if you have twins you have already had sex?|`|Sy0HXSt5aa	You are very young to make that decision even at the age of 16. You might end up changing a lot and realize he's not what you want. Just try not to move to fast and do whats best for you. Because life goes by way to fast and you don't want to wast your time or his. To me it sounds like you should take a different path because you sound very rushed and pressured to do things you don't want. And to me if you have to ask other people if you should marry him or not that's not a good sign...|`|gXiESfbAaa	wow. you had a baby at 13 years!   i dont think you should have sex or take drugs becuase you are only 13! drugs are really bad for you and the can ruin your life. If you really love your twins, then dont ruin their lives by ruining yours.break up with your boyffriend becuase he is pressuring you to do things you dont want to do.    the best thing to do would definately break up with him and move back to your parents house with your kids.|`|1rMEP8HAaa	he is not the right man for you, take your babies and get out of there, if you give in and satrt taking drugs you could have your babies taken from you and i doubt you want that. if you got somewhere to go then get out. he should not be pressuring you for sex neither, it is classed as rape you know coz u are underage|`|b6GLnqiSaa	*answer*|`|fZgoUty4aa	stop dreaming|`|7wwLbWN1aa	You should remove yourself from that situation.

You need to find some help.  It isn't safe for YOU OR YOUR BABIES in this relationship, NOT TO MENTION THE SAME HOUSEHOLD.    Do you have any family that you can stay with?  Family friends?    Are you still enrolled in school?  If so, do you have a guidance counselor you can speak with about this?  What about a church that you attend and a Pastor in which you can confide?    Do you have access to your local Health Department?  THEY WILL MEET WITH YOU AND COUNSEL YOU in order to help you get access to help.  AND CONTACT YOUR LOCAL YWCA - they may be able to help you find another living arrangement.    DO NOT MARRY THIS MAN, SWEETIE.  Protect your babies and yourself by removing yourselves from this living situation.    GOOD LUCK, and please keep us posted on what you do!|`|aqdcY99Xaa	OMG!!!!!!!!!!!|`|eHow24rNaa	omg...your 13 with twins???? I really dont know where to start!!!!

But he seems to be a complete asshole making you do drugs...and sex...i dont think your mature enough to handle any of this...you should go back home to your mom and dad...have your parents help you out with the babies and if not, give them up for adoption so they can have a normal life. I am sickened by this!!!!!|`|YK05Itmraa	Ok firstly - 13 years old and you have twins WOAH :O:O:O:O    Looks to me like you need to leave this guy as there is not onw thing that is good that he is helping you with - is he the dad to your babies?    If hes pressuring you for sex or even if you have had sex with him then that is rape as you are way to young!!!!    Drugs are a definite no no and if you are a mum then you should realise this!!!    Leave him - he is obviously no good. I am sure that you parents are there for you so go to them - they are the best people to talk to in these situations even if it is hard rather thn strangers who dont no the situataion on here!!!    Good Luck Honey!!!!|`|AA10959932	if you can't move in with you're parents, try to talk to social services in your area. If you get WIC or Medicaid, call someone over there. Tell them the problem.

Good Luck x|`|xL3yrSQhaa	move make in with your parents your too young to be living with a 19 year old.  and to be doing drugs or even having sex.  if your mom and dad don't support you try to move in with a older cousin (woman) or maybe even a aunt or uncle or with a friend.  =)|`|DCe7GVJAaa	dont do it|`|R0V5qRXKaa	He's pressuring you to do drugs??  WTF.  Don't fall in to peer pressure.  Do what you want to do.  Not what he wants you to do.  And if he doesn't stick around just because you wont do what he wants you to do, then he's not worth it.|`|TsBG44hTaa	wow why would you date a 19 year old in the dfisrt place? and its illegal to do something with a 19 year old so why would you even post that on here?|`|f5yUbagpaa	Congratulations on your 2 bundles of joy sweetie!!!!!!! Honestly i think you should kick him to the curve, he is trying to take Advantage of you knowing your 13 in all and you have his kids. No man should be pressuring you for sex no is no and if drugs is involved your kids should not even be around that and you should not allow it. Do the right thing i am a mom myself 16 and if you want to talk about it e-mail me nettaboo162008@yahoo.com|`|b10aMPdOaa	If he's 19, pressuring you for sex and trying to make you take drugs, then he's no good for you or your babies.  Get rid of him, don't say yes to his proposal.  It sounds to me as if he wants to have a hold over you.  I may be wrong.  Try moving back in with your parents if you can.  I don't mean to sound horrible, but you'll need help from your parents, it's hard with one baby, never mind two, and you're only 13.  Don't under any circumstances give in to him on either the sex or the drugs.  Do what's best for you and your babies.  Wishing you the best of luck Cloe.|`|AA11825206	go home to your parents your bf's just using you
VzLkSZ4faa	Yes. I was on it for quite awhile and nothing. It took 6 months after I got off before I was able to get pregnant. It's just as effective as the pill just as long as you use it the way your supposed to. And as far as it being any better, it's all about the lengths of time you replace it. I'm horrible at remembering to take something everyday so that was the best option for me.
AA11763588	You ovulate 10 - 14 days from the day you start your period and sperm can hang out waiting on an egg for 72 hours.    There is always a possibility. You will have to wait till you miss your period.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	Depends where abouts in your cycle you are?  If you just had your period or if your period is due any day now chances are you will not get pregnant but its very risky, you should have availed of emergency contraception (morning after pill) at the time.     After 3 days is too late to be effective really, the sooner you speak to a Dr in a situation like this the better. You could still have a coil fitted to prevent pregnancy.|`|6zVISNTZaa	It is possible that you are pregnant, but quite unlikely. Wait until your period is due and take a test if it is late. For the future, it might be better to be that little bit safer and use birth control pills as well as a condom. Good luck.|`|4GnzqUxzaa	Who knows. You just have to wait and see if your period comes.|`|8V39PymEaa	if you were  ovulating at the time then take a test if not then you should be fine but you can take a test to be sure|`|zEES49hhaa	I know waiting can be extremely hard, but that's what you're gonna have to do.  I can tell you there is only a very small time frame to become pregnant every month.  The sperm has to meet the egg while it's dropping down threw the fallopian tube.  Although sperm can live for up to 7 days, the egg only takes one day to descend (once a month), so even if they hung out the whole 7 days, the chances that the egg drops in that time frame are slim.  At home pregnancy test are very accurate and you can actually test 4 days before your missed period now.  ADDITION - There is also a pill out there that can stop pregnancy before it happens, however if you take it and are already pregnant it will not abort the baby (If the morning after pill is against your beliefs) It's called Plan B, and it's good for up to 72 hours after intercourse.  Please let us know if you need any more help.|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	Pretty darn good! Condoms break sometimes, and while it's great that you thought to be safe, it pays to be extra safe. Call planned parenthood and ask about the Plan B or morning after pills. It is confidential and definitely worth some peace of mind.|`|nluNSDI4aa	wow. well if there was "***" in the rubber and its around the time of your ovulation..it is possible. Even if there was'nt "***" you can still get pregnant from pre - "***" though the number is lower the chance is still there. In your case, you just gotta wait and see if your period comes.|`|a6a5ee67f2bc70e723086b11422d4c3daa	um it really depends on when you had sex (during your cycle). if you asked this any earier i would sugest the morning after pill, but its too late.  dont panic yet|`|R5Dl17Draa	You could have taken the morning after pill. Unfortunately, it's too late now. But if it ever happens again, just be aware that that is an option. Howver, it's always best to be on birth control when you're sexually active. For the first little while after I started having sex, I wasn't on it, and it's horrible worrying every month when your period is a day late.    Getting pregnant is actually a lot harder and more complicated than many people think. It depends where you were in your cycle. Hopefully, you're not - but there's still that chance you are. Wait a few weeks, then take a test. There's not much else you can do.    Good luck hun.|`|hw3OMoeZaa	Wait 2 weeks and take a test, I'd keep legs and fingers crossed till then.
zZFZIr2Paa	well, im only 14  and i got my period like  ayear ago  and my scehdule isn't official  like i have two months gaps in between periods  or a montha nd a half  i just don't know when to expect it  and i asked my mom  and she told me that when your first starting your period, you won't have a regualr one month schedule.|`|T8zPA3FJaa	Could be a false negative, or you're body does not have high enough hcg levels yet for the test to detect.

It could either be late or the HCG is not coming through your pee yet.|`|1rMEP8HAaa	if you wait a few more days you might come on if you don't try another test, how,long is it since you have had sex as you must be further than 2 weeks for a test to work i think.  if your under weight your periods can stop also|`|6zVISNTZaa	Depends on your age, if you've only started your periods in the last year or two, they could be irregular perhaps? Or are you stressing about anything? As stress can postpone periods. If not and yours are always regular, wait a week and take another test and if that is still negative, go to the doctor, as something must be up.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	If your "really young" its possible your periods just arent regular yet.|`|6avKnzkoaa	It's normal for your period to be irregular in the beginning. Some don't settle down into a regular cycle until they're older, and others just never have regular cycles.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hey maybe your pregnant but your pregnancy hormone is not strong enough for the tests to pick up yet. have you calculated your period right? are you under any stress cause this can stop it coming. it sounds like your pregnant and the hormone is too weak to pick up so wait a few days then test again and if its still neg go to your doc. good luck.|`|nluNSDI4aa	False pregnancy results can happen. If you have been active and unprotected, then test again in a few days. Or use 1 of those "5 days before missed period". You could be irregular too. Seeing that your young your body is still growing and changing. Stress can cause a factor of irregular periods and i think foods too but not sure on that 1|`|np0bl08taa	GIRL YOU ARE PREGNANT AND THAT TEST IS LYING TO YOU SO TAKE IT AGAIN AND SEE WHAT HAPPEN.
uWIZhO5paa	you should sit down and discuss this with her. Maybe she has to put her believes aside and think of whats best for her in the long run. A family who disown her ? or an unwanted baby?

Now you have a real problem.|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	dirrrrty.|`|yCR6qg0baa	I don't understand what is so hard for people to comprehend. Getting pregnant was not the problem-- having sex was! It's the same thing with teenagers.     You shouldn't have had sex with your cousin! That's disgusting! Be a man & face your family. Don't coerce her into getting an abortion. You get what you deserve. By the way, she's just as much of an idiot as you are. You're not the only one at fault.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	ha! that sucks. but you have to tell your family sooner or later. especially when she takes your butt to court for child support! you shouldn't be sleeping with your family anyway! thats just wrong.|`|HLghr3ocaa	thats just weird, you got your first cousin pregnant?!|`|p7xOo5Hyaa	Ewwww that's so wrong.|`|6zVISNTZaa	Well, technically, it is legal to have a relationship with your cousin, however it's normally a "taboo" area. The only thing you can do is together, tell your family, you have to, and face up to the responsibilities. Although, if you didn't think of the consequences of having any sort of relationship with your cousin would have on your family, you shouldn't have gone there.|`|AOfm8ey6aa	I do not know what you question is, so please state it if you can. You have to tell your family, sooner or later. There will be a lot of shame coming on you two, but your family will very likely help you two out. Just don't please do something stupid, now you need to be brave and responsible.|`|QGsYPJoKaa	You were old enough to get your penis out, now be old enough to face the consequences.    You did something very, very wrong. And illegal. Your going to have to face up to that, and think of the poor baby having its grandfather as its great-uncle aswell.    Take some responsibility for your actions. Its both your fault. Takes too to tango. Or have sex in this case.    Don't be so stupid in future and realise your actions have consequences.|`|8ndWUWxRaa	Umm. That babies chances of having severe disabilities is quite high. The gene pools in family's are just to weak to procreate properly. I would be going to the doctor with this and talk to him about the facts. Because your cousin and you arnt the only people who will be affected by this. Man if your going to sleep with your cousin at least you could have used some protection...|`|3raHchBvaa	well is this a real question for start but if it is u should of used a comdom i dont think what u did was right esp with family but its done so face ur problem head on dont hide from it will only make it worse and just think how u would feel if ur child come bk with the same problem u would be happy so expect family to be mad
s0TiTrd3aa	it has been said that it is not very safe to dye your hair because the chemicals that seep into your scalp may effect your baby's development. the reason the doctor didn't give you a straight answer is because it is different for every person. it may not effect your baby, then again it might. most likely, if you have a very healthy lifestyle altogether, then i would say that it should be okay to dye your hair, just make sure to avoid blondes and bleaches. if you are going to dye from a box, make sure you do not leave it on your hair any longer than is required.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	no its not safe,the dye absorbs into your scalp therefore could get to ur baby. deal with the bad hair. i dyed my hair once a month b4 i got pregnant,u just deal with it look at ur pregnancy like a chance for ur hair to become healthy|`|BIDy92Dwaa	I wondered this too and have gotten medical advice on it.  I've gone to my GP, obgyn and asked when I was in the ER at the womens hospital and they all said that there is NO evidence stating that dying your haif can harm the baby, if you want to be on the safe side dont do it but there is no medical evidence to support the theory.

WWcaKZ7Qaa	Aw, I'm sorry you are dealing with this so early on. Unfortunately, it tends to get a lot worse the further along and bigger you get. The pain can start to be pretty excruciating making it difficult or impossible to walk but that's not usually the norm.    I really recommend going to the chiropractor to get adjusted. That's the only thing that relieves the sciatic pain for me. It still comes back, but then subsides quite a bit after I get adjusted again. Feel better!|`|T8zPA3FJaa	I had REALLY bad sciatic nerve pain a couple of weeks ago and pain killers didn't help. (I'm 12 weeks along now). I could barely turn in my sleep without waking up because it was so painful. Walking hurt like hell. It put me to tears. I'd just be standing on the one spot and then BAM, I'd almost drop to the ground in pain. It has subsided now thank god!   With my first pregnancy I didn't have problems until late in to it, and then it was more of a dull constant ache that I couldn't get rid of.   Really it varies from person to person the amount of pain it causes. It can be very debilitating, and may or may not get worse. Just do stretching, it does help, even though it may be painful. Hopefully it will wear off. But theres nothing that can really be done about it.  The person who replied above me ... she's right too - a chiropractor helps! My brother is one, so I'm lucky to be able to get adjusted whenever I need/want. It did help with my pain a little bit too.|`|75l2smfCaa	Im in my 13th week and I too have had sciatic pain! UGH! i am planning on talking to my doc about it at my next apt next week. Good luck!|`|HjyUoM8eaa	ugh!!!  sciatic nerve pain is NO walk in the park.  i was in physical therapy a few years ago for a year to fix it.  luckily, i have escaped it in my pregnancy but i am starting to feel some sciatic nerve discomfort lately (36 weeks and 5 days pregnant).    it could go away or it could get worse, you'll just have to wait and see.  it's possible that it is just being aggravated by your rapidly growing uterus at this point.  perhaps once your growth stats to stabilize, your body could adjust and it could go away.  GOOD LUCK!
