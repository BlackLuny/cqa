20090220091356AA1yTM1	Games & Recreation;Gambling	Does my boyfriend have a gambling problem? Please help?	I've known my boyfriend for two years.  I've been aware that he likes to gamble online from time to time, but for the past month, it seems to have escalated.  He doesn't have the internet, so when he comes to visit me, he spends HOURS playing online poker.  He won't pay any attention to me while he's playing.      For the past two weeks, he's decided to spend time at the casino instead of with me!  He lies about how long he stays there, and sometimes stays out until 3 in the morning when he has to work the next day at 8 am!  He constantly turns down hanging out with me, citing he's too tired, and then he goes out drinking and gambling.  He could lose $150 a night and say it's not that much money!      I'm worried because our relationship is starting to take a backseat.  He has a good job, but gambles away his paycheck every week at the bar/the casino/a friend's house, etc.!  I know that every man should have a hobby, but it's really starting to interfere with the way he treats me!      Does he have an addiction?   Please, help with any personal insight/experiences you may have had with a loved one! Thank you!

After waiting for Street fighter HD remix to appear on the PS store for about 3 months it finally arrives one day before Street fighter 4 gets released.......well done Playstation. I loved the original S.F and it was one of my favourite games growning up. I would get both but I am also getting Killzone 2 (of course) and the Sega mega drive collection so money is a bit tight. I think HD remix will be enough to fulfill my S.F needs but is number 4 really that good?

20090220093655AAd82Ui	Games & Recreation;Video & Online Games	Street Fighter IV - Is Dhalsim a naturally slow fighter?	I'm planning to get Street Fighter IV for my PS3 soon. My cousin and I have been fighting on the M.U.G.E.N. remix of Super Street Fighter II Turbo. He likes to pick Dhalsim as his favorite fighter. When I showed him gameplay of Street Fighter IV, I could tell on the look of his face that he wasn't satisfied with Dhalsim because he fought slowly than the M.U.G.E.N. version. In it, there was a speed setting so that I can adjust the speed of the game (not SF IV).      So...is Dhalsim always this slow in every Street Fighter? I mean, the body stretches and such are fine, but is he slow like that? (BTW, I don't play as Dhalsim much. I'm more of a Chun-Li fan.)

Hey everyone, this isn't really a question to be answered:P~ but I've got the download point of "Virtual Villagers 2" the site is:       http://down.hxgame.net/down/070227/Virtu...       the only thing is that when you are installing it, it might look like it is in another random launguage(it is not traditional or simpliefied chinese... believe me:P~) but that isn't a problem, just after you have downloaded the game, and you have installed it, just go to:      My Computers -> Program files -> and usually the last folder is a random symbol/writing, just change that is an english word eg. "Big Fish Games" and then enter this folder and rename the next folder maybe "Virtual Villagers 2" and then go change the shortcut path on your desktop then you're on the roll^_^~      Hope you all enjoy it~ if you have any problems, just e-mail me and I'll get back at you asap, hope you enjoy it as much as I do~

Un político llega al cielo?	y  le da la bienvenida al paraíso San Pedro, y le dice: antes de acomodarte, como recibimos a muy pocos como tu pasarás un día en el infierno y otro en el paraíso  para que eligas. Así, lo lleva al infierno. Que luce a todo dar, lleno de amigos bien vestidos y que lo saludan eufóricos. Luego ve al diablo, contando chistes y bailando. En brazos de mujeres bellísimas el tiempo transcurre rápidamente, hasta que llega nuevamente San Pedro para llevarlo al cielo, en donde solo pasa de nube en nube tocando el arpa. Aburridísimo. Así que cuando llega San Pedro a preguntarle cuál lugar elige para la eternidad, sin dudarlo elige el infierno.   Así es arrojado al infierno y cuando se abren sus puertas, solo ve a sus amigos en harapos juntando desperdicios e inmundicias, llorando. Y luego viene el diablo lo agarra por el cuello y cuando va a arrojarlo con ellos le dice ?no entiendo si ayer esto era el paraíso? Entonces el Diablo le sonríe y dice: “Ayer estábamos en campa?a" Hoy… ya    votaste...
