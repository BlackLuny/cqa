pHGVHkGiaa	"I received a handful of criticisms from my parents for not helping out and being a sloth in their eyes. Then I realized that it was also my responsibility as the eldest son to be a servant-leader towards my siblings, in the hope that it would be beneficial in the future. Immediately, I started doing everything expected from an eldest son: laundry, washing the dishes, helping my sibling with their homework, cooking when my parents couldn’t, and being a good example for my siblings—Servant-leadership at its finest. <br>  <br>  But looking back, I feel that the concept of taking care of younger siblings was not that beneficial because it is basically the parents’ duty towards their kids—I was dead wrong. However, my bond with my 3 brothers and sisters has increased and we have become inseparable. I’ve come to know them better, and, more importantly, earned their respect."<br>  <br>  And are you sure you want to put 'servant-leadership at its finest'?

Maybe being a paralegal, like a stenographer, would be less demanding and easier since you have kids, and it doesn't take as long to learn as being a lawyer does, of course. You can spend the next 10 years studying part time to be a lawyer and maybe just a year or two to be a paralegal.  Good luck.
e9b8d9a2dcb7d7a40bd5c28a9ae6306daa	As to the name United States itself, no, not quite, but rather is it more akin to a generic combination of ideals.  The word 'states' is a political reference: in political science vernacular, 'states' is a term denoting countries or nations.  In conception, the United States' council of founders fancied itself a conglomerate of independent "states" (or countries), which was why "states rights" was so hot an issue during the 18th and in particular 19th Century during the decades preceding, during, and following the Civil War.  <br>  <br>  But, beneath the ideal itself rested what may be called indeed a toponymy.  In its inception, the United States took in several traditions and sensibilities, adopting from several regions of the world, to wit: Greco-Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and Judeo-Christian; and then these were merged with already established regions and traditions extant in the then native North America: hence the many names and places in the United States whose names and lores are Native American in origin.

However, the rule has changed since, and every style guide (Chicago, AP, APA, etc.) now says one space after a period is correct.<br>  <br>  Book and newspaper publishers have been using single spaces after periods for decades as a way to save valuable page space. The practice first extended to common people in the late 1980s, when we were all saving our work to 5.25" floppy disks, which had very limited memory. Extra spaces took up too much disk space (especially in very long documents), so people started deleting them. From there, the single space after a period became fairly common practice.<br>  <br>  I'm a proofreader, and I struggle with convincing people older than 30 to use one space. The two-space rule is very difficult for some folks to let go of. It's what they learned in their high school typing classes, so they assume it will be correct forever.|`|fecUjSr1aa	Two spaces after a period is a grammatical rule in correspondence. It gives a bit of a "breathing space" between two sentences so as not to "tire" the eyes of the reader.<br>  <br>  some punctuation marks require a space like a comma, a dash, or a semi-colon. Periods and colons are alloted 2 spaces after the mark.
46f08ffa5c76fa0a99f7bd318d1d05d2aa	You need to be doing your own homework. Grab your text book, lecture notes, search the web for reputable sources (i.e. not yahoo answers), etc. and study hard. <br>  <br>  You could always form a study group if you are wanting to bounce ideas and solutions off each other. That way you can have a group discussion about the rationales for the right answer and the wrong ones too (it's just as important to know why the wrong ones are wrong). You'll learn the content better this way.<br>  <br>  It's one thing to come on Yahoo and ask for guidance as to reputable reference sites and quite another to ask straight out for answers.

AA11622701	There is no mention of the  birth of Saul of Tarsus in the Bible.  He first appears in what was probably his early 30s.  His actual age is not stated at any point.<br>  <br>  Remember that the New Testament was written before the invention of cheap paper, pens, pencils and the printing press.  Every copy of a book had to be hand copies one page at a time.  The creation of a single copy of a book was a process that involved months of work.  <br>  <br>  Plus the "book" (codex) had not yet been invented (that would come almost 300 years later).  Everything was on a scroll which greatly limited the length that could be put in a single volume.<br>  <br>  So it was important to authors of that time to keep their books as short as possible.  Otherwise it was impossible to even create the book, and impractical to get it copied.  So no biographer of that time period (or any before the 1500s AD) which have included information that was not essential to the story they were telling.  As the events of Paul's conversion and ministry were the theme of Acts, and not his birth or childhood, the author saw no reason to include it.

Most states offer an alternative route to teaching and all one needs is a bachelor degree or above.<br>  <br>  Teaching at an university or business school is not a bad alternative to teaching at the secondary level as there is no need for certification, your MBA is your certification.

CtqWRAcFaa	Global warming is described as in increase in the earth’s average temperature.  The rise in temperature is caused by an increase in  greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere, producing what is known as the "greenhouse effect."<br>  <br>  An increase in temperature results in changes in climate and precipitation patterns. An increase in temperature also results in the melting of ice caps, which in turn causes a rise in sea levels.  Coastal flooding due to a rise in sea levels may eventually threaten our civilization. <br>  <br>  Since atmospheric carbon dioxide has always been present through volcanic emission, there may be some doubt if human activity is actually responsible for global warming; one speculation is that global warming is an inevitable natural phenomenon. <br>  <br>  Just how serious is global warming? Should anything be done about it -- and if so, CAN anything be done about it?<br>  <br>  Climatologist and social activist Mark Lynas has written a number of articles for such publications as The Observer and The Guardian.

w9mrFRJ2aa	I was looking online and there is a thin line between "incite" and "insight".  I believe insight would be the correct term but I see no one else mentioned it so I might be wrong.  <br>  <br>  "It has been discussed that our planet is getting warmer, but carbon dioxide has always existed through volcanic emission, is man truly contributing to global warming or is global warming an inevitable phenomenon?"   You need to seperate this.  Seperate it at "emission, is man".  Put a period there.  You went from stating a fact to a question in the same sentence.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Another thing, where you say "Global warming is described as earth’s average increase in temperature due to greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide trapping heat and energy in our atmosphere,"  you may want to change our atmosphere, to the Earth's atmosphere.<br>  <br>  EDIT 2:  I believe you are supposed to underline the title of Lynas' book.

cstW6JLIaa	This is a good question.<br>  <br>  Yes, you can go to a community college first and later transfer to a four-year university. But there is more to it: while you're at community college, you will need to complete a number of general education courses. These classes include math, science, English, humanities, social sciences, and possibly a foreign language. You can take classes in your major as electives, but that is optional. <br>  <br>  If you have completed enough general education credits to transfer, you will enter a four-year university as a third-year JUNIOR. In that case, you will technically be halfway done and will have only two more years to earn your Bachelor's degree. <br>  <br>  Once you have earned your Bachelor's you can choose to enroll in graduate school to earn your Master's degree. <br>  <br>  <br>  NOTE: I am currently finishing up my general education requirements at a Community College. I have to tell you that it has taken me nearly FOUR YEARS to do this. Why? Because I've always had a full-time job that prevented me from taking on a heavy load each semester. Rather than taking 5 classes a semester, I could usually only take about 2 per semester. That's why it has taken me longer.<br>  <br>  Don't fret, though. Not all people have to work full-time like I do, and others can handle the heavy load. Completing your general education requirements will probably take you 2-3 years .... but it goes by very, very quick. Then you'll enter as a junior, NOT a freshman, at a university.<br>  <br>  P.S. Universities LOVE transfer students. Why? Because they're more well-rounded than freshmen. They're less likely to drop out and MORE likely to finish on time. <br>  <br>  Good luck!! :)|`|8gA2EWXfaa	You can go to a CC for two years, but most likely they will not transfer all of your credits, so you would be behind a class or two if you're lucky.  If you go to a CC for two years you only have to go to a four year University for another 60 credits (aka about 2 years).  It would still only be 4 years total if you are up to date.  It would not count at all towards a Masters Degree.  You should really talk to a high school adviser, they will explain it more in depth.
Eu9QeEudaa	Some, if not all, of your community college units will transfer.  It is up to you to determine transferability.  You do this by reading the college catalog (at your cc) and also by meeting with counselors from both your cc and the university you are transfering into.  If you have completed 60 transferrable units, then when you transfer you will be starting your junior year of college at the university.  In another 2 years (or thereabout) you can graduate with your bachelors degree.  <br>  <br>  If you're in California, this site will help you figure out what classes transfer from a CC to a CSU or UC:<br>  <a href="http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome...</a><br>  <br>  If you're elsewhere I would suggest going to the Web sites of the colleges you're interested in and start reading in the catalogs for transfer information.|`|cL1K7NHZaa	Check with the 4 yr Univ. that you want to attend to find out what will transfer and how they work.

At these levels, school curricula, funding, teaching, and other policies are set through locally elected school boards with jurisdiction over school districts. School districts are usually separate from other local jurisdictions, with independent officials and budgets. Educational standards and standardized testing decisions are usually made by state governments.<br>  <br>  The ages for compulsory education vary by state, beginning at ages five to eight and ending at the ages of fourteen to eighteen.[3] A growing number of states are now requiring school attendance until the age of 18.<br>  <br>  Compulsory education requirements can generally be satisfied by attending public schools, state-certified private schools, or an approved home school program. In most public and private schools, education is divided into three levels: elementary school, junior high school (also often called middle school), and senior high school. In almost all schools at these levels, children are divided by age groups into grades, ranging from kindergarten (followed by first grade) for the youngest children in elementary school, up to twelfth grade, which is the final year of high school. The exact age range of students in these grade levels varies slightly from area to area.<br>  <br>  Post-secondary education, better known as "college" in the United States, is generally governed separately from the elementary and high school system, and is described in a separate section below.<br>  <br>  In the year 2000, there were 76.6 million students enrolled in schools from kindergarten through graduate schools. Of these, 72 percent aged 12 to 17 were judged academically "on track" for their age (enrolled in school at or above grade level). Of those enrolled in compulsory education, 5.2 million (10.4 percent) were attending private schools. Among the country's adult population, over 85 percent have completed high school and 27 percent have received a bachelor's degree or higher. The average salary for college or university graduates is greater than $51,000, exceeding the national average of those without a high school diploma by more than $23,000, according to a 2005 study by the U.S. Census Bureau.[4] While the United States presently leads the world with over 5,000 Montessori schools, the People's Republic of China (PRC) has expressed ambitions to replace much of their school system with the Montessori method's pedagogy. As part of a trial run towards achieving this objective, the PRC Minister of Education called for 1,000 teachers to receive certification from the Association Montessori Internationale in 2007. The U.S. Department of Education has no formal plans to compete against China on similar initiatives at this time.<br>  <br>  The country has a reading literacy rate at 98% of the population over age 15,[5] while ranking below average in science and mathematics understanding compared to other developed countries.[6] In 2008, there was a 77% graduation rate from high school, below most developed countries.[7]<br>  <br>  The poor performance has pushed public and private efforts such as the No Child Left Behind Act. In addition, the ratio of college-educated adults entering the workforce to general population (33%) is slightly below the mean of other developed countries (35%)[8] and rate of participation of the labor force in continuing education is high.[9] A 2000s study by Jon Miller of Michigan State University concluded that "A slightly higher proportion of American adults qualify as scientifically literate than European or Japanese adults".[10]<br>  <br>  ---preschool---<br>  Various optional programs, such as Head Start Under 6 <br>  Pre-Kindergarten 4-5 <br>  Kindergarten 5-6 <br>  ----Elementary School---- <br>  1st Grade 6–7 <br>  2nd Grade 7–8 <br>  3rd Grade 8–9 <br>  4th Grade 9–10 <br>  5th Grade 10–11 <br>  ----Middle School----- <br>  6th Grade 11–12 <br>  7th Grade 12–13 <br>  8th Grade 13–14 <br>  ----High school ----<br>  9th Grade (Freshman) 14-15 <br>  10th Grade (Sophomore) 15-16 <br>  11th Grade (Junior) 16-17 <br>  12th Grade (Senior) 17–18 <br>  ----Post-secondary education----- <br>  Tertiary education (College or University) Ages vary (usually four years,<br>  referred to as Freshman,<br>  Sophomore, Junior and<br>  Senior years) <br>  Vocational education Ages vary <br>  Graduate education <br>  Adult education <br>  <br>  hope this helps if you want you could look up U.S department of education.|`|tnWNK1itaa	I think throughout Europe things go like this:<br>  -primary school (6-12) written document stating he or she passed primary school.<br>  -middle school(12-18) A2 diploma<br>  -University (19-??)

It doesn't<br>  <br>  Elementary-Middle School-High School-College-graduate School<br>  <br>  Last 2 are optional of course, and some even treat High School as optional.|`|SIQNnfnnaa	Can I just say... Not all of the UK is primary, secondary<br>  In the south in some areas.. we have<br>  First school (ages 4-9)<br>  Middle school (ages 9-13)<br>  Upper school (ages 13-16/18)<br>  College/ sixth form (ages 16-18+)<br>  University (ages 18+)<br>  <br>  This is very similar to the US
AA10176626	Jay:<br>  <br>  No. The recently signed economic stimulus bill provided funds to increase the Pell Grant awards, but included no measures relating to student loans.<br>  <br>  If you watched the President's address last night, you may have heard him mention one of his pet initiatives - a proposed program that would reward college graduates who agreed to provide service to their country and/or their community. Bringing this plan to life would take a while, and require bipartisan support, but the President has spoken of a program that would allow students to have portions of their loan debt forgiven if they provide service through organizations like AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps.<br>  <br>  The various banking bills that are working their way through Congress also address the difficulty that current students are experiencing in finding college financing. <br>  <br>  The only relevant discussions for your situation are very early-stage discussion of relaxing some of the restrictions on the discharge of student loan debt through bankruptcy. To be very honest with you, that type of change does not have particularly strong support at the moment. When the vast majority of student loan borrowers have sacrificed to scrimp and pay back their loans, it's hard to find sympathy for borrowers who want a "do over" because they are disappointed in the borrowing and education decisions that they made in their lives.<br>  <br>  Though you may have read about efforts to help mortgage borrowers who found themselves in unaffordable loans, even there, there is a debate about whether helping the "innocent" victims of loan-sharking mortgage brokers and greedy banks is possible, without somehow simultaneously rewarding borrowers who knew exactly what they were doing when they took out those loans. <br>  <br>  The argument would be made that you - and others in your situation (and there are many) - should not be 'excused' if you over-borrowed without concern for whether your likely income would ever allow you to repay your loans. <br>  <br>  Understand that I'm not saying that this is what happened - I'm just saying that there is far from universal sympathy for borrowers in your situation.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for the disappointing news. I wish you the best of luck.

gfXlZUBpaa	The Holocaust was a tragic point in history which many people <br>  believe never happened. Others who survived it thought it should <br>  never have been. Not only did this affect the people who lived <br>  through it, it also affected everyone who was connected to those <br>  fortunate individuals who survived. The survivors were lucky to <br>  have made it but there are times when their memories and flashbacks <br>  have made them wish they were the ones who died instead of living <br>  with the horrible aftermath. The psychological effects of the <br>  Holocaust on people from different parts such as survivors of <br>  Israel and survivors of the ghettos and camps vary in some ways yet <br>  in others are profoundly similar. The vast number of prisoners of <br>  various nationalities and religions in the camps made such <br>  differences inevitable. Many contrasting opinions have been <br>  published about the victims and survivors of the holocaust based on <br>  the writers' different cultural backrounds, personal experiences <br>  and intelectual traditions. Therefore, the opinions of the authors <br>  of such books and entries of human behavior and survival in the <br>  concentration camps in Nazi-occupied Europe are very diverse.<br>  The Survivors of the Holocaust: General Survey<br>   Because the traumatization of the Holocaust was both <br>  individual and collective, most individuals made efforts to create <br>  a "new family" to replace the nuclear family that had been lost. <br>  In order for the victims to resist dehumanization and regression <br>  and to find support, the members of such groups shared stories <br>  about the past, fantasies of the future and joint prayers as well <br>  as poetry and expressions of personal and general human aspirations <br>  for hope and love. Imagination was an important means of <br>  liberation from the frustrating reality by opening an outlet for <br>  the formulation of plans for the distant future, and by spurring to <br>  immediate actions.<br>   Looking at the history of the Jewish survivors, from the <br>  beginning of the Nazi occupation until the liquidation of the <br>  ghettos shows that there are common features and simmilar <br>  psychophysiological patterns in their responses to the <br>  persecutions. The survivors often experienced several phases of <br>  psychosocial response, including attempts to actively master the <br>  traumatic situation, cohesive affiliative actions with intense <br>  emotional links, and finally, passive compliance with the <br>  persecutors. These phases must be understood as the development of <br>  special mechanisms to cope with the tensions and dangers of the <br>  surrounding horrifying reality of the Holocaust.<br>   There were many speculations that survivors of the Holocaust <br>  suffered from a static concentration camp syndrome. These theories <br>  were proved to have not been valid by research that was done <br>  immediately after liberation. Clinical and theoretical research <br>  focused more on psychopathology than on the question of coping and <br>  the development of specific adaptive mechanisms during the <br>  Holocaust and after. The descriptions of the survivors' syndrome in <br>  the late 1950's and 1960's created a new means of diagnosis in <br>  psychology and the behavioral sciences, and has become a model that <br>  has since served as a focal concept in examining the results of <br>  catastrophic stress situations. <br>   After more research was done, it was clear the adaptation and <br>  coping mechanisms of the survivors was affected by the aspects of <br>  their childhood experiences, developmental histories, family <br>  constellations, and emotional family bonds. In the studies and <br>  research that were done, there were many questions that were asked <br>  of the subjects: What was the duration of the traumatization?, <br>  During the Holocaust, was the victim alone or with family and <br>  friends?, Was he in a camp or hiding?, Did he use false "Aryan" <br>  papers?, Was he a witness to mass murder in the ghetto or the <br>  camp?, What were his support systems- family and friends- and what <br>  social bonds did he have? These studies showed that the <br>  experiences of those who were able to actively resist the <br>  oppression, whether in the underground or among the partisans, were <br>  different in every way from the experiences of those who were <br>  victims in extermination camps.<br>   When the survivors integrated back into society after the war, <br>  they found it very hard to adjust. It was made difficult by the <br>  fact that they often aroused ambivalent feelings of fear, <br>  avoidence, guilt, pity and anxiety. This might have been hard for <br>  them, but decades after the Holocaust most of the survivors managed <br>  to rehabilitate their capacities and rejoin the paths their lives <br>  might have taken prior to the Holocaust. This is more true for the <br>  people who experienced the Holocaust as children or young adults. <br>  Their families live with a special attitude toward psychobiological <br>  continuity, fear of separation, and fear of prolonged sickness and <br>  death. <br>   The experience of the Holocaust shows how human beings can <br>  undergo extrem|`|I9zWF6DMaa	your best bet is to go to your professor for extra help. your teacher will commend you on it

lQIKWXDuaa	Hello there,<br>  <br>  I am in a mid-life career crisis.  I am in the middle of switching career. Some schools require their student to carry health insurance. Thus when making this financial aid package they will take that into consideration. My best advise to you is to apply for school and for financial aid. Yes, you will be eligible for loans and scholarships which also cover your living expenses. There is Grad plus loans, private student loans and federal (Stafford and Perkins loans). <br>  <br>  Good Luck to you ok.<br>  <br>  ss|`|AA10023710	There are all types of financial aid out there. Some are dependent on income, but some aren't. There are loans and etc. When the time comes, fill out the FAFSA, and speak with someone in financial aid at the schools you want to attend. They can help you find resources. <br>  <br>  If you make good money now, it's likely you'll need to take out a student loan to pay for your college. There are student loans that aren't dependent on income. You can talk to someone at your local credit union (good rates) to get more info. <br>  <br>  You can also use resources like Fastweb to find scholarships that you can apply for. Many of them do consider income, but quite a few do not. Worth a look. <br>  <br>  A lot of universities offer student health insurance, for a fairly low fee. This is something you should ask each college about. UMass Amherst, for example, offers it.

The sun is going to last longer than we are.<br>  <br>  Disadvantages:<br>  1) Solar panels take up a LOT of space, especially since you need many panels to power just one building.<br>  2) The panels themselves are not that cheap, so it's not financially viable for many homeowners.|`|4EesoL2xaa	Another advantage is the fact that solar energy doesn't create waste, like coal and oil do.  It isn't harmful to the environment.<br>  <br>  One disavantage is that it is very limited as far as storage, meaning that the technology doesn't exist yet (on a grand scale, at least) to store the energy to power whole cities.  <br>  <br>  Another is that government officials are not allowing for the amount of funding necessary to gain this technology, because they are being pressured by big oil companies.  The oil companies know they are in trouble with the advances in alternative power sources, and are throwing money at the government to make them slow up the process of more eco-friendly alternatives.|`|zytYgcr7aa	one disadvantage is that you have to have some sort of battery to store all the power in or else you wouldn't have electricity during the night when the sun is...well, not there.<br>  <br>  an advantage would be that if you bought solar panels for the roof of your house, it would pay for itself after a few years or so, depending on how much you use electricity.|`|ac2adac992505d5959caceab855b5c1daa	Solar power can be combined with other energy sources such as wind energy.  So, if this is done then the number of solar cells can be reduced.<br>  With the government wanting to throw money at companies that can come up with alternative energy sources look for the cost of solar cells and other alternative sources to come down.  The ultimate advantage is the less dependence on foreign sources of energy.|`|9ARNK0Bzaa	disadvantages.....<br>  <br>  1. Solar panels are really expensive, so although the long-term benefits will be large, the initial payment is pretty high.<br>  <br>  2. The panels take up a lot of space and don't really look that nice. Not that that's a huge problem if they're gunna do their job i guess!<br>  <br>  3. They arent very efficient when it comes to getting the energy.  They usually need full on sunshine to be effective (something we know isn't that common in this country - especially over the Winter months!)<br>  <br>  <br>  Advantages....<br>  <br>  1. Like you said, theres no limit on the sun. Its free (!) and its never gunna run out.<br>  <br>  2. Solar panels do not harm the environment.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps , good luck<br>  <br>  -x-x-

I gather Laura must have went to public school and didn't have uniform lol all that street language she wrote below me lol da color|`|UnlaK5WOaa	YES!  It would save lots of money.<br>  <br>  But hey, I go to a damn public school, probably wont happen.  If it did, people would cry out socialism, protest, and then there'd be another red scare.....lol.|`|s30Duwdraa	I think uniforms should be mandatory in any country, at every age!!   It's a lot easier to get ready in the morning and it saves a lot of money.<br>  <br>  I think it's utter nonsense that people think they take away creativity!Individuality is something within, so it doesn't matter what you wear!! <br>  <br>  Teachers should be uniformed as well.  There are way too many slutty looking teachers and students, which isn't good for concentration!|`|9qmP77Rgaa	honestly, yes i do believe they should. the way some people dress is unbearable. At lunch, it really isn't that nice to see *** cracks, and boxers..etc. ahha plus uniforms don't look that bad really.<br>  interesting question.|`|aOSZuBM9aa	no way, that's thick, criminals wear uniforms u cant show ur individuality wat happened 2 being ur own person i wear a uniform n its freezin cold in my skool n da uniform doesn't keep u warm at all n its really uncomfortable n da colour isn't nice at all|`|jcJxVJ4waa	I go to a Canadian Catholic high school, so we wear uniforms. It's kinda nice, you aren't freaking out in the morning because the only choice you have is whether to wear the long sleeve dress shirt, or the golf shirt, or the blouse. So, it's nice. Of course we all look forward to "civvies days", when we can wear our own clothes, but really I don't mind the uniforms. Plus I don't have to buy endless shirts to wear every day; a couple golf shirts, some blouses, some sweaters, some dress pants, and I'm pretty much covered for the year (more if I don't grow!)<br>  To answer your question, I think it should be up to the school board whether uniforms are implemented. Most kids will probably speak out if they are, but they'll get used to them, and probably end up liking them.|`|dX8ivwOsaa	yea i wouldnt mind it. our school dosnt require uniforms. but imaqine all the problems that wud stop because of uniforms. no more enforcinq dress code, and it would set tha kids straiqht.
JLayHNZCaa	Go for it.  They either will hire you or not, but they will know you want advancement and that is a good thing.

xMnN99T8aa	As a nurse, I will tell you that almost anybody can get a job. The shortage is bad and getting worse. However, you have to come across as literate. If you talk like a "valley girl" and every other word out of your mouth is "like" than you had better learn to speak the English language first, then go on an interview. Nurse managers and Human Resource professionals do not appreciate "internet speak".  That said, be yourself, be professional, dress well, and ask appropriate questions, such as what kind of orientation program they have, long term benefits, etc. Good luck.|`|AJz80vNWaa	Confidence! and remember,<br>  <br>  "it's not what you know, and it's not who you know... it's what you can convince people you know!"|`|nkh8gFhDaa	dont tell them you love dead ppl|`|Em3JdXsHaa	dress nice|`|kdBhSqqfaa	Yes, just be yourself and look like this: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3619/3314013919_dbbb761fe3.jpg?v=0" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3619/3314...</a>

You will be required to do "student teaching" for a few months in order to graduate with the necessary degree. The requirements for teacher licensure after graduation vary by state, so you would have to choose where you want to live before I can tell you how to get a teacher's license. If you want to teach Univeristy courses, you then have to go to Grad school to get a Master's, or preferably a PHD, which takes another 2-4 years, as well as conduct research.|`|Uagg9UsFaa	J' habite en Paris, mais je suis américaine.

You can choose any accredited university/college. <br>  <br>  You don't need an "English license," you just need to pass the TOEFL, which tests your English. Getting accepted into a university/college is enough proof that your English is fine. You should also look into getting a green card, so you can live in the United States, which may be the toughest part.|`|L28baPnpaa	I would say maybe go to University of Toronto in Toronto,Canada as the city is mainly English but they offer an excellent french program.

Nuuk1Nwtaa	Your actual GPA and the difficulty of your classes play more of a role than your class rank. Same thing with stuff you do outside of school. I know one girl who was valedictorian of her class, took all AP and honors classes, etc. and got rejected from all the Ivy League schools she applied to. The schools are designed to be so tough to get into--there's no guarantee that you'll get in, no matter your rank. And your school seems to be really small, which also makes a difference, and can sort of tarnish your chances of getting in.<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to discourage you, I'm just saying that you shouldn't kill yourself over what your rank is. I think Cornell and Dartmouth have higher (as in, 11-14% as compared to 7-9%) acceptance rates. Good luck, enjoy your high school years.|`|HH2rl8V7aa	First of all, no matter what college you go to...it is a college education!  What school you go to really doesn't influence your job in the future unless you plan on becoming a brain surgeon or a 500k+ job.<br>  <br>  Alot of school will really look at your ACTs more than anything.  I had 5 credits to my name, took my ACTs and got a 25.  When I sent it out to a UW school, I was immediately accepted.<br>  <br>  The prep schools will probably look at your rank, but if you don't get into one of those who cares?  If a tech school offers the same program as a "high class" school...you will still have the same job opportunities.|`|34VXCyvVaa	It probably doesn't matter much unless you're valedictorian or salutatorian or unless you're near the very top of an academically tough prep school or large suburban high school.  Even being the top of your class doesn't necessarily help getting into the Ivies -- Harvard rejected half of the valedictorians who applied last year and also rejected kids with perfect SAT scores.
pn3mQqGIaa	im not a teacher<br>  but ive noticed over time<br>  that all my favorite teachers<br>  had a few things in common:<br>  - they were GOOD AT TEACHING<br>  - funny people who were easy to talk to and get along with<br>  - theyre kids at heart<br>  - trustworthy, caring, intellectual people<br>  <br>  and always remember<br>  the key to leadership is influence not authority.|`|hyHvG1Olaa	Teaching is ...<br>  <br>  An art form, a discipline, and a skill that requires practice as well as experience to hone one's skills.  Teaching requires one to be a life-long learner and an individual who is dedicated to the premise that all individuals are capable of learning.  Teaching requires intelligence, intestinal fortitude, strength of character, integrity in one's dealings with others, honesty in all things, empathy for others, a dedication to the learning process, and consistency in the way one deals with discipline.  Teaching is for a lifetime and not for someone who wants to have summers off or long holidays.|`|VnSdgRvWaa	I think you should teach by example and always be willing to help or instruct others at any moment.  Teachers should be friendly, knowledgeable in the field they teach, caring, have a sense of humor, trustworthy, and hardworking.

The majority of anesthesiologists in the United States have completed a four-year undergraduate college degree, including pre-medical requirements. Like other physicians, anesthesiologists complete four years of medical school (several medical schools offer a six year program following high school. The first two years fulfill the pre-medical requirements, and the following four years are the traditional medical education). Physician training programs in the United States, without exception, require four years of residency training for board certification eligibility in the specialty of anesthesiology (usually one year of general medical or surgical training followed by three years of clinical anesthesiology training under the tutelage of experienced anesthesiologists, usually faculty at medical school hospitals). In all, after graduating high school, physicians specializing in anesthesiology complete at least ten to twelve years of education and training prior to becoming eligible for board-certification.<br>  <br>  Anesthesiology residency training in the U.S. encompasses the full scope of perioperative medicine, including pre-operative medical evaluation, management of pre-existing disease in the surgical patient, intraoperative life support, intraoperative pain control, post-operative recovery, intensive care medicine, and chronic and acute pain management. After residency, many anesthesiologists complete an additional fellowship year of subspecialty training in areas such as pain management, cardiac anesthesiology, pediatric anesthesiology, neuro anesthesiology, obstetric anesthesiology or critical care medicine.<br>  <br>  The majority of anesthesiologists in the United States are board-certified by a specialty medical board; either the American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) or the American Osteopathic Board of Anesthesiology (AOBA). The ABA is a member of the American Board of Medical Specialties, while the AOBA falls under the auspices of the American Osteopathic Association. Both Boards are recognized by the major insurance underwriters in the U.S. as well as by all branches of the U.S. Uniformed Services. Board certification by the ABA involves both a written and an oral examination. AOBA certification requires the same, in addition to a practical examination with examining physicians observing the applicant actually administering anesthetics in the O.R.|`|DoZXSJlWaa	Hmmm thats a difficult one lol

Fabiano é um vaqueiro, homem bruto que tem enorme dificuldade em articular palavras e pensamentos, que se sente um bicho e muitas vezes age como tal, grunhindo e se portando como um selvagem. N?o tem aspira??es e nem esperan?as, do mesmo modo como n?o se tolera e n?o tolera o mundo em que vive. Sinhá-Vitória, sua esposa, se sai melhor em seus pensamentos e diálogos, apesar de restritos. Seu sonho é uma cama de couro, como a de um homem chamado Tomás da bolandeira. Essa personagem, que nunca aparece a n?o ser na memória das outras personagens, é também uma espécie de herói e modelo para Fabiano: culto, detentor de sabedoria, da arte da palavra e do pensamento, por isso mesmo admirado.<br>  <br>  O menino mais novo parece n?o ter nome e nem uma forma comum de se comunicar. Sua única aspira??o é ser como Fabiano. Nas mesmas situa??es está o filho mais velho, que só quer um amigo, conformando-se com a presen?a da cachorra Baleia. Esta, muitas vezes, parece ter um pensamento mais linear e humano que o resto da família, portando-se n?o só como um bicho, mas como um ente, uma companheira que ajuda Fabiano e sua gente a suportar as péssimas condi??es.<br>  <br>  A história se desenvolve com o estabelecimento da família numa fazenda e a contrata??o de Fabiano como vaqueiro. Este, certa ocasi?o, vai até a venda comprar mantimentos e se p?e a beber. Aparece um policial, chamado por Fabiano de Homem Amarelo, que o chama para jogar baralho com outros. O jogo acontece e, numa desaven?a com o Soldado Amarelo, Fabiano acaba sendo preso, maltratado e humilhado. Aumenta sua insatisfa??o com o mundo, com sua própria condi??o de homem bruto e selvagem do campo, e o desprezo de outras pessoas, encarnadas agora na figura do Soldado Amarelo.<br>  <br>  Solto nosso herói, a vida segue na fazenda. Sinhá-Vitória come?a a desconfiar do patr?o, que parece roubar nas contas de Fabiano. Este se aborrece, mas n?o pode fazer nada. N?o entende as complicadas contas que o patr?o faz, e n?o sabe dialogar com ele. A festa de natal na cidade só serve para aumentar o descontentamento de Fabiano e sua família com o resto do mundo. Sentem-se diferentes, inferiores, desprezados e humilhados por milhares de "patr?es" e "soldados amarelos". Baleia adoece e Fabiano e vê na árdua tarefa de sacrificá-la. Fere o pobre bicho com um tiro, mas n?o consegue matá-lo, já que este foge para longe. Baleia vem a falecer durante a noite, perto da casa, sonhando com um mundo cheio de lebres...<br>  <br>  Sentindo-se cada vez mais lesado pelo patr?o, Fabiano resolve argumentar contra esse, mas, sob amea?a de despejo, resolve deixar o assunto quieto, o que lhe causa uma indigna??o cada vez maior. Sua indigna??o com o mundo chega ao extremo quando encontra, na volta da venda após ter tomado alguns goles, o Soldado Amarelo, que estava perdido no mato. Fabiano percebe o seu medo e seu corpo franzino em rela??o ao seu, e tem a idéia de matá-lo, descontar toda a sua raiva e seu descontentamento. Sentindo-se, entretanto, fraco e impossibilitado, resolve deixar pra lá, ensinando o caminho de volta para a cidade ao soldado. Seu sentimento de revolta é agora intensificado pela impotência...<br>  <br>  Como n?o bastasse, a seca atinge a fazenda e faz com que toda a família fuja novamente, só que esta vez para o sul, em busca da cidade grande, sem destino e sem esperan?a de vida.

dn3S33qiaa	Wow, you're taking on a ton! I have a BA in Applied Math, which at my college meant that I completed the 200 level of a foreign language. You can do the same thing with a BA in Math as a BS in Math. If you keep the Stat minor, the US Census Bureau might be a good match, or some other statistician position. Also, you could get into education. Because of the dual Math/Linguistics major, you could get into creating textbooks. There are many content developers around the country that work to fill the pages of  textbooks for the big publishing companies.
VsXfDFysaa	macchè dura.!<br>  io sto rimandando la laurea più che posso per non finire questo meraviglioso cazzeggio universitario.!<br>  beato te che inizi.!<br>  se vuoi facciamo cambio.?!|`|w9M7SqKLaa	Fai attenzione e pensa bene a cosa stai facendo (ciò non vuol dire che non lo devi fare). Considera che ci sono delle lauree di serie A dove il lavoro prima o poi lo trovi anche se sottopagato, e delle lauree di serie B che se trovi un lavoro, quello stesso lavoro lo avresti trovato anche senza la laurea. Quindi io, senza chiederti che lavoro fai e a che corso di laurea ti vorresti iscrivere, ti consiglio vivamente di valutare:<br>  <br>  -prospettive che ti da il corso di laurea al quale ti vuoi iscrivere<br>  -prospettive che avrai sul tuo lavoro (e possibilità di cambiarlo all'interno della stessa struttura)<br>  -retribuzione del lavoro attuale<br>  -possibilità di poter cambiare lavoro (senza la laurea)<br>  <br>  Dopo aver valutato tutto questo, e considerandoti molto motivato per i motivi che tu hai scritto, ti posso dire che di difficoltà ne incontrerai parecchie, ma quelle si trovano in tutti i corsi di studi, ti farai degli amici (se magari già non li hai che frequentano la tua università) con i quali condividerai molto, e di cui preserverai un ottimo ricordo...<br>  <br>  Infine un consiglio che mi costerà tanti pollici in giù, ma chi se ne frega: se intendi fare solo i 3 anni (qualunque corso tu sei in procinto di scegliere) ti consiglio di non iniziare nemmeno.<br>  Sei in una posizione in cui devi cercare di cambiare in meglio, non di essere "retrocesso". Con i soli 3 anni è molto ma molto difficile trovare qualcosa di interessante, se poi si tratta di una di quelle lauree di serie B citate sopra equivale a perdere il lavoro, stare in ferie 3 anni e poi riniziare a cercarlo, con la differenza che per 3 anni hai occupato la tua vita per nessuna finalità.<br>  Se sei disposto, invece, a tutto (intendo che di quel lavoro sei stufo e lo abbandoneresti presto) allora ti dico di tentare tranquillamente, mal che vada ti fermi ai 3 anni, ma, se saresti tato in questa ultima situazione non credo avresti chiesto consiglio.<br>  <br>  Poi ci snon altre 2 cose da valutare:<br>  - se viaggi è dura<br>  -se ti fermi ti consiglio di cercarti con attenzione l'alloggio, io sono passato in molte case con diversi coinquilini e non dappertutto si riesce a studiare come si vorrebbe (per i coinquilini per esempio). Se trovassi un alloggio con qualcuno appena laureato che lavora sarebbe l'ideale perchè saresti solo durante il giorno. Infine ti consiglio (per esperienza personale) la camera singola, costa di più ma è tutta un altra cosa, non disturbi e sei molto meno disturbato.|`|Qjxycyxnaa	anch'io probabilmente andrò a studiare fuori...ho 18 anni...e a volte sì l'entusiasmo è alle stelle...ma poi penso a tutto ciò che lascio...amici, famiglia, comodità... alterno alti e bassi...<br>  io devo dirlo...sono un po'viziata..quindi penso che un po'le comodità mi mancheranno...e gli amici moltissimo...ma sono sicura che sapremo farcene di nuovi...senza però scordare quelli di ora...perchè io personalmente...vivo di e per loro...:(<br>  buona fortuna a te e a me!!!!!!!;)|`|b27252c2b4046303d23548a95fba53e9aa	AGGIUNGO=  Ok, ho letto che sei stato 3 mesi a Londra, quindi comunque, diciamo che hai già provato!<br>  Vedrai che sarai soddisfatto della tua scelta!!!<br>  In bocca al lupo!<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Se non ti sei mai allonatanato da casa, le cose cambiano.<br>  <br>  Però è bellissimo.<br>  <br>  Io sono uscita di casa a 19 anni per fare l'università: all'inizio è stata un po' dura, ma vedrai che farai subito un sacco di amicizie e ti divertirai anche!! <br>  <br>  Per me è stato il periodo più bello della mia vita quello universitario!!!<br>  <br>  Ciao

Vamos pegar o Pacto de San Jose da Costa Rica. lá assegura o direito ao recursos independentemente de qualquer condi??o.(art.8 alínea h)) certo?<br>  ai você pega o artigo 594+595 do CPP, o primeiro diz que o assim, o juiz acabou de condenar o réu no tribunal do júri. ai o réu vai querer recorre, ai o advogado dele fica constrangido e diz Sr. o art 594 diz que para recorrer, vc tem que ir para a pris?o. ou seja, ele condiciona o direito de recorrer do réu. e o 595 diz que se o réu fugir, uma vez preso  seu recurso fica deserto. iai? qual artigo eu aplico? o art. 8 do pacto de san jose ou os artigos do CPP? isso é interpreta??o sistemática, vc está interpretando o sistema pow!!! o sistema jurídico do brasil. A resposta é o art 1, inciso I do CPP. ou seja, aplico a regra do tratado(pacto de san josé). <br>  a interpreta??o literal é vc pegar qualquer artigo de lei ou constitui??o e ser ele sozinho.

w9M7SqKLaa	Puoi frequentare qualunque facoltà. Cmq sulle tue considerazioni vedo di farti un po di luce sulla tua decisione:<br>  - ragioneria: per facilitarti le cose ti consiglierei economia e commercio o magari legge.<br>  -sei disposta a studiare: allora qualunque va bene, anche se bisogna distinguere lo studio (come concetti da ficcarsi in testa) o lo studio (come cose da capire) le due cose putroppo non sempre vanno di pari passi.<br>  --Lavoro assicurato: pare che ingegneria continui ad essere la pù gettonata anche in questa fase di leggera ripresa, ovvio che ingegneria non è tanto da studiare (come i pappagalli) ma piuttosto da capire (almeno il vecchio ordinamento, quello nuovo non so). Ti consiglio quindi di fare ingegneria magari ing. gestionale in quanto, escluse quelle che si è inventato ogni ateneo allo scopo di avere nuovi iscritti, pare che non sia la più facile. Se invece hai coraggio, o non ti spaventa il capire le cose, di direi di puntare su una qualunque ingegneria molto versatile e rivendibile al mondo del lavoro, per esempio ing. meccanica, elettronica ecc....<br>  <br>  Buona decisione.|`|0r50DBs8aa	Se studi ragioneria (come me anni fa) ti consiglio Economia e Commercio..

aFkSn7xIaa	You probably need all A's, or at most one or two B's and very good SAT scores.  It will help if you have an interesting life story that explains why you started off at community college or provide diversity in some other way.  All universities take some transfers from community colleges, but the most elite ones might require you to repeat some courses if they don't believe the rigor of the CC matches up to theirs, and the most elite ones very rarely take CC transfers.  They won't give you a specific answer, because they don't have rigid admissions rules the way some public universities do.|`|NSCN8dyLaa	The first responder probably got his education from Pat Robertson, which means he is an expert in absolutely nothing.  The second responder is right, the Ivy Leagues schools are tough on transfer students, especially from a community college.

When you have a number in front of the suqared term it means that you need to have two numbers that multiply together to make that number in front of your x terms.  The only whole numbers that multiply together to get 3 is 1 and 3 so start with this.....<br>  <br>  (3x-  )(x+ )<br>  <br>  This insures that your first term will be 3x^2.<br>  <br>  You still need two whole numbers that multiply together to make 12,  we'll try 3 and 4 first.<br>  <br>  (3x-4)(x+3)   <br>  <br>  when you multiply it out you get a +9x and a -4x  which equals +5x, it needs to be -5x so you'll have to reverse the signs.<br>  <br>  (3x+4)(x-3)<br>  <br>  If you ever get stuck on a problem like this, just start trying different combinations, and checking them.  On this one you know you have to have a 3 and a 1 in front of the x terms, and for a number like 12 I always start with two numbers that are close together like 3 and 4.  If that didn't work out you would have to try 6 and 2 or 12 and1.  Eventually you'll get to the right answer and you'll notice that the more problems you do, the easier it gets to spot the right combinations.

zUVhmCvSaa	Well it's a story of irony....the men spend their lives loathing each other, fighting over land, etc....and when they are caught under the fallen tree they are stuck within inches of each other but are pinned down so they can't do anything about it.   Then more irony shows up when the men finally form a friendship and decide to "bury the hatchet" so to speak, regarding their familys' feud...and then they see what appears to be men in the distance ready to rescue them, but once the figures get closer, they realize that it is a pack of wolves.  It's ironic because you'd expect their men to come rescue them so they can go back into town and display their newfound friendship, but that will never happen because we can assume they'll be eaten by wolves.  <br>  <br>  Does that help you out, or was your teacher looking for something different?

For example, a vignette could be about the final minutes before a bride and her father begin walking down the aisle. They could remember a time when she was growing up that something significant happened.  <br>  The concept of show not tell is more suited to another dramatic scene called a tableau, in which there is no speaking.  The players come on and arrange themselves in a way that depicts a moment in time and then they freeze.  A play called 1776 ends with all the signers of the Declaration of Independence in a tableau that looks like the famous painting of that moment.  A tableau can depict any recognizable scene.  You could show a delivery room with a doctor, nurses, and the nervous parents in the last moments of birth.  You could do one with baseball players around home plate with the ump signalling safe or out and the appropriate reactions of all the people. There are lots of ideas for scenes to depict in either vignettes or tableaux (that is the proper way to pluralize tableau).  So, good luck and have fun!|`|kQOWiYbvaa	If you want to write an awesome vignette, read some essays by the 18th century English writers like Steele, Addison and Sheridan (from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org)." rel="nofollow">http://www.gutenberg.org).</a> They wrote essays about practically nothing that are works of art and will get you thinking about what interests you and then you'll be able to write something about that (it might be a view from a window, a pet, a sport, even).

DDUCLeVuaa	Abstract<br>  Concentrations of elements and ions measured in aerosol samples collected from March 1992 to the end of December 1993 were investigated to identify source regions affecting chemical composition of aerosols in the eastern Mediterranean atmosphere. Collected samples were analyzed for approximately 40 elements and ions using a combination of atomic absorption spectrometry, instrumental neutron activation analysis, ion chromatography and colorimetry. Statistical techniques, such as enrichment factors and a non-parametric bootstrapped potential source contribution function, were applied on the data set to determine main source types and source regions of anthropogenic particles in the eastern Mediterranean basin. Source regions of two previously defined anthropogenic components, namely a long-range transported component and a local pollution component, were identified. The main source areas for pollutants reaching the eastern Mediterranean basin were determined as southern and western parts of Turkey, central and eastern regions of Ukraine, east of Belarus, Greece, Georgia, Romania, coastal areas along France and Spain and coastal areas around the Black Sea, Russia. More distant source regions in the South of UK and Sweden, the central part of Algeria, the northeastern part of Turkey, Russia, Germany, Hungary, Czech Republic, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and coastal areas of Egypt, Israel and Italy do affect aerosol composition in the eastern Mediterranean, but transport from these regions cannot account for the highest 20% of the measured pollutant concentrations. <br>  <br>  Also go to ScienceDirect.com

XOnSRoR2aa	Stanford is one of the best and most respected universities in the world, and they have a stellar music department. Talent and charisma are incredibly important to succeeding in the entertainment industry, but connections are what often gets you the break, and Stanford has some great connections. A degree from there will take you far.<br>  <br>  That being said, UCLA is also an awesome school and if you are a California resident it's A LOT less expensive than Stanford. It's in the heart of LA just a few miles from where the major record labels are located, and there are some major bigwigs who've taught courses there. Grown ups go to UCLA Entertainment extension courses all the time because they are some of the best in the country. This is the city where most people come to get "discovered." It's brimming with talent agents an scouts & there are so many things to audition for and places where you can perform. It's a tough path, and many get burned out before ever "making it" but if it's something you're passionate about, give it a shot.<br>  <br>  Tisch School of the Arts at NYU is also amazing, but uber expensive & stressful. USC also has a great music program & is in LA.<br>  <br>  Peabody at John Hopkins, Oberlin, Berklee College of Music, Julliard, and the Curtis Institute of Music are amongst the very best music schools in the country.<br>  <br>  Being 16 shouldn't be an issue at any of these schools.

It was common place for the school nurse to take your temperature to determine if you were ill enough to skip class or be sent home.  I shivered and shook and was given a blanket.  I asked for a drink and was given some hot tea.  Then the nurse put the thermometer in my mouth and left me for a few minutes.  I popped the thermometer in the tea cup and let it heat up, returning it to my mouth when the nurse came back.  Worked like a treat!<br>  |`|NfCtlOakaa	You cant really get your temperature up fast but a thing that you can do to trick your parents are that you get a blowdryer and have it blow on your head for 2 min and wait till it gets hot.|`|cy7KduqOaa	put it under open flame

JIFi4Cvmaa	1 to 2 inches every ten thousand years.
HSqEYnB5aa	Okay, so first you have to set it up in an equation. Because it's a ratio, you can make all of the ratio numbers coefficients in front of an x. It's like 4/15ths of a triangle, and 4/15ths, and 7/15ths, so you just think of them as percentages and have them equal to the total, 100%, or 52.5. So...<br>  <br>  4x + 4x + 7x = 52.5<br>  <br>  Then you add them together...<br>  <br>  15x = 52.5<br>  <br>  And then you divide!<br>  <br>  x = 3.5<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|26Nlq5p1aa	Add the ratio numbers (4:4:7) and divide the perimeter by that total.  Take thequotient and multiply by the numbers in the ratio...<br>  <br>  For example, 4+4+7 = 15...  if 15 goes into the perimeter twice, then the sides are 8, 8, and 14... this is not your exact answer, but the approach should work nicely for you...  have fun with it|`|ajIe3bbEaa	let the sides be of length x, x, and y.<br>  then x = 4t, and y = 7t<br>  also the perimeter = x + x + y;<br>  P = 4t + 4t + 7t = 52.5 cm<br>  15t = 52.5 cm<br>  t = 52.5 cm / 15 = 3.5 cm<br>  the base of the triangle is 7t<br>  so b = 7t = 7(3.5 cm) = 24.5 cm

They wanted their own government.<br>  Mmm, the Czar had one son who was ill, his wife was getting the help of a Siberian monk named Rasputin who aslo helped screw with them.<br>  Eventually the Czar and his entire family were killed, Lenin came to power, and the USSR was formed.<br>  <br>  In a nutshell, that's it :P

The teacher cared enough to call me and both her and I sat down and developed a plan to work this out together..we checked her work leaving school and I checked everything at home. It was time consuming for both of us; I also NEVER blamed the teacher-i made my 10 year old accountable and wanted her to understand that she needed to become responsable. A year later at her 5th grade conferance(last night!) her teacher this year had nothing but good things to say..how she dives into her homework at study time..asks for help and never has late work this year..plus she had almost straight A's..<br>  I think teachers are wonderful and are one of the most under-paid professions out there..<br>  Unfortunately some parents take those things as some sort of personnal insult or don't seem to understand that in a few short years their children will need to enter the adult world.<br>  I hope knowing that a very, involved caring mom(able to admit that my child isn't perfect!)completely agrees with you will help|`|211b57ff92165fbc92f48e364c590111aa	I have had the greatest repect for all the teachers my children have so far had.

She is a sensitive child, but it does seem that her science teacher just doesn't like her!  I remember as a child having a teacher or two that just didn't seem to like me for some reason!  Because she is so sensitive I'm considering moving her to the other science teacher's class.  She has had a difficult past two years, for various reasons, and she doesn't need the extra stress.  We just moved to a new school district, and she's getting picked on a lot.<br>  <br>  Ok I'm rambling here.......but once again thank you for the reminder!!!|`|05a2de2fad25308c9051fbf79fe6d06caa	Ok, I am a parent and a teacher, and yes, I have felt the same way you have.  Here is your solution.  Write a syllabus with all the work , reading and homework for your quarter, semester or term on it.  Send it HOME to be signed.  If the child does not return the slip of paper, call home, etc until the parent is aware that they were supposed to see it.  Once you have their signature, there is no argument.  If a parent has  an email get it.  Make an email list of parents and send the homework on a weekly basis to the parent.  You will never convince a parent who wants to believe their childs cockamamie stories that the kid is wrong, stop wasting your breath.  This comes from a teacher who has heard, "My son told me the school discontinued report cards" and another parent ranting that their child could not have skipped school because he picks her up from school every day at 2 30.  Unfortunately school ended every day at 3 30.  His comment "I thought there were too few kids outside for the end of the day. (our school has over 2000 students)  The key is communication with the Parent.|`|258f0aaa113d88d3bf75e7184def8503aa	ya

TzWJmz3yaa	Where I go they require you to be full time which is 12+ credits; they then give you an amount depending on how many classes.<br>  I would ask a financial adviser since it could be different.|`|STrYou06aa	well it really depends to the company and to the requirements of the loans. There are loans that requires you to have a full time credit, some considers half time credits. Contact some lenders and ask for the requirements and i am pretty sure that there are lenders there who accepts half time or even less half time enrollees. try AMS programs aswell. AMS is an installment program. It divides you tuition fee to equal monthly payment (this x months depends on the plan you will get) good thing is that this program is an interest free and finace fee free program, the only fee you will cover is aside from the actual tuition fee is an application fee that usually ranges from $18 to $50

ZVGbONH9aa	When Jesus was in the Garden of Gethsemane, He was at the lowest point of his human existence.  He knew that the Son of man would be handed over and die.  Even though He knew what was to come, He asked His father to please help him and not allow this to happen, but if it was His will, then to let it be done.  <br>  Sometimes we must walk through the valley of tears before we can be on top of the mountain.  Jesus did the impossible and carried the heavy cross.  We all have a cross to carry in our lives.  This is the time to get even closer to our Lord and surround yourself with positive people.  Not sure what religion you are, but it sounds like you need some counseling to help you through and join a Religious Youth Group.  I've worked with lots of youth at my church and I see the dispair and pressure they are under.. I've also seen some beautiful healings when the kids get close to God and with the help of friends in the same group..

Thoughts wander to the game you want to see or meal you want to eat, when suddenly a sound unlike any you've ever heard fills the air.. The sound is high above you. A trumpet? A choir? A choir of trumpets? You don't know, but you want to know.. So you pull over, get out of your car, and look up. As you do, you see you aren't the only curious one. The roadside has become a parking lot. Car doors are open, and people are <br>  Staring at the sky. Shoppers are  racing out of the grocery store. The Little League baseball game across the street has come to a halt. Players and parents are searching the clouds And what they see, and what you see, has never before been seen..<br>  <br>  As if the sky were a curtain, the drapes of the atmosphere part. A brilliant light spills onto the earth. There are no shadows. None.<br>  <br>  From every hue ever seen and a million more never seen. Riding on the flow is an endless fleet of angels. They pass through the curtains one myriad at a time, until they occupy every square inch of the sky.<br>  <br>  North. South. East. West.<br>  <br>  Thousands of silvery wings rise and fall in unison, and over the sound of the trumpets, you can hear the cherubim and seraphim chanting, Holy, holy, holy.. The final flank of angels is followed by twenty-four silver-bearded elders and a multitude of souls who join the angels in worship.<br>  <br>  Suddenly, the heavens are quiet. All is quiet. The angels turn, you turn, the entire world turns and there He is.. Jesus.<br>  <br>  Through waves of light you see the silhouetted figure of Christ the King. He is atop a great stallion, and the stallion is atop a billowing cloud. He opens his mouth, and you are surrounded by his declaration:<br>  <br>  I am the Alpha and the Omega.<br>  <br>  The angels bow their heads.. The elders remove their crowns.. And before you is a Figure so consuming that you know, instantly you know: Nothing else matters.. Forget stock markets and school reports. Sales meetings and football games. Nothing is newsworthy.. All that mattered, matters no more.. For Christ has come.

L8fNazZ9aa	A quaint aroma of pure harmony and happiness is abroad the marvelous lake designed by years of change. It is a therapeutic retreat hidden from the world we entertain. Soft winds caress your neck as one nears the out-lying woods that surround this satisfaction achieved dwelling. As soon as the beautiful trees with fall colors start to dispel their leaves, it is as if a blanket is covering the forest for a nice nap. There is a road with winding turns, telescopic mountain passageways, and marvelous tunnels to enter the lake. Mirroring the gates of heaven, this is by far the closest thing on earth one will find near that sensation. After the passageway of parade-inspiring colors, one finds the opening to euphoria. It instantly allows someone to see slow sloping depressions covered by tanzanite colored water, neighboring a cunning mountainside that shields the relaxation depot from harmful advances of natures? might. The water is as still as a cell phone when it is turned off. The air is fragrant with honeysuckles, pine, and grass. For some un-answerable reason, one feels that a whisper tone is mandatory to maintain the perfect cohesion with the outdoor temple. Vegetation is all along the bank with fruit producing vines in astonishing numbers. Birds are flying making their presence known by beautiful songs. Squirrels are running abroad looking for acorns, and the trees feel nice enough to share. Hummingbirds are hovering consistently over the honeysuckle bushes. Woodpeckers are knocking out a tune in stereo surround sound. A simple toss of nutrients into the water brings groups of fish giving their salutations. Towards the dock floats a boat. This is not the everyday boat you expect, but a silent eco-friendly boat, controlled and powered by man. To aid in the tranquility a shade is atop the marvel of water floatation. This allows endless hours of seeking life?s most treasured views. One is be reminded of the outside looking in quote, but now you are on the inside looking out. As one treads atop the tanzanite liquid and hears the ripples made from the boat amplify, a smile is impossible to resist. The baitfish swim in schools of hundreds passing the boat, wondering what purpose this shade maker serves. In the background, calls of the wild come from animals of all sorts. Toward the shore, bullfrogs are croaking a tune similar to the famous frogs on the Budweiser commercial. Just above the waters limits are thick blades of Johnson grass coloring the earth where leaves have not yet landed. These blades of grass make a carpet to walk on. The grass seems like a neon light around the shore of the entire lake. From the rock-insulated mountains, a creek sends a soft harmonious tone. This clear mountain spring maintains the lake?s boundaries. Atop the earth created mountains, snow is visible and cascading down nearly half the total elevation. Trees tower from the lower half and ascend to meet the snow. The clouds are in a cumulus state throughout the seasons. The formations of the clouds seem to split and pass around the retreat, like a thick fog around a moving vehicle. Often you can see a rainbow stretching across the sky as water turns to vapor by the suns solar rays. About 50 feet from shore lays a structure.

The dream house of an outdoor enthusiast allows for a deep and restful sleep. The front deck has two rocking chairs and a small table. The chairs are made from the trees and hand-carved to hold you in comfort. Once atop the deck over looking the picture most dreams about, one will forget worries, troubles, and fears.

Your law classes could be business or common law.  I would strongly advise that you try to work on the school newspaper to gain practical experience. After you earned at least you Bachelor's then you have to contact local newspapers and television stations for interviews.  Your professors should be able to instruct you in the interview process, give you references, and contacts in the media. One other thing, keep a portfolio of all your journalism work: interviews-print or media, articles in the college and university newspapers.  That will give a potential employer an idea of the quality of your work and experience.

eWssw4kfaa	As someone who did go through a vocational education program with the Department of Rehab. Services located here in the Communist-Wealth of Virginia, it truly depends on the facility that is teaching the students. For someone, like myself, who has a mild disability going this route is a waste of time and money; therefore, I would not recommend it to anyone who has a mild disability. However, for someone that has a moderate to severe disability going through the Department of Rehab. Services might be the only way to go. If you did decided to go this route you need to first learn about the program, what they teach, the facility within the department, and what they can do for this person after they finish. Some people work with the disabled not because they care about the disabled but they work with the disabled just so they can force their authority on us "weak-minded" disabled people. It makes these fools look and feel important.

Children who are given an opportunity at an early age are much more likely to succeed. Up to age 5 is the critical developmental period for learnng language. Every child develops differently, but the more opportunity your child has the better his/her chances at a good quality of life. With that said, keep in mind that you as a parent need to be aware of your child's ability as well as the tolerance level (ie some kids can't take constant lessons OR they may be sensitive to sounds or visual stimuli).

Yang lebih menjengkelkan lagi, dia sering menelepon tak kenal waktu. Jika tidak diangkat, dia marah-marah. HASILNYA? Saya malah menjauhinya.<br>  <br>  Cobalah bersikap ramah ke dia tapi jangan tunjukkan anda sedang mengejar-ngejar dia. Bermainlah "jinak-jinak merpati". Misalnya hari ini anda "secara kebetulan" (dalam tanda kutip) membawa roti lebih, lalu berikan roti itu ke dia dengan ramah dan singkat. Setelah itu menjauhlah darinya (misalnya ada pekerjaan lain). Tunggu reaksi darinya. Kalau dia tertarik pada anda, dia pasti akan memburu anda. Tapi jika dia tidak mengejar anda, break lah dua sampai tiga hari. Lalu dekati dia dengan cara yang lain. Begitu seterusnya. Intinya: JANGAN TERLALU MENGEJAR-NGEJAR.

7IjGzvqTaa	Well if I ruled the world... (I tend to start a lot of sentences like that.)<br>  <br>  I think the first priority should be the environment rather than the economy.  Fuel companies are all nervous about gasoline being replaced with cleaner fuels like solar energy and hydrogen cells.  That'd be where I would start.  Give the automotive industry an extreme makeover and create a list of things the cars have to comply to.  (CO2 emissions, efficiency, affordability, etc.)
JoyIIiZ6aa	Here are some suggestions which might help:<br>  <br>  1. Political aftermath of the victory conferences of WWI and WWII.  (Pick one or two countries which were not conference participants, and see how they were affected by the decisions of the superpowers, e.g. Poland gained independence after WWI, in WWII Poland was the only country on the victorious side that lost territory, and was abandoned to the facts on the ground, becoming a Soviet satellite).<br>  <br>  2. Treatment of Germany in victory conferences of WWI and WWII.  (You can compare the two approaches to Germany, see how they differed and why.)<br>  <br>  3. Dealing with the displaced people in the conferences of WWI and WWII. (You can talk about how the Allies had to deal with massive numbers of people who became essentially modern nomads, especially after WWII, and had to be somehow returned to their homelands, or a homeland had to be created for them, as in the case of the Jews).<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Ftkr9jqYaa	I assume by B.E. and M.E. you are referring to Bachelor of Engineering and Master of Engineering.  Here is the USA, where the M.B.A. originated in the late 19th century (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.B.A." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.B.A.</a> ), we specify B.E. usually as B.S.E. (Bachelor of Science in Engineering), and we designate the area of specialization within engineering for the master's degrees (e.g., MME = Master of Mechanical Engineering, MEE = Master of Mechanical Engineering).<br>  <br>  I have an M.B.A., and I consider it to be a supplementary advanced degree.  I do not regard it as worthwhile alone (although it might be acceptable with your baccalaureate in engineering).  Thus, I would probably recommend that you pursue a master's degree in engineering.  Afterward, spend some time in the working world, since MBA applicants were traditionally favored if they had a few years of business experience.  Harvard Business School, for example, once accepted predominantly those candidates who had successful business careers.  If, after awhile working for a company, you are really interested in business and commerce, or want strongly to be a corporate executive, then pursue an M.B.A.<br>  <br>  Engineering will probably have more opportunities for the foreseeable future than the MBA, especially considering the horrendous condition of the world economy currently.

Ftkr9jqYaa	I have climbed a peak known as "10,000 Foot Ridge" several times.  It is located between Los Angeles and Palm Springs.  The view from the top is spectacular.  However, the usual conception of a "10,000 foot view" is the panorama of the terrain from an aircraft.  Many private airplanes commonly fly at an altitude of about two miles or 10,000'.  From that elevation, it is possible to see more than thirty miles in every direction, and to have a vista of the entirety of a large city, such as New York (see <a href="http://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/02/22/the-10000-foot-view/" rel="nofollow">http://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/20...</a> ).<br>  <br>  Thus, the usual meaning and use of the phrase "10,000 foot view" is a broad, macroscopic, or large-scale perspective, in contrast to a close-up, magnified, or microscopic view (see <a href="http://www.mitadmissions.org/topics/finaid/financial_aid/do_you_want_the_10000_foot_vie.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.mitadmissions.org/topics/fina...</a> and <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/449697_2" rel="nofollow">http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/4496...</a> ).

RXLFDkf3aa	When Puritans left England in the 1600s because of persecution, they named the place that they landed on as "Maryland" to appease the King. His wife was called Henrietta Maria and she was a Catholic. This showed that the Puritans had respect for the King, England and the Queen, even if they didn't want to live in England anymore.|`|PnPVoakoaa	In 1629, George Calvert, 1st Lord Baltimore in the Irish House of Lords, fresh from his failure further north with Newfoundland's Avalon colony, applied to Charles I for a new royal charter for what was to become the Province of Maryland. Calvert's interest in creating a colony derived from his Catholicism and his desire for the creation of a haven for Catholics in the new world. In addition, he was familiar with the fortunes that had been made in tobacco in Virginia, and hoped to recoup some of the financial losses he had sustained in his earlier colonial venture in Newfoundland. George Calvert died in April 1632, but a charter for "Maryland Colony" (in Latin, "Terra Maria") was granted to his son, C?cilius Calvert, 2nd Lord Baltimore, on June 20, 1632. The new colony was named in honor of Henrietta Maria, Queen Consort of Charles I.[28] The specific name given in the charter was phrased "Terra Mariae, anglice, Maryland". The English name was preferred over the Latin due in part to the undesired association of "Mariae" with the Spanish Jesuit Juan de Mariana.[29][30] Leonard, Cecilius' younger brother, was put in charge of the expedition because Cecilius did not want to go.|`|FqlDw08Taa	i think it is called mary land because the person who came up with the name had a loved one named mary

Articular cartilage is composed mainly of water, proteoglycans, and collagen. The joint is surrounded by a fibrous joint capsule lined with synovium, which produces lubricating synovial fluid and nutrients required by the tissues within the joint. Joint motion is provided by the muscles that are attached to the bone with tendons. Strong flexible ligaments connected across the bones stabilize the joint and may constrain its motion. Different ranges of motion result from several basic types of diarthrodial joints: pivot, gliding, hinge, saddle, condyloid, and ball-and-socket. See also Collagen; Skeletal system.

H8gsDRWeaa	Fritz Rausenberger is usually given credit for inventing this weapon, which is any of several 420-millimetre (16.5-inch) howitzers that were used by advancing German forces to batter the Belgian forts at Liège and Namur in August 1914, at the start of World War I.<br>  <br>  The guns were designed and built by the firm of Krupp, Germany's largest armaments manufacturer, in the years before the war for the express purpose of overcoming modern forts built of reinforced concrete. The Big Berthas were the largest and most powerful artillery produced to that time. Each gun propelled a shell weighing 2,100 pounds (950 kg) for a distance of almost 9 miles (14 km). The shells were equipped with delayed-action fuses to explode after having penetrated a fortified target. The gun and its carriage, when fully assembled, weighed about 75 tons and was operated and serviced by a crew of about 280 men. For transport to the battlefield, the howitzer was disassembled into four sections—gun barrel, mounting, carriage, and ground platform—and loaded onto railway cars, which carried them to Belgium. After detraining, the sections were hauled by tractor-driven wagons to the firing sites and reassembled. Big Berthas and Austrian Skoda 305-millimetre howitzers were brought into action against the complex of Belgian forts around Liège on Aug. 12, 1914. They destroyed most of the forts in the next four days, thereby enabling the German army to sweep westward through southern Belgium on its way to invade northern France. Farther to the west, the forts around the city of Namur were similarly battered into surrender by Big Berthas and Skoda guns on August 21–25.<br>  <br>  According to some sources, the nickname for the guns was bestowed by the Krupps in honor of Frau Bertha von Bohlen, head of the family. In popular usage, the name Big Bertha was also applied to the extreme long-range cannons with which the Germans shelled Paris in 1918, but these guns are more properly known as Paris Guns.|`|Fnp2MIycaa	The Krupp 420mm Howitzer.

AA11934671	Genders - masculine, feminine, common, and neuter.<br>  The vast majority of  English nouns are common (i.e. equally applicable to both males and females) and are spelt the same regardless of whether they refer to men or women; the few occasions when there is a difference in spelling are mostly when the nouns refer to certain types of occupation (e.g. actor / actress, waiter / waitress, policeman / policewoman) or to certain animals (e.g. fox / vixen, lion / lioness,  boar / sow, bull / cow). A noun is classed as neuter if it refers to an object.<br>  Plurals are usually made just by adding an -s. Common exceptions are nouns ending in -f (plural ending -ves, with the f omitted), and nouns ending in a consonant followed by a -y (e.g. lady) (plural ending -ies (no y)). Some nouns, including the names of fish, are the same in both singular and plural form, while some exist only as plurals (e.g. scissors, trousers). As with irregular plurals in other languages, knowledge of irregular plural forms can only be gained through practice. Finally, unlike in other European languages, the gender of an English noun makes no difference to the spelling of any adjective which describes the noun.|`|5678371c4d9925ba2d26e6ba9c43fca8aa	Nouns usually don't have genders in the English language.  A few do, like alumnus (male) and alumna (female).  Nouns are usually pluralized by using the letter s at the end.  For example, cat is pluralized cats.  There are many, many exceptions though, which you'll have to learn on your own.  Going back to the alumnus/alumna example, those words are pluralized in the form "alumni."|`|becaa9015013c0c8dba0a60d6313e13faa	You don't have much of a life do you..get a dog

Some info from wikipedia:<br>  Whales:<br>  The genital organs are retracted into cavities of the body during swimming, so as to be streamlined and reduce drag. Most whales do not maintain fixed partnerships during mating; in many species the females have several mates each season.<br>  <br>  Sharks:<br>  The sex of a shark can be easily determined. The males all have their pelvic fins modified into a pair of claspers. The name is somewhat misleading as they are not used to hold on to the female, but are the shark's version of the mammalian penis. (As a side note, Class Chondrichthyes has the distinction of having the animal with the largest intromittent organ — an organ used for transmitting sperm — in relation to body length. This animal is the clearnose skate (Raja eglanteria) which has claspers of 15 cm (6 in) in size on a fish that reaches 1 m (3 feet) in length.)<br>  <br>  Mating has rarely been observed in sharks. The smaller catsharks often mate with the male curling around the female. In the less flexible species the two sharks swim parallel to each other while the male inserts the clasper into the female's oviduct. Many females in the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping her to maintain position. The bite marks can also come from the courtship of the sharks. The male may come and bite the edges of the female to show his interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand the bites a male will give them during mating.<br>  <br>  Sharks have a much different reproductive strategy than most fishes. Instead of producing huge numbers of eggs and larvae (99.9% of which never reach sexual maturity in fishes that use this strategy) sharks normally produce around a dozen pups, some species up to 70-80 and some as few as 2-3. These pups are either protected by egg cases or born live. No known sharks provide parental protection for their young, but females have a hormone that is released into their blood during the pupping season that apparently keeps them from feeding.<br>  <br>   <br>  Egg case of Port Jackson shark - found on Vincentia beach, Jervis Bay Territory, AustraliaThere are three ways in which shark pups are born:<br>  <br>  Oviparity - Some sharks lay eggs. In most of these species, the developing embryo is protected by an egg case with the consistency of leather. Some of these cases are corkscrewed into crevices for protection. When they wash up empty on beaches, the egg cases are sometimes called mermaid's purses. Oviparous sharks include the horn shark, catshark, Port Jackson shark, and swellshark. <br>  Viviparity - These sharks actually maintain a placental link to the developing young, more analogous to mammals than other fishes. The young are born alive and fully functional. Hammerheads, the requiem sharks (like the bull and tiger sharks), the basking shark and the smooth dogfishes fall into this category. Dogfishes also have the longest known gestation period of any shark, 22 months. The blue shark produces the most young of sharks ever recorded, the maximum reported being 82. <br>  Ovoviviparity - Most sharks utilize this method. The young are nourished by the yolk of their egg and by fluids secreted by glands in the walls of the oviduct. The eggs hatch within the oviduct, and the young continue to be nourished by the remnants of the yolk and the oviduct's fluids. As in viviparity, the young are born alive and fully functional. Sometimes they are functional even before being born, as some species practice oophagy, where the first to hatch eat the remaining eggs in the oviduct. Grey nurse sharks, shortfin makos, threshers, porbeagles and possibly great whites have oophagous young. The survival strategy for the species that do this is that the young are able to grow to an even larger size before being born. The whale shark is now considered to be in this category after having been classified as oviparous for a long time. Whale shark eggs found are now thought to have been aborted. Most ovoviviparous sharks generally give birth in sheltered areas, including bays, river mouths, and shallow reefs. They choose such areas mainly because of the protection from predators (mainly other sharks) and the abundance of food. <br>  <br>  Here's a good site about whale sex:<br>  <a href="http://whale.wheelock.edu/archives/ask00/0221.html" rel="nofollow">http://whale.wheelock.edu/archives/ask00...</a> <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|49535dac6e76bcfc65977488bc5fbca8aa	<a href="http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/aug2000/967758606.Zo.r.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/aug...</a><br>  <br>  this is one site I found....

My understanding is that manatees and whales hold each other in a sort of embrace, the parts align, and things go from there.  I don't think the same motions are necessary for whales and manatees as for humans.  Even so, they are able to arch their backs, as that is a large part of how they get from one place to another, moving their tails up and down.<br>  <br>  Wikipedia has more details on sharks for you.

Autonomy is a concept found in moral, political, and bioethical philosophy. Within these contexts it refers to the capacity of a rational individual to make an informed, uncoerced decision. In moral and political philosophy, autonomy is often used as the basis for determining moral responsibility for one's actions. One of best known philosophical theories of autonomy was developed by Kant.

7wdooasKaa	Don't try to overthink it all. That's what everyone thinks before going to high school, but it's really not bad and honestly you'll look back later & you'll say like oh why was I so afraid. These movies you see aren't really what High School is really like, afterall it is the movies & they overexagerate things. Freshman year is one of the greatest years in high school because you get to meet more people and really find your own kind of group. Sure people are tall and big, mostly the juniors & seniors because they're older but they're really not mean because they're to busy doing their own thing & it would be immature if they were so called mean. Take it from someone who has been there and seen it from the same perspective as you it's not bad at all. I actually cried before my first day & I look back now and say wow that was foolish of me and now I'm a Junior & high school has been overall really great and has made me grown. I'm sure you'll have a great experience in high school & best of luck in doing well!|`|ecWtpGoAaa	High school is nowhere near what movies depict of them. <br>  I used to think high school was like the movies as well and truth be told I was wrong!<br>  <br>  High school is actually very fun and remember study and reserve time for fun!|`|MyUi3Blyaa	In a school you'll be safe.|`|NooOSb2caa	Whoa there!

He meets the witches, and they tell him that no one born of woman will ever hurt him, and that he will be kind. <br>  -He and his wife, who he loves, decide to kill the king. They kill the kind, and his friend for some reason I can't remember. <br>  -He becomes king. <br>  -Lady Macbeth kills herself out of guilt, which devestates him. <br>  -He is killed by Banquo's son, or someone, who was 'ripped from his mothers womb.' <br>  <br>  I guess he does it mainly from lust for power, but also for his love of Lady Macbeth, in brief. <br>  <br>  Hope that is helpful. Good luck. |`|9q4HophZaa	the witches gave him a prophecy which, as he understood it, meant that he would be king, and invincible.

zCHnMeXbaa	Flashbacks are a good literary device for developing paragraphs if they meet the following conditions: <br>  <br>  1. the flashback must be relevant to the story.  Does it help explain some action or occurrence pertaining to an important character?<br>  2. the flashback is in effect a first person narrative of an action or occurrence.  Make sure the reader knows whom the flashback refers to.

As long as you study and do your standards (things you should know for the exams at the end of the two years), you'll be fine. You get to design your own labs; it's really fun. There's no need to take regular bio beforehand either. I would recommend taking regular chemistry before taking IB Chem though. You'll have to wait until junior year to take the class.|`|c922633c597731abb86aae9cac7f9c32aa	well its up to you wether you study or not. listen to the teacher and go home and revise on what you in class.

Go up to one of your parents or a counselor with a list of valid problems you have with him that are easily proven and ask them to take it to the principal(I wouldn't say the one about the talking, it's pretty hard for a classroom to function without a no talking rule) You can list the one about losing kid's work. Also, what does he blame on the kids?<br>  <br>  Try not to beg, and be professional. Try not to come off as a whiny kid, and as a smart, respectful person. Say mam and sir, adults are prejudiced, and will think your an angel.<br>  <br>  Also, the accusation about looking down girls shirts is extremely serious, that's sexual misconduct. If you really believe he looks down their shirts for sexual purposes, then you need to say something, but if not don't say anything.

In most states it is illegal to record someone without their permission and lots of schools are VERY much against this. Why? Because students often try to trap teachers and administrators because they are troublemakers who don't have anything better to do with their time. I can speak from experience that a student at my school tried to tape his teachers secretly and when he was caught HE was the one who was punished.<br>  <br>  It all of this rebellion did nothing, then it sounds to me like there wasn't much validity to the claims being made. If I were you, I would just stay out of this man's way and take care of your business. The school year is almost over, so maybe next year you will have someone else as a homeroom teacher.|`|hfDohxp5aa	When you have issues with a teacher, first make sure you didn't irritate them. If you are innocent, take a hand held tape recorder or a cell phone with a camera, because you need documented proof. and you may have to go with adults to the school board or the superintendent because the school board hires the superintendent and so the school board is at the top.  Get out of the school and to the district office with your complaints.

IgzvavGaaa	8 2/2 would equal to 9, so 9 - 4 1/3 would equal 4 2/3|`|5678371c4d9925ba2d26e6ba9c43fca8aa	First, convert each of the mixed numbers into one fraction.<br>  <br>  8 2/2 is actually 8 + 1, because 2/2=1.  3/3=1, and 4/4=1, 5/5=1, and so on: Any number over itself equals one.  So 8 2/2 is equal to 9.  Since you want this to be in fraction form, make it 9/1.  To make any whole number a fraction, just put it over a 1.<br>  <br>  4 1/3:  1/3 does not turn into a whole number, so you'll have to convert 4 into a fraction instead.  As I just explained, 4 in fraction form is 4/1.  Then, you need to add 4/1 + 1/3.  To do this (or to add any two fractions) you need to find a common denominator.  If you don't know this, the denominator means the bottom of the fraction. ("numerator" is the word for the top of the fraction)<br>  A common denominator is a number that each of the two denominators are evenly divisible by. In this case, the common denominator is 3, because 3 divided by 3 is 1 and 3 divided by 1 is 3.  <br>  Now that you know what the common denominator is, you need to make each of the two fractions HAVE that denominator.  1/3 already does have that denominator, but 4/1 doesn't.  So, multiply the numerator and the denominator by 3, and you get 12/3.  4/1=12/3<br>  Then, add 12/3 + 1/3 to get 13/3<br>  So, 4 1/3 = 13/3.<br>  <br>  Now, you have to subtract 13/3 from 9/1.  To do that, you again have to find a common denominator.  And again, a common denominator is 3 (this is a coincidence.  It won't always happen like that.)  You don't need to do anything to 13/3, but multiply the top and the bottom of 9/1 each by 3, to get 27/3.<br>  <br>  So now you have 27/3 - 13/3.  Your final answer is 14/3.<br>  Good luck with future fractions problems!

You can't sell a product without its aid.<br>  <br>  Advertising goes as far as ad posters on the handles of escalators and train station floors. Even on shirts of regular people. Advertising will reach even the remote areas where the product can be sold. It can be embedded.... think about the possibilities. That's how far advertising will go.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6f01168b429a90a29b1f233e2e3adb77aa	Until it intrudes on someone's rights.

Multiply the 2 outside of the parenthesis, by the 2 and 6 inside of the parenthesis. You will then have 4+12-2 squared.<br>  <br>  2 squared is 4.

7SqLDQ8Naa	It seems as though you are very well rounded. Make sure as you take these classes you don't provide yourself with an overload because if you begin to fall behind it will make your grades suffer. Having community service projects(especially outside of school) is excellent, and being an athlete is also well. Of course you should emphasize what you are great at when you do your application. You should take a tour of the school and find out when a representative from NCSSM will be coming to your area because if i recall correctly this is about the time they start going out to schools.
