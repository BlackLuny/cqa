20070424054222AANzqO3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm running out of reasons that why shouldn't I dedicate an everlasting peace to myself?	The only reason that keeps me from doing this favor to myself is my family because I don’t wana hurt them, but it is getting harder and harder to take the pain anymore. Pain of living in a f Islamic country while I’m not a Moslem anymore, pain of seeing the women and girls of my country being treated like slaves while I deeply believe in their equal rights, pain of watching the savage governments of my country destroying every thing that has left; every one in this country is desperate and sad, and I guess my biggest problem is that I lost the god in the middle of the way, so now I have nothing or no one to give me hope or willing to live. My father and mother are both conservative Moslems and they always blame me for protecting my sisters rights. I’m really sick and tired of foolish argues with my parents about my sister, and I’m really sick and tired of this life.
20070424100604AAhcdRX	Family & Relationships;Friends	When you fall in love with a friend who is "unavailable"...?	...because he/she is married and accept it and decide to remain friends. At the same time you move on, make new friends, meet new people and fall in love again with someone else. Will your feelings for your friend ever go away? Or will that friend always be very special in your heart no matter how many times you fall in love with someone else? Anybody knows?

20070425060951AA9Fk6d	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How did i get like this and what can I do to change?	well im a shy guy now but once I was the loudest talkish clown in the class. That was back in primary school and ever since then Im just getting worse and worse. At first I just couldnt talk to girls and now its resulted in not talking to my friends either. Sure I might say the occassional conversation but so little some days I count how many times I spoke at school. However im great at home and with adults Im totally fine its just with people 18 below. I get more and more shy ive realised the more I get rejected by a girl. No girl has ever said yes to me that I can go out with them and for some reason this is making me more shy to my friends (guys) and the girls. Someone please help is it just something im going through because im 15 or is it a problem.

Cause the house and cars he has are hot... And once go Mac, you won't go back.       Ya'll have fun at the Park alone.... Also Enjoy talking over the phone...  But you never once invite him at your home...  Cause you don't want Mom to see the clown...  At school you ignore him...  He smiles at you, but you refuse to grin...  Your friends laugh each time he sings.... And say some terrible things...  Tonight your friends are heading to Florida... A state that looks like Jamaica... But you can't go cause you got no money... All your friends say " I am so sorry."      Off they go to have fun... Your weather is cloudy while theirs is fill with Sun... You feel like hiding, but no where to run... Then he says " Are you ok, Hun?"        Then you say, " What are you doing here?"    He says " Cause I care.... And don't worry, we're going there."      What does this teach you?

Do you think that it is good to give your significant other space in a relationship if you are arguing all of the time or should you try and stick it out and work at the issues? The arguments are mostly about something petty and both parties feel as though the other could really be the one. So should they give each other space or talk it out?

We fell in love and had a great time for the first 3 years untill she moved in.  I payed all the bills and she helped out very little with bills and stuff. I also would work about 12 hours a day come home and find nothing on the dinner table and I would have to cook she never made an effort to learn how to cook.  When we broke up she took everything of hers and one of my dogs that i spent $3000 dollars on vet bills on and she never even showed one bit of emotion like she never loved me.  I hoestly think she was seeing someone else at least the last 3 months of our relationship...  I hate her so much and wish I could forget about her but its tough waking up alone every morning.  I dont want her back but I miss her companionship.

20090203132534AAgKL2h	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he probably think I am a bimbo or a ****?	Okayy... so there's this really REALLY hott totally geeky guy that i like. He is the type that most girls would disdain and NOT crush on. He is 16 y/o, and i am 17 y/o. He has a YOUTUBE account, and so do I. On mine, my featured video is the pussycat dolls uncensored "Don't Cha" where they say "You should be f***cking wit me." My other videos are like "Im a slave 4 u", "Dirrty" by Christina Aguilera, you get the picture. I am soo titliated by him that when i see him, my voice becomes tiny and valley girlish (its kinda always like valley girlish, but is more so around a guy i like). he does not go to my school, and believe it or not, i look better on the weekends (so he always sees me with face powder and mascara on). Btw: i have long, lucious lashes. Sometimes i wear gloss on my succulent lips when i see him. We volunteer together someplace, and the dress is casual. I cannot wear super nice clothes, b/c they will get dirtied up due to the type of volunteer work; therefore i ususally wear tight black Hard Tail pants, or sorta tight Victoria's secret PINK pants (i kinda have a big a***). A couple of times i wore a Juicy Couture velour jacket, b/c i was headed someplace afterwards. As far as shirts, i usually wear a clingy, basic crewneck layered on top of a camisole. Several times i have worn a lowcut tank top that says VS PINK on it (and i recently bought a phenomial push up bra and wore the tank with that). I am a C cup bra, and the tank top showed quite a lot of cleavage (and i think i saw him taking a peek). Then i wore an addidas jacket over this zipped pretty low. Once i wore a REAL silver tiffany heart necklace. I carry a flashy Betsey Johnson bag whenever i see him. I dunnoo if this is relavant, but i drive a Lexus. On my facebook, there are some pics of me posing and a couple guys commented on how sexy i look (they are NOT those cheesy pics that girls take themselves in front of a mirror). There is another photo of me grinding with some guy at a halloween party (but it is hard to tell, b/c there is kinda a crowd). This sexy geeky dude knows i love fashion, shopping, and JUICY COUTURE. He is not the athletic type, and i am not exaclty good at problem solving, so i ask him to help me with things at the shelter (not to the point where it is annoying). Just thinking about him makes me horrrrrnyyy... so i wonder if he can detect this. So, based on my intrests, dress, and manerisms, does this guy probably think i am a bimbo or a ****?

I like to go up to her and say that I'm gonna steal her brother, and that she'll never see him again lol.  Everytime I say that to her, she starts to cry and get upset.

20090203132432AANYlSe	Family & Relationships;Friends	I don't want to be shy anymore!?	Ok so I'm a girl, 16 years old and I've always been overly shy. When I was in kindergarden, I NEVER talked to the teacher. Well, the first time I talked to her was in March...      I'm now 16 and I'm trying to overcome my shyness. I've always been known as a shy gal and I live in a small town where everyone knows each other. I want to overcome my shyness so bad. One thing I did to help this year is to join a class where we prepare a musical show. I LOVE music but I'm so shy. I'm not shy to get up on the stage and perform in front of an audience but I'm shy around a group of persons (exemple: a class) Especially when there are guys around. Any ideas to help me overcome my shyness?

Okay, basically I bet I could get an A- or more on an essay with my rather creepy friends; but I only got B+.   So now- guess what? I get to be spanked!   I'm really nervous; they've they're going to video me!!!   Argh!      I have to pick out of these...:   A) Over the knee, fully clothed, with a wooden spoon...    B) The diaper position, spanked with paddle over knickers.   C) Bent over a desk, held down, bare bum with paddle.   They're going to roll two dice, and whatever the 2 numbers are added together, they're going to multiply them x2 and that will be how many strokes I get.   I am REALLY not looking forward to this!      Yeah, this seems like a dodgy question.   But I'm not a perv, or a troll.   I just need to stop making bets like this.

20090203131755AA2DAro	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Questions about marriage?	If you get married and your husband's mother does something you don't like.. It's legitimate enough.. Who should come first.. the wife, or the mother? What if the mother is always coming over or calling and getting into their space and taking up their time. And talking to the husband about decisions that should be between the wife and husband only.. She's just in their space too much! Like they moved to have their own space and yet....you know.. What would you do? Who comes first?
20090203132221AAmMKGi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this make me a bad person? ?	My bf of a year just broke up with me to get back together with his ex wife. She has tried repeatedly to do this during the course of our relationship and it never worked so I didn't think it would work this time either (boy was I stupid).     Anyways, I've been aware of what she was trying to do for about a week now but every day he was with me. Saying he loved me, wants to be with me, and even continued looking at houses with me. I spent litterally the entire weekend including Monday with him so I had no idea that on Monday he was going to give her a key and tell her she could move in.     He says its just for the kids and he has told her in front of me he doesn't want a relationship with her, that he loves me and is doing this just so the kids could be living with both their parents (something he didn't have). Her reasons aren't so good...she is doing it just so he would break up with me cause she knew we were looking at houses together. She has already on the 1st night started doing everything he hated (not answering her phone calls, lying to him, not listening to what he wants etc). I don't really expect this to work, its the 3rd time, both times she left him. Is it wrong of me to not want this to work out? Does it make me a bad person? I'm so hurt right now its not even funny.    His daughter told us this weekend he didn't want them getting back together and that she had told her mom that too. They are completely disregarding her feelings cause they are so selfish.

20090203131623AAC6WIv	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you think my friend is gay?	I have a friend, and he hangs out with girls more then he hangs out with boys. Another on of my friends said that he's got to be gay if he does that. I told her that I didn't think that he was gay, and then asked him, and he said no. My other friend still doesn't believe him. He doesn't act seem to be gay and had a girlfriend last year. I also have another friend that hangs out with girls more then he hangs out with guys, and the same friend said that that was because he has a girlfriend, but he hung out with girls before that.       The friend that I am talking about:   ~acts like a regular teenage boy   ~got in trouble once this year for grabbing a girls butt (haha, my friend that thinks he's gay doesn't belive that, but he's not a perv or nothing... it was just a joke and it was one of his friends, so she didn't mind)   ~is a good student, and generally gets good grades   ~likes animals   ~is really annoying sometimes   ~enjoys cooking at other peoples houses (since in his words "my mom don't know how to cook so we don't have cooking supplies at my house")      Do you think that he is gay?      I don't care if he's gay. He's still a really good friend no matter what. I don't think that he would admit it, even if he was to me or anyone else, since if the friend who thinks he's gay every found out, the whold school would know, and in out community, people aren't very excepting of gay people.      He does have friends that are guys, and he hangs out with them alot, but he seems to prefere the sompany of me and the friend that thinks he's gay.      He came over to my house and we cooked. It was just for fun, and he had no idea what he was doing since he didn't even know how to turn on the mixer.       When my friend asked if he was gay, he got all surprised, and looked at her as if she was crazy. Then he said "What the F*ck? No! I'm not gay.

20090203132446AAu5Hye	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He turned to me and said "screw you"?	We had friends over for dinner and were all joking around about our spouses. I was looking at him to make a point (jokingly) about his coming home late from work and before I could say anything he says "screw you".  I was embarrassed and so was my friend.  He doesn't say these things at home, but when we're out.  It is though he is trying to attack me or hurt me before I can tease him.  I frequently feel like I am more of a buddy when we are out than a woman (much less a wife).  He is really a nice guy but doesn't treat me any respect as a woman.  Not the way a gentleman should treat a lady. How should I handle this?

20090203132006AACfnlh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need opinions about this girl I have been talking to for a while.?	I have been talking to this girl for a while now. Probably 5-1/2 months to be exact. We have done a couple things together and we plan on doing more. Recently, we exchanged phone numbers and we have talked on average 2-1/2 hours every night for the past week and a half. Some nights have been quite a bit longer. I like her a lot and I want to be more than just friends. Usually after talking to a girl for so long and nothing happening, I just move on. Not with this girl though. I still have the same feelings that I had when we first started talking. Here's the problem. I'm not sure if she thinks of me like I think of her. In most cases the answer would be, yes she does like you enough to be more than just friends. Here's the catch, she's Chinese and I'm American. She is fine with interracial relationships. She has been in America for a little over a year now. Since she is Chinese, I'm not sure how to continue this. I have never had feelings for a Chinese girl before.       Here's the question. Does she like me enough to be more than just friends? If she wasn't interested in being more than just friends, would she talk to me every night for several hours? Since she is Chinese, how should I go about taking the next step?       I do appreciate everyone's opinion but, I am mainly looking for opinions from other Chinese girls.

20090203132045AAg8pyj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I screwed up so badly please help and try not to judge?	Okay make no mistake I have been struggling with some serious mental issues years (since I was a very young child). I got pregnant last year and all my issues started to come to a head. I lost my job and lied about it to everyone I knew since I didn't want to admit I'd screwed up, and my decision-making skills were very bad. My husband and I split up, but lately we have been trying to reconcile because I came clean with him about everything. But I did one other thing that I honestly pushed out of my mind. Back before the baby was born we had no heat in our house AT ALL. We were broke and I was desperate for money because obviously CPS would take him if we had no heat. We fought about it every day. As I got more and more desperate, one of my friends suggested I try scamming someone seeking sex on the Internet. So I went to some CraigsList-like site and found a guy who was going to be in town on business and was offering women money to "visit" him. I contacted him, told him my sob story, promised to meet him and agreed to things I'd do (which was disgusting and almost killed me to type) and asked if he could wire me the money upfront ($300). He did, I got it, and I deleted my email account and switched my prepaid cellphone number to a different number. At the time I felt no remorse because I was out of my head, but now that I've been medicated and in therapy I obviously see what a terrible thing it was to do. But to make things worse, my husband found the emails yesterday and he thinks I actually did it. He keeps calling me a prostitute. I didn't actually do it. But how can I prove that? And how can I make the situation right now that I'm facing it realistically? It's such a bad mess.

I found out my best friend liked him.  I broke up with him.  Then 3 hours later she asked him out.  He said yeah.  They went out for like 2 weeks.  She cheated on him.  I told her that I liked him.  Just because of that she wouldn't break up with him.  I told him about her cheating on him.  He broke up with her.  He asked me out, I asked her.  She told me to go for it.  I said yeah [i never stopped liking him.]  We have been going out for like a week.  She lied and said that I was cheating on him.  He broke up with me.  Then he asked her out.  She wants to go out with him.  Even though she never even liked him.  & she told me this.  Who is wrong about the situation.  Me or Her?
20070514010254AAoSty4	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does he like me .... as a friend or... girlfriend?	there is this guy that i think likes me, he did ask me out 2 years ago but i had to say no (loong story) we are still firends anyway i wasnt sure if he still likes me. he sticks up for me (sometimes) when i get teased, he always says hi, he smiles, compliments me sometimes ("nice hat" e.t.c ) and he never is mean to me.      just wondering what you think? does he like me as a friend or girlfiend?       yes i do like him.....      ok!! fine ill tell the story... well first we were friends and then i was asked in front of the whole class whether i liked him or not...i said no... errr lets just say his heart was broken...anyway.       then everone was gossiping about it, and then it just got so overated!! he then asked me out , i said yes... and then something came up and i reliesed that i wasnt ready for a date (we were both 13 !! )so then i said no .. and we still remain friends.
20070606114604AAt3fzx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this man really meant for me??? For those who believe in God only?	3 months ago, this thing happened: my boyfriend who’s living in the US. One time, he didn’t send me emails for three days, and I got really worried…I don’t even know if something bad happened to him.. So I cried so hard and end up asking God for a sign, I told him this “IF HE’S REALLY MEANT FOR ME, I WANT TO RECEIVE AN EMAIL FROM HIM TOMORROW, IF I DIDN’T , THEN I AM MORE THAN WILLING TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT HE’S NOT REALLY FOR ME… ’” too risky for me to asked that because I really love him. Morning came, I immediately open my email, then I received three emails from him… in one of those emails he’s telling he is sorry for not sending me emails for three days , for the place where he is for three days has no internet(WIFI), so he almost gave up until something’s telling him he needs to open his laptop again and give it a try, and he was surprised that he already have internet and was able to send me emails… the next day, he didn’t send me emails again, and on the next day he send me an email saying he’s wondering why after sending me emails during that time, he lost his internet again.    TAKE NOTE: during that time, he didn’t even know that I asked a sign from GOD. It was only two months ago (I think) when I told him about me asking signs from God.
20070604122251AAB1SVN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can guys push away the one they love and miss the most?	I was watching "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air" and it was the episode where jackie (will's childhood friend) came back. She confronted him and said, "when you moved out here, why didn't you call me. you called everyone else but me..." and his excuse was that he "missed her too much" - probably the most out of everyone      I don't get it - so if a guy really misses you, he won't call? Is it because they're "afraid to lose you"? I'm confused.      A similar thing is going on with me right now - my best friend (for a few yrs - we're special to each other, have some feelings for each other) well, he's going through a really hard time right now and i'm someone he's always felt comfortable opening up to but lately he's been pushing me away the most. He's talked with everyone but me.       Guys, can you help clear this up? please?

20070604075932AAM3Tpk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would a guy do this?	Why would a guy keep seeing someone for a year that they cared about knowing he would never be serious about them?  I live 3 hours away so it takes effort for us to see one another.  Every once in awhile he will say something like "oh there are jobs like that here".  Then says I have done the long distance thing before and I hated it.  He knows I am relationship minded, so why do it?

20070611085059AA7PmKU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she know?	i'm friends w/ this girl, who i use to sorta date. i really love her now, but she has a bf, who isn't very supportive of her so she comes to me with her emotional issues. we live 500 miles away. i asked her for advice about this girl i found out likes me. the girl i like said    "go for it, just make sure u aren't involved with anyone else first. It's amazing how much someone can like another person but not be willing to make the move. It's amazing how many people you might be able to get with who you won't get with because you think you have no chance. But actually you do have a chance. Take those chances :)" she told me to add something extreme to my character.    then i said what if u like a person who is inv. with someone else, she said "so what if they are in a relationship? maybe they aren't happy. u should at least tell her." later i asked her if she was happy in her relationship and she said "i don't know."    does she know that i am talking about her? what should i do?
20070523184407AA7Bdrg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I want an honest answer???	This girl like me at work. She is telling everyone about it.   And everyone knows. To be honest I like her too she looks cute! Would it be ok if ask her   ” I have heard some rumors that you like me” I just wanna see what she says before we go out. So the question is would I blow it if I ask her that. I mean it wouldn’t hurt if she likes me. She will give honest answer and then I will give her an honest answer too!   Or can I ask her “what her feelings are toward me Friendship or relationship" I’ve already asked her to watch a movie with me and she said yes she will watch a movie with me.

20070527211115AAPj7vY	Family & Relationships;Family	Tell in-laws they need to spend time w/grandson?	My husband and I have a 2 1/2 year old beautiful, nice, polite little boy.  My sister-in-law has a daughter who is six months older.  My husband's stepfather pays his granddaughter all the attention.  (Example: he offers to watch her all the time, he buys her new toys, spends quality time with her, ect.)   It is completely opposite for my son.  The stepfather will sit in front of the T.V., and ignore my son.  He doesn't say hello, good-bye or anything else.  (He also doesn't offer to watch him, doesn't buy him toys, ect.)     This bothers me because I feel that he is losing time with his grandson, son, and myself.  The three of us don't go over as often as we used to (used to be once a week, now it's maybe once every three weeks) because of this issue.   How do I tell the stepfather, he needs to start acting like a grandfather to my son?  (Side note: there are no family issues between us.  We get along very well!)

20070601134925AAp8ecl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl moving to another school!!! PLEASE HELP?	so there is a girl that i really like.   i told her a long time ago that i liked her, but she said she doesnt liked me.( i told her by sms, and i think she got mad with me)   We started to avoid each other and i told her something really stupid.( not insulting her, just saying things without sense)   She started to think that i was a bad guy.   In the other day we were making a history test and i asked an answer to that friend but he told her to say it to me( because she was in front of me). And for my surprise she really told it!   so at the end of the day i asked my friend what he had done so she would talk to me, he said that he had told her that i was a very nice guy( but i didnt told him to tell her that) and she started to think the same.   So the problem is:   We are in the 9th grade and she isnt decided if she will change of school.   So now i feel really guilty because i avoided her all this time and i thought  i would have the next year to talk to her again.   What should i do?
20090203132650AAXfO7T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why Is My Boyfriend Mad At Me!?!?! PLEASE READ?	this is gonna be long - but it's entertaining, i guess. so read it anyway and tell me what you think      my boyfriend was supposed to come over my house today, and his dad offered him a lift since it's snowing outside. my boyfriend's dad is really strict and old fashioned, so my boyfriend just lied and said he was going to his friends house.   his dad drove him to his friends house (not too far from my house by car - on foot, it's pretty far), so my boyfriend called me and told me to go walk to where he was.      i wanted him over my house since it's freezing outside, and i have my period so i don't feel like walking all the way there (keep in mind it's a pretty long walk)...then he got kind of mad, and decided he would just walk to my house.   he got lost, and told me the street he was on and told me to mapquest it. so i did, but it was pretty confusing, so i just read him exactly what mapquest said.   supposedly i made him get even more lost then he already was.   he was pissed at me and told me to shut up, and he called me stupid and was like "oh my god, you're so stupid, i'm already sick (he had food poisioning a few days ago) and i'm walking in the freezing cold for nothing. i'm not coming over, i don't want to see you. i'm mad at you. this is your fault. now i feel like i'm going to throw up."      i convinced him to come over, and he was like "fine but only for a few minutes." as soon as he was about to leave (a few minutes after he arrived at my house), i cried and told him not to go. he ended up staying, and apologized for being a jerk; he was just angry, upset, and sick.      then he starts talking about his weight.   i told him i thought he looked fine. he's not skinny, but not chubby. he's average/normal. so that's what i told him... and then he brang up his friend (who's a bit muscular) and i was like "he's not even skinner than you, he's just more brolic." and my boyfriend seemed to be angry about that. he kept telling me "i'm mad at you" but wouldn't tell me why.      is it because of the "i got him lost" thing? or his weight issue?   please help.

20070521095426AAQzn1x	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I should interprete this how?	My byf of 8 mo. decided not to live together & I AM OK with it.  Because his apartment (which he got w/his 20yr old son) is so small, I offered to store his belongings at my house.I am VERY ok with this.  It took him aback a little the day they moved & so I comforted him best I could, gave him some time - he's ok now.  He asked if I felt if things seemed more homey - I asked if by that he meant was I ok with his stuff at the house & I said of course.  Later that night as we were watching tv - we saw a special on PEZ dispensers & he chimed up with how funny it was they had a bride & groom that "we could put ontop of our cake".  WOW - that hit pretty weird as we had talked about marriage & knew we would SOMEDAY, but that he since he couldn't commit to living together, I put marriage & a wedding way on the back burner.  Now, because he see's my Father is ill & only has a few years at most, is he reconsidering or is this just talk?  He does this often & I worry he's feeling pushed.

20070522165658AAY4HvG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What move should I make?	I'm in love for the first time. The boy is so incredibly special to me, and we are the closest of friends. I asked him out once, but his parents didn't want him to get into a relationship. I became involved with a different boy, who I broke up with. I very casually laid my feelings out to him today, but I don't know if he understood (we were 20 feet away in a small crowd). We had a really hard time saying goodbye, and I'm not sure if I should make our first trip to the movies into a date-type thing or keep it as friends. We've known eachother for around 5 years.

20070522193529AAHP6to	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I have a chance?	I like this girl who has always thought of me as a friend.  My best friend told her I like her.  My best friend has been telling her all kinds of lies about me recently and it has really hurt.  I'm not even sure if he' my friend anymore which really sucks......but anyway he is always talking to her and saying all this stuff like "Talk to him all the time he loves you!" or "Would you go out with him?".  When he asked her if she would go out with me she said she didn't have an answer yet and I'm pretty sure that means no....she told someone else she felt sorry for me but I don't think that really helps.....any advice on how I could fix this or if I should just move on or how to get her would be great!  By the way, I really really like this girl. A lot.

But, it seems after all his talk about our future, he was just a dreamer and not a do-er.

20070526194334AARXrkz	Family & Relationships;Family	Moving back in with my parents....?	I kind of have a restless nature and after I graduated high school I went to college for two years.  Then I got the travel bug and have been wandering for the last seven years...everywhere.  I am now 24 and about to move back home with my newly single mother (divorce) and two younger sisters.  In other cultures, this is acceptable, but I have found that back in the US it isn't very acceptable.  I have just decided that now is the time for me to finish up with school and home is the right place for it.  (Don't worry, not mooching off of my mother...it'll actually be helping her out as I will be paying rent)...what does everyone think?

20070527054418AAYZL7s	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why can't I make friends anymore, or get a girlfriend?	Whats up everybody. Here's the situation. I'm a 19 year old college student who just recently moved off campus after a two year stint of uneventful on campus college life (didn't know it was possible did you?). Anyway, I didn't make many friends at the school and nothing really took off for me there. I personally believe that it was the school and the people there because I had plenty of friends in high school, and I currently have plenty of friends at work. Anyway, my roomates who are boyfriend and girlfriend, and pretty much the only friends I have outside of work, went away for two weeks, and my boredom seems endless. I'm a good looking guy, I'm about 6'4", atheletic build, nice features, light-skinned and I get looks from woman all the time. It's just that nothing ever comes of it. I am kinda shy, but not too shy to the point where I should be this lonely. What's wrong with me? I am SO bored and lonely and I'm just wondering why everyone else doesn't seem to have this problem.

A year has passed, we got pregnant and had a child, yet there has been not one more mention from him about marriage. One day, it was driving me crazy, so I asked him, are you ever gonna marry me? He said, I can't believe you won't ever let me just do things on my own time, becoming very defensive. I said, either we get married or it's over, and he walked out. We got over that one quickly, as marriage is not so important as to lose our relationship, but does this mean he will never marry me? Should I do as he said and just wait for him to decide?

So, as I have said in a previous question my girlfriend told me while we were talking at a park, that she was a victim of rape at the age of 7, and after she told me, and I tried to comfort her, she ran away, then later told me, that she doesn't think I care about her anymore, which is untrue.So I told her I care about her more than anything in the world,and that by telling me what happened, it proves she trusts me,and I believe we got closer through that.Now, when she brings up the subject,I keep telling her, (which are all true!), You aren't worthless, I really care about you, and you are a great person, and I would never want to leave you.      Now, she comes up to me talking about it, which is fine, and cries, which is fine,yet she seems to think crying around me bugs me,and I always tell her it's fine,you can cry on me whenever you need to,but now she tells me she feels she is afraid to cry near me.How do I get her to understand she can cry on me when she needs/wants to?

20070601091810AAXJoR2	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I always have to put the concert tickets on my credit card?	My friends and I attend concerts on a regular basis, and we want to go to another one. However I'm tired of putting it on my credit card because they take so long to pay. It would be like $500-$600.      So I asked my friend to do it this time. She claims she canceled all of her cards and her mom won't let her put it on hers.      As much as I want to go to the concert, I'm willing to wait, collect the money and then buy them, although the seats will be further back.

I have a question. my ex and I have been talking for about 3 months now and sometimes he gets kinda busy and we won't talk for a day. Normally this doesn't happen but sometimes it will. He isn't a worryer like me so he doesn't understand why I would get freaked out over us not talking for a day. Yes we are broken up but we are also tryin to work on thigs. he lives 6 hours away and we have kwown each other for about 8 years. I know he isn't seeing anyone else it is just that when he gets cuahgt up in his work he gets distracted. He lives with his parents still so his day has him do a lot of the stuff that needs to be done. Anyways, my question is, I didn't talk to him last night and I haven't talked to him today yet, do you think that means he is dead? I mean am I overreacting? I lost a friend to death about 3 years ago and now anytime someone goes a lil while without talking to me, I freak out about this. Please help!!!

20070609123641AAJW3qa	Family & Relationships;Family	Is the blue type normal?	now that i've got your attention....heres the real question....      I'm trying to write a novel, here are the beginings of the first chapter...what do you think will happen?...what do you think of it in general? comments, concerns? thx      It wasn’t until age fourteen that I realized I never wanted to have children, not because I didn’t like kids or I thought I could never support them, but because I knew that I would always be too selfish to take the proper care of them. I don’t know if it was my fault, but I know I was always raised to take care of myself and never step foot out of safety if I didn’t have to. My mother was always a cautious woman; she was always trying to hold on to me so I could never be hurt. These days I feel like I can still remember the day when she held me as a newborn all wrapped up in blankets by the beach. Her arms so tight around me I couldn’t even feel the wind, just her warmth, her love. A picture was taken, and throughout all my life, it was always sitting in a frame on her dresser. Everyday in her room, she would walk past it and question why I was growing up so fast, why I didn’t fit in her arms anymore. And although I knew it wasn’t in my power to stay that young and small, every time I saw that expression on her face, I couldn’t help but feel shame. I felt bad because I wasn’t the way she wanted me to be.    I was the only child she ever bore, with my father who was forty years too old to have children if you ask me. The story was told to me that it was somewhat of a forced marriage. And with the customs of Iran, that wasn’t hard to believe when I heard the story. But then I was young, I was too innocent to be open minded; all I cared about was happiness. To this day I still feel like my mother and I share close to nothing in common, it might be a tragedy to steer away from the mother-daughter relationship cliché, but it’s the truth nonetheless. We were never friends, but we did love each other. But throughout all our differences, we agreed upon one thing: we knew what we wanted.   She never directly told me, but I always knew what she dreamt of. If it was her decision she would have been born as an only child from wealthy parents who loved her unconditionally. She would have gone to the best schools, received the best education and care. She would have grown up successfully with constant money in her pocket. As an adult, she wanted to buy a beautiful, large house by the beach and paint when inspired. And she wanted to have a child who went through the same glorious life as her. Well it’s seen that the fairy tale didn’t happen that way, but she tried. I would sometimes ask her why she didn’t do these things, and she always blamed it on her parents; always said that they had four too many children to raise her the right way, that it wasn’t in her power to be successful. Of course I would always nod my head in agreement as a lie, so she would know I understood but didn’t agree. And she knew I didn’t, but she didn’t want to believe it, so she always just kept the thought of me understanding and kept herself content with that.    I always thought that the majority of her dream could still have been achieved regardless of her family. But it never occurred to me until now why that didn’t happen. Part of the reason was my father. He was a con artist, he could make you believe anything if you didn’t stop him from talking, and he knew how to get what he wanted. And he wanted a wife. It wasn’t that my mother didn’t like him, but she didn’t love him. And that was the start.

20070906175305AAwYsE2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I cannot win?	I liked a guy friend.  He said he wasn't interested.  I said "Okay cool."       The next day his ex emailed (on myspace) me out of the blue - never talked to the girl before - and asked me what I thought about him sleeping with her and flirting with other girls.  We talked about it, and I said I think he is using her, and if she feels something, she needs to tell him.      She told him, editing my words.  He got mad, yelled at me - saying I was trying to push the compitition out of the way.       We got into a huge fight.  Took a break from each other and I thought things were good.      One of his friends has family in Hondoures, where the hurricane hit.  I emailed her and asked if things were okay.  Last night I said "I just wanted you to know that I emailed her about the hurricane." he said "why would I care?" I said "Just in case she says she talked to me and you think it's about you." he yelled at me telling me that I am so 'f'ing dramatic'      I'm trying to be open to help things, but I cannot win.

20070626014347AASG0Py	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im so confused!!!! Please help?	I went to watch the rugby with a friend on Sat as the guy im seeing was at work.When the game was over she asked me to phone a friend and make plans to meet as she likes his friend.I did it and they came along. There were these guys at the place hitting on me and they were freaking me out so i asked my friend to act like my bf (with boundaries though) so they would leave me alone. But after a while i realised that he must have feelings for me cause of how he was acting. I told him that i had a guy and couldnt do anything. when we left he phoned me for over an hour telling me how much he likes me and wants to be with me and asked if we could meet the following weekend to talk. I said ok. Then yesterday he was like i think ur amazing but i wouldnt wanna be more than friends. My friend who was there on sat says that he is crazy about me but is saying that he isnt now cause he is trying to cover that he is hurt. The prob is that its the 2nd time this has happened and i like him!Im confused

Desconfio que meu pai tenha um filho fora do casamento com uma mulher que mantém caso há muitos anos,uns 15,que deve ser a idade do filho dele.Meu pais s?o casados em regime de comunh?o de bens,somos 5 filhos do casamento.Meu pai parou de trabalhar com uns 55 anos gozando de boa saúde e sendo mantido por minha m?e e meus irm?os que foram morar no Jap?o um pouco antes disso,enviando dinheiro para manter a casa aqui, e ele administrava o montante,que n?o era pouco,pela quantia desconfio que tenha repassado muito à amante,além do uso para ele próprio e de dívidas que contraiu,que minha m?e pagou;tudo isso fazendo minha família gastar muito do que ganhava,durante muito tempo.   Gostaria de saber se em caso de divórcio ou falecimento do meu pai,teríamos como ganhar a causa na justi?a caso a amante pedisse reconhecimento do filho e direito a heran?a para o mesmo,se pudesse comprovar q meu pai já utilizou grande parte dos rendimentos da família em benefício deles.Obrigada.
20070614012346AAzJDlg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is there something funny going on or is he just friendly?	I work in a bank. I did a really easy transaction for a guy's business account (such as um, only making a deposit and giving him a balance); he owns a very prominent Italian restaurant in town and because I did this transaction for him, he offered to give me a free dinner in his restaurant. On my way to work, he even dumped into me, reminded me of his offer and then wanted my cell phone number. I ended up taking my girl friend to the restaurant (best pasta and bread I ever tasted, by the way), and of course, he wasn't there (I did not expect that). However, when I told some people about this situation, they ALL suspected that he was attracted to me, and I haven't even seen him stop by for a couple of weeks! I am giving him the benefit of the doubt... I think he was just being friendly? What do you think?

20080319145322AAanS8w	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Homens s?o solidários, mulheres s?o competitivas?	Olá!      Essa é uma frase com a qual concordo, salvo raras exce??es.      Homens se ajudam, sempre, desde empurrar um carro engui?ado, até quest?es sentimentais. Eles trocam informa??es, se protegem e até se acobertam, caso necessário.      No universo feminino, a coisa é bem diferente : mulheres competem o tempo todo...já vi mulher falando horrores de uma cara com quem havia ficado, só pra desencorajar a "amiga", pra q n?o  ficasse com ele, embora n?o houvesse mais nada.      Mulher fala mal de homem pra q as outras se afastem, e se n?o tem o q falar, até inventa...credo!      é claro q estou falando de uma maneira geral, mas , na sua opini?o, é assim q funciona? Se sim, pq será q isso acontece?      Obrigada, bjos pra todos !

She also has written a story about a guy who she was obsessed with and he died in real life, but she's writing about him as though she's obsessed. She's obsessed with this mean girl and she's obsessed with this dead guy and the other weird thing is she has been writing this for about six years. we are both fifteen. she'sbeen writing this since she was nine. She put herself in the stories as the girl who has a crush on the guy who dies and makes his mom's name in the story the same as hers. Its weird, do you agree does she need help?

We can hardly wait to see each other when we get off work and there is nothing better than falling alseep in his arms.  Everything was fine until last night...his mother came to visit and brought some pictures. There is one picture of him, looks like it was taken professionally, when he was younger and he is wearing a gold band on his ring finger. I was devastated because what could that mean other than he's been married before? For certain reasons, I would never have entered a relationship with him knowing that, but he gave the impression he hadn't been married, yet I never came right out and asked him, my fault. What should I do? I like him so much, is it silly to let the fact that he's been married and didn't tell me affect my growing feelings for him? I already feel differently about him. And how do I approach the topic with him delicately? Thanks for any help. I'm kinda upset.

20070619110503AAFVlVV	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this pathetic?	Okay, well last night I was talking to my friend, and we were talking about this one boy. She said that he may be "interrested" in me, but I know that he has liked her in the past. So I said to her that he would always choose her over me because she is perfect. She is tall, skinny, and outgoing and I am short, chuby, and really shy. So we got into this convo and i was putting myself down about how i will never be pretty enough. I ended up leaving the computer in tears, and I think I may have cried for like 20 minutes or until I fell asleep. Do you find the pathetic?
20070619173440AAM3Y34	Family & Relationships;Friends	I NEED FRIEND ADVICE....ASAP!!!  Read the story...please...?	I am 13 year old.  I have a friend that is really nice to me at school all the time, where I am part of the "in" group. We work together on all projects, we sit together at lunch, and we tell each other everything.  The only problem is that she goes to my church as well.  At church, I'm not exactly in the "in" group.  At church, she hangs out with totally different people, shows off her money and cellphone(s), wears different clothes, gives me dirty looks and insults me to my face.  This occurs on Sundays.  On Mondays, when we go back to school, she acts like nothing happened.  She wears her normal clothes again, she talks to me, hugs me (etc), and treats me nicely.  I know that that isn't what a real friend is like.  What should I do about it?  If I do anything at school, she'll pretend nothing happened and will take it out on me at church.  I need help - ASAP.
20070620075454AA30lA5	Family & Relationships;Friends	Help!!? I don't know what to do?	I am going to school as a Freshman in high school for the first time in five years (I was homeschooled) im not going to know anyone there. I am sort of shy but once I start talking to someone I get comfortable and can be myself. I am also more comfortable around guys than I am girls. If I can't find something or need help, can I go up to a guy and ask, or will that look like I just want him to talk to me? Or will it look weird in any way?    Also, if u have any tips on surviving high school for me, that would be so appreciated.
20070620080154AAuJSgx	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do...?	Recently, i tried a few ciggarettes, out of mainly curiousity, but I am not addicted in any way. My close friends know, and one of them blurted it out to some other girls in our year who are very popular and most of them smoke themselves. This happened when we were on a school camping trip, and it lead to worse things - like one of the girls she told, spreading it, assuming other things, and using it to blackmail me. How do I get them to stop, or talk to them about it?

20070623084353AAuLYUg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, what really torques your Javas?	Simply put: What qualities do you look for in YOUR man?      - A man who exudes self-confidence in everything he does.      - Strong masculine physique (Broad shoulders, rock hard chiseled abs, strong arms....Perhaps, a firm buttocks as well?)      - Baby smooth skin, like supple velvet...      - A deep soothing voice?      Do you also want a career oriented brotha'? Would you prefer a nice, clean cut, conservative gentlemen that you could bring home to mom and dad? Or a ruthless corporate badass that's an animal in the sack?      So ladies, what do you like?

We have 1 child together and we're under 25 yrs old! Are we too young for marriage and need to go our separate ways or should we work through it. He's always too close to his female co-workers. Doesn't matter WHERE he works it's always the same old story. He likes to help them out and "save" them. I think it's an ego problem and that I need to move on with my life and find someone more mature. He knows clearly how I feel and makes excuses all the time that he feels bad for them. It's been 2 yrs!Women from his past look him up and call him at home and see him at work. They're always asking for his help. I'm sick of it!

Nós acreditaremos nisso? Qual é o papel ent?o do cora??o no amor?   Se nos agarrarmos no lado sentimental, com certeza, o cora??o, muitas vezes, é o motivo de amar. Partindo para o inverso a mente pode enlouquecer por amor e até fazer a gente ficar louco. Do tipo de cometer coisas estúpidas como amar alguém errado. Ou afogar numa tristeza na hora da rejei??o. A mente atua no amor, dando consciência, de erros e acertos na hora de se envolver emocionalmente.    O cora??o quer se afogar na paix?o e nem se importa com as conseqüencias.

The japanese traditional court-kimono of the 14 - 16th centuries is really pretty to see and the white girls who are wearing the japanese kimono, are extremely sweet looking.

Reality: I ′d ever watched a wedding celebration, when a US white girl married her japanese ancestry boyfriend in San Diego Calif, she also weared this ancient traditional kimono on her wedding, she looks very awesome like a western japanese princess and everybody was happy.      The question is:   do the japanese men love the white girls obsessively?
20080323171826AAvkino	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Hm...a little help here!?	So...there's this guy in my philosophy class and I'm a bit confused as to what the hell's going on (if he likes me or not). Once, after class, somehow we ended up in the same area and we just told each other hi and asked each other where we were going (he also told me to have a good weekend). A few days later, we cross paths again and he gives me a big smile, says good morning and asks how I am, and holds up his hand for me to high five. I think, "Ok" and just go along with it. The hand holding thing happens again in class (and on his way over to his seat he just stares at me with that big smile). I ask him if he understands what we're doing in class and he says he only knows a little bit. I don't even say anything-except that I don't understand something-and he immediately sits down next to me-close-and attempts to help out. There's more but I've typed up enough haha. So, really, question is this: does he like me or not? :-/

Now, I for one am entitled to my own opinion, but forgiveness doesn't mean we stay together... forgiveness is choosing to let go of the hurt it caused...

20081111074813AApKGPn	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband's previous choices still affecting life?	Normally I'm happy and optimistic, but my husband's previous choices of spouse and to have more children than they could afford are really weighing on me today. We're really struggling financially, to the point where it's become frightening, as I know many people are. I recognize and honor his previous commitments, but last week each of our children had birthdays. I spent $15 on my daughter, while he spent $100 on his. We couldn't afford it. Also, I can't help but see that if his ex worked at above minimum wage, she would be better able to partially finance her children's lives instead of them being nearly fully financed by their dad. So, I guess it's previous choices and choices of last week that are really frustrating me. As I said, I usually cope fine, but I just have this feeling that we're going under, and everything that's creating the situation is suddenly becoming unbearable. Any advice? Clearly, I knew he had these obligations and I respect him for fulfilling them, I just didn't know that things were going to get so desperate.

My fiance and I were together for almost five years and engaged for just a few months before I left for a week-long vacation with my mother and aunt. While I was gone, my ex went wild, meeting up with an ex-girlfriend, lying about being at work when he was at the strip club, and being inappropriate with a woman who was formerly a mutual friend. I now believe him that he did not physically cheat on me (I think), but I've already moved out of our apartment and my fam/friends hate him. I still love him and he wants me back, promises never to do this again. My heart says yes, but my head says no. What should I do?      I moved back in with my parents, who are in the middle of a nasty divorce. My world is falling apart and I feel like I don't have anyone left.

20061213104430AA5q9jP	Family & Relationships;Friends	Whether you have or haven't forgiven someone, what do you think of this ? ? ?	To forgive is to reach out to your brother.   As one friend to another, no matter what the cost.   To forgive is to leave the past behind you.   Pray tomorrow finds you stronger for the journey.    Everyday we're learning to forgive.       sung by Al Denson       Any thoughts on this subject are more than welcome.   What do you think ? ? ?
20081006082050AAgvNoR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it my imagination that I have a connection with someone and he feels it too or?	I am in love with a man, we see each other in our social circle, at least twice a week. We almost never talk, but I feel faint with love whenever we are near each other and can't stop thinking about him when we're apart, a very powerful feeling. I keep thinking he feels it too, is it possible for him to feel how I'm feeling too like my feelings tell me, or is it my imagination? It's hard to explain, but is it possible to have such strong feelings and feel like he's feeling them too when in reality he wouldn't feel anything or is it a sign he feels soemthing back too? When I was traveling over the summer he sent an email asking where I had been, which was flattering like he actually noticed my absence. And when I saw him again, those same chemistry and love feelings flooded me all over again. I'm very shy and never answered his email and always try to leave when i sense he is about to approach me, which makes it harder to know if he might like me.

20061215194632AAKBH7X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do??	Would you assume that if you were looking in your son's room and he was sleeping with his g/f in his arms, that they had sex?? Would you trust them to be alone together?? Why or why not??    Would you assume that if they were ok with this than they already had sex?? My friend says yes.   I know they are close b/c they have been together for 3 years. I know all his friends have had sex, so are the chances higher then that they(him and his g/f) had sex    Is it ok for him to do this or should I think they already had sex?   If I ask will he actually tell me the truth??   They weren't exactly wearing the most clothes ever, but at least some. Should I be ok with this??   Did his friends probably encourage him to have sex, or his own desires??

20070130231040AA6ds26	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I need something... anything?	Yesterday I went to my boyfriends's house and he had a porno in his dvd player - which is ok, i don't mind that since we usually watch them together, however, he tells me that he has a very low sexual drive and that's why we rarely have sex (even after watching porn). But he obviously gets horny, right? if he likes to watch the movies alone? i'm just thinking that maybe i just don't do it for him - maybe i don't turn him on or he doesn't find me sexually attractive. But than why doesn't he just tell me if that's the case? - cause my feelings are constantly getting hurt over this issue and it's making me feel very inadecuate. He is (without words) telling me that he's rather watch a movie and masturbate than be with me. I have tried to approach this from every angle imaginable... and he doesn't really give me a straight answer.
20081229081727AA5ExqX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Jake & Leanne are back together: Will it work?	Leanne was Jake's first girlfriend but it was more of a high-school romance than anything. Then Jake dated Violet for three years. He truly loved her but things became rocky. After they split Jake flirted with many girls but eventually went back to Leanne as a kind of rebound thing, but it only lasted a month. When they split Jake dated Kacey. Kacey was sweet but she was a little insecure so he broke up with her after six weeks and got back together with Leanne... So will it work this time? Is Leanne the one he really loves or not? Will he ever give Kacey another go since she is the one who still has feelings for him? Or will Violet always be his true love?

We had a huge fight now he is staying with a friend, and I want to go and say sorry but the thing is I'm not, I am sorry about the fight but I still stand my ground about not sending them invites, they have already said they won't come and will throw the invitations away.

I started hating her 2 years ago when I was in sixth grade. She always thinks Im with boys, whih most of the time I was but we were NOT doing anything. I was raped in 4th grade and kicked out of my dads house in sixth grade. Obviously I had a bad life. She knows I like boys because I was raped and for some reason I love when boys kiss me and tell me I look good and that Im pretty. I love when they feel my thighs and all that. IVE NEVER HAD SEX THOUGH NOT EVEN CLOSE!! My mom pulled me out of Florida where I was living with my aunt and grandma and made me live with her for a year in Alaska because my step dad went to Itaq and she clamis she needed help. I get my sister sky, who is five years old, up every morning at 7AM and got her ready for school and walked her to school. My mom says I never do anything for her and that I never loved her. I did love her at one point but now I dont. Sky got sick Wenday and my mom needed me to watch her Thursday which ment I couldnt go to school. I had lots to do at school that day since we didnt have school Friday so I tol her that I didnt want to. So she told me to burn in hell and all this ****. She calls me a whore constinally. She always says "Keep your lips to yourself" infront of my friends so now thaey think that Im a whore. So now I have a bad reputation at school. She always thinks Im having sex with boys when Im not. I was gonna have a baby with an ex boyfriend (Erik) but she caught me. Remember I was raped I didnt know what I was doing but now I understand I have to wait to have a baby. She holds that aginst me and that happened like 4 months ago. Im tired of her making fun of my face.       http://i529.photobucket.com/albums/dd332...       There's a picture of me. My face ist that bad. Anyways how can I control my anger towrds my mother since our relationship isnt going t change? Oh yeah and by the way she told me if my attitude dosent change she is going to send me to a school for bad kids and Ima have to live there. HELP!!! SOS SOS SOS!!!

20081121121216AA1YhPQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Back child support how does it work?	My boyfriend's ex wife is saying that he owes $12,000 in back child support. The divorce was recently final at the beginning of October. She lives in Wyoming and we live in Texas. He wired her money through moneygram weekly, and when he was still living in Wyoming he wrote her checks. He's kept every receipt of the money that he has sent her. My question is, don't they have to start going through proceedings and start the child support process before they can even say he owes back child support? Also, can they go back to before they were even divorced and say he owe's money when money was being sent? Thanks for your help.

He and I have met on the elevator many times and we seem to hit it off. I bought him a thoughtful gift (hat, gloves, and a scarf) because he hasn't located his winter coat. I think it is cute and I have chosen what to put on the card that makes it funny, but I can't seem to get it in the door. The office is like Fork Knox. You have to ring a bell to get someone to come to the door (drawing a lot of attention to me). I don't really want to stand there while he opens it. My only problem is I have a friend in that office and he delivered a message from me (that I didn't send). He told him "if you ask her out she will say yes!" Which really screwed me over. What do I do? I want to go through with it but I can't figure out how. Any help would be appreciated male and female advice would be great! Thanks!

20060725083259AABDWtj	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is it love?	My boyfriend is great. He's sweet, caring, and everyone I know adores him. Whenever I think about him (Usually those few minutes every night when you can't get to sleep) I feel like I'm floating. I think back to  how it started, when I was crying and he was the only good friend who called me and talked to me for 4 hours straight. Since then it's been a rocket ride and sugar high. Whenever he calls me one of our nicknames, I smile in a way no    one else can make me smile. We laugh till we cry, but we discuss life and dreams too. He accepts my faults, and I accept him. When I see him or think about him, my stomach feels like I am on a fast elavator. And no matter how hard I hug him, I always miss him the second I pull away. We've been officially "going out" for one month. Do you think it's love? And does age matter? Isn't love a miracle? Why do you have to be a certain age to experience a miracle? I just always wondered that. Thanks in advance!

Before me and my husband started dating, i went out with this guy for about 2 years. He was my first. But he just split on me. I didnt know what happened to him, so i met my husband and we  started dating. The question is, i just recently found out that my ex is not in good shape. He was in a party and someone slipped something in his drink. He flipped out and had to be put a metal ward for a few weeks. He is not the same anymore. He has gotten a little back to normal but not the same. My question is, I have been trying to track him down, he is in a Christian mens home and comes to visit his family every sunday. Is it wrong that i want to see him even though im married. Is it wrong that i want to spend some time with him? I really am concerned about him and would love to see him! But is it wrong. I know if my husband ever found out he wouldnt be too happy so is it wrong?

Here's the thing: he's older than I am and he's a virgin.  He's been like saving it up for the right girl... and he like chose me.  He wanted to have sex last night and I was like "whoa".  Like that's a lot of pressure on me!  We are awesome together and everything - but this is kind of tough.  He really doesn't know what to do at all.  I told him to wait- I thought we'd take it slower and was totally not expecting this from him - knowing he was a virgin before.  I told him not tonight - we can start fooling around, and if he still wants to then to pick a day and I'll make it special.  Does any one have any advice for me?  How do I even go about showing someone what to do?  I really like this guy and don't mind the aggravation of it all.  I know a lot of people would jump ship at this point, but I don't want to do that..... I lost mine when I was 14!  That was a long time ago!  I've only slept with 2 ppl - so I'm not a freaking sex ed teacher!  He's like really nervous.  I think I'm going feed him a few glasses of wine so he can relax... then ... how to make it as little awkward as possible.... :) Thanks peeps

20081120131856AAkTRrX	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ex Wives, will you help answer my question?	This question is for women who have children with their remarried ex husbands.      Are you, or have you ever considered being cordial with your ex's new wife for the sake of the children?      I just read the book Step Wives and the situation seems near impossible.  I am the wife of a husband who was previously married.  I came into the picture five years after the divorce yet his ex is down right malicious towards me and I don't understand it.  I don't expect her to be my friend, but I would like to know what is going on in her head.  She's making it really hard on me when it comes to the growing relationship I'm working on with my stepdaughter.  I don't think this is fair to me.      I'm just wanting to know the ex wife's point of view.  Please take into consideration that I was never "the other woman."

20081006091223AANIDB8	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Was waiting to get married a bad idea?	My boyfriend & I decided to wait until my sister gets engaged before we tell our family we're getting married. We thought that would avoid us from going back to our home state for a wedding & having my older sister being the butt of many jokes since she's 8 years older than me. When my boyfriend & I came up with this plan she was dating a different guy for 5 years, between then she was dumped by him, lived at my parent's house for awhile then started dating the neighbor's son when he got out of jail. I told her now that now I can get married when she broke the news about her engagement, & she flipped out that I was doing it to rub it in her face. She doesn't even want to get married until her man gets off probation in 2010.  Should we just do it & get it over with or wait till after her to make her happy? We did plan on marriage before her current guy even got out of jail.

We have been friends since we were 9 and now we are 26. But I think she or I has changed      Keep in mind we are 26 and she isnt working or in school. She lives with her mom who just filed bankruptcy and cries eevryday about money.      All my friend cares about is guys and partying. She brags about how many shots she can do.      And as much as I hate it I think her hygiene is horrible. She always has bad breath and she borrowed my mouthwash when she had her own! When she drinks its disgusting to see how she acts.      I dont think she is trying to find work and she's not interested in school. She says she wants to help her mom but then she goes on dates.      And when a guy is digging me and not her it pisses her off.       I am so disaapointed in her. I dont know what to do about our friendship because we have known eachother so long. We are grown women and her mentaility is still 9th grade!      What should I do?

20081119101921AAvdLzI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this a good idea (i hope it is)?	The hours seem to drag by now.  With each second I see the change in my husband.  How sad he's gotten.  I think back and I realize that he didn't even fight the guy.  Have I broken him that much?  My husband has always been a fighter (physically and emotionally), always willing to stand up for himself.  As a woman, I never thought that I could do so much to him that I would take away his strength like this.  Today was his first time eating something I cooked in a while, but he didn't eat much (not even a whole plate).  There is a sadness to him that I've never seen before.  He just stares...When he looks at me it's almost unrecognizable, or maybe I don't recognize myself.  The looks aren't dirty or filled with anger, I would feel a little better if they were (That's horrible but it's the truth).  I can't describe it.  Anyway, he's leaving for a few hours to look at stuff to update the house and I'm in panic mode. Does this mean he's going to sell our home and leave me for good?  He's never really mentioned it before or am I going overboard.  He was looking at seperation/divorce information on our computer.  He didn't really do too much, but still, I have an ominous feeling.  I asked if we were going to really try to work on making our marriage better.  He answered by asking if I think he should.  I couldn't reply.  He cried for the first time in front of me.  He was staring at our picture.  I've NEVER seen this side of him.  When we were just friends and just starting to date, whenever we had a problem or issue (with each other or someone else), he'd come over or vice versa and we'd light candles and open the blinds to see the stars (or city lights back then).  I'd roll up a "j" for us and we'd just lay with each other, I'd cry or he'd vent.  We would play little guessing games and learn so much about ourselves.  We would lay on the floor and talk about the things we wanted for our lives.  we would just be together, nothing sexual.  It was almost spiritual for us.  Of course I don't want to put his job in jeopardy (you know the smoking and what not).  I think it would be a nice gesture.  Even if he did plan on leaving me, it would be out in the open.  Also, I'm thinking of quitting my job.  I'm not happy there and it causes too much hurt to walk through that building.  Before we got married my husband told me what he wanted to do with his life (You know, his hopes and dreams).  If I quit my job and start working on starting his dream would he be mad?  I've decided that's what I want, to be apart of something that he holds dear to him.  My last question had a post regarding having children.  I can't stop thinking about it.  After what I did, would I be a good mother?  How do I convince my husband this is a positive step.  How do I assure him that this WILL be his child and that I won't betray him again.  He's an only child and that means he's the last on his father's side.  His bloodline will end with him.  I don't want that for him or us.  I was so sure of life before I betrayed my husband, but now I'm so full of questions about who I am and what I represent to myself and my husband.  Do I have the strength to fight for us alone?  He tried and failed miserably no doubt because of my infidelity.  I'm going to try my plan tonite.  I'd still like an opinion.  I LOVE MY HUSBAND

20081027181029AAwPXGx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need help, I think I'm losing my mind?	My parents are 57 & 58 years old, they have been in US over 16 years now and have not bothered to learn the language. They bounced from one minimum wage job to another, but now are too old, fat and sick to continue. So it is up to me to figure out what to do with them. If I do nothing, they will be homeless, in which case they will probably try to move in with me. And I have a family, and am pregnant. I can't devote all my time to looking for a job for them, which makes it so much harder, with the job market being scarce, and them not speaking the language, and being obese and older. This is really stressing me out, I cannot pull their weight, I have my own things to worry about. What should I do. My husband is no help, he is barely making ends meet himself. I always help him out too. But I am really getting sick of this sh***, everyone using me and making me do everything for them. I tried not helping them, bu then they hate me and turn on me and say that I'm a bad person, because I'm not helping them. What do I do? I don't have any siblings or friends, these are the only people in my life.

20081003120817AA5HzU5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does she eventually want me back?	My girlfriend of 2 1/2 years and fiance for the last 1 1/2 years broke up with me about a month ago, and it destroyed me. So i've been trying to make contact, find out whats going on, get back with her, sometimes she'd answers the phone sometimes she doesent. I finally visited her twice this week, once on monday and just yesterday. The first meeting she looked interested in me still and when i left she looked like she wanted to keep me there. Then on thursday she expressed attraction to me. She said she fell out of love with me on and off for 6 months. She said she fell out of love with me because i was not showing her enough affection. I did notice her change in behavior threw out the course of the summer, her breaking off a shared ebay account, arguing over nothing, ect ect. I'd even ask who is hitting on you at work, no answer. It just so happen's that she is now dating someone from work, this is the apparant cause of her confusion and loss of affection from my part. Granted i do admit i could have shown her a little more affection, but its been 4 years. I said it was my fault and she says it was her fault. When she broke up with me she looked unsure and confused. Seems like this guy took advantage of the situation, a real asshole because even if she did say she didnt love me to the guy one night, did he have to try to get her? She's 22 and immature for her age, probably latching on to this guy for job security. This guy is 38, divorced with 2 kids, not immature and hangs deer heads on his wall. Every one said we were perfect in maturity levels as i am also immature for my age and we were only 9 years apart.    So she wants to be friends, and said talk to you later, and expressed that we could still hang out, but she doesent love me, but she does love me like a friend. Noting that loving me like a friend after four years is still love. Is she confused? Can that love be turned into real love after these unfortunate events? It seems, even still, when i see her that she in a mix between she wants me to try and im done with you. But if it was up to me, i told her that this guy would never love her as mutch as i could, it was more pure, our firsts, she may be riddled with guilt of her immature ways. What should i do, because i still love her lol.

This has been my brother's first girlfriend as he has always been a late bloomer. I have only met her once, and didn't think it would last. He never speaks about her and has not brought her around since the day I met her.My mom and I had the impression that he was a little embarrassed about her age and even said a few weeks ago he did not think the relationship was going anywhere. Over the weekend he tells me that she is pregnant. I am devastated because before he met her he was still living at home with my mom and was thinking of going back to school.I feel he has so much to offer the world and is now up for some challenging situations. This woman is a complete stranger to me and it is very hard to support the relationship. They have not married yet and they do not know for sure if they will. any advice on how to be more supportive?

20081006084847AA4xpqE	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Irritated 4 months after the wedding. . .?	My husband's mother bought us a bridal suite in the same hotel that our guests/bridal party were staying in the night after our wedding.  When my husband arrived to our room at 11:00 a.m. before the wedding, he saw it was a regular room and figured they were either sold out of suites or his mom forgot to get us the suite.  His brother also stayed in the hotel and checked in at 11:00 a.m. also.  I just found out this weekend from a bridesmaid that his brother had a HUGE suite with a jacuzzi, double shower heads, a kitchenette, a living room and a giant plush king sized bed.  He didn't mention this at all to my husband about his room.  Can someone be that ignorant to think the room was his? Do I have the right to be a little peeved? I would like to say something (even casually/jokingly) because it really bugs me!

Marriage is a friend who will be there forever.    It is having a shoulder to cry on or having a friend to laugh with.    There are good time and bad but in the end, your friend is always there.    Being married for 30 years is a huge achievement in itself.   You have raised 3 children, 8 grandchildren and you have one beautiful house we are all grateful enough to call home.   To my parents who have had struggles and successes, Congrats on 30 years together and showing everyone what true love really means.       Thanks for everything and I love you both!

20081103120700AANHFw8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do all women do this in marriage?	During marriage, women are capable or manipulating their men into being what they don't want to be - a parent. They get away with making false accusations and domestic violence.      I already mentioned in my last question that after the divorce, women get everything - the man's money, some of his assets, etc. Women have gotten away with a lot of things.      Why are women laid back easily after the divorce and why do they get away with bad things during marriage?         PS: And no, I'm not gay! I've heard it all before.

My husband is only interested in being intimate about once a week or so. Don't get me wrong he won't say no if I insist but I shouldn't have to. I have talked to him about it and he says that he is just exhausted and it is not because he doesn't want to. He is older then me (I am 27 he is 32) so I don't know if he has just already met his peak and I am just getting there but it is frustrating. Any ideas on how to get him more interested?

We've been married for 4 years now and everything was perfect until he confessed that he had sex with our neighbor (we all went to the same high school) before dating me. This really shocked me. I don't mind his losing virginity to her but I just don't understand why he's waited so long to tell me.  I just feel as if I'm not special to him anymore. Do you think my hubby might still like her in some fashion? She's not married and I've always felt some sort of connection between my hubby and her. But on the other hand I'm 100% sure that my husband would never ever cheat on me. I know I'm contradicting myself but I feel as if my husband has lied to me all those years.

Yes I pay rent but thats my problem not my child I need a roof to stay under to my bills like car, gas and light is my problem some mothers through that into court, You would have that problem even if the child wasn't here or you want to stay living with your parents forever. And of course my child would eat when I eat Im his mother I have to put $ out something to not just having the father put out money all the time if thats the case why not give the father custody looks like his paying more a month. I was at family court today a mother just lose custody because the father's lawyers had it look like the mother was in NEED so most NEED she wanst spending non of her own money.

I said good and would see him in a bit.      3 hours later he came home from the bar smashed and had spent the winnings.       I feel like he's always telling me he'll do something and does the opposite. But, it's not big stuff. He even will call and check in.last week he went out with the guys and said he'd be home at 930, called at 10, at 1130 he stopped in and said he'd be back in 10 minutes, then came home at 2... and I enjoy the time to myself at home, but feel like he's lying when these things happen.      is this normal behavior for young husbands he's 26 im 25? He said he's sorry this morning, and I  can't stay mad at him, but i dont want it to keep happening. i feel like his word doesn't mean anything, even though it's only about stupid stuff.

20081104135718AAY1L62	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What kind of lesson am I teaching daughter if do nothing.?	Please refer to this  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...        Many have said I should forgive wife and let her move back in. Also the comments about being without sin or the fact that she has "supposedly" been trying to make up for affair the last 16 years. Are those reasons to not make someone pay for there actions? Really am I suppose to go oh its ok to have a affair if the other person doesnt find out and to have someone raise a kids as his own that is really not his. My point is by accepting that she had the affair, lied to me, decieved me about child being mine, risked possible diseases to me the list goes on am I to just say oh ok thats fine since you have a terminal illness. Maybe I am wrong that should let daughter see that you can do anything just dont tell or get caught.

20081105130235AA93ytL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband pick porn over me?	We have been married for one year . He told me he likes porn since we're dating . I said thats fine with me, men and women are made differently.  He also single for quite a while so I totally understand, Now that we're married things are not the same , it brakes my heart every time I look at his computer's history and see different pose of naked girls which by the way coming from different race with me.       He has low sex drive we'd have sex one or two in a week mostly initiated by me.I asked him nicely what is it that he found him so interesting about looking at naked woman's picture that he cant find in me. He doesnt know how to answer it. He said I love you and I found you attractive , I like looking at other woman too but that doesn't mean Im going to go and cheat. He said if I can't handle this we better get a divorce now. I believe in communication, I tried to compromise with him. I asked if he has other solution to resolve this problem beside getting a divorce, his answer is " no other suggestion"      I have been thinking about this. It is not the divorce I'm scared about  anymore but if whether or not we choose the easy road. I am so confused I dont know what to do . Please shed some lights !
20081105131545AAoUBO5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What is going on with him?	So i'd been dating a guy for about 2 months and I found out i was pregnant with his child. Yeah, crazy...we talked about it and decided to terminate it. It would have just been horrible for everyone all around if we'd had a baby together and we just didnt know each other in that way. He told me that he wanted to be with me and hopes things work out, he talked abuot future plans, things were fine except for the obvious. Well we had a silly fight friday night (i terminated the preg last week) and now things seem weird. He cancelled plans with me sat night saying he needed time alone. Monday night he came over and said things were fine with us and that he just needed time to contemplate. I said, on what? he said, well whether i wanted to be in a relationship. I was like, oh great thanks. He basically took what he said back saying he didnt mean it. He said he had no thoughts of ending things with me. I'm supposed to see him tonight, but he's been more distant than usual. I'm CONFUSED.

20081110131038AAunH0Q	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should we wait to get married?	We have a very healthy, steady, and happy relationship with it's ups and downs. He thinks we should wait until we're both done with college, but since I'm am double majoring and doing a minor it could be a very long time for me. He also thinks that we should wait until at least most of our students loans are paid off and we have enough money saved up for a down payment on a house. In an ideal world, I would agree, but I don't think all of that could possibly happen within the next ten years in reality. I think that with combined incomes we could easily save money while renting a one bedroom apartment. Rent would cost less for both of us and we'd also save on food. We both agree not to live with each other before marriage, but I don't want to wait forever for the perfect situation. I don't mind waiting another year or two, but anymore than that and I think we'll both be too comfortable with our separate-but-together lives to take that leap.      Do you think I'm wrong and I should be more willing to wait for an optimum time?

20081111083909AAsZnhe	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	To take revenge or not to take???? An Affair, lies and a fake!?	So the story goes like this: I dated this Muslim guy for a few months from march this year and he left after to go on a business trip. That trip was supposed to be for 3 months but it turned into 6 months and he told me during that time that he was going for an arranged marriage. Of course I was hurt when I heard the news and my feelings were still there for him, like in all that time that he was absent. It took time to let go and still be his friend chatting on the phone weekly (while he was out there - avoiding the arranged marriage talk etc). Everything still felt  good with him, and i still saw him like a soul mate. But I came to know in October last month that he lied to me about stuff. I did something behind his back to find out these lies and I had to do it. He told me never to speak to any of his friends or family early in our relationship (and he never even introduced me to any family, just kept me distant and on the quiet. I believed he did that cos he’s family was strict but anyway I did something. I became a 'fake' or 'stranger' who became friends with this 'J' - his brother, on an online social site i.e. myspace.  I made up a whole identity on this social site just to talk with J (and I knew this was his brother because my ex had already pointed him out to me as well as other siblings etc long ago) but yea I talked with J to find out stuff that I was longing to know. I found out that this ex of mine didn’t go on any business trip; instead he moved out of london with his wife and 2 kids of 1 and 4 yrs old. I found out also that he lied about his age also. this ex of mine said he was 27 (which is a bit older then me) but as ive come to know... he’s actually 35yr old. Anyway in all that time calling me on private no. he made out like he was out there in india doing business and preparing for his enagement etc. just wanted to further away from me as you can see.   and in was in shock was when i learnt all this. everything made sense, the things i'd seen, knew - just came together with all that info.      Anyway, about 3-4 weeks ago I actually spoke to his brother J on the phone, for the first time with my new identity (and with my real voice) and with an old number of mine. He was asking for me to meet and to continue our chats even on families, seeing as that was my favourite topic! =)  (well it had to be in that case; with me asking all the questions I did about his family). I was like I don’t know when we;ll meet, we’ll see.       So after learning the truth about my ex, I wrote an email to him – my ex (as me of course) I wrote a calm and straight to the point email, making it serious too and sent it to all 5 email accounts that he has. I said of how I know everything about his life, of how i know all this through my friend being friends with brother J (through the identity i made up). basically i nailed all the points and pieces of info I knew about him, from his wife to kids etc. shocker email.      I even stated to him how he just used me that whole time and how he might not be happy with his wife and sex life, so had girls like me in his life (including his previous ex's) for fun and sex.       Anyway, I haven’t heard anything from him/my ex, after sending that email. There’s been no more phone calls like before (maybe he feels scared to talk with me) I'd like have an apology or at least would like TO DO something more that will shock ;d and scare.      and by the way I have time and energy to waste here and i do want to continue to do damage till I get that apology (even though I’ve pretty much said bye in the email!) i want him to come forward and confess everything.       I could leave all this but I have an opportunity to continue here using his bro      What more can i do? What else? this ex needs something more, i want the **** to be deeper then it is.   
20081111101935AAa2ikK	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Does "true love" come back to you if you lose it?	My exboyfriend and I broke up because of distance. I love him but we are both still young and trying to figure out who we are so it's been difficult to maintain a relationship.

20081114012621AAGBb7x	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Sex and Japan? Is it bad? Discussion?	I hear from many japanese ppl that it is normal for high schoolers to have sex before they turn 17. I've heard of cases where it was considered unusual but also sorta normal that girls have sex when they are 14, 15. Even in middle school. I've even heard of teacher-student relationships, and students doing it for the grade.      I have a japanese gf, actually, I've had 5 already. All of them are pretty much the most sex crazed girls I've ever been with. They seem super conservative on they outside, and the crazy thing is, they lie about their sex lives until u become very close to them. When private, they are open to all kinds of sexual things that is very uncommon in the states, and we do it at least 2-3 times every week. Most of them told me they had sex before 16 and that 17 is the most common time to have sex. Some of them had sex with older men in "love-hotels" as old as 39 when they were only 17 or 18. And many of them already had multiple partners before me.      I am wondering if its possible the sex surveys are wrong. Since, in the Japanese culture, it is considered "honest" to "lie" about shameful things, could they have lied about the average age of sex?      I mean, look at all the porn mags, sex toys, hentai manga that are available even to japanese children (if the children look for it). Look at how sick they treated Korean, and Taiwanese as sex slaves and the Chinese during the rape of Nanking? And look at the child sex tourism in Thailand, the majority of the customers are japanese.      I do not believe they are the most sex starved country, rather, they are the most sex crazed country except they lie about truth due to cultural upbringing.      Living and being with so many japanese ppl, including my gf and previous gfs; as well as, having 3 years of living experience in Japan, I can honestly say and not lie like the japanese that they are the most sex crazed country in the world--so sex crazed that even as an atheist, I think there's got to be some morals in Japan.      Please give me comments. What do u think?
20081114145104AA7EuN3	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I know this is the wrong section, but I thought I could get some answers here.....?	Please read all the way before judging or calling me names. You might understand more.....      When I was 17, my mom had a massive stroke at 45 years old. She had absolutely no use of the left side of her body for about 2 years (therapy is helping a lot) she has speech problems and her cognitive thinking is shot. I found her. I don't think I can ever get that image out of my head. I thought she was dead.      I was an honor student in High School. I was a senior when her stroke happened, about 2 weeks after school started. My mom was the money maker in the family but obviously could no longer work. Off she went to a city about 2 1/2 hours away so she could be in constant therapy (physical, occupational and speech) My grandma, grandpa and dad all went with her and lived in my grandma's RV for over a year so they can constantly be close by. I was left home with my little sister (then 14 years old) I was responsible for her, the house, making sure the bills were paid (I didn't have to earn the money at first, just write the checks and send them in) I became my sister's parent. I was always home in case something happened to my mom. I was scared.      After awhile, my dad kept forgetting to send money in. Once the power got turned off, I went and got a job to make sure my sister and I were fed. My job refused to work around my school schedule so I used to cut school to go to work. By that time I was 18 years old. I was eventually not going at all, there was so much to do: making sure my sister was getting good grades, making sure we had food and that the bills were paid, taking care of the house and all of the animals, and so much more.       I am now 22 years old. I feel like a loser. I am embarrased and depressed by the whole situation. I don't even know where to start. I used to have dreams of going to college, but now, I will just settle for a GED.      Thank You for your time.

My girlfriend has invited me over to her house a few times.  The last time was for dinner, which is when I began to wonder if I could put up with her family.  She lives with her parents, presumably to take care of her mom, who has a mental illness.  It felt bizarre to be at the dinner table.  The house is a mess, and her father is a bit strange as well.  The lady herself is very caring and is into me, but I'm just not sure about dealing with this on a long-term basis.  She says she wants to move away from home someday, but I'm not so sure I see her relinquishing her daily caretaker role, even after she gets married.  And I'm not sure I can deal with it.  Any thoughts?

I and my boyfriend live in washington state which legally recognized our domestic partnership. We plan to buy some properties out of states and to hold on to them for a long time (washington state grants community property rights to domestic partners, as well as other rights similar to married couples, except those rights in the federal arena). But we also may move out of washington state if good opportunity presents itself to us in the future.

20081128103655AAlyf8U	Family & Relationships;Family	Eu é que sou ruim, ou a minha mulher é muito abusada? O que você acha ?	Eu me estresso com tanto abuso, por parte da minha mulher, mas queria uma opini?o de vocês:      Desta vez, ela quer que eu todo mês fa?a um pequeno rancho, do meu dinheiro, para dar para minha sogra, que mora com o meu cunhado e o filho dele, meu sobrinho.      Acontece, que minha sogra têm quatro filhos, todos na faixa de 30 anos, com total capacidade para trabalhar e ajudar ela. Destes, 2 trabalham, 1 é vagabundo e a outra é minha mulher, que trabalha para mim, e ganha seu salário mensalmente.      Agora ela ficou irritada e estressada comigo, porque eu critiquei a insistência dela, para eu ajudar com um rancho que vai beneficiar n?o só a m?e dela, mas o neto dela de 8 anos, que a m?e dele n?o quer criar, e o cunhado vagabundo, que n?o para em nenhum emprego.      Eu tenho condi??es de ajudar tranquilamente, mas n?o acho certo, pagar o salário da minha mulher, pagar todas as despesas de casa, e ainda ter que comprar um rancho para minha sogra e seu filho vagabundo de 32 anos que mora lá.      Dá uma raiva, de tanta insistência dela, nesta injusti?a.      O que vocês acham ?

20081208214534AAG0vea	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I get jealous about girls I like in these situations?	so basicly I realized that I get really jealous easily around girls that I like when other guy friends come around. I dont know why. I just get kinda protective. I know I should be chill and I try to be. basicly I told this girl I like today that I think shes cool and I want to get to know her more and ever since then she kinda slowed down talking to me and she seemed to be more interested in talking to my best friend. ahh how do I combat this jealousy. I want to be chill and happy it's just like I get this feeling like I like her she doesnt feel the same and she's more into talking to my friend and it just makes me mad and I just pretty much got up and walked away. I feel like Im maxing out my enjoyment being single. I dont think I could enjoy my life anymore being single. its this jealousy thats hurting me. I get so mad inside that I get up walk away and go do what I love 3 times as fast and accurate. sounds like Im better off single and not looking for love in women.

20081208222501AA9MmEf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How am I supposed to know weather or...?	not his boy likes me? I've liked him for about 4 months now, and I *think* he likes me too. I'm not totally sure. I have two classes with him, we have assigned seats, so I don't sit near him in one of them. Were allowed to sit anywhere in the other. I don't know him personally. One of my friends talks to him sometimes. He's really shy/quiet, except for around his friends.  I'm the exact same way. I've noticed that he constantly looks at me. The other day in class he was talking to his friend, but I noticed he was looking at me the whole time. Then he turn back around to his desk. Last week we were lined up in class for a project and I turned around to talk to my friend who  was assigned to stand near him. I saw him look up when I turned around to face my friend and he kept looking at me. I then looked at him and we just stared at each other for a few moments before looking down again. Other than that, when we walk in the classroom, or I get up and walk to the teachers desk, in the hallway, in the lunch room, after school, whenever I see him, he looks at me. One of my friends has noticed it.  The other day we had to stay after school for a class and it was pretty dark outside. I was standing out front of the school with another friend waiting for my parent to come pick me up. Him and his friends were out front also, skating. I wanted to watch him, but it was windy and I was facing the other direction to keep the hair out of my face. When we pass in the halls we just kind of look the other way and sort of smile. Help? I don't know what to say to him either. I don't want him to think I'm weird.

20061011171619AA2RiSo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help!!! Does she like me?	I started to like this best friend of mine a couple of months ago (we were best friends before I started to like her). Right now I can't find any hints that she also likes me that way. I've given her some hints before but I'm not sure if she gets them or not. The thing is, we still talk a lot, does it mean that if she figures out that I like her but she doesn't like me that way, she would talk less and spend less time with me? I'm sort of planning to tell her how I really feel for her, but not sure if I should do it NOW or wait for another couple of months and see how things turn out because both of us like to take things slowly. So far she hasn't shown any clue yet. I'm just really confused. Does it mean she doesn't like me that way at all or is she just too shy and trying to hide her feelings? Any help is greatly appreciated!

I am in grad school; fellow grad students do not like me very much, though I have tried my best to be friends with them. For nearly a whole year, I built a sort of "relationship" (like a mother-son) with an elderly woman who holds a mid level post in the university; she is the only person who could possibly care about me; of late however, I think her behaviour has changed a little; she seems to incredibly busy whenever i visit her; she has been so nice to me that I am finding it hard to believe she would want me to just get lost; but is she? In that case, of course, I dont want to go to her again, for obvious reasons, but then i will be all by myself, with not a single soul in the world to talk to.... what should i do? Is there a way to find out if she is just a little busy or wants to avoid me?in case it the latter, how do i carry on with my life?

I have a crush on the owner of a company i'm working for and it's so obvious that he likes me too. However, he has not asked me out yet cause he might not be too sure about my feelings, age differences & also the work environment. I know that he doesn't want to lose me at all even if I date him.   The problem is I usually don't have that much to talk about and get his attention when we all(staff) go out for dinner. I also can't look into his eyes that much since i'm very shy when I like a guy(sounds like he doesn't exist there)I know that's awful. I kinda want to act professionally and in our culture it's not appropriate for a girl to ask a guy out so I want him to take the step.

20061210170930AAhZPMh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	All this time and I still like this guy.How do I move on?	After Hurricane Katrina, this guy was placed in a class with me.It was like he was the perfect guy and we enjoyed each others company and it almost grew into a possible relationship.Unfortunantly, sometimes he would get these phone calls from his ex and then they would talk on the phone and he would tell her he loved her in my face and then when they hung up he would try to act affectionate towards me and I told him that if he wanted to persue a relationship with me, he would have to get rid of his ex.He never did,but we would still hang out and then one day I found out through the phone that he was leaving to go back to New Orleans with his ex,who was now his girlfriend again and she got my number from him and asked me if anything was going on and I told her no because he asked me to not tell her anything and would still meet up with me.I sent him an email saying that I didnt like how he was playing me and we havent talked since.I told the gf what happend,but she is still seeing him.

20061217193802AA3bdJP	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship. We had peoplems before but we worked them out.?	We see eachother about once a month which is very fortunate, but now he has these two girls he hangs out with often. He has been to three concerts with them, and the three of them plus his guy friend hang out on weekends. He admitted to liking one a while ago but said he didn't want to ruin their friendship, plus he loves me. We've been dating 18 months, but i feel like the fool because i really dont hang out with guys much but he does. I trust him but there were a few rumors before i moved about him cheating. he told me none were true and i have no reason to think otherwise. I just think if he hangs out with them so much, something might happen, i don't know either of these girls but they haven't had boyfriends before. I just hope this dosen't turn out bad. any suggestions? thanks =]

20070203214905AA84LMj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm just so baffled anymore!?	We've been married a little over two years.   Both been married before, and devorced.   For the past 7 or 8 months now, he's gotten so   selfish about the money that gets spent.   He has been spending a lot on things he's wanted, and this week he spent $4800 on getting our pond dug deeper and wider.   I had no idea how much this was going to cost,   he said it wouldn't be much and that was that.   My complaint about this is, we have 'very' hot   summers with hardly any rain here in Texas, and   ast year we lost all our fish in the pond and it dried up at being only 10ft deep. Now it's 25ft   deep and twice as big around. It just doesn't   make any sense to me at all!! It would have to rain for weeks to fill that pond up now..and we never get that kind of rain..   I'm angry that he spent so much for something   so senseless, and can't even spend enough to put new carpet in the house.. He is pulling more and more of these kind of stunts lately,I have 'no' say.    Am I being unfair here, please advise!

I explained that the one time I tried the guy stood me up and he was shocked that someone *would* stand me up (isn't that sweet of him to say?).       So... I really don't know if I should, how you say, "go out" with him and what to do if I do. I personally do not find him attractive in any romantic way - only as a friend. I spent my teenage years pretty, um, asexual and I like it like that (but he doesn't know that).

Si alguno de ustedes ha tenido abstnencia después de tener una vida sexual activa, le ruego que me de sus consejos, realmente a mi me encanta el sexo, pero el orgullo me puede más que eso y por esa razón decidí "castigar" a mi novio, ?como le hago?  :-(      Graciasss°!!! :-)

20070531083640AAhf4He	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies some help plz...?	Hey Listen, I'm off a 3 relationship with this chick that I was fixed up with, we broke up about 3 months ago. Here's the deal, I have never actually approached a girl myself, like I said I was fixed up with that other chick. Now, I have no problem talking to people, I work in sales and I talk to customers and others with no problem I'm actually very social, the deal is that I just have the HARDEST time approaching a girl romantically. I will catch one's eye somewhere and she'll smile and i'm just thinking "go go go" but I just never do it. I have this anxiety that women find me overpulsingly ugly. So, i really have two questions here, can you ladies quickly check out my pics at my myspace here  http://www.myspace.com/tidus0515   and tell me wether or not if I approached you would you give me the time of day. And also, how the heck do I tell if you guys are single or not, i'm just so scared to get that hole I gotta boyfriend response, cuz then it'd be all wierd. Also, where appropriate

20070210174202AAW0Ddt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So, Does He Want to Sleep With Me?	Ok. Asked question before.  There's a psych prof at my school who seems to show interest.  I ran into him at coffee shop one day, and he remember my face after I took one class from him 7 years ago.  I'm back at school so when I see him, he wants to talk or otherwise makes sure to say hi as I pass him buy.  If I'm sitting at cafeteria and he walks by, he stares at me until I look up. He only seems to want to talk to me.  I was with friend who had his class last semester and he totally ignores her and only talks to me.  She says he has a crush on me.   One night I ran into him and he standing close, making heavy-duty eye contact it actually made me nervous.  Also, I hear he's married but wears no wedding ring.  He never mentions wife when he talks about weekend/travel plans.   I want to get his advice about internships in pysch and he's invited me to his office to talk to give advice.  He has great connections. I don't know if this is wise move...but maybe I'm reading too much into it

But it got really boring with him on our 6th and 7th time together. It's just small talk. And we are both tired after work so tired that we don't have that energy to converse and laugh that much over dinner as we did on the last few times. It got so boring with him that I;m afriad of the next time we meet -we seem to have lost some of that chemistry.       Is it supposed to feel exciting everytime you meet up?

20070413004151AAGDCfv	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	A mutual decision, so should we split, or remain friends?????	Hi, my girfriend (of 6 years) and I split up on Monday this week, and we have spoken and decided we would both like to remain friends.  The relationship has lost it's spark but we still get on really well - our personalities are completely compatible.      When we decided to split we couldn't stop hugging and loving one another and I felt something that I haven't felt in 2 years.  I think she felt it too because the following day she sent me a txt msg saying that "I didn't sleep, I've been crying, and I still love u u know".  She claims it's the family kind of love though.      I think I want to stay friends because I think there is a chance we could get back together.  Is this the wrong reason for wanting to stay friends?  Not sure I could handle the friendship if she met someone else and I'm sure she would be as equally jealous if I met somebody.      I am cut up about it because, well, it's been 6 years.  Male and Female perspectives would be much appreciated.      Thanks      Mark

It's not the fact that the abuser got away with what he did that hurts me but that my parents were so lighthearted about the whole thing. I have children of my own now and know that if ever they were abused I would do everything in my power to protect them. .

20070511193112AAnSQPg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl help please. Does she like me?	Hi. I have known this girl for about 2 yeards now. But these past couple of days, we have talked a lot. She has a b/f and has been going out with him for a year.                But it seems like her and I are flirting a lot. When im next to her, she would fix her clothes (or so it seems), she would ask me questions if I like certain things, she put her hand on my back saying "We all do stupid things" and then say just kidding, love you. She also likes to make fun of me a little.                  I was wondering, even though he has a b/f, does she seem to have some interest in me? If she does, what should I do?      Thanks!

He would stare at me for like a couple of sec and say how beautiful he thught I was. I got the impression that he was attracted to me.       Then when I get home. I write to him and HE NEVER writes back, when he does it takes him YEARS to write back if EVER. His emails are always one lined and to the point. We had a bad experience in the past with some miscommunication problems that he was REAL angry about and I'm wondering is he playing some sort of payback game with me, because its quite obvious that he doesn't respect me! WHAT SHOULD I DO?????

20070806094637AAC1mSi	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to get rid of my freeloading roommate? [Complicated]?	I'm currently living in a nice home that I own. While I'm running real low on money. I'm putting up a friend of 10 years that periodically helps around the house, but he's notoriously lazy and I'm not content with his work. When I've confronted him about this, he gets all defensive and that really makes me upset. He has an answer to everything!       I just got off the phone with my brother and he may need a place to live too. Granted there is space here for both of them, the truth be told is I'd rather NOT have anyone else here. I can barely afford to keep myself afloat at the moment. Obviously, I'd choose my brother over this friend of 10 years.       Chances are my brother can work out his situation for a while. Question is, how can I tactfully get rid of my freeloading roommate without destroying our friendship? Thanks      PS - the problem with my current roomie is he has no job, no savings, just sold his car, doesn't like the city I'm in and is basically stuck. I feel real bad.

So for example: dinner/lunch/breakfast , i would either be with my Girlfriend Or my Buddies individually without third parties.i won't even think of asking my buddies out, when im with my gf. Am I over-sensitive and selfish? i just hope someone out there would probably help me out with this. Shes my second girlfriend, so im not really good at managing my relationship. I Am not over-sensitive/selfish person before involving a relationship, maybe yes but not as much as who i am now.* every answer is greatly appreciate* Sorry for my bad grammer.

20080321164744AAF9KZ9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He never has time for me...?	Okay, my boyfriend and I are 16. We've been together for three months, as well as being together for about a year once before. He's busy allll the time. I only get to see him during English class, and sometimes at lunch when we have the same lunch. The thing is, he stays after school every day to work for speech, since he qualified for the national tournament in June. I'm proud of him and understand that he's busy, but that doesn't make it easier. We had a talk before and he said he'd try to call me more, but at that point we had no classes together, then the new semester started and now we have one, so he never calls me anymore. I guess he figures seeing me during one class a day is enough. And on the weekends he always has some excuse, like he has to paint or do yard work or babysit his brother. I do understand this, but it's so hard when I'm at home alone and he's busy. I'm always upset and never happy. But I wasn't happy before, when we were broken up, either. What should I do?

20080325100008AASVSVn	Family & Relationships;Family	?Qué hago si mi hermana menor se cree boxeador?	Ella disfruta verme sufrir, me ha golpeado, me insulta , me dice "india" por mi color de piel, no me baja de mensa, siempre me está insultando. Hasta en la iglesia me gritó de groserías y me ha dicho que disfruta verme llorar.Yo he hablado con ella, mis papás han hablado con ella, la he tratado de llevar al yoga y pues hasta he entrado en sus juegos de "ojo por ojo". Su grado de violencia es muy grande. Esto me ha causado sentirme mujer golpeada e insultada no por mi pareja sino por mi hermana. Qué puedo hacer?
