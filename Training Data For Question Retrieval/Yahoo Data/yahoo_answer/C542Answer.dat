TCpTlCTRaa	Hello: Many people report a burning or painful sensation on their scalp prior to hair loss (which later occurs in the same area) It is sometimes referred to as burning scalp syndrome. This syndrome is not well understood. It can be related to thyroid or inflammatory condition.|`|ZOKEWd5Daa	read more here about general rules to prevent hair loss <a href="http://teensandhealth.blogspot.com/2009/02/prevention-of-hair-loss.html" rel="nofollow">http://teensandhealth.blogspot.com/2009/...</a>|`|xNUxLnvJaa	My dad had been suffering from hair loss and only recently he started to see a huge difference with his hair (lots of fine hair growing out especially at the temple area) after trying out the various natural techniques taught to grow hair for 1 week at this website <a href="http://www.regrowmyhair.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.regrowmyhair.info</a> <br>  <br>  I must say its a very informative, effective and easy to follow step-by-step guide.

Wish you the best|`|Amhhx5blaa	?<br>  ?<br>  Whether anyone wants to admit it or  not, hair loss is something that we have all thought about and that  many actually dread or fear happening.? In today’s society, there  is so much stock put in how we look.? The fear of losing your hair,  especially for someone that is subject to hereditary hair loss, is enough  to send certain individuals into a frenzy.? However, before that  panic attack settles in, take the time to learn a little about hereditary  hair loss and you may find that you are not completely without hope.?<br>   <br>   If you are trying to figure out if  you are susceptible to hereditary hair loss, it is a pretty simple thing  to do.? All you need do is take a quick glance around at the family  dinner table and see how many shiny heads are sitting there.? You  may be young and have a full head of hair now, but if that light over  the table is blinding you off of all of those bald heads, you better  be proactive because your fate is pretty much sealed.?<br>   <br>   As you get older, your hair loss will  naturally occur due to DHT interaction with your hair follicles.?  For some people, this is not a problem, but for those with a hereditary  hair loss problem, your hair will fall victim to the DHT and hair loss  is the result.?<br>   The severity of the hair loss should  be in line with others in your family.? Some only see a small recess  in the hair line, others get a bald spot on the back of their heads  and there are those of course that go completely bald.? As bad  as all of this seems, there are actually treatments that can help cut  off hereditary hair loss in its tracks.?<br>   Two of the more popular medications  that are available are Rogaine and Propecia.? One is a topical  treatment and the other is by a pill, but both have been proven to be  effective in maintaining your current hair and will sometimes stimulate  hair growth in an area that has been balding.? ?<br>   <br>   You could also go the route of a surgical  procedure like scalp reduction or hair replacement surgery.? Hair  replacement surgery has actually made great strides in recent years  and after the surgery and when the hair starts to grow back in, you  will hard pressed to tell that the individual had surgery to get their  hair back.? So rest well tonight those of you that suffer from  hereditary hair loss, it may be in your blood, but you have a better  chance of halting it than ever before.<br>   Be sure and check out non-surgical treatment options with Provillus.<br>   ?<br>   ?|`|WCu2skI5aa	The Truth About Hair Loss<br>  <br>  It is normal to shed hair every day and the truth is we loose between 100-125 hairs on any given day. Hair that is shed falls out at the end of growth cycle. At any given time 10% of our hair is in what is called a “resting phase” and after 2-3 months resting, hair falls out and new hair grows in its place. Some people, however, experience more hair loss than is normal.<br>  <br>  As we get older, both men and women experience some hair loss. It’s a normal part of the aging process. Called Androgenetic Alopecia, it accounts for 95% of all hair loss. Androgentic Alopecia often runs in families and affects some people more than others. In men it is often referred to as Male Pattern Baldness. <br>  <br>  It is characterized by a receding hair line and baldness on the top of head. Women, on the other hand, don’t go entirely bald even if their hair loss is severe. Instead, hair loss is spread out evenly over their entire scalp.<br>  <br>  Hormones play the dominant role when talking about Androgenetic Alopecia. Simple put, both men and women produce testosterone. Testosterone can be converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) with the aid of the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase. DHT shrinks hair follicles causing the membranes in the scalp to thicken, become inelastic and restrict blood flow. This causes the hair follicles to atrophy. As a result, when a hair does fall out, it is not replaced.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, men produce more testosterone than women and experience more hair loss.<br>  <br>  While Androgenetic Alopecia is the number one reason why individuals experience hair loss, it is not the only one. Medical conditions such as hypothyroidism, ringworm and fungal infections can cause hair loss. Certain medications such as blood thinners, gout medication, birth control pills and too much vitamin A can cause sudden or abnormal hair loss as can following a crash diet, sudden hormonal changes, chemotherapy and radiation.<br>  <br>  Emotional stress, pregnancy, or surgery can also cause our hair to fall out and is usually not noticed until 3-4 months after the stressful event has taken place. Stress can cause a slowing of new hair growth because a larger number of hair follicles enter into the resting phase and no new hair growth is experienced.<br>  <br>  Another way in which individuals experience hair loss is due to mechanical stressors on the hair and scalp. Wearing pigtails, cornrows or tight rollers that end up pulling on the hair can scar the scalp and cause permanent hair loss. Hair products such as hot oil treatments and chemicals used for permanents can cause inflammation to the hair follicles which can also result in scarring and hair loss.<br>  <br>  Hey there, I'm just trying to help people find ways to help combat hair <br>  loss, because I used to be suffering from it. hope this helps!

I wouldnt like you to feel like you have to put a label on your feelings, Id say youre just a normal teenager :) my sister is a little older than you (just turned 15) and shes like you - funny mood swings, gets down easily, worries about her weight etc etc. Enjoy being young sweetheart, its over too soon!

In a few years your hormones will balance out and you will not understand why you were so slow, lazy, uninterested, self-absorbed. Depression is much more serious and not that difficult to diagnose. So please do not declare a psychiatrist as an idiot. You do not know anything about depression, so do not be so dismissive and disrespectful to a person that wanted to help you.|`|T64zP6fgaa	you could be depressed, <br>  to check chemical imbalances....  I dont know what that means, exactly, but <br>  you could have your doctor check your TSH (thyroid) which could cause these symptoms, and fluctuatin hormones could cause them also.....have your glucose levels checked also    <br>  If you have food sensativities or chemical sensativites , the wrong diet, no exercise, too much sugar, it could cause these things|`|AA10918808	Have you talked to anyone else apart from that psychiatrist about how you feel?  It sure sounds like depression to me (my son had a mental illness when he was 14, and I started with depression at 17/18 - it is far from rare at younger ages these days, sadly!).  <br>  <br>  Have you talked to your GP/family doctor, or have you a counsellor at school?  Mental health services for under-16s are not great in the UK, but my son did get some help when we asked for it.  It sounds as if your family life is in a state of upheaval, and this can be a common cause of depression.  All the best to you!|`|kklh2A8baa	try a new hobby or take up a subject you like, sport can help,or just spoil yourself, feeling down or depressed really is a state of mind.|`|lv6gkEVaaa	I think you need to get some friends and go out and have fun your only young trust me you don't sound depressed.

Xp5lgKWOaa	Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Drinking eight glasses of water is almost like a must. And do not forget to drink water in the morning, the moment you wake up. In fact this is one of the most rapid weight loss tips that the dieticians suggest to the people. <br>  Have organic foods for the breakfast like apples, bananas, plain yogurt, tomatoes, carrots, peppers, raw honey, wild smoked salmon, and so on. <br>  Keeping a track on the watch, go for an hour walk. It need not be power walking, but definitely it should be non-stop walk and that’s for sure, in a couple of days only, you’ll start finding the difference in you. <br>  Another tip regarding how to lose weight fast, easy and safe is that you should have your dinner about 4-5 hours before going off to sleep. <br>  The two-point program that will ensure the ultimate success is: regular exercise and balanced diet. <br>  Don’t depend upon fat burning diet supplements. They wont go a long way in helping you sustain your reduced kilos. <br>  Soft drinks cannot benefit you in any way. They contain 150 empty calories, so if you substitute one bottle of soft drink with water each day, it will do wonders for you. It will enable you to lose about 16 lbs per year. <br>  Sometimes boredom becomes a cause of overeating, so keep yourself busy. <br>  If you want to seriously control your weight, then you have to stop yourself from getting lured into trying tempting foods. <br>  As important is to pay attention to the fact that we eat the right food, equally vital is to keep a watch on the quantity. Without altering your diet plan, even if you’ll reduce 5-10% of your consumption, it will prove beneficial. <br>  Eat slowly so that you can get a feeling that you have had enough food and your tummy is full. Eat slowly and fully relish the taste.|`|FaVYRoXqaa	You have to at least eat less calories than you're burning in order to lose weight...I`m not sure how you expect to lose weight without putting at least some effort into it.  Losing weight is hard, you have to commit to reducing your calories and exercising at least 5 days a week (including weight training).<br>  <br>  Also, .if you have the typical hourglass figure, it does generally mean you have a medium or (generally) large frame.  The ideal weight for you is between 121-147.|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	5'3" and 170 is seriously overweight.  Probably by about 50 pounds.  <br>  <br>  It's great your husband loves you and thinks you're pretty.  That means you have his support and can do anything.  Good for you.  :)<br>  <br>  But you really need to exercise.  You need three days a week of strength training and another three of cardio training.  Your diet doesn't sound too bad.<br>  <br>  Here's a quick guide to keeping your diet good without counting calories.<br>  <br>  Eat six times per day at three hour intervals.  Each meal should be half protein and half healthy carbs.  Protein can be lean meat, beans, or nuts.  Healthy carbs: stick to fruits, veggies, and whole grains.  If it is white its not good for you.  If it involves processed sugar, same thing.<br>  <br>  Each portion of your meal (remember, one half protein, one half carbs) should be the size of the palm of your hand.  Six times a day at three hour intervals and drink a bottle of water with every meal.  Even just doing that will shed ten of those pounds over the course of a month.<br>  <br>  But if you want to look good on the beach, you HAVE to exercise.  I personally recommend Crossfit.  It's intense but it really works.|`|icB7HVxDaa	Cut off a leg?  Seriously, though, the only way to loose weight is to burn more calories than you put into your body.  Based on your height and weight, your body spends about 1500 calories a day no matter what you do (even if you laid in bed all day). I am a really big proponent of exercise, since it not only helps you lose weight, but also makes your whole body (especially your HEART) stronger.  I get that finding time to work out is hard work, but your body would feel sooooo much better if you found 30 minutes a day to work out.
Zre0wAiNaa	Take an antihistamine like tavegil or aerius, and you can use warm chamomile tea compresses on it to relieve swelling and itchiness as an interim measure. Get yourself to your GP.

D165sgXJaa	Unfortunately, celiac disease and dermititis herptetiformis are autoimmune diseases that seem to occur in higher incidence in people with other autoimmune diseases.  I know you are trying to keep up the intake of gluten until you are tested but you don't need more than the equivalent of a slice or two of bread at the most to keep exposed to it.  <br>  Hopefully, when you get tested and do go on a gluten free diet, it will help your symptoms and maybe help the treatment of your other conditions.  Dr Green in his book Celiac Disease A Hidden Epidemic discusses celiac disease in relationship to the other autoimmune diseases.  <br>  Good luck!!|`|r1MImdh3aa	Yes.

2ab8e22bb7c5e037f0993668cbccbd10aa	yes, Post-traumatic stress disorder is a psychiatric illness that can occur following a traumatic event in which there was threat of injury or death to you or someone else.<br>  <br>  (PTSD) may occur soon after a major trauma, or can be delayed for more than six months after the event. When it occurs soon after the trauma it usually resolves after three months, but some people experience a longer-term form of the condition, which can last for many years.<br>  <br>  PTSD can occur at any age and can follow a natural disaster such as flood or fire, or events such as war or imprisonment, assault, domestic abuse, or rape.<br>  <br>  The aim of treatment is to reduce symptoms by encouraging the affected person to recall the event, to express feelings, and to gain some sense of mastery over the experience. In some cases, expressing grief helps to complete the necessary mourning process. Support groups provide a setting where people who have had similar experiences can share feelings, and are very helpful.|`|0e5d3ef7412c2536ab71f0d8bab00093aa	no..i've had it for many many years now.... i wish it was temporary....|`|AA11401988	I don't know what to call this, but I am traumatized by a fire that happened in my apartment complex.

5232c3ab42cdb27268b773b66c977b3faa	I am not into dieting.<br>  <br>  Eating sensibly and exercising regularly are the keys.<br>  <br>  There will be some points in your life like 3 weeks at camp if there is no easy access to a grocery store where you will just have to go with the flow and start eating healthier after camp than worrying about camp, but at least you could take about a weeks worth of fruit to camp for you right now for the first week.  Don't let peer pressure bother you as it will be with you all of your life.<br>  <br>  <br>  Rewarding yourself say once a week with a hamburger plus another type of fast food meal.  About once a week get a double helping of dessert at one meal.  <br>  <br>  Eat pizza only like once every two weeks as pizza can really pack on the pounds.  But still go ahead and eat pizza.<br>  <br>  So, you really aren't getting away from the foods that you really like.<br>  <br>  The key is to get only about 35%, or about 1/3rd of your calories, from various types of fat.  You just have to practice your math.  All foods have the calories on the containers showing fat content and sugar content as required by federal law.<br>  <br>  Just several catches:<br>  1)  A lot of times, what you eat normally in one sitting will list whatever you are eating as "two servings".  I think I saw on a soft drink that the can listed itself as two servings.<br>  2)  A lot of fat free foods, health foods, etc... are low in fat or have zero fat but are loaded with SUGAR.<br>  <br>  In order to lose weight or maintain a proper weight, eating sensibly (means watch your % of fat intake from food and watch the amount of sugar in low fat foods like power bars and similar type items are low in fat, high in vitamins, but totally loaded with sugar and anything totally loaded with sugar is bad if you are trying to lose weight or maintain weight)  and exercise.<br>  <br>  What I found out once while taking care of a bunch of 2, 3, and 4 year old kids is that if I bought fresh fruit (apples, oranges, nectarines, etc... which should all be in season in the summer) is that they switched from 100% candy snacking to 100% fresh food snacking as these little kids were always active and always growing and always hungry.<br>  <br>  It amazed me that these little kids had the option of eating candy or fruit, and without me saying anything, or encouraging anything, they all went with the fresh fruit.<br>  <br>  Also, drinking water keeps the stomach more full and less hungry.<br>  <br>  If you have a microwave, "Lean Hotpockets" are usually short on fat from calaries and relatively low in sugar.<br>  <br>  Also, if you have a microwave, a baked potatoe in spite of its reputation of causing people to gain weight is a good way to get a low calorie fix for a hungry stomach.<br>  <br>  I would rather look at it as proper and healthy eating than dieting.<br>  <br>  But, as all of the above contain caleries except for water, eating too much of anything, particularly with exercise (and, two miles of walking, preferably on soft surfaces) daily should do it for the exercise protion.<br>  <br>  While at camp while everyone is munching on candy, you can be having apples, oranges, grapes, or, even better yet get a camp counselor who knows a thing or two about the wild as often wild berries and things of that nature grow in the wild and are maturing about right now and you cannot buy those things fresh in the store, and they taste wonderful.<br>  <br>  Just remember too much of anything with calories without exercise will result in a weight gain.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would stay away from "bars" or trail mix or anything with M&Ms as they may be considered low in fat and low in calories, they are most likely loaded with sugar.<br>  <br>  Also, I don't believe in some diets, which obviously cannot be done at camp which advocate that the foot you eat have no more than 15% or 20% of calories from fat as that is way too low.  Yes, you will lose weight eating like that in the recommended portions even without exercise, but those diets are so ridiculous that everyone is going to go off of them at some point and gain all of their weight back.<br>  <br>  I eat things like peanut butter and avacados as those have a lot of fat in them, but that fat comes from vegetables, so, in moderation, it is healthy for you.<br>  <br>  Watermelon is coming into season too about right now.  And, I would imagine that the guys at camp would polish off a watermelon before a bag of candy.<br>  <br>  Like when I was in Boy Scouts the first evening of every camp out, the most popular guy was the guy whose parents owned a popular doughnut chain as he would bring about a dozen boxes of doughnuts, so there are times where you cannot get away from it.<br>  <br>  Concentrate maybe on 49 weeks of proper eating and getting into an exercise routine while the 3 weeks of camp may just have to be an exception to your ordinary proper eating habits.|`|3620d1b5090fbe758ab7bbcfd99bac35aa	I have read a lot about diets and experienced some of them.<br>  Hereafter the best advices to loose weight that I have put together myself and that I experience mostly every day. It’s more than a diet; it’s a manner to live and to appreciate tasty, healthy meals preferring quality to quantity.<br>  This diet is long lasting, not annoying, not too difficult and without negative effects. It helps you as well to stabilize your weight than to loose weight, which is of course more difficult.<br>  <br>  First your normal weight (not the ideal weight) following to the BMI.<br>  Body-Mass-Index =   weight              <br>                                 height x height<br>  The Body-Mass-Index increases with the age. <br>  19-24 years:19- 24/ 25-34 y: 20-25/   35-44 y: 21-26/ <br>  45-54 years: 22-27/  55-64 y: 23-28/  64 years and more: 24-29<br>  An example: You are 1,74 m tall (5’7”) and you weight 83 kg (183 lbs). <br>  Ft = 30,48 cm/  Inch = 2,5 cm/  Pound = 453,59 g  =  0,45359 kg.<br>  BMI: 83/ 1,74x1,74 = 27,41    (183/ 5’7“ x 5’7“) = 27,41<br>  It’s ok when you are 64 years old and more. It’s not ok from 19 to 54 years.<br>  Ideal weight: 174 cm – 100 = 74 kg. It is tolerable if you have 10% more or less. More than 20% more or less is considered as problematical. But this scale is very rough and ignores important points as sexual characteristics, little stature.<br>  1. Eat what is at your taste. Have excellent meals with several dishes.<br>  2. Choose what is healthy for you. <br>  3. Try to find out by what dishes you loose weight and by what dishes you put on. People are different in all, what makes put on weight the one, doesn’t necessarily put on flesh to the other one.<br>  4. Don’t eat more than 1500 to 1800 kcal per day. It depends on your objective. If you want to loose about 5 kg (2,265 lbs) in a week, eat only 1200 calories. <br>  An adult woman needs about 2100 kcal a day.<br>  An adult man needs about 2600 kcal a day.<br>  The best is to eat 5 small meals during well dispersed all over the day. But many people lack of opportunities to do so. And many others fail because they are hungry, as they eat less. So they haven’t often enough willpower not to stay to their calories-limit.<br>  5. Try to get a table of food-calories by downloading it out of the Internet, for instance.<br>  6. Fix a maximum of weight you will absolutely not pass beyond. Weigh you every day, the best in the morning. So you can easily find out what makes you gain weight or loose weight. It’s much easier than counting calories every day. And the result is the same if you weigh you every day.<br>  7. Eat slowly and without stress. Let smelt tasty dishes on the tongue. Remember that you eat too much and without control under stress.<br>  8. Do prefer good tasting dishes with few calories to dishes with many calories: fruit, vegetables, meager meats, meager fish, sweets with less sugar or sweetening or sugar mixed with sweetening 1:1. For myself I prefer good savory meats and fish and then I eat less or I eat several dishes.<br>  An example: I start with fruits of the season. By the way fruits taste better if you put half a strawberry on a slice of a nectarine on a slice of an apple. Half a berry of a grape on a slice of a pear on a slice of a peach. Or make a salad of fresh fruit.<br>  An example of several dishes quickly to prepare: Fruit / smoked salmon with salad/ main dish/ dessert.<br>  Prefer fresh fruit and fresh vegetables or frozen vegetables to fruits and vegetables in cans and glasses.<br>  9. Drink at least 2 liters of beverage without calories. Water / Water with lemon juice and sweetening / Water with fresh fruit juice and sweetening.<br>  After getting up drink a glass of warm water.<br>  Drink sometimes water with a spoon of apple vinegar.<br>  10. If you discover in the morning that you have put on weight stop eating the same day five hours before going to bed. <br>  11. Don’t eat much at the evening. Or dishes with few calories: salads, soup of vegetables without butter or cream, prefer milk.<br>  12. Prefer fat and oil made out of vegetables: olive oil and colza oil. Do not heat over 100°, then it is not healthy anymore. So it is not good for roasting, grilling... <br>  Sunflower oil is good for everything, because healthy and neutral of taste.<br>  Restrict fat made out of cream and extracted out of animal protein.<br>  ATTENTION:<br>  13. At evening before TV. When the gustatory papillas are excited by some food even of very few calories it becomes difficult to retain the desire to eat something else. The best is to drink water or tea (peppermint, chamomile etc.) without sugar or sweetening.<br>  - If you can control your envy anymore, than do any activity, the best outside or wherever there is no food.<br>  14. Mental preparation is important too: be proud that you eat now very controlled, that you prefer quality to quantity, that you make a healthy and a tasty choice of dishes, that you eat like people who know much about good food, that you are self-controlled and have got a strong will to do right, that you have made new experiences and that you know more than many others about good food, that you can share your experiences with others and give them good advices.<br>  15. Mostly all diets have negative and only short effects. <br>  16. Make sports, I mean physical exercises, which make you transpire.<br>  Fact is, that if you are able to make sports during three hours a day, you loose mostly water, you build up muscles and you loose more or less 1000 gr. One hour of exercises is a loss of 300-400 gr.<br>  Be aware, that the higher you’re overweight, the more you are able to loose weight at the beginning of the diet.<br>  17. Tips for dishes: <br>  - Buy vanilla ice cream, mix fruit (strawberries or mangos or kiwis or.) in a mixer, freeze it, and mix the half frozen fruit with the ice cream 1:1. And you will get an ice-cream, better than those you can buy, with half fewer fat and half fewer sugar, and very easy to prepare. <br>  - Mix fresh fruit; add low fat yogurt and sweetening. Mix all.<br>  - Eat whole grain bread and rice. If you ask me on this side, I will give you an excellent recipe for whole grain bread easily to bake.<br>  - Eat only chocolate of more than 75% cacao.<br>  18. Last and efficient advice, try this:<br>  Fix your objective and limit the amount of calories per day according to it.<br>  Eat what you want in the morning and at noon.<br>  But in the evening eat fruits, or vegetables, or vegetable soup, or salad, or meat, or fish.<br>  Don’t eat then milk products, nor sweets, nor food made out of flour, nor potatoes, nor rice, nor nuts and I guess you will loose weight rapidly.<br>  <br>  Don’t ever forget that people are different. No diet and no advices are necessarily adapted to you.<br>  So every diet has to be adapted to the patient, and not the patient to the diet. That’s what I would like to write on the door of every school: The pedagogical principals must be adapted to the different pupils and not the pupils to the pedagogical principles.<br>  <br>  Best wishes, good will and good results.|`|974aa9069c713baea4d922b0d1526aeaaa	Myoplex bars... taste just like candy but are good for you.... best diet tip i can give you is to eat every meal (lunch bfast dinner) so you stay full with good food and wont be tempted to eat junk... use myoplex bars as snacks between the meals... for bfast you want to eat eggs and a lean meat (ham turkey).. lunch (chicken of some sort or salad).. dinner meat potatoes greens (steak, baked potatoe, green beans) stay away from fried food get grilled chicken.... dinner you can also eat fish for your meat... and make sure you are eating snacks in between (protein bars, nuts, trail mix) even trail mix with M&Ms is good... run or stationary bike for 15-30 mins every other day... and do abs every day... once you get your cardio up your fat will come right off... the hardest part of dieting is staying faithful so what i do is set weekly goals and have one cheat day a week where you can have candy and pop or whatever you want... then before you know it you wont even like the taste of candy... keep motivated man|`|XXJ0hRCDaa	all you can do is resist it......for me its not too hard cuz im used to it....|`|vJAakoUXaa	A good way to resist is to tell yourself it's gross and that you don't want it or like it. Also chewing gum has been an awesome help for me when i just want to eat junk food or i have cravings i bet it will help you too.

Wenn denen die Frauen, die dahin kommen, nicht gefallen, haben sie wohl ein echtes Problem.

Aber bedenke den Jojo-Effekt - i.d.R. nimmt man ja wieder zu wenn man eine Di?t beendet - weil man ja nicht seine "normalen" Ess- und Lebensgewohnheiten ?ndert. Von daher ist eine Kohlsuppendi?t genauso wie alle anderen Di?ten nicht zu empfehlen da auf Dauer zu einseitig, zu langweilig, nicht praktikabel etc. Empfehlenswert ist eine nachhaltige Umstellung der Ern?hrung - weniger Fleisch, kein FastFood, viel Obst, Gemüse etc. Für genauere/pers?nlichere Infos mü?te man mehr über Dich und Deine "Gewohnheiten" wissen...

Sie kann dich nur dadurch verletzen, dass du von ihr erwartest, dass sie nett ist. <br>  <br>  Ich habe eine Freundin, die mir ganz traurig berichtet hat, dass sie oft gegenüber anderen Leute sehr verletzend war. Aus den Beispielen, die sie mir erz?hlte, ging in meinen Augen hervor, dass sie ihre eigenen Grenzen nicht deutlich genug wahrnahm. Und da sie dann das Gefühl bekam, dass sie sich irgendwann wehren musste, lie? sie ihre "Spitzen" los. Sie verletzte andere mit ihren Worten.<br>  <br>  Ich habe ihr geraten, einfach rechtzeitig zu sagen, wenn ihr etwas nicht recht war, also ihre Grenzen freundlich und bestimmt festzulegen. Und sie war hellauf begeistert, weil die Menschen das nicht nur positiv aufnahmen, sondern sie auch keine verletzenden Bemerkungen mehr von sich gab.<br>  <br>  Also k?nntest du mal bei deiner Freundin darauf achten, in welchen Situationen so eine verletzende Reaktion geschieht und ob sie vielleicht zuvor nicht rechtzeitig "nein" gesagt hat, es aber gerne h?tte sagen wollen.<br>  <br>  Vielleicht k?nnte dir auch noch das eine oder andere Buch von Deborah Tannen helfen. Sie hat beispielsweise "Du kannst mich einfach nicht verstehen" und "Ich mein's doch nur gut" geschrieben. Es geht darum, dass man aneinanderger?t, obwohl beide Seiten es eigentlich "gut" meinen. Vielleicht kannst du ja erst einmal in der Stadtbibliothek ein Buch ansehen, bevor du es dir selber kaufst...<br>  <br>  Ich wünsche dir viel Erfolg. Aber sei sicher, bei manchen Menschen kannst du als Au?enstehender wirklich nichts machen. Sie sind sich selbst nicht "grün". Und dann ist es besser, wenn du dir eine andere Freundin suchst.

Sie sind sehr empfindlich gegenüber Hitze, Sauerstoff, Licht, Druck, usw. und werden daher bei der heute üblichen starken Verarbeitung der Nahrungsmittel weitgehend zerst?rt. Speziell der Verzehr raffinierter Kohlenhydrate (Fabrikzucker, Auszugsmehle), raffinierter ?le und Fette (Margarine) und ein zu geringer Frischkostanteil in der Ern?hrung sind die Hauptfehler, die dieses Problem verursachen.<br>  <br>  Die L?sung des ern?hrungsbedingten übergewichts liegt daher in einer Ver?nderung der Ern?hrung hin zu einer m?glichst gering verarbeiteten, naturbelassenen Ern?hrung. Eine gering verarbeitete Nahrung enth?lt noch alle biologischen Wirkstoffe, dadurch kann der Stoffwechsel wieder wie vorgesehen arbeiten und das Gewicht sinkt wieder bis zum Normalgewicht ab. Je nach Schwere der Stoffwechselst?rung ist dazu eine ensprechend konsequente Ern?hrungsumstellung n?tig.<br>  <br>  Ein weiterer Aspekt, der zus?tzlich oft eine Rolle spielt, sind E?st?rungen. Auch hier sind die Kalorien nicht Ursache des Problems, sondern es mu? die Ursache der E?st?rung gefunden und abgestellt werden. Jemand, der aus Frust oder Trauer nachts regelm??ig den Kühlschrank leerfri?t, kann keinen Erfolg mit einer Di?t haben. Stattdessen mu? herausgefunden werden, was den Betroffenen dazu veranla?t, den Kühlschrank zu plündern und diese Lebensprobleme müssen abgestellt werden - was in der Regel eine Therapie erfordert.<br>  <br>  Eindeutig ist die Ursache erkennbar, wenn Schadstoffe die Ursache des übergewichts sind. Jemand, der bspw. eine Cortisonbehandlung durchführt, nimmt in Folge zwangsl?ufig zu. Auch hier sind Di?ten und Sport sinnlos, denn die Ursache liegt in der Einnahme der Medikamente.<br>  <br>  Die L?sung liegt also zun?chst in einer Kl?rung der Ursachen - E?st?rungen, Schadstoffe, oder Ern?hrung - und in ihrer anschlie?enden Beseitigung. <br>  <br>  Sport ist dabei in jedem Fall empfehlenswert, es mu? deutlich gesagt werden, da? man mit Sport nicht die tats?chlichen Ursachen des übergewichts beseitigen kann.|`|6IIRLd8taa	Eigentlich  ist es ganz einfach: man kann nur abnehmen wenn man mehr Kalorien verbraucht als man zu sich nimmt.

It is important to know that the virus can be spread even when you cannot see any sores.<br>  <br>  I really don't know where that 4 year old could have gotten herpes unless she had them at birth.<br>  <br>  Newborns can be infected with HSV at birth. This usually happens when a woman has her primary outbreak close to the time of delivery and the baby is delivered through the vagina. Usually, in these cases, the woman either does not have symptoms or is unaware of symptoms. The chance of passing the virus to the baby is greatly reduced during recurrent outbreaks (less than 1% of the time). Babies infected with the virus at birth are at risk for serious health problems.|`|XcxdoqxYaa	did she have sex with it?|`|HR8hHqF3aa	It could just be that she has been in close contact ie someone with the herpes virus on there mouths.if someone with a cold sore touches something after touching there mouth with a cold sore then a child touches it and touches down below then it can be transfered.|`|ade7b43bd34ef6780a2f8edb19c1d5feaa	a 4 y. o. could have gotten it by contact-------like for example----she climbs up in someones lap and touches this persons  mouth----lets say that someone had a cold sore that was draining----child then puts their fingers in their mouth or even rubs their eye after touching the sore-----yes it can be this easy at times.|`|0817655303781d1a57a4800a31dc038aaa	No.  The virus dies quickly once it leaves the human body.  I know, our mothers always told us that we'd catch horrible diseases from public toilet seats---I mean, I still "hover" or lay down 2 inches of paper before I go near them just because I think it's gross to put my bare butt where some strangers bare butt just was---but vaginal herpes is sexually transmitted.  Now, if she has cold sores--that's herpes simplex virus 1.  Genital is herpes simplex virus 2.

AA11626529	The supraspinatus is a muscle that is part of the rotator cuff of the shoulder joint. They also include the infraspinatus, subscapularis and teres minor muscles. these four muscles form a cuff around the shoulder joint and stabilize it during shoulder movements. A mid to anterior tear of the supraspinatus means that the muslce has ruptured from the midpoint to the front completely. <br>  <br>  Yes surgery in the only way. This is because, if the shoulder joint destabilizes, wide movements at the joint may result in dislocations. And this would produce more wear and tear to the cartilage and hyaline bone surfaces. Recovery with surgery and physio takes about 6months to a year.|`|b0ea5610cfe82db0d74c5f7c41b34830aa	It is a tear in your rotator cuff at your shoulder joint. Mid tear meaning it may not be a complete tear of the cuff. Infra, supra, tres minor, supscap all muscles that make up your rotator cuff. You can have surgery at a surgery center and have some suture metal or absorbable anchors put in that attach your cuff to your humeral head bone to repair the tear. You can have an interscaline (needle in the neck by anesthesiologist) block and a pump that will drip in medication to your shoulder for 24hrs. to give some relief. Followed by rehab and your set.

Email me.|`|F86Ef0vhaa	If your boyfriend needs an antidepressant and citalopram has been prescribed, his doctor should be monitoring his condition for effectiveness of the drug. Not every person will find the benefit needed from it. I did. When I was diagnosed I didn't believe that I really had depression, but I agreed to take the medication because I was desperate to find some help. I got my life back. Fortunately, I only needed to take it for about 8 months. I have been told that an anti-depressant needs to be given at least 6 months. Most take 1-4 weeks to start having the desired effect. For me, within a few days I noticed I was crying less, and starting to feel again, and within 2-3 weeks I was a new person. Side effects - check out the site below for all the info, but for me the biggest one was that I didn't really care about having sex with my husband, and when we did, I didn't really get as much out of it as I did before. This side effect was much less harmful to our relationship than my mental state with the depression. There are antidepressants with less effect on sexual function, so if that's the problem your boyfriend could ask his doctor about a different drug. Withdrawal - listed on the site below, but I know if I accidentally forgot more than one day of the drug, I would get crabby and tired. I tried not to forget! When I was ready to try and go off of it, I tapered down - every other day for 2 weeks, every third day for 2 weeks, etc., over a course of 7 or 8 weeks. I was lucky that I did okay without it, and very lucky it was there for me when I needed it. I get SAD (seasonal affective disorder) in the winter but have found coping skills to get me through that without medications, but if I ever get to the point I was before, I'll be right back for a prescription. My son was diagnosed 2 years ago and still takes it. Some people need it for years.

LcSwDbr4aa	I think people who commit suicide primarily do it because it's one of the few things they have complete control over.  They didn't have control over the circumstances of their birth, their genetic disposition, the problems they eventually find themselves in before coming to the decision to end their life prematurely, etc.  Some of them may commit suicide as a way to prevent future suffering (for the few that have a horrible disease that by not comitting suicide, will only prolong their own pain and suffering, which then becomes a matter of their medical or health professional's decision to first do no harm).  But other than these few occasions, I think suicide is just a selfish and rash decision made by the person doing it.  I understand that life is tough and all, and certainly not fair by any human standards, but to make a decision to end your life, without regard to what it means to your family, friends and community; is pretty shallow no matter what the circumstances are.|`|uvOhOUllaa	some people feel trapped by where they are in life, or feel that their problems are too big/hard to handle. whether or not you view that as being weak or taking the easy way out, please don't judge everyone who commits/has thought of committing suicide. sometimes people are sick, mentally that is, and sometimes people face overwhelming depression that most people cannot even imagine, let alone could deal with. <br>  <br>  suicide is sometimes for the weak, but is also for the people who maybe just don't like themselves or aren't as happy as the rest of us.<br>  i don't mean to be argumentative at all or contradict anyone's opinion.|`|gRsuXxkbaa	suicide is a cowards way out no doubt about it  - when one is overwhelmed with the fear of consequences  - the fear of moving on by themselves  - the fear facing another day they end it all - fear is the key word  - suicide is an act of fear - there is  nothing rational that can explain suicide or justify it|`|WwQdhGtMaa	Good question .. but i disagree with some point u made up there i dont think all of them are weak .. some people just have too many problems and they cant sort them out they may have put thier every single effort in trying to fix the problem but it just doesnt work out and thats when they think its the end .. hun some problems are just too big and huge !! :)|`|AB7rfCrzaa	People commit suicide because they feel that it is the only answer to their problems. While we all would like to believe we were all put on this earth for a reason, in the mind of a suicidal person that does not matter they just can not deal with life anymore. Most of them feel isolated, unloved and that they are actually doing everyone else a favor by not being around anymore.<br>  Living problems can seem like a piontless journey when you are suicidal you can not see that one day things will get better and that you will be better off for having experienced them.<br>  <br>  I do not agree that suicide is for the weak or that it is a way for people to run away from their problems.<br>  On the contrary the act of committing suicde takes a lot of bravery, knowing that at any moment you will be gone from this world and having to face the after life, or lack there of. As for running away from problems, in the mind of a suicidal person they are not running away they are solving the problem.<br>  <br>  Suicide is a very serious thing, and a majority of people who commit suicide have a mental disorder causeing themto feel they need to kill themself.|`|CEKZsoFRaa	I think some people just look for the easy way out and do it and some people just need some attention but can't find any other way to get it.

EamhENYJaa	My father was colorblind. Luckily I am not. My father couldn't tell red from green so he knew the red light was always on the top and the green light was always on the bottom in traffic signals.<br>  When my father was shopping for clothes, he would always ask the salespeople what color things were.|`|xVmbTsAbaa	The tests have letters of the alphabet, such as a pink/red letter A with a green background.

oWJU0ky4aa	You can lose as much as you want to really. the safe,healthy way to lose weight and have a better chance at keeping it off is doing it slowly. Eat healthy foods and portion. Also excercise will help.GOOD LUCK<br>  Great Site and Great Food|`|o0skhlvAaa	It is healthy to lose about 1 pound per week. So in two months you should be able to lose about 8-10 pounds. <br>  <br>  If you excercise and eat healthy you might be able to lose a few extra pounds than that but losing too much weight at once can be hazardous to your health.
TBi4TMEcaa	You'll most likely be ok but tell your parents/ or call your doctor.
9pLdhuBnaa	This is not necessarily a bad thing.  What I mean by that is that this kind of bleeding can be a side effect from trying to skip a period, but I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.

I don't cuss and I am in Highschool. The truth is you should never feel bad or funny about not cussing.<br>   Just keep going on not cussing.<br>   Please. <br>    Good Luck|`|l3rJFgveaa	Im 16 and i dont cuss..<br>  <br>  i sometimes feel weird. but dont.. your doing youreslf a favor.|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	it's a personal choice mostly - following the crowd is not the best of the strategies in life (just see what happened to people who jumped on to madoff funds).. on the other hand, you might just feel sad for them since they are a product of their environment - either growing up listening to all that stuff every moment of every day or having to succumb to the influence of others.. another sad part is that even though they might not feel like cussing (yes, it is possible), they can no longer control themselves because they are used to it and after some repetition, it becomes sort of a second nature... consequently, their sky-high attitude when they cuss like sailors make them feel "cool" but it's actually an act of desperation to belong to the crowd.. a truly desperate thing to witness|`|mK1qUhkqaa	GOOD BOY.<br>  hahahah<br>  <br>  I'm a junior in high school, and I rarely cuss.  IT's just because in my house nobody really cusses, so it's jsut the way i was brought up.  You don't have to cuss to be "cool", esp in 5th grade that's what everyone thinks.  Don't cuss if it makes you feel uncomfortable!! Be yourself okay|`|KKhc5UiYaa	If i woulda cussed at your age it would gotten my a** whopped and dont feel wierd about not cussing at your age you shouldn't do that till your older anyways|`|8P1yz9t0aa	I h8 the first guy that answered|`|gfmTgLDKaa	Don't feel weird at all, cussing is very unintelligent like and you are showing great signs of maturity for not doing it at all. It's all about the media and everyone thinks its cool to follow everything that other people are doing. Don't do it, they think they're cool but they really look stupid. Don't feel weird at all, it's also against the lord to talk in such filthy language. :D <br>  <br>  Keep up the good work!|`|I3VpQQQDaa	You probably feel weird because you feel like you're left out. But you aren't. All the other people in your grade don't know what they are doing and they're immature. You should not feel weird because you are a polite child. Don't feel weird. You are doing the right thing by not swearing. They swear because they think it's cool.|`|wLmSfyhTaa	Please do not feel weird because you dont cuss. By you not cussing that just shows that you are way more mature than the other friends. If they are your friends, you might need to tell them to stop. Sounds like they need to wash their mouth out with soap and water.! Be cool, dont cuss.|`|zq86VbpMaa	i wouldnt do it because it becomes a bad habbit.You probably feel weird because if its your first time you are most likely nervouse.

LIVE ABOVE THE INFLUENCE!|`|52ViykGPaa	Oh shyt...let me stop LOL um its not weird its just who you are and if you think about its a good think but I cuss so much its an expression for me im 19 so yeah!!!!|`|gKZzXtmQaa	I went through the same thing. I am home schooled now, but when I was in school it was so hard to be around that. Even though you feel weird, don't try cussing. And if you're a bible believer it says in the bible not to cuss. I'm sure the reason you're feeling weird is because you feel a little left out. But cussing is really unattractive anyway, and it sets a bad example. So don't feel bad that you're the only one who doesn't cuss. I am in middle school now, but in fifth grade I only had one friend who was really close and she didn't cuss. Just avoid it and stay close to your bff. Cussing makes beautiful people look like hobos.|`|XunYXC7Raa	OMG! I didn't cuss when I was in 5th grade.I knew some people who did but I didn't.Don't stress it, you shouldn't cuss.You probably feel werid because it is the norm to most of your friends.But that doesn't mean it should be to you.Be a leader and don't cuss.Not a follower who is just cussing to fit in or be cool.|`|djgpu2qNaa	Cussing is the sign of a poor vocabulary; people swear because they aren't smart enough to find a word that really expresses how they are feeling, because they are too immature or too angry to be thinking straight. There's no reason to feel bad about not swearing--it means that you are very good at expressing yourself in a meaningful way.|`|A9AurTy3aa	You can't blame rap music but maybe specific rap artists that elder siblings listen to around younger 5th graders. <br>  <br>  Dont worry about cussing if you don't want to you don't have to but most people cuss when they get older its just the way society works.|`|7xZkLofqaa	because everyone else is doing it. obviously you dont want to but you feel like people look at you like a priss if you dont<br>  but youre only in 5th grade. which no one remeberes down the road. <br>  so i wouldnt worry about it. its not like they can make fun of you for not swearing. just be like.. yea. cause swearing makes you look like less of an idiot right? hahah oh wait nooo it doesnt.<br>  but really, dont worry about it. im 19 and i like never swear. <br>  this too shall pass ,love|`|EQ4I1Tt4aa	Well we as people like to fit in. no one likes not to be in a group. and ur friends you mayfeel will be more friend like if you curse like them. but it sets you apart remember profanity is just an ignorant mind trying to express itself.<br>  <br>  sry for any wrong spelling lol.|`|ed8c394758bb815b5025dbae82e638aeaa	because they think they are being cool by cussing, they are just trying to fit in, which is really dumb for them to do...don't cuss|`|ASlObUaIaa	cause everyone else probably does and at your age its  near impossible to go against what everyone else does without feeling like there may be something wrong with you.  your fine.|`|7tJYsBEEaa	you shouldn't feel weird. people either cuss because they're really mad, they think it's cool, or they aren't smart enough to come up with appropriate words.|`|G3p7cglxaa	cussing isint a good way to start life. i dont use it much u shouldent eather dont follow there path if they swer alot then there not gonna be good kids in the future|`|T8ph72Czaa	There's nothing wrong with upholding a higher standard of language.

8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	Not a bad idea, giving up and waiting until college.  Here's why.<br>  (1) In high school, many more girls are ready to date than guys.  This puts the power in the hands of the guys.  Not good.  My younger brother, and later my son, benefited from this, but both talked about the surprising adjustments they had to make to be successful daters in college.<br>  (2) It gives you the opportunity to develop yourself, discover projects worthy of your time, figure out your values and who you are becoming.  You are developing incredible brainpower at your age. Make the most of it by eating well, exercising, getting enough sleep, and studying/working on things that interest you.  It will set a wonderful foundation for your future.  This will ultimately lead to you attracting a more accomplished (like you!) and better mate when you are ready to select a life partner.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  It gets better. ;-)|`|KWl605JTaa	well let me tell you,<br>  there are way more than 1000 guys out there.<br>  |`|cSqx1DxKaa	I think you're smart and mature.

There's also a lot of guys who go because there parents make them and have no plans on waiting for booty. But u can figure out who's who. There's not many of you left out there. Don't give in.

9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, sometimes a cyst can cause the periods to be late.  However, I would recommend calling your doctor back in the morning to see what they say.  Let the receptionist know that you absolutely need to talk to your doctor about this issue.  Then if the nurse later calls to ask questions about her know that you really need to talk to the doctor about this issue.

AA11155064	Cycles vary.<br>  <br>  The body has a multitude of cycles, few of which we regularly recognise. Many cycles may happen in sync with others just through sheer good fortune. <br>  Menstrual cycles are simply more readily experienced and noted than many other cycles -- and aren't always inextricably linked. <br>  Emotional expressions and libido can often co-relate with the presence -- or absence -- of periods. <br>  <br>  So too, can your husband's libido cycles vary.  Variations may only be noted when there is a difference. His cycles may be changing subconsciously in response to menstrual pheromones emitted by yourself or another often encountered emitter. <br>  When both your cycles synchronise it's woooonderfulll !|`|rQfzifT7aa	Women go through so many changes.

XwVDlhsSaa	That's a false rumor. You cannot get HIV or AIDS from a toilet or skin to skin contact or the air. The virus has to be sexually transmitted or come in contact with your blood such as through a contaminated needle. Some people are born with it but that's because their mother had it. HIV is also dose mediated. It's not known how much of the virus you need to get infected, but one or two viruses will not infect you. <br>  <br>  Also, it's not a gay disease. Straight people have it too.
yboEJ4jHaa	Don't get rid of you ovaries, get rid of your uterus! That will solve all the problems and you get to keep your estrogen production. Having your ovaries out has far more long term health implications than a hysterectomy<br>  <br>  Seriously, it would be difficult to find someone to remove a healthy body part or do a tubal ligation in this litigious world of ours.|`|V5K66Xb4aa	i've never met a woman who hasn't hated her female pains enough to want her uterus removed. best advice, bring it up to your doctor, just be prepared to hear what you dont want to hear. its the law that you cant have a hysterectomy or oophorectomy just because you think you need one.<br>  ask about getting mirena for birth control, i got it when i worked at planed parenthood. i hadnt had kids yet, but i couldnt handle the horomones from the pills and couldnt even remember to take them even though i worked at the clinic. it has to go in during your period, and its painful. ive had it for 5 months now and ive had mild pain and contiuous spotting the whole time, so im kinda wanting to have it taken out, but the pills really make me insane. so i have to just tough it out.|`|2TgUHP8Xaa	I think you'd really need to discuss this in depth with a specialist. Yes usually they don't want young women or women that haven't had a child before to have such a procedure, but seeing that you have health issues already..that may factor in. However, tubal ligation will not stop you from having periods. Hormones are hormones..you'd have to have your uterus removed, and I'd very highly doubt they'd do that.|`|813081a46e043e25a36cd618cd7565efaa	Ok personally i wouldn't go for the whole removal of the ovaries, you will be dealing with hormones and all sorts of **** for the rest of your life. Most states make you wait until you 21 to have your tubes tied, even if you haven't had kids and with your health concerns im sure if you talked to your gynecologist he would probably agree that its the better option. i think you should talk to your gynecologist anyways he can tell you what all your options are and the risks involved and the after effects. make an appointment with him/her and have a talk. Good luck
0VkZ70f2aa	yes! tell the doctor right away.  She will forgive you with time.. This is probably one of the hardest things you're going to have to do.  This is big and she needs help.

I'll pray for you.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Yes, what she is going through is most likely from her previous drug use and her doctors need to know this asap.

I'm sorry you have been put in this position and are dealing with this, be strong.|`|wLmSfyhTaa	Do you believe in God? Do your mother believe in God?

She needs medication asap. tell the Dr. soon.|`|KKhc5UiYaa	Yes you definitly should tell the docs, because there might be some other medication they can give her to help, how are they going to help if they dont know all the details?|`|sWXrnErnaa	Oh love Im so sorry you have to go through this....<br>  <br>  yes your mums mental health is probably due to her drug use and YES her doctor needs to know this for a couple of reasons....<br>  1) so he can better diagnose what is happening with her and find the appropriate treatment<br>  2) some medications given for depression can be addictive with your mums addictive personality the dr needs to know this too. <br>  <br>  I think you or someone needs to let the dr know what is happening - make an appointment or ring the doctor and tell him you have some information about your mum that she is afraid to tell him, explain that you dont want them to know that you have told them at this point because you are concerned that your mum wont understand why youve "betrayed" her (not that you are at all but that she may see it that way in her mental state!)<br>  <br>  As for your mum forgiving you, yes she will when she is better and can see that you were in fact doing this because you love her and care for her very much and want her to get well.<br>  <br>  It is a terribly hard thing to watch your parents fall apart, and not be able to feel like you can help her. <br>  <br>  As for her attempting suicide that is a cry for help, so dont be afraid to help her, unfortunately many drug users have mental issues when they try to get off the drugs as their bodies have become used to being in a certain state and it takes quite some time for them to heal and move on both physically and mentally<br>  <br>  I suggest you also get in touch with a group for family members going through what you are either through the mental health side of things or drug rehabilitation, either of those will offer you and the other members of your family support and understanding as well as be able to put you in touch with other services etc that may be of assistance.<br>  <br>  I hope everything works out fine and you and your mum can move on through this and both be happier and stronger for it.|`|qT7bVDRiaa	Tell the doctors everything you know. This may or may not have something to do with her previous drug use, but the doctor needs to know so he can make that determination. This could get worse. She can only be helped if the doctor knows what he is dealing with. Your mom will easily forgive you once she is well.|`|ZrgjGMM6aa	personally i would never give someone antidepressants or any kinda of that medication.. try a psychologist with a good reputation not a psychiatrist not only can there be side effects from these drugs they can be very addictive.

You need to speak with your mother's doctor about her paranoia and her drug use. It is important that they have all the information so that they can give her the proper treatment. <br>  <br>  Was your mom hospitalized after this suicide attempt? If not, you need to contact your mom's doctor right away to let him/her know. You may also want to contact your local suicide hotline. You need support during this difficult time. Your mom may need to be hospitalized for a short time to make sure she is not a danger to herself.|`|wwwiWaK8aa	Hey I can;t imagine what you are going through. This is a toughie but i think you need to tell your mom's doctor about her previous drug use. they cannot treat her properly without the facts. and as much as it will hurt her and you to do this, you have to. She may be upset and angry, but trust in your heart that once she gets better she will see the reality of what happened and know you did the right thing.<br>  <br>  She needs help and you are in a position to help her get it. Take a deep breath and do what you need to do.<br>  <br>  good luck

AA10551261	You can still be pregnant and have a period early on. She should take a pregnancy test. It could very well be a bladder infection also even though she has no pain or burning.  She doesn't have to have all the symptoms and they may not be apparent early on but start showing later on. Pressure on the lower abdomen, urinating often, and cramping are symptoms of a possible bladder infection.|`|e0d78770d4a9419c98a1e175ba21a9bfaa	been bit by a deer tick? or maybe its fibromyalgia?  there are herbs you can take to get rid of tapeworm|`|8d42ow2Raa	I agree taking a test would if nothing else rule it out for sure instead of guessing.  Having a missed period is not always true when pregnant. I know of people who did not know they were pregnant because they had periods all the way up to just before delivering the baby.  After reading about tapeworms most of them say that some symptoms include diarrhea, and you did not mention that at all.  Hope it helps and she feels better soon.

See your doctor asap.|`|1XKJN2XFaa	This hapened to me when I was pregnant,you probably have a urinary tract infection. I didn't realize I even had one until it was so out of control it put me into pre-term labour which was stopped thank goodness. The Dr will just get you to leave a urine sample and put you on pills for usually 10 days.<br>  I hope this helps you as I had the exact same symptoms, and it was a UTI|`|mdngXb3caa	Its most likely a UTI. I've had one before. You need to go to a doctor asap because the bleeding only means its getting much worst. A UTI can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease.

It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|F8EnH6JQaa	TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  the first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your boy adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  If man made it, don't eat it<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  Walk your dog, or walk a friends dog<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

The only cure for depression is psychological/psychiatric treatment.|`|856f9f629e121d326752210489850fd9aa	Depression is caused by chemical imbalances of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and other neurotranmitters in the brain which stabilize emotions. Psychologists state that depression is a unhealthy state which we 'can' work through in order to experience greater levels of happiness. Some who daily experience deep chronic depression may require both prescribed medication along with 'Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy {M.B.C.T.') provided by Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapists and there are some who experience chronic-but not deeply chronic depression who work well with M.B.C.T. alone. *Dr Jon Kabat-Zinn PhD along with Psychologists Mark Williams, John Teasdale, and Zindel Segal have authored an excellent self-help book called: "The Mindful Way through Depression: Freeing Yourself from Chronic Unhappiness". Mindfulness, a simple yet powerful way of paying attention to your most difficult emotions and life experiences, can help you break the cycle of chronic unhappiness once and for all, that you may experience greater levels of happiness. In 'The Mindful Way through Depression', it is explained why our usual attempts to "think" our way out of a bad mood or "just snap out of it" leads us deeper into the downward spiral of depression. Through very insightful lessons-drawn from both Mindfulness and Cognitive Therapy - Dr Jon Kabat-Zinn PhD and Psychologists- Mark Williams, John Teasdale, and Zindel Segal demonstrate how to sidestep the negative habits that lead to unhappiness and despair, including self-blame and rumination so you can effectively face life's challenges with much resilience.|`|kTRcYaFcaa	No, bu they sure help if they are supportive and understanding.<br>  <br>  The only cure for depression is to find out what the root cause of that depression is and then work on getting rid of that - not difficult, if you put your mind to it.<br>  <br>  Just ddon't listen to well meaning folk - they will send you off on all sorts of goose chases - only listen to those who have been where you are and who know the way out - site below may help -best of luck.|`|1iXvphNYaa	If there is such a thing as a cure for depression, or even depression for that matter, it is closeness with yourself. For, it's other people that usually lead us in the first place to believing we have to be like them to be happy. Having people in your life is great but your first friend should always be yourself. Thats how you end up making the wisest choices in people to confide in and be around, the people who will accent your life and help you find the best choice to deal with whatever you're facing in your life. Learning to be responsible for ourselves and the choices we make and not seeking out a place to aim blame or shirk the truth. Once we can do that the chances of depression diminish because you have found the source of true happiness, which is surely within, and gave up the idea of trying to be the lie that someone else has tried to convince you that you need to live up to. If you can't believe in and give joy to yourself then no one else stands a chance. Just my philosophy. So far its holding up. Peace.|`|3DeAXh8jaa	The cure in depression is all about developing faith in yourself, knowing that if it does come, you don't need friends and a huge ego to feel good about yourself.

You can possibly meet someone in a similar position as you which could overcome your depression.<br>  <br>  Yes, I do believe friends can help depression but I believe the only way for a person to overcome or cure something like depression is themself.

Js09FbDnaa	tylenol & advil help the hydrocodone bond to the pain receptors in the brain better. Also because just 5mg of hydrocodone is a strong amount for someone not opioid tolerant. Vicodin is made for people in pain who were not taking opiates before and it's strong enough for them. It is not meant for chronic pain. And it's impossible to make a 5mg pill large enough without some filler. Rather than using inactive fillers like many drugs do, they use Tylenol because it works on the same receptors & will help relieve the pain even better than just 5mg hydrocodone + inactive ingredients alone. Also because hydrocodone is addictive they want to prescribe the lowest dose possible. Adding tylenol provides more pain relief meaning less addictive medicine is needed.<br>  <br>  The pain management part, if you have enough pain to warrant use of opiate painkillers, several times a day, long term, then it is safer to switch to something like MS Contin or Oxycontin.codiene & hydrocodone are meant for moderate-severe acute pain (pain lasting 6 weeks or less), and if you need to take several vicodins a day longer than that, you can get better relief, with less pills from a long-lasting medicine. Once your pain starts it takes more medicine to stop it. A low constant dose or morphine can help people much more efficiently than hydrocodone which only lasts 4-6 hours with or without tylenol.  If you are truly suffering from chronic pain there is not more risk of addiction from one opiate to another. And once you've become opiate tolerant from vicodins the side effects are minor when moving to a different opiate. It's not like vicodin is this amazing miracle painkiller but morphine is this awful dangerous medicine.|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	that would be the worst idea ever. <br>  <br>  hydrocodine should only be distributed in small does and the patient should NEVER be given a refill without another doctor's prescription.  HC is one of the most addicting substances in the legal drug market today and it doesn't need to be sold to anyone in it's pure form, that's why they put it in with other things, so people CAN'T take alot of it.<br>  <br>  if they really have a chronic problem, they should be seeing their doctor on a regular basis anyways..  yes it would be helpful for a small few, but many more than the ones in pain would take advantage of it and it would be hard to keep the two apart.|`|AA11269991	Well due to the obvious facts you stated, that being that abuse is on the incline, i might add at a very alarming rate. Pain pills, diet pills, anti-depressants, any drug that has a effect that others see as a positive are now the reasons why the FDA has came down so hard.<br>  <br>  In this day and age, the prescriptions we receive are so readily available and not so illegally to obtain it's worse than any other drug/alcohol / tobacco or other things that give you that high.<br>  <br>  From what i remember if you were to be able to legitimately obtain Hydrocodone in it's purest form it would come with inherent ill side effects. I am sure the FDA has shown excessive damage to the internal organs due to the testing that was conducted. Also it would create another issue. That being that it would only be a matter of time before some "Home Chemist" discovers how to create a new, bigger, better, cheaper high. I think  it would show an utter lack of responsibility on society as a whole to let another "Methamphetamine" come out of the wood work. <br>  <br>  Quite simply put there is too much risk involved and not to mention to many current issues at stake. Opiates are the new cocaine, weed, lsd, and everything else the world over has been addicted to only now you only need a prescription, or you could steal it. Trust me i know several people have stolen it, will steal it, will continue by any means to get their next bottle by any means. <br>  <br>  There have been many studies on the purifications of Opiates and the benefits vs the possible side effects. In the balance are people's lives. To which point the FDA makes their rules on what can or cannot be made and distributed legally is entirely what they are intrusted to do.<br>  I understand your argument and it does show your intelligence and i agree with your many very well stated points. However the potential for something seriously dangerous to come of it would just bring those who can't just stop taking the pills once their prescription is over is too big of risk.<br>  <br>  There is another potential risk of purifying opiets in that it would just as easy to get your hands on it as it is to get your hands on a bag of weed. To the point the scum of society has brought us all down to their level. If we need something for pain we have to take the preverbial horse with a bad leg. Tougher laws will not change anything. <br>  <br>  On a side note i would say someone very close to me worked for a pharmacy and they stole a bottle(s) of 1400 tablets of Vicodin (the name brand stuff). That person has an addiction, however their common sense was overidden by their compulsion to get that feeling that most opiets create. I can only imagine the issues at hand that he/she and I would have to endure due to their lack of judgement if Vicodin was a pure form. <br>  <br>  I have listed a study that was done by the FAA back a few years ago. It does make a few valid points.

You should start off slowly if you're not used to exercise so it is not so much of a shock to your body. You must eat properly. Do some research on calories and exercise. Everyone looks at how many calories they take in, but the most important piece of information I've found is that there are 3500 calories in a pound of human fat. Lower you calorie intake by 500 AND exercise every day. You should lose more than a pound a week.<br>  <br>  Stay motivated! Promise yourself you can do it. If you start to lack motivation, find a friend to get fit with, join a gym, take up a sport, start a blog of your exercise regime and update it every day or take a picture of yourself now and show yourself that this is not what you want to look and feel like!

AA10975447	A lot of times, girls who start having sex really young have really bad things going on in their home lives and have serious emotional problems. If I was that girl's teacher, and you told me that she was promiscuous, I'd probably ask the girl to come talk to me after class. Then I'd ask her how things were at home. If she says they're okay, I'd let her know I would be free if she ever wanted to talk about anything. And if she mentioned there was abuse going on, I'd call the authorities.<br>  <br>  It's very, very difficult to keep up a safe and responsible sex life when you're 13. Being safe and responsible means you have to use condoms and birth control. You have to see the doctor regularly for check ups. And you have to make a lot of serious decision about how to run your life and who to hang with. A lot of 13-yr-olds are not able to do these things.<br>  <br>  If this gal is your friend, why don't you ask her how things are at home? A 13-yr-old generally doesn't act out like this for no reason. How's her family life? Who are the rest of her friends? Does she do drugs? How is she doing in school?|`|HeBFxZVCaa	yes and very inapropriate
Zu7GJeU4aa	Yea to me now I have to be at work at 8 and it's after 12 now.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Adopt a fixed sleep regime; it's better, for most people.|`|GBG2hbQ4aa	I have always had that same problem.  There are two neurotransmitters in the brain that control our wakefulness/sleepiness (serotonin and melatonin).  It is quite easy to throw these two out of balance.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, you (like myself) perpetuate the pattern you describe.  By staying active and keeping the lights on to accommodate that activity, you keep your brain from shifting into making more melatonin.  It is the melatonin (or lack of) that keeps you from getting sleepy.  <br>  <br>  The best approach to remedy this situation is to establish a set bedtime routine.  That would include a consistent time to go to bed and to wake up.  Regardless of whether it is a workday or not, maintain that schedule.  It would also include creating some bedtime rituals that allow your mind and your body to prepare for sleep.<br>  <br>  One critical factor to this process is ...DON'T SLEEP WITH THE LIGHT ON!   Our sleep patterns were established long ago, back in the cavemen days when there was no artificial light.  The brain naturally responds to darkness by producing more melatonin, which induces sleep.  As the sun rises, and it becomes light out, the brain responds by producing more serotonin, which causes you to wake up.    <br>  <br>  Because we can light up our homes so well, it is easy to stay up into the night and way too easy to throw our natrual sleep cycles into chaos.

The astounding and statistically significant fact is that 20% of the gay men who volunteered for the hepatitis B experiment in New York were discovered to be HIV-positive in 1980 (a year before AIDS became "official" in 1981). This would mean that Manhattan men had the highest incidence of HIV anywhere in the world, including Africa, the supposed birthplace of HIV and AIDS.

XTepTcoCaa	Stomach Cancer Symptoms  Stomach cancer is one of the most common types of cancers. Almost a million people get diagnosed with stomach cancer every year throughout the world ...   Stomach Cancer:<br>   Growth of carcinogenic cells in stomach leads to cancer of stomach. There are mainly two types of stomach cancer known as intestinal stomach cancer (this type of cancer is common in people of old age) and diffuse type (which is common in people of certain group, surprisingly people in certain geographical area such as Japan, Korea etc. are more prone to stomach cancer than any other place on earth). Most of the sufferers of stomach cancer are people above age 70 and majority of which involve men patients.<br>   <br>   Who is at risk?<br>   People who eat less or no vegetables and more preservative added food or junk food are at highest risk of developing stomach cancer. Also people in their old age (people of age group 65 and above) are at high risk. Along with the above specified possible risk groups, people who are suffering (or those who had history of) from certain types of diseases such as Achlorhydria, Pernicious Anaemia, bacterial infections of stomach (helicobacter pylori). People who smoke are also at high risk of developing stomach cancer.<br>   <br>   In some cases, stomach cancer has been witnessed to be hereditary (Although this scenario is very rare, any possibility cannot be denied).<br>   <br>   Diagnosis of Stomach Cancer:<br>   There are quite a couple of tests used to confirm stomach cancer in patients, however endoscopy is highly trusted test which varies in complexity based on the situation. Blood sample test and biopsy (samples of cells from the inside lining of the stomach are taken) can also be utilized in order to find out any abnormality. A small robotic tool is used to take pictures of inside of the stomach to find out any abnormal growth which can act as an alarm raiser. Ultrasound scanning also can be used to diagnose stomach cancer. Barium meal (white barium liquid) test also can be used to diagnose this disease in which once the liquid is consumed by the patient, the patient's stomach is examined using X-rays. Along with the above specified techniques, there are many other screening tests available for diagnosis of stomach cancer such as gastroscopy, biopsy and microscopy etc.<br>   <br>   What are the symptoms of stomach cancer?<br>    <br>   <br>   Stomach cancer shows very little or almost no symptoms in its early stage. Occasionally, patient may experience a very light stomach ache. Once the cancer starts growing strong, patient may experience severe stomach ache, loss of weight due to loss of appetite, blood in stool, bloating problem (or bloated feeling) after eating anything, abdominal pain and discomfort, any type of change in bowel habits, Ascites, Jaundice and nausea are few of the symptoms those make life difficult for the patient. With the advancement of time, new techniques are also being invented to confirm the growth of stomach cancer.<br>   <br>   What are the different type of treatments available for stomach cancer?<br>   Like any other type of cancers, treatment options for stomach cancer also involve chemotherapy, surgery and medication. In most of the cases, surgery is used to remove a part of or entire stomach. Success of surgery in stomach cancer depends on the stage in which stomach cancer was detected (which is very low as most of the cases are diagnosed in advanced stage of stomach cancer). At times, the treatment of stomach cancer may include combination of surgery and medication to help eliminate carcinogen cells from body after a surgery to remove infected part of or entire stomach. Radiotherapy and biological therapy (also known as immunological therapy) are also used to destroy carcinogen cells from the patient's body. Along with the above mentioned treatment methods, there are many other methods and drugs currently under trial.<br>   <br>   Most of the treatments specified above show significant side effects on the patient's health, hence it is very important to follow a proper diet regime and medication in order to cope up with the problems caused by those side effects.<br>   <br>   How should I minimize my risk of stomach cancer?<br>   1) Quit smoking, as smokers are at the highest risk level of developing any type of cancer.<br>   2) Try to include vegetables and fruits in your daily diet and avoid junk or processed food.<br>   3) Try to avoid toxic substances such as chemicals etc. Take necessary precautions before you handle such things.<br>   4) Exercise regularly in order to stay fit and active.<br>   Related Blog<br>                                                                Breast Cancer Treatment: Get it in India | Best Tech News, Reviews ...                                                         <br>                                                            Now day’s availability of high quality medical treatment facilities and most experienced Read more...<br>  <br>                                                                All 1St Chemo|`|7HKTDcvYaa	This is not the best treatment, it does cause most stomach cancers to shrink or stop growing. <br>  China has a far higher incidence of stomach cancer, and while waiting for treatment patients are advised to consume 3 daily doses of  broccoli sprouts (seeds sprouted and grown to about 5 cm in height.) The dosing is about 70 grams, for a total of 210 per day. Now by the time the surgery is scheduled, often up to 6 months later, it is not uncommon to discover that the cancer appears to be in remission. But if the broccoli sprout treatment is stopped, many of those cancers will be back within a year. For older patients, many have forgone surgery and stayed with repeated treatment with the broccoli sprouts. For a 60 year old or older this appears to work, but often after 4-5 years, metastasis demonstrates that this short term solution was not the best. <br>  <br>  Some have been fortunate enough to have no metastasis, and the procedure for them gives the appearance of the ideal solution. The conventional treatment is not without drawbacks, and it too has recurrence, even metastasis, so this hick sort of a solution is taken mostly to avoid problems before the conventional treatment is possible.<br>  <br>  There is a small side effect. Most people taking the broccoli sprout treatment suffer from hypothyroid condition because the treatment reduces the availability of iodine to the thyroid gland. This can be mitigated by painting some area of skin with tincture iodine. This problem might not occur where iodized salt is normal part of the diet.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Ready for new experiments or not|`|9035ecc230615edb7a8f8452d54d7898aa	I believe either chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgical removal of the stomach would be the only ways to treat stomach cancer.

Thousands of people suffer from stress, depression, fatigue, and other forms of emotional strain.<br>  <br>  When you feel the need to cut, snap a rubber band on your wrist. A more effective way is to rub a cold piece of ice on your wrist. You will feel a jolt and some pain; it is a fantastic substitute for cutting.<br>  <br>  If you feel as if things are getting out of control, as for the support of your friends and family. Tell them how you are feeling. Cry at home; bury your face into a pillow and scream and sob all you want. Crying can release bad feelings (endorphins?) and can help you feel much better, mentally and physically. <br>  <br>  Drinking, cutting, suicide, etc. is not the way to go!

It sounds like bacteria or commonly called BV. It is not really an SDT because women who have not had sex can get it. It is just rare.<br>  <br>  You usually have to ask them to test you for bacteria and tell them to treat you with an antibiotic. There are only about 2 that will actually treat bacteria. Take all they give you. One of the meds is called Flagyl and I am not sure about the other one.|`|V5K66Xb4aa	there are special feminine washes for after you have sex, they really help preventing you from getting that funky odor.|`|o0skhlvAaa	If the odor smells fishy, you might have bacterial vaginosis infection.

Go to a clinic for birth control. Look in the Yellow pages. That's a very easy place to start. Birth control will probably help your heavy periods. When you go to a clinic, such as Planned Parenthood, they will examine you before giving you birth control. Some places give it out for free I think but in my experience it is usually about $25. BUT DO NOT FORGET ABOUT SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES! Birth control does not prevent them. If your boyfriend has been sexually active and has had unprotected sex (sex without a condom) in the past, he may have or be at risk for an STD. Please have him tested for STD's, including HIV, if this is the case. If you do not feel comfortable talking to him about that, maybe you should reconsider having sex. You need to be mature enough to talk about it with him if you are going to take your relationship to the next level. If you really really feel uncomfortable talking to him about his sexual history and the fact that he may need to get some tests done, just stick with using condoms. Condoms are cheap. You can get them for free at the health department, at some schools, at college health centers and dorms, and or course they are for sale at the pharmacy, grocery store, gas station, etc. As far as I know there is no age limit! How long have you been in your relationship? Are you in high school? Whatever happens, PLEASE do not have unprotected sex. I am so happy you are thinking about not getting pregnant, but also remember the part about not contracting an STD. If you and your bf cannot wait until birth control becomes available, please use condoms until you can get to a clinic.
TBi4TMEcaa	There is always the risk of an STD. Having someones else's fluids in you is never safe. <br>  <br>  Maybe this will help:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thewellproject.org/en_US/HIV_The_Basics/Oral_Sex_Whats_the_Real_Risk.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.thewellproject.org/en_US/HIV_...</a>|`|9GUZzm5Saa	Oral sex is a form of sexual intercourse whereby a person will stimulate a partner’s vagina, in case of a woman, or penis when on a man, with the use of the mouth and tongue. When the oral sex is performed on a woman it is referred to as cunnilingus and when on a man it is referred to as fellatio. Oral sex can also be performed on the anus for stimulation purposes and this sexual act is referred to as analingus. Contrary to popular believe oral sex is not safe against every sexually transmitted disease, even when performed with extreme caution. Some of the more common diseases transmittable via oral sex include Chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes and hepatitis. To minimize the risks of contamination the best solution is to use condoms and dental dams when performing or receiving oral sex.
pvYy6iTSaa	Andrew - If both your gf and you never had any kind of sex previously, then the one std you could have gotten is herpes.  It is caused by a virus that can be passed by skin-to-skin contact, regardless of whether or not you used a condom.

If you are covered under any sort of insurance plan (be it through college or through your parents), you should check to see what mental health issues are covered by it. If you are covered by it, I would suggest that you go see someone.<br>  <br>  Most colleges also have people on-campus who are trained to deal with these sorts of things. If you don't feel comfortable asking around for information, you should try looking it up on your college website.<br>  <br>  Also, I think you should muster the courage to ask them first though. If they will not support you, then you'll have to find help your own way. It's better to tell your parents that you are dealing with depression than it is to tell them that you've been hurting yourself or that you're failing all of your classes because you cannot bring yourself to go to them.<br>  Issues are best dealt with when you recognize them.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|WlvBZsqSaa	I'm in a very similar situation.<br>  Im currently as college and suffering from really bad depression amongst other things. The syptoms you describe i can associate with very well - in fact im not in college today either.<br>  My is a high achiever and doesn't recognise mental illness, i was a straight A student prior to the depression and now he just thinks im a lazy waste of space and this 'depression' is a cop-out. It hurts but luckily my mum is sort of supportive.<br>  The best thing you can do is go into college and go and find your personal tutor if you have one, the college nurse, counsellor or anyone you trust and believe me it WILL help. They will put you in touch with the right people to help you and because they are aware of the situation you won't get in trouble for missing college.<br>  Alternatively you could go and see your GP, they are likely to refer you to a psycologist. This referal often takes a while so ask you GP to write a letter to your college so they can be leniant on you. They could even write one to your parents so your parent would understand it was serious?<br>  Either way get help, at the very least it will stop you being kicked out of college and making your life a lot harder!<br>  Good luck keep strong <br>  x|`|w2bHPA7raa	i suffer from depression and to be honest this could just be an aftermath from the virus. with actual depression it is worse than what you have described. anyway tell your parents you are feeling down. i did and now i have got help. just sit ur mum/dad down (whoever your closer too) and tell them you have been feeling rreally down recently and you dont know why.|`|oIN5URfcaa	Your parent care about you,you should tell..you will feel better if you say out...don care if embarrass or not...you should not keep life secret from them. if they find out, you might hurt them more.|`|Aufx2ue0aa	If you really have a problem, just tell them. They won't laugh. They care about you.|`|D4iJLLpmaa	Some times after suffering from a virus it can take much longer to recover than you might expect and tiredness can be a part of this, tiredness can often lead to feeling a bit depressed. There are also certain viruses that are known to cause severe tiredness and clinical depression. If you don't think it's illness related and that maybe you were suffering from it before (did you really recover from your last episode, or did you just manage to get on with things regardless?) the illness but your general tiredness from being sick exacerbated it, maybe a little introspection may help you identify something that is causing you to feel this way. Like problems at school or with your friends, maybe problems within your family or with yourself? Something you might be able to work towards fixing? Of course, it may not even have an external cause. Whatever the reason, you really, really should speak to your parents, and your doctor. Things like depression should not be ignored.<br>  <br>  I don't think they will laugh, though they may not understand and therefore be dismissive. Try and understand that if this happens it doesn't mean they don't love you or don't care. If you feel able, try and prepare everything you want to say in your head before you talk to them, and try and anticipate some of their questions so you have answers ready and don't panic. I'm assuming they love you, and you love them so everything will work out, try not to fret too much. If it weren't for my family, I don't know what mess I might be in after a post illness bout of depression and anxiety. I didn’t plan speaking to them though, I just cried a lot and I was being irrational about my illness and everything.<br>  <br>  Also, if you aren't suffering from full blown clinical depression (which is different from just feeling a bit depressed), going back to school may help snap you out of it. It might be worth a try for a few days. Meet your friends and get back into a routine, it's not easy to consider it when you are currently feeling down but really try and think about it, ok :)<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, and I really hope you start to feel on top of things again soon. I understand how hard it can be, but there is, more times than not, and end in sight. So try not to get yourself down even more by worrying over how down you feel right now or how your parents and doctor will react, I know it's easier said than done, but try any way!<br>  <br>  Please make sure you talk to some one! <- Can’t stress this enough.
ahjqc9Ifaa	I've never heard that, John, and I went to an ophthalmologist two weeks ago for eye problems related to extensive computer use. As a medical doctor, if this were a possibility, I assume he'd have asked about that or warned me about that.<br>  <br>  More common is dry eyes (which I had) and eye strain (which I also had).

First thing, I'd say that checking with your doctor would be the easiest thing in the world to do to get it all sorted out. As I understand it, birth control pills do occasionally have side effects, including nausea and your other symptoms. Talking to your doctor can help you figure out what is happening, and he can possibly help to adjust your prescription to better suit your needs.<br>  Some of my friends had unwanted side effects when they began using birth control. Some of them didn't want to put up with the side effects, and had to stop using them, others simply had some changes in their prescription and better information on what to expect, and they were fine. So talk to your doctor, it's probably the best way to go to give you some peace of mind!|`|RrgQUT5vaa	It doesn't sound like you are, but a doctor can do a blood test for it.
sYxtPBziaa	humidity maybe? lol. the world IS sort of in an economic crysis.... maybe they are cutting back.|`|ItJzrvQ4aa	go to the nearest to you farmers' market. In the supermarkets, they  buy in bulk and sell off these huge farming factories which use fertilisers and chemicals to make their products look attractive. They use a lot of pesticides, then they cover their products with wax or some other chemical to make it look attractive, and even add dye.  Real vegetables and fruit are not that shiny, glistening, and intensive coloured. Small farmers do use chemicals to some extent, but not as much as huge corporations. Look for signs of worms tunnels, little dark spots on the things you buy - they are normal and indicate that the product was more or less natural when grown.
Zg4Wfjnnaa	my guess is, it enhances all senses and makes EVERYTHING better (sleep, shower, sex, walks, music, terrible sitcoms, id say nature, but nature doesnt need enhancing. its already amazing).<br>  so sure youll probably get hungry, but after that first bite.. theres no stopping.<br>  i learnt a way to cope with this. eat before.

I would go eat lots of yummy junk food, but only because everyone else with their supposed munchies wanted it.|`|xgrNAwa1aa	I agree that it sticks to brain receptors like the THC does. <br>  I only feel that Cannabis should be used medicinally and it does have many benefits. <br>  After being in chronic pain for a decade and the fact that I used to smoke it socially I can see both sides. I no longer smoke near as much as I found it doesn't help with the pain if I try to over use it or use it to get a high from it. Because of chronic pain 24/7 I would hardly ever eat if I didn't use this for a medical drug. It has also kept me from any increases in pain medications for 9 of the 10 years that I've been disabled.<br>  One day it should be legalized the same as tobacco and alcohol. I feel those two things are far worse for health than smoking small amounts of cannabis and nobody dies from it. There has never been any proof that any person has died from using this plant that has been labeled a "narcotic substance" equal to cocaine and heroin. Because the DEA put it in that class is the reason I believe people are willing to try the other two drugs that are very dangerous if they see it is in the same class as cannabis. <br>  If this plant had been found in only the past 20 years, it would be considered a miracle drug. Our government has had us in prohibition for far too long.

AA10074302	Below is information from the Lung Cancer Alliance Web site.  If you visit the site you can find answers to a lot of your questions.  <br>  <br>  You already know that you need to stop smoking.  Please go to your doctor for a complete check-up since it is probably something else due to your age.  <br>  <br>  Also, find support to stop smoking.  It is not going to be easy and you will need all the support you can get.  Plus, you will probably gain some weight, so keep reading.<br>  <br>  I would suggest--after you talk to your doctor--to take up walking/running and maybe even competitive walking/running.  You may be surprised that it might be easier to stop smoking when you are around athletes.  <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck.  Again, please see a doctor.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...<br>  <br>  Symptoms<br>  <br>  Symptoms of lung cancer vary depending on the type, location, and size of the tumor. Many people with lung cancer have no symptoms until the disease has advanced into late stages. Some lung cancer symptoms are similar to those of other common illnesses. Advise your physician of your medical and social history at each physical examination to assist in a prompt and accurate diagnosis. <br>  <br>  When lung cancer does cause symptoms, they can include the following: <br>  <br>  Coughing (most common) <br>  Shortness of breath (dyspnea) <br>  Fatigue <br>  Wheezing <br>  Pain in the chest, shoulder, upper back, or arm <br>  Coughing up blood (hemoptysis) <br>  Repeated pneumonia or bronchitis <br>  Loss of appetite (anorexia) and weight loss <br>  General pain <br>  Hoarseness <br>  Swelling of face or neck <br>  Pleural effusion <br>  Some symptoms occur when the cancer spreads to other parts of the body. This spread is referred to as metastasis. Lung cancer can metastasize to the liver, the brain or the bones. <br>  <br>  Symptoms for metastases can include the following: <br>  <br>  Brain: <br>  <br>  Headaches <br>  Seizures <br>  Nausea <br>  Vomiting <br>  Weakness <br>  Liver: <br>  <br>  Stomach pain (right side) <br>  Jaundice <br>  Bone:<br>  <br>  Bone pain|`|AA10834046	You need to do two things.<br>  <br>  Go to the doctor and quit smoking.|`|u7Y1SAViaa	Shouldn't be smoking in the first place. go see a doctor.

mxixfE3Raa	To tone yourself you need to do what is strength training AND a cardio workout.<br>  Your workout regime should consist of about 350 cardio minutes each week. So anything like workout videos or running. It just has to get your heart pumping so anything where you're moving alot. I find exercise videos the best and they're least boring. Cardio is what burns fat.<br>  You also have to go any sort of strength training every other day. This would be lifting weights, sit ups, stomach crunches. Basically anything which burns your muscles but you're heart doesn't pump as much. This is the part that tones your body. But will only work if you do cardio workouts during the week aswell. You need to do this every other day, and not every day, because it allows your muscles to heal and develop properly.<br>  <br>  <br>  In terms of what you eat you really need to count the following nutritional values of as much of the food you eat as you can: -Calories -Protein -Fat and -Carbohydrates.<br>  These are the four key things. To lose weight and tone your body you need to eat around these amounts.<br>  1200-1500 calories.<br>  160g-240g of carbohydrates.<br>  30g-60g of fat.<br>  60-120g of protein.<br>  Also another tip is to eat less as you go furthur through the day. So basically you should have a large breakfast, medium lunch and small dinner.<br>  This allows the activities you do during the day to burn the most possible fat. Say if you exercise around lunch time, then go and have a big dinner, you're still going to store the fat from the dinner until the next day. <br>  <br>  You also should monitor your weight loss every week. Your body will tone more and more every day, but you won't notice it for about a month.<br>  It's really hard to keep to routine, so if you weigh yourself every week, then you will see that you've lost weight and stay motivated, whereas if you look in the mirror every week you might not notice much of a difference and this might make you want to give up.<br>  People will start to notice your body being more toned after you've lost about 10-15lbs. Which can be achieved anything between a month and two months. You should also measure your waist and hips every week. As you go through your toning journey you might notice the weight doesn't come off as quick, but this is because your muscle is replacing the fat and muscle weighs more than fat, but takes up less room. So if you don't notice it on the scales you may notice it on the tape measure.<br>  <br>  If you're planning on keeping the routine up for more than a month, then you should know that you need to decrease your nutrition intakes for every 10lbs you lose. This is because as your body gets smaller and more toned, it will need less food, so after a month you should reduce your calorie intake to between 1150 - 1400. And reduce carbs, fat and protein by about 5 or 10. If you don't do this your body will just stay at the same weight as it will be used to the amounts you're eating.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|AA10424307	If you're playing tennis "most other days" along with a daily hour workout with weights (never mind the netball!) you've got more time and devotion than most of us out here in the real world.<br>  If you're seeking more "tone," I would suggest cutting back on the tennis and gradually adding some weights or time to those workouts.  The tone you seek will likely come from spot and/or cross-training. Good old fashioned crunches, sit-ups etc., should not be overlooked.<br>  PS: Be sure you're eating enuf protein in the form of lean and/or dairy foods/fish and beans, etc. All that training needs muscle food for repair!|`|09d461a4e198710cc68d9d9cb7bdbe41aa	It usually takes 3 to 4 months to see a significant difference in muscle tone if you are working with weights.|`|VSB98koJaa	Are we looking at muscle tone here, or muscle size ?

You need to have some carbs, COMPLEX carbs like rice and fruit. <br>  I lost weight when I had an Akins shake for breakfast and dinner, and salad & sushi OR a foot-long sub sandwich for lunch. Once a day I would have a piece of fruit. I worked out for at least 30 min at night, and went to bed hungry, but I lost 20lbs in 6 weeks. Except for trying to go to sleep on a hungry stomach, I felt very good and energetic all day, every day! <br>  I also had a couple cups of black coffee and sometimes a beer at night if I went on a long, grueling hike. :)<br>  <br>  Now I'm pregnant so I have to eat differently, and also give up coffee and beer....and sushi, and THAT hurts.

Fasting does mean that you shouldn't eat anything 12 hours before they do the test.  Usually drinking water and sometimes they will tell you other liquids is okay.  I have eaten before and not had weird test results.  If they think that it could have affected your results then they may want to do the test again and in this case may tell you to take a different pain medication or to take it with a certain type of food.|`|Y9eSvxzQaa	I had to get blood work with fasting.  I ate something at around twelve b/c I forgot but everything turned out fine.  If you feel more comfortable tell the nurse when you go.|`|GQRs83Haaa	I'm not sure if you screw it up... just be sure to let them know.|`|mxLzqEUQaa	BY "fasting blood test", they mean that they DON'T want you eating anything after 8- 10 hours before the time your blood is going to be drawn. If your blood is being drawn at 10:00am, then NO you DO NOT eat anything after midnight. Anything you eat after that time IS going to affect your testing. You are messing up your Glucose (sugar tolerance level), which is why you are fasting. The same thing goes for anything that you may drink, except for water, which is allowed. They do not want you to dehydrate. And WHAT meds are you taking? Are these medications that you are already taking under prescription by your doctor and the nurse knows about them? Or are they over the counter medications? Either way your doctor and nurse should know about them before your testing. If you ate or drank anything other than water within 10 hours before your blood is to be drawn, see if the test can wait that little longer untill you have waited long enough. The food you ate breaks down into sugar and it will affect your test if you ate it too late, raising the level of sugar in your blood stream.

I can relate because I too was diagnosed however I was 30 when I was diagnosed.  My doc has tried all non-stimulant meds first like strattera and that didn't work for me.

I am now able to follow through with tasks and just normal everyday things that people who do not suffer from add and adhd can do that we have a hard time doing.  He owes it to himself to at least try a couple different treatment options.  Side effects are different for each person.  Weight loss was the biggest for me taking the adderall.  Other than that the side effects were very minimal.  I go to a psychologist twice a month as well as seeing my reg doc once a month.  My doc suggested finding a therapist to help with the struggles that we face on a day to day basis.  I hope this helps and just remember to encourage him as much as you can.  Good luck, Barb
kynzqmWgaa	Ask someone to tie you to your bed just before you fall asleep.|`|dbCkTKDxaa	well the reason why people sleepwalk is something there is something bothering them really bad. or there in a lot of stress so to stop you need to find out why you do like if something borthing you or stress|`|mlAwNRWhaa	hhhmmm...<br>  <br>  Treatment for sleepwalking is often unnecessary, especially if episodes are infrequent and uncomplicated. Safety issues are of prime importance to someone who sleepwalks and to others who are involved with managing the condition. The following measures are usually recommended:<br>  <br>  Locate the bedroom on the main floor, if possible. <br>  Place an alarm or a bell on the door of the bedroom. <br>  Lock the windows and cover them with large, heavy drapes. <br>  Keep the floor clear of harmful objects. <br>  Remove any hazardous materials and sharp objects from the room and secure them in the house. <br>  Stay on the first floor when visiting others and when sleeping at a hotel.<br>  <br>  Many sleepwalkers claim the first step in management is to recognize that sleepwalking is not evidence of insanity. Because sleepwalking is an involuntary behavior, it separates people from most of the general public and is often wrongly associated with madness. As mysterious as its occurrence is, it does not indicate mental dysfunction and should not be treated as such.|`|1ju5oDgMaa	haha that's kind of funny =] well that doesn't normally happens.

3oZKFjBQaa	Tension headaches are usually in one spot. I get them on the top right side of my head right above my eye. I don't know why they are like that. Maybe that blood vessel is really constricted. Just take Aleve not Tylenol because Tylenol doesn't work. Aleve is an anti-inflammatory which helps stop the swelling of the blood vessels that cause your headaches. Hope this helps.|`|vIw47BEFaa	Neurological. Left sided congestive  headaches of nerve involvement have an element of circulation problem.  eye, nape of neck, spine, occiput are the areas probably involved.  One single dose of Spigelia 30 can abort these types of  headaches.  <br>  <br>       Arnica 30 used for a period of time can be curative. Both the medicines are curative in circulatory disorders. Cocculus Indicus 30 or Rhus Tox 1M would be helpful in case nape of neck,occiput, spine, eyes  and bones are involved.  It is adviseable to see a doctor to find out the cause of the periodic headache before any treatment is tried.<br>  <br>  Medicine should be used in consultation with homeo doctor.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	It could also be sinus problems.  You don't say how long you've had this, except for saying, "always."

pvYy6iTSaa	Irishsweetie -  Perhaps by "hepah" you mean hepatic (liver) adenocarcinoma or a form of liver cancer.  As to what causes liver cancer, there are a number of risk factors, one of which is smoking.<br>  <br>  A risk factor is anything that affects a person's chance of getting a disease. Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors, such as smoking, can be controlled. Others, like a person's age or family history, can't be changed. But risk factors don't tell us everything. Having a risk factor, or even several, does not mean that a person will get cancer. And many people who get the disease don't have any known risk factors. <br>  <br>  There are some risk factors that make a person more likely to develop liver cancer. <br>  <br>  Gender: Men are more likely to get liver cancer than are women. This could be because of the behaviors listed below, such as smoking and alcohol abuse. <br>  <br>  Race/ethnicity: In the United States, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have the highest rates of liver cancer, followed by American Indians/Alaska Natives and Hispanics/Latinos, African Americans, and whites. <br>  <br>  Certain types of liver disease: The most common risk factor for liver cancer is infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). These infections lead to cirrhosis and are common in many parts of the world. In this country, hepatitis C is the most common cause of liver cancer, while in other countries, hepatitis B is more common. These viruses are spread from person to person through sharing dirty needles (such as in drug use), unprotected sex, or childbirth. They can also be passed on through blood transfusions. This is rare in the United States because blood products are now tested for these viruses. People with hepatitis A infection do not have an increased risk of liver cancer. <br>  <br>  There are also some inherited liver diseases that increase the risk of liver cancer. <br>  <br>  Cirrhosis: Cirrhosis is a disease in which liver cells are damaged and replaced with scar tissue. This can often lead to cancer. In this country, the major causes of liver cirrhosis are alcohol abuse and hepatitis B and C. Another cause is a disease (called hemachromatosis) that results in too much iron in the liver. Some other rare diseases can cause cirrhosis, too. <br>  <br>  Diabetes: Diabetes can increase the risk of liver cancer. This is more common in diabetics who have other risk factors such as heavy drinking and/or hepatitis. <br>  <br>  Obesity: Being very overweight might increase the risk of getting liver cancer. <br>  <br>  Aflatoxins: These cancer-causing substances are made by a fungus that can get into peanuts, wheat, soybeans, groundnuts, corn, and rice. Long-term exposure to aflatoxins can increase the risk of liver cancer. In the United States and Europe, these foods are tested for aflatoxins. <br>  <br>  Vinyl chloride and thorium dioxide (Thorotrast): These chemicals are risk factors for some types of liver cancer. They have become much less important since Thorotrast is no longer used and exposure to vinyl chloride is strictly controlled. <br>  <br>  Anabolic steroids: These male hormones are used by some athletes to increase their strength. Long-term use of these can slightly increase the risk of liver cancer. <br>  <br>  Arsenic: In some parts of the world, drinking water is contaminated with arsenic, which increases the risk of liver cancer. This is a concern in some areas of the United States. <br>  <br>  Less certain risk factors for liver cancer <br>  <br>  Birth control pills: Birth control pills may slightly increase the risk of liver cancer. Most of the studies linking birth control pills and cancer involve types of pills that are no longer used. Birth control pills are now made in a different way, and it is not known if the newer ones increase liver cancer risk. <br>  <br>  Tobacco: Some studies have found a link between smoking and liver cancer, but the extent of this is not known.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	some cancers are from a virus. i don't know the etiology of this one.  I'm so sorry you lost your mom. I did too when I was 17. She was only 56, and died of lung cancer that metastasized. She did not smoke, but grew up in a war zone.
2ikOe4tLaa	the question my friend should not be how to commit painless suicide.<br>  it should be why do you want to commit suicide?<br>  <br>  do you think you are all alone? you are not!<br>  do you think life is so terrible for you? why? - people are starving in the world and have no homes, you have a gift, you probably have a good life, maybe an average life, but so do i - make the most of it.<br>  <br>  are you thinking about your friends and family?<br>  maybe you think that when you die, things will be ok, the pain will go away?<br>  but what about the pain you will cause your parents, brother, sisters, friends?<br>  they have to live everyday with the pain of your death, they will forever think that it was their fault - why would you want to do that to someone?<br>  <br>  talk to your friends, parents, someone you can trust to keep a secret - suicide should not be an option. if life is so bad, just get up and leave, go away, meet some new people, make new friends, travel around the world.<br>  i live in ireland, come and meet me and i will buy you a pint of beer :-)|`|rjvtvTTYaa	U need 2 seek help immediately.   It is not easy, I have 22 years of doing this on and off.  U need 2 go 2 mental health,  and possibly be admitted 2 get u stabilized.  Don't worry about any1 there they will drug u up so much u don't care and then begin 2 work on helping u.  Don't worry about what friends and family think,  they'll be much happier that u got help instead of attending your funeral.  It is a very selfish act and the people left behind will NEVER understand and will grieve terribly.  I know,  my mother killed herself when I was 3 and my brother did this past spring.  There is no foolproof way 2 do it painlessly,  I speak from experience.|`|22C72ZlRaa	DON'T DO IT.  I tried to kill myself several times.  The guilt and the hurt and the shame have damaged my family.  I've been depressed and on the meds for 5 yrs.  I think part of it it's cos of the meds I've been taking.  They make me feel suicidal as soon as I wake up.  My GP told me not to stop but hey ho.. I've weened it off and now I'm drugs free (for a week now).  I was on Risperidone and Sertraline. I used to be on Prozac - the happy pill but after I tried to kill myself, my psychiatrist changed the meds for me.  I know every drug has side effects (suicidal thoughts) well drug should help you to stay alive not to want to kill yourself. So that's why I stopped the meds. It might not  be a good idea but I give it a try.|`|emIOmj8daa	listen to songs of Phil collins...ull die instantly|`|67ea71af780ce95553f2ddb1eddee690aa	Such a cry for help huh? Did you know that just about every successful suicide was carried out because the people who were truly in despair didn't ask anyone how to do it or discuss it with anyone beforehand?<br>  <br>  Instead of posting here, go turn yourself in to the nearest crisis center if you're truly considering killing yourself...|`|VSWl45cKaa	You need help but not to commit suicide. Besides counseling someone to do this via Internet can be a criminal offense. Someone in Minnesota is under investigation (and may be charged) for doing just that to a freshman female student at a university in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. <br>  <br>  Look at this website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/suicide/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/suicide/</a><br>  <br>  and use resources in the area where you live to get the correct kind of help you obviously need.|`|DS2huIAkaa	Pushing the very idea out of your mind is the best way to painlessly "kill off" that depressed part of yourself. I am sure that the stronger part of you, the one that went to the trouble to write this question, the one that quite sensibly wants to avoid pain, is strong enough to ignore the depressed part till it withers away.<br>  <br>  I am not quoting religion to you. I am not reminding you of responsibility to others. I am just reminding you of your responsibility to the stronger part of YOU.|`|yHHdAMnQaa	seek help, you may think suicide is the only choice, but it is not. get some help from a psychiatrist. in the past i was thinking like you but now after i got some real help and nearly fully recover. i thought it was a stupid idea.

xNBFsEnsaa	Well generally no muscle aches and spasms are usually a sign of over working the muscles. In this case you should dial it down on your work out routine. But these symptoms can be associated with muscle atrophy to. In which case you should talk to your doctor about how best to deal with your muscle atrophy. In any case you should take some pain killers to take the pain down a little bit.
kyTDQEWaaa	Sleep paralysis.   It happens between stages of sleep, just when you're waking.  Its freaky.  But there's nothing wrong with you.|`|8290750de398a0cfad0df45a64d531c3aa	who was at your door?|`|lSqb7Fraaa	that has happened to me before it completely freaked me out. you mustve been concious but your body still in sleep mode.  our bodies muscles tend to become paralyze during a certain stage of our sleep.
ZbMLigR3aa	Hon, two pills depending on the dosage and medication type can interfere with function for up to 24 hours (or sometimes more). It is all up to his tolerance level and metabolism.   If those pills are too strong for him, have him contact his doctor to adjust the dosage.  I hope he feels better soon.  Good luck!|`|kv5lGrSdaa	Yeah it was probably was the pain killers. Because he was laying down asleep the medicine probably settled. Having settled it made the medicine take longer to dissolve and fade away. I have taken pain killers at 9am and still felt the side effects until 5pm. It just depends on the person and the dosage. Everybody reacts to medications differently. I don't think you have anything to worry about as far as you described.
mlAwNRWhaa	Yeah, you can, and it's good too. Cause most colds are harmless and beyond your body’s reaction to it, Fever and the like, doesn't hurt you much. <br>  <br>  If you can get 2 or 3 over in one spell, it sure beats getting each one on it's own over a longer period of time. <br>  <br>  Yes. It's common. It makes sense that if one weakens you another will get you.
IiHTk7ZHaa	First thing you should do:<br>  <br>  NO CANDY I don't care how addicted you are to it.<br>  Bacteria feed on sugar. That makes the situation a lot worse.<br>  <br>  NO MILK. Milk overload in the system causes a sore throat and then you can't swallow (I have that issue, I have allergy to milk and I know how bad it gets) <br>  <br>  Salty food is ok, but do your best to have neutral food, like all day on water and plain rice or bread.<br>  <br>  Spicy food is desirable.<br>  <br>  Try something like Strepsils or something for the throat or if you have some soda around the house it might help with something fizzy to go down your throat, it eats away the layer where the tonsils are. Might not be very effective depending on how bad it is for you, but I find it sometimes works.<br>  <br>  Try a different doctor. <br>  <br>  Don't talk and avoid coughing and doing anything that might irritate and worsen the situation. <br>  <br>  Take some alcohol and put it on a cloth and place it on your throat. Take some garlic and rub it on your feet. (Yes, feet) Gets rid of the fever and also good for the body's stability overall.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	You have classic symptoms of the flu.<br>  <br>  There really isn't much that they can do and by going out, you're spreading the virus around for others to catch.  Unless your fever gets up to around 104, you should just take it easy and keep those fluids going in.  It's amazing how much it helps.  Be sure to take aspirin and acetaminophen, but don't take too many acetaminophen at once.<br>  <br>  I think the best remedy for flu is a prescription for four or five Tylenol threes.  It helps the pain and lets you sleep.  I don't know why they don't routinely prescribe it for the pain of flu.  If you can lay your hands on a couple or a couple of Vicodin, take one and get some rest.|`|1ju5oDgMaa	the same is happening to me right now. i think i got a bad cold or something. well what you can do is still take the medicine. If you feel worse,, then go back =)<br>  HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER!<br>  <br>  best wishes.|`|qZINunh7aa	go to the doctor ASAP!|`|Ks1uiHReaa	ugh could be mono, thats how bad my throat was when I had it!

I found out later that that sputum is that yellow crap you're  <br>         coughing up.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Colds Symptoms<br>  The most common complaints associated with the cold usually are mild and can be managed with over-the-counter cold medications you can buy at a drugstore or grocery store:<br>  <br>  Runny nose <br>  Sneezing <br>  Nasal and sinus blockage <br>  Headache <br>  Sore throat <br>  Cough <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Sore Throat - Topic Overview<br>  Sore throats can be painful and annoying. Fortunately, most sore throats are caused by a minor illness and go away without medical treatment. <br>  <br>  Several conditions can cause a sore throat.<br>  <br>  Viral infections<br>  Many sore throats are caused by a viral illness, such as:<br>  <br>  The common cold, the most common type of viral infection. <br>  Infection of the voice box (laryngitis) <br>  Mononucleosis (mono, "the kissing disease"), a viral infection that tends to cause a persistent sore throat. <br>  Other viral infections, such as mumps, herpangina, or influenza. <br>  Bacterial infections<br>  A bacterial infection may also cause a sore throat. This can occur from:<br>  <br>  Strep throat, which usually does not occur with congestion or a cough. <br>  An inflammation or infection of the tonsils (tonsillitis) and sometimes the adenoids (adenoiditis). <br>  Inflammation of the epiglottis (epiglottitis). <br>  Inflammation of the uvula (uvulitis). <br>  In rare cases, a sexually transmitted disease (STD), such as gonorrhea or chlamydia. If you have engaged in high-risk sexual behavior, consider whether gonorrhea or chlamydia may be present. For more information, see the topic Exposure to Sexually Transmitted Diseases. <br>  Irritants and injuries<br>  A sore throat that lasts longer than a week is often caused by irritants or an injuries, such as:<br>  <br>  Throat irritation from low humidity, smoking, air pollution, yelling, or nasal drainage down the back of the throat (postnasal drip). <br>  Breathing through the mouth when you have allergies or a stuffy nose. <br>  Stomach acid that backs up into the throat, which may be a symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Although this often occurs with heartburn, an acid taste in the mouth, or a cough, sometimes a sore throat is the only symptom. <br>  An injury to the back of the throat, such as a cut or puncture from falling with a pointed object in the mouth. <br>  Chronic fatigue syndrome, a condition that causes extreme tiredness. <br>  Treatment for a sore throat depends on the cause. You may be able to use home treatment to obtain relief.<br>  <br>  Because viral illnesses are the most common cause of a sore throat, it is important not to use antibiotics to treat them. Antibiotics do not alter the course of viral infections. Unnecessary use of an antibiotic exposes you to the risks of an allergic reaction and antibiotic side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, and yeast infections. Antibiotics also may kill beneficial bacteria and encourage the development of dangerous antibiotic-resistant bacteria.<br>  <br>  Review the Emergencies and Check Your Symptoms sections to determine if and when you need to see a doctor.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  What is bronchitis? <br>  <br>  Bronchitis means that the tubes that carry air to the lungs (the bronchial tubes) are inflamed and irritated. When this happens, the tubes swell and produce mucus. This makes you cough.<br>  <br>  There are two types of bronchitis:<br>  <br>  Acute bronchitis usually comes on quickly and gets better after 2 to 3 weeks. Most healthy people who get acute bronchitis get better without any problems. See a picture of acute bronchitis. <br>  Chronic bronchitis keeps coming back and can last a long time, especially in people who smoke. Chronic bronchitis means you have a cough with mucus most days of the month for 3 months of the year for at least 2 years in a row. <br>  This topic focuses on acute bronchitis. Both children and adults can get acute bronchitis.<br>  <br>  What causes acute bronchitis? <br>  <br>  Acute bronchitis is usually caused by a virus. Often a person gets acute bronchitis after having an upper respiratory tract infection such as a cold or the flu. In rare cases, acute bronchitis is caused by bacteria.<br>  <br>  Acute bronchitis also can be caused by breathing in things that irritate the bronchial tubes, such as smoke. It also can happen if a person inhales food or vomit into the lungs.<br>  <br>  What are the symptoms? <br>  <br>  The most common symptom of acute bronchitis is a cough that is dry and hacking at first. After a few days, the cough may bring up mucus. You may have a low fever and feel tired.<br>  <br>  Acute bronchitis symptoms usually start 3 or 4 days after an upper respiratory tract infection.

Your  friend  might be able to go on disability. The primary reason most people wind up on disability  who have MS is because the exhaustion the disease causes renders them unable to work.  Neurologists also rate people on a scale that determines the extent of their physical disability. MS effects the emotions and cognition as well as physical function.  Many people with MS have mild cases and continue working. Truth is that many of us with MS live very normal lives. The majority of us have what is referred to as relapsing/remitting MS meaning that the disease goes into remission and then is followed by a relapse at some point in time. Plenty of people have an attack of MS and then go on to feel relatively good for decades. However, there are progressive forms of the disease  which can cause  disability within a very short time. <br>  <br>     When I had my first attack of MS, I went blind in one eye. and could barely walk. My decision making ability was totally worthless and I could not remember what I did from one day to the next. Within months every sympton went away. My vision returned and so did  all of my abilities. To this day no one ever guesses that I have a disease. <br>   <br>       At this  point  your friend's neurologist probably does not know whether your friend has a progressive form of the disease or the relapsing remitting type. MS is also very unpredictable. You just never know what is going to happen. Life could turn out to be a peach or a living hell. Fortunately the former not the latter is usually the case. MS usually does not become totally disabling until decades and decades have elapsed.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Depends on how bad it is.  Some MS is very slight, other times its more crippling.
AA10424307	If it was my child, I would take her to a really Good shoe store or running/sports clinic and ask people who know these problems very well.<br>  A torn AT and her preference for gymnastics are both great reasons for her to have medical opinions-- possibly a podiatrist or foot doctor visit would provide her with ORTHOTICS she could wear with various shoes. Custom Orthotics can prevent re-injury as well as support those weak ankles with the right choice of footwear.|`|w9LOTXXxaa	Get some high tops to support the ankle!<br>  <br>  and make sure there done up properly if there loose at the to they wont help at all!!!
x8A8DnpPaa	Almost certainly bad.  Are you depressed?|`|CvBJ3RKPaa	I doubt that it's physically unhealthy, but sleeping that much is sometimes indicates depression.  Isn't there something else you rather do with your life than sleep it away?|`|QQlbvWj4aa	Yes, there is.  It can cause a lot of health problems, you should definitely see a doctor about resetting your sleep cycle.|`|GQRs83Haaa	The time you gave is 10-12 hours. Not 14-16 hours.<br>  <br>  Yes there is such thing as too much sleep. Your body needs 5-8 hours. Anymore isn't good just as any less isn't.<br>  <br>  When I was depressed... I slept at least 10 hours a day... but usually around 16 hours. Around 1 am to about 5 pm. Try to get over what's bothering you... make yourself happy! If that doesn't work then I guess you should see a doctor. <br>  <br>  They could probably give you meds for depression (if that's it). It could be a medical problem, too. So definitely let them know.|`|Hxa0GcI3aa	That's not good,how do you seem when you're awake?(apart from awake)
TqRh1y2Waa	If you want to lose it and keep it off, do it slowly and surely. Give yourself at least 6 months of disciplined exercise and controlled eating. If you don't exercise at all, start gradually. If you already are fairly active, increase the time and level of activity. Walk, swim, learn yoga or qi gong, bike, go to the gym. Make the whole project fun. When you hit a 5-lb mark (5, 10, 15, and 20) reward yourself with something not related to food. A new outfit. A book. A massage. A good haircut.|`|h4x4oqVzaa	This new calorie shifting diet I'm currently on has worked tremendously for me. I started losing weight the very first week. So far I've lost 14.4 lbs. in 5 weeks with this diet! I'm doing a little exercising but not too much. It shows you exactly what to eat and when to eat it. It gives you a choice of foods and it prepares an 11-day menu for you. The trick is in the types of calories you eat and when you eat them. By shifting your calories you can boost your metabolism to burn more fat.

There aren't any symptoms within a month of infection. I'm pretty sure that muscle aches (as well as all the other illnesses you listed)  wouldn't even be a symptom if you were infected. Anyways, the only thing you can probably do is get an HIV test. You're supposed to wait at least 3 weeks to get tested from the date of the encounter - and if it was last month you should be in the clear. It can be scary, but think of how good you'll feel when you actually know! The primary test is called an ELISA test, and it shouldn't be too expensive.|`|vrPDbUkVaa	theres no way to know hun!<br>  make a doctors appointment & see.<br>  <br>  dont be so hard on yourself either, everyone make mistakes! and thats how you learn in life, by your mistakes.<br>  <br>  best of luck.<br>  xox
7sA8HwTzaa	Yes, take them ever four hours for at least a week.  After that, try to go back to your small break between doses.  Try this every week, til you find relief.  I would also see if you can't gradually reduce the dosage to help reduce the chemical dependency that has probably been created.|`|AA10478980	I am answering from the perspective of what we needed to do when my late husband was having a lot of pain from cancer.  The pain management team were very definite that it was important to keep the pain under control, and to not wait for the pain before taking the medication.  If you know that the pain will continue for a while, take the medication on a regular basis before the pain starts.  If you allow the pain to come to the surface, it takes more medication to get it under control than to keep it under control.|`|gUxHXhjTaa	For the first 4 times every 4 hours. After that as needed.

I have always been told that you should keep taking them so that you can keep the pain from getting bad.  Once it gets bad its harder to get under control.  My mother had her knee replaced and her doctor told her not to be brave and just keep taking the pain medication on time for the first 8 weeks and then she could lower her dose to see if she could deal.  I think if there is pain medication out there to take why not take it and stay comfie.  Good luck.|`|ByxEE8eeaa	Take it as recommended rather than waiting for the pain. That way you don't need to wait for it to kick in. If you're worried about taking it too often, gradually increase the time between doses until you get to the point where you have minimal pain between doses, yet maximum time between your pills. Happy recovering!|`|VnCVkHDhaa	You need to take them every 4 hours to for them to work effectivly other wise they will become inafective, there are medical reasons not to take them before 4 hours possibly because the lingering effects of the previous pain killer can create the effects of an overdose, but the chances are small, in the end you should take note of medical advice.|`|1ju5oDgMaa	It depends how bad it hurts you.

b876bdbe9593c6e05de8ebd41f870433aa	I've had both hips replaced.  The reason was that I had severe advanced osteoarthritis and was no longer able to walk without a cane nor was I able to do my job satisfactorily.

BUI2nlUVaa	It could be any number of auto immune diseases as this is what an ANA tests for.  It is non specific.  RA has a specific test that most people test positive for when they have RA.  However, there are people who test negative that actually have RA.  Additionally, about 5% of the population tests positive for ANA without actually having anything.  Your mother may fall into this category.  <br>  <br>  The real question is what kind of joint pain is she having.  Is the area red, swollen and bilateral?  Or is the joint pain in areas that really do not have much of an outward sign?  What other tests has she had done, ie. has she had a complete Lupus Panel?  (people with Lupus actually only test positive for the Lupus panel 30% of the time).  <br>  <br>  A diagnosis is made with both lab work and symptoms/physical examination and patient history.  It can be very difficult.  Additionally, it could be that she was tested at the beginning stages of a flare and that as she progresses she'll have more symptoms.  <br>  <br>  Most doctors would state that, now, barring any additional symptoms, they should take a 'wait and see' approach, unless any of her symptoms interfere with her lifestyle.  As far as the anemia goes they'll most likely treat it with iron.  <br>  <br>  I hope she is feeling better soon.
M3pRAe7Vaa	One reason for a delayed period is iron deficiency anemia.  If your body is low on iron, it will conserve what blood it does have, and not allow you to have a period.<br>  <br>  See your doctor and have your blood levels checked for hemoglobin, iron, B12, and other anemia related conditions.  This very well could be the cause.<br>  <br>  Also, don't rule out stress, as this can affect your cycle more profoundly that you would expect.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|ZbMLigR3aa	You don't say how old you are, that could make a difference in the answer here.  However, this could be a normal part of your cycle if you have recently just started getting your menstrual cycle.  If not, you will need to take this up with your doctor if it continues without resolution.  Take care.|`|FuY6X514aa	It could be something like PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome. I have had irregular periods, and it is due to PCOS. My doctor told me that it  is important if you are missing your period for more than 3 months to take something-birth control or progesterone to get your period. Missing your period is upsetting, but happens sometimes for other reasons like changes in diet or activity level or stress. If you have always had regular periods, and this is the first missed one, it may be just a fluke incident or it may be the beginning of irregular periods for you. Either way, it is something you should at some point talk to a doctor about. They can run some bloodwork and check hormone levels in your body to see if anything is abnormal...If you are younger, many doctors will prescribe birth control to help regulate your cycle.|`|ECvEknqtaa	how old r u? i really think you should go to your GP just to make sure your ok. i mean 5th jan this year is about a month and a week i think? i think u should get it checked out by a professional.<br>  gd luck!

My ideal session is to warm-up with yoga, do some stepping, and then go over to the Jillian game for a more challenging workout. <br>  <br>  Some people do not like Jillian since it is harder and clunkier in the beginning to use.  With practice and patience that can be overcome. She works muscle groups differently than the Wii Fit.  I was very sore after the first few uses and I am only doing the weight loss routine.

If you feel fine now, then it's probably over an done with, but if your nodes stay swollen for another day or if you start to feel feverish again, you should go to the doctor and see if he can't prescribe you an antibiotic.|`|QLopvWKDaa	Your body if fighting an infection and probably doing a great job of it!  <br>  <br>  You can help it along by resting, drinking lots of fluids and eating well.<br>  <br>  Of course, if the swelling continues or worsens- definitely, see a doctor.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Iar0ngMXaa	in all probability you have an infection somewhere and it is causing those nodes to swell up. Go to your dr and he will probably give you antibiotics to see if it will bring them down. If they dont go down he may want to at least do a biopsy on them or he may have them totally resected to check for things like cancer. even if it comes to him surgically removing them they still may not be cancer.

There is no reason why you shouldn't have an orgasm during sex unless you have a medical problem.  The other suggestions of using a silicone based lubricant are correct.  They tend to last longer.  You may also want to incorporate a vibrator into your routine.  Your partner can use it on your clitoris which may help you orgasm.  You didn't give us much info as to your sexual routine, so I strongly suggest you find some help into that area.  There are a million websites that aren't porn, they actually help.  (Right down to step by step "How To".<br>  By the way, sex in the shower rocks but you better have a big shower.  Otherwise the positions get awkward.

HcS8vzNCaa	First of all, at age nineteen, you have most likely reached your full adult height.  You may gain an inch or two yet, but the chances are that you won't grow any more.<br>  <br>  Even if you were younger, it is a myth that weightlifting stunts growth--unless you were to lift so much weight that the bones become more dense and close the epiphysis (the growth area of a long bone).  Only at that point would this possiblitiy arise.<br>  <br>  The American Academy of Pediatrics recently changed their minds about this issue.  "Strength training programs do not seem to adversely affect linear growth and do not seem to have any long-term detrimental effect on cardiovascular health."<br>  <br>  Lifting weights didn't do a thing to stunt the growth of Shaquille O'Neal, David Robinson, Karl Malone, Michael Vick, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Clint Eastwood.  All of them began lifting weights in their early teens.<br>  <br>  However, it is important for adolescents to not try to lift too much too early in their lives.  As long as they can do an exercise at least ten times or so, the weight they are lifting  is not excessive.  They should be properly supervised  by an adult too, so that they utilize proper form while lifting weights.<br>  <br>  At nineteen, you can lift without worrying about the growth factor.  Still, you should not try bulking up too much.   Focus instead on weights you can do repetitively, to build more functional muscles.<br>  <br>  Keep up the good work!|`|1AP5gVygaa	Hey dude, I started doing weights at about 18. I was 6ft1 then. I'm 21 now and over 6ft3 so that to me proves it does no harm. Just make sure that you do the right routine, eat correct nutrition and get proper rest and you'll be sorted. Also most people that start weights seem to think you have to do them just about every day. that is not true. I only do weights 2 times a week and I think I look ok.

It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|F8EnH6JQaa	TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  the first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your boy adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  If man made it, don't eat it<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  Walk your dog, or walk a friends dog<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

How about NO jump start?<br>  <br>  You didn't "gain" 5, 10 or more pounds by "jump starting" weight. It comes off more slowly than it goes ON. Any quick start is usually the result of losing "water weight" (fat has lots of water) and not of true weight loss.<br>  <br>  Instead, start Now by simply doing the most exercise you can do safely and easily. DON'T join a gym if you won't go. DON'T buy equipment you won't use! DON'T buy diet food, diet books or diet pills.<br>  <br>  Do buy decent tennis shoes/walking shoes/a cheap food scale/ and some multi-vitamins suitable for  your age.

Just do it (sorry, old NIKE line but it works)<br>  Put on the walking shoes and go outside for 20 minutes and walk somewhere.

I'm telling you this, and I know what I'm talking about.<br>  People who think that losing weight alone is healthy are WRONG on so many levels! When you decide to lose weight, <br>  <br>  you should lose the extra pounds safely and in a healthy way. You don't want to end up with anorexia, bulimia, or any <br>  <br>  other eating disorders because inorganic supplements disrupted your body's normal processes instead of helping it get <br>  <br>  back on the healthy track.<br>  <br>  The Acai Berry weight loss pill helps you avoid that because it's both safe and organic. Not only is this product <br>  <br>  popular with mothers who choose organic supplements for their family but is also greatly popular with international <br>  <br>  celebrities and the Brazilian people. It is also an easy way to give your children the daily nutrients they need.<br>  Now I'm not just saying this.<br>  The Acai berry is bursting with vital nutrients. It's consisted of 52.2 grams of carbohydrates, 8.1 grams of protein, <br>  <br>  and 44.2 grams of fiber forms for every 100 grams of the fruit's extract. It also has the highest antioxidant matter <br>  <br>  among organic and inorganic fruits alike.<br>  <br>  Best of all, it helps your body burn fat properly by speeding up your metabolism and improving your digestion and not <br>  <br>  by forcing your body to flush out whatever food you eat.<br>  <br>  So stop just thinking about it and take some massive action by ordering a free trial here: <a href="http://acaiberryselectformula.tk/" rel="nofollow">http://acaiberryselectformula.tk/</a>|`|3489c076a022e1d2b31875be5ea7c150aa	Eat less, move more - it's not that complicated.<br>  There's a billion $ industry out there - and it's all telling us what we know.

I started losing weight the very first week. So far I've lost 14.4 lbs. in 5 weeks with this diet!  I'm doing a little exercising but not too much.  You eat 4 meals a day and it shows you exactly what to eat and when to eat it. It gives you a choice of foods and it prepares an 11-day menu for you.  The trick is in the types of calories you eat and when you eat them.  By shifting your calories you can boost your metabolism to burn more fat.

Your last meal of the day should be protein based - lean chicken/fish etc. this helps you muscles recover and build. Go careful and good luck!
XRdOfOn6aa	It is not so much a "social life" question as a lifestyle question.<br>  It is a lifelong health issue that must be managed carefully. The person that has this must take their medications on time. They need to be careful not to overdo. They must take precautions not to get sick. If they get sick, they can get much sicker than others. They have to learn to manage with medications to adjust (stress dose) what other people's bodies do normally.<br>  Depending on the type he/she has, she may need more salt than the normal person and need to be hydrated. He/she may not have as much energy as everyone else. <br>  What is not a big deal for most people is a big deal for someone with CAH. Everything has to be planned around meds, hydration, rest, and making sure all is well. Adrenal crisis can be life threatening but yet one wants to have a normal life to the extent one can.
vIw47BEFaa	Heavy Weight lifting -yes you have a risk.<br>  Weight training - No.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	Depends on how old you are.    There is no reason to lift heavy weights until you're in college - lifting too much, or incorrectly, can adversely affect your growth plates.     Go see a personal trainer at any gym and ask him or her for a workout regimen for each muscle group using minimal or no weights.    Then go back two weeks later and get another set of different exercises for the same muscle groups.   Alternate exercises, working a different muscle group per day, and also run or swim - - - it's important to burn that fat off because if you have a thick layer of fat, nobody can see your muscles.|`|rU7ZjIHKaa	It depends on what stage of puberty you are. If you are mostly fully grown, you should not have a problem. This is the age most teenagers start lifting weights anyway. I have known some guys who started much earlier, before puberty hit them. Their growth was heavily stunted, but all they did was lift weights. It was borderline excessive.<br>  <br>  If you don't lift too much, that is, more than 3 times a week, and if you give your body enough time to recover, you shouldn't have any growth issues (don't lift when you are sore, and don't do heavy workouts 2 lifting days in a row. Also, don't work out a muscle group more than once a week, meaning a workout cycle would be something like: Moday: legs, Wednesday: Chest/arms, Friday: Back)<br>  <br>  I would talk to a trainer or someone with experience in this area, and they can start you on a good program.|`|mlAwNRWhaa	Not really...<br>  <br>  Physical activities will even increase your height even lifting...<br>  well, if you worry about it, and feel like it affects your height, take long sleep hours, balance diet... dont avoid fat so much for fat is needed... in fact, we should equal our fat, protein and some carbs...<br>  <br>  Again, physical activities will help you increase your height...<br>  <br>  and also as we all know, there is an age limit when it comes in increasing of height...<br>  <br>  you should have included your age in this question...

Low weights and high reps would be better I think.|`|VSB98koJaa	Not quite so simple a question as it sounds. It is possible to squash the soft bits that hold your spine together, but that will only have a modest effect on your height, but it may do a lot of damage to your spinal column.<br>  <br>  For a wider back and chest you do not need heavy weights, you need more reps on relatively light weights.|`|7y28j9BJaa	wait until 21 age or do Push Up.

My abs were ripped, but my food intake was moderate too.  It depends on what you put in your body.  At the gym I put 200 pounds on the universal machine and I would do 200 in a row between sets of three.  Hard work yes, but even old women at the beach were drooling, so I guess it worked great for me.  That was when I was thirty...I'm fifty now, and still hot according to my wife.|`|kFjNO9Yjaa	im female and i do 200 a day but in intervals of 20 because i cant do more than 20 at a time! i have a flat stomach but not prominent abs because i think that looks too manly on a girl. try and do as many as you feel comfortable doing and just increase as it gets easier

However, this isn't in direct relation to a polycystic ovary, except for patients with this condition can often times have insulin resistance and the cinnamon will help keep it under control which is important as to not get diabetes.<br>  <br>  It's important to still see your doctor/endocrinologist, but adding these to your dietary intake cannot harm you, only help.|`|056808dd570d68083099a59a7b2fab22aa	See a good endocrinologist.

ySB6dZYlaa	You're not getting protein. You're putting yourself in starvation mode and when you do eat something your body is going to store it. If you want to be healthy you're gonna need some kind of muscle to maintain you metabolism. or this weight loss is just going to be temporary. So if you just want to be skinny for a few weeks and that's you goal keep it up. exercise is the best diet.|`|m16dhfrGaa	Honey, you are not being nice to yourself.  You need some protein.  Protein helps burn fat,  I understand the joy of losing all those pounds so fast but do yourself a favor and at least eat an egg a day.  Substitute the apples with a chicken breast every other day and you can also eat raw vegetables like celery.  And DO NOT carry on this 'diet' for much longer.  You would do better to eat normally and fast for a day at a time.  You could think about having a small varied meal now, as your stomach will have shrunk and you won't want to eat much.  We are complex systems and need a complex fuel mix.  We need essential elements, we need minerals and vitamins and amino acids.  Do some research.  There is a big difference between minimum nutrition and no nutrition.  Go for the minimum.  And use some protein to turn fat into toned muscle.<br>  <br>  Edit: I didn't answer your original question, of what will happen, or is starting to happen now.  Your hair will start falling out, your brain will suffer memory loss, your bones will become less dense, your kidneys will be strained and your liver will not be producing the enzymes that remove the toxins from your blood.  Your muscles will be depleted because your body functions need the proteins they contain.  Your skin will become pasty and you will leave yourself vulnerable to cell damage and the precursors to cancer.|`|3489c076a022e1d2b31875be5ea7c150aa	you will become addicted to the feeling of emptyness and hate the idea of feeling full - you're messing with your own mind on this one and are showing the signs of anorexia. You need some protein NOW - steam som fish if you can'r bear the idea of anything fatty - or boil an egg. You will feel instantly better. You need to talk to someone - you do not have a weight problem - you have a thought problem. You haven't been strong or disciplied - you are making  yourself ill. I understand the desperation you must be feeling inorder to put your body through this - but it smacks of self-obsession and desperation - if you're dieting to be more attractive - would you want to be with someone like that?

I'd say you're stupid also, but that's against the rules! Instead, I'd say you are desperate and need help badly-- professional help would be my guess.<br>  I strongly encourage you to seek a healthier route to slimness.<br>  It's no fun being lithe/ thin/ skinny etc., if you're laying in a hospital bed with just the nurses admiring your bony bod!<br>  PS: If you're a girl between the ages of 12 and 20, you need a doctor!!|`|kFjNO9Yjaa	your right, it is torture. you are starving yourself of the nutrients your body needs to function. why not just stick to a healthy eating plan instead of a no-eating plan?! incorporate lots of fruit and vegies into your diet along with the necessary amounts of protein, carbs, fats etc and combine with a realistic exercise regime and your body will love you for it. with what you are eating as soon as you eat normal foods again the weight will come back on. do it the healthy way:)|`|HbZ9assfaa	many years ago a friend of mine did it and he end in a hospital.<br>  dear i'm not young and i spend my life doing diet and i have a conclusion:<br>  no mater what u do and how much u lost u will gain ur previous weight <br>  even if u breath air. <br>  best diet is doing sport any kind of sport not only losing weight but also shaping body wich is more important|`|pDccmo6maa	Mark my words.

6e8a2562119ae10db7789da7710dfe93aa	The cold symptoms could be related but the odds are fairly low.<br>  According to avert.org, the 2nd site below, oral sex is relatively low risk but there is a risk of HIV transmission.<br>  <br>  From the first site below:<br>  "After first being infected, a person may have no symptoms for a long time. Sometimes they'll get what they may think of as just some kind of "flu". Such symptoms tend to be a fever, headache, a rash, sore throat, and swollen lymph glands. Since, if they get these "flu"-type symptoms, they'll usually happen between two to six weeks after they actually get infected, most people would not connect what they think is a regular "flu", to being infected with HIV. "<br>  <br>  So, overall, your odds of infection are low but not nil. Abstain form sex for about 90 days and get an HIV antibody test. If it is clear (no infection) consider abstaining for a further 90 days at which point an HIV test would be considered 100% accurate.

9pLdhuBnaa	This cramping can be as a result of the uterus trying to push out the lining that has built up during the time between your last period and this period (an example only).<br>  <br>  However, I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.

NEWbh3Plaa	I have received pain meds that where either old or something was wrong with them.  I take tramadol for my back and about 2 years ago I picked up my prescription and it was like taking a fluoride.  The whole bottle was like that, I too was taking double  the dose and still not having any relief.  I called my doctor and took the pills into him and he wrote me a new script that I had filled else where.|`|AA10572259	If the pills were old then he could have taken them back to the pharmacy and told them he thought they were the wrong pills or out of date.  They would have looked at what they gave him and told him if it was the case.  I know that over the counter pain medication will not work as well if its expired but I don't know how quickly it stops working.  For me it depends on the type of pain as to how things work.  If he has been taking it for seven years then his body may be used to the drugs and that is why he isn't feeling the effects.  He needs to stop taking extra and go talk to his doctor.  He can tell him if its safe to take a higher dose or if maybe he needs to be placed on something else.  Taking more can do damage to his liver among other things and just cause more problems than he already has.
249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|AA11714009	A sensible, and easy way is to take a brisk 3 mile walk each day.I lost over 30 pounds that way.|`|D0ejGHKBaa	Find something that you really enjoy doing. That way, it will be easier to make time to do it and you will do it more often. <br>  <br>  Doing it more often means more exercise and more weight loss, even though the particular activity may not burn as many calories as something you hate to do.  <br>  <br>  For example, going to the gym and doing an hour of intense aerobics will probably burn more calories than biking for an hour. But if you hate it, you're not going to do it very often. And if you like to bike, you will find time do it, do it more often and burn more calories in the long run than the aerobics.|`|AA10424307	The BEST activity is always the one you will perform regularly, feel good doing it and afterwards.<br>  Swimming is better for muscle tone and stretching than for weight loss. Bowling is a great activity but unless you're bowling for hours every day (!) I doubt it's a great exercise for weight loss.<br>  <br>  Brisk walking is the safest and most do-able activity for most people young or old because it can be done almost anywhere. Running is fabulous --but also risks more injury/damage to joints, etc.<br>  Depending on your age and location, check out walking groups near you to maybe find a regular routine with like-minded people whose company will keep you focused as well as prevent boredom.<br>  Lifting light weights and/or using videos for at-home exercise routines works for many people; you can go at your own pace but with the focus provided by video instructor. Also you can get videos free (library) or cheap and have a few for variety of exercises.<br>  Good Luck!|`|OiHpMlOhaa	One is Jogging and the other is Skipping additionally you can control your diet and can reduce the weight.|`|VSB98koJaa	The only long term method of loosing weight is to cut something like a leg off.  <br>  <br>  To get rid of ugly, uncontrollable fat, leave him.|`|17aea0a99c061d3c909d9a5cfeed74b9aa	Running burns the most calories per hour. If it's hard on your joints, you can also use elliptical machines and stair masters.  A lot of different sports activities will raise your fitness, make you less hungry and give you more energy and so I'd recommend doing something you really like.  I added a link with calories per hour burned.<br>  <br>  Building muscle bulk will burn more calories all day and night but the most important weight loss regimen involves fewer calories taken in.  You can bike for one hour and burn 300 calories but gain all of that back with one bottle of a sports drink or adding french fries to a meal (500 calories!).<br>  <br>  The best activity is to keep track of your calories taken in (diet diary).  It takes very little time and effort but will really raise your awareness of where you can cut calories and puts you in a mindset to lose weight. Exercise on top of that but you may be disappointed with weeks of working out and losing only a few pounds.  <br>  <br>  The link below will calculate your caloric requirements but the easiest way is to simply find out how much you are taking in and drop 500 calories per day.  That will drop 3500 per week and you'll lose a pound per week easily.  Exercise will accelerate that loss.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|omhlhk8faa	All activity is good. Just remember that you have to still use more calories than you consume to lose weight. Check out the calorie calculator on the link below. Burn 500 or 600 calories less than you consume per day and you will lose 1-2 pounds per week.|`|pDccmo6maa	Running is the the activity with the highest calorie loss per hour.

YKQomDJMaa	I think those are very clear and to-the-point questions, and that the best way to handle this would be to sit down and have a talk with him about it.  It's definitely not a healthy situation.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should take a peek into his collection.  Sounds a little icky, but see what kinds of stuff he's into and do a little of that for him.  If he likes to watch it on camera, maybe he would also like it in person.<br>  <br>  I'm sure if you talked to him about and told him how it's hurting you relationship, he would have some input as to why he's that way and what would cause him to stop.  Give him an ear and he'll tell you what's going on.  Have HIM make the decisions, ask him what YOU should do.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps & good luck.|`|n7uzcdRbaa	He is an addict, addicts have rituals associated with acquiring and using their "stuff" - so he downloads it and saves it.

It also gives a very unrealistic view of what a real woman looks like, which can further reduce one's sex drive. It's good that you both understand that it is an addiction and a real problem. <br>  <br>  For the first question, I think the only answer here is to talk to him and let him know how you feel.<br>  <br>  Second, the only thing you can do, again, is to have a heart-to-heart conversation with him and tell him how you feel. Perhaps you can try to meet some of his fantasies (within reason, if course).<br>  <br>  Third, this is a common behavior amongst habitual porn watchers.<br>  <br>  Lastly, I would install a porn scanner on his computer. <a href="http://www.smutscanner.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.smutscanner.com</a> is one but there are others as well. If he knows that there is a program on the computer that can track and show you, his girlfriend, how much porn he has amassed, perhaps he will cut down on it out of guilt if nothing else.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
LqvX5whyaa	Heya,<br>  Treatments of tonsillitis consist of pain management medications and lozenges If the tonsillitis is caused by bacteria, then antibiotics are prescribed, with penicillin being most commonly used.Erythromycin is used for patients allergic to penicillin.<br>  In many cases of tonsillitis, the pain caused by the inflamed tonsils warrants the prescription of topical anesthetics for temporary relief. Viscous lidocaine solutions are often prescribed for this purpose.<br>  Ibuprofen or other analgesics can help to decrease the edema and inflammation, which will ease the pain and allow the patient to swallow liquids sooner.<br>  When tonsillitis is caused by a virus, the length of illness depends on which virus is involved. Usually, a complete recovery is made within one week; however, some rare infections may last for up to two weeks.<br>  Chronic cases may indicate tonsillectomy (surgical removal of tonsils) as a choice for treatment.<br>  Additionally, gargling with a solution of warm water and salt or tea tree oil, may reduce pain and swelling.<br>  Hope i helped - take care - please consult your doctor if you wish to put your mind at rest further on this issue.<br>  x|`|TuVtWVFxaa	the best cure would be a tonsillectomy.|`|JjXFj2EBaa	Ignore the big long answer, go for the antibiotics|`|mlAwNRWhaa	I NEED to correct the guy below...<br>  <br>  If it is Bacteria that Causes the Tonsillitis, then antibiotics is the remedy..<br>  <br>  If the infection is Viral then there is no drug to cure it...<br>  <br>  Most doctors will recommend treatments designed to keep a patient comfortable while the disease runs its course.

This is common for people with a over active mind (you constantly are thinking about something) and people who are experiencing symptoms of depression. One thing i do is listen to calming music to relax tension and calm my nerves. It may sound silly, but listening to jazz actually increases your happiness when you are feeling angry. I conducted a little study at my school testing all kinds of music on people. The results showed that Christian rock, Jazz, classical, and some soft rock may help you to think less and get rid of unusual mood changes.

You could be dehydrated and your body is reacting to a low level of fluid.  Because you don't have enough water, your brain and your stomach react with pain.<br>  <br>  2.

hdTztmKDaa	It can be very challenging and difficult to live with a bipolar. I have days where I love everyone and trust total strangers. Then there are days when I trust no one and everyone is out to get me. I dated a guy that on certain days I totally trusted, and on other days was convinced he was cheating on me. I would stay in touch with him and just be someone to talk to if you still care about him. And if hes not on or taking his meds, I would strongly suggest you discuss that with him too.|`|896b777670a85c87e5462fd4b4dc801aaa	It's a possibility.<br>  <br>  I know someone whose boyfriend is depressed/biopolar and he kept like doing "breaks" because he was afraid he was just going to let her down, or that she wouldn't want to be with him anymore one day and he was trying to save his heart from becoming broken. Maybe his feelings changed too, but if you were together for a long period of time than he probably is hiding his feelings. It is going to be hard to transition knowing your feelings are there, and all you can do is be just as supportive and show him your love, as a really good friend, and maybe he could change his mind.<br>  <br>  Stay strong and supportive, that's what he really needs.|`|NedImsV3aa	yes, it is kinda difficult to be in a romantic relationship because we get "moody" and we just well doubt things at times and feel alone even though we r not and its kinda better to be just friends but most of the time we just go back to bein bf/gf so u might end up with him again its just a thing bipolar/ppl with depression go through :]|`|upx2bF4Waa	Ok I don't believe on having your Ex-bf/gf as your friend.

You too can do this if you want.|`|h7uxxiZZaa	it is not easy to answer. it could be both, he could be sorry that he feels that you may feel let down. or he could be a jerk but most likely its the depression
BG8vMyZjaa	Symptoms of anxiety<br>  When you're anxious, you may also experience a range of physical symptoms. These happen because of the bodies' so-called "fight or flight" response, which is caused by the release of the stress hormone adrenaline. The symptoms can include:<br>  * abdominal discomfort* diarrhoea* dry mouth* rapid heartbeat or palpitations* tightness or pain in chest* shortness of breath* dizziness* frequent urination* difficulty swallowing* shaking'<br>  <br>  Treating anxiety disorders<br>  Self-help<br>  You may be able to improve your symptoms by using relaxation techniques, exercise or by talking to other people in support groups. Your GP can advise you about groups in your area.

As time goes by and your body develops more into a woman body you will grow into them. You should be thankful, men LOVE girls with hips!!!!! :]|`|ILcmgBtraa	I had a different answers until I saw that you were only 14.  Trust those of us that are older - be happy with your body now. Learn to live with the body you were given (we all have different shapes).  Be glad you're not writing the same question but telling us you're 200 lbs.   And 18 isn't old, that's probably when you will have your best body!  <br>    Find a good tailor for your jeans.  You can buy the jeans to fit your hips and then a tailor can take in the waist.|`|3yiXZ9bnaa	i agree with selina, you need to weight at least 108 to be in the normal weight range for that height.
XZqSO94saa	Personally, I love "red pepper roasted hummus".<br>  It's very healthy for you, along with a healthy fat content.<br>  It also contain's protein, and fiber.<br>  You're combination for lunch sound's very good.

Y4s4Om38aa	Yes after the first full week you should be protected.  However, if you just want to be safe, to use a condom as a back up for the first month isnt a bad idea.<br>  <br>  Also remeber to use a condom for back up if you are ever on antibiotics, while you are on them and for at  least a week after you are off.|`|bffa71be9e2af7c9f6b16aba7fa5782aaa	bout' a month.|`|DQsyrDHUaa	one month

Drinking eight glasses of water is almost like a must. And do not forget to drink water in the morning, the moment you wake up. In fact this is one of the most rapid weight loss tips that the dieticians suggest to the people. <br>  Have organic foods for the breakfast like apples, bananas, plain yogurt, tomatoes, carrots, peppers, raw honey, wild smoked salmon, and so on. <br>  Keeping a track on the watch, go for an hour walk. It need not be power walking, but definitely it should be non-stop walk and that’s for sure, in a couple of days only, you’ll start finding the difference in you. <br>  Another tip regarding how to lose weight fast, easy and safe is that you should have your dinner about 4-5 hours before going off to sleep. <br>  The two-point program that will ensure the ultimate success is: regular exercise and balanced diet. <br>  Don’t depend upon fat burning diet supplements. They wont go a long way in helping you sustain your reduced kilos. <br>  Soft drinks cannot benefit you in any way. They contain 150 empty calories, so if you substitute one bottle of soft drink with water each day, it will do wonders for you. It will enable you to lose about 16 lbs per year. <br>  Sometimes boredom becomes a cause of overeating, so keep yourself busy. <br>  If you want to seriously control your weight, then you have to stop yourself from getting lured into trying tempting foods. <br>  As important is to pay attention to the fact that we eat the right food, equally vital is to keep a watch on the quantity. Without altering your diet plan, even if you’ll reduce 5-10% of your consumption, it will prove beneficial. <br>  Eat slowly so that you can get a feeling that you have had enough food and your tummy is full. Eat slowly and fully relish the taste.
H2IqzG12aa	It's called pre-ejaculate, and it's normal.  Some guys produce more than others, some less.  It's a mildly caustic fluid that neutralizes any leftover uric acid in your urethra from urinating so as to make it safe for sperm to pass through.<br>  <br>  Nothing to be embarrassed about, Tiger.  If you didn't ask, there's no way you would have known.  And try not to think of your sexual fantasies as "dirty."  Like the song says, "You can't go to jail for what you're thinking!"

Someone who watches their weight and monitors it at least once a week has a better chance of keeping the excess weight off.<br>  <br>  For myself, I have found that weighing every day allows me to see if there is an uptick...I don't freak out at all, as I know that water retention can add a few pounds one side or the other of my actual weight...but if I were to weight only once a month or less, my weight would vary more.<br>  <br>  It is far easier to cut back gradually on food intake, or stop eating bad foods, when the weight is a smaller issue.  If one waits until the scales show a 20-pound gain, instead of a 5-pound gain, it is  harder to wrap the mind around, to form an action plan and to psych oneself up to do something about it!|`|55owncjLaa	They are either too big, or too small

I have severe anxiety and have had to drop courses because of it.  People would ask me why I dropped the courses, and I'd make up some crap about how it didn't really fit in with my timetable.  Actually, a few days ago (I had to drop a compulsory course) I tried explaining why to someone I'm sort of friends with, and she laughed and said she wished she could drop a course for having such high anxiety.  Um, yeah, no you don't.<br>  <br>  I think it's because they're trying to victimize themselves to try to gain sympathy/attention.  Of course, the other mindless teens will give it to them because they think it's so terrible that their friend has "OCD" or whatever else they saw on TV the night before.  Then, when you try to explain social anxiety to someone all they can say is "Don't worry, I'm sometimes shy too!  You're okay!" >.< It really bugs me how these people who fake mental disorders give others the illusion that things like OCD/depression/anxiety aren't that bad.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	I don't think anyone, including you, has the right to deterimine whether or not someone is "sick enough" to say they have a disorder or not.  You are not that person, nor do you have insight into what goes on in their head.  How can you possibly know what they're feeling or determine if they're "really" sick or not?   You are an outsider and an observer, not a doctor.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you dropped out of school due to depression, but the vast majority of people suffering from depression do not do that.  They enter into treatment and continue as best they can with their studies.  I was one of those people, and I assure you my situation was anything but attention-seeking.<br>  <br>  Overworried parents and overzealous doctors can often put ideas into teens' heads about what is wrong with them, even if it's not correct or accurate.  <br>  <br>  I think the more important question here is, why does it make you mad for others to say that they are ill?  No one gets an award for being the sickest.  <br>  <br>  To me, it sounds like you're just upset that attention is being taken away from you.|`|0HroPJhxaa	I just want to point out that some people with OCD *do* have to wash their hands a lot, and people with depression don't always drop out of school.<br>  You don't really know if a person is ill or not just by the way they act.<br>  You aren't the only teenager with a mental illness, and it's quite unfair to assume that any teen who says they have one is lying.|`|JmNs0Hgbaa	That is our job.<br>  <br>  For example.<br>  I have ADOS.<br>  <br>  Attention Deficiency..

BDD AND ANOREXIA IS also one of their pretend illness's. it must be awful for a real sufferer, who has to keep it secret because she fears that people think shes play acting. ADHD is another one. They feel it makes them cool. Mental illness has gone straight from being a stigma to a fashion Accessory. we wanted it somewhere in the middle.<br>  <br>  I dont know what the thumbs down was for but its about time someone told you that you are a spoilt brat. There are certain ways of spotting a fake. There are certain things inside of a mentally ill person that cannot be faked. A mentally ill can spot a fake better than a shrink.

Every time you catch yourself getting ready to overindulge just ask yourself if it's worth it.  Ask yourself "What do I want more...this extra food or to keep losing weight?"

If you know you've been making the right decisions you won't have to worry about getting fat.

zNn9VfRyaa	try this too<br>  <br>  to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions|`|aZi6BvBraa	A whole English muffin with peanutbutter for breakfast? Thats bad! Allready brings you to like half of your daily allowed fat intake!<br>  Toast would be a way better option! U can still have the peanutbutter, just toast is a bit boring :-) But look at the kind of peanutbutter. get an organic peanutbutter, there is usually less fat and suger in them|`|cLGXa8O3aa	try to eat mostly protein and less bread.  a better abdominal workout is similar to a crunch, but you bring your knees up to your forehead at the same time.  peanut butter is crazy loaded with fat|`|RO5RlTLmaa	sounds good, I would add to it either a whey protein shake mixed/blended with yogurt and some fruit...or an egg white or two with some fruit (or one egg)...after your workout eat something light that has protein in it and maybe half a snickers bar...then 2 hours later or so eat that salad, maybe add a little fruit or some grilled chicken or diced ham or turkey. (fat free dressing or none and hold the cheese)...SO you want to eat all through out the day, sounds weird, but you want to keep your body in an anabolic state throughout the day (or keep your metabolism up) and you do this by eating lean and healthy foods through out the day.  Also if you are just starting out your exercise routine is good but I would either do more excercise or do that same routine 2-3 more times in a day...remember keep your fruit and carbs toward the beginning of the day and as time goes on lean more toward veggies and fats (mono/poly) while eating lean protein throughout...this will turn your body into a furnace literally burning the fat and calories!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Carbs will not be digested toward the end of the day, your healthy fats will be better utilized at this time.  (Use Whole Grain/Multi-Grain products)|`|CWVBfaPwaa	Peanut butter does have protein, but is very high in fat.  Breakfast though is the best time to eat the fattening stuff because you're more than likely going to burn it off faster than say at night. Dancing is an excellent form of excercise, plus it's fun. Try doing planks and butterflies if you want a firmer stomach and tighter core.
UAW1U3Uoaa	Average heart rate is 72 bpm for men (more for women) thats 4320 per hour, 103680 per day, and 37843200 per year, the current world average life expectancy in 66 (obviously developed world is somewhat longer) so over 66 years the average number of heart beats would be around 2497.6 million. There is no limit as such the heart will keep going as long as it and the rest of the body are healthy, the longest unambiguously documented lifespan is that of Jeanne Calment of France (1875–1997), who died at age 122 years and 164 days, who would have had around 4.6 billion heart beats in her lifetime.|`|GyBeE7ofaa	There's no hard limit on how many times a heart can beat in a lifetime, but it is possible to calculate the average. I'm too lazy to do that though. :)<br>  <br>  However, there's the upper limit of your maximum heart rate per minute. This limit determines how fast you can run, or perform other strenuous exercises. It usually starts out around 200 for young children, and then gradually goes down to 140 as we hit the old age.|`|paV2LdR9aa	No|`|GRebsvfiaa	no

oARkQFEuaa	About detox body wrap can be read in <a href="http://health-schools.blogspot.com/?q=detox%20body%20wrap" rel="nofollow">http://health-schools.blogspot.com/?q=de...</a>|`|KAnEq8Laaa	I have not myself tried it, but I have seen one person who has, and have watched a couple programs about it, and I have to say that to me, it seems like a prime example of "junk" science. While it seems to be true that the people who have used it (Tyra Banks, et al) are pretty convinced that they "lost inches," please remember that the 6 inches they were talking about were cumulative, added up from measurements all over the body. So Miss Tyra could have lost 1/4 inch in her stomach. That's for starters. Second, how exactly is clay applied topically to the body going to draw out "toxins" from your internal organs? Wow, that's some good stuff there, that clay! Next, these treatments do not come with any kind of follow up, except perhaps to keep periodically coming back for another go. So here's my considered opinion: If it makes you feel good, and you've got the money to do it, then do it. This, unlike taking pills or potions, isn't anything that's going to cause permanent damage, and if it makes you feel better in a low spot, go for it. However, don't expect dramatic results, or, for that matter, results that really last. For permanent, positive changes to the body, you must change your eating habits if they are poor, and you must incorporate exercise, rest, proper nutrition, and good self-care into your regimen. Also, any such changes can't be accomplished in a couple hours with bandages and clay, but rather take time. In the meantime, if you have the cash and if it makes you feel good to have this detox treatment, then, like a nice haircut or a professional manicure, you go right ahead.|`|xL9EpNctaa	I have done the New You Power Wraps and I love them. They do give yu a temporary inch loss, but the benefits for your skin and general well being are great. I feel fantastic afterward and my skin is soft and moisturized. IF you are looking for a permanent,quick, easy weight/inch loss this is not it (nothing is). But if you want a temporary slim down for a vacation or special event then this will do the trick. Keep in mind you need at least 3 of them for a noticeable difference.
2UDbOpxTaa	Whilst the job offers aren't coming in, why don't you do some volunteer work? It'll fill you day, be very fulfilling, and be something extra to put on your CV. You can still be applying for jobs on the side.|`|oojO4WAraa	I never took lessons to learn to drive, my dad taught me.  Maybe your bf could help you learn to drive.  You can get a learners permit and drive on country roads or in parking lots at first.   Once you can drive then you can search for work and get around easier.  Also, try getting up earlier so you two are on the same schedule.  <br>  <br>  Exercise also helps with depression and sleep.  Start walking an hour a day, you are home so you have the time and walking doesn't cost anything.  <br>  <br>  If you are good at cleaning maybe you could put advertisements in local church bulletins and find cleaning jobs that way, of course you would still need a way to get there.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I hope things get better for you.|`|mz4ZTqNCaa	I went through the exact same thing.<br>  <br>  The one thing to keep in mind is that it will get better. It feels like it wont but it really will!<br>  <br>  You have to keep yourself occupied somehow. Excersise is a good one because it helps with depression.<br>  <br>  Try and keep the same sleeping pattern as your boyfriend so you can get to sleep at the same time as him<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|PggTWb6qaa	Have a cookie.|`|JltE5LIHaa	Oh dear, you are not very positive at all are you. Moving away from old friends and jobs is not an easy thing to do and I am sure you thought long and hard about it. Four years ago I left my job of 10 years and my home and my grown up children and grandchildren and moved 120 miles away. It took me months to find a job and that was only part time. My first F/T job I hated but stuck it out until something better came along. Now I would never go back. You need to motivate yourself. Get up earlier, go for a walk or a jog to get yourself motivated. Do housework or gardening. Go and see an elderly neighbour and do a bit of shopping for them ot tidy their garden. Offer to help out at a local coffee morning or in the local charity shop. This is the only way to meet people. It won't happen by you staying in bed til mid morning. This will all help to stop you feeling lonely or depressed which will help with your relationship. Have you considered working from home. Come on get up, get moving and start to live a little.
lJZQSs40aa	Your doing fine, stop obsessing over your weight.  Your current weight is healthy.  Find something else to occupy your time.|`|AA12386598	If you are in the swim team you should be strong. People at that level of fitness are not going to lose fat on aerobics. I would suggest the following.<br>  1. Do strength/weight training thrice a week.<br>  2. Medium intensity aerobics (crosstrainer) 30mins 3 days/week.<br>  3. Eliminate all table sugar and 'high fructose corn syrup' from your diet.<br>  4. Small meals every 3-4 hours (6/day).<br>  With all the above you will see a better physique in under a month.<br>  Good Luck and I would appreciate some feedback.|`|ts60y45oaa	Be careful that you are not gettin into heavy weights as this would stunt your growth, however you are at a good height already for your age.  You seem to be fit and healthy so also remember that muscle is heavier than fat, so if you are building lean muscle, which if you are doing what you say you are, you probably will be, then any conversion from fat to muscle will not affect your weight

Try to see your doctor as soon as possible, since you're having it pretty rough - they might be able to prescribe some antibiotics or something.<br>  <br>  That's all I can really recommend - the painkillers should help to make you more comfortable and you may find it easier to rest.  However, if your breathing is laboured, I advise going to the hospital to get immediate medical care.<br>  <br>  Hope all goes well.
BG8vMyZjaa	Ignore that blogspot, the site is new, Netcraft so far rates it high risk.<br>  <br>  If your workout is four hours away, eat a regular meal that combines protein, fat and carbohydrates, then have a small carbohydrate-rich snack closer to your exercise session to tide you over. Three hours before working out, make it a smaller meal and lighten up a bit on the protein and fat. Thirty to 90 minutes before exercise, have a snack of easily digested carbohydrates. If you only have the 15 minutes between, say, leaving your office and hitting the gym to grab something, go for a sports drink or a few Saltines. Also keep in mind that while eating high-fiber foods is important for good health, they're best eaten after or long before exercise, since they can cause bloating and other annoyances that will make you feel uncomfortable when working out.|`|JYHlPczxaa	t, I understand where you're coming from.<br>  Here's what I found out after lots of research and trial and error, the hard way.<br>  <br>  The reality is that there are no shortcuts or easy ways to get in good shape. Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://thefatlosssecret.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thefatlosssecret.blogspot.com/</a>   <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight ,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://thefatlosssecret.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thefatlosssecret.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.
87xtXHpwaa	Do you have an older monitor?  Older ones can cause more eye strain since they actually flicker (too quickly to notice - but have you ever seen a shot of one on television?).  <br>  <br>  New LCD monitors are better than the old (bigger) CRT type.<br>  <br>  If you can adjust your graphics settings to a higher refresh rate, this might help.  If you can change it from 60 Hz to 75 Hz, you might solve the problem.  <br>  <br>  Also, make sure you aren't getting too much outside light causing reflections on your screen.  If you are, pull the shades down or close the curtains a bit more.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!!|`|H0aiDO9Paa	The strain of prolonged staring at a computer monitor can cause those blood vessels to become engorged, creating the illusion that new ones have appeared. Your eyes may also feel dry and itchy. Resting, drinking plenty of water, and reducing eyestrain should resolve the problem. (Consult an ophthalmologist if the symptoms persist.) Here's how to help prevent the problem from recurring:<br>  Give your eyes regular breaks. And try to blink frequently, to distribute moisture to your corneas.<br>  Reduce glare by adjusting the surrounding light and the screen contrast or by using a screen filter. Keep the top of your monitor at or just below eye level, and keep your eyes at the same distance from the screen as you would from a book.<br>  Be sure that eyeglasses or contacts fit well and are the correct prescription.<br>  Consider buying either a liquid-crystal-display (LCD) monitor or a regular monitor with a high "refresh rate," both of which ease eyestrain by flickering less than other monitors. And good luck.|`|CaPZrWVWaa	Other things you might try is adjusting the size on the text. Make things bigger so you can read them without strain. <br>  you can shrink it back before you need to print. <br>  <br>  Try turning the brightness down on your computer, less contrast between the bright white and text can also cause head aches. <br>  <br>  Get enough sleep.<br>  <br>  These are the things I do to help me avoid head aches at my computer.|`|i4so2FqMaa	u did not mention if laptop or desk top if laptop adjust the screen for the light. If u wear glasses and they are bifocals see your eye doc and get a set that are the same as the reading part of your glasses and just use them for the pc. I did and works  great. Also take a few more breaks|`|x335p4WBaa	I guess you have got great suggestions already, but using a detox foot spa can be a permanent solution to your headache problem.|`|RUVfiy3zaa	Cosult an eye specalist doctor,your eyes may be straining when you are looking to the computer, may be he will suggest a glass for you

13k2WKx8aa	Being that the fever was almost nothing and you're over your symptoms, there's a very substantial chance that it WAS NOT meningitis. You probably just had a slight flu for a while.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry much about it now that you're better. Meningitis would have made you much much sicker than you were, and at this point (if you still had it) you probably wouldn't be typing this right now.<br>  <br>  Others say go to the doctor ASAP. I'll say it's your call. You over your slight flu and are feeling better. If you want to get what I like to call "the warm and fuzzy" about knowing that you didn't have meningitis, then feel free to go.<br>  <br>  The stiff neck could just have been due to lying down for extended periods of time. The flu can also cause body aches, the neck being no exception.|`|H0aiDO9Paa	See your health care provider as soon as possible. With fever and headache, there is a possibility of meningitis. Meningitis may cause intense spasms of the neck muscles and make the neck very stiff. More commonly, though, neck pain is part of a flu syndrome that includes fever, muscle aches, and a headache. When generalized aching throughout the muscles is present, a visit to a doctor is seldom useful.<br>  When a stiff neck is due to one of the more common causes of muscle spasm, the sufferer can usually touch the chin to the chest, though perhaps with difficulty. If in doubt, it is better to see the doctor for an ordinary muscle spasm than to attempt to treat meningitis at home. And good luck.|`|3Ks21ASDaa	It sounds like just a virus but GO TO THE DOCTOR!!! You need to find out if you have it or not. It's serious stuff!
AA11280073	Avoid seeds and nuts. Those are the foods that cause problems. I was hospitalized with diverticulitis once, but not that I avoid those food I have had no flare-ups. <br>  High fiber foods are good for this condition.|`|AA12266052	Diverticulitis is inflammation of a diverticulum, which can result in phlegmon of the bowel wall, peritonitis, perforation, fistula, or abscess. The primary symptom is abdominal pain. Diagnosis is by CT scan. Treatment is with antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, or a 3rd-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole) and occasionally surgery.|`|qJquEEdmaa	wow i didn't know what diverticulitis was till today...anyway sorry i don't know any treatments...this is something new to me i will look into it though..........maybe
Qdw3uPFYaa	you need a full body weight training and cardio program that will focus on toning muscles and losing bodyfat and you only need 3 days at the gym m,w,f<br>  <br>  Mon chest/triceps: dbpress, cable crossovers/ db kickbacks, standing db extensions<br>  <br>  Wed: Legs/biceps: Squats, leg ex, leg curl/ db curls, cable curls<br>  <br>  Fri: Back/shoulders: cable Pulldowns, seated cable rows/ db presses, db laterals and db front raises<br>  <br>  do 3 sets with lighter weights with 15-20 reps focus on good form and focus your mind on the muscle your working.  If you want to burn extra calories superset some of these exercises in a circuit for ex: Squat 10-15 reps go directly to leg extensions for 10-15 then go directly to Leg curls for 15-20 this is a good way to bring cardio into your workout and also get you in and out of the gym alot faster!  you should not be in the gym for more than one hour. After you weight training I suggest you get at least 20 minutes of cardio in I use the ellipticall but it's up to you cycle,treadmill as long as your moving<br>  <br>  Here is the best site I've found for exercises and videos on how to do them <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com</a> just click on the supersite icon then click on exercises to the left for  a complete listing of every exercise for every bodypart with tips on how to perform and a instructional video with an athlete demonstrating the exercise there are also a ton of articles on nutrition,training, etc.. hope this helps|`|uJKTR4d2aa	If you are trying to cut weight stick to cardio, like the treadmil or bike machine elyptical etc. 1 an 1/2 hour is plenty, even 1 hour is plenty. Food counts a lot though, make sure you dont eat more than 1800 calories per day.|`|HlD9dRF2aa	For all the "quick weight loss posts" that are about to bombard your question.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fakereviewssuck.com/scams/aca..." rel="nofollow">http://www.fakereviewssuck.com/scams/aca...</a> (Acai Berry is a Brazillian blueberry. If you want antioxidants, go to Kroger. Steam some broccoli and throw blueberries in your breakfast cereal. Tea? Um runs contrary to the water drinking thing. Other products are great--I love shoving stuff up my...err...huh?)<br>  <br>  Now for the real way. Work out smarter, not harder. Low intensity workouts (elliptical, running, biking) where your heart rate stays in Zone 2 (60-70% of maximum heart rate) burns calories at a rate 85% calories, 15% glycogen. The higher your heart rate or the more intense the workout the lower the ratio of Fat to Glycogen becomes.<br>  <br>  If you run 3 miles in 23 minutes and your heart is pounding at the end, you've burned about 480 calories of which probably 400 cal. came from sugar.<br>  <br>  If you WALK 3 miles in 45 minutes, and you feel like you could walk another 3 miles no problem, then chances are you burned 400 cal. that came from fat stores (which is harder for your body to replace) and 80 cal came from sugar. (The number of calories burned is essentially the same in either case because you do the same amount of work -- the laws of physics are hard to change.)<br>  <br>  LOW intensity exercise for the duration is the way to go for weight loss overall--LESS CHANCE OF INJURY.  Changing from running, elliptical machines, swimming and cycling works out everything so you don't have to worry so much about isolating parts.  Lots of fruits and vegetables, no preprocessed foods, no fried foods and limit beef intake. Go for chicken. Cross training in cycling or swimming also increases caloric burn and is a nice change. Swimming is good for recovery as well.  I can't speak for weight training as I do calesthenics (pushups/pullups/planks/pull cords/resistance training) instead.<br>  <br>  THERE ARE LOTS OF CLUBS OUT THERE FOR RUNNING, SWIMMING, AND CYCLING. Triathlete/Multisport clubs are growing in popularity as well as weekend bike rides and 5-10K runs on the weekend.  Join one, make some friends, and get lots of encouragement!  It doesn't matter what you look like or what your goal is -- a lot of those lean mean athletes were once where you are and can totally relate, and can help lots.  Most of the time, they're free to join or have just a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  MOST IMPORTANTLY: Having a motivating purpose is VERY helpful. Sign up for a 10K run 12 weeks from now and promise yourself you will run/jog the whole thing and cross the finish line with a smile. If you train for it and STICK TO A TRAINING PLAN but if miss a workout don't sweat it--stuff happens. The weight loss comes as almost an afterthought as you're following a schedule of training/recovery days. Start out for example walking/jogging 20 minutes non-stop at CONVERSATIONAL PACE 4x per week using a 10 minute walking cooldown afterwards. Increase duration of the jog by no more than 10% per week. In 12 weeks you'll be able to run 60 minutes non-stop and feel like you could keep going. By then a 10K for you should be a warmup.<br>  <br>  See you at the finish line! And start saving your money-- you're going to need new clothes. This type of weight loss is permanent because it turns you into an athlete for life. <br>  <br>  If you get injured running and have to take time off, start swimming or cycling.

mxixfE3Raa	In terms of losing weight on your face, that is usually the 1st thing which is noticable when someone loses weight, so you're in luck there.<br>  You should aim to lose 8-10lbs a month. 10lbs lost = one dress size less. So you would be noticably slimmer by may, being about 2 dress sizes slimmer.<br>  For the tummy the only thing I can reccommend is any stomach and buns (abs & glutes) work out video. They're so good and make you burn fat and tone those places all in one. If you just do plain stomach crunches and so then you may build some muscle but the fat will still be there.<br>  <br>  <br>  To tone and lose weight you need to do what is strength training AND a cardio workout.<br>  Your workout regime should consist of about 350 cardio minutes each week. So anything like workout videos or running. It just has to get your heart pumping so anything where you're moving alot. I find exercise videos the best and they're least boring. Cardio is what burns fat.<br>  You also have to go any sort of strength training every other day. This would be lifting weights, sit ups, stomach crunches. Basically anything which burns your muscles but you're heart doesn't pump as much. This is the part that tones your body. But will only work if you do cardio workouts during the week aswell. You need to do this every other day, and not every day, because it allows your muscles to heal and develop properly.<br>  <br>  <br>  In terms of what you eat you really need to count the following nutritional values of as much of the food you eat as you can: -Calories -Protein -Fat and -Carbohydrates.<br>  These are the four key things. To lose weight and tone your body you need to eat around these amounts.<br>  1200-1500 calories.<br>  160g-240g of carbohydrates.<br>  30g-60g of fat.<br>  60-120g of protein.<br>  Also another tip is to eat less as you go furthur through the day. So basically you should have a large breakfast, medium lunch and small dinner.<br>  This allows the activities you do during the day to burn the most possible fat. Say if you exercise around lunch time, then go and have a big dinner, you're still going to store the fat from the dinner until the next day. <br>  <br>  You also should monitor your weight loss every week. Your body will tone more and more every day, but you won't notice it for about a month.<br>  It's really hard to keep to routine, so if you weigh yourself every week, then you will see that you've lost weight and stay motivated, whereas if you look in the mirror every week you might not notice much of a difference and this might make you want to give up.<br>  People will start to notice your body being more toned after you've lost about 10-15lbs. Which can be achieved anything between a month and two months. You should also measure your waist and hips every week. As you go through your toning journey you might notice the weight doesn't come off as quick, but this is because your muscle is replacing the fat and muscle weighs more than fat, but takes up less room. So if you don't notice it on the scales you may notice it on the tape measure.<br>  <br>  If you're planning on keeping the routine up for more than a month, then you should know that you need to decrease your nutrition intakes for every 10lbs you lose. This is because as your body gets smaller and more toned, it will need less food, so after a month you should reduce your calorie intake to between 1150 - 1400. And reduce carbs, fat and protein by about 5 or 10. If you don't do this your body will just stay at the same weight as it will be used to the amounts you're eating.<br>  <br>  Oh and another tip is to drink 8 glasses of water a day, I know this sounds cliche, but it really does work, as it boosts your metabolism and it's calorie free. If you don't like water then any sugar free dilutable drink is fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|XsqlvtI9aa	Stop for a second.  I'm telling you this, and I know what I'm talking about.<br>  People who think that losing weight alone is healthy are WRONG on so many levels! When you decide to lose weight, <br>  <br>  you should lose the extra pounds safely and in a healthy way. You don't want to end up with anorexia, bulimia, or any <br>  <br>  other eating disorders because inorganic supplements disrupted your body's normal processes instead of helping it get <br>  <br>  back on the healthy track.<br>  <br>  The Acai Berry weight loss pill helps you avoid that because it's both safe and organic. Not only is this product <br>  <br>  popular with mothers who choose organic supplements for their family but is also greatly popular with international <br>  <br>  celebrities and the Brazilian people. It is also an easy way to give your children the daily nutrients they need.<br>  Now I'm not just saying this.<br>  The Acai berry is bursting with vital nutrients. It's consisted of 52.2 grams of carbohydrates, 8.1 grams of protein, <br>  <br>  and 44.2 grams of fiber forms for every 100 grams of the fruit's extract. It also has the highest antioxidant matter <br>  <br>  among organic and inorganic fruits alike.<br>  <br>  Best of all, it helps your body burn fat properly by speeding up your metabolism and improving your digestion and not <br>  <br>  by forcing your body to flush out whatever food you eat.<br>  <br>  So stop just thinking about it and take some massive action by ordering a free trial here: <a href="http://acaiberryselectformula.tk/" rel="nofollow">http://acaiberryselectformula.tk/</a>|`|qz1hXUYyaa	lay on your bed with your upper body hanging off and do crunches. make sure to go back as far as you can, the key is to have a wide range of motion. do it till you cant do it anymore, take a brake, then do it again but kinda tilt on your side and do it that away for both your left and right.<br>  <br>  then, still laying on your bed scoot down and have your upper body on the bed and your butt and legs hanging off. get a duffle bag, fill it with books till your comfortable. put the duffle bag strap on your ankles and then bring it up and down. <br>  <br>  these exercises work your entire abdomen.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|F8EnH6JQaa	TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  the first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your boy adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  If man made it, don't eat it<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  Walk your dog, or walk a friends dog<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

But without the the 90% is definitely not enough.<br>  <br>  Eat wholemeal bread, cheese(low fat), cereals, beans, peanuts, chicken(breast), fish, tuna, vegetables and fruits.<br>  <br>  Don't eat sugary, salty, fast food, oily food.<br>  <br>  Tips for diet: drink enough water(divide your KG by 30 to get how much you need Liters daily), drink atleast one glass of low fat milk, atleast one glass of any fruit juice, and atleast 1 of each orange, apple and banana per day.<br>  <br>  Moving to the exercise routine, I can't really tell without know how you weight and height but anyway if you have some fat then do cycling(classes always the best). Do abs exercise, make sure you do upper, lower and side(google to know which exercise).<br>  Okay about the reps, yesterday a trainer told me at the gym that one tummy guy flatted his abs and 6 pax in just 2 months, he said he had quite big stomach. Anyway, what he did is 600 crunches 5 days a week, which you even can do at home. 100X6=600 that's how! But it is difficult for a beginner, I started today and only did 50+55+50, tomorrow willing to do 250 or 300 maybe, anyway my abs are flat.<br>  <br>  Conclusion, please take care of your diet first before thinking of just exercising. Then do a lot of cycling and treadmills, exercise your abs and back(arss =P), your quad and calf will get exercised by cycling. Do few light upper body too.<br>  <br>  All the best,<br>  <br>  PS: This answer is for a female routine. For male just concentrate more on full upper, mid, and lower body with high reps.
7fc779e36f1c26b1790c0dfad78189fcaa	Hi I am a Personal fitness Trainer, I suggest mixing up your routine, your taken enough protein with whey, your doing exactly right, try a nice balanced diet as well, www.hydroxycut.com  has great recipes I would never use the product but the recipes are great!! make sure you don't neglect your cardio Cardio gives the muscles oxygen you need to replenish and build!! most people forget this part, and always work your body in even measures, legs, arms, thighs, butt, biceps, triceps, chest, abs, and back, you can also find a personal trainer to help you with proper methods of using equipment, never while doing a bicep curl for ex sample go all the way back down to make parell to body keep at angle and come up keep elbow to hip area and never move it always keep arms closer to body to work the muscle properly, you don't want to use momentum to work out its ineffective! Well hope this helps, Good luck!!|`|oTmylEGUaa	Who cares.|`|WEHjGaVKaa	Creatine isn't dangerous as far as every study (and my own experience) goes. It is a little bit of a slippery slope as once you start and experience gains from using it, stopping can cause those gains to diminish as creatine encourages water storage in the muscles making them bigger, the effect goes when creatine levels reduce.<br>  <br>  I would suggest adding an extra scoop of protein powder a day, eating lots of good quality carbs and meat, and if you are serious about packing on some bulk then cut down on the runs - maybe do a couple of runs a week, or just do some high intensity cardio at the end of a weights session. Also, doing the right weights to the right intensity helps. Stick to heavy compound exercises using free weights (as long as you feel safe) - squats, deadlift, bench press, bent-over rows etc. <br>  <br>  Being skinny is good, means when you grow lots of muscle you get good definition, which is better than looking fat!|`|BZMPax7Naa	Eat right.  Eat enough.  Get enough rest. To do it naturally, this is your best bet.  It sounds like you have genetics working against you as well seeing as how your dad is skinny and all.  To counteract that you may need steroids.|`|jLLvmWJHaa	Protein is essential to building muscle, but do not eat too much of it. I'd suggest a well-balanced diet. Some vegetables, meat for protein, and maybe milk. And of course, exercise to help build up that muscle. :p

BhFeii5Xaa	Only boiling the food in water removes the water soluable vitamins. Only boiling the food in oils removes the oil soluable vitamins.<br>  <br>  If the person worried about radio active rays in the foods from microwave is that worried he needs to stay away from computers and TV sets and game consoles. These output more radio active rays than the microwave ever thought of doing. Also said person needs to stay in a dark cave away from the light. Same reason.<br>  <br>  Microwaving is the safe way to cook most foods. None of the vitamins or minerals gets removed because it is not lost in the cooking liquids.<br>  <br>  Best bet is to eat most foods undercooked or raw, anyway.|`|QvSwo3X9aa	Any kind of heat can destroy vitamin C but microwaves don't do anything special to food.|`|qxMpbNRBaa	any dehydration or cooking of food depletes nutrients but microwaves do tend to leave the least nutritional content in food to preserve intial values slow cooking is best|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	somewhat.. they change the molecular structure of foods by cooking inside out<br>  <br>  so yes they do... and also its radio active heat.. don't use the microwave too much..
dBoC8fR2aa	Its actually quite amazing that the pubic hair can only grown to a certain length and stop. Imagine if it can grow longer and longer, eventually they will come out at the bottom of your trousers.|`|ixmaM395aa	It will grow back... and if you're wondering "why does it grow back if it has already grown to it's full length" it's because hair (on all parts of the body) goes through 3 stages of growth. <br>  <br>  The new growth stage - when the new hair grows through the follicle <br>  The resting stage - when the hair is resting at it's full length <br>  The passing stage - when the hair falls out of the follicle and then new growth comes through again. <br>  <br>  So obviously, you're gonna cut your hair back but some hair are in transition stages and still growing. <br>  <br>  Why I just answer this question in so much depth I don't know... but hey, hope I helped!|`|dFKwt7c6aa	well i trim  my pubes and from what i can remember it did stop at a certain length. but since i started trimming, and shaved a few times it does grow back fast now and i like it short so i havent let it go to find out.|`|RLoilwCNaa	It'll grow back. The more you shave the more it will grow back.|`|PPDvtf9Kaa	it'll grow back, pretty sure there's just a certain length it goes to then stops so it doesn't get too unruly down there if you know what i mean. lol|`|z2TjjnxVaa	It would grow back. Just like the rest of the hair on  your body.|`|Y9pyHnHYaa	It'll really grow bck|`|QcI5lhmkaa	what heck is that?|`|ft8t98Pnaa	itll grow back|`|H2IqzG12aa	Not a stupid question at all.  Typically it grows to a couple of inches and then stops.  It's self-limiting like the hair on your arms or legs.  Since it kinks and curls, it's hard to tell how long it is, nor does it matter much.  The effect is that the mass of hair just looks thicker.  It also sheds regularly, so whether you trim it or not, eventually it always looks the same.

fAFXkikAaa	The best place that I know to get good, reliable information about herpes is the website below.   WebMD and the CDC are also good.   Yahoo Answers is an unreliable place to get medical facts - just so you know.   So any answer you get here should be checked by other sources.<br>  <br>  The short answer is that the article is wrong.<br>  <br>  As you mentioned, there are two strains of herpes, and you can get either one orally or genitally.   Let's talk about the situation where you have an established infection in one place (and your body has lots of herpes antibodies built up).   New infections are a bit different, but lets just discuss established infections.<br>  <br>  If you have an established HSV1 infection anywhere on your body, it is extremely unlikely (some doctors say impossible) for you to catch HSV1 elsewhere on your body.   Your body has entibodies for that very strain that will offer excellent protection against another infection.  I would still be a bit careful, but you're pretty darned safe from a genital HSV1 infectoin if you have an oral HSV1 infection.<br>  <br>  An established HSV1 infection also seems to provide some protection against a later HSV2 infection - but it is by no means complete.  It reduces your chances by some measurable amount - maybe 25%, maybe 50% - but you absolutely can catch HSV2 genitally if you already have HSV1 orally.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|PYIA2FCFaa	I have both viruses. if I dont keep up on my valtrex or get really sick, I get cold sores and i have genital out breaks.  But yea..you can get both..|`|RnGlzo4Raa	Genital herpes is an infection of the genitals caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and is the most common ulcerative sexually transmitted disease in the UK. There are two subtypes of the herpes simplex virus: HSV-1 (which causes facial herpes, including cold sores on the lips, but has increasingly been implicated in cases of genital herpes), and HSV-2 (which almost exclusively causes herpes on the genitals). Around 80% of people with genital herpes don’t even know they have it, as there are often no symptoms. However, even without symptoms, it’s possible to pass genital herpes on to a sexual partner because the virus may sometimes be present in your genital area. And once you get the herpes virus, it’s with you for life, which means you will have recurrent infections. Over-the-counter treatments for cold sores will not treat genital herpes, so smearing your genitals with Zovirax is an ineffective alternative to visiting your local GP or GUM clinic.|`|zpVKSq9Kaa	you can get both and you can transmit each type to other parts of the body as well...though hsv2 usually has a very low transmission rate on other parts of the body as it likes the base of the spine by the genitals.<br>  <br>  you can have a cold sore and give your hubby head and give him hsv1 down below.<br>  <br>  though, generally once you're infected with a particular strain, you wont spread it around your body due to antibodies forming.
GfG6wupTaa	Absolutely! And it makes putting on deodorant easier!!|`|H2IqzG12aa	It may.  But a better solution is to use a more powerful antiperspirant.  Or both.|`|E64juLwJaa	It won't stop you from sweating but it will help you with your BO.<br>  Use a good anti sweating stick<br>  Planets|`|u9I9jjF5aa	Won't help with sweatyness, save if you use a good antipersperant with it.  The bodyodor however it will help b/c the sweat won't be caught up in all that hair, whether or not you use antipersperant.  In addition, you may try wearing shirts with moisture wicking fibers.  Both before and after.  If you find you don't like shaving your underarm hair, just remember:  Hair grows back, you'll have your hair back in no time.|`|zHmZkMStaa	No.  The armpit hair acts like a wick, and carries the sweat further from your pit for easier evaporation.  You'll actually have more sweat remaining if you shave it.  However; it MIGHT resuce odor somewhat, in that the sweat has less surface area to cling to.|`|lCvJHS13aa	I normally have very sweaty pit, I started shaving and had much less of a pitting problem.<br>  <br>  It worked for me but maybe not for everyone.|`|KBTk6V4Jaa	nope doesn't have to do with the hair. Put on some extra strength deodarent, but make sure it is anti-persperint (stops you from sweating) and put a lot of that on
ufgv7oTjaa	Lore is right that there are no supplements that suppress dreams, but I have done some research about why you may be having the problem.<br>  People remember and experience their dreams more vividly when they are almost awake. I have noticed this the most when I tried to move in a dream and I ended up moving my physical body instead... but I've used that to control my dreams to a point when I realize I'm dreaming, too. If you have nightmares on a regular basis, it just means that you are having more scary dreams, but you're just experiencing them more.<br>  I'm going to go out on a limb and say you probably take your B complex more at night, right? B vitamins are best taken more in the morning because they often interfere with sleep... there are some that help with energy and a couple that can stimulate the brain. It's very possible that taking some of the Bs at night is stimulating your brain enough where it's almost awake, but your body is asleep, so you experience your dreams more.<br>  <br>  What I would suggest is to take the Bs only in the morning and stay away from sugar, caffeine, and exercise at least 3 hours before bed. Also, if you watch any more pleasant shows on TV (cheesy kids cartoons that are about love and friendship often helps) before bed when your brain is awake like that will often influence more pleasant dreams, but your brain also works from everything that happened during the day.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't help enough, just remember that you are in control... if you take that control. In your dreams, everything has to listen to you if you make it. <br>  In my own dreams and nightmares, I have done all sorts of things. I have told really scary ghosts to go away, I have stared down some monsters and things that were chasing me, and I have even flown. Once you know it's a dream, you can control anything in it... give it a shot ;-)|`|uGFzzLYWaa	I can tell you from personal experience that eating ice cream before bed will give you nightmares. <br>  Also, sleeping in a cold room can contribute, but I'm not quite sure why.<br>  Of course, TV can be a factor, if you watch it before bed, watch something happy or non-violent. Avoid movies with disturbing images before bed.<br>  I don't know of any herbal supplement that you can take which will suppress dreaming, though.|`|DYQfxTl2aa	you can have nightmares for a lot of different reasons, night terrors are mischievous spirits who chase you in your sleep, all you know is you are running for your life, if you turn to look at what chases you, you blow its cover because once you look it knows you know it can't hurt you. Other nightmares can be about lifestyle or health, reoccurring nightmares are telling you to pay attention to something, it keeps coming back until you get the message or the incident passes. health reasons are water could be bladder/kidney problems or emotional problems,there are negative symbols which are good as in crying, bleeding, vomiting, shitting, urinating, all these things mean releasing negatives and letting go something along those lines,The best way to deal with nightmares is to understand them. Just remember to look at all the theories, Freud and Jung are both good, Tibetan medical dream analysis puts a different spin on it but they respect the latter. I did a seminar with Dr.Nida Chenagstang, he teaches all over the world. www.ngakmang.org, also there is a mantra to send back bad energies if you are getting too scared, clap hands 3 times and say DO DO(send back)JEW JEW(change transform)JO JO(eliminate)I hope this helps you.
xp8pmKOuaa	It seems like you enjoy foods that have a courser texture, something a bit earthier and rough.  The other foods you mentioned that you don't enjoy are a bit slimier, loose, and tend to slide.  It's not impossible to find things to eat with this diet, although you might want to try eating those things little by little to try to get used to it.  Crackers and chips might be something that you would like if you haven't already tried that.  Try uncooked veggies like carrots, but make sure they are drier on the outside so they don't feel as slimy to you.  You could also try eating variations of the foods you know you like. Perhaps taking foods and just making sure they are a bit dry would help; that seems to be what you are looking at.  If you can eat yogurt, that's always good as well as apples and grapes.  There are plenty of foods that you can look at. Sites like the Food Network have "Quick Meal"  lists if you are looking for varying recipes where you can input an ingredient and they will give you recipes involving that ingredient.  It's really up to you to taste and test foods and find out what you like.  You will never know unless you take a chance.|`|YinCD3VSaa	i have the same problem, i just normally eat soup, but really thin soup and bread|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	Maybe you just need to learn how to cook better

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|XwrxiKfBaa	Make sure you are doing cardio at the gym at least 30 minutes up to an hour. that's what really burns the fat I usually do that 5 days a week. 3 days a week I do about 35 minutes of cardio and then my strength training with core workout. Make sure you are not only working your abs but your obliques and lower back as well. If you find that the exercises that you are doing are too easy then increase by adding another set or doing about 10 more in a rep or both. the other 2 days I go to the gym I do nothing but Cardio. I do about 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours of cardio. While you do need to work your core to tone it you also have to burn off the fat which usually lays right on top of those muscles. Good luck I hope this helps you.|`|hVNVl6Ujaa	Unfortunately, the only immediate answer is surgery but it is far from the best answer,  You have to check your "healthy" eating plan. You will be surprised to find out how many people erroneously  feel their eating plans are healthy.  Fat percentage needs to be cut down, and watch the types of sugars you eat-especially high fructose corn syrup with sneaks its way into many seemingly healthy foods like fitness fruit yogurts. <br>    Diet is most of loosing weight so first adjustment is in this then you need to work on exercises that work on increasing your RMR-resting metabolic rate.  Jogging for long periods doesn't cut it cause you are increasing it only for short periods a day max, but more strenuous exercises will increase that rate by demanding more of the calories you take in for healing muscle.  Try sprinting instead of mere jogging.  Try doing exercises that incorporate more muscle groups (eg. lunges, squats, push-ups) Exercises that focus on isolating aren't as effective so doing a bunch of crunches is ok but you will tone your mid section much more by those other exercises I listed.  I know its long but it help me in my road to tummy trimming, hope it helps.  Good luck with your fitness|`|zBSPaC70aa	You need to do cardio + strength. For instance, you could run or jump rope for 15 minutes, then do abs exercises, such as crunches, leg lifts, side crunches, and lower back exercises like Cobra Pose. There is proof, however, that it also helps if your upper back is strong, so you should follow your ab exercises with push-ups - keep your hands open wide and tummy tucked hard. If you're doing it right, your abs will actually hurt while you're doing the push-ups.<br>  <br>  Also, you could do an 'abdominal hold'. What you do is sit on the edge of a chair, hands by your sides, then lift your feet a few inches from the floor and your butt from the chair. Hold as long as you can. It looks insane, but your arms and abs will feel the burn!|`|EN5AIqYeaa	OMG, I just tried this workout, the guy makes it look EASY!!!

AA10723498	Milligrams and milliliters are two different doses.  For instance, it takes 100 ml to make 1 Mg.  If his pediatrician said to take 40 Mg, then that's what you should give.  If you have doubts, get a second opinion.<br>  EDIT. If it were my child, I would give him the dose ordered.  Does he know why your child is anemic?  Just nosy I guess., but give the 40 ml, you're not overdosing, however, keep a check on his bowels as iron is very binding and could cause him constipation.  Ask the Dr, about that and what to give your son if he should become constipated.  I hope he's better soon.

RO5RlTLmaa	ah, when you are first starting to work out this will happen more often, I am not sure but for me I do not get so sore anymore.  Once you work out every body part and do cardio for awhile and continue to make gains during this long while the soreness stops...I would describe it more as a fatigue.  Even though I know I pushed myself.  So to answer your qestion more easily, it ought to be sore when you are beginning, as time progresses you should become less and less sore after a workout the next day (although you should still feel fatigue and feel a little soreness perhaps if you try to work the same muscle group)|`|cLGXa8O3aa	lots of things cause you to be sore the next day.  you may not have stretched properly and if you dont remain hydrated, you will be more sore the next couple days.|`|55c6bcdec944656754c033c36667ba6baa	Just because your not sore the next day doesn't mean you didn't get a good workout.

If your boss tells you that you will have twice the responsibility, an 80 hour week, and half the pay....... does it take you a week to get angry? or even an hour? No, you are suddenly angry. Win the jackpot, suddenly euphoric. Someone dies, suddenly sad. Rapid mood change...... Everyone has rapid mood changes, even extreme mood changes. But for a normal person these emotions regulated themselves, the extreme mood eventually returns to normal. Being bipolar means that the chemicals in your brain are sluggish when it comes to regulation. We have the rapid mood changes and emotions that everyone has but our brains don't know how to turn it off. When it does get around to turning it off it goes overboard..... sudden drop from mania to severe depression, then it over compensates again and you become manic again, down, up, down, up....... The average bipolar person will experience this "cycle" over a period of months or even years. Our brains just don't know how to keep the chemical levels level..... like a diabetic, their pancreas doesn't work..... neither does my brain.

KAnEq8Laaa	I would say your strength is average. It's not super-strength, but then again, you're definitely not lacking. You're thin, but at 5'11", not exactly tiny. I suspect you have what one would call a "wiry" build: that is, tall, thin and muscular. Such people are often surprisingly strong; you would think someone your height and weight would be weak, as well, but you're probably mostly muscle.|`|AA12386598	Strong, but the specs are inadequate for a physique assessment. As muscle weights more than fat, if the waist is under 34 the physique should be good. Problem with the typical pushup is that it works the lower pecs.

ZlfPl6B1aa	Actually, you want a birth control that does not contain the most hormones. =) It will make you have acne. (Pregnant woman--usually with girls--get AWFUL acne & they have TONS of these hormones!)<br>  <br>  The best birth control I have been on--that sort of contained my acne & did indeed make my boobs grow--was one of the birth controls with the least amount of hormones in it!

Not to mention there's no evidence that your boobs will get bigger while on it. Birth control is typically used for birth control (duh) and to regulate a woman's menstrual cycle, whether because of issues of cramps, cysts, flow, or irregularity. Side effects from taking birth control just happen to be clearer skin/more acne and weight gain/bloating. If you want larger breasts, it is likely the rest of your body will get bigger too.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'm on Yasmin and from talking to my gynecologist, this has a relatively high amount of estrogen compared to IUD and some pills. The high amount of estrogen actually bloats you. Yaz and Seasonale have around the same amount, I think. With Seasonale you just get your period 4 times a year because of the long periods of time you're taking the estrogen pills, not the amount of estrogen.<br>  <br>  Plan B has a high amount of estrogen in it, but you should know why I'm not going to recommend that.
ozWi3TJlaa	Doubting your self is common.  It happens to me sometimes.<br>  <br>  You should bring this up with your psychiatrist.

It's like once you voice your concern about the symptom, you feel like you're making it up or exaggerating it.  I think it's partly that it's very hard to explain some symptoms the way you understand them, hard to put into words I guess.  I think it can also be fear that makes someone feel that way, the fear of having told someone about a symptom, being judged, being thought of as "crazy".|`|T64zP6fgaa	You may need a new psychiatrist, when ever I have felt this way, it was becasue the person listening doesnt believe you.....   you should ask what he/she thinks, and what they are diagnosing about you, and if you dont like what you hear, leave and find someone else to talk to who isnt going to give you some horrible label<br>  psychiatrists only think one way... the way they have been trained, they arent right about a lot of things in my opinion|`|efJwIa7Yaa	I think at times everyone doubts their symptoms.

They say one thing, mean another and think something entirely different.  It's possible that this girl was just trying to fit in and was attempting to look cool by making fun of you.  There's no excuse for it, no matter what, but if you want to fix your "problem"  you can try to be more outgoing.  It's hard to change something like that right away, but if you think you want to, I would suggest the following.  First of all, maybe try talking to this girl, not as a confrontation, but as a friend.  Just because they are popular, doesn't mean they are any better or worse than anyone else.  If you don't think you can do this, or if it doesn't work, you can also just try to be more talkative.  Put yourself out there a bit more.  Bounce around, talk to people you haven't met before, be friendly, and maybe participate in gym, or class or sports or whatever it happens to be a bit more.  If you really think that you are too emotional, try to fix it.  Being around other people is a great cure for emotions run high because not only does it distract you from your own emotions by having something to do, but it also shows you that you aren't the only one with those emotions.  There are tons of people out there just like you, struggling against all the emotions that school and social turmoil brings.  Plus, being more outgoing and just talking to one person a day who you've never met before, and introducing yourself, well, you gain a new friend. Good luck, and remember that you are who you are and only you can change that.  Don't let what anyone else says get in the way.

Get some exercise, and most of all stop hating yourself.  Often when you hate everyone and everything, its really a reflection of self hate.

First of all, it's normal for young people to have ups and downs.  It's a traumatic time of life, and there are many pressures that adults would find difficult to deal with. Sometimes you may have a really hard week or two, and then things will pick up again.<br>  <br>  However,sometimes feelings of depression and despair are deeper and last longer.  Has something happened to make you feel this way?  Often a shock or upset, or a period of grieving, can make people feel very low, affecting their concentration and their performance in class.  <br>  <br>  However, it's also possible to feel blue without there being any defined cause.  If that is the case, you may have persistent low mood, verging on clinical depression.  <br>  <br>  In either case, it would be a good idea to go and talk to your doctor about how you feel.  Don't be embarrassed - depression is (unfortunately) very common, and they will have seen many cases before, and know exactly what medication to give you.  <br>  <br>  Do this sooner rather than later, so that you can supply medical evidence to your tutors that you are having a difficult time at the moment - the earlier you tell them, the more sympathetic they will be.|`|QZHMckOhaa	You need to quickly go over in your mind what might be happening in your life to cause this sudden change. are you upset about something? maybe you've been pushing yourself and you've simply burned out.<br>  dropped from straight A's to failing is not good though, so in order to stop this before you start to do some long term damage you should speak to a professional psychiatrist or something who can give you ways to improve how you feel if you can't make yourself feel better|`|h7uxxiZZaa	you need to see a doctor. you are severely depressed. you need to find a therapist who can help you understand why you are feeling this way. they may want to put u on meds to help ease the depression, but with the meds it may seem to take for ever 4 them to work but give them a chance and they will work. best of luck|`|EZHZW7QFaa	Exercise and be active - it's very therapeutic for mind, body and soul.

Once the day arrives, take time off school to see the psyche. If you don't feel comfortable with them (it happens) go back to your GP and ask for somebody else. If you trust them, be honest about every event and feeling of your life leading up to your recent failing and dip in moods. They will be able to create a plan with you - usually meds + meditation + therapy - to fix whatever's causing your depression.<br>  <br>  Hang in there! You WILL feel happy again at the end of this!

Everyone has highs and lows.<br>  <br>  The best thing to bring ppl out of a funk is to get outside, get some air, and get some exercise.

This would lead to the cause of feeling hearing loss. <br>  <br>  What you need to do is go to the doctor. They will fix it for you right there. Explain this and ask for the cleaning procedure. What they will do is put a cleaning solution in your ear with a cotton ball and have you sit with it holding it in for about 10 minutes. Then after the 10 minutes they will pump a little bit of warm/hot water in your ear. <br>  Then take a big ear syringe and suck out all the gunk. I know it's gross, will be and a little bit discomforting to feel. They will do this until your ear pops and feels a better difference.

"Sleep is necessary for general health, but it now appears that the brain needs sleep more than any other part of the body.<br>  School-aged children should be getting between 8.5 and 9.25 hours of sleep but many do not.

Secondary vasospasm (causing focal brain ischemia), meningismus, and hydrocephalus (causing persistent headache and obtundation) are common. Diagnosis is by CT or MRI; if neuroimaging is normal, diagnosis is by CSF analysis. Treatment is with supportive measures and neurosurgery or endovascular measures, preferably in a referral center.<br>  Consult a Neurologist.

To add on to this very true, very horrible yet not well-heeded fact, this cycle of weight loss and gain will ultimately be more harmful to your health than your starting weight to begin with.<br>  <br>  Like another answerer said, you are too young to diet. You're still growing up. If you diet at this point, you might not be providing enough nutrients for your growing body.<br>  <br>  Think about it - do you want to be thin, but crippled by things no young adult should have like osteoporosis? Do you want to fall on a pavement - and not get up because you broke your hip at 18? Things like that happen to women past menopause, not in the middle of puberty.<br>  <br>  People who are unnaturally 5 pounds underweight are more susceptible to diseases because of compromised immunity.

Choose lots of high-fiber foods, including fruits, vegetables, beans and whole-grain cereals and breads. Aim to consume 20 to 35 grams of fiber daily. Experiment to see if particular fruits or vegetables have a laxative effect for you. Remember to add fiber to your diet gradually to help reduce gas and bloating.<br>      * Limit low-fiber foods. Foods that are high in fat and sugar and those that tend to be low in fiber content, such as ice cream, cheese and processed foods, may cause or aggravate constipation.<br>      * Drink plenty of liquids. The exact amount of water and other fluids you should drink each day varies and depends on your age, sex, health, activity level and other factors. Limit caffeine intake, which can worsen symptoms of constipation by causing dehydration.<br>      * Exercise regularly. Engage in regular physical exercise, such as walking, biking or swimming, to help stimulate intestinal function. Getting at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week is recommended.<br>      * Heed nature's call. Don't ignore the urge to have a bowel movement. The longer you delay, the more water is absorbed from your stool and the harder it becomes.<br>      * Try fiber supplements. Over-the-counter products such as Metamucil and Citrucel can help keep stools soft and regular. Be sure to drink plenty of water or other fluids every day, or taking fiber supplements may worsen constipation.<br>      * Be careful about introducing stimulant laxatives. Habitual use of agents such as Correctol and Dulcolax can make your colon dependent on them and may require increasing dosages until your intestine ceases to function properly. For occasional relief try a saline laxative such as milk of magnesia, which draws water into the colon to lubricate the stool. Avoid giving children laxatives without a doctor's approval.|`|PHOyKsmPaa	I don't understand your question.|`|68LATsa0aa	hhmmm....nt goin 2 toilet or goin 2 da toilet alternate dayz is certainly nt normal.....<br>  your puttin on weight may certainly due to this reason n itz better for u 2 consult a doctor as soon as possible....gud luk!!|`|pfd5N3j4aa	sounds to me like you need more fiber in your diet, to have a regular cycle.

ZkwtldYlaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .|`|uXg8xJiwaa	Down syndrome, Down's syndrome, or trisomy 21 is a chromosomal disorder caused by the presence of all or part of an extra 21st chromosome. It is named after John Langdon Down, the British doctor who described the syndrome in 1866. The disorder was identified as a chromosome 21 trisomy by Jér?me Lejeune in 1959. The condition is characterized by a combination of major and minor differences in structure. Often Down syndrome is associated with some impairment of cognitive ability and physical growth as well as facial appearance. Down syndrome in a baby can be identified with amniocentesis during pregnancy or at birth.<br>  Individuals with Down syndrome tend to have a lower than average cognitive ability, often ranging from mild to moderate developmental disabilities. A small number have severe to profound mental disability. The incidence of Down syndrome is estimated at 1 per 800 to 1,000 births, although these statistics are heavily influenced by the age of the mother. Other factors may also play a role.<br>  Many of the common physical features of Down syndrome also appear in people with a standard set of chromosomes. They may include a single transverse palmar crease (a single instead of a double crease across one or both palms, also called the Simian crease), an almond shape to the eyes caused by an epicanthic fold of the eyelid, upslanting palpebral fissures (the separation between the upper and lower eyelids), shorter limbs, poor muscle tone, a larger than normal space between the big and second toes, and protruding tongue. Health concerns for individuals with Down syndrome include a higher risk for congenital heart defects, gastroesophageal reflux disease, recurrent ear infections, obstructive sleep apnea, and thyroid dysfunctions.<br>  Early childhood intervention, screening for common problems, medical treatment where indicated, a conducive family environment, and vocational training can improve the overall development of children with Down syndrome. Although some of the physical genetic limitations of Down syndrome cannot be overcome, education and proper care will improve quality of life.[1]|`|u7K70ww2aa	You know that you go through puberty until you are 18 to 21 correct? Most of the height growth does not occur until midway through puberty. I don't know how old you are but you can't really do anything to "grow tall" unless you have a medical issue. People aren't like plants you know. If your still young, you just need to wait to see if you get growth purts.<br>  <br>  However in some cases the growth hormone can be hindered. You can get treatment for this like my cousins did. But you would need to be in your lower teens or younger for this to even have hope of making a difference|`|VGeV0wt4aa	My friends don't tease me and anyone...<br>  I'm a little small too...<br>  and I know how it ugly to be smaller then your friends..<br>  every one told me this advice: to eat Corn Flex and to eat how much vegetables .........<br>  <br>  I want to be taller too... :@ ;( :(<br>  Listen my friend lets eat 24 hours maybe it will help us<br>  xD|`|1z9zl6kuaa	u should try to hang on poles it can increase ur height.

Vvd2BMn1aa	My Dad was diagnosed 2 years ago now. At first he was real sick, and was constantly breaking bones. Then last year he got a Stem cell transplant. They had to do a very aggressive chemotherapy and totally wipe out his immune system. But he made it through that and now he is in remission and living a normal life. He still has to go for monthly steroid infusions, but that's very minor. He is going on a new trial drug too. There is no cure, but with the treatments they do have, many people are living for a long time with this type of cancer.|`|K1UicE7kaa	There is a wide range of how this can play out... it is so individualized.  It depends how long they have had it and when it was discovered.  It can be staged and that gives some clues.  Getting 20 answers here will not provide you with "objective" information... so don't over-react to that.  Your grandad will be sent to an oncologist/hematologist... he/she will be your best source of information.  They will help everyone understand the details and the options.  Trials may offer hope or a chance BUT...are no guarantees and in some cases are worse than known treatments. <br>  <br>  The link below provides some basic information as a starting point.

If you don't have a counselor at your school, tell every teacher you have until you find one that will take decisive action.<br>  <br>  RIGHT NOW.<br>  <br>  After that, call her parents (yes, I realize you mentioned they treat her poorly). This is something they MUST know, however.<br>  <br>  It's a matter of life and death, and it is not something that a young person (even a great friend like you) can handle by herself. You need to take steps to insure your friend's safety.<br>  <br>  You don't want to be on Y!A tomorrow asking how you can best deal with feeling guilty that you choose to do nothing, and your friend killed herself. <br>  <br>  You get ONE shot at this.

Now i've grown up and realized I was a dramatic dumb teenager who wanted attention.<br>  She's not going to do it anyways but give her attention, what she wants anyway just in case and do what the first girl says talk to counselor, your parents and then have your parents call her parents. If her parents aren't listening to her they won't listen to you either. They know she is being dramatic, but if another parent is worried then they will take it more seriously. Hope I helped :)|`|RZ4dEGDUaa	I would recommend speaking to someone in the school with some authority such as: 1) a counselor you trust, 2) a teacher, 3) the school nurse, or 4) a principal.  They are all trained to assist students who are going through troubled times.  <br>  <br>  For example some students have family problems, school problems,...etc.  The situations may seem hopeless, but believe me someone will be able to help!

Don't overdo it with the selsun, that will aggravate your skin.  Pat dry your skin after shower, don't rub dry.  If you have a hair dryer, use the cool setting and gently blow dry all of the skin, making sure to concentrate upon getting skin folds completely dry.  Then apply a light layer of cornstarch (NOT talcum powder!) to the whole area, to absorb moisture during the day.  Do not use perfume or body oil right now, until the infection is gone.|`|EMbaak9waa	I sugest you go back to your dermatologist again and tell her whats happening.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Sorry to hear that you can't go back to the lady you saw.

IF you see him after work, or early in the morning before work. Every persons sexual peek is in the different times of day. Women are usually NOT able to get too aroused if there tired, it doesn't mean shes still not attracted to there man just the timings off. So its most likely when your listening to music, or shopping your up your full of energy and you may still have that arousal from the previous day built up but by the time you get home to see your husband your just wore out.Just like you see on sitcoms where the husband and wife are in bed, He pokes at her and she rolls over and says "not to night im tired".

AVzQs5Uhaa	Its usually caused by a fungus from what you are describing, it  may be embarrassing but its best to see your physician or podiatrist so that they can prescribe an anti fungal treatment.  Please see the below links for further information and some home remedies. Also make sure to keep your nails and toes dry from water, always wear clean breathable socks and rotate out your shoes so that they can air out from all the moisture(basically just means don't wear the same exact shoes every day)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.footsmart.com/HealthCondition.aspx?ailmentId=97" rel="nofollow">http://www.footsmart.com/HealthCondition...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.myhomeremedies.com/topic.cgi?topicid=266" rel="nofollow">http://www.myhomeremedies.com/topic.cgi?...</a>|`|AA11404742	First - I'd be careful of that first link.  It might be spam, or a virus site.<br>  <br>  This sounds like toenail fungus - the same thing targeted in the TV ads.  I have it on some toenails too.  My doctor refused to prescribe anything for it - he said that the medications that treat it are hard on the kidneys or liver, and I was better off to live with it.<br>  <br>  You can do a couple of things - first, when you trim your nails, trim the healthy ones first, then the infected ones.  You may prevent the spread of the fungus, or at least delay it.  Then disinfect the clippers with alcohol afterwards.<br>  <br>  The fungus develops when your toes are in warm, moist, dark places for long times.  Which is what happens when you have sweaty feet and wear shoes most of the time.  Try going barefoot, at least around the house, so your toenails dry out some.  Keep your feet clean, change your socks at least daily, and maybe give your shoes a spritz of a disinfectant, like Lysol.<br>  <br>  I haven't heard of a good OTC treatment, but I have heard people say that soaking their feet in vinegar for 10-15 minutes every day may help.  I'm trying that, and I may have a bit of improvement.  But I'm inconsistent at it, so it's hard to be sure.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that this isn't a huge health issue - it's mostly cosmetic, and your toes won't fall off or anything like that.|`|wKUst6Xyaa	That is fungus under the nail. I have it too. OTC stuff doesn't work. After you shower, apply rubbing alcohol to dry out the fungus. The doctor can prescribe medication that will work.

At this point, I would say if you would like to eat healthy, eat pb and whole wheat toast or some eggs in the morning for breakfast. Maybe some pork or chicken & some sort of raw veggie for lunch. And, whatever you want for dinner. You may have to force yourself to eat, I know I did, but you can do this!|`|MfzJROnJaa	omg wait. you are anorexic and 88?<br>  im 5'4" and i weigh 90lbs and i am worried that i might have an eating disorder...<br>  i think this settles it i must and i need help too...<br>  i cant answer your question apart from say eat healthy balanced meals 3 a day and excersise less seeing as im in the same kinda position now..<br>  thank you for helping me realise i need help!
249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	i. Eat more calories<br>  <br>  This involves some calculation. The approximate normal daily caloric requirement for an average male who performs light activity is 2,200; for a female, it is 1,900.You need to eat around 1,000 extra calories per day to gain less than half a kilo a week.<br>  <br>  Do the math. Eat larger portions and eat at least five meals a day.<br>  <br>  Your actual caloric requirement can differ depending on your height, weight, activity level and your body's metabolic rate.<br>  <br>  ii. Make smart choices<br>  <br>  For example, choose dairy products, Eat foods with high protein content such as beans, pulses and peas, and foods with high starch content such as potatoes, rice and tapioca.<br>  <br>  *<br>  One hour spinning = perfect body<br>  <br>  iii. Protein is important<br>  <br>  Increase your protein intake. Your body needs a lot of protein to build new muscle. But since most of the calories for weight gain comes from carbohydrates and fats, do not replace them with protein.<br>  <br>  iv. Snack a lot<br>  <br>  Consume a lot of high-calorie snacks (not junk food) such as cheese sticks, milk shakes, muffins, dried fruits, yoghurt and breakfast bars.<br>  <br>  *<br>  healthy Ayurvedic mantras<br>  <br>  v. Fluids help too<br>  <br>  Drink a lot of fluids that supply nutrients and calories; milk, fresh fruit juices and energy drinks are good examples.<br>  <br>  vi. Intensify workouts<br>  <br>  Aerobics are great, right? Not for weight gain!<br>  <br>  You need to exercise really hard and intensely to gain muscle mass.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Is walking better than running?<br>  <br>  vii. Weights are the way to go<br>  <br>  Focus on free weight exercises (which do not require machinery) that target your large muscle groups. For example, you need dumbells, not fancy gym machines.<br>  <br>  Free weights put the most stress on muscles and stimulate the maximum number of muscle fibres.<br>  <br>  The best weight training exercises for building muscle mass are free weight exercises like squats, dead lifts, bench presses, barbell rows, pull ups and bar dips.<br>  <br>  These exercises are best done under supervision, but they don't need machinery.<br>  <br>  viii. Space out your workouts<br>  <br>  If you have a high basic metabolic rate -- which means you expend a lot of energy even at rest -- you need short intense workouts instead of long periods of low-stress activity.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Are carbs bad for you?<br>  <br>  ix. Creatine?<br>  <br>  Creatine supplements can help some athletes gain weight. It is not known if it is because it gives them spurts of energy or because it adds water weight.<br>  <br>  More research is needed in this area before Creatine becomes that magic pill. Creatine supplements are available at all major health food stores, but do not take it without consulting your doctor.<br>  <br>  x. Be consistent<br>  <br>  It might take a long time, usually a few months, for the weight to actually show. Some people get frustrated and quit when they fail to see drastic results.<br>  <br>  Your body will only responds to a consistent schedule. No weight gain programme will work for you if you are not regular.<br>  <br>  Heredity does pay a major role in determining your weight. Effective weight training and a smart diet can help you exceed your genetically predetermined weight.|`|4QRGDL9raa	stay at home eat junks food and a lot of pork, do not run just play and watch T.V.
6akCILTQaa	Consult your teacher or anyother well wisher whom you know and with the help of them take your dad to counselling..  he needs to be given some good advices|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	wow yes it is|`|c42c8d31a8e4cbf5411d46cc0062566caa	As a kid I can understand your frustration, as I parent I can see the problems.  It is hard to put yourself in your parents shoes, but here are some things to think about.  Only about 5% of your class is really good at what they do and 5% are really bad at what they do, the rest of you just fall somewhere in between.  So we are a country that is full of average people. We are in a very rough economy right now and so your parents are trying to show you that average or less than average is not going to help you succeed in life.  Neither will playing video games.  It is good that you like to go hiking and get in the woods, but the truth is your dad and my generation didn't sit on the couch at home all day playing video games.  Most of us were banished to the outside to get some fresh air.  We rode bikes, played ball, climbed trees, and found things to do.  Sometimes that involved getting hurt sometimes that involved getting in trouble.  But we were outside and we learned independence from that.  Your generation lives on the tv, computer and video games and most often your school work suffers.  Talk to your parents, let them know you want to succeed but you often feel like a failure.  I know this may not be exactly what you wanted to hear, but your dad has a right to be upset with your scores under 70%, that means you got a D, and were only 10% shy of failing the test.  That is not a good place to be in school. You don't mention if you are in middle or high school, but if you are in high school you are setting yourself up to not get into college or many careers.  What your parents are trying to show you from this is that if you don't stand out, in this economic time, you will not succeed in life and things will be very difficult for you.  <br>  The other thing you may not realize is that your dad may be irritated with you because he sees himself 20 or 30 years ago.  That sometimes is a hard thing to swallow.  Good luck talk to your parents let them know you need their support, but understand that you may need to give up some things also to succeed in life.|`|QjP2qtSnaa	My dad treated me the same way when I was a kid.  I just realized that I needed to do the best I could in school so I could graduate and move out.  In the meantime though, I found other people to talk to about the issue.  A school counselor would be great, or maybe your parents might take you to a counselor if they thought it might help your grades.  You really can't change your parents, but you can learn to live with them until you can be on your own.|`|GiO4NYehaa	That is emotional abuse, I would suggest reading these books:<br>  <br>  1.

rF6iJHBTaa	Lol i got my teeth cleaned yesterday. I was so scared but dont worry. Ok so 1st the dentist checks your teeth.. then he uses this pointy metal thing to clean your teeth it hurts a bit but not that much. then its sort of like a vibrating brush it polishes you tooth and takes the junk stuck in the middle. But in the end once you rinse your mouth it feels good your mouth feels lighter and cleaner.It doesnt hurt...heres a tip close your eyes and think of something while the dentist is cleaning your teeth... it might feel weird once your done your mouth feels weird but GOOD LUCK....|`|48e80d4dffb6b005f6946b03af059d5eaa	Everyone is different, some have sensitive teeth and gums, so yes, it may be uncomfortable for the cleaning. For me, it doesn't hurt. They clean your teeth with the tools, floss, rinse with flouride and then your done. Of course, the dentist will come in and take a look to make sure you have no major problems!<br>  <br>  GL|`|vQmO3N6Raa	well it only hurts if you have sensitive gums, it hurts for me cuz i have weak gums, =/<br>  it doesn't hurt, they may chip your teeth a little, but overall it'll be ok.|`|5OkgNK5Naa	1. No it won't hurt, don't worry.<br>  2. For the normal patient it takes about an hour.<br>  3. No, they don't use drills, because they're just using metallic devices that scrape your teeth (like a metallic toothpick)<br>  4. They use metallic toothpicks as i said, they also used a metallic toothpick that has a little water spraying device in it, they floss your teeth as well, and they polish it with a metallic brush (it's round) and some bad tasting cherry thing.<br>  <br>  Ask your hygienist to talk you through it, so you don't feel as nervous.|`|AA11315360	It might hurt a little just because you havent had a cleaning before.

Good luck|`|eiCqpTqfaa	I think that having my teeth cleaned is the worst part of the dentist. I have terrible teeth; terrible genes. What bothers me about it is the heat from the cleaning tool. I much prefer having cavities filled or even a root canal to having my teeth cleaned. However, among my friends, i'm the only one who feels this way.|`|qp5EzzDjaa	it will not hurt. if you practice good oral hygiene you'll be out in about 20-30 mins. if not then an hour or two. and if the hygienist knows is going to hurt they will use topical anesthisia. dont be scared is nice to have cleanings. your teeth will be at lest 1 shade whiter when u r done. so smile
XTDeAfTqaa	Semen and sperm are not the same thing. Semen is a protein rich fluid which carries the sperm into the uterus. It is an environmentally friendly fluid for sperm which allows sperm to live longer thus giving sperm a better chance of reaching the female's unfertilized egg.<br>  Sperm is made in the testicles and semen is made in the prostate gland. They are mixed during the ejaculation process.<br>  That is why when even after a man has a vasectomy he will still have an ejaculation during sex but it contains no sperm, only semen.|`|8j7FCEOraa	C,um <br>  Sperm<br>  <br>  What comes out of a man's penis after he ejaculates.|`|6711a1d84892dbba34b6771f8ea24977aa	yeah,yeah! is dose guys on da boats !!!<br>  didja hear about da gay whales ?<br>  dey sneaks up on submarines and sucks out all da seamens !!<br>  hahhahahahahahahhahahahaha  oh.|`|dbXnW5emaa	Semen is the fluid which carries sperm.|`|GfG6wupTaa	I don't know.

LqvX5whyaa	Heya,<br>  You can absolutely go for a smear test if your still a virgin been a virgin wouldn't stop you at all, that i can reassure. If your hymen is still intact when you come to have a smear test then they can deal with this for you no problems. But do let them know your a virgin they will be extra gentle so it shouldn't be to painful for you. But means your a virgin let me reassure you it is very unlikely you need a smear test to begin with cervical cancer is very strongly linked to the human papiloma virus ( wart virus) which is exclusively a STI ( sexually transmitted infection). The chances of that occuring with you is very very remote indeed. You can certainly have a smear done if you wish but just tell the nurse to be gentle with you but its totally your decision how about having a chat to your GP before it goes ahead, that should be able to help alot.<br>  I hope i helped take care<br>  x|`|USsDzaIsaa	Why do you want one?<br>  <br>  If you're a virgin then it's unlikely that you would have the HPV virus that causes the majority of cervical cancers that the smear is testing for.|`|pjYQhPPBaa	Usually doctors recommend girls/women to start going to the gynecologist when they become sexually active and/or turn 18 years old.

nAp688tZaa	There are drug tests that can be performed that will specify the opiate in the system, and PM doctors use these tests all the time.  A lab will be able to tell the doctor if there is Oxycodone and/or hydrocodone in your system, and at what levels of concentration.  If you are prescribed one and take another, they can tell if they want to.  Sometimes, they will only test for the presence of opiates, but some doctors, like mine, test which type of opiate.  The samples do have to be sent off to a lab for most of these types of tests, but there are new urine cups with a strip on the bottom that can make the distinction between the two. I actually just took one like this today for the first time.  Mine came back positive for Oxycodone since I take Oxycontin, but the hydrocodone panel was negative.  These new tests can also test for the presence of tri-cyclic antidepressants, methadone, marijuana, etc. If my doctor wants to know how much is in my system, all he has to do is package up the cup and have it sent off to the lab for further analysis.  He says he gets the results back in 48-72 hours.|`|211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	"Dumpling" is correct. <br>  <br>  The only thing I can add is that if you have a prescription for the medication, bring it with you to the drug test (if it is for a job or something) and it will NOT count against you.  <br>  <br>  Mostly they are looking for drugs that are not prescribed for you and illegal street drugs.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA10063059	vicodin and perocet both contain codeine an opiate that's what they are testing for|`|NcgBKvUCaa	they will check for it, but as long as you have a good reason for it, don't worry about it

w5SIOM2Haa	A pound of muscle DOES NOT weigh more than a pound of fat!  A pound is a pound is a pound.  The mass of a pound of fat is larger than the mass of a pound of muscle.  For example, if you fill up a measuring cup with cotton it will weigh less than if you fill it up with steel ball bearings. <br>  If you keep doing what you are doing you will loose weight.  Not five pounds EVERY week, but you will lose if you count calories and exercise.  Don't weigh yourself every day.  It will fluctuate from day to day.|`|xL9EpNctaa	muscle weighs more than fat so your actual weight/number on the scale will most likely go up.

I was a size 6 after my diet and i am now a 4, even though i gained weight....

EQAwlKZ5aa	For someone who is 5'5 the healthy weight range is 8.5-11.1 stones & pounds. However, you mentioned that you are a swimmer, so the majority of your weight might actually come from muscle. Muscle mass weighs more than fat. So you don't actually need to lose weight. If you feel the need to, then do it the healthy way. As someone else said, do not lose more than 2 pounds a week, because if you do then you are losing muscle not fat! You also mentioned that you get hungry after your swim. Have you tried eating 6 smaller meals instead of three big ones and snacking in between? This will help keep you feeling full and will maximize your energy levels. But remember to pick meals that are high in protein and comlex carbohydrates. Simple carbohydrates will rise your blood sugar levels very quickly and cause them to crash very quickly also. This means you will be left feeling hungry a short while after your meal. You can eat grilled chicken breasts, tuna, beans and legumes. They are all packed full of protein. You can eat oatmeal in the morning, it helps keep you full. Eat lots of vegetables, fruits and nuts to get optimum nutirition. Keep your diet varried, without cutting any food groups (you still need fat to stay healthy).<br>  The most important thing to remember is to never lower your caoloric intake below 1500, and for you I wouldn't lower it under 2000 since you are a swimmer and you burn a lot. If you do lower your caloric intake then what will happen is that your body will go into starvation mode and start burning muscle and holding on to fat! So keep it in the range of 2500 calories. Stay hydrated.<br>  I hope this helped!|`|vGxipYJnaa	Good for you for setting a reasonable goal. You shouldn't lose more than 2 lbs a week if you want to stay healthy - so I'd say about a month is a good time frame for losing 9 lbs. Eat a handful of nuts after your swim - that should keep you full for a while.|`|7qffxf3Vaa	9 lb!!<br>  id shi* 9 pound
l4d1Vg2Vaa	I believe I'm right in thinking it's not contagious. It can be infectious, though, much like a cold.|`|AA12358000	Amber C,<br>  The brief answer is NO! I shall explain - Contagious is defined as “communicable by contact”. Pneumonia is not spread by physical contact, but by droplet infection which is an infection transmitted from one individual to another by droplets of moisture expelled from the upper respiratory tract. Pneumonia is an infection of one or both lungs which is usually caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The most common cause of a bacterial pneumonia is streptococcus pneumoniae. In this form of pneumonia, there is usually an abrupt onset of the illness with shaking chills, fever, and production of a rust-colored sputum. The infection spreads into the blood in 20%-30% of cases, and if this occurs, 20%-30% of these patients die. These cases of bacterial pneumonia are contracted by breathing in small droplets that contain these organisms that can cause pneumonia. These droplets get into the air when a person infected with these germs coughs or sneezes. In other cases, pneumonia is caused when bacteria or viruses that are normally present in the mouth, throat, or nose inadvertently enter the lung. Normally, the body's reflex response (coughing back up the secretions) and immune system will prevent the aspirated organisms from causing pneumonia. However, if a person is in a weakened condition from another illness, a severe pneumonia can develop. People with recent viral infections, lung disease, heart disease, and swallowing problems, as well as alcoholics, drug users, and those who have suffered a stroke or seizure are at higher risk for developing pneumonia than the general population. <br>  Other types of pneumonia are caused by, and include  - BACTERIAL= Klebsiella pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae: Mycoplasma pneumoniae: Legionella pneumoniae: Chlamydia pneumoniae: Pneumocystis carinii: VIRAL= adenoviruses, rhinovirus, influenza virus: FUNGAL=  histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis, blastomycosis, aspergillosis, and cryptococcosis. <br>  ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED, IN ANY FORUM AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS ONE. -  MANY ANSWERS ARE FLAWED.<br>  <br>  <br>  The information provided here should not be used during any medical emergency or for the diagnosis or treatment of any medical condition. A licensed physician should be consulted for diagnosis and treatment of any and all medical conditions<br>  <br>  <br>  I add a link with details of this subject<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a> <br>  Pneumonia<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  matador 89

X6BrtJ9eaa	It depends on the severity of the accident - how many people were injured, the nature of the injuries, etc. All accidents and incidents should be logged no matter how minor, but major incidents should be reported to the HSE immediately. If you have been involved in an incident or accident you could ask if it has been reported. If it hasn't and you think it was serious enough to be reported to the HSE and you are worried about pursuing it because you might lose your job, I would go to the nearest Citizens Advice Bureau and ask them what to do.

ItJzrvQ4aa	There are numbers of reasons why a person is not tall, and most of them do not<br>  have any effective treatment.<br>  Probably the commonest cause is genetic, that is to say that one or<br>  both your parents are below average height, or that short stature runs<br>  in your family. There is really nothing that can be done about this. <br>  The other cause that most people know about is a deficiency of growth<br>  hormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland situated at the base<br>  of the brain. If a deficiency of this hormone is discovered early<br>  enough in life, it is sometimes possible to give treatment with<br>  injections of growth hormone to increase height. However, by the time<br>  you get to 17 years of age, your bones may not respond to the effect<br>  of the hormone. The only way to find out if you have this condition is<br>  to discuss it with your doctor. Blood tests an X-rays to see how your<br>  bones are growing can usually make the diagnosis, but for treatment<br>  you would need referral to a specialist. These investigations should<br>  also show if there is any other cause for your short stature. <br>  But you should not think that it will definitely help you. Medical<br>  science can not make you the way you want to be - and it is true not<br>  only for height - so it's better to accept yourself as you are. Tall<br>  people are not necessary happier than short people - look at the<br>  tallest man in Ukraine, who was stripped of his title, lives alone<br>  with his mother, and has constant legs pain!<br>  The exercises they advertise on-line may increase your height<br>  temporarily for 0,5 - 1 cm, it's hardly noticeable and does not worth<br>  the trouble: your height varies during the day on its own.<br>  Very occasionally, surgeons will try an operation to lengthen the<br>  bones in the legs. This is very difficult, and takes many months or<br>  even years, and a series of operations. It is a dreadful operation,<br>  and I mentioned it only because you may have heard of it. Never<br>  consider mutilating yourself for a miserable increase in height, and<br>  be happy as you are.|`|g2h6qUUXaa	you can't make yourself taller by exercise and diet your genetics will determine how tall you will be|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Nothing.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.

If you want them.|`|W0a6EHb1aa	Targetted weight reduction is quite tough, some peeple would say impossible, nevertheless the one diet that really delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a few free trials left, it has been featured in Fox News and USA Today.

Also don't diet, just watch the calories and how much you eat.<br>  <br>  Don't do anything technical, just calorie count as much as possible (don't even need to do it that much though).

When I was 15/16 i was 5,10 and 180 pounds,one year ago I was  6,0  140lbs and 18 years old and have stayed the same since. This was mainly due sitting at home playing computer games and eating junk food when i felt like it.|`|g2h6qUUXaa	don't diet your think enough|`|yiux97Wbaa	Actually baby jade, <br>       you really aren't fat.  At 14 years old, you will probably grow some more, maybe you might not get much taller, but girls tend to fill out until they are about 18.  If you really think you are over weight, have a body fat measurement done.  That's what's really important.  What you weigh can be somewhat subjective.

It could be inherited as well or you could have bacteria in you or even worms of some type. If this is a regular occurrence then get it checked out.  If it happens with all food groups then something could be going on inside.  Maybe you could eat more foods with fibre if you don't already. Or you could just have a very metabolism!|`|YpbalqPKaa	yeah its very fast but if you don't sweat you will gain lots of pounds|`|HUWW6UJwaa	That depends on your diet but it very well could be your metabolism but the kind of food you eat too for example carrots have something inside them that made your more full for longer so depending on what you eat you could stay full longer.|`|v1GmMNoXaa	you probably do have a quick metabolism. <br>  <br>  however another factor may be that you are not eating the right foods. are you eating whole grains and vegetables? protein and fat are more filling too.<br>  <br>  try modifying your diet and see how that works...
BG8vMyZjaa	During exercise your breathing and heart rate increase. Exercising flat out, a top-class athlete can expect to increase his/her breathing rate to around 40 to 60 breaths a minute. This means they take in an incredible 100 to 150 litres of air, extracting around five litres of oxygen every single minute.<br>  <br>  Even those of us with more modest goals need to double our lung intake when we exercise. Our lungs must be able to respond to our body's increased demands for oxygen.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	You will maximize your lungs capacity.|`|X5Ren2D7aa	You will improve your lung function which will in turn help you combat illnesses and diseases and lower the risk of you developing a chronic lung disease.|`|FQiqtP33aa	Strong Lungs. so less chances of resperatory diseases.

Cervical Cancer... well every woman is at risk. <br>  <br>  If you are really worried you have to tell your mum, and I'm sure the question of "have you slept with anyone" will pop up, so be honest.... it's a part of the risk you take for having underage sex unfortunately....<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|9EuUBe4zaa	first of all the vaccine again cervical cancer will work and does work even if you have had sex.<br>  <br>  Well done for being careful<br>  You need to ask yourself when does the pain occur<br>  and if any activity you are doing may cause it.<br>  <br>  The i would either go to a young persons sexual health clinic,<br>  each area you live in will have one and you can find your nearest with opening times online. Just search for you area on NHS choices.<br>  OR<br>  see your GP about it.<br>  Personally I would go to a young persons sexual health clinic<br>  as it is more private and more specialist and it is to do with the general area not just sex.|`|AA11697703	go to the doctors, if they think you need one they will give you a smear and it'll be totally confidential, it might be something else

If the ring-free interval has been extended beyond 1 week, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered, and you will need to use an additional method of birth control (such as condoms or spermicide) until you have used NuvaRing? 7 days in a row. If you know or suspect you are pregnant, do not use NuvaRing?. See your doctor as soon as possible.|`|a7755f42f69cefa52515f7b509e000ceaa	I heard this does happen a lot. I'm on the ring too, but I'm only on my 2nd one. <br>  <br>  I think it's because the hormones stay in your uterus wall after you take the ring out, but from what I hear it's completely normal.

Modern antidepressants work well for most patients with endogenous or true biochemical depression. However they are also often tried in exogenous or situational depression where they often fail.<br>  <br>  Some doctors find it hard not to blur these definitions. Without doubt situational depression responds very much better to therapy rather than medication.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	It can take quite a long time for any drugs to work I would give it another 3-4 weeks and if you have not noticed a difference then return to your doctor.

0TT5q0cUaa	As far as slip disc is concerned there are few treatment options available.<br>  <br>  <br>  Conservative treatment - This is the most likely course of action for most patients. Treatment options include rest, traction, back strengthening and flexibility exercises, short wave diathermy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, weight control, steroid injections in step by step order.<br>  <br>  <br>  If a patient does not get relief after 8 to 12 weeks of conservative therapy surgical intervention is considered. The most common surgical procedure is a discectomy, which involves removing the soft gel-like material in the disc. This procedure returns the disc to a more normal shape, relieving the pressure on the nerve. The surgeon can also perform a foraminotomy, which is a procedure designed to expand the opening the nerve travels through.<br>  The approximate cost of the surgery would depend on the hospital you decide to get operated.

cWuumdy7aa	Backache was Vikhroli resident Satyawati Aarekar’s unwanted yet constant companion for the past seven years. The 60-year-old housewife found it difficult to even climb to her third-floor flat without her lower back radiating pain towards her leg. Ozone therapy, introduced in Mumbai, came as a welcome relief for Aarekar, who had tried everything from bed rest, ayurveda and accupressure in the hope of finding relief. <br>  Aarekar underwent the out-patient procedure atBombay<br>  Hospital, at Marine Lines, a few months ago and was thrilled to be back on her feet. ‘‘The pain is gone 99%,’’ she said. Called ‘ozonucleolysis’, or ozone therapy, the treatment is ideally recommended to patients who suffer severe disc problems. It simply involves injecting ozone (purified form of oxygen) into the affected disc, and promises almost instant relief from excruciating backaches. <br>  ‘‘I was afraid to get a surgery done for my spine. I have seen friends around my age undergoing operations for slipped disc and taking months to recover,’’ said Aarekar.  ‘‘Ozone therapy is recommended to patients with slipped disc; those cases in which the nerve roots get compressed radiating pain to the leg,’’ said Dr Dhaval B Modi of Bombay Hospital’s interventional neuro-radiology department, who, along with Dr Sharad Ghadge, helped Aareka  It doesn’t require an incision, has no side-effects and shows results in at least 85% of the cases,’’ said Delhi-based spinal surgeon Dr Vijay Sheel Kumar, who is the president of the World Federation of Ozone Therapy and has been using the therapy for the past three years.

However, you should also let your body rest a day between workouts.<br>  <br>  What I suggest is you do lower body one day and upper/core the next. That way your body gets a chance to recuperate and will actually give you better results.|`|7JDA7m7Laa	It CAN build up muscle, but if you try alternating exercises you won't see as much bulk.

Also for inner thighs, lay on your back with your hands under your lowerback/butt area and lift your legs straight up in the air between your chin and hips. slowly open your legs, then slowly close, do as many sets as you want. Ive been doing these exercises for 3 weeks now & I can tell my legs are getting more toned, NOT BULKY.  Good Luck!|`|hVNVl6Ujaa	No, it is very dependent on the amount of weights you use when doing your lunges and what protein intake you have after completing your exercises.  They will help tone your legs and your core for sexy abs. Who does want that? Good luck with the fitness.|`|kQbjCKNHaa	no|`|IuUQHinqaa	yes..believe them|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	If you want nice legs take up ice skating.|`|XwrxiKfBaa	If your like me then it would be true. You have to know what your body will do though. It's better to do low rep sets say like 10 or 15 lunges and so 2 to 3 sets but you don't want to constantly push yourself cause then your leg muscles are gonna get huge. Also you should not do this more than 3 days a week and make sure you are alternating days. So say like you only do lunges on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday....your muscles need time to rest. this helps build lean muscle which will tone and burn the fat off your legs without making them huge.

LPO8RlVdaa	Forget about losing weight. Just adopt a healthy lifestyle.Eat a good healthy diet and excercise a lot!!! The more excercise you do the better!<br>  <br>  For a healthy diet, you need to be eating small to medium meals regularly. 4 or even 5 times a day. Each meal (apart from breakfast which should preferably be fibre rich), should contain a balanced ammount of carbohydrates for energy, (from potatoes, rice and pasta, etc) protien (from fish, chicken, occassional red meat is fine, soya is good too) and plenty of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants (simple fresh fruit and veg). Eat like this and make sure you are well hydrated (fruit juice is as good as water, any fluid counts, but some fluids have negative effects too, such as alcohol or caffiene rich drinks.)<br>  <br>  Now for the science bit: Protien is essential for repairing muscle and keeping the muscle you do have healthy (this includes your heart, lungs, brain etc). You naturally lose the ammount of protien you have throughout the day (through urine etc) so this needs to be replenished regularly on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  Carbohydrates are essential for energy. You won't be able to function without it. It also regulates body fat and glucose etc.<br>  <br>  Vitamins and minerals are obviously essential for a variety of reasons. For normal growth and development, for the healthy maintenance of the cells, tissues, and organs that make up our bodies, and also to let us efficiently use chemical energy provided by food.<br>  <br>  You can have a wide range of healthy meals with this, from Thai, Chinese, Italian, British, Indian, etc. Just make sure each meal contains balanced ammounts of these three. On the bright side too, fresh veg and rice and pasta is a lot cheaper than crappy junk food!<br>  <br>  This doesn't mean you cant have chocolate or pizza/takeaway/etc, just save them as very occassional treats.<br>  <br>  The big secret to keeping a healthy weight and staying healthy is EXCERCISE, particularly cardio excercise. <br>  <br>  Cardio exercise includes any form of excercise such as running/jogging/swimming/cycling etc that gets your heart rate pumping and you sweating and out of breath. It will not only burn calories and reduce your body fat levels, therefore making you 'slimmer' by having less fat on you, but will also improve your resting heart rate and lung function, making you healthier. <br>  <br>  I cannot understate the importance of cardio excercise. It is this which will basically burn the body fat off you. <br>  <br>  But you have to remember that once you have shed a bit of fat you have to have a nice toned body underneath the fat to show off. <br>  <br>  Strength training will help you strengthen and tone your muscles. This is done with the use of weights or by free training.<br>  <br>  There are essentially (without getting overly complicated) two types of strength excercises based on different types of muscle fibres depending on wether you want to build size, bulk and power, or just 'tone' up the lean muscles an get more muscle endurance.<br>  <br>  Heavy weights with short reps/sets will build your fast twitch muscle fibres and build size, power and strength. Imagine big guys at the gym lifting heavy weights. <br>  <br>  But if you use light to medium weights with lots of reps/sets you will excercise your slow twitch muscle fibres, you wont build size, but you will tone up your body and train muscle endurance. This will obviously make you 'look' healthier and more toned, but will also increase your metabolism (as your muscles demand more energy) so you will burn calories faster. These muscles are also excercised a lot with cardio workouts (i.e your leg muscles when running).<br>  <br>  Your arms for example, will need bicep curls and tricep dips using weights and reps of your choice (heavy - low reps, light - lots of reps) and also shoulder excercises such as holding the weights at your waist and lifting them perpendicular to your side or in front of you, etc etc.<br>  <br>  Your stomach will need excercises that cover the entire torso. Leg raises for your lower ab wall, crunches, sit ups and planks for your upper and all over ab wall, oblique twists for your sides and superman stretches for your lower back for example.<br>  <br>  These are just basic examples, there are literally hundreds of excercises, but it is impossible to show you on a site like this, get a trainer at your gym to show you some but remember the basic rules of muscles and weights. <br>  <br>  As far as excercise goes, you should aim to strike a balance between cardio training and strength training, this way you will build good strong and toned muscle, but also keep your body fat levels down and increase your heart and lung performance, making you much fitter and healthier.|`|F8EnH6JQaa	TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  the first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your boy adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  If man made it, don't eat it<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  Walk your dog, or walk a friends dog<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

Instead of eating like 3 slices of pizza cut it down to 2 instead.  Just eat one helping of food instead of 2.  Eat wheat bread instead of white.  I did these things and it helped out.  Just do little things and you should be able to tell a difference over time and its not such a big change that its hard to stick too.  It becomes habit after a couple weeks.  When it comes to exercising try to just be overall active, maybe for fun stuff go bowling, swimming, or something active instead of going to the movies all time.  Actually shopping can also be good, could cost you though, but it definitely wears you out I am dead after a shopping trip with my G/F.

Drinking eight glasses of water is almost like a must. And do not forget to drink water in the morning, the moment you wake up. In fact this is one of the most rapid weight loss tips that the dieticians suggest to the people. <br>  Have organic foods for the breakfast like apples, bananas, plain yogurt, tomatoes, carrots, peppers, raw honey, wild smoked salmon, and so on. <br>  Keeping a track on the watch, go for an hour walk. It need not be power walking, but definitely it should be non-stop walk and that’s for sure, in a couple of days only, you’ll start finding the difference in you. <br>  Another tip regarding how to lose weight fast, easy and safe is that you should have your dinner about 4-5 hours before going off to sleep. <br>  The two-point program that will ensure the ultimate success is: regular exercise and balanced diet. <br>  Don’t depend upon fat burning diet supplements. They wont go a long way in helping you sustain your reduced kilos. <br>  Soft drinks cannot benefit you in any way. They contain 150 empty calories, so if you substitute one bottle of soft drink with water each day, it will do wonders for you. It will enable you to lose about 16 lbs per year. <br>  Sometimes boredom becomes a cause of overeating, so keep yourself busy. <br>  If you want to seriously control your weight, then you have to stop yourself from getting lured into trying tempting foods. <br>  As important is to pay attention to the fact that we eat the right food, equally vital is to keep a watch on the quantity. Without altering your diet plan, even if you’ll reduce 5-10% of your consumption, it will prove beneficial. <br>  Eat slowly so that you can get a feeling that you have had enough food and your tummy is full. Eat slowly and fully relish the taste.|`|zNn9VfRyaa	to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions

As with all new diet regimes, the following applies:-<br>  1. Motivation is very important - do you really want to lose weight? Do you have a plan - how much weight, by what date?<br>  2. No starvation diets, just make sure you eat healthily. No junk food. Lots of fresh produce (vegetables, fruits). Less meat. Make sure you vary the stuff you eat so that your weight loss will not plateau<br>  3. Important to exercise. I don't mean extreme exercise. How about dancing to your favorite CD for 1/2 hour each day? What about walking your dog? The important thing is to make sure you get your heart rate up when you exercise.<br>  <br>  My understanding is acai berry is a really good diet supplement but I doubt it will work if all you do is eat acai berry and sit and watch TV the whole day with a tub of ice cream.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|aaShreV2aa	hello pretty and pink.personally i tried the new acai burn product and has shed me more than a few pounds more than i expected<br>  this is the product i got from this site.it offers me a free trial with an option to extend it.<br>  <a href="http://safeweightlossanswers.com/acai-berry/acai-elite-review" rel="nofollow">http://safeweightlossanswers.com/acai-be...</a>|`|fsY8PL66aa	I tried the acai berry pills, and it didn't work :( I didn't lose not even a pound..Sorry it may work for you.

Look for the MSDS (material safety data sheet) for your specific laser ink. The MSDS is a government required document which your ink manufacturer is required to provide for their products. <br>  Here is the MSDS info for HP laser ink: <The ink used in .."HP laser printer cartridge" should not be inhaled or come into direct contact with the skin.

If in case the product is inhaled by accident, or perhaps swallowed or come into contact with the skin or the eyes, immediate first aid treatment is necessary. If the eyes are affected, the ink should be flushed out with warm water. Washing the affected area with mild soap and water usually works when the ink touches the skin.><br>  Tip for next time to reduce exposure to toxins: drink a glass of milk before changing ink, wear safety goggles and a dust mask, and disposable gloves and long-sleeve shirts.

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call.<br>  <br>  www.xattack.in|`|Xp5lgKWOaa	Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Drinking eight glasses of water is almost like a must. And do not forget to drink water in the morning, the moment you wake up. In fact this is one of the most rapid weight loss tips that the dieticians suggest to the people. <br>  Have organic foods for the breakfast like apples, bananas, plain yogurt, tomatoes, carrots, peppers, raw honey, wild smoked salmon, and so on. <br>  Keeping a track on the watch, go for an hour walk. It need not be power walking, but definitely it should be non-stop walk and that’s for sure, in a couple of days only, you’ll start finding the difference in you. <br>  Another tip regarding how to lose weight fast, easy and safe is that you should have your dinner about 4-5 hours before going off to sleep. <br>  The two-point program that will ensure the ultimate success is: regular exercise and balanced diet. <br>  Don’t depend upon fat burning diet supplements. They wont go a long way in helping you sustain your reduced kilos. <br>  Soft drinks cannot benefit you in any way. They contain 150 empty calories, so if you substitute one bottle of soft drink with water each day, it will do wonders for you. It will enable you to lose about 16 lbs per year. <br>  Sometimes boredom becomes a cause of overeating, so keep yourself busy. <br>  If you want to seriously control your weight, then you have to stop yourself from getting lured into trying tempting foods. <br>  As important is to pay attention to the fact that we eat the right food, equally vital is to keep a watch on the quantity. Without altering your diet plan, even if you’ll reduce 5-10% of your consumption, it will prove beneficial. <br>  Eat slowly so that you can get a feeling that you have had enough food and your tummy is full. Eat slowly and fully relish the taste.|`|wGTisY1aaa	You cannot just do sit-ups to help get rid of love handles or make your stomach flat, and you cannot get thinner thighs by just doing workouts for your thighs. If you were to look at a muscle anatomy picture, you will find that what we call love handles are simply our gluteus medius which goes up and connects to the external obliques and goes down to and forms the gluteus maximus which is connected to your lats. Doing the following will help with the entire area to tighten and tone up your muscles and help burn the fat around them. Hope all of this helps do lunges, step-up kickbacks, walking downhill, running, leg raises without weight or very light weight, yoga, push ups, lat pull downs, pull ups rowing, and deadlifts. All of this combined with a proper diet full of lean protein and carbs, and you should be in business. If you need anymore help email me. Do 3-4 sets and 15-20 reps of light –no weights at all.<br>  Stomach                                             <br>  Bicycle<br>  Reverse sit-up<br>  Seated knee lift<br>  Pelvic Tilt<br>  Scissors open crunch<br>  Low Back<br>  Stiff legged dead lift<br>  Rear leg raise<br>  Swan<br>  Superman<br>  Stomach and Low Back<br>  Lower body toner/ stability ball<br>  Side plank<br>  Plank<br>  Knee in, leg push back<br>  Legs<br>  Pile squat<br>  Step up and downs<br>  Standing still lunges<br>  Inner leg raises<br>  Outer leg raises<br>  Plank hip dips<br>  Side crunch (for your obliques)<br>  Weighted side bend<br>  Hanging side leg raises<br>  <br>  These are good for the lower ab area to help bring in the pouch that most people have.<br>  Lower ab exercises<br>  <br>  Hanging leg raises <br>  Scissor crunches<br>  Reverse crunches <br>  Laying down leg raises<br>  Bicycle<br>  Pike and extend<br>  Pilates 100<br>  Seated knee lift<br>  Pelvic Tilt<br>  Bridging<br>  Seal / a Pilates move<br>  Any Pilates because it works on core stability<br>  Stability ball pelvic roll<br>  This along with 3-4 days of cardio training keeping your heart rate up to a good  level. This also helps keep your muscles lean and trim. However, you must do some weight training to build the muscle. The more muscle you have the more calories you burn which will also eventually help get rid of excess fat.<br>  My workout routine<br>  I do a push pull workout on most days. 3 days a week i do strength training and the other 3 I do  65 minutes cardio moderate speed (3.5- 3.7)for walking on an incline of 1-2. For running, I run at a speed of 4.5-6 mph on an incline of 0-1, with 1 minute of warm-up before I run at 3.5 mph and for at least 5-10 minutes to cool down afterward. I stretch as well for approximately 5 minutes. I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, lightweight and high reps (15-20) and 3-4 sets. To build muscle, 2-3 sets and 10-12 reps. All beginners need to start with 1-2 sets and 8-10 reps with lightweights. Remember to stretch after your workout to keep from cramping up.10-15 minutes of stretching is optimal. This workout can be done all at once or like you would do 2 a days.|`|IYEJZImgaa	Avoid fatty foods, sweets, rice & sugar. Practise yoga & surya namaskar daily. daily 108 cycles of surya namaskar will help you reduce fat & burn excess calories. It is disfficult to do 108 cycles from day 1, after a week's dedicated practise it should be easy. trust me this helps|`|dpzMzPhLaa	put down the fork, fatass
aHPDAqw0aa	This is very normal. Most women will have irregularity in their periods at some point in their lives. What you need to do is go to your doctor and ask them to put you on birth control. one day my period started and it went on for 7 1/2 agonizing grueling weeks (after week 4 one of my female coworkers brought in a red velvet cake with pink icing and strawberry ice cream for my "one month aniversary" it had become a running joke....all the guys started to eat the food and asked why she brought it in, we told them to finish first before we explained all the red). After I went to my doctor she put me on birth control and my period has been regular ever since and I absolutely refuse to go off of it for fear that it will screw up again. Best decision I ever made. Time for you to make it.|`|mgeuli7Naa	If you've just started your period then it could be totally normal.|`|aLuM3CxOaa	Definitely see an OB-GYN but prior to that keep track of the amount of flow, and any other symptoms, eg. cramping, pain, etc. This way you have documentation that will help your OB-GYN with his diagnosis. You didn't mention your age or previous history. We don't need to know this, but of course your doctor will. He will probably ask about the onset of menarche (when your periods started) and a history of your regularity. <br>  Don't panic; hormones, stress, and nutrition  can all be influencing factors. First and foremost, schedule an appointment. If for no other reason, to relieve your mind.<br>  Best of luck to you.|`|5Tzm6P97aa	I've had the same problem. I used to have 3-4 periods a month and they were all heavy. You will wanna see if it happens again next month, if it does you could become anemic from the iron loss. I suggest if it happens again go to your doctor and talk to him/her about birth control. I use Yasmin and it works.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps :)
211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	My best bet is that you have strep throat because you say that you have the white spots that look like blisters, but I'm going to put up the list of ALL the things it could be:<br>  <br>  1.Swollen lymph nodes<br>  2.Mononucleosis - "The Kissing Disease" - immune disorder<br>  3.Tonsillitis<br>  4.GERD - a stomach problem - the blood would be coming from there<br>  5.Epiglottis - swelling of "lid" of the windpipe. <br>  6.Measles - vaccine-preventable disease. <br>  <br>  I only put these up because that's the seriousness of the nature of the blood issues with the throat.  I would suggest that you see a doctor immediately for a throat culture.  Like I said, it is probably just a case of strep which is easily treated with a course of antibiotics.  Right now, you are highlycontagiouss to friends and family.<br>  <br>  Good Luck & Feel Better!!|`|2xS1Jro7aa	I am pretty sure that you have Strep Throat you should go to the walk in clinic they will give you antibiotics for it. You are very contagious so you should not go to school or anything. Good luck!|`|oyFlcOOWaa	idk what is called in english, its down of your throat, so what you have to do, just have vicks or something similar called spa something, you dont eat the bills, you keep it in your mouth till it its gone, keep taking vicks till you no longer feel the pain, it may take you day or day and half, not longer than that
sTdlAMv7aa	It's a natural fear we guys have about being adequate- even if we aren't measuring ourselves for ladies.  There are lies on both sides, saying size doesn't matter or that it's supremely important.  No, size doesn't matter much toward sexually pleasing a woman, though women (& men) can be cruel & seize upon any insecurity.  However, size does matter simply in how fast a woman might get aroused when she sees your penis (assuming the sight of it arouses her).  Other than the few size queens out there, it probably won't be a problem for you. <br>  <br>  Your friend could have been lying/joking about his size.  Many men self-report larger than they are- even on penis size surveys.  When measured properly, the average size turns out to be 5 or so inches long.  Could it be that your friend is simply more confident toward girls (regardless of his actual size), which makes them more apt to like him?<br>  <br>  Regarding your question about sexual enhancement, some methods can be dangerous &/or ineffective.<br>  <br>  Stretching the penis using weights can cause you to lose girth (width) even if you gain some length.  It will probably also make erections less strong & contribute to erectile dysfunction.<br>  <br>  Penis pumps can be useful for obtaining erections but can be dangerous for enlarging the penis beyond its normal size.  They can cause swelling & disfiguration initially, which goes down after a day or so but may have some lasting negative changes on the appearance of one's penis.  Also, pumping can cause the tissue to impinge upon the urethra, causing urinary problems.  Overpumping (pumping too frequently or with too much pressure) can also cause damage to tissue & difficulty getting erect.<br>  <br>  Drugs/supplements like Enzyte stimulate blood flow but don't put pressure on the penis to enlarge beyond normal size.  Additionally, some sexual health aids like Yohimbine (sometimes advertised for male enhancement) have been found potentially dangerous due to the way they increase blood pressure & cause other adverse effects.<br>  <br>  Surgery can make one's penis appear longer because it makes more of the dorsal part of the penis visible, but it can likewise interfere with erections.  At best, most men claim 0-1 in increase in size after surgery.  No doc will do that for you at your age.<br>  <br>  The only drug that could/would cause penile growth is dihydrotestosterone (DHT), & is only used in those who have testosterone deficiency &/or genital growth delay (where penis size is less than 3 in erect during/after puberty).  DHT requires a doctor's prescription & is very difficult to get unless "need" exists (DHT is listed as a schedule 3 controlled substance).<br>   <br>  Lots of average sized guys do quite well with ladies.  Maybe you could take mental notes of how your friend approaches girls to see what he does that stokes the flames of attraction in them.|`|RtmfVevbaa	He is probably guessing at his length! Most girls have not had a penis longer then 6 inches, and very few guys have ***** longer then 7. It takes a porno director 100 men at casting call to find 2 with a penis longer then 7!

Science hasn't explored everything that is possible yet...not even close.|`|kENdoYaUaa	Calm down there, buddy. You are much too young to be worried about the size of your penis. First of all, a bigger penis isn't going to help you get a girlfriend. Second, you still have a few more years to grow. Third, 5" isn't that small for a 15 year old. <br>  Most importantly, though, male enhancement isn't proven to work.<br>  I felt the same way about my penis size when I was your age.

They are a rich source of iron due to the size of the portions eaten as many people can consume up to 200 grams of meat per serving. The table shows some foods of plant origin to contain very high levels of iron such as the herbs or breakfast cereals however, be aware that these foods are eaten in much smaller portions rendering them a lower source of iron rich foods than those of animal origin. <br>  <br>  There is a comprehensive list on the site below|`|dtRkn4Jlaa	<a href="http://www.foodshighiniron.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodshighiniron.com/</a><br>  <br>  The above site has all information about foods with iron, iron deficiency.

UkMbzNLlaa	A doctor's nurse told me about this and it WORKS !  Get  cheap all aspirin.  Make a paste of water and crushed aspirin and apply it on wart. Then  wrap with a band aid.  Or soak in a solution of aspirin and water. <br>  <br>  We have removed many a warts with this. My daughter had bad planter's warts and soaked daily with the water/aspirin thing and they went away.<br>  <br>  If you read the wart medicines they contain the same active ingrediant as aspirin. <br>  <br>  PS Spray a lot of lysol, use anti bacterial soap in the shower and at the hand sinks. Wipe down surfaces with a lysol like solution.  I have been through this with my kids. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	sounds like it's time for a visit to the doctor.  warts are symptoms of a virus, so you need a cure forthe virus, not just to continue clearing up the symptoms.|`|0F8hauikaa	I can share a natural remedy that worked great for me. I read about it somewhere and figured what do I have to lose, but the wart, which I did. You will need a banana peel so it helps if you like bananas. Take a piece big enough to cover the wart and put the soft inside part against the wart and cover with tape or a band-aid. Change it daily and let air out in between. It will eventually start turning sort of blackish and eventually fall off in a week or two. Mine bled a little at the end but that was my fault for rubbing it to see if it was loose but now I can't even see where it was and it hasn't come back in over a year now.|`|qxWoiRHwaa	You can just use regular duct tape from your hardware store. MAke sure<br>  you cover the whole wart with very sticky tape. Warts need oxygen to grow, block the air with tape and the wart will start to die very quickly. I learned this through personal experience, but check out the reference below for a detailed explanation. This is incredibly simple, easy, no chemicals and totally works!|`|15e4b23d09e63ca5a1ecc092fae0dadcaa	Freeze Away works wonders.

If that doeasn't work, which it probably will, go to your Dr. and he can burn them off.|`|xwZV9jgPaa	try the freeze away stuff. if that doesn't work as your primary physician to refer you to a dermatologist.

Nk876YgJaa	Its not nasty if you are not immature.<br>  <br>  First and foremost, if you are not having sex it might not be a huge deal.. but if you are having sex you should contact your doctor just in case it is a STD. You do not have to tell your mom that your having sex initially.. Just tell her about the bump, and that you would like antibiotics.. Then when you do go to your appointment, be honest with your doctor about what is really going on- because Herpes and Genital Warts are serious business.<br>  <br>  If you are not having sex, it probably is just like an acne spot or ingrown hair. Those do occur from time to time. It might be tender because of its location. They usually go away in 2- 3 weeks, and are not so extremely painful or itchy that you can not live your life normally. I wouldnt recommend trying to pressuring it to burst.. Though it might take down the swelling, it will also make the spot more painful. However I would reccomend trying to keep the area clean to prevent it from becoming worse.<br>  <br>  If you notice more occurring, then it might be a yeast infection or such. If you have antibiotics at your house, I would recommend using them to kill the bacteria. <br>  <br>  I would not bother it too much and I would give it a few weeks to get smaller. If it doesnt.. then I might seek medical help.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  And BTW moms really are not so bad about that kind of stuff. Shes had those problems in her life too.|`|Tp795k5taa	Its probably an ingrown hair. Get a wash cloth and put warm water on it and use it as a compress. This should go away in  a few days in teh mean time make sure your undies or your pants to rub against it because that will make it hurt a lot worse.|`|NWTfFEuVaa	You need to go to a doctor because it may be an STD.

AA10595322	i read in a magazine that acai has 10-13 times the same amount of "good stuff" as found in red wine. Acai has one of the highest antioxidant counts of any food in the world, meaning it will fight those nasty free radicals being created in your body. Ever heard of "juice fasting"? Ok, well lets use logic here: if you pick an acai berry and eat it, it is more fresh and is still "alive" right? Ok, so now lets pretend you pick that berry, dry it out, turn it into a powder, and let it sit in a pill jar for a year. Which way do YOU think is healthier? Fresh juice of course.
AA11185479	Take a deep slow breath.  Let it out slowly and evenly.<br>  Do it again.<br>  And a third time, slowly.<br>  <br>  Stay aware of the fact that your anxiety is making things seem worse than they really are - that's what anxiety does.  So you're healthier than you think.<br>  The best way to deal with anxiety is to stay mindful and calm, and to take action on the problem.  Meet with your doctor to discuss treatment options, and meet with him regularly to go over your progress - not every medication or treatment will work for you, or work perfectly the first time.  Have him write out an assessment of your condition, so you can remember the name and specifics of what is wrong.  Get referrals to specialists who can treat your back and your anxiety.<br>  <br>  Personally, I suggest finding a good chiropractor in yoru area.  Many chiropractors are not very good and don't really know what they are doing, but there are some very good ones who can do a lot of good for your back problems.  Unfortunately, the highly skilled ones are usually NOT the ones approved by your insurance.  Accupuncture can also be helpful.  Try it for a few months - if it doesn't help, move on to something else.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend signing up for a mediation or yoga class.  This will help you train your mind to be calm and aware - you will be aware of the panic and able to control it, instead of it controlling you.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Spasm just means that the muscles start clenching on and off for a few minutes.

If they are serious and causing spasms they can most certainly cause tension headaches.  Tension headaches can in turn cause anxiety and depression.  You should go to a doctor you trust and tell them about your depression, and ask them if this is caused from any medications they may have given you, or if you should consider starting depression medication.  If you have felt like this recently, such as after starting a new medication, then it could also be coming from the medication--it just might not be the right one to work with your body.  Talk to a doctor, explain all this to them, and they should be able to help you decide what the best thing to do is.|`|3bpwLPxjaa	I think your real issue is your back.  Are you going to get it fixed?  Are you going to physical therepy?<br>  <br>  Anxiety and tension headaches are bad, but you can control the issue.  Mood stabilizers would be a good thing to consider.  Try to find a way to calm yourself down.  Some people exercise, meditate, read, sing, anything that can help you feel better.  Dont be scared.  I it sounds bad, but that just feeds into your anxiety.  take a conrolling stance against this. research it and get a grip on it.<br>  good luck.|`|1364158fc69b4c92c96d96e7cc321d56aa	Sweetheart, I am going through the same thing.

To get a cleaning and two fillings done should take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half -- depending on the placement of the fillings and how good your dentist is.<br>  <br>  But yes, you will feel the needle go in, but as I said, more uncomfortable than painful -- and it only takes a second.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps =)|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	for the most part it is numb, you may feel some pressure when they put the needle in, but if they know what they are doing it shouldn't hurt. if it does hurt, then it's time to find yourself a new dentist. i hate going to the detists, i wish they could just put you to sleep and do all the work. hahaha|`|48e80d4dffb6b005f6946b03af059d5eaa	you will more than likely feel a small poke in your gums, but nothing terrible. I, too, am not a fan of getting shots in my mouth. Just recently had wisdom teeth pulled and 4 regular teeth to prepare for my braces and it actually wasn't that bad.<br>  <br>  GL|`|a1KqdXLXaa	You will likely still feel a small pinch as the needle pierces the tissue, then a slight sting, as the anesthetic is injected, but some people don't feel it at all and some dentists are better at it than others.  The time frame for the cleaning will probably be somewhere around 45 minutes, the time for the fillings is more difficult to determine as it depends on how big the fillings are, each could range from half an hour to an hour.  You could call the office and ask the receptionist how long your appointments are, she would be happy to tell you.|`|ckYbgSgtaa	tiny tiny bit|`|yl0CZsy2aa	the needle isnt a problem|`|qp5EzzDjaa	well the pain depends on the hand of the dr. if he has much experience you wont even need the topical anesthetic. but with some drs. you might feel a pinch. youll be ok
DBj8Hj8kaa	Wow I am sorry that you are so stressed out! I can totally understand. You have been going though a lot! What sort of help do you want? There is a cool website that has articles that always cheers me up, its <trueeducation.org> you can search for articles by subject. You can message me if you need to talk!
WA65IQ0kaa	yep<br>  <br>  if you can't walk on it id advise you go to the docs or even better a hospital if they are willing to just take a look at you its not good if you cant walk on it is it?
w9Xm69nxaa	no. i believe if you sleep without a bra your boobs start to sag.|`|Gr2TgvNyaa	Yes and no.<br>  Unlike what people say, sleeping with a bra on will not stop breasts from growing. But, it can interfere with blood circulation and easy breathing. Also, if your sleeping with a bra to preserve your perkiness, sleeping with a bra does not affect the shape or perkiness of your boobs.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|BOuPi3wDaa	No, I sleep with a bra all the time.  My doctor says it's completely safe.  The myths that it causes cancer or makes your breasts smaller are just that-- myths.  If it makes you more comfortable, you should wear one.  I personally just don't like feeling exposed and not supported.|`|UoONXXLbaa	I think it is actually good to some degree.  I believe it gives support counteracting gravity.  However I do know all your body parts need airing out.  Just think about nursing mothers.  They have to wear a nursing bra at all times.  So it cant be that bad...right?|`|yCYw735Aaa	if it is tight and is a push up then yes because it blocks your airway a bit.  if you want to sleep with a bra on, buy a bra that has no wire and isn't too tight.|`|rNUB8B6Vaa	Although it may be more comfortable. You dont want saggy tatas. No theres nothing wrong with it.|`|Tp795k5taa	I have slept with a bra on for 10 years and have never had a problem.|`|bet4Cugjaa	I've been told it can effect growth?<br>  But i'm pretty sure that's not true, it's not bad to sleep with a bra on. I do.|`|KAVLHokbaa	No. I have always slept with my bra on. My boobs hurt if I don't. lol!|`|RJHB8TvOaa	nope - i do it sometimes <br>  <br>  Nina x|`|ki8sTOTcaa	no its just stupid and uncomfortable.|`|fslABgDnaa	Umm, no!|`|NUPJ9DiKaa	nope|`|w7P1NWi7aa	uumm no people do it all he time|`|ft8t98Pnaa	no... I feel more comfy when I sleep with one on...|`|AA10389562	I do it all the time but my wife doesn't.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Yes, it is, but that means it's a bad thing if you do it 'routinely' (every night).  It's actually a bad thing to wear anything to bed, because the body needs to 'relax totally, to breathe' and it's when most of us are asleep that we can take the time to do this.  A bra 'pushes the breasts up and out' and they will start to 'sag' much worse if you sleep in one frequently.  I was taught that wearing a bra would keep my breasts 'perky' ... but I had some very serious surgery on my back and neck when I was 21, and it hurts to wear a bra for long even now, so I simply stopped wearing one.  I'm now overweight, 58, and have 'heavy breasts' ... but they don't 'sag' much at all because my muscles are doing what most bras do.  So, it's totally up to you ... which means more to you ... comfort, perkiness, sexiness or?  Make up your own mind and your own decision ... and the 'future' of your breasts is up (or down) to you!|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Not unless it cuts off circulation.<br>  ANd you should wash it often.<br>  <br>  When I was young, I slept with mine on.....I was afraid to take it off.|`|zaYGRmOAaa	If you're laying next to me, then yes, it's a horrible idea...lol|`|8n3NvYQwaa	heck no it will keep them from sagging later on in life....   Grant M|`|kNscpF4Faa	I don't sleep with a regular bra but I will with a sports bra it is more comfy...I want them to have good support always so I wont get to much saggy boobs when I am older..(I am 30 years old now and have had 2 kids and it has worked for me so far)|`|bf5084d1ec35330c95ff7b7bd883bbffaa	If it fits too snugly, it will restrict your circulation and that's certainly not beneficial, but if you sleep with a loose fitting one, it should be fine.|`|GIxctDDuaa	Actually NO. They say you should because sleeping without a bra makes your boobs sag faster. It is uncomfortable at times (if you were wired bras) but in the end if you don't want saggy boobs fast. You'll wear one.|`|Y2yiyVuSaa	It's acceptable (from the medical profession).|`|H7UphlLCaa	not if it's comfortable and well fitting<br>  i always sleep in a bra * pretty much *|`|AA11664117	umm idk i sleep wt a sportsbra on it more<br>  comfy to me than a regular one when sleeping|`|hYP6akCYaa	it wont effect ur growth but most people dont (i do)|`|bqFk1du8aa	I dont see why it would be.
0F8hauikaa	The doctor is right, "roughing up" the wound encourages new tissue growth. Also be sure you are getting an adequate amount of protein in your diet, which is also conducive to tissue growth.
gkqmrIAGaa	Michael it sounds like it is very possible but nobody here can diagnose. You must talk to your school counselor or your mother. There are simple tests that can determine whether or not you are. You could have one or both but only testing will show this. Please don't worry about this and obsess about it. Have yourself tested and you will know. If you are either there are plenty of safe medications that can help you. Without getting a diagnosis you are just going to suffer more with the symptoms and the worrying about it. Please do this. I wish you the strength and courage to take the next step and talk to a teacher or counselor about this they can have you tested.
5ZKqU2sIaa	I am in the same spot but I am not thinking of it as losing weight I am thinking about it as getting healthy( nit getting diabetes, heart attacks, etc.) I think when someone says that I have"jelly" on my stomach it kinda makes me feel like WTF! I have beem working out and eating right! BUT now I think when they say that I take my anger out on working out! It helps because when you are mad that someone just called you fat you will work 14X harder! So but try not to let it get you down cause I have tried this so many times someone would say I need to lose a little weight and I would just give up like I have tried and it didn't work so I should just give up, but a couple of days ago I started it back up and I am not going to quit! (p.s I am thinking about becoming a personal trainer when I get older)|`|tIldpr7vaa	no u have to be obsessed on a certain level to achieve a fit healthy body.<br>  <br>  U must be obsessed with ur diet and obsessed with exercise, other wise u may cheat or get lazy. I really think most people who are in top physical condition are obsessed. People who arent obsessed are the ones who cheat on their diets and skip workouts. <br>  <br>  A little obsession is a good thing, just a as long as it doesnt start interfering with your life badly.|`|tOZTJVpoaa	Yes, I'm currently going through the same experience, not that I haven't gone through it b4,lol.........the only thing that always used to work for me in the past is substituting a glass of cold milk for dinner, & cutting down calories on breakfast & lunch,& about half an hour or so of aerobics every other day............nothing too strict though,coz that'll be harder to stick to........oh,& don't forget to leave urself 1 binge day/meal (whatever works for u) per week,otherwise u'll quit the whole thing in 2 weeks or something like that.......trash the journals & measuring cups, & keep the scale stashed away & only weigh urself once a week before breakfast.........the trick's in commiting & compliance,nothing else'll help if u can't make urself do that...........best of luck!|`|CWVBfaPwaa	I'm tired of these people above me with their "check this website out" comments<br>  <br>  Anyways, I'm the same way you are! It's frusturating to be doing so much to lose weight and then step on the scale and see that I gained a pound! I've been taking measurements instead, because I do know that muscle weighs more than fat. Maybe you've lost inches and fat but gained muscle? Have you measured yourself (waist, hips, thigh, arm, bust?)|`|rp372bcYaa	Ah yes, you sound like me.<br>  <br>  Not that im trying to advertise for this website but once i started useing sparkpeople.com<br>  <br>  i started dropping weight like crazy. You put in your weight size, they tell you exactly how many calories to eat per day (and meal plans if you want them), exactly how much excerise to do and how many calories you need to lose a day to reach whatever goal you enter. Plus its very interactive with people and is a GREAT support system.

BOuPi3wDaa	This is a good indicator that your hormones are a little out of whack.  It's nothing to be worried about, although it sounds like you're really uncomfortable.  I would suggest talking to your doctor.  Your doctor will probably recommend birth control pills.  They help regulate your hormones and straighten thing out.  Good luck!|`|AA12385489	No.<br>  <br>  See a doctor about it.|`|037gXpUvaa	my friend had that happen to her and she had an std, im not saying its that, by you need to go see a doctor, it might be something else in your body causing that. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|fslABgDnaa	Have you taken a pregnancy test?

I felt like the biggest a-hole around because I had to live with my mom and dad for a year to pay off debt and have them help me with my daughter who was 6 at the time.

UJ4heej6aa	1. When I was 9 years old I was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma. I was given a 1/3 chance to live. I have now been in remission for 8 years (I'm 19 years old now).<br>  2. No, I am not a member of any ongoing support groups. However, I do sometimes participate in the annual walks for Make-a-Wish because they granted my wish when I was sick. They sent me to Hawaii to stay in the Hilton Waikiki with my family and gave us a rental car, free hotel stay, sent us on a snorkeling cruise and a helicopter ride around the island. I also got to swim with the dolphins at Dolphin Quest :)<br>  3. Absolutely. Being able to talk with and connect with someone who has gone through the same thing you have is amazing. Nobody else is ever going to understand what you've gone through. It's something that has to be experienced firsthand to be completely understood. <br>  4. Drip poles suck, I used to call mine R2D2. They're like a robotic dog...always following you around on a leash. Hospital food sucks. Make sure someone can bring you Taco Bell every once in a while :) You'll probably experience weird cravings (I always wanted a bacon cheeseburger REALLY BAD for some reason).The nausea from the chemo is terrible. Orange juice is a bad idea. Drinking lots of Sprite and 7-Up helped me. The dye they inject you with for the CAT Scans makes you feel like you peed your pants, but don't worry, you're just imagining it. Everything about being in the hospital can be depressing and discouraging, but if you try not to take everything so seriously, it won't be so bad. It may seem like the end of the world now, but sooner or later you'll get through it and when you look back you'll be thankful you didn't fret too much over the little things. It is okay to cry, everyone does it. Boredom is a definite problem in the hospital. Bring handheld games or movies. And books, lots of them. The nurses will wake you up anywhere between 4AM and 6AM for X-rays and blood tests. Be forewarned. If you have any other questions, feel free to email me :) There's no way I could possibly write all of my advice down here on Yahoo.|`|P544Sbmqaa	1.  AML which is a type of leukemia.  <br>  Terms: The most notable.. first and foremost what AML means.  Neutropenia.  Hematopoetic.  <br>  2.  I am in a couple of different online support groups.  I answer questions here, mainly pertaining to leukemia, bone marrow transplants and stem cell research and cord blood (part of my treatment was a hematopoetic stem cell transplant (fancy name for a bone marrow transplant, but with a broader meaning) using cord blood).<br>  3.  Sometimes.  I am younger than most cancer patients, and even though the medical issues are more or less the same, the social issues surrounding cancer can be different for an older person than a younger person.  I was 21 when diagnosed, and I more or less lost the majority of my friends because they had never dealt with anything so serious and didnt know how to handle it.  That isnt really a concern for most older people who have already dealt with major issues or severe illnesses either with themselves or their parents or someone else close.  So, sometimes, its nice to have someone already know what page I am on without having to explain everything or without feeling like a downer for talking about it.<br>  4.  My insight is that its very easy to get caught up on internet horror stories about cancer and treatment.  Some treatments are worse than others, and point of view has a lot to do with how a person will tell their story.  My advice is to be proactive about your health (cancer patient or not).  KNOW what your docs are talking to you about.  If you have to write it down, then do so.  If your doc doesnt explain something clearly, demand they explain it until you can walk out and explain it to someone else.  Check your doc orders to make sure they are correct.  Ask the nurses to explain what they are doing and why.  Check your meds and dosages.  Docs and nurses are great, but are still human.  If you know whats going on with your health and treatment, its another layer of checks and precautions on top of what they do.<br>  <br>  My funny story....   When I was diagnosed, I was admitted immediatly.  It was the first time I had ever been admitted in my entire life.  I was hooked up to an IV and it was the middle of the night.  The IV pump was plugged into the wall, and I didnt realize that I could unplug it and move around.  A lab nurse came in to draw blood.  Not realizing she was just the lab nurse, I was telling her that I needed to use the bathroom.  She just looked at me like I was weird and told me to go ahead and go.  So, i was like, well does the IV have to come with me.  And again with the weird look, she said yeah, and then left.  I was baffled.  I ended up urinating in the trash can beside the bed.  It was hilarious.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	1) Osteogenic/ Osteosarcoma ( one of the bone cancers)  <br>  New words and terms: Osteosarcoma, Van Ness rotation, methotrexate, MRI, PET Scan, Wal Motion, and the other usual crap<br>  <br>  2)  I'm not currently a member of any support group. But I was involved with the Canadian cancer society, and I still do events with the Terry Fox foundation particularly the runs. <br>  <br>  3) Really I don't feel that close to most cancer survivors. My experiences are drastically different from most childhood cancer survivors. I used to go to a Cancer survivor camp every summer and while I have lots of friends there I didn't have much in common with them. I lost my leg as result of my cancer and I ended up having surgeries almost every year though out elementary school. I do feel close to other bone cancer survivors but as sad as it sounds I was the only one involved in cancer survivor related groups and activities. <br>  <br>  4) I remember in High school one of my friends said everyone has cancer once in their lives.

4uInub7laa	You are most likely having panic attacks.  To have PA's you do not have to be in a stressful situation or be upset about anything.  I used to have them also.  I used to take effexor fx.  It is an antidepressant but it also helps with the pa's.  PA's for me were very scary it would happen at home or even in the grocery store.  At that time I was 19 I did not have any insurance either.  You can go to a regular family doctor. And pay the regular patient fee usually around $30-45 and then the prescription cost.  The meds may be a little expensive so ask the doc if he has any samples.  Doctors always have samples all you have to do is ask.  If you still don't think you can afford the patient fee try to find a mental health clinic around your area. I am not saying you need mental help but this is what I did I found a mental health clinic and they are normally income based.  They can give you the med at either a very very low cost or nothing at all.  I hope this help you.  Good luck|`|VjJJSvxnaa	during panic attacks, there usually isn't a reason to be panicy. that's why they're so scary. i take zoloft for pa's. it helps.|`|wkK5JDz4aa	carry a brown paper bag to breathe into.|`|67ea71af780ce95553f2ddb1eddee690aa	You might have mitral valve prolapse.

Insomnia is a symptom, not a stand-alone diagnosis or a disease. By definition, insomnia is "difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or both" and it may be due to inadequate quality or quantity of sleep. It is typically followed by functional impairment while awake. Insomniacs have been known to complain about being unable to close their eyes or "rest their mind" for more than a few minutes at a time. Both organic and non-organic insomnia constitute a sleep disorder.<br>  <br>  sounds like u may have it...|`|U5CLIhYgaa	I would say your going to sleep to early.  I go to sleep when I am tired, so I always fall right to sleep.  Not an easy thing to force yourself asleep, so why try, just don't even go to bed till your eyes are drooping.<br>  <br>  Also, don't take this the wrong way, masturbation is one of the best sleeping pills in the world.  Most doctors suggest it before actually taking meds.  Puts you to sleep quick.|`|KFuyBR8qaa	No, if you had insomnia you'd be up practically all night. Try relaxing before you go to bed, no cell phone, tv or music. I have a hard time falling asleep sometimes and take these pills that aide in falling asleep.

You have a fistula on your gums, and basically what that is, is a drainage hole for infection.  One of your teeth is infected (or abscessed), when the pus builds up it finds a way out of the tissue.  When your gums were sore, the pus was building up which creates pressure, when the fistula popped, the pus and pressure were released, thats why the pain went away.  You need to see a dentist, the infection will not go away on its own, and the tooth needs to be treated.  Your options are:  root canal or have it pulled.
u6ExZKkJaa	I get the same way and have been that way for months, but I can't use the nasal sprays, I've been taking allot of Theraflu!! And that only helps a little!  So, I feel your pains, and hope it will end soon!|`|ae282ad4a748f8c85406e4649235ff16aa	I use inhaling menthol crystals in steaming water with a towel over my head when it gets bad.

Xp5lgKWOaa	Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Drinking eight glasses of water is almost like a must. And do not forget to drink water in the morning, the moment you wake up. In fact this is one of the most rapid weight loss tips that the dieticians suggest to the people. <br>  Have organic foods for the breakfast like apples, bananas, plain yogurt, tomatoes, carrots, peppers, raw honey, wild smoked salmon, and so on. <br>  Keeping a track on the watch, go for an hour walk. It need not be power walking, but definitely it should be non-stop walk and that’s for sure, in a couple of days only, you’ll start finding the difference in you. <br>  Another tip regarding how to lose weight fast, easy and safe is that you should have your dinner about 4-5 hours before going off to sleep. <br>  The two-point program that will ensure the ultimate success is: regular exercise and balanced diet. <br>  Don’t depend upon fat burning diet supplements. They wont go a long way in helping you sustain your reduced kilos. <br>  Soft drinks cannot benefit you in any way. They contain 150 empty calories, so if you substitute one bottle of soft drink with water each day, it will do wonders for you. It will enable you to lose about 16 lbs per year. <br>  Sometimes boredom becomes a cause of overeating, so keep yourself busy. <br>  If you want to seriously control your weight, then you have to stop yourself from getting lured into trying tempting foods. <br>  As important is to pay attention to the fact that we eat the right food, equally vital is to keep a watch on the quantity. Without altering your diet plan, even if you’ll reduce 5-10% of your consumption, it will prove beneficial. <br>  Eat slowly so that you can get a feeling that you have had enough food and your tummy is full. Eat slowly and fully relish the taste.|`|03g0WSvZaa	try the Baby Jack workout <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKCGe2Ezris" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKCGe2Ezr...</a> it is fun and it works
lPZudPkUaa	I would remove as much of it as I could with a nail clipper,   then CAREFULLY file off any sharp edges, then put a bit of vaseline on the nail (not your whole finger) and apply a band-Aid over the whole thing. Keep cutting off as much as you can and changing the Band-Aid daily until there is no chance it will rip off. <br>  <br>  It's a pain in the butt, but MUCH better than the pain of having the nail rip off. The Vaseline is so the Band-Aid doesn't accidentally stick to the nail and rip it off - would kinda defeat the purpose.|`|7cUDstdjaa	Cut it back as far as you can without hurting yourself. Put a plaster over it for a few days and it will start to grow out|`|pXPdO2I8aa	Tape it down so you don't catch it in something that rips it off.|`|DlAPD2UNaa	It would be best to carefully cut it off. Don't pull it because it would make it worse. You just need to make sure you get the broken bit off because it could catch on something. It will grow back in no time. Also, if you bandage it up then when you pull the bandage off it could pull it off.xx|`|SkzKyc6daa	buy some nail glue! its same as what you use to stick fake nails down with,but file the glue down once its gone hard so its not just a big blob|`|N9U8KFCMaa	say wow dats hurt lol i would deffo bandage it up  so u cant catch it and totaly rip it off trust me dat hurts|`|PJgaWErQaa	Put antibiotic on it and keep it bandaged.

dLFpdOndaa	You need to do enough weight so you can do no more than 8 reps.  If you can do more than 8 reps the weight is to light if you want to increase strength.|`|8SRjELNBaa	enough to feel the burn.. de de deee :P|`|aeVz0lrBaa	best option is to find a weight that you can only do MAX 6 reps with. <br>  <br>  i.e. do bicep curl but ensure you can ONLY mange 6 reps. (the 6th should be 100% effort to achieve)  Then try and do 10 sets (5 sets on each arm) - right arm, followed by left arm, so you rest each arm in between sets.<br>  <br>  by the time you hit the 4th set you may only be able to do 3-4 reps, which is great - you are taking your muscle to fatigue - which is the way to build muscle.<br>  <br>  if you can do 10 , 12 , 14 reps and still carry on then you will struggle to build muscle bulk (great for endurance, but not building bulk) you have to fatigue your muscles to build them up.<br>  <br>  bear in mind that above advise is a VERY general example and doesn't take into account proper rest periods or diet, which are both important aspects of building muscle..<br>  <br>  do be carefull.|`|ptDkPkd8aa	Any weight where you can do a maximum of 6-10 reps. Lets take a bench press for example if you max out at 305 lbs (I really don't know that kg) a good number would be like 275 about 9 reps for maximum chest gain. Dumbells the same 15kg (i guess that's about 32 lbs) reasonable for a fit teen, you would curl until you hit that maximum of about 8 reps for arms. YOU NEED THE weight to be heavy enough so you CANT do a 9th rep. heavy resistance means muscle
5OkgNK5Naa	I would recommened going to a dentist that specializes in prevention (like my dentist) and he'll want to fill it first to see if that works for your tooth, if it doesn't he'll have to do a root canal, which only take about an hour and has basiclly all the same procedures as a filling, so it's not that scary|`|pbWFNsv9aa	most likely|`|VC7PyH53aa	Usually you won't need a root canal until after the dentist fills the cavity. <br>  In my experience all of my root canals were due to the dentist filling deep cavities. <br>  Apparently they have to drill deep and that damages the nerve.<br>  <br>  All you can do is get the tooth filled and see if down the road you start to experience pain in that tooth. If you do that will tell you that you need a root canal. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and keep your fingers crossed.|`|bJrT3EzQaa	It would be best if you go to a dentist. If it's not hurting then you might get a filling but you most likely will get a root canal.

It is a protein shake with vitamins and minerals.Study in intervals between naps. Take several 20 min naps if you can't do 2 hours. It'll help you a lot. Make sure you set an alarm. You might not sleep heavy in those 20 min intervals but your body and mind will get some rest. Rest is what is important. Eat healthy if you can't get the spirutean. You'll be surprised how well you do on your test. And stay off the PC. It won't help you. It will take your focus off your studies. It is also time you could use to take a nap. Eat plenty of carbs and protien.

It has been shown that when you eat single ingredient foods (e.g. and apple is an apple. A chicken breast is a chicken breast, etc); that your body can better process and utilize the nutrition. This will quickly help you gain muscle (if you're doing heavy weights). Be sure to take carbs too (complex).|`|70oOsU6Vaa	No xplode is just sugar , l-arginine, caffeine, and some sort of flavoring ....Its over priced and its ****. You could have a shake before you train because you want something simple that can easily get into your system( thats if your in a hurry) if your not ,eat a meal 3 hours before you train and your energy levels will be up.....In this meal have a lean protein source such as a chicken breast and a sweet potato. After your training session have a shake with a simple sugar such as dextrose. You want this sugar to restore glycogen that you depleted during training and in turn this will get your insulin levels back up to normal because studies show that insulin levels go down during training. Within an hour after training have a meal. This will keep you lean and in time will lead to muslce growth.

ZkwtldYlaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .

FSuHBCMHaa	I would look closely at your diet first. Hair is 95% protein and if you eat junk food your going to feed your hair junk food. Eating a healthy diet full of healthy food goes a long way to providing your hair with the vitamins, proteins and minerals it needs. If you smoke at all cut it out.studies have shown smoking restricts the blood flow to to the follicles. You can take supplements for you har as well as a preventive measure. they not only provide proteins and vitamns for the hair but contain DHT blockers to prevent DHT being produced, which is the major cause of hair loss.|`|fecUjSr1aa	never been my problem but, baldness is hereditary, its in your genes. some guys start losing their hair in their late teens.<br>  <br>  there's these commercials on tv or mags about Rogaine and the other hair restoration solutions. you could try them and see if you might be able to save your receding hairline ..|`|MClFrDE1aa	Baldness is strongly linked to eating fatty diets, according to research.

AA11251285	Step 1<br>  Analyze the severity of the burn. First aid treatment will not be beneficial if the burn injury is so severe in nature that emergency treatment is required. While evidence of a severe burn is usually obvious, hidden injuries such as respiratory damage from inhalation may require immediate attention from a medical professional.<br>  Step2<br>  Avoid rinsing the burn in water. If you've gotten burned while steam cooking, your first instinct may be to rinse your burn injury with water. However, at best, the water may only temporarily numb the source of the pain; at worst, the abrasiveness of the rushing water could complicate your burn injury. Therefore, while water may be a common first aid treatment, its value is limited.<br>  Step3<br>  Use aloe vera lotion. This is a soothing lotion; however, in general, lotions should be avoided. A burn injury usually heals best when it is allowed to receive oxygen. Still, if you are looking for an effective burn treatment, get your hands on silvadine-silver sulfadiazide-cream.<br>  Step4<br>  Cover the burn with a light and non-adhesive gause. Depending on the severity of the burn, you should apply antibiotic ointment and cover it up. If you have a severe burn injury, you should be careful not to allow clothes or gauze to stick to the burned area. However, if you have a first degree burn, you should allow the air to be an ally in the healing process.<br>  Step5<br>  Don't pop blisters from the burn. When healing from a burn injury, the worst thing you can do is to fiddle with it. Infection may follow if you're not careful. Rather, permit these wounds to heal over time. Make sure to keep your injury cleaned and re-dress it a few times each day.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Cold compresses.|`|637333c441e6b619e7c53007af176cd5aa	Start by running water over the burn at room temperature, adding colder water as you go. The idea is to remove the heat. after you do this you may want to treat it with ice packs. All burns are the same you need to remove the heat as quick as possible. Cool or cold water is best.
EeTs9DqUaa	It looks like you suffer from a common condition of type 2 diabetes called Dawn Phenomenon.  What happens is before you wake up your brain sends a signal to your liver that  we will be getting up soon, your liver than releases glucose into your blood stream so you have enough energy to get moving until you eat.  This happens to everybody including non diabetics, the problem is those of us that suffer from DP our liver sends to much glucose and combined with insulin resistance we have high fasting numbers.

L9Q6r42Qaa	Homocysteine, Folic Acid and Cardiovascular Disease<br>  <br>  <br>  AHA Recommendation<br>  <br>  The American Heart Association has not yet called hyperhomocysteinemia (high homocysteine level in the blood) a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We don't recommend widespread use of folic acid and B vitamin supplements to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. We advise a healthy, balanced diet that's rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat dairy products. For folic acid, the recommended daily value is 400 micrograms (mcg). Citrus fruits, tomatoes, vegetables and grain products are good sources. Since January 1998, wheat flour has been fortified with folic acid to add an estimated 100 micrograms per day to the average diet. Supplements should only be used when the diet doesn't provide enough.<br>  <br>  What is homocysteine, and how is it related to cardiovascular risk?<br>  <br>  Homocysteine is an amino acid in the blood. Too much of it is related to a higher risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease (fatty deposits in peripheral arteries).<br>  <br>  Evidence suggests that homocysteine may promote atherosclerosis (fatty deposits in blood vessels) by damaging the inner lining of arteries and promoting blood clots. However, a causal link hasn't been established.<br>  <br>  How do folic acid and other B vitamins affect homocysteine levels?<br>  <br>  Folic acid and other B vitamins help break down homocysteine in the body. Homocysteine levels in the blood are strongly influenced by diet and genetic factors. Dietary folic acid and vitamins B-6 and B-12 have the greatest effects. Several studies found that higher blood levels of B vitamins are related, at least in part, to lower concentrations of homocysteine. Other evidence shows that low blood levels of folic acid are linked with a higher risk of fatal coronary heart disease and stroke.<br>  <br>  So far, no controlled treatment study has shown that folic acid supplements reduce the risk of atherosclerosis or that taking these vitamins affects the development or recurrence of cardiovascular disease. Researchers are trying to find out how much folic acid, B-6 and/or B-12 are needed to lower homocysteine levels. Screening for homocysteine levels in the blood may be useful in patients with a personal or family history of cardiovascular disease but who don't have the well-established risk factors (smoking, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, physical inactivity, obesity and diabetes).<br>  <br>  Although evidence for the benefit of lowering homocysteine levels is lacking, patients at high risk should be strongly advised to be sure to get enough folic acid and vitamins B-6 and B-12 in their diet. They should eat fruits and green, leafy vegetables daily.<br>  <br>  This is just one possible risk factor. A physician taking any type of nutritional approach to reducing risk should consider a person's overall risk factor profile and total diet.|`|xPxIIlGfaa	that not a bad one..

Xp5lgKWOaa	Late night eating is a terrible problem for most dieters. Many people maintain good diets during the day only to blow it late at night. Below are 9 tips to curb late night eating.<br>  Be sure to eat 3 good meals during the day with 1 or 2 between meal snacks. Most people try to eat too few calories during the day only to binge late at night. A good insurance policy is to eat most of your calories before 6 PM.<br>    <br>  When you feel the urge to eat late at night, try drinking 2 or more cups of water. You can also make a cup of herbal tea sweeten with honey or artificial sugar. Hot liquids have a soothing effect on emotions and appetite.<br>    <br>  Remind yourself that it's normal to feel hungry late at night due to habitually eating late. Breaking this habit is like learning to quit smoking. Remind yourself of your goal to lose 20 or 30 pounds and the key to losing this weight is to STOP late night eating.<br>    <br>  Much of late night eating after dinner can be avoided by hiding the junk food. Put foods that you're prone to eat late at night out of sight. Better yet, don't buy junk food at all, though this may not be possible if you have kids.<br>    <br>  Suck on hard candy. Most hard candy have only a few calories and they give you the satisfaction of snacking.<br>    <br>  Keep a written copy of your diet plan in view, which will keep your goal of losing weight firmly fixed in your mind. The temptation to snack late at night will not be as great if you don't give into the urge for several weeks.<br>    <br>  Some people have great success by simply brushing their teeth late at night. This method has been known to curb late night eating for many people.<br>    <br>  The most vulnerable time for eating late is 1 hour after dinner right up to bedtime. Keep your life interesting by working on a favorite hobby and NOT watching TV. The ads on TV can subconsciously trigger the impulse to eat. Boredom is your biggest danger to late night eating.<br>    <br>  Psyche yourself for the battle. You know that you will feel tempted to snack late at night. It's an artificial feeling that will go away when you go to bed. The next morning, you probably won't be hungry .... eat breakfast anyway .... it's the most important meal of the day.|`|P1xr3CREaa	I get hungry at night(I pretty much always do) But I actually have been drinking Carnation Good Start Milk Chocolate powder mix(taste just like chocolate milk, except for the fact that it really fills you up, and has a lot of nutrients and fiber in it) I think it was $6 for a big can of it! I've lost weight since drinking this instead of having my usually hot pocket, chewy chocolate chip cookies and cheescake(eek!) You should try it if you are usually craving something sweet at night.

eRX96A73aa	The medicine will really help the weight come off. It will put your TSH (or THS I can't remember) levels back in the right range. Keep being active and don't have you hopes too high. <br>  It can take over a year to figure out the right dosage of medicine you might need to get your thyroid back in line. It takes patience. <br>  I recommend getting a journal and writing down the things you eat daily, how you feel, and your weight. Do this every night before you go to bed, and when you have appointments with your doctor it will help him understand how the medicine is affecting your thyroid and how your dosage might need to be adjusted. <br>  This will help you get back to your normal weight sooner and get you feeling better!<br>  I hope this helped! Good luck!|`|VM6XG5c3aa	One of the symptoms of hypothyroidism is a lowered metabolic rate, which often means either weight gain or difficulty in losing weight.<br>  <br>  You have been started on replacement hormone, that is good. The key now will be to work up to the correct dose for your body's needs. That part will take time, unfortunately, since the dosage is best increased in small amounts (25mcg) with sufficient time adjustments (6 weeks) for your body to do what it needs to do with the increase in hormone.<br>  <br>  Exercise is good, but don't do it to the point that it causes you to be exhausted or in pain. Let your body catch up with what it has to do and get your metabolic rate back up and then the workouts will be more productive.<br>  <br>  Eat healthy, avoiding goitrogens, especially soy and HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup) that affect thyroid hormones in a negative way.|`|JCozkN7faa	your symptoms are exactly what i get sometimes! I also have Hypothyroidism but at first it was hyper.<br>  <br>  The medicine you will take will act like your thyroid. I also have 3 other auto immune diseases. I weigh about 125 normally.

Sometimes they increase your dose(mine is at 150mg-levothroid(same as synthroid) you might ant to ask your dr about losing the weight though!If he/she says its ok then I would do it!|`|GcWRPLd6aa	yes the weight should come off once your thyroid levels go back to normal. When you don't have enough it causes your metabolism to slow, and you become more sluggish which leads to the weight gain. You can step up the exercise as well to speed up the process.<br>  <br>  The medication works well, but when first starting it might take some time to see the full effects and for your doctor to find the correct dose<br>  <br>  basically the medicine works by replacing the hormones that are low that your thyroid normally secretes<br>  <br>  It is very important to take the medication as directed, 30 minutes before meals, on an empty stomach, usually in the morning. Avoid taking any multivitamins or other drugs at the same time since it can alter absorption - space them out by atleast 2 hours|`|a8NmaKbeaa	The medication won't make you automatically lose the weight but it should make it easier for the weight to come off with exercise.  The sluggishness should subside when your TSH returns to a normal level.<br>  <br>  It may take a while to get you to the right dosage...be patient!  I have bloodwork taken every 3 months and have had my dosage changed multiple times since being diagnosed with hypothyroidism.  If the dose is too high, it could throw you into hyper so your doc may have to start you low and slowly increase.<br>  <br>  Also, as stated above, make sure you take it every day.  The pills are tiny and no real side effects since they are basically supplementing your underactive thyroid with a natural replacement.  And keep getting your bloodwork checked...it can fluctuate so it's best to keep tabs on your TSH number.

Sometimes, I have a bit of heartburn pain, but it doesn't seem too bad -- until I drink water.  Then I can get pains so sharp that I get dizzy, my eyes water, etc.  The pain is usually intense for just a couple minutes or less.  It feels more like it is above the stomach, even in the chest. In fact, it is usually from the esophagus spasming and trying to close up to stop the acid from the stomach.  Not sure if this is what you experienced, but the links below give more info.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|F8EnH6JQaa	TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  the first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your boy adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  If man made it, don't eat it<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  Walk your dog, or walk a friends dog<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

Drinking eight glasses of water is almost like a must. And do not forget to drink water in the morning, the moment you wake up. In fact this is one of the most rapid weight loss tips that the dieticians suggest to the people. <br>  Have organic foods for the breakfast like apples, bananas, plain yogurt, tomatoes, carrots, peppers, raw honey, wild smoked salmon, and so on. <br>  Keeping a track on the watch, go for an hour walk. It need not be power walking, but definitely it should be non-stop walk and that’s for sure, in a couple of days only, you’ll start finding the difference in you. <br>  Another tip regarding how to lose weight fast, easy and safe is that you should have your dinner about 4-5 hours before going off to sleep. <br>  The two-point program that will ensure the ultimate success is: regular exercise and balanced diet. <br>  Don’t depend upon fat burning diet supplements. They wont go a long way in helping you sustain your reduced kilos. <br>  Soft drinks cannot benefit you in any way. They contain 150 empty calories, so if you substitute one bottle of soft drink with water each day, it will do wonders for you. It will enable you to lose about 16 lbs per year. <br>  Sometimes boredom becomes a cause of overeating, so keep yourself busy. <br>  If you want to seriously control your weight, then you have to stop yourself from getting lured into trying tempting foods. <br>  As important is to pay attention to the fact that we eat the right food, equally vital is to keep a watch on the quantity. Without altering your diet plan, even if you’ll reduce 5-10% of your consumption, it will prove beneficial. <br>  Eat slowly so that you can get a feeling that you have had enough food and your tummy is full. Eat slowly and fully relish the taste.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs.

15e4b23d09e63ca5a1ecc092fae0dadcaa	Don't worry....the oral surgeon will put you to sleep...you'll feel a little pinch when they put the IV in your arm and that's it...you'll go to sleep and he'll more than likely take out all 4 teeth. As far as afterwards, he'll inject a numbing medication before you wake up....it takes hours for that stuff to wear off, but before it does.....start on the oral pain meds. that he'll prescribe to you. Some advice....ice packs, they really help alot with the swelling. He'll probably prescribe something like Ibuprofen for that, along whatever pain meds he feels are suitable for you. The worst part will be over in about 24-48hrs. You'll just be really sore and won't be able to eat alot. Just take your meds, use ice packs, and stick to really soft foods. Don't worry, you'll be back to normal in no time. :)|`|Y2yiyVuSaa	No. Not as long as they inject  you with an anesthetic. (When they inject you with an anesthetic, you will feel a "pinch" breifly, but that's about it).|`|AA10939306	My husband got all his wisdom teeth pulled.

KVEGzknvaa	Many schools offer a pre-dentistry "major".  However, as long as you fulfill the basic requirements for dental school (Chemistry, Biology, Organic Chemistry, Physics, and Calculus for most uniersities) you can do any major you would like in your undergraduate studies.  I go to Stony Brook and entered as a pre-med biology student with plans to go to dental school here.  Most medical schools see the same biology and chemistry students over again, variety is good.  You can definitely finish a major that interests you as well as keep your opportunities open for dental school.<br>  <br>  Just remember that a Chemistry or Biology degree alone won't get you into medical school.  Your pre-requisites are the most important part of your undergraduate study.|`|a1KqdXLXaa	Chemistry is the best major for dentistry, next would likely be biology, but any of the sciences.

mEzvEvVlaa	oh gosh.<br>  thats not good that you forgot about it !<br>  oh dear... you might have TSS ( toxic shock syndrome )  ! Although you can wear a tampon at night, it is best to avoid doing so. This is because at times you bleed lightly when sleeping. In addition, you may oversleep, with the result that you have been wearing the same tampon for nine or ten hours, which, i assume you did, and now you have tss.<br>  <br>  some signs of TSS  include a fever usually higher than 102 degrees F. (38.88 degrees C.), a rash covering the body, and severe vomiting or diarrhea. One may also be very light-headed or feel faint, caused by a significant drop in blood pressure. The eyes, or the vagina may appear brightly red, and the person affected may show confusion, or have a severe headache.<br>  <br>  The presence of several of these symptoms constitutes an emergency, particularly if one uses tampons, contraceptive sponges, has recently given birth, had a dilation and curettage, miscarriage or is recovering from chicken pox. Treatment required is immediate, usually intravenous (IV) antibiotics to stop the illness from spreading.<br>  <br>  Failing to treat TSS can result in severe kidney infection and ultimately death; thus, signs of this illness should never be ignored. While those affected are usually hospitalized, doctors will be sure to look for the presence of abscesses, which may result from a tampon or contraceptive sponge that has been left in place too long. Caught early, TSS responds well to antibiotics and tends to restore people to complete health.<br>  <br>  Young girls who have just begun menstruating seem to be at increased risk for contracting TSS from tampon use. They often use too large of a tampon, or may forget its presence because they are simply not used to menstruation. Risk is eliminated when girls use maxi-pads instead of tampons.<br>  <br>  Risk of TSS can be significantly reduced for others by observing proper care of wounds, cuts or abscesses. Signs of skin infection due to chicken pox or cuts, for example, should be brought to the attention of a doctor so the infection does not become TSS.<br>  <br>  anyway, if you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor right away! good luck!|`|ft8t98Pnaa	that's wierd... did you get turned on at all last night? it could be dishcharge.....|`|kjgdPLHqaa	Umm. dont worry a whole lot.. its just a vaginal discharge every girl has! but so much you say hmmm, thats werid but i have the same problem, should you go to the doctor NO but if it happens everytime you have a tampon go to pads even though they are so uncomfortable i guess you would have too:) i hope it helped|`|5ci9IZd2aa	Clear liquid, sounds like someone who's water has broken.

Add a little jogging to your daily walks. I find that when I stop losing weight even if I am dieting and exercising, I pump up the work I'm doing or increase the time I do it for, and that helps the scale budge a little bit. As for appetite control products, if you want an EXTREME appetite control pill, Adipex-P works wonderfully, but is available only by prescription.|`|68lLAQnKaa	its all about what you eat, look up some good healthy food choices and stick to 'em for a while.  You'll see things change, also drink lots of water, keep your body hydrated and get good sleep, try to keep stress away, sometimes weight issues can be totally stress related.  While walking is good, try turning up the volume with some ankle weights, keep that heart rate up the whole time your walking, even to the point of being a bit out of breath... hope you get the results your looking for!
IVyJSfusaa	In most cases she will not have stunted her growth permanently. She will continue growing when her body has been normal weighted for a while. Sometimes you may experience a growth spurt, sometimes not, but in most cases you will continue growing when your body got energy reserves to do so. You will most likely however expect to be some centimeters smaller.

ufgv7oTjaa	Sheraton is right (love the reference, BTW) that they are safe to take, primarily because the Amino Acids are already in your diet in most protein sources. However, the dosage may be a problem if you are in your early teens or if you are a smaller size. Most supplements are sold as adult doses unless the bottle says otherwise and for those who are younger or smaller, it may be more than their system is ready for.<br>  It also depends on which Amino Acids you're taking. If you're talking about a protein powder for weight lifting, yeah, you're perfectly fine... just don't have it as your sole source of nutrition or sole source of protein as Sheraton pointed out. However, if you're taking L-Arginine for example, it's safe for adults to take several grams per day, but the higher dose you get, the more likely you could have diarrhea (at least until you develop a tolerance to it). Like I said, it depends on the Amino Acid. Feel free to E-mail me if you have more details about that. Good luck!|`|L6ZEQxvLaa	yep, they are safe.   however they should be supplements not the primary intake.  eat a healthy diet and that would be your primary source of amino acids and stuff like Bragg's Liquid amino to supplement.
BG8vMyZjaa	Full cream milk has avout 6% fat, about 12 gms of carbohydrate per cup.<br>  There is less fat and more calcium in semi-skimmed and skimmed milk.<br>  Semi-skimmed milk<br>  This has all the virtues of whole milk, except that some of the fat has been removed, leaving between 1.5 and 1.8 per cent.<br>  Skimmed milk<br>  This is the one for people who are following a low-fat diet, as only a trace (0.3 per cent) remains. Even so, skimmed milk is still highly nutritious and is an excellent source of calcium, and contains everything that whole and semi-skimmed milk has but without the fat.<br>  There is the same quantity of carbohydrates in semi and skimmed milk, about 11gms per cup (8ozs).|`|FaVYRoXqaa	As you reduce fat in milk, the amount of carbs go up slightly.  None are refined sugars and will alter insulin production. Obviously as you go down on the scale, the less fat, but fat isn`t always bad for you.  In fact, your body even needs saturated fats (obviously not a lot).|`|CWVBfaPwaa	I'm guessing you want the milk for the calcium? It's better not to drink any of these. Milk has to be heated to 160 degrees and calcium is killed off at 120 degrees. However, it's a milk company that funds the osteoporosis foundation and that's why we don't hear of this. There is a place in Africa that has virtually no cases of Osteoporosis and they don't drink milk, but in Alaska, where it is the highest percentage of osteoporosis, they drink a lot of milk!|`|ezT7xruoaa	you should check out the atkins website, it has loads of info on how to avoid carbs. For low carb always go full fat, that means no low fat products or skimmed milk, as that has more carbs. And milk has no trans fats, as far as I know that's only found in products like cookies or ready meals.

fXDKPbbBaa	there best with salt and pepper kinda like cat|`|AA10723498	Designer babies?  Is this what we're coming to?  Yeah, I read an article on that and it disgusted me.  In the future, parents will be able to pick the eye color, hair color, gender, and even be assured of not having a fat child.  It's all done in the lab just like now with  the embryos they implant.  It makes me wonder, will these babies be normal with all that manipulation.  They will even be able to create a genius child.  It goes against all of natures natural selection.  If everyone is gorgeous, slender, blonde hair and blue eyes, where's the variety.  Is this going to give them a personality that's pleasing to everyone or will they be psychopaths.  There was a song years ago about the future and I will never forget one line of that song.  It says "in the year 2525, if man is still alive, if women can survive they will find. that you can pick your sons and your daughter too from the bottom of a long glass tube,.."  It seems it's coming to that doesn't it, but at what cost,  I'll take my chances the good old fashion way,
SzAYtQTwaa	Hi Friend,<br>  If a cold or the flu tries to interrupt you. keep this in mind: you are better off taking a break instead of breaking a sweat.<br>  Forget about what you might have heard about trying to perspire your way back to better health. That's not the way your immune system fights off sickness,?says Liz Applegate, PhD, a?fitness and?nutrition expert on the faculty of the Nutrition Department at the University of California, Davis.<br>  Your body can't "sweat out" toxins and germs during exercise. That's a job for the immune system, she says, which uses its complex network of specialized cells and components to engulf, detoxify, and disassemble bad guys.<br>  She says there's more you should know.<br>  Your immune system fights most effectively when it isn't stressed. Research studies show that a moderate fitness program helps boost the immune system, lessening the chances you'll fall ill with a cold or flu. But scientists also note that a single rigorous exercise session or race can actually make you more susceptible to bacterial or viral infection.<br>  So listen to your body when you feel sick and need to rest -- a hard workout could impair your immune system for several hours, allowing unwelcome guests to make your illness worse.?<br>  And make sure you give your body enough time to recover before you return to exercise after a serious illness like the flu. Come back too soon and you may actually send yourself into a relapse of the illness, which further slows your return to everyday activities.<br>  <br>  Here's some advice : you can balance exercise and illness. Fever.?If you're hot, skip the workout. Elevated body temperature raises your heart rate, and exercise jacks up your heat and heartbeats even more, putting?stress?on your immune system.<br>  Aches and pains.?Forget the exercise if you have nagging muscle pains or headache which could be a sign your body is trying to fight off a bug.<br>  When your illness seems to be letting up, work back into your exercise routine slowly.<br>   Then, once you're back, try to stay healthy -- these tips may help you avoid another closeencounter with the sickness bugs.<br>  Eat your fruits and vegetables.?Several servings every day will give your body the vitamin C and other nutrients that are crucial for a healthy immune system.<br>  Get plenty of rest.?sleep not only helps you rebuild, but also keeps your immune system functioning at its best. Aim for eight hours nightly.<br>  Thank you<br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|3bpwLPxjaa	Actually a study has just been released saying that sleeping and taking it easy when sick ISNT as good as being active.  <br>  It is a fact that your immune system is intimitely conected with metabolism.  When you are active your metabolism works harder and helps fight the cold.  More oxygen gets into the blood and its better.<br>  Its just when people are sick, they think that if they reserve their energy, it will provide more energy to fight the cold...not so.  The body is so lame when resting, it is barely doing anything. <br>  <br>  be sure to hydrate yourself more though.  It is very important to flush out.<br>  <br>  I dont know who did the thumbs down, but this is fact!|`|Y2yiyVuSaa	Experts in the medical field suggest that if you're battling a cold, that you continue to exercise, but on a reduced scale. Your body is working hard to fight-off the virus/infection, and you don't want to add to the work your body is doing. (This will, in turn, lower your immunity, and may prolong the cold).|`|68lLAQnKaa	it won't kill you, but your the exercise won't do your body any good.  You need to rest until your well.  It will make your cold last longer, thats what it did to me anyway.  Just relax and get well, then hit the gym hard =) feel better!

dl1yuCoFaa	Scabies is a mite that is invisible to the naked eye. The mite burrows just underneath the skin and lays its eggs in a little line under the skin. This causes the intense itching, and of course the pursuant scratching will only spread the scabies. Scabies itching seems worse at night, and when exposed to heat, such as a warm bath.<br>  <br>  The scabies could have come from any number of sources. They can be picked up by playing in the dirt, by sleeping in an infected bed or sleeping area, or simply by skin contact with another person who is infected. And yes, it is possible that your child can have scabies and not infect other family members. However, it's probably a good idea to treat all family members that are in close physical contact, since you may not notice the infection for a few days, until the scabies mite has had time to lay its eggs under the skin of the new host. Some people with different skin types seem to be less affected than others. <br>  <br>  Did the doctor that diagnosed scabies provide a prescription for any kind of treatment? If so, you should use it as directed, and bathe your child the following morning. The scabies is probably not coming from your dog. It's possible it came from your carpet, if an infected person has had skin contact with your carpet.<br>  <br>  Trust your doctor, treat him for scabies. It will take about a week for the rash to fade and the itch to subside. If it's not better in 7-10 days, go back to the doctor.|`|VlYMcVKlaa	my brother had something like this. He was hardly a year old and the doctor said that he would be alergic to our carpet, we got into a new house with out any carpet at all and it is gone. he could not breath right and he had a rash too. he is doing great now and he is 20 now and we still dont have carpet in the house. ask your doctor if this could be possible or ask a different doctor and make some other allergy test too

V0rr15amaa	poppies<br>  <br>  opium poppies - 90% comes from Afghanistan|`|cc7a9e602a34331d1b8fc3083e410395aa	Heroin is a semi-synthetic opioid synthesized from morphine, a derivative of the opium poppy.. The white crystalline form is commonly the hydrochloride salt diacetylmorphine hydrochloride, however heroin freebase may also appear as a white powder.<br>  <br>  As with other opioids, heroin is used as both a pain-killer and a recreational drug. Frequent and regular administration can quickly cause tolerance and dependence, and as such, heroin has a very high potential for addiction. If sustained use of heroin for as little as three days is stopped abruptly, withdrawal symptoms may appear, though other studies have shown the onset of withdrawals to begin from 7 to 14 days of continuous use. This is much quicker than other common opioids such as oxycodone and hydrocodone.<br>  <br>  Internationally, heroin is controlled.  It is illegal to manufacture, possess, or sell heroin in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Iran, India, the Netherlands, the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, Pakistan, the United Kingdom and Swaziland. However, under the name diamorphine, heroin is a legally prescribed Controlled Drug in the United Kingdom. In the Netherlands, heroin is available for prescription as the generic drug diacetylmorphine to long-term heroin addicts. Popular street names for heroin include black tar, skag, horse, smack,Junk, chieva, gear, Evil, "H", "Boy", "Big Boy", "dogfood,'baby powder'" and others.<br>  <br>  its known as a downer which causes drowsiness, respiritory depression, nausea vomiting constipation and pupil consrtiction etc.

It can take up to 72 hours for the sperm to reach the egg. If you are intending to stop the possible pregnancy that may happen, there's an emergency contraceptive called "The Morning After" pill or "Plan B" which you can obtain from visiting a local pharmacy now I think.

BicCDOllaa	That is the start of Paraphimosis. If it does get stuck go the the ER ASAP! Your best bet is to get circumcised.<br>  <br>  I opted to get circumcised at 18, so I have been there and have the t-shirt! I was done in the doctors office with a local and was in and out under an hour. Being circumcised is much cleaner, uncut guys need to wash at least 2-3x a day and before sex, as there is always a stink. It is healthier to be cut, uncut guys have a 60% higher chance to acquire STD's and HIV! Being cut also looks better, that's a no brainer. It also enhances the sexual experience, the foreskin just gets in the way! I had no hesitation to have my boys (2&4) circumcised as I know there is no downside, only a lifetime of benefits!<br>  <br>  There is nothing good about being uncircumcised! Don't listen to idiots that tell you it is mutilation and you will have less pleasure during sex. The opposite is true sex rocks when you are circumcised!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Read these new studies!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081217/sc_n...">http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081217/sc_n...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://allcircumcision.blogspot.com/2008..." rel="nofollow">http://allcircumcision.blogspot.com/2008...</a>|`|3156c54d8f966e51776af0486120bb1daa	Phimosis is the condition in which one cannot fully, freely and painlessly retract the foreskin, both flaccid and after erection, to expose the whole glans and the coronal sulcus (groove) behind it.<br>  <br>  Whilst the foreskin often does auto-retract as one develops an erection, this is not always the case, especially with a long foreskin.  It is perfectly normal to have to manually retract the foreskin after erection - but this should be an easy and painless task.<br>  <br>  Paraphimosis is the condition in which the foreskin, having been retracted behind the glans, becomes tight there and cannot be eased back to cover the glans.  Paraphimosis usually results in the penis not fully losing its erection since the tight, constricting foreskin prevents blood from flowing out of the glans (and incidentally prevents any fresh, oxygenated blood from flowing in).<br>  <br>  From what you have written, it would seem that you have a mild form of paraphimosis since the foreskin should automatically replace itself over the glans after an erection subsides.  This may be of no consequence, but if there are any signs of the foreskin tightening up more then you need to get a circumcision as a matter of urgency before full blown paraphimosis occurs with its attendant risk to the glans, which may suffer from gangrene.|`|i6RlYFo7aa	thats not paraphimosis<br>  <br>  paraphimosis is when the skin gets stuck and will not come back down over the head AT ALL <br>  <br>  you're normal, on some males the skin retracts when they're erct, no worries|`|SltEwVX7aa	yeah, most guys have to put the foreskin back;  it's not an automatic thing.  It's the same when you get an erection;  the foreskin has to be manually retracted.  <br>  <br>  I'd say you're normal.  I'm not hearing anything that indicates you have paraphimosis.|`|PNtOcMaHaa	GO to www.webmd.com

It is difficult for another person to duplicate that, and if your girlfriend is your age and not particularly experienced, she may in fact not be giving you pleasure with 'hand jobs".

Water intoxication is most commonly seen in infants under six months of age and sometimes in athletes. A baby can get water intoxication as a result of drinking several bottles of water a day or from drinking infant formula that has been diluted too much. Athletes can also suffer from water intoxication. Athletes sweat heavily, losing both water and electrolytes. Water intoxication and hyponatremia result when a dehydrated person drinks too much water without the accompanying electrolytes.|`|0BX8Lozkaa	That is actually pretty good. A gallon is 3. something liters, and I drink 2 liters a day which is 64oz. Its always recommended to drink lots of water, now if you drank 5 gallons a day you may have a problem.

Ko5AhrSVaa	Hey Rob, <br>  <br>  So my experience with Brown Urine. I have done several hard workouts in the past and proceeded to expel iced tea colored urine one or two times before it returned to normal. <br>  Usually brownish colored urine is a result of the presence of blood released into the urinary tract. In my case, I have a mild bleeding disorder called Von Willebrands Disease, which causes my blood to clot less fast than normal as a result of a lack of the VW factor that controls clotting time (very boiled down definition). I was told that while working out, I probably popped a couple of blood vessels in my kidneys or somewhere along my urinary tract, but since the bleeding didn't stop immediately, more blood was released into my urinary tract than normal resulting in the brownish urine. <br>  <br>  If you did a big workout and popped several blood vessels as I have in the past, that could account for blood in your urine. I wouldn't worry too much about it too much. If it happens again, go see your doc and explain the problem. <br>  <br>  Have a good day.|`|fc2341c40e9cd5135714bfab803257f5aa	Sounds like u were dehydrated<br>  <br>  if u notice this again go 2 ur GP<br>  <br>  also i cud be a urine infection|`|20kO5cO3aa	No brown urine is that you are infected with somthing go see a dr. right away...this is not normal, it could be that your filling up with blood and its turning to a light shade of brown... you may have urinatry  blockage, I am not there to check you out. but your dr. will know for sure by a test|`|GcWRPLd6aa	most likely you were just dehydrated<br>  <br>   if you ever notice it again I would check with the doc|`|PNtOcMaHaa	go to this web cite www.webmd.com type in brown urine and you should get your answer!

RsJvrCj3aa	I used to binge and purge multiple times on a daily basis.  I didn't even second guess it, until I lost a pregnancy within moments of finding out I was pregnant.  I knew why I lost it, and I knew why I couldn't get pregnant afterward.  I was devastated.  I've been seeking treatment for my eating disorder for almost two years.  I have suffered from it for 14 long painful years.  Now that I want to stop I can't.  I stopped binging and purging, but now I have zero appetite.  I don't ever seem to want to eat.  I'm struggling so much because now I want to be healthy, and lose weight.  I need to lose weight because after years of my eating disorder, my body won't cut the weight.  It is literally in starvation mode.  Report me, give me thumbs down, do what you want... but I'm telling you now, you will soon find yourself in a place where you are more worried about being an acceptable weight, than "skinny."  You are currently an AMA acceptable weight.  If you take advantage of this, and start eating right, and get therapy, you will be grateful... but if you piss it away and get more concerned about truly being overweight and not knowing how to even do something so simply primitive as to properly feeding yourself.  <br>  <br>  mark my words, get help or live to regret it.|`|g2h6qUUXaa	go to the doctor and tell your doctor everything you listed here|`|1ctmq5c0aa	Well i don't know what i have i don't eat if i don't have to but if made to eat i purge , i went though a stage of purging every think i ate but the that calmed down , but even now if made to eat i will purge but then if i binge i don't always purge i hate it but i do know i have a ED i am 5'6 and i weight  :'( a fat 9st  i hate it i have not had a ed for the long about a year i would say . hope this helps a little xx|`|K4SOAACTaa	Omq yea da samee shyt happen to me ): i am 5'0 w.

I do eat junk, but, in moderation...|`|jkDawQVNaa	See a doctor and get some help 5'5' and weighing 70 pds is NOT safe and your trying to lose weight at 132 your healthy at 132!!!! relax but see a doctor asap|`|4uInub7laa	I used to be anorexic and now I am fighting bulimia.  Both are very deadly I was hospitalized once with anorexia and for 2 years I did not have a period.  I don't know if I will ever be able to have children. Being 5'6 and 132 lbs you are definitely not fat you are barely at a healthy weight as it is.  You are still on the border line of being too thin.  I know that right now you are thinking that I am crazy and and that at 132 you are overweight but you have to understand that what you see in the mirror and what the scale tells you is a lie.  You are not capable of making decisions concerning your weight.  You need to be under a doctors care.  I go to a doctor once every 2-3 months to check my weight.  I have to put it in his hands.  Until you go to a doctor you will never get better.  A person with an eating disorder can not make themselves better they need help from a Professional.  Good luck and remember even though you do not see that you are beautiful you really Truly are. good luck

The lenses itself is curved, and so the person cuts open a thin layer, and shapes the lenses so it refracts the light so it reaches the back of the eye perfectly.|`|mDDwSM7daa	You need to realise that laser eye surgery is not the only method.<br>  <br>  Take a look at www.Freedomfromglasses.co.uk - This should help answer your question

RUMvpKStaa	Yes .Stop having sex. You already said your feelings changed, so that's why you are crying.<br>  Deep down you feel remorse about loving someone that way when the feelings aren't there . talk to him and tell him how you feel and that why you need to stop. if your feelings change again then go back , but start slowly at first. <br>  Hope this helps|`|a984cQjKaa	maybe you feel degraded and that's why you cry after sex.  you need to talk to your boyfriend about how it made you feel, since it's bothering you so much that it's making you upset and question your feelings for him.  why exactly have your feelings changed, if not because of the sex?  you're not doing anyone any favors by sticking around if you're truly not invested in this relationship anymore.  sometimes relationships go through cycles of feeling distant from your partner; sometimes the feeling comes back if you figure out why you're feeling distant in the first place.  then again, sometimes not.  you owe it to yourself to figure out whether your feelings changing is a permanent thing or not, and to take the appropriate action if it turns out you don't love him anymore.|`|FQrdmoEMaa	You feel guilty maybe. Because you want to leave him but he's been sweet to you and make love to you but you don't feel the same to him. Then again they say a woman cries after having great sex.|`|F4DhYjlnaa	If you are not comfortable with a certain sex act, you need to let him know, even if it seems minor. Also, it sounds like you might not be emotionally ready for the sexual intensity of this relationship. The best thing to do is discuss your feelings with him, even if you have to edit out the fact that you cry afterwards, just so he doesn't think you're being a "girl." I know that is lame, but we sometimes have to out think men when it comes to sex/sexuality.|`|TwiHb8Kvaa	honestly if you are feeling like this after sex then 1. you shouldnt be having sex because your not emotionally ready, and 2. you are not happy with your boyfriend for any number of reasons. In all fairness you should talk to him and tell him how you feel and what you dont like..|`|HOsF3g0maa	Hmmm, you could be losing feelings for him and may love him, but may not want to have sex with him. I had the same problem and I actually broke up with him and found a new boyfriend, which everything is great. I don't know what it really is but like you I think, I felt uncomfortable. <br>  <br>  You're obviously not enjoying the . There are some alternatives and some you may not want to pursue, but that's totally up to you:<br>  <br>  A -Tell him how you feel; maybe the two of you can come up with something and pinpoint what's going wrong<br>  <br>  B -Find a sex buddy -I know, I know. Make this the last resort, if you want<br>  <br>  C -Break up with him -Something is totally missing out of your relationship, there's something that's not clicking<br>  <br>  I really wish you luck because I felt the same way. At times I would cry, it really feels degrading...|`|KqxQlPrNaa	Hmmm.........  Sounds like you are feeling guilty for some reason after sex.  Were you ever molested as a child?  That could also be why.  Talk to him about it and tell him how you feel.  Tell him some of the sex acts are making you feel dirty.  Maybe you just really don't love him and your subconscious is making you cry after because you really just don't want to be sexually active with him.  If that's the case you may want to go ahead and break up with him.  Do some serious soul searching and try to figure it out.  Good luck to you!|`|LJPaanBwaa	I would explain to him that you need to be treated better when it comes to sex and that you like to have a very sensual and loving type of "making love" not just having sex.
hD25pT1Laa	Contacts are great as long as you listen to your doctor and not your friends! Don't sleep in them. Even if they are the kind that say you can, your risk of infection is still higher if you sleep in them. Most infections are caused by not following the proper wear and cleaning procedures. Don't wear them longer than your schedule says you can. If they are monthly lenses don't try to wear the same pair to 6 weeks. A lot of people get away with doing dumb things with their contacts for years, but one bad infection can sure mess you up. <br>  <br>  I also have astigmatism and am farsighted. Farsighted with astigmatism used to be hard to fit in soft lenses. I've tried a lot of different brands. My doctor just put me in Acuvue Oasys for Astigmatism and they are the most comfortable and stable torics I've ever worn. I sure can see better in my contacts than I can with my glasses. I'll never give them up.|`|SnTuaKcJaa	clean them correctly and take them out when needed.

Hysterectomy is a major, major surgery.  <br>  Ask your dr about a myomecotmy and removing cysts laparoscopically .  These are forms of surgery too but you will retain your organs.  You may or may not want children but 39 is still young if you can avoid it.
AA11610054	No.<br>  <br>  Our bodies are in tune with the 24 hour day cycle.  <br>  <br>  We have what are called Circadian Rhythms.  Hormones in our bodies tell us when we are sleepy, and when it's time to wake up.  That's why people have an 'internal clock' that often wakes them up at the same time each day.  It's also why if you wake up at the same time on the weekends as you do during the week, you'll not be as tired waking up at the earlier time.<br>  <br>  Science (and even science fiction) is filled with examples of lighting schedules to simulate the rising and setting of the sun.  <br>  <br>  People who live near the poles, and experience periods of 24 hour days or 24 hour nights have issues with sleep, which are mitigated somewhat by lighting techniques.<br>  <br>  If you tried your 10/20 schedule, you would never get into a good sleep rhythm, because your body would not be able to reconcile with the days and nights.|`|GLOBmh0Baa	Wrong catergory - should be in mathematics.

I have a good friend who is against the pill because she is worried it will mess up her hormones or something, so her and her boyfriend only use condoms.

g9EnLhaPaa	You are right about one thing, nobody answered your direct question.<br>  <br>  My take, I don't believe in "A calorie is a calorie".  I'm not a nutritionist, but I think eating 100 calories of a cheeseburger, is not the same as eating 100 calories of salad/fish/lean meats.  Yes they are the same calories, but they effect you differently.<br>  <br>  Here is why I say this.  You ever eat a cheeseburger, and fries?  The answer is yes.  Do you notice how tired, and slooow you feel?  This is called the "Itus".  <br>  <br>  Have you ever eaten a salad with low-fat balsamic dressing, with chicken, and some water?  Notice how light, and energetic you feel?<br>  <br>  I guess technically you could eat 2500 calories of crap food, and lose weight.  However you will feel slow, and lazy.<br>  <br>  In short.  Yes a calorie is a calorie, but no those calories don't react to your body the same.  Good luck homie.|`|zNn9VfRyaa	to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions

I expect most of the work needed to save the tooth has already been done.<br>  Deep breath and get it done.|`|a1KqdXLXaa	A temporary filling is not designed to last for long periods of time.  The permanent filling should be replace within 2 weeks (I know you don't want to hear that).  The temporary material does not seal the tooth properly or provide proper support.  You will not do yourself any favors by putting off the permanent filling and it could cause you to loose the tooth in the future if it is not treated fully.  Get your dentist to prescribe Ativan if you are that nervous.|`|xfgVGqvXaa	LOL, hello again!  I'm glad you made it to the dentist in the end.<br>  <br>  You are supposed to be able to eat on the tooth with the temporary filling.

The time of day you eat food doesn't affect anything: weight loss is all about the calories you take in. <br>  <br>  You could eat nothing but chocolate for every meal, and you'll lose weight as long as you're consuming fewer calories than you're burning. <br>  <br>  Check out this TIME article: "It doesn't matter where your calories come from, as long as you're eating less."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1881795,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/health/article/...</a><br>  <br>  Here's a way to figure out how many calories you should be taking in daily: <a href="http://www.caloriecontrol.org/calcalcs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.caloriecontrol.org/calcalcs.h...</a><br>  <br>  Your best bet: Avoid processed, boxed and packaged foods as much as possible; eat fresh, instead.

TdqeC0vmaa	Nope hypnotherapy wouldn't help to retrieve memories during a black out.<br>  <br>  because in order to retrieve the memory it had to have been stored in the brain. What occurs during a blackout. Alcohol suppresses the part of the brain that is involved with creating new memories. Massive quantities or quickly consumed quantities of alcohol suppress this area  to the point where the brain can not register new memories until the alcohol level has decreased from the body. It doesn't cause the loss of old memory so the person is lucid and can do things they previosly learned and know like walk talk have sex drive a car anything. But while they are doing so the brain is incapable of logging these current activities into memory.<br>  <br>  So that when blood alcohol levels drop and the brain begins to function again the person finds that time has passed, they are somewhere they didn't know they went, people tell them they did things they dont remember doing. Since the activites they did were not recorded in the brain they can not be retrieved from it. <br>  <br>  Whats worst about alcohol blackouts is one that they indicate serious problem and or dangerous drinking. And two that alcohol also suppresses the area of the brain the processes inhibition and judgment. If one has consumed enough alcohol to go into a blackout it is likely enough to seriously impair their good judgment and inhibitions as well. Its not uncommon for people to do very stupid things they don't even know they did until they pay the consequences the next day.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do about black outs is to prevent having them in the first place. One drink per hour is what the body can safely metabolize. Drinking a great deal over a night can cause them or drinking 4 or 5 drinks within a short time frame.|`|rjvtvTTYaa	I think it's a possibility u may b able 2 bring the memory back,  but I have no experience to tell 4 sure.

Hypnotherapy wouldn't really help you and from the sounds of it, you don't want to remember the stuff that went on :))<br>  <br>  I have had similar experiences losing days at a time when my back hurts and I have to take strong pain meds to bear through it. My husband and I watch the replay shows on the internet for our Thursday line-up and there's a few times that I would swear to him that we had yet too see some shows when we in fact had watched them the week before. It was then I realized I was going into that "waking sleep" or "blackout" for days at a time as you describe it. It truly scares me because I am aware that I have walked around, interacted with other people, had access to a stove and/or other open flames. During the times I know I am fully aware of what I'm doing..it's just after the fact that I don't recall a thing.

I'll tell you something about bullies that I discovered a while back. They are all terrible cowards inside and have issues within themselves that have nothing whatsoever to do with you.

In short - they're all sad little inadequates. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is hold your head high and tell yourself that you're the stronger person because you would never be that horrid to someone.

If so, try this high energized cardiovascular fitness routine that that was developed by Keli Roberts.<br>  <br>  With this 10 minute exercise routine you can burn up to 150 calories every single day.<br>  <br>  The first two minutes of this fat burning routine is: Jump Rope - Begin by performing two jumps for each turn of the rope. Safety: Use the correct size jump rope and always land softly on the balls of your feet (that is the upper part of the bottom of your foot). Keep thinking I am losing weight.<br>  <br>  Minutes two to three: Squat Thrust into a Push Up. The proper technique for this exercise is to stand with your feet shoulder width apart and your arms strait down next to your sides. Slowly squat down with your head forward and bring your hands to the floor just outside of your feet. Your hands should be pointing forward as well. Then in one movement, push your legs back and out behind you (into a pushup position). Perform one strict pushup and then jump back into your squat position and then stand back up. Keep thinking, the fat is vanishing.<br>  <br>  Minutes three to four: Jump Rope with only one jump per turn. Keep thinking, The fat is melting away.<br>  <br>  Minutes four to five: Back to the Squat Thrust and Push Up only this time you are going to add the Side Plank. After completing your squat thrust and push up, you are going to lift and rotate your left arm off of the ground and over your head. Your left foot will rotate and rest on top of you right foot. And you will rotate your neck so you are looking up at your ceiling. Rotate back to the center and repeat on the other side. When finished, hop back into your squat position, stand up and start again. Keep thinking, no more belly.<br>  <br>  Minutes five and six: Jump Rope. Same as minutes three and four. keep thinking, I am losing body fat.<br>  <br>  Minutes six and seven: Back to the Squat Thrust and Push Up only this time you are going to add the Leg Lift. This is the same as minutes two and three only this time you will lift the toes of one foot about twelve inches off of the ground only after you have performed your push up. Lower your foot and repeat on the other side. Hop back up to your squat position, stand up, and start again. Keep thinking, goodbye belly.<br>  <br>  Minutes seven and eight: Jump Rope. Same as minutes three and four. Keep thinking, my belly is getting smaller.<br>  <br>  Minutes eight and nine: Back to the Squat Thrust and Push Up only this time you are going to add Mountain Climbers. Repeat everything as in minutes two and three only this time after your push up, you will quickly jog in place from your push up position. Make sure you bring your knees up to your chest on each rotation. Perform 5 jogs and repeat this entire process. Keep thinking, I am going to lose weight.<br>  <br>  Minutes nine and ten: Jump Rope. Same as you first two minutes. Keep thinking. If I do this everyday, I will lose belly fat.|`|1fCklJO6aa	well if u really wanna loose some quick weight then only pills can help u out , cuz there is no such exercise which can lead you to loose that much weight in such a small period of time .. i have used alli and acomplia . i suggest you try acomplia becuase its safe and it will help u loosing quick fat from ur body . give it a try may be that can help .|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	Eat losts of Wendys and u will lose weight|`|AnHQbZQAaa	LOOSE =/= LOSE|`|0cr9lCzhaa	Good start, just realize , everything starts with nutrition. It is Key, write down what you eat course of week, cut out all things that are bad or processed for you. Even when you drink juice instead of soda, check sugar mg, some are very high, I prefer water, Diets , never work..its all common sense, you have it in you, just being focused , keep on, exercise is only 30% of it, but still important. Try cardio, do intervals, sprint  for 20-30 sec, great way for you maximize your weight loss, do some ab work outs, sunbursts, ask some one who's a trainer, may know how to help you in your area. Good luck..|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/reducebodyfat.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...</a>|`|ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.

I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|CuWjsHM2aa	Chocolate is an aphrodisiac.

WKQS4z96aa	A low calorie diet is a great start but if you're not eating healthy - what's the point? Losing weight should be about FEELING good before LOOKING good. You'll gain a lot more when your motivation is internal. But the basic tip I use for myself and when talking to others about nutrition is to make sure that at every meal that half of your plate has fruits and/or veggies. You could eat only fruits and veggies all day long until you though you could puke and still lose weight because the nutrients are so fantastic for your body. Most Americans eat way less fruits and veggies than they should. And they don't need to be super organic fancy shmancy. Even frozen veggies will do. Count your calories and add a bunch of fruits/veggies. It doesn't mean you can't ever eat anything unhealthy. Everything in moderation is a good measure still. I usually have one "bad" meal a week :) Good luck!|`|833a435e36344342d10e69454b7e6731aa	techincally, you could eat plain butter up to 1200 calories and lose weight. the thing is, you wouldnt be aiding your body in toning (if you exercise), by not having fiber you dont help you digestive system, and it wouldnt fill you up for the day, leaving you verrrry hungry.<br>  they did a test that was shown on the Today show about 3 groups of people - one group on a high fat diet, one on high carb, and one of high protein (the same amt. of calories). they all lost about the same weight. it just comes down to all the benefits you get from having healthier foods. not to mention you could have heart problems with a whole mound of butter :).<br>  there's this site - caloriecount.about.com - that lets you track the calories you eat (they have a HUGE database of almost every possible food from any store, restaurant, or fast food joint you could imagine!) and also analyzes it to tell you how balanced (or not) your day was. you can also track weight loss, exercise... and they have a mobile version that's free! so next time you're at a restaurant and want a quick calorie count of something, just text them and they'll give it to you!

In the united states there are careful federal standards for drinking water, so at least here, water has to be potable or safe to drink straight out of the tap.  Bottled water is no more or less healthy than tap water.|`|YQeZ9LL5aa	Personally..

Talked to my parents for a bit, they understood and helped me find a therapist.  I went to a doctor, got prescribed medication.  The thing is, the medication along with therapy will help you.  I know too many people who just get the medication, but dont make an effort to change, so that is why people relapse back into depression.  Be sure you do both, its like if you need to nail a board down, you have to have a nail and a hammer.  If you dont have both, you wont get any work done.<br>  <br>  You gotta make an effort to change though.  Once you accept you have it, then you can make the most out of your therapy, and have a good road to recovery.<br>  <br>  I cannot stress enough that you have to put in the work and effort to change, drugs and therapy are not the miracle way of fixing you, its a tool.|`|d9d7dbffacb9c5256ef7afd69e6023b6aa	Many, many people have fully recovered.

Normally, the test results are given to a radiologist well after the test is completed and the radiologist makes an assessment and dictates a report to be sent to your doctor.

7623Hd7naa	I hate to tell you this, but changing your diet is very important for getting in shape. I would consider myself a food enthusiast too (in fact one major reason I exercise so much is so I can eat more!); that alone doesn't mean what you are eating is wrong. Just take a look and se where you can add more veggies, fruits, and whole grains for starters. If you drink soda, change to diet or try to go to only water. Try to choose leaner cuts of meat. These are small diet changes you can start to make now. <br>  <br>  When I was a student and had a full time job, I took PE classes at my junior college to help stay in shape. That way it was a scheduled part of my day. Some other things you could try are taking walks at a brisk place, and spending a few minutes every morning or evening doing simple exercises you can do at home like push-ups, sit-ups, and jumping jacks. You should aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise a day, and they don't have to be 30 consecutive minutes. So if you do a little at lunch, a little when you get up, and a little before bed it all adds up. Once you start feeling a little more in shape you'll probably feel more committed and will begin make more time in your schedule to make exercising happen.<br>  <br>  I also recommend signing up for the ediets.com newsletter. I never purchased anything form them but the newsletter is free and it has great advice on how to eat healthy, diet myths, and exercise tips.<br>  Good luck!|`|e962QoBTaa	If you have 20-30 min to spare, I would suggest that you spend that for a HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) session. Try to do that 3 times a week (don't do more than that, or you will probably just hurt yourself), preferrably before you eat breakfast. A HIIT session can look like this:<br>  <br>  5 min low intensity<br>  1 min of high intensity<br>  2 min moderate intensity<br>  1 min of high intensity<br>  2 min moderate intensity<br>  1 min of high intensity<br>  2 min moderate intensity<br>  5 min low intensity<br>  <br>  Total time: 19 min. You can perform this with any activity. If it is to cold out, I would suggest jump rope<br>  <br>  That you eat a lot of meat is actually good, just try to have a low intake of carbs and you should be ok. Oh, and if possible, try to spread out your meals during the day. It is better to eat 5-6 smaller meals than 3 big ones if you want to loose weight.

aCPHVCDhaa	You should talk to your doctor about how often you are getting your period. He/she can give you something for that. You should not have your period that often. You are most likely a bit anemic, I get that with all of my period and im on a regular cycle. Your body is loosing alot of blood and its stressful on your body. Try taking some B vitamins and eating some more red meat to help keep your engery up and body strong for now. Talk to your doctor. Your period can be off for a little when you first start and then it generally will become more regular hang in there.

If you can give up the carbs, then it's worth a shot. good luck!!|`|Xp5lgKWOaa	Low carb diets are based on the principle that a diet low in carbohydrates leads to decreased production of body’s insulin, resulting in consumption of fat stores as energy source. <br>  <br>  When fat stores in a body are used as main energy source, Ketones (a by-product) are excreted in the urine. Characterized by nail varnish (acetone), smelling breath and causes side effects such as nausea, fatigue and loss of appetite. <br>  There are many different versions of the low carb diet, such as Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution, Protein Power, Neanderthin, The Carbohydrate Addict's Lifestyle Plan, Life Without Bread, and others. All of them, however, have one thing in common - a very strict reduction in the consumption of carbohydrates. Most low carb diets replace carbohydrates with fats and proteins. Although diets vary in their recommendations, as a general rule, a low carb diet is synonymous with a high-fat and moderate protein diet. Those on a low carb diet should get at least 60 to 70 percent of their daily calorie intake from fat. Carbohydrates should make up less than 10 percent, and in some cases, less than 5 percent of daily calorie intake. <br>  <br>   cut on all carbohydrate from the diet and increased protein and fat intake. Cut on things like pasta, bread, rice and alcohol, yet unlimited amounts of meat, cheese and butter are suggested to eat. That's why sometimes Low Carb Diets claim to be luxurious diets.

You take your birth control as directed, unless you want spotting. You have to wait one week after the day that you STOP taking the antibiotic for your BC to start working fully again. Use a backup method during the time you are on the antibiotic, and the 7 days afterwards.<br>  <br>  Be careful with this: two of my cousins have surprise pregnancies because they were not told this information by their genius doctors.<br>  <br>  The reason why this happens is because the bacteria that helps you absorb the hormones is killed off by the antibiotic, and so much/most of it just passes through you. After 1 week (eat some yogurt too :3) they should have repopulated enough to help you absorb your hormones in the right manner.|`|VByIbVfgaa	there is no reason to stop taking the BC unless your doctor says so. i use to take both of them at the same time and had no problem if you want you can use condom with the Bc never hurts.

Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|zNn9VfRyaa	to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions

Xp5lgKWOaa	Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Drinking eight glasses of water is almost like a must. And do not forget to drink water in the morning, the moment you wake up. In fact this is one of the most rapid weight loss tips that the dieticians suggest to the people. <br>  Have organic foods for the breakfast like apples, bananas, plain yogurt, tomatoes, carrots, peppers, raw honey, wild smoked salmon, and so on. <br>  Keeping a track on the watch, go for an hour walk. It need not be power walking, but definitely it should be non-stop walk and that’s for sure, in a couple of days only, you’ll start finding the difference in you. <br>  Another tip regarding how to lose weight fast, easy and safe is that you should have your dinner about 4-5 hours before going off to sleep. <br>  The two-point program that will ensure the ultimate success is: regular exercise and balanced diet. <br>  Don’t depend upon fat burning diet supplements. They wont go a long way in helping you sustain your reduced kilos. <br>  Soft drinks cannot benefit you in any way. They contain 150 empty calories, so if you substitute one bottle of soft drink with water each day, it will do wonders for you. It will enable you to lose about 16 lbs per year. <br>  Sometimes boredom becomes a cause of overeating, so keep yourself busy. <br>  If you want to seriously control your weight, then you have to stop yourself from getting lured into trying tempting foods. <br>  As important is to pay attention to the fact that we eat the right food, equally vital is to keep a watch on the quantity. Without altering your diet plan, even if you’ll reduce 5-10% of your consumption, it will prove beneficial. <br>  Eat slowly so that you can get a feeling that you have had enough food and your tummy is full. Eat slowly and fully relish the taste.|`|zNn9VfRyaa	to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions

DI3u9gMSaa	I have the exact case you are talking about.  I had invisalign for about 10 months and then switched to metal braces on the bottom and clear ones on top.  I really like having traditional braces because it's more assuring knowing that I'll end up with straighter teeth.  You can check out my experience on my site.|`|48e80d4dffb6b005f6946b03af059d5eaa	I would just do metal if I were you. I am an adult with metal braces and I actually dont mind them at all. With invisilign, if you have pain with them, your initial response may be to take the tray out to subside the pain. This may make for longer treatment. Yes, they are clear and less noticeable, but I hear the treatment time is actually longer for some. With metal braces, yes they are a pain and are noticeable, but within the 10 months I have had mine, I have noticed a tremendous difference in my teeth. The pain with them is not actually bad at all. I also stick to my silver/gray bands, makes them a little less noticeable than pink or lime green bands. Honestly, today, no one really says anything about adults with braces, it shows that you are responsible enough to care about your teeth/smile.<br>  <br>  GL|`|qxWoiRHwaa	I would just do the metal braces. The great thing about the metal braces is that you can't take them off, you can just leave them until your done. <br>  <br>  If you do the combo, you have to go through all the hassle of fitting the metal braces, and then the invisalign, and you will pay a lot more, for two separate treatments. You can have lingual braces - metal braces<br>  that are placed on the inside of the teeth if you are really worried about your image.<br>  <br>  Many people are not good candidates for invisalign, because invisalign is really meant for those who need small to moderate corrections. If your dentists says you need metal, its because you have too much travel for the teeth with Invisalign.<br>  <br>  I ended up taking out the invisalign, not wearing them, and then got into a real mess. I really wish I  had just had the metal ones put on.
AA10648704	Now that Obama is pushing more scientific research, including stem cell, we should get a push in research.  Last year it was revealed that diabetics who had gastric bypass surgery (not just lap band) were about 87% likely to lose their diabetes.  Based on that, my father had it January 15.  He immediately went off the pills, and though he's still been taking insulin, just last night he forgot, and his blood sugar this morning was only 113!  Before, he was often at 200, even with the medication (he's also lost almost 60 pounds!).
Y1ffm4Ibaa	Did you go on some kind of week (or month) long bender staying up late every night? 'Cause if that's the case, a few 9 hour sleeps won't fix the problem. The most important thing with sleep is consistency. Try and make sure you're getting about the same amount each night. Obviously we all have nights where we get way less than we should, but try and keep those to a minimum. Other than that, all I can suggest is exercise, drinking lots of water and eating right.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	weather and stress can totally do that to you. i used to live in a really warm climate, but then i moved to a snowy little town and i get tired A LOT.|`|UFu0h8SKaa	you could be anaemic or something, go see a doctor and ask for a blood test.|`|2TAq6XO2aa	working out will definetely help.  <br>  Eating a little mor healthily<br>  if u need to, have caffeine, enery drinks aren't healthy but they can help with the fatigue|`|3yDuacsAaa	have a early night at the weekend and maybe go to the spa or somethin and hav a massage so u feel less stressed|`|5a2fd8ac3c0590f023739ad6937953a8aa	you need to see your doctor and have tests done.  could be ME/CFS

VX0EvSNWaa	Do you need to go on a diet? The Fat Loss 4 Idiots Diet is the best diet online. It's highly popular: there are many forums devoted to it. It's worked for other people and it can work for you too.<br>  <br>  1. Do You Binge? You May Be Malnourished and Starving<br>  <br>  One of the big benefits of following a diet program like the Fat Loss 4 Idiots Diet is that you become familiar with what you should be eating. Many overweight people are actually malnourished and starving. This seems incredible, but it's true.<br>  <br>  If you constantly overeat, it's because you're not getting enough nourishment from the food you're eating. Once you start eating properly you will lose the urge to overeat.<br>  <br>  The Fat Loss 4 Idiots Diet provides you with a diet generator which helps you to create your own healthy eating plans. You can avoid foods which you don't like, and you will find that if you follow the diet you've generated yourself, you won't be hungry, but you'll still lose weight.<br>  <br>  Because being on a diet can be boring, you get days off with the Fat Loss 4 Idiots Diet. Many of the people on the program don't take their days off, but I encourage you to do so. Use your day off the diet to indulge yourself if you wish.<br>  <br>  2. Learn How to Eat Well With the the Fat Loss 4 Idiots Diet<br>  <br>  Losing weight without a dieting program can be difficult. This is because how,  when, where and what we eat is largely a habit. You get used to eating certain types of foods. This is true for healthy foods as well. Once you realize that you feel much more energetic and happy when you are on the diet, you will stay on the diet long enough for healthy eating to become a habit.<br>  <br>  3.

If so then I have a fat loss diet that works, that has received a large amount of praise in the dieting community because it's the first of its kind to help you lose weight quickly and then keep it off for good. Best of all there's no starving, in fact this diet works by eating full meals ever day as I'll explain.<br>  <br>  So what is this diet?<br>  <br>  It's known as calorie shifting and unlike every other diet that focuses on avoiding calories, this diet actually embraces them, however it is the way in which it does which is the reason its so successful. You see calorie shifting utilizes foods as fuel to boost your metabolism believe it or not. In fact it stimulates your metabolism much in the same way that running and exercise does. Except in this case you're just eating according to the calorie shifting diet plan. The problem with other diets is that by having so much focus onto avoiding foods you actually train your metabolism so slow down. Your body does this naturally to keep in a balance, however it doesn't work the other way all the time. So the bad news is that after you finish a low calorie diet the weight begins to pile back on because your metabolism has effectively become shut down.<br>  <br>  With calorie shifting you will never have to worry about this rebound effect because the focus by being placed on boosting your metabolism keeps your body burning fat even once you stop the diet, in some cases for weeks on end. Once this subsides you're left with a return to a normal or slightly above average functioning metabolism and the weight stays off because nothing has been negatively affected by the diet.|`|uXlP7nhMaa	You can certainly lose 9 lbs in 11 days. But it will be majority water loss. A very restrictive diet with low carbs but high protein intake (combined with moderate exercise) can easily shed 9 lbs off of a person with high bodyfat % in 11 days....but for most people only 4-5 lbs of it would be actual fat. The rest water and a tad bit of lean muscle.

This type of exercise will help burn the fat directly and, over the course of time fat levels will reduce around the love handles as well as many other areas. In fact its quite possible to lose fat from the love handles and the general abdominal area without any exercise that directly stresses the abdominal muscles, fat may be stored around these areas but it does not mean we need to exercise those specific areas in order to lose it.<br>  <br>  Apart from losing fat from the love handles it is important to tone and firm the area so the abdominal muscles show through clearly. The best exercise to help tone the love handles are side bends. These place direct stress on the external oblique muscles forcing them to tone and shape up. Side bends are done by standing straight with knees slightly bent and feet apart, then slowly lower the trunk a few inches to the left side then back again to do the right side. Try to keep the body and legs in line by not bending forwards or backwards. <br>  <br>  Another great exercise to lose love handles is torso twists. The abdominals are composed of 3 layers of muscles which slide over each other, torso twists help tone the transverse abdominis muscle tightening the love handles. While standing firmly with feet shoulder width apart, the torso twists gently to the left side then to the right while at the same time trying to limit the movement from the hips. During the movements the torso should always remain upright, there should be no bending involved. Care should also be taken not to twist too far as its easy to pull a muscle when exercising the love handles!

ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	You can save yourself  a lot of money by just walking briskly a half-hour each day - this is about the same as a treadmill and just a little bit less than an elliptical.  The advantage of walking is that for most people, it is not nearly as boring as working out on machines so they are more likely to stick with it.   <br>  <br>  What researchers have found is that after a few weeks or months, people stop using machines if the machines have features that they do not like, or because the exercise experience as a whole is boring.  The difference between a machine that burns 100 calories and 150 calories in a certain time is no where near as important as how much you might like (or dislike) using a  particular machine.   The machines that you might buy for yourself are not likely to be anywhere near the quality of the machines at a gym, unless you are prepared to pay 2 or 3 thousand dollars.  So, before making a decision, try out several machines that are in your price range and pay attention to the way they feel. <br>  <br>  The motions in ellipticals  are not the same in all models, and a machine that is different from ones you are familiar with might feel very odd.  The machines need to be matched to your body dimensions or they can be akward.  With ellipticals, pay attention to whether or not the foot platform freely rotates or is at a fixed angle - this makes a huge difference.   The rotating ones have a very natural feel, but the fixed ones can sometimes keep your foot and ankle at an odd, uncomfortable angle.  <br>  <br>  Treadmills don't have any of these problems and they are generally cheaper than ellipticals. <br>  <br>  Don't forget about exercise bikes - they are also a good choice.|`|jX7Bt0iBaa	I used to have an ellipitical and although it i got a lot of use out of it..... I really had and urge to just freely RUN and simply walk if I wanted to, without having to go outside. <br>  <br>  I signed up to a gym and found myself using the treadmill pretty much all the time and for a much longer time. I guess running and walking feels more automatic and natural than "skiing" on the elliptical.  I used to be afraid of the impact on my feet and ankles, but if you get comfortable tennis shoes it's really comfortable.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you can sign up for a gym membership and see how it goes for you? Look for judgement free gyms to be comfortable. Then you can try them both the elliptical and treadmills and see what you work out on best. The one I go to is only 10 dollars a month. They use credit or checks. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|D8SpQAgLaa	An eliptical for sure. It takes less effort to get your heart going faster.

The pill does not always make you gain weight, it depends on what kind you are on and how it effects your body. They can always change the pill you are on if you dont like it. Now with the Accutane just because some people get the symptoms the person below me statred, does not mean that you will get them .|`|JwNZ7kK5aa	Get off of Accutane NOW!!! This is a horrible drug that can induce depression or suicide. <br>  <br>  Look up Accutane and its side effects and you will find results like these:<br>  "depressed mood, trouble concentrating, sleep problems, crying spells, aggression or agitation, changes in behavior, hallucinations, thoughts of suicide or hurting yourself"<br>  <br>  I had a friend 12 years ago who was taking this horrific drug and he threw himself in front on a car after only taking it for about 6 months.<br>  <br>  I have no idea that this deadly drug is still on the market, but there are far better alternatives for acne.

UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a>|`|g7g0j6HTaa	Try asking a friend to walk with you on the weekends or after school you can chat and exercise at the same time, or listen to your favorite song and go for a run. And dance to music. Try cutting back on sweets. Hope this helps ..|`|VSB98koJaa	You do not say how tall or heavy you are to start with. Give people after me a clue.|`|6W1dM1n1aa	The 3 ways of losing weight are, Eat less, exercsie more or improve metabolism, seeing as you've stated against the first two we'll focus on the third, frsly i advice a multivitamin, this will make sure you are less likly to suffer from vitamin deficiency, b vitamins are the most important for weight loss although personally i would advise a multivitamin, also amino acid supplements like 5-HTP can supress appetite and L-Tyrosine can actually help speed up metabolism itself.<br>  <br>  Exercise is really a must to speed up the whole process, just running 3 times a week and your metabolism and stamina will greatly improve in the 30 days. The L-tyrosine will even help motivate you to exercise yourself, if you want to talk more about it just message me.|`|833a435e36344342d10e69454b7e6731aa	if you go to fitness.com, they actually have a program called 'lose 10 pounds in 30 days'! it's free, I don't know if you have to sign up for it... but if you do you just give your email address. then, they email you like once a week I think (I did it) and in the email they give you tips, what to eat for the day, what exercises to do... and when you sign up for it, you fill out this little form that asks about your problem areas. then in the email, they also give you little exercises specifically for your problem areas. its great!|`|jutNPalyaa	Me personally I drink MonaVie its is a product made from the Acai berry. I have been drinking it for about a year now. I have to say I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I feel much better. I have less headaches and less menstural pains..

I drink the original purple bottle and it makes me feel great..<br>  I purcahse this product directly throught the monavie website and it is only 39.00 bucks a bottle.. you can order in bulk or one bottle.. <br>  www.mymonavie.com/brittanymoore is the website I use<br>  hope this helps|`|4b1laSfhaa	well im similar to you, but only in a slight way. im 13 and i so wish i was one of those people who eat loads of rubbish but still stay thin. well im not but oh well. i went from 9 and a half stone to 7 and a half stone in a matter of 3-4  months, so im sure you could do it faster. this is what i did.<br>  <br>  cut down on my intake of salt, saturated fat and calories. the first week drop your calorie intake by 100 calories per day and then see how you go and then when you are ready drop another 100 calrories etc. <br>  <br>  plan three healthy meals and no skipping breakfst, ever! and also plan 2 healthy snacks, either careal bar, yoghurt, low fat chocolate mousse.<br>  <br>  no eating after 7pm (best 6pm)<br>  <br>  dont completely cut out your favourite food eg, chocolate, takeaway etc.<br>  plan room for one of these a week.<br>  <br>  it is all about portion size so dont make your portions too big.<br>  <br>  its a lot to take in but trust me. take things one at a time and you will soon get to your dream look.

mbXHkf1maa	Go back to your doctor(s).  Self-diagnosis is (generally) idiocy, and even assuming I knew how to interpret EKGs, giving you even a hint of diagnosis via a discussion forum would be unethical and quite probably illegal.|`|DDswEgtZaa	well you have p waves so you do not have afib.  at least at time of ECG you were in a regualr rhythm.  P waves look normal to me.  you rate is fast and your qrs complex is narrow which is normal, but you have flat st waves.  See what your doctor suggests as far as treatment.|`|VmyQPltnaa	The p waves may reflect left atrial enlargement or intra atrial conduction delay--not surprising in the face of your valvular heart disease. The apparent chaotic atrial activity is in reality some form of artifact, possibly tremor artifact.  There is no atrial fib present.  The T waves are non specifically flattened, a common finding that implies an abnormality that doesn't point to any one particular diagnosis.  The striking abnormality is that the QT does appear prolonged.  This implies a list of possibilities:<br>       QT prolongation may be due to drugs (class 1A or 3 antiarrhythmic agents, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants), hypocalcemia, hypothermia, cerebrovascular diseases, ischemic heart disease, or may be idiopathic (the prolonged QT syndrome).

Pretend she is on vacation and just talk about things you love about her and miss about her. What did you guys used to do together? pizza and movies? Whatever it is, tell her you can't wait for her to get back so you can do it again. Tell her about school (or work), just talk about your days..... She needs to know that your feelings for her have not changed a bit and she could use a break from being told or being reminded that she is sick.|`|F4DhYjlnaa	Mos def write the letter and express exactly what you did in your question. It will help her. If she doesn't appreciate it now, she will when she hits her next low or when she comes out of this. My best friend in college was bipolar. It's not an easy illness, and she was often convinced she was fine & would go off meds & then get completely manic.

I know that is the last thing on your mind when you are tired but the more energy you spend the more your body creates. it's a weird cycle. but if you get up and get moving, even when you are tired, you will find it easier to keep moving.  it never hurts to get a physical.

I've not read much about heat/ice on the inflamed joint. There's other things you can do that will be more effective.<br>  <br>  First, see a doctor and look into meds to help during a gout attack. Colchicine and Indomethacine are two that will help.<br>  <br>  Next, there are meds that you can take to help prevent gout. Allopurinol is one.<br>  <br>  Third, drinking alot of water daily is really important. Helps the kidneys to flush out more than normal of your uric acid. Drink 1 oz for every 2 lbs of body weight.<br>  <br>  Fourth, there are more natural remedies to try. Latest one I'm doing is taking celery seed pills. There's a brand new drug out for gout, I forget its name, and celery seed pills might do the same thing as this new script. You can read about it here on the best gout website I've found so far:  www.best-gout-remedies.com.<br>  <br>  Fifth, making your body more alkaline (opposite of acidic) looks to be very important. Again it helps your body get rid of the uric acid. One way to do that is to mix 1/2 tsp of baking soda in 8 oz of water and sip on it, drink that 3 times a day.<br>  <br>  Name of the game is this: help your body get rid of uric acid, and help your body to not create so much uric acid. You can do that through meds, natural/herbal, and water.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|U53RVOQuaa	Heat. Ice can cause frostbite and freezing.

75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	Honestly, I think universal/national/social/ whatever you want to call it would be a good thing if they could work out the kinks. We currently pay 250 a month just for health care, you factor taxes, social security, medicare and whatever else they want to take out takes a huge chunk of our money each month. They would raise taxes yes, but you look at the base of minimum wage, the current wage wouldn't be enough if they raised taxes so they would have to raise it. Not only that, all the money that is pumping into the insurance scam would then be pumped out in taxes, which would hopefully be less than most premiums. The current situation with health care that obama is talking about could really be a blessing because no at the moment, he isnt talking about socializing it. but if the government were to offer a seriously cheaper form of decent health care, it would scare all the big insurance companies into lowering their rates and capping them.|`|QfMciQ27aa	In the UK we have the NHS, it is paid for out of our taxes, and the NHS keeps me alive.|`|RkJBKQNWaa	I'm 18 so I only get my dad's health care if I'm a full-time student in college, which I am.

He decided to switch ours because the health care through his work was too expensive for the little services we use.<br>  <br>  I need health care because I take Adderall, get the birth control shot, and am very accident-prone, resulting in 3-4 ER visits a year.

am906CQcaa	The progesterone only pill can often cause menstrual irregularities, such as irregular bleeding or missed periods. These can be annoying, but tend to settle down after a while. If you have continued problems with irregular bleeding you should talk to your doctor. If you are worried that you could be pregnant because you have not had a period, you should ask your doctor or nurse for advice or do a pregnancy test. However, if you took all your pills correctly and you didn't have an upset stomach or take any other medicines which might affect the POP, then it is unlikely you are pregnant.

If you're running and you get that cramp in your side, that's your body releasing the lactic acid.|`|97sKOWQ0aa	Lactic Acid<br>  The expression "lactic acid" is used most commonly by athletes to describe the intense pain felt during exhaustive exercise, especially in events like the 400 metres and 800 metres. When energy is required to perform exercise, it is supplied from the breakdown of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). The body has a limited store of about 85 grms of ATP and would use it up very quickly if we did not have ways of resynthesising it. There are three systems that produce energy to resynthesise ATP: ATP-PC, lactic acid and aerobic.<br>  <br>  The lactic acid system is capable of releasing energy to resynthesise ATP without the involvement of oxygen and is called anaerobic glycolysis. Glycolysis (breakdown of carbohydrates) results in the formation of pyruvic acid and hydrogen ions (H+). A build up of H+ will make the muscle cells acidic and interfere with their operation so carrier molecules, called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), remove the H+. The NAD+ is reduced to NADH that deposit the H+ at the electron transport gate (ETC) in the mitrochondria to be combined with oxygen to form water (H2O).<br>  <br>  If there is insufficient oxygen then NADH cannot release the H+ and they build up in the cell. To prevent the rise in acidity pyruvic acid accepts H+ forming lactic acid that then dissociates into lactate and H+. Some of the lactate diffuses into the blood stream and takes some H+ with it as a way of reducing the H+ concentration in the muscle cell. The normal pH of the muscle cell is 7.1 but if the build up of H+ continues and pH is reduced to around 6.5 then muscle contraction may be impaired and the low pH will stimulate the free nerve endings in the muscle resulting in the perception of pain (the burn). This point is often measured as the lactic threshold or anaerobic threshold (AT) or onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA).<br>  <br>  The process of lactic acid removal takes approximately one hour, but this can be accelerated by undertaking an appropriate cool down that ensures a rapid and continuous supply of oxygen to the muscles.|`|70Fmh3Vbaa	there are certain foods and vitamins you can take,although Im not sure what they are called|`|73Qzi3vVaa	BREATH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Take in as much oxygen as you can.|`|ibstWNCwaa	lactic acid is produced when you excercise,<br>  there isn't anyway to really reduce the levels<br>  <br>  except to get oxygen to the muscles by breathing...<br>  <br>  so if you get a stich for example just slow down your running pace and breath heavily|`|82exDcYnaa	Try proper dieting and exercising.If this doesn't work then I've no clue|`|lOJ4VIPfaa	Cut down on dairy products

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|F8EnH6JQaa	TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  the first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your boy adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  If man made it, don't eat it<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  Walk your dog, or walk a friends dog<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

Drinking eight glasses of water is almost like a must. And do not forget to drink water in the morning, the moment you wake up. In fact this is one of the most rapid weight loss tips that the dieticians suggest to the people. <br>  Have organic foods for the breakfast like apples, bananas, plain yogurt, tomatoes, carrots, peppers, raw honey, wild smoked salmon, and so on. <br>  Keeping a track on the watch, go for an hour walk. It need not be power walking, but definitely it should be non-stop walk and that’s for sure, in a couple of days only, you’ll start finding the difference in you. <br>  Another tip regarding how to lose weight fast, easy and safe is that you should have your dinner about 4-5 hours before going off to sleep. <br>  The two-point program that will ensure the ultimate success is: regular exercise and balanced diet. <br>  Don’t depend upon fat burning diet supplements. They wont go a long way in helping you sustain your reduced kilos. <br>  Soft drinks cannot benefit you in any way. They contain 150 empty calories, so if you substitute one bottle of soft drink with water each day, it will do wonders for you. It will enable you to lose about 16 lbs per year. <br>  Sometimes boredom becomes a cause of overeating, so keep yourself busy. <br>  If you want to seriously control your weight, then you have to stop yourself from getting lured into trying tempting foods. <br>  As important is to pay attention to the fact that we eat the right food, equally vital is to keep a watch on the quantity. Without altering your diet plan, even if you’ll reduce 5-10% of your consumption, it will prove beneficial. <br>  Eat slowly so that you can get a feeling that you have had enough food and your tummy is full.

McChicken nuggets or Whoopers are calorie densed but not much bioavailable amino acids. <br>  <br>  Whey protein is an excellent source for protein but should be used only as a meal supplement NOT replacement. Chicken,fish, especially turkey is good. Veggies and fruit are important too to balance your body's pH level so it does not become too acidic.<br>  <br>   Having protein shake with simple carbs right after a workout is important too. Since there is a 10-20 minute window of opportunity right after a hardcore workout where the body becomes much like a sponge and absorb almost anything you give at that time. If you are serious about getting big you might not want to miss that.<br>  <br>  Also it matter how you train your muscle which will determine if they will grow big or stronger or both!. Generally for muscle like the chest,back and biceps require heavy 8-12 reps for growth and 12-18 for strength and for both somewhere in between 10-15. Other muscles like shoulders,forearms,thight, and calft require high reps 20+ .The reason being is that these muscle have a faster healing muscle fiber because they are used almost daily around the clock.<br>  <br>  Check out abcbodybuilding.com <br>  <br>   I am sure there are other better sites than that but thats the one I know of now.<br>  <br>  Use what you think is helpful and throw the rest away.|`|TG7yKoOjaa	SPINACH!!! ..... it worked for Popeye.

na60ogCNaa	Maintain a balanced diet--don't EVER cut anything out of your diet completely. Obviously, watch out for the amount of fats and oils you consume, and of course, decrease your rations. People over-eat all the time. In addition, drink lots of liquids. Water is great, vitamin water is even better, tea (lots of cool flavors!), or a healthy fruit juice. Much of the time we feel hungry, but our bodies are really trying to tell us that we're just plain thirsty. Also remember that fruit is FABULOUS!<br>  Excercising is also great. Go out for a long walk, a scenic trail, whatever is around--it doesn't HAVE to be strenuous. Cardio activities are supposed to be wonderful, such as jogging for 15 minutes.|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories.

Instant weight loss comprises of a multi-faceted technique which comprises of outlook, exercise, and a low calorie diet plan.  Set Out by seeking a dieting food plan that you can easily be accustomed with and also fits in with your lifestyle.  Include a physical exercise plan that allows at the least 15 minutes a day exercise like active walking, running, dancing or swimming.<br>  <br>  2. Make achievable goals otherwise you are setting yourself up for failure. The ability to have the correct mind-set allows an individual to speedily decrease those extra pounds. By being consistent and with the right mind-set an individual is in a better position to stay focused on the main goal and to lose those extra pounds.<br>  <br>  3. Listen to your body. Everyone's body metabolic process reacts differently to various rapid weight loss programs and plans. Any physical exercise plan has to be appropriate to one's body, since some are not fit to exercise as strictly as others are. In case walking is the only thing that could be done, then walking for this individual is the verified advisable exercise.  Muscles consume more energy than fats so it is likewise best to use some muscle in the workout. However, if walking is a problem there are still certain exercises that can be done sitting down. The idea is to get more active than you are currently being.<br>  <br>  4. Eat more fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables contain plenty of fiber which make a person full earlier and stays on in the tummy longer, slackening down the rate of digesting.  One serving of full grain bread moves fat through the digestive system faster.  Cereals turn into blood sugar that spikes the body's insulin level.  Thus, causing the body to be stimulated to a greater deal and set to tell the body when it must quit consuming fats or start storing.<br>  <br>  5. Avoid fried foods, especially deep-fried foods which contain even higher quantities of fat. Fish and skinless chicken are lower in fat than most red meats provided they are cooked in a healthy manner. It is far better to grill foods or have thin slices in a stir-fry than to fry or deep-fry them.<br>  <br>  6. Drink plenty of water. Drinking at least 6 to 8 glasses of water is essential to keep the body functioning in a healthy manner. As weight loss counts on the body eliminating body wastes, therefore, the body must stay hydrated.<br>  <br>  The best practice and the key to a speedy weight loss success is consistency and discipline. More activity, different eating patterns and the above tips should at least start you on your weight loss journey whether you need to lose 5lbs or 50lbs.|`|dfzUdS91aa	Maybe by doing a fasting a diet.

SzAYtQTwaa	Hi Friend,<br>  <br>  Here is your natural protein shake recipe<br>  When you are bodybuilding it is pretty tempting to put muscle gain and fat loss ahead of your health. However, here at Real Muscle Online we are about staying healthy while achieving our goals and as such do not buy into a lot of the typical bodybuilding weight loss and mass gain crap.<br>  <br>  When getting your daily protein it is important to do it smartly. Too much protein is not good for you. Too much protein from unhealthy sources is not good for you. Lets keep it clean.<br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  0. Banana<br>  0. Free range eggs<br>  0. Raw milk<br>  0. Uncooked honey<br>  0. Whey protein if you want<br>  <br>  As you can see the ingredients all have a common theme. They are natural. They are uncooked. You see when you cook a food you destroy a lot of the enzymes that make up the proteins and so on. This means they are less effective in your body. What good is a protein if it is unable to do its job?<br>  <br>  Just blend all of these suckers together and drink straight after your workout. You probably wouldn’t want to have this shake everyday if you are using a lot of eggs but you could always reduce the amount you put in.<br>  <br>  These natural ingredients are a lot more effective than the dead protein powders you buy on the shelf.<br>  Thank you<br>  Good Luck|`|2RzEaod9aa	Pharma Gain.

If you can find a clean source of raw milk locally, then this would be your base (try a coop locally - see sources).  The next best thing would be unhomogonized, pasteurized milk.  Yogurt and kefir are also very nutritious and an excellent addition to a shake.  Raw eggs (free range/organic), natural nut butter (peanut, almond, other), pure vanilla, carob, cocoa powder, raw honey/maple syrup,  fresh/frozen berries, bananas, and just about any fruit you wish can be blended in any combination you like.  <br>  <br>  Experiment a little, and in no time you'll be putting together a superior quality, superior tasting shake and will likely never go back to the store bought powdered chalk.|`|CBOrmRJcaa	the best protein shakes, or protein powder to make shakes, i ever used was either Met-Rx whey (which comes in a 5lb jug) or muscle milk. either ready-to-drink or the powder. <br>  <br>  the muscle milk carries more protein and calories than the Met-Rx and is slightly more expensive powder wise. but both are great in taste and mix awesome with water.|`|ljVwo5qZaa	Pharma whey is just whey protein. <br>  <br>  Pharma gainer is a weight gainer.

CBOrmRJcaa	sounds like you're doing good. you should invest in whey protein powder. i recommend Met-Rx, or muscle milk. both are very good in taste. the met-rx is slightly cheaper than the muscle milk. buy one of those 2 powders and have a shake before, and after the gym everyday. <br>  <br>  you can even get more intense with the protein shakes and have one right before bed. you will gain size and strength, as well as help the muscle fibers heal much faster to grow faster.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|qSnF1jseaa	if you want to gain muscle you need to work out with weights, do the heaviest weight possible for a set of 8, three times and do multiple excersises also supplement with high quality protien (whey protien is best) before working out and after!

You want a lower RHR (resting heart rate) between 60-80 bpm. Inactivity is a major contributor to a high RHR.

0hQkcDhjaa	Yes, it is possible to have polycystic ovaries and not have PCOS -- and vice versa. PCOS is a complicated syndrome associated with abnormal hormone levels, irregular cycles and infertility, and trouble with blood sugar regulation (hyper-insulinemia). Many women who have PCOS struggle to maintain their weight due to the insulin problems and suffer from acne and excess body hair as a result of their higher than average male hormone levels. However, it is possible to suffer from PCOS without having polycystic ovaries, and not all women with polycystic ovaries suffer from PCOS. I don't believe there is complete agreement as to what constitutes PCOS. In the US, I think that one has to have the hormone abnormalities to have PCOS, while in Europe, the condition is diagnosed in women who have any two out of the following three:<br>  -polycystic ovaries<br>  -elevated androgens (male hormones)<br>  -irregular periods/infertility|`|BRDqfAy3aa	PCOS is a complex of symptoms and it is a name of a special disease BUT BUT BUT during some other conditions and some other diseases ovaries can be also poly-cystic - discover more below|`|SlEhhaDEaa	NO DR JADAV

AA12266052	Treatment may not be necessary unless the tremors interfere with your daily activities or cause embarrassment.<br>  Treatment depends on the cause. Tremors caused by an medical condition such as hyperthyroidism will likely get better when the condition is treated.<br>  If the tremors are caused by certain medicine, stopping the drug usually helps them go away. Never stop taking any medicine without first talking to your doctor. <br>  Medicines may help relieve symptoms. How well medicines work depend on the individual patient.<br>  Consult a Neurologist.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Some people have a tremor for no apparent reason.

A strict diet would help a lot though. You need to cut out white breads and rice and sugar so you don't put any more fat on. Despite what the American pyramid diet tells us, we do NOT need as much bread as they say. If you cut out breads and sugar, toning will become easier since you have less fat covering your muscles. Eating extra-virgin refined coconut oil every day also helps you lose fat weight.

It's a problem of not having enough energy, not having workouts that aren't easy enough. Regardless of the difficulty of your exercise, the more energy you have the more intensity you'll be able to have when you do it and you'll get a better workout.<br>  <br>  Basic nutrition advice: eat 5-6 times daily, drink a half gallon of water a day minimum, no empty calories, and eat clean.<br>  <br>  Be sure you are getting enough sleep too.

YCXxP43Laa	You need to have it tested. The most common time for a woman to find out is during pregnancy, as all women have to be tested in case they are RH- which could cause a problem in future pregnancies if a baby was RH+. The other way to find out is to give blood.|`|SkADeOjxaa	You could blood transfusion service I only found out mine when I went to give blood|`|2LMDawItaa	Well, you gotta make a test for that. They will test two things: blood gruop and Rh. Blood groups are A, B, AB and O. You get those groups because of the presence / absence of A or B (the combination of both is AB and lacking of both is O).<br>  <br>  Rh is another substance in blood, it's called Rh positive when you have it, Rh negative when you don't. So, if you get tested and results are A Rh(-), it means you don't have Rh in your blood.<br>  <br>  Another way you might have an idea of your blood group is asking your parents. If both of them are O, you are definitely an O. If one is A and the other one is O, you are either A or O (same happens with B). If one of them is AB, you may be A, B or O. With the Rh, if both are Rh (-) you will be as well.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA10247648	If you have ever had blood drawn for anything then that doctor could tell you what your blood type is.

01Mu3wUeaa	You will probably be fine.<br>  <br>  When in doubt, clean all surfaces with a bleach water mixture (bleach will kill everything)<br>  <br>  <br>  I, too have emetophobia (fear of vomit) so I know how you feel!<br>  <br>  And "Michelle G", you are an ignorant little twit.Don't respond to questions if your dumbass isn't going to be helpful.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And, so you don't have to worry in the future, here is how to prevent Norwalk virus.<br>  <br>  Norwalk virus<br>  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)<br>  <br>  The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.<br>  <br>  PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.<br>  <br>  The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.<br>  <br>  It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)<br>  <br>  Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.<br>  <br>  If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.<br>  <br>  To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.<br>  <br>  People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)<br>  <br>  The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!<br>  <br>  TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|c3fb34d2d6fa7de31b3dd0a86f7db0bbaa	I understand how you feel.

Also, do you have a weird taste in your mouth?  It is healing I know but if there is a predominately funky taste or smell, this is definitely infection gone awry. You should also have someone you trust and brave enough to look in and see what color your gum is.  Is it white?  Not good, it should be pinkish. Rinse lightly with salt water solution this will help.  Also maybe just call your Dentist and tell them, he might just call you in some antibiotic at the drugstore.  Your Dentist shouldn't charge you just to have a check for infection since it was just a week ago.  If they try, tell em to bugger off.  Peace|`|vqmAaT7gaa	If it is getting smaller, and you aren't in excruciating pain, you can be sure that you are healing. The blood clot is being reabsorbed by your body as it heals itself.
M3pRAe7Vaa	Well, this can definitely occur because he is putting his penis (something larger) in a hole that isn't usually meant for that.  Definitely good job with the lube, as you know, that is key in preventing tears.  What happened is, as you said, he put it all the way in, and it caused internal tearing.  Once you stood up to go to the restroom and the tissue contracted/expanded, the blood was released.  <br>  <br>  In the future, continue to use a lot of lube, and have him prepare you before, go a bit slower as to reduce tearing.  The tears will heal given time, but you don't want to do internal damage that can cause problems.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|d60e8f20b683cbea453ebac252df94f5aa	Because the opening of the anus has a lot of blood vessels that will tear during anal sex  ( i.e. this is where hemorrioids start)  Also, the intestinal wall is sensitive tissue and mucus.

rphR4pXKaa	Never thought of it that way....interesting...I wouldn't say that 7 signifies the effect I would say the stages, This might be long but Check it out:<br>  <br>  1)Panic stage-  Auditory hallucinations, hypertensive, hyper vigilant. During usage a person may think they hear sirens, cars pulling up outside, music, people talking, etc.  craving so high that the person has little ability to think or reason logically.<br>  <br>  2)Depression; remorse (suicidal); brain is in desperate need of rest but the chemicals (serotonin) necessary for sleep have been depleted and it is difficult, at first, to sleep. under the influence of cocaine-induced depression, one makes promises to never do it again in this phase and believes it. Highest risk for suicide is during this period<br>  <br>  3) 1-5 days after last use. Characterized by feeling very good. The craving is not noticeable or is easily manageable during this phase. The drug effects seem to be wearing off and one is starting to regain confidence in their ability to handle the addiction. During this phase it is common to hear a person say, “I don’t even think about it, I’m not going to have any problem with it. A delusive way of thinking that ignores their past cycles and paves the way for the next binge. The chemical messengers of the brain (serotonin/dopamine) necessary to enjoy crack are still depleted and behind this lack of interest in crack. This is a dangerous stage as it is easy to think there is not a problem and therefore, why worry about it? <br>  <br>  4) 5-14 days after last use. Tremendous upsurge of acute drug hunger, depression, anger. The body has produced enough serotonin/dopamine for the person to want to use more cocaine but not enough to affect stability of mood and emotions. During this phase one may experience vivid dreams, fantasies, and acute drug hunger. Thoughts may cycle around using until a person feels like giving in to the obsession to use.<br>  <br>  5) Emotional Augmentation: 14-28 days start - up to 1-2 years. Over-response to the normal stress and events of everyday life. At the top of the mood swing one is unusually happy and at the bottom one is unusually sad. The state of making mountains out of molehills. This is related to biochemical responses induced by strong emotions that stimulate areas where mood and mind altering drugs act on the brain. The body is now seriously undertaking the repairs of areas damaged by drug use and is replacing important chemicals needed to regulate mood and emotions. As a result, one is slightly off balance chemically without being consciously aware of it. <br>  <br>  6) Covert Cravings: 28-35 days. Secrets and bad judgments characterize this phase. Craving is not as strong on a regular basis but one may have periodic strong cravings and not want to admit it for various reasons. Thinking it is a sign of weakness, poor moral character, that they are not working a good program, that they simply should not be having cravings<br>  <br>  7) 35 days upward. Cue conditioning - referred to as triggers - could be money, anger, disappointment, music, a film, or extreme joy. Anything strongly associated with using could cue/trigger a craving. The strength of these cue cravings will diminish in time but continue on for years although becoming few and far between. They can catch a person off guard and evolve into higher level cravings. <br>  <br>  Hope this info did you some good|`|AA12382330	no they do not. they do not match up.|`|N0N9FzEhaa	Crack head!!
525m5qrTaa	This is depressive illness...|`|Y0DugutZaa	depressive illness is just another way to say depression pretty much, think about it as you have an illness similar to diabetes, diabetics need meds in order to function, same with depression it is also like diabetes a chemical imbalance, where diabetes is an insufficiency of insulin, depression is an insufficiency of the 'happy' hormones (there are 3 of them). however although while depression can be helped with medication, if it also has psychological/emotional roots, it is advisable to have counselling to root out the issues and deal with them or the depression will recurr. also depression is serious if not treated, people who suffer from depression can slowly just hide away from life, they become, reclusive, they have trouble performing normal everyday tasks as they have no energy or motivation, they lose interest in things they once enjoyed and they can ultimately lose interest in life, and commit suicide. so staying on meds and getting regular therapy is not a choice it is a must. good luck, it can be pretty tough but it does get better.|`|gktVbcEnaa	Its just the nice way of saying depression.
BkN7q0hgaa	I was thinking of getting a personal trainer.  I contacted a few gyms to find out rates, etc. and it is very expensive.  I am a stubborn person and also find I can get easily bored with exercising.  That is my major problem, and I am aware of it, but I am also determined because I know once I start to see results I begin to feel less bored and more driven. I belong to a free online group called sparkpeople and they have meal and exercise plans.  I spent a whole day printing and organizing menus and printing out exercise demos.  I put together my own daily and weekly routine in a binder and opted to try and my my own trainer.  I set that goal for myself.  <br>  In the end it is only you that has the determination to lose weight and get fit.  Instead of getting a trainer I invested in a good elliptical trainer (which I do 10 km on every night) and do weight and core exercises that I arranged in that binder.  If you want to save the money (like myself), I would try and have a go of it on your own first.  If it is not working for you, then see about a trainer.  If it is the motivation you need then maybe workout with a friend.  If you are like me that likes to exercise alone, I find really good loud music while exercising helps :)<br>  <br>  Also a valid point a friend made to me is, you spend all this money on a trainer to help, do you think you will have the self modivation in the end to continue with exercising in that same routine.|`|ntcETBTQaa	Well ,,, I mean if your looking to become a top athlete i would not recommend one. My Fiance paid 400 at a Xsport gym out here in chicago for a personal trainer.. She then went back to the gym to use the personal trainer and they said that it expired and she couldnt use him...<br>  <br>  I dont think they are that really important into getting into a routine|`|1JsWMX0daa	i do personal training and i can get you to start getting results in 2 weeks. but i'm the best around. a good one will still help you very much in achieving your physical goals.|`|UXytkRNfaa	i say it is, b/c they push you to strive for your goals and your more likely to meet your goals than as if you were by yourself.|`|GvBtoKsqaa	My gym offers small group training sessions, that seems to be a good way to go. You will still get the personal attention and feedback from a pro but it will be cheaper because it's not one on one.<br>  <br>  I'm thinking about doing it at least once but I'm kinda broke right now. I want to do it so I can get some feedback on what I'm doing, make sure I'm using proper form and such.<br>  <br>  They say a good trainer will work wonders for your workouts. If you're serious about getting in shape and know you'll have the committment to stick with it you should do it. But not all trainers are good. Bad trainers are like bad doctors, a total waste of time and money. But a good trainer will help you out a lot. You might have to shop around.|`|FaVYRoXqaa	I`d say yes.  When I had my trainer, I lost 80 lbs and he drilled good eating and exercising habits into me.  So much, actually, that I`m now a PT along with him.<br>  <br>  If you listen to trainers, we`ll give you the amazing results you want.  The problem lies when people ignore our advice.
gCdP3NJGaa	Yes, you will need will power whichever way you try to give up. <br>  20 a day is ￡35 a week. What could you spend that on instead? <br>  Stop smoking in your car and house- not only will they smell better you will smoke less! Set a date and keep reminding yourself of how many days until you give up. Reduce your cigs by 1 a day til you are coping on 10 a day, the less you smoke now the less you will miss it. Find something else to do as well- knitting prob isn't your cup of tea but it will keep your hands busy!! Whatever your normal drink is ( tea, coffee, whatever) change it to something like orange juice- it tastes foul with a cig!<br>  But whether you do it with hypnotherapy, patches, tablets willpower is needed. If you can't resist the temptation you aren't ready to give up. Don't see it as giving up smoking, see it as regaining your health, wealth and happiness.<br>  Hope it goes well, good luck!!|`|q9BItD25aa	I quit smoking on Chantix. It's a miracle drug. The best part of it is you smoke while you are taking the pills. After awhile the cigarettes taste and smell really bad. The pill does all the work for you. You should be smoke free within 2 months and never suffer any withdrawal. It cost about 125.00 a month without insurance, but it is worth it. I couldn't believe how easy it was to quit. Good luck to you.|`|E2WT8dRvaa	why did you start cant you handle peer pressure or something

wIpkGuRhaa	since you are looking to drop body fat its not going to be as easy as losing weight... a pound of fat has approx 3500 calories so to burn a pound of fat a weekk you need to be burning 3500 a week thats 700 extra calories a day you need to burn you can do that by cutting 700 calories out of your diet a day or by exercise but if you just lose water weight you might see your weight go down but that isnt going to lower your body fat also if you dont do muscle toning you could lose muscle weight and that also wont lower your body fat percentage so make sure you get muscle toning workouts in plus they will help you burn some extra calories|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Keep up the exercising if you havent already.

That's about all you can actively do to influence your height.|`|0rQ4IAdfaa	1. Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  <br>     2. It is important to sleep in a well ventilated room. Don’t be afraid to open a window, even in winter. It is better to put on an extra woollen blanket than to breathe in stale air.<br>  <br>     3. A hard bed will assure the well-being of your spine. If your bed is too soft, you can put a ?” (2cm) sheet of plywood under your mattress.<br>  <br>     4. A big pillow hinders your breathing and tires out your neck. Personally I don’t use a pillow. As a teenager I read that it was better to sleep without a pillow. One night, I tried to do without but that night I felt the need for a pillow by early morning. I tried again the next night and the habit was broken. It would be better for your spinal column to place a pillow under your knees.<br>  <br>     5. To really get the taste of a good night sleep, your sheets and nightwear should be nice and clean. Your room should be clean. It is unhealthy to inhale dust.<br>  <br>     6. Sleeping in a curled up position should be avoided. You must stretch out.<br>  <br>     7. As a rule, eight hours of sleep is sufficient. However, certain organisms only need five hours of sleep per night, while others need ten hours of sleep. During the growth period or adolescence, the body needs more sleep than less. To fully benefit from my course, you should get a sufficient amount of sleep. I recommend you establish a regular routine throughout the day as well as a fixed hour for going to bed.<br>  <br>     8. Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system. Milk can also help you sleep. It contains an amino acid called tryptophane. Which produces the effect of a sedative. To sleep well try to avoid huge meals in the evening as well as stimulants like coffee, tea, cola or chocolate.<br>  <br>     9. Practice total relaxation and breathing fully. Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body by going through each part in your mind. Do complete breathing exercises by following the three phases; (1) Inhale slowly and deeply through the nose; (2) Hold your breath and stretch; (3) Exhale slowly and fully through the mouth while tightening the abdominal muscles.<br>  <br>    10. In conclusion, I would advise: “Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise”. Be in harmony with nature. The more we distance ourselves from nature the more we become unhappy and out of touch with ourselves.

Eventually many people will clear it with their immune system commonly taking up to two years. But not everyone is that lucky.

833a435e36344342d10e69454b7e6731aa	yes, you are if you just want to be healthy (not body builder or anything). you should at most alternate your cardio and strength. so one day, do all the sit ups and push ups, dumbbells, etc. and the next day do your running. if you do weights/strength TOO often, you could actually tear all your muscles in the long run - the discomfort or soreness is from when your muscles tear. they grow back stronger; many people think their muscles are getting stronger while they strength train; but you increase your weights over time because it takes more weight to tear them so that they can grow back.|`|HlD9dRF2aa	You should be sore at first.

Overtraining is when, for example, you can't do 200 situps and 150 pushups one day because your body has had it.  At that point you'll be fighting an uphill battle.

I've just seen the same kind of thing from so many doctors.  <br>  Maybe they think you should be a typical mental patient and many of them suffer obesity because of this?  Many 'stable' mental patients suffer obesity.<br>  Maybe the drug coys have given them too many incentives to use their drugs on the patients?  <br>  I'm not saying any of this is true.

I don't know your doctor, so i don't know what the deal is.  Believe me, i have my own pet  ideas about what they're up to.<br>  Look.<br>  Another not isolated side effect of SSRIs is to make it harder to achieve sexual satisfaction (orgasm).<br>  So, you take an anti depressant that causes weight gain and stops you enjoying intimacy?  And that's supposed to cure you of depression?  The mind boggles at the inconsistencies in mental health treatment.<br>  Hey, i took an SSRI and it messed with my sexual fulfillment.  I was lucky and my doc understood and changed the regime.<br>  <br>  It's really pointless asking why.  <br>  <br>  Maybe you should shop around for a different doctor.  That's all i can suggest.  Get a second opinion.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL.

The flat tummy secrets needed to achieve this goal are all things that can be put into action with very minimal effort. Much of the time my clients are already doing some of these methods but just need to supplement them with the others provided.<br>  <br>  The first flat tummy secret is to cut out all soda pop and salty food.<br>  <br>  The key ingredient here is obviously the sodium, which unfortunately causes out bodies to retain water. The more water you retain the more difficult it will be to get a six pack. Even those at or below 9 % body fat that are holding water find it hard to maintain their abs fully. Replacing your soda with water is a great start as our bodies will filter it much better not to mention the overall nutritional value of water is much better than any soda, diet or not.<br>  <br>  Start implementing exercises that focus on the Core.<br>  <br>  When most people think about getting a great looking flat tummy, they often think about sit-ups and all the most common boring ab exercises that hardly work by themselves. The stronger you build your core the easier you will find it to achieve and maintain your 6 pack. A lot of core exercises I like to recommend are sprints, jogging, and yoga. Yoga is great as it stretches your entire body but does a great job at building your core up giving your body great overall strength.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://online--weight--loss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://online--weight--loss.blogspot.com...</a>|`|ovPfkHSCaa	If you accept that what you eat has a major impact on the results you get from your muscle building plan, then the question becomes, "What are the best muscle building foods for me to eat?"

Good luck|`|e1c944603c4ce300a6c38750cfe9fea7aa	If you can, try changing the time of day you do your workout.  I'm guessing that the reason you feel tired is because of the circadian rhythm.  People generally feel sleepy at around 2:00 pm, and doing your workout just before that time can make you feel tired afterwards.  <br>  <br>  How much food have you had before your workout?  Did you have a good breakfast?  Your body needs fuel to do all those exercises.  Try a light snack before you start your workout.<br>  <br>  Consult with a personal trainer, even just one session, who could check if you have the proper form and breathing.  If you have not been using correct form, over time you might damage your joints.  And don't forget to stretch after your workout.<br>  <br>  Finally, talk to your doctor about your problem.  Maybe it's not related at all to your workout.

f1c17db8c15988032e511490d1a2bac5aa	Ok, the first thing you need to realize, is that the frustration will probably get worse before anything thing is resolved, so take a deep breath and prepare yourself for battle, because that's exactly what it is going to feel like. Secondly, remember that health insurance agencies are out to hold on to the money they already have and make more off of their policy holders...period. Don't take their crap personally or let it upset you. With that said, I've gone a few rounds with them myself, and though I can't give you all of the right answers, I can give you some tips and advice. Though this might sound stupid, get a current physical on record. Arthritis is either chronic or acute, and even though yours resulted from a car accident (which could lead to chronic), you had the hip replacement and you no longer have it, correct? You need proof of that, which is why you need the physical. When an insurance company hears "arthritis," they think "chronic" and that means long-term maintenance and payment for treatment. You need to prove that you currently have no condition. Another big catch with insurance is the ever-so-popular "preexisting condition" clause. So again, you're going to have to prove in documentation that the Arthritis is gone, was a one time deal, and that there is nothing lingering over from any previous time. This is going to most-likely require 5 years worth of medical records, as well as current documentation. Finally, contact the insurance company you want to enroll with over the phone, explain everything (you may have to do this more than once). MAKE SURE you also mention (again more than once) that you have in writing proof that you have no conditions that would disqualify you from the insurance. It never hurts to have your PCP sit in an office while you're on the phone with the insurance company :). Other tips: have access to a fax machine, it makes the whole document transfer process a lot easier; Have multiple copies of all documents (including your medical records); Don't request that your copies be mailed to you, it'll take weeks, call ahead and pick them up in person; Lastly, don't hesitate to firmly (but nicely) inform the insurance agency (if they continue to deny you) that you are disappointed that they are denying you for no reason, and you will gladly take your business elsewhere. Remember, it is a business, and most will not like hearing those words. Sorry this is so long, but these are things that have helped me over the years. Hope it helps you as well.|`|ci0FcFpyaa	healthplans.bebto.com - here is my health insurance plan.

You will be on the table, with your feet up in the stirrups, just like for a pap. The doctor will insert and open the speculum to see the cervix. He/she will then use a liquid nitrogen vapor on your cervix. It has to be on it for 6 minutes, so they may do it in intervals of 3 minutes each, or whatever you can handle. It does cause some moderate cramping, and it is best to be distracted when the dr is doing this, to help take your mind off it. <br>  <br>  When it is over with, you can have cramping, which can be relieved with over the counter pain meds. Also, when your cervix thaws out, you will have a discharge for a couple of days. <br>  <br>  If the freezing does what it is supposed to do, which is remove the top layers of the cervix, you will not have to have any surgery, just follow up paps at whatever interval your dr prescribes, usually every 3 months for the first year after.

The good news is that you don’t suffer pain so even though they may take some time to heal at least you won’t be suffering. <br>  <br>  You can have sex, however if you feel any aggravation of your hemorrhoid or notice that its getting worse I would stop and wait until your condition has improved. <br>  <br>  I suggest that if you are comfortable talking to your boyfriend about this you do mention that you have hemorrhoids to your him as he will understand and is less likely to be shocked if he does happen to see your hemorrhoid during sex.<br>  <br>  I’ve included a couple of links to sites full of information about hemorrhoids below…<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  <br>  Heather Jane|`|658c97c2e40e2eb3b804b250ef53cb21aa	Get medical consult from colo-rectal surgeon.<br>  <br>  Indications for surgery:<br>  1.

An obstructive disease obstructed the air form getting out of the lungs.   If you see someone with advanced COPD you will notice a barreled chest or pushed out chest.  This is from all the air built up in the lungs they cant get out. <br>  <br>  Trapped air is known as residual volume (RV).  increased residual volume is considered trapped air.   <br>  <br>  Is your mom a smoker?|`|gktVbcEnaa	That doctor is an epic fail.|`|b2VOXD3vaa	Aren't you meant to have air in your lungs??

Two people that are the same height can weigh the same and one be fat and the other be in great shape. Depending if they work out with weights, do cardio and eat right.

Done properly and consistently, they should add close to an inch or two to your penis in six weeks.<br>  <br>  1. Penis stretches. This one is very simple. Just take your flaccid penis and stretch it as far out in front of your body as it will go. Do it gently and gradually and hold it there for thirty seconds. Rest ten seconds between sets and repeat this at least ten times.<br>  <br>  2. Jelqing. This is another great technique for rookies. Get your penis halfway erect, apply lubrication, and grip it tightly at the base with the thumb and forefinger of one hand. Slowly slide that hand up the shaft toward the tip, pushing as much blood into your penis as possible. When you reach the tip, immediately grip the base the same way using the other hand and repeat. Do this nonstop for ten minutes.<br>  <br>  3. Ulis. This is a great exercise to increase girth. It is also very easy and does not take much time. Achieve a full erection and grip the base of your penis the same way you would if you were jelqing. <br>  <br>  Squeeze as hard as you can without causing discomfort. Your penis shaft should swell and your penis head should get big and shiny. Hold for ten seconds and rest for ten seconds. Repeat this three or four times.<br>  <br>  Do this routine every other day and make sure you warm your penis up before each workout by wrapping it in a hot washcloth for five minutes.<br>  <br>  4. A larger penis can be achieved with the use of penis enhancers. There are many forms of penis enhancement products such as pills, patches and topical oils. However, one unique natural product that can produce significant results and makes use of the body's natural abilities comes in the form of a liquid called super-vir <a href="http://www.super-vir.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-vir.com</a><br>  <br>  Always remember, if you are not satisfied with what you were born with, it is never too late to do something about it!|`|osY0xlhTaa	Despite being called penis 'enlargement' pills, they do not actually enlarge your penis. The pills work by increasing blood flow to the penis, so (good ones) probably have the effect of giving you stronger erections, but they will not give you any extra size. Do not waste your money.<br>  <br>  Apart from surgery (which is dangerous & very expensive), the only penis enlargement method which works is exercises.<br>  <br>  Because they increase the amount of blood that the penis can physically hold, you can gain extra inches length and width if you do them properly.<br>  <br>  You can get more details about all the different methods at <a href="http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com</a>|`|ShVxmkO8aa	None of the pills work...only exercises and surgery work<br>  <br>  I've gained about an inch in length from the exercises in this guide: <a href="http://www.mistermanpower.net/guide_to_penis_enlargement.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mistermanpower.net/guide_to_p...</a>|`|JCuv283caa	i 100% agree wit Wilbur..<br>  If you want something easy to do, check this one...
SkDomhoXaa	wow very harsh words...... as much as you think you hate her think carefully about what your wishing!<br>  <br>  do you not think she needs help - see could be depressed with the divorce and being financially unstable, could that not be a reason why your life was a living nightmare when you were there, maybe she and you never got over your mothers death. also she was probably worried about your father just as you were but she has all that other worry hanging over her too. i think you should cut her some slack talk to her and find out whats really wrong, you never know you might find you actually like/love her rather than hate her when you understand whats going on.<br>  <br>  edit;- how do you know she doesnt care? she could be so bogged down with her problems and not know what way is up, maybe she needs a helping hand. surly your father would know something was wrong the min he she's her and she doesnt want him to know?|`|QnJvJ67uaa	It sounds to me that your family have been through some tough times..your mother only died 4 years ago and now your dads in the hospital and to top it all your sister is struggling with money and keeping a roof over her and her kids heads.<br>  Now put you in this situation. If you feel so strongly that you want to kill her I'm guessing your behaving pretty crappy towards her...SO not only is she dealing with all this but she has to look after you and you are not helping one bit.<br>  She probably talked to your uncle because she feels unable to cope with your attitude and moods.<br>  Maybe she hasn't;t visited her dad because she is too busy running round after all of you.<br>  I feel for you, of course YOU are feeling pain ..BUT so is your sister...if you feel this strongly I would imagine your sister does as well.<br>  Take a deep breath, step back.<br>  Why not help her out, force a smile, make a meal, clean the house ANYTHING to break the circle of hate between you.<br>  Don't do or say anything now that you will regret in a few years time. <br>  Yes she may be acting like a b**i**t**c**h but I bet you aren't acting like a Paragon of virtue either.<br>  Good luck..you can do this, be an adult :) xx|`|dXAgTUSraa	well It seems like you are having a very difficult time, if it is real bad maybe you could go and talk to a counselor or a preacher.

At your age it would be difficult to live separated but if you could work there should be some hope of becoming independent of this situation.

My sister and I used to talk that way to each other when we were teenagers but now that we are older she is my best friend and I wouldn't trade her for anything in the world. <br>  You and your sister may never be that close, but you can't kill her. It sounds like counseling would help her but she may get offended and mad if you suggest it. Is there another family member who could talk to her? The two of you could even go together and work out some issues. She is your sister after all, it's worth a try|`|rTaaIXSuaa	There is an old saying that goes:<br>  "Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it."<br>  And it wasn't meaning in a good way.<br>  I am not siding with her and I am not siding with you. I will just give a little insight on her behavior since I am a mom too. <br>  Your guy's mother passed. Dad had a stroke. Your sister is having financial difficulties. HMM. I wouldn't expect anyone to act happy go lucky. She has a lot on her plate right now and no, her behavior isn't acceptable, yet you HAVE to understand. She sounds like she needs some help. Counseling will really come in handy for her right now. Have you tried talking to her? A little comfort from her brother/sister will work wonders. Tell her how you feel! You have a right to. Let her know that her kids are being treated unfairly as well. Sometimes mothers will take it out on the innocent and won't realize it unless someone intervenes. Trust me. I have been in her shoes and had a reality check when my oldest son spoke up for the family. That was all it took. Try it.<br>  Don't hold any resentment against your sister. It will damage YOU more than it will her. What you are saying is a horrible. I would never wish death on any family member no matter how they are or were. Can you live with yourself if she did die at this moment? I don't think so. Communicate with your sister. It will benefit the BOTH of you.|`|4LGHsNVdaa	i dont know what to tell you.<br>  but i can tell you i know exactly how you feel.<br>  everybody in my family i have talked to says i will grow out of it.. one day we will be best friends.  but i dont want that.  shes done too much damage for me to ever want to be in her life.<br>  my only advice- wait it out.  avoid her at all costs.  and when its time, go away to college.|`|bInF0Rhqaa	You say you're not a mean person, but a nice person would not say those things about someone else, no matter how upset they are.  There are better ways to express your anger.  You can't control anything in this world except what you do.  You can't make her stop the behavior that has you so upset.  But you can find ways to make your own life better.  You don't have to kill her, or say you want to, or anything.  You don't speak the way you do because of her.  You know better and still do it.  Please take some responsibility in the situation, because if you don't it will never improve.  Be nice to your sister.  Maybe she is the way she is because she's upset about something.  Maybe she doesn't visit your Dad because she is upset about the stroke, or too overwhelmed with problems in her own life.  There's always another side to the story.|`|uXjbN3Ceaa	Idk...

You have many DVD's in a set and you mix them up. the be livers club gives you workout calenders for free so you know which videos to use which days. Mixing up your routine really helps your body to not adapt too easily and stall on weight loss. Also make sure you are eating enough and eat Breakfast! I can not stress that enough. Cut out all the junk food except maybe treat yourself once a week so you are not depriving yourself but cut it out the rest of the week. Have some natural peanut  butter on a celery stick for a snack or something. not a candybar or cookie. Eating breakfast will help you lose weight and eating enough for the amount of exercise is important otherwise your body will not lose but hold onto everything you eat if you are not eating enough. Seems strange but it is so true.

The gyn will send you to a colposcopy clinic for good measure to make sure you don't have cervical cancer. But really, most of the time it's just an infection.|`|Z2YgGifCaa	I had a Colopscopy several years ago and it can be somewhat painful so ask you doctor if it is OK to take some OTC meds prior to the procedure to help with the pain.<br>  <br>  When I had mine done, they put me on a table, much like they do when they perform a PAP. Then the took a small biopsy I believe, which gives a severe pinching sensation that lasts for what felt like minutes, but was really only seconds.<br>  <br>  So while it does sound scary, its really not that bad if you know in advance to expect some pain with the procedure. I would also suggest, aside from the OTC pain medication, having someone go in with you to hold your hand, which is what I did because it can be somewhat unpleasant.<br>  <br>  But again, its not as bad as it sounds even though it is far from fun.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and GOOD LUCK!
