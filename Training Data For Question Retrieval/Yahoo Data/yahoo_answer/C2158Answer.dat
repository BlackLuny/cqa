tqAEoOAdaa	To STOP receiving unwanted (Spam/Bulk/Junk) email, do the following:    Log into your Email, go to Options (upper right hand side). Go through all your settings and don't forget to save them too. (http://spam-blocking.cn/top-7-ways-to-st...  )    Under Spam Protection, make sure your Spam Guard is turned ON. Option to immediately delete all Spam messages. This will force all new email to redirect to your Inbox. Option to Block messages that you mark as Spam. If you plan on keeping your   Bulk folder, also option messages you mark as Not-Spam to be moved to your Inbox. Always Option to Block all Images until you can look them over first. This prevents spammers from knowing you opened their email. Save Changes.     http://www.howtogetridofstuff.com/comput...    Under Blocked Addresses, type in spammer.com, this will stop all Spam that has been reported to Yahoo from ever entering your email. I recommend you remove everything on your list first. This will give you a fresh start after you type in the "spammer.com".     Under General Preferences, Folders/Search Results, Special Folders, option to redirect incoming unsolicited email to the Bulk Folder. Save.     http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/ya...    If you get email from someone you don't know, NEVER open it (it may contain viruses) and report it as SPAM. This will automatically block it from your email account. When you do open an email that is Spam, you have alerted the sender that your account is Active. (http://help.yahoo.com/us/tutorials/mail/...  )    This will immediately stop all the Junk Mail considerably. I only get maybe one or two Spam emails a Month. Remember, anytime you give out your email address over the Internet, you can expect to receive some kind of Spam, unless you have made sure that site is secured.

Both options require a new 2-year service agreement. In the future, AT&T will offer a no-contract-required option for $599 (8GB) or $699 (16GB).     Current customers may also choose to wait until they become eligible for an upgrade discount. Eligibility is generally determined by amount of time remaining on a current contract and payment history.

(Although sometimes I just really want to say something so I give in and I do, even though I know I won't get Best Answer... but this is rare)    I care because I want people to know that I actually care about giving a quality answer.  What would the point of Yahoo Answers be, if everyone just went around giving crappy answers to everything just to get 2 points, and nobody actually tried to answer the question?      I take pride in my relatively high percentage of Best Answers (versus overall answers).  More so than I take pride in the number of points I have, or the level I'm at.  I know it's 10 points if you get the best answer, but I'm not so concerned with that as I am with raising my Best Answer percentage, and knowing that I've helped someone.

You could always form a study group if you are wanting to bounce ideas and solutions off each other.    It's one thing to come on and ask for names of reputable sites or clarification on how two points differ, and quite another to simply cut and paste your homework in a question.

6qsTmMQaaa	To pick a best answer yourself, you have to wait four hours before the bubbles appear. The bubbles read, "Choose as Best Answer," and they appear under each answer. You click the bubble beneath the answer you like best, and then it will take you to a page, where you need to rate the response, and then leave a message to the asker. Then, you scroll down a little and click SUBMIT. The answerer will receive ten points, and you will receive three.    To put your question to vote, you can either wait for the time to expire and then vote for the best answer, or you can go to the pencil beneath your question. If you click on the pencil, three or four tabs (depending on whether you extended the expiration date or not) will pop down, and one of them will read "PUT THIS QUESTION TO VOTE." Then the question will be put to vote, and you and the Yahoo! Answers community will vote for the best answer. You will still receive three points when the question is resolved.|`|ij9N9r5waa	actually you have to wait until another blue bar appears above the tree boxes on each of the answers that says "Choose as best answer" then you just click the one you like.  or you can leave it up to a community vote, I'm not real sure how that one works......Next someone explain community vote.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	You have to wait til the bar that usually says Answer this question turns blue.

7u77AiBjaa	It's not clear whether you mean a Yahoo! 360 image or a Yahoo! Avatar (cartoon image). See below for instructions for both.    YAHOO! AVATAR:  Go to http://avatars.yahoo.com and sign in (if you're not already). You can make an avatar image there. If you need help with making the avatar, follow instructions at http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/avatars... . Your avatar is currently a grayed out man/woman because it's the default image. Make sure that you click the orange "Save Changes" button below your Avatar preview window before leaving the site!    Then, click "My Profile" to the upper right of most Yahoo! Answers pages, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page. Choose your avatar in the pic section. Click Preview and then the OK button.      YAHOO! 360 IMAGE:  Create a 360 space at http://360.yahoo.com . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.    Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.    - Click your "My Page" link at the top  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).    You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui... .    Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.    NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (http://avatars.yahoo.com ) and forget about using the 360 image.    OTHER TIPS:   *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though.   *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe... . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.

The intention of the person "attacking" is solely to harass, nothing more, nothing less.  Such a person obviously doesn't like you for what you have to say, and they are not disposed to changing their minds no matter what.    Nothing constructive can come from allowing them to "harass" you, so it's best to block ONLY those who harass you first.    NOTE: I'm speaking strictly from the perspective of someone who is here to simply answer questions, not ask them.|`|RMMdGYCDaa	Make your info private for sure!  Otherwise the attacker (s) can look at all your Q's & A's and report them. But be certain to block anyone who might be an attacker as well.  Also review your contacts and be sure you know who they are.  If any are questionable, remove them and block them.  Take it from a guy who has had countless accounts deleted.|`|VzIWDuRzaa	Block, God Bless|`|ljzb6fZBaa	Trust the Lord to be your defence. :) "The name of the Lord is like a strong tower; the righteous runs to it and are safe."

8fb24b6f111df0e972bbf73b72eb81d3aa	Hey Goodlooking,    I think the trick is to find someone who does that - I think the craft style is called "poker work". It's burning patterns into wood using something that looks VERY much like a soldering iron.    I know most Queensland historical villages will have someone selling their artwork at their open days or other special occasions. Guess it'd be the same down your way. Most would be willing to do a custom piece - as long as you're not unlucky enough to find a Fundy.    If you find a picture/elements of pictures you're interested in just as a guideline/inspiration you ought to be OK.    .|`|zcJ0I0ovaa	don't buy one or take as a gift.  they will invite the devil into your life  NO kidding....stay away|`|gFqeMs22aa	this one seems to be in the uk    http://www.ouijamagic.co.uk/products.php...    i'm thinkning of making one for myself. now that u've mentioned it.    edit    sorry mate, i thought that if you were buying on e-bay it could be world wide.    i'd contact someone like    http://www.pyroz.com.au/menu.html    and they'll be either able to make it for you or refer you to someone who'll do it.|`|hTgnvLOSaa	Just make one yourself.

6qsTmMQaaa	You have to activate your 360 profile. To do that, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click on the button that says "My 360 profile" in blue letters. It is to the right of your ID. Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient. Hope this helped!

79800e8aa542061232982947981d2dffaa	My first answer is if it's only to one person, you can surely email them as an attachment and send them to it that way.    Also, you can upload it to something like Skydrive, which is a free sort of online hard drive system that's free with a Windows Live account (which is also free).    http://skydrive.live.com    I think you might be referring to is something like megaupload, which you upload your stuff and send a link, to which the receiving person follows to download the file. It's free, but bugs you a lot to subscribe to premium service. Just a small nuisance.    http://www.megaupload.com/
yj3GT7jOaa	By the time your question gets posted 19 more are behind it.  People only have a tendency to answer the questions that show immediately and not go back through the page your question appears on. Some categories have more viewers that others and will get more answers.|`|4jOaN0WIaa	It depends on the question and category. Some categories aren't as popular as other categories.|`|2eEFc1KZaa	Hi i don't really know why that is but what questions are you asking!|`|briRpzL1aa	Typically you will find it is because of the way you structured your subject heading.  Meaning, the better you structure your subject, the more people that will read it and respond.    Good Luck and I Hope this Helps..|`|uauJyxJNaa	If your question is too specific or too complex, I have found it get's less responses.  I think there are a lot of either totally stupid people on here who don't know a heck of a lot, or they are just too lazy to type an involved answer.    That's just what I think.  And don't feel bad....I frequently get no responses or one reponse only.  Seems there are a lot of not-so-bright young people on this board these days.

JhvqUvlsaa	Are you meaning you want it to go back to the gray silhouette? I'm sorry but I'm having a hard time with this question. But I will do my best to help you.    To change your Avatar to whatever you want, go to your profile page and click Edit My Info. At the top you'll see three choices for your picture;   1)No Picture  2) Use my Yahoo 360 Picture  3) Use my Yahoo Avatar.    If none of those are what you want, click the link under Use my Yahoo Avatar and it will take you to the avatars page. It will show you a picture of the avatar you have now and below it are some settings for zoom, etc. It also shows the history of the clothes and backgrounds you've had on your avatar.    Make the changes you want to make, then click Save Changes on the left. Exit the page, and come back to your profile. Click Preview then OK at the bottom    I hope this answers your question.    RW

I've never been to a psychiatrist, but would think they'd have a mental checklist they'd question you with to get to the root of the problem.

For example, if I registered the ID "jojo" but wanted to change it to "jojo2009", I would log into my "jojo" account and create an "extra" email address under the name "jojo2009".  I could send and receive under the name "jojo2009" in place of the name "jojo", and I would continue to use the mailbox which I originally created when I registered "jojo".    http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/cl...

The last set of delays lasted about 4 days.<br>  <br>  OFTEN it takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up to changes made through Yahoo! 360. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon), words/red "x" in box will show, or an old 360 image will appear. Just choose the 360 image option in your Yahoo! Answers profile and let your picture stay that way until the Y/A system makes the adjustment to the correct image.<br>  <br>  After a few days of waiting, you can certainly contact Y/A staff by posting a BUG report on the Y/A forum at <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . I recommend putting BUG: to start the title of your message. Also, you can do a search on the forum and add a comment to messages other people have posted about the problem. This problem can only be resolved system-wide (temporarily or permanently) by Yahoo staff.

The mail is picked up by a truck and taken to the Post Office in the City you are mailing to.  The Postal Service then delivers it to the address you entered on the front of the envelope.  Be sure you include the zip code.  That's the most important part of the address.

AA11307940	The mail carrier probably thought it was mail delivered to you and you never took it out. They will try to get away with the easiest way possible and still get the same amount of pay. Take them yourself to the post office and complain, it doesn't matter about what date you put on them, what it does it makes it look even worse for the carrier not picking them up.|`|avykSnJMaa	The date should be fine. But you need to go to usps.com and  order a pick up it's free set the date you need them to be picked up and select where you need them picked up from witch would be you're mail box.

All the way to the right, there should be a box that says "Use my Yahoo! Avatar", and then right beneath a button that says "Edit My Yahoo! Avatar".     4. Click it.    5. It will take you to the link.    OR...    Just type in avatars.yahoo.com in the search bar at the top of your webpage. Make sure you're logged on. =)    PICTURE AVATAR:    You have to activate your 360 profile. To do that, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click on the button that says "My 360 profile" in blue letters. It is to the right of your ID. Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient. Hope this helped! Good luck!|`|166372a5d474ce786ecc08a423df8b11aa	try editing your profile

You have to clear out all your cookies, either by doing it from the Tools option or menu from your browser or by using something like CCleaner.

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Sent emails from Yahoo Answers never show up in your outbox. No copies are made of sent emails. It works -- I get about 6-8 emails per day, on average.<br>  <br>  The emails come FROM Yahoo Answers (not from the people). They say: You have received a message from another user. When you OPEN that email, the message is inside and there is a link under the message to reply. You don't use the normal 'reply' button.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, these go to the SPAM folder, for one reason or another. So, that is the first place to check. Next, I allow email -- and I have a special folder for them, so email me and I'll let you know if I get it. I will also email you  right now to test yours -- and also reply to what you send me, if I get it.|`|suPD7c3gaa	Yes, it works quite well.  I don't allow at the moment, but was up until this morning and it's been sending and receiving just fine.  How do you know people aren't receiving or that you're not receiving? There's no reason to think people aren't receiving.  It's possible they just haven't replied, or there wasn't a reason to reply.<br>  <br>  No emails you send get save in your Out box or Sent folder when emailing through Yahoo! Answers.  The reason Y!A is able to keep ALL email addresses anonymous at all times is because the emails you send go to Yahoo first, who in turn sends your message to the intended recipient.  As you may have noticed, when you go to someones Y!A profile and click to send them an email, a message window pops up... it doesn't go to your regular email compose view.  And when you reply to an email you've received through Yahoo! Answers, you click the "Reply to this message" link, NOT the "Reply" button like you normally would when replying to other emails.

d645e3c1f0da82127be8455d37dddb8faa	Record sound    Using Sound Recorder, you can record sound as a digital media file on your computer from a variety of devices, such as a microphone that is plugged in to your sound card. The types of audio input sources you can record from depend on the audio devices you have, as well as on the input sources that are available on the sound card that is installed on your computer.    Make sure you have an audio input device, such as a microphone, connected to your computer.    Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, and then click Sound Recorder.    Click Start Recording.    To stop recording audio, click Stop Recording.    Do one of the following:    If you want to continue recording audio, click Resume, and then continue to record sound.    If you want to save the recorded sound as an audio file, click the File name box, type a file name for the recorded sound, and then click Save.    Notes  To use Sound Recorder, you must have a sound card and speakers installed on your computer. If you want to record sound, you also need a microphone.    By default, the recorded audio is saved as a Windows Media Audio (WMA) file.    If you are using Windows Vista Home Basic N or Windows Vista Business N, your Sound Recorder files are saved as .wav files rather than .wma files.    You can play your recording in a digital media player program that supports playback of WMA files.    See also  What are the file types for a recorded audio file?

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	There are 2 things that may affect this. One is if when you signed up for your email account, you did not set your time-zone correctly. You can usually go to your account details and change that. On Yahoo, you go to your account by clicking on your 'UserID' where it says: Hi or Welcome, 'UserID'. <br>  <br>  The other issue may be that the time being posted is the SERVER time, not the time you are receiving the email. For example, Yahoo servers are in California, so they work on Pacific time. If your time is different than Pacific time, that may be the discrepancy.

7u77AiBjaa	You have one Yahoo account that is used to access various SERVICES like Yahoo! 360. <br>  <br>  If you don't want to completely lose your Yahoo ID by closing your account, then I suggest removing all content and information that you added to Yahoo! 360. Make all your settings (basic info, blog, communication, and every module on your "My Page") set to "Friends" or "Just Me (Private)". If you really want to remove the blogs, you would have to click the "Delete" link for each one. The "Just Me (Private)" setting is preferred, but if you don't have that option choose "Friends." Delete all your friends (see <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/friends/friends-05.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/fri...</a> ). Remove content from automatically public areas like the Personal Profile Picture module and Top Page comments. Change the background back to the default version - either called the "custom" or "classic" theme. Then, that's it.

The reason is you owe YG something for providing you with a platform and free Group software. There is no free lunch - if advertisers cannot make money, YG will close all Groups down.

Thus, you would have to add additional detail by clicking the pencil right beneath your question that says "Edit" next to it. Then, click "Add Additional Detail," and you'll be able to add a response to their question.

Yahoo! 360 beta is one of those services.    When you start a Yahoo account, you get a Yahoo Profile (http://profiles.yahoo.com ) associated with that primary Yahoo ID. You can customize your profile so that people know something about you, but there are limits to what you can do with it (so far).    Yet you can choose to activate the Yahoo! 360 beta service on your account to have a more extensive profile. This profile also allows you to display an image on Y/A if you like. You can read more about Yahoo! 360 in this old press release: http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release122... . You can see a sample 360 page here: http://360.yahoo.com/reg/sample.html . Similar to the updated Y!Profile, Y!360 is involved with social networking. You can use the service to connect with other 360 spaces and meet new people.  It's also similar to MySpace and Facebook in that regard. 360 combines some Yahoo services (note: not very successfully) into one area.    If you want to activate 360, go to http://360.yahoo.com and click on the "Get Started" button to go through the process. Then, click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page or the 360 main page to enter the space.    Keep in mind that 360 is a beta service, so there are many bugs. If you have problems, check the Answers area or click on my Yahoo! Avatar to see the Starred Questions section in my Y/A profile.     OTHER RESOURCES:  - 360 COMMUNITY GUIDELINES at http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...   - HELP Pages: http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/  - The 360 team blog at http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360 has many helpful links on the right side to help with setting up a 360 space and using other services with it. You can also check out information about 360's transition to a universal profile system (i.e. the Y!Profile) scheduled to begin in the 2nd half of 2008.  - For IDEAS you can check out other 360 pages by clicking on your "Search" link at the top of 360 or by going to http://360.yahoo.com/search.html  - For MORE TIPS regarding 360, click on my avatar and scroll down to click on the "Starred Questions" tab. Also, my 360 space blog (http://blog.360.yahoo.com/kee_y360 ) has tips in the tag cloud on the left  "360tips" "music" " "vids"  and on the right under highlighted posts.  - See http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... for information on 360 glitches. It will save you some time and frustration to learn what features do and don't work on 360.    NOTE: Some features are not available to users under age 18 for safety reasons.

zDQIPFH2aa	There are several reason questions are removed:    1. It is a violation of the rules - you will get an e-mail when that happens.  If you get one, post it here in a question and the users can tell you the problem.  There is no statute of limitations on breaking the YA rules.    2. There were zero answers when the time expired - no e-mail sent.    3. The BA was reported as a violation - no e-mail sent.    4. During voting, "No Best Answer" was chosen as the best answer - no e-mail sent.    Look in your e-mail, including the spam folder, for a violation e-mail. If not there, check your activity tab in your profile. If nothing about a violation there, then the Q was removed for one of the other reasons.|`|m4G9jqgPaa	It would seem that someone was offended, and reported it.

You can vote for undecided questions at Level 1, even your own, but you need to be on Level 2 to rate answers (thumb up /down).    The best way to gain points is to answer and vote to your limit each day, whatever level you are on.    Visit each day - 1 point  Answer to your limit each day - 2 points each answer - 20 questions - 40 points  Hope for some best answers - 10 points each best answer plus 1 point for every thumbs up (maximum 50 points)  Vote to your limit each day - 1 point each vote - 20 votes - 20 points  If you ask a question, -5 points, pick a best answer, you get 3 points back.|`|AA12390047	Keep answering as many questions as you can each day.|`|38J8nzhBaa	points...  look at your profile.

You have 173 points so you need another 77 points to get to level 2.  Here are some ways that you can earn or lose them.    Ask a question: -5 points  Choose best answer for your question: +3 points  No best answer was selected by voters on your question: 5 points returned  Answer a question: +2 points  Delete a question: -2 points  Log in to Yahoo! Answers: +1 point (receive only once daily)  Vote for a best answer: +1 point  Have your answer selected as the best answer: +10 points  Receive a "thumbs up" rating on an answer that you wrote: 1 point per "thumbs up"     Hope this helps!!! =D|`|F0h2iFWsaa	level 2 starts at 250 points - you have 174.    All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.    Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.    Hints:     answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)  you also get a point a day for signing in    each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly    :o)

If a "best answer" has been chosen or it's "in voting" then only Yahoo can delete them. To delete an answer before the question is in voting or resolved, people just click the "delete" word that appears in small type right under their answer.    To delete a question, you click on the toolbar below the question on the pencil icon. However, you lost 5 pts. when you asked the question and you don't get the 5 pts. back.    You delete on answers by clicking back on the question that you answered, scrolling down to your answer and clicking the delete link that shows under your answer with other options such as Edit.    However, if you choose a "best answer" then you get 3 pts. back. And, sorry, I don't know a way to clean up your Q&A. You can add information, such as explaining what you meant if you had typos by adding a comment to a resolved question, but you can't delete. To add information, again, you click on the pencil icon (if it's not resolved) or click on the word comments under the answer if it's resolved.    ONCE A QUESTION IS IN VOTING OR RESOLVED, only Yahoo can delete the question or answers and, generally, they only delete something for a violation of the rules. You're stuck with it in your profile. Unfortunately, Yahoo doesn't warn you about that (or that anyone can come read what you've said) when you sign up.    It's possible to make your profile private by going to your profile, clicking Edit My Info then selecting the option that says nobody can see your questions and answers but, unfortunately, your contacts and fans can STILL see your profile that way.

If they want to use Yahoo, they have to sign in to their own accounts.  They will NOT, and should NEVER, see your email headers or subject lines.  There is nothing you need to remove.  There is no reason why they can't log onto their own accounts.  If they don't have accounts, then they can create their own accounts... and from your computer if they wish.  They just have to log off of their accounts so you can log into yours.  If they forget, you don't need their password or even user ID... just log them off yourself.

Visit each day - 1 point  Answer to your limit each day - 2 points each answer - 20 questions - 40 points  Hope for some best answers - 10 points each best answer plus 1 point for every thumbs up (maximum 50 points)  Vote to your limit each day - 1 point each vote - 20 votes - 20 points  If you ask a question, -5 points, pick a best answer, you get 3 points back.|`|F0h2iFWsaa	level 2 starts at 250 points - you have 299.  Your next goal is 1,000 points and Level 3.    All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.    Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.    Hints:     answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)  you also get a point a day for signing in    each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly    :o)     http://answers.yahoo.co m/info/scoring_system;_ylt=Aplad92Pq_Flp...|`|6qsTmMQaaa	250 points are required for level two|`|d7OswsvMaa	250..i guess.|`|ixzVKzBjaa	According to the score chart...

RP6dDFTsaa	there is always good ppl and bad ppl, but now it seems like the bad is over taking the good. one good thing to remember is ppl who throw stones at others sometimes get them tossed back at them also, so don't lower yourself to these ppl. They are the haters in the world and they always get whats coming to them.  Peace|`|d7OswsvMaa	lol..just tryin to be funny..i guess..|`|IP8vzLuBaa	For some odd reason, some people just like to be jerks.  I think they probably want to tell people to their faces what they think but can't, so this is there way of getting away with being rude.  Just ignore them!|`|jR8mclWIaa	They are twelve years old.|`|XZTf8Eahaa	Well poeple do it for fun and because they can but most of the users on yahoo are here to help each other out. Theres always a few bad apples   every where but in time we will pick them out.Don,t let them get to you,  thats what they wanted to do when you get a answer like that just report  it you can report any answer you feel was rude and once you report them forget it and move on. That way they don,t win.
7u77AiBjaa	UPDATE: I didn't see an image for you when I first answered this question either.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  There's no link to your 360 space in your question or Yahoo! Answers profile, so I can't confirm that you have a 360 space. Double-check that you are using the correct Yahoo services and have followed all the instructions below. Some people confuse the Y!Profile (<a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com">http://profiles.yahoo.com</a> ) with Yahoo! 360 (<a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> ). If you've done everything, then likely you just have to wait for a change to be recognized:<br>  <br>  <br>  Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click the "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. It doesn't matter if the image is showing there or not. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	i am not sure do they have a help Centre
