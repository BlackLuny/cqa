vAdtlZDpaa	I think this dream shows that you are having insecurities about your relationship with your boyfriend, which you may not be expressing or aware of in your waking life. And the fact that you cannot communicate with him on the phone in your dream may symbolize feeling like the communication is lacking in your waking relationship.
YzoLa5Uuaa	Malcom Gladwell's books ("Blink", "Outliers", and "Tipping Point") are fun reads that relate to psychology. They are more "popular" psychology but have good information none-the-less.<br>  <br>  Oliver Sack's books are great psychology-neuroscience type reads my favorite being "The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat" (clinical stories)<br>  <br>  I geek out reading books about human memory books (Daniel Schacter's "Searching for Memory: The Brain, the Mind, and the Past", Richard McNally's "Remembering Trauma").<br>  <br>  A more applied memory approach that talks about expert witnesses in memory is Elizabeth Loftus' book " Witness for the Defense: The Accused, the Eyewitness and the Expert Who Puts Memory on Trial." <br>  <br>  Some social and emotional psychology type books: Dan Gilbert's "Stumbling Upon Happiness", Daniel Goleman's "Social Intelligence", Jonathon Haidt's "Happiness Hypothesis", et cetera. <br>  <br>  I dislike Freud with a passion (not to mention fraught with pseudoscience), Skinner was a boring old behaviorist (dedicated and powerful but boring none-the-less), and Jung also had a lot of pseudoscience ideas. I prefer to read more recent works to keep up to date. <br>  <br>  There is a bunch of suggestions, possible too many suggestions. Find a topic that interests you and dive in!

8d8ejHPfaa	Well, it kind of depends on if you were backing McCain or Obama in the last election, and what you think of Obama now that he is in office.  If you were for McCain, it could be some wishful thinking going on there, but if you think well of our president, well, it could be that you are exploring some thoughts about things that you've seen in the news, things he's tried to do, ideas he's working on.  Even though he's the president, he doesn't have unlimited power to do whatever he wants to do when he wants to do it, our nation has checks and balances.  Even though he has promised change, and is working hard to change things, there may be resistance to some of his ideas, and there are some hard feelings on the part of some Republicans, who might do what they can to keep his hands tied.  The phrase "arrested development" comes to mind, there are plans he wants to bring to fruition, but his efforts are hindered.  This is a good thing in it's own way, it keeps any one man from being elected and just running amok, but it also slows down change at a time when a whole country is anxious to see some plans put into effect in a hurry.  One of the definitions of arrested is inactive, interrupted, brought to a halt.  You may have concerns as to whether he is really going to be effective in his job, or whether Congress will back him wholeheartedly.  The imagery of him being in jail offers an impression of confinement from without, suspension for a time.  Some of his plans have had to be put aside for awhile, in order to attend to more pressing needs, you could be viewing some things of that sort as well.|`|kOlZqhSdaa	That he was born in Kenya and that everything he is doing right now is not legally binding.|`|vAdtlZDpaa	People who appear in our dream represent different aspects of our own personality. Consider what President Obama signifies to you, or what characteristics you may share with him.<br>  <br>  To dream of being arrested indicates issues of control and restraint. Some aspect of your Self may have been prevented from fully developing. Alternatively, it could suggest feelings of guilt.<br>  <br>  Similarly, to dream of jail suggests that you are feeling restrained or censored in your work environment, relationship or situation in your life. You are feeling confined and suffocated. Alternatively, it represents also self-punishment and guilt.|`|A4G03Bzbaa	That you dont like him?

6GmtcZteaa	I think I am going to go on youtube and listen a different song. I got bored of the fray. any good songs you recomend ?<br>  <br>  LMFAO AT PINK SUGAR:P<br>  <br>  In audio signal processing and acoustics, an echo (plural echoes) is a reflection of sound, arriving at the listener some time after the direct sound. Typical examples are the echo produced by the bottom of a well, by a building, or by the walls of an enclosed room. A true echo is a single reflection of the sound source. The time delay is the extra distance divided by the speed of sound.<br>  <br>  If so many reflections arrive at a listener that they are unable to distinguish between them, the proper term is reverberation.<br>  <br>  An echo can be explained as a wave that has been reflected by a discontinuity in the propagation medium, and returns with sufficient magnitude and delay to be perceived.<br>  <br>  Echoes are reflected off walls or hard surfaces like mountains.<br>  <br>  When dealing with audible frequencies, the human ear cannot distinguish an echo from the original sound if the delay is less than 1/10 of a second. Thus, since the velocity of sound is approximately 343 m/s at a normal room temperature of about 20°C, the reflecting object must be more than 16.2 m from the sound source at this temperature for an echo to be heard by a person at the source.<br>  <br>  Sound travels approximately 343 meters/s (1100 ft/s). If a sound produces an echo in 2 seconds, the object producing the echo would be half that distance away (the sound takes half the time to get to the object and half the time to return). The distance for an object with a 2-second echo return would be 1 sec X 343 meters/s or 343 meters (1100 ft).<br>  <br>  In most situations with human hearing, echoes are about one-half second or about half this distance, since sounds grow fainter with distance. In nature, canyon walls or rock cliffs facing water are the most common natural settings for hearing echoes.<br>  <br>   Echo samples <br>   <br>  Clean signal, followed by different versions of echo. <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>   <br>   <br>  Problems listening to this file? See media help. <br>  The strength of an echo is frequently measured in dB sound pressure level SPL relative to the directly transmitted wave.<br>  <br>  Echoes may be desirable (as in sonar) or undesirable (as in telephone systems).<br>  <br>  In computing, an echo is the printing or display of characters (a) as they are entered from an input device, (b) as instructions are executed, or (c) as retransmitted characters received from a remote terminal.<br>  <br>  In computer graphics, an echo is the immediate notification of the current values provided by an input device to the operator at the display console.<br>  <br>  The name "echo" comes from the Greek nymph Ηχ? from Greek mythology. According to Greek mythology Echo was a Nymph who had the job of talking incessantly to Hera, the Queen of the Gods, so that her husband, Zeus, would not get caught in his numerous affairs. Hera caught on to Echo's trick and cursed her to only be able to say what others had just said — hence the word "echo". Yet according to Roman mythology it was Pan, who when Echo denied his love, tore her to shreds and scattered her about the Earth leaving bits of her everywhere for us to find, or rather for us to hear, forever.|`|kr0IgpDeaa	BECAUSE IS YELLING BACK AT YOU|`|xEmIhOc3aa	hay tiffany do u think i should wear this suit to the party <br>  <br>  tiff: oh yah u def. should we will work it 2gether <br>  <br>  both : "what ever it takes" <br>  <br>  degrassi quote :)|`|UwydFvKOaa	Yes! our voice do echo when we shout at the mountain top.

When you go to sleep keep thinking you will control the dream if you have it. try to do something different in the dream. try to resolve it in someway. I had recurring dreams to and one day the dream changed at the end "resolution" and I never had it again.
vAdtlZDpaa	Recurring dreams are especially significant and indicate that your subconscious is trying to communicate with you. You will keep having the dream or dreams with similar themes until you "get" the message.<br>  <br>  Flying dreams are common and signify a sense of freedom.  Many dreamers describe the ability to fly in their dreams as an exhilarating, joyful, and liberating experience.<br>  <br>  If you are flying with ease and enjoying the scene and landscape below, then it suggests that you are on top of a situation. You have risen above something. It may also mean that you have gained a different perspective on things. Flying dreams and the ability to control your flight is representative of your own personal sense of power.<br>  <br>  These could also be lucid dreams or Out of Body experiences, in which your soul really is "flying", until you wake and find it back in your body.

e88862626d5369dd487c7f4e8374547faa	The media both reflects the majority opinion and also shapes opinion by skewing information toward a specific concept or belief.<br>  <br>  The media is tending toward the athletic look in women and the public seems to be acceding to that look.  The media influences that perception by presenting that specific build in the most prominent places, such as magazine covers.<br>  <br>  Currently, intelligence is being presented in a more negative manner.  An example is the denouncement of David Li, the creator of the derivative formula based on  a single correlation rather than extensive history which seduced Wall Street into betting on dubious derivative bundles.  The general public is almost completely unaware of and uninterested in this practice.  Because of this disinterest, the media will focus more on the pragmatics of a resolution, rather than the reasons the crisis occurred in the first place.

From a totally theoretical point of view, I would not say C would withdraw, but he would become less of a factor because language would give A and B an attraction and advantage that C does not have, all things being equal.

Life sucks for them. But for us, over here? Heck no.

However, during my degree we were expected to understand the basic calculations and it is essential that you understand what the results of your statistical analyses mean.  Usually this involves things like the probability that your experimental results were due to your manipulation and not to chance.  Some of it is quite complex, but usually it is taught very well to students and even those who aren't good at maths (like me!) manage it all fine.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|6kUx7fwcaa	You do have statistics, which is usually performed by computers and you can find a lot of help to interpret and choose the right ones and setting it up the programs.

CL5kLE2paa	I think its simple jealousy.  She is obviously envious of your way of life.  Just view her as a narrow minded person and let it go over your head.|`|B1GjfOUdaa	Sounds like she just might be jealous of your life style.|`|iUzSlmSbaa	Personally I believe she meant this in a condescending way.. by hinting at ''I am a working woman but I manage to be a mother and a wife at the same time.. you only are a career woman, you can't do all that at once.. '' it was a hint without needing to be put in words.. I don't believe she is jealous but condescending.<br>  I had to deal with this also.. In my case I would have loved to have had children.. but a tiny routine operation with a laproscope slashed one of my ovaries.. It was hard to find females of my age group as friends.. because most of them did have children. I love children and get along fine with them, but people also automatically assume because I never had children of my own that i wouldn't understand what they are talking about.. that a woman who never brought a child into the world has no right to give advice about children and their upbringing .. as we were never mothers.. '' I am sure she is the same kind of woman.. who thinks with a narrow mind.. she doesn't just do that to you, she will treat each woman who is childless the same way.. so I would let her and be polite to her.. if she says anything else about children..I would tell her ''I am happy with my life as it is but that doesn't mean I do not like children.. I love my nieces and nephews..'' and if she rants on that that's not at all the same as being a mother oneself I would say.. ''well probably it can't be but this was my choice of a lifestyle, everybody should have a choice''.. and if she still goes on that shows she is a narrow minded woman and nothing you say can change her.. she is not picking  on you in particular..  Believe me, every woman your age who has no children of their own will be treated by someone like her in the same way.. so you aren't the only one.. I would take the whole thing with a pinch of salt. . Least said, soonest mended.. it's just not worth it.. some people one can stand on ones head and it won't change a thing.. their mind is not able to adapt or to even treat everyone in a civilized way.. they can't do it.. I would leave her alone.. one day she may say too much.. What if there is a young woman who had ovarian cancer when she was still in her 20's and had to have them removed in order to live and she wanted children and your narrow minded colleague tells her she will never understand as she never had kids.. then she is really going too far..  I have long since accepted that some people judge if one doesn't have kids.. in your case it was your choice and you are happy with your life as it is.. that's all that matters. In my case, I was not given the chance to have kids but now I am over the pain.. as I am 46 years old.. I managed instead to move from Europe to Canada with my husband which we could not have done if we had had children.. so everything is probably meant for a reason..<br>  I would be polite to her.. and treat her like all other colleagues, if she broaches the subject again about her children.. then I would say.. yes.. I am sure you know what's best for your children and leave the subject alone and not let her get me agitated|`|a9e5IZOWaa	i agree with the 2 previous answers.<br>  <br>  not only is she very jealous of you and your lifestyle but she sounds very insecure.<br>  <br>  i would just ignore any little digs---be the better person because at the moment she is the one who looks an idiot.|`|ZkrGttKaaa	Sounds like she has preconcieved notions about you.

Hasn't anyone read The Prince? <br>  <br>  First, as Hamilton's Federalist No. 15 states, it is virtually impossible to establish any real meaning as a government (democratic, tyrannical or otherwise) without a military. Not only does the military provide for the common defence, keep usurpers in check and invest a people into nationhood, it also can be used to enforce tax collection. A dictator without an army is illegitimate.<br>  <br>  Second, "overt psychological conditioning" is a fuzzy term. I assume by the author adding "overt," he knows that all social constructs are by their nature psychological conditions and therefore are manufactured with psychological conditioning. This is why most states have state school systems. They are methods of indoctrination. So, in order to appeal to the incombent subjects, one must use such methods, namely "prestige."<br>  <br>  Here is a quick list of the prestiges and what they are:<br>  <br>  Sexuality: There is much to be said for a good looking dictator.<br>  <br>  Defense: Establishing dominance is important. People need to feel protected. If you are stronger than them, then you may also be stronger than their enemies and therefore may protect them if they show you devotion. War is the most primitive way to do this. But since we're not allowed to immediately use force, this can be done through display. Military parades and weapons expositions are perfect. You want everyone to know what you're packing.<br>  <br>  Territorial: You need space and shiney things. You need to own the grandest palace on the most beautiful terrain possible. Excess, excess, excess. If you own enough glorious things, the people will start to grant you authority over what is glorious. <br>  <br>  Economical: Being unapproachably wealthy is another fantastic way to gain respect. Warren Buffet could never take over the United States with his measly $67 Billion. It takes real money to be a true soveriegn god among men. And you can't do it using other people's money. You have to establish your own currency. As Rothschild stated, "Give me control of a nation's banks and I care not who makes its laws." <br>  <br>  Exploitational: Takeover resources. More than money, this is the most profound leverage. They need water, food, energy, building materials, transportation, communication, ect. Having absolute power over any one of these things will make you invincible. <br>  <br>  Instructional: Having lots of people listen to you is the telltale sign of someone with prestige. Address the largest audiences possible. In this way, the mass media is a dictator's best friend. A relatively recent addition to the arsenal of statehood, the media can make and break regimes. If you appear on the tube, your subjects will swallow anything you say. <br>  <br>  Institutional: Belonging to the right groups will also grant you some respect. Look at the university heritage US leaders are attached to. Beyond education, assembling an identifiable organization is another great way to show the world you're a Somebody.<br>  <br>  Temporal: Timing is everything. To master timing is the secret of the super-dictators. Knowing the future and the past grants a special perception virtually unknown to your underlings. You can tell them how things were, and, more importantly, how things will be. The Greeks, for example, revered one member in their society over kings and princes- the Oracle. To understand Time is to understand the world, a feat the masses crave.<br>  <br>  Artificial: This is established through something done or created. Valor in war, perfect prose, a masterful painting, grand architecture, high theory, whatever. The idea is that your fame is attached to an action or object and is not inherently possessed. <br>  <br>  It is important to note that the whole is greater than the parts when it comes to prestige. Beauty fades, weapons rust, property breaks, money depleats, resources dwindle, audiences revolt, institutions crumble, time changes and works of art are forgotten, however using these forms in conjuntion will assure vitality through the ages.|`|khbSXMcIaa	beat them into submission...<br>  <br>  just kidding lmfao...<br>  <br>  i would make them happy, tell them what they want. maybe i would con them into believing i was the best... stuff like that.<br>  <br>  i don't think that answered your question... but just go with it.

854xeaRvaa	let me tell you about emotions, the more you focus in them the stronger they grow to take possession of you . hence, whenever you feel jealous, try not to act upon the feeling, try not to focus on it or to review with yourself why you felt this or reproach it because it's an instinct and it got out of control with you. try on the other hand to work on its positive conterpart. fight for and not against . try also to work on your stress because jeaoulsy can hardly erupt in a tranquil essence . develop a habit that will give you a sustained feeling of fulfillment because usually people use jealousy as protecting mechanism having invested all their hopes and values in something they can't control and apparently is being taken by someone else. do the best thing to you and to those around you by creating a privet, rich individual life to function as the backwall that supports you when you need it. again refrain from dwelling upon your jealousy and once you feel it substitute it with a pre-thought of positive feeling or merely stop and physically engage in something distracting till it goes away this is in the situation itself. back home, start to feed your mind and emotions with positivity and give all your energy and focus to it. what you experience is a natural thing but being individuals with free will we must learn to discipline our impulses and this is really the way.|`|vsQBW5jaaa	Talk to the guy you like and everything but you cant stop him from talking to other girls.

Jealousy always has to do with love matters. like you get jealous for no reason over a guy who never showed he was interested in you..  he is not in a relationship with you and you feel hostile when he pays attention to another girl and your anger is not directed toward him but to her. the most innocent person in all of this.. because it's his choice who he is attracted to.. if he was attracted to you, he would talk to you..  and too much jealousy makes a person controlling in a relationship and clingy.. and it makes you check up on a partner because you mistrust him.. and no relationship has a chance to last if there is no mutual respect and mutual trust and honesty.. and the ability to talk to each other about what' s on yours and your partners mind..you have to be able to talk to him about your concerns.. and you have to learn to trust someone otherwise they will run away.. it's like trying to hold love on a leash.. that's not possible. if you love someone you trust them.. you have to take that leap of faith.. and in your case as this is extreme.. I believe you are extremely insecure.. otherwise you would when you are in a relationship say to yourself..  '' he chose me as his partner, so I believe in myself and I believe in us as a couple.. I don't need to check up on him, I trust him, there can't be love without trust..'' you really need to learn to boost your self image and self esteem and I do believe it would be very helpful to you if you went to councelling.. that does not mean that you  are not normal .. but you can learn in councelling how to overcome your inferiority feeling which you must have if you envy others for their possessions and if you hate other girls because a guy who does not even know you makes you want to cut that girls throat.. she definitely did nothing to you and he obiviously is interested in her and not in you.. In councelling you can learn your own value and self esteem and then you will attract guys for who you are .. because you will feel confident in your own skin and not be jealous.. if a guy chooses you as his GF.. he does so because he wants you and no other and you can't begrudge other guys to make their own choice which girl they love.. and if it's not you .. if you got confidence, you won't mind.. because what you never had you can't lose... so I suggest councelling.. talking about this to a professional.. no medication but talk.. how to gain more self confidence. How to overcome envy of other peoples possessions and how to trust a partner and to not be controlling and to not try to check up on him and keep him on a leash.. otherwise if you don't take this step, it is likely that all your relationships will end because of your jealousy.. which is unfounded most likely but stems from a deep insecurity...

tOWnGwtoaa	Pain, especially shock, stimulates the release of dopamine in the brain.  This has a soporific effect, in that the person experiencing it has a lowered emotional response.  The evolutionary reason for this seems to be that a person who is badly hurt will tend to stay in one place and relax, instead of moving around and attracting the attention of predators or enemies.  If a person is already running on adrenaline when the injury occurs, there is less release of dopamine, in order to allow the person to continue to do whatever strenuous activity they were already doing.<br>  <br>  Contrary to what seems logical, most sharp pain elicits a lot of the same feelings that you would get from morphine.  For people in emotional distress, this can come as a great relief, because the morphine feeling actually decreases the anxiety that they're going through.  Most people will claim that the pain gives them an external focus to their internal pain, but it is more likely that they choose to cut because they know that their emotions will mysteriously mellow.<br>  <br>  Additionally - scissors are likely to be a source of infection.  And, yes - cutting is addictive, in the same way that opiates are addictive.  Getting help for your friend as soon as possible is a very good idea, and I'm glad you're doing it.|`|pMzq6B3paa	Your friend needs a psychologist.... She probably has something bothering her that's deeper than you think. I had a friend in high school who used to cut herself.... It turned out that a family member was molesting her... I'm not saying that's what's wrong with your friend, but whatever it is, its got to be bad for her to be so depressed and cutting herself.|`|trMsK86jaa	She wants you to understand her, because she does not understand herself.|`|khbSXMcIaa	sometimes people do that because they want a release, some way to escape.|`|BDmIunjSaa	I used to be a cutter, and its hard for someone who's never been through it before to understand. <br>  Its also hard for family and friends to see someone close go through it.<br>  Its not that it makes her feel better physically, its more.. taking the pain that you are going through somewhere else. <br>  It doesnt get better, it doesnt go away automatically, sometimes its like an addiction, and without professional help, it will get worse. <br>  Of course you can get an infection from anything thats not sterile, so she really has to be careful of that. <br>  Theres probably nothing you can do but to make sure she gets PROFESSIONAL help before it turns bad, i.e. bleeding to death, committing suicide, or even cut a vein open. Be her friend and make sure you are there for her through everything. Thats the best thing you can offer is an ear and your heart.<br>  best of wishes to you and your friend.|`|cgdJRzj8aa	I think its the depression that is the root. see, depressive symptoms mean, something is paining inside. she is taking the cutting pain so to divert her mind from that of within. the heart ache is much more intolerable than the cut. cutting gives her a sense of ruthlessness to herself.may be that tells her that she is strong. she may have pent up grievances that she is unable to express. so she is reducing that by being hostile to herself. you need to find out what triggered the depression. may be that would give you some ideas about what to do.you need to earn her trust. I know for a fact that Angellina Jolie was a cutter too, and her father had left them when she was a child. sometimes, dysfunctional family can cause this. my best friend used to cut open her arm whenever something went wrong. she did not have anyone to depend on or to make her feel wanted. so she vented in this way. it was only after her boyfriend made her swear on his life that she stopped it, out of sheer fear of losing the one person who loves her, make her happy. the addiction is almost gone now. though at times she still has trouble controlling the impulse.|`|qPj7p6D1aa	Dally C., I'm curious about the last sentence you've posted. You may have concerns for the other person's health, however there could be more to this than what you have questioned. Of course infection is a problem but the also serious event is the cutting. Within the cognitive networks of the brain and the pain/pleasure sensory judgment has somehow become short-circuited.

Meaning whatever or whoever is the reason behind her depression, she can't deal with it, and this is her internal reponse. It's comforting to keep ourselves in pain when we feel that either its our fault that things go the way they do, or that the only way to take out the frustration is(since u can't give the one responsible pain), u do it to urself. It's an intense emotion to ONESELF and it's dangerous(as you know).<br>  <br>  She may feel that her state of being, whatever is happening with her, it's all her fault. and she's taking it out on herself. hurting herself is a way she feels she can COPE with it. They get worse, it's quite addicting.<br>  <br>  She is ALREADY hurt, hurting herself physically may make her feel that she's run away from what's bugging her(temporarily ofcourse). Help her see life better. <br>  <br>  In short, when you can't reach at what's hurt you, your state-of-mind tuns so that you begin to feel pleasure or you seek comfort in hurting youself, as you begin to feel it's ALL UR FAULT. take care of her, and urself.<br>  <br>  I know it might not make sense to you, but it's the best way i cud express it. Goodluck!
qPlx1Ejhaa	I think your generalisation is correct. It fits the man-bad/female good stereotype that permeates society.

xBOgB0Enaa	Interesting question, and I don't think Gulku answered it fully.<br>  <br>  Money can indeed appear out of nowhere and disappear just as quickly.  In fact, private banks and other lending institutions manipulate the supply of money every day.  It's what they do.<br>  <br>  You see, only a small fraction of the money in existence is cash from the government.  The rest is supplied by commercial banks and exists only as deposits.  When a bank makes a loan to someone, the amount of money that is borrowed is created on the spot.  Then, as the loan is paid off, that money disappears.  Over time, as existing loans are paid off or fall into default (can't be paid), if not enough new loans are made, then the total supply of money will decline.<br>  <br>  In other words, if we're experiencing a situation where nobody has any money, it's happening because banks aren't lending us as much as they usually do.<br>  <br>  I don't have time to answer the question fully either.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.

4WvdDCHSaa	Social Variation.|`|YIBgH9LSaa	This concept defined by a philosopher is also known by the principle name of the difference. The social differentiation consists of a term that recognizes the inequalities that exist between the different groups from people, are these of race, economic position, education, sort, etc. The social differentiation talks about to that each human being is unique and different from all the others. Each of us has particular physical characteristics, color of hair, height, but the social differentiation also makes reference to a set of psychological characters and the circumstances and experiences that each person lived throughout her life, like, for example, a certain economic situation. The binoculars physically can be very similar, but even have different forms to be. In order to understand the concept of social difference it is necessary to also consider the physical characteristics, emotional and the experiences that cause that a person of is determined form. Some differences do not have anything of bad nor of good in themselves, like the age, the sort, the face color of skin, characteristics or the ethnic group. These differences are inherited, they are received genetically from the parents or they are defined from the birth. The experiences also lived influence in our form to be and to think, our tastes, beliefs, style of life.
0DYvcX6gaa	Conflict theory arises from stress situations largely influenced by the bourgeoisie who makes life difficult for the proletariat by having the most access to resources and power. The essence of conflict theory is best epitomized by the classic 'pyramid structure' in which an elite dictates terms to the larger masses.<br>  <br>  Got that? ;-)|`|C8Djjxqkaa	It is the theory that a continual struggle exists between all different aspects of a particular society. So workers conflict with management. Left wing verses right wing, etc. Each groups struggles to benefit themselves as others do and that is where the conflict lies.|`|IY4QSajIaa	In sociology, conflict theories like Marxism and radical feminism are claiming that society is fundamentally divided between hostile groups and that this underlying conflict shapes the social system.<br>  <br>  E.g. Marxism claims that the owners of the means of production and the wage-earners are always in conflict with each other. Put crudely, if you own a factory you want prices to be high (as you sell goods) and wages to be low (to cut costs), but if you work for wages then you want the opposite - high wages and low prices. Hence, Marxists claim, the two must be in competition - if one is to gain the other must lose out.|`|d4N7kEzeaa	A conflict theory is a theory which emphasizes the role that a person or group's ability has to exercise influence and control over others in producing social order. It states that a society functions so that each individual participant and its groups struggle to maximize their benefits, which inevitably contributes to social change such as changes in politics and revolutions.

Our broad views and ideas are comforting to others and we often offer insights that were previously not considered, as many people with a closed minded temperamaent have a difficult time seeing outside of the box.  I tell them not to be afraid of thinking outside of the box, as they will most likely see that it is just a much LARGER box.  This happens by degrees, no one is born open minded.|`|ACCIArkDaa	Because OPEN MINDED people dont look at the world thru tunnel vision.

They make bizarre leaps of logic, support their allegations with tripe, and insist that all the ills of the world are the fault of women who seek to level that field between genders.<br>  <br>  According to them, rape doesn't exist, there is no real difference in men and women's wages, and opportunities, and feminists are cigar smoking lesbians who hate men. There are no shades of gray---just Black (feminism) and white (their View).<br>  <br>  I'm nearly 50, and since I was a young single woman, very little has changed in the world, vis a vis birth control.

pKQQiqazaa	I don't think it's a necessity, but they do have their advantages. I went to an all women's college and I not only had a great education, I gained some valuable personal skills that made me into the person I am today. I learned how to be more confident in myself, to speak my mind, and to focus on what was happening around me, among others. It was a great opportunity, and I wouldn't change a thing. However, that being said, there is the tendency for some, of either sex in this situation, to fall into the social awkward category around the opposite sex. It happens I think if you are around the same society and cultural group for the majority of the time. In all, going to an all women's college put my education and personal well being in the first priority.|`|hSfDlNW5aa	Both previous answers were great and I can agree with both on some points.<br>  <br>  Ideally I think the entire school system should be overhauled to recognize that not everyone thinks and learns the same no matter what their sex.<br>  <br>  Also segregating along personality type or sex is almost back to a racists situation.<br>  <br>  NASA has studied and proved that teams of both men and women work together the best.<br>  <br>  Keep schools unsegregated but have educators better trained to teach a variety of students and not force everyone into the same mould.|`|3tuwWidiaa	In general, I'm against separate schools.  Why?  Because the "real world" is not (and should not!) be separated that way.  There are vital social skills, including being able to thrive in environments where you are potentially discriminated against, that can be learned in school (be in high school or college).  I'm not for that kind of discrimination, of course.  But if you don't learn it in the relative safety of school, how will you fare in the "real" world?<br>  <br>  However, there is something to the fact that the sexes may learn differently.  As such, if separate sex schooling prepares people to be on level footing when they graduate, there is some value.  However, I'm suggest that the separation not be based on sex, but on other things such as personality type.  Some girls and women thrive in a male dominated environment.  Likewise, some boys and men are better able to learn in a more female dominated environment.  By drawing the distinction on sex lines, we're further reinforcing the idea that all boys are a certain way and all girls are another.<br>  <br>  So, in the end, I'm against the notion of separated schools or even classes... based on sex.  The benefits of being forced to mix and deal with a diverse set of people outweigh the costs and risks.|`|AA12398775	I went to an all girl's school, any college afterwards was of course mixed sexes - socially I think it made me really shy around the opposite sex for quite a while.  Academically.... I study better with the opposite sex - because the males I mix with like to discuss lectures and topics more so than the females, who I dont' know, maybe they are conscious about seeming geeky or something, so they might just pretend not to be interesting.<br>  <br>  In my all-girls school if someone was thought to be lesbian rumours would go around everywhere and they would be excluded from any social groups  etc etc ... even if they weren't lesbian.<br>  <br>  What would happen in an all-boy's school?

vAdtlZDpaa	Colors in dreams represent energy, emotions, and vibes. Different colors represent different things. <br>  <br>  Different animals have different meanings, according to what the animal is doing, the setting of the dream, and how you feel about the animal in waking life. <br>  <br>  Likewise different rooms and settings have different meanings. It is impossible to give an interpretation without more details. <br>  <br>  Bridges in your dreams signify important decisions or a critical junctions in your waking life.  Bridges also represent a transitional period in your life where you will be moving on to a new stage. Alternatively, the bridge may indicate that you are trying to "bridge" or connect two things together. If you can't get to them in your dream, it could indicate feeling "stuck" in your waking life - wanting to move on or do something different, but not feeling like you are able to.
zU9KQYmHaa	You're at an age when lots of growth and change take place.  I'd say you are smart to think of asking about exercises!  Just think of confidence as the words you say to yourself, about yourself.  You need to start practicing saying good things to yourself, about yourself.  You could tell yourself that you are fun and interesting and that girls like saying Hi and talking to you.  As you hear yourself, it will start to sink in deeper.  Now all you hear is your timidity, fears and shyness telling you to keep quiet.  That isn't working so good.  So now is the time in your life when you will try out the different possibilities of your personality.  It's called self-realization, and it's fantastic!  Good luck.|`|2zOSXL4yaa	Im not sure its possible, all the girls laught at you behind your back.|`|m4r8QJkjaa	Dont think that ur talking to a girl.......instead think that ur just speaking to ur friend.....|`|6GmtcZteaa	Practice talking to your sister or one of her friends, just chit-chat.

vAdtlZDpaa	Your brother in your dream doesn't actually represent your brother in real life, but rather some personality trait or quality that your brother embodies for you. Only you know what that is.<br>  <br>  To dream that you are receiving gifts indicates that you are being rewarded and recognized for your generosity and giving nature. You are held in high esteem by those around you.<br>  <br>  To dream of clothes is symbolic of your public self and how you are perceived. It is indicative of the act you put on in front of others. Clothes are also an indication of your condition and status in life. In your dream your brother gave you a blouse that was "appropriate, but not functional".  <br>  <br>  I think this dream is about doing what is expected by others in society and being rewarded for it, but at the same realizing that it is not necessarily what is best for you. I think the part about your brother cradling you in his arms at the end "with an apologetic look on his face" has to do with your subconscious wanting you to know that you are still loved and cherished no matter what, and sort of feeling sorry for yourself that you are in this situation - whatever it is. Perhaps for you your brother symbolizes common sense, the voice of reason, or maybe a self compassionate side of your personality that you have not given much energy to?|`|P0EAzyw8aa	It means that you feel protected by your brother, the part about the blouse not fitting is that you feel you have outgrown each other and need not to rely on him as much but you miss him.|`|eLxD5HbBaa	Well sometimes when you have amourous dreams about people that you clearly arnt interested in it means that you admire them or you are jealous of them....so maybe the admiration that you have for your brother manifested in your subconcious ...so really nothing to worry about in fact that sounds really great :D|`|lndaCQmGaa	<a href="http://inall.lovez.it" rel="nofollow">http://inall.lovez.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|AA11199260	You will get love from your brother and both of you will again be loving each other.

But if you think she is in love with you too, then she probably wouldn't be in love with your best friend and it would not be fair to him. Because I'm sure that your best friend would want the person he is with to love him too. So it sounds like a really complicated situation.

They assume that by not supporting feminism you aren't supporting women's rights, so then based on that they make another assumption that if you're not supporting women's rights you must be supporting men's rights instead. Which of course is probably not true but that's what happens when people assume. <br>  <br>  A lot of people also think that modern feminism supports equal treatment. I know when I first came to this board not too long ago, that's what I thought. When I heard people bashing feminism I was appalled and thought they must be woman-haters who want us to all serve you. Or something. But then I stuck around and you guys actually taught me something. And now I don't think I want to be associated with feminism, not that I was in the first place, because I wouldn't want to support oppression of men.<br>  <br>  Sometimes people equate feminism with women, so when people criticize feminism they think they're criticizing women in general.

Throughout history people have labeled others to strengthen a weak position. The trick is to repeat the label enough times to enough people and get the label into popular jargon where people will accept it as truth when it is really fiction. MRA is a good example. The one label that is popular now is homophobic. Being a medical professional you know that there is no medically recognized phobia of homosexuals. However the word is used over and over to describe a person who does not agree with the homosexual lifestyle and agenda. Homophobia is a made up word, a label to discredit opposition.

AA12360662	First of all, not sure if you are a mother in reality and or if you have babies in reality.  That makes a difference in dream interpretation.<br>  <br>  Projecting milk coming out of a woman's breasts could mean the desire of having a baby, there may be a need to share this to the one you love which is your baby.<br>  <br>  However, it could also meant that you have the desire to share things in you.  It is another way to seek attention.  You are seeking for others to know what you are, who you are.  Milk basically reflects need, but this need basically is to give rather to take.|`|8d8ejHPfaa	If you're a mother in real life, or not, you have the ability to nurture others around you :)|`|vAdtlZDpaa	Breast Feeding <br>  To dream that you are breast feeding, symbolizes tenderness, love, nurturance, and motherly love. Good things will be at your grasp. Alternatively, the dream suggests that you need to be careful in who you confide in. <br>  <br>  Breasts <br>  To see breasts in your dream, symbolizes primal nourishment and your need to be nursed and care for. It represent motherhood, nurturance, and infantile dependency. Alternatively, breasts represents sexual arousal and raw energy. <br>  <br>  Seeing naked breasts can also denote a feeling of exposure and invasion of privacy. In particular, for a woman, the dream may indicate anxieties about becoming a woman/mother. <br>  <br>  Nursing <br>  To see someone nursing or dream that you are nursing, suggests that you are nurturing a hidden aspect of yourself.

So really if someone can't find quotes from men haing women, women hating men, women hating women, men hating aliens... they just aren't trying.<br>  <br>  The real issue is that its VERY easy also to find people spreading prejudice about men, and these people are not social outcasts but feminists with high-profile top jobs.

pu6neAAvaa	NEWSFLASH.-...--.---..--.-..-...-.--. %99.9 percent of colorblind people can see colors and know what different colors look like. The issue is that sometimes we can't tell the difference between colors in real life settings. From a distance four piles of fruit that were piled together might look like one or two piles. Also some of us have trouble naming certain colors. Natural colors in natural settings or paint are the most difficult. It's not that I can't see the color. It's like I don't connect the color with a word. You look at a math problem and can't solve it. I look at a color. If there was light green yellow and red leaves I the colors would blend and seem like one. However i can regonize the tiniest difference in shade with almost super human ability. Check out some color blindness tests online. Also vischeck.com is very ineresting. You will see that a color blind person can many times see things you cannot|`|2sLfhnPpaa	You can't really dream about something you've never seen... they literally don't know what some colors look like so they wouldn't know what that color was. Color blind does not mean they see in black and white, but just that they can not see some colors (i think something like green, blue, and red). So yes, they dream in color, but only the colors that they have experienced.|`|cgdJRzj8aa	i don't think so. since they can not perceive some color, so they won't have any memory of those color, either, right. so, i don't think they would have those colors in their dreams. but of course, if the blindness occurred significantly later in life, it is possible to have colors in their dreams, until the memory fades away. it is of course, my assumption.|`|trO3fQnraa	They are color blind...how would they know?|`|123cb0f60a65c8151ec27e589a993e7faa	Also "check out" the opinion of that U.S. heroine,Helen Keller.<br>   (Who wrote extensively,not just her rather-short-but famous "the story of my life"; lots of other books,too-not forgetting that she was interested in lots-of-things,as she successfully travelled to england to complete her higher educational degree).|`|o3tA2ORIaa	maybe, i dont know coz im not color blind, but i think yes, coz dreaming has nothing to do with how thet see in reality

I used to sleep to relax, now when I go to sleep, I have to watch someone throw one of my family members into an oven alive or watch them dig up my dead grandfather and watch his rotted body parts fall off, so yeah, this sucks. You are probably going through some kind of worry about your family or just life in general, if this continues, you should see someone.

Mh99iXFOaa	Its sounds as if you aren't as happy in the present than what you were in the past and your desperatly clinging on to what reminds you of more happier times. The only thing you can do is to remind your self that these are happy times in the past that stay in the past. Find a hobby or something to do that makes you happy. i think you need to find something that makes you happy again and to except that you cannot bring back the past. :)|`|9SgoJ4aDaa	keep yourself busy in doing some courageous work|`|p8nDiI3Vaa	Actually, that's a blessing to be able to go to the past like that. Not many people can remember our past. I can remember all the way back to when I was one. You should turn that thought around about forgetting your past because it's a reminder of your innocence and how your were and how you can be just as innocent in a world that shows little love and is corrupt. Let your innocence be a reminder to you as an adult.
zU9KQYmHaa	Ok, let's boil it down to basics.  Self-esteem.  That's not what you "think" others "think" about you.  It's what you really think about you.  So job number one is this: Start working on not caring what others think of you.  This exercise can last a lifetime if you are sensitive like me, but it does get easier.  <br>  <br>  Make a list of things you like about yourself, or talents you possess.   Write down good decisions you've made, good friends, and names of supportive famliy members, teachers, etc.  Make this your "GO TO LIST"  when you need a dose of self-esteem raiser!  Everyone has to work on this, it doesn't come naturally for many people.  It's also a natural part of growing up.  You're questioning yourself, trying to get to a place of meaningful self-realization.  And it doesn't happen in junior high, or high school as easily for everybody as it does for the seemingly popular crowd. <br>  <br>   I'm 44 yrs old now, and just starting to figure out what happened when I was a kid.  Kids can be very cruel, and insensitive.  Tough it out, and know that someday this will not be as difficult.  Tell yourself you are the best "you" that you can be at this moment; and you like yourself because of who you are as a person.  In the end, it's just you that you're stuck with!  Enjoy who you are, especially while life is young, and you're still discovering yourself.  It's wonderful, but painful, too.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck, keep checking in on this stuff, it's good for you.|`|mWj0X5enaa	The first step to great self esteem is to accept and love who you are. This may sound difficult at first but start by writing a list of stuff you like about yourself eg nice eyes, cute smile, great at subject. After that try and find out what lowers your self esteem. For example if it's a so called friend putting you down tell her to back off. Or if your feeling confident tell her to get stuffed. A great book that really helps is Called Think Pink by Lisa clarke and yes i know that costs but if you feel like it it is defiantly worth it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  Nix x<br>  <br>  P.S because your worth it (lol)|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	This is usually the result of mental abuse.  Its a form of control for one person to make another believe they are not worth while.  Step outside yourself and look back on everything you've been through.|`|Dv6KSxmlaa	I don't really suffer from low self esteem currently, but at one time I had identity issues like every other teen, so I worked my way out of that low of self esteem. After my life events that I've been through, I feel I have something constructive to say on this subject. <br>  <br>  First of all, don't put yourself down about things. If you make a mistakes, admit you're wrong and do your best to fix it rather than dwelling on the past. Life is short, don't spend your time worrying about what you've done wrong. <br>  <br>  Second, we'll have a look at the other side of this idea. If you do something well, give yourself a theoretical pat on the back! Know that you've done a good job, and have talents that can be put to good use. <br>  <br>  Third, set and accomplish goals to use your skills, and develop new ones. If self improvement is something you want to do, set a small goal and work toward it. Striving to do things better is an excellent way to fire up a little competition and raise that self esteem. <br>  <br>  Most importantly though, you have to maintain that positive mindset. Never tell yourself that you're doing badly, just try again and hopefully do better. <br>  <br>  Remember to accept credit for everything you do well and take pride in it. You don't need to be humble right now, you need to get out there and kick some butt (in an academic, artistic, social, or talented way, depending on what YOU are good at.) Oh, and keep in mind this doesn't happen overnight. Raising your self esteem is an ongoing process that will take a little while.
Myyjyeg4aa	It could be limerence.   Although, most of the research on limerence states that you become hot and flushed and shy when near your limerent object, that is not always the case. Limerence is mostly about the intrusive thinking that accompanies having a limerent object.   If it is limerence, then it is really out of your control.

Ill bet you also think of everything you want to say to him over and over again in your mind. But If you truly believe that you have a chance with this Guy do not bottle up everything, it wont work.

pSiwm8rmaa	You're ****** up in the head. Duh.|`|vAdtlZDpaa	To dream that you are being chased signifies that you are avoiding a situation that you do not think is conquerable. It is often a metaphor for some form of insecurity. Alternatively, you may be running away from a primal urge or fear. <br>  <br>  Zombies denote physical and/or emotional detachment from people and situations that are currently surrounding you - being out of touch. Alternatively, it may indicate feeling dead inside and are simply going through the motions of daily living.|`|ZaYdUOXCaa	I don't know my friend has that recurring dream<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Chase dreams is one of several common dream themes. As with most of the common dreams, they often stem from feelings of anxiety in your walking life. Running is an instinctive response to physical threats in your environment. In these dreams, you can be pursued by an attacker, an animal or an unknown figure, who wants to hurt or possibly kill you. In turn, you run, hide or try to outwit your pursuer. Your actions in the dream parallel how you respond to pressure and cope with fears, stress or various situations in your waking life. Instead of confronting the situation, you are running away and avoiding it. Ask yourself who is the one chasing you so that you can gain understanding and insight on the source of your fears and anxieties.<br>  <br>  The pursuer or attacker who is chasing you in your dream may also represent an aspect of yourself. Your own feelings of anger, jealousy, fear, and possibly love, can assume the appearance of threatening figure. The shadowy figure can also symbolize rejected characteristics of your self. You may be projecting these feelings onto the unknown chaser. Next time you have a chase dream, turn around and confront your pursuer. Ask them why they are chasing you. Perhaps you are running away from something. What are you trying to run from?<br>  <br>  If you are the one doing the chasing, then the dream may highlight your drive and ambition to go after something you want. Or perhaps the dream suggests that you are falling behind and having to catch up with everyone else.<br>  <br>  Consider the distance or gap between you and your pursuer. This indicates your closeness to the issue. If the pursuer is gaining on you, then it suggests that the problem is not going to go away. The problem will surround you until you confront and address it. However, if you are able to widen the gap between your pursuer, then the problem is becoming less and less of an issue. You are able to successful distance yourself from the problem. In essence, the problem is fading away.<br>  <br>  A more direct analysis of chase dreams is the fear of being attacked. Such dreams are more common among women than men, who may feel physically vulnerable in the urban environment. These dreams are inspired by fears of violence and sexual assault in which we are so over-exposed from the media, which magnifies such fears|`|X1j7qYkUaa	If you're the only survivor in a world of zombies, way to go for the ego on you.  The other thing to remember with zombies, whether male or female, they're willing to eat you and they will swallow. <br>  <br>  Ever have any dreams of track and field events, of winning manually powered races? Otherwise you might just consider yourself bait for the empire of capitalistic, cannibalistic mass of humanity.  So come on, surrender already. Become one of us... We don't bite that hard, but we do share with friends.  <br>  <br>  It probably wouldn't help if you gave a few more details, but it could be an enjoyable pasttime. Though to avoid the crackpot analyst circuit, i'd need to know more details. <br>  <br>  Though chances are if you're running you're not that helpless. If your intention is for survival then you have a path, even if it doesn't have a clear destination.  <br>  <br>  But even though they're "zombies" the question begs to be asked, why are you running?  What reason have they given you?  <br>  <br>  So that of itself falls to the poppycock of power and futility - an organized mass with one intention, and that intention has no place for you as a person, but rather as either becoming part of the mass or being free-range cattle. <br>  <br>  A world full of zombies and those two are really you're only options. Which probably means regardless of how much you run, how far, how fast... it's all irrelevant. The only thing you have is yourself, your life. <br>  <br>  So is it a fear of dying or becoming a zombie?<br>  <br>  If you're constantly running... then you're just a hamster on a wheel. It's likely you don't even remember what shoes you were wearing at the time or how long it had been since you last changed your underwear, shaved, what you had for breakfast, the details of the scenery from one block to the next.  I'm sure there's a packaged routine in the chase, even when the scenery and situation changes. <br>  <br>  Of course, maybe you're the last zombie. In the end it doesn't much change the mob mentality of those chasing you, for being themselves as much as the mass organism and machine. <br>  <br>  But I digress.  So, I'll bite, I think it means you need to bite back.... because remember, everything tastes like chicken.  Though the smell rather reminds me of pork.|`|AA12360662	Zombies in dream symbol may mean helplessness while being chased by them reflects being criticized by others.<br>  <br>  Putting them together, it may may you are feeling lack of control and helpless when it comes to words you feel hurt emotionally in reality. <br>  <br>  That is why you had dream vent out.|`|af0nGRPzaa	I think it means stop playing zombie games for a little bit.

wKbEKg0Paa	You should definitely put some space for different areas of your life. In Aristotle's "Nicomachean Ethics", it is good to separate the social circles you have for leisure, business, and intimate relationships. Getting intimate friends in business can cause strain and tension. I am a member of a sports club and I would never think of having a business venture with my clubmates. I can't afford to be as competitive as I'd like to be if I were to play against a business associate. While you can have many friends, it is good to have a relatively small inner circle. This small inner circle could act as a shield for you so that you can have more personal space. However, if in some random place, my social circles intersect, I would be courteous enough to introduce them to one another.|`|9JZQ3N5Aaa	I set up priorities in life and work according to it.|`|trMsK86jaa	No, i don't allocate time.|`|lEQ4PhpLaa	A only have a very small circle of friends who are more like my family. Some members of my family I wouldn't trust with anything. I don't really ever feel afraid to mix the two, I have really good friends who know all about me. If they don't like me they can hit the road. I don't really have a social circle as I see them as pretentious popularity contests and I've matured past that. I've had to survive some rough times and my friends have always had my back, where my family watches me fall.
lEQ4PhpLaa	Yeah I'm bipolar. I take it one day at a time. I keep a journal, go for long quite walks alone. I listen to music and I read. I talk to those very close to me about how I feel. I'm seeing a psychiatrist to help me. Fresh air always helps, sometimes you need the wind on your face to feel alive. I meditate, and I keep a small hobby to keep a sense of accomplishment.|`|DAsQ4UZ8aa	Yes, and everybody does.  Some have worse days than others, and some people deal with it better than others.  The literary term is Ennui, but the clinical term is general depressive disorder.  My suggestion is that you focus on the 'here and now' of everyday life and don't get stuck on the past dwelling on bad things.  Your body might be in the present but your mind is reliving a bad experience.  As for the future, put a DAILY list of goals that are not to difficult to complete, like gas the car up, do a load of laundry, keep a postitive mental attitude at work.  But don't load your mind up with stuff three weeks out and then stress for three weeks.  If the 'here and know' is dismal and you don't like what your doing, try to practice acceptance.  Just say to yourself, like it or not I have to do this so I better just accept it and use the completion of the task as a source of positive influence.  Believe me, I do electrical work and have installed about 3 to 4 HUNDRED THOUSAND wall outlets and switches.  You think thats not tedious?  I listen to music and just focus on doing the best job I can. Sometimes I miss my Dad, but I recollect the GOOD times and feel better. Can you hear me?<br>  Best of luck!|`|GEfUTyi8aa	This is a mindset and YOU have control of it.<br>  <br>  Regardless of circumstances, we all have the ability to not feel this way.<br>  <br>  I do the things that put a smile on my face... like play hockey... I can be having a horrible day but once I am out on the ice... its all smiles... I love the sport.   Sometimes I just play mindless Xbox.... to get my mind off things....   and if I cant shake a bad feeling, I look at others worse situations i.e. kids who are dying of cancer while their parents look on helplessly........ people who have lost their homes.. and are living in shelters ......  so many people have it worse and get through it..... <br>  <br>  I look forward to every day... I live each day one day at a time.... there is no point thinking long term, we never know what that will hold... so its best to take it one day at a time.  So.... I look forward to the sun rising the next day... seeing the smiles on my five year olds face.... the purr of my cat..... I even enjoy the fish getting excited when they see me enter the room (they know its food time).    Then when I walk out the door I breath in the air.... see the sun... and the ocean while I am driving and I think...wow.... I am lucky to see this... I have sight.... I have smell... I can walk to my car..... all these little things we take for granted that many cannot have or do.  If you really want to realize how good you have it.. volunteer at shelters, handicapped places....like for kids... or young adults..... blind organizations... it wont take long to realize how fortunate you are.... and the opportunities you have the others dont.<br>  <br>  Make goals for yourself.  too many people want things here and now (gen Y)... work for things... save... go on safaris... back pack Europe, go work in Australia for a year...... climb everest when yoru 30...... have a goal in mind and work towards it.   So.... go to University first.... get a career that you will enjoy (get tested by psychologists to see what is a good fit for you).... then when your done, do a year of back packing.... even if your already an adult, its never too late to set these kinds of goals.   Dont be having any family of your own until you realize what life has to offer you...... having a spouse with children when your depressed makes it double hard to get yourself back on track... not impossible but if you dont have these things, dont get them until you get yourself into high gear.<br>  <br>  Some days life just feels like a chore... but its temporary.... get outside.... and see your world... like really see it... dont go through life mindlessly feeling bad..... see what is out there for real..... even stop and smell a flower.... I know cliche but so true.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	I have felt the same way before.  I got into counseling.  It helped.

AA11658197	a man with greater income has better opportunity to attract women he desires while a poor man has less to work with  Same goes for attractive women, they have more to work with since they are more likely to be hit on by men both rich and poor.|`|oFR4yvHaaa	It depends.    Money will not make a man more sexually attractive to a woman. However, it will make it easier for him to find a woman who wants to marry him OR just show off and get pampered.     If a woman is looking for excitement and romance. She is not necessarily looking for Mr. Money bag. HOWEVER, if she is looking to settle down, have kids and live a safe, comfortable secure life.. Mr. Money bag becomes Irresistable.    Why is this? LAZINESS.|`|mCAWxobNaa	Certainly.  Men with considerable wealth will always be able to get the highest quality of women (ideally ages 20 to 24).    Consider any wealthy septuagenarian.  He will rarely date unattractive, old women and will stick with the best women possible.|`|ZjCurM7saa	Enough said: http://l.yimg.com/img.movies.yahoo.com/y...|`|A71Uu05Uaa	Yes, very much so.    Takes money to have a hot woman on your arm.  At least, on average.  There are, of course, exceptions.      Many women are more concerned with social status, avarice and being pampered than having a good man and developing a deep connection.  (Most good looking women)    Less attractive women generally accept that they aren't going to get a man to pay her way.  At least, not a rich man when he could have a much better looking woman.|`|875b8a67d51aea3c2aba301f8e93dbe2aa	Of course. Studies even say they enjoy sex more with a a man who has a higher income than with just the average male.|`|0QG6L9ZRaa	yeah, look at donald trump.      i have also seen on award shows and such that there are plenty of older, male famous celebrities that are with young models.|`|kxanAkXxaa	Most of the time yeah, but I do know a rich guy who is married to a real moose!|`|AA11100518	yes, many women subconsciously seek security.  it's a basic human need.  much easier really to fall in love with a guy in cancun than in the backseat of his car.  we want someone who can provide for our children.  neither is true though, it is just that a man's social status, money and power are part of who he his, part of his attractiveness.  you may not have considered this part, but HOW much money a man has is tied to his success.  in other words if a man is 30 and lives with his parents and works at burger king, i don't want him  i want someone more ambitious.  i'm not deciding on the basis of money - i'm deciding on teh basis of character and motivation (which leads to money).  if a guy is 30 and struggling but working hard, went to school, started a business or working his way up, then i'm more interested in someone like that.  money isn't a coincidence.  it's a result of how you live your life and it shows your values.  so she is deciding based on the values that are evident in his life.  a guy whose values are to live with parents and not work - well fewer women will find that attractive.  but it's not the $$ itself, again, it's the person underneath who decides how to live his life.  some decisions lead to financial comfort, others do not.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	"Now matter how rich a girl is, a guy can't justify that she's 'Mrs. Right'. A hot girl who works at Burger King would attract him much more than an older unattractive heiress."    Of course, because most men don't want a rich woman.  They want to feel as if they're above her in some way.  Do you think Donald Trump would ever date a woman who was a millionaire or billionaire in her own right?  He dates and marries these empty-headed morons so he can feel good about himself.    I like how under 33=attractive.  Way to diss 34-year-olds.|`|KfG4cv6Yaa	Slot the word 'physical' in before the word 'attractiveness' and you might well have a correlation.|`|62ZBofvPaa	Having more money, steady job, etc. means more people are willing to make a commitment, means you have a greater chance of meeting someone good looking.    Women do decide consciously that some guys (the brokest living off their parents guys), even though they are good-looking, they are broke and going nowhere with their lives and they don't want to support a deadbeat.  It's not opportunistic, it's being practical and logical and thinking with your head instead of your clit.|`|BPoZPvGoaa	yes, based on one of humans basic instinct which is greed(hoard).    Of course there are exceptions, especially people that are brought up by stricter religions, prouder heritage and etc...     There is a lot of other factors as to what riches mean in any society.  One thing pretty much sure of is that you will have to work a lot less by paying other people to do the chores for you.    If the society favors women instead of men in all aspects, you would see the opposite happens where male would be looking for powerful and rich females.  Just think back if money is not a factor(where there is no money).  The only mean of surviving is finding food.  You would choose to be with a person that can provide more than enough meals to take care of family and communities over the ones that don't.|`|wkjncmHTaa	Maybe where you live. Pretty much all the couples I know are about the same attractiveness, age and earning power.

jBigEy0Caa	For some people life is very hard.  For me, life isn't very hard, but I am still young and have a long way to go.  Now the older you get your chances increase for something medically going wrong and I think that is when people lose it.  I have someone very close to me that back in her day (which she is not very old now) she was so active and spunky.  Over the past few years she now needs a knee replacement, has broken her elbow (has no strength in her left arm), and she need her rotator cuff repaired (other arm left side).  She is miserable and cannot even sleep at night.  This carries over to the people she loves and cares about the most.  I have an cousin who has turned to drugs and my uncle has physically deteriorated ever since he's been dealing with his son's problems.  So you can't say life is easy because for some of us it's just not.  There are some things that no matter how well you handle them, they still get to you.  We are all human and one can only take so much.|`|l6mKwFb7aa	Some just pretend to be dysfunctional to get attention.

6296beaabcf8f4682bfa047d500f8e9aaa	Not really, you have to live in that culture to understand the taboo, e.g.<br>  <br>  The west regards forcing women to wear a burka as a breach of a womans rights, but at the same time forces women to cover up their top half while allowing men to go bare topped.  A tribe in the Amazon would consider our taboo on topless women to be crazy as they allow women to go topless and can't see any problem with it.<br>  <br>  Most taboos come from the society that they exist within but some come from the interpretations of old books.  These interpretations change over time, usually becoming more liberal but not always.|`|trMsK86jaa	You mean like not talking louder than a member of a higher social caste if you're indian?<br>  <br>  yes.|`|8Lc9d7TTaa	Of course, anthropologist understand everything there is to know about Taboo.<br>  You should watch the television program on national geographic name Taboo and,wow, the anthropologist understand every taboo on there.|`|7fa0FWu2aa	YES: WITH DIFFICULTY, BECAUSE YOUR FIRST LANGUAGE IS ENGLISH, AND THAT IS THE STRUCTURE OF YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, THERE IS A DEEP STRUCTURE TO LANGUAGE WHICH RELATES TO THE ABILITY TO TRANSLATE, AND SEMANTICS.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	One can understand if they are willing to accept otherwise foreign concepts.

adQWVOeAaa	I truly don't know what to think.<br>  <br>  With the universe being so grand, I would have to imagine there is SOMEWHERE. When you put it into perspective... We live in a galaxy that spands almost 100,000 light years... and the closest galaxy to us is the Andromeda Galaxy over 2 million light years away from us. Not just that, but there are BILLIONS of galaxies. I believe just by the pure size of our universe, we cannot possibly be the only form of life.<br>  <br>  However, I do not fear alien abductions or anything like that. The way I see it, if there is a species in our universe with the technology to find US... then we are so insignificant to them that there is no reason for them to bother us.|`|G0dJty9Paa	yes, and there is even a large possibility that mars supports life too with endolithic plants<br>  <br>  these plants survive inside of cracks and pores of rocks, require no sunlight to live, and have been found as deep as almost 10,000 feet below the earth's surface<br>  <br>  the only limiting factor that scientists have been able to find os temperatures being too high|`|il36RWQDaa	Yes I do, but intelligent life I believe is far less likely to be found. Not that I think it doesn't exist. I just think that it is 1 in a trillion that the life will have evolved into a higher form of intelligence.|`|mb2eeqhfaa	yes i do. they always say earth is a two planet species. and i do believe our other planet is out there. i also think there is many other universes just like ours.|`|dJgOyDooaa	Statistically there is a greater than zero chance, because we exist.  I agree that intelligent life is harder to come by, only because life at a basic level is quite hardy and adaptive (look at all the different species on our planet) but to evolve to intelligence takes a long time.  Space is dangerous (just ask the dinosaurs) and the chance of a species being wiped out before acquiring intelligence is probably pretty high.  Just think if the dinosaurs weren't wiped out 65 million years ago, could they have beaten us to intelligence?  If birds are the modern decendents of them, they are relatively smart animals and it isn't so impossible to see them ruling the world if we hadn't come along...|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	I would guess millions of planets with higher lifeforms in this galaxy alone.  There would be at least billions with life equivalent to bacteria.  People who think about all the unlikely things that made Earth so perfect generally don't realize that the Earth isn't perfect for us, we evolved to perfectly fit the conditions on the Earth.  Anything that could support liquid water could probably support some kind of life.  Intelligent life probably usually evolves but it took us about 3.5 billion years..|`|wQpdot1Raa	I like to believe there's at least one other planet exactly like ours out there, and that they two are in credit crisis and stuffs.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	I don't see why not.

WlLcttM2aa	Probably the same thing that influences a man's take. Your family's opinions, your friends' opinions, things you read, the media, what you learn in school, location. Life experience.<br>  <br>  And yes it can change pretty drastically over time. Say someone gets involved in religion, christianity for example, after years of not believing in any god or anything. Their morals and principles and etiquette can change quite a bit.<br>  <br>  Or, say someone moves somewhere different and has to get a whole new group of friends, and this group acts totally different and thinks different things are fun than the first group of friends, and since you're spending time with them, you adopt some of their values. <br>  <br>  There's a lot of reasons why it could change, these are just two.|`|AA11544192	I think morals and principles are influenced a lot by biology.  We are part of the biology of our planet.  Males of all species are wired to spread the DNA around, it keeps the gene pool healthier, but females are generally wired to be a lot more selective about the reproductive act because they will be raising the offspring, so they select for various attributes in the males they consider for partnering with.  It can be as simple as strength, for protection, or a stable work history, for a stable environment to raise the children.  <br>  <br>  Etiquette seems to be almost entirely a social norm.  A lot of morals and principles are, too--passed on from parent to child, or among girls, but etiquette much more so.  Its interesting when you travel to different countries to see how arbitrary etiquette--polite manners, etc--are.  Whats OK in one country, isn't in another.  Yet on morals and principles, there's almost a universality, which does imply a universal biological influence.|`|uy6sBhipaa	The Universal Absolute Law of the Known Universe is thus; "Good kids come from good mothers, bad kids ....."

Teens who took AO ended up with the same percentage of pregnancies as the other groups, as Bristol Palin could  demonstrate.

What is the point, men were already men, and women were already women.

It's not going to happen.|`|xsyAljhaaa	It's the feminists like her that are the real problem. Radical professors and feminist politicians, this includes the Joe Bidens of the world also.

So what, you found a male supremacist's website. If you even are male, which I doubt, you will find out why the men's rights movement exists if you ever are in a relationship with a woman, or ever get divorced. We'll see how cavalier you are when you get your house stolen from you, your civil rights trampled upon, imprisoned on the word of woman, sentenced without evidence or a real trial, and you have to pay a huge portion of your salary to "child support" without ever being able to see your children again. VAWA is being used against women illegally now too, so don't think you are exempt.|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	Notice that Prof Daly lamented that "People are afraid to say that kind of stuff anymore". Damn right they should be too! Note however that this old crank still has her job and is still in a position of power and influence over young peoples' minds. If those words were spoken by just some lonely cat- jeweler then this wouldn't really matter, but when you see words like this coming from feminists in top jobs, well that is a very different matter.<br>  <br>  @ Zach: Please list for me the number of MRAs in government, law, adademia, and the media. For every one of them - if you can find even one - I will give you 10 feminists.|`|AgSKIdklaa	Yes these radical feminists are irrational people, but there are MRA's exactly the same <a href="http://www.menarebetterthanwomen.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.menarebetterthanwomen.com/</a><br>  <br>  Don't be too quick to cast the first stone, no person is innocent; no group is 100% unbiased.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Yudel We don’t have VAWA over here and it will never happen! “If you even are male, which I doubt” you think by playing that game of calling me a girl hurts me?

I just can’t see how you can be for one but against the other; that is what I can not understand!
mCAWxobNaa	Because it's the so-called radicals that built the ship, made the rules and command it.  The "mainstream" Feminist are simply taught to scurry about pretending that Radicals are only 1 component, when in fact, they dictate everything that the movement stands for.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	The feminist movement as a whole can't do anything beyond promoting certain people who are gunning for positions of power. Lately I have only seen this done for Hilda Solis, presumptive U.S. Labor Secretary. Before anyone asks, I have never seen it done for Harriet Harman.|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	What amazes me is why some women say 'I'm a feminist' despite the fact that they have nothing in common with what the feminist movement has been doing for 40 years. Its like a German guy say 'I'm a nazi' and expecting you think think he is referring to the National Socialist movement before Hitler took over. <br>  <br>  Some who call themselves feminists are haters, other are in denial about the movement, and some are just naive i.e. simply presume feminism does what it says it does.<br>  <br>  Notice however that men who are critical of feminism don't make the same error. Somehow its obvious to us that there are men who are critical of feminism and then there are MRAs.

My husband and I used the Spencer Spaning Plan for a while.  That called for husband and wife to agree on rules of behavior.  For rule violations, wives were to be spanked and husbands were to be whipped.

YQOT68xFaa	If you pick the right woman, and both of you actually work on the relationship (and this will be obvious before marriage so pay attention!! if you are always the one to apologize or make the first move, and you can't please her, DO NOT marry her), then there is no reason to fear marrying her. Marriage is good; it is a higher level of commitment; and it is by far the best environment in which to raise your kids. And yes, it requires trust. You are basically putting your heart, and your life to an extent, in the other person's hands. So pick wisely. A happy marriage is like a slice of heaven here on earth. An unhappy one is hell. <br>  <br>  As for time and money driving a marriage apart, that is entirely up to the couple and the priorities they choose to have, and how they choose to deal with their stress. If their relationship and family is priority, then there won't be such an obsession with ladder-climbing and working overtime. If they choose to deal with their stress constructively - taking up a physical activity or a new hobby, for example - then there won't be so many bitter fights and angry words. The husband and wife choose how they treat one another. Nobody has to be driven apart by stress or financial difficulty. If you play your cards right those things can bring you together.<br>  <br>  <br>  That said.....I just read that she aborted your baby even though she knew you wanted to keep it. That's rather heartless. Honestly? If she is that kind of person I would advise against marrying her. Also, I'd take it as a sign that the two of you are maybe not that well suited for marrying one another. Abortion is not a small issue; it's important for both of you to agree on it or this kind of thing can happen. Anyways, I wouldn't marry her. After something like that I'd be surprised if any man in your situation would. I'm sorry for your loss.|`|wkjncmHTaa	You shouldn't. You should stay single as you're obviously not suited for marriage.<br>  <br>  And it's 'lose' not 'loose'.|`|7LSonIoraa	i agree with Eoghan.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	Well you have every right to be worried! as you already have a Divorce planned!  or at least in the back of your mind! <br>  If you want your marriage to be a business deal main consirns are money then don't get mairred!  <br>  <br>  if you want a marriage that is focused on <br>  Trust, Communication, and Passion... with no  underlining thoughts of Divorce then it most likely will work out well! <br>  <br>  the only issues is when you get in a fight or something don't go either you way or her way will it end it? if so you both are weak people! and NEITHER of you should wed! <br>  <br>  Marriage is FAR from simple!  it takes a lot of work passion and deication to just maintain it!  when something goes chances are so does the realationship! <br>  <br>  I personally think you should skip the wedding thoughts and just have a live in girlfriend many people do that! but you need to ensure your partner is willing to play that partner roll! and frankly i don't see it when you wanted her to keep the baby and she didn't want to! <br>  if you were married that most likely would of ended you both!  <br>  odd how one little peice of paper can change thigns!  if you let it!|`|AA10520442	The bottom line is that you must know someone quite well before you marry them.  Too many people either rush into marriage or don't make the effort to know the person before they tie the knot.<br>  <br>  Another factor is that many people are too willing to throw in the towel when the going gets tough.  Let's face it.  Life is tough.  It takes its toll on all of us.  If two people can't weather life's storms together they don't have much.<br>  <br>  You must know the other person's beliefs and values and that they are compatible with your own.<br>  You must know how they react emotionally in given situations and whether or not they are  emotionally mature ( big one! ).<br>  You must be able to think of yourself as married to that person before you ever reach the altar. I think people expect that the altar will magically change things somehow.  It doesn't.  You are still the same two people after the altar as you were before.<br>  Above all, when you know that you are a better person for being with that other person than without, you know you are ready to be married.|`|qPlx1Ejhaa	Its interesting isn't it - the biggest cause of divorce is money. i.e. she's spending while he's working like a slave. So much for love eh?<br>  I'm 40, let me give you some advice. Marriage is OK, but you are far more likely to succeed with a more traditionally minded women, than your typical western girl with her entitlement mentality. So save yourself a lot of trouble and look for foreign born women, especially those from Asia.|`|58iM890jaa	Well, I didn't quite read it all (l skipped around quite a bit).

Socialised out of existence, you are better off just residing to the fact.<br>  <br>  Half of all marriages end in divorce, divorced men are x6 more likely to kill themselves so.... marriage is literally tossing a coin for your mental health.<br>  <br>  And if women are mocking you because you are upset, here or anywhere ....  you say "ok then we just don't get married and let the institution die out", the laughter usually stops.|`|NLEmQZSsaa	I have been married for almost 19 years.  I'm sorry about the decision your girlfriend made about the unexpected pregnancy.  It is her own body so to the law states.  But my question to you is, why would you still be with this girl who did not consider you in her decision.? If she loves you and saw a future with you then she would have included your feelings in her decision.  People don't get married with the thought of whats going to happen if I get divorced?  Will I get my kids, house car or will she/he get them?  People get married because they want to spend their LIVES together, their entire lives. Your right when you said no one tries anymore when it comes to marriage.  They don't and mostly because they go into it with the mindset of "if it doesn't work out I can always get a divorce."  If a couple can make it past the 7 yr mark then they can make it past the rest of the bumps.  If you honestly feel that men get the short end of the stick in a divorce so why get married then you're no better than the people you were talking about when you said "no one tries anymore."  No one loses their house, the car and the kids unless they want to lose them.  But you gotta want to be married to stay married. You're right its hard work. Its like a whole other job, and then when you have a child, you have another job.  Plus the job that actually gives you a paycheck.  So if you don't want to work hard stay single.|`|XIbct4fuaa	If you dont want to get married, if you are afraid of it, then dont get married.  Find a woman who is like minded on the subject of marriage and settle down with her.  Or just never settle down at all.  But if you want to have children someday I warn you that children tie you to a person for the rest of your life.  Even if you were never married.  You didnt say...did your girlfriend end up having the baby?|`|ZYp1AEspaa	If you and your girlfriend decide to contemplate marriage it would be a really good idea to talk all this out together. It sounds like you are quite concerned about the marriage lasting, so maybe it would put your mind at rest somewhat to have a prenuptial agreement covering issues such as money, children, their education and upbringing, and in the event of dissatisfaction for both parties to agree to a specified amount of counselling, etc.<br>  <br>  But there are no guarantees. At the end of the day you make a commitment in hope, trust and love, and if you decide that risking  your current happiness isn't worth it, well, that's what you decide. <br>  <br>  You're in the driver's seat. You have some measure of control, but you have to choose your route and take what the road gives you.|`|kRTSVuywaa	Okay well for one, a marriage isn't always 50/50 there are times when it will be 20/80, 40/60 and so on...marriage takes work and it is hard. Every situation is different and you don't know all the facts that go on in someone else's relationship. It isnt enough just to love a person, you have to love them enough to know that you will be with that person for the rest of you life. Marriage and divorce are thrown around so much these days. People think nothing of getting a divorce. When there are children involved it makes things so much more complicated. As for your girlfriend having an abortion, i don't think it is fair for the woman to make that decision...it isnt just her child, there was you the father to consider and of course the child that lost a chance at a good life with you...whether your girlfriend wanted a part of that childs life was her decision, but it wasnt her decision to take that child away from you. If this is the person that you are considering marrying, than maybe you should reconsider...if she was able to take something like that away from you, than i dont think it is meant to be and you will resent her for that forever. <br>  <br>  And yes there are many cases where the child gets to stay with the mother as opposed to the father, i know both situations. My uncle got custody of his 2 boys after their divorce, he proved to be a better parent. My dad on the other hand was a complete jerk and there was no question when it came to custody. There are many situations that parents share custody 50/50 as long as you are a fit parent and you provide a safe and healthy enviornment for your child you have no problem.<br>  <br>  But when you chose to get married, you shouldnt go into your marriage with the mind set of...well what will i get to keep if we get divorced...if you are having marriage problems make the commitment early that you will seek couseling.
8d8ejHPfaa	In my own experiences, and things that I have read about other people's experiences with OBE's, the experience is often preceded by a feeling of bodily paralysis, sometimes by a feeling of vibration or shaking, and also that when unfamiliar to this state one has to learn how to move, just the same as one learns to walk in real life.  In the first OBE that I can remember having, I wasn't really motoring around too well, just kind of wound up on the stairwell of the tenement I was living in at the time, just kind of "bobbing" for lack of a better way of putting it :)  My favorite OBE was one time when I tripled, I was simultaneously aware of my physical body on the bed, my etheric body walking into the office I was working in at the time, and a third portion which had split off and hovered at a corner of the ceiling, observing my etheric body walking in surrounded by golden light.<br>  I think right now your goal is pretty much to just become more familiar with the state, and learn how to gain control of your movement, you're aware of this state, and developing awareness of how to move in it, as you become ready for more, you'll start to pursue more :)<br>  <br>  Edit: Hm...perhaps you could be trying too hard?  The way you describe it sounds like you are trying to think too hard in terms of "Ok, now I'm going to try to get my soul out..."  Maybe your head is in the way, it's not mental, it's experiential... When you get up in the morning, you don't say to yourself, "Ok, I'm going to throw the covers off now, I'm going to sit up now, I'm going to put my legs over the side and stand up now, it's more automatic than that. "Trying" is not "Doing", or "Being".  "My soul" is possessive, and your mind is getting in there holding on to it possibly causing it to be held back.  When you start to feel the vibrations that accompany this, and feel like you're ready to try further, instead of thinking "Ok, now I'm going to try this"  you could try simply thinking "up" and see what happens, or try simply picking a point in the room, lets say the doorway to your room, don't say, "Ok, now I'm going to go stand by the door" try simply focusing your attention on being by the door, as though you were standing there looking at your room, and see what happens :)<br>  When having to deal with a dental procedure, sometimes I like to go stand by the door of the examining room, and watch from there... I don't know if that qualifies as an OBE or disassociation, eh, whatever, gets me through the day...muhahaha :)<br>  <br>  BTW...I've never seen it myself, but many people who have OBEs' report that once out of their body they look back and see the etheric body connected to the physical body by a cord, sorta like being connected by an umbilical cord, I've heard it described specifically as a silver cord, I thought I would mention that just in case any of this has to do with any anxiety whether you could find your way back to the body once you're out.  The spirit only detaches from the body at death, and until then maintains connection to the body through the cord, or so I've been told...|`|AA11199260	Yes. I had such dreams. These dreams comes from our sub-conscious mind which were normally caused due to too much pressure on your mind. This pressure is repressed and you cannot ventilate your feelings.<br>  I do believe in hallucinations. The item is also discussed in Abnormal Psychology which explains that the subject sees the images without any external objects. It means that our inner eyes see the objective without any outside object.<br>  These dreams are out of your control as they occur due to sub-conscious mind which is outside our control.
AcgDcQG0aa	It's hard to say what the real value of gold is because it's mostly subjective.<br>  <br>  Gold isn't used that much for industrial purposes.  And the demand for gold jewelery is not that good now.  Many investors think that gold is money.  But gold hasn't been used as money for quite a few years now. You can't buy anything with gold.  You have to sell your gold first before you can buy anything.<br>  <br>  People don't really need gold for anything besides jewelry and some industrial applications.  Which means that most of gold's value is sentimental and subjective.  And value based on feelings is just as variable as the feelings are.

Of course my beliefs are based on my life...like if I believe something should be illegal, one of the reasons might be that I wouldn't want it to happen to me. Is that what you're getting at?<br>  <br>  Harriet

Add some drapes to it to make it more dark and private. Put stickers up under there to give them something to look at while they talk to you. <br>   Have a bent mirror so they can maybe envision themselves as big someday? <br>   Use a voice-changer program to change their voices lower to sound more grown-up.<br>   <br>   As for your other qu: I suppose there's no limit to the areas that group therapy can be used.

e88862626d5369dd487c7f4e8374547faa	For many, similar backgrounds and religious beliefs tend to help in the formation of a lasting bond between two individuals.<br>  <br>  However, those two aspects don't need to coincide at all.  In fact, in some cases, opposites are attracted to each other and form lasting relationships also.<br>  <br>  So, it depends on the personalities of both individuals.

n560blqraa	Well, let me start by saying I own my own business, it is a Home Remodeling Company. <br>  <br>  The Pros of owning a business, is I am my own boss. There is nobody hovering over my head to tell me what do do. <br>  <br>  Cons... However, it means not being able to work a 9-5 day, and never being able to leave your work behind at the office. This leads to work cutting into your personal time, constantly working weekends, and as a result can cause issues with your family.<br>  <br>  Pros.... are some great tax right offs that you don't get as being employed under someone. Must become LLC to receive benefits fully.<br>  <br>  Cons...filing taxes is a more tedious task and requires an accountant, and hence more money to the accountant for handling your taxes.<br>  <br>  Pros...I choose the people I work with, and hence surround myself with more qualified individuals who will pull their own weight.<br>  <br>  Cons...having qualified individuals requires better salaries, means more money and less profit to you. You must put their salaries above and beyond yourself, and very often delays you paying yourself and getting a paycheck. Especially with starting up a company has more overhead initially leading to sacrificing pay initially to start a business until you turn profit. Clearly cuts into profit margin.<br>  <br>  Pros...during profitable times, it can be great financially.<br>  <br>  Cons...You must always feed monies back to your business during your profitable time to bank money for a rainy day, and to increase the size of your business. Cuts into profit margin.<br>  <br>  Pros...never have to worry about being fired or laid off from a job.<br>  <br>  Cons...have to worry about lawsuits, hence picking up high cost insurance policy to protect your home and personal assetts from being attached in any lawsuit. This can lead to a company becoming insolvent.<br>  <br>  In end, personally speaking there is a lot more stress being independent, and as a result you run the risk of losing more personally and professionally speaking. It comes with high-risk!<br>  <br>  Lastly, you do not have company provided health insurance coverage as an independent, and hence pay more to pick up private insurance which is extremely costly for lesser qualty insurance.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!|`|q4tTabfjaa	Being employed means you get one boss, being self employed you think you are the one boss, but all your customers are and they can be horrible.|`|AA11199260	Merits.<br>  Self-employment provides freedom to work at ones will.<br>  The work can be done with small capital.<br>  Demerits.<br>  You cannot increase its scope as the capital is limited.<br>  You will have to localize the work at one place due to low capital and limited space.|`|LBAh1tPoaa	Well, when you feel like to telling the boss to go and get screwed - it would be a pleasure.

If you get sweaty feet, putting on a fresh pair of socks will help.  It will also save your shoes in the long run.  If you don't think you have sweaty feet, you're probably over-reacting.  If your friends know that you can't smell, they should let you know if your feet smell.

Hope you get yours sorted out.|`|533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	Did you even stop to read your question before you posted it?    Your actions and consequences are all self-determined (I stop clicking my heels and ankles when I decide it feels good) which means you fundamentally don't trust input from outside yourself, yet you want people to help you?    "I feel I can only help myself."    You don't just 'feel' that, you BELIEVE it, you ACCEPT it, you WORSHIP that thought. And you and your life revolve so completely around that self-determining loop (it only feels good when I say it feels good, but I don't know if it feels good, so I can't know if it feels good, so I have to keep doing it until it feels good, or until i am too tired to care about whether or not it feels good) that you paralyze yourself with it.    OCD is kinda like having a 24/7 delusion. What the sufferer feels isn't necessarily true and 'real' (in the objective sense of the word) and so it is very difficult for the sufferer to be programmed from outside of themselves (a person won't stop seeing pink bunnies until you break the cycle and get them to see that what they are seeing isn't actually in tune with everyone else.) The problem with this is that because the OCD sufferer basically says "I am the only determiner", it takes a long long time for them to allow outside, professional advice to seep into their consciousness.    I can't make you change your mind about clicking your ankles because you don't believe what I believe and actually don't want to believe it (if you did, you wouldn't click your ankles.) Even when you try to make yourself stop, you really aren't the one trying to stop. You stop because you think you 'should' stop, but you also believe that you need to continue. You can't believe it is both night and day at the same time: that means the 'should stop' idea came from someone else, and because that idea is being interpreted in your mind as being unreliable, the more you try to accomodate that idea, the more insecure you become, which means the stronger your OCD becomes.    OCD sufferers try to 'buck' their disease, but that's like a person with no legs trying to play basketball without a wheelchair. The more you think you shouldn't be who you are, the longer your OCD will be with you. Get knee pads (to keep your kneecaps from cracking due to the repeated and prolonged clicks you will be doing) and better coping rituals (try to do all your clicks before you leave your comfort zone, since it will be harder to do it outside, making you feel more helpless in the process) and see how that affects it.

Eoghan:  I've been a RAINN volunteer for three years, and I can tell you that there is a serious movement in the legal, psychiatric, and female survivor communities to undo the stigma and downplaying of male abuse.

I'd like to alleviate that loneliness.|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	Yeah I think its all either feminism or masculinism (feminists call it anti-feminism) these days.     Let's see:    Why do people have more compassion for women than men? I have to answer, because feminism makes people distrust men and love women. It's the compassion gap. It's feminist inspired.    Why is insulting women sexist and insulting men OK? The compassion gap. Feminist inspired.    Why is insulting women's bodies sexist and insulting men's bodies OK? The compassion gap. Feminist inspired.    Why do women, even total losers, always getting custody and child support? Ditto.    How come when my friends wife attacks him and gouges his eyes and seperates his shoulder and scratches him all up, or another friend whose girlfriend tries to rape him with a baseball bat as he sleeps, and the cops come...they always arrest the man and put HIM in jail? Ditto.    How come when I'm applying for a job I always see the bold letters that WOMEN AND MINORITIES are encouraged to appy (I guess they are not encouraging me to apply)? Ditto.    How come when I take the bus in Toronto they will stop in between stopes for WOMEN only so that they don't have to walk at night? Ditto.    How come my government will give large cheques to FEMALE entrepreneurs and inventors? Ditto.    How come my government spends 10 times as much money on female health issues as men's health? Ditto?    How come since the 1920s women have gained 10% extra life expectancy from when it was equal? (see above)    How come since the 1970s the suicide rate for males has become 5 times that as for females from when it was equal?     How come I am forced to take Discrimination workshops every year at work and it's just a bunch of women blah blahing about women all day and getting paid by the stupid government?    Why does television always portrays women as righteous but only men as stupid or deviant?|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Paternity fraud really boils my blood (as it does any man). I have'nt been the victim of this disgusting behaviour, but the potential for it is ever present... (not nice to assume the worst, but equally, all men are 'potential' rapists - remember?)    False allegations are also a huge problem - again, I've not personally encountered this (aside from typical children's lies that all kids tell "he did it, not me"  - "no, she did it, not me..." etc.) but once more - the potential is always there... all it takes is one bad mood, and boom - your life as a man ends... even when proven innocent.|`|KfG4cv6Yaa	I suppose the psychosexual issues of desire, arousal and 'love' are inherently different in the genders, and so perhaps oughtn't really be issues of feminism.  And they, frankly, are fascinating.  If I understood these...    Of course, the manifestations of these in any individual will always be, indirectly or more directly, a product of their current (patriachal) society, and thus can be treated to some degree at least as feminism issues.    EDIT:  Obviously you can also add 'sex' and 'orgasm' to the above list.  These are massively different for men and for women, and that is a fascinating, if insoluble, concept.|`|FL67UPPHaa	My main interest is the causes of gender difference, both between the genders and within them, and the roles played by socialisation and biology. I like looking at gender in relation to evolutionary theories and thinking about how relevant they are today.    I  think this is separate to feminism, because to me equal rights can exist no matter whether gender roles are seen to be innate, socialised or some combination of both.    I've always been interested in the ways men and women use language and how the perceptions of men and women in each time period are demonstrated through langauge. I like studying women's roles throughtout history, ironically something which is overlooked or downplayed by both male-dominated societies and feminist ones.    The only issue directly related to gender that really concerns me is support for pregnant women and single mothers. In such a sexually progressive society is seems wrong that pregnancy is looked down on and mothers are left to struggle and raise their children in poverty.    The other issues I feel strongly about like violence, gay rights etc. I see as humanitarian concerns rather than being gender-based.    Feminism has a lot of influence, but I think there's more to studying gender than just the feminist vs. anti-feminist squabbling!|`|PINYISpMaa	What to call the female tingly parts so you can talk about them in public.

(Suspended in gaffa, the lack of awareness about female abusers and services for male victims is directly related to feminism and its cover ups/propaganda/misinformation).  http://www.ejfi.org/DV/dv-5.htm pgfId-15...        AmandaMaria, I think the overwhealming majority of mens and childrens righs issues in the west are routed on feminisms quest for special rights and the upperhand.      What I would like to see is control of monetary policy/printing taken from the bankers, an end to the boom bust cycle and all but nonexistant inflation.      edit, Suspended in Gaffa, to some extent but there was a stigma there for female victims once too.  The fact its that awareness was created selectivly, certain abusers and victims were brushed under that carpet and others were put in the spotlight in order to shame all men and monopolise funding. . Its all to easy to follow the code and blame everything negative on mascilinity but we know how corrupt the dv and abuse industries are. We know the kind of bigots that control these "services". Childrens rights groups do too.    Im not "pointing the finger", its fact, the erin prizzy story is well documented. There is no gender neutral launguage from feminists re abuse.

Suicide leaves people feeling terribly guilty for being so helpless and for not being able to prevent it, and you have every right to feel angry sometimes. A relative of mine lost someone close to him in this way and he felt very angry for a long time. Please don't feel that you have to suppress your feelings, it may help to talk to someone who can help you, maybe a counselling service? You might find that being able to let your anger out to someone who understands will help you to let it go. You have my sympathies, I hope you learn to come to terms with this.
QQQ36jMOaa	I don't think having multiple spouses is a healthy relationship and thus why I'm against it.  In that sort of situation, the two spouses are always getting unfair or unequal treatment than the single sex in the marriage.    You have to remember that polygamy does NOT mean one husband and multiple wives.  Polygamy simply means having multiple partners in a marriage.  There is polygyny (multiple wives) but also polyandry (multiple husbands).  So yes, there are societies that have had multiple husbands.    As a woman with an extremely high sex drive, I could see the benefit of multiple husbands ;)  Plus they could help with the children and house and around the house :)  But I also recognize that its not a fair relationship to the men--they would have to divide my time and attention which is unfair and unequal.  I don't think it would be a beneficial relationship to anyone emotionally, women or men.|`|gNHHGFNMaa	I have always supported this idea. Why is it even forbidden by law?    And I am a guy and a gender equalist.|`|ZsxbOXtzaa	You asked the feminists, but I must comment. Plural marriage is logical and reasonable on many levels.The only problem with 2 or more husbands, would be egos,and or favoritism. But then that's the problem   with one on one too. One household, three incomes, duties spread three ways, sounds almost utopian.     I can imagine several scenarios that would make such an arrangement desirable. Imagine a truck driver, with somebody to keep the wife happy while he's away, and still have her when he got home. Someone with low sex drive, would complement a horny co-hubby.    Nah, couldn't work in the USA. Too many egos, and pre conceived ideas, and too many narrow minds.|`|un0C52G8aa	It sounds like a great idea for the man because he gets to have sex with a different woman every night.

They kinda stand out.    Anyway, my views are based 100% on what I've seen here. The polygamist women in Utah don't have a choice. They were raised from the time they were born that it's the way it should be and they're often times treated more like property than wives. So under those circumstances I'm against it. Never really gave much thought about "consensual" polygamy, so I'm not comfortable commenting on it..|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I think it's because it's a normal part of their culture for a lot of people.

Polyandry I don't really like either but I guess I could handle that a bit better...lol.

7h5zhoJqaa	Well, let's look at the options here.    Either way, you'll be fed, boarded, and clothed.  In your current living situation if you don't get caught, but it's much more likely that you'd soon be living on the state dime in prison.  That is if you don't get shot.  Many truck drivers are armed.  I know I would be if I were traveling with possibly millions of dollars of payload by myself for long distances.    You may be smart, although I question that by the stupidity of your decision to ask this question on an Internet board.  Haven't you ever watched forensics shows on Discovery?  And how smart are the people you'd be working with?  The more people involved, the higher the risk of getting caught, and if you're the mastermind, you can bet your *** they'll roll on you if they're ever caught.      Adding people tacks on the charge of conspiracy - additional time.  Cross state lines, and it's a federal offense.  Sell the gear on eBay, and you're also going to Leavenworth for quite a while for the additional charges of mail fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering.    People don't usually step into high level theft of tractor trailers or anything else on their own, AND get away with it.  You either have to be Mensa smart to figure out how to do it without getting caught - and you only get one chance to develop a bulletproof plan.  Or you get involved through organized crime, where those involved are trained by professional criminals, and they still get involved understanding they're entering the world of professional crime where they'll very likely spend time in prison during their life, with protection and financial support inside and outside from the crime syndicate.    Oh, and that would be another real downside.  A 21-year-old kid in prison?  How do you feel about the name Fresh Meat?    Just get a job, man.  If good jobs aren't available in your area, move.  You're 21-years-old and considering crime - you obviously don't have any serious ties to your current home.  There are good jobs to be had out there.    Or join the military.  If you have a brain, you'll have your choice of a ton of job options and great training in the Air Force or Navy where there's little likelihood of going into combat.  Army or Marines if you want to be in the middle of the action.

Y5jiOlAUaa	Depends how it's impacting on your health and well being.  If you can keep yourself, and your human needs satisfied then it's perfectly fine to not be too much a part of it, if it's overwhelming you so much then that is fair enough. A lot of people are like that and they live better with less pressure and involvement with the masses.  It's a lot to expect people to do well at school and get a job and place of your own, with a hostile environment and lack of understanding.   It's conditioning no?  People are always encouraged to take a certain route in life, but it doesn't always work out that way, lots of factors get in the way, that sometimes the rules don't allow for.   Give yourself some time and reflect on it, see how you go, but seek some reliable support and advice, for the long term.

Modern communications have enabled companies to put work in other countries where the labor costs are lower and the products made can be easily shipped to where consumers are.

Granted, the U.S. worker might be grossly overpaid, but  there's two things going on:    1.   China is using unfair labor policies compared to the U.S. - in effect, it's the return of slavery (strong language, but basically true).    2.   Because factories typically make more than one good, China is artificially flooding the market with commodity goods, and therefore reducing the industrial capacity of the world - in effect, shoving their stuff down our throat because we have no choice but to buy their stuff because that's all retailers can afford, because of domestic price-pressures due to unemployment.    There are cases where trade protectionism didn't work - Japan comes to mind.  But there is a middle ground - agreement between trading countries, rather than just "Free trade" -     Economic advantage will ultimately be skewed to the country with a billion workers that have a gun pointed at their head, willing to work for free or be shot.|`|7h5zhoJqaa	Globalization, in terms of economics, is the movement toward a global economy free of trade barriers - a worldwide free market of goods, services, capital and labor.

aL4UoRdTaa	Nickipet is correct.    When your mind doesn't deal with issues your body will display physical reactions.  This is very typical of people who have anxiety and panic attacks and is not uncommon at all.  What it really means is that there is some internal emotional psychological issue that needs dealt with. To deal with just the physical symptoms there are a couple methods.  You can listen to music or read jokes.  You can also rub your feet or rub them on the ground.  These things kinda bring you to the here and now.  Don't focus on the physical symptoms as this will sometimes make them worse.  If you are into herbs you can buy something called "Rescue Remedy".  It is in alternative food stores, organic food stores, and herbal stores.  Also online.  It is quite cheap and is made from flower essences.|`|YW74O9aNaa	I don't think its abnormal.. when you are even a little nervous your face is flushed , you start sweating etc etc.. and it happens to many many people. And it doesn't mean you have any mental problem :) unless of course you feel so almost all the time even for very non-important occasions.     I used to have red flushed face at interviews .. diarrhea during exam time.. And what worked for me was thinking about the worst case scenario.   Like this... okay, so if i do fail this exam? whats going to happen.. me, my parents will be disappointed, but we know that i did study , and my parents love me and trust me that i'll succeed the next time.   What if i fail this interview? no gain no loss! so stop worrying about it. So i should try and do my best and see what happens.  And this trick always works for me. :) It calms my mid down and the body follows suit.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I did.  Actually have diarrhea when it came time for pre-calculus.  All an emotionally-driven physical ailment.  I did fine in pre-cal in college, just I was afraid of the teacher in HS.    Why are you nervous with your counselor?  That kinda defeats the purpose of counselling--if you can't relax and say what you mean.    These days, if I get too nervous I take a pill.  Or I meditate.  Very easy to do with big results.  E-mail me for more info.    Everything eventually comes to an end.  This problem will, too.

QbJ04Zqiaa	Smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee make alot of people, myself included, feel relaxed. Just because someone smokes doesn't mean they're definitely going to get cancer.

Leave her alone, she'll be fine.|`|hR1cZhJBaa	Only she can change for herself... <br>  get some leaflets on the latest drug, where it literally inhibits the need for smoking. <br>  Google it... its a tablet.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	The only one who can help her is herself.

Most non-smokers don't realize that those stupid commercials that try to guilt trip you, and the "friendly advice" people give, actually make matters worse rather than better.  A smoker knows that it's bad for them...they know that it's bad for the people around them...they don't need to hear that they're giving the people they love a greater risk of cancer...or raising their own risks.  That's what's infuriating about those "Truth.org" commercials.  Yes, they are designed to try to keep teens from starting up.  But by doing it in a way that belittles current smokers, they're only adding to the problem.<br>  <br>  Studies have been done that prove that the addiction to nicotene is just as strong as the addiction to heroine, which is what makes it so hard for a lot of people to quit.  Those who say "Oh, I just didn't like the way my teeth looked" or "I put the pack in the trash and never looked back.  It's not hard to quit!" simply weren't as susceptible to addiction as others.<br>  <br>  There is nothing you can do.  If she wants to quit, she'll do what she has to to quit.  But she has to make the decision for herself.  All you can do is wait, and give her your love and support if she decides to quit.|`|2zOSXL4yaa	First off theres no ill effects to dirnking coffee, secondly she is not becoming paranoid when you tell her to stop she just doesnt like being told what she should or should'nt do.<br>  try talking to her without sound like your preaching say your worried about her health without quoting statistics about how many people die from doing what per year.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	You're right - there is nothing you can do.

Then after I got pregnant and had the baby I got so used to being relaxed I now don't do it anymore.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	I do it a lot, yep. It's something I've done for so long now that I don't really even notice it most of the time.     When I'm sitting, I don't do it, or when I'm working out, I don't do it.     Working out makes sense, but why not sitting, yanno?    No idea. Either way, I'm told it's a bad habit because you're not breathing properly when you do it. So, I try and break myself, but I do it anyhow. I've totally trained myself into it.     Between that and the smoking, I've got a lot of work to do, unfortunately =o/     Most of the women I know do this though, I think we started because we were self conscious about our bodies, and we were so young when we did it we just ended up doing it involuntarily almost.     When you look at kids, they tend to have big tummies, they do the whole "tummy breathing", which is healthiest, so it makes sense we'd naturally do that. Then I guess we notice when we breathe in we stick out more, so we start breathing backward basically and sucking in instead...we're nuts, it's official ^5 haha =o)|`|YQOT68xFaa	Yep, though not as much as I used to.

mBUfy9zMaa	Heal from it.  I was sexually abused in the past and I can honestly say that blocking it out hasnt helped me at all.  Sometimes it can be easier that way, but in the end theres always going to be things that remind you of your past, or create situations where you are just mentally stuck.  Ignoring it can only work for so long, because your not dealing with the issue.  Your just letting things build up, and one day you will break down.  This is exactly what happened to me, and once I started talking, I got alot better.  Because people really do care, and want to help.  I got the help I needed, and I would never choose to hide something so painful like that again.  Anyways, I hope I helped some!!  Good luck!|`|q17Vo5EEaa	Find a way to channel it out,  for example, some like writing poems and songs,  some like doing sports,  find something you like to do that lets you express yourself|`|bT4JqAwYaa	I personally tried to block the pain out and keep it bottled up but that just makes it a whole lot worse.

We all go through difficult times because we need to emotionally learn from the experience and grow; pretending it never happened prevents growth and learning.  Healing from the pain causes you to understand other people when your trouble happens to them, and in some cases you are able to devise ways to help other people.  For example, women whose children were killed by drunk drivers founded MADD and by causing states to pass better laws against drunk driving, have prevented untold thousands of deaths from drunk drivers.|`|aWknctzTaa	meditation  it's not dumb! and it's not what you think!  it makes you relax and in the process, clears all your issues!  i chose it because it really really really helped my mother more than it even helped me  and yes i still live with my mother!  even if I'm only eleven, i know what I'm talking about!  don't even think about some kind psychiatrist!  those people just take money and, whenever you even wanna go to some kind of.. i don't know, maybe a regular doctor check-up, it'll cause you a pain! if you even go once.. they'll ask you so many questions    if you wanna someone to talk to and to let everything out........ you can also NEVER go wrong with family and friends  they are the people who are always there for you!    hope i helped!  i would know all the things about the psychiatrist because when i when i had breathing problems....... at one point, they considered anxiety problems. but the doctor said not to go to a psychiatrist because it would be a pain! and even after all the anxiety which held me from school for about three months to be accurate, meditation helped my breathing and anxiety!

S08uUTbbaa	The government's role in a command economy is to make resource allocation decisions.  Rather than suppliers and consumers agreeing on a price, lets say, for toilet paper -- which would guarantee that suppliers would not make too much toilet paper (they wouldn't be able to sell it) or too little paper (the price would be too high for many consumers) -- the government says "suppliers you will make X amount of toilet paper, consumers we will give you Y dollars to spend on toilet paper per month".  Maybe this explanation demonstrates the absurdity of command economies.
n7bok7NRaa	I am a victim of apocalyptic dreams (every single night for over a year) myself.     Generally they mean that you desire to grow, crack your shell and step forward into the limelight. But you fear the consequences.    In the case of your pregnancy, it's very possible that motherhood is the limelight you're trying to step into, and what you fear on a given level. But what you're fearing is only the unknown.    The horror of seeing your friends and family fail because you cannot communicate your knowledge is only uncertainty.    If your dreams still haunt you, consider taking a pregnancy-safe tranquilizer.    As for why I have those dreams every night? I take a drug that keeps my serotonin level at a given amount, and that just happens to be the "apocalypic horror dream" level. It's very wearying.|`|3X0SJatxaa	dude my dreams are way scarier than that, but maybe your watching too many scary movies?|`|FZ0sKgvzaa	you are trying to save your family, but they refuse to go. it could mean that subconsciously you are afraid that you don't live up to their standards, or that you feel are overwhelmed. things are happening very fast with the volcano... so maybe whatever emotion you are experiencing came on all of a sudden. jumping off of the edge of the earth tells me that you are taking a huge leap of faith... into something you aren't sure about. the fact that you are saved by the "aliens" could signify that you are hoping that your baby will save you from the things mentioned above... the "alien" showing you the earth in total destruction might be your "savior" saying "look at what i have saved you from, it is better here... with me" hope i helped, and I'm sorry you are having these dreams!|`|c90TJKe4aa	seems like you are scared of being pregnant and will ultimately fail leaving you kids life destroyed and deserted|`|YPR55lYsaa	ok we all know ur dream mean SOMETHING  ur dream is very meaningful...well 2 me it is a VERY meaningful dream...i just don't know what its trying 2 say  maybe u should talk 2 .....a psychiatrist?or maybe even ask ur doctor if theres any side effects to any of ur medicines if u have been taking any lately?!?!

R7MD0WByaa	I think you're thinking too much in terms of a long-term plan.  If you choose to do music for the next few years, that doesn't mean you have to do it for the rest of your life.  Do what your interested in doing now.  If you really want to get out into the wilderness, consider joining some kind of organization that lives and works outdoors, maybe do that for a year or so.  Nobody ever said that what your occupation must last a lifetime.  But whatever you do, don't just let time pass by.  Start researching some cool careers, hobbies, and try to either combine your interests, or enjoy them on at a time.  Take action!|`|2zOSXL4yaa	If you see your self earning a living from music and it makes you happy then stick with it, then you can always make time for the other pleasures in your life.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	I suggest you first rent the movies "Into the Wilderness" and "Alone in the Wilderness."<br>  You might just change your mind.|`|RDz4LmHDaa	dude donnt ask us what YOU shoulddo with YOUR life.<br>  you have to think about something this serious.<br>  stuff like this takes time some patience|`|khbSXMcIaa	it's your life, not mine.<br>  <br>  take a test to figure out what you would be best at.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	sounds like your close to finding out what you want to do!  <br>  why not try them all you have 1 life ... grant you can't do them all at 1 time but maybe since you done music for a while try something different!  if your on the different thing and  you keep thinking about music then i think the answer is givin!
ToztjpAsaa	From the parents' point of view there would be enormous pressure, stress and anxiety in trying to make the "right" choice.  And then in future years there will be the massive guilt when the offspring fails to become a billionaire airline pilot who does open heart surgery in his spare time.  "I knew we should have picked brown eyes instead of blue."    In a wider context, (and ignoring the slightly separate issue of screening for genetic abnormalities), the idea of selecting a child based on physical characteristics implies that there is some ultimate perfect set of specifications that is "better" than some other random mix of genes.  This leads us down a very contentious route towards eugenics which I think should be left untrod.|`|AA12349214	Because it is the randomness of us as human beings that makes us who we are.  Where do you draw the line with the characteristic choosing?  You want Hitlers perfect Aerian nation do you?  Everything else being reject?

Most of us are unhappy about our weight and don't like when it comes up in conversation. I used to hate it when people commented about how stick-thin I was, because usually they would say "you're so thin it's disgusting!" with a smile and a laugh, as if that somehow made it okay. Drove me nuts. No teenager likes to hear that she looks disgusting. lol Then for a while I was not happy with my weight because I gained a bunch and got a bit chubby. But now that I'm getting myself in shape I don't mind discussing my weight. I'm happier all the time with it and with my appearance so it doesn't upset me if someone talks about it. <br>  <br>  I guess it all depends on the woman's self-image. If she's happy with herself she won't mind talking about her weight, unless someone's being rude about it. That's never appreciated.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Because it is a very frustrating topic to discuss, and quite frankly nobody's business.|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	Probably fear of judgment.

BhumxInEaa	Have you thought at all about this question?    Do you mean 1800-1801 or 1898-1899 or do you really believe their incomes were constant for 100 years?    When you say "farmers", are you including all the slaves working on Southern plantations or just their owners? and what about the overseers? Are you including subsistence farmers (those who grew their own food) or only market farmers? And if the former, how are you going to attach an income to food grown and consumed on the farm?    When you say "miners", are you including all those who went West for the gold rushes and didn't find anything at all? those who went West and actually mined? or just those that stayed in the East and Mid-West to mine coal, iron ore, etc?
ZKikquiOaa	During the 4.5 billion years it's been around earth looks different depending on the time period.  Some periods the earth was one giant snowball, other period it's a ball of desert.  The planet goes through these warming and cooling periods that spans hundreds of millions of years.  During the ice age, the polar ice caps form and at maximum glaciation the ice sheets will cover everything but the tropical areas near the equator.  Outside of the ice ages, there are no ice even at the north and south poles.    The continents on earth also move about, so the map of the earth looks nothing like it is today if you go back far enough.  The most famous supercontinent is Pangaea that broke apart about 250 million years ago.  Way before that you have the continents Ur and Valbaara, then Rodinia and so on.    As for animals, the first life came from the sea, eventually fish comes about, and from fish came amphibians and eventually land animals.  The animals also change a lot during the many millions of years.  Before the dinosaurs were mammal like reptiles, when they were wiped out about 250 million years ago, dinosaurs came about.  The dinosaurs ruled the earth for over 100 million years until about 65 mya when they were wiped out.  Then started the age of the mammals.  Big giant animals ruled the world during that time, Giant land sloths that stands 3 stories high, giant beavers, mastodons and mammoths, the so called mega fauna.  All ended when men started hunting.|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	I was just like it is today in places where there aren't many humans.

wdmp9eYXaa	some times dreams are just dreams. they don't mean anything. sometimes dreams though are dream journeys that will show you what you need to know and what paths that you need to follow in your life to obtain what you need to grow and learn to become a whole person. other dreams are there to help you to solve problems that you are having in your life that are holding you back because you refuse to deal with them and the cause of them. that is why you need a professional dream interpreter to help you figure out what type of dream you are having and how to handle it and what it means. handled wrong it can cause you more problems than you started with. the type of dream that you had is what is called a dream journey. it is telling you not to give up on someone that you were about to give up on. this person is someone in your life where you are going to play an important role so you need to keep in touch with her and remain a part of her life. as soon as possible you need to reconnect with her. the answer to your last question is that yes i know people and that includes me who have listened to their dreams and have had positives come from it.|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	I think my dreams are really a reflection on what I'm thinking... sometimes the subconscious just lets things free.

5M0FBU89aa	I didn't read your link, so this is off the top of my head;    Inflation will help pay down National debt because existing fixed-interest loans will have a comparatively lower interest rate       - If these bonds are then sold at premium, this in turn will         reduce national debt, which brings (theoretically) more         PPP against other currencies       - One caveat:   Inflation is a very risky thing;   It brings wage-war, consumer distrust, and instability to an economy... not that we don't have those things already present...
3u4HU7rdaa	because ur heart and body and soul and mind are attached to them, and when they go, it's losing a piece of you.|`|NGwxbzEWaa	Because nobody likes being alone :(|`|YW74O9aNaa	You should be asking "why?" when it doesn't hurt!|`|VBCPdcetaa	unlike any other creature we are social but not pack animals. We need the attention love and affection from others to nurish us and make us feel cared for wanted, needed, or just to have a place in this world.     I have lost friends and have lost lovers, the pain fades with time we learn our lessons and lick our wounds and hope someday those holes are filled by another someday.
fv2GAAdPaa	1. Yes you can die in your dreams...if when you say that u mean dying in the dream and not in real life.    2. No that is not true bcuz what i dreamed about last night i didnt even tink about for the day or the week.      your welcome.    =]|`|3u4HU7rdaa	1. Yes of course. search up in the dream dictionary and you'll find what that means.    2. Nope not at all.|`|YW74O9aNaa	I've seen myself die in dreams a few times, so yes.   And no that was obviously not the last thing on my mind before i slept :) In fact many of my dreams are quite random and have nothing to do with my thoughts before sleeping.
YW74O9aNaa	a little scared yes..   in one of my dreams i saw this.. at night we heard noises from the stais in our apartment complex and when my family members went out to see someone came running down from the stairs and shot evryone around :(  I'm kind of scared now to get my laundry done!   I do it in the morning as you must have guessed :)|`|3u4HU7rdaa	yes. i am now afraid of going to those big underground city parking thingy magiggys.|`|lwc0n0zCaa	yes ive had so many dreams of being somewhere that was held up and in my dreams before it happens, i have a strange feeling like something bad is going to happen then a guy with a gun shows up.  so if im in a restaurant or store or somewhere and i see a suspicious guy come in i get really nervous.  ive had the dream so many times.|`|JwURxuZVaa	Well, I am afraid of water after I had a dream about drowning.  I haven't gone swimming in years.  Is that what you mean?|`|ee84f878d59734da208adb9eb82587a9aa	I don't think a dream can cause you to develop a fear. Since dreams are products of your own subconscious I think they simply reflect what you already feel or fear and may enhance or increase that fear but it was already within you.    Fear is not good and it can be destroyed. Face your fear to overcome it. Befriend some cute little kitties. Really, they're just like rabbits but with smaller ears and longer tails. No reason to fear them at all.
AA11286455	People have many different reactions to anesthesia, though it does sound like yours is on the extreme side.      --Check the records from your previous surgeries and see what you were given.  Ask if they can choose medications different from those--you may react better or less violently with different meds.      --Are you aware of any anxiety surrounding surgeries?  If so, as posted above, anti-anxiety meds may help as well.      --Does anyone else in your family react this way?  Check and see if they do and what solutions, if any, they have found.      --Try some hypnosis sessions before the surgery.  Since you are aware of what is going on while it's happening, some hypnosis key or trigger words may help you control yourself and/or help the medical staff calm/control you.      Good luck.|`|Uj8icNHNaa	Do you absolutely have to go under anesthetic?    If so, perhaps the cuts and bruises are better on you than someone else?    I know how god awful panic attacks are but, they may be a better alternative.    It is apparently more normal than you think.    it isn't understood what causes these fits, but I think it may have something to do with instinct and a confused drugged mind.    Perhaps find ways to manage your panic attacks, through counselling before you go in?|`|lxSRIFK2aa	hit ur self every time u get angry|`|700eb1d0a3c26ec1b6bc612bdaefe114aa	i'm not anything remotely close to knowledgeable of medical stuff, just putting that out there, but i don't think this is normal. your doctor probably most likely overlooked something. you should go see a neurologist/psychologist/nerve specialist type of person to see what's going on in your head that reacts to the anesthetics so strongly. maybe you're allergic to a chemical that you didn't know about.|`|ojEkgJoqaa	i don't know what causes you to do this but maybe you should talk to a therapist to find out. i don't know if it is the meds for the anesthesia or what. but to be restrained after surgery. traumatic and makes you worry more    i feel bad but you are being honest and that is a good thing.    good luck|`|T0pkW783aa	I am not someone familiar with medication and the side effects but I do know that I always have a reaction to drugs and anesthesia, though I don't get violent; I do have crying spells and get physically ill.  If the doctor told you that it is something that happens when people get anesthesia, I would be sure to remind the doctor of this and have them strap you down and keep you calm until the medication wears off.  There must be something they can give you to relax you and keep you calm.  Tell them that you have a fear of going through this again and want to be reassured before the surgery that they can help you control this.  Good luck to you.|`|Hr9AfJwYaa	I think you should prove to the doctor your serious. When that anesthesiologist puts you to sleep, wake up and start killing.|`|GWyFPDHvaa	I'm no pychologist, but try something like this. Before your surgery, spend lots of time with your family. Bring a recent family phote and have the doctors put it in front of your face, maybe seeing someone you love will make you not want to hurt anything. Not guarenteeing anything, but it's worth a shot.|`|E2ea5Zjeaa	Have you tried Zoloft or getting a prescription anxiety reliever?
0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	You bet I have. I was hospitalized not long after my first husband left me. Everything is horrid right now, but the only way out is up. You still have 2 children at home who need you. DIL will regain her sanity eventually and you will survive this.  Every day I wake knowing my oldest, still a child, will not be in her room. It brings me daily, unimaginable pain. But we muddle through the pain and do what we have to do...face what we have to face next.  It does sometimes seem like the hits will never stop coming but somewhere inside, even in our darkest hour, we know that if we make it through just one more day.....    I have to believe that for every hardship God allows, there is a lesson we need to learn...something to be gained, something we take away for our personal growth. If I did not hold to this truth, I am not sure I would have carried on to where I am.|`|S6AjZ2uMaa	Never seriously thought about it. And by that I mean I have been pretty depressed at one point in my life, and the thought crossed my mind. But I was never in a situation where I had a gun to my head or a razor in my hand.... I just made myself realize that no matter how bad today might seem, and how many negative things are going on... There will be a day when things start to look up and you are happy again. And that day will be soon... Hang in there|`|0LJde1mPaa	no i have never considered it i have thought about suicide not committing it but i have thought of why people do it and when i think of it really there is no excuse i think its a cowards way out you were put here on this earth and you arent supposed to take your life.  while that may not be comforting, i just think things will get better they have to i think of the future and all that i have to look forward to and that you can get through anything.  i dont know if you are relgious but i am and god helps..... a lot.|`|o1VMX8fWaa	Yes, I have contemplated suicide but what has kept me on Earth is not knowing for sure what will happen to me in the after life and the thought of hurting my loved ones. All we know is that we are here, on Earth, right now. We must take advantage of this because life is precious. You only get one chance. Trials and tribulations will come but life is not fair. You show your true character by how you deal with life, whether it be "taking the easy route" by choosing suicide or overcoming all obstacles to achieve personal happiness.    Stick with it, dear. Life is what you make of it.
SAJitWLfaa	I don't think anyone ever really fully gets over it no matter how old you get, or how much you change physically. There will always be a part of you that's insecure and cautious and feels a bit cheated. I do, however, feel that the pain and emptiness will go away if you consciously make a decision to forgive them (the bully) and yourself for short-comings that were or are beyond your control. only then can you start rebuilding yourself.      Qwerty- You scare me! Don't let someone else control you like that, you are in charge of you and noone can ever take that away. God created us all just the way we are supposed to be, all worth something! Ending it will only hurt the people that love you and empower the people who don't. Don't do anything stupid!!|`|fcfc1c3e10f8e1102d8cd774c38cea8caa	Yes - it's contributed to my shyness|`|jeK9LPugaa	Yes, growing up I was bullied. When I was younger, I was a little chunkier than many of the other kids and I was made fun of for it. It wasn't entirely my fault for my weight. I moved to a different state when I was in the second grade and I was very depressed. I ate to cover up my feelings and that's why I was so heavy.   I was constantly bullied until I decided to attend a different high school 6 years later. Leaving my town school system was the best thing that ever happened to me. I actually lost 20 pounds and was a lot happier.   Also, I am a redhead and for some weird reason kids think it's funny to make fun of others because they look different.     Okay to answer your question, yes the effects of being bullied has stayed with me. I'm now in college and I still have some trust issues with people I don't know. It is really hard for me to make friends because I constantly think that I'm going to be made fun of and rejected. I know I need to grow out of it, but it's really hard. I am working on it though.|`|H1YQ14Haaa	Yes, people bully me all the time just because I'm a little short.  But actually, I think they do it to make themselves feel better because I'm prettier. =]  No, I've learned to ignore it.|`|PCLgLOaaaa	YES! I was just having a long convo about this with my best friend last night. Ironically, I was also 14(8th grade) and I got bullied because I was the new shy kid and I was very gullible and desperate to make friends. These group of kids would call me over to their lunch table and have me take their trays up and just tease me for acting "gay". This went on a little in to hs up until about the end of 10th grade. I moved far away the next year and things DID get better at my new school but I am now a sophomore in college and, though I've made  progress, I am still socially awkward around new people, I hate giving speeches, and I am constantly worried even when I walk by people on my floor or in the common room(i live in the dorms) that people are laughing at me or are going to shout something at me. I believe the scars and bruises of junior high/early hs have prevented me from being who I truly am, which is by nature an articulate, expressive person. I sometimes wonder if it will ever get better and I ever willl be truly comfortable and content with myself.|`|2GjGKZb5aa	Yes, I have been bullied since I was about 7 and I still get bullied now at the age of 15. With them constantly telling me I was worthless I have started to believe it. Now I am seriously contemplating suicide.
1e576939d9233965a515d8aaa9992a28aa	What would I do?    1)  No....  I wouldn't shoot.  Couldn't bring myself to kill another human being over what was in my wallet.      2)  Yes....  I might.  Emotions flying.  Anger.  Fear.  The thought that he would do it again.  I might regret it later, but in that moment I think I might.  Course, that's assuming I didn't shoot him before he could commit the rape.    3)  No....  Kick it, maybe.  Club it with the gun, maybe.  But if it was a big dog (Pitbull, Shepherd, etc.), then yes, I might.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	in the first situation, unless something of value to me was in the purse, like priceless pictures or something, i'd let them get away.    second scenario-i'd probably shoot them. i think that it'd be wrong not to cause he just raped me, and someone else would most likely would be affected, followed by someone else, and so on.    third- i wouldn't shoot at first. i would try to get it off, and hit and such. if it couldn't cause extenuous damage, i wouldn't shoot it.|`|2FR71zXoaa	1) I would shoot him somewhere below the heart (non-lethal)  2) I would shoot to kill  3) I would try to get the dog off me first, and shoot only in nothing else worked|`|INO6tZozaa	Those are good questions but I would have to answer NO to all of them..    I wouldn't shoot someone who is running away. They did what they thought they had to do and then ran. Obviously, their intent wasnt to kill you so why kill them.    NOW, if in the middle of being raped I could acces my gun, I ASSURE you I would shoot him. Hopefully in a place that would cripple him and not kill him, but in the mist of things, who knows..|`|IpbC2dUsaa	1). For a variety of reasons I would not shoot him. Firstly I don't like hurting people with real weapons. While I MIGHT slug him (chances are not, if he's already running). To take a life for a little money? I'd be no better than him. While it's a shame that he would get away with it, it's not worth death.    2. Chances are I'd be too shocked. I'll admit, this would be the point where I might actually take the shock. I'd still probably not, but it would be a fairly close contest. I...I really don't think I'm capable of murder in almost any circumstance. Even if it means him getting away with it.     3. No, I wouldn't shoot it, but my reflex would be to kick it hard. Being a person who hates yippy dogs in the first place and they DO tend to try this, this isn't quite as much a moral issue. Especially since it's not human (that sounds terrible, and I wouldn't go out of my way to make an animal suffer, but if it's attacking me I'd have no trouble responding with force. I'd probably not shoot it, since kicking is easier. Now, would I use a firearm on a dog attacking if it WASN'T so close I'd risk shooting myself? Probably.
taElYijzaa	1: Planned economy, the gov make plans and ask people to finish it. But most of the time. the plan is quite Unrealistic. such as Agriculture,     many officers of rural place exaggerate the farm output. such as 10000 kilogram per 100 square metre, we call it" launch satellite.  2. work and eat together. all belong to collective. people work together and eat together. we call it " big pot food". it means use only one pot to boil food. it lead to a great harm to the enthusiasm. many people starve  to death.  3.emphasize quantity and ignore quality.   4.put the scentists and other intellect into farm and factory. No education and little research. great harm to our today's development.  5.One family could only raise one or two chicken or duck. if more. they will call you Capitalism and catch you.  6.Finish some big projects. Such as  railway and big dam. also make jet plane.  I can't remember more. pardon my Chinese English.
fDGPbwdsaa	As time unfolds, any movement relying on agenda-driven 'studies' (i.e. dishonest, the outcome is already known before the 'study' is even taken) get a reputation.    Only a day or two back, someone asked a question about the 'findings' of some 'study'. No mention of feminism was given. I skimmed the 'study' and discovered it was the usual "man bad / woman good" outcome.    From that-alone (blaming of men as a class), I concluded the author was probably a feminist.    A quick google on the author's name (her name ecapes this moment, sorry) and lo' n behold - I was right!!!!|`|cbsAZVNQaa	everyone use false statistics to support their arguments. Everyone, every cause..|`|84gK4XlHaa	So, that "Mister Objectivity" name...that's meant to be ironic, right?|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Common knowledge?  What exactly is that?  Just a way of imposing your OWN opinions, that's what!  You're the one who's a troll...|`|cWxwHMQWaa	I've seen both sides using stats and awful lot and them making points around that, as if it were definitely true and realistic.    I've always had a tough time believing stats are realistic, especially with issues where there's abuse and whatnot. How can you track something accurately when so much is done to keep it in secret?     Any stats involving abuse, I toss immediately. Stats about anything involving relationships really are the same. How can anyone accurately break down relationships into something on a chart? Just doesn't make sense to me.     It's good to discuss something, but to take it as gospel to me is sorta...not fantastic =o/|`|DHyUnhS1aa	Kind of like this question?|`|eBMKmgCjaa	Unfortunately it isn't common knowledge. Many people still believe the feminist stats and factoids because they have never actually questioned them.    Edit  Hey feminists! If you want evidence check out the link below. It debunks 3 of your favourite lies:  1/ There is a sexist pay gap  2/ Women don't commit domestic violence as much as men  3/ 1 in 4 women are raped    Check it out - I double dare ya!|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	I dunno. In Ontario they include deceased men in their "Deadbeat Dad" stats just to pad em up. My feminist friend justifies this because "those statistics are just to make men feel guilty"|`|2bO7iiZdaa	Yay, two points!|`|1wIek546aa	why is it common knowledge that people trying to debunk feminism don't even try and use statistics to support their arguments?|`|4s31OKf5aa	I guess the real statistics don't work in their favour.|`|6NFQ3pylaa	How do feminists have time to argue anything, or find statistics, false or otherwise, if all they do is strip and work as as prostitutes?      You're slipping.|`|5vBpKmNcaa	Truth is, there is no such thing as "common knowledge" Go to IRAN and ask them what a feminist is let alone what false statistics they use. What knowledge one group or culture may be familiar with may not be with another culture or group. Therefore there is no such thing as common knowledge, except that there folks on Yahoo Answer's that ask dumb questions... Hope this helps Mr. Objective :-)|`|521978f4254c4b8f2b7244300239e951aa	Your question would sound less idiotic if you had PROOF to back up your claim.  And to add to that, this is a loaded question, not a real question of any value that is worth being answered.
