dYGLyVpzaa	I agree with you - other papers used previous pictures of the couple with their son, which is fair enough, but showing a picture of them grieving is just wrong. I understand that they are public figures and we should know what's going on with him and his family, but this has taken it too far.

This is life and what is happening with the economy should be no suprise what so ever.  Life is a struggle. Period.  Our society has conditioned us to beleive that if things are hard, then we are entitled to have something done to make life easier for us.  So what does everyone do?  We all complain.  We point fingers and blame.  Thats ok sometimes but there is a time when we need to just realise life is hard and we need to be brave and strong and do our best to get through it and work hard.

It's not as bad as in Muslim countries, since the couple still have the right of choice, but it's definitely not something to be proud of. But to go from that to pedophilia and being sold? If anyone tried to sell their daughter or son in Israel, it would be a long vacation in jail for them.<br>  <br>  As for the one asking about the age consent in Israel regarding marriage - From my personal experience as a 21 year old from Israel - 25+ is the common age. Some get married as young as 18, never before.<br>  <br>  Last but not least - To explain a bit better what really happened there: According to religious Jewish law, 3 conditions have to be met for a couple to be considered married. In reality, it takes much more than that - there's a wedding ceremony, the rabbi acts as a priest, lots of papers have to be submitted before hand, and then there's the ring giving, a special sentence said and lots of other traditions and rules. They had the 3 important conditions fullfilled, so the orthodox rabbis, RELIGIOUS marriage court and families considered them married. Of course, they weren't recognized as married in the population census or any other official population database for that matter. Nor would they be. This was all a marriage and divorce recognized only by the religious marriage court.<br>  <br>  Reading the newsbit this morning myself, being an atheist, I couldn't but laugh at this complete asininity, especially with the girl accepting to divorce after being offered 10k shekels[roughly 2,500$]. Now that's what I call true love. Also, note that orthodox Jews represent a small portion of the Israeli population and an extreme one in their religious believes. This kind of act wouldn't have been taken seriously anywhere else in Israel. <br>  <br>  As for how crazy it is - I don't consider this "marriage" even one bit crazy. It's quite common for people of this age and below to have a "pretend marriage". In common society, 2 kids pretending to get married is nothing unusual, while in this story, the parents took it way too far. The kids are fine, the parents are the only ones whom I'd call crazy.|`|6Lcn1aLsaa	Even though she did not want the divorce she did want the marriage which is a definite improvement on the forced marriages that many young women are sold into. At least she fancied this feckless boy and he is not a dirty old man chosen by her family. <br>  They can now move on. Imagine being sold by your family and facing an honour killing if you reject the paedophile who has bought you?|`|Lx6TXgHKaa	I thought that these things happened only in Islam.|`|qr16GzNnaa	yes that is weird because we are from not from Israel|`|S8RL9lieaa	Funny old world innit.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	i cant believe that they class that as being married<br>  <br>  so technically they could have been even younger<br>  its terrible|`|GOifC7i3aa	absolutely stupid<br>  <br>  it is ridiculous for children to be married ......it looks like a game if you can just give someone a ring and claim you are married ......it seems like a good way for this boy to get the girl to sleep with him<br>  <br>  lots of impressionable kids could get caught up in the emotion......<br>  <br>  i'm not surprised his parents were eager for the divorce or that she wasn't<br>  <br>  as a mother of a teenage boy i would feel the same<br>  <br>  and marry in haste repent at leisure.........or not in this case|`|ur5wDhkMaa	It's no more crazy than this.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7897098.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_a...</a><br>  <br>  She got 10,000 Shekels, this lady will be lucky if she gets a bone and it's not like she will be consulted about polygamy is it :o)<br>  <br>  Edit: lol|`|tguEmxVyaa	My view is this story has no affect on my life at all..14 is a good age to marry.|`|c5a50631f90f4ba04d88c923dc2aa963aa	life is cruel...<br>  <br>  i think they r too young but love is wat it is|`|9QBlKlFmaa	That is indeed the halakha.

AA11898755	We're all sad that the war is coming to an end in Iraq. But you'll find something else to entertain yourself with! After all things in Afghanistan are terrible and getting worse daily so you'll have lots of mayhem there to enjoy. Now, you just have to look back nostalgically on all the new terrorists who have been generated, the thousands of innocent civilians who were ground to mush and the great increase in the strength of Iran we've done so much and worked so hard to enable. You can't expect these things to go on forever, no matter how much you become attached to the smell of blood. It'll all be ok.|`|Lngb8ryFaa	what war is he stopping?? he's about to deploy thousands of troop to afghanistan...all that BS he said about ending the Iraq war and the terrorism war was just that, BS...we'll see if his supporters are dancing in the streets in 4 years like they were when he was elected, stupid americans|`|QuGTZJIVaa	Turns out he isn't.  He's bringing the troops home from Iraq some time in July, but Afghanistan is still an important objective. 17,000 US troops are being sent under Obama's orders and he's asking the British to step up our presence too.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	Bush's war caused MORE terrorists and wars.<br>  <br>  Don't align yourself with the lies of the losing party.|`|222c3710b1c82cfb0a40a144369157a8aa	Is that what Rush Limbaugh told you to say?<br>  <br>  In the first place, he's not "going to stop the war" anytime soon, he's just trying to get us out of Iraq, where we never should have been in the first place.  We're still going to have troops in Afghanistan for a long time to come.<br>  <br>  In the second place, terrorists come about because they lack the military manpower and equipment to fight the major powers on an even footing, so they resort to terrorist tactics.  Not fighting a war not only is unlikely to ..."cause terrorists and more wars," it actually might reduce the number of terrorists.<br>  <br>  Lastly, the main reason not to fight a a war is because it is so expensive and wasteful in terms on lives and money.  You're probably too uninformed to realize it but (primarily thanks to the Bushies) this country is deeply in debt.  We need to get out of Iraq to permit us to spend our taxes on something useful.|`|RL1C9hVPaa	Obama isn't ending any war. He has agreed to leave some military personal in Iraq for an indefinite period of time and he is ramping up forces in afghanistan. We are simply swapping priorities between the two countries.  So in essence we will have forces fighting in the region for quite some time.<br>  <br>  Although the war in Iraq has plenty of negatives and was criminal. It may have given us some positives, if only short term:<br>  <br>  1. This country has been less a target because of the commotion in Iraq.<br>  2. The middle east governments will think twice being affiliated or assisting terrorists as the US has shown the ability to jump the gun and destroy entire countries over it.<br>  <br>  But I do agree that long term, we have created far worse problems for ourselves and our children because of Iraq.<br>  <br>  However, extremism suffered a big blow too, as even many arabs don't want to see their country and holy lands destroyed because an extremist did something terrible on US soil. The reason Bin Laden made his home base in Afghanistan was because it wasn't a sacred place for him, and thus had no problems with it being attacked by the US. The reason he might be hiding in pakistan is much the same, it holds no spiritual value to him.|`|r1rXE6Gtaa	Because it's pointless to continue this nonsense.|`|BWvIllhKaa	Killing them is causing more terrorism and more wars.

By then hopefully the Iraq army can take care of everything themselves.|`|tguEmxVyaa	What war is he stopping?He's doing exactly what crazy Bush was going to do..Please check your facts.

In the 40s and 50s These things would have been covered up - just look at the number of prominent politicians who had affairs in the first half of the 20th century - these would never go unreported today. <br>  <br>  SO  my rambling point is: Has the UK actually got any worse?

6OFHemITaa	Don't believe everything you read or hear.  You have to judge for yourself.  For example- FOX does not lean to the right.  They report the news.  That's what reporters and news media are supposed to do.  Of course, there are shows on FOX that have conservative hosts-Hannity is a prime example-however FOX is not.  MSN is totally left as are the three major networks. <br>  <br>  "While the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal is conservative, the newspaper's news pages are liberal, even more liberal than The New York Times. The Drudge Report may have a right-wing reputation, but it leans left. Coverage by public television and radio is conservative compared to the rest of the mainstream media. Meanwhile, almost all major media outlets tilt to the left.<br>  <br>  These are just a few of the surprising findings from a UCLA-led study, which is believed to be the first successful attempt at objectively quantifying bias in a range of media outlets and ranking them accordingly."<br>  <br>  "I suspected that many media outlets would tilt to the left because surveys have shown that reporters tend to vote more Democrat than Republican," said Tim Groseclose, a UCLA political scientist and the study's lead author. "But I was surprised at just how pronounced the distinctions are."<br>  <br>  "Overall, the major media outlets are quite moderate compared to members of Congress, but even so, there is a quantifiable and significant bias in that nearly all of them lean to the left," said co?author Jeffrey Milyo, University of Missouri economist and public policy scholar."|`|GrmIVttXaa	i watch news. cnn is an opinion show with "opinion actors" posing as journalists.|`|zn0pXkc0aa	About as liberal as you can get...<br>  <br>  Retired reporter|`|LJwhaNIDaa	CNN is very left leaning and liberal. <br>  <br>  They make some pretense of being fair and balanced but they routinely suppress news stories that may show liberals and Democrats in an unfavorable light.  <br>  <br>  Conversely they over report news stories that show conservatives or Republicans in poor light.|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	CNN leans more to the left but are not nearly as bad a NBC and MCNBC.

The inkstand is considered the oldest surviving relic of the House, dating from between 1810 and 1820. Although its origins are mysterious, it most likely came into the House around 1819, when the old Chamber (now Statuary Hall) was first in use. The inkstand’s earliest record is an 1821 portrait of Henry Clay in the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, where is pictured on a table at Clay’s side. The inkstand is stamped with the mark of J. Leonard, a Georgetown silversmith and watch maker. The tray contains three crystal inkwells and is adorned on both sides by swags and medallions with eagles. The feet of the tray take the form of fasces with snakes winding around them, a classical symbol of wisdom supporting authority and the strength of unity.<br>  <br>  The inkstand is made of coin silver (.90 purity), and has a rectangular shape, measuring 11 ? inches long by 7 inches wide by 2 ? inches deep. It has a hinged handle, which stands six inches in height. Three pressed glass ink containers sit in the stand. <br>  <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/art_artifacts/virtual_tours/house_chamber/rostrum.html" rel="nofollow">http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/art_a...</a>|`|6OFHemITaa	Can't stand to watch her, so I missed it.|`|EMt11Qfzaa	Wasn't that the base of The President's teleprompter.<br>  I was lookin' at that too!
zn0pXkc0aa	It's always hard to find a job as a journalist. I'd look for internships or work at a small media outlet.|`|6OFHemITaa	Probably NOT if you are a liberal!  Just skew the facts and add all the bs <br>  you can!  And definitely give your opinion-not the facts.  That is what journalism has come to.

8IyZphFVaa	i think they should do whatever they have to do to make sure something like this doesn't happen again. the editing was horrible.|`|wyD1M4Buaa	I think he should be immediately fired.<br>  <br>  <br>  That comic was mean to the monkey.|`|a6db42e49f993ea71c61b954e3e06743aa	I thought nothing of it but that it was a dumb cartoon until somebody pointed out why people were being offended.  The cartoonist should be fired cause he sucks, not because it was racist.  I think that the monkey being shot was drawn a little too gory for a cartoon but i dont think people should be offended.  It seems the ones who find racial slurs are the ones who are thinking it first themselves.
jj4ZbtrCaa	bad. Look at what they did to McCain.|`|xZwwb3kVaa	Probably like some people on here, with contempt... but they will grow old as everyone does, as it is something you cannot avoid. Think on these words, when you also reach your Pension Age, and no doubt you will get upset when remarks are said about you.. People think that as soon as you reach the Pension age that you are all stupid and treat you as if you were. The media might say a few things but your worst enemy are your Children, who think nothing of making very hurtful remarks, as if you should be locked away.|`|AA11476439	The media refers to anyone over a certain age as elderly - it<br>  seems that age is around 65 on the national media level & may<br>  vary regionally ( in PA it seems anyone over 70 is elderly)
NMpbLtuTaa	She's going to need a bus and a truck.|`|2wyDALHgaa	I don't think anything of her but I do think there are far too many questions being asked about her.  Just let it go.  Perhaps it's the tabloid culture these days but for goodness sake, who cares about this women.  Let her live her life, with or without her kids as CPS may decide.  <br>  <br>  Her 15 minutes of fame are far, far too over.|`|rl6MRtVWaa	I think it was a bad move, but I support her all the way.<br>  <br>  &&+ BY THE WAY,<br>  Why do you call her "octo-mom"?<br>  You know, she has 14 kids...not 8.|`|6EQJPxfjaa	very little....absolutely.
Lx6TXgHKaa	No doubt that things in Turkey are better than many Islamic states, but to say that they are moderates and will be a gross folly.<br>  <br>  You can just go and try to find out the reason why they have not been able to join EU even though they are one of the prospective candidates. Because many of their systems suck. The situation might seem good in big cities like Istanbul and Ankara but they are pretty much the same as other Islamic countries in rural areas and suburbs. They are responsible for human rights abuses. In fact just last year they tried to pass a law for compulsory wearing of hijab for women in School/Colleges. That the law was blocked is another story but it pretty much shows that they are taking hardline Islam as the role model. Polygamy is still prevalent in Turkey.<br>  <br>  One way or other it seems that Only a section of intellectuals in Judiciary and Army have somehow preserved the secular fabric of the country otherwise they would have long ago opted for hardline Islam.|`|6jrv0MWTaa	Turkey's history of human rights abuses say that it shouldn't be a role model for any nation in my opinion.<br>  <br>  And as for sharia law, anyone immigrating from an islamic nation to a western one should be forced to sign a document saying they reject sharia law and the teachings of the most violent islamic groups, upon proof they were not truthful in signing there should be an immediate deportation. (yes, this should apply to asylum seekers too.)<br>  <br>  And just so you don't accuse me of being racist: I am equal in my dislike of all extremist positions. (chuck out the folk that throw red paint on fur too)<br>  <br>  let them do with their own countries what they will.|`|iCMrsV9daa	Maybe separating religion and politics is a good thing. Sharia law dosnt fit the 21st century and should be stopped. <br>  <br>  Lupines- So your saying the only good arab countries are the westernized ones? Dont try to stop people from following their religion and morals and values just because you cease to have any. Maybe people like to hold on to their culture and traditions and thats what makes every country in the world unique in its own way. Nobody forces you to go to those countries if you dont agree but to speak as if the only normal way to live is the western way, come on thats utterly and completely racists.|`|AA11735670	yes  /no  think  turkey  goes  with  the  flow  very  smart  country  ...wouldn't  trust  them   either  way  ....sorry  my  opinion  they  go  with who  is  winning  at  time  ..so  perhaps  as  at  this  time  yes  /no|`|AA10047588	You have honest Muslims who are quite open in voicing their feelings on what they would like to do to Christians, Jews, and Hindus;  you also have those who put up the front on how tolerant they are.<br>  <br>  Just look at what Turks have done in Germany and it's pretty clear that tall fences make the best neighbors, whether it's Turkey or Hamas.|`|i7oHTo9haa	Turkish outcome is still very much in the air. While they've made attempts to be secular and moderate and join the EU, they still very much have extremists issues within their populace and gov't which they're fighting off.  I wish them well.  For now though, it's a no go, and Turkey currently is example how not to be in my Westerner's opinion.  Let them become more Westernized, and then I'd change my view and look to them as a role model for other Muslim lands. As far as Shariah, Turkish law is more inclusive towards everyone and should be commended.
I8LSYeD6aa	If the prisoners are let go without trials many will return to their old ways just like Said Ali al-Shihri did.<br>  <br>  This Guantánamo detainee resurfaced in a terrorist group so it just says to me that many will do the same when are let lose.|`|AA11828439	I hope they receive trials. Even desperate criminals deserve that.|`|30a4ee65246d549232fafd90921ce359aa	If Obama  follows through with his plan, they will be free to return to their terrorists ways and find ways to attack America somewhere.<br>  If not America, then our interests somewhere in the world and the innocent people of other countries.|`|AA11476439	Personally I haven't a clue other than what is being reported in <br>  the media...... <br>  The only clear facts any media source can agree on is that Guantanamo Bay will close within a year  & no one has a <br>  clear defined plan as to what will happen to the detainees.|`|xWGJHMkuaa	They'll be transferred to United States prisons all around the country. They will not be released into the world, and anyone who thinks so is a conservative jack@$$ who lacks any kind of rational thought.|`|DPegPYRPaa	They will be put into US prisons, which is stupid, because they shouldn't be brought here to our country, it costs us MONEY to house these jerks!|`|ZyR8ezBwaa	Harold and Kumar will come and rescue them. lol. then they will terrorize the world Cuban style instead of Middle Eastern style. They will work for Fidel Castro and do whatever his crazy plans are. Hey, these terrorists are doing suicide bombings because Bin Ladin says there are 72 virgins in heaven.|`|wyD1M4Buaa	They will be released into the world, once again free to terrorize the peaceful inhabitants of this country, and others.|`|OOwUuar4aa	i cannot believe the answers people are saying. they arent going to us prisons... they are being sent to their own countries to be put on trial and sentenced there.

5DkFFirWaa	we are producing no nuclear weapons, however, the US can produce nukes if need. We have nukes available to launch at places around the world. We have enough nukes to blow the world up. US has second amount of nukes behind Russia. The mass of the nuclear weapons were most likely created during the Cold War.
aGcRB3pyaa	How about writing about a former student of your school who after graduation went on to be successful in their chosen field.<br>  You could speak to your guidance counselor, or principal who could furnish you with information, and probably put you in touch with such a person.|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	There are many hackneyed subjects to choose from that will engender nothing but ennui from prospective readers of your high school rag. I don't think there is a single subject that has not been washed to death in the baths of public opinion.<br>  May I suggest one or two of the lesser evils as follows:<br>  <br>  The horrendous growth in child prostitution and human trafficking.<br>  The hordes of starving people on earth.<br>  The genocide taking place in Darfur and Somalia and other places<br>  The plight of Tibetans and other peoples suffering human right abuses<br>  The role of the UN which is rife with corruption and bias|`|TlLA1DVoaa	Write an article on how freedom of religion is preserved and upheld in your school. THAT should attract some attention.|`|1LequRJgaa	Ideas:<br>  Former graduates who have done great things?<br>  Interesting characters at your school ie a janitor, lunch lady?<br>  A student has won an award?<br>  A student who has an interesting story to tell (ex. we had one of the lost boys of Sudan at our school)?<br>  New school rules?<br>  Religion talked about in school. Is it okay?<br>  Procrastination?<br>  The application process?<br>  Student jobs?
