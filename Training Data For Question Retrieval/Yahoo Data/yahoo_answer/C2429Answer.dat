stAeoUeSaa	Winter solstice Dec. 21, 2012 is just the revealing of the 'antichrist' or the 'man of perdition' at the mid-point of what Christians call the 7 year Tribulation (just subtract 1260 days to get the start and add 1260 days to get the end). Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

sunEk8NVaa	The entire Roman Empire was divided into two for easier maintenance. The Western part retained the name "Roman Empire" with its capital in Rome. The eastern part became the "Byzantine Empire" with Constantinople (originally Byzantium) as its capital. When the Western Roman Empire fell, the Byzantine Empire continued to live.<br>  <br>  The Byzantine Empire WAS the Roman Empire. It was the eastern part of it. Their capital city, Constantinople, was actually founded by Roman emperor Constantine the Great to be the new capital of the entire Roman Empire, both east and west. If there is any argument that Byzantine was not Rome, it is mainly due to their differences in culture. Rome had a, well, Roman culture while Byzantine had a Greek culture. <br>  <br>  After Rome's fall, the Byzantine emperor Justinian sought to reconquer the Roman lands, believing that it was his job as emperor of ROME, not just Byzantine to do so. He sent his best general Flavius Belisarius to do the job but their adventures failed.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	For administrative purposes, the Emperor Diocletian (ruled 285-305AD) divided the Roman Empire into Eastern and Western halves,each with its own ruler.As the Western portion was overwhelmed by waves of Germanic conquerors, eventually falling in 476, military reforms in the east by the Emperors Zeno and Anastasius preserved this half of the empire intact, with its capital the city of Byzantium.<br>   Thus,as this empire lasted till 1453, it is generally known as the Byzantine Empire rather than the Roman Empire. The main language was Latin and the people certainly considered themselves 'Roman'<br>   They were seen as Roman by their enemies as well.When the Seljuk Turks conquered most of Eastern Anatolia following the battle of Manzikert (1071) they set up the Sultanate of Rum, Rum being 'Rome' as they saw themselves as having conquered the land of the 'Romans' from the Byzantine Empire.<br>   So, overall it could be said that the Byzantine Empire was a direct continuation of the Roman Empire, based on the city of Byzantium and surviving eastern provinces of the Roman Empire once Rome itself and the Western provinces had been taken over by Germanic tribes.|`|GdXOjRNmaa	The Roman Empire, after becoming Christian, was split into two separate empires, a western Empire and an eastern Empire. The western empire fell in the fifth century (last emperor, Romulus Augustulus, deposed 476 AD). The eastern empire's capitol city was Constantinople; formerly known as Byzantium, hence the Byzantine Empire which incidentally is a modern term used by modern historians. Back in the day, the Byzantines called themselves, the Roman Empire...period. Rome fell, it was never absorbed as you say. Constantinople fell in 1452 AD. Last emperor, Constantine XI, killed defending the city from invading Turks.|`|AA10622261	What we call the Byzantine empire started off as the easern part of the Roman empire. But being in the Greek cultural sphere it was heavily hellenised and by 600 AD even its official language was changed to Greek. <br>  <br>  The western part fell to various Germanic tribes the Franks being the most powerful of these. But the Byzantine emperors always claimed the western part as their legitimate realm. In practise they could do nothing to regain it since they could not possibly defeat the Germans and reverse their conquest. <br>  <br>  This became a focal point of the East - West conflict (Orthodox versus Catholic, in essence Roman against German) especially when a pope totally ignored the Byzantine emperor and appointed a Frank as emperor of the west. <br>  <br>  The Byzantines had never heard of this word and thought of themselves as Romans. They carried on the Roman state within a Greek cultural framework. <br>  <br>  To the Turks, who ultimately destroyed the Byzantine or Eastern Roman empire,  the Rum (Romans) are not Italians but the much resented Greeks.|`|7lKBt4Mzaa	I'll tell you what I think happened.  YOU find the websites to back it up if you believe me enough for this to be what you'll tell your teacher.<br>  <br>  The Roman Empire divided.  This came from governments that were triumvirates.  Eventually the Western Empire was overrun by barbarians.  The Eastern Roman Empire became the Byzantine Empire and continued for hundred more years|`|94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	'Rome fell' means there was no longer an emperor in the West.  The Byzantine empire was not a continuation, for though they called themselves Romans, it was essentially a Greek-led empire.  No one recognized the right of the Byzantines to the empire of the West, as others tried to claim this right, eg., the Carolingian empire, and the Holy Roman EMpire.|`|H2bFiDNAaa	That's a good question... I never really thought about it.  I'm not sure about that one; I'm kind of partial to that. The Byzantines were after all just Romans migrated west (or was it east?) and are still a part of our everyday culture.

What loss has taken place that you have to concede to?<br>  <br>  "Scissored by polar rounds" doesn't come across. What does it mean? Bullets or something?<br>  <br>  You may consider lessening the amount of descriptive verbs and adjectives you're using to make the message clearer. <br>  <br>  The last two lines seem tacked on.

draNVjbkaa	LET YOUR PARENTS KNOW THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS!<br>  <br>  To get an agent, you need to get GREAT headshots, a good resume, and training from the best. These are enough to get you a commercial agent at least. Getting a GOOD theatrical agent (Film/tv) takes longer. Most good theatrical agents won't see you unless you're SAG, have a polished resume, and a demo reel. Commercial agents are more lenient about that. What the best Commercial agents want to see on your resume are good commercial classes, improv, and cold reading.<br>  <br>  You can get an agent multiple ways. Here are a few common ways:<br>  -Mail in an unsealed manilla envelope with a CONCISE coverletter and headshot with the resume stapled on the back. If you have a demoreel include that too<br>  -Attend a showcase and impress them.<br>  -Get a referral from a friend who is with the agency that you're interested in<br>  <br>  DON'T<br>  -Email them unless they tell you to. IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Call unless they tell you to. ALSO UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Walk in and ask for a meeting. UNPROFESSIONAL THREE!<br>  -Sign with them if they ask for upfront money, make you take new photos with THEIR photographer, or take THEIR classes. Agent's ONLY make money when you do. Agents usually make 10% on film/tv and commercials and 20% on commercial print<br>  <br>  There are FAKE agencies like John Casablancas, Barbizon, and JRP. John Casablancas, Barbizon and John Robert Powers are all SCAMS! They are NOT agencies! LEGIT Agencies only make money when you do (10% for film/tv and commercials, 20% for commercial print).

And, also, Harry married Ginny Weasley, who is also related to the Blacks through Arthur and Molly.|`|ifTMSSjdaa	NOPE|`|XCn2dK1laa	As far as I know,harry potter is not on the black family tree.Sirius's mom would not permit that.<br>  Since Harry is a half blood,meaning his father is a pure blood,he is probably somehow related to Draco,since all pure bloods are distantly related but having Lily's genes increased the odds that they're not related|`|phH2dVYZaa	They are not directly related. Distantly, perhaps, through Harry's father, who is, as you know, a pure-blood, and most pure-blood families are related, one way or another, whether it be by blood or marriage.<br>  <br>  Someone answered basically that ^ before, give them the 10 points.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	They are but super distant<br>  <br>  anyways<br>  <br>  thats fictious|`|iB22RWkGaa	No, Harry is not related to the Blacks. He was just Sirius's godson|`|AXTfpyGAaa	They ARE distant cousins because one of their ancestors was related to each other. The Peverell brothers as mentioned in the 7th book. Harry is descended from one brother because of the cloak and the malfoys are related to the Peverells as well because they are pure bloods and most likely they are tied to the Peverell's in some sense. It was never mentioned how pure James blood was but because it is mentioned that he is pure blood that means he most likely is also related to the Peverells,<br>  It is kind of messed up but they are related, distantly.|`|dYGnVjjoaa	Harry Potter is not related to the Blacks.<br>  I thought Sirius was just his god father, that doesn't mean you have their family blood in you.<br>  <br>  But, i could be wrong.|`|MalzpqWRaa	yes he is, <br>  <br>  harry father was pure blood, and all the pure bloods are related....|`|MQIc7X0Zaa	I've read every single book of the harry potter series.

V1IipJkGaa	Honesty, like it's cousins integrity, fidelity, and trust only works when everyone involved share the value it implies.  If, for instance, in a relationship, whether romantic or friendship or whatever, if one person is honest and the other is not, it is nuetered and becomes futile.<br>  <br>  Con artists and embezzlers are the sadder examples of people who cannot or will not accept this simple fact. Wealth is a illusion;  who is richer, the con artist or the family member?|`|20axdeO2aa	Your question is charged with a heavy play on words and ethical considerations. First, does honesty "pay" what? Money? Not necessarily. Does it pay ethically? In abundance. In that resort I would like to summon Immanuel Kant's Categorical Imperative formulations which state that people should be used only as ends and never as means. Second, one should act as to avoid contradictions (in layman's terms, act as you want others to act).<br>  <br>  You allude our attention to the fact that some embezzlers are successful at amassing a great fortune even once exposed as criminals. But is this a fruitful life? Most embezzlers live miserable and pitiful lives. If wealth is the sole aim of your time here on earth, then I do suppose a breach of honesty may pay off. If you have a moral compass and seek to preserve its correct polarity, then honesty will pay. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|YR4xFiOwaa	It’s according to the pay that your searching for.<br>  I have known people of wealth, and I’ve know people of poverty.<br>  Of those who I have known, I’ve not seen one living soul who found true happiness in acts of dishonesty.  On the contrary I’ve seen honest people that were always happy people. <br>  They were swallowed in poverty, but they were happy.<br>  Honesty and wealth are rarely found together, but wealth is not happiness.|`|ec092ec629cbfccdfae0dd210cc38e07aa	Honesty is one of three things that make a person who they are and ultimately where they see themselves in the eyes of those they see in Life. You can not ever be to honest, and the ones who steal and cheat their way through life never get the chance to say today Lived without regret and feel Great. Life is about our choices and how we face the challenges put before us.|`|tcRpXd7Vaa	They live life in risk, therefore stress.<br>  <br>  In honesty, you need not worry to much on risking the revealment of truth.<br>  <br>  They may be rich, but look at the news lately. Maybe Corrupt persons are being stripped and fined. Not only that but shamed from an entire nation.|`|4IZv07D6aa	You only have to be honest with yourself and brutally so.|`|VcrDOsFKaa	same here. i am brutally honest<br>  it does land u in fixes at times but the overall results are too good to be true.|`|PjwICuozaa	believe me it always does at the end...|`|FoIxsunVaa	There is an old Polish saying, "Lies have short legs."<br>  <br>  But apparently some of those short fcukers can run FAST!|`|AA10097817	I'm honest. Brutally.|`|4dgrwFU4aa	The value of honesty is esoteric. The value of money less so. Some people might tell you they like their jobs but would they still do them if no money were involved. For the value of money honesty is never primary. It is a lie we agree to believe.|`|Wn64Oxxyaa	Sure it does, but it pays much better to be a crook.  Corruption is contagious.  To succeed as an honest person is a truly noble thing.|`|42223372622a38f2018e30c03299ab0eaa	Sometimes.|`|LjqoMHMJaa	If liberals could take the hard truth than we wouldn't have racism in this world.

But apparently unedited Shel Silverstein does. And so does this dude above. <br>  <br>  Ummm...this thing makes almost no sense at all. So she's holding a spade on top of a glade? (glades are flat, grassy areas, by the way)<br>  <br>  And what's this about her shirt not getting laid? That's some weird fetish stuff or something, buggin me out. <br>  <br>  This other dude isn't really blowing my hair back either, so don't worry. Monorhyme poems are usually short (like 10 lines) because they get boring and monotonous otherwise. If you cut this up a little it could work. Monorhymes are usually humorous, too, so it's working on that level, but for the confusion. Try being as concise as possible.
avVdKiWKaa	It's a very pretty ditty.  I like it very much.  I liked every bit of it except for the green olives.  Yuk.  lol.  Congrats, poet, on a fine poem.|`|a5efe275182115a58cc24e44f27eae2baa	Very nice, with just that perfect blend of naughty ;-)<br>  <br>  And here I thought this was going to be about Johnny B. Good all grown up (probably the gunny sack).|`|AA10287019	It's rather quaint and sort of quirky. I like the first two stanzas, the third has too many "through"s. <br>  It's interesting. I like it.<br>  Hope this helps! :)
dQmFoRRiaa	"To Earthward" and "Death of the Hired Man" are at the top of my list, but there are several dozen more I like almost as well.|`|AA10895264	the pasture. my choir sang that song for a honor choir regional thing, it was really pretty. :)|`|bbsKeb4xaa	Well, I love Stopping By Woods.. but Nothing Gold Can Stay is another fave.|`|BSz3GoCcaa	1. The Road Not Taken<br>   <br>   <br>  TWO roads diverged in a yellow wood, <br>  And sorry I could not travel both <br>  And be one traveler, long I stood <br>  And looked down one as far as I could <br>  To where it bent in the undergrowth;         5<br>   <br>  Then took the other, as just as fair, <br>  And having perhaps the better claim, <br>  Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br>  Though as for that the passing there <br>  Had worn them really about the same,         10<br>   <br>  And both that morning equally lay <br>  In leaves no step had trodden black. <br>  Oh, I kept the first for another day! <br>  Yet knowing how way leads on to way, <br>  I doubted if I should ever come back.         15<br>   <br>  I shall be telling this with a sigh <br>  Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br>  Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— <br>  I took the one less traveled by, <br>  And that has made all the difference.         20<br>   <br>  <br>  I have always loved this poem. Since the 5th grade. As i grow up I understood better. I really think this one of his best.<br>  But there is so many that I could not only choose one.<br>  This is just one of my faves. <br>  I really like Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening also|`|R5UIMBvcaa	It's hard to pick a single favorite!  Almost everyone likes "Stopping by Woods,' but I also like "Mendnig Wall" and "The Road Not Taken" a great deal, and also a couple of lesser known ones, "The Hill Wife" and "Acquainted with the Night."<br>  <br>  BTW, there's a hilarious analysis of "Stopping by Woods" by Herbert R. Coursen, Jr.  I can't find it online, but its main idea is that the speaker is someone who knows who owns what and who lives where, knows that the owenr of the property won't be out on this "darkest evening of the year," is riding in a vehicle that has harness bells, and has many commitments and errands to fulfill that night.  Get it?|`|AA11995742	none of them<br>  i like Fire & Ice|`|avVdKiWKaa	The one you cite is most famous and I like it very much.  I admit I have not read much of Robert Frost's works, but The Road Not Taken is most popular and it would be the first one that comes to mind.  However, there is one I remember and despite Google's help, I can't find it.  It is about stars.  One of the lines in it is "Talk Fahrenheit, talk Centigrade, use language we can comprehend."  It is about how reductionist human thought can take something as beautiful as a star in the night sky and reduce it to equations, and what is lost by doing so.

4dgrwFU4aa	Number 3 is good concept, a reason to try smiling. Not that fake smile though :)|`|FoIxsunVaa	1. That is what it is all about<br>  2. Faith is hardwired into the brain. In most countries (with the exception of Germany) 95% of the population claim to be believers.<br>  3. To me, happy people are trying to deny my suffering. Happy people are deniers. I won't be denied.<br>  4. Most of what you are has been set in the first year of life and much of the rest in the first 5 years. What people teach you in HIGH SCHOOL us trivia.<br>  5.

Bravo.|`|wNdB8Gjyaa	1) I suppose this is true, at the very minimum I'm always a consumer in a global market affecting global wealth<br>  <br>  2) Faith in people or people's faith? Either way, that would be highly appealing to me as a nihilist. But I don't think it's true, our faith is just turning from sentimental things to materialism (or it always has and sentimental people just like to complain about it)<br>  <br>  3) Anything can. Frowns and rejection can probably change someone's life more.<br>  <br>  4)  Yes. We are completely at the mercy of environmental stimuli, and maybe genetics giving us certain dispositions to things. There is no scientific basis for spontaneous free will.<br>  <br>  5) This contradicts with number 4.<br>  <br>  6) A best friend is someone who will bring you the most resources in the game of survival.<br>  <br>  ...Yes, a bit pessimistic.

We learn from others yes, but we also learn through experiences, through our senses, from mistakes, and so on.  And how we chose to use our knowledge is what make us "WHO" we are.<br>  <br>  5) Yes, we can apply ourselves to anything, but it's important to understand that NOT everything will come naturally or easy.  To apply yourself is to "WORK."<br>  <br>  6) A best friend is someone who knows what to say and when to say it.  Friends (Best or Not) are Caring and Sincere...
NhFRsflwaa	I like the first name. I'm not convinced of the last. I don't know why. I just think it sounds odd together. I'm not sure if you're looking for an ethnic name but when I do, I always search NHL rosters.(I will suggest Fleury at this point which is French) <br>  <br>  If that's totally off the mark I think I would go with Jackson or Montgomery.

4IZv07D6aa	Ideas are formed from our impressions we  receive from day to day experience. When our impressions are formed into ideas in such a way as to provide a unique, one-off world view then we have an insight. Read how Einstein came up with relativity theory. It will help. Thanks David Hume.|`|FoIxsunVaa	How many copies you can sell before you get sued for plagiarism.|`|AA10554783	Many factors can affect the chosen project development method of an organization or project team. When evaluating which approach to take, consider whether the project is familiar territory with a predictable path, or a new frontier with uncertain outcomes.<br>  <br>  Known projects can usually rely upon a predictive method of planning. Predictive planning provides a linear, specific development plan structured around producing a pre-determined end result within a specific timeframe.<br>  <br>  Evolving projects that face changing conditions are best suited for adaptive planning. Adaptive planning involves breaking a project into small components over an undetermined timeline to allow ultimate flexibility in directing the course of the project.<br>  <br>  Whereas the outputs from predictive planning are expected and knowable, adaptive planning may yield surprising outcomes. Due to the incremental nature of adaptive planning, the overall result of a project may differ substantially from the original intent. The challenge associated with adaptive planning is to remain flexible and open to change, while not becoming irresolute.<br>  <br>  The planning approach selected by an organization will lend itself to a specific project development methodology. Whereas an organization with a predictive mindset might choose to utilize a "waterfall" approach, adaptive teams may choose "agile" techniques.|`|AA10294213	I don't think there are "original" insights.  Before something can be "realized", the potential must exist.  For example, the first human to come up with the idea of attaching a wind sail to a boat must have thought he had an original idea.  But the potential had been there all along, hanging in the ether, waiting for someone to see it.<br>  <br>  All this has to do with our DSL-like connection to the source of all knowing (commonly referred to as God),  which we access through conscience (Latin= with knowing) and intuition (who's doing the teaching?).  <br>  <br>  As the Master once said: "The Kingdom of sailboats is within you".

Karma and reincarnation teaches that upon his death, the bad karma he accumulated goes on into another life but the recipient has no idea of the weight they are carrying. Hitler's soul could be reincarnated into another person, animal or insect. There are some people that wear mouth and nose coverings to avoid breathing someone in. (I'm not joking.)<br>  In countries where karma rules the day and homeless children roam the street, other citizens do nothing to help them. Not because they are cruel but because the child has accumulated bad karma and they believe the sooner the child dies he can begin again. I saw a news article a few years back about a heartbroken mother that had lost her 13 year son to an early death. Just after the funeral, an iguana walked into her home. The photo showed her with tears rolling down her face as she held it - because she was convinced it was her son reincarnated. <br>  I strongly suggest the book by Ravi Zacharais called "Jesus Among Other Gods". He was raised in India and has a clear understanding of these things - and he takes strong offense to the tripe dished out by Deepak Chopra.|`|380b53c18cfb9588bad18dd0f231a984aa	Some interesting resources with experiences and opinions.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.carolbowman.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.carolbowman.com</a> is helpful; you can ask questions there.<br>  She is a psychologist with considerable experience in such situations.<br>  <br>  "Babies Remember Birth," David Chamberlain, Ph.D.,<br>  <br>  "Life before Life," Jim Tucker, M.D.<br>  <br>  And the classic, "Children Who Remember Past Lives," Ian Stevenson, M.D.<br>  <br>  Also worthwhile:  "Education Begins before Birth," O.

Still, a good logical argument can be made because one of the basic laws of physics is that energy cannot be destroyed, only stored or converted.

swQMIywCaa	Do you guys know any other crews? My crew was pretty much a battle  crew before we hit the stage. We just jammed with a bunch of other different crews all over Houston until people started asking us to perform for them at a bunch of different events (School, Church, Parties, etc.) After that we started entering a bunch of different competitions, win or lose our name still got out. Getting "Known" is a slow process but i really don't think you guys are ready for events and competitions yet.<br>  <br>  You guys should come up with some choreography (DON'T BITE FROM OTHER VIDEOS >:[ ) Find some other crews battle/session with them outside of your school, enter you school's talent show or whatever else they have. You guys can go to a mall or a main intersection and start jamming there.<br>  <br>  After you guys get better you should get to know people who can hook you up at small events. You can get more members from people at your school (A lot of people at our school wanted to join our crew after a while.) And start competing a small competitions. You need to get to know other crews first because they can help you along the way.|`|d1ylRSSCaa	Get an agent, and the agent will get you gigs.

yUudoO1Raa	According to Dr. Nathaniel Brandon, he and Ayn Rand were each working on the theory of self-esteem at the same time, but independently and unbeknownst to each other. She was working on it for "Atlas Shrugged," he was doing it for his study to become a psychiatrist. They got together and worked out the Objectivist theory of self-esteem and that was the official kick-off of the subject world-wide. Yes, self-esteem was a subject, but not one that was well researched. Most psychologists thought it was as easy as picking yourself up by your bootstraps and quit whining. Now it's a multi-billion $ industry.<br>  <br>  Ontology is perhaps the fastest growing subject in the study of philosophy. From what I've read several places, this wouldn't be so if Rand had not written her "Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology." The basics of ontology are all laid out in the first two chapters, but it is doubted she had ever even heard of the word. Ontologists study that book, as I have myself.<br>  <br>  Had it not been for a philosopher such as Rand unequivocally standing up for unabashed capitalism, and doing it with rationality and unbeatable logic, we might have had something like Obama's economic stimulus decades ago, perhaps during the Carter economic recession, or on "Black Monday and Terrible Tuesday" during the Reagan administration, because without Rand its possible Reagan would never have been elected. <br>  <br>  What happened those 2 days? "The Tokyo exchange had experienced a record collapse in prices and panic selling. Japanese investors and corporations pulled out their money and assets to shore up their profit statements at home and this promoted market collapses around the globe. <br>  <br>  The economic disaster of 10/19 followed the sun from Asia through Europe and then on to NY. The Hong Kong exchange was wiped out. The European exchanges experienced the worst single day in their history. <br>  <br>  In the US panic first hit in the Chicago commodities exchange and within five minutes of the opening the markets went into free-fall. It then spread to Wall Street and the NY exchange. <br>  <br>  The Dow-Jones averages fell 508 points. By the time the NY exchange closed up stock market prices had dropped 22.6%, almost double the record losses of the crash of 1929. An astonishing 604.5 million shares had been traded that day more than double that of the crash of 1929. It was the greatest crash in US economic history. <br>  <br>  Black Monday was followed by Terrible Tuesday which was never reported by the US press. On the following Tuesday the world’s financial system came to within one hair’s breadth of extinction. It appeared that by noon that the market had in fact died. All trading in stocks, options, and futures shuddered to halt. For almost one hour the world’s capitalist system had completely collapsed. There were no buyers at any price. <br>  <br>  At this point of maximum crisis the Federal Reserve Board stepped in and flooded the banks with cheap credit. At 12:38 that afternoon the stack market rose from the dead. The resurrection of the market was the result of the deliberate manipulation by a few major firms to save the markets."  <a href="http://www.emayzine.com/lectures/1980s.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.emayzine.com/lectures/1980s.h...</a><br>  <br>  The Fed. Res. Board and the Treasury had the very same legal power last fall when instead they decided to involve Congress and ask for that bail-out. They should have just done it, as was done during Reagan's administration, but Alan Greenspan had so f***ed up Rand's ideas that he helped bring us to our present economic situation. Bernanke and Paulson probably didn't trust themselves to act as free agents, even though Greenspan's original action was the proper one and revived the world markets. After that he seemed to become afraid of his power.<br>  <br>  I don't think Bernanke and Paulson wanted that power, especially if it didn't work the way it had for Greenspan. So they went to Congress and gave us our present socialistic mess.<br>  <br>  If screwing up Ayn Rand's ideas can screw up the economy so badly, don't you think following her ideas correctly are better than "kindergarten economics"?<br>  <br>  Isn't her early work on self-esteem with Brandon more than kindergarten? Her work on what grew into ontology? Not to mention that the Ayn Rand Institute is a multi-million dollar enterprise with experts who appear all over TV, write for magazines, and influence us in ways we don't even know?<br>  <br>  No, I don't think "rational egoism" is kindergarten at all.|`|Wn64Oxxyaa	I believe objectivism is reality, but it is too harsh for most to accept - myself included.|`|20axdeO2aa	I say its good for mental practice inside the classroom.

Anyway if one ignores those inconsistencies it is probably quite a sweet poem|`|d882dfb556981cb3af4f55a8e9b82fbfaa	Read and understand.<br>  Is this a sort of encouragement of someone?<br>  Can be shorter and petite<br>  Basically good.
YhAdpBo9aa	It's gonna be a lot easier for you.<br>  I played viola for 4 years before starting the guitar, and I'd consider myself one of the better guitarists in my area.<br>  Fingerwork will be a breeze for you. The one thing that I've noticed though is that you need to spend extra time with your picking hand. Because the bow on a violin is completely different than a pick, my picking hand doesn't seem to keep up with my other hand.<br>  Work on that.|`|AA11294714	The guitar is much, much easier than the violin. See:<br>  <br>  Best Music for Self Teaching <br>  <a href="http://beststudentviolins.com/guitars.html#SelfTeaching" rel="nofollow">http://beststudentviolins.com/guitars.ht...</a>|`|rR3ynAX4aa	easier<br>  strings are hard can u answer my Question its about my clarinet|`|0AUPrCMZaa	you know, if you want to test the waters with a fretted instrument - you could always try a mandolin.  - it is a fretted, plucked, version of the violin.  it sounds like a really high pitched guitar - but violin. :D<br>  <br>  they are very cool.  plus they are tuned the same way as a violin - no learning curve.<br>  <br>  guitar will be different - it will be easier just because you have an ear for music, but not because you play violin.<br>  <br>  and the comment on about the person saying that guitar is easier, personally i have played both, guitar longer, i think the violin is actually easier.<br>  <br>  but since you have a background in violin - chances are violin will be easier for you. :p<br>  <br>  here is a mandolin example:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://folk-instruments.musiciansfriend.com/product/Rogue-RM100F-FStyle-Mandolin?sku=519275" rel="nofollow">http://folk-instruments.musiciansfriend....</a>|`|W1h3w5gdaa	Guitar will be different primarily because of the frets and the tuning. It's hard to say whether it will be easier or harder. I do know that my guitar students who have a background in violin or other stringed instruments have a much easier time learning guitar versus those who have no such experience.<br>  <br>  I am sure you will enjoy it; just be sure to find a good instructor.

0GbSi7Meaa	Stanza 3 doesn't fit - in 1 and 2 you're talking about drowning the other person, in 4 you have. In 3 you're unnecessarily justifying your actions (not that premeditated murder is justified) and it weakens the poem.|`|5Ynm0bBraa	It's really dark, and you probably want constructive criticism but I really like it.  You managed to capture the emotion without the pity.|`|Li0q9NKCaa	i don't like how there are two drowns in the poem. drown is a strong word and it shouldn't be used twice it takes away from the feeling|`|NLXhW9rBaa	its okay|`|B7Im40QSaa	it had some flow issues with the rhyming...good concept, check out my newest q?

285c8243564acc36040f290206c3ff28aa	Reality's easier, because you just research it as much as you can, and read the writings of women who were child laborers, such as the journal of Sojourner Truth, who was a slave, or recent women in Mauritania who were slaves (still happens today), and maybe talk to someone at an agency that helps children.  It might be more interesting to your teacher to read, too, since it's based on something real.
nJrW1AXJaa	cold war was a war without actual fighting between the USSR and the US.  More accurate, communism v capitalism.  you should think about it more like communism v capitalism, even though the US and USSR were the main players.  So when it says 'no fighting', it means no fighting between the USSR and US directly, although the USSR was funding Vietnam and Korea during the wars respectively.  The USSR supplied guns and ammunition.  <br>  The best way to look at it is through 'spheres of influence.'  It makes it all understandable.|`|4dgrwFU4aa	The "Cold War" was an effective marketing campaign waged by corporate interests with the complicity of politicians. Its main feature was the nuclear arms race where the USSR and the USA played a game of oneupmanship with the megatons of TNT ratings of their test explosions. The USSR won that round with an explosion that rated 100 million tons of tri-nitro toluene in equivalency. With a device like that you could kill everyone in New York City in a heartbeat. The US however had better delivery systems. So there were enough threats and bluffs to keep normal people frightened enough to swallow the propaganda and support the military industry.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	The Cold War was a war of ideologies - Communism versus Democracy.From the late 1940s onwards, both sides possessed nuclear weapons, and any direct conflict between USA and Russia would have resulted in MAD (mutually Assured Destruction) with the whole world being destroyed.<br>   Therefore, the fighting part of the Cold War was conducted through surrogates away from Europe, North America and Russia. Each side would support an ideological ally in various parts of the world with weapons, supplies, and sometimes troops. Thus, Americans fought communist Koreans and Vietnamese, Russia supplied weapons to the Arabs during the Arab-Israeli Wars and troops to fight South Africans in the Angolan Civil War.<br>   This meant Russia and America could attempt to advance their spheres of influence and gain allies without directly fighting each other and risking escalation to a full scale nuclear WW3 and the destruction of the world.|`|AA11809403	the cold war was between the US and the USSR (or between democracy and socialism)-<br>  but there was no direct fighting between the 2.  the fighting was on other land, using less extreme weapons ( using guns, not nuclear weapons)<br>  <br>  Vietnam and Korea were "proxy" little wars - in some ways they are part of the cold war, in other ways, not.  that is why the definitions don't fit well.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And, anyway, when those 2 were shooting wars, a lot of Americans thought either that we should not be in them - or wondered why we were in them.<br>  <br>  this won't help you understand, especially it won't help you understand your history class, but it doesn't make sense because... it doesn't make sense.<br>  <br>  If you took a college class on that era, it would make more sense.|`|YWjhqlxbaa	The Cold War started after the Korean war. <br>  <br>  And it wasn't really a war, it was more like a standoff.<br>  <br>  Russia had a missile thing that was located in the Bay of Pigs? in Cuba. <br>  And America was like "wtf" cause the thing was pointed at the US. That's why in the 1960's everyone was worried about the Russians and getting bombed. That's also when McCarthyism becomes popular. Anyway, America responded by putting a missile camp near Russia.<br>  <br>  The Cold war didn't end till the late 1980's. I'm pretty sure Reagan ended it. But I might be wrong.|`|AA11485682	The Cold War wasn't a war. It's the name given for the period when there was conflict between the US and the USSR that never had outright fighting, but the threat of violence was always there. It's like having a classmate that you don't get along with, and your friends and their friends don't get along, and you think there might be a fight at any moment but at the end you end up not fighting at all. That's the Cold War.<br>  <br>  Now, during the period of time when the US and the USSR were at odds with each other, the US got into other, actual wars. And because the USSR was a powerful country, the Korean and Vietnam wars were influenced heavily by the "cold war." But there wasn't direct violence against the USSR. We fought those wars mainly because we were afraid of what the USSR would do if we didn't fight there, but we didn't fight the USSR.<br>  <br>  Does that make more sense?|`|6JXrlnYsaa	NICKIPET - Democracy is a political system. Socialism is an economic system.  You can have both in one country.  The conflict was between democracy/totalitarianism and capitalism/socialism.<br>  <br>  SARAH - You are confusing the Bay of Pigs with the Cuban Missile Crisis.  They are two different things.
Cppi6kRFaa	I don't know if they know for sure what year it was but they think it was around the year 1002 or 1003 that he first spotted the shores of Novia Scotia<br>  <br>  edit: Cyrus is also correct. The New World was first spotted around 985 or 986 by Bjarni Herjólfsson when his ship was blown of course. This is first time Europeans saw the New World.|`|7d4296b653689a306cac74432add2e63aa	The original poster had the story substantially correct. The timid captain who spotted land but didn't go ashore was named Bjarni Thorvaldson. Leif's crew arrivedin 1000 CE, give or take a year or two. The exact date isn't known.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cheers|`|wnkoTEqVaa	It was not Leif Erikson. It was a viking ship that got blown of course. They were by New found land and some of the viking wanted to go on land but most did not so they left and then went to greenland were they were supposed to go. <br>  <br>  Leif then went to New Found land about 20 years later.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT. Thanks Skimmer i could not remember his name. <br>  <br>  Also America was not discovered. American Indians had been living there for thousands of years.
NjYCvfYGaa	For right now? Meaning at the moment?<br>  If you're so flexible with that, I don't think acting is for you.<br>  It is very possible that you go on pursuing this career for 40 years and go no where at all. No, extra work isn't necessary. Casting directors look for experience but having lead roles are much better. Take acting classes outside of school. More hands on training for people that actually want to be that. Don't worry about your resume if you're starting so early. Sites=BAD.<br>  80% of these sites are scams. They will lure you in their free program and when you get a "casting call"(most likely its fake) They'll start asking for your money. Try out for roles with dialogue. Acting coaches are great, if you find a good one they'll guide you through everything. My coach is referring me to an agent in a couple months, so I can start shooting commercials.<br>  <br>  <br>  Well good luck!<br>  Don't let the fire in your heart die.<br>  You have to want it!<br>  I wish you the best.|`|ZKLlTxd0aa	So you want to be an actress. Well frist of all, you have to be ready for disappointment. Many people want to be famous, most don't make it. So saying that, make sure acting doesn't become your number 1 career choice. Well here's some tips. You go to a drama school? That's good. Any good actress has gotta learn how to act first, eh? Keep going to drama school and when you are old enough, go on broadway. That's how a lot of good actors get discovered, on stage doing a play. Don't fall for the scams. Don't fall for the random guy you see at the mall who claims he is looking for actresses to star in movies...he is most likely a kidnapper.<br>  <br>  So with saying that, good luck!|`|IYifBnC1aa	yes taking the classes is a very good idea, and starting out with little roles and as an extra is a good way to build up a resume. I would suggest finding an agent whow ill find you auditions and different things that you can do with your acting. (plays, movies...)<br>  As for your resume you need to put your name, age, adress, weight, height, hair colour, e-mail. Then put all your training, so how long you've been taking classes and with who. (your teacher)<br>  then also put down any experience you have. (previous plays, movies ect. you can find some acting resume templates online if you search. Hope you make it into something soon!

df20f780e29b5cda4abf6f0d9f61d5baaa	The poem is written in two voices. <br>  <br>  The first two stanzas are the voice of someone who has been helped through a difficult situation by his "Hero" - perhaps a therapist or friend.<br>  <br>  The third is the voice of the therapist or friend, responding modestly that he was only doing what friendship required. <br>  <br>  The fourth is the first voice again, confirming the original assessment.
cnDSMsRBaa	there are many different versions of it but ive seen the original one and i almost threw up myself. first two chicks are just like talking and having dinner then they go home and start making out then one girl craps in a cup and then they start to lick and eat it. then the other girl craps in her mouth and then the other girl pukes in her mouth and then she shits and punkes in the cup that they start eating and then pukes into the other girls mouth. how i  remember this, i don't know. i saw it a year ago and i wish i hadn't.

PTdy6TWRaa	I think it could be a great name especially if the clothing line is an Urban style. Urbanik is a family name from eastern Europe and Russia. There aren't too many here, and not many existing businesses using the name in any form. I did some quick searches and don't see anyone in the clothing business using the name. The domain urbanik.com is being squatted on by a registrar in the Netherlands so you might be able to grab that too.

You can resize the picture as big as you want, but it may make the picture unclear if the resolution is low or it was a very small picture to start with.
Ow3O7h4caa	Your wrist has to be straight and in line with the forearm. When you attempt to do bar chords, make sure the first joint of the thumb is bent slightly which will give you more power to finger the chord and produce a clean sound.<br>  Another technique is to throw the thumb to the side so your hand acts like a vice-grip.<br>  If you do it the way I explained it, you won't have a sore wrist ever.|`|wtQY6VEwaa	It will hurt when you do it.

a5efe275182115a58cc24e44f27eae2baa	It's not quite right to think of a sonnet as a stanza in itself - if has 4 quatrains and a rhyming couplet, with placement depending on whether it is Petrarchan, French, Shakespearean...or any number of others - you can create your own (Shakespeare wrote one that was 4 quatrains and no rhyming couplet...)<br>  If you want to have a sonnet with 28 lines, that's not really a problem - at its heart, poetry is more about the elegance of the expression that any precise form (sometimes not even that).<br>  <br>  I am hesitant to comment on the haiku - my understanding is that the true Japanese  form is much more complex than what is commonly called a haiku in English... having said that, part of what defines an English Haiku is the contrast of the last line with the first two - but if you can maintain that and still have a coherent poem, knock yourself out...otherwise you're just creating a new form (or maybe using a form that already exists, but doesn't have a name that I'm aware of).<br>  <br>  As far as I know, ballads go on as long as you've got something to write.
xUTeIaH1aa	it was around the 38th parallel where the front line of the Korean War was when the Cease Fire was signed and the Demilitarized Zone was established. The Cease fire ended the fighting but a formal peace treaty was never signed. Technically the Korean War has never ended.|`|nwtB68x8aa	this was the division of united states and ussr because it was nearly in the middle of the country.|`|bdnMQnVHaa	That is the line where the United States and USSR divided Korea because it was nearly in the middle of the country.  It was the front line of the Cold War and a military presence still remains because North Korea is still a socialist country.|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	The 38th parallel was first suggested as a dividing line for Korea in 1902. Russia was attempting to pull Korea under its control, while Japan had just secured recognition of its rights in Korea from the British. In an attempt to prevent any conflict, Japan proposed to Russia that the two sides split Korea into separate spheres of influence along the 38th parallel. However, no formal agreement was ever reached, and Japan later took full control of Korea.<br>  <br>  After the surrender of Japan in 1945, the parallel was established as the boundary by Dean Rusk and Charles Bonesteel of the US State-War Navy Coordinating Committee in Washington, during the night 10-11 August 1945 4 days before the complete liberation of Korea. The parallel divided the peninsula roughly in the middle. In 1948, the dividing line became the boundary between the newly independent countries of North and South Korea. After the ceasefire that effectively ended the Korean War (1950-1953), a new border was established through the middle of the Demilitarized Zone, which cuts across the 38th parallel at an acute angle, from southwest to northeast. The 38th Parallel was also the place where the cease-fire was called to end the fighting.<br>  <br>  The Korean Demilitarized Zone is a strip of land running across the Korean Peninsula that serves as a buffer zone between North and South Korea. The DMZ cuts the Korean Peninsula roughly in half, crossing the 38th parallel on an angle, with the west end of the DMZ lying south of the parallel and the east end lying north of it. It is 155 miles long and approximately 2.5 miles wide, and is the most heavily armed border in the world.

YorMkZYAaa	Read my response to you via private mail. Considering you didn't spell "stories" correctly I doubt you're ready for publishing your work. Furthermore, there is nothing wrong with magazines or newspapers as both are typically highly respected depending on the publication.<br>  <br>  Most young and amateur writers will not make any money from their writing so don't get your hopes up. I've been writing professionally for seven years and still struggle to earn a decent income from my writing.<br>  <br>  Focus on the writing and getting better first. If you really are any good then maybe you can earn money from it in a few years.
usvPMtMtaa	I find it really entertaining that people describe Edward Cullen as “the epitome of perfection,” when he is anything but. Edward Cullen is depicted as impossibly beautiful and can somewhat be compared to the god Adonis. His skin is "like marble"—very pale, ice cold, and sparkles in the sunlight. He has perfect facial features and impossibly captivating eyes. I can pretty much hear the words “fag, fag, fag, Gary-Stu”, being screamed at me as I write those words.<br>  <br>  But Edward Cullen is a stalking, pedophiliac, abusive son-of-a-*****. What kind of boyfriend disables his girlfriend’s car so she can’t visit her best friend, who’s having a hard time? What kind of boyfriend beats up his girlfriend while they have sex? What kind of boyfriend blames himself when his girlfriend falls over? WHAT KIND OF BOYFRIEND WATCHES HIS GIRLFRIEND SLEEP? AND HE WASN’T EVEN HER BOYFRIEND WHEN HE DID IT!!!<br>  <br>  Also, what kind of sick **** gives his wife a cesarean with his teeth? The answer is apparently a guy who fills the hormonal fantasies of millions of preteen/teenage girls and possibly gender confused boys.|`|AA10652867	He's fictional and portrayed as an abusive boyfriend. Sure, I fell for him at first, but it ticked me off how he managed to get his way by manipulating Bella into doing what he wanted, restraining the visits to her friends and calling her names that would keep her under his thumb. He is plain abusive and people don't see past the pretty sparkles.<br>  <br>  It's sad how Stephenie Meyer has made young girls think that this kind of destructive relationship is good.|`|YEfW3vI0aa	Yes, I agree with you entirely.<br>  <br>  Yes, he is cute and very beautiful, a gentleman, kind, caring etc... but he isn't real!<br>  People take this too far and start believing that Edward Cullen is actually out there!<br>  <br>  It is very immature when people start posting answers like  'ZomGG Edward is Sooo HAWT!

As for the character, I dislike him, quite a lot, and prefer Jacob over that, because he shows what love is, flaws and all.|`|SYKGIiQkaa	Because apparently abuse, sparkly, and controlling equals attractive to girls under the age of twenty and women above the age of thirty-five.|`|xv7YlV29aa	He didn't hurt Bella during sex lol. If he did she would of stopped him. Not sure what you mean about the car. He is not abusive. He is possessive. He'd never hurt her unless his animal 'monster self' took over and made him. <br>  <br>  And I don't really get why 'Twilight haters' make a big deal of fans loving the movie and books. SO many people complain all of the time or answer other 'fans' questions and are mean. its rude.<br>  <br>  Not talking about you, just anyone who hated Twilight and complains. Not trying to be rude.<br>  <br>  To answer your question I dunno. I love him. Love the actor. He is hot. Love how he loves Bella so much. Love that he cares so much to protect her from evil things.  My world does not revolve around him. I'm not one of those obsessed fans. I just like how Stephanie writes him. I like that he is not all sappy and glad he doesn't only want sex and stuff. He cares enough to try to push himself away from her because he feels like he will hurt her, but she won't let him.|`|bkgyzCdOaa	sorry, but, is this affecting you in anyway?<br>  ...too bad? seriously, it's their lives!<br>  why do you obsess over why they obsess over him?|`|sedgp3p6aa	People are only obsessed with him because robert Patterson played him in the movie, and of course robert Patterson is hot!|`|oU4L01s0aa	BECAUSE HE IS FIGGIN' AWESOME! gosh i hate non-believers

I seriously liked that, I wasn't sure at first but now I want to read more, I want to know what happened to Julie, where she is, and if she is even dead???? You really do have a writing talent, I'm impressed. Best of Luck to you! You are off to an amazing start. Send me  a draft once you write it. Oh, I just want to tell you that I ;love your description of Blue, as an emotion, your description was really powerful and was an asset to the story as a whole. GREAT JOB!!!<br>  <br>  You have a truly marvelous writing style, you have a wide variety of sentence and paragraph structure, which makes your writing neat and better. I love the way you describe their anguish and grief so simply, it is really well-done. Also, your story flows really nicely. I can tell that your writing has real potential and it is actually going somewhere. It creates questions and interest.  <br>  <br>  Good job! My one critique....<br>  Use a little more description, just near the end it got a little thin. So work on that and Good Luck|`|wYF6U6qlaa	I'm very impressed by your writing style.  You have varied sentence structure, good flow and connection, even - dare I say - an actual sense of progression? <br>  <br>  Your sentimentalism is emotional without being cheesy, your characters' introductions are staggered thoughtfully.  All very good things.  I like how you use the color blue as a motif, illustrating the development of the character's grief.<br>  <br>  <br>  However, you shift tense inappropriately a few times: <br>  <br>  I was seriously about to lose it .... when I look up at Mom, she’s smiling .....now the crying was ending.<br>  <br>  I would also be hesitant to label this a preface until the story is drafted.  It could be a preface, but you won't really have a good sense of what your story requires and how best to present it until the basics are plotted.  Words like 'preface' 'prologue', even 'chapter' to some extent - are really just formatting concerns.  I often see writers using them as stepping stones to quickly string together vignettes that could be woven together far more thoughtfully.  You're a good writer, don't segment your story into a brick wall :)

Those are just some really great ones.|`|ZaBGMT12aa	Someone Like You is one of her first novels and easily one of her best. Her friends compare all her books to Someone Like You and they always say that all her new books fall short of the standard she set. I read it and I loved it. It's open and honest and a trip away from stuffy writing. It's raw and definitely the work of someone who loves to write and has a story to tell.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion, of course.<br>  <br>  My other favorite Dessen book is The Truth About Forever. There was something about it that just got to me. Same deal with Just Listen. I'm not Sarah Dessen's biggest fan, but I feel like with every three or four books she writes, she comes out with a gem.|`|GNf3tmguaa	i really liked the truth about forever dreamland is good too. but she is awesome!<br>  The Truth About Forever--<br>  Macy's summer stretches before her, carefully planned and outlined. She will spend her days sitting at the library information desk. She will spend her evenings studying for the SATs. Spare time will be used to help her obsessive mother prepare for the big opening of the townhouse section of her luxury development. But Macy's plans don't anticipate a surprising and chaotic job with Wish Catering, a motley crew of new friends, or ... Wes. Tattooed, artistic, anything-but-expected Wes. He doesn't fit Macy's life at all--so why does she feel so comfortable with him? So ... happy? What is it about him that makes her let down her guard and finally talk about how much she misses her father, who died before her eyes the year before? Sarah Dessen delivers a page-turning novel that carries readers on a roller coaster of denial, grief, comfort, and love as we watch a broken but resilient girl pick up the pieces of her life and fit them back together.<br>  <br>  <br>  Dreamland--<br>  Rogerson Biscoe, with his green eyes and dark curly hair, is absolutely seductive.

AA10580232	Its when you turn without getting dizzy.<br>  To first learn spotting, think of yourself as an owl. Focus your gaze on something at eye level. Turn your body slowly, still keeping your eyes on the object. When it becomes impossible to turn your body anymore without turning your head, whip your head around very quickly catching sight of the object as soon as possible as you complete the turn. Practice this slowly at first, then try going faster. In class you'll begin to learn different turns, and you'll practice them slowly at first, then faster as your spotting improves. Its the only way to perform multiple pirouettes and fast turns without getting dizzy.|`|ybwqYZ1waa	When you turn you look directly at something.

pBu9Qi5Haa	This could probably be made into a song. Very nice flow and a way with words. One look at this poem and someone might think that this is just your typical love poem by some mediocre and self-centered teenage girl. But it's not.<br>  <br>  I especially like this part,<br>  <br>  "He thinks It'll get better," I said with a sigh.<br>  It's not getting better; It's just getting worse.<br>  I'm still alive, and baring this curse.<br>  <br>  Sounds like something that can apply to the existential angst that we all go through with once in a while.

They're about girls with real problems like alcoholic parents and eating disorders, not just Ehmagawd, Derrington didn't text me! and I totes need a new Burberry jacket.

iJzIIEdfaa	Cheap labor, easy to get, fast to replenish, easy to control (slave owners were usually more technologically advanced than their slaves)<br>  <br>  This is about slavery around the world in general, not specific to the US.|`|5q7uPqVmaa	Contrary to what the previous answer stated, I think that slave owners were less technologically advanced than their neighbors to the north.  Since the southern American states could depend upon a cheap supply of labor, there were fewer incentives to develop, invent, and invest in new technology so that the south had few factories and less technology used than the north during hte early half of the 19th century.  I think that this was one of the main reasons that the south lost the Civil War.<br>  Reasons pro-slavery supporters cited for defending the institution of slavery?<br>  Legal raesons were the inviolobility of the right to property as stated in the 5th Amendment to the Constitution and the Plessy versus Ferguson Supreme Court decision.<br>  Economic reasons were that slavery was in the greatest material interest of the world's commerce since it's labor supplied a large portion of economic products at the time.<br>  They had other reaons too---social ones, such as a belief that not everybody was created equal, a sense of paternalism and a belief that owning slaves and taking care of them in their old age was superior than the pauperdom of old age in the mill towns of the north.  (Slaves were always singing, right?  Please note sarcasm!)  They even supported it through historical examples such as the number of ancient great civilizations that had slaves and the fact that 4 out of the first 5 presidents had slaves. Plus, there were biblical supprts too---Jesus never spoke out against slavery, there was the idea that blacks were cursed by the mark of Ham, etc.

t3bjxl68aa	Well, I'm not entirely sure if this has been used before but a power that he could acquire is that the air has control over him.

yvyewZrWaa	I also like "Silas Marner" -- there's just something about it that reminds me of a fairy tale, which, in my mind, is always a good thing. My other favorites are "Bleak House" by Charles Dickens, "Jane Eyre" by Charlotte Bronte, "Far from the Madding Crowd" by Thomas Hardy, "Rebecca" by Daphne du Maurier, and "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen.<br>  I think that, more than anything else, quality and durability make a classic -- sorry if that sounds vaguely like I'm referring to jeans or hardware or something. While most classics have already proved their worth by enduring in a constantly-changing world (owing to the fact that they are brilliant pieces. capturing an important aspect of humanity), I do I think that some books can be defined as contemporary classics (I thinking of "The Remains of the Day", which I love it, too) simply based on their quality, which should promise durability, anyway.|`|BpD3wdqAaa	I enjoy Steinbeck, especially East of Eden.  I also liked Siddhartha, by Hermann Hess, and Franz Kafka's short stories.  Children's classics are very appealing to me too.  I enjoyed Lewis Carrol's stories, and Edith Nesbit's.  <br>  <br>  I think that a writer's ability to express the feel of a specific period has a lot to do with making his/her works classic.  Making the reader feel extreme emotion for a character also helps.|`|0hxK0khKaa	Hey! I read Alice In Wonderland in 5th grade... It was awesome!<br>  <br>  I like Shakespeare too.

AA11635601	I developed this dreadful fear of heights over a period of about ten years.  By the time I was 35 I couldn't stand to climb a stepladder to change a light bulb.  I was passing-out terrified of heights.  It became incapacitating.<br>  <br>  So I decided to go ahead and feel all the fear there was in that tank until it was all felt.  So I went to a small airport and told the guy to take me up.  I was so terrified I couldn't speak for two hours after.  Wept on and off the rest of the day.  It changed me.   Went back in two weeks, did it again.  Same thing, for two hours was semi-conscious after.  Quaking with fear.  Sitting against the side of a building.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I kept going back and eventually, some ten weeks later I solo'd and became a private pilot.  The fear never abated either!  I was still scared spitless all the time.  What a ripoff!

WaJdOaFKaa	Where did you hear that?  Film and the chemicals used to develop it are all made of materials easily absorbed and biodegraded by the environment - yes, including the film itself, which is NOT plastic, but a textile based material called cellulose acetate which is derived from natural renewable resources (basically, wood pulp), and is biodegradable; the gelatin which suspends the light sensitized emulsion is made from animal bones, and silver nitrates occur naturally or can easily be produced or mixed in solution with other non-toxic minerals and compounds.  And as a matter of fact, the discovery of light sensitive silver salts was a result of an accidental observation of a naturally occurring process.  Actually, compared to other products like car batteries (which contain the most toxic, non-radioactive heavy metal - lead), photographic film is not destructive to the environment, or people, in any way.  And the manufacturing of car batteries are made up of 90% recycled materials themselves.  There are far worse things produced in this country for industry that you aren't even aware of, the lack of which would make it virtually impossible for you to have the privilege of surfing the internet, or even have a job.|`|46IiIKyXaa	so are cell phones, computers, cars, trash, eco-friendly production of any kind & non eco-friendly production of any kind , digital cameras, construction, humans, malls, humans, airplanes, humans, basically every time a baby is born is another drain on the world's resources no matter how "green " a person is.

(Want to see the effects of mercury poisoning? Get the photo essay book "Minamata" by W. Eugene Smith).<br>  <br>  Do you know why auto repair shops charge you a disposal fee for a dead car battery? Because it costs money to properly dispose of them. Same with worn out tires.<br>  <br>  Please edit your question and reference where you got the ridiculous idea that film is destructive to the environment.|`|0qYY7cdzaa	Because all of the components to make film are naturally occurring in the environment so we may as well make film out of them.

saYkDVGlaa	There are two fairly easy suggestions.  Anticipate the spot you want to shoot and pre-set your focus.  If you are looking to get the shot at a particular jump, focus on that point and set your focus to manual.  This will prevent the camera searching for the focus at the crucial moment.  The second is to work on panning.  You simply track the subject until that specific spot and click as it hits that point.<br>  Those two things should improve your images greatly.  Consider a couple other minor things too.  With a 10Mp camera, shoot with a little wider zoom.  This will minimize how the tighter zoom exagerates motion blur.  With 10Mp, you can then crop for the tighter image.  Then basic settings will help.  Set your ISO slightly higher than you would shoot in the same lighting.  This will let you push your shutter speed.  I'm not sure about the image stablilization on the Olympus, but I would turn it off since you will be moving and the camera will likely try to stabilize it causing motion in the system.|`|oq6ofi72aa	What ISO are you using?  Are you shooting outside or inside?  Inside jumping pictures are the hardest.  I have only tried once and didn't get many good pictures and that was with an ISO of 1600.  Outdoor pictures are much easier.  Set the ISO at 200 or 400 and try that.  Make sure to have the aperture open all the way too.  Get as close to the jump as you can since using a zoom lens cuts out some of the light.  Focus on the jump before your sister(s) gets there and push the shutter when they jump.  You have to time it just right.|`|YW9DB6oEaa	Have you tried using a faster shutter speed?  It just sounds like to me that your shutter speed is too slow.

(Particularly, in Italy, the crucial importance of Airborne support. The experience gained in the Italian operations by American Airborne commanders such as Ridgway, Gavin, and Taylor was vital to the success of Overlord). Dieppe achieved nothing at an extremely high price.<br>  This is just my opinion, of course, and other well-informed people may disagree, which is fine.

Over 6,000 infantrymen, predominantly Canadian, were supported by large British naval and Allied air force contingents. The objective was to seize and hold a major port for a short period, both to prove it was possible and to gather intelligence from prisoners and captured materials while assessing the German responses.<br>  <br>  No major objectives of the raid were accomplished. 3,623 of the 6,086 men who made it ashore were either killed, wounded, or captured (almost 60%). The Allied air forces failed to lure the Luftwaffe into open battle, and lost 119 planes, while the Royal Navy suffered 555 casualties. The catastrophe at Dieppe later influenced Allied preparations for Operation Torch and Operation Overlord.

His Philosophi? Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is considered to be the most influential book in the history of science, laying the groundwork for most of classical mechanics.[citation needed] In this work, Newton described universal gravitation and the three laws of motion which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws by demonstrating the consistency between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravitation, thus removing the last doubts about heliocentrism and advancing the scientific revolution.<br>  <br>  In mechanics, Newton enunciated the principles of conservation of both momentum and angular momentum. In optics, he built the first practical reflecting telescope[4] and developed a theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the many colours which form the visible spectrum. He also formulated an empirical law of cooling and studied the speed of sound.<br>  <br>  In mathematics, Newton shares the credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the development of the differential and integral calculus. He also demonstrated the generalised binomial theorem, developed the so-called "Newton's method" for approximating the zeroes of a function, and contributed to the study of power series.<br>  <br>  Newton's stature among scientists remains at the very top rank, as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of scientists in Britain's Royal Society asking who had the greater effect on the history of science, Newton or Albert Einstein. Newton was deemed the more influential.[5]<br>  <br>  Newton was also highly religious (though unorthodox), producing more work on Biblical hermeneutics than the natural science he is remembered for today.|`|TAMdimJkaa	Yes, Issac Newton Lewis did have military experience.Issace Newton  graduated from U.S. Military Academy, West Point, N.Y., in 1884.<br>  Hegraduated from the U.S. Military Academy, West Point, N.Y., in 1884. In 1891 he patented an artillery ranging device, the first of a succession of military inventions, including a ranging system for coastal artillery, an artillery fire-control system, a quick-firing field gun, and a gas-propelled torpedo. He also patented several devices with nonmilitary applications, including an electric car-lighting system. Lewis patented his machine gun in 1911, but it failed to win adoption by the U.S. Army. Retiring from active service in 1913 with the grade of colonel, Lewis went to Europe, where he found immediate interest in the weapon. He built a factory in Liège, Belg., and began manufacturing the gun. With the outbreak of World War I he moved his operation to England, where he merged it with the Birmingham Small Arms Company. Some 100,000 Lewis guns were used by the Allied armies; an adaptation of his gun was especially valuable on airplanes because of its minimal recoil. This advantage finally won it acceptance by the U.S. Army after new tests and considerable controversy<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So to awnser your question yes Issac Newton did have military experience<br>  <br>  ?R0K-Zii?<br>  Hoped I Helped <br>  =]|`|qlscULoiaa	It appears that he was a scholar, period.
wYF6U6qlaa	Nope!  This is not a prologue.  This is your typed-out mind, as a writer, in the process of plot-mapping. <br>  <br>  The information you have in this 'prologue' is a raw outline of your story!  Don't 'tell' us that Clifford has superhuman speed. That's not very interesting Show us a scene where he exhibits that speed, show us all the average humans plodding slowly along in comparison.  Paint us a picture. The Reader doesn't want all the information dumped out in the first two paragraphs. They want to be led along, discovering new things as they go, unraveling secrets, experiencing the story through different scenes with actions and different settings.  That's what makes a story.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm not saying stop writing this, it's a wonderful idea!  What you're doing is a very important part of the writing process - you're getting your ideas down on paper, deciding what the characters are, what will happen.  But it isn't anywhere near a developed story, and it definitely isn't a prologue.|`|kYtZqeIaaa	Its not bad, and I can totally see this becoming something big.<br>  <br>  I think that you should add more and make it flow more a bit to perfect it though.

G2mJppm0aa	Never too late. <br>  Maybe perfessionally though to be honest. <br>  <br>  Pointe shoes come with experience, you have to start on Demi-pointe first, you work on to Pointe from there after your teacher says you can. It's dangerous for your body (You may not see it now, but in a few years you will) to do Pointe without proper training and your teacher supporting you. Demi-pointe you can probably learn online, which you just need the $20 slippers (if you want) or barefoot. <br>  <br>  Discount Dance.com is cheap very good products.|`|AA10065759	It is never too late to learn ballet...<br>  <br>  I don't think you can learn ballet online, you need a<br>  ballet instructor to see your point techniqiue,<br>  how you move your feet, movements, etc.<br>  <br>  - - - -|`|5VziclkJaa	if you're looking for a professional career in ballet, then 14 is probably too late to start (but plenty of magnificent dancers have started at the late age of 12).  however, ballet can help ALL disciplines of dance.  it teaches incredible strength, balance, performance, musicality ect.  ballet is the core strength of most forms of dance. so it can NEVER hurt to learn it, if only to appreciate and extend your knowledge of dance.  i would NOT recommend attempting to learn it online though!!! there could be a SERIOUS risk of injury, due to the complex and personal nature of ballet. each individual person has learn ballet through personal relationships with teachers 1) so as not to injure oneself and 2) to fully understand the nature of doing and performing ballet.<br>  sooo, i would aboslutely and positively recommend ballet if you ever get the chance, just DON'T try to do it on your own.|`|VQLJrTKCaa	it is most definitely not too late to learn ballet! it's never too late for balet :) however...don't just buy pointe shoes and train yourself! if you truly can't afford ballet lessons, my recommendation is to find a friend that is a relatively talented ballerina. get together with her so that she can point out and physically fix your mistakes- videos can't do that! after you feel and she feels that you've made significant progress, talk to your modern teacher (if she is experienced in ballet) or a ballet teacher at your studio. show them what you can do and ask what they think. after that...depends on what your teacher(s) think!|`|7pZuJ70uaa	it is definitely not too late! just practice stretching and practice a lot!<br>  <br>  learning online doesn't ive you the same experience, but it's better then nothing|`|C1ggvgeSaa	fs
XxILKutWaa	That all depends on what *kind* of apprentice company you're looking for, and in what area!<br>  <br>  If you are looking to eventually join a professional ballet company, an apprentice or "second" company is a great place to start. The Joffrey Ballet has a second company, as does ABT. Many regional companies will take you on as a full fledged corps de ballet member off the bat, which is also a great way to gain experience and connections!<br>  <br>  In terms of modern companies, the San Francisco-Bay Area is positively flush with them. If it's more modern you're looking to pursue, check out some of the studios and schools in the area and see what companies and artists are in residence with them. Attend shows, see who and what you like, and you'll have a better sense of what you want. <br>  <br>  Check out the directory at the back of Dance Magazine, which lists really all the companies that are out there. Best of luck!

QMbaeva9aa	Humour: Catch 22 - life of a US squadron stationed on a small island during WWII.<br>  <br>  If you wouldn't mind trying something sci-fi/ fantasy, Terry Pratchett's Discworld series is extremely intelligent and funny. It's definitely -not- "chosen one saves the world in 1000 pages" sort of fantasy. If you decide to give it a go, start with Mort (who becomes Death's apprentice) or Small Gods (story of a young monk who finds his god trapped in the body of a turtle). They're among my favourites. It does take a few books to understand the world, but order doesn't matters.<br>  <br>  Something modern would be Sergei Lukyanenko's World of Watches series (modern day fantasy), though from your question it seems you don't look too fondly upon books with almost-plothole loose ends ;)<br>  <br>  A Clockwork Orange is an awesome piece of dystopian lit, as is 1984.|`|5uzHW4CYaa	Survivor - Chuck Palahniuk<br>  A man telling his life story into an indestructible voice box on an airplane about to crash into the Australian outback.<br>  <br>  Invisible Monsters - Chuck Palaniuk<br>  When she realizes that her past is nothing but a story, she begins to reinvent herself, from scratch. "If I can't be beautiful, I want to be invisible" was something she said. <br>  <br>  Those are my two favorites from that author. He also wrote Fight Club. They're humorous in a sick, dark and sarcastic way. Hope I helped.|`|M0bE2IBQaa	Not exactly what you're looking for, but you might like Chuck Palahniuk's 'Invisible Monsters'. It deals with some issues along with Palahniuk's dark humor. It's the same guy that wrote 'Fight Club' (another incredibly great book). Sorry if I wasn't much of a help. <br>  <br>  Maybe you should also try 'The Kite Runner' by Khaled Hosseini. It's a great book. It provides a sense of traditional Afghan lifestyle, and culture. The four main themes shown to us by the author are strength of character, sin and redemption, relationship between parent and child, as well as Loyalty and friendship between two certain people in the book.<br>   <br>   'A Thousand Splendid Suns' by Khaled Hosseini. The novel opens with the introduction of Mariam, an ethnic Hazara and Afghan girl growing up in a small village on the outskirts of Herat.<br>  <br>  'The Road' by Cormac McCarthy. This book tells the story of a father-son journey toward the sea and an uncertain salvation. <br>  <br>  'Cannery Row' by John Steinbeck. It revolves around the people living there during the Great Depression: The novel nostalgic, comical, and sad.<br>  <br>  'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' is still very humorous.<br>  <br>  'Deadline' by Chris Crutcher. A high schooler named Ben is given the medical diagnosis of one year to live. So he decides to fulfill his greatest fantasies, ponders his life's purpose and legacy, and converses through dreams with a spiritual guide known as "Hey-Soos."<br>  <br>  'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian' by Sherman Alexie. I haven't read this book, but from what I've heard, it's a fairly funny story.|`|wTkvkWscaa	Why not Twilight? You don't like bad writing and boring plots? You're crazy!<br>  <br>  These are all kind of shots in the dark, because you didn't give much information. Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh is one of my favorites.

I've never read American Psycho, but I'm assuming it's good because the movie was pretty damn good. I've read Less Than Zero by him, and it was really good. So maybe check that out. 1984 by George Orwell is a must-read.

Try some of his work. You might even enjoy Kurt Vonnegut, Stephen King, and William Faulkner, though Faulkner's style is a little more...intricate, I guess is the word. <br>  <br>  If you've never read Faulkner before, though, start with "As I Lay Dying" before you move on to his other work, like "Absalom, Absalom!"|`|862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	Try Kurt Vonnegut.

I could end up being a novel that covers his whole life from when he was young to up untill he died (either by old age or by whatever is making him crazy).<br>  <br>  If none of that helped, try google searching mentill illnesses. they'll be plenty of disorder there that slowly show up over time.

2HETgiwgaa	The prosecution have to prove actus reus (the physical part of the crime - the application of force causing his death) and mens rea (the mental part - the intention to kill - assuming the charge is murder).   Have a look at each part of the law that she's being charged under (Act, section etc) - and pull it apart into its component bits so you can think about how to defend her.  Remember - innocent til proven guilty - so they are the ones that have to prove something to the court - you can just challenge their case, you don't need to put Mary on the stand.<br>  <br>  You can challenge the lack of physical evidence - the police ate the roast lamb - so where's their murder weapon?<br>  <br>  Do they have any samples of frozen lamb bits from the body? - if not you can just argue they have no evidence of what the murder weapon was or that Mary had access to it - and when did she have a chance to dispose of it.<br>  <br>  She has a partial alibi - she went to the grocers - so they can't prove she was necessarily in the house when it happened.<br>  <br>  Also - her mind - heavily pregnant and with an (if I remember rightly) unfaithful husband - she didn't have capacity to form the requisite intent for murder.  Provocation - maybe????<br>  <br>  But - you'll have to decide what stance you are taking - can't argue both she didn't do the physical part and she didn't have the requisite intent - decide which is your strongest case - and run with it. <br>  <br>  You are entitled to disclosure of the prosecution case - their evidence, witnesses, etc - that will help, too - especially since you don't have to tell them anything about your case (except, in some jurisdictions, you do have to tell them if you are putting up an alibi defence - and certain other defences - e-mail me for more if you need it).<br>   <br>  Reasonable doubt is all you need.

If you feel like writing a story, for goodness sake sweetie, quit waiting on responses from Yahoo! Answers and get down to writing one! (look at the clown who posted above me ... do you really think that person has anything to teach you?) Read a lot, and keep track of what makes you want to keep reading and what makes you want to put down the book in boredom.  Then, when the next inspiration hits, write another story.  Then another.  You'll become better with each story, I promise, even if your first tries are so boring and awful you want to rip them to pieces.|`|AHuBqplbaa	Write about anything that you care about.

I haven't read many vampire books, but it kind of depends on your age.<br>  For tweens and teenagers I would like to recommend 'The Clique Series'. It's a series of books about friendship, etc. It's actually really interesting.<br>  The Harry Potter series is good also, if you're into fantasy and fiction. The Once and Future King was a great book. I just finished reading it. It's just written so beautifully, but very hard to understand. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you would really like to attempt reading it.<br>  Other books I recommend:<br>  - The Seventh Tower Series<br>  - Lord of the Rings Series<br>  - Children's Homer<br>  - The Golden Fleece<br>  - Talent<br>  - The Vampire Diaries<br>  <br>  -Megan|`|xv7YlV29aa	people that love twilight, loved Harry Potter also. Um theres a vampire series that I like, its called 'The Vampire Diaries' and I'm pretty sure that L.J Smith wrote them. She also has a witch series that I like better. Its called  'The Secret Circle' When I read that series I could not put the book down. There cute. BUT they are not as long as Twilight, not at all. There are 4 books I think.<br>  <br>  Also Diana Palmer is a good writer, she is romance, but there not vampires. And Jude deveroux is my favorite author. Another person that writes romance. Not vampires, but she does write a lot of stories where enemies fall in love. I'm pretty sure that the series is called<br>  'Velvet'   all of the books has the word Velvet in them. Velvet Angel is my favorite.|`|vXzIv8GXaa	i really recommend the house of night series by p.c. cast and kirsten cast. its a "coming of age" novel because it does have intimate content and lots of cussing. it is about vampires but when i read it it kept me flipping pages.<br>  <br>  another i like is the uglies series by scott westerfeld. they are very good and they are in the future. it kept me flipping pages. <br>  <br>  i like the protector of the small series by tamora pierce. i thought i wouldnt like them at first but they were pretty amazing.<br>  <br>  i know you dont really want a vampire book but there are some really good ones out there but some really bad ones. i also like the vampire kisses series by ellen schreiber. they are kinda short books but she still has to release a few more.<br>  <br>  i hoped this help another fellow book reader. :-)|`|V0R9GAPkaa	dude totally read city of bones 20 milions times better than twilight[twilight is kinda stupid , i think it would be better if it was just a romance not a mythical thing even though i read the whole thing]|`|7gQVNuk4aa	Well I didn't enjoy Twilight all that much. But I do know that Stephanie Meyer's other book called The Host is really good. And if you're looking for a good vampire series, then look into the Blue Bloods series. They're really good. I also like the Uglies series by Scott Westerfield. They don't have to do anything with vampires, but it's a good, well-written series overall.<br>  <br>  And if you're into fantasy novels, then you should definitely read books by Cornelia Funke such as The Thieflord, Inkheart, Inkspell, etc. They're extremely good.<br>  <br>  Oh gosh! How could I forget? Harry Potter, of course! If you haven't read them yet, then I would definitely recommend them. I'm a bit obsessed with them...|`|pX0yPZlyaa	Fat Girl is another good book.

He did not want to go on an unknown land so he turned back. 40 years later Leif landed at New Found Land. They made a small settlement but the natives kept attacking so after a couple years they left. <br>  <br>  I think Columbus is because he found the Americas and this lead to people settleing it sucessfully|`|iJzIIEdfaa	There are more Italian Americans than Viking Americans|`|6pksPo7Zaa	I thought he was.

lDSUQyvIaa	Watch an old western, they show plenty of examples of people pretending to be shot and falling down dead. If you can get away with it, see if you can use an airsoft gun. They sting but it'll help the dramatics greatly.<br>  <br>  If a nurse was there, they'd be holding a gun. Battlefield medicine at the time was an afterthought, something you did when the battle was over. If you want to try it, have the nurse dragging off the wounded because medicine during a battle at that time was basically unheard of.
RSUYs8Mzaa	Strictly speaking, judging these in terms of importance isn't possible in broad terms. Essentially the order goes like this:<br>  <br>  The Agricultural Revolution started in the late seventeenth century or so, primarily in England through the Enclosure Acts. Between privatizing what had once been common land and technological advancements in the field of agriculture, not only were farms more productive but also required fewer hands and displaced numerous individuals who in turn moved to the cities. Combined with a population boom, this led to an increased demand of goods such as textiles which was sated by the earliest forms of factories. <br>  <br>  As demand grew, some visionaries or risk takers began employing new technology and new methodology for production of goods, leading in the mid- or late-18th century to the Industrial Revolution and the formation of real factories. Factories, by providing unprecedented amounts of goods and jobs, helped continue the process of urbanization in which people moved from the fields to the cities, which grew more densely crowded than ever before. Unfortunately, exploitation by factory owners, unsafe work conditions, and very poor living conditions in general led to significant discontent among this new class of urban laborers. This occasionally boiled over into riots and the like, and forward-thinking politicians saw that need for reform.<br>  <br>  Thus, throughout the nineteenth century and accelerating going into the twentieth, political reforms began to come into place both to protect workers and to improve their living conditions. Granted increasing representation meant increasing amounts of political power, and a notable shift away from the old hereditary aristocracy and into the bourgeois merchantry, a state that basically remains even today.<br>  <br>  This is just a very broad overview, of course. The Agricultural Revolution probably lasted the longest, as it progressed over the course of about two hundred years (say, 1680 to 1880); the Industrial Revolution lasted about a hundred and fifty years (perhaps 1750 to 1900) and the "Political Revolution" maybe a century (1800 to 1900, give or take). Exactly what marks the beginning and end points of them is going to differ from person to person.<br>  <br>  In terms of importance, since each built on the previous one, it is simple enough to say that the Agricultural Revolution was the most important - without that, the others would have been impossible. Unfortunately, this ignores how profoundly the Industrial and Political Revolutions affected the lives we now live, far beyond what the Agricultural Revolution alone would have achieved.

5wg7tKc6aa	My concern is (and it is a very biased concern), the TV series, though it could be played out in a way that could attract several fans, will not do the job properly.  The issue is this: $$$.  Knowing Fantasy, the series would drain your pockets faster than you can say "I need to go to the bank."<br>  <br>  I'd suggest dividing the story into three parts: create yourselves a trilogy.  Those are extremely popular, and you tend to gain life-long fans based on the first film.<br>  <br>  If you had the money to make amazing, detailed, special effects used everywhere TV show, then I'd say "Power to ya!"  But you may only have a limited amount of fans... as TV presents shows on channels targeted to specific age groups... so, it may not hit EVERYONE, the way the movie could.<br>  <br>  I'd go with the movie.<br>  <br>  And, here's the biased part...

u0zEutf1aa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a very good book. I admit that I don't love it as much as some do, but it made me think, and it says a lot about human nature.<br>  <br>  I LOVED Pride and Prejudice. I had some trouble with it at first and thought the writing was too formal, but later I reread it and fell in love with it. Mr. Darcy is a fantastic character--smart, good with words, interesting, but not without his flaws--and I love the conversations between him and Lizzy.<br>  <br>  I haven't read PS: I Loathe You, but I've read the first Clique book. It was okay, but not really my type. The characters are catty and unrelatable to, and the story is overdramatic. It's a good read for a laugh, but not much else.<br>  <br>  Wuthering Heights is fantastic. Basically, Cathy and Heathcliff love eachother, but Cathy marries Edgar Linton, so Heathcliff plots to take his revenge on Edgar and his family. I love it because it's so unlike the typical story--the main characters are both cruel people, but at the same time, in such passionate love.<br>  <br>  I read You Don't Know Me several years ago. I liked it. John has a great inner voice. Parts were funny, parts were sad, parts were shocking. It's an honest book with a great narrator.<br>  <br>  I really need to reread A Wrinkle in Time; I haven't read it since fifth grade. I don't remember it all that well, but I did like it; the author created a very creative fantasy universe. Its sequels, A Wind at the Door and A Swiftly Tilting Planet, were also wonderful.<br>  <br>  ?M?|`|6XhqzE7Xaa	You will love Pride and Prejudice.

556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	Seriously?<br>  <br>  Use a meditative/hypnotic method to establish a voluntary "group mind" among people on earth.  Sort of like taking Jung's "collective unconscious" and waking it up, making it conscious and alive in people's minds.<br>  <br>  It would be voluntary, but it would also be a contagious thing, so that the *possibility* of participation would spread to every last man, woman and child on the planet.  This is important...the only realistic way one can create a "utopian" Earth is by way of getting people to see past their individual passions and differences, such that humanity is no longer violent towards itself (outside of needed self-defense, mind you).  We need to establish a sort of ground-level, universal empathy or value system by which *everyone* can be accepted, without regard to culture, class, language or faith.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I think Brasil's urban culture comes close to this, at least in terms of accepting people in spite of economic class and racial differences....but then I see the shanty towns, the violence, and see things are still flawed.  People still want to dominate one another and there's too little empathy for the fallen and dominated.<br>  <br>  And yeah, I know.  I'm working on it, but making things contagious is a problem...not to mention expanding things outside of my own narrow niche.  So to speak.<br>  <br>  But that's the answer: awaken in mankind a unity of mind, such that warfare and crime become impossible since everyone has the same ground-level conscience.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|HyknijLxaa	I know this is a boring answer, but if i was to create a perfect world then life would be too easy and too boring so i wouldn't create a Utopia if i had the chance.

People are people and thus quite different. One person's utopia is another's hell. People need challenge and adversity to survive but too much is worse than not enough.  Just to make things more complex as people age what is utopia for them will change. <br>  <br>  So a utopia is a society where people can drift into different areas that reflect their beliefs. It's not perfect as nothing wrought by man will ever be perfect. An example, a sibling decides they want to be a gladiator and get's killed in that pursuit. While the deceased didn't mind it still pains the siblings. A malfunction happens and kills a dozen people. Those who lost loved ones would be deeply blanked in grief. Just not possible to always be gah gah happy. However society doesn't have to be oppressive to anybody. We have the means and technology to build society which is quite customized to individuals and allows for people to move up, down, sideways and to pursue their own unique ideal of happiness as long as it doesn't interfere with others ability to do the same.

LOtePNWDaa	One who does not know that an idea exists is the same as one who knows it exists but does not practice it. The effort of both are inherently the same, to keep oneself willingly ignorant, or to resist the temptation of the known and all prevalent. For either, it takes a great amount of willpower, and asks the question: Would one rather know absolute truth and be forced to keep it to themselves their whole lives, or rather live out their entire lives, never knowing or having to carry the burden upon their back?<br>  <br>  The answer my friend, is only up to you to decide. It is not an answerable question. It is one that simply asks ; who you are.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Well some of us didn't CHOOSE that option but had it thrust upon us by circumstance (i.e. sexual dysfunction.)<br>  <br>  But having no sex life certainly makes you less fcuked.|`|2PTlXs9zaa	Yes. Sometimes forces in life are greater than yourself, and you must accept things how they are for the time being. That is actually a really superb way to get to know yourself well, and be happy with it.|`|qdlmy4l8aa	I'm celibate; I have been for 4 years. <br>  <br>  I'm unhappy, but for reasons not having anything to do with sex, rather, the lack thereof.<br>  <br>  I was MORE unhappy when I was having sex. (Un)happiness is far too dependent on other things (and the way in which you interpret and DEAL with them) than to have celibacy as the sole culprit.|`|AA12134591	Yes<br>  For me..it works best in ten day stretches at the maximum<br>  then, there is a need for a "respite" from this pursuit for a couple of days.... Then, one can begin again from zero.....  <br>  Because, if one takes this pursuit beyond the ten days<br>  ..you begin to get all kinds of crazy ideas and your sleep<br>  patterns get hazy.... you start getting odd attractions to <br>  really strange things... like wet glass and stuff.... you know...<br>  Calibacy in long term doses can really mess you up !!<br>  It causes people to fall in love with books and things !!<br>  <br>  ? ////|`|511e8b445adfad2d427229e044071fa1aa	Why do people choose celibacy? I'm curious. Is it religious? <br>  <br>  <br>  Obviously, no. I do not think someone can be completely happy.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	I seriously doubt it.<br>  "God, grant me chastity, but not yet." - St Augustine|`|q3KCDrMAaa	It depends on why they chose it. If they chose it for any other reason outside of just plain old being disgusted, then the celibacy will make them nuts.<br>  <br>  If someone chooses to be celibate because of religion or because they are married to someone who doesn't want sex then they will become kind of deprived, because this celibacy is not of their choosing.<br>  <br>  If they choose to be celibate because they realize that humans can be pigs and have sex with them without love (if that's what they are looking for) or they know people are having sex with them just to get off and they want no part of that, then they will be happy.|`|G6Uy43coaa	I am celibate but did not chose this lifestyle for any other reason than...I'm not a ho.  I don't just sleep around for the sake of having sex.  I have no compulsion, no mental disorder which I can defer to for an  explanation for sleeping around.  I want a sexual relationship...not an encounter but an actual relationship but I have no partner yet so I am celibate.  Things will change for me soon and I will no longer be celibate.  It just takes time for me to get to know someone and then I need to decide if he is worth giving up a couple years of celibacy for.  I have a couple prospects and things are looking up !  No pun intended...|`|AA11488628	ya know i would say that some can. some people don't have a sex drive but these people are very few. we are programed to have sex and to be in relationships for the purpose of procreation and then taking care of the children. but yeah a person can be happy. it takes all kinds of people|`|3c5f2316d7b180d5f45a6448d9b9def0aa	Some people are just less sexual than others (though I think sex is a huge part of living a fulfilled life); if it's a conscious choice by an adult, I don't see why people who choose it, can't be happy.|`|VtToRnykaa	Only if they are asexual. <br>  <br>  I think it's very weird...I often wonder if those people are one step away from snapping and killing a busload of nuns.|`|AA11726497	Yes.|`|UBgRugMgaa	That's me, and I'm in between with my perspective|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...yes, they get it all from their belief...
pYe3kkgNaa	Have you tried 'Google Books'?<br>  they will give you a preview of the book and maybe some writings about it...
cC7TScJRaa	well if you want to mix it up a bit, you can play around with fonts, and use your own words and such, or even pair it will a simple design like you said you normally draw.  A good font site I always use is dafont.com.<br>  <br>  i wouldn't call yourself a terrible artist, everyone starts somewhere.  Maybe using the gridding method would help you try more complex drawings.  By the gridding method I mean where you make boxes over the picture you want to draw, say on the computer, and then apply the same grid to the paper you're drawing it on.  This helps you do it box by box.  You also might be able to find where they sell the translucent grids-i got one from my art teacher.<br>  <br>  as for pictures of simple drawings, since I don't really know what you're interested in, or other drawings you've done, I'd say your best bet would be to play around on google images until you find something you like! :]
ugiUyhOwaa	Hmm...<br>  <br>  You know what? I also like Jace for Clary. But that 'family relation' complication really messed up everything. <br>  <br>  I think that Clary is her mother's daughter. I'm quite sure of that. But I'm not quite sure of Valentine as her father. There's something wrong in it but I cannot really pin point what it is.<br>  <br>  For Jace, I don't know. I really do wish that Valentine just mistaken him as his own son. I don't know... I just really hope he and Clary will end up together.<br>  <br>  But I found this for Cassandra Clare's blog. I think that there is still some hope for the two of them.<br>  <br>  ?I just got to the end of City of Bones and I am so upset about Jace and Clary! Why???<br>  <br>  "At the risk of spoiling anyone, all I can say is that it's more than just a twist; if you're really invested in Jace and Clary, you shouldn't give up on them yet -- there's still a lot to come in their future, a lot of surprises about their history, and plenty more developments in the Jace/Clary/Simon love triangle." <br>  <br>  Plus, there's also a new character that will make their love story more complicated-Sebastian.<br>  <br>  ?Who's Sebastian?<br>  <br>  "Sebastian is a new character in City of Glass. He's a Shadowhunter. He's a cousin of the Penhallows, who are friends of the Lightwoods', and who the Lightwoods are staying with in Idris. He gets in between Jace and Clary."<br>   <br>  Well, I think all we can do is to wait for the third book in the Mortal Instruments Trilogy, City of Glass.<br>  <br>  :)|`|wD82XTTHaa	i go for clary and jace  but keep reading to the end of city of ashes there needs to be more to finish the story so much needs to happen im so excited 3.24.09 city of glass|`|vDjQFRp1aa	I also like Clary and Jace together and really don't think their siblings. (Atleast that's what I'm really hoping for in the third book). Their family history just seems so messed up that there is a strong possibility that there not sibling. It seems this Sebastian character will bring for light into the relationship. I can't wait for the 3rd book next month :)
MQmDYavkaa	That was the bit of the Horcrux that was destroyed when Voldemort tried to kill Harry. It was a tiny fragment of Voldy's soul, and was flayed and ugly because it was split and incomplete.

AA11119924	Yes, Jewish Doctors did work in the camps. They were screened by the Nazis and identified as physicians. They were ordered to serve as physicians to the inmates and no special privileges were allowed them. They were not permitted to work alongside German Doctors and most times had scant or no help from the Germans. They were forced to report able bodied patients for assignment to work details and if they disobeyed the rules were put into the work force and eventually killed. Refusal to cooperate brought certain death. The Doctors who were the most compassionate and helpful to the prisoners were treated better by their fellow prisoners and protected as well as was possible but most died the same as their patients from starvation, privation, disease, brutal captivity, and sadistic murder.|`|O9vDZkqIaa	There is no uniform response that would apply to all camps.  Doctors working in forced labour camps had to maintain the health of the slave labourers for the factories on whom the German war effort depended.  They were subject to the same conditions in terms of food and housing, but did not have to do heavy labour in the same way as some of the prisoners.  Death camps like Treblinka were different.  In these cases the doctors were put to death along with everyone else if they were unfortunate enough not to have been selected for other purposes before deportation.|`|b5i0r3sAaa	wooooow, nat. ur seriously doing this??? hahahaha. did jewish doctors work in camps? try googling it!|`|7KcVSB3Uaa	In addition to what everyone else said, it's important to note that doctors were often exempted from deportation. They were considered vital, and because Jews had the reputation of being the best doctors, many were spared to continue tending to the German wealthy.|`|GaHkxtU9aa	Read the story about Miklós Nyiszli, a Hungarian Jewish Doctor at Auschwitz who was deported to Auschwiz along with his wife and young daughter in June 1944. <br>  <br>  On arrival, Nyiszli volunteered himself as a doctor and was sent to work at number 12 barracks where he operated on and tried to help ill patients with the barest of medical supplies and tools. <br>  <br>  He was under the supervision of Josef Mengele, an SS Officer and Physician, who decided after observing Nyiszli’s skills, to move him to a specially built room whose construction had been facilitated to cater for the carrying out of autopsies, primarily, but also any other required operations.<br>  <br>  Like the sonderkommando, those that retrieved the bodies from the crematorium, life for Jewish doctors would have been a bit more protected from the daily realities of beatings, death - but like the sonderkommando a jewish doctor could be executed at any time. <br>  <br>  His book, An Eyewitness from Auschwitz is actually a very good read.

Playing up and down the fretboard untill you wear your fingers out and make them tired to build up endurance and to build up the calluses on your fingertips.  Start out by setting down before you try to learn standing up.  Go out to a guitar shop and pick up some guitar lessons for begginers and study the books to try to make yourself better.  You could pay 500 bucks for a fretlight guitar.  That's good for begginers too.  The only bad part is you pay for the songs.

Gxc98UKMaa	i think its quite good. but the first verse is too literal compared to the rest of the poem. the vocabulary is really good, and i like that it is vague and can be interpreted in many ways.<br>  <br>  i think u should change the first verse to something that describes your feelings about the rest of the poem. <br>  <br>  "They will get what they want and down I will be sent" - i would maybe go deeper into that idea, but using the first verse, so that the reader has to read the poem to understand it as you want them to.|`|v0FlUan0aa	sofa king long...<br>  <br>  BUT i liked some parts. <br>  "So many ways to go<br>  Predictions versus dreams<br>  What will come is unknown<br>  Everything not what it seems"<br>  <br>  ^^ those are my favorite lines! :]<br>  <br>  its pretty good!!|`|a8c86432a8a5add7fcbf2436c1c53a6daa	its really good. i like it.. its like perfect :]|`|ncEDkLaraa	I think it is very good because it is your thoughts and your feelings, however if you are looking for constructive criticism, half the time you rhyme, half the time you don't.

AA11114869	I, as well as just about anyone with any years behind them at all, have pondered the eventuality of death. That said, it's been my experience that most will audaciously claim that they are NOT afraid of death.<br>  I feel the vast majority of them are being more than just a little disingenuous with that claim...<br>  <br>  ...Everyone Will Die...<br>  So, - given that fact, why is it that most people find the idea of their eventual demise, to some degree, - disturbing?<br>  <br>  Perhaps the fear lies not so much in 'death' itself but, rather,... in just how and/or when one will go about 'dying'?<br>  <br>  Many will say that they "Don't fear The Reaper"...<br>  ...and, who knows, --- maybe they don't.<br>  <br>  But deep down inside, whether they will admit it or not, - is the fear of His 'Scythe',... for no one ever knows how sharp or dull the blade on that Scythe will be when Death comes to reap their soul with it.<br>  -|`|CLB32006aa	death is boring, life is the interesting part :)|`|AA10286634	I have my own crypt.

Keep your mind on the game of life. Make everything you do fun (its not what you do but how you do it and especially how you think about it). Its good to recall that life is short, but don't dwell on it, make the most of your time in the game cause you don't know when the buzzer is going to sound and someone else will come in to replace you.

REUqZfSeaa	No the world will not end in 2012. <br>  <br>  2012 was chosen for the end of the world by the Mayans because on December 21, there will be an alignment between the Earth, the Sun and the middle of the Galaxy (the Milky Way). The Mayans and some other people believed that monumental changes would occur on Earth as a result of this. However modern science has shown that only our perspective on Earth will change, not the Earths position in the Galaxy. This will not be the first time that this event has occurred, and the Earth managed to survive last time, there is every reason to believe that the outcome will be the same this time.<br>  <br>  Some New Age believers think that a new age will begin on that date and that humans will enter an age of spiritual transformation. This of course remains to be seen.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't spend time worrying about it, just enjoy living!<br>  <br>  I hope that this makes you feel better!|`|8WqTvPBbaa	No the world will not end in 2012 that's a bunch of crap.|`|t2059Apeaa	As to the Mayan calendar's accuracy so far, I'm not sure, but as to the world ending in 2012: No.  The quickest way to find a false prophet is to find someone who claims to know when it all will end.  No one does.  If I'm lucky, a bunch of nuts will sell me everything they have for great discounts, and all go up on a hill to await the second coming.  I'll cash in on their stuff.  I'll be retiring about then; this will be a windfall.  Sorry for the crass cynicism, but we poor humans routinely get hooked into stuff like this.
XOZ475oQaa	You will learn quicker with a teacher and lessons but that hasn't stopped me. I've had to teach myself how to get better after the 6th grade and im a lot better than i was then. I would have to say the time depends on how determined you are to learn. For instance when i had to start teaching my self i ended up sitting and practicing the piano for 3 hours each day. But now that im almost a Senior in HS and taking AP classes i cant find time to do that anymore.<br>  <br>  It all depends on how much time you have on your hands, determination, and will power.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!!|`|0AUPrCMZaa	you can find a keyboard for around 100-500 probably.<br>  <br>  digital piano around 1000-3000<br>  <br>  if you want a wooden one (only problem with a real one, you have to get it tuned)....you can check the classifieds, chances are you can get one for free if you find some one to haul it.<br>  <br>  keyboard and piano are the same thing.  usually a piano is 88 keys though....but technically no different.<br>  <br>  yeah if you play keyboard you can play piano.<br>  <br>  a digital piano is just a way to make an electronic version that is more like a real piano to the touch and sound...and it doesnt have all the fake instruments that a keyboard has.<br>  <br>  oh and about the time....different for everyone...but if you really want to learn how to play, you shouldnt be worried about how long it will take you.... if you do... you might give up on it because you are comparing yourself to everyone else....  one of my major mistakes... always wishing i started younger.<br>  <br>  oh and again, you should take lessons...that way you wont pick up any bad habits and the instructor will keep you in motion and moving forward.  you will learn quicker with a teacher.|`|DbbuQpTFaa	The keyboard is the same as the piano.<br>  <br>  There are different types of pianos, all at different price ranges.  Such as spinet, console, studio, grand.  They get more expensive.  You can find a cheap spinet for about $800, but the better Upright ones will cost around $2000.  Then there are the really fancy ones that cost over $10,000 -- mostly Grand pianos.<br>  <br>  If you need to teach yourself, you should start with a beginner's book which you can probably find at a music store or on Amazon or a piano website.
G2mJppm0aa	Get involve with your school more, and try out for cheer and/or a dance team if you can, and start looking online now to scholarships you can apply for.

qgs155HNaa	The number system was an invention of T. E. Mionnet, one of the earlier writers of a general catalog of all Roman coins.  In his works there is a chart which shows diameters of coins according to a graduated scale.<br>  <br>  You can get copies of his books in .pdf format from  <a href="http://books.google.com" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com</a>|`|JS3Zy6ASaa	I have an auction catalogue next to me, so let's have a look.

0xekiwHQaa	There are LOTS of books that end in tragedy. Why do you think that everything is a happy ending? Maybe it's just the books _you_ are reading. <br>  <br>  I read books with sad endings (in a romance, one of them or both of them die) and I read books with happy endings (they get together, after many things get in the way). If it's a good book, I'll read it. <br>  <br>  It's not just about them winning or losing. It's about _how_ they won or _how_ they lost. That's the whole point of plot. There are twists, cliffhangers, foreshadows, surprises, etc.The ending isn't all that matters. What they do to get there is also important, and how many people/things were lost in the process.|`|E9KYlG9kaa	In most all books about animals, the animal dies and I just keep coming back for more.  I always cry and I know they will probably die at the end but I love their legacies.<br>  <br>  So...yes.|`|1jMwr6E0aa	perhaps I'm not understanding your concept. The main character dies in a quest for something. This character inspires someone else to fulfill their legacy? Would this be in one book or a series? I think its interesting if I have the concept correct. I've read a lot worse trust me. I think this would be difficult to do in one book. Perhaps your first book can be about the first character and at the end they die to lead you into a sequel where someone tries to pick up where they left off. I do hate the predictablility of characters as well. Read some Chuck Palahniuk even if you think you know the plot twist you're bound to be wrong.|`|5wg7tKc6aa	The books aren't getting predictable, you're mind is just subconsciously advancing to the point where you recognize story lines.  The same goes with movies, and TV shows... you can predict what happens because you've been storing little hints in your mind since you began watching these things.  Your mind has been trained to spot things, and recognize other things.<br>  <br>  If you'd never read a book before, and read THE most predictable book you've ever read at this point in time, you'd be shocked at how well done it was.|`|A6ylS5bJaa	I'm with you 100% percent. I like this question- I'll star it when I'm done. I just had a conversation about this. Noone has the guts to kill of their main character- amke they guy and girl NOT get together- stray off the beaten path. <br>  I'm a writer, I'm writing a novel, and, "I- I took the road less traveled by, and that has made all the difference." Robert Frost.I'm trying to keep it outside the tiny little box.|`|EImjExb7aa	oh yes! i want to see a non cliche book, especially when the guy and girl dont get together. i mean, its about time a book like that came out..lol, is there a novel like this?<br>  <br>  <br>  but the idea that the person takes on the challenge could be interesting.
TAIlyvgyaa	Well, you asked what we thought.  You might not like what you hear;<br>  <br>  The first 5 sentences are terrible, short and stuttering, they sound like something a small child would write, I think you might be aiming for sense of urgency or something with that, but it really doesn't work at all.<br>  <br>  You refer to the Shana character as 'Shana' and as 'Mom/mother' while speaking in the first person of the same character, that is terribly confusing.<br>  <br>  You do the short, chopped in half sentences again from the end of the telephone call, it doesn't work any better there either.<br>  <br>  When you call 911, they do not answer with 'Hello?'.  Nor do they ask for nothing other than an address.  Make sure you can keep your work realistic.  I don't suggest that you call 911 to hear what they say, but if you write to a 911 operator centre and tell them what you are writing about, they will tell you what would happen in that call.  This is vital for good writing, all authors of any merit do research to keep the details authentic.<br>  <br>  If you are serious about your writing, you will accept honest criticism and work on your weaknesses, in order to allow your strengths to shine through.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|swxiulwtaa	I can tell your a twilight fan<br>  this is a story about vampires isn't it?|`|UJKF7LKiaa	PleasePleasePlease change the address.<br>  <br>  <br>  Other than that it was pretty good.<br>  Interesting.<br>  Just work on the grammar a little.<br>  <br>  <br>  Especially the "eyes deathly white."<br>  That didn't make sense.<br>  Does that mean she has no color in her irises in pupil, or was it just a screw up?<br>  Anyways, it was interesting.<br>  Good job :)|`|5wg7tKc6aa	The only problem is that it's obviously in reference to Twilight... but I'll admit, I was captivated.<br>  <br>  You have an interesting way of writing.  If you could work on your grammar and punctuation, then you'd have an excellent chance at writing a vampire novel.  Don't make it SO similar that one could easily be distracted by the address... make it... different (if it's possible).|`|1413O50Baa	it is a good paragraph. It must also have to do with TWILIGHT. My opinion is that her mother should change into a vampire and then at the end the nararator should have to kill her. And then it would show her love to her mother.|`|0xekiwHQaa	Er... :)<br>  <br>  Your sentences are way too short. You need to combine them. <br>  And your dialogue could use a lot of work. I stopped after "I saw her fingers twing." Is twing even a word? <br>  <br>  Remember, never give up.
5nfqY9T7aa	It's pretty bad.|`|wKSvnna2aa	I agree it doesn't live up to the hype. I too am an avid reader. If you like a very unique and clever romance, try OUTLANDER by Diana Gabaldon. That one was amazing. I'm also a huge fan of Pride and Prejudice and Harry Potter by the way.|`|KicD3JZSaa	I only read the series to get a grade in my English class.<br>  I completely agree. The author uses the words "snarl" and "marble" about three million times in the series. I think we should send her a thesaurus.|`|SiPGcBnYaa	haha that's right|`|KfeeV5nraa	i hav nvr read it but it seems like it routs ur brain|`|mePPZXAsaa	Yeah the worst series completely. <br>  I recommend J.R.

Its a true series. <br>  And Lynsay Sands the Argeneau Vampire Series.<br>  The Mediator Series<br>  Tamora Pierce is excellent<br>  Hannah Howell is good too. <br>  Stephanie Meyer's book made me want to commit violence it was so boring!! It lacked everything. I tried to read the whole series but it was so repepitive- Bella is special- clumsy- in this series vampires are infertile yet the ever so special Bella got ******* knocked up. Yeah that makes so much sense.

5wg7tKc6aa	She could be punished for going against God's wishes; maybe his wishes for Angels were to be the hidden guardians for every Earth child- but perhaps she wasn't there in a dire time of need for her Earth child, or perhaps he saw her... which could be considered against his wishes.  So, she was stripped of her greatest privilage: wings, and angel-hood; given a single month to be rewarded that very same privilage, and in that month, she attends high school with her Earth child... <br>  <br>  Go from there.<br>  <br>  It could end with her having to go back against her will, for now, the greatest privilage is not having wings- and being Gods angel, but being the real friend of an Earth child- the privilage to live.|`|1jMwr6E0aa	Well what did she do to get punished at all? Perhaps the crime and the punishment need to be related. For instance have you ever seen Shallow Hal? Hal is a jerk who only cares about people on the surface so he gets a punishment of only seeing the inner beauty in people. Perhaps your crime and punishment should also be related.<br>  <br>  Perhaps she questioned God's choices for her. Suppose he talks to her and tells her something she doesn't want to hear and she questions his omnipotence and infallibility. As punishment he strips her wings and makes her human. Setting into motion a series of events with this gentlemen who ever he may be, and actually fulfilling the role that God warned her she would in the first place. Say this man isn't a believer and she has to convince him otherwise for example. Oh and if she died in the 1900s disease would be an easy way for her to do so.|`|RIjjgex0aa	Just a tip, figure out how you want the story to end before you start the beginning or you may ramble on for pages.

0Dj8pOgoaa	Im selling on micro stocks but also on macro stocks.... Im using: istock, shutterstock, dreamstime, fotolia, 123rf.... and thats 5 stock agencies you wanna mess with... anyother stock agencies lge bigstock, or stockspert are not worthy... wasting a time.... Im doing stocks for about 2 years... incomes are different... used to be very nice on shutterstock  $300-$500 a month now if I have $100 Im happy its all about submitting new pictures... cuz new are selling better for about a 2 weeks... than they all somewhere in the middle of nowhere in search results... the other thing with shutterstock is.... they are to big... too many users... too many pictures... its not the same like used to be... I was trying 4 months to get accepted and start selling now its much easier and scouts just don't care about picture quality like used to be.... now every one can take a chance and sell photos from trip to whatever....  thats wy you not gonna make same good money like couple years ago.... now iStock getting big... earnings average... one month $50 other $250 you need little luck... and they are really crazy about pictures quality, copyright logos etc... sometimes they rejecting my pictures for really idiotic reasons like: logo on the building... or one of my picture taken from Empire state building was rejected couple times cuz of logos on Cabs... sure you could see "logos" in 400% zoom... see logos its too big word :) couple colors without any meaning... but oh well this is iStock they just weird sometimes.... accepting some stupid pictures and rejecting some good ones and very good ones... Fotolia is trying to leave bottom of the barrel but this is still Fotloia :) they used to accept almost every picture just to have more in collection and more and more... and now when you trying to find somethin you see bunch of crap... so they start removing pictures after without downloads in last year or two.... earnings nothing special $50 a month if you lucky.... Dreamstime is still the same... they have a good scouting and accept original and interesting pictures even if they not perfect quality but when has something "in it" earnings... I must tell you that getting better after a year I started making some money: $100 a month average... but this is all because my uploads for the last 3-4 months I sent lots of New York Panoramas and Statue of Liberty photos and this subject is always on the top... selling like crazy before summer...  123rf... this is the smallest Stock... earnings not too good... $20-$50 a month but I really like this stock... even if earnings are not crazy.... I believe that 123rf will be a huge competition for big companies in couple years so I just uploading... they accepting pretty much every picture.... so after couple moths you`ll have couple hundreds photos in portfolio... I have over a 1000 there.... on every other stock around 600-700 on iStock: 350.... but what my private opinion after over 2 years of microstock adventure is that you pretty much just loosing a money selling micro stocks... if I would start 3 years ago selling for Alamy now I would be probably very happy with my earnings... on real stocks like Alamy or GettyImages your photos are really worth some money not 25 cents or couple bucks like is on micro stocks... this is wasting a time after year or two.... micros are good for start just to learn how everything looks like... now Im thinking to remove all my portfolios from Micro SToks... and take care of Alamy.... I wish to sell for GettyImages but this is not easy... you can't just creat an account:) you must be chosen.... I Have Alamy account and after a year I siold my first pictures but money are totally different than stocks.... one photo i sold for almost $1000 other 3 for around $400 so you can calculate and compare to microstocks... like I said micros are not bad for start... you`ll learn a lot.... how to check your pictures, how to select the best one, how to take care of quality during a shooting... The truth is that only 5 maybe 10 ppl in the world are making real money on microstocks... and if you calculate all this you will figured that the only really money maker is your micro stock agency... not you.... cuz after you will notise that you taking a good pictures 25 cents for your photo will be like a joke... not too good joke....  I wish you luck !!

Having an air of charisma and good looks, Cal is able to gain enough popularity that he is able to gather people from his new school for a party. At the gathering he reveals his Wiccan origins by inviting his peers to join him in a circle to celebrate Mabon, one of the Wiccan sabbats.

It is such a great book with a complex storyline and characters. It's one of the best books ever because it combines action and it reveals true things about humanity. It's a graphic novel but it s soooo good. Before I hated graphic novel but this book totally changed my perspective. It's about super heroes but don't jugde it until you read it. It's going to be made into movie, which looks awesome.|`|53Yp0Zsmaa	yeah it depends on ur age..which teenage ur referring to.<br>  Try Eragon.<br>  maybe give twilight a chance.<br>  A child called it.<br>  maybe manga book [those anime comic books]<br>  books by walter dean myers.<br>  the outsiders.<br>  etc.|`|knKVjOE6aa	The Inheritance Cycle, Eragon, Eldest, Brisingar by Christopher Palini is really good if you're into fantasy.

J.K. Rowling actually has talent.|`|BTkHkkJTaa	I never actually read twilight so i shouldn't say it "sucks".  But giving what people say about stephenie meyers writing capabilities...well....i may not get into that.<br>  <br>  I LOVE the Harry Potter Series.  The characters develop so much during the all the books.  (especially neville) The complexity of the all of the stories was amazing. And its the one book that made me feel emotion for fictional characters, almost like they are real. Only a true writer can do that.|`|RrtUV5wcaa	twilight will NEVER come even CLOSE to being as good as harry potter! Twilight has one of the most simple storylines I’ve ever seen. it's a cliché story about a normal girl that impossibly falls in love with a *dramatic pause* perfect vampire *sarcasm* and how freakin hot and beautiful edward is. sure, there's a little more to twilight than just that, but overall, that's what the story is about. its full of plotholes and stephenie meyer writes like she swallowed a thesaurus. harry potter on the other hand is well written and full of twists and turns that make the reader keep going and going. you just can't put the books down.<br>  <br>  the characters in harry potter actually have their own personality. they're more than just vampires that sparkle and have special powers, or an average girl that's a klutz. they have their own background and their own story, and you actually know themt! they're role models too. the characters in twilight - they're perfect vampires that sparkle with superpowers. nothing more. they have no personality, they hardly develop throughout the whole series - they might as well be made of cardboard.<br>  <br>  the harry potter story is more original as well. nothing in the books had ever been thought of or written about before. J.K Rowling creates a whole new world for the reader. everything in her books is so detailed and specific, when you're reading the books, is like you escape into a whole new world and leave everything else behind while you're reading and just get wrapped up in a world of magic. <br>  <br>  sure, i enjoyed twilight, they were good books, but they will NEVER be better than harry potter.<br>  <br>  magic beats sparkles! and long live harry potter - the boy who lived|`|qJfKeeslaa	Harry Potter it is well written and interesting|`|6AeiZ3lyaa	Both.<br>  Harry Potter: It was a clever story.<br>  Twilight: I don't know, I just do.|`|53Yp0Zsmaa	You should find statistics.<br>  I personaly favored Harry Potter.<br>  there are ups and downs in both but Harry Potter, the whole series i mean, was very captivating.

Only i hated the last 5-7 books.

AA11442722	If that was the case I'd been dead long ago LOL. <br>  <br>  Some people can smoke into their 80s and 90s and never suffer a problem. My Mom is 70ish and has smoked for at least 50 years. <br>  <br>  Smoking increases your risk for cancer, but almost always in combination with other things. Every day you breath or imbibe everything that's in cig smoke even if you don't smoke and are never around anybody who does. Even if you never light up a cig in your life your risks of lung cancer are higher than a smoker's if you live in a home or work in a building with high radon levels. If you smoke and are exposed to high radon levels you are more likely than not to get lung cancer.  Workers in certain proffessions are high risks for cancer and smokers in those proffesions at a higher risk. <br>  <br>  Cancer and Emphasemia are the primary dangers. There are some links to heart attacks however smokers tend to be Type A personalities so they are much more likely to engage in lots of other behaviors that would make them more prone to heart attacks whether they smoke or not. One of the biggest of those factors are Cocaine users are becoming an empidemic of heart disease. 20 even 30 years after heavy Coke usage they are needing heart transplants in their early 40s or sooner. Most drug users also smoke. Thus heart attacks caused by cocaine usage is attributed incorrectly to smoking.|`|QNGzjvRKaa	I thought it was more than that - like 3 minutes off.<br>  However, the point is you will die sooner than if you didn't smoke.|`|AA12226718	That's one of those "what if''s" kind of things. I don't believe it. My Grandmother and Grandfather smoked 2 packs a day for as long as I knew them and they both lived well into their 90's. Then again, my Sister never smoked and died of natural causes when she was 43.<br>  I remember my Grandfather telling me that if smoking takes time off of your life it's time near the end when you're in pain anyway so who cares!|`|1TrRrWMLaa	No, I would say that is just a saying used to keep people from smoking.

People are finally paying attention to what you've known all along. It's getting an author you like a lot of exposure and MORE fans. There will always be people who jump on the bandwagon, but I've always been annoyed by people who think they're better than other people because they were fans "first". You have no idea what these works mean to other people and as such its not fair for you to say that they're not true fans just because they're new fans. I admit I never even heard of Twilight or Stephenie Meyer before last year. The only reason I did is because of a comparison to Harry Potter when Breaking Dawn came out. Some people called it "The biggest thing in children's fiction since Deathly Hallows" If that hadn't happened I wouldn't have even bothered to read the series. I'm reading it now and I'm not really that impressed but hey someone's favorite writer got a few book sales off of me. Good for them. Get over it man. You're not the only fan.

6uFaP2OAaa	You can do fan art.  I included I think three images in my folio that were fan art works, and I got accepted into all the courses I applied for.<br>  Make sure that the fan art isn't blatant fan art though.  By that I mean use your own style, make it stand out as your own art, and look nothing like the fandom you're referencing.  Go all out at making it your own.<br>  Most art colleges aren't thrilled at all about manga style, so if that's what you're thinking of doing, you might want to re-think.  Or keep it to a minimum.|`|cgG7VHhFaa	make it of art you thought of yourself.  If you just do fan art, it's going to appear that you lack imagination and don't have a selective eye.<br>  <br>  Pick about 12-15 works that you think are your absolute best, that you can see yourself hanging on a wall and/or showing to an employer, because what a portfolio review is essentially IS a portfolio interview.<br>  <br>  But make sure it's your absolute best work.  Get them professionally matted with white matts, museum cut ( bottom weighted, meaning there is more mat on the bottom than the top or sides).  Make sure they are extremely clean looking.  Invet in a good hardshell portfolio.  It's good but not required to have an artists' statement and inventory list included in your portfolio as well.<br>  <br>  A printed, matted portfolio is a MUST.  Employers and schools often evaluate every choice you make, including craftmanship of the mat itself, as well as paper choice of your works.  I had professors during my graduate portfolio review open the mats to see how I had a work attached to the backing (photo squares).<br>  <br>  As well as printed, DVD portfolios are also common.  Make sure the disc has a well designed label!   Also there are many ways to shw your work on disc.  You can make a simple Flash based gallery using Adobe Acrobat CS4 that you can burn to a disc.  <br>  <br>  If you have an automatically-moving slideshow, have the slides sit for about eight seconds or so before moving on.  That gives the viewer a good chance to view your work.  A resumé they can access and read is also a must.  <br>  <br>  Make the presentation as good as the work.  <br>  <br>  A print portfolio, whether they require it or not, is almost always required by interviewing firms.  Don't scrimp on it!

IS your work showing that you blew it up to proportion or things ranging in size like big, small, smaller, and smallest? 3. Do the colors look good together, complimentary, do the objects clash because there is too much or too empty like a pot with lots of detail next to two blank drawings of pots? 4. Do you use then one color of different shades and tints and not just the standard ROY G BIV? 5. OBjects have hierarchy? Like this objects the most brightest so it's the most distracting, this one the second distracting and this one the third. Usually do three (even number) to make a composition complete 6. Smooth, jagged lines, squiggly lines 7. Range from shading ver dark to light? Where is you light source coming from? 8.

ceBTTCPwaa	Hamlet is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written between 1599 and 1601. The play, set in Denmark, recounts how Prince Hamlet exacts revenge on his uncle Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet's father, the King, and then taken the throne and married Hamlet's mother. The play vividly charts the course of real and feigned madness—from overwhelming grief to seething rage—and explores themes of treachery, revenge, incest, and moral corruption.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/ha..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/ha...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/hamlet/index.h..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/hamlet/index.h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl..." rel="nofollow">http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/H..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/H...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/hamlet2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/hamlet2.html</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Gertrude is a woman with many facets. She is diplomatic in dealing with members of the court, anxious about her son, and brave in confronting Laertes. She’s also quite aware that her marriage to Claudius happened too soon – or "o’erhasty" as they said back in the day. She is quite aware that this post-funeral marriage is the source of Hamlet’s depressed and angry attitude.<br>  <br>  Ophelia certainly isn’t one of Shakespeare’s strong heroines, but that doesn’t mean she is completely weak. Although she never says she loves Hamlet, nobody doubts her feelings for him. What we don’t know is the form those feelings take.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop|`|R5UIMBvcaa	Gertrude seems to have loved Hamlet's father, yet she has married Claudius embarrassingly soon after her first husband's death.  I think that she must have turned to Claudius in her grief and found that he provided salve for her emotional  wound.  In the daze she must be in after her bereavement, she seems to have created her own little world in which somehow Claudius has become his brother and therefore Hamlet's father.  In short, she's emotionally very dependent. And in any case, she seems to be not only innocent of her first husband's death but ignorant of Claudius' role in it.<br>  <br>  Ophelia is even more passive and submissive than Gertrude, although that difference may be due mostly to the fact that she's a generation younger and of somewhat lower status.  When her father questions her about her relationship with Hamlet, she admits that Hamlet has courted her, and when her father tells her to return his letter and presents, she does, even allowing herself to be used as a kind of bait for a trap--remember that Polonius and Claudius are both eavesdropping during the "Get thee to a nunnery" passage.<br>  <br>  Ophelia is unable to bear the knowledge that the man she loves has killed her father, and her mind snaps.  The exact circumstances of her death are unclear.  As Gertrude relates it to Laertes, she fell into the moat and was so detached from reality that she made no effort to save herself; but the priest at her funeral thinks that she played a more active role and took her own life.  If his view is accurate (after all, Gertrude always does try to see things in the best light), then she may have done so because she couldn't live with the awful facts.<br>  <br>  Gertrude, too, may choose to die as a way out of her irreconcilable dilemma.  That evening in her room, Hamlet evidently jarred her out of her rose-colored fantasy world, so that she realizes what an irrevocable mistake she made in marrying Claudius. She is certainly not completely open with him after that   She may have some inkling that Claudius has stacked the deck against Hamlet in the duel with Laertes, and if she suspects that the wine in the goblet is poisoned, she may choose to die herself rather than face the fact that her husband is out to kill her son.   (Hamlet is probably the most analyzed, interpreted piece of secular writing in the world!)<br>  <br>  One reason Shekespeare made the roles of these two women less important than the male roles in this play, and in fact did the same in most of his tragedies, is that the parts were played by young boys, who would not have had the experience or the maturity to act major tragic roles.  This is unlikely to have been the ONLY reason, but male authors often have difficulty in depicting female characters.|`|zMDAklBTaa	"The imperial jointress to this warlike state"<br>  <br>  QUEEN GERTRUDE <br>  Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:<br>  I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.<br>  HAMLET <br>  I shall in all my best obey you, madam<br>  <br>  CLAUDIUS<br>  ...My virtue or my plague, be it either which--<br>  She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,<br>  That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,<br>  I could not but by her.<br>  <br>  HAMLET<br>  Follow my mother.<br>  <br>  Your premise is wrong.<br>  <br>  - Ray Eston Smith Jr

GaHkxtU9aa	Raleigh's plan in 1584 for colonization in the "Colony and Dominion of Virginia" (which included the present-day states of North Carolina and Virginia) in North America ended in failure at Roanoke Island.<br>  <br>  The first attempt to establish the Roanoke Colony was run by Rodney Lane after Sir Richard Grenville, who had transported the colonists to Virginia, returned to England for supplies as planned. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately for the colonists, who were desperately in need of supplies, Grenville's return was delayed. As a result, when Sir Francis Drake put in at Roanoke after attacking the Spanish colony of St. Augustine, the entire population of the colony returned with Drake to England<br>  <br>  In 1587, Raleigh attempted a second expedition again establishing a settlement on Roanoke Island. This time, a much more diversified group of settlers was sent, including some entire families, under the governance of John White. <br>  <br>  After a short while in America, White was recalled to England in order to find more supplies for the colony. He was unable to return the following year as planned, however, because the Queen had ordered that all vessels remain at port in case they were needed to fight the Spanish Armada. The threat of the Armada was only partially responsible for the 4 year delay of the second expedition. <br>  <br>  After England's victory over the Spanish fleet in 1588 the ships were given permission to sail. Unfortunately for the colonists at Roanoke the small fleet made an excursion towards Cuba in an attempt to capture as prizes the treasure-laden Spanish merchant ships that were reported to be proliferate in those waters at that time. <br>  <br>  White is said to have objected to this unplanned foray, but was helpless to dissuade the crews who'd been told of the enormous riches to be had by the experienced (he had previously piloted in the Americas in the service of the Spanish), Portuguese pilot hired by Raleigh to navigate the voyage. It was not until 1591 that the supply vessel arrived at the colony, 4 years later, only to find that all colonists had disappeared. <br>  <br>  The only clue to their fate was the word "CROATOAN" and letters "CRO" carved into separate tree trunks, suggesting the possibility that they were either massacred, absorbed or taken away by Croatans or perhaps another native tribe. <br>  <br>  Other speculation includes their being swept away or lost at sea during the stormy weather of 1588 (credited with aiding in the defeat of the Spanish Armada). However, it is worth noting that a hurricane prevented John White and the crew of the supply vessel from actually visiting Croatoan to investigate the disappearance, and no further attempts at contact were recorded for some years. <br>  <br>  Whatever the fate of the settlers, the settlement is now remembered as the "Lost Colony of Roanoke Island

Had the Russians ended combat as few as six months earlier, perhaps, a different outcome, but because of internal bickering, the Russians dragged out the actual date of ending the conflict and the Germans (always acting stupidly) waited far too long to begin drawing down their forces.<br>  Now here is one your teachers might not mention!  BECAUSE of the turmoil in Russia, because Russia withdrew its forces, and because the Germans did not censor the news, news about chaos in Russia emboldened those forces inside Germany & Austria to start up strikes & to agitate for their own Governments to step down.  The chaos inside Russia invigorated the chaos inside Austria & Germany and ultimately helped to defeat those two nations.  <br>  <br>  Peace////////\\\\\\\\\\\\<br>  <br>  Thus it was a negative for Germany & Austria not a positive|`|XpUF9f1Saa	Russia's withdrawal Enabled the Central powers to shift their Eastern troops to the west.

My favorite author, Clive Cussler, has, over the course of about thirty books and counting, used those ideas in various combinations throughout his various series.<br>  <br>  Similarly, you may wish to look to Michael Crichton's body of work for additional ideas. Each of his books focuses on a specific area (genetic engineering, etc.) and the story is built around that.<br>  <br>  Have you looked at the newspaper? You may find ideas there, too; I recall one instance when the writers of "CSI" used as a storyline a murder in which the victim was buried in a remote location. Later, while watching a crime documentary about a similar homicide that became the plot for the aforementioned episode.<br>  <br>  Do you have any pets?

Write from your head keeping you facts straight. Pick somthing that intressets you and waht ever you end up writting will turn out great!<br>  <br>  If you wanted it to be science fiction, you can't go wrong with kids. Make your main chactor a little boy or girl who make friend with the monster under their bed or in their closet. They might be keeping their new friend hidden from their parents and freinds. in that case it could also be a comedy or a drama. if you're not into monsters there ar allways aliens (some one witness a UFO crash and has to deal with the alien crew wheither they're the good guys or bad guys) or dinosaurs (a kid acedentaly brings his toy dinos to life and they rampace his little town) or timetravel (a person realises that they have the ablity to warp though the time and space continum. How will they use this power or how can they possibly keep it a secret?)<br>  <br>  Maybe you want to write a horror. Monster, the dark and death are what make theese the best. There is the clasic plot, a group of people get traped somewhere and are being picked off one by one by a crazed phsyco or some unknown monster. Or a group of tourists are locked in  a castle owned by a vampire. He will let all of hem leave exsept one who he will it. The thing is, they only have an hour to decide among them who it will be.<br>  <br>  Are you into romance? Forbin romances are allways good. Somthing alomg the lines or romeo and juliet, two forbiden lovers who want to be together againnst all the odds. or the story of how two highschool sweetheart have been together for decades. posibly in the older times, he had to go off to war and she had to stay home and fight against her father who wnated to mary her off  to another man.

w29tsXLUaa	Pollution of the sea, rivers, land. Also the bees dying off.|`|AA11219693	I would like to believe that it is the attitude of people living today whose minds have been affected the extravagance in lifestyle, or the expectations of such extravagance as is normally enjoyed by affluent societies of the West. In the West people are getting better informed about environmental issues. They are gathering themselves round their agendas, in their actions groups of in their localities. There is almost shift in the way of thinking and behaving when it comes to the matters of preservation of environment. In schools we never thought children would be learning about green energy issues, waste disposal methods, and pollution.     I the it is the people of previous decades who have much to answer for and much to change about their ways of thinking and the ways of living. They still might find it hard to imagine as how to limits their needs and expectations of the mother earth. I think most people quite unknowingly might still be of the mindset that there is endless supply of resources, that given the right technology that we could live an ideal life.     This would be hard for many Third World countries to implement change, to change the perception of their people, to inculcate in their minds of the young new environmental messages. The writing is on the wall. We are cluttered the environment and changes the global climate. We are running out of much-relied-upon supplies of oil, gas and even water and food.

QMYNDtHgaa	I'll get any criticism out of the way first.  You seem to be writing as if the main character is writing all of this down while in hiding however she seems to try and sound convincing that the world was taken over by vampires, that's right vampires.  If this world was taken over by vampires anybody that finds her writings would all ready have known that.  I think that's why a rule of writing is "Show don't tell' <br>  <br>   Secondly your constantly repeating how empty everything is, like your talking to an old person that doesn't hear well.  Everything is empty, no one is here, there is 30 students but now only 13 its not occupied by its original amount...Plenty of Vacancy.  ON and on and on, I get it, its empty. <br>  <br>  As for the writing "there will be no warning; this is the only warning you will be receiving"  Well this statement is just silly.  Hopefully you can understand why. <br>  <br>  All right on to the positives.  I think Apocalyptic stories of the worlds demise are neat.  I like the I am Legend feel it has and wondered when someone would do a story about the world ending rather then the after math of how it all ready ended.  It's interesting and a lot of fun.  I like your character, not introducing her self properly in writing shows that she has lost a ton of her identity and life from the past events.  I like that a lot, I hope if someone says you should tell us what her name is right away that you ignore that advice.|`|a796jDdlaa	You are very talented! That was so interesting!

To be honest this is pretty boring and cliche. It's best to have a little foresight in where you're going with the story and how you want it to come off. Here it's coming off as a documentry, with the dates and the statistics. If this is a short story, every sentence should Either advance the plot or introduce/develop a character. Don't be afraid to kill off characters. Also, don't be afraid to have the reader become conflicted/angry/revolted by the characters (Don't have to make every character likeable). Vampire romance = Twilight....so good luck with that.....<br>  <br>  Oh, and don't make the main character forgetable!!! <br>  (...Casey who ?)|`|WTXvmcxcaa	i got to the vampire thing and stopped. Twilight much? make it a different creature, if you please. make the world be taken over by dragons or something. please. it would be more original.     <br>  <br>  otherwise, it was well written. i liked it, except for the fact that it was yet again a vampire story. don't you think people have heard enough about them for the next, i don't know, century?|`|TKZAYJokaa	woah i really really like it. i want to read more...<br>  i dont have anything bad to say
AqDson6zaa	Okay...<br>  <br>  What actually happens:<br>  <br>  King Lear is old and decides to divide his kingdom between his three daughters (Goneril, Reagan, and Cordelia). To decide each of their shares, he asks each of them how much they love him. Of course, Goneril and Reagan figure this is just an easy way to get a huge slice of land, so they lay it on thick with all of these praises for Lear. Cordelia is Lear's favourite daughter, and when he gets to her he expects something epic, but she just says that she loves him exactly as much as she should (clearly she loves him the most, though). Lear is outraged and banishes her. She leaves and marries the Prince of France, and Lear divides the kingdom between his two remaining daughters. Edgar, the legitimate son of the Duke of Gloucester (he has a bastard son, Edmund) tries to stick up for Cordelia and is also banished.<br>  <br>  To make a long story short, Goneril and Reagan conspire to gain the rest of their father's kingdom. Gloucester remains loyal to the king, has his eyes gouged out, is aided by Edgar in disguise, and ends up dying. Edmund is totally evil and he dies, too. Goneril and Reagan die. Cordelia returns with the army of France to return balance to the kingdom but ends up dying as well. Lear goes completely crazy.<br>  <br>  Metaphorical meaning:<br>  <br>  A meditation on the loss of authority, parental and royal power, and love between family members.

We acknowledge what is our own and what is not, take care not to just dole out answers to questions.    Share freely but understand that we must learn how to learn by learning. That is, I can read all kinds of experts but I still must make sense of what I believe and think on my own, learn to answer my own questions, research my own sources, decide what sources to trust/believe/repeat/accept influence from. Know my own truths.    It's such a beautiful poem; I just had to try and write a response, not as lovely and philosophical as your riddle though. Thanks for just letting me add to the conversation here, even if I'm just attempting to repeat or rephrase your sensuous and thoughtful song. A poem, a riddle, a song -- minutes to pause and meditate.|`|raU9c3tzaa	me thinks this poem is a high class. if there is any thing called aristocratic poetry, this belongs there. me can not pick which stanza me liked more. all are great. powerful construction, beautiful meaning, very well addressed.   on second thought me sees wise saying in the third stanza. t.y.|`|KH3kbRjgaa	Loved the phrase "another's truth is never worn comfortably" - it should be displayed for all to see and preserved to last a lifetime into posterity ?
yE81qpcraa	In terms of professional photography, it is an average snap shot, both artistically and technically. The horizon should not be slanted, it should be completely level. It also appears that you've put little thought into the overall composition of the image.    I've also noticed you've taken this shot with a cell phone which definitely not ideal for professional photography. You'll need to invest in a camera that has the ability to change aperture and shutter speed, then you'll have more control over the exposure of your image. I'd recommend a decent digital camera to begin with, then, if you take it a step further, buy an SLR (single-lens reflex) camera. It will allows you to alter the focus of your shot - it's what all the professionals use.|`|qXAvXHdYaa	The image is underexposed and the composition is uninspiring.  It looks like a basic snapshot taken with a point and shoot.|`|UXQ22qeVaa	the intention is good and you seem interested that's good too.  you had the eye to pick the scenario but you needed the experience to take the shoot.

JOChNigNaa	Ashley, you've got to find the shift key for your i, and how to tell the difference between lay and lie, things lay, people lie (unless they're being profane, something I don't think you mean).  Don't trade your innocence for anything, but go on to a new theme.|`|7ljzPBjyaa	I like it!  I think a lot of people can relate to what you are talking about. <br>  <br>  Whether it is the messy breakup or the long lost ex, it's great that you put your own feelings into it and make such a common theme your own. <br>  <br>  Remember that a bunch of letters and words next to each other has little meaning, but rather it's the feelings and emotions behind those letters and words that give a poem life. I feel ya.|`|q143lhSlaa	Those words cut like a knife. May I receive your permission to write some music to it and turn it into a great song? I will probably never publish it, but if I do, I will credit you as lyric writer! Please?! By the way, the title would probably be "Lost Love(r)".|`|XuGFt3boaa	That's a cool poem Ashley.  Here a good title for it.<br>  <br>  "Here I Am".  How's that?|`|MI2U5sWyaa	Excellent-not enough words in the book to say ......<br>  umm a title how bout "Your Words" or "Those Words"????|`|s7UWLOS9aa	That sounded really good!

I saw in the comments that some guy wants to make a song out of it and use your poem as the lyrics. <br>  The being dead part could be worked on. If you were really dead, you would no longer need sleep nor feel anything. You may want to die when you are badly sick but death is the unknown.<br>  Then you go from the feeling physically sick to the emotions of being slighted by a romantic interest.<br>  Elizabeth Barrett Browning wrote a lot about love and being hurt by love. See her poem "A Man's Requirements."<br>  The line "how my heart you misled" sounds like Juliet from Shakespeare. I am not sure if you wanted to have the words work in a rhythmic pattern to match the previous line. <br>  The rest is very good and these two things are only meant as constructive criticism. <br>  I think you should put a title on this, print off a copy and mail it to yourself as a "poor man's copyright" and see if you can get it published.
s3HK7Mv1aa	Visitors are separate people, and hits are how many times they click on your pages. A single visitor might return to your story several times, so you could have several hits for that one visitor.<br>  <br>  I don't think it counts if you visit your own pages.|`|InzHK1rcaa	Not sure... but I think a Hit is when someone says the like a story, and  a visitor is someone who posts something (maybe a comment) but does not belong to the site.|`|AxGFz6qQaa	Visitors can hit your page more than once. Hits are just a number of times your profile/story has been viewed, while visitors are the number of people that visited your story. I'm not sure if you can hit your own page or not.|`|oL9HDPveaa	Hits are the number of times someone comes to your page. Visitors are individual members. Visitors might visit more than once; thus more hits. I doubt it counts if you are logged in and check your own page.
i6VF9Ww2aa	it can be because people are jealous of you because how you look and you are boxed and people dont give you a chance to be who you are because they think your dumb.<br>  but the advantages are probably great people are nice to you, give you free stuff, always compliment you and you get more advantages.|`|HvX6KvK1aa	sometimes|`|NhFRsflwaa	That's probably true in some instances. I think if you're exceptionally beautiful it might be hard to be taken seriously when you want to be. It might also be possible to be used in relationships and the like. <br>  <br>  But I do think the world revolves around three things....money, power, and beauty. So it can also place you a few steps further up the path than you might deserve.
BO28Mn8haa	He was a very influential member of the Jazz Era, new york in the 50s. His work was original, and there is more thought in it that meets the eye. You should watch a documentary on it. Now a days, many people do that kind of abstract work so we may not see it as anything special, but back in the day, he was in a field of his own. Not to mention he was crazy.. always good for artists to be crazy...|`|jJxUCkkFaa	There is more thought involved than as obvious
RB3IGAeRaa	I have to say, I love it. I know exactly how you feel. I think it was kind of slow in the beginnig, but I like it in a sense, it makes it flow better. Nicely done :]|`|AKv1gj0Xaa	It sort of wanders along and takes too long to get to the meat of the story, which begins with the woman in the restaurant complaining about her order. All the stuff about reading the newspaper headlines slows the story down and should cut. The rest of it is all right, but you should polish the prose.|`|y8cXzvpxaa	nice. someone lacks faith in people and then someone does the extraordinary and it helps rekindle her faith.i like it. is that all?|`|XxtVwslraa	I like it. This is more like flash fiction because it is so short. The story is interesting but there are a few issues. But there is some real potential here.<br>  <br>  1. You need to introduce a problem right in the beginign in order to grab the readers attention. This is vital in a short story. Have the woman at the gas station looking for her credit card frantically and impatient customers waiting on her. You can have her try and remember everything about the coffe shop later as shes sitting in her car trying to remember where she might have lost her wallet.<br>  <br>  2. Try to vary your sentence structures. Too many of them start with I. "I did this. I saw that." And eliminate all filters like I sw or I heard. Just say a woman was screaming and we'll know its because you heard her.<br>  <br>  3. Give more details so that the reader can feel the narrators annoyance. For instance when they guy steals the seat talk about how maybe her feet were hurting from working all day or show she imagined her self forcibly removing him from the chair. For the woman screaming, talk about how her voice worsened an already bad headache or say that the waitress dropped something for fear of the woman.<br>  <br>  4. Your character needs to manifest her epiphany moment in an action. We see at the end that she changes her mind about people. Turn that thought process into an action. Maybe she's in a position to do something nice for someone but thinking about her bad day and lost wallet she decides not to. Once she gets her wallet back she goes back and does the nice thing. That way you can show her renewed faith in people instead of telling about it.<br>  <br>  You're on the right track. Feel free to message me with any questions. I have tons more suggestions to make this better but I think I've already written enough.|`|lh0dihm1aa	The first thing that came to my head was: Cliche!<br>  <br>  I have a few questions:<br>  1. I want to ask what the purpose of this short story is. Is it an assignment or just for fun?<br>  2. What kind of coffee shop is this? I've never been in a coffee shop where there are waiters/waitresses. I've only seen the ones like Starbucks where you go and order, then sit yourself down.<br>  3. She got gas, but how did she end up paying for it?<br>  <br>  There is a lot of TELLING in this, not enough showing. You explain the character voices, but what do they look like? What does the coffee shop look like? Is she/he there because it's a daily routine? <br>  It seemed to wrap up very nicely, almost too nicely. I'm not saying it's impossible for this sort of thing to happen, because it can, but it was just like, this happened, then this, then this, and we lived happily ever after. <br>  <br>  I don't mean to be offensive, I'm just trying to help.|`|oQzjoPlGaa	Pretty good, in my opinion some sentences sounded a bit too cliched or forced - for example "handed over the two dollars due in exchange for it" - i would have just said 'handed over the money' or 'handed over two dollars'. And cliches like a 'nasally' voice...nasally doesnt sound right. I liked 'scaly' way better, that was clever. Basically, a few sentences sound too long or unnatural, overall awesome piece of writing! Good luck.
AkSOZ099aa	why would you even do this? no offense but you could be doing homework, studying, a sport, having fun. or even doing your own story(need some work on your tone). my point is stop wasting your time ont his trash.|`|QMYNDtHgaa	Sorry, getting excited about having Bella at the house killed this for me.  Why would anyone be excited about that?  Bella is such a Knob and you making Alice gush over her is making Alice seem like an ever worse Knob.|`|7AxaQvoUaa	i like it =] i think it's really good|`|YEfW3vI0aa	Look, I admire you for taking the time to write this, but I just don't see the point in it.|`|zUdxoRbyaa	i see the point. you are very talented.|`|g9IBMllyaa	I loved it|`|C0Lby79Iaa	I like it, though, it is quite repetative. <br>  I wish that I would have thought of any idea like this.<br>  <br>  Alice doesn't have much of a part.<br>  Emmett would be better, you can say would you really think that he thinks, of Bella & Edward.

31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	The answer is simple when you understand it.<br>  <br>  The text book publishers for high school texts have to produce their books for the states that have statewide text adoption.  That would mean that Texas, Florida, and California dictate what the text will have in it.  They could not make a separate text for all states.  So the books sold in Georgia or Tennessee, for instance, are books designed for the Texas course and the cirriculum is designed around the text books used.|`|AA11485682	Each state generates their own curriculum. However, there's bound to be overlap due to general agreement that some events are more important to teach than others.|`|4818d65e08b64762be5f48d1d6b7ea82aa	No.
4vbovQKJaa	I enjoyed that very much!  You've got a knack for drawing in the reader and you've got good flow.  The dialogue was well written and you use the right amount of descriptives to create your scenes 'visually'.  <br>  <br>  The only think I found a little awkward were the names, but stories would be boring if everyone were named John and Jane.  The whole 'violet eyes' thing seems out of place also.  It's a scheme or a schtick that writers use to set their characters apart, and I don't think you really need it. <br>  <br>  Other then that, well done!
V87NaMXDaa	My skin is thin. How else would my heart be seen?  If it does not catch my attention, it is quickly dismissed. If others treat mine the same, it is deserved.|`|WbRuTjmFaa	It all depends on my mood.  I sometimes read it 3 times before it clicks and makes sense at all.   Hell, even what I write has me wondering at times..  I know a poem is good when I have a poetic or strong remark to leave on it. ..  Or I think it is.. haha!|`|qaOo72s1aa	that q was suppose to establish.....    .......Unity...    ...amongst us......|`|wWL934E8aa	I have been changing.  I used to just glance at a poems length and if I felt it too long from looking would ignore it.  Now, I give it a chance.    Always, once I start to read a poem I read it all the way through.  Sometimes I don't get it and will re-read.  If I am not sure of what to say but really am moved deep within, I will star the poem and wait to see what others say.|`|HkXYGAOdaa	You give it all the chances, even those beyond your strength.  The enemy is not human!  Thus, protest, protest; we shall protest.  Fight a good fight, be calm though, the enemy does not feel, is not human.    I am so sorry your Q is gone!  And I don't understand why?     Get it back, get it back; I wanted to read it all.|`|n9hRyHpqaa	I usually read at least three times.  Once for the general idea, second for the flow, third for the meaning.  Sometimes I go more,  depends.|`|QLYpq7Zhaa	darn.|`|S9bEtVCSaa	Glad you asked. I sometimes don't finish reading some poems because they didn't grab me quick enough. Though I'm sure I'm guilty of that at times as well.|`|AA12226501	Life is for the thick-skinned.  I give it more chance if I have more free time.|`|GomZ9oYHaa	Well most here are thick skinned or we would of moved on by now.

Leather skinned and scaled.  ma|`|raU9c3tzaa	it depends on whom the poet is. some take one pass and me gets the flow and the breeze, while some need three passes then a compiler.|`|j37DL7WLaa	I read everything at least twice.  I have also learned you have to grab your reader quickly, while keeping your back to the wall.|`|zGAGZKY5aa	If your not thick skinned ,,,,,Your in a lot of trouble    You might as well be a door mat|`|T0fwqL2baa	I am oh so thin skinned but My bones are made of steel. I know, I looked.|`|1lCUPVAkaa	Mostly I read a poem through, unless it does not speak to me, and  there are times, I go back to read some I have not given a fair chance.  and there are others, I plain do not understand, nor do I want to.|`|MZp3EU0eaa	You know me, I don't give them a chance to pause. Get in, get out, and leave a whopper in the air behind you...|`|NLsaNo6taa	as much of a chance as it needs.|`|lj8PbJugaa	Aww, it's gone?      I give them all a chance to get my attention.

A marvelous experiment, a wondrous collective poem,  suddenly dissolves into pixel dust.    My guess is that 'they' are/is actually a robot script.  It decides it sees a 'chat' which is against the rules.  This is why such intelligence is called artificial.    It reminds me of a science fiction story I once read............    .|`|2wptPP8xaa	I am new so I read all, I may not grasp and understand but I try.
0385spDQaa	That's an awesome question! I guess today is history tomorrow so when castro took over cuba it wasn't history but if he hadn't i bet it would just be part of the USA and would have missiles pointing at Russia, and if the russian revolution never happened, my gosh, i have no idea, the world could be totally different. brrrrr scary thoughts!|`|AA10729675	I do not know about Castro and the Russians.  History comes from a Greek word which means:  Witnessing.    History is our witness about what happened, so that we know what happened and we can choose to do it again (if it were good) or not to do it again.  If we did not have all those witnesses' records, we would be ignorant.  Would you like to walk in a field, find a statue and not know what this statue represents?  Or would you like to walk in a field, step on a mine and die or be mauled because no one told you the field had been mined during such and such war?|`|8pDblyCBaa	Without the past, there would never be a future. The past is happening now.|`|sXW2MsGqaa	History doesn't really have a meaning, per say. It's just the past, permanent memories, a foundation for the future.
K60FfiIfaa	We can learn from history.  See what went right and what went wrong.  Especially right now we should look at the Great Depression and see which policies worked and which didn't, so we can get out of the current mess we're in.    We should also look at how governments were able to generate whole new industries with funding for research and development.  What worked out, successfully forming a billion industry?  What turned into a huge waste of tax payer dollars?  Done right it could pull us out of this recession.    We should also look to what causes war, such as jingoism, etc, so we can avoid future blunders like the Iraq war.  With the economy weakening we may be tempted to blame it on an outside enemy, and politicians could see that as a useful distraction.  Many of the roots of WW2 lie there, and I don't think that's something we want to see repeated.|`|siTibEIGaa	Well, people say history repeats itself. That is true, but I think if we are to lead the world in the next few decades, we need to try some new things. We need to focus on unity, forgiveness, respect, and truthfulness, responsibility, and accountability. We all need to educate ourselves and get more involved, it's our future!|`|sSlRzn2iaa	use what fdr did to help the econimy|`|Iw6vqJd8aa	We need to learn from past mistakes. Look at the past when things went bad, look and try what worked and what didn't. For example, this is one of the few times that the United States was in a conflict and the economy tanked. Look at what Hitler got from not looking at the past. He made the same mistake as another Emperor did.|`|lrS8UXnYaa	Do what you usually do and use things like Hollywood to rewrite the past to your benefit. Twist the truth for your own propoganda.
iT9S20zvaa	The Outsiders by S. E Hinton maybe?|`|AA10960542	Why would you want to watch the movie when you can read the book now?
532LT9C7aa	I would say don't limit yourself. If you have these new ideas and insights, even if they pose problems you'll have to iron out later, put them down and follow them...especially if they lead down a rabbit hole.<br>  <br>  It's always easier to fix problems than to pull creativity and inspiration out of nowhere. Start with the wildest "what ifs" and then scale them back, if needed. But don't limit yourself from the get-go. Re-think everything.|`|t8xFyCt0aa	How do I make my own universe?<br>  <br>  Well in my current one, I pretty much started with the characters from it. They are living on Earth. I had to ask Why? What is going on back home that made them come to Earth?<br>  <br>  From there, everything fell into place. I made traditions, cultures, lore, economics, government, different nations and political affiliations.<br>  <br>  I hope something here helped give you a sparking point.|`|09bd9071f261e20518478352da1dad4daa	A truly alternate Universe would be beyond our meager abilities to imagine, actually, since all that we know or are capable of knowing is contained with this encapsulated Cosmos in which we are trapped -- to condense the vastness of space into atomic size!  However, in your endeavor to create the impossible, I am wondering how you might be able to make your universe "darker" than the one we inhabit.  Our history here on Earth is almost as harrowing and horrendous as anything which might possibly exist in an alternate universe, I would think.  "Man's inhumanity to man" here has perpetrated such physical torments upon its victims that I doubt you could imagine anything worse than what has been done here to use in your proposed novel.  Still, to us humans, only such violence and torture are appealing as entertainment apparently (meaning marketable), our only ideas of perfection being derived from legends of that mythological realm regarded by the pious as paradise or heaven, and indescribable in mundane terms, since no one is capable presumably of contemplating eternal peace or joy.  Therefore, I suggest that if you are intending to write for a terrestrial readership (and what else is there?), you will need to attempt to envision your "darker" universe.  Whatever you decide, you will definitely need to stretch your imagination to its limits!!  I wish you good luck!|`|BVkZRMefaa	I think it is sad to meet a homeless writer. You have two assumptions about your imaginary alternate universe. Either an imaginary or a practical one with reality. I don't feel happy and secure in Hong Kong either. However, it is too bad to stay with no choice. I wish I could see the imaginary one in the future. It is not likely could happen. Not even in my next life. I only survive by inhaling the foul Hong Kong air and live in this number six most expensive city in this world. My life saving still enough to live and spend moderately in Hong Kong. Every one would like to see the Utopia. It has been More than one hundred years for such an ideal home for the many human kinds. However, the Utopian dream never come true. No one can conquer the human sins of greed, selfishness, and fear of losing each's possession. Hong Kong is a typical city where the people don't give a damn to each other. The systems of Hong Kong is set to make the rich become richer and the poor become poorer. I think we need to stick to the pragmatic approach of systems to deal with the reality.<br>  My alternate universe in the imaginary one is green living where no car is driven, no heat is consumed and sunshine all year round (Hoinan Island and many tropical islands in this world have such good living conditions). I doubt if it can come true. The practical universe will have human minds eliminated the basic three human sins.The new government and economists will eliminate no stock market and no real estate transactions in the future or at least downsize to Dow Jones Index to 4,000 points and the evil Hong Kong Heng Seng Index decline to 8,000 points and this will maintain to ten consecutive years with daily flutuation not exceed +/- 100 points. The future government should control the real estate transaction only less than 100/day. This scene was happened in Hong Kong about 30 to 40 years ago as what many oldies told me in the past few years. Can you recall during the bull market of the last year around February to March? Every stock shares were making money by that time, many Hong Kong working peoples had quitted their full time jobs and became a stock share traders. By that time, we also witnessed (on TV) many infants had starved to dead in many developing countries. Many renters become homeless because the rent hikes so rapidly and had been evicted but couldn't afford to live in a new flat or unable to find a cheaper place to stay. For your novel, you should either to choose an imaginary or practical alternate unuverse. You can make an example to reflect Hong Kong is the worst living city in this world. I will read your novel someday.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	There are so many ways to go I would find it hard to choose.  Do you postulate a universe that is totally different from ours, as in it is 2 dimensional instead of three?  Do you make a universe in which the laws of physics are different, like time runs backwards or gravity doesn't work?  A couple of books I could suggest would be L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time, Piers Anthony's Viscous Circle, and Forward's Dragons Egg.  These three books postulate more different universes than you can shake a stick at and might give you some ideas as to what you want to do with yours.|`|DjCLWseZaa	I just do it. Choose a few things that can make up an alternate universe. Flip a coin if you can't decide. If you're disappointed by the results, you know you've chosen something different. (Trust me, you already know, you just don't know, you know?)
E3hUijb0aa	Sweet that means about love, or?<br>  We have some very popular but no one takes it serious (the children like it):<br>  Na górze ró?e,<br>  Na dole fio?ki,<br>  A my si? kochamy<br>  jak dwa anio?ki.<br>  What means (in my poor English):<br>  Above are roses,<br>  Down are violets. <br>  And we love each other.<br>  like two angels.

j7MVgF6laa	No. Infants don't know what 'death' means, do they?|`|af9f8af3a56d5bca6ce47e359dbb5c10aa	I don't think fear of death is innate in the animal world; and we humans are animals. It is said the only natural fear humans have (what we are born with) is - fear of falling, all the rest are learnt. That is why fears are call phobias.<br>  <br>  I think we mistake our very natural desire to live and our determination to live under almost any circumstance, as fear of death.|`|Nldx247Yaa	yes, because the sense of survival is innate.|`|gTzj6gy5aa	what does innate mean?|`|yuuvBSKsaa	Of course.<br>  <br>  Life is a competition.  Lifeforms that do not fear death are replaced by those that do.|`|QlB3VXWraa	Seems so to me. Even insects struggle to survive.|`|5WaZWeY8aa	It is interesting that the people who actually had near death experiences completely loose this fear. <br>  I believe that if we deny to occupy ourselves with death and what this means, the fear gets bigger. If we realize it is just another stage in our existence and that only the body dies, the fear of this big transition will be not so big.|`|wD86088oaa	The only thing philosophy can say about death is that it is inevitable. Death is inevitable. As for fear of death, philosophy will admit "nausea" and "anxiety" from an existential point-of-view--not fear. Ask the psychologists.|`|FeRC5jkoaa	I'd also like to know the answer to this question.|`|I6D7xdcVaa	No, I don't fear dying myself I only fear the fact that others will die.

2tqdTCPQaa	well first of all let me say i love the plot behind the first story very interesting and a natural eye catcher....but i would like to have more info like what are you writing these stories for or who....and i mean when your writing something think about what audience you are wanting more....if you write the first one you will most likely be attracting mothers,women, or people with sensitive sides.....the second one would attract more of someone with imaginations, like maybe teenagers or people that like mysteries because it kinda sounds like it will be one....and about helping you with the second plot i would be happy to...but to come up with some good examples or ideas might take a few min or so....but i am told i am a great writer so i hope i can help you....but i dont know from reading your ideas you seem actually more into the first story....and more inspired to write it....but hey you can write one for the assignment and then for free time write the other just for fun or maybe the future you could use it....|`|GcKVfvJqaa	Personally i like fiction better......<br>  i like bother <br>   i find the fiction more exciting <br>  but i find the reality more touching <br>  you know what i mean?<br>  so it is between <br>    Touchy or exciting<br>  if you did the fiction then make sure to have something dramatic and sad or heart warming in it<br>  and if you do the reality then make sure to have some surprises and things that make you say "He did what!?"<br>  hahaha<br>  good luck :)|`|bvfF3JNNaa	I'd pick the reality the fiction seems boring you want something exciting that should get you a A|`|4snTNQ98aa	depends...if you are good in telling fiction stories...you should go with the fiction..
u8sGVYdCaa	You can find plenty of paper mache recipes on the internet with ingredients you can find in your kitchen, such as flour, water, salt and glue, wallpaper paste, liquid starch. There are plenty of recipes, so you are sure to find one that includes ingredients you already have.    And, by the way, the stickier the material, the more I'd recommend using  something to protect your skin, like a layer of powder or even petroleum jelly. And be safe by not letting the mixture cover or get into your nose or mouth. :)    Good luck and have fun!
AA12343309	There is no such thing as a posh aristocratic name.<br>  <br>  In the past British titled families have used the double surname.  In recent years some Americans have done so. Women feel it helps to better identify them professionally. Also, alas, some I feel some do so because they think it makes them sound aristocratic.  I use to bill and collect Medicaid for a hospital. I notice some Medicaid patients are doing so.<br>  <br>  In English speaking countries, it is usually a woman's maiden name followed by her husband's name.<br>  <br>  In Spanish speaking countries it has always been a custom and actually in many cases the law but they do it differently.  <br>  <br>  The husband's name will be his father's patronymic surname followed by his mother's maiden name.<br>  <br>  The wife and children will be her husband's patronymic surname followed by her maiden name <br>  <br>  until<br>  <br>  the daughter gets married.  She then drops her mother's maiden name and pushes her father's surname to the right and puts her husband's name in front.<br>  <br>  For instance if a man's name is Gonzales-Rodriguez.  His father was a Gonzales and his mother was a Rodriguez but you would address<br>  him as Senor Gonzales.<br>  <br>  Edit:  If she is of English speaking origin, it is how the family carries their name.  In Britain it would mean they usually come from a titled family.  In the U.S., no it doesn't.  In recent years there are people copying British titled families.<br>  <br>  In Spanish speaking countries, she would have her father's surname followed by her mother's maiden name until she gets married and then it would be her husband's<br>  surname following by her father's surname.<br>  <br>  I don't know about the customs in far eastern countries.

Viec3YH9aa	Yes, as has been shown in previous answers, over 700,000 Palestians were displaced from there homes in 1948-49 due ot the establishment of a Jewish state.<br>  <br>  Up until the early 1900's the Arab and Jews had lived peacefully side by side, as a community and everybody was happy.  However in the late-1800's the Zionist movement was founded that called for the creation of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine, which was already a land occupied by the Palestinian Arabs, and part of the Ottoman Empire.  Another policy of some of the Zionists was the forceful expulsion of the Arabs of the land of Biblical Israel, over the River Jordan into Jordan.  Many still hold this belief, and definitely did in 1948-49. <br>  From the late-1800's up until the mid-1930's, a large flow of Jews entered Palestine, which conceded with incincreasedimistreatmentnd prprejudicegainst Jews all over Europe, with pogroms happening reregularlyn Russia.<br>  <br>  In World War I, the British, in order to get Jewish, (and American), support for their war they promised them that they would do eveverythinghey could to establish a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration_of_1917)." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Dec...</a>  Whilst at the same time promising the Arabs that if they helped them fight their overlords the Ottoman Turks, they would also give them rulership over a pan-Arab state covering all Arab lands (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes-Picot_Agreement)." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes-Picot...</a><br>  <br>  In 1922 when the British Mandate of Palestine started, the population was 668,000 Arab, and 84,000 Jewish people lived in Palestine (what is today roughly Palestine & Jordan) = 11% Jewish people, owning only 2% of the land.  Between 1920 and 1945 367,845 Jews and 33,304 non-Jews immigrated legally to Palestine, and another estimated 50-60,000 Jews entered illegally.  That is over 92% Jewish immigration into a what was a land made up of Arabs.  During this time the Arabs continually ararguedgainst what they saw as excessive Jewish immigration, and buying up of their land.  <br>  UnUnfortunatelyhe Arabs had a belief in the fact it was their land, and had been for centuries, and it would work out some way in the end.  However the Jewish Zionist were very organized, having ame from Europe with the idea of how to run companies/governments/etc and beat the Arabs in organisation hands down.  This coupled with the jewish Terrorist cacampaigngainst the British Mandate forces, put them in a better seat.  They akalsoad large support in the governments of Europe, whereas the Arabs really only had the Americans, who actually pulled out of the process to find a just settlement, when they shown this wasn't to happen. <br>   By 1946 the numbers had shifted to 1,237,000 Arabs & 608,000 Jews, with 94% and 6% of land ownership respectively.  In the end the UN decided to partition Palestine into an Arab and a Jewish state - 43% of the land went to the Arabs, and 56% to the Jews, with JeJerusalemo be a International City.  Not surprising the Arabs were unhappy with this, and refused to except it, whilst the Jews in end did except the plan, buit refused to except the exexistencef the Palestinian states.<br>    So when the State Of Israel declared InIndependence the Arab armies of Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Iraq declared War on the new Jewish state.  This was something the Jews where only too happy to partake in - they had been sstockpilingweapons, and training fighters for 20 years for such an event, and it gave them oopportunityto gain more land.<br>    This is where the 700,000 ARabs were displaced form their home in the First Arab-Israeli War of 1948-49.  The two main reasons were  Jewish fighters driving the Arabs from their villages and then destroying them, so they would have nothing to come back to, or sometimes destroying both people and village.  Hundreds upon hhundredsof Palestinian villages were wiped from the ground. Then there was also the cases of Arabs to leaving their homes for safety from the fighting, either off their own back or as asked by the Arab leadership in Palestine and the other Arab states.  During this War the Arabs ended up losing land, and went from controlling 43% of the land, down to 22%.<br>     The big debate is how many were forced out by the JJews andhow many of their own accord, and we will never know.  But it appears 50/50 at best.  However none of the Arabs that left were allowed back not their land, by every mean and law possible to the new Jewish state, many of which have been declared as racist by the UN.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  British Mandate of Palestine - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_of_Palestine" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Man...</a><br>  1948 Wiki - : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_exodus" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palest...</a><br>  I also say look at the al-nakba site - <a href="http://www.alnakba.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.alnakba.org/</a><br>  <br>  Sadly I won't be surprised if this thread doesn't last long, as someone is bound to take some offence at the truth.

It depends on which side you want to support. As you can seen from the responses one person's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. Arguably, Washington and the founding fathers could be so labeled. Remember, a large number of loyalist Americans were forced out of the Colonies.<br>  <br>  What is known is the British mandate (which had no vote or approval of anyone living there) had taken the place of the Turkish rule  (which had no vote or approval of anyone living there) Which had replaced Islamic rule ( (which had no vote or approval of anyone living there) ... you get the picture.<br>  <br>  In 1948 Britain pulled out, Israel was declared, the US recognized it and Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon mobilized their armies. Most of the rest of the Middle East joined in. Clearly nobody was going to be talking to anyone else.<br>  <br>  Here the confusion comes in and you can listen to both sides. The Palestinians left, were placed in refugee camps where they remain to this day. (See the Gaza Strip) One side says they were told to get out with promises that they'd come back when Israel was destroyed. The other side of the story is they were ruthlessly thrown out.<br>  <br>  Pick either side and you can make a good case for it.|`|AA11304025	After a long campaign of terrorism by immigrant jews from Europe the British gave up their mandate to govern Palestine and handed the problem to the new UN.<br>  Despite jews being in the minority in every administrative area of Palestine except Jaffa, the UN decided to partition Palestine into a jewish sector and an arab sector with Jerusalem as an international zone.<br>  This was done without the consent of the Palestinian people and they were not allowed a democratic vote or referendum on the proposal.<br>  In May 1948 the jewish terrorists declared the State of Israel and attacked many arab villages killing those who wouldn't get out.<br>  Over 700,000 Christians and Muslims were forced to flee into neighbouring countries as refugees where they have been ever since as the jews never allow anyone to return unless they are jewish.<br>  The official policy of the jews is to racially cleanse the region from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates as they claim their sky god promised this area to the jews.<br>  They still have some way to go so a lot of people will die yet.<br>  Google  - Stern Gang, LEHI, King David Hotel Jerusalem.<br>  Go to www.palestineremembered.com|`|UX4BOfsMaa	See the following website re U.N. partition and results.|`|7foleNaoaa	Yes, the Palestinians were displaced, which is why the Israeli/Palestinian conflict exists.  <br>  <br>  Basically:  Israeli's were kicked out of Palestine 2000 year previous, then came back to get it 2000 after.  However, during those 2000 years, the Palestinians lived there and developed the land.  So when the Israeli's came, thousands of Pali's were killed and hundreds upon thousands were displaced.

Also their hair combines to create one big hair lump rather than two separate heads.   IMO, that is not the best image for a prospective bride to see first off.

That's why there's a double space in the middle?<br>  <br>  It's kind of in between being a song and a poem. Most poetry won't directly address love, as in "this is what I think of love." Try creating a metaphor in the poem. Let people know how you actually feel, instead of giving them a riddle wrapped in language. <br>  <br>  The last stanza is approaching something poetic. Where did the elephants come from? It's interesting and I kinda want to know. <br>  <br>  Why is stanza two in quotations? Is someone supposed to have spoken those words? If so, I don't buy it. Nobody talks like that. "See not the pain"? Wouldn't it be "Don't look at the pain" or "Forget the pain"?<br>  <br>  Here's a love poem by Jane Cooper. It shows how an author can really put their own feelings into a poem and show what they think about love, instead of telling what they think about love.<br>  <br>  Rent<br>  <br>  If you want my apartment, sleep in it<br>  but let's have a clear understanding:<br>  the books are still free agents.<br>  <br>  If the rocking chair's arms surround you<br>  they can also let you go,<br>  they can shape the air like a body.<br>  <br>  I don't want your rent, I want<br>  a radiance of attention<br>  like the candle's flame when we eat,<br>  <br>  I mean a kind of awe<br>  attending the spaces between us---<br>  Not a roof but a field of stars.
Yo3awDQmaa	These are my personal recommendations for books:<br>  (You can find my personal opinion of the one’s I’ve read at my blog CasCanRead.com)<br>  <br>  The House of Night series---It knocked me straight out of my Twilight obsession. Even though I am still hyped about the DVD and New Moon movie. The ending of the last book drove me nuts and I can't wait to find out what happens next.<br>   <br>  Vampire Academy series--I just finished this and I can't wait for the next one! It was awesome and totally made me cry like a million time and make me angry. It sure does keep you on your toes.<br>  <br>  Society of S—This book is very interesting. I believe it may be an adult book, but I’m not sure. It’s about a thirteen year old girl, but her vocabulary and English is advanced. It’s a good read though.<br>  <br>  The Morganville Vampire series—This series is pure amazingness. Love, Love, Love it! It’s really at a tie with House of Night with amazingness.<br>  <br>  Peeps—very interesting (in a guys point of view.)<br>  <br>  Someone Like You by Sarah Dessen—awesome book!<br>  <br>  The Gallagher Girls series is interesting...It's about a girl that goes to spy school. The first book is "I'd tell you I love you, but then I'd have to kill you".<br>  <br>  The two books I actually enjoyed reading in school were Speak and Holes. Speak is a really good book.<br>  <br>  A few other books I have read recently and enjoyed are: Kissing Kate, The Bermudez Triangle, and Empress of the World.<br>  <br>  Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice.<br>  <br>  Some series that others have told me to read that are in the Young Adult/ Supernatural genre are: The Mortal Instruments series, Darkest Powers series,  Maxium Ride, Vampire Kisses series, The Vampire Diaries, The Uglies series, Chronicles of Narnia, Blue Bloods, Sookie Stackhouse series, and Sweep series.<br>  <br>  <br>  Then these more classical books: anything Jane Austen, To Kill a Mockingbird, Wuthering Heights, Great Expectations, Jane Eyre, Little Women, Odyssey, The Scarlet Letter, and Treasure Island. All of those are part of Barnes and Nobles Classic Collection.<br>  <br>  Any of these books listed can be found on Barnes and Noble to know what they are about.|`|mO1s4pMgaa	Evermore by Alyson Noel<br>  Ever was a normal high school girl living a pretty good life. But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?<br>  <br>  I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more. Some people told me they liked it better than Twilight too|`|8Fhhvrzbaa	Well my second favorite series is, "Secrets of my Hollywood Life." It is a really good series and I'm on the third one. Another good series is,"Poseur." I haven't read it but my friend did and she said it was really cool. And then there is the, "Clique","Princess Diaries","Gossip Girl",and, "Inkheart." There is alot to choose from! Good luck!|`|hxUXjg1faa	Well Marked by P.C Cast  is another good vampire series a lot different from Twilight.

Meet fifteen-year-old Echo, a typical teen trying to survive high school without being totally traumatized by boy trouble, friend drama, and school issues. As if she didn't have enough on her plate, Echo is also still dealing with the murder of her sister Zo. Although it's been over a year, Echo is still reeling from tragedy that changed everything. Beautiful and full of life, Zo was the glue that held her family together, and although the two sisters were as different as night and day, they still had a bond that Echo can't let go of. When Zo's old boyfriend Marc shows up one day with Zo's diary, Echo doesn't think there's anything in there she doesn't already know. But as she gives in to curiosity and starts reading, she learns that her sister led a secret life that no one could have guessed--not even Echo. <br>  “Alyson No?l finds the perfect balance of heartbreak and humor in this story about sisters, secrets and saying goodbye.  I loved every minute of it!”<br>  –Hailey Abbott, author of the New York Times bestselling Summer Boys series<br>  <br>  You will actually cry throughout this whole novel.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  Any novels by Sarah Dessen are amazing. ill give you a couple examples :):<br>  The Truth about Forever:<br>  Macy, 16, witnessed her father's death, but has never figured out how to mourn. Instead, she stays in control–good grades, perfect boyfriend, always neat and tidy–and tries to fake her way to normal. Then she gets a job at Wish Catering. It is run by pregnant, forgetful Delia and staffed by her nephews, Bert and Wes, and her neighbors Kristy and Monica. "Wish" was named for Delia's late sister, the boys' mother. Working and eventually hanging out with her new friends, Macy sees what it's like to live an unprescripted lifestyle, from dealing with kitchen fires to sneaking out at night, and slowly realizes it's not so bad to be human. Wes and Macy play an ongoing game of Truth and share everything from gross-outs to what it feels like to watch someone you love die. They fall in love by talking, and the author sculpts them to full dimension this way. All of Dessen's characters, from Macy, who narrates to the bone, to Kristy, whose every word has life and attitude, to Monica, who says almost nothing but oozes nuance, are fully and beautifully drawn. Their dialogue is natural and believable, and their care for one another is palpable. The prose is fueled with humor–the descriptions of Macy's dad's home-shopping addiction are priceless, as is the goofy bedlam of catering gigs gone bad–and as many good comedians do, Dessen uses it to throw light onto darker subjects. Grief, fear, and love set the novel's pace, and Macy's crescendo from time-bomb perfection to fallible, emotional humanity is, for the right readers,
F1qHLgdtaa	As the reader can see in “Pride and Prejudice,” if not in our own lives, people are often quick to form opinions of others based solely on first impressions, and unfortunately many of those opinions stick around. Elizabeth Bennet quickly forms her opinions of others, most importantly in the first acquaintances with Mr. Darcy, and with Mr. Wickham. <br>  “First Impressions” could be an appropriate title for Volume I of the novel simply due to the many first impressions made, both accurate and more importantly inaccurate, and the way they have such an effect on setting up the novel. The relationships which develop throughout this story are greatly influenced by the first impressions that are formed between the main characters.<br>  In chapter three, it is said the Mr. Darcy is “the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.” Mr. Darcy is seen as a very proud man.<br>  Elizabeth Bennet however doesn’t even see it as pride, but rather she sees it as vain narcissism. Her dislike of him is heightened when he later refers to her as tolerable but not appealing enough for him to ask her to dance. Mr. Darcy initially acts as though Elizabeth is not good enough for him to make acquaintance with her and he also bases his impression on her overexcited, unbearable mother who causes him to look down on the entire Bennet family. His original view of Elizabeth was certainly based on class, lack of wealth, and family connections. Their dislike of each other after their first meeting is mutual.<br>  Mr. Darcy’s opinion of Elizabeth begins to change within the next few chapters. As he sees more of her and begins listening to her speak, Mr. Darcy sees in Elizabeth “a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman,” and speaks of this affection to Miss Bingley. Elizabeth however is blind to Mr. Darcy’s new impressions due to her harsh judgment of him as “only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.”<br>  Unlike Mr. Darcy’s change in feeling, Elizabeth’s impression of Mr. Darcy is further supported as Volume I continues. This brings me to the next important first impression of Volume I which further adds to the appropriateness of the suggested title. The first impression of Wickham is that he is a fine gentleman, “his appearance greatly in his favour”. Just as Elizabeth decided on her dislike of Darcy upon their first acquaintance, she decided quickly on her approval of Mr. Wickham. Elizabeth never once doubts the attractive gentlemen as he shares personal stories with her, and leading her to believe that Mr. Darcy has been a horrible friend to him. Elizabeth completely believes Mr. Wickham, because of a positive first impression, adding to her false impression of Mr. Darcy.<br>  Other than these few examples of first impressions that are made in Volume I, each which are vital important to the growth and development of the characters, there is also the importance that Mrs. Bennet gives first impressions when she is fretting over her daughters finding a husband. Whenever a guest is expected, Mrs. Bennet is always fussing about her daughters’ appearance, not only in dress but in activity.<br>  While I do think that “First Impressions” would rightfully fit as a title for Volume I there are many events outside of their first meeting that affect Elizabeth’s and Mr. Darcy’s view of each other, so the title kind of looses its relevance after Volume I. I am fonder of “Pride and Prejudice” as the novel title because it accurately conveys the major flaws in the main characters. “First Impressions” is certainly an important aspect of the novel, but “Pride and Prejudice” the more on-going theme, develops and resolves in the story making it the better suited title.|`|532LT9C7aa	No. It was a working title for good reason--it too directly stated the premise of the central relationship in the book. Readers would have figured out pretty quickly that what Darcy and Elizabeth think about each other is exactly that--a first impression--and those notions will be predictably changed during the course of the book. But changing the title to what those first impressions actually are--the embodiments of each character's faults--Austen made the title more vague. The reader has to figure out which is exhibiting pride and which prejudice, but even when she has figured that out, she doesn't know for sure where Austen is going to take the characters. <br>  <br>  A vague (but still tied-in) title is always preferable to one that's too "on the nose."|`|sRGESDz1aa	first impressions was the original title while she was writing the book.

Here are over 100 free Dance moves in the 2 Step:    http://www.videodance.com|`|xQwU590Laa	There are dances done just to certain songs, and others done to types of music.  Depending on where you live, they might have 50 different dances- or 20, or 60, or just 10.  Depends on how much two steps they do, etc.    Many steps are in many dances, so you build a repertoire of various steps as you learn dances.   taking lessons is lots easier than trying to learn on the fly.  If you have to learn on the fly, watch some steps, do those, then watch the next set and do those, and keep adding 4 or 8 steps until you have the dance.    If you know what foot you start with, and then what steps to take, WHAT FOOT YOU ARE ON AT ANY POINT IS NOT IMPORTANT.  If you do the steps correctly, you ARE on the correct foot.  So it is much more important to remember what steps to take than trying to remember, right, left, right, left, right, left, kick with right,      Your body already knows which foot is free to use.  Your brain does not know, has to think about it, and ALWAYS makes the wrong choice.    You really have only two options.  Do something with the foot that does not have weight on it, or hop on the foot that has weight.  Hops are very rare, so you need to know WHAT to do with the free foot.

OhWmu0R3aa	They weren't.    Don't forget that the colonists were viewed as fellow Englishmen and the whole idea of fighting what would essentially be another English Civil War was somewhat unpalatable to most within the Westminster government.    Many of the complaints made by the colonists were addressed within parliament and dealt with. The scrapping of the Stamp Act being one example and the lowering of tax on tea being another. The latter, unfortunately, caused alot of trouble amongst the wealthier families and individuals since their loot had been gathered through the illegal smuggling of tea which now was being undercut by the low price of legitimate tea sales; it was this that led to the Boston Tea Party.    The major complaint of the colonists that modern Americans are fond of quoting is "taxation without representation". However, all colonists were as equally represented in parliament as the average Briton and at no point were there any requests from the colonists to actually have a representative within the House of Commons; especially since being an MP at that time was an unpaid position and no one wanted to leave their profitable American businesses and take the job on, certainly not those who would later shout the loudest for "liberty!".    When conflict eventually broke out, it proved to be one of the most unpopular wars that Britain became involved in, with all levels of British society being dubious of it's merit. It was this, as much as any military shortcomings, that eventually prevented any further engagement.|`|GHefTsUyaa	The United States wanted to become an independent nation free from British imperialism.|`|f9crUDTwaa	We were like disobedient children who needed to be straightened out .

Taxation without representation was an issue but the British counter argument was that taxes in the colonies were less than 10% of what they were in the UK, plus the UK were paying for the defence of the Colonies from the French and Native American tribes.    You have to remember that Britain and America being separated by a huge distance communications were delayed. So Britain had a tin ear to american concerns I don't think they realised how serious things were. And once the american colonies got to the point of making threats the British government felt they couldn't back down.

JyXfC3IGaa	Use the 2 decriptions of Starry Night & The Old Mill that I gave you on your other questions. It should be very easy for you to compare from them from the descriptions that I gave you.    Note: Notice I said not to copy word for word if that was for an assignment. Those descriptions came from scholarly articles that my professors used as handouts and that I myself used while teaching classes.
JyXfC3IGaa	In 1888, Vincent van Gogh left the cold, gray winter of Paris and moved to the town of Arles, in southern France. The colors and light of the south were an inspiration to him, and van Gogh created more than two hundred paintings in fifteen months. Although this work is called The Old Mill, it had most likely by that time been converted into a farmhouse. The farms and fertile fields of the area can be seen in the background, as well as the Arpilles mountains north of Arles, and a pale green sky.     Van Goghs major contribution to the history of modern art was his use of color. He was one of the first artists to free color from a merely descriptive function; that is, objects did not have to be reproduced on canvas in their natural colors. Van Gogh had specific and well thought out theories of painting, which were clearly articulated in hundreds of letters to his brother and friends. He wanted to represent emotions through the use of color, line, texture, and light  how he felt about a particular scene or subject. This painting represents his joy in the colors, beauty, light, and warmth of the south.    Van Gogh was often criticized for working too quickly. However, a closer look at The Old Mill will reveal the care with which the brushstrokes were applied. He used various types of brushstrokes for different parts of the landscape: for example, short directional ones for the foliage; long, vertical ones for the purple fence posts; and smooth, curved strokes for the sky. Van Gogh wrote that he thought about each painting at length in advance, thus could work quickly when he finally began to paint. For this reason, he said, "when anyone says that such and such is done too quicklythey have looked at it too quickly."    There are many misconceptions about Vincent van Gogh. He is often viewed as a tragic hero whose genius was cut down prematurely by his suicide at age thirty-seven. There is no doubt that he suffered from some sort of illness that caused periods of irrational behavior, especially late in his life. Although no one will ever know with certainty, the most widely accepted theory is that he suffered from some form of epilepsy, perhaps compounded by digitalis poisoning, glaucoma, over-consumption of absinthe, or syphilis. When suffering from an attack, van Gogh could not paint, although work done during his periods of lucidity often reflect his suffering. It is important to remember, however, that many of his paintings  including The Old Mill represent joy rather than suffering.|`|DSp8azw7aa	Van Gogh can be regarded as the father of modern Expressionism.     Working in Arles in 1888 he painted his greatest pictures, he wroted to his brother Theo, he describes the strange elation, a kind of heightened awareness, with which he worked. 'I have a terrible lucidity at moments these days, when nature is so beautiful I am not conscious of myselft anymore, and the pictures comes to me as in a dream.'    In these paintings he combines the heightened colour of Impressionism with writhing forms and dynamic bruch strokes to express his strong emotions. eg. 'Cornfield and Cypress'. and 'The Old Mill , 1888.       During 1889 there followed a period of mental breakdown until, having painted a few last tragic pictures, which express his final agony of mind, he committed suicide in 1890.        Van Gogh is characteristic of that kind of artist who finds release through his work by process of unburdening.    http://www.vangogh.artist-art.com/The_Ol...  http://www.albrightknox.org/curatorial/1...|`|vk10Pbb9aa	Go To This Web Address! hope it helps!    http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/v...

WTXvmcxcaa	I write them all. You know, I am writing several stories right now. In fact, I have more ideas coming at me for new ones than the ones I am working on currently. So, you are having problems? Don't worry, your not alone. I forget things constantly. So, I try to have a pencil or pen wherever I go. I have stuff written all over my notebooks, binders, folders, even myself. Of course, my mom was kind of freaked out about the whole writing on my myself part. :P <br>  <br>  Oh, and try not to get too overwhelmed. A good writer never has just one story going on in his/her head.     <br>  <br>  I know that I get tired of writing things by hand, so go on to google. Get a google account..... you know, gmail. Then, you can use something called GoogleDocs. It is really useful. You can use it from any computer anytime, just as long as you have a Google account. <br>  <br>  Good luck and good writing!|`|394ff47f78f7ed3b7394395aaf14b639aa	What helps me whenever I get an idea, is to write as long as things flow, as soon as I become distracted, I stop and start on the new idea. After 6 months of a year, you should comeback to all of your beginnings and find the one that really inspires you, that one that gets your mind rushing with ideas again, and continue working on it.|`|InzHK1rcaa	Write your plots down in a little note pad when you receive them.

Finally I went and picked one story that I really love to write and thats the only binder I open. And when inspiration comes for another story I take out a notebook I got from the dollar store and scribble down the idea that came to mind with just enough info that next time I look at it I know what I was thinking of at the time. Sometimes it's images, a girl looking down a dark stone stairwell, or phrases I want to use, "Eggs come from chicken butts?" but after I get the basic idea down I go and read a bit of the story I'm working on and am able to focus on that story again and get back to work.|`|mgB9MGBHaa	I have the exact same problem that you do, which is why I have only ever finished one short story when I have ideas for a gazillion other stories and novels floating around in my head or barely started. And even with the story I finished, the only way I finished it was by forcing myself to do so. I agree with many of the people who have already answered you question: whenever you get an idea, write it down! You can't afford to forget that ideas later. Then you have to just pick one and go with it. For me, as I said above, the only way I get things done is even when I really want to write on another one of my great ideas, I force myself to keep writing on the thing I have already committed to. Then things get done, and you'll look back after you've written it and say "I'm glad I did that," and then move on to the idea you'd been wanting to write on earlier.<br>  I hope that made sense or helped somewhat. It's kind of subjective, and personal, so it's really whatever works best for you. I'd try this once, and if it doesn't seem to get you anywhere or it just doesn't seem desirable then you can use some of the other ideas that have been put out here.|`|FgafJ4zgaa	It's nice to know others have the same problem.<br>  <br>  I don't know if this will help because I'm in the same situation.And I haven't written in months.But always write it down , whether it's a character concept or story idea.You don't have to write them all at the same time.If you have just a few scraps that could become a story,store it and allow it to develop over time.Like wine!Also.Only write for the story when your excited for it.Like your hyped about it!
8vGq6cRTaa	I think Leekeworld sells some horns and ears with a strong cylindrical button magnet embedded in the base and they give you another strong button magnet to put inside the head to magnetically hold on the horn.

I'm sure someone else around here has modded dolls and attached horns, though, and can tell you for certain.<br>  <br>  As for the size, it will matter a little. I don't know if you've ever seen pictures of SD- and MSD- size dolls standing or sitting together, but the size difference can be incredible. I bought two MSD-size dolls to be younger siblings for one of my SD-size boys and the size difference makes it looks like they're his children. Anyway, the point is that horns made for SD are going to be made for a much different scale than MSD. I imagine that, in theory, you can use horns made for one size on the other, but you run the risk of having them look very out-of-scale on your doll. In the end, it really depends on the exact look you're going for. If they aren't too expensive, maybe you could buy the SD horns and see how they look with your MSD when she arrives.

KBBonf97aa	The best thing you could do is go to a guitar store and test drive a bunch of guitars, since each brand tends to have its own sound and feel.  If you haven't played before, you'll probably want a guitar with a thin neck and low action (distance between the strings and fretboard), since those will make it easier for you to move between notes and chords comfortably.<br>  <br>  I usually recommend Ibanez for beginners, since they're built like rocks, sound fantastic, and are often nicer than guitars costing twice as much.  They've also got nice, thin necks.  Fender and Squier by Fender guitars are also great, reliable guitars with thin necks.  Epiphone makes very nice guitars, as well, though the necks are a bit fatter than those of Ibanez or Fender guitars, which can make them challenging for beginners.  If you have large hands, that might not be an issue, but it's good to play a few guitars before deciding.<br>  <br>  If you want to do some research before going to a guitar store, I recommend having a look around the Musician's Friend website.  You can search by brand, price or customer rating.  The site also has reviews posted by customers that will give you a much better idea as to which guitars are great players and which ones mostly look good in photos.  I usually start at the MF site and then go to a guitar store and play the models that caught my interest.  Here's a link to the electric guitars at MF:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/electric-guitars/solid-body" rel="nofollow">http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/elect...</a><br>  <br>  The most important thing is to choose a guitar that feels really comfortable in your hands.  A lot of people will tell you a guitar isn't worth owning if it doesn't have a certain brand name on the headstock, but those people are just guitar snobs.  There are plenty of guitars that play beautifully, look good and will last decades.  Just see which ones feel most comfortable to you and trust your instincts.  The more comfortable the guitar is, the more you'll play and the sooner you'll become a good guitarist.

And believe me, none of them thought you were really clumsy.  If they thought you were clumsy, they wouldn't combine it with cute.  So why did that one guy say 'clumsy & cute' together.  Because he was with other guys.  It's a stupid guy thing.  But the guy that said it, he would take you out in a heartbeat.

It was so easy, in fact, that once in the islands, it seemed the most natural thing in the world just to keep going on around. At first, he hoped to find a companion to share the adventure, but few schoolboys have parents as lenient as were Robin's mother and father. Then he made up his mind to do it alone, just as had Captain Slocum back in 1895-1898. But where Slocum had made his voyage at the end of a long career at sea, Robin would be doing it at the beginning of his, and if successful he would become the youngest person ever to sail alone around the world..."

dZyoGbUdaa	"A Moveable Feast" is my favorite Hemingway.  Its a memoire of his youth spent in Paris as a struggling writer during his first marriage.  It was published posthumously but i think it contains his best, most fluid and poignant, writing.<br>  <br>  I like "The Nick Adams Stories" too.  Nick Adams is the second thing I read by Hemingway and its what convinced me he is one of the great American writers.|`|4HoVVCenaa	For Whom the Bell Tolls is my favorite, but I believe most think Farewell to Arms is his best work. Old Man and the Sea is also considered to be one of his best.|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	"The Old Man and The Sea" is his best in my opinion.  The moral metaphor is amazing.  Also, the writing is brilliantly simple.<br>  <br>  "A Clean, Well-Lighted Place" is one of his greatest short works,  I agree.|`|M0bE2IBQaa	'To Have and to Have Not' is my absolute favorite. Unfortunately it's probably one of his more undervalued works. <br>  <br>  But I also love Hemingway's short stories, especially the safari stories set in Africa. He was a prolific writer of short stories, and I have found that his writing in these small doses tends to be even more beautiful than in his longer works.|`|wLxmn2xtaa	Hemingway is one of my utmost favorite authors. "The Sun Also Rises" is great; but if I have to pick a favorite, I'll go with "For Whom the Bell Tolls." Lovely story with an intense setting. "A Farewell to Arms" and "Across the River and Into the Trees" are also definitely worth looking at amongst his other works.<br>  EDIT: I second Law Man's praise of "A Clean, Well-Lighted Place."|`|DnWsMhwLaa	men without women<br>  his style just takes well to short stories i think.|`|SS9hE8rnaa	My favorite novel is The Sun Also Rises, but any one of the "big four" (The Old Man and the Sea, A Farewell to Arms, and For Whom the Bell Tolls, alon with TSAR) would be wonderful.

I also enjoyed "The Sun Also Rises", but I'm not a big fan of "A Farewell to Arms".|`|WHcBV7rLaa	I just read the story "Hills Like White Elephants" this week, and I thought it was excellent|`|5478d54ea53fcef0ef93502a7e237c89aa	His short stories.

dXW9cPWMaa	When I start work on a lengthy manuscript, I have to make an outline before I can start. It usually ends up being roughly two or three pages, sometimes more, and is very general. It doesn't have every specific of the story, but I do know the general plot points and the ending. This way I don't lose track of the story and I can work in foreshadowing and character development as I go.<br>  <br>  In order to make a really good story, you need to have realistic, believable characters. I would suggest doing some good character-building exercises. You can find hundreds of these online if you just search it. Make sure you know the basics of their person and also how they react in certain scenarios. When you create great characters, they tend to take the reins and tell you what they want to do. It may not directly follow your outline, but it might even make it better.<br>  <br>  I always think of my manuscripts like movies. If it's not interesting and I wouldn't want to watch it in a movie, I don't write it into the manuscript. I mean, there's no point in creating characters to go through something boring or not developed.<br>  <br>  The most important part of writing a story, though, is being passionate about it and really enjoying what you're writing. You should also try to write at least a little bit every day, as much as you can. This way you won't get behind and then feel like it's not worth going back to; you also won't forget about the characters and what they really want.|`|52otNiElaa	You should write short stories instead. Save the novels for a story that has been in your head for a year or 2 and you have a general beggining middle and end by the time you write.|`|UKtZS3Wraa	make the ending up before you write the beginning/middle!<br>  that way, as youre writing, you know you want to continue because you have a GREAT ending in mind

qDSvOOwBaa	Yes, I agree your feelings about them are repulsive. Perhaps, I can give you some medicine for that. A real uniform stored properly that has clear ancestry and title such as a complete SS Sargent Major with all correct marks of rank-and they too are original-along with the leather jackboots could be worth about $ 100,000 or more. The quality of the material used was very inferior and the likelihood of the one you say you have has been properly stored for over 65 years is nonexistent.

ceBTTCPwaa	Jane Eyre is a first-person narrative of the title character, a small, plain-faced, intelligent and honest English orphan. The novel goes through five distinct stages: Jane's childhood at Gateshead, where she is abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she acquires friends and role models but also suffers privations; her time as the governess of Thornfield Manor, where she falls in love with her Byronic employer, Edward Rochester; her time with the Rivers family at Marsh's End (or Moor House) and Morton, where her cold clergyman-cousin St John Rivers proposes to her; and her reunion with and marriage to her beloved Rochester at his house of Ferndean. Partly autobiographical, the novel abounds with social criticism and sinister gothic elements.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Jane_Eyre" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Jane_Eyre</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/je/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/je/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/janeeyre/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/janeeyre/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-23.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/janeeyre/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/janeeyre/index...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmJaneEyre02.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/Titles/janeeyre" rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/janeyre.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/Jane_Eyre_by_Charlotte_Bronte/jane_eyre.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/J...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/jane2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/jane2.html</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Jane is living with her Aunt Reed and cousins at Gateshead, being bullied and tormented by John Reed in particular.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Jane Eyre/Timeline|`|11034de0d130c6ac4418af83607e0faeaa	She lived at her Aunt's estate called Gateshead.|`|lb6VI8XRaa	She lived with her Aunt Reed, and her cousins at their estate...I think it was called Gateshead

yOK32PM9aa	He believed that Marxism failed the "falsifiability test", (along with Freudianism and Astrology) and therefore forfeited its much-vaunted claim to "scientific socialism".  Whereas natural sciences allow, even invite, falsifiability, Marxists steered clear of making predictions that could be tested.  Whereas physicists hypothesise when eclipses are due - according to their theory - to take place and risk the falsification of the theory through observation, Marxists never commit to predictions specific enough to allow meaningful testing.  The proletarian revolution will take place "when the workers are ready", rather than at a specified time.  They offer "ad hoc hypotheses" (excuses, basically) as to why revolutions have not happened.  So if the theory is not scientific, it is pseudo-ecience if it claims to be, and is relegated to the status of mere ideology.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Popper astutely recognized that only open, democratic societies allow opinion to be both offered and criticized without fear of reprisal.

HORACAnlaa	Yes and when you throw in all the mass murder, the denying of fundamental rights, and torture it's unbelievable that anyone would need to doubt it. But since people have very short memories, lack historical knowledge and don't really understand their own natures expect the return of some form of Marxism. As Marx said, "History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce."<br>  <br>  ADD:<br>  <br>  It seems many people here are saying true Marxism has never been practiced because the Marxist regimes that have existed didn't follow the exact plan that Marx laid down, which is like saying fascism wasn't fully tried because everything in Mein Kampf didn't happen.|`|FoIxsunVaa	if you wanted me to consider marxism, you would have to wipe from my memory the way the Bolsheviks treated the anarchists in Russia.<br>  <br>  I am not sure if it is a valid disagreement, but it is a compelling one.<br>  <br>  Also the way the communists subverted and destroyed the Spanish Government during the Spanish Civil War.<br>  <br>  My fatal objection with most of left is the internal squabbling.

There may be countries governed by communist parties, but none have attempted to construct a political and economic system purely based on the writings of Marx. Therefore, it is not Marxism that has failed. <br>  <br>  My thoughts can be organized into the 4 points:<br>  <br>  1. The countries that have undergone communist revolutions were not truly ready, according to Marx, to move into communism. The economies of pre-revolution Russia, China, Cuba, North Korea, etc were all before their respective revolutions. How can a true communist revolution occur when the majority of the population are farmers, not workers as Marx required? Farmers are not classified as proletariat, as they have their own properties in the form of land.<br>  <br>  2. The western states seem to have found a balance between pure communism and pure capitalism. The degree of socialism differs from state to state, but most control the behavior of capitalists through labor laws, etc. This has the effect of dampening the class struggles by weakening the power of the capitalists to exploit their workers, but if a Marxist stance is taken, one may see these laws as simply prolonging the pain of class struggles and slowing down the pace of history. The balance between favoring the workers and capitalists is hard to maintain for most governments due to the nature of class antagonism, and as the capitalists naturally seek to increase their political power (through political donations, etc), this balance will become harder and harder to keep in the future.<br>  <br>  3. The military and economic powers of the western states that accumulated through centuries of imperialism force many less powerful countries to adopt the western liberal capitalist system. This ensures not only the spread of western political and military hegemony, but also the continuation of the "tradition" of exploitation of foreign markets (economic and military imperialism) as their trading partners become more dependent on the income generated through the globalization process, effectively reducing entire countries into factories filled with cheap labor (Eastern Europe after the fall of the USSR, China, India) as well as massive markets into which excess western goods (oftentimes manufactured in foreign factories) can be dumped at high costs. As Marx points out, imperialism is the highest stage of capitalism.<br>  <br>  4. The first country to attempt a communist system was Russia. Russia's political system was extremely backwards compared to the better developed states in western Europe and in North America, and this unfortunate "tradition" was carried over to the political system set up by the Bolsheviks. Though the Bolsheviks were equipped with the advanced political thought that was Marxism, they had no theory with which they could govern a country that was still in the process of industrialization. With nothing else to use, they chose the Czarist method they once denounced, which though inefficient and generally considered barbaric by modern western standards, was the tried-and-true way of governing Russia. Thus, the failure of the USSR was not necessarily the failure of the communist system, but rather the failure of Czarism and autocracy in Russia. Unfortunately for the non-Russian communist parties, as they had nothing better to go on, they too chose the Russian system to base their own governments on (it could also be attributed to the massive degree of influence the Russian communist party had on these national communist parties through Comintern and as the form of foreign aids), changing them from independent revolutionaries into similar autocratic rulers of their own countries. Fortunately, most of them have realized the problems with adopting the Russian method completely and modified their own systems according to the needs of their own countries, but traces of the Russian tradition still remain, and that is most likely what the western media obsess themselves over as the "evils of communism".|`|pnoQFcT4aa	In my experience there has never been a state which has practised Marxism or communism as Marx laid it out to be. There have been many expeditions into Communism but that must never be confused with Marxism itself. What the world saw as Communism (the former USSR, for example) is in itself a far cry from the ideology of Marx set out in The Communist Manifesto and Das Capital.<br>  <br>  Maybe when, rather than if, Capitalism fails, a Marxist state can be appreciated in its glory.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	1) Marxism has never been implemented. According to Marx, the proletariat is supposed to take power, stabilize it, *and hand it to the people*. This last step has never taken place in any communist regime. <br>  2) What would indicate failure? Nothing I see as a viable indicator would leave capitalism intact, especially given the world wide "bailout" going on at present.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	The problem with Marx's ideas is certain miscreants--Vladimir Lenin is the worst culprit and the a descipable little turd of a man--took Marxist theory and applied in a country which simply did not have the material mode of production (i.e. capitalism) ready for a proletariat revolution. Lenin felt the country of Russia was a the weakest link in the chain and would bring about socialism and when more educated Marxists--Georgi Plekhanov and Karl Kautsky--warned that Russia is not ripe for Marxism quite yet they were ignored and often times demonized by Lenin in his writings, such as The State and Revolution and The Proletariat Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky. Anyone who did not necessarily agree with Lenin and his sectarian minded version of Marx was often shut out of the loop. <br>  <br>  With that being said I do not think Marx or Marxism has much of future in our western world but I do encourage you to read some of his writings. It is quite insightful about our capitalist world and the private property and enterprise system, democracy, working class and revolutions and why revolutions happen. You may not always agree with him but you will feel he is a talented writer and a necessary philosopher.|`|yUudoO1Raa	The one quote remembered by everyone from Marx is: From each according to his ability; to each according to his need.<br>  <br>  This was demonstrated by three owners of the Twentieth Century Motor Car Company in the novel "Atlas Shrugged." The other day, Pres. Obama visited an American factory that operates on the same principles:<br>  Six weeks of paid time off, no matter how long they have worked there. This means the senior employees (when there are some) will be paying for the vacations of the newbies.<br>  ? Employees, no matter what their job description, HAVE THE SAME PAY SCALE, so the engineers with their expensive college degrees to pay off make no more than the factory worker, who is making more than he should because the engineer is making less than he should, comparatively.<br>  ? One percent of yearly revenues goes to solar systems donated to community groups.<br>  ? All major decisions would be made by consensus of all company employees. <br>  Well, the little point I want to stress is that Namaste has already benefited from generous government largesse to prop up his business.<br>  Namaste’s own website lays it out: <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2009/02/18/a-few-things-you-should-know-about-obamas-favorite-colorado-solar-panel-maker/" rel="nofollow">http://michellemalkin.com/2009/02/18/a-f...</a><br>  <br>  When Obama told Joe the plumber he wanted to "redistribute the wealth" he never denied he was Marxist. Biden made a fool of himself doing that on a Florida TV station, but Obama wisely kept his mouth shut.<br>  <br>  Marxism isn't dead. More and more, on TV and in other media, I hear talk about how people are already quiting the worlk force ala the strikers in "Atlas Shrugged." If enough people do go on strike, no amount of "stimulus" or "bail out" will help.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://baumanblog.sovereignsociety.com/2009/02/atlas-shrugged-from-fiction-to-fact-in-52-years.html" rel="nofollow">http://baumanblog.sovereignsociety.com/2...</a>|`|mCbChkKraa	No, as nobody brought Marxism to reality up to now.

AA11363680	There are a lot of crucial battles in that war. But the US would not have lost WW2 in a total sense. Germany would not have been in a position to invade the US for several years after conquering Europe and Russia.

The loss of a British front in Burmah may have caused greater problems for the Americans, but again, it is a question of time, rather than outcome.  The American troops used in D Day may have been employed on the Russian front, although a second front in the Med may have been viable, with US troops taking on North Africa.

The Battle of Britain and the invasion that was planed may have been as ill planned as the Russian invasion. It obviously was poorly planed. The Air plane assault was to be followed up by an amphibious assault that never took place because the air assault failed. The amphibious assault might have failed. The German Army still had to cross the Channel and the strongest fleet in the world at the time was waiting.  Then German Army might have been beaten in the ground battle in Britain itself. The United States might have entered the war then and there knowing the obvious position this would have put not only the United States in but the world. They could not afford the loss of one of there only remaining allies. The United States was already giving Great Britain Ships and arms under the lend lease program. <br>  <br>  The Fleet that was sunk at Pearl harbor might not have been there they my have been in the Atlantic and the war may have been ended sooner if the United States got involved earlier because it would have already been geared up for war. <br>  <br>  What people don't know now is that the United States once the Industrial Revolution took place in the mid 1800's is that this country had enormous natural resources. They also had the ability to turn those natural resource into what ever it needed, the biggest, the best, the strongest. The United States in 1940 till today has all the natural resources it needs in a pinch to defeat anyone in the world using conventional weapons and warfare. The rest of the world at the time was hoping we were not able to or to stupid or apathetic to pull the trigger . However, They all knew we could.<br>  <br>  Before the second world war the United States was one of the World Powers. After the Second World War we were, THE WORLD POWER! This is not my opinion, it is fact.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	While you're certainly correct that, had the Battle of Britain been lost, Germany would have invaded, it's not all that certain that they would have been able to win.  Even stipulating that they were able to win, and that therefore there would be no effective place to launch the invasion of Normandy from and that therefore Germany would be free to press the war against the Soviet Union, I think your projections of German world dominance by 1984 are pretty far fetched.  <br>  <br>  First, without slaving the bulk of the US effort to Europe, the US war against Japan would have come, and would certainly have been over considerably sooner.  Moreover, the US would very likely still have achieved the production of atomic arms well ahead of Germany, and developed, by 1944, the B-29 which was capable of trans-Atlantic operations.  Moreover, the US had a massive naval advantage over Germany, and Germany had never mounted a large scale, long-ranged amphibeous invasion effort, and would have been highly unlikely to have been able to do so across the Atlantic Ocean.  <br>  <br>  There's also Germany's sitiation to look at.  Nazi Germany was inherently unstable, with literally hundreds of assassination attempts against Hitler just in his short time in power, and with far too much power centralized with Hitler.  Hitler's emotional and intellectual instability and tendency to ingore fact in favor of hope and perception had grown into a very serious set of problems by mid-1944.  Given his age and health problems, it's unlikely that Hitler would have lived much past 1950, anyway, and with his death would have come, at the very least, a major shift in focus and efficiency of the Nazi party.  At worst, it would have led directly to a major civil conflict as the various party and military power domains struggled for dominance.  Finally, even with Britain out of the way, the German military was grossly over-extended, and were curiously behind in technology in certain areas (such as artillery transport and motor transport). <br>  <br>  I think that the Battle of Britain was certainly very important, and the survival of Great Britain was also crucial to the eventual defeat of Nazi Germany, but to suggest that Hitler's Nazi party could have continued expanding without end, across the most daunting natural obstacles in the world seems very, very unlikely to me.|`|Fex51ntIaa	You're forgetting the the fact that the Germans got their arses handed to them in Russia and form that point on, were always retreating.

There are non-religious people who are good, and non-religious people who are bad.<br>  <br>  As to whether or not religious people have a higher or lower percentage of virtuous people than non-religious people - that's difficult to say. <br>  <br>  I would say that, as a whole, if you chose one person from a pool of "religious people" (people who actively go to church or study their religion on a regular basis... not just people who 'believe' something without actively doing anything) and chose one person from a pool of "non-religious people" (everyone else not in the first group) - you're more likely to find a virtuous person in the religious group.<br>  <br>  But, I would also say that the non-virtuous person who is religious is far more dangerous to society, to their religion, and to other people, than the non-virtuous, non-religious person.|`|BnR4LLhxaa	In the first place, your premise is wrong - do you have any evidence that supports your first statement? I know from personal experience that many scientists are deeply religious; religious belief does not have anything to do with pursuit of answers to questions based on a scientific approach. <br>  <br>  In the second place, your actual question has nothing to do with the anything else you said. You appear to be trying to link someone's virtue with their profession, which is absurd. It is also foolish to try to link someone's virtue to their belief in a deity. <br>  <br>  Belief in some god may encourage someone to be virtuous, but is cannot assure it; likewise lack of belief in a god does not relate to lack of virtue. I have seen plenty of people in all combinations of those categories.|`|FKmmvwgMaa	I'm not sure you can say that the thinkers, philosophers, scientists are either agnostic or atheist to begin with. In fact, out of the types of scientists that study the universe (cosmology) most believe in God. I think most biologist do too. For that matter I would think that most geologists would too. I suggest The Case For Creation as a good resource on that argument. <br>  <br>  On the flip side I totally get what your saying. A whole lot of people who go to church keep up a front, a scene, in which they are good but when behind closed doors they are in fact rotten to the core. They also tend to look down upon and/or mock those who don't attend church or believe in their philosophies. I've met plenty a person who was religious in one way or another who are just plan mean. And many would consider an Islamic extremist who is a suicide bomber evil, when the extremist is just following his faith. <br>  <br>  On the flip side of that argument I would say that I've also seen many a evil agnostic and atheist. They tend to just say there is no judgment so I can do whatever I want to, to whomever I can get away doing it to. And they do. And they hurt people doing it. <br>  <br>  In closing I think that it is safe to say that being either agnostic/atheist or religious in and of it self does not make one virtuous. Virtue must come from a hidden place in the soul. A place in which all things are both hidden and revealed and which no man can see but except the one to whom the soul belongs.|`|GlteTTauaa	Perhaps you shouldn't lump all religions as destructive , Einstein respected Buddhism , quoting that Buddhism will be the religion of the future and a Physicist respected Hinduism .<br>  <br>  here are some quotes to prove my point .<br>  <br>  In Hinduism, Shiva the Cosmic Dancer, is perhaps the most perfect personification of the dynamic universe. Through his dance, Shiva sustains the manifold phenomena in the world, unifying all things by immersing them in his rhythm and making them participate in the dance- a magnificent image of the dynamic unity of the Universe. (Capra, The Tao of Physics)<br>  <br>  The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend personal God and avoid dogma and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this description. If there is any religion that could cope with modern scientific needs it would be Buddhism. (Albert Einstein)<br>  <br>  if you're talking about Christianity and Islam then I understand your criticism .|`|9r9ehT2paa	Show me an atheist, and i will show you someone who is angry at God.|`|FoIxsunVaa	60% of the scientific community claim to believe in God.

QYPrM3GPaa	Wow.  Now this is a very interesting question, and it takes two forms dosn't it.  The first form is as a science question.  The second question is a spiritual question.<br>  <br>  What you want to know is, what happens to the energy that is "you" when you die.  This is how I understand it and this is how I will answer it.<br>  <br>  1).  Energy does not "have" to do anything.  From a scientific standpoint, energy is what energy is.  Einstein demonstrated that E=mc^2, that energy equals mass x the speed of light squared.  What this equation relates simply is that energy and matter are one and the same thing.  Matter is just a much more condensed and "slower" form of energy.  Note, that everything in the universe vibrates, including the atoms of molecules of matter (mass).  So nothing is completely "at rest" ever.  Energy may be transformed but it may not be destroyed.  This is the law of the conservation of energy.  Exploding a nuclear weapon demonstrates that Einstein was right - matter can be converted to it's equivalent energy, and given the right conditions (most likely, a tremendous source of gravity, such as a black hole), energy can be condensed into matter.  <br>  <br>  2). The second part of your question is what gets into spirituality and defines WHO and WHAT you really are.  Of course, there is no scientific proof, so that is what relegates this to spirituality and not science.  Here is what I think:<br>  <br>  You are NOT your body.  You are a spiritual being called a SOUL (for a lack of better word), I think "Spiritual Being" is better than soul.  Your spiritual being is 100% energy (as far as I know, although, I have read that some of your mass is transferred into the afterlife when you die).  There is some indication that this may be true, because immediately after people die, there is an immediate loss of "weight."    This has been measured by medical authorities and is not a guess - but a science fact.<br>  So there is every real possibility that you do, in fact, take SOME of your mass as YOU, with you as a spiritual being.  Now, since energy and matter are directly related, could it be possible, that some of your body mass is translated into its energy equivalent when you die?  THis is a good question I do not have an answer for, but I keep open to possibilities like this.<br>  <br>  Your MIND and your EGO and your BODY die when you die, but your experiences in life continue eternally (including the knowledge of who you were - as Jane Doe in this life, etc.).  But you are not just Jane Doe, nor is this the only life that you have lived.  Your "personality" along with your "experiences" merges back into the HIGHER SELF that is your Spiritual Being, and you then re-aquire all the knowledge and memory of your eternal Self...you have access not only to all of Jane Doe's life, but every other life you have ever lived.  Since the Spiritual Being that is you is energy, it cannot be destroyed and is eternal, forever, never ending, alpha and omega.  But the energy that is YOU is not just any old energy, it is sacred energy.  It is intelligent energy, it is self-aware as a BEING...this, as opposed to energy that is not self-aware, what I call unaware energy - this is energy which has LIFE in it too, but that energy has not evolved yet to a state of self-awareness.<br>  <br>  Your energy that is YOU will always BE, no matter what you may transform to.  It will always be YOU.  You need not worry about dying because death is only a re-birth BACK to where you came from in the first place - just realize, you are a spiritual being having a body experience.  The illusion is thinking that this world is real and has substance.|`|27ff3ae0ea44baa8d83a0cb0117b9053aa	the caliber of your Q's is superb.<br>  if only i could spend an eternity answering them.<br>  know this:<br>  you will barely recognize the difference, at first.... you won't eat; you won't use the toilet; you won't have sex, but you will still feel like the you that you know.<br>  here's another clue:<br>  *the ego survives death*|`|RLqmrHlIaa	Energy doesn't transform into something.

The hydrogen atoms in the ocean have presumable contained their energy in a given form for 13.5 Billion years.,<br>  <br>  You however are descended from patterns of energy that have been living & dying for billions of years, so it's a bit of a stretch to imagine that YOUR pattern will somehow be exempt.

v70p2kgWaa	Hum, Haddix's article is one that gets vadalized every once in a while(rude jokes appear about once a month).  It very well could be a joke, or it could be real.  I've gone and removed it from the article and placed it in the talk with a note that it needs a source.  Like you I have found no sources to back this claim up.<br>  <br>  additional note:<br>  There are several markers point to a joke.  The note about it seems to be from mid 2008, yet details for the second book were known (which doesn't make sense given Haddix's current projects). Haddix is pretty open about her publication timetable.  Her recent projects were a companion to Just Ella and continuing the Missing series (the second book's publication was pushed from spring 09 to Aug 09, so that also eats at the calm of a parallel series to Shadow Children).  If the timetable set by the claim were true Haddix would have released the first book in 2008.

Generally, our species appreciates that beautiful sunset, a great play or movie, a job well done, heros, birth, and the "eternal" over the "transient" because of metaphysical value judgments we make.<br>  <br>  Metaphysics, "in the formation of a sense of life, [which has since come to be called a "world view"] is the term “important.” It is a concept that belongs to the realm of values, since it implies an answer to the question: Important—to whom? Yet its meaning is different from that of moral values. “Important” does not necessarily mean “good.” It means “a quality, character or standing such as to entitle to attention or consideration” (The American College Dictionary).<br>  "“Important”—in its essential meaning, as distinguished from its more limited and superficial uses—is a metaphysical term. It pertains to that aspect of metaphysics which serves as a bridge between metaphysics and ethics: to a fundamental view of man’s nature.<br>  "Is the universe intelligible to man, or unintelligible and unknowable? Can man find happiness on earth, or is he doomed to frustration and despair? Does man have the power of choice, the power to choose his goals and to achieve them, the power to direct the course of his life—or is he the helpless plaything of forces beyond his control, which determine his fate? Is man, by nature, to be valued as good, or to be despised as evil?"

38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	I agree with the people who said to cut out the descriptions.  This is basically implying that you think your readers have no imagination of their own.<br>  <br>  You also have several different ideas crammed into one paragraph and there are incomplete sentences and mixed tenses.<br>  <br>  There is a fine line between using adjectives to enhance and move the story along and filling up space.

What I do not understand is why this book is not in print.<br>  <br>  Many of the previous reviewers have given this author the 'rightly' deserved accreditation for this lovely tale.<br>  <br>  What did 'I' think of this book?<br>  As my title review states, this was a very refreshing change from the humdrum historical novels one finds on the shelves of book stores. Indeed, the characters were wonderfully human and the protagonists were written with a style that anyone could easily relate to. Within the story, explanations abound, so that one can never be confused as to what is gong on within the subplots, and there are many.<br>  <br>  I enjoyed, particularly, the two French brothers, Alan and Philippe. They both had a boyish naivety that reminded my of my husband when he was a young, newly married man. King Harold was an immensely strong character with an obvious love for his country, yet with an undercurrent of guile that made this personage so believable.<br>  <br>  I was also impressed by the way the author made a genuine attempt to portray the personality of the Norman, Duke William. This was a fine piece of characterization and must have taken a great deal of thought to get the duke into perspective for his role in the story.<br>  <br>  The women portrayed were, I thought, less than strong as they could have been, but, nonetheless, the writer made great strides in molding their personalities to fit the moment. I sensed this man has a great deal of understanding of the female psyche, and I congratulate him for his achievement in being honest in his view of the women in this story.<br>  <br>  As for the events that Mr Bradbury has written of, they were extremely well researched. The true events flowed, mixed and blended very well with the fictitious happenings within the story<br>  <br>  In conclusion: Every chapter is full of drama and excitement and is a page turner. Mr Bradbury has a personal and exciting writing style. The book is so well written that I cannot see why this was placed, free to all, on Internet Archive. This book is so worthy of publication and should be given the due accreditation it deserves. I wish to thank My Bradbury for giving me a wonderful experience in literature.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have given, in this review, my honest opinion, and I award the author a five star rating.<br>  <br>  Jillian Norton|`|A6ylS5bJaa	I definetly think it isn't a copy of Twilight.

Once you recall the incident/s causing the resentment, examine them in the "light of reason" and when you fully grasp that you (the child) did not cause the mistreatment/disrespect  - that the adult was wrong and  arbitrary in their behavior - the present urge and attachment to cynicism will disappear.

That doesn't make you cynical. I would like a man like you, with some dignity. <br>  <br>  However you may have only meant that as an example. To address the issue as a whole  to be less cynical you need to change your perceptions of the world or situations:<br>  <br>  For example:<br>  <br>  1. Meditate - Let suppose (you don't have to believe) that there is a God and s/he is good all the time. How can you change the way that you perceive situations in life which you are negative about as positive or more importantly, JUST (as in justice). You may even want to make a list of things you think are negative, then go through point by point. <br>  <br>  2. Gratitude - You may want to start writing a journal or find a special rock. In the journal, or while holding the rock, think of all the things you are grateful for. Do this daily and it will transform your life. <br>  <br>  3. Mirror- The world you see and perceive is a reflection of the inner you. So if you are cynical about the world ,maybe you have a little internal work to do on yourself. <br>  <br>  4. If life has given you a particularly challenging obstacle then try this. On one side of the paper write all the things you dont like about the situation. On the other side write all the things you are learning from the situation. Without fail the second column will always be much longer than the first. <br>  <br>  <br>  The bottom line is "you live the life you love, you love the life you live, everyhting you have in mind jah will give". The universe gives you the world you love and ask for. Love and ask for a different world and it will be true.

It is the first book of the Twilight series, and introduces seventeen-year-old Isabella "Bella" Swan who moves from Phoenix, Arizona, to Forks, Washington, and finds her life in danger when she falls in love with a vampire, Edward Cullen. The novel is followed by New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn.<br>  Love them!!they are great!!!|`|UkWXO9gXaa	There is Twilight,new moon,eclipse,and breaking dawn by stephenie meyer.These books are about vampires.A vampire falls in love with a human.It is very interesting.each time u want to stop reading you cant because u get sucked into the books.I recommend them.|`|4FqP313qaa	the twilight saga is a book series by stephenie meyer..|`|lJhB4GSnaa	The Twilight Saga is a series about vampires<br>  <br>  The author is Stephanie Meyer|`|1g9EJiwIaa	it is a book series by Stephanie Meyer including 4 books; Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn. you should really read them if you can.
wrKQsGxaaa	i personaly love the twilight saga i read it ten times <br>  i has romace and action (also most people say it<br>  has osme horrier in it but i fail to see it.) also i think that you shouldnt <br>  care what other ppl think about the books<br>  you like to read its your self<br>  btw yor english is very good its better then most ppl i know<br>  im currently studing chineese|`|KJpWSZx1aa	i absolutely love the twilight saga.<br>  i've never read a book twice before... and since have read the first one 5 times!|`|iLKnmyAMaa	they're great books. i gotta say i got a little upset when reading New Moon, and Breaking Dawn kinda drug on for a little while without anything really happening, but they're awesome books!<br>  <br>  I also read the books before the movie version of the book (which sucked), so i didn't get too caught up in the Twilight craze. Now it seems EVERYONE is reading it, and it's getting a tad overrated.<br>  <br>  p.s. Your english is fine!|`|XYK5jfAraa	your english is good enough. <br>  <br>  twilight here is insane! it seems like you either love it or you hate it. <br>  <br>  i loved it!|`|5743giZHaa	i loveeeeeeeeeeee sta grande saga.....si ho kuore napoletano..je aime twilight....te quiero twilight...ciao isa...rikordati voglio entra' nella family......ahahahahah|`|pEDavW3caa	well i think the twilight saga is incredible with its romance and science fiction. edward and bella's romance was inevitable. i love all the characters in it. great job to stephenie meyer.|`|Tn6HVR6Taa	I've read it and LOVE it!!!<br>  And your English is great!|`|CikHeKK6aa	its one of my fave|`|3VLB9c5Daa	I love it too! My favorites are the first and third. By the way did you read them in italian or in english? I read a bit of the first one in spanish and quality is lost in the translation... by the way you write well in english :D Ciao!|`|TWXizzOtaa	Your English is alright. <br>  <br>  I guess Twilight's...eh.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm sure I'm gonna get a thumbs down.  Go ahead.|`|5r9DmOmfaa	OVERRATED. Do not even start with me on Twilight.  I really despise it.|`|zqxP5exvaa	i absolutly love and adore twilight with a firery passion!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Io amo Twilight <br>  ^ i dont know if that's right<br>  <br>  but i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|TQeeb8Ntaa	I really enjoyed reading Twilight, and I am on the second book (New Moon) now. I personally think that they are really good!|`|0WKkXIyKaa	most of the fans are teen girls, <br>  <br>  most people think that it is badly written, sexist, promotes no education and teen pregnancy as well as falling for the first boy you meet.|`|AA11703549	I finally finished the first book so now I can criticize it in confidence. Meyer's is not a strong writer, that's for sure. There were little things in her writing that drove me crazy all the way through. The story is cliche, melodramatic, and "frilly." But she does do a good job at making the main characters interesting enough to keep the reader from getting bored with them. <br>  <br>  I'm still trying to figure out how I got sucked into the plot because in retrospect, it's very stupid and cliche, but for some reason, I fell into it. Perhaps it can be equated to a disney movie. And all girls (young and old) love disney movies no matter how trite, meldramatic, or stupid they may be.|`|4HkctNtZaa	They are really good! And so is your english! A lot of people love Twilight. However some people just try to be annoying and say how terrible it is. But I like them! I'm about to start  reading "The Host" which is by the same author of Twilight. <br>  <br>  Good Job on your English! : )|`|rY5PSbc9aa	I love the twilight series, I'm almost finished Breaking Dawn! By the way- your english is very good. Except in the question title, you said "ok" instead of "of"  I dont know if that was a typing error, but just in case it wasnt...  : )|`|aeODdMATaa	I love the books. Your English is perfect. =)|`|sNr9Od89aa	yes your english is correct! i think the twilight books are okay, but not THAT good. they don't deserve that much attention.|`|aiYPHUEWaa	People's opinions of Twilight depends which of the following groups you fit into here (and there, too, I'm sure)<br>  <br>  Adolescent teenage girls desperate for romance and handsome, sensitive, thoughtful, dark, bloodsuckers..............OPINION:  We love <br>                                                                        Twilight!

You're English is good, but you forget words like "an" and "the"<br>  <br>  è un piacere conoscerti!|`|PzaJO1Ekaa	it is crap.|`|yuHV59Yhaa	Your grammar is a little off. I read all of them and they were CHEESY. But I'm one of the few people who thinks that.<br>  <br>  Your sentence should have been ~ Hi, I'm an Italian girl. I love the Twilight saga and I would like to know what the American (Or English if you're talking about people from England) people think of the Twilight saga.|`|W6uHaI1kaa	Yes your english is great :)<br>  <br>   I LOVE the twilight saga! And all my friends. Its soo nice :)|`|4XYjZNWeaa	you'll get A LOT of mixed opinions on here hun x<br>  <br>  Personally i think they are good and bad. I love the plots but i hate how it repeats throughout the book. for example , bella gets hurt in every book, edward dissapears at some point in all of them.<br>  <br>  But yeah i like them :)<br>  x|`|6HOcthxaaa	its amazing !!!! the best saga everr. all american teens love it....well most of us..haha;|`|4FqP313qaa	i really, really like it!!<br>  its pretty controversial over here, though. some people hate it, some love it.|`|2QiLmXfhaa	yep its correct. :o)<br>  <br>  I LOVE the Twilight Saga so much! :P I've read each book about 4 times each! :o)|`|JL4z0Hm4aa	I love the series sooo much. But I know a lot of people who hate it.<br>  <br>  And your English is pretty good,|`|59vpcHuhaa	I give it a 2 out of 5. It's something you would read if you have nothing else to do. It's an easy read and you can follow the plot really easily which I guess is why it's entertaining, but it's not such a big deal like everyone else makes it out to be. I guess it depends on what you like. I, personally, disliked it because it was too simple, too underdeveloped, too poorly written, and too poorly structured. The characters were so cliche and the story was so predictable. Okay, she's pretty and he's gorgeous. She's in danger and he saves her. We get it. It wasn't anything amazing...<br>  <br>  And your English is good. You're just missing a few articles such as "the" before Twilight saga and "an" before Italian.|`|mQqc4Bg7aa	YUK WAY OVERRATED!|`|FQq7imWbaa	its amazing!!! love it , your english is almost correct|`|ir5w4rswaa	overrated|`|FPsR2xi7aa	One of the worst things written since Eragon, and that's saying quite a bit.<br>  <br>  And you're English is fine.  Not perfect, but plenty understandable.<br>  <br>  Frankly your English is as good as, if not better than, most of the people on Answers.|`|0816304797066153784f125d3c7f1337aa	in America the twilight saga is huge and very popular, i dont really like it that much but everyone i talk to really likes the books in the series.|`|wfLJAjkTaa	its a bit boring|`|ngHD8K8eaa	Ciao.  i'm in love with the twilight series. I think it is amazing! i love all the books, the characters, story line everything about it. Its a great saga. <br>  your english is great.|`|TOAiSbPYaa	I love the Twilight Saga and will always love it probably it is a realy awsome Saga<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ** Esme Cullen **|`|KtS7SUDWaa	Your english is fine. But it should be: What do you think of the Twilight saga? anyways i think the books are boring, have no plot and is full of crap.|`|lJhB4GSnaa	I thought it was good (not fantastic, but good), but the main characters were annoying and unrealistic. The plot was interesting though.|`|x08oohwpaa	12 year old girls who have never read anything else love it.  People who have read anything else know that it's crap.|`|ValLVBcYaa	Meh.<br>  It's way overrated.|`|e3K1IzKsaa	boring and overrated.|`|52pZj3WFaa	I like it...tis a good ol' yarn.<br>  <br>  Read better, but also read worse.

AA11537762	Make sure you have a time frame to it. First you say pulls, then you say pulled. Know what I mean?<br>  <br>  Aside from that, you are a very good writer. It was a little hard to get into at first, but that's normal for the beginning of stories. What is this going to be about?|`|JjuZvvfeaa	it's okay but i only read the 1st paragraph it didnt really grab my attention.|`|8HPdqHTSaa	You need to start the story with an attention grabber, not just a bunch of dialouge greetings and such. It seems to be going no where. Try editing and it may tien out better.|`|A6ylS5bJaa	Hmmm- your description is fair- better than most of the stuff I run into on this site- however, the story doesn't seem to be going anywhere.

I would definitely want to read that. :)<br>  <br>  I write books to by the way. :) I love writing, but anyways really that sounds really good.|`|Kr2TIUsAaa	I don't get why the girl was quickly sent to foster home. Social services don't work like that. <br>  <br>  First, the child will be processed, counselled and talked to. <br>  <br>  Then, the mother or father will be couselled and talked to and asked where the child can go to. <br>  <br>  A cousin, sister, brother or something related to the father or the mother taking care of her would seem more realistic than her being sent to foster care.|`|Jy69Dn9Maa	Yes very original exsept when they meet in  the school, and the whole mysterious boy has a secret thing sounds Twilight, but if you made them meet domewhere else would turn it around to a very unique story, I like the plot line, especially that you added some murder and mystery into it. Good luck!|`|6SCwpakRaa	cool tell me when your done|`|NFvZDiNSaa	i don't get this story?! i get everything up to the Landon has a secret to uphold!? it needs a bit of work but i can see a future writer emerging here! :D xxx|`|F3Q9V933aa	Well i personally like it and would read such story, but i have a few concerns. Heather is a high school girl who meets Landon Heath at high school meaning that he is probably of 18 years old, Right? If yes, than 18 years, is an age that is not sufficient enough to be this sort of secret agent guardian thing you want him to be, therefore it kind of brings down half of your plot. Other than that i like it. <br>  <br>  Well bye and good luck with it!!!!!|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Yes except for the lack of authenticity of Los Angeles.  There's no eastside per se unless you're counting the 100% Hispanic East L.A., which I doubt your protagonists are from.<br>  <br>  Also beware, the names are overwrought and trite.  Drop those Landon names and St. James for sure!  You don't want it to sound like a dime store bodice-ripper!|`|BLMh0dG6aa	Sound's more like an intrigue, mystery, crimestory, noir, or thriller to me.<br>  <br>  But potentally a good one

I wrote this reviewe, below.<br>  <br>  Reviewer: BOOK READER - [5.0 out of 5 stars] - February 19, 2009<br>  Subject: WHAT A REFRESHING CHANGE<br>  I believe in giving credit where it is due. What I do not understand is why this book is not in print.<br>  <br>  Many of the previous reviewers have given this author the 'rightly' deserved accreditation for this lovely tale.<br>  <br>  What did 'I' think of this book?<br>  As my title review states, this was a very refreshing change from the humdrum historical novels one finds on the shelves of book stores. Indeed, the characters were wonderfully human and the protagonists were written with a style that anyone could easily relate to. Within the story, explanations abound, so that one can never be confused as to what is gong on within the subplots, and there are many.<br>  <br>  I enjoyed, particularly, the two French brothers, Alan and Philippe. They both had a boyish naivety that reminded my of my husband when he was a young, newly married man. King Harold was an immensely strong character with an obvious love for his country, yet with an undercurrent of guile that made this personage so believable.<br>  <br>  I was also impressed by the way the author made a genuine attempt to portray the personality of the Norman, Duke William. This was a fine piece of characterization and must have taken a great deal of thought to get the duke into perspective for his role in the story.<br>  <br>  The women portrayed were, I thought, less than strong as they could have been, but, nonetheless, the writer made great strides in molding their personalities to fit the moment. I sensed this man has a great deal of understanding of the female psyche, and I congratulate him for his achievement in being honest in his view of the women in this story.<br>  <br>  As for the events that Mr Bradbury has written of, they were extremely well researched. The true events flowed, mixed and blended very well with the fictitious happenings within the story<br>  <br>  In conclusion: Every chapter is full of drama and excitement and is a page turner. Mr Bradbury has a personal and exciting writing style. The book is so well written that I cannot see why this was placed, free to all, on Internet Archive. This book is so worthy of publication and should be given the due accreditation it deserves. I wish to thank My Bradbury for giving me a wonderful experience in literature.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have given, in this review, my honest opinion, and I award the author a five star rating.<br>  <br>  Jillian Norton|`|5wg7tKc6aa	What do you mean "out there."  Do you mean "in your head."  If you're actually wanting to write a story that's based off an idea "out there," then you're pretty much screwed.<br>  <br>  Don't write just because you liked the Twilight series.  It isn't becoming of you.

JOuomnisaa	Let me make it clear that NONE of the following represents my own beliefs.  I am only submitting this answer to help you PRETEND that you are pro-slavery.<br>  <br>  I believe that a slave owner would justify his ownership of other human beings by saying:<br>  <br>  1.  These are poor, ignorant creatures who are less that human.  I am helping them by providing them with a place to live, food to eat and taking care of them when they are sick or old.  (Note:  this was not always done, or done well, by all slaveholders.)<br>  <br>  2.  These slaves do work that no self-respecting man or woman would want to do.  It would be demeaning to my neigbors or friends to expect them to do the work that these near-animals do.<br>  <br>  3.  The economic benefits are tremendous.  If we had to pay people to mind our animals, farm our fields, pick our cotton, etc., we would be unable to continue our operations, or we would have to raise the cost of these goods to exorbitant levels.  The whole nation benefits from the monetary savings inherent in slavery.<br>  <br>  Again--these are NOT my personal feelings!  It is only supposed to represent what a slaveholder might say.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I just realized that I might not have fully answered the last part of your question "What good things came out of it?"<br>  <br>  Whether or not a result was good depends on which side you are one.  For example, slaveholders who made fortunes through slavery might consider that a good result.  (Note that many, if not most, slaveholders in the South lost their fortunes/plantations, etc. after the Civil War.)  As for the slaves themselves and the non-slaveholding populace, the only current-day good I can imagine is that the population of the United States is now a whole lot more diverse than it might have been otherwise.|`|AA11460234	It was NOT the 'main cause' of the Civil War as someone here said. That's nonsense. Lincoln was not anti-slavery. He was against it's spread. He even suggested that if he could he'd ship all the slaves back to Africa to start their own nation.<br>  The main cause of the war was state's rights and the seperation from the Union. Slavery wa sused as a campaign platform to garner the abolisionist vote in the second term.<br>  <br>  However as (and again...people fail to read the question) this is a schoo, project and you're supposed to be pro-slavery.<br>  <br>  So...the average southern didn't own slaves. Slaves were a very expensive commodity. In addition although living conditions were lousy and slaves were beaten this wasn't always commonplace. Slaves were looked upon no differently than any livestock you owned like cattle, sheep or work horses. They were purchased to do work. Most slave owners didn't physically abuse their slaves to the point of crippling them or killing them because you've just killed or crippled your tool that you paid good money for to work.<br>  <br>  So...you say slavery was good money wise? It took some time before the money you spent on the slave was recognized in profit. They had to be fed and clothed and housed. What really made slavery big business was the invention of the cotton gin..or 'engine'. It would take a slave hours to pick the seed from a pound of lint. The cotton gin could do a couple of hundred pounds in a matter of hours. So the more slaves you had the quicker you could harvest your cotton before it rotten on the bush and transport it for sale.<br>  <br>  Slavery's pro's was quicker and more efficent crop harvesting.<br>  <br>  Additional hands to maintain upkeep on the plantation. I mean, are you going to be able to pick the peaches in an entire peach orchard on time?<br>  <br>  Slaves could be sold. Another plus. In other words usually you could recoupe some of the money you spend originally by selling the slave later in life.<br>  <br>  So it was not necessarily 'cheap' labor....but he or she was yours to own and do with as you see fit.|`|7oNpIf4Naa	.The House of Representative's vote to apologize for the horror of slavery was an easy call. Several states have done their mea culpas on slavery. The resolutions the states and Congress passed were mild, innocuous, and ultimately toothless. In truth that's all they were supposed to be. But the House resolution was still important. It was tacit acknowledgement of something that the slavery apology opponents vehemently deny and that is that slavery was not just the evil doings of greedy Southern planters.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The U.S. government encoded slavery in the Constitution and protected and nourished it for a century. Traders, insurance companies, bankers, shippers, and landowners made billions off of it. Their ill-gotten profits fueled America's industrial and agricultural might. For decades after slavery's end, white trade unions excluded blacks and confined them to the dirtiest, poorest paying jobs.<br>  <br>  While it's true that many whites and non-white immigrants came to America after the Civil War they were not subjected to the decades of relentless racial terror and legal segregation, as were blacks. Through the decades of slavery and Jim Crow segregation, African-Americans were transformed into the poster group for racial deviancy. The image of blacks as lazy, crime- and violence-prone, irresponsible, and sexual predators has stoked white fears and hostility and served as the standard rationale for more than 4,000 documented lynchings between 1890 and 1945, as well as the countless racial assaults and acts of hate crime violence.<br>  <br>  Though some blacks earn more and live better than ever today, and have gotten boosts from welfare, social and education programs, civil rights legislation, and affirmative action programs, that does not mean that America has shaken the hideous legacy of slavery. The National Urban League in its annual State of Black America reports yearly continually finds that young blacks are far likelier than whites to be imprisoned, serve longer terms, and are more likely to receive the death penalty even when their crimes are similar.<br>  <br>  Blacks continue to have the highest rates of poverty, infant mortality, violence victimization rates, and health care disparities than any other group in America. They are still more likely to live in segregated neighborhoods and be refused business and home loans. Their children are more likely to attend failed public schools than any other group, and more likely to be racially profiled on America's urban streets.<br>  Also, there is nothing new about state and federal governments issuing apologies and payments for past wrongs committed against African-Americans. The U.S. government admitted it was legally liable in 1997 to pay the black survivors and family members of the two-decade long syphilis experiment begun in the 1930's by the U.S. Public Health Service that turned black patients into human guinea pigs. The survivors got $10 million from the government and an apology from President Clinton. They were the victims of a blatant medical atrocity conducted with the full knowledge and approval of the U.S. government.<br>  <br>  The state legislature in Florida in 1994 agreed to make payments to the survivors and relatives of those who lost their lives and property when a white mob destroyed the all-black town of Rosewood in 1923. This was a specific act of mob carnage that was tacitly condoned by some public officials and law enforcement officers. Florida was liable for the violence and was duty bound to apologize and pay. The Oklahoma state legislature has agreed at least in principle that reparations and apology should be made to the survivors of the dozens of blacks killed, and the hundreds more that had their homes and businesses destroyed by white mobs with the complicity of law enforcement in the Tulsa massacre of 1921. There's even a bill by Michigan Congressman John Conyers that has been kicked around Congress since 1989 to establish a commission to study the impact of slavery and the feasibility of paying reparations to blacks.<br>  <br>  The Conyer's bill will likely continue to be stillborn in Congress. Reparations is simply too risky, divisive, and distracting for Congress to seriously consider. Both presidential contenders Barack Obama and John McCain oppose reparations. Obama, however, has spoken vaguely about the need to spend more on education, job and housing programs as the best way to deal with the ills of the black poor. Virginia took a light stab at addressing the needs of the black poor. After it apologized for slavery, it created a scholarship fund for blacks whose schools were closed during the state's massive resistance campaign to integration from the mid 1950s to the mid 1960s.<br>  <br>  The brutal truth is that a mainstay of America's continuing racial divide is its harsh and continuing mistreatment of poor blacks. This can be directly traced to the persistent and pernicious legacy of slavery. The House's symbolic apology was a good thing, but it's just not|`|2ztdaVIoaa	It was not good for the slaves they were treated very unfairly and did about 18 hours of work everyday however some were able to buy there freedom one of them wrote a book about his expierience as a slave.<br>  <br>  For information slavery was abolished in the 1865 in the USA|`|S448HGwaaa	It was the main cause of the civil war, in which over 600,000 Americans died, as well as racial tensions and inequalities that still exist today, so.... did ANYTHING good come of it? I would say not.

yvyewZrWaa	I think the majority of good gothic romances were written in the 19th century. A lot of parallels have been drawn between "Rebecca" and Charlotte Bronte's "Jane Eyre". Stylistically it is very different but there are definite similarities in the plots and major characters. I highly recommend reading it if you haven't yet. Emily and Anne Bronte also wrote gothic romances, although I personally don't think any of their efforts compare with "Jane Eyre".<br>  <br>  Another Victorian gothic I enjoyed was "The Picture of Dorian Gray" by Oscar Wilde. It doesn't have much romance in it, but it is a very captivating read nonetheless.<br>  <br>  Charles Dickens' "Bleak House" has a quasi-gothic tone and plot, although I would call it more of a realist work than a romantic one. "Bleak House" is a mix of all different sorts of genres -- romance, mystery, drama, comedy -- but I would say it definitely leans towards the "darker" side of the scale.<br>  <br>  "Jamaica Inn", also by Daphne du Maurier, is supposed to be part of the same genre but I haven't read it yet so I can't tell you how similar/dissimilar it is to "Rebecca". <br>  <br>  "The Mysteries of Udolpho" by Ann Radcliffe is a fun, classic gothic novel -- but be warned, it is incredibly wordy and rather cheesy (it's good, nonetheless, but I wouldn't call it brilliant).<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, its very hard to find a book as intriguing, eloquent, or engrossing as "Rebecca" - it's in a category of its own, as far as I'm concerned.|`|wObyn5d7aa	I would have to second Jane Eyre as rather the classic gothic romance.  Bleak House, as well, is one of my favorite novels, though I wouldn't quite call it as much of an intense page turner as Rebecca.<br>  <br>  Rebecca was my first du Maurier read and I quickly fell in love with her writing.  I have read almost all of her works at least once and  I would highly recommend reading My Cousin Rachel next- it's another one of her more popular novels.   It tells about a man Philip who had been raised by his cousin Ambrose.  Due to health reasons, Ambrose has to spend some time in Italy where he meets and marries Rachel.  Soon after, Ambrose dies and Rachel moves to England and lives on Philip's inherited estate.  Philip develops feelings for her and tries to ignore the nagging suspicion that there may be more than meets the eye in her character. It has the same suspense/romance element to it that Rebecca has--a very good read.  Jamaica Inn is decent, but one of my least favorite of her works.  The Scapegoat (also by du Maurier) is excellent too, dealing with mistaken identity. A man meets his doppelganger and somewhat unwillingly swaps lives with him and must try and cover up that he's not who his new family thinks he is. I dare say I don't do justice to either description, but I don't want to give too much away.<br>  <br>  Good luck and good reading!

AA10515207	I would highly recommend The Years of Extermination by Saul Friedkander. It's complex & not a fast read but is definitely a definitive work on the subject. He interprets all aspects--social, political, etc. of the plan to exterminate the Jews.<br>  <br>  My Father's Keeper: The Children of the Nazi Leaders--An Intimate History of Damage And Denial by Stephen Lebert. It presents the stories of a segment of the German population you may not consider.<br>  <br>  "The Good Old Days": The Holocaust as Seen by Its Perpetrators and Bystanders, edited by Ernst Klee, Willi Dressen, and Volker Riess. It's a collection of letters, diary entries, & other material from the commandant of Treblinka.<br>  <br>  I also have to add these to give these mention because they give the Jewish viewpoint. All are excellent. The first one is Words To Outlive Us: Eyewitness Accounts from the Warsaw Ghetto, edited by Michael Grynberg.<br>  <br>  After Daybreak: The Liberation of Bergen-Belsen, 1945 by Ben Shephard.

SuLMCvVfaa	This is a really interesting question.  <br>  <br>  I think that The Most Dangerous Game explores serious themes of the value of human life and the morality of trophy hunting.  Zaroff is sinister and cool as Poe's Montressor, coldly letting the death of men slide off his back, including Ivan, with whom he has been living for several years.  I don't think the story's sole purpose is entertainment, and therefore, not escapist.  I also, however, don't think it's realism.  It's fiction, it's adventure, it's narrative.  If anything, I'd consider it gothic.<br>  <br>  I think it's arguable that escapist literature doesn't exist, and that all literature has depth and meaning to be explored and discussed in terms of today's world.

1TPGdaXJaa	I have found some inspiration in books on and classes in meditation and in Buddhism. I recommend Buddhism not necessairly for the religeous aspect, but for the philosophical aspects it entails. <br>  <br>  I recommend meditation because it helps one to learn to escape the "surface-chaos" of day-to-day thoughts that we all get caught up in. These can drive you to the point of madness, such as constantly struggling with and feeling frustration from "what should I go back to school for / get a job in, need to make money, need to do it now". I've definitely been there. <br>  <br>  Meditation helps to not fall victim to the emotions and struggles brought upon by these thoughts, and to realize, accept, and be truly happy with the way things are right NOW. It may also help to understand yourself better and calm your mind, which will in turn allow you to take your time in making a truly satisfying decision with how to proceed with your career and your future.<br>  <br>  As far as Buddhism goes (which tends to go hand in hand with meditation), a book I recently read is called "Becoming Enlightened". Unlike many of the other books that reference and have interviews with the Dalai Lama, this one was written directly by him and translated into English. <br>  <br>  Regarding meditation, I learned through classes and would recommend this approach, although I never tried to learn from a book. There are also several self-help CD's (google "wildmind" for a great site) which I've heard good things about, but trying to find a meditation class in your area may be the best place to start. <br>  <br>  Hope you find this helpful.|`|mF0L5jMNaa	Here's a few:  The Power Of Positive Thinking;  Pulling Your Own Strings; and The Buddha Laughed|`|qBz0ZfzFaa	Hmmm those are hard questions that I don't think you'll find answers to in any self-help book. My favorite self-help book is "How to Win Friends and Influence People," by Dale E. Carnegie. Great tips for having a happy life. <br>  <br>  As for what to do with your life, I am 30 and just barely decided what I want to go to graduate school for. I wish I wouldn't have wasted so much time trying to make up my mind...just pick something you enjoy and are good at, and go for it. It really isn't as important of a decision as it seems. It is better to go for something than to waste time agonizing over a decision.|`|d7bJIgqlaa	Have you tried the Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren?

KADDz1EPaa	The Battle of Verdun is considered the greatest and lengthiest in world history. Never before or since has there been such a lengthy battle, involving so many men, situated on such a tiny piece of land. The battle, which lasted from 21 February 1916 until 19 December 1916 caused over an estimated 700,000 casualties (dead, wounded and missing). The battlefield was not even a square ten kilometres. From a strategic point of view there can be no justification for these atrocious losses. The battle degenerated into a matter of prestige of two nations literally for the sake of fighting...... <br>  <br>  by el fustigador
Xkas9BG2aa	I just read The Lucky One which was an okay book, and as far as I know that was his last book.  Some authors write constantly and produce a book or two every year like Danielle Steel.  While others are less prolific.  I think Nicholas Sparks is the latter.  Not sure if he's just busy with other projects or has a case of writer's block and just not coming up with ideas that translate to the paper.

The idea to share.  This was socialism that there is a classless society and that the government should take control of businesses so that the working class could not be exploited by factory workers. REMEMBER this is during the Industrial revolution. Basically, that the working class should control the production of goods and benefit from this and in which wealth and power will be equally shared. That they should get rid of the capitalist system.(Example: Farms and businesses would belong to all, instead of individuals[factory owners = which lead to poor conditons in factories, low payment and health conditions)  <br>  <br>  Vladimir Lenin read the "Communist Manifesto" and also liked this idea of a classless society where the govn't controls businesses. He led the Bolsheviks with Leon Trotsky to overthrow the czar. They promised the people "Bread, Peace and Land" this might not sound like a lot but the majority of the people were the lower class. He promised land reform, end Russia's involvement in the war and an end to food shortages. Lenin took power in 1917 and distributed land to peasants and gave workers control of factories and mines. However, to maintain control he had secret police among the people. Lenin's communist party led its will through the military and secret police.|`|vw4KXRlLaa	Marxism should NOT be confused with Communism, which uses a Marxist foundation, but is not the same as Marxism.  If someone tells you Marxism=Communism, they are wrong, do not listen to them.<br>  <br>  The PROBLEM is that too many people ARE uneducated as to what Marixsm actually is, and therefore automatically assume it and Communism are one in the same, which they are not.  Marxism, like most other political theories, is complicated.<br>  <br>  It, very basically, was the idea that class struggle was the primary motor of social change, and the class tensions caused political unrest, and so Marxism attempted to mediate these factors in order to create a harmonius society.  <br>  <br>  You'd get a more full understanding even by reading the Wikipedia page on Marxism:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist#Classical_Marxism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist#Cla...</a><br>  <br>  Which I suggest you do, and then you'll be already far more educated on Marxism than someone who will tell you it's the same as Communism.|`|kzllc2eCaa	In lamens terms<br>  Marxism is another word for far left wing politics - communism.

hWeYftoraa	There are many things you could do. <br>  <br>  First person: <br>  Pros: It seems more like a journal, which children respond to. It also gives them a bond with the character.<br>  <br>  Cons: If the character doesn't notice something, neither do the readers.<br>  <br>  Second person: Don't use. Plain and simple<br>  <br>  Third person limited: You can notice things about one character and where that one character is, but cannot go focus on another and leave yours behind.<br>  <br>  Third person omniscient: You can go anywhere and focus on any character. <br>  <br>  <br>  RECOMMENDATION? Third person limited gives the readers the bond with the character and the writer the ability to notice things and know things the character would not. Best choice.|`|PkXJRfaBaa	I think third person is best, but that's because I don't like to see through the character's eyes and I also find first person writing a bit cheesy.|`|0xekiwHQaa	There's three point of views -<br>  <br>  First person - "I" "me" "we" "us"<br>  Second person (which isn't commonly used) - "you"<br>  Third person - "they" "him" "she"<br>  <br>  There are two third person perspectives: third person omniscient (the "all-knowing" narrator) and third person limited. The Harry Potter books are written in third person limited.  There really is no better point of view. Each has it's pros and cons. You just have to pick the one that works best for your story.<br>  <br>  Third person limited is the most common.

W8F9PboZaa	I would recommend<br>  The Book Thief - Markus Zusak<br>  From the point of view of death in WWII Germany. He follows a girl as she is fostered by an anti-nazi family and as her world falls apart around her.<br>  <br>  Kite Runner - Khalad Hosseini<br>  About two best friends, one fortunate and rich, the other his servant, growing up in 1970's Afghanistan and follows the fortunate boys story through life. It's shocking and beautiful and I loved it. <br>  <br>  The Time Travelers Wife – Audrey Niffeneger <br>  An unconventional love story that centers on a man with a strange genetic disorder which causes him to unpredictably time travel, and his wife, an artist, who has to cope with his frequent absences and dangerous experiences. I’m generally not much into romance and I loved this.<br>  <br>  The Tomorrow Series - John Marsden (young adult fiction but they're amazing)<br>  A group of teenage that are camping in the Australian bush when Australia is invaded by enemy soldiers. It involves every genre pretty much, adventure, drama, romance, friendship. I have read the series too many times <br>  <br>  Angela's Ashes - Frank McCourt<br>  McCourt's autobiography of his growing up and living in poverty in first New York and then Ireland with an alcoholic father, depressed mother and many many siblings. I cried so hard in this book. <br>  <br>  My Sisters Keeper - Jodie Picoult<br>  One girl had cancer and her parents genetically engineered a genetic match for her. Once the "test tube baby" grows to a teenager she requests medical emancipation so she doesn't have to donate her kidney to her sister. It follows not only her but the entire family as they try and deal with the crisis. I was reluctant to read this, thinking it would be chick lit. But it was beautiful and sad and I loved it <br>  <br>  To Kill A Mockingbird - Harper Lee<br>  Ultimate classic of a girl whose white father, an apparently lone non-racist, defends a black man obviously wrongly accused of murder<br>  <br>  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - Ken Kesey<br>  Another classic. A psychiatric institution that is turned on its head by McMurphy, a man obviously not insane. The manipulative warden Nurse Ratched dictates the ward with shocking consequences.<br>  <br>  Tuesdays With Morrie - Mitch Albom<br>  The true story of Mitch Albom's old professor who is dying and every tuesday, gives Albom a lesson of life. <br>  <br>  The Poisonwood Bible - Barbara Kingslover<br>  A Reverand, his wife and four daughters move to the Congo to try and convert the locals to christianity. The point of view of all the daughters allows us to see how they grow and mature and learn that their father is not all controlling.<br>  <br>  The Obernewtyn Chronicles - Isobelle Carmody<br>  A post-apocalyptic world ruled by a dictatorship of a government. Some people begin to show signs of advanced mental abilities (read others minds, have visions of the future etc) and are burned or taken to "farms" which inevitably mean death. One of these "misfits" is caught and we follows her awesome journey<br>  <br>  Life of Pi – Yann Martel<br>  In this story, the protagonist Piscine "Pi" Patel, an Indian boy, is shipwrecked and stuck on a small boat with a tiger, hyena, orangutan and zebra. It’s a riveting story of how he survives for over 200 days.|`|uth8Ztbdaa	Romance:<br>  <br>  Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen<br>  Girl With A Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier<br>  <br>  Fiction:<br>  <br>  The Book Thief by Markus Zusak<br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold|`|8dacj8Nyaa	one word....

7ASVjAOeaa	The opening image of the work sets the foreboding tone that prevails throughout as the reader is introduced to Winston Smith, the fatalistic protagonist of the novel, on a “cold day in April,” when “the clocks were striking thirteen.” Immediately, the author depicts a society in decay by describing a setting of “gritty dust,” “hallways [smelling] of boiled cabbage and old rag mats,” elevators (the lift) not working, and electrical current that is turned off during daylight hours.<br>  So there you go, the best tone to describe the opening of the book would be foreboding.

Prices are all over the map, and they don't necessarily reflect quality or skill level of the photographer or items delivered after the wedding. About all you can do is visit various photographers, view their work, see what they offer, and judge if the price is a good match for what you get and for your budget. I will say though, that you should expect to pay AT LEAST $1000 for an experienced photographer who is going to provide you with a half way decent album.

Nothing can take precedence over the work of your status sphere--this world or the next. Very important is the work of preparation for the next higher sphere, but nothing equals the importance of the work of the world in which you are actually living. But though the work is important, the self is not. When you feel important, you lose energy to the wear and tear of ego dignity so that there is little energy left to do the work. Self-importance, not work-importance, exhausts immature creatures; it is the self element that exhausts, not the effort to achieve. You can do important work if you do not become self-important; you can do several things as easily as one if you leave yourself out. Variety is restful; monotony is what wears and exhausts. Day after day is alike--just life or the alternative of death.

qpmGLd7laa	Depending on your age and general reputation, there may not be much you can do to convince anyone who could help you to actually do so.  If you're a good student, and known for it, however, you might want to try to approach your principal with the situation.  Respectfully explain, and expect your teacher to get really pissed off about this.  If she continues unfairly ridiculing you for doing her job poorly, suggest that she give you her paycheck as an incentive to do it well.<br>  <br>  Am I being serious?  I'm telling you what I would do.  I don't put up with bull **** from anyone, and no one can hold anything over me because I always do what needs to be done.<br>  <br>  If you're a little more timid, or just don't care to have a war with your teacher, just stop short at telling your principal.  If he or she doesn't want to help, just apologize to your teacher (even though you've done nothing wrong).  And afterward, be so nice and diligent that it will make her sick.|`|A01w1dHqaa	Whatever you do to another, in this case, judge her to be lazy, always returns to you.<br>  <br>  Be wise as serpents and harmless as doves and your world will be wonderful.|`|AA11484395	Short version. You are right, the counselor and teacher are wrong. <br>  Teachers are supposed to grade their own papers. If they are not up to grading the assignments given, perhaps they should hand out fewer assignments. Additionally, teachers who order their students to grade others papers, are supposed to check those papers again for errors, and make corrections to the grades if necessary. Following that mental string, if the teacher is going to have to check the papers anyway, why not just grade them? Counselors are supposed to be certified in guidance. They should not inherit the job just because they taught for several years at the same school. <br>  You will not change this, it is over. Though it is difficult, you must make yourself strong inside. Go to school. Do the work, do the time. get the grades, and get the heck out. College is different, so much so, but to get there, you have to survive high school. Hang in there.|`|FyHJIVC3aa	Inside a school teachers are cohorts and will never turn on one another. I had a similar instance in High School where my English teacher openly professed being sexist. When I took it to the counselor she waved me off, so I told her I was going straight to the principle and even the Superintendent if she was going to be the way she was. Eventually I got enough of the students to come with me to the principle that he took us seriously and decided this teacher wasn't worth the hassle.<br>  <br>  Bottom-line, teachers, much like police officers and other groups in power, know that they have the power in the schools and they do a very good job of wrongfully using it.|`|OflbswHKaa	I had a problem like that in HS. I had a problem with a teacher, I went to the principal, and she turned on me, so I had to have my parents come to my defense. But it doesn't sound like you have that option.<br>  <br>  You have two options, if you want to stay within the school. Talk to another guidance counselor. That kind of behavior from your guidance counselor is out of the ordinary, they are usually there for the students. Or talk to the principle, he/she may be able to help. Just explain in a calm voice, and don't change your story.<br>  <br>  You need to tell them about your parents, how they abuse you. I know it will change everything, but you will grow up resenting them, and you may do the same to your kids, if you don't do something about it now.|`|doVbqo3iaa	talk to a different counselor or administrator. You could talk to other family members besides your parents. If you feel like you are being treated unfairly, the school should recognize that and deal with it accordingly.
