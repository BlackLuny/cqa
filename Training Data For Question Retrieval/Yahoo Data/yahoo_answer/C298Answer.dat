Also, one of my friends (she has a rather large 'cup' size) caught him looking down her shirt while he was checking her paper!!! Sick, sick, sick. Also, whenever a girl who has big breasts (I'm safe, thank god) is in the car with him to take the driving test, he'll make them look behind them fully, so that their chest is practically in his face!<br>  I hate him, he's so sick!

He watched porn in class. Eww! He was my tech teacher for younger levels (like 3rd- 5th) and I remember he was soo weird!!! Once my brother told me that a kid in his grade cought him looking at it! So obviously i believed him! Then i had to pretty friends and he loved taking pictures of them! At recess in 6th grade i remember that he was like stop by my office so i can take pics of you for the yearbook! Scary!!! Then last year (7th grade) he got caught by the prinicipal looking at porn on his computer so they like fired him. Yep. Then my gym teacher is lesbian. The other gym teacher has a reputation for looking at little children. Oh, and my math teacher is nice but she makes weird (but funny) jokes. Like once somebody was like its hot in here and she goes because your in here. lol it was funny but weirdish. and once she was like i bet the girls team will win (for this 8th grade thing) and another dude goes your sexist and everryone was like OHH! and this kid goes Ms. _____ did you here that? And she was like Ya! He called my sexy! And everyone was on the floor going NO! EWW! it was funny.

My eighth grade P.E. teacher raped 3 girls and was caught peeping on one of our students 6 years ago.|`|Ea1odg8Uaa	oooooooh lordy~ yes, it was in intermediate in Cali (7th-8th) He was our vice principal. He would always where black glasses so people wouldn't know what hes exactly looking at >.> One day i went to his office and i just had  to have a low shirt on that day, the lighting made it so obvious to see his eyes, he called me in to talk about how our school needs to change. It was totally useless by the way, and i kept on catching his eyes ball around to my bust area. In 5 months he got caught masturbating in his office by the principal. NOW im in highschool in hawaii and there are all these hawaiian/ samoan security men who really aren't doing there job. They also wear pitch black glasses, but almost everyone in school complains about them, because you can tell when they're staring at our asses. Also, one has a razr phone and he's always taking pictures of girls. not too fun :(|`|l7jA12m3aa	lol no. but on my favorite show the teacher is only 10 years old and the students are like maybe 13 or 14 and the students would be kinda perverted towerds him. i remember in this one episode some chic said "negi sensei is a pervert.. omase-chan!" (another way to say pervert) and they were going after him. its perverted in some parts to.|`|3f84c73de2c0e31943a5c269dafcd272aa	Yes one time I was like at class and everything was normal we were doing a project and we were using glue and this dude I sit next to was like messing with the glue and everything and I went to go get a paper but I saw the dude get the glue and put it in my seat and the teacher was like clean it up even though he knew it wasn't me and I told him and everything so I bascically had to or else and I was and my teacher wached my azz while I cleaned it. Then I fished and there was nothing and he was like hey there come over here and pick up you trash which he put on my chair...|`|RzaP9bQmaa	This question made me think back when I was secondary school, we never had a perverted teacher. <br>  There was this teacher who joined our school and I believe it was his first teaching job, a very stunning teacher and young to.  <br>  He got so scared and worried with all the girls fancying him that in the end he transferred to another school.|`|Iawaijw9aa	Yes. It was a tech class so if we asked for help he would come around the back of us and lean down to look in our shirts before typing what we asked for, he would also get hard while walking past girls with low cut shirts on. Also, he noticed when my friend repainted her nails and he put his hand over hers and said in a creepy tone "You have very lovely hands"|`|tD0nI64xaa	OMG yes!!<br>  My french teacher!<br>  he willl always check girls out and lean down and look down your shirt!!! he would always stop you and ask you how was your day with this big perverted smile. and give you "little gifts" like chocolate and stuff. gross!!!! he didnt teach well either. i would get D's and C's in his class. So eventually all of our class(es) complained and got rid of him. we got him fired. :D<br>  now we have a new french teacher, and i'm getting a's and b's in her class. :D|`|T1vgsbyKaa	Yes omg! ok so we have this teacher that has a criminal record. (rumor is that he sexually harassed a teacher) he always makes pervy comments, looks at girls chests, calls after school 'tonight' (such as 'y don't u stay after tonite?"), offers rides home from after school and to walkers, and he touches students. (one time to my friend he hugged her, and its against her religion! One time I think he even kissed a student.) He is my algebra teacher and he said the reason he decided to teach middle school instead of high school is because we are more 'willing'. ewww...ok can anyone top that?|`|BOUlr1OMaa	Yeah eighth grade MATH. Oh God that was horrible! He was this old white dude with zits on his eyes. Hahaa I remember everyone was convinced that he had genital warts on his eyes. They were disgusting. Whenever he talked to me he would rub my arm. He looked down all the girls shirts I remember. That much I know isn't a rumor, I took to wearing sweatshirts and sweaters whenever I was in his class after about the first week. He had the weirdest eyes... normal eyes have little lines in the irises, but his were solid bright blue. Worst teacher I ever had.|`|0r3yQdIPaa	Yup...My teacher would only answer your questions, or pay any attention to you at all unless you were pretty. The way you got more attention was wearing short skirts and low cut shirts...he would literally look down your shirts and you would happen to be told all the answers to the test...really creepy.<br>  <br>  Oh! and my middle school gym teacher! She was a lesbian teaching middle school girls PE! She would watch us run and then watch us from her office as we changed...she always got mad when we changed in the bathroom stale.|`|28I4Y42paa	yes,<br>  My English teacher is always making tests about the human body and touching and stuff.

He's always making jokes based on dating and sex and stuff!<br>  Ugh i hope he falls down a well (;|`|HnbJhpnbaa	Yes!<br>  Sketchy old gym teacher. Hes like around 55 and is so sketch. He wears skin tight clothes. And will just make the girls run around the gym while the boys just sit. And once my friend was bending over, he walked by and he said thats a ten. HES SO CREEP|`|MzEIoozyaa	OMG  yes!! The first time my teacher was like great job, and patted my back and kept getting lower and lower and lower! The other time, I was talking to my guy friend... and we were talking about him peeing in a water bottle.. gross I know, but then my teacher overheard and was like.. I never did that... I'd probably break it. EW!|`|uwZ9AL38aa	Yes. His name was Mr.Jessie. He would look in the wrong places and touch you. He would come and put his hand on your back and look down your shirt. One time me and my friend were waiting in line for the money booth and he came between us and touched our backs and said in a creapy voice as he looked down our shirt, My turn giiirrrrrlllllsssss!Creapy!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Up3QePBKaa	Yes, he reached down this girls shirt to supposedly get her necklace and said to her, i really like your necklace and like your story he winked...Not a long story but ya.|`|Cx18aKapaa	Yea<br>  <br>  the Man-Teacher<br>  i had in Middle school would always "creep" up to the girls in my class<br>  and would somewhat grope them while pretending to "help" them with math..<br>  <br>  yea ....|`|35AfY6gTaa	yep.  there was a technology teacher at my middle school who looked down mine and my friend's shirt.  it was creepy.|`|VNmENgpVaa	were you ever thinking PERVERTED as a student towards a teacher?|`|Ls93X4ufaa	In 5th grade my male teacher would sit and look at Frederick's of Hollywood catalogs.

RvddYKqjaa	Where did you get that information? I had just read that the divorce rate was rising because couples were so stressed out about finances. I hope you're right. <br>  Yes, it is indeed cheaper to keep her. Sad but true. <br>  It's also true that many couples are not getting married at all, thus less divorce should be happening in the future.|`|USn04b4Paa	probably there thinking about the housing market and since they would have to sell the house what until houses go back up to get a divorce so i guess for the time wiser to keep her|`|GvRpfA4Caa	Darn skippy! Compromise and sacrifice!|`|neMWWu0Aaa	yeah buddy|`|ihxO8qApaa	i guess so, but studies also show less and less people get married everyday, so no marriage no divorce|`|3sSYxWN0aa	I also doubt anyone would want the added stress of a divorce on top of the economic struggling.|`|IWzYB44raa	Hahahaha  :)|`|2Ltc1dAwaa	most definately!|`|X2Y5D8ycaa	It's cheaper to just not get married...

AA10297143	I fully agree.  With a few exceptions, men are physically stronger but can easily be taken down by a woman.  This is actually a no brainer.|`|6pUzzsuhaa	height does NOT matter<br>  <br>  are you talking about mentally or physically? each man and each woman is different- i've arm wrassled a guy before and i beat him every time i did<br>  in some ways, i am stronger than most men (i'm 5'1 and i'm stronger than some 6' and taller men)<br>  and in some ways, men are stronger than me|`|VALxlwYSaa	Height doesn't really matter... <br>  <br>  it really depends on how strong you are. <br>  I'm pretty strong and all  but there are a lot of guys who are bigger and stronger then me.

She's not so strong that she looks like a monster but she can take pretty much any guy/girl that you throw at her xD <br>  <br>  So like I said it depends on how strong you are.|`|nooi0ldjaa	i've been 'beat up' by a few women. a real man is weak against a lady because a real man would never lay hands on one.<br>  <br>  but, there's ladies out there that can out lift some men.<br>  and some men that can out lift a lady. just depends.|`|WKcJE9bKaa	The average woman could not beat up a man even of the same height, unless she had skills in martial arts, or he was scrawny.|`|7ADHptSaaa	WOMEN CAN DO WHAT MEN CAN DO BETTER!|`|fDipxBSnaa	Well my gf's sis is taller and heavier than me.

If the teacher assigned the homework then she would probably assign class time to do it. If she assigned class time then there would be whispering. If there was whispering then the whole class would be talking in ten minutes. If the whole class was talking then she would have to tell them to be quite. If that didn't work she would have to assign more homework. and if that didn't work then she would have to start sending people to the office. If they were sent to the office then rthey wouldm get a detention. If they got a detention then they would have to serve it (now lets get back to the topic at hand.  I don't wanna get to detailed in this...... I'll get back to it later.)<br>  <br>  So anyway while those people are out  at the office the room is quite..... Quieter still....... Then the students come back. It is loud again. But the teacher doesn't care. The class is almost over anyway. Then the bell rings. If the bell rings then that means its time for a different class. You have to go to your locker and get new books then. And if you get new books you'll see your friends there and want to stop and talk to them. You'll talk with them so much you'll lose track of time and be late for your next class. So you'll arrive tarty. If it was your first one no one would mind...... <br>  <br>  (i'm just ganna say it is your first one...)<br>  If you arrived tarty then you'd have trouble finding the page your on. And if you don't know what page your on then you'd have to ask the person next to you if you ask the person next to you then you'd probably get into a conversation with him.And if you got into a conversation with him then you'd be disturbing class. Sense you got in a conversation with him that would mean your interrupting class. The teacher would act really upset. Then he'll send YOU  to the office to get a detention. <br>  <br>  Then snow white time. Blinking. The day goes by very fast. The clock ticking...... <br>  <br>  Sense you got an after school detention you'd have to call your mom. If you called your mom you'd have to explain that you'd gotten an after school detention. She would act very upset. But she would pick you up. And sense its already the end of the day you'd have to serve it then. It was quite than. Quieter than it had been the whole day. Almost as if the whole room was dressed in Silence--If silence were a dress. Then it was dressed in white. White silence... Like death. The kids who had gotton detention in your first class are there but you barely notice them. <br>  <br>  (okay this story is moving much to slow for me. Mind if i speed it up? I am only asking that just to be polight i am if you ain't says no or yes says no....)<br>  <br>  <br>  * * ***** THEESE ST*ArS R*eeepp*R*EsE*nT A CeNNS*ORed (but can be) UNcE*NsoRED (this is just a really boring part.) *P*aRT OF DEtentIO*N IN WH*ERE e*verY Th*iG*N   IS SaaaaAAAIIId A*Nddd D*ONE<br>  <br>  Now that detention is over you have to wait outside. After while you mom picks you up. Oops you forgot you books. So you and your mom turn back and get them. Sense you forgot your books you check your locker for other things. Now that you have checked your locker for other things you think that it is a mess. So you decide to clean it up. Cleaning up is hard so you'd have to ask for the janitors help. The brings out his vacuum.... Now that he has brght out his vaccume cleaning up was faster.<br>  <br>  Now that your done your ready to leave but your mom had gotton in a conversation with a school teacher and they becme friends. They decide to have dinner right now right away. And bring you along. <br>  <br>  Sense they have dinner they would also like to go to the movies. And sense they went to the movies they decided to get popcorn. If they got popcorn they would ant it buttered. But some of you wouldn't JUST want popcorn so you get Dots (I don't care whether or not you like them NOW YOU DO!!!!!!)<br>  <br>  (Fine you don't want dots) You spill the dots on the floor. Sense you spilled them on the floor you'd have to pick them up. And if you picked them up you'd have to find a garbage can. You can't find one so you decide to use one in the bathroom. Thinking of the bathroom genrealy makes you wanna use it so you do your bussines and leave..... Now that you left you decide to buy [insert candy item here (SENCE YOUR SO PICKY ABOUT IT)]<br>  <br>  Now that you bought the candy all three of you go  to the movies. The movie was horrible so you leave after the first hour. And go to anther one. All of you have trouble looking for a right on. So oyu ask the store manager. He picks THAT ONE for you. so you go to THAT ONE. Oh wait before though you buy some more popcorn this time with pepper on it. And you buy some more [Insert candy here].<br>  <br>  Halfway through the movie a fairy appears. He asks if he can have some of [that candy] You say no. He gets mad. And if you made a fairy mad then you can consider yourself cursed for the rest of your life. So he puts a curse on you where you have to climb the highest mountain of the highest from mars. You teleport there right away. It made no sence though--how can someone breathe with no air? But you don't quetion it. So you start climbing it. Sense there is barely any gravity its pretty simple but takes you three hours (Mars time). On the top you see this crystl clear pool of water. And that made no sense either--How could water be on a place with no oxygen. CLimbing the moutain made you thirtsy <br>  <br>  OOoops i htink i gatta go i may be in trouble. I have to do my homework brb....MAYBE!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  WAIT I AM IN THE PROCESS OF WRITING A SHORT STORY FOR THIS ANSWER!!!! I'm bored anyway so it doesn't matter.....|`|fd49b8200c95f63c9d123f0e8819bf8caa	studying. math final tomorrow.<br>  ugh.<br>  :(

iZrNlSIJaa	Yes, he's cute.
lhLy0upKaa	Beats me! Well, technically..I should say" Nobody Beats Me..but anyhoo..No i wouldn't stay and any person that would, is a weak willed no self-esteem having ding bat. (and staying for the kids is just a cop out) Anyway, Yeah they are the new Millenium Ike and Tina. Fa Sho. Who knew Rhianna was such a ditz. Poor girl. He must be hitting it right..in more ways than one!|`|zupJYkngaa	I don't think so, Cuz Chris only beat her on one occasion. Ike, he beat Tina whenever he wanted to. Lol, Rhianna might become the next Tina Turner (not when performing) if Chris beats her more... <br>  I don't know which video it is but, on youtube there was a conversation about Chris and Rhianna being the next Ike and Tina. All of them said no because they couldn't perform the way they did!<br>  I was apart of the conversation.<br>  Wow, I guess your another Role Model for me =)!|`|T1Exjnyraa	no. they havent reached the crack part of their relationship|`|v57IhvGhaa	Dont you even begin to call someone dumb for returning to an abusive spouse.  You obviously have never been in that situation (thankfully)  otherwise you would have some compassion and sympathy.<br>  Its a vicious psychology cycle that is hard to break out of and I can only imagine how much worse it is for those in the limelight all the time.<br>  <br>  I have been in an abusive household for most of my life.  At times I have asked my mum why?  And at others I have been scared when she wanted to leave him.  You are lucky that you are evidently one of the few strong people that could break the cycle.  However most people (and you CAN quote me on this, ask any psychologist/psychiatrist the statistics) take a while to break the cycle if they are even able to break it.  Cultural factors, social factors, monetary factors, personal psychological factors - they all contribute to ones ability to break the cycle.<br>  <br>  edited:<br>  <br>  Im not making excuses.  You dont know anything about my situation so don't presume things.  Every situation is different.  I work in childcare, and we do alot of work with DoCs (child protective services equivalent in Australia).  So when you say things about people using children as an excuse to stay, then you are saying that about 90% of people exposed to domestic violence are using excuses.  I actually honestly doubt your integrity here as to whether or not you have really been exposed to the situation other wise you would definitely have more sympathy for people in the situation rather than acting arrogant about being able to pull yourself out of one and expecting everyone to follow suit.  Your behavior is quite disgusting and inhumane as you ridicule people for being in very sad, very serious situations.|`|AA12303060	There is a huge difference between those two couples.<br>  Number one, no one knew Tina was abused until she wrote her book in 85 (or something). She was married to Ike for 18 years.<br>  The night Rihanna was beaten the whole world knew.<br>  Until you are in a abusive relationship, you never know what you would do.|`|7ADHptSaaa	MORE LIKE WHITNEY AND BOBBY!<br>  <br>  <br>  H NO!
ntJx4fmYaa	I love both Edward and Jacob!<br>  <br>  It is so hard to choose between them!! <br>  They are both amazing characters, and are both good for Bella<br>  <br>  :)|`|R7x0qIqyaa	Neither.<br>  More like "Twilight time ladies"|`|Ii7vzF65aa	Neither. That is just a bunch of crap.|`|s7UWLOS9aa	I swear, if I see another damn question about "Twilight," I'm going to take a butcher knife and chop off my limbs one-by-one. *Eye twitch*|`|af4772f173ca267b8f3a8a7329ca035aaa	I like both so i can't really  choose between them.

lRBRh5qSaa	Family. The Elders (believe that with age came wisdom). Crops (whatever there certain crop was in order for them to survive--they worked endlessly on it).|`|UuGOHHG5aa	Ancestors  ,  commitment to the tribe  , and  anything that could give you an edge  in a fight .<br>  I dont agree with crops I think most  subsaharan africans were more like hunter-gatherers .|`|2KX0ZInOaa	yes
6lyGn3kKaa	People like P Diddy hate to think of losing money selling up Chris Brown and will stop at nothing to keep his CD stocked in the stores. It's not a culture, but a high power marketing executive aka Bad Boy Records. At least their not peeing on their fans and biting bats heads on stage as in some cultures of Heavy Metal where they don't seem to care.|`|do8pdlluaa	Chris Brown was charged with two felonies, so everyone should care. He beat Rihanna, it's serious.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1535097/chris_browns_day_in_court_brown_charged.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|AA10388256	Here, let me take a survey of all 35 million of Blacks in the US and ask why none of us care. I'll get back to you in 2045.<br>  <br>  Yes, its because it happens everyday in our culture and only our culture. No one else's. As a matter of fact, I have to go now to stop my dad from beating my mom. You are so lucky that domestic violence doesnt happen in your "culture."<br>  <br>  ......idiot.|`|AA10796624	You are obviously very ignorant.  It's never ok for a man to hit a woman, no matter what color they are.  Why does everything always come down to skin color in this country?  Stupid.|`|da4zS4AOaa	I don't agree with him hitting her! It's getting annoying that they talk about this a lot in the media.|`|PCpC4iS1aa	that's what they do and the crazy thing is that they still support him and listen to his music|`|DdSnno9daa	cuz it is acceptable in the black community|`|wmtbNdO0aa	What makes you think they don't care?|`|5wkeQLERaa	yeah black ppl dont care cuz its normal 2 them i gues|`|w6tQEuKCaa	i care...how the f**k u gon say we dnt care..wat we supposed to do??
hF7HyDXEaa	yes, i would because why would i not read about myself, i mean its not like i am the most important thing in my life, but i could uncode things i never knew about myself. since there would be a writer, listing all the things i never knew about mio|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	nice question.<br>  yes it would be good bed time reading to put me to sleep or re produce nightmares!|`|avlVHXDCaa	ya<br>  cuz|`|rcHnA1iQaa	Indeed I would to see if there was any mistakes which I can pretty much guarantee|`|ZyfYh4vdaa	no my life is very boring|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Yes, it would be good for a laugh. =)|`|fT15YEkFaa	no, too much pain|`|yYXWcAgYaa	yes|`|2MlJ5OdYaa	No, I don't seek out things that make me sad.|`|ec55348158c3fd8764f5daba79c0af3daa	I would.<br>  <br>  I've led a pretty interesting life.  I've had several careers, been married twice, have sons and stepsons, traveled a good part of the world, met a lot of interesting people and even a few famous ones.<br>  <br>  I would also be interested in knowing more about how it all comes out.  I know I will die.  I don't know how or when and am somewhat curious about it.<br>  <br>  I might hope for a greatly abridged version of the life story, however, since it has taken me three score and seven years to reach this age.|`|Pwmcpo5Paa	Yeah and you could put me under the adventure heading! I have and still plan to continue to have an awesome life. Variety might be the spice of life but adventure is the meat and potatoes. A known fact that could be put in the Novel would be that you can see my charisma from space. How many people can say that?|`|AA10889282	No. Reeeally boring|`|go1jIgbwaa	Just for the fun of it, but I'm sure I would know the ending.<br>  ;)|`|VBdXray0aa	No.  First off, it would seem unbelievable and secondly, it is too sad.|`|GfG6wupTaa	yes! I've done some wild ****!!!!!!|`|3IimJWgXaa	no i wouldnt read it. i wouldnt read it because i couldnt read in detail or handle seeing it written on paper all the horrific things that have happened. I know it would be to emotional. I dont want to admit that it happened, and then seeing it written on paper? its almost like confirming it. Its in ink, it can't be erased.|`|gmH1MPn1aa	OF course... Cuz my life is freakin fabulous, I have God, love, career, inspiring challenges I've overcome and who wouldn't want to read about that.|`|bbHoF5jsaa	Yes, because My life has so many things...adventures and problems..so many many things!!|`|zvHYxpVCaa	i just might.<br>  my life is pretty interesting, but not too cheesy or over dramatic :]|`|9qKwTGeOaa	Yeah, but there would be 1, a lot of reader's block, 2, there would be a lot of old memories that might make me put the book down for a while.|`|fdxIZDtOaa	no because i dont really do much exciting things and i havent had that many boyfriends. it would just be really really really boring.|`|gX0lCfiYaa	No...I somehow doubt people would read a book on me, I haven't really done anything that great with my life...So no. Unless I am a superhero...|`|LK26v0z3aa	Yes, because something interesting happens everyday.|`|VOC3KhdHaa	Absolutely!

If you're not wealthy,  call your county offices & find out what's available at a low cost through the county healthy services or if you're in college, then at the college's clinic.  <br>  <br>  If you're in charge, then at least take charge & call around & find out what's available & at what cost.  Then you & your wife or gf can make a decision about what to do & how to pay for it.  Being in charge doesn't mean that you decide everything.

PSY5G9tTaa	Screamo is a type of Post-Hardcore music. Involving, you guessed it, screaming.<br>  <br>  Examples:<br>  The Devil Wears Prada<br>  Inhale Exhale<br>  Underoath<br>  LoveHateHero|`|42d1de7ff8420f02c887feec3a13ae5baa	It mainly describes emo-style rock bands that incorperate black metal or death metal screams(shrieks or growls).<br>  <br>  I don't listen to screamo, but someone else should have examples.|`|NQ0I9Ywwaa	its like my chemical romance but with tons of screaming, and not like killswitch engage, its rather like a teenager screaming high pitched and complaining bout his life...pretty gay|`|dkQFdStBaa	It's a word|`|zVWtgbOHaa	yeah. pretty much. i love it!|`|P9K7AYmWaa	its where theres all kinds of instruments and someone screams RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH and its totally annoying|`|tyeCsbk1aa	No, you are actually wrong. Not all rock music with screaming is screamo. In this sense, it is a word used by close-minded elitists in describing metal bands that use a diverse array of vocal techniques that they simply don't like.<br>  <br>  Screamo in the truest sense has nothing to do with metal; I repeat, nothing. Screamo grew out of the emo scene, which was an offshoot of the hardcore punk scene in the early 1990s (that's right, screamo has been around for a while). That was the first wave. <br>  <br>  It is a style of punk, not metal. Both styles use highly distorted guitars, "extreme" vocals, and energetic, often frenetic compositions, but the similarity ends there. Metal—even metal with screaming—existed long before screamo ("long" by rock music standards).<br>  <br>  Screamo is CERTAINLY NOT "emo bands that incorporate black-metal or death-metal vocals". Screamo bands use anxious screams and yelling; black metal bands use inhuman, harsh shrieks; death metal uses a completely different style of vocals called the "death growl": it is guttural, throaty, and deep. <br>  <br>  The closest thing in metal you will find to screamo is metalcore—but the two are completely different genres. And the reason I say it's close is because it is also influenced heavily by hardcore punk, which is the origin of screamo. You will often find "melodic metalcore" bands who use harsh, screaming vocals in the verses for example, then switch it up and do very clean, melodic choruses. <br>  <br>  But do not fall into the trap of believing that screamo means any style of music with screaming in it. And don't believe that "emo" means any style of rock with emotional vocal delivery.
lRBRh5qSaa	yeah that is good. you are just below the top ten percent in your class.|`|1P5qWMQ0aa	I'm 2 of 328, but it's very good.|`|7ADHptSaaa	......I DON'T THINK SO|`|AA10621474	Yeah its not bad.
XD5CBWKqaa	Yes, I can't even play the piano, I can, but like I'm in the first level!|`|tG5Ar7DIaa	No.|`|uiGx0rPVaa	Nah. The best Musicians have a great disabilities.

Anyone who believes that they can do a thing and are willing to put in the work usually succeed.|`|7rtu5n1taa	I don't watch American Idol but on one show I saw a blind guy ride a bike. He made noises with his mouth to see if something was in front of him. So it doesn't surprise me that a blind guy can play a piano.|`|9faf164b8bfd02a8adbd83229d74816baa	No. If you play each note and memorize how they sound. playing piano would become easier over time. Yes it will take longer since you can't read music notes but some people learn by ear/hearing.|`|AA11721605	No, and I'm so happy for him it's nice to know that people still overcome physical boundaries and can do amazing things such as him|`|Wb1ydezNaa	no,many blind people play the piano and very well at that.Scott is a wonderful piano player and I am so glad he made it to the top 12|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	Look at Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles.<br>  <br>  Both blind men, both piano/keyboard geniuses.<br>  <br>  ask your parents.|`|a8i7NGu2aa	not really. most people who lack one sense have even stronger other senses so I thought his sense of touch would be on the spot.|`|kAhXleGaaa	Not at all.|`|ihxDB6KLaa	no not really|`|8MnjjpJ7aa	Not at all think about Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles. When you are blind your other senses are better.|`|uCCxbXJjaa	no stevie wonder can too . =)|`|4Ug9FdFdaa	omg he could ?!|`|6yYMUwQmaa	no not at all|`|98PLi1Rbaa	yea he got skills|`|O1o0oNLxaa	im kinda suprised but think hes really cool because he can do so many things with his condition|`|pkDSL0mjaa	no|`|qM35nXVsaa	.|`|kdmGZn8taa	no not really u can feel the keys w/ ur hands|`|gD7MWKMtaa	No, I'm not surprised.|`|eSDVKxsZaa	no, anything is possible....stevie wonder......maybe he learned b4 he got blind..and he has a lot of talent!|`|ihxO8qApaa	no, its not like blind people cant memorize what they touch|`|QS7gq7Fzaa	I hope he wins(**)|`|5wkeQLERaa	not really...hmph|`|ViZyM2AUaa	... no... ?<br>  <br>  <br>  Is this a trick question?|`|6Tw5bxXPaa	Um, no.|`|tBJnxEjGaa	Not really ! When one is without one of the 5 senses - the other senses makes up for it ! There are many Famous people who are blind and yet play the piano . Like 5 Year Old Blind Pianist Performs in Singapore, and 8 yr old Pat B. ladies nephew (born blind) playing and singing "Listen to your heart " on the piano, Stevie Wonder, etc. <br>  Historically, many blind musicians, including some of the most famous, have performed without the benefit of formal instruction, since such instruction relies extensively on written musical notation. However, today there are many resources available for blind musicians who wish to learn Western music theory and classical notation. Louis Braille, the man who created the braille alphabet for the blind, also created a system of classical notation for the blind called Braille music. This system allows the blind to read and write music just as the sighted do. The largest collection of Braille musical scores is located at the Library of Congress in Washington D.C..[1] Outside the U.S., the largest collection of braille music scores is stored at the National Library for the Blind in England.|`|BGCiqQFgaa	No, because people who have a sense disability have heightened other senses. This would make it easier for him to pick up on the music. Oh and also, that man is legally blind, but I think he can make out colors and shapes. Watch, and you'll see he knows where to look like when he high fived Ryan Seacrest.|`|EwvZCLkjaa	no<br>  people who don't play instruments always think this is amazing<br>  if i was blind i could still play guitar, because you memorize where everything is, thats how people play without looking<br>  also he is only legally blind, he can still see<br>  to him life is like looking through a straw|`|s5XNGbOMaa	What I think was even MORE amazing was that Beethoven was deaf the last years of his life, yet he was still able to compose beautiful music.<br>  <br>  No, it doesn't suprise me. I had a friend in high school who was blind and played the piano.|`|H2yac1kUaa	whoa, that's freaky.<br>  well, yea i am, but piano players, like, other than him, (and i don't play piano) will probably say different not.<br>  <br>  wait, NO<br>  because the keys have pitches in them, so he just has to learn one, and if he can do intonation, then he should be fine!<br>  yess!<br>  i win!!!|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	No, Stevie Wonder is blind and he has played the piano all his career. So hasn't Ray Charles. Another oldie that was blind and played the piano for many years.|`|BY6OSDSeaa	i dont watch AI, but my parents do, and im not that surprised, blind people can do lots of stuff, i saw some play baseball once!!(on tv) THAT surprised me!!|`|48SlX2Yiaa	No, it's not the first time a blind person played a piano <br>  <br>  Not saying that it's not impressive, but I'm not surprised.|`|BDK6PTXFaa	no but im surprised randy jackson's fatass came up with americas best dance crew when his fatass cant even run 15 meters without stopping for a candy bar|`|N2XKAzZQaa	not particularly, but i do find it amazing when blind people can play the piano<br>  <br>  :)|`|VGhVdWVcaa	No, most people with a disability do many things that make there life as normal as possible. They have interest and talents just like everyone else.|`|MDsufhrZaa	uhm hello?<br>  have you heard of stevie wonder? ray charles?<br>  great pianists were blind, losing their sense of sight gave them amazing ability to hear things.|`|MmqEz3T2aa	why.... that's really ignorant!! <br>  what about Ray charles?<br>  He's blind... and one of the most famous piano players ever.<br>  Open your closed mind!|`|STUJOkAraa	Stevie Wonder was blind and played the piano, too.|`|2OoyYsA2aa	hes not really blind<br>  hes just a blatent lier|`|cQ4ZzKCkaa	no not really|`|dyNxQtdqaa	Not really.

I mean, Yeah, They lose their SIGHT, But, They can STILL: Hear & Feel!|`|5SpUU4z4aa	no because they are people two.its hard enough for a person with sight to learn piano.but a blind  person is a blessing and differently a trained skill.i wish them all the best.we should learn and not take forgrantrd|`|n96Sqc9waa	no, i can play without looking, it aint hard...<br>  and im 13...|`|LEqoMtJlaa	Not really, you can learn the keys without looking at them.|`|EzrdyxAiaa	nope some of the best were blind -- ray charles for one!!!|`|DbNbWQflaa	no like me i am not blind but when one has music in their soul you go by sound anything could be made into music  even raindrops, if you listen ,,like splattering their is a instument that makes that sound just have to have the imagination and the sound,|`|JMI40MHpaa	not at all.....now if he was a paraplegic id be hella surprized|`|1PGmB4JNaa	not at all <3|`|Ii7vzF65aa	No..

oFv3v9Oeaa	The more games you play, the more your communication...trust...and faith in one another degenerates and creates more "Is it real or is it BS?" moments. <br>  <br>  No games...not now, not ever. Never. If you have to resort to that level of deceit and trickery, the relationship is already failed.

I just kept telling myself that it wasn't really happening.<br>  As much as I miss him, I wouldn't want him to really come visit because I would rather know that he is watching out for me and is proud of what I'm doing instead of him coming back to chill with me =P. Because I think it would hurt the loved ones more than anything, and also the person who died because quite often people take a different path in life that they may not have approved of.|`|edzU8VJiaa	Ooh, not sure about this. <br>  <br>  If it was my Mum, then yes, I'd love to think she could come back to see me, 'cos I still miss her after 20 years, and still find myself wishing she was here so I could tell her something.<br>  <br>  If it was my Mother-in-law, though (she died a couple of months ago) then Noooooo!<br>  <br>  On the whole then, I suppose I have to say no, even though it means I won't see my Mum.<br>  <br>  Any chance we can choose who's allowed to visit?  If so, then I'm all for it!|`|tsmBfwm0aa	yeah. I have alot of family members, especially my grandpa, that I miss so much and I would feel so much better being able to see them, even if it were for 30 seconds. Its so hard with them gone sometimes.|`|nooi0ldjaa	nope, thats a zombie. zombies want brains. i want to keep my brain.|`|BAlYRNN8aa	Yes! <br>  <br>  After a friend of mine died when i was 15, im certain he visited me in my dreams lol? it was so crazy but life like...!|`|AA12067891	no, because that'd just stir up all the bad feelings.

But I do have this one story. I remember in 8th grade, I had my cell phone in my back pocket and I didn't turn it off. And out of nowhere my cell phone went,"Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system." It turns out that I accidentally called someone while sitting on my phone and hadn't noticed and accidentally turn it on speaker. My teacher was all,"KATHERIN! What was that?" And I was like,"It's my cell phone." She said,"Well it's mine now!" My mom had to pick it up after school.|`|ksSyjIUeaa	no and i dont even have a cell,|`|EtLDmuhqaa	no.  but whenever it vibrates...<br>  its freaking loud!!!  =\<br>  one time my teacher was like<br>  "what was that?" everybody knew<br>  that it was my phone...<br>  but i told her:<br>  "miss. we didnt hear anything. you are probably<br>  imaginating things:" she kindda believed it since<br>  she was an old lady...thank god i didnt get in trouble =D|`|daij1eBCaa	Yeah and I got it taken up. ?|`|go1jIgbwaa	Yeah. haha.<br>  My sister's ringtone was "U Can't Touch this" by MC Hammer and it played really loud when we were taking a quiz. My teacher informed me that yes, it was a good song, but this wasn't the 90's, so I should turn my phone off.<br>  haha|`|aae4d303fe9bd3bec8a94721211dbfbcaa	no but it vibrates loud.|`|9FLNHJtvaa	Nope!<br>  But this guy sitting next to me his phone started ringing the teacher was looking at everyone tryin to figure out whos phone it was.

xJqb88oAaa	You have created a logical fallacy.  "Life ALWAYS comes from life and there is ALWAYS a creator" but I REFUSE to question where God came from because I have faith and that's what faith is all about.|`|e4hkuXJlaa	I think believing in nothing takes more faith. Believing in God, to me, means that you need to have things explained and be assured that there is something after death, and that something created us,etc. Believing in nothing basically says that you are fine with not knowing what the hell life is all about. that's harder  to except then grasping onto something that may or may not be true.|`|mggll8dRaa	Just look at an Ocean, or a natural Wonder, or the Sky & stars; then if You don't believe, is there any intelligence at all....??<br>  So, the word 'Faith' is incorrect.....!!|`|napgiSmXaa	Hello New York Diva PartII<br>       Well no!  It does however take a very,very crass attitude.<br>       God is the creator.maker,inventor and Life giver.  He is the truth there is nothing without God.<br>         Christian Greetings|`|hy45DHxgaa	Dear NY Diva:<br>  <br>  How about "believing" in REALITY ??<br>  <br>  Theology is an * ILLUSION * !<br>  Religion is a way, for small minded people~<br>  to help them Cope with life's Challenges.<br>  It makes their lives "Easier" !!<br>  <br>  I do NOT require this!<br>  <br>  I think it takes More Intelligence, to be<br>  Grounded in Truth & REALITY!<br>  <br>  It takes a Great Amount of Gullibility~<br>  to believe in Pink Unicorns or a "god".<br>  <br>  Most Bible Thumpers can't handle the REAL<br>  TRUTH Or FACTS !! They choose to<br>  live their lives in "Disney" !<br>  <br>  Apparently it is "Harder" for most, to see<br>  REALITY & live their lives accordingly!|`|Afzknn9Laa	Honestly, I'm an Atheist and the reason why I am is because I don't practice a religion and I don't see what the point of one is. And I'm 14, so yeah, I'm still young and I probably don't know much about life but this is just how I see things in my perspective. I just think if you die, then you die. There's no heaven or hell (in my opinion). I mean, you had your time on Earth so it has to end sometime. I don't really have faith in anything because I seriously cannot think that there is some high-powered man living somewhere really high up in the sky. Religion is just something I don't think about and even care about because it doesn't affect my life. This is actually the first I thought and talked about it. Life is life, so live it up.<br>  <br>  But if you do believe in God and have some sort of religion, then good for you. I don't see anything wrong with having faith in God, it's just that I don't. Trust me, I'm not trying to offend anyone by this either.|`|yAXrsQiFaa	Nope.|`|30bec3177e3b5db11c5b72b82bf84bb5aa	I believe in a higher power even though i can't prove it it is something i feel.

And I think it's because Taylor swifts all the time.

I think Taylor Swift is a horrible singer, but anyways she does look like Fergie a bit.

If the latter, I would go through all the "lands" -- again, I don't know what they are for Disneyland or if all the parks are the same, but for Disney World in Orlando you have Tomorrowland, Frontierland, Adventureland, Toontown, Fantasyland, etc.  You could have the characters dressed differently for the different lands... Western, Futuristic, stuff like that.

dIVbe8cQaa	learn to love yourself and find happiness in the joys you experience going through everyday life. you're special and good and strong and unique and beautiful and stay that way and don't lose yourself just to be like everybody else for the sake of having somebody to talk to. it gets lonely sometimes, but you can't force people to like you and you can't change yourself to get people to like you, 'cause you only hurt yourself. as long as you know you're the best you can be, you're all right. they're the ones missing out on the great you. you're not missing anything. concentrate on school and making something out of your life.|`|WM3h9Nnpaa	your just bringing yourself down trust me your family loves you.and im sure if you just be positive and be yourself it will all come into place thats i got the girlfriend i always wanted.|`|lkJ1M01Uaa	Two words:  Killing Spree|`|689c2e5e8e30430e09b45870c065b531aa	I'd like to say that you need to learn to be happy with yourself, and be secure in your own worth as a person - but then I remember what it was like when I was thirteen and had no real friends - I was miserable until I joined a group of people outside of school who shared some of the interests I had. Even with that, it was hard.<br>  <br>  So, yes you can survive, and yes, life will get better. And you will find people who want to be with you just because of who you are. Give your family a chance, they might surprise you.<br>  <br>  You're welcome to talk to me anytime if you don't mind talking to an old, tired, scientist.|`|7HBwudViaa	Have you ever tried just going up to a random person who is sitting by them self. You could go up to them and start a convosation. I am sure there are other people in you school who you havent met, and who don't like sports. They probably feel the same way you do! Your next break try going up to someone who is by them self and just start talking! :) Good Luck! <br>             P.S. I know this may sound lame, but rememeber that God is  Real and he Loves You! He wont leave you! If you want to learn more about God try opening up a bible which has RED LINES in it, those are all the parts that Jesus spoke, They are powerful and make me feel loved every time I read them!(you can even get one from the library!) <br>             P.P.S.You may feel like your family only likes you because <br>                       You are blood related, but they love you. They really do! <br>                       I am not just saying that!|`|KiSKjUE7aa	Hi, <br>  <br>  Your situation don't sound like much fun... And I am afraid what I will say probably won't please you... But sometimes you got to hit bottom before you can climb up again?<br>  <br>  It is rare for everyone to be wrong and you be right?<br>  <br>  Reasons and or motives ALWAYS precede actions!<br>  <br>  What are the reasons / motives for others to not want to be friends (their actions) with YOU???<br>  <br>  You are not allowed to answer "I don't know"! <br>  <br>  Look at your answers and change your behaviour / actions that others don't like or appreciate. <br>  <br>  There is nothing more stupid than doing the same thing over and expecting different results...<br>  <br>  It seems whatever it is, YOU need to change! Or else everyone else is wrong?|`|OmsYxRDDaa	When i started 7th grade, my best friends ditched me for no reason at all!!!  But then i went and talked to some of my other classmates form 6th grade and we started hanging out and now i relized that the friends who ditched me weren't really good friends.  The friends i have now r the best ones ever.  Try to talk with people from your classes...if they say they don't want to hang out with you then go to another person or group.  The worst thing that will happen is that they'll say no.  You'll never know unless you try.  Also you can try and join some after school groups if you have any and talk to those people.|`|Yxaht4Cbaa	I know what you are going through!  It is really painful,but Please don't try to change yourself to fit a mold though!  <br>  There are others somewhere that don't do things just to fit in, but believe in being the unique person that they are.   Even if you don't draw a "crowd" of admirers you can at least be happy at the end of the day that you have been honest with yourself and others... Shakespeare- "...to thine ownself be true".  <br>  The truth about school is that everyone is pretty insecure and wants to be liked.  Some crave power and some like to follow a leader, some are clowns, and some are naturally "photogentic"...etc.  <br>  Those who step on others to climb the "ladder" of popularity, are at risk of being stepped on too.  It is all a game, and you don't have to play!!!!   Be yourself, develop new interests, be open and friendly and someone who has the sense to see a good friend in the making, will value you for you, not because you've "transformed" yourself  into the sporty image.  Next year sporty may be out, and you'll have to change to something else.... Headache City!!!!     You could do everything humanly possible to be that "new sporty" look and still not be accepted.   <br>  <br>  It is said that the only thing different in a person from year to year is the people they meet and the books they read.   Have you tried meeting others outside the "school loop".   What have you read recently?   Be so busy and such a mystery that others want to get to know you because you don't worry about getting in their cliche club.  <br>  <br>  I have had friends who were viewed by others as the "ugly duckling", but I could see their potential.   They stopped trying to crash into the cliche clubs around them, kept their mouths shut, focused on improving their minds and personalities and ended up with their dream girl/guy and plenty of friends.   <br>  <br>  Email me if you have more questions.  I'll try to help you as best I can!|`|TW4MHCybaa	Oh i feeel so bad for you!!!<br>  Here rub my belly! I'll purr for you!!!|`|7fs7VYTmaa	/=<br>  <br>  You could try to cheer up. Or bring a sign that says "Save a big, write a book" at one of the games. <br>  <br>  I'll be your friend also, if you want. I'm pretty much a "weirdo" or whatever teenagers seem to typecast me these days..|`|YQZdBHFpaa	wow...damn...i thought i was in a bad situation....my god..im really sorry but i cant help you...look...if i was there with you i would totally be your friend. i think you sound like the type of person i could help cheer up. and like the person i would be friends 4ever with|`|pWHT2f4eaa	pie.  nuff said.|`|UgDOkQKKaa	I'm homeschooled. my life story is trying to survive w/o friends... join a youth group. just not mine. theyll bite your head off|`|04dc0d2596b5e8336fe567281e72fb2faa	First off, all teens are depressed. That doesn't mean it isn't real, just that it isn't unusual. Second , you say you 'won't bother with 2/3rds of your school? Maybe you are missing out on a great person just like your so called friends are missing out on you. Give more kids a chance. I had a couple friends in school, but they were really good friends. Even if you are not really religious, maybe you could go to a church to meet some new kids? Hey, it is worth a try, right?

When we first met, I had a crush on him, but that quickly went away.  The more I got to know him, the more I realized that I love him as a friend but he and I are so not right for each other in that way. As far as I know, he's never had any romantic feelings for me. <br>  <br>  We're best friends, have been for over a year now.|`|gteQDUMpaa	ya i have a guy friend like that but our parents were friends b4 we were even born and we look at eachother like bro and sis. i mean we spend the nite at each others houses but its like staying up and talking to your bro who you havent seen in forever thats our relationship tho he treats my like a lil sister and i love him like someone would love their big brother|`|J0VzIyYjaa	yeah, he's been like my greatest friend for about 5 years and i love him..but i'm not inlove with him. He sometimes texts me goodnight which is sweet.

Weve been friends for about 5 years now.<br>  It was one of those things when we first met, we were attracted to each other. Both never really grew past a friendship, its great to have a really close girl thats a just a friend. And we hang out quite a lot, so some of the girlfriends ive had get a bit jealous, lol. Its awesome because we can talk about anything and not feel the pressure of a relationship.|`|JyrvQBVgaa	Yeah, I have one.. but he has feelings for me and always calls me beautiful and stuff. I REALLY wish I had a gay guy friend.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Before me and my boyfriend dated, we were really close.. We always sat together at basketball and football games and texted each other constantly. I knew everything he did during the day.. This went on for about six months, before we started falling for each other.

8xPBBJPcaa	the curious case of Benjamen Button is a very dramatic film. so yes man who got struck by lighting 7 times is most to be a comic Relief.<br>  however, its also a metaphor.  what it means is that no matter where you are , no matter what your doing , things you don,t expect can  and may happen to. how do know thats what it means? well , the man struck by lighting in places where its uselly hard to get struck by lighting.|`|68fabd3b833fc008897646f2a6b1dac6aa	No it's comic relief.

Unfortunately, middle school dating relationships are as closely knit as a lion and a gazelle. It gives them an insight into what the future might hold, but most relationships are totally pointless, more social than emotional.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, it's not a good idea because some kids just don't understand what a real relationship is like, and it may get out of hand, resulting in sex.<br>  <br>  I didn't date, nor have I dated in the 16 years and 2 months of my life so far. I'm 16, and if I had a kid, I don't think I would stop them, but I would tell them they can't take it past kissing. If my kid is caught doing something like having sex, they're gonna get their rear handed to them.|`|GR2XNzCCaa	I believe that people age 11 and up can date. That is just my opinion. (you know "date", hold hands, hug, say they like each other, become the new item at school) Nothing even close to physical until they're 12 or 13 though, and even then it would be just like kissing little pecks. By 14, making out is fine I think. That is pretty much middle school. So yes, dating is fine. No sex till late high school though, if at all. And yes, I did date in 8th grade. I'm 18 now. I have no kids yet, but I'm fine with my 13 year old sister dating guys as long as they treat her right.|`|mqucJZSUaa	well everyone grows up really fast. there is no stopping it.<br>  i think that there isn't a point fighting it, we do it, we take it our of control, and you know we definatly do things we shouldn't. we kiss, makeout, sometimes have sex. you know i personally wish i could be a kid, that i could not have to worry about makeup, boys, drama, being a ****, teenager ****. but i have to, and i do, but you know at heart we are all still kids, and i think adults forget that we can only handle so much even if we act like we could have the world on our shoulders and act like it's nothing.|`|uhZ38xYkaa	I think it should as long as they are mature and can handle having an intimate relationship without losing site of reality, and the consequences that come with it when going TOO far.

Anytime before then you are still developing hormones and love is more of a game than what it truly is. You don't understand the physical, mental, and emotional aspects of it.<br>  There comes a level of maturity to be in a real relationship. Without this you have children popping out like crazy.|`|YnBdka6naa	My sister, brother, and cousin are all in Middle School now. They've all claimed to dated. My cousin told me that she's not a virgin anymore and she's only 13! I don't see anything wrong with Middle School kids saying they have a boyfriend/girlfriend but when they start wanting to hang out with that boyfriend/girlfriend outside of school then the parents shouldn't let them. Kids are getting pregnant earlier and earlier. I didn't date when I was in Middle School. I wouldn't mind my kids stating "I have a boyfriend/girlfriend" but I'd never let them go to that person house or go out on real dates alone. That's just to much.|`|8bHuUJczaa	Im not for Middle school dating, and I AM in middle school. Some kids just dont know the meaning of love and end up dating a bunch of people.  I think dating should be a highschool thing because highschoolers tend to be a bit smarter and know that you shouldnt date 100,000 people because everyone else is dating 100,000 people.|`|ij9N9r5waa	I wasn't aware that our middle schools were dating, I didn't know they they had ever met,  Well I'm against that sort of thing, what will the kids think if on of them is late getting back to the parking lot in the mourning?  And what about offspring? is that where elementary schools come from?  I don't mind high schools dating but I draw the line at middle schools doing it. that's my Opinion.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	I don't think it should be allowed. I think there are more important things for kids to focus on rather than who likes who. They are just kids yet and they need to just have a childhood and wait until they mature to start dating. I never did it. I am 27 and no I wouldn't want my child to.|`|7fwEe9iZaa	i honestly think its a joke. i had a bf in middle school and i thought it was just a lame play-off at trying to grow up to quickly (btw it lasted like 3 weeks? which is generally how long they last). Kids generally do this cause they're fresh off from elementary.<br>  <br>  I am 17 going on 18.<br>  <br>  I would allow my child to date in high school. But i'd probably have to approve because of my lame maternal instincts.|`|5OF2k8D2aa	My only problem with it is that this girl at my middle school got knocked up in 8th grade. If you're stupid about it, then no, do NOT do it. Don't be like her. Her boyfriend is 17, though. <br>  I would let my kids do it, but  I would trust that I raised them well enough for them to have common sense.|`|oP0lL85Baa	Im 14<br>  in 8th grade...<br>  seriously, theres NO point to it. The "it" couple of my school went out for 8 months, then decided there was no point to it.<br>  we're at the age for our hormones to be insane and wackk, so like, we're bound to like a lotta people, <br>  <br>  but when you have a "boyfriend" at my age, you kinda feel like you're on a chain, and you cant flirt, dance, or basically even TALK to other guys without being labled a ****. <br>  <br>  its insane and pretty stupid. my longest relationship lasted a month.<br>  <br>  woo hoo.|`|P8WAKaWBaa	too young ok<br>  wait<br>  Have fun with them as in have little crush have little conversations and leave it alone no need for too much stuff because then you'd get sick of the small things and you would want to get a little too serious and there is no need for serious stuff at that age :)|`|jIeupHgJaa	I dunno.

If things go south, it will be a constant reminder. But if things go as planned I think you have made discreet choices.|`|OZjOqI43aa	I would definitely not do that. Sounds cute in theory, but imagine if anything bad happens down the road (and you know anything can happen), you are gonna see that tattoo that will be there forever and bring back bad memories for the rest of your life. It's the same as getting thier name tattoed on you. My mom did something similar (key and heart lock tattoos) and ended up paying a lot (thousands) to get it removed after the relationship fell through. Maybe instead of tattoos go have a date and get pics taken together to keep in your wallet to remind you of each other while you are apart. That way, just in case a pic can be thrown away. Best of wishes for your relationship though!!!|`|miI17WJ5aa	Never, ever get a tattoo that is connected with a bf/gf or husband/wife. It's a huge mistake, especially if you put any names or initials on it.<br>  <br>  Even if you don't put any names on it, don't do it.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  They may not be kids, but they're on your skin for the rest of your life.<br>  They cost $1000's to remove.<br>  *I know you're only 21 and you think you'll never break up, but the reality is that you could.*|`|AA11558801	i think that would be cute!<br>  is ther going to be a keyhole?<br>  buut that is a goood idea! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  buuuut, why not make it where it is less noticable?<br>  Because, it will always be there, but then if things end up not working out, you wont be reminded everyday about it.|`|bltgAc9Maa	Don't do it! Congrats on your upcoming wedding but have you ever thought if supposedly you both end up in a divorce? You would wanna get rid of the tattoo if it ever happens and it ain't feel that good. Trust me!|`|u2lYbPT2aa	That sounds great!! I was just wondering tho, why are you waiting so long to get married, when you both love each other, so much, and know you are right for each other??!!<br>  My very best to you!!

I promise you, you will regret it later in life; when your 'small, small, small ones' aren't so small anymore, and they ask you what happened there and why you got the tattoo, you will.<br>  <br>  This comes along with another set of issues that you will regret getting the tattoo in your later life.|`|pdHkLfwdaa	Man, everybody is so negative.  Talking about "when you guys break up" and "when its over".  Imposing that its not gonna work out, whats all that about people?  If you feel that strongly for someone i think its a cute idea.  Its not good to get names of your significant other because god forbid something does happen.  Kids names are different.  They will always be yours.  And you said they were gonna be really small tattoos which would be good.  Then it could be easily covered up by something else if need be.  <br>  <br>  There is some pros and cons about the whole deal.  And thats why you and your Fiance have to decide whats best.  But i am definitely diggin the 'Key to my Heart' symbolism.  I like it.  Go for it  :-)<br>  <br>  -ToDD|`|tLuQNoP2aa	I keep my tattoo's on a more personal level and don't share them. if you break up that will always remind you of him until you cover it up or remove it. three of my closest friends are tat artist and they all advise their customers against stuff like that for two reasons. one being that they make up most of the regret stories that make people frown on tats. and two 80 percent of them break up within a year.|`|DJ7EsdKoaa	Do not do it. If you've ever watched doctor Phil you will know not to even think of something like this. Sorry if this may offend you but sometimes people break up and that kind of thing is permanent and it will remind you of that guy for the rest of your life.|`|vOB3iVdxaa	I think that's really cute . If it were his name you were thinking of getting, I was going to advise against it since a lto can happen in three years, but I love the idea of the old-fashioned key !|`|AA11125459	AW that is so cute if you think about it. He has the key to your heart.<br>  <br>  but still<br>  I wouldn't<br>  bad reminder of him if you guys break up.|`|O6nKcE9yaa	well since you already have 2 kids at age 21 why don't you just go ahead and get that tattoo.|`|MlJr5YlSaa	Tattoos give people an unprofessional look. What makes you want to paint your body and not a canvas or a wall instead?|`|wWdQSuCbaa	Hey, if you both agree its a good idea, go for it.  I think thats cute. :)|`|sbJShu9vaa	Yeah get them!<br>  The heart should sooooo have a keyhole in it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|VN3R0I5Oaa	nah dont cuz u never kno waht might happen and your going to have an ugly reminder everyday after that uhm i suggest those necklces with broken heart?|`|i4QPLfEVaa	Dont!|`|1vi7PX0Faa	Make me the Best Man on your wedding day.|`|6npsRIzUaa	you're gonna regret it when you break up a week after they're done.|`|1wDkKyLCaa	just don't get any names of each other cause you'll regret it|`|E6Wjfh0Naa	no, u'll regret when u break up.... reminds him every times u sees it. everyday.|`|CmuFxXlwaa	you might want to be careful that he isnt too scared to get the tattoo, but that is a creative idea you should definetly do it if you two are already planning youre marriage and just be sure you wont regret it, however a rule for me has always been if you want to do something involving a significant other, wait two months so that way you have tiime to think about it and if you still want to do it then, just go for it.|`|Lgv7ONHqaa	I won't say don't do it, but remember: tattoos are permanent, and they may not seem as novel and fun after even a few years of having them.<br>  <br>  Maybe do something else? Get a matching piercing or something and wear key and heart jewelry? lol, I don't know. I just err toward making decisions that have less of a chance of leading to regret (not saying you will regret it, but it is ink... on your skin... FOREVER).<br>  <br>  ;)|`|TB8rfMrHaa	If you've thought about it for a while and you are certain you don't mind owning it for life "Go ahead!"  It's not as though you are planting his name in 4" letters across your backside!  I waited 'til I was 48 yrs old to get a tattoo I had wanted for 20 yrs.  I haven't regretted it, yet!  I'm now 55 and ready to get mine recolored and add a little something!  Good Luck|`|uxE00bL8aa	I say do it.  It's a little intimacy you two can share.  Obviously, you don't feel tats are trashy or tacky.  My bf and I are getting tats on our backs.  The only thing I don't recommed is his name.  Though you're planning to get married, names are never a safe bet... unless it's your relatives or your kids.|`|uYJU9hwUaa	it sounds really cute<br>  but maybe wait until after you're married?<br>  not being nasty, but anything could happen and would you want to have the heart if you broke up knowing he had the key?<br>  x

lSvUIKsDaa	I actually think you're wrong. <br>  <br>  1) Crappy movies have always been made in huge volume, it's just that time has weeded them out and left us with the good ones so that we have a skewed perspective of the quality of older movies.<br>  <br>  2) Every great artist has a peak. Woody Allen and Jean luc Godard no longer make great movies because they are past their peaks. Naturally, if you think they are the only good filmmakers in the world, you'll have a negative view of film quality now. So find new filmmakers who are currently peaking or who are on the rise. They're out there, I promise.|`|gGSf6ED5aa	You are watching the wrong movies mate.<br>  <br>  Try;<br>  Gone Baby Gone<br>  The Escapist<br>  The Visitor<br>  The Black Balloon<br>  <br>  All are fantastic.. <br>  <br>  But yes, "Hollywood blockbusters" are predominantly crap.|`|iPje1iyGaa	I don't think it's the fact that directors and producers aren't creative.  It has more to do with the lack of acting talent in Hollywood right now.|`|SjPvc2pmaa	i've noticed that too and what bugs me is that all the stories are the same. theres hardly ever a new plot or a different kind of story|`|dPicgCgwaa	youre right, money has become the motivation for film making these days, often resulting in tragically bad movies.|`|O6nKcE9yaa	yea, cuz every story line is played out.  even things that will never happen ever like someone being switched into someone else's body have been played out.|`|VN3R0I5Oaa	naw man im with u movies suck people cant come up with any so there forced to redo old movies|`|1wDkKyLCaa	i agree, i was just thinking that the other day|`|uhk5ur9zaa	No, it ain't you mate.  <br>  <br>  I don't know about getting worse but maybe they're just not making many movies that you used to and still enjoy. I won't go to the flicks unless it's worth the bucks they charge for.  I would rather wait for the DVD. <br>  <br>  Yes, there's also the money factor. <br>  <br>  It's like the music scene, TV programmes, the taste and quality of food, and pure respect for each other.  It's a funny world now. <br>  <br>  They just don't make them like they use to.<br>  <br>  I'm a biased kiwi so the last movies that I ever got excited about was The Lord of the Rings trilogy and man I think everyone was a winner there.  Studios got their money and it was a pretty good ride - all 3 movies.<br>  <br>  We've got some pretty good local stuff down here in New Zealand which I'm grateful for  when we're sick of the hollywood stuff.<br>  <br>  Good question.|`|IYNDaQ2taa	No I think they're better than old days movies! and still getting better!|`|EblQojpEaa	I agree, unfortunately the only good movies are independent films and are less seen in the public. I was so happy that a movie like slumdog millionaire made it.<br>  <br>  The Entertainment Industry is soley focused on making money, hence the jonas brothers, miley cyrus and the rest of the highschool musical gang. 10 years ago this wouldnt have ever been mainstream, top money making stuff.<br>  <br>  Im so sick of watching the same movies over and over again with the different actors. It's rare these days that you find a movie that is different and good in its own right, and if you do, you better believe within 5 years someone will remake it or put out 2 3 or 4 sequels. 2 incredible hulk movies in the last 5 yrs......come on, i know the first one sucked, but really? why not make a good one the first time? instead of just selling us a hyped up piece of commercial crap.....<br>  <br>  Dont get me wrong, there has been some great movies as well, but the majority are commercial pieces of poop.|`|XZecjMyXaa	films in the old times used to be kind of better, but they are still many great films that came out or are about to x]|`|pvosPN40aa	yes, writers seem to be running out of ideas. Along with that special effects make it easier to have bad actors/actresses.|`|I1K6SC43aa	I think people's standards are just lower now.<br>  <br>  I mean, look at High School Musical. The fact that is succeeded proves my point.|`|JTSNljLhaa	films now days just copy others..theyre running out of ideas|`|3d7rK5Z4aa	I'm always saying this. I think now days the movies are repeats of bad repeats. No originality and no taste. Also there aren't many movies with just actors! alot of scenes are computerized and full of special affects. It doesn't take special affects to make great films it takes great directors writers and actors. I hardly watch new movies. If I want to watch a movie I dig out an old classic.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	no it's not just you. I have no faith in the film industry these days. I am a horror buff and no movie out today can realy be called a horror film. I stick to watching classic films.........this crap they call movies today is  just a joke! Sad remakes of everything....no creativity!|`|R7tr1umSaa	I'm half-half on it. I feel as though everyone has run out of ideas, although this year had really good movies. I particularly enjoyed Slumdog Millionaire, Milk, The Dark Knight, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Wall-E, and Get Smart. I loved those ones!|`|bltgAc9Maa	And so is the music.<br>  <br>  Agree with the 2nd answerer.|`|6npsRIzUaa	i think that there's no artistic vision or passion for movies any more, it's all about the money now, baby.|`|Nq4ZlznNaa	yes, some of the films today are retarded... some "comedy" movies are not even funny there just plain dumb... but however I have to say that Dark Knight was the best movie I've ever seen|`|0427afd3b8a595188f3d1223ecf1fb2aaa	Lots of differences now.<br>  <br>  Movies are made for stupid chidren, not   <br>    intelligent adults.<br>  They're full of special effects, not humans.<br>  Actors aren't trained to talk any more and their <br>    accents are awful.<br>  The characters are shallow and unbelievable <br>    far more often than not.<br>  Music is used to brainwash viewers into feeling <br>    what the director can't make them feel.<br>  The plot lines are weird fantasy or ridiculous.<br>  Scripts by too-young writers are not original in <br>    ideas, just full of flashy images.<br>  And many of them look alike, sound alike, etc.<br>  Dialogue lacks ideas.<br>  Everybody tells stories and jumps in the sack <br>    but never talks to anyone.<br>  Graphic depiction has ruined artistry.<br>  And editors cut from one person to another, <br>    ruining the continuity.<br>  <br>  Other than that, I don't like the movies much any more.<br>  Thanks for asking.|`|fEYbc0cTaa	"maybe do you think that film makers don't have much chance to be artistic because movies today usually just rely on making money and the producers are getting in the way of artistic directors."<br>  <br>  i agree with this, but i don't think films are getting worse, you just have to go with the independent films. Anyways, i don't know if hollywood films back in time were better than the ones now, is just that movies, like most things, start gaining say power with time. Also the bad ones get forgotten, and you only remember the good ones from the 50s 60s 70s and compare them with every film released now which obviously are not all good.

Try playing around with flows of known best rappers and from there use them to freestyle about how you live and things you like... Then try battling a few cats in ciphers and open mics... From there you will know which route to go or what kinda rapper or MC you wanna be... NB there is a difference between a rapper and an MC... Just like Super Saian levels... lol..<br>  <br>  <br>  Before I forget.. You also need to write a lot...|`|XxgNEIeuaa	1.

It plugs into a filter which plugs into the phone jack. The filter has a place for your phone to plug in and one for your computer modem chord. That way you can be on line and still get phone calls. For whatever reason every now and then if you have trouble getting on line you can pull out the round plug (power chord) for about 20 to 50 seconds then plug it back in. The lights on the front will come back on. When they are lit and steady (not blinking or flashing) which may take a couple of minutes you should be able to get on line. Got the info from our tech support from our provider. It will only help if the problem is at your end. Let me know if it helps.<br>  Beecher I love your technical talk.

fR2Geezcaa	The guitar is a Gibson custom Jeff Beck rare 1954 Les Paul limited-edition signed, numbered, and played by Jeff Beck himself! British guitarist Jeff Beck made a big name for himself right from the start. After stepping into very big shoes in The Yardbirds as Eric Clapton's replacement, he left to form The Jeff Beck Group with Ron Wood and Rod Stewart in 1967, all before the age of 25. Moving into the 1970s, Beck began forging his reputation as a solo artist—and one of the hottest guitarists of his generation—with a Gibson Les Paul as his leading instrument of choice.<br>  <br>  The banjo is a Gibson made in honor of Earl Scruggs' monumental career achievements. The Binding is Maple with marquetry Hardware: Pure silver and silver-plated hardware Finish: Hand-drawn portrait of Earl by world renowned artist Randall Martin Case: Leather case with humidity gauge.<br>  <br>  I wasn't as thrilled over the banjo but the Les Paul Guitar was a treat to see.

2kpr2arRaa	it's all tied up in Legal Problems<br>  <br>  Season 6 of Project Runway has already wrapped up, but fans are yet to see an episode due to the show’s legal problems. The season’s three finalists recently showed their collections at New York’s Fashion Week, but producers had them show anonymously. The popular series finds itself without a network or a premier date for its latest season, so the finale was missing its usually celebratory air. Producers kept everything secret so as not to spoil the show’s ending for viewers. <br>  <br>  “I’m a little bit sad for our designers, that they don’t get that recognition today,” said host Heidi Klum. The overall mood of the runway show was a downer, according to The New York Times. Reporters were not allowed backstage, and there were obviously no audience favorites, as the finalists remain unknown. Said past winner Christian Siriano, “For the contestants, it’s kind of horrible.” As Heidi Klum has repeatedly told us, in fashion, one week you’re in and the next you’re out. Will fans still be interested by the time the show’s legal troubles are sorted out, or will Heidi & co. be old news by then?
4cf71756f4fb1c71e1725b090a2f6a8baa	Seriously,Simon speaks the truth most times.He's harsh but at least doesn't give bad advice or sugar coat it and I think somehow,it makes the contestants improve on their weak points.I like Randy too.Kara is just useless to the show.Who the hell had that great idea of adding a new judge?Sucks! Let's just stick with the three we know.Paula already drags things enuf for us.Kara is just painful.|`|2ab0f4f84a201bc39a3fb4a1b64db222aa	She's one of my faves. judge.|`|AA10481903	I love her.  She is smarter than Simon, more articulate than any of the other judges, and knows the music business thoroughly.  Plus, she is nice to look at!<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|NIYYN6tpaa	If you lived next to the set like I do here in Hollywood you would really be sick if you saw how they film the people laughing in the audience being filmed separately from when the show is being filmed.......Ah did I ruin it for everybody|`|3nmBkBvOaa	American Idol got so old who watches it anymore?|`|r7bmz65eaa	i don't like her, she always hunches over and swings her head back and forth and her lips stick out too much, and she has flabby arms, and she picks faves. so sick =P|`|1ed613bb747b97b7785ed2c62ec2b592aa	i'm just sick of american idol.period.|`|2T8vRvwMaa	Ahhh...is anyone sick of American Idol? That **** is entertaining, yeah, but no one who wins ever does anything worth while. Kelly Clarkson got famous and sold lots of records but those records suck big time and her latest singles are just plain eye gouging rubbish.|`|VeWaAm3Gaa	I actually kinda like her .|`|CqvatiKoaa	i hate her too! especially went shes like im not seeeing the real u like shes known you since you were born!|`|q71osfkiaa	Na I wanna **** the **** out of her.|`|377247602813a68b3122e2e0c043898aaa	I say keep her and get rid of Randy.   God love him, someones got to....he annoys the crap outta me "dawg"|`|rHHm4XNpaa	She is cool.|`|jv89nkFAaa	i think shes hot!!|`|13x9Tnpxaa	You may hate her you can't change anything. They want four judges and they can do whatever they want. Then why not sit still and listen if she has something good to say, or you can press the mute button when it's her turn to comment, it's no big deal.<br>  Nevertheless, I agree with you. She doesn't make any difference to the show except for an extra judge seat. She seems like an unnecessary 2nd Paula to me.|`|eCszB0MYaa	During the city auditions, I thought, "Hmmm... this might be a good addition."  The key word?  "...thought"<br>  <br>  Now, I could care less for her.  I honestly would want to get rid of everyone except Simon.  Sure, he can be jerky, but at least he gets to the point.<br>  <br>  Back to Kara, she had contrary advice for one of the contestants... When asked what one contestant should do during the wildcard performances, she responded with:<br>  <br>  "You just need to have ridiculous vocals... which you will, unless something...ummm... ridiculous happens."<br>  <br>  H u h ?<br>  <br>  I AM sick of her.|`|5U1sHOC0aa	I am, I think she's probably the reason why the show has lost ratings! She's just trying to be like a girl version of Simon! It's ridiculous.|`|i4QPLfEVaa	I dont like her either. I think this is the worst season of American Idol (talent wise).|`|ANLbWyMeaa	She is getting annoying.  That comment to Taylor about shopping was beyond stupid.  To me, Simon is the only one making sense.|`|Fwh7Ddh5aa	totally.|`|yy8WPgXzaa	neither can i!<br>  i want them to just go back to the 3.

tyTJE8vxaa	They're not overrated at all, that's just something that pretentious idiots with no real knowledge of music say in a lame attempt to appear "controversial" (much like semalnfi down there.). No band before or since has had as much of an impact on popular culture as the beatles did.|`|m5J36D28aa	Rarely does a generation appreciate the music of another.<br>  If you had lived through the time when the Beatles came across the pond and listened to their music while they were together you would have a different opinion of them.|`|fR2Geezcaa	I'm almost afraid to answer because there always seems to be a die hard Beatles fan around when you least expect it. But I actually only like about four of their songs, the rest I tread hearing. I like more of John Lennon's song's, minus Yoko Ono of course, I can't stand her!<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  Die Hard NIRVANA FAN!!!|`|AjdaezeTaa	Honestly I think of The Beatles as the Jonas Brothers of that time<br>  -screaming fan girls<br>  -eh.. some what catchy music<br>  -huge fanbase<br>  -a different sound (voice)<br>  -all in the mainstream<br>  <br>  ...and people say the beatles changed the face of music.<br>  ...I think not!<br>  Honestly without the beatles music still would be here.<br>  Beatles fans truly forget about other genres of music that was created with-out the so-called influence that the beatles brough.and are usually quick to say that the beatles influenced every band after them.|`|87CAVhs2aa	I definitely don't.<br>  I think they deserve all the credit they got. Maybe now they're not anything new (though I still don't think anyone has come close to their unique sounds), but in the 60s, and even 70s, they influenced more music than anyone. They definitely were something new.<br>  <br>  Not to mention their hair. :-)|`|V7lGsaR8aa	Anyone that does not respect the Beatles is a Moron . They have influenced so many of the greats and there legacy is still as strong as ever ."Semalfni" you just show your pure ignorance .|`|YbmklSzGaa	I think you sound even more shallow by saying all music today sucks. I LOVE classic rock, but I still enjoy many new bands. You have to look further than the Top 40 BS.<br>  <br>  BTW, I LOVE The Beatles.|`|GrI8mCJyaa	Everyone with a brain in their head still alive today should at least realize and acknowledge that 'The Beatles', are indeed "overrated". t's plain and simple, you see, a majority of non-self-thinking music-critics (ie,,,the "average Beatles" Fan)  spreads this tripe from peer to peer , and eventually it is believed by anyone who has an ear to hear. I can only wish the remaining 'Beatles' a slow and trechourous death, such as they deserve!!............Death to the lot of them, and their counterparts-(Yes you, you religious fanatical idiodic fans!!!!You!!!)|`|J36FKvkHaa	I've never been a huge fan, but lately I've started listening to them a bit more. I guess I've come to a better appreciation of what they've done for modern music, but I still think they don't always live up to the hype. I feel that they're die-hard fans make them one of the most overrated bands (probably) ever.|`|yQH4Fpoiaa	I love the Beatles, but they are overrated.<br>  <br>  They're overrated because you have a lot of people who just "go with the flow" and say they're the greatest band ever because everyone else says that.<br>  <br>  When something like that happens, you're going to get backlash from others. It's just the way things are.|`|mM7YuOzbaa	Your kind of right in that music today somewhat sucks. At least popular music does. When I turn on the radio what do I hear? Rap music. It is offensive to gays, women and promotes racism. The music of the past is much better on all levels of greatness.|`|3e7KFOXmaa	I don't get your question but hey, for what it's worth here's my two cents. The Beatles are music geniuses and will never be forgotten. There will never be another band like them.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	I think you had to be there to appreciate it more.|`|g6MiGWuJaa	they suck|`|qIpSf64Taa	In some peoples minds,yes they were,but if you put into context what they did,then no they weren't. If,you also think about how they allowed the likes of the Stone's,The Who,etc to flourish,they did write the Stone's first single,and Pete Townsend was extremely influenced by how they recorded their music. They opened up the way for just about every group to do their "own" thing.|`|cK07UqtDaa	I hate people who are close minded about music. If you like a band then so what? Everyone is allowed to like whatever music they like so why waste time saying this band or that band is overated?Just go listen tot he music you love! oh and  I like the Beatles.|`|cYgxTWDVaa	To an extent, yes.<br>  <br>  But that doesn't mean that they already suck or something.|`|EF2d7DfWaa	yeah, i agree. i respect them.. but i just dont like them
2T8vRvwMaa	He is way overrated because he has no dynamics or emotion in his solos. Yeah, Eruption sure is fast and sounds amazing but as if you could listen to 10 minutes of that rubbish. You look at his solos and think, thats awesome, but do you ever listen again? I know I don't. However, I can listen to Angus Young and Hendrix over and over again because they are simply true guitarists with talent.|`|wtQY6VEwaa	when he came out there was nothing like him. as the saying goes, "when eddie van halen hit the scene, most guitarists knew they had to hit the tool shed". thats because he spend about 10 hours a day in his tool shed perfecting what he did (and probably smoking a lot of weed).<br>  <br>  Overrated? I don't know... thats like saying Mozart is over rated at what he did. He was great.<br>  <br>  and im not the biggest Van Halen fan out there. You just have to respect it.|`|Sm67owEFaa	he's good, but he got a lot of publicity and was in the right place at the right time.  a lot of people are just as good and haven't gotten the recognition.  what he did for every project he was a part of is amazing.  but it could be because of his name.|`|8TdPaQrqaa	He's good but he's not the best. I could name dozens of better guitarists. Heres a small list.<br>  <br>  Jari Maenpaa<br>  John Petrucci<br>  Steve Vai<br>  Michael Angelo Batio<br>  Yngwie Malmsteen<br>  Dimebag Darrell<br>  Buckethead<br>  Zakk Wylde|`|AgQForcYaa	...... Well, I agree that EVH is overrated, but SO IS SYNYSTER GATES!!! <br>  <br>  At least EVH has Eruption! What's Synyster got?! SH*T!!! You think Eddie's a one-trick bag?! Synyster's just a sweep picker!!|`|AA11167208	Eddie > van hager.|`|44e6cb721228912026a850cfee71c327aa	Over rated... yes<br>  Good... yes|`|2bVxBCgzaa	I'd like to hear SG attempt to play "I'm The One", or how about "Spanish Fly"- Eddie was the MAN back in the day. You are way off base saying he 'just did a lot of tapping". That's just what he got famous for. Eddie was and is a PHENOMENAL player. I'm not a fan of anything since the first 4 albums, and he's had his day, but at least he HAD his day- Gates is a total hack. I can pull a better solo out of my butt than that poser could ever play.<br>  <br>  Actually, out of curiosity and to be fair, I searched Youtube a few months ago for SG's solos to see what the fuss was about. I watched about 10 different live videos and couldn't believe how bad he is- there are 100 guys in bar bands in every city who blow his doors off.|`|SDp4YSgTaa	I never thought he was over rated as a guitar player but I have always thought of him as an arrogant guitar player.In most of there videos he turns away from the camera so you can't see his fingering techniques.And no one can miss the look on his face.I saw Van Halen at the US festival and they were over paid.One other thing though,Eddies brother Alex is an underated drummer.His drum solo at the US was incredible,and unique.Ever hear a helicopter from the moment it starts up till it hits max RPMS,Alex Van Halen could demonstrate it with his drum kit.|`|WU4MHq3aaa	Synyster Gates?>! <br>  <br>  <br>  WHAT THE FUKC ARE YOU SMOKING AND WHERE CAN I GET SOME?!|`|wA8Dyhq7aa	Certainly he's overrated, but give him a break:  he had to put up with David Lee Roth's ego for all those years.|`|M3Xmqlt8aa	Vanhalen set the standard for everything in rock music since their first album in 78, His ultra high gain amping, tapping, extreme string bending and harmonics really set the stage for much of the music we have today, weather they like it or not many of today's artists use Vanhalen's techniques, many try to avoid to mush hammering so they don't sound like they are copying Ed, but in a lot of other ways they are. If everybody liked the same music what a bore that would be. There are many great guitarists that have been influenced by Vanhalen and it is hard for my to believe many would have been as good without that push that started in 1978.<br>  <br>  Over rated? maybe by some, but he deserves some credit also.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	Overrated? ABSOFUCKINGLUTELY!<br>  <br>  A computer program could play as well- so what's the point<br>  <br>  Eric Clapton (Eddie's mentor) has no use for his music either|`|YwtXSUAdaa	Hahahahahahahaha<br>  <br>  Synyster Gates is better than Eddie Van Halen? Are you kidding?|`|A6PS0jRfaa	yeah he is,there are other guitar players who are better.I met him in 1996 and he was a total arrogant idiot as well.
pwXcD7PIaa	I hear a lot of DJs use it on the road as it saves them lugging 50kgms of records. I personally have never used it but have heard its the choice of the available digital dj packages.<br>  <br>  In Australian dollars I think it's about $800. I've seen it on EBay before.

I really like the tune of the song and still listen to it as if it didn't have such a suggestive message.   <br>  <br>  In a way, i quietly applaud britney for having the intelligence for coming up with such a word pun.<br>  <br>  And, when you think about it, there are TONS of other songs that are as suggestive, if not more suggestive than "if you seek amy" For example, "lollipop" by lil' wayne is all about sucking his dick, and he didnt even bother to put in in a word play like britney did. lol.  And "lollipop" was a hit, and obviously wasn't considered too inappropriate to play on the radio.  I think it is enough that the radio already doesn't play it as much, so I don't think it should be banned.|`|IYNDaQ2taa	I like the song. There's another version "If you see Amy" that you can let your daughter listen to. But I don't really care if it has that. I think that's cool that it has that and believe me she's not thinking of it childishly!<br>  <br>  <br>  ~I Love Robert~|`|k39bNUgeaa	It's a stupid thing people complaining about. It should not be banned. Nothing is bad about it. People just can't go a day without complaining about a celebrity|`|de98ae9f767cca0cbce05bd146ac0d7daa	I think it is a talentless song. I ought to make a stupid song and get rich. Apparently you need no talent to sell a cd these days. Just have some good looks and your in.|`|xM50DXFQaa	Her song isn't the only one!! In The Scripts album, they have a song called "If You See Kay" (F.U.C.K)!!!<br>  <br>  xxx|`|TDGhHIvNaa	Personally I think  it was made into a single because it was going to cause controversy and to get kids to buy her album so they could hear the naughty song.  It isn't really that good of a song, just more techno electronic garbage.  When you read the lyrics it is kind of blatant at what she is saying and  it shouldn't have been made a single in the first place.  And to think this is going to be an oldie one day...|`|hepo1ICcaa	britney is trash. the song is an attempt to stay controversial and in the media and public's conscious. more publicity = more money.|`|quRSZX9xaa	I don't think it should be banned just cause there is a lot worst on the radio!! I will never forget hearing a little boy in the mall singing my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard! haha! He didn't know!  And it's just easier for a parent to lift a finger and turn the radio station then have a bunch of screaming fans mad! BUT i love britney! and the song is STUPID!! I love the music but the lyrics are retarded! She is a mother with children and she is still acting like a rebellious 15 year old girl! I guess she is still stuck in her "I'm not a girl..not yet a woman" stage!lol..I also think grown people singing this song sound stupid! lol It's hilarious to me! I'm not mad I just laugh about it! Because think about it adults are like oh Britney is soo smart I'm singing F-U-C-K me secretly! We're so bad and cool! stupid! haha! Oh no watch out a britney fan is gonna thumbs down me! lol..maybe it was one of those adults I was talking about!! haha!
BlZ6vJOAaa	I have a moon in taurus ... no it doesn't make you a better singer.. people  make fun of me if i even humm anything lol<br>  <br>  but strangely i'm the best vocalist on rockband|`|17b8d68d2416136c4c415502cc901eeaaa	you could be a good singer if:<br>  <br>  1) you practice a lot<br>  2) you are taking voice lessons<br>  3) you get a lot of compliments on your voice<br>  <br>  astrology has nothing to do with it. it's just a gimmick to dupe unsuspecting people who want a quick fix to their problems.|`|lpyWVR2oaa	Moon in Taurus here...<br>  <br>  Those with Sun in Taurus are usually credited with good singing voices as Taurus rules the throat. Moon in Taurus would impart emotional stability and the native would generally be comfortable with the physical body and is rather sensual and sense-oriented i.e. anything to do with the senses such as speaking, listening would provide solace to him/her.<br>  <br>  The ruler of Taurus, Venus, should also preferably make positive aspect to the moon, in order to make the native feel at ease with his/her creative abilities. Ideally, Venus could be found in any of the signs / houses - Libra, Taurus, 5th House

If I'm joking around and they rolled their eyes at me playfully, then no. If they were serious however, I wouldn't get too offended, but I'll say, "You know, you can be a little more respectable."|`|y5FfKGAsaa	Sometimes. It kind of depends on what they're rolling their eyes at. If they're just kidding around about something, I don't mind.<br>  ~|`|bltgAc9Maa	Not always.

TSpH4Ygdaa	gahhh, it's on the tip of my tounge!<br>  I've seen this movie!<br>  I want to say Brighton Beach Memoirs,the movie about a Polish-Jewish family living in New York in the late 30's it has Jonathan Silverman as the youngest son and Blythe Danner as the mom, and as they are sitting down to eat dinner you hear him narrarate "my mom always whispered words like cancer and divorce thinking that if she didn't say them out loud they wouldn't have as bad an effect" or something like that...<br>  I'm ALMOST sure, but not quiet....|`|VeWaAm3Gaa	Hmmmm sounds interesting, when you figure it out let me know :)|`|MpbYCsygaa	I know exactly what movie you're talking about it's called American Pie!|`|zZrKhn9eaa	I'm going out on a limb here, but check this out and see if it looks familiar.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sweet Jane:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130297/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130297/</a>|`|xv7YlV29aa	I don't know<br>  *frowns*<br>  I'm sorry.

UBIlwiALaa	You and your twin need to get on a show like Double Shot of Love (2 in your case)  on MTV, did you see this?  Unlike it though maybe you 2 aren't Bi and can just have men on the show ......??<br>  Anyways good luck on getting on something once you turn 18.  I'd say go on survior but you may shrink to nothing since you hardly ever eat on the show, so that isn't cool.<br>  Edit: to the one below me duh:  the picture shows twins, she said twins (listen and look).|`|AA11640493	You are too young for the Bachelor!  You will have plenty of time and no problem finding a man!!!  You are a cute girl.  You can go on Big Brother or the Real World!  Good Luck!

Do you know you can get a degree in Theater Arts and a minor in dance or music--vocal? Here you get almost a free education (you can take general education courses as well if you want the AA degree. They are fun and interesting too.) and get training in the performing arts. This is a way to get on TV and on stage and get some depth in your personality as well and you meet new people and learn a lot of interesting stuff. (This is the USA I'm referring to. If you are somewhere else see what your community has to offer!)<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!|`|w6czQwhBaa	Katie is a cool name!

They're awsome guys with good morals and were really raised well... =]|`|WyxxDgSeaa	I don't have  a problem with it. It doesn't hurt for them to try to present themselves this way since their fans are mostly very young. On the other hand, it's not a good idea for fans to put so much trust into people they don't know. Try to pay more attention to what your parents teach you. Remember Britney Spears claimed to be a virgin for a very long time...long after she wasn't.|`|Zg1ih6gcaa	I don't care about the Jonas brothers but what I think of people in general who refuse to have intercourse until marriage:<br>  <br>  I think sexual relations should not be had with just anyone or even early on in a relationship but waiting until marriage seems irresponsible.  Sex is an important part of a marriage and it needs to be discussed, thought about and a part of a relationship prior to lifetime commitment.|`|SZZkfVzbaa	I think it's a really great thing to do; I'm defintely waiting until I'm Married.<br>  <br>  However, I'm not going to get a Purity Ring; in my opinion, I don't need a Ring to stay a Virgin; just Faith and Self-Control.<br>  <br>  ?M.|`|vJHkAWlsaa	I think it's an amazing thing they're doing. In fact, I'm about to get a purity ring too myself.<br>  <br>  It's just disturbing when people call them gays // pansies just because they're being pure. I think it's amazing. I love those boys (:|`|nKxQLZr3aa	i think its wonderful, i love the jonas brothers!|`|04fa28a6b99f16ba625a1c29229cd963aa	I mean I'm completely fine with it. I myself am "staying pure" so to speak. I think more people have a problem with the fact that they wear purity rings so it seems like they're "doing it for show." Obviously, you can stay pure without a ring. However, in the end, it shouldn't matter, they're musicians; they should be appreciated for their art.|`|quRSZX9xaa	I think it's great!! My cousin is like a sophomore in high school and most everyone by that age has slept with someone or gone way too far!  I think you should try to do it! It will be great! and it will keep you from dating stupid guys who just think if they do date you they will get laid or something. I saw plenty of girls go through that in high school! Also, sex brings about emotional attachment and responsibility that some teens just can't handle. I mean who wants a pregnancy scare the day before prom! Teen years should be carefree! and staying pure definitely helps you have more fun! Also, think how special it will be when you get married! great feeling!!|`|7ce93d8b143b531df3b5e11c4b0ddc11aa	Go for it, good luck, resist the temptation.<br>  <br>  They seem genuine enough, I believe them, seem like good guys with a good upbringing.<br>  <br>  I hope they follow through with it. I'm not a fan, but I respect them.|`|WDcl8GgOaa	I agree with you...<br>  <br>  it is a beautiful thing to do<br>  <br>  They are not gay or anything just because they are following what God has asked us to do<br>  <br>  Jonas Brothers are such great role models :]<br>  <br>  i love them :]|`|qOrkknxsaa	i think it wonderful that are staying pure. that way it can`t hurt their carrer.|`|Xg8Y3kTZaa	It's great.  I like it.<br>  <br>  Also, to the gay thing: So what if they were gay?

ZyGyDLsDaa	There are alternate endings. In both of the ones I've seen, she's back in the cave, and there's no doubt that, if those creatures are real, she is going to die. Her dream is climbing out of the cave over all of those bones and getting to their vehicle. When it looks as if someone is attacking her in the car, she snaps awake, back in the dark. In one ending I've seen, she's picturing her daughter at her birthday party before the screen goes black.<br>  <br>  However, some have interpreted the whole thing as her descent into madness. They say that SHE killed the others. Given the alternate endings, I suppose this is a possible interpretation.<br>  <br>  I would have liked for the one who got them lost to have known what she was doing. After all, we saw a female who looked nearer to human than to one of them. THAT is creepy: the thought that they would capture people to become part of their tribe. I thought, "Wouldn't it be ultra-creepy if Juno (wasn't she the one who misdirects them?) is one of THEM, and she's bringing people to them?" Only, they apparently killed every female they met, so that destroyed that possibility. It would have been a bit like H.P. Lovecraft stories.<br>  <br>  Maybe it does depend on which version a person sees, especially if it was the original release, which did end slightly upbeat, with her escaping the cave. Wikipedia has this:<br>  <br>  "The Descent" was released in North America with approximately a minute cut from the end. Sarah escapes from the cave and sees Juno, but the film does not cut back to the cave. <br>  In the August 4, 2006, issue of "Entertainment Weekly", it is stated that the ending was trimmed because American viewers didn't like its "uber-hopeless finale". Lionsgate marketing chief Tim Palen said, "It's a visceral ride, and by the time you get to the ending you're drained. Director Neil Marshall had a number of endings in mind when he shot the film, so he was open [to making a switch]." Marshall compared the change to the ending of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", saying, "Just because she gets away, does that make it a happy ending?" <br>  The North American Unrated DVD includes the original ending. Recently, the film has been airing on Canada's The Movie Network, which has the original ending.<br>  <br>  Here's the ending from the Wikipedia summary:<br>  Sarah falls down a hole and is knocked unconscious. Sarah awakens, scrambles up a huge pile of bones towards daylight, squeezes through a narrow opening onto the surface, runs to her vehicle and speeds off. Suddenly, Sarah sees Juno sitting next to her, her face streaked with blood. Sarah screams and awakens to find herself still in the cavern. She sees her smiling daughter close by and a birthday cake between them. The field of view widens to reveal that Sarah is hallucinating. The calls of the crawlers grow louder, but Sarah is oblivious.<br>  <br>  Please note that, in this case, BOTH OF YOU ARE CORRECT, depending on which ending(s) the two of you saw. The ending described on Wikipedia is different than either version I watched on two different movie channels. The endings to this film are a topic of heated debate at various sites.|`|AA10463579	You're right, he's wrong. The movie ended with the lady trapped with those humanoids somewhere above her in higher caves|`|t7OCoFdIaa	Depending on which ending you watch, she either crawls out of the cave or she falls into a pit and is presumably killed by the crawler things. There's nothing to suggest that it didn't actually happen, it's just that she was a bit crazy.|`|NVSvpNLiaa	There's so many interpretations for the ending. I personally think she WAS outside of the cave, but knowing that she left her friend behind, she had to block the entire escape out of her mind, and mentally place herself back inside the cave.|`|niGAKJT4aa	she is driven insane by what she's been through and is hallucinating the whole get away and birthday cake thing.  didn't he see the 'bat people' or whatever they were crawling up the wall towards her?  you win sweetheart.|`|L6U1joGAaa	doesn't it end off with the girl driving in her car and the dead girl shows up next to her all bloody and stuff?

ymrqUOGRaa	I reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally didn't like that prayer as a kid! I guess it's not so creepy now. If you're indeed praying to the Lord, however, I would think it's unnecessary to ask Him to take your soul if you die. You either have a relationship with Him (assuming that's why you're talking with Him in the first place) and it's a give-in that He'll keep you, or you don't have a relationship with Him and then maybe you have to question. It's just a good rhyme, really. My conversations with the Lord nowadays RARELY rhyme and they're much more drawn out than 4 lines.|`|BqHEeYA4aa	well to someone like a kid the words are taken more literally and we only hear key words that we understand like "die" "take" "soul" and it seems kinda creepy. but kids never truly think about the words they hear so i can see why its creepy. but i never used it as a kid...only heard of it when i got older. so it doesnt freak me out. just not my cup of tea coz im not religious|`|YlkotyRsaa	Yeah, it does creep me out. I think it's supposed to be comforting, but if you look at it in a different light.. it IS pretty creepy. I had a poster when I was like seven with this prayer on it... It freaked me out sometimes.|`|LL95bMIlaa	Kind of!<br>  But I said it growing up, and I still say it.<br>  I always thought about that, and it is weird, but if I do die, I want to go to the Lord in heaven.|`|oSGpxFBXaa	yes after Metalica(forgot how to spell it) used in a song|`|YFqRbgd6aa	Not Really,<br>  This guy is creepy!<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ5c4UHYb1Y&" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ5c4UHYb...</a>|`|skMPrGyjaa	never bothered me|`|QdkJYcpFaa	Yeah it kinda does!!!|`|P9HxJ70Waa	i agree the though of not waking up startles me.|`|LxcRAkp4aa	It never bothered me.

Thats like saying "I am dieing tonight....Good night!"|`|77Dk6npVaa	i dont hav an issue with it but i c ur point|`|hKVh1EIcaa	this is a prayer that children and adults have been praying for years as a matter of fact iv'e prayed it myself|`|I1K6SC43aa	I don't want to fall asleep knowing I might never wake up...|`|iz7iVS5Baa	Yeah, the words "Die before I wake" and "Pray the lord my soul to take." definitely send shivers down my spine..<br>  I actually used to have a doll and when you put her hands together she'd recite this|`|bb0487e3f4e58641a40d9c9b91ae1826aa	The last 2 lines are morbid.|`|aVZgY4S8aa	I've been saying it ever since I was a kid.

There are also quite a few CDs out by a group called Streetwize, they take top 40 R&B hits and turn them into nice jazz music.<br>  <br>  As for Acid and/or fusion, try Weather Report, Chick Corea, or Miles Davis "Bitches Brew".|`|nynfdK4baa	eheheh christian music is a rip off of all music forms, but the incredible technical difficulty is too high a wall for any Christians to overcome|`|cL6CWj2waa	Christian and stealing dont mix brother, but hey we all do it, im guilty too<br>  <br>  most of jazz is instrumental, or oldies, there isnt much lyrics in jazz so i dont know where your coming from on this question|`|g4QFDU6paa	Check Angella Christie, Kirk Whalum, Duke Ellington, and there is a cd by Rodney Whitaker and Carl Allen with a nice version of "We Fall Down" on it.|`|a50a13482704e3bd4116e13c4f19066caa	Eric Reed--a very open christian pianist and bandleader.

tuATxHsVaa	edit: Ah... the sheet music. That WAS pretty obvious, eh? Indeed, she was probably asking for the sheet music. Thanks, Schumizst. <br>  <br>  ***<br>  <br>  Camille Saint-Sa?ns wrote this work in 1886 (not 1866). It is from a fourteen movement suite entitled "Carnival of the Animals"<br>  <br>  You often find this work being performed as a way to introduce young people to the instruments of the orchestra, as it features different instruments prominently. <br>  <br>  The movement you are talking about, "Le Cygne", means "The Swan" in English.<br>  <br>  This movement isn't about a dying swan. It's about an elegant swan gently swimming over the water.<br>  <br>  Here is a YouTube link of Yo-Yo Ma performing this piece:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNbXuFBjncw&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNbXuFBjn...</a><br>  <br>  If you would like to purchase a CD of this work, then you can get this one:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Saint-Saens-Carnival-Christopher-van-Kampen/dp/B0000041QC" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Saint-Saens-Carniv...</a><br>  <br>  Or just look for other CDs with "Carnival of the Animals" or "(Le) carnaval des animaux" (the French spelling).<br>  <br>  The movements of the entire work are as follows:<br>  <br>  1. Introduction et marche royale du Lion (Introduction and Royal March of the Lion)<br>  <br>  2. Poules et Coqs (Hens and Roosters)<br>  <br>  3.  Hémiones (animaux véloces) (Wild Mules - Fast Animals)<br>  <br>  4. Tortues (Tortoises)<br>  <br>  5. L'éléphant (The Elephant)<br>  <br>  6. Kangourous (Kangaroos)<br>  <br>  7. Aquarium (Aquarium - Fish Sanctuary)<br>  <br>  8. Personnages à longues oreilles (About Animals with Long Ears)<br>  <br>  9. Le Coucou au fond des bois (The Cuckoo in the Deep Woods)<br>  <br>  10. Volière (Aviary - Bird Sanctuary)<br>  <br>  11. Pianistes (Pianists)<br>  <br>  12. Fossiles (Fossils)<br>  <br>  13. Le Cygne (The Swan)<br>  <br>  14. Finale (The Ending)<br>  <br>  "Le Cygne" was the only movement from the work that was published during the composer's lifetime (useless trivia for you). He thought that this work was not good enough - that it was too juvenile. The suite is probably his most famous and popular work besides the "Danse Macabre" and his 3rd Symphony. <br>  <br>  And by the by, his 3rd Symphony in C minor, Op. 78, "Organ", is a great, great, great, great work.<br>  <br>  Court Violinist<br>  <br>  *|`|qswrz268aa	The court violist is correct in all senses. If its the sheet music you want however, here it is...<br>  <a href="http://imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/8/88/IMSLP02315-Saint-Saens_-_Carnival_of_the_Animals.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/8/...</a><br>  You'll have to go down all the way to page 45 to get it...<br>  <br>  Here also is a score for the cello for the entire work. <br>  <a href="http://imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/f/ff/IMSLP26482-PMLP06099-Saint-Saens_-_Carnival_of_the_Animals__cello-part_a.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/f/...</a><br>  You'll have to go down all the way to the bottom of page 5 to get it...<br>  <br>  Cheerio!

tyTJE8vxaa	Well, it depends....if the dude he's naming the cheesecake after has a manly, virile name likely to inspire fear in the hearts of lesser men/cheesecakes (examples: Bruce, Sterling, Lance) then no, not so much.

H7KEJ0Fjaa	Well, I'm going to be honest. The Jonas Brothers are a hot ticket item and they are very well marketed. They are great role models for children  and they make songs that bridge the gap for teens and tweens. When will it end? When the Jonas brothers grow out of their boy band stage, and Nick and Joe go solo and Kevin joins some random band that's trying to make a name for themselves. Honestly, these boys are squeaky clean and parents love that. Let some naked pictures leak... then we can safely mark the decline of the JBs. Till then, "I'm hot, you're cold, you go around like you know, who I am, but you don't! You got me on my toes!"|`|xAFDN6Iyaa	It'll end when people stop downloading their songs and they hurry up and overload on drugs like there meant to|`|lTXfRYvuaa	Soon I hope!|`|jaKrldSuaa	When one get caught using drugs, having sex, or leaves 2 go solo.|`|hhQURRAoaa	Time will only tell us! =) No other logical answer.|`|IYNDaQ2taa	Soon hopfully.<br>  <br>  I like Joe he should go solo<br>  <br>  ~I Love Robert~|`|de98ae9f767cca0cbce05bd146ac0d7daa	Hopefully soon.

d6f3f16a24596ee000a34bde13aec73caa	He drowned.  <br>  I think somebody messed this riddle up and added the word "swimming'.  <br>  <br>  It should read something like this:<br>  <br>  A man lies dead in a pool  surrounded by scissors. He has no wounds on his body. What happened?<br>  <br>  He used the scissors to pop his water bed, and drowned in the water.<br>  <br>  If it's a swimming pool it's not much of a riddle, you can say he drowned, and that's that.<br>  <br>  Here's the version I am familiar with:<br>  <br>  A woman was found lying dead on her bed, and on the floor, next to the bed, lay a pair of scissors. The scissors were instrumental in her death, yet there was no trace of blood to be found.. Her body shows no evidence of cuts and bruises. How could she have been murdered with the pair of scissors?<br>  <br>  Do you think that could be it, something got lost in translation?|`|39OVFs5Raa	Well, the man could have quite easily have been poisoned and then thrown into the swimming pool!  Now just to confuse the police (like it is confusing us) scissors were placed so as to surround the body!!!.|`|M7lOK6DWaa	I've noticed that in every riddle above someone dies...|`|POqwp3Fiaa	He was poisoned, strangled, suffocated, head kicked in, then drowned...?|`|04e0fa96acbc320b91b66dffc1fa2f97aa	i think he was a diver. some when cut his oxygen tube and did not let him surface up till he die. and left the scissors near the body|`|sXIG4wG9aa	Scissors man died :(|`|bnwP8Kanaa	i cant be bothered to read all of that, lol
fexR7a12aa	yeah ofcourse u can ...u just might not notice|`|sZYbf0hcaa	Depends how you define cry, I suppose.<br>  If to you, crying is just tears then, wouldn't the water stop the tears...<br>  but if it's the air sucking, nose dribbling etc then yes.|`|xztrmON2aa	You can start crying but then after you gotta take a breath in you cant or you'll choke and/or die.|`|uA8c6c4Taa	i would feel like i got a hole in my heart but unfortunately i would not be able to taste the slaty tears...if i ever cried underwater.|`|Rc9SNllPaa	The heart cries anywhere!<br>  Crying is from the heart.<br>  Take care and best wishes always<br>  GOURANGA GOURANGA GOURANGA|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	Yeah, I think so..|`|ycRwO0kWaa	no|`|8sPS24cmaa	i thinkk the waterr would stop the tears comming up.. wouldnt they?|`|Cu6kOvdiaa	ya|`|IYNDaQ2taa	Yes<br>  <br>  <br>  ~I Love Robert~|`|grifjdr0aa	nah, been hitting the questions to ask site, too, eh?|`|5iOHJHUzaa	Actually you can't. I almost drowned when I was a kid and I remember trying to cry under water and couldn't.|`|AA10409668	I'm the wrong person to ask.  ----------------------|`|XU1aTqQ8aa	Swimming with my eyes open always makes me cry. So, I'd say yes.|`|EPki0rwgaa	I think so...I'm not sure if I have ever tried it, though..
vMiX1lL7aa	because round boxes are hard to make|`|ouEix2a2aa	A round pizza box would make it very difficult to get the round pizza out of the box. Even if the box was bigger than the pizza all pizzas are not perfectly round. Also it is very difficult to make a round box. It is much quicker and easier to make a box square rather than round...?|`|Ioc0owmfaa	Good question.<br>  <br>  I would think that square box is easier to stack during delivery. The corners will protect the pizza from the hard knocks of the speeding delivery guys! Who likes their round pizza in other shapes?<br>  <br>  Also, the extra space at the 4 corners will give space for the extra cheese, etc etc. <br>  <br>  And, square box have more printing area than a round one. Its all about packaging strategy.<br>  <br>  Its Hip to be Square!!|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Square boxes are easier to make.|`|8d03fcb2a7fe3a4e9c78ebd702581c44aa	its all about optimization|`|kTxeGj1aaa	Why is lemon juice made with artificial flavor and dishwashing liquid made with real lemons?<br>  <br>  <br>  Have a nice day! :)|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	I think its more convenient to make square boxes.. <br>  Round ones would be freakin sweet though..|`|8sMuQa7haa	So they can charge extra somehow?|`|ycRwO0kWaa	wow i like this question<br>  go and ask the pizza man|`|rMmVuHEhaa	Good question?<br>  <br>  I should say Question of the day....|`|fexR7a12aa	yeah it shdu be a square pizza in a round box|`|8sPS24cmaa	circle boxes would be more complicated to fold and make|`|eCszB0MYaa	My opinion is that it's much cheaper to make a square box than a round one.  Also, how would a cover for a round pizza box work out?  <br>  <br>  Check out my source for a site that explores this very question.  Funny responses!|`|899c6a371bce238646502edb0cee925aaa	Ever tried to make a square pizza by tossing the dough in the air like the Italians do it?<br>  How about a round box by folding a single piece of cardboard?<br>  <br>  That's what I thought...<br>  ; )|`|cl1p2pQwaa	a square box is easier to make and assemble.. a round box would have to have a lid, it'd be a bit weird..<br>  <br>  and a lot of pizzas are square too, depending on where you get them from|`|cVPIH22kaa	because the shape of the box makes the pizza look even yummier and scrumptious to eat.|`|GOc5N22Oaa	They have square pizza too so they son't want to waste their time making 2 types of boxes. Just put it all in one box.|`|xztrmON2aa	Maybe they tried making round boxes but found it hard to do.|`|ukRpBJ6Daa	idk<br>  <br>  interesting<br>  <br>  :D|`|904b98e3003123549fac56c6334846a5aa	So the drivers can't use them as Frissbees|`|aoGrjp8zaa	Why do people drive on parkways<br>  <br>  why do people park on driveways?|`|em8yN4Ceaa	because it's easier to make a square box|`|OKZkABDqaa	square boxes are cooler than round ones, DUH!! :D|`|ZPt5H9Euaa	cuz its easier to handle and circle objects need more space to to be adjusted|`|xuR8YkQlaa	hmm who knows lol|`|2p55hLjYaa	i never really thought bout that..<br>  good question..|`|IYNDaQ2taa	Square is easier to make and easier to hold<br>  <br>  <br>  ~ I Love Robert~|`|XU1aTqQ8aa	Because God made them that way, and who are we to question the work of the Creator?

Loudly and constantly; this morning for about an hour and a half after he came in LATE.  He has to "share" EVERYTHING including what he had for dinner last night and whether his mother could hold it when she was in his car.  But the most unintended humor comes from his inspirational calendar.  It must have half a dozen entries per day.  This morning there was a story about an owl.  The longer the owl sat, the quieter he got.  The quieter he got, the more he heard.  "Why can't we be like this?"<br>  <br>  This was read by a guy who had not yet done a lick of work in over an hour since he had shown up late but jabbered away as if he were the most important thing in the world, and I'm sure the irony was lost on him.|`|Jnv47zQgaa	me and my friend were walking to class, and she smaked a boy on the **** who she thought was a friend but it turned out to be the new maths teacher... and i laughed soo hard, that i fell to the floor then i hit my head and laughed harder... <br>  <br>  scary.. i think i had too much sugar today|`|qhU3PDgfaa	i farted..and i put the blame on my mom....lmao..<br>  im not kidding.. this reallly happened... <br>  and well..my momz face..((after i said that))...was the funniest... <br>  and it made me laugh immediately..|`|4suKn91qaa	A joke about the teachers.

V7lGsaR8aa	How can you not like anything by the Beatles , they are icons who the like of we will never been seen again . It's a testimony in itself that there popularity has never waned even after all this time . Everything they did had meaning and it's a great tribute that even the young audiences of today still hold them in the esteem to which they deserve . I am English and more of a Stones man but the Beatles will always hold the Mantel of the greatest contributers to the music industry . And i loved the Magical Mystery Tour for all the above reasons .|`|DNkavhfBaa	IT WAS PANNED BECAUSE THEY MADE A MOVIE.PAUL MCARTNEY SAID LETS GET A BUS,GO ON A TOUR AND FILM WHAT HAPPENS,.UNFORTUNATLY NOTHING HAPPENED .BUT REALLY THE FILM GOT PANNED MORE THAN THE MUSIC.ALSO "I AM THE WALRUS"IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ROCK SONGS OF ALL TIME.BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.LOVE THE ALBUM  (ITS THE FRIGGN BEATLES)to chhh below me:sgt pepper was far more a comming of age album than mmt.it was also released a year earlier|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	The EP wasn't one of their highlights for me, 'Flying', Blue Jay Way' and 'Your Mother Should Know' are just filler.  As for the movie, it's a great period piece but it's easy to understand why people hated it, it really does look like a home movie!|`|2bVxBCgzaa	It's actually my favorite Beatles album- I think it's brilliant.|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Of course!

The LP, Disc, whatever, is essential listening.|`|1o05hQ1Uaa	It's not my favorite but I indeed like the Magical Mystery Tour.  I love the song "Penny Lane" and "Hello Goodbye".  It was a sort of coming-of-age phase for the Beatles, something different.  The Magical Mystery Tour had a bit of a different sound and stirred up some amusing rumors, i.e. Paul being dead.|`|46e2a496285e8eb37e4ada2aac6111b8aa	Great songs, rubbish movie.

147b4a346dd471babe83771bba6a0923aa	Hi, (((Dizz)))!<br>  Trolls. AKA Trusted Reporters. (See yapoo's unpaid lackeys.)<br>  Apparently they are on another witch hunt for the 'good of the site'.<br>  They organize these things. <br>  Sometimes you can spot one coming if you spend time on Forum.<br>  (Y!A Suggestion Board)<br>  First clue: Formal announcement of a coming "site closure" for<br>  'maintenance' and.or 'improvements'. <br>  Clever "code", no? <br>  Other times, they "organize" on their own and roam in packs.  <br>  Sorry, Dizz. It's happened to most of us. <br>  I lost 9 closed (over a year!) in one night, and 8 in another, <br>  also closed over a year.<br>  Bree lost 29 or 31 -(I can't remember right now!) in one night<br>  It's a lousy, evil practice. }:>|`|ctYCzvG1aa	Hi My Lovely Sister ??D?? -- Waaay Up North & West,<br>  <br>  You know how that began happening to me, & everyone just said leave it alone.  Well, I kept writing asking Yahoo why they deleted my questions, & answers when there was absolutely nothing in them that broke one term or guideline.  At 1st they just kept sending back their usual "form" responses, but I finally had enough & demanded more of an answer than that.  & Honey, you know I don't hold back in any of my answers especially in the Political section!<br>  <br>  I haven't had any trouble since.  Also since I took all the steps to rid myself of those idiots a few weeks ago, fingers-crossed, I haven't had any trouble.  But, if it begins again, I'll take care of them myself as I did the other ones, thru the Federal Government, & my own channels!<br>  <br>  BTW!  Are there allowed to be 2-Users on here w/the User Name "Dizz?"  I didn't think that was allowed, but I saw one on the "Political" section that had some way-out comments supporting Obama.  They even freaked me out, which is kinda hard to do...lol!  Very radical!  If this wasn't you, then this could be what has drawn this troll/wrath to you.  I've got the User info if it wasn't you & you would like it!  D:)<br>  <br>  ((HUGS!)) xoxoxoxoxo<br>  Love Ya' Sweet Ums'!  May ALL of My Special Family on Y!A have a WONDERFUL Weekend!!

Please, be careful about who you have at your fans' list, especially people that you don't know, and that added you recently. Remove anyone you feel you can't trust (to remove people from your fans' list, you need to block, then unblock (if you wish) them).<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!!

Truth is, we could all guess at who reported your questions and it wouldn't change anything. <br>  <br>  Here are some facts for you...<br>  You can set your questions and answers to private, but it doesn't really protect you at all. People still see your questions on the main pages, on the resolved questions and can google you and your questions. <br>  Blocking someone is now just as useless. People can go around the blocks in a few different ways. It has been done.<br>  You can start looking at all of your contacts and fans and thinking about who reported you, but all that is going to accomplish is a lot of suspicions, hurt feelings and lost friends. <br>  You CAN be a little more picky about who you take as a contact or fan. It does help, to an extent.<br>  Yahoo's coffee breaks and ANY time down is a very good indication that violations and suspensions are due. <br>  If you find you have a troll or stalker.. changing your avatar and name will do nothing. They already have your account ID and will find you again without a problem.<br>  If somebody wants you gone, you will be gone. <br>  I had 29 violations in less than a half hour. My suspension came right after. My second account got the same treatment... after a certain account destroying person sent me an email. You KNOW this is why I left for better places. <br>  Last...it's just a game. Yahoo can deny it all they want, but....it's just a game with fair players, cheaters, trolls, stalkers and all the other characters that keep it going.<br>  If you get suspended, delete your account and give them one less account as a statistic.  :)<br>  For now, make sure you have ways to find your contacts and friends again, if you or they get suspended. Don't put that off. <br>  <br>  (((HUGS))) for you, Dizz.|`|SOGkJSN4aa	Yea thats happened to me before.<br>  Someone probably reported your question which made it get deleted.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	apparently it's been an ongoing problem tonight.

r4ar5lekaa	I sometimes think of stuff like this, especially with horror movies and how it would be so scary if so and so happened. haha. I've loved zombie horror movies for years too, such as Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, and Return of the Living Dead. At times I've wondered what it would be like if the undead were roaming around, and some chemical or whatever brought dead people back to life as flesh eating zombies. haha. But yeah, that won't be happening anytime soon, thank God.<br>  <br>  And the same goes for 28 Days Later. That's a good movie by the way. I think the one person made a good point how we might do better than some people might expect, since a lot of people have seen these kinds of horror movies. haha. I'm sure it would be terrifying either way, if it was actually possible. You said it sounds stupid, but I don't think it does. Only maybe if you are convinced it COULD happen. haha. That might be a little ridiculous.<br>  <br>  Oh, one person said something about the US version having rednecks and black people. What, no blacks or rednecks live in the UK? haha. ;)|`|HK4cW2Vcaa	well, with all the movies we have watched on crazy **** like that, I think we would do a little better than perhaps you would expect.|`|DnaoGsiDaa	Love that movie - I think America would do what America does best and bomb everything. It would be a Quarantine type situation. Ick I don't ever want to imagine that happening.. The second sequel is coming out! Woot woot|`|P2ZADnRMaa	the same thing that happened in the movie (which is based in england) except add some rednecks...and black people.<br>  <br>  hahaha.<br>  i would watch that version if it were a movie.|`|1g8uChdyaa	Obama would do a backflip, Paris Hilton would be like omg and George Bush would probably go to Guantanamo Bay and eat a c0ck-meat sandwich.

ZyGyDLsDaa	I Walked With a Zombie~Who would guess what a wonderful, eerie, hauntingly beautiful movie this is?! Producer Val Lewton was forced to use this title, and the heroine makes light of it in the opening narration.<br>  <br>  Pumpkinhead~I had a terrible time getting people to watch this movie because they couldn't believe a movie with that title could be good. When they finally gave in and watched it, they apologized. For most, it's one of their favorite horror films. <br>  <br>  Dead Birds~Again, this is a tough one to get people to watch because it's a title that doesn't communicate much, especially about  the horrific images you are going to see.<br>  <br>  4 Flies on Grey Velvet aka The Four Velvet Flies~This is one of Dario Argento's horrific thrillers that must be viewed to understand the title's significance. However, the average person might pass on watching this film because of the odd name.|`|DQlZIzAFaa	Troll 2<br>  <br>  It's not about trolls at all, it's about goblins, and it's not even by the people who made the first Troll movie.

Lol.|`|NQ239NgAaa	yes many times i always sleep in same bed as my friends its either that or i sleep on the floor|`|C3yE261uaa	alot with my sister|`|38d6d7d6011bdd646925e15a23ec4590aa	yup many times .. yup good old sleep over|`|SohrsIBoaa	after finals one year all my friends cam eback to my place and slept in my bed. its a king. and there was me and 3 other guys and 5 girls. i mean.. nothing sexual happened but i have slept in the bed with other men i guess you could say.|`|IUXriZQJaa	That was the status quo up until the 1900s.<br>  <br>  Even rival politicians had to sleep in the same bed if there were not enough rooms in the inn.<br>  <br>  Abraham Lincoln was a well-noted example of this, though radical revisionists try to say there was hanky-panky going on when there wasn't.<br>  <br>  When I used to go to conferences in college, we would sleep four guys in a king sized bed, and whoever snored got the bathtub. Once we stuffed 50 into a standard-sized hotel room and had a heck of a time explaining to the room attendants why we kept asking for soap and towels.<br>  <br>  Now with the 'mainstreaming' of homosexual issues, you just get paranoid in that kind of situation anymore. Nothing is the same anymore. When the unthinkable is shoved in our faces every day by the media, it forces a lot of mixed feelings about anything that could be misconstrued as something it isn't.<br>  <br>  Lincoln would roll over in his grave if he ever heard what is being said of him, and if he had seen that racist ./ socialist / terrorist sympathizer giving a presidential speech at his memorial.|`|fWbuYL08aa	with my dad..and cousins ..|`|C6ZJcNJjaa	Yes.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Yeah.

Many, many times.|`|uZ8bOXTqaa	yeah i do all the time. if i decide to crash at my friends house ill usually sleep with her in her bed.|`|P93I8CHtaa	sure did,my brother =/|`|y1wS0MYGaa	yeah.  my bestie even gives me backrubs & stuff when she spends the night. :)|`|XxVTw5U3aa	yah alot<br>  i like doing that....<br>  ive also made out with the same sex!<br>  its really fun|`|xAT6UVl2aa	i have, many times... (almost kissed my friend XD by accident woke up and was a little to close...)|`|XEGG1l6Raa	yeah...... with my best friend....<br>  <br>  in a hotel in Vegas...hmm that didn't sound right....<br>  but i know what you mean. ^_-|`|xCfub799aa	Yes, definitely.<br>  <br>  School camps at an all boys school! Oh!|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Of course. If I'm sleeping over someone's house and I can either choose the floor or the bed, you better believe I'm choosing the bed. We always share. If it's a twin bed, two of us are going to sleep in it. If it's larger, three of us will sleep in it. It's solely for comfort, I simply hate sleeping on the floor.|`|bgE2gRwSaa	Of course I have.|`|ef831d986a5932fbeb4aaba747db2c77aa	Yes. Been there.<br>  When we had a hotel room for our band to stay, I opted for the bed. I didn't care who else was in it. So tired at the end of the night I could have cared less.|`|twtWD7glaa	Of course I have. I was a little kid at one point. ._. Lately I only sleep in the same bed as my male friends, and my female friends sleep elsewhere if we happen to all be crashin at the same place. *shrug*|`|RpxKmUBUaa	Yeah, because I am confortable in my sexuality, and know that girls certainly do not get me randy....That's what my bf does:)|`|sw7kRBSYaa	yeh|`|ehMPOlefaa	only when i was a kid and had to do this with my brother|`|nooi0ldjaa	yeah, but like you said, it was that or in a chair.|`|gSIGZmq8aa	yeah, o fcourse! Thats not weird for girls to do at all.|`|riMj9CWjaa	yes, with my friend at a slumber party - in a non - sexual way, this was like when i was 10!<br>  <br>  =]|`|fa4ad75b1bf281a638ed98e3dee7c7f8aa	My sister, lol.|`|4d2a746b2c406b888ee53ccce2cd95e0aa	yea..... and one time the other guy was all freaked about it and when we woke up i was like towards him and he thought i did something to him... no i did not....|`|wlP7AfdEaa	Yes i have, when my friends stay over, im not going to make them sleep on the floor.       :]|`|8n3NvYQwaa	yes when we went on our senior class trip to washington, dc three of us slept in the same bed.....  I did not like it cause the guy in the middle snored something awful........     Grant M|`|6380221dbceb0381d89b54bd786e9f42aa	Yeah, brother and cousins, but we were about 6 years old...|`|5mIhU9KAaa	i've done the exact same thing. it's not weird at all because as far as i know none of my friends are gay..
33462b45e7f5e8fa0d2c9a98b11323c9aa	It's all created drama, I don't care what they try to  feed the public.  I cannot believe they would crush anyone in front of millions of viewers with a very NOT popular event.....unrehearsed.   News reports state that Melissa knew what was coming before that final show -- maybe she did, but it still doesn't make it okay for Jerky Jason to have been that ignorant that he didn't have it figured out at the final rose ceremony. You're right,... he must be on crack. <br>  And Molly......... she's a real card.  <br>  I just wonder how much they all were paid to put on this charade.|`|AA11791312	When he gave Jillian the boot, the show was pretty much over, as far as my staying with it went. There was something just a little too "Stepford Wifey" about Stephanie, but Jillian just seemed like the perfect match. Oh, well..HIS loss.|`|EDXh0tk9aa	I think Melissa had a great on-camera personality and she was sincere. I felt Molly was more reserved. I think Jason was attracted to Melissa's personality, but not really in love with her, by his reaction of sending Molly away.  He could be fickle. He could have needed time to really step back and figure things out, but ABC doesn't give that kind of time.  I did hear a rumor that ABC made him pick Melissa. But as to whether or not it's true, I can't say.|`|UBIlwiALaa	Don't really know if he did or not,  let me start by saying I liked them both....but to make a decision like he did then flip within 6 weeks.  He just gave up on Melissa and left her cold without even working out anything.  I think it would've been funny once he dumped Melissa and  had Molly came out and said she moved on. That would've left Jason with no one and I kinda think that is what he deserved for his actions.  Saw the one with Charlie O. and when came time to make a decision he told them (ABC) that he needed more time to decide, this is what Jason should've done instead of screwing these people up!!|`|gqbkUF5Zaa	Every reality tv show is fake fake fake.

ANLbWyMeaa	I have it, though I'm in my late 20's.  I got it from a friend.  My teenaged sister and most of her friends have it.  I don't hear it as loudly as younger people; the kids are slightly annoyed with the sound.  <br>  <br>  A guy put it over an intercom at work, and it was crazy how all the younger people were looking everywhere, while the older people (30's on up) had no sign of hearing or noticing anything.<br>  <br>  It was more of a thing to have, I don't think any of us actually USE it as a ringtone.  I've heard it was developed so kids could hear their phones ring in class while their teachers couldn't.  Makes sense.|`|1vaqtRI2aa	I've never heard of that- I'm 17 word about crap like that travels fast.<br>  Guess it's only popular where you live?<br>  <br>  Pretty interesting though.|`|NAy7lfxkaa	the teachers hear it pretty well :]|`|IVN49C1vaa	its kinda overrated<br>  <br>  x|`|OKZkABDqaa	i have that ringtone but i never use it. it gets really annoying|`|vmlArXqAaa	that was like...middle school.|`|eZCCSMykaa	ah so horny i luv u long time|`|tmwOwc0Laa	yea...fcking annoying rigntone... and some older people can hear it... just depends how damaged someones ears are|`|XxVTw5U3aa	nobody that i know has it.....they text in class without it.....|`|riMj9CWjaa	a lot of my friends have it<br>  <br>  it's funny coz some adults can hear it and some cant.

ulYTAfXtaa	ya know, back when i was taking theater class in middle school everyone would always say to me "brianne go sing the solo" and i'd be like "wtf why" and they'd be like "you look like a great singer". i never got why they thought that. <br>  <br>  my friends and i would even sing in funny fake voices, and people would overhear us, and they still thought i would be a good singer if i sang in a real, natural voice.<br>  <br>  then i had a friend of mine say to me when i told him i wish i could sing nice, "well you have a very unique speaking voice, i mean look at the chick from flyleaf--your voice is just a tad deeper than hers and look at how high pitched her singing comes out. try it, i doubt she was all 'Laaaa!' perfectly at first. you never know what you might have." i am so eternally grateful for him saying that, because now, about 10 months down the road, i actually have a very good singing voice (not trying to be egotistical there :/) hahaha. <br>  <br>  basically hun, there's no way of really KNOWING whether you sing or not until you give it a go, but what's it gonna hurt? if you really want to sing, try it. keep practicing. i don't know what your beliefs are, but maybe this is a way that "someone" up there is trying to tell you to try it. ;)|`|fIEmi84Laa	You can't always tell if someone is a good singer by listening, but I'm sure sometimes you can. Unless someone has like a speech problem. If a untrained person has a nice pleasant sound, they're most likely to naturally have a nicer voice than someone who has an untrained ugly voice. But someone's singing voice can really differ sometimes from their normal everyday speaking voice.|`|NbkYGaNlaa	haha i think what you should do is go to the mall and stand in a group of people and start singing and if they all walk away your not good and if they stay you are?  sorry not exactly what you asked but try it!
NrOuDXW4aa	Humans tend to see any creature that kills humans as evil.  The most reasonable scenario is that the aliens just see humans as a food source.  The only really evil creatures in the series are the people especially in Alien Resurrection where essentailly the only decent human was Ripley.|`|rgPmkqwXaa	The most logical explanation is that we humans project our own fears and aggression on those aliens......and we don't even have the slightest proof of their existence, and even if they did exist, the chances of them landing on our little planet our quite remote given the vastness of the universe.....|`|5yRXddE8aa	i don't know if they are all evil, but how come they only ever abduct americans?|`|4n6iXf13aa	Only the little green ones......|`|uo1yX1v0aa	In the first movie there is no actual Alien until after the chest buster scene with Kane.  What he found was a place filled with eggs containing the Face-huggers.  So in my opinion it all unfolded into a self preservation scenario where the Alens were given the opportunity to grow and expand their race.  <br>  <br>  If Humans were in the same predicament then we would probably do exactly the same thing.   Only we would be a lot more vindictive and cruel with it.   It seems what the Aliens do makes them seem like "braindead killing machines"  but it is how they survive as a species. To them we are a host, an animal for their use.  They think of us about as lovingly and deeply as a majority of us humans think about our animals.  <br>  <br>  The only question about the Aliens I have is "What do they eat to survive?  Ridley Scott is a genious but never gave us this answer.<br>  <br>  But then this is only my opinion.|`|2g8m8USQaa	Evil? No. Predatory? Absolutely.

Although most people don't realize it, Scream was actually supposed to be a semi-spoof on the horror genre (and then they made Scary Movie to spoof that?) and it worked great.  It had just the right balance of comedy and humor to make it a great movie.  The second one was well thought out because it had to be done well so it could tie the first into the third.<br>  <br>  My only problem with any of the trilogy was that Sarah Michelle Gellar was one of the first billed on the movie, but she actually didn't play much of a part in it.  She died early on, but they put her name on the first bill because they knew it would help sell the movie.  Other than that, I liked the entire trilogy.  I own it on DVD and watch it every now and then.<br>  <br>  This of course, is an opinionated question and answer, so there really is no right or wrong answer.|`|bb3de3ca6513172530fef5133f6bc55caa	I enjoyed them. The first is what I would consider a classic, even though everybody loves to make fun of it. It has been the basis for dozens of spinoffs and while it may not be that scary anymore, it's still a fun movie to watch every once in awhile. As for Scream 2, the movie was not so great, but I still give it some credit for the awesome death scene in the beginning with Jada Pinkett Smith. Scream 3 I actually enjoyed the most of the trilogy, just because the characters are funny and the detective is really cute!|`|fa95a107c51b407e83a3e95fe81a0e10aa	I actually really liked the trilogy.  The first time I saw number scared the crap out of me.

icmKd001aa	R = Definitivamente, o gato cairá de pé. Afinal, o processo da queda provoca uma diminui??o da massa gravitacional do gato e ele tem a sensa??o de fome, conseqüentemente ele aproveitará o p?o com manteiga amarrado em suas costas para saciar essa já citada fome. Como os gatos s?o animais muito ariscos, eles conseguem comer o p?o a tempo de que, quando termina a queda, eles já tenham terminado de comer e ficam de pé.<br>  <br>  Gato malandro<br>  <br>  Um gato estava ca?ando um rato. Depois de muita correria, o rato se esconde em sua toca e escuta um latido: <br>  - Au! Au!

Tell the police.Please keep safe and stay away from dirty old men before you wind up a statistic.|`|uly3aFqtaa	It is only Sexual Harassment if you have told him clearly to STOP.<br>  <br>  You can't just stop chatting to him and expect him to pick up that you don't like it anymore.<br>  <br>  ?M.|`|Buqk6aTgaa	yeah that is definitely sexual harrassment. But unfortunately to tell you the truth, there isn't a lot the cops can do about it. They say they will, but nothing usually happens. Try telling how him you feel. Let him know what he is doing is wrong and you don't appreciate it. If it still continues, go to the cops asap.|`|5xueRvGtaa	First id go to your pastor with it. Tell him becouse if there is someone like that within the house of god its unhealthy. Then i would go to a police station and they will have you write a report. Tell him to leave you alone. The police will prob tell him to stay away if he doesnt, go back and request a restraining order. God Bless|`|iPje1iyGaa	If I were in your shoes, I would go to the police because this is definitely a case of sexual harassment.  Bring all your e-mails and conversations and share all things said and how it makes you feel.  It may be grounds enough to get a restraining order.|`|TMk46Pfcaa	Police station???? People still say that....lol. Yeah you got to see them because you have a stalker, and he might try to get your information from someone at church. Turn him in before it's too late.|`|VN3R0I5Oaa	Yes go now if u feel insecure AT ALL dont hesitat ur safety is the number one priority for urself and dont let be abused obviously hes a freak and not replying to him is good but lose contact with him ie block from MSN and if anything happens at church just let people kno|`|KIZVWREHaa	well where you told him you would did sexual things to him and talked to him on msn i think they might think that you are crazy but maybe not go . Won't hurt none .|`|HQgS2P4Baa	yes go <br>  if your feel sexually unconfortable it is harrassment<br>  no one should make you feel that way|`|eHjbv241aa	just tell him that you are not interested and you do not want to receive mails like this. He will stop.why wasting time over such trivial issue?|`|lQaRKIOOaa	well  police  help should be last option<br>  <br>  you threaten him by saying u will go to police|`|bm5LCQLPaa	sry i didn't read everything but from what i see u should go to the police|`|Ffcmfzt8aa	HES A PERV...GO 4 IT!|`|NQ239NgAaa	yes if u have any doubts go to police|`|lSvUIKsDaa	I don't know, it doesn't really sound like you've been telling him to back off. If he's socially inept enough to not realize you're not into what's going on, you have to firmly tell him you are 100% not interested.<br>  <br>  But if you have repeatedly made it clear you want nothing to do with him, and he persists, then go ahead and get a restraining order. If it was just an internet stalker, it wouldn't be that big of a deal, but you know him in real life, which could present a danger for you.|`|zupJYkngaa	If you feel very uncomfortable with the situation, you should tell the police. <br>  I agree with your friend, you should tell the police because if you wait the situation will get out of hand. The next thing you know, he's going to try and find your address and he might be out at your window and start singing for you!<br>  Who knows? He might do something bad. Just please, tell the police!? =(
U4UgkpJoaa	probably because you see their mouths moving without any sound coming out of them together with their body language,you can just guess what they are saying,whether its funny or not! : )plus its like watching a silent movie.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	It's because of what we see.

I reckon the spoken word and instruments could have done with a bit more layering - To make the track more eery and haunting and capture the mood. Possibly more 'Promised Land-esque'. That would have also allowed Geoff to get away with focusing on his lower register while still sounding great. <br>  <br>  None the less, a HUGE improvement on the last few releases. Great to see the guys getting back to their roots and re-introducing the guitar solo. Rock on Whip!!<br>  <br>  Definitely looking forward to hearing the rest of the record.<br>  Ryche and Roll!

uyQppMYLaa	I prefer Pantera. They were never mainstream, and if this makes me sound like a musical snob then I'm sorry. Dimebag was a legendary guitarist, Phil has one of the most influential voices in metal (just listen to the stream of metal bands who imitate him) and they were very diverse lyrically. Metallica do have some great songs, but Pantera have more.<br>  <br>  I would never have said that Dimebag was underrated - every true metalhead has heard of him, and he regularly topped the "best guitarist" polls in magazines. But he was a genius. He is sorely missed.|`|AgQForcYaa	Metallica. <br>  <br>  A long streak of bad albums doesn't make a band worse than having an overrated guitarist, horrible vocals/lyrics, and attempting to sound "badass."<br>  <br>  I'm probably gonna get the most TD's for *gasp!* dissing Dimebag?! Who would dare do such a thing?!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh, please, Dimebag underrated?! You have to be shitting me. I dare you to go on a Youtube video with Pantera on it, and NOT find a single comment on the first page that says "RIP DIMEBAG!"<br>  <br>  And I have heard more songs than Walk and Cowboys From Hell, Pantera just doesn't click with me. (obviously)|`|U23DRFtbaa	Mettalica,i like Enter The Sandman song<br>  <br>  but,i like Pantera too...cause A7X,my favorite band like they too|`|J36FKvkHaa	Old-school Metallica.<br>  <br>  But may Dimebag RIP.|`|EF2d7DfWaa	Metallica|`|SeVyIfQ6aa	Metallica, hands down|`|pyXn05dHaa	metallica.<br>  <br>  Their first 5 albums are the greatest metal albums ever.<br>  <br>  Disagree if you will but that's how i feel.|`|4n6iXf13aa	Pantera........ They never sold out, besides Lars is a little *****.......|`|sNKxpMN0aa	Metallica. <br>  <br>  Dimebag was overrated. He could write some good riffs and relied on them too heavily throughout the song (except for Cemetary Gates, that song is a masterpiece). Pantera was also greatly influenced by metallica.|`|tpE0pWSfaa	Mettalica is way better. Easily.<br>  <br>  1. there songs are longer<br>  2. there music is better<br>  3. better singer<br>  <br>  well ... thats my oppinion anyway.Slipknot is better then both !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =P|`|sGwMKlswaa	X=X=X=X=X=X=X=X=X=X=X=METALLICIA=X=X=X=X...|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Metallica by far.<br>  Pantera has never put out anything as good as Metallicas first 5 albums. And the last time I checked becoming popular did not mean you had sold out.<br>  <br>  I have respect for Pantera but IMO Metallicas songs are far more complex and James sounds better the Phil again IMO.<br>  <br>  And PS No way is Dimebag underrated.|`|05aKFYl5aa	metallica's better|`|AA11353245	I prefer Metallica, they may have sold out and turned to crap in the last two decades (albeit their alumni have made quite good metal in that time) I prefer their more melodic approach to thrash metal.  This of course is up to and including parts of The Black Album.<br>  <br>  This is not to discount Pantera as they were, in my opinion, more influential on the modern metal scene than Metallica, but I simply don't enjoy their specific brand of thrash as much.<br>  <br>  Also I blame Pantera for Lamb of God and their ilk.|`|OLCoFKQraa	definitely Pantera, mainly because I'm more likely to listen to Pantera than Metallica, I dunno, I listen to Metallica when I'm in the mood for oldies, still, you won't catch me saying that Master of Puppets is not a masterpiece that will be appreciated by many when you and I are dead and gone... probably not st. anger though.|`|bb0487e3f4e58641a40d9c9b91ae1826aa	I have to say Metallica because like you said, I don't knew enough of Pantera's songs, sadly.  I say sadly because the songs I am familiar with are as good as anything released by Metallica, esp Avoid The Light.  I love that song!|`|5dMw30kMaa	I like Metallica. I didn't think they had a streak of bad albums. But I guess everyones taste is different :P But I think slayer owns both. hahaha

I would suggest don't use limewire because its just all about porn when you download things. Isohunt has new releases, old movies, tv shows, programs, pictures, clips, and the list goes on and on. In order to use isohunt, you have to download utorrent, but its very simple. It tells you the title, the size, how common it is being used, and if theres anything potentially dangerous about it. If you do use this program, when a movie is finished downloading, dont delete it right away because the way it works is that when someone downloads something, the next person that wants it is downloading it from you, so if you delete it, they cant get it, so please be nice and let it sit on there for a couple of days or so...email me back if it worked or not...guslover2389@yahoo.com or guslover2389@hotmail.com

Z5mmaFK0aa	Absolutely hands down. I am mostly extremely Bias toward RAP music that promotes Gang activity and violence, Drugs and Drug Dealing, Prostitutes, Gang politics and all that East Coast - West Coast Bullsh**. I mean look at all the early Death Row records material Suge Knight and Dr Dre, All the early Snoop Dog crap. Murder, Drugs, Sex, Violence and not just moderately I mean extreme lyrics.<br>  <br>  people need to look at this crap before slamming on Cannibal Corpse I mean I think that crap is sick too but at least you cant understand a word they are friggin saying.<br>  <br>  Tool, is another band. All the Christian Hate rants, F this F that, F the Junkies, F The Christians, F the people that ware Hair Pieces. I cant stand the Tool hate rants I mean and you can understand every single friggin word that maynard is saying. It gets old. Thats one of the main reasons I don't listen to Tool.<br>  <br>  in Metal with the Satanism at least you can put that in Spirituality. I mean as sick or twisted it may seem to some 89% of metal bands that have Satanism in their lyrics are just Joking around they aren't even serious about it. <br>  <br>  I am no angel but I do write lyrics and trust me they are of good taste and actually have intelligence in them|`|AA10569146	They do it because its an easy sell. Theres no soul or life experiences in it. They're just selling a fantasy|`|yS61H04haa	Nope, not at all. I like a good naughty song. There are more than enough songs out there with serious lyrical content. I listen to it all. ( I avoid most rap, and wont bash it here ) The great thing is I can choose what I listen to.

You won't find too much sweet , cute stuff in my library.|`|CVBahMK0aa	yes.  lame , hackneyed, and boring.  i like to throw the stick.  who doesn't?  but every song that's out there talking about it is like getting a porn, and watching it over, and over, and over, and over.  new porn, over, and over, and over, and over.  it's the same stupid thing.  doing it, and listening about it are two totally different things.  shut up and sing about something else.  leave the blasting to the ones that do.   stop saturating the airwaves with your one time bone cuz it is very boring.<br>  <br>  excellent question.  sorry about my rant.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	its not the genre, its commercial music. in the background there are GREAT artists and music, for both. COMMERCIALISM is the virus|`|ld1vh7nHaa	yes, i was shocked when i heard the beatles sing why don't we do it in the road.....|`|cYgxTWDVaa	Mainstream is usually targeted towards a teen audience.<br>  <br>  Teenagers want to feel like "rebels".<br>  <br>  Mainstream music gives some pretty straight forward and easy to understand "rebellious" lyrics. (lyrics that appear to be controversial)<br>  <br>  Lyrics about sex,drugs,violence,kissing a girl/boy and liking it are all but decent.<br>  <br>  Teens that listen to mainstream feel that they can relate very much to the artists (only because the lyrics are very ambiguous and have broad meanings anyway) and admire them for being brave to sing such lyrics. <br>  <br>  Oh btw, people who aren't serious about music tend to just prefer catchy music(which is mainstream)...even sometimes ignoring the obviously terrible lyrics.<br>  <br>  And yes, I know you're asking about rap and rock but I just included everything mainstream anyway as its the same concept.|`|OLCoFKQraa	you know what, I was surprised by how many of Led Zeppelins songs were about "baby baby baby" and "every inch of my love" so this is nothing new, heavy metal and punk rock cover a lot more topics, as I'm sure you are aware Mr Red.<br>  <br>  Sugaree, concerning the dark sexual lyrics of The Beatles, how about "Run for your life" on Rubber Soul<br>  <br>  Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl<br>  Than to be with another man<br>  You better keep your head, little girl<br>  Or I won't know where I am<br>  <br>  You better run for your life if you can, little girl<br>  Hide your head in the sand little girl<br>  Catch you with another man<br>  That's the end'a little girl<br>  <br>  Well you know that I'm a wicked guy<br>  And I was born with a jealous mind<br>  And I can't spend my whole life<br>  Trying just to make you toe the line<br>  <br>  You better run for your life if you can, little girl<br>  Hide your head in the sand little girl<br>  Catch you with another man<br>  That's the end'a little girl<br>  <br>  Let this be a sermon<br>  I mean everything I've said<br>  Baby, I'm determined<br>  And I'd rather see you dead<br>  <br>  You better run for your life if you can, little girl<br>  Hide your head in the sand little girl<br>  Catch you with another man<br>  That's the end'a little girl<br>  <br>  I'd rather see you dead, little girl<br>  Than to be with another man<br>  You better keep your head, little girl<br>  Or you won't know where I am<br>  <br>  You better run for your life if you can, little girl<br>  Hide your head in the sand little girl<br>  Catch you with another man<br>  That's the end'a little girl<br>  Na, na, na<br>  Na, na, na<br>  Na, na, na<br>  Na, na, na<br>  <br>  This song really makes me wonder, how "little" was that little girl?|`|OWdoFmKqaa	What bugs me is the constant and apparent discrimination opposed to women in such songs, not only the sexual language used by the "artist" is sickening and abhorrent but it is offensive to all women out there, the inferiority presented is just repelling. <br>  <br>  I'm not entirely positive if anyone sees it in a similar way as I do but women are not sex slaves and they should not "act" as if they are. <br>  <br>  Being constantly drunk, high or whatever it is they show you is not an influential lifestyle kids these days should be following. This gives them a completely false example of how it is they should be living and carrying on with their lives, or how others actually live like. Even their behavior changes to the worse-it's a path they've chosen to take to create a mimic of those rappers lives. <br>  <br>  It's as serious or as lame as you consider it to be.<br>  <br>  I might have slightly drifted away from the exact point of this question-but with all we've seen, I find it pretty hard not to blame the example this generation is faced with-when people could show them a different side to what they could become-rather than to get them drunk and dead. <br>  <br>  To answer the first part of your question, yes I do. And to answer the second and keep it in brief-it's only because the idea of what the music is presenting to the people viewing or listening the song is found to be appealing to the viewers/listeners. I mean, who doesn't think gaining the love and support of millions of fans and then putting them off with a single shot to the head is cool?|`|PxqcLkw1aa	Some popular artists don't write their own lyrics. So some of it can be attributed to someone wanting them to appeal to the masses. Otherwise those artists are writing about the type of lifestyle the want to live. It's mainstream music and a lot of people are just sheep. The internet is a great tool for finding independent music. Go out there and find something that suits you.|`|AA11136495	yeah, i really do love the music i listen to, even though it does talk about that alot.. But seriously it can get annoying..<br>  in which i fall back to a bit of beatles, pink floyd, led zeppelin, you know, the oldies :], and get me some feel good music..<br>  I could go for some bob marley right now, Ska is really great for that too : D|`|hHxJ0BONaa	because most of the population is stupid and wants std's and stuff so they want to be promiscuous like those songs talk about. idiots, huh?|`|AgQForcYaa	YES!<br>  <br>  It is such BS! Just cuz you have money doesn't mean everyone else does!|`|fzqMOD4Waa	It does get annoying, but the simple reality of life is "sex sells" so on it goes.|`|JD4zeqiIaa	pssh, rap is crap. they sing about women being sluts.<br>  atleast with rock they have a bit of fun with it!!<br>  whitesnake - spit it out, song about a ******** :)<br>  even nickelback have fun with the songs.<br>  and they have songs about other stuff other than sex, but it's a fun topic to write songs about.<br>  far better than all the depressing "love songs" and those emo, i hate my life, everyone hates me, i'm going to kill myself songs that keep coming out.|`|eX7L3Zgzaa	rap sucks
CAR7UnW2aa	The first part means that you're heart is more open, so that you can find someone that you will like/love. The second sentence, means that you do not like being boring, that you want to find something that will be fun, daring, exciting in the senses. <br>  <br>  "Volcanic upheavals are going on in the middle of your chest."<br>  This sounds like you have lots of passion, but as since it is described as volcanic upheavals, it will eventually end. <br>  <br>  Just my interpretation|`|2SZVS9ueaa	Yes you soulnd Your heart is proving to be more excitable than usual.The idea that being bovine, you are placid and content to chew grass is being thrown spectacularly out the door. Volcanic upheavals are going on in the middle of your chest.<br>  19 hours ago - 3 days left to answer.|`|PvaxJHLuaa	Yeah, it's basically already been said before, but another answer can't hurt, right? It just basically means your stepping out of your comfort-zone and realizing that it's not that scary. Your heart is more open and because of that, so is your mind. You start taking more chances and see if the grass really is greener on the other side. And if it is, you'll probably eat the grass over there! Lol. Amusing.|`|zwoRqTkYaa	Taurus are usually considered conservative and down-to-earth kinda of people. But according to your reading, right now, you are ready to step out of that "safe-zone" of yours and venture into areas that were once intimidating or uncertain to you.

oOSNI3wbaa	sorry but i dont see satire anywhere in that movie.  i think that scene with the razorblades is more ironic maybe? since he was a cutter and thats how he died. a lot of jigsaw's traps are like that. but not satirical. movies like scary movie are satirical.|`|QvSwo3X9aa	Satire: <br>  A literary work in which human vice or folly is attacked through irony, derision, or wit.<br>  The branch of literature constituting such works. See synonyms at caricature.<br>  Irony, sarcasm, or caustic wit used to attack or expose folly, vice, or stupidity.<br>  <br>  In Saw jigsaw takes people who don't appreciate life and puts them into situations where they have to suffer and mutilate themselves to survive.

OPXGvFMPaa	they are quite amazing.  here's some info on them, from their myspace page..<br>  <br>   About THE HAND OF GLORY....AVAILABLE FOR SHOWS!!<br>  Formed in Heppenheim, Germany, the five-piece metal band "The Hand of Glory" has a unique line-up. Their members consist of musicians from North America and Germany; put them together and you have given birth to a multi-cultured child of Metal-Hardcore Mayhem. From the Viking-like riffs that would shake Valhalla, to the explosive drumming that would lay waste to anyone that comes within range. With abrasive riffs that would tear you apart at the seams and a voice that is blood thirsty and haunting; The Hand of Glory will leave you paralyzed. They have also shared the stage with such bands as SLAYER, TRIVIUM, AMON ARMARTH, Lay Down Rotten ,Dew-Scented, Dry-Kill Logic, Machinemade God, The Destiny Program, and many others......|`|HK4cW2Vcaa	That's not a link to a porn site is it.

64f086cd320012dee88e9cc62167567faa	This poem sounds good. I understand it. The "victim" is depressed and unhappy with their appearance, to the point that they can't stand it. They feel like they have to use material possesions to "cover" up, yet it doesn't help their mental state because they're still unhappy no matter how they've dressed themselves up. The two opposite souls (Im guessing) are the two sides of the person. It's so upsetting to the person they ache, they are miserable. Before, in the past, they were different, they didn't care. It wasn't so much of an issue. Now the "victim" is questioning why they are bothered so deeply, and they admit this state of mind isn't their norm. It's not who they truley are. It's not who they want to be. In reality they are suffering from what everyone goes through at different points in their lives, yet they feel as though they are going through it alone. I like it. It's descriptive but not overly excessive with detail, to the point with analogies. Great job. If this is you that your talking about, dont worry, time will pass as do seasons. If it was you, wow. You've explained it well.|`|8bde52af2fa0087c0392a3b7dd44537aaa	how old are you? i used to write poems like that in fifth grade???|`|a2f3cb5ef23ff318b46150fe09f33cbfaa	it's very good you should wright poems and stick them all in a folder to keep for memory's and try to wright a book and you have a personal book of your own poems|`|583611c8efed49b185fbc61e2831a84baa	OMG your poem is really good and it made me think allot.

8de2b1924f8fbd8d044fd8c8f8117aedaa	Because they both won a challenge and they have another chance to be in the top 3 they are dismissing three designers tonight|`|5ceb2f2ab38ce1f87446f319ab680385aa	The "benefit of winning" that Heidi's been mentioning is that in Episode 10, everyone who had previously won a challenge was eligible to return and compete again. But, an eliminated designer would only be able to stay if they WON this challenge. Since both Angela and Vincent lost this week, they are out again. Keith would have also returned (he won the first week), but he was permanently removed from the show.<br>  <br>  Personally, though, I think this was a last-minute effort to milk as much drama from Angela and Vincent as they could. If you notice, Heidi only ever mentioned "benefits to winning" in voiceovers - meaning, she probably never actually said this to the designers. They probably thought of this on the spur of the moment, after Vincent was voted off.|`|fa95a107c51b407e83a3e95fe81a0e10aa	They decided to give them a second chance because they had won challenges for some weird reason.|`|7fb7e9b1c204fb5cad146656ddde06c4aa	You know how Heidi always said there are benefits to wining in here Heidi voice?  Well this was a benefit.  Anyone who won a challenge who was kicked off could have come on at this point.  If any of them had they could have come back also.
f2ef74b2dac059c22989465bd1978eeeaa	When I was in Highschool tp-ing was more of a compliment.  Also, along with tp-ing, everyone would "string" your porch.  Take a dark colored or greyish colored fine string(type used for sewing) and wrap it several times around someones front porch, across an area they will have to walk through.  They wont even see it, and they will walk right into it.  Gets everyone, everytime, always made me laugh when it got me.  It's harmless, so no one should be offended.  Hopefully, you are not trying to offend.  If not, here's some more ideas.  <br>  Get creative and people get the "joke" more.  Stick a bunch of plastic forks in the yard. Make some little signs you can put in some of the fork tines.  They can say playful things like  "You just got "forked".   or a little more naughty "wanted to fork you for your b-day".  Okay that's bad, sorry.<br>  The traffic cone thing, that could be considered stealing so if you were caught the authorities could make you pay a huge fine.|`|fa95a107c51b407e83a3e95fe81a0e10aa	don't egg someone's car or house.  Be careful if you do go tping because you could get arrested if caught.
AA11326335	Umm...I don't think she had the tattoo removed. I'm pretty sure she still has it.

a43743e367beaa40caff3df474c941a6aa	First, find out what time signature the song is in.  Then buy a metronome and practice along with it.  It will keep the rhythm for you.  Practice slowly at first, and gradually increase your speed.  As for the picking techniques, you should use alternate picking (up-down-up-down) consistently as much as possible, unless the pattern being played crosses strings in such a way that it is impossible, or if the song employs a different technique.  If chords are being played, you can differentiate the upstrokes from the downstrokes by determining what sound is more dominant.  If the high notes in the chord sound more dominant, it is probably being played with an upstroke.  If the bass notes sound more prominent, you should probably be playing a downstroke.

F0FByGiQaa	Hate is a strong word to use. I don't hate her, and I personally don't know her so I can't judge her too much, but OMG SHE IS IRRITATING!!!<br>  <br>  Devyn talks like she knows everything. It is so annoying! She thinks she is a know-it-all! She also says she is college educated, and not a drop out. Okay, sweetie, you may have went to college and got somewhat of a good education, but you literally DROPPED OUT. She DROPPED OUT therefore she is a COLLEGE DROPOUT! UGH! What doesn't she get about that?! She is also lazy! The boys asked her several times to do things, and she acted like it was their job to clean. Does she think she is a freakin' queen and the boys are her servants? Also the way she acted with her fiance-exboyfriend-friend... (er.. or whatever he is?) was so stupid. Then when she talked to him on the phone, once again, she acted like she was some professional in relationships who knew everything. Another thing that made me angry with her was when she was like "oh scott liked me. he did. he just can't admit it now, but later he will." If he tells the cameras he doesn't like you, acts like he doesn't like you, tells others he doesn't like you, and tells you himself that he doesn't like you, then I am pretty sure he doesn't like you!<br>  <br>  I just wish she had a reality check. I am sure she could be a really sweet and fun girl if she just chilled a little bit. But then again, I don't know her ;]|`|65ae5dbf750c54c86214b6a8746d4b43aa	Devyn cant get her point across without yelling which can be annoying. She is very prissy to be so ugly and its hard to imagine her winning beauty pageants. The only thing i like about devyn is the fact that when she does talk she talks with common sense. Alot of people in the world stereotype others and people often associate black people with ebonics Devyn breaks the stereotype because she speaks proper English. Instead of young people hating her for a positive attribute they should want to make that change within themselves and quit hating on the next person for not being a walking stereotype.|`|RTfPrlEhaa	we only know what the real world shows us, so we don't know her that well. if you go to <a href="http://www.iamonmtv.com/therealworldbrooklyn/DevynRealWorldBrooklyn" rel="nofollow">http://www.iamonmtv.com/therealworldbroo...</a> it's like a myspace page and it shows a lot about her.

But by the time you are through, you will have a pretty good idea about composing. you have a long time ahead of you to learn. Just have the passion for it.|`|ncrTVkKMaa	At my high school, they have a class called Music Theory AP. It's a really hard class that teaches you deeper into the language of music. You learn how to sight read, compose, and especially, analyze different forms of music. I've taken it last year and passed it with an A-. I'm pretty sure most high schools have this course. <br>  <br>  (I've composed 2 different compositions during my progression.)

5mnLejLyaa	Interesting question. <br>  <br>  The city's love/hate relationship with batman - they see him as a vigilante, but often depend on him. Example: the police are after him from time to time, but then they might blame him if he doesn't show up to save them from a criminal<br>  How people who decide to become criminals feel the need to show it so externally - themed costumes, props, etc. The interesting thing is why do they express themselves so externally? Real criminals lead double lives, sure, but not to this superfluous extent. In real life, you would think someone was completely crazy for dressing up and acting the part of a costume, but at least Batman, catwoman, and some others are pretty sane. (the Joker is definitely an exception)<br>  <br>  This is based purely on the tv show, I never read the original comics. Hoped that helped! :)

Pretty ironic, coz the creator ish a girl -___-"""<br>  <br>  --- KATEKYOU HITMAN REBORN! ---<br>  <br>  KHR! is about a boy named Tsunayoshi Sawada [Tsuna] who is a total loser (studies, sports, girls, life >.>) & nicknamed 'No Good Tsuna' [Dame Tsuna].

At first, Tsuna refuses to do anything related to the Mafia, but then, he gains lots of friends & when danger comes, he is willing to risk himself for the sake of others. In the earlier episodes, you may not find Tsuna interesting coz he had to rely on the ‘Dying Will Bullet’ to get strong, but as the story gets deeper, Tsuna changed & totally FTW!!!

Yes, Cane was tricked, but he needs to deal with that, divorce Chloe & be done with her & then marry Lily & try to have a baby of their own. I cannot stand the smug look on his face when he says he is going after full custody & that he wants to raise the baby with Lily. Billy & Chloe have not done anything to prove they are unfit parents & if Cane does sue for custody, I think they should charge him with fraud for knowingly falsifying information on Cordelia's birth certificate.|`|ab2a840460fbbeb0af2b8c4445d4667baa	by rights it should be chloe and billy.

If Cane really thinks it out, he doesn't want to have to deal with Chloe for the rest of his life.  She is such a lying, manipulative person.

kpW7Jyb2aa	Vigilante is someone that breaks the law in order to bring someone to justice.<br>  <br>  It's kind of a twisted view point. the poster above mentioned Punisher, which is a good example. Punisher breaks every law he needs to in order to get to the person he's after. Punisher is a vigilante.<br>  <br>  The vigilante league of Superheros, would be superheros that do their job without any really thought about consequences or laws.

It depends entirely on what genres the answerer prefers as Metal is so diverse that a black metal fan will have a completely different answer than a grindcore afficionado, and both may be the representative best of their chosen genre, and be so far apart musically to be incomparable. Say 'Loadbath' by Lesbian, a 24 minute genre exploring doom/stoner masterpiece with black metal influences versus the upbeat Folk Metal opus 'Wenches & Mead' by Alestorm, both are excellent pieces of metal but are so different as to be incomparable.<br>  <br>  Screw it I'll just say Land of the Dead by Summoning off of Oathbound.  It's an emotional piece of symphonic atmospheric black metal.  The powerful drums echo over the sound of a melancholic distorted guitar droning with symphonic elements in the lead.  All over expertly delivered black metal vocals blended into the mix.  It's simply an amazingly powerful track.|`|AA10559017	VH1 did a Poll recently of the top 100, and Guns & Roses "Welcome to the Jungle" came out on top.|`|YCB0AjFiaa	Tornado of souls - Megadeth|`|6db82c1b800fa3265fb33558203952ddaa	Eat The Rich- Motorhead|`|5YOHxanTaa	Toxicity - System Of A Down|`|hfDBltaJaa	WHISKEY IN THE JAR- METALLICA

The most typical of the hardcore genre I've heard is From Autumn to Ashes, but I don't really listen to hardcore per se.<br>  <br>  The heaviest band with the most relentless riffs, especially in the guitar, is still Slipknot.<br>  <br>  The most hardcore band I've heard in terms of intensity is Thrice.<br>  <br>  The most hardcore band I've heard in the metal sense would be the Black Dalia Murder because of their song When the Last Grave Has Emptied.<br>  <br>  The most hardcore band I've heard going by tone would be Korn, tragically good band - tragic because the lyrics are too often horrible.<br>  <br>  edit: Wait, someone thinks Slipknot is noise?

ZOXoPgJbaa	The song, written by guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell, concerns the late lead singer of Mother Love Bone, Andrew Wood, who died of a heroin overdose in 1990. It is one of the band's most well-known songs.<br>  <br>  Jerry Cantrell commented about the song,<br>  “ I was thinking a lot about Andrew Wood at the time. We always had a great time when we did hang out, much like Chris Cornell and I do. There was never really a serious moment or conversation, it was all fun. Andy was a hilarious guy, full of life and it was really sad to lose him. But I always hate people who judge the decisions others make. So it was also directed towards people who pass judgments"|`|uFrIEo4Laa	good Lord,it IS NOT ABOUT HEROIN...well,not entirely...Jerry Cantrell,the guy who worte most of AIC songs,wrote it for Andrew Wood,the lead singer from Mother Love Bone....Layne maybe wrote half of AIC songs,read the credits on their albums by the song...jeez,not every f*cking AIC song is about heroin,accordign to some people,they could have did a version of mary had a little lamb,and some people would think,duuuh,it's about heroin right?get over that ****,no wonder Layne was a recluse,i don't blame him|`|zsUsZcbpaa	Wow no idea<br>  But their song are pretty good<br>  I love Man In A Box though :)

9VaWal2Daa	As a gentleman, I would say NEVER...........<br>  <br>  but life has taught me, that not everyone plays by gentlemanly rules. <br>  <br>  I can think of 3 situations, right off the bat, where I did or could have hit a woman, and not regretted it. <br>  <br>  One......was in grade school........there was this little WITCH who use to aggravate and tease me......and my mother would advise me not to hit her back, because she was a giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiirrrrrrrrrrrrlllllllll... and boys do NOT hit girls........<br>  <br>  Okay mom.........got it..........<br>  <br>  so one day....I came home, (after the witch pushed me, and I fell, )   cut and bleeding..........and my mom said......well, what did you do?   and I said NOTHING!   You told me not to hit her back!<br>  <br>  her eyes widened......and she said........the next time she bothers you......you CLOCK her one!       So, sure enough........when the witch came at me again....I didn't hestitate......I hauled off and swung my book bag as hard as my scrawny little azz could, and sent the witch flying!    Damn That felt GOOD!    and the little creep never bothered me again after that . <br>  <br>  A second time, was in college......when a girlfriend was disappearing to the world of drugs, and I was trying to help and she hauled off and belted me.......<br>  <br>  I loved her......and wanted to save her, and tried with all my heart to help........so I shrugged it off. <br>  <br>  The second time she went to do it..I was ready for her this time and I caught her hand.........and raised my fist.........and told her the FIRST one was FREE, the SECOND one will cost ya.........!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  and as I stood there, with my fist raised.....I knew I had lost that battle, and needed to walk away.    I will not stoop to that level.....and she will just have to work her problems out for herself. <br>  <br>  A third instance, was my sister and her husband.  She was hell on wheels and she married this MILKTOAST wimp.......who would sit there and just take ALLLLLLLLLLLLL her abuse.........and not fight back at all.  No defense, nothing. <br>  <br>  and I ROOTED for him to just get up and CLOCK her one......and she was my sister!<br>  <br>  Because I would have NEVER sat there and taken all that, and still had an OUNCE of self respect for myself. <br>  <br>  I can think of a 4th incident......just recently.......where someone said something to me.......and they were lucky they did not say it to my FACE.    Because I just would have gone ORBITAL on their azz, and they would have DESERVED IT!   WELL EARNED if you are reading this! <br>  <br>  so yeah........NORMALLY.........NEVER.........<br>  <br>  but oh Lordy......there are those that BEG for it!|`|KN36rGMvaa	Never.|`|kIblsxJQaa	no man should ever hit a woman|`|uB0QueSOaa	i think never...unless its self defense...|`|8j70Neqeaa	not good|`|NeOwDBulaa	never, unless the girl is coming at the guy with a knife, then its self defense.

Unless she hits you with something. then you can defend yourself and smack her ***.<br>  <br>  I mean there is abuse like hitting a woman for something you don't like about her you want total control. That is abuse. But you sure as heck can't let her abuse you. I think you get it.|`|1c1f532d0b7b25b3aae753390d6e60b8aa	when she, like me, asks her husband for a good spanking.<br>  <br>  consensual and fun|`|BXbnLxNJaa	you dont hit girls, theres no need, are you a man? our job is protect women, not harm them.|`|6npsRIzUaa	when the woman isn't in the kitchen and isn't sexing him up.<br>  clearly she's out of line and needs a good slap.|`|5mD4AfeWaa	In bed, please.|`|OKZkABDqaa	NEVER!! dont do it retard!! people will think you only hit girls because you cant beat up a guy. just dont do it.|`|OMoOg5WJaa	when she has a sex change :)|`|c32aCqwqaa	when she has a gun aimed at your face.. what guy needs to hit a girl to feel manly?? an insecure one for sure|`|u2lYbPT2aa	I don't know where you are from...but it is never, ever ok to hit a woman!! Men who hit women, are sick, sick creatures!! Men are so much stronger than women, that there is nothing fair about it!!

You never, ever see a man who beats on women, ever hit a man, or get in any kind of altercations with men!!<br>  Why would you even post such a question??<br>  Well, I know what happens to men now, who beat on women!!<br>  They don't have a very good time in jail!!!<br>  xoxo agoodgirl_msj|`|2kR4sX48aa	it is never acceptable.<br>  <br>  "in what situation is it possible for a guy to hit a girl and get away with it without being judged"-you<br>  <br>  never.|`|iIU7PQHjaa	it's never okay...the only situation i could think of that it would be allowed in my book is if she had a gun or some sort of weapon in her hand...then i would hit it out of her hand or hit her if i had to...|`|xvT1rqasaa	never.. but only if u REALLY need to, like if she was coming at u with a knife.. then i suggest u knock da b!+ch out.. or smack a hoe|`|wlP7AfdEaa	I think its a little unfair, girls can hit guys but guys cant hit girls.<br>  They say women want equal rights, its not very equal.<br>  But i dont think they should change it, its still wrong to hit girls.|`|547Ln6rNaa	If I hit my husband I think he would be entitled to hit me back (he wouldn't but I'm making a point). <br>  <br>  Men should no more be victims of abuse then women should.|`|sgEloO1Jaa	myt grandma always said if women are tough enough to hit they better be tough enough to get hit back|`|9e7f34ca42b0bc7a01f44825b1539e5eaa	NEVER<br>  <br>  what kind of sick bastard would try to look for reasons to justify violence against women .

Thats just out of order!|`|5d8cda11147363f74448679f58829463aa	For some reason I actually took some time and thought this out instead of passing over it and came up with two possibilities.<br>  <br>  1. She needs medical attention that involves force i.e. choking, CPR and you're trying to revive her. You could possibly get a shot in there and I don't believe anybody would say anything as long as it was in reason.<br>  <br>  2. An actual threat on your life i.e. disarm or subdue her or YOU WILL DIE. I believe you can get away with it there.<br>  <br>  After that being said, I'd never hit a woman, just how I was brought up and what I believe.|`|moyMbBxwaa	NEVER EVER FOR EVER NEVER|`|1YxQmh1iaa	NEVER!!!<br>  <br>  Weido... :S|`|VwKoHJGqaa	NEVER!|`|o37i9Nazaa	Never|`|DucgF5fraa	When the girl hits the guy first.<br>  I think everyone has the right to hit someone back when that person hits him-/herself|`|J6yvMr2taa	it depends on the setting.. but it's not really good t hit a girl.. as far as possibl be good to every person.|`|xLw02Uj9aa	DUDE, the only reason it should ever be ok that i can think of is if its during sex and she wants it to be rough or if its your mother in law....otherwise......never|`|SIkcSsuRaa	never hit women.|`|XBMVHBo1aa	never|`|IyoZRkZfaa	never.

I opened one and my mom opened another kind and then my dad opened one. then my dad opened the two other packs. my mom was like "I just bought those cookies and we've already opened 3 pack of almost the exact same cookies." my dad was like " well i want these ones." it went on for about 5 minutes then they really started yelling about saving money and wasting food it was pretty funny... until my dad grabbed all of the cookies and threw them on the floor. then my mom grabbed a gallon of milk that was sitting on the bar and said " IF YOU WANT THE DAMN COOKIES, YOU CAN HAVE THE MILK TOO!" ... and she drop-kicked the gallon of milk it hit the ceiling (2 story ceiling) and came back down, milk was everywhere and running down the walls. it was pretty crazy but all i could do was stare at them|`|547Ln6rNaa	My mother was boring, except when she had her second childhood, then she was just annoying.<br>  <br>  My father has spent his entire life so far imagining illnesses.

uuK5lYsjaa	Maybe it's just a security thing...|`|r8rykCkGaa	Not that weird really.  People find different ways to feel secure, but I got raped once when I went to sleep that way.  (I thought it was God punishing me---believe it was the devil though).|`|366aa3bbb60558f11aecb9d3750bceb2aa	As long as you don't forget and eat breakfast with that hand before you wash.|`|8t1Osybyaa	if thats how u sleep then whatever,might i say thats weird|`|AA10246871	If you've been doing it as long as you can remember, it's probably a comfort thing.<br>  <br>  If I am sleeping in pants or shorts or whatever (not a nightgown, anyway), I often put my hand in the waistband of my bottoms, over my right hip, sort of like if I had my hand in the pocket of my jeans. I know when I started doing it, too. I sucked my thumb for a lot longer than most kids, and I started doing it because I could go to sleep without my thumb in my mouth, but as soon as I drifted off, it'd end up in my mouth. I settled on that to keep my hand sort of tucked somewhere so I wouldn't move it.<br>  <br>  Also, when I am stressed, I tend to hook my left hand into the back of my husband's pajama bottoms at the waist (nothing dirty or sexy--its more like the way you'd grab a little kid by the back of their waistband to keep them from falling over). I usually do it in my sleep. I know for a fact that's a comfort thing, because I only do it when I am stressed, and sometimes if I cannot sleep, that will help me get to sleep--it's a way to touch him and know he's there without waking him up.<br>  <br>  Weird is relative. I am sure a lot of people are thinking you are masturbating and not copping to it, but I really do think it's just a comfort thing. The only thing you might want to do is try slowly to break the habit, because at some point, you won't be sleeping alone anymore, and it might seem weird to whoever is sharing your bed.<br>  <br>  Take care :)|`|2k8TEiRtaa	No I did that too. except one day i found out I didn't have one . You can sleep any way you want to. it is your bed and your life.Maybe your trying to protect yourself.

It was novel, but the annoyances that come with it got the best of me. My boatmates were really weird, too. One was actually trafficking in some heavy stuff, and I didn't even know until after I moved. The cops raided them a few months later and were asking me all sorts of questions. <br>  <br>  I don't recommend it except to the most adventurous -- and someone with a lot of money for . . . . emergencies. EVERYthing costs more when you live on a boat. Electricity, appliances, food -- see appliances-- permits, docking fees, luxury taxes, etc.<br>  <br>  You have to drydock the thing every so often to keep it from rusting out or being eaten away by aquatic critters. You get weird actual crabs walking around if you are by the sea.<br>  <br>  Every time a storm rolls in, you are in a very bad spot.<br>  <br>  ANYone can sneak aboard and mess with your stuff -- and maybe you. Someone can even hijack your 'house.'<br>  <br>  Everyone looks at you funny when they know you live on a boat.<br>  <br>  You can't get a bank account, because you don't really have an address. Your home is too portable.<br>  <br>  You can't get a loan because you don't have an address . . . <br>  <br>  It's hard to prove your voter status.<br>  <br>  Getting a job is hard because you give a dock or a pier as an address, and not only does that spark suspicion, but even if they believe you, they wonder if you will sail away tomorrow.<br>  <br>  It's more trouble than it is worth to anyone who wants to get on with his life.|`|9iNCQkWlaa	in vancouver, b.c. false creek please right beside granville island market|`|8j70Neqeaa	for a year or two|`|hVuPqHzsaa	No thanks|`|BBVfRheyaa	nope|`|AA10246871	Absolutely.<br>  <br>  My husband and I have talked about the possibility of renting  out our house when he retires, and moving to the coast somewhere, and living on a houseboat. A lot of the really big ones have stabilizers which keep them from moving in anything but a super strong storm, and even then, it's just very gentle movement. I also saw some really cool ones (very small, but cool nonetheless) when I was in Amsterdam last spring. <br>  <br>  I find the sound of lapping water to be about the most relaxing thing in the world, so I would love to live in one, since I have insomnia ;)|`|816d0234ce66aef35ce88055d2729beeaa	I have visited Holland a few times ( just transiting in between flights)and while going near the Amsterdam Canal area, there were loads of boat houses. Some were on the move some just stayed put and had lots of beautiful flower pot plants and even dainty curtains on the little windows. They were very scenic with the buildings behind. I was taking a ride on a river bus boat down the canal so I had a good view. If it stayed put, I guess I would give it a try- for short periods only though- like a holiday home or something.|`|V5K66Xb4aa	yes, i do during the summer cuz i own one<br>  its a 2 story 3 bedroom 2 bath <br>  i built it  2 years ago<br>  i live on the northern mississippi<br>  i also get to be naked the whole time too which is a plus, because being a size 28 w sucks when you cant find too many clothes that fit you.|`|afkygHMgaa	I already lived on one for a year.

AA11330115	I didn't view any of the videos, (because I am in school right now)  but I agree with you completely on all points...People are who they are...gay, lesbian, or straight. It doesn't matter. You don't plan who you fall in love with...it just happens. My step-uncle is gay and only about 5 years older than I am...we attended the same high-school together...we used to sit and watch guys on the street and judge who had the tighter butt...all in fun. I accept people for who they are, not what society says the should be.|`|EWDBjGwTaa	Im with harry pitts,im not reading that long *** shi t either.im all for being what you are,straight gay blue or purple,dont force it on us though.geez.|`|MVMTDvM0aa	i only watch the video but didnt read ur sentence! hahas lol.|`|2kR4sX48aa	there is no real question here, your just asking us to pass this information from person to person.<br>  <br>  this is the only question i saw<br>  <br>  "Would jesus, or buhda, or anyother legacy/prophet be ashamed of being gay or would they embrase it ?"-you<br>  <br>  answer is no Jesus would not be selfish and fall into being homosexual, nor any so called prophet.<br>  <br>  dont get me wrong but the bible clearly condems homosexual behavior.<br>  <br>  not hating on gays, just not going to pass this on. <br>  <br>  "Point- the point of this video is to show you that using words like 'gay' and 'lesbo' as a bad thing is hurtful to nice people and we shouldn't judge them for a personal preference in men or women."- you again<br>  <br>  lesbo or lesbian /gay depend on the context of the way it is said.<br>  <br>  for instance "i am lesbo(gay)" is not in a derogatory sense, where as someone says "your gay" is sometimes use as a derogatory sense.|`|MB1oT04maa	I'm not buying your propaganda ploy|`|AA12269023	I have nothing against them, but im not gonna start a petition or anything

But his was a lot longer and more annoying.|`|d2vENVGlaa	Yeah, like my best friend was a vampire and he was all cool and everything, but lately he's being such a b*tch.

GvEujg7Yaa	Kishimoto never makes mistakes!! <br>  Pretty sure none of the byakugan users were there when they did the crazy autopsy of the body. And when the rest of the pain's came they had already figured out what was going on and Kishimoto didn't need to waste any space with byakugan people being like "oh my god except the reader already knows". <br>  <br>  Anyways, Woah six tails I did NOT see that coming. <br>  Seriously no sarcasm there I really REALLY was.|`|HNaeWVHKaa	I'm pretty sure they did identify the chakra in them which is why they called them chakra rods and why they finally realised when Pain attacked them that those bodies were being controlled by a 'puppeteer'.

She knows she stopped because she tripped over her own feet, she just didn't want to admit it.<br>  <br>  ANTM needs to be someone that girls can look up to you and someone that girls will want to be like. She won't make a good role model when she acts and treats people the way she does!|`|DHzwr1braa	I was. Sandra is just too cocky. She thought she did good on the run way, but she did the worst. And did anyone notice how she bumped the girl she had an argument with when she was called to be in the house. On the next episode the girl with the fro is going to let her have it. She is way to sure about herself, and the only thing cute about her is her white teeth.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	I really disliked Sandra. She was really rude to everyone.<br>  I'm so glad Allison and Fo stayed!

We learned our lesson!    No more chips before dinner, because now we're stuffed!  hahahahahahahahahah<br>  <br>  Parents are so damn gullible.|`|4SGBr8cWaa	i was confined to my bedroom, even for meals, allowed out for bathroom only. just think, there were no computers, no cell phones, only one t.v. in the house, only one telephone. i had a radio(am only),comic books or school books.  worst was 2 weeks for throwing rocks & i didn't even hit anything|`|AA12269023	no computer until further notice...<br>  torture...|`|2k8TEiRtaa	In my time the dad would ground you with a left hook.|`|yf0tevyfaa	If i ever did get grounded it was just from going outside.

9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	People love to generalise and to pigeonhole. It means they don't have to think too hard. You have already admitted that a lot of young people DO like hip hop, pop and rock. People tend to judge groups outside of their own immediate sphere by what they perceive (rightly or wrongly) to be the majority trend. Sadly, the number of young people who like (or who will admit to liking) classical music is a small minority.<br>  <br>  It's the same as those young people who listen to hip hop, pop and rock judging us who like classical music as 'gay', 'snobby' or 'old'.<br>  <br>  Your biggest weapon is your knowledge and articulacy. If you communicate your love and knowledge of classical music well enough, people will HAVE to take you seriously. Unfortunately, you are swimming against the tide of perceived knowledge, but I think all of us 'older' contributors can remember being in a similar position to your when we were in our teens.<br>  <br>  Persevere and you will prevail! Good luck - and don't give up!<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Look back about a week or two in this section. You will see questions from young guys worried about people calling them 'gay' just because they dare listen to classical music. What a terrible inditement on our society: 1) that people would make this stupid judgement at all, and 2) that they use the word 'gay' as an insult.|`|FpWXuzH7aa	I think its probably because its mainstream trend of music now.Classical music,as we all can agree,has become rather obscure being compared to pop and rock.The forthcoming generation may well never discover this wealth of beautiful music.|`|kjEoHmKjaa	That's what they think. It's because of the stereotypes. The popular music of today is hip hop, and you know that young people seriously like new trends. But I understand you; I also like old songs.|`|AA10426129	they dont|`|i9beDOTAaa	its becoz us teens have been stereotyped by the media...<br>  <br>  you generally only see teenagers in the news etc for being 'hoodies' 'thugs'... <br>  this stereotype is also linked with hip hop... theres lots of teens that dont like hip hop but becoz of the media, adults think we are all the same...|`|XUQaRpgxaa	Its because its really popular and they think that teenager like it as well but some teenagers prefer different kind of genre of music|`|FfxmE9Toaa	I never assume any person likes anything due to age or appearance. I knew a working class man who lived in a small apartment who came home every night and played beautiful classical music on his baby grand.<br>  <br>  And I've also seen my nearly 60 year old brother in law become a huge fan of gangster rap over the past ten years. It's funny to watch a gray haired bifocaled white guy blasting Lil Wayne while settled in his easy chair.<br>  <br>  But the facts don't lie: over 90% of gangster rap CDs are bought by young whites.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	We do not !
WVLNcDXBaa	Rachmaninov- Piano concerto no 2<br>  You can't get tired listening this masterpiece!|`|FfxmE9Toaa	Irakere's 1978 live performance of "Misa Negra".|`|jbAr62ybaa	It might depend on how long one reasonably expects to live.  Like someone say 90 yrs. old, would probably have a different take on your question, than someone only 19.<br>  <br>       I don't know how long some of Bach's, Handel's or other masters of choral music are, but I would imagine well over an hour.<br>  <br>       And imagine that if one stops and thinks seriously about your postulation, the length of the work chosen would most probably enter into the process of choice.<br>     <br>       For me, it's no problem at all: Richard Wagner's "Der Ring des Nibelungen", which I'm sure will come as no surprise to any on this forum who are even in the smallest way familiar with my musical proclivities.<br>  <br>       It - all four of the operas - last from 15-16 hrs., depending on the conductor(s) tempii.  And as I've stated more than once, I cannot conceive of a more glorious way to pass on, than for it to occur while listening to the conclusion of "Die Gotterdammerung".<br>  <br>                                                     Alberich|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	I think, in all honesty, I would eventually get sick of even the most wonderful piece of music if I could only listen to that over and over again (perhaps you saw my question yesterday on this subject). I'm afraid I will have to abstain from giving you a proper answer as I couldn't possibly choose just one. Moreover, I cannot bring myself to imagine such a terrible situation as the one you describe and so I'm off to listen to lots of different pieces of music to make myself feel better.|`|70jNDiIiaa	I'd choose Handel's "Messiah" - it's around 2 hours long, with over 50 vastly different "chapters" - plenty of variety there - yes, that'd definitely keep me going, I reckon...<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Hafwen.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Ouch..tres difficile!...the St.Matthew Passion|`|vsy4QMHMaa	I would rather live in silence. <br>  <br>  ... Too much of a good thing is still too much.|`|AA11353245	Emperor - In the Nightshade Eclipse.<br>  <br>  This is an interesting question and an odd answer, as I do not like this album.  It is one of the few black metal albums held in almost universal regard that I simply cannot seem to enjoy.  I cannot even appreciate it.<br>  I managed to love Ulver's purposely unlistenable Nattens Madrigal, but Emperor still eludes me. <br>  <br>  I actually chose the album because trying to appreciate it may actually take the rest of my life.  I figure that's as good a reason as any.|`|rSbsj3tgaa	Here are a few ... damn, can't ever pick ONE!!<br>  <br>  Ride of the Valkyries - Wagner<br>  <br>  Moonlight Sonata - Beethoven<br>  <br>  Canon - Pachelbel <br>  <br>  Fur Elise - Beethoven<br>  <br>  I couldn't imagine getting tired of these!<br>  <br>  Luthien<br>  <br>  EDIT: thanks to whoever gave me thumbs-down, you're good for my ego. Pachelbel's Canon is a classic, I've listened to it 10,000 times, just can't get tired of it. Guess I'm weird that way.<br>  EDIT 2: Oh, I know you didn't give me a thumbs-down. I've seen you around, and you're too mature to do that. But I'd appreciate the visits, thanks. Cheers!!|`|eez2gtaLaa	If you call Beethoven's 9th a "piece" then it's long enough.

I can use both hands well but am predominately right-handed now.<br>  I had an older sister that was left-handed and I think my mother saw how difficult it was for her because everything is for right-handed people so when I came along she thought she was doing me a favor by making me be right-handed.

d2vENVGlaa	My family went on a holiday to some island, and we all went to the beach. I met a girl there and we became friends. We were swimming and talking and stuff, until she made me follow her into the sea. Then she pulled out this hacksaw and cut off my left hand. Then she handed me the saw and told me to cut off my right hand (I don't know how, but the left hand must have regenerated or something). I don't know how she threatened me to do it, but I grabbed the saw and cut off my hand. I could see all the bone and the tissue. It seemed so real. Then I escaped from her with the right hand that I cut off, and showed my family. I begged my mum to take me to the hospital, but for some reason she wouldn't let me go to the hospital. I ended up convincing her to take me, only in the pretext of cleaning the wound and stopping infection, she still wouldn't let me try and reattach my hand. Then we went to the hospital, and the doctor chopped off my left hand (for the second time).  Then I woke up crying.|`|zDXGCq52aa	That i went to willy wonkas factory, and we went in this really white long room with loads of big plants growing on either side and a gap through the middle, anyway we were walking and and willy suddenly shouted run and we all had to run out of the room into this smaller room with just a blue couch, i sat down and he said we had to run because of some monster that would kill you by just touching you, and we were all scared then everyone started screaming again and in came this multicoloured lizard so we were all screaming and then it jumped u touche me then i woke up, i couldn't sleep after that.<br>  <br>  weird i know<br>  <br>  and Other ones, like going to a big Colosseum where my school teachers were battling dinosaurs and One about werewolves and me hiding in the classrooms at school with my teachers.|`|osaGXG6Paa	i dreamt as if it were a zombie movie... but i was the zombies point of view, and i was so god damn hungry, i was so hungry, it overruled caring for friends or family members. all i wanted to do was kill and eat and scream.<br>  <br>  when i woke up, i realized that if our natural instincs are strong enough, feelings and emotions are forgotten...<br>  shows how minipulatalbe human lives are.<br>  <br>  i also feel real ad for zombies now.<br>  :)|`|lSvUIKsDaa	I dreamed I was part of this system of revolving shiny metallic spheres.  It was really amazing and trippy; it was the only time I can recall being something other than a human or animal in a dream.|`|Rodj52Swaa	i wonder what rule number 3 is... lol<br>  <br>  i didnt have a dream... i had a nightmare|`|G1lSbvAQaa	okay I'll tell you two:<br>  <br>  First one is this:  One day I was in a restaurant at the penthouse of a skyscraper in NYC, (I live in Miami...lol) and then I was eating dinner with my parents there, when the waiter came up to me to inform me, that my dog, skippy had taken a crap in some park in Connecticut.  So I had to go pick it up.  I go down the elevator and leave the building, and then I cross the street into Connecticut (??) and I'm suddenly in the park!  So I was looking for the poop that he had left but I started finding a bunch of dead animals... Like Giraffes, TUrtles, Lions, and then I found a dead Bear and it had a baby bear that  was still alive.  But the baby was like the size of a Quarter! lol  So I picked up the baby bear and stuck it in my pocket to go ask my parents if I could keep it, and then I reached into my other pocket, pulled out a folded up bicycle and unfolded it, got on it, and that's where the dream ended....LOL<br>  <br>  Now for the other one:<br>  I was just there and Sylar from Heroes (He's the villain in case you don't watch it) Kidnapped me!  So he was threatning to use his powers to torture me and kill me if I didn;t help him kill other people.  So then I was just there one day and I had a knife (Don't know why or how I got it, but it was huge) and I stabbed Sylar with it, but he's invincible so it only stunned him.  Then he made the little hand motion to cut my head off like he does, but I ran out of the house he was keeping me in before he could.  Then I found these senior citizens getting into like a van and I asked if I could hide in their van.... They were like, sure! so I got in and they drove off.  (It was in Tampa by the way...) then I asked them to drop me off at my apartment, and I don't know how I found it, but when they dropped me off, I was in front of the Toys R Us in Times square.  It turns out that I lived in the store and it was like my apartment/toy store.... and then I went in, melted the knife (Don't ask me how lol) and poured it down the drain, and just sat down in this happy colorful place until I woke up.  The end.<br>  <br>  I don't know why New York City is always in all of my dreams!|`|uKSsXz2iaa	I was driving to the grocery store in the town that I live in. When I walk out of the car and towards the door, all of a sudden one of my best friends and my boyfriend's sister in-law jump out of another car and start screaming and crying and running my way. Next thing I know, I am being shot in the back three times. I am somehow in London then, and it is the 1960's, and I run down some steps into a basement and take off my shirt to be operated on. The late John Lennon starts chuckling at my breasts, and my doctor is a young Paul McCartney. Then we are miraculously in a house, back in midwest America, nextdoor to my mothers house. She walks by but doesn't see me through the open window. I am sitting with Paul and apparently, we are a couple. We are still in the 60's, but something comes onto the television about his recent divorce with Heather Mills. I laugh and pat him on the knee.|`|TXtNdYqqaa	I dream a many times of rattle snakes; Some striking at me, opened wide mouthed, in slow motion biting me.<br>  Telling my sister this she then looks up this in dream book: It is good luck to see snakes in your dream and even better luck the more they bite you; Bringing fortune, luck and money your way.<br>  <br>  I'm climbing a huge cliff, my hand is reaching into a rock pocket to climb a step further and this huge rattle snake coils out at me; It strikes me, then snakes come out of the rock cliff, crawling all over me.<br>  <br>  Now having these snake dreams over a period of 30 odd years has proving to be right so far...

eRVRWwkBaa	Metallica is just a plain,great,ROCK  N' ROLL the way rock should be. They evolve and have the audacity to change,experiment and are willing to gamble with their music and do things their way and let the fans come along for a ride. I've been a Metallica fan since my brother had me listen to "Welcome Home Sanitarium". That said. <br>  Master of Puppets>great album,yes<br>  Definitely a top 3 album|`|VijJYZznaa	Master Of Puppets isn't what I think about when I think of thrash. It's pretty clinical. The songs are well written and I do like most of them, it's just that it isn't raw and furious as most classic thrash albums are.|`|75SSAFsPaa	yes and yes. here is a story...i recieved that album for my 16th birthday and cliff burton died a week or so later.|`|2bVxBCgzaa	Rust in Peace for me. MOP is incredible, though I like RTL better.|`|BRVF1b4gaa	NO NO NO NO NO|`|4e11GJVZaa	I don't know about the best thrash album. I know there are many other great thrash albums I haven't heard. But I do think that this is an incredible thrash album period. I think that it does more than just hit you with raw, brutal power. It takes the time to slow down, get evil, and then get right back in your face by the end of the album with incredible ferocity. It's not all thrash, but it has to be one of the best of all time, this will stand the test of time until the end of metal history.|`|uyQppMYLaa	Personally I preferred Slayer's Reign In Blood. That's my favourite thrash album, it's fast, short, and hits you where it hurts, right from the first riff. <br>  <br>  Although I must agree that Master of Puppets in a great thrash album.|`|tyTJE8vxaa	No, that title belongs to Slayer - Reign In Blood. Master of Puppets was less thrash than Kill em All & Ride the Lightning, it was more just straight up metal.<br>  <br>  It's definitely one of the best metal albums of all time though|`|w5v1HlJ1aa	Hell yes! Master of Puppets is awesome!|`|pyXn05dHaa	I would say it is the best.<br>  <br>  Every song on the album is amazing!<br>  <br>  It is not overrated at all...unlike the black album..|`|AA11353245	Honestly I prefer Ride the Lightning over Master of Puppets, they're both great albums but I think Ride the Lightning has an overall better track list.|`|Dm2zrJCRaa	I wouldn't consider it as thrash, however it is a great album that all true metalheads have in there collections. Love RTL more though!! HEAD BANG 4 EVA!!!|`|sNKxpMN0aa	Best metal album ever|`|DQyLgIGRaa	Hell Yeah it is. Damage Inc., Battery, Disposable Heroes, Orion, Welcome Home (Sanitarium)  and the title track would be great songs for any band over the course of their career but the fact that these are all on one album makes it IMO not only the greatest metal album of all time, but the greatest album of all time.|`|zxg3z2HYaa	If you are still listeinng to thrash metal i would recomend <br>  <br>  Iced Earth<br>  Kreator<br>  Sepultura<br>  Angra<br>  Slayer|`|NfObC07saa	i dont consider master of puppets thrash. but is it def a top 3 metal album!!|`|oOSNI3wbaa	no. my vote for greatest thrash album goes to RUST IN PEACE.

DtU1EpoVaa	QI (Quite Interesting) is a British comedy panel game television quiz show created and co-produced by John Lloyd, hosted by Stephen Fry, and featuring permanent panellist Alan Davies. To date, 56 guest panellists have appeared on QI. Until late 2008 it was first shown on BBC Two and repeated on BBC Four, with syndicated episodes of previous series shown on Dave. QI has the highest viewing figures for any show on BBC Four and Dave.[1][2] From series "F" in late 2008, the show moved to BBC One with extended repeats on BBC Two (entitled QI XL) first being shown in 2009.[3]<br>  <br>  It is distinguished by the awarding of points not necessarily for correct answers, but rather for interesting ones. Many of the questions are extremely obscure, making it unlikely that the correct answer will be given. Points are deducted from a panellist who gives an obvious but wrong answer, typically one that is generally accepted as true but is, in fact, false.<br>  <br>  <br>  Format and conception<br>  The panel consists of four participants: three rotating and one regular, Alan Davies, who has the seat to Stephen Fry's immediate right. Davies has appeared in every episode, except for one that was themed on "Divination": he was present at the beginning, but he "teleported" away during the buzzer demonstration. He was at a football match instead but was still able to play as communicated "from beyond."[4] He has only won six times: since he generally offers up most of the "obvious but wrong" answers, he usually finishes last; however, his six victories place him only one behind the show's most regular winning guest, Rich Hall. The show's other panellists mainly come from a stand-up comedy background, although there have also been guests from other fields, including Richard E. Grant, Hugh Laurie, Jeremy Clarkson, Gyles Brandreth and Roger McGough.[5][6][7]<br>  <br>   <br>  Stephen Fry hosting QI in Series A.Questions are sometimes misleading or very difficult. Providing an "obvious but wrong" answer results in a sequence of klaxons. In the first and second series, Fry produced the answer on a card to show the panellists, while it also flashed on the large screens behind them (except in the pilot episode and the first show of the first series, when only the cards were used).[8] In the third series and onward, Fry's answer cards were dispensed with altogether, leaving only the screens as proof that the answers given had been predicted.<br>  <br>  Because of the show's expectation that hardly anyone would be able to give a correct answer without significant prompting, it instead encourages sheer interestingness, which is how points are mainly scored.[9] As such, tangential discussions are encouraged, for panellists are apt to branch off into frivolous conversations, give voice to train of thought, and share humorous anecdotes from their own lives.[9] The number of points given and taken away are normally decided by Fry or beforehand by the researchers, especially if the points given or taken are very large. For example, one episode asked, "What is the main ingredient of air?" If someone answered, "Carbon dioxide" then 3,000 points would have been deducted, but no-one gave this answer. However, Davies was deducted 10 points for saying "Oxygen".[10] Fry once said (namely in Episode 10 of the first series):<br>  <br>  Now, the rules are simple. Scoring is my business. Points are given and points are taken away. They are taken away for answers which are both obvious and wrong, and they're given not so much for being correct, as for being interesting. Their level of interestingness is impartially determined by a demographically-selected customer service focus consultancy, broken down by age and sex — i.e. me. Because there is no-one more broken down by age and sex than me.<br>  <br>  John Lloyd, QI's creator, has admitted that not even he has any idea on how the scoring system works, but there is someone who is paid to check on the scores. Guests are allowed the right of appeal if they believe their score is wrong, but no one has done this so far.|`|WlI7xjsiaa	Q.I. is a humorous quiz show hosted by Stephen Fry in which the panelists are comedians and celebrities.  There is one permanent panelist, Alan Davies.  The "Q.I." in the title is meant to stand for "Quite Interesting".  This refers to the fact that the questions are so difficult as to be almost impossible, and so the panelists are awarded points for responding with interesting answers and theories even if their answer is not correct.  Conversely, points are deducted if the guests answer in an obvious or boring fashion.<br>  <br>  To illustrate, one question posed by Fry was "how many moons does the earth have?".  Davies buzzed in with the answer "one" and was deducted 10 points for giving an obvious answer that was also incorrect.  Fry then gave a scholarly account of how the earth technically has six moons.  As is usual the panelists (in their disbelief) then pitched in with various jokes and quips which, if sufficiently interesting, netted them bonus points.<br>  That's a rather sedate example, but over the series Fry has elucidated factoids such as how female kangaroos have two vaginas, how there is a bird species that can moonwalk (with hilarious video evidence) and how a fruit fly has sperm cells that are 2.3 inches long! (to which Davies suggested that you could keep one as a pet).<br>  <br>  Obviously, the entertainment value stems mainly from the host's and guests' contributions, with the questions serving as interesting segues to their jokes and rantings.  Often it's just one joke after another until eventually discussion returns to the question at hand.<br>  <br>  It's a good show because it's frequently very funny, but the viewer also finds out about all kinds of little-known things and the misconceptions people have about them (the questions can be about anything really).  Of course ultimately you'll have to give it a watch to see if it's your cup of tea.

car4UyLFaa	Maybe he does understand the joke, if he has cable or older family members, maybe he's seen some older shows. Also, what makes Family Guy funny is more than just material, but the randomness of it, the context, and the delivery - comedic timing can sometimes be picked up on without any need for understanding the material. The kid could totally be laughing at part of the joke without understanding the original reference. Or, maybe it's just that laughter is infectious.<br>  <br>  My roommate brings up a good point - Family Guy jokes are multi-layered, like onions! We may not know who this random clown is, or this particular actress, but there's something about clowns and random actresses that are funny, it's just that it would be more humorous if we knew more about the allusion.|`|vp8806Eraa	more to the point, why is a 12 year old watching family guy in the first place? it's definately a show for adults, not kids!!!|`|ge5x9NHxaa	They only laugh because the words being used without understanding the jokes.|`|6db82c1b800fa3265fb33558203952ddaa	Its called the Lemming Mentality...When one laughs they all laugh|`|jxs7LyzSaa	I don't know for sure, but I find this sort of thing to be very annoying.<br>  <br>  I know a 12 year old-ish kid who does this all the time, and he shouldn't even be watching Family Guy! I mean there are occasional "fart joke" level  comedic moments on the show, but it is mostly referential and ironic intellectual humor that most kids his age don't understand. <br>  <br>  My guess as to why kids laugh at this stuff is because those moments are set up to be a joke (enough for anyone to realize what just happened was meant to be funny), so they laugh because they don't want to feel excluded from the joke. Not laughing would acknowledge that they didn't understand something which kids are reluctant to do. Kids that age are probably only watching the show because they know older kids who watch it and want to also in an effort to be cool, or because the show drops some curses every now and then which makes it seem forbidden/cool.<br>  <br>  Family Guy is not a show that just anyone should watch especially if you don't understand sarcasm and irony. I know people who actually take things Peter Griffin says seriously as the views that the show itself intends to project, and that is just absurd. Some people just have no business watching it.|`|AA11402617	Honestly I can't imagine any 12 year old with cable TV has not heard of the Fonz but I do understand your point.  Take the clip with Peter in the attic with Ann Frank and her family, crunching chips just as the Gestapo arrives.  I doubt many young people know about Ann Frank but I suppose you don't have to know it's about an actual situation to see the humor in it the way it was presented.  <br>  <br>  Here's another. Remember when Brian goes on the road to find himself and he runs over a guy?   When Brian finds out the guy is Dean Koontz he backs over him again.  I looked the guy up and although I'm still not sure why the writers would have such disdain for that particular author, still the joke worked anyway.   <br>  <br>  One references I noticed is probably unknown to 99% of the viewers. In "Road to Rupert" Stewie says "my dog will lick peanut butter off of any place on your body, ANY place!"   The guy replies "Well I did go to Choate".   It took me a half hour to sort that joke out.  Turns out is was a inside joke, as Seth Macfarlane is an alumnus of a rival Connecticut boarding school, Kent School. and their rivals were <br>  a private prep-school is called Choate Rosemary Hall (commonly referred to as Choate).<br>  .<br>  I've gone on to long but in conclusion, I would hope young fans of the show might be curious enough about some of the cultural and historical references to look some of the stuff up and open their minds, so to speak.|`|wTB9xTvDaa	Cause they are funny.  But sometimes my dad needs to not make stupid comments.<br>  <br>  Once, he got a nasty letter from the church for the scene "This makes me a worse father than Abraham".

Use your fingertips on the strings, unless it calls for a bar chord.<br>  When you strum do it like you'd clap your hands.  You wouldn't clap your hands on every syllable....would you?  NO, you'd clap your hands on the down beat.

9NRyeif9aa	1.POPULAR MUSIC (AKA Pop)- Pop music is a music genre that features a noticeable rhythmic element, melodies and hooks, a mainstream style and a conventional structure.<br>  <br>  Different Kinds of POP.<br>  <br>  The term "pop music" was first used in 1926 in the sense of "having popular appeal" (see popular music), but since the 1950s it has been used in the sense of a musical genre, originally characterized as a lighter alternative to rock and roll<br>  <br>  The Dance Pop:Dance-pop is a style of electronic dance music and a subgenre of pop music that evolved from disco, circa 1981, that combines dance beats with a pop/R&B song structure. Because there is such an emphasis on fully-formed songs in dance-pop, it is often viewed as a separate classification unto itself apart from pure dance music. Dance-pop is also closely related to the teen pop and Eurodance movements in the mid- 80s and late 1990s, the rise of boy bands and girl groups, and the reintroduction of the vocoder and similar such innovations.<br>  <br>  Contemporary Pop:Adult contemporary music (frequently abbreviated AC) refers to a broad style of popular music that ranges from lush 1960s, vocal-based music to predominantly ballad-heavy music with varying degrees of rock influence".AC radio plays mainstream music excluding hip hop, hard rock, some teen pop music and rhythmic dance tracks (though during the 2000s, these have been included), which is intended for a more adult audience. Radio stations playing this format will often target 25-54 year-olds, the group most valued by advertisers. AC is generally divided into 4 groups: "hot AC," "soft AC" (also known as "lite"), "urban AC," and "religious AC." Some radio stations play only hot AC; some play only soft AC; and some play both. Thus it is not usually considered a specific genre of music, since it is merely an assembly of selected tracks of musicians of many different genres.<br>  <br>  Pop Rock:Pop rock is a mix of pop music and rock music that uses catchy pop style, with light lyrics over top of guitar-based songs. There are varying definitions of the term, ranging from it being classed as an "upbeat variety of rock music" to a subgenre of pop music. Scholars have noted that pop and rock are usually depicted as opposites; the detractors of pop often deride it as a slick, commercial product along with advocates of rock who claim that rock music is a more authentic, sincere form of music.<br>  <br>  2.BLUES- Blues is a music genre based on the use of the blues chord progressions and the blue notes. Though several blues forms exist, the 12-bar blues chord progressions are the most frequently encountered. Blue notes are sung or played at a slightly lower pitch than that of the major scale for expressive purposes. Blues emerged at the end of the 19th century as an accessible form of self-expression in African-American communities of the United States from spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts and chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads.The use of blue notes and the prominence of call-and-response patterns in the music and lyrics are indicative of African influences. The blues influenced later American and Western popular music, as the blues form became a basic pattern of jazz, rhythm and blues, bluegrass and rock and roll. In the 1960s and 1970s, blues evolved into a hybrid form called blues rock. In the 1990s, punk blues appeared as an outgrowth of the blues rock and punk movements.<br>  <br>  3.ROCK- Rock music is a loosely defined genre of popular music that entered the mainstream in the mid 1950's. It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rhythm and blues, country music and other influences. In addition, rock music drew on a number of other musical influences, including folk music, jazz, and classical music.<br>  <br>  4.HIP HOP (AKA Rap)-  Hip hop music is a music genre typically consisting of a rhythmic vocal style called rap which is accompanied with backing beats. Hip hop music is part of hip hop culture, which began in the Bronx, in New York City in the 1970s, predominantly among African Americans and Latino Americans.The term rap music is often used synonymously with hip hop music.<br>  <br>  5.JAZZ- Jazz is a primarily American musical art form which originated at the beginning of the 20th century in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of African and European music traditions. The style's West African pedigree is evident in its use of blue notes, improvisation, polyrhythms, syncopation, and the swung note.<br>  <br>  6.RAGGAE- Reggae is a music genre first developed in Jamaica in the late 1960s.While sometimes used in a broader sense to refer to most types of Jamaican music, the term reggae more properly denotes a particular music style that originated following on the development of ska and rocksteady. Reggae is based on a rhythmic style characterized by regular beats on the off-beat, known as the skank. Reggae is normally slower than ska, and usually has accents on the first and third beat in each bar.|`|Vt13Y9Ydaa	I would say the major music genres are pop, rock, rap, R&B, and country.<br>  <br>  Examples of artists can be:<br>  <br>  Pop: Britney Spears, etc.<br>  Rock: Foo Fighters, The Police, etc. There really are hundreds of examples, but I won't get into the different rock genres because there are too many.<br>  Rap: 50 Cent, etc.<br>  R&B: Alisha Keys<br>  Country: Keith Urban, etc.
zJQGJW1saa	They actually do a run thru (like a dressed rehearsal) with or without the studio audience. It saves time for the producers and allows the participants to sound check. Then that footage is used for their recap. It sucks for the studio audience cause it can get monotonous and repetitive seeing the performance twice. I think she probably did not do that for the sound check cause she did not want the other contestants to copy her or worst yet, be told not to ad lib. Hope this helps!|`|AA12390047	There's an audience for dress rehearsal as well as the real performance.

Cv2h6n1Raa	If your into music you should get "the devil and daniel johnston." Its about a guy who has schizophrenia but he is an amazing artist and musician. It goes throughout his whole life, how he was one of the first people ever on Mtv, how his condition effected his career being in and out of mental institutions, and how he has influenced so many of today's musicians. Kurt Cobain wore his tshirt to the VMAs and to every photo shoot for a long time. My description does not do the movie justice but if you watch it I think you will really like it. Its funny, sad, and super cute! one of my favorite movies of all time!|`|1wDkKyLCaa	check out some older ones you haven't seen in awhile|`|YLYPBf4waa	Have you ever seen Intolerable Cruelty?

wOqR7q9Xaa	Well, after you've recorded and mixed your piece of music, there are tiny details you might one to change or enhance. Making audio clearer, adding effects and moving pieces of audio to fit better are all examples of things done in mastering.

vH2OF9z8aa	so what you want is Wealth): Completion of material prosperity and riches. Freedom from financial anxiety, the security of home, and the enjoyment of family. The passing of inheritance along to children, or the gaining of inheritance from parents. <br>   The card second from the right represents the physical vision: how the object is seen at a base or mechanical level. The Devil: Being seduced by the material world and physical pleasures. Lust for and obsession with money and power. Living in fear, domination and bondage. Being caged by an overabundance of luxury. Discretion should be used in personal and business matters. <br>   The card in the middle represents the mental vision: the object personified and seen through a humanized perspective. Five of Cups (Disappointment): Suffering a loss and wishing for what might have been. Being crippled by sadness, grief, and vain regret. Indecision brought on by the feeling that you made the wrong choice. Ignoring what you still have. May suggest a broken relationship or tragedy. May also suggest a gift, inheritance, opportunity, partnership, or marriage, but one that falls below expectations. <br>   The card second from the left represents the emotional vision: how passions and values are creatively stimulated by the mental vision. The Moon: Cyclic transformation covering the mysterious forces of the night. Feminine beauty and the intoxicating vitality of youth. The metamorphosis from beauty to beast and vice versa. Occult forces, sensitivities and intense dreams. Dangerous situations and perilous times. <br>   The card on the far left represents the fourfold or mystical vision: still viewing through the previous three, we now add a spiritual element, revealing unseen aspects of the object. Four of Wands (Completion): A chance to rest and rejoice, having successfully resolved a matter of great import. The initial success of a business venture or creative project. The blossoming of a friendship or romantic relationship. Conclusions drawn based on hard won experience. Spiritual, material, or emotional rewards for diligent effort. May suggest marriage, childbirth, or a victory celebration.|`|BovpXrk1aa	numbers lady.com|`|6q3g1WRYaa	i duno but nice ttitts

CRDl9nffaa	Aaron's answer above is pretty good. I'd certainly go for the idea of - without the pencil:) - slowly turning your speaking voice into your singing voice.<br>  <br>  But try this as well ...<br>  <br>  Hold the back of your hand flat and close to your mouth so you can feel the air on it when you breathe out of your mouth. <br>  <br>  Now start talking, with a simple phrase or a  line from a song. Push each word out sharply so you can feel the air on your hand. <br>  <br>  Slowly introduce more of a musical note into the words, but keep that breath coming out onto your hand.<br>  <br>  Get more and more tuneful until eventually you're signing the line with the sound coming out of your mouth. You need to be able to feel that breath!<br>  <br>  It's not going to come quickly, because you're undoing a lifelong habit. But stick with it, though it will feel weird at first.|`|vtafeEIJaa	Join a church chorse|`|KMXoINJraa	You need to train the sound to come out the throat.<br>  Few things you can do.<br>  <br>  Put a pencil in your mouth.<br>  If you sing notes over the pencil<br>  (which you are doing)<br>  it will feel like its coming out your nose area<br>  (which is also a good technique to learn.<br>  <br>  For lower singing sing underneath.<br>  <br>  <br>  For normal singing, try to sing through the pencil,<br>  (it won't sound good with then pencil in your mouth of course, but you will still get the feel for it)<br>  <br>  Another thing you can do, is to talk normal, then start to turn your talking voice into a singing voice.

hZ9omSataa	During a new years eve party for 1999 my friend and I went to one of my classmates house for a party.  Now, this was for the Millenium, and there was all that Y2K stuff going around.  <br>  My friend and I decided to bring some LSD and didn't tell anyone, cuz we only brought enough for us.  We had to show up a day early, cuz the party was far away, and we didn't want to drive on New Years Eve.  <br>  So, we take the LSD and were waiting for effects, in the mean time our hostess wanted us to set up a camera on her pool table, cuz her party's always ends up with sex on the pool table.<br>  Ppl start to show up, and we are tripping.  We stand outside and watch them through the glass window, thinking that they may try to kill us, so we have to be very careful.<br>  Many things happened, we became paranoid that there were cameras everywhere, and that ppl were recording our conversations, so we made up a language, though neither one of us actually knew what the other was saying, we believed that we did.<br>  After the ball dropped some ppl left, we were staying the night, cuz of the drive.  On TV there was 3 of the best movies ever to watch while on LSD, Heavy Metal, The Wall, and Jacobs Ladder.<br>  While watching these movies we looked up, all of the ppl @ the party were naked and having sex all around us....we had no idea if we were tripping....nope, I had mistakenly invited my friend to an orgy.<br>  Had no clue it was going to turn into an orgy after 12am, but apparently it did.<br>  We were so freaked out we couldn't sleep all night, we thought that we were going to be raped if we fell asleep....sex is no fun on acid....it becomes sick and gross and you can't understand why ppl do it, but to sit there and try to ignore that everyone around you on the couch isn't watching the movie, they are naked and having lots and lots of sex with all different ppl.|`|nPfdmZR8aa	Yes it's very possible, it all depends on the person!

In order to use isohunt, you have to download utorrent, but its very simple. It tells you the title, the size, how common it is being used, and if theres anything potentially dangerous about it. If you do use this program, when a movie is finished downloading, dont delete it right away because the way it works is that when someone downloads something, the next person that wants it is downloading it from you, so if you delete it, they cant get it, so please be nice and let it sit on there for a couple of days or so...email me back if it worked or not...guslover2389@yahoo.com or guslover2389@hotmail.com|`|3c97237894c9462cf25deb2e860485ecaa	for torrent clients, (search in google or yahoo, download free torrent clients)<br>  <br>  <br>  mininova.org <br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  btjunkie.org<br>  <br>  <br>  are good to download.|`|EiED4IrJaa	I'll only tell you if you promise to only use it to download legal movies.

tuATxHsVaa	(For those of you that may be confused, he is referring to a common violin performance piece from Bach's 2nd Lute/Violin Partita in D minor, BWV 1004. )<br>  <br>  Of course I have memorized this! I have memorized the entire Partitas for performance. When I have to perform them, I usually just practice them diligently for a week or two. It really doesn't take long for me to memorize music that I love dearly. <br>  <br>  Some musicians just aren't very good at memorization. It's a somewhat common problem. If you are playing through most of the piece from memory, then surely (with the following tricks) you will be able to memorize the rest.<br>  <br>  One route (albeit a modern one) is to simply listen to a recording of the piece over and over again. I call it "internalizing" a piece. A little practice with theory and interval training aids in this. An advanced knowledge of music theory will help you to realize that there is only one way to perform a great work. Those double stops that you are referring to must be performed a certain way... sort of like a mathematical equation. You won't be satisfied by any other voicings of those chords.<br>  <br>  Here's Milstein & Heifetz doing the Chaconne:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFdbQtu2A4Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFdbQtu2A...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS5b5_V3pcY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS5b5_V3p...</a><br>  <br>  Now, some people just aren't ready to apply their music theory in the way that I just described. <br>  <br>  We'll just assume that you are practicing for at least 1 hour per day. Hopefully, you are taking a 10 minute break every 30 minutes or so. Hopefully, you might even be practicing 1.5 or 2 hours in a day - because, let's face it, this is a difficult Bach piece.<br>  <br>  Remember, practice SLOWLY. Practice extremely, extremely, slowly. This is the best way to memorize something. It will record every nuance of the music into your somatosensory cortex, thus enabling you to recreate every muscular movement when you bring it up to tempo. <br>  <br>  Now, how are you working on this? Can you play most of the piece from memory? If so, then why not just work on memorizing those last bars that give you trouble exclusively?<br>  <br>  Spend an entire day working on just those bars if you have to. The best route to memorization is to just do it. A lot. So, work on those bars... a lot. This reminds me of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto. Much of the concerto is fairly straightforward (fairly, mind you). However, many passages have rather intricate notes that one has to work on for hours. Sometimes, you just have to buckle down and treat those passages like they are works in and of themselves. Learn them, then learn the rest. The prestissimo section from movement 2 of Tchaikovsky's 1st Piano Concerto has to be learned like a separate piece from the entire work. You'll encounter these difficult sections from time to time.<br>  <br>  As you become more skilled with the parts giving you the most trouble, slowly incorporate them into the music surrounding them. In other words, add in the 5 or ten measures before this section and after this section. Practice that. Don't just play the piece straight through and become upset when you forget how to dive into the section that you memorized apart from the rest. Incorporate it slowly. <br>  <br>  Bare in mind that when you neglect to practice from memory for more than 3 days, you will begin to forget. Psychology has proven that you will begin to forget at an exponential rate. <br>  <br>  It might be best for you to go through the entire work and choose several points. You will work on memorizing these sections on various days. It is easier to break a piece down than to try and memorize the entire thing at once. You will always miss details if you do that.<br>  <br>  Sit down and analyze the work with whatever knowledge of theory that you currently have. You'll want to make sense of the notes. <br>  <br>  It is common for people not to remember the ending of a piece. The end of the piece usually gets worked on very little, while the beginning is worked on all the time. Practice the ending sections of the piece (using the sections that I told you to divide the piece into). That way, you won't be favoring the beginning too much in your practice. <br>  <br>  Always work on your fingerings, bowings, etc., before you attempt to play back a memorized piece.<br>  <br>  Don't just stop playing a piece that you memorized because you forgot a measure or two. Just keep going. Look at the score afterward and try to figure out what went wrong. <br>  <br>  Finally, it is always best to do a mock performance. Gather family members and play it for them. The pressure of performance can make you forget things sometimes. There should be no pressure, though, because violin playing is really easy when you have put in the hours that it takes to truly succeed. =).<br>  <br>  Now let us practice this wonderful Bach piece properly!<br>  <br>  Court Violinist<br>  <br>  *

vtafeEIJaa	mY EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH 5 STARS HOTELS SHOWS ITS ALWAYS DON`T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING IS THE SOLUTION..|`|KMXoINJraa	Just drink water, have it with you on stage etc.<br>  I just hum what I am going to be singing/screaming and just try to relax as much as possible.<br>  <br>  Then when I get on stage I try to get super pumped up and try to get the crowd pumped, that helped me out.
HHPha1J0aa	Hi<br>  Make sure you drink enough water through out the day and if you have time before a perfomance try steaming <br>  Just fill a bowl full of hot water place a towel over your head a breathe in vapour this acts like a humidifier which will keep your vocal cords hydrated and clear any phlem build up also aiding better quality of singing voice.<br>  <br>  Before going on stage it may help to run through the song either in your head or just singing it through and doing some vocal warm-ups this can be simple as humming gently up the scale also you say that you gulp water this is not a good idea as this can damage your cords<br>  The best way to drink water is to gradually sip it also be sore that its at room tempreture as cold water can be a shock on the vocals just as if your drinking hot water so never gulp.<br>  <br>  I hope this helpsx|`|DzlKDPh0aa	Ok first of all calm down! My music instructor has always told me worrying about it doesn't solve the problem. Second of all rigle your toes. It sounds crazy but when your on stage move your toes around and this will help you to calm down and not faint. Thirdly does this sore throat thing happen before you sing or regulary? If it happens regualary maybe you should see a doctor about it. I use to get dry throat before i sung because i was really really worried and nervous about going on stage. You need to calm down other wise there is no way you will be able to sing. Try to pretend the audience isn't there. Or even try to think their in their underwear. It's an old kid tale but sometimes it does work. Once more i will say it again calm down! Because im sure you sound great you just need to relax and im sure you'll be fine.
rP292HE9aa	I think they brought in Kara to replace Paula. Paula's not all there anymore and they brought Kara in so people get used to her before they get rid of Paula next season. I was pulling for Megan Corkrey from the start. I like her singing style with the whole jazz thing and she's definitely unique, but I don't see her winning the competition. If Billie Holiday was reincarnated and was a contestant on AI I don't think she would win because most AI fans don't appreciate that kind of music. Another one I really like Allison. She has a killer rock/soul voice, and just listening to her sing, you'd never belive she was only 16. It'll probably be her or Danny to win it all. That blind guy should NOT be in the top 10. He pretty much made it out of sympathy. He's really not that great of a singer. I don't like that Adam guy. He needs a haircut, but I like that he picked a Stones song. That big guy that does construction work or something, he shouldn't be in the top 10 either. I think all the girls voted for him for his looks. Same thing with Kris. Matt's cool, but he should really stick to the piano thing. That's all I can think of for now|`|65ae5dbf750c54c86214b6a8746d4b43aa	I think Simon has been right so far when it comes to his critiques of the contestants. I think new judge kari Diogardi has a little hater in her. I hope Anoob dog comes back in wild card round. If he does it will be him, allison Arahetta and Danny Goki in the final 3. I hate the new set up of American Idol. They need to go back to the old way. Girls sing boys sing then vote until they get top 12. I hate change uuuuug.|`|rHHm4XNpaa	I kinda think it is cool... now cause Anoop has another chance.<br>  I hope he sings a great song, something that will help him...<br>  Maybe something more challenge...    not boring songs or R&B...<br>  maybe like one of Mariah Carey or Celine Dion or Luther Vandross...<br>  I hope he can sing the top of his lung... with high note or something.

Both of them are totally nuts and obsessed with themselves.|`|cidwIuJRaa	She does not impress me in any way.|`|Bi51WJd7aa	I think she has gone from pretty much being a nobody to being a somebody as a result of marrying Tom Cruise! A part of me can't help but think that she married him because she wanted that boost of fame to get her starring in more breakthrough roles, etc.. I mean lets be honest, she would still be known as 'Joey Potter' otherwise right?<br>  When she first got with Tom, I thought she seemed kind of weak, with no backbone and just sort of doing and acting the way he wanted her to. But it appears to me that she is rather independant and for herself at the moment. I don't really like her though.|`|WyxxDgSeaa	I don't care about her one way or the other and I don't see her as a hot topic. For her sake though, I wish she'd stop trying to be a sex bomb.  Her latest magazine pictures look awful...she's got that old heroin chic look going on.  And there's something creepy about her saying she knew she was going to marry Cruise when she was a little girl!  To me, she was a tv actress, mediocre at best, who married a once huge star and had a baby.  If she's happy, that's fine.|`|1wDkKyLCaa	i don't know what the big fuss is about her. i never thought anything of her, good or bad, just not important, but she has a beautiful daughter|`|FomIa9jQaa	I dont know but since she got with tom she's more Famous|`|P7mYy4CFaa	She is so a mom and has found True Love...Good for her...|`|aA3NsOkNaa	I like her as an actress, but her taste in men is peculiar. <br>  Tom Cruise is a freak, like the rest of the aliens. lol|`|ouUkY2t7aa	She is? I haven't heard about her since Batman a few years ago. Then again, I don't stay up with the latest Jr High School gossip. Sorry.|`|fX6ENI8Zaa	Don't really care about her, she's really not a big part of hollywood. <br>  Her only claim to fame is marrying tom cruise, and having his kid...and doing the whole scientology thing|`|LqnWk9Ilaa	She's insane. straight up insane. just look into her eyes and tell me she's not insane|`|RlbXtailaa	not a smart girl

76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	The problem lies with Distribution (in America).<br>  <br>  Either:<br>  <br>  The movie's producers want to pay very little money to a distributor/studio for circulating the film, or<br>  <br>  None of the distributors/studios (or perhaps the producers themselves) think that paying a lot in advertising costs to market this film would be worth it . . . not enough people would go to see it to make it profitable.  Any small profits it makes would be eaten up by the advertising, and therefore the film would be a loss.<br>  <br>  So, in order to save money on advertising, they push the film out direct tto DVD, and most of the cash that comes in is pure profit.<br>  <br>  Chances are also that it was not considered a good enough film for major release in America.  <br>  <br>  You'd have to be an insider with the movie's producers to know the actual reason behind a lack of release in the US.

QEuhPEb7aa	Hmmm....you mastered your acoustic guitar already?<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be so sure of that.<br>  <br>  Anyway, it's good that you had patience to train with guitar for a year. Congratulations for that ! <br>  <br>  Assuming that you have a basic grasp of most fundamental skills such as:<br>  <br>  Tuning with various variations<br>  <br>  Improvisation<br>  <br>  Strumming chords<br>  <br>  Sustaining and holding notes<br>  <br>  Major, minor, blues and pentatonic scales<br>  <br>  and some knowledge in music theory<br>  <br>  <br>  I think you're ready to start with an electric guitar !<br>  <br>  Now I don't think there's anything bad with starting with a Strat. I just really don't think they cost that cheap, it might be Mexican made and not US, so check that. <br>  <br>  Look and observe the guitar. Hold it and try it on. Play it a bit. Listen to the sound, does it feel right and sound right? Check for any blemishes or factory defects the axe might have. When you're satisfied, then buy it ! Remember that getting a better paint job for your guitar is never out of the question as long as you can pay.<br>  <br>  You will also choose a neck for your guitar, I believe. There are 2 options for you. One is the maple neck, if you enjoy that bright and bell like sound. The other is the rosewood neck, if you enjoy speed in moving at the fingerboard and a really warmer and fuller tone. <br>  <br>  Personally, I went with the rosewood.<br>  <br>  My Experiences<br>  <br>  The Strat feels good, it's light and easy to play. It's a lot cheaper than most Gibs and it's easy to repair and modify. The sound is very clear and clean. You don't really get a lot of great effects when you plug it to an ordinary amp, I used a pedal board back then with my Strat. That pedal board had about 3 effects, Overdrive, Distortion and Wah wah. It sounded great. But my problem with Fenders are the unwanted buzzes and sounds that I get at some times. <br>  <br>  I really didn't last long with my Strat. It only took me 3 months to buy an ES-335 for my new band. After a while I got myself a Les Paul Custom and I've never gone back to any Fender guitars ever since. As far as I can remember, it cost me about $1400, it was 2004 back then. It wasn't a pack too, I just got the guitar with some basic accessories.<br>  <br>  Playing clean is good if you're a beginner, not much when you really get into playing guitar. I suggest that you invest your money on the axe first with a moderately priced amp. When you save up a bit, buy a better amp, like Marshalls. If you have any cash left on you, start picking up on your pedal board. Choose the effects you enjoy using and need a lot when playing. Find a good technician to help you arrange your pedal board. A player always changes the axes more often than the pedals. I know I have.|`|wZlqxCTNaa	If it's an actual Fender brand starter kit, go for it. Starter kits made by reputable guitar companies are great for beginners to learn with without going broke.<br>  If it's some sort of generic no-name set-up, be careful.
ktdMxaGuaa	Yes you can, there's no rule saying Directors have to write their own scripts. Most Directors don't. Being a good Director means good delegation, being able to interpret a script into something visual, picking the right people to help you find your vision, and being able to create a meticulous schedule and create/work within the constraints of a budget.|`|d12a585a9f486535d07b0683ef24b00eaa	probably.  a lotta crappy  movies out there  so it must be so.|`|sr3l6pgsaa	Information is information.Knowledge is different.if you have knowledge,you can really build something.And you have it.<br>  The others can help you to write and prepare scripts.<br>  good luck.|`|76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	Absolutely.  You DON'T have to be a writer. Don't let anybody try to tell you that you have to. But you should be able to Analyse a story/screenplay - the characterizations, the plot, the overall feeling of the piece - so when you're offered a script, you'll be able to recognize its quality & if it works for the screen.  And if it doesn't, then you can be articulate enough to guide/work with the writer in the rewrite process to a draft that addresses what you perceive are the problematic elements in the screenplay, your vision, and how you see the film.<br>  <br>  By the way, MOST directors can't write at all.  Even Spielberg - he took credit for writing CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, but it was actually written by at least 5 (yes, at least 5 and possibly more) other writers (including Hal Barwood, Jerry Belson, John Hill, Paul Scrader, and Matthew Robbins). <br>  <br>  Paul Scrader talked about this many years later. Spielberg commissioned each of these writers to write a UFO script  based on his ideas.  He didn't care for any of the resulting screenplays, and what he did in the end was to combine pieces from the different scripts into one,  the final rewrite by sitcom writer Jerry Belson.<br>  <br>  Spielberg took sole credit on the screen for a script he never wrote. <br>  (He paid the writers off for their work & for giving away their screen credits).  <br>  If he can be a great director without being able to write, so can others.  Next time you see CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, or any other of his movies, think of that.<br>  <br>  Most directors in film & TV cannot write, and among those who do,  fewer can write well. You could count on 2 hands the number of really good feature film writer-directors working today (which would include Tarentino and Woodly Allen).|`|Z3W8t5QJaa	Yeah of course you can! As long as you can convey what you want to say across to people, theres no problem. If your worried that you dont have a whole vocabulary of elaborate words, dont be. Watching the behind the scenes of many DVDs, and the directors directing things, they use really basic, simple language to get their message across. Dont let this dull your dreams of being a movie director!!! If thats what you wanna be...|`|ra6t3UsLaa	Some would say that's a prerequisite.|`|uUWjOh9Paa	Yes. Some writers are good writers but don't have a clear vision. Movies that were really big this year, Slumdog Millionaire and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button had different directors than writers.

ktdMxaGuaa	Yes you can, Marvel doesn't have a monopoly on superpowers. However, if you call them "mutants" you are in a sketchy area because it is an element of their copywritten work, you might want to think of another phrase. Of course if you're just putting your video up on youtube or something, chances are you wont have any issues, if you're trying to make a profit off your movie then you wouldn't want to call them mutants to be on the safe side.|`|1P7qdjieaa	yes|`|d12a585a9f486535d07b0683ef24b00eaa	if you got the coin  to bankroll a flick, go for it.  otherwise its nothing more than a youtube yawner as far as im concerned|`|a31YBmwHaa	its basically the same...so yes. u can

It's one good thing the movie has done, otherwise, it was just an OK film. I saw Barah Aana at the Pune film festival and i saw other 6 movies as well.

In the fact that most signs have one animal creature or human. While Gemini has the twins. I'd love to feel like I had not a worry in the world.

48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	Maybe because for some it blurs the line between playing a video game and playing an instrument.. And those who get good at the game think they're little rock stars...? Just a guess. I see it as a game and don't have a problem with it except that it's annoying sometimes to be in the same room with my kids and their friends when they're playing it.<br>  <br>  Does it take away time that a person could be learning to play a real instrument? Sure. But so does everything else that is not that one little thing, so why bash the video games? Kids who won't pull their noses out of a book ~ arguably few and far between ~ are equally "wasting" their time if the only judgment of time well spent is that used to learn an instrument.<br>  <br>  It's a game. It's not even in the same ball park as learning an instrument. I will say this, tho.... *anything* that promotes music appreciation is okay by me. And... I love that my kids are finally listening to more classic rock ;-D|`|mv7h2Wjbaa	Because they think its a simple game , and doesn't teach you anything. My Cousins dad is like that then again he acts all rich and snobby so that could partually why but I love the game :) its like the only one I'll touch on the playstation seriously lol|`|JD4zeqiIaa	I'm a guitarist, and i like playing it.. i struggle though because i play the songs how i play on guitar.<br>  I don't hate i... I like that it.. opens peoples eyes to better music. As long as they don't start saying they love this band so much when they only know one song that's on guitar hero or rock band.<br>  <br>  i don't really know why people hate it.. haha they want something to hate? i don't know, people seem to get really touchy when people start liking the same music as them *shrug*<br>  too confusing for me|`|cYgxTWDVaa	Simple.<br>  <br>  It creates posers.<br>  <br>  People who say "hey this is my favorite band" and if you ask them what songs they like from this specific band, they only mention one which can be from any of those 2 games. (bottom line is that they've obviously only known that band from the game)<br>  <br>  And then they take no effort in supporting the said favorite artists like say by buying their albums?<br>  <br>  It's not really the fact that they pretend to play a real guitar.<br>  <br>  I based this on what I observe btw, this does not mean that this is my personal view.|`|695QqLK6aa	Some people are stupid. It's a game, it's not exactly supposed to be like playing guitar, it's a GAME! This topic makes me angry. Also, I play expert, it took me like 2 month or so. I've tried real guitar on and off since I was about 5 and still can't hold one properly.|`|XpDt1bqHaa	I play guitar...have for years....don't hate the games...i like them both.....i just wish theyd make a game that used a real guitar fretboard and real playing..i know they cant get all of it in a game but they could get enough to start some people on the way...wouldnt that be fun too?|`|z7lTBWkYaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q7MH1aPTEQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q7MH1aPT...</a><br>  <br>  Only three kinds of people hate Guitar Hero<br>  1. People who havn't played it<br>  2. People who suck at it<br>  3. Preppy douchebag Guitar "players" who only play because they are preppy douchebags|`|LIY8QrgMaa	Only idiots hate guitar hero. I play guitar, and I love guitar hero. I think its cute and quirky. As well as loads of fun, ( and it lets me imagine myself playing some songs I have no hope of ever approaching).

I83pDTOFaa	Turistas-Josh Duhamel<br>  <br>  <br>  While traveling on vacation through the country of Northeastern of Brazil by bus, the American Alex Trubituan, his sister Bea Tribituan and their friend Amy Harrington meet the also foreigners Pru Stagler, Finn Davies and Liam Kuller after an accident with their bus. They follow a track through the woods and find a hidden paradisiacal beach. They decide to stay in the place drinking beer and dancing funk and parting with the locals and they meet the amicable Brazilian teenager Kiko. They are drugged with "Bom Dia, Cinderela" (translation: Good Morning, Cinderella - a trick used by smalltime crooks to steal naive people) and when they wake up, they are practically naked, with all their belongings, clothes, money, jewels, passports, backpacks etc. stolen. They walk to a small village trying to find a police station, they get into trouble with the dwellers and they are helped by their acquaintance Kiko, who leads them to his uncle's isolated well-equipped cabin in the woods to wait for the next bus two days later. Along the night, Kiko's "uncle" arrives with his friends and the group discloses the sinister intentions of the newcomers.|`|KG0B5dNFaa	Sure sounds like Touristas.

K4lRi1fjaa	G'day Grim Burton van Gogh,<br>  <br>  Thank you for your question.<br>  <br>  The Joker was the first Batman villain appearing in Comic #1. He has been responsible for a number of tragedies in Batman;s life including the paralysis of Barbara Gordon and the death of Jason Todd, the second Robin.<br>  <br>  In some of the back stories, Batman was present when the Joker ended up in the chemicals leading him to blame Batman. Memorable portrayals by Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger have helped make the Joker the most memorable villain.<br>  <br>  I have attached sources for your reference,<br>  <br>  Regards|`|HNaeWVHKaa	If he is then it is probably because the Joker questions and challenges Batman's beliefs more than the other criminals do. That's what I believe anyway which always makes the Joker a very interesting character.|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	Joker and Batman are polar opposites and in turn keep each other going.<br>  <br>  Joker wants chaos while Batman wants peace. Joker has no conscience and in return wants to break Batman's, so he can prove that no person is incorruptible. Joker doesn't really care about doing bad things he just wants to prove to Batman that what Batman is doing is all for nothing. The other Batman villains don't do stuff to specifically target Batman, like the Joker does. So since Joker targets Batman's morality, he is the biggest threat.
tyTJE8vxaa	I think she's a damn fool for going anywhere near him, and it's gonna be hard to feel sorry for her when it happens again.<br>  <br>  But love can make you do funny things, I guess.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	classic abused victim:<br>  they are in the "honeymoon period" again; shes ind denial he's an abuser, and that he will continue to absue her. and shes in denial that shes becoming an abused woman.|`|onkUcy19aa	They suck. Both are juvenile delinquents, in the real sense of the word. Both of their careers will really suffer because of their stupidity.|`|AA10426129	I think its her business. Its her life. People are so bored with there own lives they want to make decisions for her life. She has the right to do anything she wants. If she wants to be with him then she will. She doesn't care what any of you think about it. She is her own person.|`|vet4adaYaa	I could care less, they both are morons from what I have seen and no need for me to waste my time wondering.  Not my problem.|`|SqPVrEaCaa	its their life-- whatever|`|OLvNK5FOaa	It's rumoured that they are back together. If she did get back with him, i dont think it was a good move, he could do it again, and violence against women is just not right. I don't think this could affect Rihanna's career, since she wasn't the one committing the violent act, I would say it would affect Chris's, Rihanna just needs some time to heal, and I think she'll get back on her feet.<br>  (:|`|4su2AwvCaa	How could this affect her career?<br>  I don't think it will<br>  Would you not buy her music because of her personal life?<br>  If anything I think this situation has given her more fans<br>  <br>  We should not even be in the position to have an opinion on what she does in her life<br>  Its easy to judge when you are not in the situation<br>  And it is alot harder to get out of an abusive relationship than it is to say<br>  <br>  Love makes you do crazy things<br>  Guess we will never properly understand|`|IPoaeWXPaa	Noone knows what they would do in that situation uless it actually happened to them. Trust me. People can say oooh i'd kill him or i'd never take him back but until it happens to them how can they know.<br>  <br>  if she's taken him back she's obviously got her reasons and like the saying goes Noone knows what goes on behind closed doors and it is sooooo true!|`|9x3surIDaa	We weren't there so we don't know what happened. Did she spit in his face? I don't agree with physical abuse on any side, but let's not be judgmental. At lease they are mature enough to WANT to work this out, and remember that in order to be forgiven:You must forgive.|`|do8pdlluaa	I don't think she should be with him.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1535097/chris_browns_day_in_court_brown_charged.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|Hjy0qwFPaa	well if she wants to be with Chris then that's her and his business<br>  and people may not approve of that but we don't know them personally so why bother them on what they decide to do.|`|fvQiacJxaa	i think rihanna shouldve given him more time to show he was really sorry not just forgive him out of nowhere|`|kTMkP2mtaa	She's CLEARLY a grape short of a fruit salad.|`|RSLLR0Z4aa	Yeah when i heard the story and saw thos pics, i wanted to beat tha sh*t outta Chris Brown, he had absolutely no buissness what so ever to beat her like that. Then when he started showering her gifts and shyt, as if she hasnt had or cuddent afford everything he got her, she was arms open to his punk ***. I still can not understand what the hell went on in Rihanna's head about taking that fool back. (and to tell u the truth, i never really liked Chris Brown until like the day before the incident, i started to think he was just a young guy tryna show his talent to the world, but now i think hes a peice of shyt more than ever lol)|`|vQrR8H3Aaa	It happens all the time. Women go back to their abusive husband or boyfriend. Maybe it's because they think they did something to deserve it. Maybe they think they can't (or don't want to) find someone else and can't stand the thought of being alone or raising kids on their own. Maybe they are afraid of what he will do if they leave. In a lot of the cases, the woman doesn't wise up until he almost kills her. In others she doesn't get out in time. Makes absolutely no sense.|`|MpbYCsygaa	I think it's her business and though I don't agree the least bit with what chris did however I feel it's wrong how ppl are ready to throw him under the bus he is a nineTEEN yr old kid they should try to help him instead of saying oh his career is over I'm never buying his music again and all of that bull!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|4Um6yfhdaa	Although, I have heard of it, I don't know much about this rihanna and chris brown scandal so I guess I'm not one to judge. Still, If that happened to me, I would never take him back.|`|car4UyLFaa	Celebrities have their own form of politics. Instead of lies to get elected, they have drama to get attention. It's all publicity stunts.|`|TereMtGeaa	Cause chris brown had a ****** up past and they obviously care about eachother, well she cares about him, if she took him back... good for her|`|49d1f310913761654c516175bd063759aa	Totally agree with you. I don't get it, why go back with him when she could have any guy she wants! I wouldn't even think about going back with a man that hits me!|`|AMycRlGbaa	i think it might be a publicity thing<br>  i lovvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee them both  and have like an obsession with chris but neways they do **** for money|`|ouUkY2t7aa	Maybe she felt she partly deserved it? I don't know.

9VaWal2Daa	Sure of course when they are coming from my babe or sweetheart.........but I find them a bit odd when total strangers start calling you cupcake, and sweet pants and sweetie and sugarplum....<br>  <br>  it can sound condescending coming out of the wrong context....... yeah, like someone just said here.........kinda creepy when your boss does it to a female underling..........calling her Honey or Sweetpea......it's degrading when it's NOT your Honey using the names.  It oversteps the bounds of politeness and proper etiquette and that invisibile wall of personal space.    If the personal does not know you well enough to be calling you "Sweetie".........then it's off putting, if ya ask me. It comes out sounding very artificial. <br>  <br>  They are personal terms of endearment......not to be used as greetings for everyone you meet.|`|cgXX13YVaa	we only say this to girls because we sometimes forget your names, we have so many, it's hard to keep track of your names, so we call you babe and hun!! Sorry, truth hurts!|`|SqPVrEaCaa	it depends on who's using them<br>  i hate it when middle-aged men call me by those names, but the older people, you just have to smile and let it go|`|ib00OjJXaa	i like babe, baby and hun|`|zPU5npWaaa	yeah. <br>  <br>  when in relationships i use them all the time.<br>  <br>  even when im not in a relationship...if im getting intimate..."babe" comes out all the time.|`|V5K66Xb4aa	its actually sexual harrassment to use them on people at work because they can easily be viewed as derrogatory|`|Drb9EP5Kaa	there's a perverted old guy that hangs around our local gas station that calls me babe.

HHPha1J0aa	Hi<br>  You should never strain your voice but i find the best way to begin warming up your vocals and preparing to reach the higher notes is by gently humming up the scale<br>  Start from a comfortable range and gradually hum your way up too the middle of your rage (dont have to go to high this stage)<br>  After that count from 1-10 up up the scale using your diaphram again you dont have to go too high<br>  Because the high notes will be there<br>  <br>  Now there are two diaphrams you probably use the one just under your rib cage but there is also another one just under your tummy<br>  This is where the real sound resinates from<br>  To acheive this<br>  make a loud shhhh sound until all your breath runs out and repeat this process about 3-4 times.<br>  <br>  Do these vocal warmups daily and you should notice a difference is the quality and the range of your voice the breathing techinique will also help develop better support and power in your voice<br>  <br>  Also before singing it would help by steaming inhalation which which is like a humidifier helping to clear phlem and hydrating your vocal cords<br>  Be sure to drink lots of water at room temperature as this is better for the voice sip slowly and dont gulp it as this could damage the cords.<br>  <br>  I hope this helpsx|`|KMXoINJraa	When singing high, you should keep everything that you use to sing very soft.  You need to harden you stomach for a full sound.<br>  <br>  Don't lift up your head, If anything keep it down barely.<br>  This is the same for ex-hale screams. <br>  <br>  Your teacher should be able to help.<br>  Just tell him/her what you want to sound like etc.<br>  Bring in CDs or whatever and your teacher will help you.|`|0Rwsg8IVaa	Expand your ribcage more. Also, when you get to the really high notes, anticipate them before you sing. That should help you control your voice better.|`|8K0LfeC7aa	The best advice I can give you is to drop your chin and not let the sound of the notes come from your stomach. The sound should resonate from the top of your head. Hope it makes sense! :-)|`|CRDl9nffaa	It's all about developing your ability to relax and open your throat, feel precisely what it's doing, and to feel and use the resonances in your upper body and head. <br>  <br>  It's very easy to write that down, but you need real time guidance from a human being. So what I really recommend, like some of the other answers, is use your vocal teacher. This stuff is easier to work with someone on one-to-one than to get from just words.|`|HJkfIq8Waa	Just hold your air in your diaphragm and learn to manage it..<br>  <br>  lip thrill will be of great help to avoid airy sound..<br>  <br>  then learn how to belt out w/ ur mouth and throat are open..<br>  <br>  Practice a belting-out exercise to help you with diaphragmatic breathing, or even scaling will help you with that, lip thrill will be a help for diaphragmatic breathing..<br>  <br>  And in reaching high notes, curve your shoulders, to control you note; close your eyes, to focus and addition a lil drama; lessen your effort, for it might produce a squeaky sound; add stress, the source of the pressure of your voice to reach those high notes..<br>  <br>  I would love to teach to u what my coaches taught me about singing.. <br>  <br>  wanna know more?, IM me.<br>  <br>  I hope that I helped you ;D|`|tVB1kbFIaa	practice and push yourself. If it hurts or becomes hoarse give it a rest and practice later. try singing in your car or room with the music up way loud, that's how i improved. after a while i could sing everything i wanted to and gained the confidence to sing it with music at a lower volume. (that and i really learned how to project my voice trying to be louder than the music). if your throats dry drink room temperature water.

A: When it's wearing its cute bunny rabbit costume!" or "How many ADD kids does it take to change a light bulb. . . wanna go ride bikes" or the one where the first muffin says "Wow, it's getting hot in here." and the other says "Ah!

The person closest to the head begins by saying "Once the roads were icy and cold", which the others repeat; then "A woman lost control of her steering wheel" is spoken and repeated back. Finally the last sentence "When they found her she was light as a feather, stiff as a board" is said and the phrase is chanted by the others repeat. Some people report[1] that the apparent weight of the person lifted seems lower than expected.<br>  <br>  In reality, the participants are tricking their minds, by way of the chanting, into believing that the person being lifted is "light as a feather". The body still reacts to the command from the brain, but the mind perceives it differently. Simply put, five (example) people can easily lift one person, especially when those five people are tricking their minds into thinking that the person is light-weight.[dubious – discuss]<br>  <br>  In one variation the person being lifted is told a story about their death and asked to imagine it happening to him or her. It serves the dual purpose of "freaking out" the participants and convinces the participants that it will be easier to lift this person.<br>  <br>  In many versions, each of the (in the example) five people lifting the other person uses only one or two of his or her fingers on each hand to do the lifting. It is particularly easy to lift a heavy weight when it is evenly distributed amongst a group of four people. The phenomena of the weight seeming less on the second try around or after some sort of ritual is due to increased focus and the "lifters" being more in sync with one another.<br>  <br>  Another reason for the apparent success of the levitation is the "self fulfilling prophecy" concept. The lifters know it's supposed to be heavy and not work the first time so subconsciously they don't put in the effort required to do the lift the first time around. The second time around they are focused and putting in the effort in order to prove to others (and even moreso themselves) that it actually works.|`|HYklfMZ8aa	truth or dare|`|L1Y94qYZaa	girls are not all the same. some enjoy watching movies, some like xbox maybe(im not talking about games like call of duty or left4dead) you can choose sing superstar. some would like to just talk to you. just give her some ideas and she will go along with one!|`|kxzcilZzaa	When I was in High School we played those murder mystery games where everyone is a character, and you get to dress up.

I might be able to actually help you. <br>  <br>  I would not be surprised in the least if one of the dungeon themes, or something similar, sounds like Debussy's work; but, as far as the main theme goes - the answer is no.<br>  <br>  I do have many of the Zelda games, love them, cherish them, etc.<br>  <br>  Court Violinist<br>  <br>  *

Amazon didn't become successful by giving stuff away.<br>  <br>  Secondly, Amazon will have had to pay royalties on these recordings for download. Although the music might be in the public domain, the RECORDINGS have mechanical copyright attached to them (performers need to get paid as well as composers). Also recordings are very expensive to make and that money has to be clawed back from somewhere. So that's what you are paying for.|`|tuATxHsVaa	Are you seriously naive enough to believe that recordings are free to produce? That performers don't need to be paid for their hard work? Concerts should be free?<br>  <br>  I guess when you go to the record store, every CD should be free. Yes, who cares about the thousands of dollars that were fronted so that the CD could be available to consumers? Who cares that the store owners have to pay a lease to keep their shop in business? Who cares that Amazon.com has overhead?<br>  <br>  Where do you get off thinking that anything ought to be free? The stuff on Wikipedia has been placed there because the artists were kind enough to do so for you. <br>  <br>  What a completely naive question that you have come up with here! Amazon is charging money because people put a lot of hard work into the recordings that you are hearing. Isn't it obvious? <br>  <br>  I am one of the people selling music on that website. My hard work and dedication obviously do not matter; I should just live in the street because people like you think that my work ought to be freely available!

You are free to use it because it is considered PUBLIC DOMAIN. However, you would need to pay the orchestra to perform the symphony for your commercial.

QPZrnwP3aa	“Dear Dad Letter”<br>  A father passing by his son’s bedroom was astonished to see the bed was nicely made and everything was picked up. Then he saw an envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow. It was addressed, ‘Dad.’ With the worst premonition, with trembling hands he opened the envelope and read the letter.<br>  <br>  Dear, Dad. It is with great regret and sorrow that I’m writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with mom and you. I’ve been finding real passion with Stacy, and she is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing’s, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than I am. But it’s not only the passion, Dad. She’s pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.<br>  Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn’t really hurt anyone. We’ll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want. In the meantime we’ll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS, so Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it!<br>  Don’t worry Dad, I’m 15 and I know how to take care of myself. Someday we’ll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.<br>  <br>  Love, your son, Joshua.<br>  <br>  PS –  Dad, none of the above is true. I’m over at Jason’s house. I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that’s on the kitchen table. Call when it is safe for me to come home!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  “A Short Love Story”<br>  A man and a woman who had never met before, but who were both married to other people, found themselves assigned to the same sleeping room on a trans-continental train.<br>  Though initially embarrassed and uneasy over sharing a room, they were both very tired and fell asleep quickly, he in the upper berth and she in the lower. <br>  At 1:00 AM, the man leaned down and gently woke the woman saying, “Ma’am, I’m sorry to bother you, but would you be willing to reach into the closet to get me a second blanket? I'm awfully cold.” <br>  “I have a better idea,” she replied. “Just for tonight let’s pretend that we’re married.” <br>  “Wow! That's a great idea!” he exclaimed. <br>  “Good,” she replied. “Get your own damned blanket.” <br>  After a moment of silence… he farted. <br>  The End

ADBMrG87aa	Judge Judy is filmed at the Tribune production studios, now known as Sunset Bronson Studios as of early 2008, on Sunset Boulevard, in Los Angeles, California.<br>  The Judge Judy set is directly beside the Judge Joe Brown set, in the same studios.<br>  Despite its California location, the show displays various images of New York City upon returning from commercial breaks, including a subway train that is passing by the camera which reads World Trade Center, but is only noticeable if the footage is paused. It also features the phrases "State of New York" and "Family Court" (Sheindlin was previously a New York family court judge) within the letterboxes used going to and from breaks since the ninth season. The set features a New York State Flag behind Sheindlin's seat.<br>  <br>  In order to ensure a full audience, the producers of Judge Judy hire extras who comprise the entire gallery. <br>  The phone number for Judge Judy is 1-888-800-JUDY (5839).  Call if you "want justice" or if you want tickets to see a taping of the show.  Though tickets are not offered for the show, arrangements can sometimes be made with Sheindlin's production staff to allow fans of the show into the audience. Once all the cases are through, all of the audience members receive payment.<br>  The extras must be dressed formally. Extras are also instructed to appear as if they are having discussions with each other, before and after each case, so the bailiff may make such announcements as "Order! All rise" and "Parties are Excused, you may step out".<br>  As far as the court cases are concerned however, what is seen on Judge Judy is neither staged nor scripted. The plaintiffs have actually sued the defendants and that very case is heard and decided upon by Judith Sheindlin. <br>  <br>  Here is the postal address forJudge Judy:<br>  <br>  Judge Judy<br>  P.O.

tuvcxnJXaa	I am a Miami Vice junkie, and a disciple of Michael Mann (the show's producer).    He is a *MASTER* at integrating the right song into a scene to set a mood.   <br>  <br>  Jan Hammer was the perfect composer for that series.   He wrote fantastic synth tones that accentuated every scene.    My personal favorites from him are the music from the episodes titled 'Freefall', 'Evan', 'Sons and Lovers', 'Stone's War', and 'Out Where The Buses Don't Run'.   Not all of them used Hammer's music exclusively, but they're excellent examples of how Mann uses music to complement a scene.<br>  <br>  If you like the Miami Vice-style of music/scene marriage, then you should check out Mann's films 'Heat' and 'Collateral'.   Both are EXCELLENT movies that also use music quite well in each scene.    I had really high hopes for the movie : Mann directed, the casting of Foxx and Farrell were perfect, but the movie was just mediocre, IMO.|`|RT7iHMc1aa	Sorry don't know about the dramatic flashback music but I do know there's about two Audioslave songs in there somewhere - I think there's "Broken City" and "The Shape of Things To Come". Brilliant songs. :-)|`|AA11332035	I love Miami Vice too, and watched the first episode when it came out. I have a Miami Vice (2) cd, and my favorite is Crockett's Theme. I think Jan Hammer is the best. I heard they tried to get him to play the soundtrack for the movie, but he was unavailable. I thought the movie was a big disappointment. And it was shocking that Michael Mann directed that garbage. I could compare it to the new Star Wars movies and the old ones. The old ones you loved the characters. They were funny, you cared about them, and they were larger than life. Same thing with Miami Vice. And Collin Farrell did Sonny Crockett all wrong. He tried to play him completely serious and it didn't work. And why didn't he light up some cigarettes. He is a real life smoker, and I thought it added a lot of style when Don Johnson (Sonny) did it.|`|dFacbjIZaa	That would be Me as well.<br>  <br>  Some of My favorite songs featured on Miami Vice include<br>  <br>  In The Air Tonight - Phil Collins<br>  I Don't Care Anymore - Phil Collins<br>  Voices - Russ Ballard<br>  Cry - Godley & Creme<br>  <br>  Micheal Mann is fantastic Deke, I agree.|`|qaAW9VN4aa	Jan Hammer was the main music maker(?), but I do believe Glenn Frey may have done a song or two for the show as well as Phil Collins

lpyWVR2oaa	This placement on its own is by no means a cause for concern when it comes to sexual matters. Virgo is afterall an Earth sign which very much senses-oriented. Unlike the Fire signs which can start off things dramatically, Mars in Virgo actually has a better chance of finishing things because of its more contemplative, analytical nature. It may not be the most ardent and exciting of lovers, but it has a sensual, earthy considerate tone to it.<br>  <br>  However, the tendency to vacillate when it comes to initiation can be a problem and this is often offset by stronger influences to the chart like conjunctions. If you have planets like Pluto conjunct Mars, you will force that being forceful and determined when needed is not a problem. So, look to the other influences in your chart to offset this.|`|2HN1oivUaa	WDF>i am sorry,what kind of question is this huh?if u need an answer to questions of this sort,ask google...please and please,don't bore people.thank u.<br>  at least,i have earned my points so my time isn't all that wasted.
E2VUH8Q0aa	lol... I really love the array of answers you got on this question. Very interesting.<br>  <br>  Well, first off, compatibility in astrology has practically nothing to do with you or your husband's primary (Sun) signs. Obviously, if it's working, it's working, right? The neat thing about astrology is that I could take your entire chart and compare it to your husband's entire chart and tell you all kinds of eerily correct things about your relationship...what works, what doesn't, what brought you together, how you get along, etc.<br>  The astrology chart is really just a graphical reflection of what is already there. Nature allows us enough common sense to tell if things are going well in the course of building a relationship. The star charts just reflect that.<br>  <br>  So, in relationships that are working, astrology really doesn't mean a thing...<br>  <br>  But where astrology does help is when things aren't going so well. Then an astrologer can look at the stars that are causing that affect and give you insight into what can make things better, how long it's going to last, what's coming next, what parts of your life are clashing...<br>  <br>  That can be helpful somethings.  I know that when I met my mate 10 years ago I didn't need a star chart to tell me he was the right one. But along the way, studying our transits has helped me be patient with changes and shifting attitudes in our lives, and has helped me better understand him and what motivates him and things I can do to help him get where he wants to go.|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	Never, ever let Astrology affect your way of thinking. If it says that 2 particular signs are not compatible, its only a guide, not something at should be viewed as the truth, because everyone is different. I honestly don't believe in a lot of cases that it affects realtionships at all. And anyone that claims it does, are just looking for something to blame when things don't work out. I'm sure you and your husband will continue to be very happy regardless of what the stars say!!!|`|4t4U9eFOaa	I think that your signs can help you better understand the ins and outs of the relationship on a general note.  My husband are not compatible sign-wise and we struggle at times but just because our signs are not compatible does not mean that it is doomed.  On the other hand sign compatibilitly can help you better understand inexplicable things like chemistry.  Also it depends on where your birthday lands within the sign..example, I am scorpio (12th of november and am a total scorpion) but my best friend is scorpio (21st of nove) and tends to lean towards the next sign.  Go figure.|`|veeC7Rvvaa	Astrology takes as much part in your life as you allow it to.. if you were a firm believer in the stars, you'd get into the relationship with a negative pessimist view from the start, and whenever anything however small goes wrong, you blame it to your clashes of the signs. <br>  Im with a compatible (astrology wise) partner, I'm not sure if astrology has anything to do with it though.|`|ccOJn7q8aa	How can astrology make any sense and affect millions of people all in the same way.<br>  <br>  For example, if a soldier in iraq read todays paper "he would be in luck with finally getting closer to that loved one"<br>  <br>  is he gonna die?<br>  turn gay and hump another soldier?<br>  elope with an iraqi woman?<br>  <br>  then read the same message to a woman in palestine or an old man in ethiopia or a peasant living on the streets.|`|W7l1awFPaa	I have no idea where people ever came up with the idea the huge balls of flaming gas in the sky that we call stars have any affect on our lives or why.  I personally think all of astrology is rubbish.  There may even be a demonic element to it, which would explain its occasional accuracy when coincidence doesn't.|`|iHJuXKBiaa	Well the hubby and I have been together for almost 14yrs...and we're both Aries. Stubborn, angry, and very fcukable. Maybe more research needs to be done. You and I seem to get along ok, though we just met. Definitely more research.|`|vdmqdlNfaa	Anything that you take serious or believe in can affect you / your personality or your relationship.  Stay away from superstition pls.|`|qmY9Nuxkaa	If you and you husband are happy together why would you even care what a book says. Not all Leos or all cancers are the same. I don't think it has much to do with relationships unless you dwell on it and keep focusing on what that book says. Concentrate on your marriage, the love, respect and passion and forget about the book.<br>  By the way I'm a Sagittarius and my husband is a Virgo, every book I've read has been completely right about our personality, likes and dislikes. It also says we aren't compatible but we have been married 10 years have 3 kids and are immensely happy. I have to say I have dated 6 other Virgos and it was DISASTER.<br>  So don't feed  into it. Not everyone is the same. A book can't tell you about your marrigae or relationship unless you or your husband wrote it.|`|z5WNJkx9aa	It is my personal opinion that astrology plays as important a part as you're willing to give it.  If you feel like you need something outside of your relationship to define it, then you may feel that someone saying you don't belong together might be right.  Rely on your instincts and what works for you.|`|mUhZxm8Jaa	I honestly don't think astrology has any impact, anything it says it's not the true.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	In my experience not much! I am supposed to be ultra compatible with Cancer but my last boyfriend was a Cancer and we had a horrible relationship. Also, I'm not supposed to get along with other Scorpios but I had a great relationship with one when I was younger. I think a lot of it holds true for me personality wise but the compatibility with other signs never seems to be accurate.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	my hubby and I are both virgos and I read something once that said while virgos will clash and argue a lot virgos work well together because we can get over the fights quickly and move on. so far that is what happens . lol <br>  <br>  I think there is some truth in them but they should be taken with a grain of salt.|`|531f08d2bae7afb19dbace61520eb62caa	Astrology is ancient, made-up, unproven, and bigoted. No one has control over when they are born. To be stereotyping people this way, with no evidence is a bigotry similar to sexism and racism. The weird part is this bigotry is accepted and desired. Take away the stereotyping and you won't have astrology.<br>  <br>  If you believe in free will, astrology is pointless.|`|ykIleAQ7aa	Well as long as you're not looking at surface stuff like sun signs then it can be  very helpful tool. Your whole chart makes up your personality not just your sun sign. So you probably have a compatible chart your rising, moon and venus may be making up for the Leo/Cancer differences.|`|AA12145826	Well I'm a Sagittarius & he's a Leo and supposedly our signs work well together (which baffles me since my sign is the hunter & he's a lion...so wouldn't it be the hunter & the prey, unless of course we're BOTH considered hunters.....I think I'm giving way too much thought into this). We've been together for 9 years, married for 7, so I guess there could be some truth to it. Who knows? It wasn't one of my criteria in looking for a mate, that's for sure.|`|uuK5lYsjaa	Well me and my bf's signs were supposed to be very compatible and we had an fuggin ELECTRIC connection if you know what i mean...it was amazing. But we hate each other now so idk "/

JlYqg8z8aa	nicki's famous for being paris's sister.<br>  paris was a model first and therefore was in the spotlight.  She's done all forms of entertainment - fashion, porn, films, tv, music, parties, etc therefore she will be more famous then a wannabe designer.<br>  I think your trying to say Nicki is more hotter than paris, I believe so to.|`|BVkQzUBZaa	Cause she does anything for attention & is known for being a bit of a sl**g!|`|mqThT5rZaa	She has a sister?|`|d6Y9N2p1aa	a night in paris|`|YXCDdDKIaa	b/c she puts herself out there.|`|Bi51WJd7aa	Nicky is DEAD boring. Just looking at her face is like looking at a sheet of white paper! She seems to have no personality and/or interesting qualities whatsoever. Paris on the otherhand (although she is kind of a dumba** and skank), is very crazy, silly and out there. I hate to admit this but I actually like her a little ha ha ha. I think the fact that she had a platform like 'The Simple Life' helped her out LOADS!

Anyway i think everyone is forgetting about that now, and now she stays popular because she is who she is , not because of a video.|`|MNPWJPWhaa	Paris is more popular than her sister because Paris is a bad role-model and she thinks that she's hot herself and she was drink-driving, so everybody thinks she is gangster, while her little sister hasn't done any wrong things yet and there are no rumors about her at the moment. Plus, Paris tries to sing when she can't.|`|ODcJyxFIaa	shes more popular because she came 'on the scene' much earlier than Nicky.

rNqF4gIVaa	I must confess... I love his first one. It is so creative and original. I expect most people to say Nine - it is the one that to some degree epitomizes Mahler's work.<br>  I am also fond of Five, but number one was the first work of his that I heard and its impression has endured.|`|tuATxHsVaa	I have fond memories of playing Mahler's 5th with Larry Livingston. For that reason, it has become my favorite of his symphonies. I love the Scherzo movement.<br>  <br>  Here is a link with Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic performing this *true* masterpiece:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOUw50gCCNc&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOUw50gCC...</a><br>  <br>  Mahler is well known for quoting the melodies of other composers. You'll find a more-than-obvious reference to Beethoven's 5th in this symphony. Shall we call Mahler a copycat? I think not. He was an absolute genius of the orchestral language.<br>  <br>  Court Violinist<br>  <br>  *|`|xcPzZvsraa	I must protest at Doctor John's fatuous remark as regards the ninth being codswallop.<br>  What!<br>  Personally I think it one of the greatest symphonies ever composed.<br>  However even if it is not to ones liking I think none of us are in a position to question the genius of Gustav Mahler and disparage this unquestionable masterpiece so discourteously and severely with such a flippant put down. <br>  <br>  Incidentally back to your question my favourite is the 2nd "Resurrection".<br>  The final few minutes of the choral ending is just bliss and has moved me to tears  on more than a few occasions.<br>  The 9th is my second best.|`|onTIKM8iaa	5th no doubt. I would love to have the first movement played at my funeral|`|jR8kyp0Taa	They are all masterpieces and anyone who says anything against them should be put in prison for life.<br>  <br>  Mahler was the best composer since Beethoven. <br>  <br>  But to answer your question, my favorite is - <br>  <br>  WAIT a minute, I can't choose a favorite because to choose one over the others would be to commit blasphemy against Mahler and his masterful symphonies. I can't in good conscience do this. <br>  <br>  BW<br>  <br>  EDIT: I'll give in and agree with Malcolm. The first is the one I knew first and I'll always have a special love for it. The 9th and the 5th are his two best works. <br>  <br>  I don't know what del meant by the "rambling" 4th movt of the 1st, but the form is clearly visible to me. I can sit here and give you the "A-B...etc" format of the entire movt without hearing it, I know it that well. The form may be a little more complex than you're used to but it isn't "rambling". In fact I think the 9th does a better job of "rambling" than anywhere in the 1st.<br>  <br>  BW|`|TiDFGqIEaa	i love AR.RAHMAN MUSIC.HE IS GIGUNDO WONDERFUL|`|373KJjiOaa	His 4th and 5th are my favorite.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	The 1st, and even that is a re-hashing ...Listen out for Tchaikovsky tributes in all his symphonies...I like the second and the opening of the 5th. The 9th is utter codswallop. Try Strauss for a more coherent and mature effort in a similar vein, without the longeurs.<br>  <br>  [note]<br>  <br>  Take the apostrophe from "Symphonies" and place it in "What's"|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	You really do need to brush-up on your use of apostrophes (which are all back-to-front right now). It doesn't lend credence to your question, you know.<br>  <br>  Like mephisto, I am aghast at Doctor John's dismissal of the Ninth. Two months ago I answered a question asking contributors to put the Mahler symphonies in order of preference. I think the order has changed a little since then (it probably changes every day!), but, for what it's worth, my list today would be:<br>  <br>  9 - powerful, disturbing, heartbreaking<br>  10 - agonised, disturbed, the last movement always reduces me to tears<br>  2 - the last movement just transports you somewhere else<br>  6 - 'Classical' in structure. Love the relentless marching of the 1st movement and the drama of the 4th (in which order do you think the middle two movements should be?)<br>  7 - weird and wonderful. Underrated<br>  3 - HUGE, divine, satisfying<br>  4 - his 'chamber' symphony, full of hidden depths<br>  5 - a little overplayed, perhaps but the central scherzo is masterful<br>  1 - again, overplayed. I like the original version (1889) with 'Blumine'. Makes sense of the rambling 4th movement<br>  8 - beautiful moments - I just find the structure a little creaky

It plugs into a filter which plugs into the phone jack. The filter has a place for your phone to plug in and one for your computer modem chord. That way you can be on line and still get phone calls. For whatever reason every now and then if you have trouble getting on line you can pull out the round plug (power chord) for about 20 to 50 seconds then plug it back in. The lights on the front will come back on. When they are lit and steady (not blinking or flashing) which may take a couple of minutes you should be able to get on line.

Willis ha sempre più o meno fatto lo stesso ruolo, non ha variato molto le interpretazioni.<br>  ci sono attori ben migliori che meriterebbero più attenzione e altri che sono sopravvalutati. <br>  inoltre gaurdando i film in versione originale mi sono resa conto che molti attori non erano poi così bravi, e altri invece che ci perdevano col doppiaggio. ora non so se tu guardi i film doppiati o meno, ma se li guardi doppiati come fai a dire se un attore é bravo o no? puoi giudicare solo la sua mimica, e ci vuole ben altro per essere un bravo attore.|`|b8f8e8fc767e1b2647b77a95b17e7c16aa	Certo!|`|bbbaaf979d388c09743bbd0256583d7caa	E' solo questione di tempo!<br>  Quelli ke tu hai nominato hanno cominciato molto prima di lui!<br>  Ora è il suo momento! Tanti film. Bei film. Una faccia da qulo adatta praticamente a qualsiasi ruolo. E poca concorrenza!<br>  Fra qualke anno, diranno ke era uno dei migliori (se non il migliore) degli anni 80-90 e seguenti... <br>  Ogni epoca ha i suoi...  :)<br>  Ciao.

9d7b9b5f13e6fefe5ca4f26548f5c302aa	Actually, yes.  I had the opportunity to be on her show several years ago when her guest was the late Barry White (a big man).  I had the chance to meet Barry and danced on the floor of her studio with several others.  <br>  <br>  She is very disconnected with her studio audience.  This was evident when the cameras were not rolling.  I didn't expect her to come up to me and give me a hug, but she could have been more cordial to the people who came to support her show.<br>  <br>  Barry on the other hand was a pure gentleman.  We spoke for a couple of minutes during a break and he thanked me for supporting his music.  That was honorable in my opinion.|`|ecc564a3869cafbbc06a98a7db815d2faa	ya that junk off the chian if ur in the audiance u get free stuff.|`|fc24c8cb8f46a7412ed873d09bdbe1b6aa	I don't really watch that much of her show.

So, the best course of action is to NOT tell them you know.|`|AA12135515	I don't know that song.

rsg0zBT6aa	That's tough.  On one hand I love swing jazz, on the other hand I love Irish jigs and reels (along with most other Irish instrumental music).  It's hard for me to give just one answer, so I think I'll give both;<br>  swing jazz and Irish music.<br>  <br>  Above both of those though, Classical (in the broad sense) takes the cake (and pie...and tart...and maybe even the cookie...)|`|70jNDiIiaa	Well, when I'm not listening to Baroque, Renaissance or Mediaeval music, I'm hoovering up folk music - especially Irish, Scottish, Breton music, Baltic, Indian, Mongolian, Norwegian and Macedonian. I have a huge obsession with bagpipes, bladder pipes, shawms and reed pipes - I play a rohrpill [reed pipe] in an Estonian folk ensemble, which includes two bagpipers - ear-splitting stuff!!!<br>  <br>  And I've been mad about heavy metal since I was 13 or 14. Not sure what the connection is between Metallica and bagpipes...maybe it's the loudness factor - kind of makes up for the Baroque bassoon's distinct lack of volume!<br>  <br>  I love Bluegrass - especially the banjo (Earl Scruggs is one of my many heroes!)<br>  <br>  And I must make a confession here - I'm a closet ABBA fan...<br>  <br>  Fun question - thanks!<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Hafwen.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	A toss-up between Baroque and late-romantic, but I don't suppose that that is what you meant! No capital C required boys, he didn't ask about Western Art music, did he ? classical in its broad sense refers to the whole of the classical period surely, he says playing Devil's advocate.|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	Yes, come on, Doctor John; you can do better than that! Outside 'classical' (small 'c') music, I probably like progressive rock best (King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd) and rock such as Led Zeppelin. I also like (modern) jazz, good pop and film music.|`|b6cd9d6fe5a0ec1d495444c45c2b75f2aa	My favorite genre? After classical, I listen to a lot of soundtrack music. Mostly from musicals but it also expands to movies too. I have music from Phantom, Rent, Music Man, Dirty Dancing, Les Miz, Pride and Prejudice, and more. <br>  <br>  I also love Billy Joel. He's classified as rock on itunes. But that is pretty much all the rock I listen to other than the christian music. For christian, it covers a wide range to Family Force 5 to Relient K to Rebecca St.James.|`|CuMYdQV6aa	I recently purchased a CD of folk music collected by Bartok in eastern Europe as a young man and  have been absolutely entranced by it, so after classical it has to be 'authentic' folk music. But where do we place Steve Reich? Classical? - hardly. Fascinating? - certainly.|`|qswrz268aa	Dear Doctor, do remember capital C Classical music is referring to the period of music within the lower c classical genre.

By narrow(er) definitions, I like... Epic Trance, Hard Trance, Hands Up, Full On, Goa Trance, Nitzhonot, Vocal Trance, Hardstyle, Deep Trance, Progressive Trance, and Suomisaundi. There's a few other styles of electronic music I like, and I like certain composers from the Romantic period, as well, as some more modern classical composers, and some assorted jazz, ethnic, rock, metal, operatic, and 80's tunes.|`|AA10125474	Jazz of any kind.<br>  <br>  Swing -- I grew up listening to Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman.<br>  <br>  Show tunes<br>  <br>  Blue grass.

I don't know why but when people pay you a compliment, you're first instinct is to compliment them back or respond with something that takes the compliment away (i.e. "really? i think this looks hideous on me") rather than accept the compliment and just say "thank you". <br>  <br>  As far as women go, I think they just respond to compliments this way more often than men, but I wouldn't say they get offended. Especially to the point of wanting to start a fight. But again, I'm not so sure what it is you're saying to these women.|`|KkyrUPiuaa	Depends what the condition is, are you friends with the person or just a stranger,<br>  I personally get annoyed when random guys give me compliments on my physical apperance, because you don't know who they are and they could possibly be a creep.

FcboZvrSaa	Considering the target audience it tries to reach out to, it's a great song - bang on in terms of tone, style and lyrics. Musically too, it is very engaging with an extremely soothing blend of acoustic guitars (I think at least one guitar is a 12-string jumbo) and a minimalist bongo back beat.<br>  <br>  Do remember, it was intended for a young campus audience, so the BC, MC stuff is quite appropriate in terms of communicating the smoker's angst over being caught by his Abba, thwarted by his girlfriend and distracted by his wife.<br>  <br>  It would have been a bad song if it had a lousy tune and mindless lyrics with cuss words thrown in just for shock value... like a lot of rap songs these days. But since that isn't the case, sit back and enjoy it - and listen in the right spirit, without being either moralistic or judgemental. It's a fun song so just hang easy!|`|AA11126723	are you like a kid or somethin..pervert..lolol<br>  its a hell of a good song|`|WCHxuF5Kaa	ITS ONE HELL OF A GOOD SONG|`|u28afMOXaa	it's not at all bad.<br>  why do u feel that it's bad. if u feel so coz they had not used relevant words, generally people use this language in their daily life.<br>  but when they listen this they say its bad. they knew what kind of song is this still they listen this song. what has gone to people. why can't they behave in their true manner.<br>  by the way this song has great music, guitaring i love the song.|`|HjVdtEfQaa	I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE IN OTHER COUNTRIES IT IS MINOR COZ THE PEOPLE ARE BROAD MINDED  N HI-FI      BUT IN INDIA THE PUBLICS ARE MORE CONCERNED ABT THEIR CULTURE SO THEY USE TO APPRECIATE ONLY BHAJANS.BUT I LIKE THIS SONG AND APPRECIATE IT.

AA11312536	if you have enough money, take vocal lessons because it will really help your posture which helps you sing better and you will learn how to stand correctly and learn how to use your voic. DONT drink soda or any caffeinated/carbonated drink before an audition..... it makes it harder to sing. drink water. and eatinig whise...eat a light breakfast/lunch/dinner because you dont want anything heavy or else if you get nervous it wont be pretty.|`|08fa71676b9e8c2a8fc22cc9df2c310daa	yes there are lots of ways to improve your singing voice. posture warming up many things. drink hot tea with honey dont drink dairy products and never clear yout throat!|`|42f33d83d9bedfab3070ed2d99c983dfaa	thunder_kok says don't gargle with broken glass|`|bb26167895ba6c2e6ee27d536b17c1c2aa	Posture and breathing are two things you can fix to get results instantly.  <br>  <br>  If you haven't ever taken any lessons...look into it.  There are tons of things you can learn from a private instructer that wouldn't occur to you otherwise.  <br>  <br>  If you can't afford that, join a community or church choir.  The directors are always happy to pass on tips to singers.|`|21f5438ee5b83682bf60285dd04ff8b0aa	are you a singer?well every time i perform i drink water. Never drink soda or eat sugar, candy. <br>  <br>  If you have a sore throat and you have to perform drink  honey with lemon it completly clears your throat.|`|AA10042480	If you're talking about improving your ability to sustain breath, bridge the gap between head and chest voice, and improve your vocal range, then yes you can.  I have a vocal warm-up CD that I got from www.singers.com  click on the link that says "Improve Your Singing Voice" and you will find instructional materials.  I bought the Pop Singers Warm Up Kit and will not go and do a gig without using it.<br>  <br>  Before an audition, you should stay away from dairy products, spicy foods, harsh throat clearing, smoking, yelling over loud music, etc.  And don't ever eat and then take a nap immediately afterward, you could develop acid reflux.<br>  <br>  If you are in a part of the country that is experiencing a major heatwave, be careful using a lot of air-conditioning - it messes with your voice.|`|4c6210a60520446edc5b3b9a7a3a71f8aa	yes, there are many vocal exercises that can strengthan your voice.  It's best to consult an expert because you can also damage your vocal cords if you do them incorrectly. Sit-ups and abdomen exercises are also good because you will need  strong abs to support your diaphragm.<br>  <br>  Avoid milk and dairy products before an audition sunce they can coat your throat.  Drink lots of clear liquids. A cup of herbal tea is good.|`|AA10831218	Don't smoke or drink coke....

Travis Barker (Blink-182) has also recorded drums for Lavigne's new album. On July 10, 2006, Avril Lavigne answered a Q&A on her official website stating that her next CD will be released in the first half of next year, most likely April. Avril says that her new album will contain love songs since 'that's what I'm feeling at the moment' and that she enjoys being able to write songs with Butch Walker. It is said on her message board on her official website that her new album will contain 15 songs. "Of course, I still have my boy-bashing songs, but they're very playful. So the record is really fun and cool and different and honestly, I think it's my best record yet. I can say that with confidence." Posted on her MySpace blog she revealed that the first single from the album will be "Girlfriend", which is due to be released in February.<br>  <br>   <br>  "Girlfriend" single cover."Keep Holding On", a single playing on radio in North America, will be on the album in addition to being featured on the Eragon soundtrack. It has been said on a fansite that filming for the video for the first single off The Best Damm Thing, Girlfriend, will commence in mid-January. The song will be played for the first time on radio in the USA on January 29, 2007.|`|AA10023162	AVRIL LAVIGNE <br>  <br>  The Best Dam Thing (RCA, date TBA) <br>  <br>  This curiously spelled April release will be preceded by the single "Girlfriend" in February and also features contributions from Lavigne's husband, Sum 41's Derryck Whibley, as well as +44 drummer Travis Barker. <br>  <br>  "It is really fast, fun, young, bratty, aggressive, confident (and) cocky in a playful way . . . all the good stuff," Lavigne wrote on her MySpace page earlier this month, adding that she was inspired to make a more uptempo album after spending "so much of my time playing live shows. I wanted to make sure the songs were fun -- fun for the fans and myself. I will only have, like, three slow songs on the record." <br>  <br>  "The Best Dam Thing" will be the follow-up to 2004's "Under My Skin," which debuted at No. 1 on The Billboard 200 and has sold 2.93 million copies.

E7smxUOZaa	Shameless is brill, ive watched every episode of every series since it started. Its tried to be based on the roughest estate in uk. It can take things seriously but not all the time they turn it into humour like the 'make poverty history, cheaper drugs now' its just a joke really, a typical frank thing. I thing soaps are too over dramatic with the big issues that are similar to the ones in shameless, it kind of puts you off like telling the truth or something like that. I find the comedys/(not sure what to class shameless as) that face the issue's seem to be more realistic and more incouraging, apart from the smoking and taking drugs.  Shameless has been going for a good few years, and still hasn't been axed, the writers and cast must be doing something right. David threlful (frank gallagher) is perfect for his role, and he does put people off doing things like he does. its great.|`|AA11134979	shameless is excellent but wouldnt hold it up as an influencial programme that normally goes to soaps like doctors and neighbours and home and away and hollyoaks .
XlPuguBAaa	Bex...<br>  <br>  With concerts (depending on who it performing and the genre of the music) there are usually seated areas and a standing area.<br>  <br>  The o2 arena... if you imagine a huge rectangular shape on the floor infront of where the stage would be then thousands of tiers of seats going up the side.<br>  <br>  When you are standing at a concert you will be next to people.. however u can usually choose whether u want to be surrounded by loads of people or not.  When standing.. most people will want to be in the centre or at the front so that they can see well.  However you will therefore be able to just stand around the sides or near the back.. and u will still be able to see really well because they have loads of big screens in the o2.<br>  <br>  Snow patrol arent too much of a heavy rock band either so you prob wont get crazy people dancing and moshing in the middle...<br>  <br>  You should be fine :)  <br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|BVkQzUBZaa	Ive been to a concert at the 02 and i have to say, it was brilliant in there, but i did get a bit crammed! you can stand anywhere you like really though, as long as you get a good place to stand you will have a great time! otherwise, if you know you really dont like standing in big crouds then i would give it a miss or pay for a seated ticket. <br>  <br>  I recommend going though! Maybe be a bit squashed for one night only.. ! :) x|`|Ty4UC8GLaa	usually concerts have seats around the sides and general admission (standing) is in the middle. so you wont have a specific spot to stand but people do get a bit crazy at concerts and will probably be pushing and rushing around,|`|paV2LdR9aa	Hiya, I saw the foo fighters there last year. The standing area is huge. You don't get a specific place to stand, you can wander free range! It depends where you stand as to whether it's crammed or not. If you go to the front, you will usually get squashed in the mosh pit, however I think moshing is unlikely with Snow Patrol! Standing anywhere else other than the very front it'll be easy going, you can just stand and watch.<br>  Also don't get dressed up, not because you'll get dirty, but because there's no point. You'll be on your feet all night so go for slacks and trainers. Comfort! <br>  Oh and I saw snow patrol a few years ago, really good show. Have a nice time!<br>  <br>  Ps - a mosh pit is basically where people (usually young lads!) all dance around like crazy, pushing and jumping into eachother. It can be fun, but you do see a lot of bleeding noses! Hehe. But you won't get caught up in it unless you want to.<br>  Probably best to steer clear ;-)|`|AA11353245	Standing generally means that you stand on the floor in front of the stage, usually with a seated balcony depending on the venue.  There tends to be no specific spot where you stand, just on the floor in general.<br>  <br>  You can get crammed in, especially in smaller venues or more popular bands, at open air shows it's not so much of a problem, but if you're that claustrophobic you may have issues.  <br>  <br>  If there's a mosh pit then standing at the edge can afford you some breathing room, but you run the risk of getting sucked (read: pushed) in or otherwise involved.|`|luTfdMETaa	hey, so ye i cant even count how many gig tickets iv got but mostly in glasgow anyway, you will prob be crammed but it depends what band you are going to see and also where you stand.<br>  <br>  i usually go to the front and for a band like machine head you have to be ready for a mosh pit,which people headbang and wel push each other about lol<br>  ,but when i was at Apocalyptica every1 was just standing singing lol.<br>  so is the band metal?<br>  <br>  and also if you stand abit further back there will be no pushing or whatever.....i think you should just crowd surf? lol. anyways ye you should go and have fun,it will be ok :P x
9cbe00a623e00870564e47287ec3d838aa	I would say the video ipod because it holds so much music. it holds pics and videos (duh) but if you dont need 7,500 songs your best bet is the nano. it is so small and you can get up to like 6 gigs. (thats 1500 songs) it holds pictures also but the screen is so small. if you want to get an Ipod for fitness (cycling, running, working out) i recomend the suffule because you can pick and choose your favorite songs and it is so light you wont even know it is there. If you need more than 7500 songs i reccomend the 60 gig ( 15000 songs ) well I hope you use the information i gave you to the best possible way!!!|`|AA11303908	ipod nano coz thats the one i have and its fab|`|0290ffa62443cd678b332f3f0a70388eaa	the video ipod looks like it has everything. music and tv shows.|`|AA10371281	They are all good for different reasons!<br>  <br>  <br>  1.  If you like small and conveniant things, the shuffle is the best.<br>  <br>  <br>  2.  If you like small, sleek, but with a screen on it, try the nano.<br>  <br>  <br>  3.  If you want your iPod to play videos and have the latest and <br>       advanced technology, you should definately go for the video<br>       iPod.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!  = )|`|AA12142677	I think that the really important thing to think about is how much space you need and what you're going to do with it.

4bFypdGLaa	You draw a demo. And go to either the publisher you have in mind or to a manga-magazine where you get one or two pages to display your work, of course they don't take all demos (and it depends on the popularity of the magazine how good your drawings and story have to be and in some they don't accept all ideas. exmp If you have a girl-manga idea go to a Shoujo-manga themed magazine) and publishers either contact you or not after seeing it, and again the popular magazine artist are more likely to be contacted.<br>  But that's the Japanese way. If you don't live there I'd advise you to post it online and promote it like hell so people will notice you or get permission to sell it at anime-con near you. Or move to Japan.... and get a Pen-name people will hate the Idea of talented non-Japanese artists... But then again I don't know if your talented or not, If your aren't above average as an artist and script writer I'd find another profession.<br>  <br>  More on how it's made. Black 'n white ink, pencils, pens, screen tones, photocopier, photo-shop and so on is stuff you can or must use in making manga. And when you draw; draw on A4 and keep in mind not to fill in the paper, have a good 2 or 3 cm between your drawing and the border, because things can get cut off once you've shrunk them on the computer to A3 and stat puting the book together. And always put much care in to stuff like spelling and 3D (common sense people don't read things where the character don't fit into the scenery or when it has bad spelling).<br>   <br>  good luck|`|HNaeWVHKaa	Try this here or others:<br>  <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/geek/tetrisnomiko/mangaka/becomemangaka.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/geek/tetrisnomi...</a><br>  <br>  Generally as far as I remember from an article I read a while back you create a storyboard; do quick sketches and submit it to a publisher who will then either reply saying they are interested in publishing your work or not.

LwqM7EHVaa	torrentz.com|`|3w7ekDQJaa	youtube?|`|yTNLYRLAaa	There are two definitive Springsteen sites that detail  *everything* about Mr. Springsteen, including almost every show he has played since the 1960s, and the set lists.  <br>  <br>  Type into google:<br>  <br>  Greasy Lake<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  Brucelegs<br>  <br>  You cannot legally download his officially released albums for free, but they are readily available for download for as little as $7.92, for Born to Run, which only has eight (great) songs, at iTunes, or download or purchase hard copies at Amazon or Springsteen's own web site, Springsteen.net.<br>  <br>  Springsteen.net lists all 24 albums, inluding the songs on each.  It also allows you to find any song, or to search songs by typing in a name or a lyric.  He has about 275 officially released songs.<br>  <br>  The latest tidbit in his personal blog is a decription of what it was like to play the superbowl.<br>  <br>  For news,<br>  <br>  Backstreets.com is probably the definitive site.<br>  <br>  No one has been bootlegged as extensively as Bruce Springsteen.  Something like 1,894 of 1,900 shows since the 1960s are available, somewhere.  Most are poor quality recordings, but the best are *really really* good.<br>  <br>  If you want to download, legally and free, some of the very best of these shows, join the Yahoo listserve, "brucesplace."  They are making available for download some of Bruce's classic shows.  Right now five of the best are available - again, absolutely legal and free.<br>  <br>  3/25/77, Forced to Confess, Boston Music Hall - thought by many to be his best pre-Darkness (on the Edge of Town) show. <br>  <br>  9/19/78, Piece de Resistance, Darkness on the Edge of Town tour, Capital Theater, Passaic, New Jersey.  One of five Darkness shows that was broadcast on radio stations throughout the region of the country of the show.  Arguably the best Darkness boot, since the sound is a soundboard mix, whereas most boots are audience recordings (although they can be nearly as good, too).  Many fans believe this is his greatest bootlegged show, period, regardless of the tour..<br>  <br>  8/1/99, The Reunion Tour, The Meadowlands, NJ.  The E-Street Band had not played with Bruce, on tour, since 1988.  After 36 sold-out shows in Europe, he opened a long, successful tour of north America with 15 sold-out shows at the 20,000 seat Meadowlands Arena, across the river from NY City.  This is the 8th, or middle, show.<br>  <br>  11/19/84, Born in the USA tour, Kansas City.  This tour (and the 25 million albums sold worlwide) revealed the secret to the entire world.  This guy put on the greatest show on earth. He played the greatest rock & roll that had ever been, or ever would be. This tour, these shows, made Bruce Springsteen the biggest rock star in the world.<br>  <br>  4/5/08, Magic tour, San Jose.  I have never seen anyone, including Bruce Springsteen, put on a more intense rock show than the Magic shows.  Over the hill?  Past his prime?  Those comments generally come from people who don't believe the first amendment applies to everyone. i.e., who do not like his political positions and comments.<br>  <br>  After joining brucesplace - it's free - go to the homepage and use the search engine to find the posts which have the download locations.  They are all recent.  You should be able to type the show date, or location, into the search engine, to find them.<br>  <br>  More classic Bruce Springsteen bootlegs will be made available on brucesplace in the months to come.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|KQy7b8ooaa	... and for LEGAL downloading, try Amazon.com (if US resident) or CDUniverse.com

It plugs into a filter which plugs into the phone jack. The filter has a place for your phone to plug in and one for your computer modem chord. That way you can be on line and still get phone calls. For whatever reason every now and then if you have trouble getting on line you can pull out the round plug (power chord) for about 20 to 50 seconds then plug it back in. The lights on the front will come back on. When they are lit and steady (not blinking or flashing) which may take a couple of minutes you should be able to get on line. Got the info from our tech support from our provider. It will only help if the problem is at your end. Let me know if it helps.<br>  Beecher I love your technical talk.

c87ce36c84967079e9aeb1bd8fd8ceb4aa	Your teacher should be growing with you as you progress.  Pushing you and challenging you.  It doesn't seem like he is if he is not letting you move on.  I would recommend getting a new instructor who has confidence in you.  After all, it's your dream to go to a music school, so you need someone who will prepare you for that.  It doesn't sound like your current instructor is doing that.  But don't forget...you also have to push and challenge yourself or else you can't improve and be better and everything you want to be.<br>  <br>  Good luck! =)|`|7b0b433fc2ed18711817566f70b363c6aa	Well.... if he feels that you can't get any better...<br>  I suggest getting a new instructor.

When your feelings get hurt, it wounds you deeply and you never forget a misdeed done against you. You learn to hide your pain well, but you are not above seeking revenge. You will wait years for the opportunity. You are passionate about everything you say and do and you don't believe in hiding the truth behind alot of sweet talk. <br>  <br>  Libra-attracts you to kind honest romantic people. You like people with intelligence and fairness. <br>  <br>  Aquarius-People see you as highly intelligent, but also cool and aloof. You care deeply about your fellow man, and yet most times you will be able to pull yourself away from being involved in their problems.<br>  <br>  Your sun is squared with your ascendant, so your general nature often clashes with how people see you.<br>  <br>  This is the best I could do and how I see it anyway...hope it makes sense to you.

OWdoFmKqaa	Hmm..<br>  ...trying to think of the right words to describe it. <br>  <br>  Not exactly my field of experience, but rather plain interest. Interesting? Very much so. I took it as a poem at first, read it twice, once with a tune in mind as put in a song and once as a sweet and simple melody as some sort of rhyme. <br>  <br>  "And day by day we go about<br>  Running, running, we’ll stop to shout<br>  Help!

Then it went..somber-right after that- the last few paragraphs or stanzas I mean.<br>  <br>  Eh..<br>  ...I'll just go with very well written and creative. T'was a good read.

"Great minds think alike but fools never differ", for example, is actually a single complete proverb.  The pen may be capable of changing the world more than a sword, but what you do still says more about you than what you say.  Half a loaf is better than none to have, but not to make.  And so forth... no-one said wisdom was easy :)<br>  <br>  Some of them are pretty contradictory, though.  I've never believed that you can't teach an old dog new tricks...

Some people are uploading things on YouTube already, and I hope there are more, because I love that program!<br>  <br>  With regard to ALW, I think he may have parkinsons, but overall, I think he was just excited and very moved by being honored.

XHH6AqTYaa	his name is mr. craig.  the only reason they recgonize his voice is because carly ran into him (literally) once at the hospital and once at the hotel.  sam knows his voice too because she works at the hotel and he was asking questions about the vault.  nobody really knows him except lorenzo because he was doing business with him.  some fans think it is jax's brother, but i have doubt's about that.|`|04830ff9addfcfcf0bb3b7ad697c8b42aa	When he stormed the building he called himself #1 then when Sam pulled his mask off it was Mr. Craig.  He was working with Alcazar to trade the briefcase that's in the safe right now.  The only problem is the briefcase has a 6 digit code that has to be entered to open it and Alcazar can't remember the code since his 2nd brain operation.  The safe hold the case closed and locked for 12 hours when Sam hit the silent alarm so Mr. Craig has 12 hours to wait then hopefully someone will know the code or it will blow up with the contents inside.  Mr. Craig's group has already wired the Metro Court with bombs to blow too so which will go off first and who will live?  I guess we'll all wait and hope for the best..........|`|ae29f21cf3afa1e69b96044ca2a15e0baa	i think they call him "mr. craig"|`|b9a831ec5e017059418d263ed1d1b574aa	Mr. Craig|`|AA10717336	i don't know his name,but i think he works with Alkazar who is a big time ganster.
9VaWal2Daa	Oh Geez..........tough, tough question.  No easy answer, that's for sure. <br>  <br>  Kids are a blessing, and I would never reccommend abortion......but I understand the realities of such situations <br>  <br>  If you are unable to care for the child, than that is unfair to the child. <br>  You also cannot be expected to care for the child if you are still a child yourself, and do not have the means and resources to care for YOURSELF, and a child.........<br>  <br>  you don't say what sort of support you have.......helpful parents?  Supportive boyfriend who is gonna step up to the plate???   I imagine NOT.....if he is school age.........so this person would be in a real pickle.   Some will draw clear lines down religious beliefs.......<br>  <br>  but that doesn't solve any of the real world problems you will face. <br>  <br>  There are couples who can't conceive, who would KILL for a child to raise.  Adoption is an option......but then, that is no slice of heaven either.   You have to still have the child, and then give it up......which is NOT an easy thing to do, by any stretch of the imagination. <br>  <br>  Then the child will grow up wanting to know his or her birth mother. <br>  <br>  She or he might pop back into your life someday.......<br>  <br>  you have to think all this thru.......<br>  <br>  Perhaps the parents can raise the child, if they are willing......if you have those sorts of parents........perhaps not. <br>  <br>  If not......then, you have to think what's best all around, and make a tough tough, call.

And it's not fair to make your parents raise the kid.|`|hZ9omSataa	yes, cuz they will just grow up to be a big loser|`|JAdNkzENaa	that is a choice that you are gonna have to make and nobody else<br>  <br>  that being said,<br>  <br>  i would NEVER have an abortion no matter what the circumstances. i am a strong pro life activist and could never kill my baby. i think id regret it for my whole life. adoption is the answer! some times people will even help with the costs<br>  <br>  EDIT: even if the kid has a "hard" life or if you arent "ready" to be a mom. ask that kid when he's 5 if he would rather be dead and i guarantee you he will say no<br>  <br>  HAVING AN ABORTION IS SELFISH! dont kill an innocent life because you were irresponsible, do the right thing|`|jhdpLhNcaa	When you can't take care of a child and not ready for having baby you shouldn't have one and ruin ones life.

If you can't take care of yourself, how are you going to take care of a baby? You should only have a baby when you're ready, and some teens make that mistake of having sex. In some situations, I do agree w/ abortions.|`|MPOHHTtAaa	If I was not ready to be a parent and I was not ready to devote my entire life to a human being I would have an abortion.

He will let me run 1 errand today for him (liquor store) and then I have to lay with my feet up the rest of the day :(  The Mayo Clinic has a really good picture of Lymphedema of the lower leg.  What he doesn't understand is we are out of food again, but I'm grounded, so I guess someone else will have to go!  They really are killing me, but I have put off doing these errands for months, so I had to bite the bullet (just a little 22) and get them done and pay the price!  I have to be able to go out on date night!<br>  <br>  Whoever gave Sheb a TD, they better watch out, she has special powers!  I answered her question, and asked her to send her magical powers my way.  They are giving a trip to Disneyland, all you have to do is be caller 9.  With her special powers, I got thru, and was caller 8 :(  Sooooo Close!  But her powers do work, because I can never even get thru!  Thanks Sheb!<br>  <br>  Prayers for all, we can all use them.<br>  <br>  Hope you all have a wonderful Thursday, you only have to get through today, then it's TGIF.  Be safe out there!<br>  <br>  <br>  Rx Tech<br>  Diane|`|sPXbuyavaa	taylor swift - the picasso<br>  nascar - chicagoland speedway<br>  <br>  trivia - abc<br>  <br>  dispatchgirl|`|XIPhihWqaa	good morning 03/05/09<br>  kykx 105.7 Longview Texas<br>  <br>  TRIVIA<br>  Country music-C (Miley Cyrus)<br>  <br>  Games n ecards-3 (letter block Games each word must be at least how many letters long)<br>  <br>  Hello Mr. President-A ( Fireside Chats)<br>  <br>  History-A Unhappily ever after) <br>  <br>  Video of the day-Steps (what is left of the trash cans)<br>  <br>  Where in the world C- (90%)<br>  <br>  Sleuth- show<br>  <br>  WORDS<br>  <br>  705--radar<br>  805--gps<br>  1205--map<br>  505--atlas<br>  <br>  Everyone have a great day|`|XNcnagRIaa	Good Morning All<br>  <br>  KUPL<br>  <br>  Sleuth Trivia: show or arrow<br>  <br>  Sleep Disorder Trivia: How do you pay for your healthcare needs<br>  <br>  Behind the scenes: crazy<br>  <br>  Curiously Confounding Question:gravely plain<br>  <br>  Don|`|dBHgUJiJaa	Good Morning..<br>  <br>  be back after i  take my son to school!<br>  <br>  OKAY I'M BACK<br>  <br>  <br>  SO sorry I haven't responded to anyone..Thanks John M. for the advice..though I am feeling better today..and hope that it is over..but unfortantly I think it is because My BODY can't Be sick anymore!

It plugs into a filter which plugs into the phone jack.  The filter has a place for your phone to plug in and one for your computer modem chord.  That way you can be on line and still get phone calls.  For whatever reason every now and then if you have trouble getting on line you can pull out the round plug (power chord) for about 20 to 50 seconds then plug it back in.  The lights on the front will come back on.  When they are lit and steady (not blinking or flashing) which may take a couple of minutes you should be able to get on line.  Got the info from our tech support from our provider.  It will only help if the problem is at your end.  Let me know if it helps.<br>  Beecher I love your technical talk.

I found the number and dialed it.<br>  <br>  A man answered, saying, "Hello." I politely said, "This is Chris. May I please speak with Robin Carter?" Suddenly, the phone was slammed down on me.<br>  <br>  I couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude.<br>  <br>  I tracked down Robin's correct number and called her. I had transposed the last two digits of her phone number.<br>  <br>  After hanging up with her, I decided to call the 'wrong' number again. When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled, "You're an idiot !" and hung up.<br>  <br>  I wrote his number down with the word idiot next to it, and put it in my desk drawer.<br>  <br>  Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, I'd call him up and yell, "You're an idiot" It always cheered me up.<br>  <br>  When Caller ID came to our area, I thought my therapeutic 'idiot calling would have to stop. <br>  <br>  So, I called his number and said, Hi, this is John Smith from the Telephone Company. I'm just calling to see if you're interested in the Caller ID program?" <br>  <br>  He yelled, "NO!" and slammed the phone down.<br>  <br>  I quickly called him back and said, "That's because you're an idiot <br>  <br>  One day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for.<br>  <br>  I hit the horn and yelled that I had been waiting for the spot. The idiot ignored me. I noticed a "For Sale" sign in his car window, so I wrote down his number.<br>  <br>  A couple of days later, right after calling the first idiot, ( I had his number on speed dial ), I thought I had better call the BMW idiot too.<br>  <br>  I said, "Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?"<br>  <br>  "Yes, it is."<br>  <br>  "Can you tell me where I can see it?"<br>  <br>  "Yes, I live at 1802 West 34th Street. It's a yellow house, and the car's parked right out in front."<br>  <br>  "What's your name?" I asked.<br>  <br>  "My name is Don Hansen," he said.<br>  <br>  "When's a good time to catch you, Don?"<br>  <br>  "I'm home every evening after five."<br>  <br>  "Listen, Don, can I tell you something?"<br>  <br>  "Yes?"<br>  <br>  "Don, you're an idiot." Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too.<br>  <br>  Now, when I had a problem, I had two idiots to call. But after several months of calling them, it wasn't as enjoyable as it used to be So, I came up with an idea.<br>  <br>  I called idiot #1.<br>  <br>  "Hello."<br>  <br>  "You're an idiot !" (But I didn't hang up.)<br>  <br>  "Are you still there?" he asked.<br>  <br>  "Yeah," I said.<br>  <br>  "Stop calling me," he screamed.<br>  <br>  "Make me," I said.<br>  <br>  "Who are you?" he asked.<br>  <br>  "My name is Don Hansen."<br>  <br>  "Yeah? Where do you live?"<br>  <br>  idiot , I live at 1802 West 34th Street, a yellow house, with my black Beamer parked in front."<br>  <br>  He said, "I'm coming over right now, Don. And you had better start saying your prayers."<br>  <br>  I said, "Yeah, like I'm really scared, idiot<br>  Then I called idiot #2.<br>  <br>  "Hello?" he said.<br>  <br>  "Hello, idiot," I said.<br>  <br>  He yelled, "If I ever find out who you are!"<br>  <br>  "You'll what?" I said.<br>  <br>  "I'll kick your butt," he exclaimed.<br>  <br>  I answered, "Well, idiot , here's your chance. I'm coming over right now."<br>  <br>  Then I hung up and immediately called the police, saying that I lived at 1802 West 34th Street, and that I was on my way over there to kill my gay lover.<br>  <br>  Then I called Channel 4 News about the gang war going down on West 34th Street.<br>  <br>  I quickly got into my car and headed over to 34th street.<br>  <br>  There I saw two idiot beating the crap out of each other in front of six squad cars, a police helicopter, and a news crew.<br>  <br>  NOW, I feel better. Anger management really works.
dfjIBHe3aa	I'm warning you I can get VICIOUS about Ann Rice whose first novel was wonderful I am going to mention some (it happens mostly female) novelists who are primarily fantasy/horror/SF writers who can tell stories marvellously and usually write as well.<br>  <br>  Chelsea Quinn Yarbro began her series about the Vampire the Count de Saint Germaine in the seventies with Hotel Transylvania.  There have been, I don't know, thirty or forty of them.  I've read about twenty.  I have to live sometimes.  They are ALL wonderful.  It's amazing that thirty-odd years later she is still able to maintain the level she has.<br>  <br>  Octavia Butler wrote one vampire novel just before dying from a fall on the ice a few years ago.  It's a good book,but it's her earlier SF/Fantasy trilogy of Wild Seed, Mind of My Mind and Patternmaster which I want to point you to.  Wild Seed is about an immortal -- african -- woman and her relationship with a -- dybbuk, a disembodied spirit named Doryo, over the centuries.  Mind of my Mind is about a conflict between Doryo and one of her descendents in twentieth century america.  Patternmaster extrapolates these incredible creatures into a future where they dominate us.  When Butler died there was a lot of gnashing of teeth.  I did so myself.  But it was not JUST SF/Fantasy/Horror writers or African-American writers (she was and she used her heritage in her stories) who mourned.  She was lively and she was one of the best writers of our time.<br>  <br>  Jean Lorrah and Jacqueline Litchtenberg did four stories set in a future not different from Patternmaster where Humanity has divided into two types, the Sime and the gen.  The first one is called First Channel and they are recommended.<br>  <br>  Now the lone man on the list and three "mainstream" writers you should be familiar with if you want to impress "intellectuals"<br>  <br>  Fred Saberhagen, who just died, was a versatile writer of genre fiction who mixed mythology horror and scientific speculation (requiring an excellent understanding of science) with an abandon which was staggering.  He did a series of novels about Dracula with titles like "An Old Friend of the Family" and Thorn.  His fantasy books such as Empire of the East and the First book of Swords are equally wonderful.  His berserker stories are space opera, so stay away from them unless you'be decided you love his voice.  But Pyramids and After the Fact about the Lincoln assassination are wonderful time travel tales about an enigmatic figure called the Traveller.<br>  <br>  Francine Prose can only be described as uneven.  Pick up her earliest novels such as Judah the Pious though.  Her fourth is called Marie Laveau, and frankly that hooked me on her even when she is not at her peak.  Much more than Ann Rice she tries, she never strays far from good writing and always comes back.<br>  <br>  Isabelle Holland, who died in 2002, began writing near the end of what we call the "gothic" boom, which means she wrote a lot of romantic books with strong female heroines set in this or that historical period.  She's known as a genre writer, in short.  And that is not fair.<br>  <br>  Joyce Carol Oates writes gothics.  Unabashedly.  If you want to read about where Vampires came from, really read her.  Long novels with strong female heroines set in family situations.  And everyone admits she is DEFINITELY one of the best writers out there.  And critics.  Octavia Butler was very smart, but she couldn't afford college.  Joyce Carol Oates is sort of aristocracy that way -- the best education, the best academic jobs -- and she can write like an angel besides.<br>  <br>  Oh, one more writer, nothing like Stephanie Meyer but great in her own way: American novelist Conrad Aiken had a British daughter named Joan who wrote juveniles which are arguably WAY better than Daddy wrote.  The Wolves of Willoughby Chase, Nightbirds on Nantucket and Black Hearts at Battersea take place in an alternate universe where the Stuarts lasted out the Eighteenth Century on the British throne.  The Cuckoo Tree is about a dastardly plot to assassinate the king during his coronation by mounting St. Paul's on rollers and pushing it into the Thames.  These books are as audacious as that plot but unlike that plot are pulled off brilliantly.  I discovered them when I was 25.|`|MpTgh6MMaa	um, i read a book about a boy going to a school full of vampires once. the book was called... vampire high. i liked it alot.|`|ZTb0YjgXaa	there's a manga called vampire knight, that i read was similar to twilight. i think its a good manga to read and recommend it.|`|No7rBZn8aa	i love this book called<br>  The Vampire Diaries" it is also a series...<br>  much like twilight but not really...<br>  lol<br>  really really great!

d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	These trailers have to be evaluated in context of when they came out- they are almost impossible to compare independently of that.<br>  <br>  The King Kong trailer looked great- much better than the movie turned out to be, since it's free of the long boring stretches.  The movie was directed by Peter Jackson, fresh off his Lord of the Rings masterpieces... so people were curious to what his King Kong remake would be  like.<br>  <br>  But The Dark Knight had WAY more pre-release excitement. So many people were anticipating TDK movie because Batman Begins was so great- and from the trailer we saw it would include two iconic Batman Villians- the Joker and Two-Face.  Keep in mind that Batman Begins went with lesser-known villians (presumably to keep the focus on Bruce Wayne's transformation into a superhero), yet was still awesome.  So this movie was gonna be taking off the kid gloves, the full Batman experience, up against his most intractable foes.<br>  <br>  Even before his untimely death, Batman fans were psyched that Heath Ledger was taking on the Joker role.  And there were SO many people waiting for the next Batman movie already... By contrast, there wasn't any huge public clamoring for a King Kong remake, it was more a case of "it worked last time, let's see Peter Jackson bring a different classic to life"  <br>  <br>  If I evaluated the trailers on technical merits alone- assuming no prior knowledge of the storylines, talent involved or prevailing degree of public interest I'd probably say the King Kong trailer is better.  <br>  <br>  While TDK trailer showcases some excellent cinematography, the KK trailer sets a more mysterious mood, has more tension, and builds to a climax.  TDK trailer throws out appetizers- little flashes of what we'll expect to see and ends on a low-key note- much more subtle :)  But it's really tapping existing interest- someone who had no idea who Harvey Dent was, wouldn't be excited hearing the name mentioned, or hearing his quotes about good vs evil.|`|yhcyvBOHaa	KING KONG|`|JLPoeGdqaa	THE DARK KNIGHT HANDS DOWN<br>  <br>  I remember when the movie was coming out everytime i  was on youtube i couldent help but watch it <br>  <br>  and when i was in the theatre and the trailer would come on i didnt matter if i seen it a 100 times i always got hyped|`|76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	I can tell you that Dark Knight is a classic, and that remake of King Kong by Peter Jackson was a botched, horrendous piece of bad writing/filmmaking.

The Dark Knight was amusing, but not the type of "Best Film/Action Film/Superhero Film" that almost everyone says. <br>  <br>  But still I have to choose The Dark Knight.

ba122e0417f8f912d30b8637d6a58b14aa	I think it's because it was for some sort of viral campaign or something. <br>  <br>  Usually, before a movie is released, they would put something up like that. Take the Chicken Little website for example. Disney made a page where it tells when the sky is falling, which is exactly when the movie was going to be released. Now that it's no longer popular, or maybe it's because it was released already on DVD, they removed it already (well not the page, but they changed the look of the site....as for the Signs movie, that was made like in 2002 or something, and that movie is no longer popular). That makes sense.

MSe9P4k0aa	I play trumpet too and when I got my braces on it was hard for me to hit the high notes too, the braces also effected my endurence. I just used the wax that my orthodonist gave me and that seemed to help a lot. The hardest part for me is playing after I got my braces off I probebly should have worn the wax every time I played. The wax makes it easier to play after you get your braces off, but all you need to do when you have them on is practice and not get too frustrated with your high notes, it won't be too long before you are able to play them again. Hope this helps you, and good luck with your trumpet playing.<br>  <br>  P.S.  Wear your retainer when you do get your braces off, you don't want to have to go through this again, trust me. LOL.|`|t8mLfDFtaa	well you'll get worse once you get your braces and youll have to practice a lot to, but it's better to practice that way you won't be completely horrible. it'll take a while to get good again with braces.

a5abc95c0baa7453e31caa755c283f91aa	In my opinion you can't go wrong with Les Pauls. I have never actually played a Soltero myself, but a friend of mine has and he isn't impressed. I own two Les Paul Studios, a Les Paul Classic and a Les Paul custom with humbuckers and Bigsby Tremolo. I find it that you can easily find pickups and parts for Les Pauls. Now of course if your on a budget then i would most definitely go with the Soltero out of the two, but if not then go with Les Paul. In addition, if money isn't a problem, might want to try a PRS McCarty 22 or 24 or a custom, those guitars are wonderful, I have two myself and they are the best playing ones in my collection. Hope this helps, good luck!
1wNsBNmxaa	Elvis died on August 16, 1977 in the bathroom at Graceland. After being found on the bathroom floor, Elvis was rushed to the hospital where he was officially pronounced dead. The coroner recorded the cause of death as cardiac arrhythmia. While true in the strictest sense (cardiac arrhythmia basically means that the heart was beating irregularly and in this case, finally stopped), the attending physicians deliberately omitted the fact that what had apparently caused Elvis' heart to beat irregularly and then stop was an overdose of prescription drugs. These drugs included codeine, Valium, morphine, and Demorol, to name a few.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  cмерть????|`|Cp6ACouDaa	heart attack.......cardiac arrhythmia officially.....|`|valvULe3aa	Drugs, right?

The girl is very timid and shy and he doesn't like her deeply at first but then their relationship progresses... One day when she's waiting for him, she gets into an accident where she suffers head injury and is thrown into a coma for quite some time... The guy comes and sees her often and spends much time with her, but when she doesn't recover he gets discouraged and is almost like a dead person himself... finally the family tells him to stop visiting for his own good... and much later the girl gains conscienciousness but really doesn't know the amount of time that has passed... He comes back to her but this time he doesn't love her, like before, only sympathizes with her...

His dancing is amazing, I have no idea how he can do all that dancing and still hit every note perfectly. He is amazing! I can't say it enough. Ne-yo has written alot of stuff for himself and other people, but IMO, a lot of it isn't exactly an instant classic, 10 years from now I don't think it's going to be relevant. Chris Brown is someone I can see acheiving superstar status as he gets older.

If they change their style with the changing music style. They could last. Not that Im a fan of theirs and I hate to say thins in the same sentence but look at 2Pac.

63c13d2c1b6608c53cb0674e52cda535aa	I think its going to be hard to find original ones that you can use..I doubt you can find them for free either but maybe try typing in instrumental in limewire|`|b0c2f7bbc2800465df31249ead9de19aaa	OK so what you need to do is find the track on a normal download site like Lime-wire or Bear-share and then from that, download a music enhancer from music windows, you should now be able to transfer the track on to the enhancer and take the vocals off the track leaving you with just the instrumental. alright?

It may feel kind of weird at first because it's so real. It's more real feeling then even good reality shows. It's done documentary style and all the dialogue feels unscripted. Sometimes yes there is akwardness, but if you get to know the characters you see the humor in all of it. Plus there's a great romance plot too. The most akward character is the boss, but you just learn to love him and his weirdness. I'm sorry you don't like it, it definately is a different show, but I think that's why it's so great. Maybe later in your life or if you watch a few episodes from the very beginning you'll see what others see, but it can't be everyones cup of tea I guess.|`|fccb192af4392213479ef0cf5ade519daa	I don't watch it ! Too weird!|`|da10084dc1725e7a909bccce7b7a101faa	when you grow up and have to work in an office, you'll see that that is how it is.

Love Thursday nights. lol|`|af7b2beabf15250df25faf0e40c31b01aa	If the show is weird for you than it's not really for you. I really don't understand what you are trying to say. I think the writing is perfect and it is what makes it unique about the show. And yes finally it won an emmy which is well deserved. The only reason the characters are put into awkward positions is because Michael creates the awkwardness which is part of his personality. He thinks he is being smart by getting and issue out when he is really embarrasing them. That's what makes it funny. After all it is a comedy.

1b386e179ef50f4a8fc7d4596734fc49aa	The dictionary defines a hook as "an implement for catching something, holding something, sustaining it or pulling it along." That is a great definition for a song hook as well. The hook is the line of words and music that catches the listener's ear, holds his/her interest, sustains that interest and pulls the listener along to the end of the song.<br>   <br>  As with the chorus, not all songs have -- or need -- a bridge. When a bridge is used, it is musically and lyrically transitional (unlike a chorus, it doesn't sound complete alone) and it occurs in the latter half of the song. A bridge takes the song in a different direction -- adding new lyrical information and new music which will once again bring the listener back to the hook. A bridge may be referred to as a "B" section or as a "C" section -- depending on the song form used.|`|a7d1dc39931849d0bb98a1ce75f66b41aa	OK, listen to "Sexyback."   It says, "take it to the bridge," and "take it to the chorus."  The bridge is between a verse and the chorus.  Or in "Ring the Alarm," the bridge is when Beyonce is sitting on the couch and the key changes and she's kinda pouty.  But the rest of the time, she's writhing around and screaming and pissed off.  The chorus would be the part that repeats after every verse, or after the verse and bridge (if the song has a bridge.)<br>  <br>  Hook, hook.  Harder to explain.  I guess it's not a verse, bridge, or chorus.  It hooks you?  I don't know the exact definition.|`|ed4af609a0a4f9d42f8a2f01236c55e2aa	Bridge - an interlude that connects two parts of song.<br>  <br>  You can read more here:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_%28disambiguation%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_%28d...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Hook - a catchy musical passage<br>  <br>  You can read more here:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook</a>|`|eb046cce0acb3a593a0e2c0774f60b9eaa	bridge is a part of a song that's a few lines long and comes before the chorus most of the time. it's not really a verse coz it's not long enough, and not the chorus because the bridge is like a leadup.

Film schools, just like many other schools, favor graduate students and will often give you large portions of the tuition free and will help you upon graduation with jobs and such.  It is also much more impressive to come out of film school with a graduate degree over an undergraduate degree anyway.

AA11566580	BooksAMillion = They're about 10.00 a piece here, but I think the older versions (with covers that have probably been discontinued) are 13.00 each.<br>  <br>  Amazon.com = The cool thing about amazon.com, is that you can buy the mangas used and they're so much cheaper.  For a new one, it's about 10 dollars, but if you buy a used copy (which is in good condition), it's around 3 dollars or so.  I highly recommend used copies from amazon.com (I order loads of my books from there.)<br>  <br>  Walden Books = Same as booksamillion, around 10 dollars a pop.<br>  <br>  Barnes and Noble = Same as BooksaMillion and Walden Books.  10 dollars each.<br>  <br>  Considering that I went to the sites and got these prices, it's safe to say that they cost just as much in the store (though the taxes may be a bit more or less, depending on where you live, mind you).  I have at least 30 manga that I've bought from each of these, and they do cost around 10 dollars each.  The only thing that will drive you nuts by ordering online is the shipping costs (they're insane). Well, I hope I helped even a little!  Bye. :D

The singular is cannolo, meaning “little tube”, with the etymology stemming from the Latin "canna", or reed. Cannoli originated in Sicily and are an essential part of Sicilian cuisine. They are also popular in Italian American cuisine.<br>  <br>  Cannoli consist of tube-shaped shells of fried pastry dough, filled with a sweet, creamy filling usually containing sweetened ricotta cheese (or occasionally, but less traditionally, mascarpone) blended with some combination of vanilla, chocolate, pistachio, Marsala wine, rosewater or other flavorings. Some chefs add chopped candied fruit (citron, orange peel, or cherries). They range in size from "cannulicchi", no bigger than a finger, to the fist-sized proportions typically found in Piana degli Albanesi, south of Palermo, Sicily. Regardless of size, the shells should be filled as late as possible to avoid becoming soggy, thus losing the crunchiness that provides contrast with the softness of the filling.<br>  <br>  wikipedia.com

Too many "transsexual" movies are written by gay or transgendered persons and not actual transsexuals (those who get the surgery, try to destroy the traces of the wrong sex, and get on with life as if they didn't have this medical condition).  Too many "trans activists" do bait and switch.  They write about gays or transgendered and then lie and call it a transsexual movie or program.<br>  <br>  But you said you wanted funny.  Most TS programs deride them and make fun at their expense.  If half the stuff that is done in the media to TSs were done to people of color, you would not hear the end of race riots, and rightfully so.  So it is not okay to do it to transsexuals either.

Inoltre sul comodino trova un sigaro acceso. Incominciando a capire che i conti non tornavano, fa delle domande alla moglie: "Mi dici da dove viene questo sigaro?" <br>  La moglie non risponde ... "Ti ho detto di dirmi da dove viene questo sigaro!!!" La moglie ancora in silenzio ... "Dimmi da dove viene questo sigaro!!!" <br>  Si sente una voce provenire da dentro all'armadio: "Digli a quell'ignorante di tuo marito che il sigaro viene dall'Avana ..."<br>  <br>   Un uomo si presenta al commissariato di polizia molto preoccupato: "Vorrei denunciare la scomparsa di mia moglie ..." <br>   "Da quando non la vede?" <br>   "Sette giorni!" <br>   "E lei aspetta sette giorni per denunciarne la scomparsa?" <br>   "Sa, pensavo si fosse fermata a chiacchierare con qualche vicina di casa ..."<br>  <br>   Un ingegnere attraversava la via quando una rana lo chiamò e gli disse: <br>   "Se tu mi baci, io mi trasformerò in una magnifica principessa". <br>   Lui si abbassò,raccolse la rana e la mise in tasca.<br>   La rana gli disse allora: <br>   "Se tu mi baci, io mi trasformerò in una magnifica principessa e resterò così per una settimana."<br>   L'ingegnere tirò fuori la rana dalla tasca, le fece un sorriso e la rimise in tasca.<br>   La rana si mise allora a gridare:<br>   "Se tu mi baci, io mi trasformerò in una magnifica principessa, resterò così per una settimana<br>   e farò TUTTO quello che vuoi." <br>   Ancora una volta, l'ingegnere tirò fuori la rana dalla tasca, le fece un sorriso e la rimise in tasca. <br>   La rana allora gli chiese:<br>   "Che cosa c'è? Ti dico che sono una magnifica principessa, che resterò così<br>   per una settimana e che farò tutto quello che vuoi! Allora perché tu non mi baci?" <br>   L'ingegnere rispose:<br>   "Scherzi?!!?

Quando lui arriva, completamente ubriaco, lei gli chiede: "Disgraziato, lo sai che ore sono?" E lui: "No!". "E' l'una di notte", e gli dà un colpo con il matterello. "Anzi, no, sono le due, deficiente!", e gli dà due colpi con il matterello. "Ti dirò di più, sono le tre!", e gli dà tre colpi. "Vai, vai a letto, incosciente!". E il marito: "Meno male che non sono rientrato a mezzanotte!"<br>  <br>   In una piazza un gruppo di carabinieri se ne sta con le sopracciglia aggrottate e le mani in testa,col viso tirato dallo sforzo.

Prende la mosca con le dita, la stringe e dice: "OK bastarda, sputala fuori tutta. Ora!"<br>  <br>   In un mercato di quartiere: <br>   "A Spartaco! ..., quanno li fai li fichi?" <br>   "2,50 al chilo." <br>   "E li cachi?" <br>   "Er giorno dopo."<br>  <br>   Uno scozzese va al distributore di benzina con la sua auto e chiede al benzinaio: "Per favore mi dà due gocce di benzina e due gocce d'olio?" <br>   Il benzinaio lo guarda e gli risponde: "Già che ci siamo vuole che le gonfi le gomme con una pernacchia?"<br>  <br>   Uno scozzese chiede a un amico: <br>   "Scusa, Ian, ... mi presteresti 100 sterline?" <br>   "Mi dispiace, ma non le ho con me!" <br>   "E a casa?" <br>   "Tutti bene, grazie!"<br>  <br>  Una ragazza veneta si reca dal dottore perchè si sente poco bene e sembra che abbia la pancia gonfia. Un uomo, uscito da pochi giorni dall'ospedale, dopo una lunga degenza, vi ritorna in visita agli ex compagni di stanza. Si ferma al capezzale di un nuovo paziente, un cinese, che improvvisamente diventa cianotico, guarda disperato l'uomo e, con un filo di voce, mormora: <br>   - Woong sing hoo!!! <br>   Quindi reclina la testa, morto. L'uomo, esce molto turbato dall'ospedale, entra nel primo ristorante cinese della zona e chiede al proprietario: <br>   - Mi scusi, mi saprebbe dire cosa vuol dire "Woong sing hoo?" <br>   - Mah, è una frase strana, forse per via della sua pronuncia, perché tradotta letteralmente significa: "Spostati, cogli*ne: sei sul tubo dell'ossigeno!". <br>  <br>   Il ginecologo alla paziente: <br>   - Deve fare una visita prenatale? <br>   La paziente: <br>   - No, pre pasqua, partorisco ad aprile! <br>  <br>   - Sapete qual è l'auto di un radiologo? <br>   - L'Astra!!!<br>  <br>   Finita la visita la ragazza chiede al dottore:<br>   Dott, ghe se stanchessa?<br>   il dott. le risponde: <br>   no siora, ghe se no stanchessa, ghe se sta n' casso.<br>  <br>  Il marito ritorna a casa alle ore piccole, naturalmente sbronzo. La moglie lo aspetta con la scopa in mano. Nonostante i fumi del vino il marito dice alla donna: "Ti sei alzata presto per pulire la casa oppure stai per prendere il volo con la scopa?"<br>  <br>  - Che ci fa un asino sui binari?<br>  - Deraglia!!!<br>  <br>  Un signore va al cinema col suo cane. Ad un certo punto della proiezione il cane incomincia a ridere e il vicino di poltrona dice al padrone: "Incredibile! Il suo cane ride!".<br>  "Sono stupito anche io" dice il padrone "Il libro non gli era piaciuto!".<br>  <br>  Una volta avevo un cane che sapeva dire il suo nome...<br>  si chiamava "BAU"!<br>  <br>  Due signori si incontrano e uno dice all'altro:<br>  "Ho un cane talmente pigro che, se vuole andare a fare la sua passeggiata, invece del guinzaglio mi porta le chiavi della macchina!"<br>  <br>  Un cavallo si presenta alla biglietteria di un cinema e chiede un biglietto.<br>  La maschera dice: "Non è possibile! Un cavallo che parla!".<br>  E il cavallo: "Non si preoccupi, durante la proiezione sto zitto!".<br>  <br>  - Cosa mangiano i conigli della steppa?<br>  - L'insalata russa...<br>  <br>  Cosa fa una cozza, da sola, su uno scoglio in riva al mare?<br>  Il mitile ignoto!<br>   <br>  Due mucche al pascolo. Ad un certo punto una dice all'altra:<br>  - Muuuuuuuuu.<br>  L'altra la guarda e dice:<br>  - Mi hai tolto le parole di bocca!<br>  <br>  Due mucche pascolano in un prato.<br>  "Hai sentito di quella malattia che fa impazzire le mucche?" Chiede una.<br>  E l'altra: " E a me che importa? io sono un aeroplano!".<br>  <br>  Due topi fuori dal teatro:<br>  - Andiamo a teatro?<br>  - Ma no...<br>  - Perché no?<br>  - Perché ci sono solo 4 gatti!!!<br>  <br>  - Sapete cosa ci fanno tre formiche dopo il ma?<br>  - I tre punti di sospensione!<br>  <br>  Un gambero, un po' preoccupato, dice ad un altro gambero:<br>  - Sai ieri sera mia madre è uscita per un cocktail e non è più tornata...<br>  <br>  Due gatti si incontrano in campagna. Uno di loro è seduto davanti alla tana di un topo e l'altro annoiato lo guarda. Dopo una buona mezz'ora quello che guardava gli fa:<br>  - Non lo prenderai mai quello è furbo e non uscirà!<br>  L'altro gatto comincia ad abbaiare! L'amico lo guarda perplesso e pensando che questo fosse impazzito se ne va via. Ripassa dopo poco e vede il gatto con il topo in bocca, e gli fa:<br>  - Ma come hai fatto?<br>  - Amico mio, al giorno d'oggi se non sai almeno due lingue muori di fame...<br>  <br>  Un gatto corre velocemente verso l'edicola e affaticato chiede al giornalaio:<br>  - E' uscito Topolino? <br>  <br>  - Cosa fanno i grilli prima di andare a letto? <br>  - Spengono le lucciole!<br>  <br>  - Qual è il poeta preferito dalle mucche?<br>  - Giovanni Pascoli!<br>  <br>  Un uomo porta a spasso il suo cane e sulla sua strada incontra un amico.<br>  - Ti piace il mio cane? - chiede - E' un cane poliziotto...<br>  - Ma se è un barboncino! - dice l'amico<br>  - Sai, lavora per i servizi  segreti...<br>  <br>  Un canguro entra in un bar e ordina un cappuccino. Mette il denaro sul bancone. Il barista prende i soldi e meravigliato chiede:<br>  - Lo sa che lei e' l'unico canguro a frequentare questo bar?<br>  E il canguro risponde:<br>  - Per forza, con i prezzi che avete!<br>  <br>  Un tizio con la sua auto è in giro per le colline della Maremma. Sente il motore che balbetta un po', si ferma, e guarda dentro al cofano: "Sarà la testata?" si chiede. A quel punto sente una voce alle sue spalle: "E' lo spinterogeno!".<br>  Si gira sorpreso, ma non vede nessuno. Solo un cavallo pascola lì vicino. Si china nuovamente sul motore e continua ad osservarlo: "Sarà qualche fascia dei cilindri?". Di nuovo la voce: "E' lo spinterogeno!".<br>  Si rigira di scatto e capisce che è il cavallo che ha parlato! Allora si mette a correre a rotta di collo e, arrivato al primo bar del paese dice al barista: "Bisogna avvisare i giornali, la TV... una cosa incredibile! Mentre controllavo il motore della mia auto guasta ho sentito una voce che diceva: "E' lo spinterogeno!". Mi sono girato ed ho visto un animale che parlava!"<br>  Un vecchietto lì vicino gli chiede: "Cosa era? Un cavallo?"<br>  "Sì! Un cavallo!".<br>  Ed il vecchietto: "Con una stella bianca in fronte?".<br>  "Sì!... Sì! Proprio lui!!!".<br>  Ed il vecchietto: "Ma quello lì non capisce niente di motori...!".<br>  <br>  Una formica invita a cena una coccinella e un millepiedi.<br>  La coccinella arriva puntuale.<br>  Il millepiedi invece arriva tutto sudato con tre ore di ritardo.<br>  "Scusatemi - dice mortificato - ma all'entrata c'è scritto: "Pulirsi i piedi prima di entrare"...<br>  <br>  Una piccola pulce chiede alla mamma: "Mi racconti la storia di Pidocchio?".<br>   <br>  Qual è il colmo per un fulmine?<br>  Avere la testa fra le nuvole.<br>  <br>  Qual é il colmo per un libro? <br>  Essere di poche parole!<br>  <br>  Un uomo e una donna si scontrano in un incidente automobilistico. Le due auto sono distrutte, anche se nessuno dei due e' ferito. Riescono a strisciare fuori dalle macchine sfasciate e la donna dice all'uomo: "Non riesco a crederci: tu sei un uomo ... io una donna. E ora guarda le nostre macchine: sono completamente distrutte eppure noi siamo illesi. Questo e' un segno: il destino ha voluto che ci incontrassimo e che diventassimo amici e che vivessimo insieme in pace per il resto dei nostri giorni ."E lui: "Sono d'accordo: deve essere<br>   un segno del cielo!" La donna prosegue: "E guarda quest'altro miracolo... La mia macchina e' demolita ma la bottiglia di vino che avevo dentro non si e' rotta.<br>   Di certo il destino voleva che noi bevessimo questo vino per celebrare il nostro fortunato incontro ..." La donna gli passa la bottiglia, lui la apre, se ne beve praticamente metà e la passa a lei... Ma la donna richiude la bottiglia senza berne neppure una goccia.<br>   L'uomo le chiede: "Tu non bevi??"<br>   E lei risponde: "No ... io aspetto che arrivi la polizia stradale ."<br>  <br>  La mamma porta Marcellina a un esibizione dove la sua figliola deve combattere su un ring contro altre bambine in una specie di piccola esibizione.<br>   Sale sul ring contro la prima avversaria,che era il doppio di lei,,e con solo due pugni la mette ko..<br>   La mamma rimane stupita ed incita con forza la figlia.<br>   Affronta la seconda e anche questa si ritrova subito al tappeto.<br>   La mamma, sempre più incredula, urla a squarciagola.<br>   E così cadono tutte le altre avversarie e Marcellina vince il torneo.<br>   Negli spogliatoi la mamma chiede a Marcellina qual'è il suo segreto e la bambina risponde:<br>   "Non so proprio se a stancarle così tanto sono state le mie finte oppure..sai quel regalino portafortuna che la nonna mi aveva dato prima degli incontri?<br>   Si,quel ferro di cavallo..ho dovuto metterlo nel guantone perchè in tasca non ci entrava proprio."<br>  <br>   Una donna cerca affannosamente qualcosa. <br>   "Tesoro, hai visto il mio libro?", domanda al marito. <br>   "Che titolo ha?", chiede lui di rimando. <br>   "Il titolo è: 'Come si arriva ai cento anni di età'", risponde lei. <br>   "L'ho buttato via.", dice ancora il marito. <br>   Lei allora, un po' irritata, chiede ancora: <br>   "E perché mai?" <br>   "Tua madre voleva leggerlo!" <br>  <br>  Coppia di anziani coniugi.<br>   "Cosa è rimasto tra di noi ,cara?"<br>   "Solo del...tenero,purtroppo,caro."<br>  <br>   Un uomo va allo stadio per vedere la sua squadra del cuore. Vicino a lui c'è un altro uomo che borbotta: "32.000 spettatori, 11 giocatori, 1 arbitro e 2 guardalinee ...!". L'altro, incuriosito, resta in silenzio. Dopo un po' lo sente ripetere: "32.000 spettatori, 11 giocatori, 1 arbitro e 2 guardalinee ..." L'altro, ancora più incuriosito resta in silenzio. Dopo un po' ripete di nuovo la stessa frase, allora il vicino si sente obbligato a chiedergli: "Scusi, ma perché continua a ripetere queste parole?" E lui gli risponde: "Perché con 32.000 spettatori, 11 giocatori, 1 arbitro e 2 guardalinee, proprio in testa a me questo piccione doveva cacare!!!"<br>  <br>   Un poeta sta camminando in un parco. E' immerso nei suoi profondi pensieri, quando a un tratto vede sbucare una splendida ragazza da dietro un cespuglio. Improvvisamente, ispirato da tale visione, decide di scriverle una poesia. Non avendo però niente su cui scrivere si avvicina e le chiede: <br>   "Mi scusi, non avrebbe mica un foglio di carta?" <br>   "No guarda, me so' pulita co' 'na manciata de foje pur'io..."<br>  <br>  Due tizi si incontrano davanti alle porte del paradiso.<br>   Il primo per fare conversazione chiede: << tu come sei morto?>> e l'altro:<<sono morto congelato, mentre tu?>><br>   <<io avevo il sospetto che mia moglie mi tradisse così un giorno sono tornato prima dal lavoro. Ho cercato l'amante per tutta la casa ma non lo ho trovato e mi sono sentito talmente in colpa per aver pensato male di mia moglie che sono morto di crepacuore>><br>   e l'altro risponde:<<avresti dovuto cercare nel congelatore, così adesso saremmo vivi tutti e due>><br>  <br>  Quattro amici si ritrovano dopo tanti anni. Iniziano a parlare del più e del meno e, mentre uno va a ordinare da bere, gli altri cominciano parlare dei propri figli. <br>   Il primo dei tre dice: "Sono molto <br>   orgoglioso di mio figlio. Ha iniziato a Lavorare come fattorino, si è iscritto alle serali e si è diplomato. Dopo pochi anni è diventato direttore ed oggi è il presidente della compagnia. E' diventato così <br>   ricco da regalare a un suo amico che compiva gli anni una Mercedes <br>   superlusso". Al che il secondo dice: "Anche io sono molto orgoglioso di mio Figlio. <br>   Ha cominciato a lavorare come steward a bordo di un aereo. Nel Frattempo è diventato pilota. Si è associato con altri e ha fondato una compagnia aerea. Oggi è così ricco che lui a un amico per il <br>   compleanno ha regalato un aereo bimotore Cessna. <br>   Il terzo allora racconta: "Non posso dirvi l' orgoglio che mi da il mio. Ha studiato <br>   ingegneria. Ha aperto un' impresa di costruzioni e ha fatto I miliardi. <br>   Lui, per il compleanno di un amico, gli ha regalato una Villa da 1500mq". <br>   Nel frattempo il quarto torna e chiede di cosa stessero parlando, allora I tre amici gli chiedono di suo figlio. "Mio figlio è <br>   un gigolò per gay. Si guadagna da vivere così". <br>   E gli amici: "Poverino, che disgrazia!" <br>   "Ma quale disgrazia, sta una favola! Pensate che quest' anno per il suo compleanno tre frocioni di clienti gli hanno regalato una Mercedes, un aereo privato e una villa di 1500 mq.!!! ....E I vostri figli invece che fanno?"<br>  <br>  Due passerotti innamorati sull'albero. Arriva un falco che porta via la passerotta. Il passerotto prende il fucile e spara al falco. <br>  <br>  <br>   MORALE: quando c'e' l'amore anche l'uccello tira!<br>  <br>   Una signora cade dal balcone mentre sta lavando i vetri e si<br>   infila a testa in giù in un cassonetto della spazzatura.<br>   Un ubriaco esce da un bar e nota le due gambe che escono dal cassonetto, si avvicina e con la mano sposta le mutande della povera signora, scuote la testa e ritorna nel bar a chiamare un suo amico ubriaco pure lui.<br>   "Vieni con me ti devo fare vedere una cosa!!!". Insieme si avvicinano al cassonetto l'ubriaco sposta di nuovo le mutande ed esclama: "E' un po' usata... ma io non l'avrei buttata via..."<br>  <br>  Ieri notte, mia moglie ed io eravamo seduti a tavola, parlando delle cose della vita. Quando siamo arrivati a parlare di vita e di morte, le ho detto: <br>   - Non mi lasciare mai vivere in stato vegetativo, in dipendenza completa da una macchina e alimentato da una flebo. Se mi dovessi vedere in questo stato, spegni gli apparati che mi tengono in vita! <br>   Allora lei si è alzata, ha spento il televisore ed il computer, e mi ha tolto la birra... <br>  <br>  <br>   La moglie trova un bigliettino con scritto il nome di una donna nella giacca del marito. Alla sera, come il marito mette piede in casa, la moglie gli sferra una padellata in testa. <br>   Il marito: <br>   - Uhè, Marì, ma che fai? Si 'isciuta pazz'? <br>   - Ah i so' pazz'?!? Agg' truvato nù bigliett' ind a' giacca! <br>   Il marito, elaborando velocemente: <br>   - Ma no, Marì, che bai penzann! E' o nomme dò cavallo che io e l'amici miei avimme fatt' na scommessa... mica e' na femmena! <br>   La moglie dispiaciuta: <br>   - Ah scusa Pasquà, nun vuleve... ò sai comm'è a' gelosia! <br>   Il giorno dopo il marito torna a casa, apre la porta e subito dopo gli arriva un'altra padellata in testa. <br>   - Marì, nata vota?! Ma mo, che e' succiess? <br>   - PASQUA', T'HA TELEFUNAT' O CAVALL! <br>  <br>  <br>   Un esperto cacciatore si reca in un armeria per acquistare un mirino di ultima generazione. <br>   Il proprietario del negozio gli mostra diversi modelli, ma quello che interessa al cliente è il più costoso. Talmente costoso che ad un certo punto sembra voler rinunciare all'acquisto. <br>   A quel punto il proprietario oltre a descrivere l'oggetto minuziosamente gli da la possibilità di provarlo. Escono dal negozio e dice di puntare verso un casolare in aperta campagna: <br>   - Vede quella è casa mia, è esattamente a 4 chilometri da qui! <br>   Il cliente lo prova: <br>   - Effettivamente questo mirino è eccezionale! Sembra di avere la sua casa qui a 10 metri, invece sono ben 4 chilometri! <br>   Il cacciatore continua a guardare verso il casolare quando ad un certo punto vede una donna bionda completamente nuda che gira per casa, lo fa notare al negoziante, che dopo aver guardato la donna, afferma che sua moglie ama uscire dalla doccia in quelle condizioni. <br>   Il cacciatore continua a guardare ed ad un certo punto esclama: <br>   - Ma c'è anche un uomo nudo! <br>   L'armaiolo guarda e riconosce il postino ed esclama: <br>   - Guardi, il mirino è suo gratis se con due proiettili colpisce mia moglie alla testa ed il postino nelle parti intime! <br>   Il cacciatore prende la mira e risponde: <br>   - SA CHE FORSE CE LA FACCIO CON UN COLPO SOLO?!? <br>  <br>   Turiddu, di professione gommista, è da solo con la sua Santuzza la prima notte di nozze nella camera d'albergo. Turiddu guarda con fare sospettoso la sua Santuzza e poi le ordina: <br>   - Santuzza, spogliati. <br>   La giovane e bella Santuzza ovviamente sa cosa l'attende e pian piano si spoglia. Quando è completamente nuda Turiddu le ordina: <br>   - Vai in bagno e riempi la vasca! <br>   Santuzza, un po' perplessa, obbedisce al marito. Quando la vasca è piena Turiddu le ordina: <br>   - Sdraiati dentro la vasca! <br>   Santuzza è ancora più perplessa, ma obbedisce. Quando è dentro la vasca Turiddu la spinge sott'acqua per qualche secondo, poi visibilmente soddisfatto, la fa uscire e fanno all'amore tutta la notte. La mattina dopo Santuzza chiede il perché di questo strano comportamento e Turiddu: <br>   - Sai, deformazione professionale... se facevi le bollicine, vuol dire che non eri vergine... <br>  <br>  <br>   Una ragazza che sta per sposarsi, tutta indaffarata per i preparativi del matrimonio, chiede alla madre di comprarle una lunga, sexy camicia da notte nera per la sua prima notte. La madre si dimentica e, all'ultimo momento, corre nel negozietto sotto casa, ma l'unica cosa che riesce a trovare è un corto pigiamino rosa da bambina. <br>   La madre lo compra ugualmente e lo infila in valigia sotto a tutto il resto per non farlo vedere alla figlia. La prima notte di nozze lo sposo, un pochino nervoso, dice alla moglie: <br>   - Ora vado in bagno a prepararmi, tesoro. Ma tu devi promettermi di non sbirciare! <br>   La moglie promette e, eccitatissima, cerca la camicia da notte comprata dalla madre. Quando vede il pigiamino, esclama con disappunto: <br>   - Oh no!! E' corto, piccolo e rosa! <br>   Ed il marito, dal bagno: <br>   - Mi avevi promesso di non sbirciare!!! <br>  <br>  <br>   Una giovane mogliettina riceve in casa un carissimo amico del marito con il quale intrattiene una rovente relazione da circa un anno. Dopo aver fatto l'amore stanno chiacchierando abbracciati a letto quando suona il telefono. La donna risponde: <br>   - Ma sì, certo! Sono contenta per te... bene divertiti... davvero? Ma è grandioso! Ciao! Ciao! <br>   Incuriosito l'amante che ha ascoltato solo parte della conversazione chiede: <br>   - Chi era? <br>   - Oh... era mio marito dalla barca... <br>   - E che ti ha detto? <br>   - Mi raccontava quanto si sta divertendo a pescare con te! <br>  <br>   Un marito rientra a casa e trova la giovane e bella moglie completamente nuda seduta sopra al termosifone: <br>   - Ma, cara, che stai facendo? <br>   E la moglie: <br>   - Sai, caro, è venuto il proprietario dell'appartamento... beh, vedi, erano 6 mesi che non pagavamo l'affitto... <br>   - E allora? <br>   - Bene, caro, sto asciugando la ricevuta! <br>  <br>   Una donna è a letto con il suo amante, quando sente arrivare il marito. Mentre lui apre la porta, lei cosparge di vaselina l'amante e lo ricopre di borotalco, dicendogli di mettersi in un angolo e fare finta di essere una statua. <br>   - Cos'è questo? - chiede il marito entrando in camera da letto. <br>   - Oh, è solo una statua! I nostri vicini, i signori Rossi, hanno comprato una statua per la loro camera da letto, mi è piaciuta così tanto che anche io ne ho voluta una... <br>   Nient'altro viene aggiunto sull'argomento statua, ed infine marito e moglie vanno a letto. Verso le due di notte il marito si alza, va in cucina e ritorna nella camera da letto con un panino ed un bicchiere di latte. <br>   - Tieni! - dice alla "statua" - Mangia qualcosa... Io sono stato in quelle condizioni come un idiota per tre giorni dai signori Rossi e nessuno si è neanche preoccupato di portarmi un bicchiere d'acqua... <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   Un uomo decide di passare un bel pomeriggio con la segretaria. La porta fuori a pranzo e poi a casa di Lei. Dopo tre ore di sesso scatenato l'uomo si reca in bagno e nota con orrore che la sua segretaria le ha lasciato un vistoso succhiotto sul collo. Disperato pensa come potersi giustificare con la moglie. Arriva a casa e gli si fa incontro il cane per fargli le feste. L'uomo allora coglie la palla al balzo e finge di lottare con il cane stesso. Dopo un pò si alza e dice alla moglie: <br>   - Guarda, cara, cosa mi ha fatto il cane al collo! - mostrandole il succhiotto. <br>   E lei, aprendosi la camicetta: <br>   - Cavolo, guarda cosa mi ha fatto alle tette!!! <br>  <br>  spedale c' era un paziente gravemente malato. I familiari si erano riuniti nella sala di attesa dove, poco dopo, entrò un medico, dall' aspetto stanco e desolato. "Mi dispiace di essere portatore di brutte notizie", disse, guardando le facce preoccupate, "l' unica speranza per il vostro familiare è un trapianto di cervello. E' ancora, purtroppo, qualcosa di sperimentale, rischioso ed economicamente a vostre spese". I familiari rimasero seduti, ascoltando le gravi notizie. Alla fine, uno domandò: <br>   "Per curiosità ..., quanto costa un cervello?".<br>   "Dipende", rispose il medico, "5.000 euro un cervello di uomo; 200 euro uno di donna".<br>   Ci fu un lungo momento di silenzio, mentre gli uomini della sala cercavano di non ridere ed evitavano di guardare le donne negli occhi, anche se qualcuno sorrideva... Infine, la curiosità fece domandare ad uno di loro:<br>   "Dottore, a che si deve la differenza di prezzo?"<br>   Il medico sorrise davanti a una domanda così innocente e rispose: <br>   "Quelli femminili costano meno perchè sono gli unici ad essere stati usati, gli altri sono praticamente come nuovi!"<br>  <br>  Una signora entra in una macelleria dove vendono cervelli umani.<br>   Legge il listino prezzi:<br>   €° 10 al kg cervello di operaio<br>   €° 150 al kg. cervello di contadino<br>   €° 500 al kg. cervello di dirigente d' azienda<br>   €°10000 al kg cervello di vallette<br>   La cliente chiede al venditore come mai il cervello delle vallette costa così tanto rispetto agli altri.<br>   Il macellaio prontamente risponde: signora, sa quanti cervelli di vallette ci vigliono per farner un etto?<br>  <br>  Gianfelice domanda al maestro:"Lei mi punirebbe mai per qualcosa che non ho fatto?""Ovviamente no! risponde il maestro.Al che Gianfelice sollevato: " non ho fatto i compiti!"<br>  <br>   Sull'uscio d'una macelleria c'è un cartello cossù scritto: "Vendesi cervello umano. Arto nutrimento, assimilazione immediata, ottimo contro l'invecchiamento della materia grigia. Prezzi a seonda di che cervello è." Dè, dopo mezz'ora c'è già la fila, tutti a pigiassi per 'un perde 'r giro. "A chi tocca?" fa r' macellaio. "A me" urla 'na signora "Mi dia du' etti di cervello di scienziato per ir mi' bimbo" Sicchè 'r macellaio" chiappa 'un cervello, ne taglia un pezzo e lo 'ncarta "Dugentoeuri grazzie. Avanti 'r prossimo". "Io volevo du' etti di cevello di musicista" chiede un ragazzo. 'R macellaio piglia un artro cervello, lo taglia e lo 'ncarta. "Centoventieuri, grazzie.<br>   Avanti un artro". A me du' etti di cervello di perzona normale" chiede un omo. "Ottantaeuri grazzie. Avanti un artro".E così via per un ber pezzo, finchè tocca a un vecchino. Che lui dè, cià 'na penzioncina da fame, bisogna 'he pigli 'r cervello più a bon prezzo, e un assaggino appena. E quando tocca a lui, sottovoce fa: "Trenta grammi di cervello di 'arabiniere, perpiacere. "Trenta grammi?!" ni 'hiede 'r macellaio "ma è 'siuro?". Il macellaio va dilà ner frigo, tira fori un invorto, ci leva un palloccolo di cervello, ne taglia un pezzettino... "Ecco trenta grammi. Fa trecentoeuri, grazzie". <br>   "Trecentoeuri?!" si sfava il vecchino "Ma è cervello di 'arabiniere". "Appunto" stronfia 'r macellaio "Ma lo sai lei vanti cervelli di 'arabiniere ci vole per mattenne assieme trenta grami?!"<br>  <br>   In una affollata sala da ballo, un giovanotto si avvicina a una signorina che fa tappezzeria fin da quando è arrivata. <br>   "Lei balla, signorina?", le domanda gentilmente <br>   "Certo!", risponde speranzosa la ragazza, alzandosi di scatto. <br>   "Meno male!", ribatte il giovane sedendosi nella sedia lasciata libera, "ero così stanco ..."<br>  <br>   Che cosa vuol dire per un uomo "aiutare nelle faccende domestiche"? <br>   Sollevare le gambe quando la moglie passa l'aspirapolvere.<br>  <br>  "mamma mamma, tutti a scuola mi prendono per il cu*o!!"<br>   "e cosa ti dicono amore?"<br>   "tutti mi chiamano Discorotto!! anche i bidelli!!!"<br>   "ma perchè?"<br>   "non lo sò.. non lo sò..non lo sò..non lo sò..non lo sò..non"<br>  <br>   Una casalinga confida all'amica incontrata al mercato le proprie frustrazioni: <br>   - Sai, con mio marito non è che poi vada così male, ma lui è sempre svogliato e soprattutto ormai non mi guarda quasi più. Figurati che quando torna a casa la sera, tutto quello che sa dirmi è: "Aò! Che se magna stasera?". <br>   - Sai, Piera, gli uomini sono tutti un po' uguali, così infantili e prevedibili. Anch'io avevo il tuo problema, ma sono riuscita a risolverlo in un modo semplicissimo... <br>   - Davvero, Fausta? Ma come? Dimmi tutto, che ci voglio provare anch'io! <br>   - Guarda, comprati un completino nero un po' "aggressivo" e soprattutto una mascherina nera! Gli apri la porta vestita così e... l'effetto è assicurato! <br>   - Non mi dire! Basta così poco? Beh, provo... tanto per quello che mi costa... <br>   Dopo una settimana, si rivedono al mercato: <br>   - Allora, Piera, come è andata? <br>   - Vuoi proprio saperlo? Beh, è tornato... gli ho aperto la porta e lui, dopo avermi squadrata dall'alto verso il basso, mi fa: "A' Zorro... che se magna stasera?"<br>  <br>   << Due amici di mezza eta' s'incontrano e dopo i primi convenevoli uno chiede: "Come sta tua figlia? Ha gia' 20 anni, vero?". <br>   "Gia', gia'! Da un po' di tempo si e' messa in testa di fare l'attrice ed e' andata a Roma in cerca di lavoro...". <br>   "Ah... e ha gia' fatto parti?". <br>   "No! Per ora solo 2 aborti...>><br>  <br>  Un fattore comprò un esemplare stupendo di cavallo da monta; pur avendolo pagato una fortuna, dopo un mese il cavallo si ammalò. Così il fattore disperato chiamò il veterinario. "Il suo cavallo ha un virus e deve prendere queste medicine per 3 giorni; dopo il terzo giorno vengo a controllare: se non si sarà ripreso dovremo abbatterlo." Il porco lì vicino ascoltò tutta la conversazione.<br>  <br>   Dopo il primo giorno di medicinali tutto era come prima. Il porco si avvicinò al cavallo e gli disse: "Forza amico, alzati !" Il secondo giorno la stessa cosa, ma il cavallo non reagì. "Dai amico, alzati, altrimenti dovrai morire !" lo avvisò il porco. Anche il terzo giorno gli diedero i medicinali ma... niente !<br>  <br>   Il veterinario arrivò e disse al fattore: "Purtroppo non abbiamo scelta, i medicinali non sono stati sufficienti: dobbiamo abbatterlo perchè ha un virus molto grave e potrebbe contagiare gli altri cavalli !"<br>  <br>   Il porco sentendolo, corse verso il cavallo per avvisarlo: "Coraggio vecchio mio, il veterinario è arrivato, forza, ora o mai più ! Alzati subito, dai !"<br>  <br>   Subito il cavallo diede un sussulto, si alzò e cominciò a correre. "Miracolo ! Dobbiamo festeggiare" gridò il fattore "Facciamo una festa ! Ammazziamo subito il maiale !"<br>  <br>   Morale della favola... Fatti sempre i ca**i tuoi !<br>  <br>   Subito dopo il discorso di Bush all'ONU l'ambasciatore Iracheno gli va incontro fuori dalla sala e diplomaticamente gli stringe la mano: "Sa, signor Presidente, ho una domanda da farvi, piu' una curiosita' da parte di mio figlio che un problema politico...".<br>   Bush sorride e gli chiede tranquillamente di porre la richiesta: "Bene vostra Eccellenza, qualunque cosa che possa fare per aiutarla, lo farò".<br>   L'Iracheno allora bisbiglia: "Mio figlio e' un appassionato di StarTrek ed in esso ci sono Russi, neri ed asiatici, ma mai Arabi. E' molto contrariato e non capisce come mai non ci siano mai Arabi in Star Trek".<br>   Bush ride, si appoggia all'Iracheno e gli sussurra all'orecchio: "Sa, e' ambientato nel futuro..."<br>  <br>   la moglie al marito:" ks faresti se io morissi?"<br>   lui "impazzirei..."<br>   lei " e ti risposeresti?"<br>   lui "nn impazzirei fino a ql punto!"<br>  <br>   dopo anni d fidanzamento<br>   lui " e se c sposassimo?"<br>   lei " ma k vuoi ke c prenda a noi 2!"<br>  <br>   un tecnico Telecom bussa alla porta d 1 vekkietta:<br>   -ki è?<br>   -signora è alice<br>   -alice? ma lei è 1 uomo!<br>   - ma no signora! ho l'ADSL!<br>   -l'ADSL? povero gay e pure infetto!<br>  <br>   cappucetto rosso vede il lupo nl bosco<br>   -lupo, ma ke okki grandi ke hai!<br>   -prova te a cagar la nonna!|`|SUc3DK5Kaa	mooooooooooooooooooooolto bella|`|bc34061af7ca934d3936e660434e518faa	S T U P E N D A|`|ecf28928d2ca9582ff9f06267f266db1aa	Proprio forte magari fosse così facile eliminarli tutti....|`|zBJqwAcjaa	bwahahahaha... non me la ricordavo prima di leggerla! grazie per avermi fatto ridere per stanotte ;)|`|2pImFEUsaa	è fortissima... ora k sento i miei amici la racconterò subito... complimenti....  hai meritato una stella....kiss|`|4MFEqeoaaa	carina ma poteva fa de meglio<br>  ciao cmq to acceso na stella<br>  <br>  a juck ridamme er cappello|`|5ba7f2bef04271ddaef7b82cd1fcb8ecaa	Non hai rispetto per Il nostro Ex "presidente operaio"!!!Attentato!!!!ahahahah era stupenda...la stella è tutta tua CIAU|`|7ec10ba357ed508eda8cb29f16316ebaaa	una stella meritatissima!|`|BSlRInrNaa	bella...davvero carina... la stella la meriti....  :-D|`|CPtKFlQgaa	ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!!!!!!!

5199590581461415ae6730eb96632b94aa	Der Punk bringt sich vor allem durch Musik zum Ausdruck, ferner durch Kleidung, Frisuren und Grafik (Collagen, Xerographien und Comic-Zeichnungen). Der Punk betont das H?ssliche und will provozieren. Die ?sthetik des Punks war stilpr?gend für die gesamten 1980er Jahre.<br>  <br>  Dahinter steckt eine bestimmte Anschauung: eine respektlose, resignierte bis aggressive Haltung gegenüber der Gesellschaft, eine Art rebellischer Nihilismus. Der Punk stellt sich gegen alle Konventionen, gegen die Konsumgesellschaft und gegen das Bürgertum, aber genauso gegen die politische Linke mit ihrer Staatsgl?ubigkeit (Etatismus). Der Punk kennt keine Ideale, keine Anführer und keine Ziele. Er wendet sich in einer strikten Antihaltung gegen alles.<br>  <br>  Typischerweise sieht der Punk auch für sich selbst keine Zukunft (Schlagwort: ?No Future”); so erkl?rt sich auch die ungesunde Lebensweise vieler Punks. Es gibt zwar auch komplett gegenteilige Tendenzen in der Punk-Szene, wie die Veganer- und Straight Edge-Bewegung. Ursprünglicher Punk ist mit der Zugeh?rigkeit zur ?kologiebewegung aber unvereinbar<br>  Anfang der 1980er Jahre verbreitete sich der Punk über die ganze Welt, und es entstanden verschiedene Punk-Szenen in fast allen L?ndern Europas, Amerikas und Ostasiens, insbesondere auch in den kommunistischen Staaten des Ostblocks. Zugleich wurde der Punk ernsthafter, aggressiver und in gewissem Sinne politischer.<br>  <br>  Ein popul?rer Slogan der damaligen Punkbewegung hei?t ?no future“ – keine Zukunft. Es war die Zeit des kalten Krieges, und viele Menschen befürchteten einen Atomkrieg. Auch das neu erwachte Umweltbewusstsein verursachte in der westlichen Welt einige Zukunfts?ngste bis hin zur Weltuntergangsstimmung. Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher und Helmut Kohl standen in der Politik für Restauration, n?mlich für eine Abkehr von den Idealen der 68er-Generation, die in den 1970er Jahren pr?gend gewesen war. Konservative Werte waren wieder auf dem Vormarsch (?Leistung soll sich wieder lohnen“). Karriere zu machen, galt der Jugend als erstrebenswertes Ziel. Gleichzeitig herrschte aber Massenarbeitslosigkeit. Die politische Linke war gescheitert; ihre ehemaligen Protagonisten, die 68er, traten den Jugendlichen nun als Lehrer und Beamte gegenüber und verk?rperten damit ?das System“.<br>  <br>  Dagegen setzten die Punks die totale Verweigerung. In den 1980er Jahren war Punk die dominierende Kultur in den meisten Autonomen Zentren. Die Chaostage in Hannover waren von 1982 bis 1984 ein fester Treffpunkt der Szene.|`|b59b66d1f82559a30ec1861df4dab7bbaa	Man sollte festes Schuhwerk tragen (dr martins) um beim pogen nicht den kürzeren zu ziehen. Man muss Dosenbier bis zum Kotzen trinken. Man sollte einen Hund mit Halstuch sein eigen nennen. Man sollte eine ausgefeilte Pflastersteinwurftechnik beherrschen und sich ein wenig zumindest in den 80' auskennen. Was sind Mods, wer die Pistols und man sollte sich hin und wieder auf philosophische Phrasendrescherei einlassen k?nnen wie : PUNK'S NOT DEAD....YEAAHHHHH.................|`|8LNRDx9naa	tja jeder denkt ein bisschen anders über punk.<br>  Man kann nich sagen was einen Punk auszeichnet es ist eben ein Lebensgefühl(mehr sogar finde ich) und jeder der sich Punk nennt wird schon seine gründe dafür haben.<br>  Also es gibt keine sicheren Eigenschaften für Punks , dann müsste man ja ne liste amchen mit gewissen eigenschaften die ein Punk haben sollte und wenn man die erfüllt ist man ein Punk xD Nein das w?r Bl?dsinn jeder Depp kann n Punk sein aber ne wichtige eigenschaft (eigentlich auch die einzigste sichere) ist  Links zu sein,dass ist sehr wichtig finde ich.<br>  Man muss nicht alles in eine Schublade stecken..Punk ist Freiheit|`|UBfi7Yzraa	Kannte mal einen, war es nur zum Trotz gegen jeden und alles; Das macht man so, da benimm dich so, wenn du das nicht so machst dann....., war ansonsten ein nettes Kerlchen und richtig schlau und kein bisschen von all dem, was so im allgemeinen von Punks gedacht wird. Hat mir jedenfalls eines beigebracht wer sich auf den ersten Eindruck oder den ?usseren Schein verl?sst der wird verlassen sein. Der Mensch als Individium ist wichtig und was er kann und weis nicht wie er aussieht oder lebt.|`|c7cda571a558988239755c261f224780aa	Fragst du zehn verschiedene Punks nach der Definition von Punk, dann bekommst du zehn verschiedene Antworten. Doch auf eine Sache kann man sich einigen. Punk ist mehr als nur eine Musikrichtung, es ist eine Art zu leben und ein Lebensgefühl.<br>  Punk wird meistens mit England, speziell London in Verbindung gebracht. Doch tats?chlich ist der Punk gar nicht in England entstanden, sondern hat dort lediglich seinen ersten "Boom" erlebt, als viele der Jugendlichen damals mit ihrer Lebenssituation unzufrieden waren, da sie keine Arbeit hatten <br>  ...........<br>  <br>  wenn du noch mehr wissen willst kannst du mal bei dem Link gucken, das hier ist nur ein Teil von dem Text.

2ef14de7fec995e63b420b03840504e0aa	Ti sbagli,infatti ti posso dare un elenco di personaggi che da piccoli diventano poi grandi:dragonball (Goku diventa adulto e avrà anche dei figli,e con lui crescono anche gli altri personaggi).<br>  Il cartoni di Georgie,la storia inizia che lei è bambina e poi man mano cresce.<br>  Il cartoni di Candy Candy anche lei diventa grande man mano che va avanti la storia.<br>  Ti ho fatto solo degli esempi,perchè ci sono altri cartoni dove i personaggi crescono ed invecchiano.|`|6c5039b19f2b74ba775827b72071a6d7aa	I piú famosi,se invecchiono,no si potrobb tramandarli alle nuove generazioni!°|`|HfcSPVjCaa	Solo quelli dei cartoni/fumetti americani però, se hai notato.Ad esempio, nella tradizione giapponese i cartoni si fanno la loro storia ed escono di scena quando finisce la serie...Addirittura DylanDog invecchia...curioso!|`|NllOyO3Haa	hai ragione!!!!!l' unico cartone k mi viene in mente in cui i xsonaggi crescono è dragon ball...e k mi dici del fatto k i protagonisti sono SEMPRE vestiti allo stesso modo?prob gli autori di qst cartoni non hanno molta fantasia nel disegnare dei cambiamenti nei loro personaggi...altrimenti nn trovo una plausibile giustificazione a qst dilemma...spero di esserti stata utile....ank se qll k ho detto probabilmente lo pensano tutti....=)|`|YeLsUTXTaa	altrimenti perderebbero il loro essere famosi poichè ttt ci abituiamo a vederli gli stessi|`|dC0uc3ntaa	non tutti... vedi dragonball...<br>  xo me lo sono chiesto anche io 10000000 volte a proposito dei simpson...<br>  scoprire se bart diventerà davvero un fallito, se lisa riuscirà ad essere il primo presidente donna, se maggie prima o poi parlerà e smetterà di usare il ciuccio.... ma penso che alla fine il loro rimanere "giovani" ci permette di poter immaginare cosa succederà...|`|1db71251d9c9f90cd31072d1091f4c8aaa	Me lo sono chiesta un sacco di volte...forse perchè la maggior parte delle avventure si svolge in un lasso di tempo che per noi sono anni, invece si tratta magari al massimo di qualche mese per loro...una volta si facevano i cartoni animati in cui molti crescevano (vedi Candy Candy o Georgie o  anche Anna dai capelli rossi)...ma ora è più difficile...e poi il bello è anche quello...sono immortali e a noi piace ricordarli così...chi si ricorda Creamy? Memole? e se fossero diventate vecchie?|`|67994be93b5b99f57c4b8976bcf5850aaa	Secondo me la tua domanda non ha ragione di esistere!<br>  Perdona la franchezza ma prendiamo un cartone come l'incantevole creamy: un alieno, Pino Pino, dona a una ragazza terrestre, Yu Morisawa, dei poteri magici. La ragazza può usufruire di questi poteri solo per un anno.<br>  In un anno la piccola Yu matura ma si tratta solo di un anno, quella è la durata prestabilita del cartone, quindi per quanto la piccola Yu possa maturare la crescita fisica non si nota più di tanto. Però la storia di Creamy continua in alcuni oav e allora ecco che vediamo Yu che lascia le scuole elementari per frequentare le medie.<br>  La crescita c'è stata.<br>  Analizziamo D'Artagnan e i moschettieri del re:<br>  D'Artagnan vuole tanto diventare moschettiere del re... nell'ultima puntata, me lo ricordo benissimo, viene nominato moschettiere del re.<br>  Il protagonista è cresciuto, ha raggiunto il suo scopo... la vicenda è arrivata alla sua naturale conclusione.<br>  Prendiamo ora in esame Sailor Moon:<br>  Prima serie: Bunny ha 14 anni. Il cartone ha successo, vengono create nuove serie e alla fine dell'ultima serie Bunny frequenta il liceo.<br>  C'è stata sia una crescita morale che fisica.<br>  Prendiamo in esame Dragon Ball:<br>  La vicenda si svolge durante un periodo di tempo vastissimo: i personaggi crescono e mettono sù famiglia.<br>  La crescita c'è stata.<br>  Ho preso in esame i miei cartoni preferiti per farti capire che non è vero che i protagonisti non crescono: semplicemente la vicenda deve avere quella durata, per la piccola Yu si tratta di un anno, per D'Artagnan... povero, volevi he fosse nominato moschettiere a 50 anni??? =P<br>  Nel caso di Sailor Moon di serie in serie le protagoniste crescono e nel caso di Dragon Ball quando passano gli anni i personaggi sono notevolmente mutati.<br>  L'unica eccezione che mi viene in mente e che, dunque, conferma la tua domanda è quella dei personaggi Disney Topolino, Paperino & co. ma per quello ci sono altre spiegazioni: Topolino deve essere un fumetto che appassioni tutte le generazioni... una storia di Topolino che cerca di tirare avanti con la pensione minima e ha bisogno di una badante non so quanto possa affascinare e attirare nuovi lettori... o no? =P|`|93MDMlVbaa	dipende da k cartone. per esempio in dragon ball crescono e invecchiano, anke su sailor moon di vede k crescono, poi sinceramente nn mi ricordo altri esempi..|`|UpAqexrqaa	Perchè quando si è bambini nell'immaginare il futuro ci si proietta con la stessa immagine del presente ... ed i cartoni animati mantenendo le stesse sembianze rimangono avvolti in qull'alone di magia che ad un bimbo piace tanto.<br>  Pensa che i personaggi viventi che interpretano i cartoni animati ad euro disney (o disneyland) non possono parlare !!! Non solo per problemi di comprensione con i bimbi dei differenti paesi, ma anche perchè i bimbi sono abituati a sentire un personaggio con una determinata voce, e sentirlo con un altra potrebbe deluderli :-) ... beati loro !!!|`|b0NcjO4Waa	Dipende dai cartoni animati... in Dragonball invecchiano un po' tutti|`|gy4WmSzbaa	Vi sono alcuni cartoni animati in cui i personaggi crescono e da bambini diventano adulti ed altri invece in cui rimangono diciamo pure degli eterni adolescenti o ragazzi.<br>  Da quel che mi ricordo io vi sono alcuni cartoni in cui i personaggi crescono con il passare delle puntate, è il caso di Candy Candy, che ancora bambina gioca nella casa di pony, ma anche Milly di "Milly un giorno dopo l'altro" anche Lady Oscar la fanno crescere, nelle prime puntate ha i capelli più corti ed il viso di una ragazzina, nelle puntate successive i capelli si allungano ed i lineamenti del viso cambiano, lo stesso vale per Maria Antonietta, fai tu stesso il confronto tra la sua immagine nelle prime puntate e nelle ultime quando è sposata ed ha due figli.<br>  Anche Georgie nel cartone animato la fanno crescere da che era una piccola peste sempre attaccata al suo dolce koala, nelle puntate successive cresce e si trasforma in una splendida ragazza innamorata follemente del suo Lowell. <br>  Anche in Maison Ikkoku (ho scritto bene?) i protagonisti dopo un pò incominciano a crescere.<br>  Nella seconda serie se non sbaglio sia Godai che Kioko (ho scritto bene?) sembrano più grandi, sono sposati e hanno anche un figlio.<br>  Inoltre non dimentichiamoci di Dragon Ball dove tutti i personaggi crescono, invecchiano, si sposano ed hanno anche dei figli (Trunks è il migliore!!!).<br>  Complimenti vivissimi sia per il disegnatore che per tutti coloro che hanno partecipato alla realizzazione di questo piccolo ma grande capolavoro che è la saga di Dragon Ball.|`|lvHQlIJqaa	adesso QUI  QUO  QUA  erano nonni|`|nQbWASXJaa	beh perchè son finti..se però noti milly mi pare, ma di sicuro PAPA' GAMBA LUNGA vedevi proprio il personaggio cambiare da bimba a ragazzina...e secondo me è giusto anche così, se devi raccontare una storia "veritiera" è giusto che rispecchi la realtà anche sotto questo aspetto....|`|39aFVlyHaa	Perchè sennò perderebbero tutta la magia in essi contenuta... E poi è bello ogni tanto tornare bambini e ritrovare i nostri amici (Heidi, Candy Candy, Giorgie, Lamù, etc.) come li abbiamo lasciati...|`|4MFEqeoaaa	perche nel mondo dei cartoni esiste l`elisir dell`eterna giovinezza|`|566d8878e9e005af2a3818f8dc2ebaaeaa	Perchè quando si è bambini nell'immaginare il futuro ci si proietta con la stessa immagine del presente|`|80061e2f8a853ebf5a60e19a0ddc5b70aa	ti faccio degli esempi,in dragon ball crescono e invecchiano, in holly e benjy crescono,in naruto crescono,in ken shiro(hokuto no ken) crescono,per dirti i più famosi...,in queli jap come vedi crescono e invecchiano,in quelli tipo simpsons che sono a episodi,e non hanno una trama collegata da puntata in puntata non c'è nessuna ragione per cui debbano crescere,in quelli jap se risquotono molto successo viene fatta una seconda serie,poi una terza e così via finchè l'anime o meglio il manga da cui è tratto,ha seguito di pubblico,per questo l'autore fà crescere i personaggi,perchè ha seguito di pubblico e non potendo inventare degli episodi a casaccio deve andare avanti con la trama generale ed è quasi obbligatorio che i personaggi debbano crescere...,quindi non è vero che nei cartoni i personaggi non crescono!|`|8nVemQv3aa	perchè ai bambini serve un modello fisso, tipo peter pan (se si scrive così) un ragazzino che nn vuole diventare grande,ecc.<br>  hanno bisogno di un modello che rimanga così com'è,anche se sarebbe curioso vederli da grande...<br>  ciao,ciao!|`|CPtKFlQgaa	appunto xke sono cartoni animati...al massimo cambiano d'aspetto quando diventano grandi ma se fosse cm dici tu non potrebbero fare tutte quelle cose che facevano prima...tu te lo immagini goku a 76 facendo un'onda energetica? cm minimo gli usciranno 2 spruzzatine di luce...oppure sailor moon gridando:"potere eterno dei petali di stelle" a 80 ci inciamperebbe e non riuscirebbe a trasformarsi con il colpo della strega...cmq a volte crescono...sailor mercury (x farti un esempio) nella 1°serie ha 14 anni e nella 5° ha 16 anni...anche se è cresciuta solo di due anni è sempre cresciuta!<br>  <br>  cmq riflettici anche tu e buona fortuna x arrivare all'impossibile e mai svelata soluzione dell'invecchiamento dei cartoni animati!!<br>  <br>  p.s.=non è detto che non invecchiano cmq...magari usano la crema per la pelle che ti ritarda l'invecchiamento...!|`|FShJ1gdLaa	non e  cosi ci sono cartoni che fin da iniziò crescono per e esempio Giorgi o dragon ball ciaoooo|`|HnV7tfj5aa	beh se crescessero e poi morissero nn credo ke farebbe paicere a nessuno.. ci rimarrei tr male se mi dicessero ke paperino è morto..XDXD|`|OB9lEUTHaa	Primo perchè sono cartoni animati o__o<br>  Poi Dragon Ball è uno dei pochissimi cartoni in cui i protagonisti son cresciuti, invecchiati e hanno pure procreato...complimenti ai disegnatori...<br>  E poi perchè i miti non invecchiano mai..|`|WsEn0qIxaa	perchè se no il cartone animato non potrebbe andare avanti a lungo e finirebbe subito e non ci sarebbero continuazioni<br>  ciaaaaaaoooooooo|`|b2d7b40ed8be1c8e59a4b1e31f5d49a4aa	Ti hanno già fatto molti esempi di cartoni in cui assistiamo ad una crescita e maturità dei personaggi.. <br>  Ora, scusa la poca poeticità, direi che quei cartoni in cui i personaggi invece non invecchiano mai (vedi Simpson e simili ecc), adottano questa strategia per una questione commerciale!! La serie deve andare avanti, non è stata decisa in anticipo una data per la loro "fine", si tira finchè si vende, questo soprattutto per cartoni che non hanno una vera e propria storia con sviluppi e conseguenze, ma che sono costituiti più che altro da episodi fini a se stessi (di nuovo i Simpson, ma anche Ranma, Lamù, Doraemon, Carletto ecc.)|`|maPofGTeaa	Me lo sono chiesta anch'io però nei cartoni giapponesi quasi tutti quelli che ho visto  invecchiano.<br>  Cia Amy|`|zAB0Trnhaa	PERCHè I CARTONI ANIMATI SONO PER BAMBINI...<br>  PER UN BAMBINO POTREBBE ESSERE UN TRAUMA CHE IL SUO "EROE" DEI CARTONI ANIMATI MUOIA O INVECCHI! :D<br>  E POI ANCHE PER NOI GRANDI è PIACEVOLE ALMENO NEI CARTONI PENSARE CHE SI PUò ESSERE TUTTA LA VITA GIOVANI!

AA11608474	I have always thought Paul was the better artist. I was a true Beatlemanian to the hilt-- I collected bubblegum cards and dolls etc., listened to the Top 20 each week with Bruce Morrow,<br>         <a href="http://www.radiohof.org/discjockey/brucemorrow.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.radiohof.org/discjockey/bruce...</a><br>   cut out news clippings and made scrapbooks all in the name of Beatlemania. When I look back even then I did not have the same admiration for John Lennon as I did for Paul! John Lennon was ditsy, arrogant,  very radical and so full of drugs it was a wonder he could stand at times. I realize the others were high most of the time too but not quite like him. John had very weird notions about life. It showed itself when he dumped his lovely wife Cynthia for Yoko and practically disowned Julian.<br>  <a href="http://beatles.ncf.ca/cynthia2.html" rel="nofollow">http://beatles.ncf.ca/cynthia2.html</a><br>    It came out in the lyrics to his tunes also. Don't get me wrong. He was a musical genius of sorts. however, he did not channel that talent in the best directions.Come on. He was the world's biggest "Do whatever You Want" advocate no matter who you hurt.<br>  Paul was REAL. John ?--you be the judge..<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQsZI_oqSlY&mode=related&search=" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQsZI_oqS...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJBvLTT4en8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJBvLTT4e...</a><br>  <br>  Here is an article about John's encounters with The FBI--<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2157256/entry/0/fr/rss/" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/id/2157256/entry/0/...</a>|`|AA10576711	John seemed to be more inwardly focused. if his songs were adored by millions, that fulfilled a distinct part of his persona but not his very meaning--imho.<br>  <br>  Paul, on the other hand, cares MUCH more about public appeal and earning scratch. i've seen paul and he delights in getting approval to boost his mega-ego.<br>  <br>  personally, i prefer John. he had the big f-u to society.|`|94395dfd96abed78451b3562f9daa703aa	It really is a tough question. Paul is still writing good music, Jenny Wren is a great song. John Lennon was an amazing person that seemed to glow. He exuded confidence and love, but wasn't saccharine with it. He was also more subjective about his music, which Paul tends to stray from. Towards the end of his life John Lennon was writing biographical songs "Jealous Guy" and that is why I'm going to pick him. He let the world see into his life, through his eyes, but managed to stay a true and respected artist. He was just an amazing person.|`|AA11638424	...I think Paul was lots more creative than John ever was; just listen to Paul's solo efforts vs John's solo efforts....Paul's were much better.<br>  ...My complaints with all of them - they were druggies, they were anti-Christ, and they were anti-Christianity.|`|AzahqPnLaa	In my opinion, John was infact better than Paul. Paul is a great artist as well. So was George Harrison. Christ, even Ringo could sing pretty well and he wrote a couple decent songs that the Beatles did. I never have really liked Paul for the reason that he is, well...quite greedy.  Music basically died with John. Some 80's music is good, but most is s hit...along with the 90s music and todays especially.<br>  <br>  In short, I really believe that no one can compare to John Lennon.<br>  <br>  To carson: by the way...George Harrison loved God.|`|OK9BLsQVaa	Lennon. McCartney wrote great songs, and some were thematically quite serious, but he never wrote about anything transcendent. Lennon experimented more in form and in content than McCartney - politics, spirituality, surrealism, etc. were all present in Lennon's works, but absent in McCartney's.

aP0JLAUNaa	Las dos son muy buenas peliculas, son famosas por su contenido de magia y aventura. Pero no olvides que Harry Potter son cuatro peliculas, sin contar los  libros restantes, que todavia no son film.<br>  Por esto es evidente que mas alla de que Narnia sea muy buena, Harry Potter le va a ganar siempre, va a estar con novedades siempre.<br>  Harry Potter es la que prefiero.|`|7166792ff810d6dfea9ddfc6a36a21a6aa	Harry Potter|`|yYWFJo9naa	Harry potter................... la pelicula 5' va a estar depinga|`|5f3796f5d4146b875e2bff5fa00a2169aa	Mmmm......  en cine Narnia dejo mucho que desear, sin embargo, honestamente las dos primeras películas Harry Potter fueron muy sobrevaloradas.<br>  Sin embargo, en novelas, ambas obras me parecen buenas y entretenidas.....|`|9adef085f28b988a79d2c3e3f23a6047aa	Harry Potter!!!!!<br>  Porfas si sos fan de Harry Potter<br>  agregame por mail xq yo soy re fan!!<br>  Anda a mi perfil y en 'intereses'<br>  esta mi mail.|`|OGFJcP3saa	obviamente harry potter............<br>  kisses|`|a6ba8975d783b9b988c03c21842b7c71aa	Narnia, casi me meto al ropero a ver si era verdad, jaja. Me gusto mucho porque de chica siempre jugaba con mis amiguitas de q al entrar al ropero ibas a un mundo completamente distinto y me hizo volver a la ni?ez, jaja<br>  Ya q estamos, va a haber una segunda parte??<br>  gracias y saludos|`|CVFbupdCaa	no le entndi a narnia pero harry me encanto espero lo 5 con ancia|`|M1dT7om4aa	Pues narnia apesta,es de las peliculas mas malas que he visto,asi que me voy por harry potter.|`|QrVlFZaLaa	Harry Potter y por mucho, Narnia no me gusta para nada.|`|gWsn125daa	me gusta narnia, pero creo que harry potter es mejor, sobre todo por la historia.|`|sygncRa6aa	Harry Potter|`|v4dMMNF9aa	definitivamente Harry Potter!<br>  la pelicula de Narnia se me hizo muy aburrida, al igual que el libro =S <br>  alomejor porque yo me esperaba mas o que se yo, pero no me gusto, y pz soy fan de Harry Potter, asi que es obvio porque elijo esa respuesta =)<br>  <br>  saludos!|`|wpeDdQvvaa	Harry Potter, además que Narnia no es el mismo genero literario que Harry... Narnia es como para ni?os más peque?os... tipo fabula.|`|UFhDSrfpaa	La Crónicas de Narnia y la novelas de Harry Potter son cosas muy diferentes, Las Crónicas de Narnia está escrita para ni?os y Harry Potter empezó siendo para adolescentes pero fué evolucionando hacia público adulto conforme fue teniendo popularidad. He leídos los 6 libros que has salido de Harry Potter y los 7 libros de La Crónicas de Narnia, ambos me gustan, pero creo que por ser más para adultos, prefiero a Harry Potter, sus historias son más interesantes y mucho mejor narradas.|`|d38d4ecfb7d9e98b9615067ba744f4c0aa	esta pregunta es muy facil de responder ya que la mayoria dice ?harry potter! yo son mega fan de hp y he leido todos sus libros he visto todas las peliculas.<br>  pero narnia es diferente y de hecho fue pensada para que nos olvidemos de hp y lamentablemente va a funcionar ya lei todos los libro de narnia y el unico que se me hizo interesante es el de "el sobrino del mago" y la distribucion de narnia va ha ser cda creo 3 o 4 a?os por los efectos especiales y haciendo cuentas la ultima pelicula(si es que las siguen produciendo) sera cuando yo tenaga 40 a?os imaginate.<br>  pero mientras exista en mi corazon harry potter narnia sera como un pelicula de pooh salu2 (spero mis 10 puntos)|`|lUiLVaK0aa	Ciertamente Narnia, tiene una estética visual bella.<br>  <br>  Aunque Harry Potter, gana, en muchos más aspectos.

6322af16f192d8db9733f1ec9c0e3426aa	I play in an orchestra where students from all over the state comes to audition for. I am an oboe player myself so I would know how many of instruments there are in each section, especially the woodwinds and brass. <br>  -4 flutes<br>  -4 trumpets<br>  -1xylophone<br>  -ALOT of violins (it IS an orchestra)! aprox. 30-40<br>  17 1st violins<br>   2nd violins about the same as 1st|`|0kzSJs5Raa	As you mentioned, the size of the orchestra is determined by the music being played.  Orchestras tended to grow as time progressed (though, that is not a hard-and-fast rule).  An orchestra playing a Handel work might only have twenty players while an orchestra playing Mahler might have a hundred.  Typically, a symphony orchestra will have the following players:<br>  <br>  2-3 flutes<br>  1 piccolo<br>  2 oboes<br>  1 English horn<br>  2-4 clarinets<br>  2 bassoons<br>  1 contrabassoon<br>  4 French horns<br>  2-4 trumpets<br>  2 trombones<br>  1 bass trombone<br>  1 tuba<br>  Timpani (one player playing four drums)<br>  Percussion (three players playing the following)<br>      Snare drum<br>      Bass drum<br>      Cymbals<br>      Triangle<br>      Bells<br>      Chimes<br>      Xylophone<br>  2 harps<br>  16 violin I's<br>  16 violin II's<br>  12 violas<br>  10 cellos<br>  8 string basses
