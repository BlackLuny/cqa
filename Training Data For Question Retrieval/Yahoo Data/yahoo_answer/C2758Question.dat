20090131172235AACeZFR	Pets;Dogs	Why does my Golden Retriever do this? ?	Ok so this is a common behavior my Golden displays and I think it is quite funny. She will leave One or Two pieces of food in her food bowl after eating the rest. And this is a big bowl of food by the way. Does anyone Else's dog(s) so this? I think it is quite odd and kind of funny. Maybe some type of programmed trait that makes her feel more comfortable it one LITTLE piece or two of food is left in her bowl at the end of a great feast?

20090131175012AAW3jAa	Pets;Birds	How many years do ducks lay eggs?	After raising chickens for a couple years and seeing their egg laying wane down to pretty much nothing, I am now interested in raising ducks for eggs instead. I read that some duck breeds lay more eggs a year than chickens, but I wonder, how many YEARS IN A ROW do ducks supply you with eggs? I have googled my head off and come up with nothing. I am considering Buff Orpington Ducks, for their calm nature, or maybe even Khaki Campbell for their productivity. Knowing if there is a certain breed that will lay for a longer percentage of their life would be a key factor in choosing my new pets though.

20090131180506AAlvb7U	Pets;Horses	I'm nervous about training my horse?	I got a free 3 year old QH mare a month ago.  She's the first green horse I have ever trained.  When I got her, she hadn't worn a saddle or worn a bridle, lunged, led a whole bunch and didn't get exposed to anything besides a paddock.  Well, after working with her about 3-4 times a week I have gotten her through the small things like walking down the barn hallway, walking under the bridge from the barn to the arena, walking past scary mirrors, saddle/bridled, lunged, she's learned the commands walk/trot/canter/whoa and she even lets me halter her now.  I have a trainer working with me now to try and get her ready to be ridden.  But she's still very spooky and nervous.  She won't get into a trailer either, so that needs work.  So I'm just I guess nervous that she won't get trained properly and that I just don't flat out have what it takes to train a horse.  I got her because she was free and has these amazing bloodlines or else I would of bought a horse that had already be ridden.  I've been riding for 14 years and I've trained horses to jump & be show horses basically.  I want as a result, a well rounded bomb-proof horse.  I'm nervous that I cannot get her to that point and it keeps running through my mind.. maybe I should just sell her and get a horse that can be ridden.  But I know that wouldn't be fair to her and that would be just giving up.  I have no confidence in myself!!  It's not like I'm not seeking out help, I just feel like I will never get to that point where I have this amazing bombproof horse that I can take on trails and jump.  If anybody would like to share stories on their experiences or just a pick me would be great.  And please don't be rude!  Thanks

20090131175726AAbbwCs	Pets;Dogs	English Mastiff questions. A new dog to our family.?	First can I just say Mastiff? Instead of saying English Mastiff.       We just got Mack today around noon. He is 11 months old. The people said he is just a big lug. He is so wonderful so far to my family (wife, daughter, and myself). All he wants right now is love love love.    He's a little timid right now with our 2 small dogs. If they bark or growl at him, he kinda seems scared for a second. He could probably eat them but so far he backs away from them.  He stayed outside most of the time at his previous home. We plan to keep him mostly inside with the other 2 dogs. My backyard is about 1/2 acre with a 4 ft. fence.       Just wanted to give all the info I could so I'd have a good chance for some tips.    Is there anything I should do to prepare all the dogs to spend the day together when we go to work? I plan to keep them all together in half of my house.    Anything I can do to help my 2 small dogs accept Mack? (It's not horrible now... but I'd take any advice)    Mack hasn't tried to get out of the backyard yet but I'd like to keep him from trying later on. He could jump the fence but he hasn't even thought of it yet. He may not ever try but I'd take any advice.    Should I keep him off the couch,chair,bed etc... I don't care if he gets up there but I want to do what's best for him.   Eventhough he's a huge dog, 120 lbs, I know he's still a puppy at 11 months. Should I keep food available for him at all times or feed him at certain times?    I know I could search the web for a few answers. I like yahoo! answers because it seems like I'll get answers,tips, and advice from real people with real life experiences.   Thanks in advance for any and all information about this breed and how to introduce him to a new situation.

20090131185912AAF9pXD	Pets;Horses	What is your opinion on...?	this horse:    http://www.equine.com/horses-for-sale/ho...    I like the horse, but, It's sired before (would that affect it's personality?)  and the fact that it's left eye is gone, it's too bad, because its a sweet looking horse <3  and becuase that's the left side, and if i were to buy, i would have to do everything on the right side.  That's so... unusual feeling.   And its short, but he seems like he's a solid horse, and I don't think I'll outgrow him soon.  I'm done my growth spurts, and I would try him out first.      I have been around half blind horses before, and the ones I have delt with are sweeties, but they were trained.  Training would be rather hard!  Personal experiences/opinions would be nice.      No rude comments please, thanks.

I just want to know your opinion, not on if it's plausible, but do you think it's fair to drop $50-$75 off board per month if every Saturday and maybe Sunday and sometimes during the week I came to obviously visit and ride my horse but also muck out other horse's stalls and help with feeding, cleaning any tack, sweeping out rooms and the stable blocks, etc.?

But, don't they show pit bulls in the UKC? It seems weird that pit bulls who are not banned in America do not register to be in the AKC, yet, the pitbulls who are banned in the UK are still showed in the UKC??      For some reason this does not make any sense to me, and I'm obviously missing something.

The reason I ask is because my cat got really excited and suddenly there were drops of something on the floor.  I didn't put two and two together so I wiped it up and smelled it.  The smell was stomach turning to say the least...  It wasn't a fecal smell, really, but more of a ..funk?  EXTREME funk.  Was this from my cat?

20090131153618AAjEBrI	Pets;Fish	Is this safe or is this something that could go wrong?	I have been watching videos on youtube lately and I say a saltwater tank with mollies and a spotted puffer in the tank. I have my mollies in saltwater right now and they had babies about a month ago and the babies are a pretty good size but that isn't the point what I want to know is would it be safe to put my puffer in the tank with my mollies?      I have one regular black female molly   2 silver lyertail female mollies   1 female ballon molly    1 short fin black male molly with white spots and a orange tail fin.   2 hermit crabs as the clean up crew thinking of getting a snail or two for the sides of the tank.      So would it be safe to put the puffer in or will it attack the mollies?      The puffer is only a inch long versus the mollies which are full grown.      Thank you for any help let me know if you need anything else.
20090131201339AAJjud0	Pets;Dogs	I normally don't ask this...What mix/breeds is he?	My sister's boyfriend (he's basically my brother-in-law), adopted a dog today from the Humane Society.  I know that he has rat terrier in him, but in my mind his head just isn't rat terrier.  He also has a long tail (the picture doesn't show his back end, so I wanted to add that in.       http://www.pets911.com/organizations/dub...

20090131153134AAzu8o1	Pets;Horses	Help with mysterious lameness....?	So my leased horse, who is 19, but generally incredibly sound and looks (and sometimes also acts) like he's 6 has been lame recently.    Quite a while ago, He started bucking. Not chronically, and only on right-lead lope, witch has always been his worse lead, as he has un-even muscle development. So, his owner had the chiropractor look at him. Nothing. He was fine again for a while. Then a few weeks later, after the problem re-surfaced, this time it was obvious that it was his right hind. He kept it ****** up 90% of the time, and had a hard time standing on it when i  picked his hooves. I was worried, and asked the barn owner to have the chiroprachter look at him again. Again, nothing. The problem was gone for a while, and then i sprained my ankle, and was unable to get him out for two weeks. Yesterday, my first time riding him in WAY too long, he was VERY lame. no question. Now my barn owner could see it clearly, and I could feel it without trying at all. She said she'd never seen him lamer. I was confused. What kinds of lameness gets worse after two weeks off? My friend and I were thinking pinched nerve maybe? Wouldn't that get tighter with rest?    What do you guy's think it is? What should I do? Can i still ride him?    Thanks in advance!      lol! Suggested category: Folklore and Mythology...yeah, the myth of the Mysterious lameness! ooh!

20090131200837AATeJFF	Pets;Dogs	Dog walking problem PLEASE READ ?	my dog is such a sweetheart, but he's such a pain to walk.   we try to take him for a walk everyday but its only like around street.      he's getting better after i've been walking him for a while. he doesn't pull as much, but sometimes he won't stop pulling and starts choking himself. when he's walking pretty good for me its fine but the thing is he LOVES people and animals, so if he sees someone walking down the street or walking their dog he instantly unfocused uneverything he only wants to play. now i'm scared because we live by an elementry school and i was walking him and he heard the kids at recess and wanted to play. he slipped out of his colar, and i mean he has a big head he struggled to get out, and ran down the street. luckily when i got close he stopped and let me put his leash back on. but i can't just be walking him and have him chase someone down the street to play, they'd think their being attacked (and he's a pit mix so that'd be a little scary) and quite embarrassing for me...         so my question is how can i get him to walk with me and respect the fact that he has to walk with me. we've tried gentle leader and that was HORRIBLE. he starts flipping around and rubbing his face on the ground and pulling his paw at it. so thats out of the question.          please help! i'd love to be able to take him for long walks, he needs it, playing around the house and yard is not enough.      thanks.
20090131201918AAkKtub	Pets;Dogs	What kind of dog should i get?	My parents have agreed to let me own a dog  (Finally!). But I'm stuck and don't know what kind of dog i should get.       Here's what i want in a dog.      - Has to be energetic and active as i love to go out a lot. and will probably take it to the park a lot   - I want a loyal yet social dog. And of course i want it to be smart.   - I don't want a small dog.   - The difficulty of training isn't a problem as i like a challenge all though I don't want it to be super difficult to train.    - It doesn't have to be a gurad dog (that doesn't matter)      My parents and i have discussed all the responsibility and Cost's of food,vet bills,shots,toys, random health problems etc and we understand it is a lot of money but they agree they  can afford the cost.   Also I most likely will be getting the dog as a puppy that way it will allow it to get used to us and vice versa.      I know it's a lot of Information but I love animals and If i go though with this i don't want to have to regret my decision after all it will become a part of the family.? Thanks in advanced if you read everything.

20090131195002AAitMql	Pets;Other - Pets	I'm trying to help homeless pets but getting a lot of resistance. What should I do?	I have a small business & I have been trying to find an animal shelter to work with. I want to foster, volunteer, give ad space on my website for a dog in need & donate from my profits. Sounds great right? Well not to the shelters I've tried to reach. The owners won't meet with me (always too busy to even talk on the phone), they accept my offer then tell me its my responsibility to find a dog from them to put on my site, always tell me there are no dogs to foster (how can that be??) and once we donated $700 for a homeless pets surgery & never even heard a thank you (which would be fine except the next time we came in they couldn't remember us!!) and the last shelter I attempted to work with did agree to meet me however she set up 3 meetings & stood me up at all 3 saying she just forgot. I am at my wits end! How can it be so hard to volunteer, foster or donate money. I have tried to work with 5 different shelters and you're telling me not one of them has a dog in need of fostering, or is financially well off enough to turn down a meeting with a potential sponsor? I even offered to bring coffee to the owner at the shelter knowing how busy they get & she said she'd have her assistant take my donations. WTF? What am I doing wrong?

I've never seen or heard of a mare acting this way.  She's also very vocal with people- always calling out or nickering for attention, especially from me.  She's currently turned out with all geldings but is the bottom of the herd and doesn't show dominant behavior otherwise.  It seems like more of an affectionate thing but I don't know what to do!  Any advice?  Is my horse gender confused? Help!

20090131161510AAidpWT	Pets;Horses	How can I balance better when cantering?	I have cantered before so it isn't really anything new to me. But I have had some mishaps when cantering and that wrecked my confidence levels. When I canter I hold on to the mane more for security than balance but that makes me lean forward so it wrecks my position along with my balance. I want to stop holding the mane but it's hard for me. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Mature answers only (I have asked a few questions on here before and have had a lot of stupid/mean answers.) Thanks! :)
20090131161958AAq3jfH	Pets;Fish	Ryukin Goldfish Questions & Also About Algae Eaters & Ordering Online?	I want to buy two Ryukin Goldfish for me and my kitty to watch and because they're pretty!      Before I do this here are my questions to the experts:      -What is common in Ryukins, like dieases. And is it likely to get them even if you take good care of your fish?      -Would they do okay with my cat?      -If I purchase them for 5 bucks each at only 2 inches how long will it take for them to grow to be 8 inches?      -I want to get a Red & White Ryukin and a Calico Ryukin, they'll do fine together right?      -What's the smallest tank I could get.. 20-25 gallons?      -Could I put Algae eaters in the tank so I don't have to scrap Algae.. if so what kind and how many? Chinese Algae eater?      Does anyone know of a good site that sells tanks? I'm going to order the fish from this site below but they don't have big enough tanks.       http://www.liveaquaria.com/product/aquar...

20090131192539AAxvrWx	Pets;Horses	Colic with a curled up lip?	Has anyone seen a horse colic, and one of the symptoms was repeatedly curling up the upper lip (I forgot what that's called, but what they do when the smell something strange)?      My mare was doing that this evening.  I saw her outside at 5:00, looking fine and nibbling things while waiting for me near the gate.  At 5:30, she was oddly laying down at the gate (a place she never normally lays).  I went out to feed them and she wouldn't eat, and layed down again in her stall, so definitely colic of some kind, but I've never seen a horse do the lip thing the whole time.  I walked her a little and gave her some banamine.  At 8:00 she was starting to eat her grain and hay but not as enthusiastically as usual, and I still saw her do her lip up once or twice.  I think she's okay now (I'll check her again in a few minutes) but has anyone seen this kind of behavior before?

Now, both of them are puffing their gills (the things on the sides of their head that move when they breath) and opening their mouths in an almost rhythmic pattern, and they keep doing it.  They haven't stopped since I first noticed they were doing it and that was hours ago.  Is there something wrong?

20090131192232AAdsCfR	Pets;Cats	My 16 yr old cat died 1 month ago, is it fair to buy a new dog just because Im grieving over my cat & lonely?	I tried going to the rescue shelter but i broke down and cried cuz I cant love another cat like my cat. They just dont give me the feeling my cat did nor can they take his place. they cannot make up for the past 17 years i had with him & all the love he gave me growing up. So i thought about getting a labrador retriever because this dog just clinged and hugged me for 5 minutes and i started to cry becuase i really needed a hug/consoling. I went looking for a pet out of desperation-feelings of wanting to commit suicide because i cant be with my beloved cat. No One can take his place and another cat just repulses me & makes me want to throw up cuz they are not him or anything like him. I just went down there taking the stupid advice of others that cant nor understand my specail bond with my cat of 17 years. YOu just cant replace someoene you love inthe same way we cant replce our mom/dad etc. plus i dont want to betray my cat-he was always the jealous type with other cats. So im still worried if i get his dog which is 700.00 from a store that ia m getting him out of loliness and rebound for my beloved cat. is that fair? And none of th eother dogs at the shelter made me feel loved like that lab did at the store. Plus i dont want to go thru the re tape of adopting from a shelter-long drwan out applications, checks, and they woulnt even let me touch any of the dogs-only see them thru a window. It was a really bad expereince and id rather buy a dog knowing we just click. but i dont want my cat to be mad or think im replacing him with a dog alhtough i know he would feel that way if it was a cat. doe sthis make any sense? i know i will never love anyone like my cat-no one can replace 17 years growing up with my cat. but i dont know how to deal with being wothout him and alone and become very depressed and suicidal. i'm scared. and if i were to do anythign to myself i will not see myc at in heaven. im sure my cat will not want that. when i cross the rainbow bridge i will be looking for my cat not any one else pet wise. My cat is my true love. i'm sorry that i feel this way. but just like people in our lives 1 special someone comes in our lives like no one else! I just want do do what is right! and still please my cat an dhelp myself without hurting anyone else emotionally. how can i do this? if it were up to me i would be with my cat 4ever and not even need to go thru adopting a dog.

The little one is about 4 inches in diameter and the big one is about 7 inches in diameter. also about what size tank should I get them, there in a 20 gallon now and it looks a little small.  oh and the turtle pellets were clogging up the filter. i was barely giving them any. but not so little they were starving.

I am noticing now urine on our furniture and he actually urinated on me while sleeping on my belly. I believe it is just leaking.He has had no incontinence of bowel. He has also had a definite increase in thirst the last few days also. I might also add that he is on Zequin (an antibiotic) daily for a URI. I am a nurse so I am well aware that incontinence can happen when a person or animal gets older, but it usually is gradual, not an overnight thing. Any suggestions? And yes, I will bring him back to the vet, just would like some input tonight from people who really know what they are talking about like a vet tech or someone who has had a similar experience.      *He has been on Zequin before  *He has had UTIs in the past, but it didn't leak out on him when he was sleeping or anything, but he would sometimes not make it to the litter box.

Her full name is Coramina Majulex, but I am just going to call her Cora.   She is very full of energy, and has run 7 laps around her cage in the hour she has been home!   She has a lot of attitude, but she is really sweet!   She likes to jump, and when I was first holding her she jumped onto my lap!   She is black with caramel spots on her back and she is the cutest hamster ever!   Right now she is upstairs in my room sleeping after her running.   She was born on December 12, 28, and is 7 weeks old.   She is a girl, and since girl hamsters are bigger her cage is kinda tiny.   So, we got out a HUGE plastic tub with high walls, filled it with   bedding, put her little house in it that didn't  fit in the cage, and it   is going to be a big playhouse!   She hasn't bitten me yet but she bit my mom. :D   Her cage is white and red and has wires.   She likes to lick me!      I am so happy!!! I love her so much!!!       I just wanted to share that with you, but my real question is:      Is hamster bed fluff good for them?   The breeder for my hamster said it can get wrapped around their legs, and even into their liver.

20090131181148AAqHFrN	Pets;Fish	How do I care for my sick betta?	My betta in a 3 gallon tank is sick. He has little white spots around his mouth and his lips are puffed out quite a bit. He gets regular water changes and I treat the water with Aquarisol and salt. I have Ampicillin and Tetracyclin medications if I need them. I've ordered jungle fungus eliminator since I figured it was probably a fungal attack, but it won't show up till sometime next week. Is there anything I can do for him before then? I have a small heater that I can use, but I don't want to give him any medication unless I need to. I figure he has a fungal infection because he's stopped eating and his brilliant royal blue color has faded in the past few days. I don't live in a town with a pet store and the closest store that has decent (and not crap) supplies is 300 miles away. He's my eldest betta and he deserves the best care. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! :)

20090131183817AAMpUQA	Pets;Fish	If i add a new gourami into my community tank will my Tiger oscar or another fish kill it?	i have a (fairly large) community tank in which i have a Tiger oscar (6inch) 1 common plec,1 sail fin plec, 1 golden severum, 2Silver Dollars, 1 Red tailed Tiger Shark, 1 Bristlenose plec and finally 1 blue gourami (male), the gourami i have in there at the moment gets no hastle from any of the other fish, they do bother each other at times but dont appear to be causing any harm and tend to just keep out of the more aggressive fishes way!...apart from the gourami, who even the Oscar doesnt bother chasing out of his corner of the tank! BUT...my gourami seems pretty lonely, it just swims around the tank, and often appears to go near the dollars, but they dont stay still long enough for that,particularly as they seem to get skitty by even the reflection of themselves at times! so i want to know if it would be sensible to add another gourami into my tank (was planning on a female golden gourami) that might possibly keep my existing one company in a way! or maybe not a good idea? im not a total novice but havent as of yet added any new fish to my tank, so any advice on how to possibly introduce the fish into the community would also be a great help!......just to add i know that Oscars need a lot of room etc. but I Have a relatively large tank(forget the exact volume but i did calculate that it holds enough for all the fish), and am planning at some point in time if need be to get a separate tank for it!

She is house trained, I guess it slipped her mind. We just bought a feliway diffuser, so hopefully that will help. We also just put down our other cat so we thought she may be distressed from that. She always goes in the same area too, in a corner downstairs in a room next to the room where her litter box is. I clean the litterboxes everyday, but she continues to urinate in that corner. If there is a towel on the floor or clothes, she will pee on those too.   My mom said that if she continues to do this, we are getting rid of her. I really don't want that to happen, so what else can I do to get her to stop?   Thank you.

Now I would like to change his food to a more healthy and natural puppy food.       I bought Innova Dry Puppy food today, but before I switch his food, I would like some tips on how I should do it.   I know I have to gradually put the new food to the old one, but about how much (approx %) of the new food should I add to the old food, and how many days should I do the transition for?       *Also, is Innova's protein content (28%) good for a 9 week old, 1.12lb REGULAR sized shih tzu? or is it too much/too little?   He is an indoor dog who gets daily walks and play time. ;)               Thanks in advance.  :)
20090131200438AAJwtKU	Pets;Dogs	How do I get my doxies to eat only two times a day from their own bowl?	I have two miniature dachshunds, one male and one female. They are both a little over a year old. My female is about 9 lbs and the male is about 12 pounds. He isn't fat just masculine, but I'd like to prevent him from gaining weight. Not only is it unhealthy, but I know it is also hard on their backs.    We feed them Royal Canin that is specifically for dachshunds. We want to begin feeding them each from their own bowl, because we will give the amount daily according to their weight. They normally eat from one bowl and share and we just keep it full all day. I'm afraid that will be over feeding them though and I don't want my male dog to get more than he should be getting.     SO... how do I go about giving them each their own bowl and making sure they get only the amount they need? It's kind of hard to just stand there and supervise, because they'll eat a little and then just leave it, because they are used to having it sit there and eating whenever they want. How do I change their routine? Thanks!

If there about 10-15 salt like Ich spots on my oscars body, how serious is it?      2. how long will my case of ich last if i have:   - Doing daily, 50% water changes.   - Adding Melafix daily, as much as suggested   - Turned the temp up to 85 F gradually   - Adding salt as perscribed ( iodized salt, I was told it was safe to use )      How long will the life cycle of ich be if i have done all those things?      The Oscar is only 3 inches long   he is eating, swimming and acting normally   he still explores and gets excited when I enter the room.      3. Will the problem dissapear if i change all of the gravel in my tank?      4. Does salt relax fish ( freshwater Oscar fish ), help them to not be stressed?      5. Is it true if a fish gets ich once it won't get it again?      Thanks!!

I know I should go to the vet and I did ask my vet, she said as long as it is not swollen and the skin is not inflamed or red it should be fine.      It is a very small amount but it has been 4 days since her surgery and we had her in a "sock body suit" so she wouldn't bite or scratch it but it didn't really help so we took it off.      Also she cleans the area but is not obsessively cleaning it.

20090131194741AAgHEv4	Pets;Fish	How to euthanize a fish?	Hello, my kissing gourami is very sick.   I noticed he had Ich today and i moved him to another tank, however, hes been behaving strangely.      Hes lost alot of color, his skin is so transperant near his head area that i can see his insides, hes sleeping sideways (normally sleeps upright) and hes "gasping" a lot. He is sleeping way too much. (i call it sleeping cuz its what he does when he normally sleeps, goes to bottom of tank and blanks out till lights come on in morning.      When he wakes up after every few mins, hes starts swimming with jerky movements really fast.   Its night time here and i can't go out and buy any meds at this time.   I dont think he will make it till tomorow.      So i was thinking about just ending his pain and euthanizing him.   How can I euthanize him painlessly?   I don't want for him to just die like this.

She is being a little bit nicer to everyone else, but the way she is being to me is so crazy. She starts making a chattering sound every time she hears my voice and she rolls all over the place and when I talk to her her eyes start to close like she loves it. She also sticks her butt up and wiggles it when I talk. It's so weird. Why does her being in heat make her act like this towards me and when she isn't in heat anymore do you think she will go back to not liking me?

I found an abandoned declawed (all four paws) orange cat downtown that was locked in a small crate at a construction site. It's very cold where I live. So I brought the cat home. It's a very friendly cat but I'm afraid it may have some disease or may not be healthy (I have no idea where it came from) I would love to keep it. but need to take it to a vet to see if its had its rabies shot, it's age etc. How much would all this cost and what does it involve? A blood test? And I can't tell if it's a girl or boy (I've never had a cat before)? It isn't afraid of people, and once again it's declawed so it obviously came from somebody's home.

He had a little trouble getting it into his mouth and when he started to swallow it made his neck huge, like really big, is that okay? but after he swallowed there was so huge bump in his stomach, it was a little bigger than normal but not huge, so is it okay to feed him a mouse that big?

Today, my kitten was biting and scratching a roll of paper towels and when I took it away from him, I saw that there were a couple of specks of blood on them. To make sure that the bleeding came from him, I let him bite on a white towel, and sure enough, there were more new specks of blood. Does that mean his gums are bleeding? Everything else seems perfectly healthy with him. He's eating fine, playing actively, etc. However, he does seem to be biting me more; is this from the irritation in his gums maybe? I'm making an appt to the vet tomorrow for a checkup. I can't look into his mouth even when he's fast asleep because he hates it. Oh, and also, a week ago, he was biting on my white shirt and there were tiny specks of blood on it too, and it wasn't from me because I wasn't bleeding. I thought it was something he ate but it seems to be consistent. What's going on?

20090131193220AApKVEf	Pets;Dogs	Help, I'm in a bad situation, would you be upset?	Yikes. I have a problem. There is this mama dog that comes to my house regularly. I kind of take care of her because her owners (my neighbors) don't really care too much for her. She's losing her hair and isn't in the best health and I always play with her, since they're never really home. Anyways, she has 7 pups and I walked outside today and she brought them to my house on my porch. Now, I was going to go over to my neighbor's house to tell them the pups were over here, but they were never home and now my 10 month old is asleep and I can't leave her to go and tell them. Problem is it's going to be cold tonight and unlike my neighbors I can't stand to think of them outside in the cold. What should I do?...Would you be mad if someone kept your dog overnight in their house? I don't want them to be mad at me, but really they already don't take very good care of the mama or her pups and if I went over there early in the morning, I guess that would be okay right?
20090131182705AA08pDu	Pets;Dogs	Good reason to adopt a shelter dog? ?	I saw a dog exactly like mine in a pet shop recently. This dog, a Labrador retriever was being sold for $1,200.  I got mine from a shelter for an adoption fee of $200 and they refunded me $75.00 with the understanding that I would get her spayed later for free at their facility (this I did) or with proof of spaying from an outside vet.      I also noticed that the pet shop dogs were not nearly as healthy looking as those at the shelter. I'm not sure why that's the case but I have a few guesses.       For anyone who is wondering which to do, buy from a pet shop or adopt from a shelter, please opt for a shelter.  You will provide a home for a pet and save some money as well.  Doesn't that make perfect sense?

(converging is when the feet move in toward the center of gravity as the dog moves)  She complimented my dogs rear after class, saying "Her rear is really nice, I can't wait until she shows!"      Day one of showing, my dog placed last in her class both shows.  Being a newbie :) I took the opportunity to ask the first judge what she thought, and if I could improve.  Basically she told me that my dog's rear was God awful, that I needed to get her spayed and get a serious show dog.  Needless to say, I was pretty hurt, but I cornered my mentor and the dog's breeder at the show, and we figured out what gait shows off her rear the best.  SLOW and steady was the game, and she took second place in her next show, first place in the last show, and was pulled into the short list for winners *****.  She didn't place, but took "third."  (after several down and backs and a lot of hemming and hawing from the judge, LOL)      There was a really great woman there showing a specials dog, and she said that some dogs really don't mature until two years old.  And then she watched my dog move and said that her rear wasn't as bad as the judge made it sound...      So basically, I am asking if she is just going through a wierd stage right now, and will she grow out of it?  Or should I spay her, and just focus on agility.  She will be one year old in about two weeks.      Also, one of the ladies there suggested that I start giving her vitamin C, and also strengthening her rear with exercise, running up and down the stairs, etc.  I can understand the strengthening, that makes sense to me.  But the vitamin C I am curious about...isn't vitamin C for immune systems?  What would that do for her joints or rear?  Maybe she meant calicium or glucosamine or something similar?

20090131182428AA6Z8cN	Pets;Reptiles	Urgent!!! Broken mercury thermometer in turtle tank!?	Now before you say fish tanks do use mercury thermometers well this wasn't a fish thermometer it was a really old one used for other things (I don't know what). But anyway I was filling up my turtle tank after a clean and was checking if it was the right temperature by using this thermometer because the one in his tank takes a while to update.      Anyway I dropped it, It smashed and mercury spilled out formed balls and then went between the rocks. I have since picked out what I thought to be all of them but I want to know is the water poisoned? I have yet to put my turtle back in but I am in a hurry because he is starting to get cold.
20090131184639AA6K0sn	Pets;Dogs	So yet another Dog Quiz :)?	Everyone keeps guessing the answer to quizzes I put up within an hour! Some even 30 minutes! This one is going to last at least 2 hours!!! Muahaha!       Okay. I am thinking of a Breed that the first letter of his name starts with S-Y.      Ex. If it was A-E, It could be Australian Shepherd, Border Collie, Dobermann, etc.      Try and guess! It's on this site:    http://www.akc.org/breeds/breeds_s.cfm       I promise I will not change my answer!!

20090131195515AATcWUv	Pets;Dogs	What breed of dog should I get?	I'm a single woman, and I have been considering getting a dog for protection and companionship. I have enough time during the day to care for it and everything, but what I don't know is what kind of dog would suit me best.      I want a dog big enough and protective enough to protect me if need be (no toy dogs), but I live in a big apartment with a small yard. I do go jogging/walking most mornings and can give the dog at least 2 short walks and one longer walk a day.      I have heard that corgis are a good smaller guard dog. I have also had a few people suggest I get a pit bull, but I'm kind of afraid because of the stereotypes.      Thanks for helping me out!
20090226080542AARLnQB	Pets;Dogs	Where should I put my dogs crate?	Hi,   My little yorkie russell cross has a small crate that she uses like a basket.   We put a towel over the top as I read that they like that. I also have a special thermal fluffy blanket thing over her 9 cm thick-specially-fitted cushion and she has a blanket in there. At the moment it is in the kitchen in a corner, but I was just thinking, as it blocks our cupboard.   So should I put it in the living room or kitchen? I was thinking of putting it in between the fridge and the wall. But would she be cold if I did that?   It was in a nice little place in the living room in between the sofa and the chair but then I noticed the air vent was there so it made her cold, but I could put it by the T.V shelf...   So what room do you think I should put it in?   Thanks
20090131183010AA0P40l	Pets;Dogs	What would be helpful?	My friend mentioned that if I go to a person's house, pick a puppy, place a deposit to hold the puppy until 8 weeks old, what happens if the person owning the puppies moves away, changes number, etc and leaves with the deposit money people gave them? Would there be anything to do? This is one reason why my friend strongly advises not to get a puppy from anyone other than a shelter. But in the shelters in my area (Sacramento), I've yet to find the perfect dog that's good with kids, good with cats, and good with other dogs and under 20 pounds.

20090226080919AAEhcIU	Pets;Reptiles	When to start handling my Bosc monitor?	I have recently purchased a Bosc monitor and was advised to handle him straight away so he would get used to me. He stopped eating so i rang back the store and a different person told me not to handle him for 2 weeks until he has settled into his new home.      It has been three weeks since i last picked him up now and he is starting to come out to feed but hides when i catch him basking.      I don't want to pick him up until i know he is relaxed and settled. I was just wondering how to be able to tell when he is ready?

20090131183037AAnGg6q	Pets;Dogs	I have 2 labs.  Can I switch their crates, or will that confuse them?	I've had Sophie since a puppy.  A friend just gave me her lab because she knew she couldn't take care of the dog properly.  The dog came with a crate, but it's too small.  I was going to give Sophie's larger crate to the new dog and Sophie won't use a crate at all.  But....if Sophie does need her crate for some reason, then I can use the other crate for the new dog.  I'm just not sure.
