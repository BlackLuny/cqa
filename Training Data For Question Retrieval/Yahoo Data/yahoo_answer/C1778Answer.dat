They have always been the Democrat Channel as Fox is for the Republicans. None of the so called news channels are truly objective, its all about TV ratings. You are the one that should be objective and realize the phenomenon that is occuring is all about divide and conquer. Middle of the roaders always get run over by both sides, so people seem to pick sides just to fit in. One thing it appears most people forgot is United We Stand, Divided We Fall.|`|fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	Fox for me.|`|PDF2NUZKaa	Nah, I don't watch those Obama networks anymore, too biased. Nothing against Barack, but aren't "news" programs and networks supposed to be just a little objective?
tguEmxVyaa	There will never be a universal health care plan NEVER!! Obama is just talking out his rear end..If you can't afford a health care plan then when you get sick you will die..|`|LWzrCu5caa	They are going to pay less for services.   They will tell doctors they must take care of Medicare and Medicaid patients and then pay those doctors less than any current insurance pays for the same procedures.  It will be enforced slave labor as the doctors will not be able to refuse the patients and they will not be getting paid anywhere near what they deserve for the care.<br>  <br>  They will micromanage the care.  A doctor will be unable to order tests that he feels necessary without it first going to a "Health Care Coordinator" who will require the doctor to justify the test.   If the patient meets the standards,  the patient gets the test,  if not,  no test.   It means that doctors will not be able to use their judgment but instead will simply have to match the patient up to the government set standards to determine if the patient gets the test.  And you can be sure the standards will be set pretty high to reduce the number of tests done.<br>  <br>  You can be sure that "the poor" get care and the middle class will be screwed.   Obama will take care of those who have not worked a day in their lives,   the illegals who broke into the country,  the criminals in prison get the best of care and the middle class gets left overs.   He has said he wants to redistribute the wealth and health care costs is just one way he is going to do it.<br>  <br>  They are definitely going to make sure that doctors are not in the "Over $250,000"  group.   Obama has already fixed the salaries of senior executives.   He will expand that logic to everyone.   And doctors,  no matter how good,  how qualified or how hard they work will not be allowed to be "rich."<br>  <br>  You can figure expensive new procedures will be called "experimental" for more years than necessary,  perhaps decades.  By labeling something new as "experimental" you got a perfect reason to deny payment on it.    <br>  <br>  They might just go with a system where a hospital gets a set amount for a procedure.  For example,  the hospital may get $2000 total for a gallbladder removal.   Since doing it through little holes with cameras costs a lot more than just cutting a 4 inch hole and taking it out,  the hospitals may just say the 4 inch hole is the way they do it and in that way,  they actually can break even or make a little money with the procedure.   Of course it does not matter to the hospital or the government that it takes three times as long for the patient to recover.  That is not part of the "cost" that they use in their calculations.   Bottom line,  expect a step backwards in the quality of the care.   <br>  <br>  Thanks Obama !!!|`|AA11598210	~~i have not seen any details on it yet, but I am so wanting a right to affordable insurance for all Americans, that I am extremely anxious to see the details.<br>  <br>  For all the naysayers, he has said explicitly it will not be a government ran health care system, instead it will be structured from what we are currently use to, just reigned in and made affordable for all Americans. How could anyone not like this idea??~~|`|RUfUxHgIaa	I don't think it's a good idea. It's just another way for the government to control what we do and there are so many people out there that just run to the doctor or emergency room for stupid things like a sniffle and if you told them their health care's free now what do you think they would do they would fill up the emergency rooms when there are actually people who are sick or hurt and need to get in. Also if you check into Canada's health care it is screwed up there's long lists of people needing care but can't get it and the elderly may as well just lay down and die cause they can't get any care at all. And also what kind of insentive will doctors have if the government controls their wage? Alot less doctors is what.|`|zHQVlXd5aa	There are no details for us to comment on.<br>  <br>  In general, I am very very very strongly against "universal" health care.|`|brKxytiXaa	as long as i dont have to pay a co fee when i go every time then i'm down with his plan

If they made the errors,<br>  they should pay and just maybe they will if the local offices you go to will investigate  them and do a re-file for you, amendment return after they examine your papers.|`|MP1nA5fRaa	H & R Blocks "guarantee" is if they make a mistake on your return that costs you extra they will pay for it and any penalties.  Unfortunately, per their "guarantee" they do not owe you anything.  I know this sucks, but so does H & R Block.  I stopped dealing with them over 10 years ago because they are not worth what you pay for their "services".<br>  <br>  I recommend you file your own taxes online.  Its a lot cheaper.  I do this on mine and my taxes are a little more complex @ property, investments, etc.  I have used Taxslayer for many years with no problems what-so-ever.  It costs me 29.99 to file both federal and state.  This site does not offer RAL to get your refund back faster.  If you want to file online and get a rapid refund you can use Taxbrain, thats what I did this year because I needed the refund faster.  It cost me a total of 106.00, all of that was taken from my refund, I did not have to pay in advance.  <br>  <br>  Might want to keep this in mind for next year.  Like I said, Block SUCKS

It's the subject of more than a few books, I'm sure, when it comes to Vietnam. One such book is "In Country" by Bobbie Ann Mason, which I mention simply to point out that this is something which is on a lot of people's minds.<br>  <br>  It hardly seems like it's been 8 years. I was 14 or 15 when it happened (so not much older than you), don't feel like doing the math now. I remember mostly that it was simply shocking. It didn't seem to make any sense that something like that could really happen. <br>  <br>  I know when I was in Germany shortly after Hurricane Katrina, it was big in the news and people were very concerned about what was going on, so I imagine it was even more so with 9/11. I took a class at a German university (I was there for a study abroad program) about memorials and remembrance and we talked quite a bit about 9/11, so it's clear it's still something which matters to them.<br>  <br>  I think obviously the response was more profound in America, but for comparison, think about how you felt when you heard about the Tsunami in the Indian Ocean in 2004 or the genocide in Darfur. I can imagine people throughout the world felt similar on 9/11.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help. I really hope you get a good answer.

But, in their defense, California did create it in a way. Look at housing costs, living costs, then look at the pay. <br>  <br>  Also, look at the Octo-Mom. She has 14 kids now, living off the government. The last 8 she went to the doctor to get pregnant. The only way she could have afforded this is if the insurance would have paid. Why would they have though? This one woman alone cost california a million dollars. She will continue to cost california even more as long as she remains the parent of these kids, getting even more food stamps, government money, and insurance.<br>  <br>  Illegal immigrants are also important in factoring this. California will not take a tough stand one way or another. Undocumented migrants eat resources of the state, not paying taxes the majority of the time yet using government funds.<br>  <br>  <edit> This is an important aspect of California's problem. California alone will not lead to another great depression. One of the answers to your question is the illegals and the problems it causes. No need to get upset at the answers, as long as they pertain to the problem.

aliPzDvyaa	First of all, I agree 100% that after Bush getting trashed for eight years, Obama getting an automatic pass seems unfair. But Bush certainly deserved plenty of his bashing since he carelessly walked into it day after day. And I think this bred a mindset that to joke about Bush was fine, because he said he didn't care anyway. His general manner made most people think him unworthy of admiration. Obama on the other hand is perceived in the opposite manner, again entirely due to the way he acts and presents himself. He comes across as a nice schoolteacher who makes you want to sit quietly and get good grades to make him proud of you. <br>  <br>  Both of the public perceptions of these two men are the just consequences of their respective demeanors. But race has played into it in a destructive way. If most people will come to judge all "whites" based on Bush, and all "blacks" based on Obama, our society is in for a world of hurt. <br>  <br>  Human society is too complacent with the way race has been perceived since the beginning of time. It's time to stop even talking about "blacks" and "whites". To even use those labels is to give in to the mindset that has caused racism up to this day. Humans may come in different colors, but it is our minds that define us. Label someone according to their ideals, not their bodies. And those who do otherwise need to reevaluate their own minds and ideals, imo.|`|iiVUtCBIaa	because he is the first black president and the media whats to create controversy over racism when they make jokes about him|`|F0n4FFsEaa	just cuz hes a man doesnt make every girly joke about him sexist|`|Uu95cDj7aa	uugghh!|`|Ao3Fl3iSaa	Really, this applies to anyone who is African-American in the limelight.<br>  It's a case of not distinguishing a racist remark from a joke.|`|FfxmE9Toaa	I see White Pride festivals all summer long.<br>  <br>  Italian Fest, Polish Fest, Scottish Highland Games, St Patrick's Day, Greekfest, heck when I was in Detroit we even had a weekend for Romanians.<br>  <br>  If you're referring to the NY Post chimpanzee cartoon, I suggest you read Leonard Pitts' column about it in the Miami Herald.

There's a lot of jokes about morons & many were true about him. Obama is smart, but he makes mistakes (and admits to them) that are funny if looked at the right way.<br>  <br>  So what's easier to make fun of, a mentally handicapped president with Darth Vader-like VP? Or an intelligent (yes, black) man who's had a few weeks to figure out how to dig us out of the moron's hole?|`|AA10691226	W faced no jokes about being white that I ever heard or saw. Jokes about him were about his space-cadet stupid look, his stumbling, mumbling delivery in speeches and press conferences and his history of drug abuse and ability to take more vacations than anyone in presidential history. His face was simian at least some of the time, too, but that was his particular features. Yes, I'm saying he looks like a dumb monkey. Not even a smart monkey. W was proud of being the type of guy others would like to have at a barbeque; he was a cheerleader in college and just couldn't be taken seriously, period.<br>  <br>  Obama is good-looking, speaks well and just isn't a jokey sort of person. He was editor of the Harvard Law Review, fer pete's sake. Making fun of his race is off-limits, just as with Bush. Making fun of him otherwise takes a little creativity, and obviously our so-called creative types don't have the chops to pull it off.<br>  <br>  But I can. These are the ways to make fun of Obama:<br>  <br>  Draw him with huge ears. <br>  <br>  Exaggerate those waggly eyebrows.<br>  <br>  Tease him about his seriousness.<br>  <br>  These are the only ways to get a good laugh at his expense.

It could be 18-34 men, 18-34 adults, 25-54 men...any combo of demos - that they are number 1.  Where is your source that they are number 1?  I would like to see it before I believe it.|`|F0uLexezaa	they conducted the poll themselves|`|yGf4eB6laa	It's not a very small number of Americans. There is a sizable number that call themselves Americans. Oops, I mean Republicans. Remember, 47 million people did not vote for Obama. So there's that group that watch Fox, plus another large group that now sees that Obama is a crazy spending socialist. And yes it's true, Fox is Number One in cable TV news. And in editorial cable TV, O'Reilly has been Number One going on 101 months now.

jTHJhy2laa	According to several prophecies the earth is scheduled to end on December 21,2012.If that happens it doesn't matter what the earth looks like since no one will be here to see it.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Same as it does now - sort of blue, with greeny bits on it, and white bits on the top and bottom.|`|X1U803Idaa	Pretty close to the same as it is today but in the bigger picture I think there will be less wildlife then now, more eroding beaches, smaller icecaps. By 2030 we won't be reliant oil anymore. Our technologies will keep advancing. What we use today will be obsolete. If the population continues to grow at the rate it is there will be more food crisis and disease. Off the top of my head that is all I can see at the moment.

zd9dotWHaa	I miss the videos. I really hate those shows.|`|reNnLWh4aa	i am right there with you buddy. trl destroyed mtv when they stopped playing videos in their entirety|`|se4sNWxFaa	I agree.  It is so sad that MTV doesnt show videos anymore.  Neither does VH1.  Now it is all reality shows, and if you want to watch videos you have to pay and subscribe to MTV 2, 3, etc.  Even with the subscription to other stations, the videos are not mainstream or very good.  You are better off watching videos online!|`|uL1hsu1Naa	I miss mtv as much as the next guy (wtf its MUSIC tv) but there is a lot more music on mtv 2 3 4 5 but u need to subscribe to those.|`|aICI9chpaa	I think we could!!!  I agree with you!  i think that reality shows should stop or maybe on the weekends only but bring back the videos!!
